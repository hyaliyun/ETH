Like the neighbouring Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, it was a sovereign member state of the German Confederation and became a federated state of the North German Confederation and finally of the German Empire upon the unification of 1871. After World War I and the German Revolution of 1918‚Äì19 it was succeeded by the Free State of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. Geography Map of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, with territories in yellow It consisted of two detached parts of the Mecklenburg region: the larger Lordship of Stargard with the residence of Neustrelitz to the southeast of the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg- Schwerin and the Principality of Ratzeburg on the west. The first was bounded by the Prussian provinces of Pomerania and Brandenburg, the second bordered on the Duchy of Lauenburg (incorporated into the Province of Schleswig-Holstein in 1876) and the territory of the Free City of L√ºbeck. Major towns beside Neustrelitz included Neubrandenburg, Friedland, Woldegk, Stargard, F√ºrstenberg, and Wesenberg. The Grand Duchy also comprised the former commandries of the Knights Hospitaller in Mirow and Nemerow. History The Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, established according to the dynastic Treaty of Hamburg in 1701, adopted the corporative constitution of the sister Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin by an act of September 1755. During the Napoleonic Wars it was spared the infliction of a French occupation through the good offices of King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria and his minister Maximilian von Montgelas; Duke Charles II of Mecklenburg-Strelitz declared neutrality in 1806 and joined the Confederation of the Rhine in 1808, however, he withdrew in 1813 on the eve of the German campaign in favor of an alliance against Napoleon. He joined the German Confederation established after the 1815 Congress of Vienna to succeed the dissolved Holy Roman Empire; he and his cousin Frederick Francis I of Mecklenburg-Schwerin both assumed the title of grand duke (Gro√üherzog von Mecklenburg). Neustrelitz Palace in 1900 Though Grand Duke Frederick William openly rejected the Prussian annexation of the Kingdom of Hanover, the Prussian Army had been aided by soldiers from Mecklenburg-Strelitz in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. Thereupon, the Grand Duchy joined the North German Confederation and the reconstituted Zollverein. Also in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870/71, the Kingdom of Prussia received valuable assistance from Mecklenburg-Strelitz. In 1871 both Mecklenburg- Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz became States of the German Empire. Mecklenburg-Strelitz returned one member to the Bundesrat chamber of states. However, the Grand Duke was still styled Prince of the Wends and the internal government of Mecklenburg-Strelitz remained unmodernized. Mocked by Chancellor Otto von Bismarck as a safe haven in the face of threatening apocalypse \\"as everything there happens 50 years later\\", the Grand Duchy had always been a government of feudal character. The Grand Dukes exercised absolute power through their ministers, with an antiquated type of diet representing social classes. It met for a short session each year, and at other times was represented by a committee consisting of the proprietors of knights' estates (), known as the Ritterschaft, and of the Landschaft, which was composed of burgomasters of selected towns. There was now a renewal of agitation for a more democratic constitution, and the German Reichstag gave some countenance to this movement. In 1904 Adolphus Frederick V, a son of Grand Duke Frederick William and his wife Princess Augusta of Cambridge, daughter of Prince Adolphus, became grand duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. In 1907, the grand duke promised a constitution to the duchy's subjects, but this was met with opposition from the nobility. Aftermath The Mecklenburg-Strelitz dynasty ended just prior to the loss of the monarchy in developments associated with World War I. At that time, there existed only two surviving recognized male dynasts of Strelitz, the young Grand Duke Adolphus Frederick VI, and his cousin Charles Michael, who was in Russian service, being a son of Grand Duchess Catherine Mikhailovna. In 1914, before the proclamation of war between Germany and Russia, Duke Charles Michael renounced his Mecklenburgish citizenship. On 23 February 1918, Grand Duke Adolf Frederick VI committed suicide, leaving his cousin Charles Michael as heir to the Strelitz throne. Being in Russia, however, Charles Michael did not assume the throne, and in 1918 he wrote to Grand Duke Frederick Francis IV of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, who was acting as regent in Strelitz, stating that he wished to renounce his rights of succession to Strelitz, though the letter was only received by Frederick Francis in 1919 after the end of the German monarchies, so the issue of succession could not be resolved at the time. The House of Mecklenburg- Strelitz survives to this day, descending from Duke George, the morganatic son of Duke George Alexander with Countess Natalia Carlow and nephew of Duke Charles Michael, who adopted him in 1928. George subsequently assumed the title \\"Duke of Mecklenburg\\" (Serene Highness) which was acknowledged by Grand Duke Frederick Francis IV of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. He was later given the style of \\"Highness\\" by the House of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. George's grandson Borwin is the present head of the House of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. The county of Mecklenburg in the U.S. state of North Carolina, which includes the city of Charlotte, is named after the duchy. The City of Charlotte, known as \\"The Queen City\\" was named for Queen Charlotte, wife of King George III of Great Britain. Queen Charlotte was Princess Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, born on 19 May 1744. She was the youngest daughter of Duke Charles Louis Frederick of Mecklenburg, Prince of Mirow and his wife Princess Elisabeth Albertine of Saxe-Hildburghausen.

Its members are known as Sƒ´ladharƒÅs. In 1983, he obtained permission from the Sangha in Thailand, to give a ten-precept pabbajjƒÅ to women, giving them official recognition as female renunciants trained in the Ajahn Chah lineage. The reasons for its establishment are due to the historical loss of the bhikkhunƒ´ (nun's) ordination in Theravada Buddhism, limiting renunciation for female Theravadins to ad hoc roles such as the thilashins and maechis, neither of which garner recognition from modern-day Theravada Buddhists as genuine renunciants. History Ajahn Sumedho enlisted Ajahn Sucitto to train the nuns from 1984 to 1991. By 2008, sƒ´ladharƒÅs were trained in the discipline of more than one hundred precepts, including rules based on the pƒÅ·π≠imokkha of the bhikkhunƒ´ order. The order waxed and waned throughout its brief history, peaking at around 14, mostly living at Amaravati Buddhist Monastery. Status In order to not violate national laws governing religious ordinations in predominantly TheravƒÅda countries, with the notable exception of Sri Lanka, the Sƒ´ladharƒÅ Order is formally considered junior to that of bhikkhus or fully ordained men. Over the last twenty years, many siladhƒÅras have therefore sought full bhikkhunƒ´ ordination with commensurate privileges, recognition and responsibilities enjoyed by male monastics. Making full ordination available to women a cultural issue with significant implications for the welfare of young girls living in poverty in Asian countries where Theravada Buddhism is prevalent, especially Burma, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Sri Lanka. Speaking of Thailand, Lynne Hybels writes, \\"Young men in desperately poor families such as those in Chiang Rai can bring honor to their families by becoming monks, but girls are expected to provide financially. Traffickers understand this vulnerability, prey on it, and easily lure girls into life in the brothel.\\" Such ordinations, however, are according to Buddhism itself motivated by wrong view; in particular, by careerism or economism, rather than by a sense of sa·πÅvega and genuine renunciation.Greenspoon, N. H. (2011, October 2). Good reason to ordain. Ask a Monk. Retrieved from http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEbaJbui8ao. After years of thorough discussion, Ajahn Sumedho issued a \\"Five-Point Declaration\\" concerning women's roles and rights in the Amaravati monastic community.http://west-wight-sangha.blogspot.com/2010/03/more-on-nun- ordinations-at-amaravati.html This affirmed the status quo of seniority of male over female monastics. The declaration holds that while some teaching and management responsibilities are shared between the two orders according to capability, the Siladhara Order is unequivocally junior to that of the monks. The \\"Five-Point Declaration\\" is considered by the very world (') renounced by monastics to be discriminatory against women.http://www.leighb.com/nuns.htmhttp://awakeningtruth.org/blog/?p=38 Some monastics and scholars also consider it to be an inaccurate interpretation of the vinaya and other texts,https://sujato.wordpress.com/2009/11/03/the-five- points/http://blogs.dickinson.edu/buddhistethics/2013/06/24/the-revival-of- the-bhikkhuni-order-and-the-decline-of-the-sasana/ similar to the Three-Fifths Compromise in the United States Constitution or other codified examples of discrimination such as coverture. In addition, the violations of national law that had been sought to avoid were distinct from the vinaya itself, as argued by Ajahn Brahmava·πÅso on the same matter.Betts, P. (2009, November 8).

Despite Ajahn Sumedho's best efforts at balancing contending interests, many female monastics living at Amaravati at the time left the monastery citing discrimination and lack of compassion on the part of Amravati leadership. Subsequently, several sƒ´ladharƒÅs from this group founded a community in the United States.http://saranaloka.org/ Along with numerous other women in recent years, these former Sƒ´ladharƒÅs have taken full bhikkhunƒ´ ordination.http://www.dhammawiki.com/index.php?title=Bhikkhuni_ordinationhttp://www.bhikkhuni.net/news/ References Bibliography  Category:Thai Forest Tradition Category:Buddhism in Sri Lanka Category:Theravada Buddhist orders Category:Religious occupations ","title":"Siladhara Order"},{"id":"7127838","text":"The view west from the trig point to the Helvellyn range. Loadpot Hill is a fell in the English Lake District, between Haweswater and Ullswater. Topography Although of moderate height, Loadpot Hill and its descending ridges cover an area of around . Standing to the north of Wether Hill, Loadpot Hill is the last principal height on the main ridge of the Far Eastern Fells, before the land falls away to Penrith and the River Eamont. The western slopes of the fell drop swiftly to Fusedale over a few outcrops of rock, Fusedale Beck flowing due north to Ullswater. North north west and north from Loadpot Hill, two short spurs fan out to the twin tops of Bonscale Pike and Arthur's Pike. These two fells, both with craggy faces overlooking Ullswater, are separated by Swarthbeck Gill. North east from Loadpot Hill the main ridge becomes broad and indistinct, falling gently in stages between the rivers Eamont and Lowther. These empty Ullswater and Haweswater respectively and converge 8 miles(13 km) from the summit, just south of Penrith. In fellwalking terms the practical northern boundary of Loadpot Hill is the road from Pooley Bridge to Askham. This encloses broad slopes of heather and fell grass, with a wide depression at Moor Divock (1,060 ft) and then a steeper rise to the independent top of Heughscar Hill (1,240 ft). Continuing from here to the road, plantations and other forms of cultivation gradually increase. Moor Divock is a site of historic interest, complete with tumuli, standing stones, boundary markers and stone circles. There are also sink holes and old quarries. The north east ridge has Heltondale Beck to the south, a feeder of the Lowther. Beyond this an east ridge descends from Loadpot Hill between Heltondale and Cawdale, both of which are deeply cut. This ridge has a subsidiary top, The Pen, which bears a beacon (columnar cairn). The Lowther valley and the Askham-Bampton road form the eastern boundary of the fell. South of Loadpot Hill a short ridge connects to Wether Hill, crossing a succession of peat hags. Summit The broad top of Loadpot Hill has a trig point marking its highest point. A little to the south of the summit stood Lowther House, an old shooting lodge, but nothing now remains but a pile of stone from the chimney. The Roman road (the High Street) which runs along the main ridge, makes a detour to the west around the summit of the fell before continuing north east via Moor Divock to Penrith. An extensive Lakeland view can be seen to the west with the Pennines more distant to the east. Ullswater can be brought into sight by moving a little to the west.Alfred Wainwright:A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Book 2: Ascents The main ascents are from Bampton or Helton via the east ridge, Pooley Bridge or Askham via the north east ridge, or Howtown via Fusedale. Ascents via Arthur's Pike are also popular. A good path runs north and south, using the Roman road periodically, and fainter paths also follow the branching ridges.

A slap hitter, Batts played mostly backup roles over the course of his career; during parts of ten MLB seasons, he appeared in 546 games with a .269 batting average, 26 home runs, and 219 runs batted in. Early and personal life Batts was born in San Antonio, Texas.Matt Batts Stats Baseball-Reference.com When his mother died, his father married his mother's sister. He was the uncle of former major leaguer Danny Heep. Path to the majors Growing up in the sandlots of San Antonio, Batts batted and threw right-handed. But in a fluke position change up, he found his niche behind the plate on a semipro team. He was a freshman at Baylor University and was recruited by Red Sox scouts. However, in 1942 when he signed with Boston in exchange for paying his tuition, the Baylor team dropped him. Batts' first season in the minor leagues was 1942, when he played for the Canton Terriers, Boston's affiliate in the Class C Middle Atlantic League. In 126 games, he batted .294, while hitting 10 home runs. He served in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II from December 1942 through December 1945; he was stationed at Randolph Field in Texas and rose to the rank of sergeant. In 1946, Batts played for the Lynn Red Sox in the Class B New England League, appearing in 98 games and batting .337 with 12 home runs. While with the Lynn Red Sox, Don Newcombe, future Most Valuable Player in the National League, recalled Batts as being a \\"redneck from the South,\\" and Batts thought it was funny to follow the old racist custom of rubbing a Negro's head for good luck.Campy: The Two Lives of Roy Campanella - Neil Lanctot - Google Books During 1947, Batts played for two Boston affiliates; the Scranton Red Sox of the Class A Eastern League, and the Toronto Maple Leafs of the Class AAA International League. He only appeared in 8 games with Scranton, losing playing time to another catcher, before transferring to Toronto when their catcher was injured. With Toronto, Batts appeared in 110 games, batting .262 with 7 home runs. After Toronto's season ended, Batts was called up to Boston. Major League Baseball Boston Red Sox Batts debuted with the Red Sox on September 10 of the season, striking out as a pinch hitter. He appeared in 7 games before the end of the season, batting .500 (8-for-16). During the season, as backup catcher to Birdie Tebbetts, Batts appeared in 46 games while batting .314 with 1 home run and 24 RBI.

In his 5 seasons with Boston, he appeared in a total of 199 games with a .272 batting average, 9 home runs, and 96 RBI. St. Louis Browns Batts spent the remainder of the season with the Browns, his only year with the club. He played in 79 games and hit .302 with 5 home runs and 31 RBI. On defense, despite his limited playing time led all catchers in the Major Leagues in errors committed, with 13, and led all Major League catchers in passed balls, with 11, and the 28 stolen bases he allowed were 5th-most among all AL catchers. He was among the first white catchers teamed with the American League's first black pitcher, Satchel Paige. During the offseason, Batts was traded to Detroit. Detroit Tigers In , Batts was backup to the Tigers' starting catcher, Joe Ginsberg, and only appeared in 56 games, batting .237 with 3 home runs and 13 RBI. On August 25, Batts caught the second of pitcher Virgil Trucks' two no-hitters that season. The following June, Ginsberg was traded, and Batts took over as starting catcher; for the 1953 season he appeared in 116 games with a .278 average, 6 home runs, and 42 RBI. He fielded 514 total chances, the most of his career, led all AL catchers in passed balls, with 13, the 24 stolen bases he allowed were 5th-most among all AL catchers, and he had a .986 fielding percentage, as his 7 errors at catcher were 5th-most of all NL catchers. Early in the season he played in 12 games with the Tigers, batting 6-for-21 (.286), before being traded to the White Sox in late May. Chicago White Sox With the White Sox for the remainder of the season, Batts appeared in 55 games, and batted .228/.299/.342, with 3 home runs and 19 RBI. Between the two teams, for the season he batted .235/.303/.341. Return to the minors In December 1954, the White Sox traded Batts to the Baltimore Orioles, who in turn sold him to the Cleveland Indians in April 1955. He did not make a major league appearance with either team. He started the 1955 season with Cleveland's farm team, the Indianapolis Indians of the Class AAA American Association. He appeared in 51 games for Indianapolis, batting just .231 with 4 home runs and 18 RBI. In July, his contract was purchased by Cincinnati, when their backup catcher Hobie Landrith was injured.

From May 14, 1724 to February 4, 1736 he was viceroy of Peru. Early career He entered the military and fought in the War of the Spanish Succession, on the side of Philip V of Spain. He saw action in the campaigns in Naples, Sardinia, Rosell√≥n and Catalonia, and in the siege of Gibraltar. Philip granted him the title of marquess of Castelfuerte on June 5, 1711. He was governor of Tarragona and captain general of Guip√∫zcoa. He was appointed a member of the Order of the Golden Fleece in 1737 on his return to Spain, and was also awarded the Order of Santiago. As viceroy of Peru In 1723 Philip named him viceroy of Peru, a position which he took up in May of the following year. His term in office was distinguished by a campaign against fraud and corruption in the government, and reform of the royal treasury and tax collection. He took steps to strengthen the mita, the forced labor of Indigenous in the silver mines, and thus to stimulate the production of the metal. He sent to jail the Count of San Juan de Lurigancho, director of the mint, as well as the assayer, for producing false coins. In order to fight smuggling (especially of silver), he reorganized the navy and fortified the coasts. He reestablished the system whereby Inca nobles who could prove their ancestry were recognized as hijosdalgos of Castile. This led to a frenzy on the part of the Indigenous nobility to legitimate their status. In 1724 society in Lima discovered an exotic drink -- coffee. One patron commented, \\"The new drink is as bitter as the new viceroy\\". The Comunero Revolt in Paraguay During this time the Comunero Revolt broke out in Paraguay. The governor of Paraguay, Diego de los Reyes Balmaseda, was an unpopular supporter of the Jesuits. A predecessor of Viceroy Armend√°riz, Carmine Nicolao Caracciolo, sent an inspector there in 1721 to look into the matter. The inspector was Jos√© de Antequera y Castro. Antequera, however, gained the support of the comuneros, challenged royal authority, imprisoned Reyes Balmaceda and expelled the Jesuits. (The Jesuits were unpopular because they sheltered many Indians from forced labor.) Antequera defeated a royalist force from Buenos Aires under Garc√≠a Ros. In 1724, Armend√°riz, now the viceroy in Lima, ordered Buenos Aires governor Bruno Mauricio de Zabala to suppress the rebellion and send Antequera to Lima for trial. Antequera's followers deserted him, and he was forced to flee to a convent in Cord√≥ba in March 1725. He was arrested at Chuquisaca in Charcas, and taken to Lima. He was eventually brought to trial, and in 1731 he was beheaded. However another revolt broke out in Paraguay in 1730, under Fernando Momp√≥ de Zayas. Momp√≥ asserted the sovereignty of the people over the king. Armend√°riz faced other rebellions as well. The first uprising of the Chiriguanos, led by Aruma, occurred in 1727.

The county park, established in 1947 contains the Sanchez Adobe Historical site, designated a National Register Historical District in 1976 and is California registered landmark 391. History The park site has a long and rich history. The S√°nchez Adobe at the park is considered the finest example of Mexican era architecture in San Mateo County. Archaeological and historical evidence identify four main periods of history, followed by the purchase of the site by the County of San Mateo in 1947. Native American Ohlone history Prior to 1786, the Ramaytush band of the Ohlone people had a settlement on the site, the village of Pruristac. Evidence of the village remains by a shell midden, located near the present day park ranger building. The Spanish explorer Gaspar de Portol√† camped nearby in 1769, ~ to the west from 31 October through 3 November, during the Portol√† expedition in upper Las Californias Province of New Spain. Journals from the expedition record of his group's meetings with the villagers, but give no indication that they visited the village. The first indigenous person baptised at the Mission San Francisco de As√≠s (Mission Dolores) was the 20-year-old Chamis in 1777. He was from the Ohlone village of Chutchui, and his mother lived at Pruristac. In 1782 and 1783, many of the people in Pruristac, including the village captain Mossu√©s and village leader Liquiique with their wives and daughters, went through Indian Reductions and relocated as Mission Indians to Mission Dolores. The mission was near the pueblo of Yerba Buena, which in 1847 become the city of San Francisco in Alta California. Two men of this group from Pruristac, with the baptismal names Hilarion and George, served as Indian leaders at Mission Dolores. They were alcades of the mission at the time of their deaths in 1807, while part of a Spanish posse during a skirmish with the Suisunes tribe. Mission period: 1786 to 1834 In 1776 the Spanish established a Mission and Presidio at nearby San Francisco, and baptismal records identify many Ohlone people from Pruristac emigrated to Mission Dolores. In 1786, the Mission established a asistencia, an outpost known as San Pedro y San Pablo Asistencia, at the site for the purpose of Missionary work and farming in support of the Mission. The site consisted of a granary, a chapel and four other rooms surrounding three sides of a plaza. Little remains of these original buildings, but archeological study has identified the location to be at the northeastern part of the park grounds. Initially, the farming included wheat, corn, beans, barley, asparagus, peas, rosemary, grape, peach and quince. Four years later, the farming was abandoned following a dramatic decline in the Native American population, after which the outpost subsisted through cattle ranching. The outpost was abandoned in 1834 with the dismantling of the California Mission network. Mexican rancho period: 1839 to 1848 Francisco S√°nchez, Commandante of the San Francisco Presidio and eighth alcade of the City of San Francisco,Early San Francisco Street Names: 1846-1849, San Francisco Museum. was awarded a land grant by the government of Mexico that included much of what is now northwestern San Mateo County. He built an adobe residence near the center of this ranch, known as Rancho San Pedro,Sanchez Adobe Park, National Park Service. in the San Pedro Valley (now Linda Mar Valley) at the site of the abandoned Mission Outpost San Pedro y San Pablo. It is widely speculated that he reused some of the bricks from the Outpost to construct the Adobe, which he began in 1842 and completed in 1846. The S√°nchez Adobe during the Kirkpatrick Period, 1885 American/Kirkpatrick period: 1871 to 1946 Edward Kirkpatrick purchased the property in 1871 and remodeled the Adobe extensively during the late 1880s, enlarging it to twenty rooms. In the following decades, the Adobe served a variety of purposes including a hotel called the Adobe House, and during Prohibition as a speakeasy. Ultimately, the Adobe served as a farm building associated with artichoke farming in San Pedro Valley during the 1940s. Modern period The County of San Mateo purchased the S√°nchez Adobe and the surrounding in 1947, and began a comprehensive restoration project completed in 1953. This included structural and architectural restoration of the Adobe and construction of several outbuildings on the park property including a caretakers residence. In 2002, the Adobe was further restored with a new roof. Annually, the City of Pacifica celebrates early California history with an event in mid-September known as Rancho Days, including music, historical reenactments and food. The San Mateo County History Museum operates Sanchez Adobe as an historic house museum. Visitors can explore the home, look at artifacts from archaeological digs and view the location of the original farm buildings. Admission is free. The museum offers school programs designed to teach students about life on a California rancho. References Bibliography *Milliken, Randall (1995). A Time of Little Choice. Menlo Park. Ballena Press.

It was located in License block OPL 212 off the Nigerian coast, which was renamed OML 118 in February 2000. The field covers approximately 60 km2 in an average water depth of . The field was discovered in 1996, with government approval for its development given in 2002. The field began first production in November 2005. The field is worked via an FPSO vessel. The field produces both petroleum and natural gas; the petroleum is offloaded to tankers while the gas is piped back to Nigeria where it is exported via an LNG plant. The field contains approximately 6,000 mm barrels of oil. The field is operated by Shell Nigeria who own 55% of the license. The other partners in the field development are Exxon (20%), Nigerian AGIP (12.5%) and Elf Petroleum Nigeria Limited (12.5%) Field history Located southwest of the Niger Delta, the first discovery well was spudded in September 1995 after acquiring extensive information about the block via a 3D seismic survey in 1993/94. A secondary field was discovered in the block in May 2001 known as Bonga SW, which encountered significant hydrocarbons. A third field was discovered later in 2004 which is known as Bonga North. Field development The Bonga FPSO The field has been produced as a subsea tie back to a Floating Production Storage and Offloading vessel (FPSO). Currently there are 16 oil producing and water injection wells on the field. However, this will be increased to nearly 40 wells as the field is developed further. Due to the large size of the Bonga SW it is currently thought it will require separate production facility to adequately produce the field. Oil produced from the field is stored on the FPSO for transport to markets via tankers while the gas is exported via a pipeline to the Nigerian Coast for LNG. The FPSO was built by Samsung Heavy industries. It contained a number of firsts for its type. The SURF (Subsea, Umbilicals, Risers, Flowlines) contract was won by Stolt Offshore (later renamed Acergy and now Subsea7 ). Stolt vessel POLARIS installed all the flowlines and subsea structures in J-Lay and S-Lay pipelay modes. Production at the well was shut down for three weeks after 19 June 2008, after an attack by the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta. 2011 oil spill On 20 December 2011 an oil spill occurred that \\"likely was less than 40,000 barrels, or 1.68 million gallons [6.4 megalitres]\\". It resulted in an oil slick long off the Nigerian coast. It was probably the worst spill in the area for a decade. Oil spills have the potential to cause great damage to the environment, for example water pollution, which reduces fishing yields and agriculture, which is one of Nigeria's largest industries.

Career Augustus Bouvier was the son of Paris-born artist Jules Bouvier (1800-1867), who moved to London with his family in 1818. His brother, Gustavus Arthur Bouvier, also became a British figure painter. Bouvier was a student at the Royal Academy. He later went on to complete his studies in France and Italy. In 1852 he exhibited for the first time at the Royal Academy, he continued to exhibit there over the years, often with genre scenes and a series of idealised feminine portraits such as Jessica in 1854, Emily in 1857, and Hermosita in 1859. Bouvier was one of the first artists known to have exhibited at the British Institution, where he debuted with the oil painting The Fish Market in Boulogne. From 1865 onward he was a member of the New Watercolour Society. While he specialized in figure paintings and portraits of elegantly dressed women in the English aristocracy, Bouvier also exhibited genre paintings (some of European scenes), and occasional domesticated mythological scenes like his The Three Graces of 1875. He also produced miniatures and sensitive watercolours. Influenced by the early aesthetic movement, his style relates to both Victorian academic painting and the Pre-Raphaelites.

In the slope there are villages and walled labyrinth-like farm-fields. Geography Cividade hill is located in the parish of Terroso, just east of the city. The hill, along with S√£o F√©lix, was used in the Middle Ages as the boundary of Varzim: Verazim ... subtus mons civitas Terroso discurrentes aquas ad mare, territorio Brachara (June 25, 1202).Estudos de Cronologia: Os mais antigos documentos escritos em portugu√™s - Instituto Cam√µes The expression \\"subtus mons\\" is typical on the Portuguese medieval documents and, as it was proved by Ferreira de Almeida, it is not just a topographic dependency, but, especially, an administrative and military dependency. Cividade, with S√£o F√©lix Hill, extends from the small Serra de Rates mountain range. It is the second highest hill in P√≥voa de Varzim, after S√£o F√©lix Hill. Protohistoric city City ruins. Cividade de Terroso was an important city of the Castro culture in North-western Iberian Peninsula, established during the Bronze Age, between 800 and 900 BC, as a result of the displacement of the people inhabiting the fertile plain of P√≥voa de Varzim. The most typical characteristic is its defensive system. The inhabitants had chosen to start living in the hill as a way of protection against attacks and looting by rival tribes. The migrations of Turduli and Celtici proceeding from the South of the Iberian Peninsula heading North were the reason for the improvement of the defensive systems of the castros around 500 BC. Cividade de Terroso is one of the most heavily defensive castros, given that the acropolis was surrounded by three rings of walls. The defensive perimeter seems to include a ditch of about 1 metre (3 feet 3 inches) of depth and width in base of the hill and a surveillance post in S√£o F√©lix Hill. Prehistoric necropolis A necropolis, with seven tumuli, dating to end of the Neolithic, early chalcolithic is known around the hill. The necropolis was built during the beginning of the permanent habitation of the region, 4 to 6 thousand years ago, and thus much older than Cividade itself. In Portugal, these barrows are called mamoa, from the Latin mammula, given to them by the Romans because of their shape, similar to the breast of a woman (mama in Portuguese). Near Cividade de Terroso there's the most relevant one, the Mamoa de Sej√£es. This tumuli is located near the hamlet of Sej√£es, in the eastern hill slope. Given the fact that no archaeological surveys were made until the present day, nothing is known about the structure of the monument, and after thousands of years it is still unbroken. Other nearby tumuli around Cividade and S√£o F√©lix hills, including Mamoa de Abade, just off Sej√£es, the Mamoa de Monte Redondo, Mamoa da Cova da Andorinha and Mamoa da Estrada, all broken. There are references to other tumuli and dolmens, including M√£o Pedrosa, Leira da Anta and another one in Balasar. Divino Salvador Chapel was built in 1670 as an abbot's mausoleum. Villages In the hill slope there are villages, namely Terroso, the seat of the civil parish. Terroso is a picturesque historical village with its parish church built in 1718, that includes in its assets the 16th century icon of Our Lady of Candeias, a Coimbra School sculpture. The icon is said to have washed up on the shore of Azurara and the people of several villages tried to get it, but were the ones from Terroso who grabbed it and it was seen as a sign. The Sancta Maria de Terroso parish is known since the 11th century. In Pra√ßa do Cruzeiro, the main entrance to Cividade de Terroso, there's the Divino Salvador Chapel built in 1670 by the Abbot Teot√≥nio de Miranda as his mausoleum. It has an interesting painted altarpiece that features the Miracle of Ourique. Ancient flora The vegetation that is currently found in the hilltop is the result of intense human activity for over 2000 years, and the human farming and forestry practices. In the modern period, eucalypts have been planted in pulpwood plantations, which P√≥voa de Varzim City Hall has been trying to eradicate and attempting to replace it with native flora that research proved to have existed in the area. Carbon analysis found in archaeological layers of Cividade de Terroso allowed the identification of twenty native species of trees and shrubs. * Alnus glutinosa (Black Alder) * Arbutus unedo (Strawberry Tree) * Corylus avellana (Hazel) * Erica arborea * Erica sp. * Ericaceae indet. * Frangula alnus * Fraxinus angustifolia * Leguminosae indet.

Notably, it was the very first high school in the country to perform the play Zoot Suit. Different levels of drama classes are offered; however, auditions for the productions put on throughout the year are open to all of the school's students. The drama department does three productions a year. The most recent fall production, To Kill a Mockingbird, starred Jave Hernandez as Atticus Finch. Fall productions The fall production is typically a two- act play performed in the drama room, anytime between November and December. Recent productions have included To Kill a Mockingbird (2014), Alice in Wonderland (2013), The Breakfast Club (2012), Love, Sex, and the I.R.S (2011), Brighton Beach Memoirs (2010), and Animal Farm (2009). The One-Acts The One-Acts are a series of four to eight one-act plays that are performed after the school's winter break. These are an opportunity for students to write and/or direct their own play, excluding the purely freshman one-act play directed by Crissey each year. Spring productions The spring production is a musical performed in the school's multipurpose room. Recent productions include Guys and Dolls (2015), Fame the Musical (2014), Footloose (2013), Little Shop of Horrors (2012), The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee (2011), and Guys and Dolls (2010).

The Mangamukas, as it is known by the local residents and many Northlanders because of the name of the settlement and river on the southern side, separates Kaitaia and the Aupouri Peninsula from the rest of Northland. The highest point in the Maungataniwha Ranges is Raetea at 744m. The range is home to many kauri trees and part of the range is a part of Northland Forest Park. The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of \\"taniwha mountain\\" for Maungataniwha. State Highway 1 crosses the range and passes through the Mangamuka Gorge. With a summit of 383m, the road is known to be one of the most winding, twisty and hilly section of the entire length of highway in New Zealand. It was built in the 1920s and was sealed in 1961, making it the preferred route from Whangarei to Kaitaia. In the early 1900s, a railway was proposed to either run through the ranges or run round them to connect Kaitaia and the Far North with the North Auckland Line or the Okaihau Branch line of the national rail network. After much debate, the idea never went ahead and in 1936 the decision was made not to extend the Okaihau Branch to Kaitaia and the extension from Okaihau to Rangiahua was closed.

The IUCN Red List status Least Concern is attributed to the species Felis silvestris, which at the time of assessment also included the African wildcat as a subspecies. In Cyprus, an African wildcat was found in a burial site next to a human skeleton in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B settlement Shillourokambos. The graves are estimated to have been established by Neolithic farmers about 9,500 years ago, and are the earliest known evidence for a close association between a cat and a human. Their proximity indicates that the cat may have been tamed or domesticated. Results of genetic research indicate that the African wildcat genetically diverged into three clades about 173,000 years ago, namely the Near Eastern wildcat, Southern African wildcat and Asiatic wildcat. African wildcats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Near East, and are the ancestors of the domestic cat (F. catus). Crossings between domestic cats and African wildcats are still common today. Taxonomy Felis lybica was the scientific name proposed in 1780 by Georg Forster who based his description on a specimen from Gafsa on the Barbary Coast that had the size of a domestic cat, but a reddish fur, short black tufts on the ears, and a ringed tail. Between the late 18th and 20th centuries, several naturalists and curators of natural history museums described and proposed new names for wildcat holotypes from Africa and the Near East, including: *Felis ocreata by Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1791 was based on a description of a wildcat encountered in northern Ethiopia by James Bruce. *Felis cafra by Anselme Ga√´tan Desmarest in 1822 was based on two wildcat skins from South Africa's Eastern Cape. *Felis ocreata mellandi by Harold Schwann in 1904 was based on two wildcat skins from northeastern Rhodesia in the collection of the Natural History Museum, London. *Felis ocreata rubida also by Schwann in 1904 was a skull and a fulvous skin of a male wildcat from Belgian Congo. *Felis ocreata ugandae also by Schwann in 1904 was a skull and a yellowish-grey skin of a male wildcat from Uganda. *Felis ocreata mauritana by √Ångel Cabrera in 1906 was a wildcat skin from the Mogador area in Morocco. *Felis ocreata taitae by Edmund Heller in 1913 was a skull and a light-coloured skin of a female wildcat from Voi in southeastern Kenya. *Felis ocreata iraki by Robert Ernest Cheesman in 1920 was a dove grey wildcat skin with salmon buff shading from Kuwait and another similar coloured specimen from the Tigris River. *Felis haussa by Oldfield Thomas and Martin Hinton in 1921 was a skull and a sandy- coloured skin of a male wildcat from the A√Ør Mountains south of Zinder. *Felis ocreata griselda and F. o. namaquana by Oldfield Thomas in 1926 was a pale wildcat skin from south of Benguela in Angola and another pale wildcat skin from Namaqualand in Namibia. *Felis lybica pyrrhus by Reginald Innes Pocock in 1944 was a series of ten greyish brown wildcat skins from Benguela. *Felis lybica tristrami also by Pocock in 1944 was a pale buffy white skin of an adult female wildcat from the Palestinian Moab area. *Felis lybica lowei, F. l. lynesi, F. l. foxi and F. l. brockmani also by Pocock in 1944 was a pale skin of an adult female wildcat from Marrah Mountains in the Darfur desert, a very pale skin of a male wildcat from north of Al-Fashir in Darfur, a dark skin of a male wildcat from Bauchi State in northern Nigeria, and a pale brown skin of a young adult male wildcat from the Golis Mountains in northern Somalia, respectively. *Felis silvestris gordoni by David Harrison in 1968 was a skull and a very pale grey brown striped skin of a female wildcat from west of Sohar in Oman. Since 2017, three African wildcat subspecies are recognised as valid taxa: *F. l. lybica, the nominate subspecies in North Africa and Sinai to Sudan *Southern African wildcat (F. l. cafra) in Southern Africa *Asiatic wildcat (F. l. ornata) in Asia  Phylogeny  Phylogenetic analysis of the nuclear DNA in tissue samples from all Felidae species revealed that the evolutionary radiation of the Felidae began in Asia in the Miocene around . Analysis of mitochondrial DNA of all Felidae species indicates a radiation at around . The African wildcat is part of an evolutionary lineage that is estimated to have genetically diverged from the common ancestor of the Felis species around , based on analysis of their nuclear DNA. Analysis of their mitochondrial DNA indicates a genetic divergence from Felis at around . Both models agree in the jungle cat (F. chaus) having been the first Felis species that diverged, followed by the black-footed cat (F. nigripes), the sand cat (F. margarita) and then the African wildcat. Based on a mitochondrial DNA study of 979 domestic and wildcats from Europe, Asia, and Africa, the African wildcat is thought to have split off from the European wildcat about 173,000 years ago, with the North African/Near Eastern wildcat splitting from the Asiatic wildcat and the Southern African wildcat about 131,000 years ago. About 10,000 years ago, some African wildcats were tamed in the Fertile Crescent and are the ancestors of the domestic cat. Domestic cats are derived from at least five \\"Mitochondrial Eves\\". African wildcats were also domesticated in ancient Egypt. The Egyptian domestic cat lineage started spreading in the Mediterranean Basin from the 8th century BCE onwards and arrived on the Baltic Sea coast by the 5th century CE. Characteristics Illustration of an African wildcat skull The fur of the African wildcat is light sandy grey, and sometimes with a pale yellow or reddish hue, but almost whitish on the belly and on the throat. The ears have small tufts, are reddish to grey, with long light yellow hairs around the pinna. The stripes around the face are dark ochre to black: two run horizontally on the cheek from the outer corner of the eye to the jaw, a smaller one from the inner corner of the eye to the rhinarium, and four to six across the throat. Two dark rings encircle the forelegs, and hind legs are striped. A dark stripe runs along the back, the flanks are lighter. Pale vertical stripes on the sides often dissolve into spots. Its tail has two to three rings towards the end with a black tip. Its feet are dark brown to black below. It differs from the European wildcat by inconspicuous stripes on the nape and shoulders, a less sharply defined stripe across the spine and by the slender tail, which is cylindrical, less bushy and more tapering. Ears are normally tipped with a small tuft. Its fur is shorter than of the European wildcat, and it is considerably smaller. Skins of male wildcats from Northern Africa measure in head-to-body length with a long tail. Skins of female wildcats measure with a long tail. Male wildcats from Yemen measure in head- to-body length with a long tail; females were slightly smaller measuring in head-to-body length with a long tail. Both females and males range in weight from . Distribution and habitat The African wildcat occurs across Africa, around the periphery of the Arabian Peninsula, and in the Middle East as far eastward as the Caspian Sea. It inhabits a broad variety of habitats, especially in hilly and mountainous landscapes such as the Hoggar Mountains. In deserts such as the Sahara, it occurs at much lower densities. It ranges across the area north of the Sahara from Morocco to Egypt and inhabits the tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands south of the Sahara from Mauritania to the Horn of Africa, including Somalia, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Djibouti and Sudan. Farther south, it is present in all East and Southern African countries.  In Mediterranean islands  The wild cat in Sardinia is of domestic cat origin. The wild cat in Sardinia and Corsica was long considered a subspecies of the African wildcat with the scientific name Felis lybica sarda. Results of zooarchaeological research indicate that it descended from domestic cats probably introduced at the beginning of the 1st millennium from the Near East. These populations are feral today. The wildcat on the island of Sicily is a European wildcat. Ecology and behaviour African wildcats are active mainly by night and search for prey. Their hearing is so fine that they can locate prey precisely. They approach prey by patiently crawling forward and using vegetation to hide. They rarely drink water. They hunt primarily mice, rats, birds, reptiles, and insects. When confronted, the African wildcat raises its hair to make itself seem larger in order to intimidate its opponent. In the daytime it usually hides in the bushes, although it is sometimes active on dark cloudy days. The territory of a male overlaps with that of up to three females. Hunting and diet In West Africa, the African wildcat preys on rats, mice, gerbils, hares, small to medium-sized birds, including francolins, and lizards. In Southern Africa, it also attacks antelope fawns and domestic stock, such as lambs and kids. In Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park, it preys foremost on murids, to a lesser extent also on birds, small reptiles and invertebrates.  Reproduction  The female's gestation period lasts between 56 and 60 days. In Botswana, she gives birth mostly during the warm wet season to one to three kittens. Litters of up to five kittens were also observed. Her birthing den is a sheltered place like dense grass, a burrow or hollow tree. The kittens open their eyes after about 10‚Äì14 days and are mobile at the age of one month. At around three months of age, they start learning hunting techniques from their mother. They leave the family and become independent at the age of around six months.  Conservation  stamp of Azerbaijan The African wildcat is included in CITES Appendix II. Alley Cat Rescue is currently the only organization known to have a program specifically aimed at conserving African wildcats and reducing what some refer to as genetic pollution by domestic cats. It has been discovered that a domestic cat can serve as a surrogate mother for wildcat embryos. The numerous similarities between the two species mean that an embryo of an African wildcat may be carried and borne by a domestic cat. A documentary by the BBC describes the details of the experiments that led to this discovery, and also shows a mature wildcat that was born by a surrogate female.  In philately  The Libyan Posts issued a postage stamp dedicated to Felis lybica in November 1997 in cooperation with World Wide Fund for Nature. This issue was also released as a set of four stamps printed on a minisheet.

The village is part of the Wickham Bishops and Woodham ward of the Maldon district. History The discovery of a hoard of denarii dated to 41 CE is some evidence of occupation in Roman times. However, the village first appears in written records as \\"Wudeham\\" in c. 975. The name, which means \\"village in the wood\\", is derived from the old English words \\"wudu\\" (wood in modern English) and \\"ham\\" (home, or homestead). At the time of the Norman Conquest the parish belonged to Ralph Peverell and was known as Little Woodham. Henry II gave the parish to Robert de Mortimer, leading to the change in name. In the Domesday Book the population was recorded as 14 households with the local lord in 1066 being Siward Barn. During the First World War a new aerodrome was opened in nearby Stow Maries to provide air cover for the London area. 37 Squadron, Royal Flying Corps occupied the base from September 1916 taking over The Grange in Woodham Mortimer as its headquarters. The Grange was once the property of Beeleigh Abbey and is a Grade II listed building. Demographics Approximately 45% of residents are classified using Experian's Mosaic system as type A4 (defined as 'financially secure couples, many close to retirement, living in sought after suburbs') and are predominantly white, Christian, English speaking and British born. As of 2009 the population was estimated at 641. Governance Woodham Mortimer has a parish council and is part of the Wickham Bishops and Woodham ward of the Maldon district. The district forms part of the Witham constituency for parliamentary elections. The local MP is Priti Patel. Geography Woodham Mortimer has an average elevation of above sea level and lies just south of the Danbury-Tiptree ridge that marks the furthest extent of the Anglian ice sheet during the last ice age approximately 450,000 years ago. The geology of the area is rock, sand and gravels that were deposited by the retreating ice. Gravel is commercially extracted from the Royal Oak Quarry with a proposed additional site at Tynedales Farm of . The National Soil Resources Institute at Cranfield University describes the main soil type as \\"slowly permeable seasonally wet slightly acid but base-rich loamy and clayey soils.\\" Climate Woodham Mortimer is considered by the Met Office to be part of the Eastern England region, however, for the purposes of historical climate data it is consolidated into the East Anglia region. Climate information for the period 1981 ‚Äì 2010 is detailed below. Economy There are two public houses, the Royal Oak on the A414 and the Hurdlemakers Arms on Post Office Road. Its name refers to the hurdles which used to be made from materials cut in the nearby woods. There is a golf driving range with 9-hole pitch and putt that was opened in 1967 on Burnham Road. Crime Woodham Mortimer is policed by Essex Police and is part of the Purleigh Neighbourhood Policing Team which covers a number of areas with a total population of 10,936. In 2011, there were 516 reported crimes in the NPT. There is no local police station. Culture and facilities Village hall Next to the village hall is a playing field with swings and a small football pitch. Religious sites St Margaret's Church, next to Woodham Mortimer Hall, by Robert Edwards The parish church is St Margaret's. The original church on the site may date from the 16th century, however, it was rebuilt in the 19th century leaving little evidence of the older church with only the south wall and east end remaining. Evidence for the age of the church includes the 13th century font (although the base is newer) and the 17th century carvings on the pulpit. The church has a small window commemorating Queen Victoria's diamond jubilee. The graveyard includes the grave of Peter Chamberlen. Landmarks Woodham Mortimer Hall by Trevor Harris Woodham Mortimer Hall is a 17th-century gabled house that Hugh and Peter Chamberlen lived in. There is a blue plaque fixed to the hall noting them as pioneering obstetricians who invented the forceps. The hall passed out of the Chamberlen family in 1715 when the family home was sold. The forceps were found in 1813 under a trap door in the loft of the hall and given to the Medical and Chirurgical Society which passed them to the Royal Society of Medicine in 1818. The find was described by R. Lee in Observations on the Discovery of the Original Obstetric Instruments of the Chamberlens (1862) as: Memorial to William Alexander by Glyn Baker There is a war memorial commemorating the nine people from the village who died during the World Wars. There is also a Grade II listed memorial erected in 1825 to William Alexander, who left his lands to the Worshipful Company of Coopers for the benefit of the poor.

The Hindus believe that Manu recreated human life in Manikaran after the flood, making it a sacred area. It has many temples and a gurudwara. There are temples of the Hindu deities Rama, Krishna, and Vishnu. The area is well known for its hot springs and its beautiful landscape. According to legend, when the Hindu God Shiva and his consort Parvati were walking in the valley, Parvati dropped one of her earrings. The jewel was seized by Shesha, the serpent deity, who then disappeared into the earth with it. Shesha only surrendered the jewel when Shiva performed the cosmic dance, the Tandava and shot the jewel up through the water. Apparently, jewels continued to be thrown up in the waters at Manikaran until the 1905 Kangra earthquake.Minakshi Chaudhry, Destination Himachal, p. 208. Rupa and Co. Publ.

Mardana felt hungry and they had no food. Guru Nanak sent Mardana to collect food for the langar (the Community Kitchen). Many people donated atta (flour) to make Roti(bread). The one problem was that there was no fire to cook the food. Guru Nanak asked Mardana to lift a stone and he complied and a hot spring appeared. As directed by Guru Nanak, Mardana put the rolled chapatis in the spring to his despair the chapatis sank. Guru Nanak then told him to pray to God saying that if his chapatis float back then he would donate one chapati in His name. When he prayed all the chapatis started floating duly baked. Guru Nanak said that anyone who donates in the name of God, his drowned items float back. Manikaran gurdwara Hindu belief Shiv Parvati Temple at Manikaran The legend of Manikaran states that while roaming around, Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati, once chanced upon a place that was surrounded by mountains and was lush green. Enamoured by the beauty of the place, they decided to spend some time there. It is believed that they actually spent eleven hundred years here. During their stay here, Goddess Parvati lost her mani (precious stoneshttp://dict.hinkhoj.com/words/meaning- of-%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%A3%E0%A4%BF-in-english.html) in the waters of a stream. Upset over the loss, she asked Shiva to retrieve it. Lord Shiva commanded his attendant to find the mani for Parvati. However, when they failed, he was extremely angry. He opened his third eye, a tremendously inauspicious event which led to disturbances in the universe. An appeal was made before the serpent god, Sheshnag, to pacify Lord Shiva. Sheshnag hissed thereby giving rise to a flow of boiling water. The water spread over the entire area resulting in the emergence of precious stones of the type Goddess Parvati had lost. Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati were happy at the outcome. The name Manikaran is derived from this legend. The water is still hot and is considered extremely auspicious. A pilgrimage to this place is thought of as complete. It is also believed that there is no need to pay a visit to Kashi after visiting this place. The water of the spring is also supposed to have curative powers. The water is so hot that rice can be cooked in it.

The screenplay was written by Hilary Henkin and Dean Riesner. The original music score was composed by Harold Faltermeyer, of Top Gun fame. The film was marketed with the tagline \\"An earthquake is about to hit L.A. It's called Detective Rita Rizzoli.\\" Plot Detective Rita Rizzoli (Whoopi Goldberg) an undercover narcotics police officer, stages an undercover buy with drug dealer Tito Delgadillo (Fred Asparagus). During the bust she sees her friend and informant Charlene (Cathianne Blore) being dragged out of the bar by her pimp and runs to her aid, thus alerting Delgadillo of her being an undercover cop. After saving Charlene and shooting the pimp, Rizzoli notices all the money used for the buy is missing. Delgadillo retreats to a warehouse in Los Angeles where a family of Asian immigrants is preparing plastic envelopes of imported cocaine stamped with the gang's brand name \\"Fatal Beauty\\". One worker, however, has been sampling too much of the drug and, in his intoxicated state, prepares envelopes with a fatally high concentration of cocaine and a misaligned stamp. Delgadillo discovers the error but before they can correct it, the house is attacked by two small-time hoods, Leo Nova and Earl Skinner (Brad Dourif and Mike Jolly) who kill everyone within including Delgadillo and steal the lethal product. Back at the police station, Rizzoli is chewed out by her boss, Lt. Kellerman (John P. Ryan), for ruining the bust. He receives a call saying Rizzoli is needed at the warehouse where the drugs were being made. At the warehouse Rizzoli identifies Delgadillo (the only victim authorities weren't able to identify because his face was mutilated during the attack) by pointing out the diamond pinkie ring on his finger bearing his initials that he showed Rizzoli earlier that evening. Rizzoli also discovers traces of \\"Fatal Beauty\\" and Charlie Dawson's body, which was stuffed in a van labeled \\"Kroll Enterprises\\". The next morning Rizzoli receives a call from Charlene, asking for money. When Rizzoli refuses, Charlene offers some information about the drug-related murder the previous night, hoping to sway Rizzoli to give her the money. Charlene tells Rizzoli that there is a goon squad looking for the killers. She also tells her that the person, to whom all the drugs belonged, drove a \\"Rolls.\\" That prompts Rizzoli to pay a visit to Conrad Kroll (Harris Yulin), whom she accuses of drug dealing. After leaving Kroll's home, Rizzoli hears a call for assistance over the scanner involving a police standoff. Realizing that Charlene lives there, she immediately rushes to the location. At the location a man who is hopped up on drugs emerges from Charlene's house and shoots Rizzoli's fellow officer, Shigeda (Steve Akahoshi) in the arm, wounding him. The assembled officers all open fire on the man, but due to the drugs in his system, he doesn't go down right away. After the man finally falls to the ground and dies, Rizzoli runs into Charlene's house, where she attempts to resuscitate her with no success. Rizzoli is told by a boy at the location that both Charlene and the man who was shot, \\"Big Bubba\\" were both taken out by the new drugs and that they got it from Charlene's new pimp, \\"Jimmy\\". Rizzoli and her partner Detective Jimenez (Rub√©n Blades) find him in a restaurant, where Rizzoli places him under arrest; when he tries to escape, she shoots him in the buttocks. After hanging him up in the freezer and threatening more bodily harm, Rizzoli gets him to reveal that he purchased the drugs from a buy house from a man named Rafael. Rizzoli heads to the buy house the pimp told her about and is greeted by a man named Epifanio, who tells her he will get her what she wants. She is able to get Epifanio to take her to Rafael, but a hood from the night she staged the bust with Delgadillo recognizes her as a cop and immediately alerts Nova and Skinner. Rizzoli is able to get locked in a room with Rafael, where she gets Rafael to admit he is fronting for Nova and Skinner right as two of his crew members shoot their way inside. Rizzoli dives for safety, but Rafael is killed in the crossfire. Rizzoli shoots down one of the thugs, but the other gets the drop on her, but she is saved by the timely arrival of Mike Marshak, Kroll's bodyguard (Sam Elliott) who shows up at the buy house to help Rizzoli, and admits that he has been following her around since the night before by using a transmitter concealed under her bumper. After taking out the rest of Rafael's gang, Rizzoli and Marshak come close to apprehending Nova and Skinner when a section of the a roof collapses on Rizzoli; Marshak immediately runs to her aid, letting Nova and Skinner escape. Rizzoli is taken to a nearby hospital, Vista Verde where Marshak goes to visit her. Upon walking into Rizzoli's room, Marshak sees Rizzoli and Jiminez going over the mug shots of Nova and Skinner and Jiminez immediately leaves after Marshak's arrival. When Jiminez goes toward the elevator he notices Nova from the mug shot carrying a package and orders him to freeze. Nova pulls out a shotgun from the package and fires at Jiminez, missing him. After getting into an argument about what Marshak's boss Kroll is allegedly doing, Rizzoli agrees to let Marshak drive her home. Rizzoli notices her cat on the roof and explains to Marshak about her cat's fear of heights and her front door being open. They both go into her residence see Zack Yeager (James LeGros) asleep. Yeager tells Rizolli that all his friends have died from using Fatal Beauty. This is further confirmed when he, Rizzoli and Marshak arrive at the home of one of the kids who threw the party and finds them all lying dead in the living room. Yeager tells Rizolli he got the drugs from his mother, Cecille (Jennifer Warren). When Rizzoli goes to Cecille in an attempt to get information about where the drugs came from, the two get into a physical altercation until Marshak arrives to break it up and takes Rizolli home. At home, Rizzoli invites Marshak into her house for some coffee and receives a phone call that four young children had died from using Fatal Beauty; Rizzoli then has a breakdown and tells Marshak that she is a recovering drug addict, having quit after her daughter got into her drug stash and drowned in a swimming pool. Rizzoli takes a shower, during which she receives a call and notices Marshak has left, and that he went through her police files of the suspects she was after. At the point Rizzoli learns that Kroll had sent Marshak not to protect Rizzoli, but to spy on her to find out who ripped him off. Rizzoli receives a call from Cecille learning that Zack had cut his wrist and was in the hospital. Cecille asks Rizzoli to meet her at the hospital where she reveals who she bought the drugs from and that her supplier, Denny Mifflin (Neill Barry), will be making a pickup from his suppliers Nova and Skinner at Kroll Plaza. Rizzoli and Jiminez head to Kroll plaza and are spotted by Kroll's security team. Rizolli and Jiminez are watching Mifflin and Rizolli orders Jiminez to get the drugs away from some kids that they spotted Mifflin selling to. When Jiminez gets the drugs from the kids he is knocked out by one of Kroll's security men. When Kroll is alerted to Rizzoli's presence, Marshak who is with Kroll notices Nova and Skinner entering the plaza. Kroll orders one of his men to take out Nova and Skinner and then orders Marshak to take out Rizzoli. Rizzoli meanwhile notices Nova, Skinner, Mifflin and his bodyguard, Frankenstein (Mark Pellegrino) meeting together in a mall store to discuss drug distribution and follows them into the store. Rizzoli is followed into the store by Kroll's security team with their guns drawn. Just as Rizzoli is about to bust Nova, Skinner, Mifflin and Frankenstein she is accosted by Marshak who warns her it is a wipeout in which all five of them are going to be killed. Rizzoli then punches Marshak, which frightens Nova, Skinner, Mifflin and Frankenstein. When running in the store, Frankenstein is grabbed by one of the security guards. He then stabs him in the stomach. The security guard falls to the ground knocking over a rack of clothes. Frankenstein then is grabbed by Kroll's bodyguard, Eddie and is shot three times in the stomach. Frankenstien slashes Eddie's arm with his switchblade, forcing him to back off, but dies seconds later while calling to Mifflin for help. Rizzoli then shoots Mifflin after he fires at her. Rizzoli and the security guards pursuit Nova and Skinner, who open fire in the mall, killing several guards and Eddie, and then retreat into a sporting goods store, followed by another of Kroll's men and three surviving guards. Nova and Skinner race to the back of the store and shoot the fuse boxes, cutting the main power to the store lights (but the emergency lights come on seconds after). Rizzoli cautiously makes her way through the store, but the security guards get the drop on her, but she is inadvertently saved by Nova and Skinner when they gun the guards down. A short gun fight ensues between Rizzoli and the two men, but she runs out of ammunition. Nova and Skinner try to move in and finish her off, but she manages to give them the slip long enough to break into a gun cabinet and get a lever action rifle and some bullets. After Rizzoli kills Kroll's other bodyguard who was poised to ambush her from above and takes his gun, the shelf he was standing on collapses on her and Skinner prepares to kill her; at the last minute, however, Marshak appears and guns him down. Nova wounds Marshak before he, in turn, is wounded by Rizzoli, and retreats from the store. Rizzoli pursues Nova and runs into Kroll, who is about to kill her when Nova jumps out of a hiding place and kills him. Rizzoli follows Nova into a parking garage and shoots him several times, apparently unable to injure him. After Nova reveals to Rizzoli he was wearing a bullet- proof vest this whole time Rizolli pulls out a gun she stole from the dead guard and shoots Nova in the throat, killing him. Rizzoli meets the paramedics outside the plaza, where Jiminez is waiting along with Marshak, who muses to Rizzoli that he might be going to jail for a long time because of his connection to Kroll. Rizzoli agrees, but tenderly tells him that she'll be waiting for him when he gets out. She then gives him a kiss and tells him with a smile that he'll be fine.

Boston Globe 05 May 1986: 21. In July 1986 John Milius was working on the script and intending to direct. Cher ended up dropping out to star in Moonstruck. By November Tom Holland was attached as director with Whoopi Goldberg to star. Brad Dourif's performance as the villain led to Holland casting him as the villain in Child's Play. Reception Critical The film was unpopular with many critics (though Roger Ebert gave it a positive review of 3 stars), some of whom considered it a rip-off of Beverly Hills Cop (which Faltermeyer also scored); others cited a lack of chemistry in the romance between Goldberg and Elliott's characters. Movie historian Leonard Maltin called it \\"inexcusably awful, with gratuitous violence and mind- boggling dialogue, using an anti-drug message to rationalize its excesses.\\" Fatal Beauty holds a score of 25% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 12 reviews. Flixster Director Holland later admitted that Fatal Beauty was an effort to expand his range as a filmmaker beyond the horror genre, but that FB was a mistake. \\"Initially,\\" he says today, \\"they planned to cast Cher as Rita.

It featured a unique angled cabinet design and a combination of trackball and joystick controls. The player assumes the role of Kapt'n Krooz'r, a small, green alien within a bubble-topped spaceship who also appears in the game Kozmik Krooz'r. The goal of each level is to eliminate the monsters, accomplished by shooting twin pairs in succession. As the player progresses, shooting monsters out of order creates mutants that must be unmatched before they can be eliminated. Gameplay The player moves Kapt'n Krooz'r with the trackball and fires in four directions using either joystick. Shooting a single monster stuns it for a few seconds. The player must then shoot the monster's twin before the first one recovers in order to eliminate the pair. On later boards, shooting a different monster results in the two becoming a mutant‚Äîthe head of one joins with the torso of the other, and vice versa. To eliminate these mutants one must either unmix them, by shooting the same pair again, or produce a second identical mutant which can then be paired up with the first. Eliminating a pair of mutants is worth more points than eliminating a pair of non-mutants. As the player advances from board to board, the following additional transformations appear, introduced one at a time: *Matched pairs of large monsters become tiny and fly around the screen *Tiny monsters turn into eggs and run around *Eggs turn into bats Each new form requires only one shot to be either destroyed or changed into the next one. All monsters on the screen must be turned into the next form before any of them can be destroyed or further transformed. Legacy Wacko is available as a part of two compilations of arcade games: Midway Arcade Treasures 2, for the GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox; and Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition for the PC. Steve Harris of Missouri, USA, scored a world record 1,608,100 points playing Wacko at the NKC Pro Bowl in Kansas City, Missouri, USA, on March 31, 1983.

Werner Kern developed the basic procedure in 1965 while working for RCA, the Radio Corporation of America.RCA Clean, materials at Colorado School of Mines W. Kern and D. A. Puotinen: RCA Rev. 31 (1970) 187. It involves the following chemical processes performed in sequence: # Removal of the organic contaminants (organic clean + particle clean) # Removal of thin oxide layer (oxide strip, optional) # Removal of ionic contamination (ionic clean)  Standard recipe  The wafers are prepared by soaking them in deionized water. If they are grossly contaminated (visible residues), they may require a preliminary cleanup in piranha solution. The wafers are thoroughly rinsed with deionized water between each step. Ideally, the steps below are carried out by immersing the wafers in solutions prepared in fused silica or fused quartz vessels (borosilicate glassware must not be used, as its impurities leach out and cause contamination). Likewise it is recommended that the chemicals used are electronic grade (or \\"CMOS grade\\") to avoid impurities that will recontaminate the wafer.  First step (SC-1): organic clean + particle clean  The first step (called SC-1, where SC stands for Standard Clean) is performed with a solution of (ratios may vary) * 5 parts of deionized water * 1 part of ammonia water, (29% by weight of NH3) * 1 part of aqueous H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide, 30%) at 75 or 80 ¬∞C typically for 10 minutes. This base-peroxide mixture removes organic residues. Particles are also very effectively removed, even insoluble particles, since SC-1 modifies the surface and particle zeta potentials and causes them to repel. This treatment results in the formation of a thin silicon dioxide layer (about 10 Angstrom) on the silicon surface, along with a certain degree of metallic contamination (notably iron) that will be removed in subsequent steps.  Second step (optional): oxide strip  The optional second step (for bare silicon wafers) is a short immersion in a 1:100 or 1:50 solution of aqueous HF (hydrofluoric acid) at 25 ¬∞C for about fifteen seconds, in order to remove the thin oxide layer and some fraction of ionic contaminants. If this step is performed without ultra high purity materials and ultra clean containers, it can lead to recontamination since the bare silicon surface is very reactive. In any case, the subsequent step (SC-2) dissolves and regrows the oxide layer.  Third step (SC-2): ionic clean  The third and last step (called SC-2) is performed with a solution of (ratios may vary) * 6 parts of deionized water * 1 part of aqueous HCl (hydrochloric acid, 37% by weight) * 1 part of aqueous H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide, 30%) at 75 or 80 ¬∞C, typically for 10 minutes. This treatment effectively removes the remaining traces of metallic (ionic) contaminants, some of which were introduced in the SC-1 cleaning step. It also leaves a thin passivizing layer on the wafer surface, which protects the surface from subsequent contamination (bare exposed silicon is contaminated immediately).  Fourth step: rinsing and drying  Provided the RCA clean is performed with high-purity chemicals and clean glassware, it results in a very clean wafer surface while the wafer is still submersed in water. The rinsing and drying steps must be performed correctly (e.g., with flowing water) since the surface can be easily recontaminated by organics and particulates floating on the surface of water. A variety of procedures can be used to rinse and dry the wafer effectively.  Additions  The first step in the ex situ cleaning process is to ultrasonically degrease the wafer in trichloroethylene, acetone and methanol.

Published in April 1832, the novel blends the conventions of romanticism, realism and idealism. As the novel is set partly in France and partly in the French colony of R√©union, Sand had to base her descriptions of the colony, where she had never been, on the travel writing of her friend Jules N√©raud.  Summary  One edition illustrated by Maurice Toussaint Indiana is the story's heroine, a young noblewoman descended from French colonial settlers from √éle Bourbon (now La R√©union) and currently living in France. Indiana is married to an older ex- army officer named Colonel Delmare and suffers from a variety of unknown illnesses, presumably due to the lack of passion in her life. Indiana does not love Delmare and searches for someone who will love her passionately. She overlooks her cousin Ralph, who lives with her and the colonel. As it turns out, Ralph is in love with Indiana. When their young, handsome, and well- spoken neighbor, Raymon de Ramiere declares his interest to Indiana, she falls in love with him. Raymon has already seduced Indiana's maid, Noun, who is pregnant with his child. When Noun finds out what is going on, she drowns herself. Indiana's husband decides that they will move to √éle Bourbon. Indiana escapes the house to faithfully present herself in Raymon's apartments in the middle of the night, expecting him to accept her as his mistress in spite of society's inevitable condemnation. He at first attempts to seduce her but, on failing, rejects her once and for all. He cannot bear the thought that her will is stronger than his and writes her a letter intended to make her fall in love with him again, even though he has no intention of requiting this love. Indiana has moved to the Island with the Colonel by the time she reads the letter. She resists the letter but finally returns to France on a perilous sea journey. When she arrives in Paris the French Revolution of 1830 is taking place. In the meantime, Raymon has made an advantageous marriage and bought Indiana's house, where he and his wife live. The stoic and remote Sir Ralph, whom Indiana has always seen as an '√©goiste', suddenly comes to rescue her and tell her that Colonel Delmare has died from a fever. Indiana and Ralph decide to commit suicide together by jumping into a waterfall on the √éle Bourbon. But on the way home they fall in love. Just before the suicide, they declare their love for one another and pledge that they will be married in Heaven. At the end of the novel comes a conclusion, a young adventurer's account of finding a man and woman, Ralph and Indiana, living on an isolated farm on the Island.  Themes  The novel deals with many typical nineteenth-century novelistic themes. These include adultery, social constraint, and unfulfilled longing for romantic love. The novel is an exploration of nineteenth-century female desire complicated by class constraints and by social codes about infidelity. In another sense, the novel critiques the laws around women's equality in France. Indiana cannot leave her husband, Colonel Delmare, because she lacks the protection of the law: under the Napoleonic Code, women could not obtain property, claim ownership of their children, or divorce. Finally, the novel touches on the subordination of the colonies to the French Empire.

This alleged act of defiance was later immortalised in The Private of the Buffs, a poem by Sir Francis Hastings Doyle. Historical background The Second Opium War (1856‚Äì1860) was fought to guarantee European sovereignty of the seas after a Chinese-owned and British-registered ship, The Arrow, was seized in 1856 for being involved in smuggling and piracy. Since it had been flying the British Ensign, the British government pressed for an apology. They allied with France and Russia and invaded China from 1857 to 1858. In 1858, China sued for peace and agreed to the Treaty of Tientsin, which allowed the creation of French and English embassies in Beijing, and the Treaty of Aigun, which redrew Russia's border with China. In 1859, after China repudiated the Treaty of Tientsin, the war continued. A naval force under the command of Admiral Sir James Hope shelled the forts guarding the mouth of the Peiho river. It was damaged and withdrew under the cover of fire from a naval squadron commanded by Commodore Josiah Tattnall. In 1860, an Anglo-French army gathered at Hong Kong and then carried out a landing at Pei Tang on 3 August, and a successful assault on the Taku Forts on 21 August. On the march to Beijing the Anglo-French forces pushed aside several Manchu military units but the fighting was limited. \\"The Private of the Buffs\\" On 13 August 1860 during the march on the Taku Forts, a party of Sikh sappers and some laborers transporting their column's rum rations were captured by a force of Tartar cavalry. Among them was Private John Moyse of the 3rd (East Kent) Regiment (also known as \\"The Buffs\\") and an unnamed sergeant of the 44th (East Essex) Regiment. The next day the prisoners were brought before a local mandarin and were ordered to kow-tow, under penalty of torture or execution if they did not comply. Private Moyse alone refused and was savagely beaten and then beheaded, his body afterwards thrown on a dungheap. He was, ironically, his regiment's only casualty in the fighting. The cause of his refusal has been a subject of much dispute. The popular story was that it was on the grounds that it would disgrace his country. However, it has been surmised that Moyse, who had a history of insubordination, refused out of personal pride and stubbornness. When the prisoners were released a week later, their tale of Moyse's bravery spread through the army. His act of defiance was later celebrated in The Private of the Buffs, a poem by Sir Francis Hastings Doyle. The poem refers to Moyse as a newly recruited young Kentish farmboy but he was, in fact, a veteran middle-aged Irishman who had recently been broken in rank. However, the poem was written on the strength of newspaper reports, and it is likely that Doyle was unaware of the discrepancies. The historical sources Despite the report in The Times, there is some question as to whether the incident took place as popularly supposed. Garnet Wolseley, who was present at the taking of the Taku forts, insists that \\"The man belonging to the Buffs was either killed, or 'died of drink,' as the Chinese say.\\" The source of the information‚Äîa soldier in the 44th Regiment‚Äîwas, according to Wolseley, not reliable. \\"His mind, indeed, seemed to be unbalanced, as in addition to the untruths he told, he talked utter nonsense about what he pretended he had overheard his captors say.\\"Garnet Wolseley Wolseley, Narrative of the War with China in 1860; to Which Is Added the Account of a Short Residence with the Tai-Ping Rebels at Nankin and a Voyage from Thence to Hankow (London: Longman, Green, Longman, and Roberts, 1862) p. 112. D.F. Rennie, a doctor with the British troops, also denies that the incident took place.D.F.

The locality in South Bangalore began purely as a residential area but gradually transformed into a cosmopolitan area with opportunity for both residential and commercial projects. This transformation was a result of the boom of colleges and IT industries being set up in the vicinity. Previously it had bungalows and independent houses but the IT boom in the late 1990s converted it into a semi-commercial area. It is located between Bannerghatta road and Kanakapura road. JP Nagar contains some famous lakes, such as Sarakki lake, Puttenahalli Lake (JP Nagar), Jaraganahalli Lake, Chunchugatta lake, Konanakunte Lake, Avalahalli Lake, Krishna Nagar Lake and so on. Over the years, because of massive urbanization, some of these lakes shrank and became polluted and some lakes, such as Jaraganahalli Lake, were entirely encroached by private parties. Off late a lot of lake conservation projects have been initiated to save them. For example the Puttenahalli lake. It was developed in two stages. JP Nagar 1st through 6th phases.

It has detrimental effect on plants and causes their death. Fusicoccins are diterpenoid glycosides produced by the fungus Fusicoccum amygdali, which is a parasite of mainly almond and peach trees. It stimulates a quick acidification of the plant cell wall; this causes the stomata to irreversibly open, which brings about the death of the plant. Fusicoccins contains three fused carbon rings and another ring which contains an oxygen atom and five carbons. Fusicoccin was and is extensively used in research regarding the plant hormone auxin and its mechanisms. Biosynthesis Fusicoccin is a member of a diterpenoid class which shares a 5-8-5 ring structure and is called fusicoccane. In fungi, fusicoccin is biosynthesized via Phomopsis amygdali fusicoccadiene synthase (PaFS) from universal C5 isoprene units dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) and isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP). PaFS has two domains, a C-terminal prenyltransferase domain which converts isoprene units into geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP) and an N-terminal terpene cyclase domain where GGDP gets cyclized and turns into fusicocca-2,10(14)-diene. It is also reported in this study that a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase-like gene, a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase-like gene, a short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase-like gene, and an Œ±-mannosidase-like gene at the 3‚Äô location downstream of PaFS which are responsible for converting fusicocca-2,10(14)-diene into fusicoccin.

He is best remembered for his self-penned song \\"Tequila\\", which he recorded with The Champs, and which reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Background Flores was born in Santa Paula, California and grew up in Long Beach. He was interested in the guitar from an early age, first performing at church and family gatherings. At 14, however, Flores switched to the saxophone, forming his first band, the 3-D Ranch Boys. Emulating the rasping sounds of tenor saxophonist Vido Musso, Flores played a variety of music genres -- jazz, country, pop, and blues‚Äîto cater to his hard-going blue-collar clientele. Much to Flores's amusement, he has remarked, during this early stage of his career, he was commonly called the \\"Mexican Hillbilly\\". In the early 1950s, Flores recorded vocals for small Pasadena-based record labels, before signing to Modern Records/RPM Records, and releasing his earliest rock and roll material. In 1957, Flores met aspiring songwriter and guitarist Dave Burgess. After briefly performing as Danny and Dave, the duo recruited former members of Flores's group, drummer Gene Alden and guitarist Buddy Bruce, along with bassist Cliff Hills and Vocalist Huelyn Duvall, who were session musicians, to form the Champs. On December 23, 1957, the group recorded three songs for Challenge Records, including Flores's instrumental Tequila. The song is highlighted by Flores's \\"dirty sax\\" arrangements and hollering of \\"Tequila\\". However, because of this one spoken phrase by Flores, he was credited as Chuck Rio to avoid conflicts with his other record label, where he was signed as a vocalist. \\"Tequila\\" was released as the B-side to the Champs' debut single, but after listeners requested the song over its A-side \\"Train to Nowhere\\", \\"Tequila\\" propelled to number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in January 1958. Conflicts between Flores and Burgess over leadership and the band's musical direction led to Flores's departure. He signed his rights away to Tequila, and ultimately did not receive any royalties from the tune, despite its success. In the intervening years, he formed another group called the Original Champs and recorded for Saturn Records in 1963. Flores continued to perform across California for the rest of his life.

They play their games at the Red Hall ('). The club's greatest achievements were four republic championship titles (1972‚Äì73, 1980‚Äì81, 1984‚Äì85 and 1988‚Äì89) in Yugoslavia. Since the Slovenian independence, the club has won three league titles (2008‚Äì09, 2011‚Äì12 and 2012‚Äì13), and two Slovenian handball cup titles (2002‚Äì03 and 2018‚Äì19). The club also participated in the EHF competitions for many seasons, including the EHF Cup, the EHF Cup Winners' Cup, and the EHF Champions League. As of the 2020‚Äì21 season, Gorenje competes in the Slovenian First League. Together with Celje, they are the only club that have participated in every season of the Slovenian First League since its formation in 1991. The club was known as RK ≈†o≈°tanj and ≈†RK Velenje in the past. History 1958‚Äì1972: Beginning of handball in ≈†o≈°tanj In 1958, when section of handball was established at TVD Partizan, organized handball started to develop in the town of ≈†o≈°tanj. Handball was pioneered by young men in local schools with the help of some basketball players. The first pioneers were Miligoj Jarnoviƒç, Pavle Bukovac, and Jo≈æe Pukmajster. In the beginning, the club participated in the Celje regional league. In 1964‚Äì65, they qualified to the Styrian regional league and a year later, ≈†o≈°tanj achieved its biggest success and qualified to the Yugoslavian republic league and were never relegated. In the 1970s, team handball developed and was top event in the region, on average match there were about 1,000 spectators. 1973‚Äì1982 15 years after the club was established it became Republic Champions, after finishing first in Slovenian republic league of Yugoslavia in the 1972‚Äì73 season. Competing in the II. Yugoslavian handball league (they qualified through the republic league) was a great honor and commitment to hard work. But the team dropped out of the II. Yugoslavian league and returned to the republic league after just one season, possibly due to lack of experience, resources and other factors. 1983‚Äì1991 After playing in the interrepublic league from 1981 to 1984, team handball players from ≈†o≈°tanj qualified, for the first time since the 1973‚Äì74, to the II. Yugoslavian handball league. Although they had some financial and HR problems (they replaced 3 coaches), the team from ≈†o≈°tanj finished 5th in 1990. Although the name RK ≈†o≈°tanj was known across Slovenia and former Yugoslavia, the club decided to change their name to ≈†RK Velenje (≈†ale≈°ki Rokometni Klub Velenje). This was because all games in previous years were played in Velenje at the Red Hall and because most of the players were locals from Velenje. In that season, ≈†RK Velenje finished third. The first two places lead to qualifications to the First Yugoslav League, and in their last match they lost that qualifying position. This has been called the biggest accomplishment in 30 years of the club's history. 1992‚Äì2002 After their most successful season, when the club was at the near top of the Second Yugoslav League, Slovenia declared its independence. In the 1991‚Äì92 season, handball clubs of the newly established country played their own championship. As a result, competing in the European Handball Federation (EHF) competitions became possible. In their first season, Gorenje performed below expectations and finished fifth. After the main part of the competition in the 1993‚Äì94 season, Gorenje finished in third place. In the play-offs they won against RK Prevent and then RK Drava Ptuj in the finals; RK Celje was a better opponent twice, however, as the runners-up of the league, Gorenje qualified to the EHF competitions, where they reached the semi-finals of the EHF Cup.  2002‚Äì2003  The 2002‚Äì03 season was historic in many ways for Gorenje. The club was at the top of the Slovenian handball competitions all these years and had some respectable achievements in Europe, but the team from Velenje never made it quite to the top in either competition. But in the Slovenian cup finals, RK Gorenje Velenje won against Prule 67 and claimed their first title in Slovenia since its independence in 1991. This success was a turning point for the club, because it had finally secured its position in Slovenia and in Europe. The President of RK Gorenje, Franc Plaskan retired, and was replaced by Janez ≈Ωivko. 2003‚Äì2004 2003‚Äì04 was yet another successful season for Gorenje. Top performance and great play-offs in the EHF Cup Winners' Cup, where they won twice with minimum advantage, didn't disappoint the ambitious club or its supporters. Despite losses in the national championship, they reached the semi-finals in the Cup Winners' Cup. Their first match resulted in a narrow loss to Valladolid. However, in the Slovenian playoffs of the 1. A league Slovenian First League of Handball, they made it to the finals with injuries and a downsized team. During this match, they were finally defeated by Celje. 2004‚Äì2005 Gorenje was paying the tax on injuries, which was a side effect of premier season in the Champions League. After some lost matches, they entered the playoffs in third position. But they had no match in playoffs and went straight to the finals. This was a historic finals again. The match against Celje ended only after four add-ons and shooting 7m throws. Celje won by 51‚Äì48. In the second match they were simply better.

In a domestic championship, the team was placed second after the regular part of the season, but finished the season in third place after defeats against RK Trimo Trebnje, RK Koper and RK Gold Club. After two years in the EHF Champions League they returned to the EHF Cup Winners' Cup. 2007‚Äì2009 Between 2006 and 2009 some major changes were made at RK Gorenje Velenje. In 2007, Gorenje hired a new promising coach, Ivica Obrvan, with a four-year contract and mission to bring home the first championship title before club's forthcoming 50th anniversary. That year they finished second.http://infostatx.rokometna-zveza.si/scripts/RZS/bilten.asp In the following season, they slipped to third place, with Koper in second and Celje claiming the title again. However, the season that will go down to history was 2008‚Äì09, on club's 50th anniversary, when Gorenje won their first title in independent Slovenia. They joined the exclusive club of just three handball clubs that managed this in a brief history since 1991 to 2009. In addition, Gorenje reached the finals in the EHF Cup, where they lost to Gumbersbach. 2009‚Äì2010 In the 2009‚Äì10 season, Gorenje finished in second place in the Slovenian First League of Handball,http://www.rk- gorenje.com/si/klub/119 just one point behind the league winners Celje. The team from Velenje also participated for the fourth time in the EHF Champions league during the season. After qualifying to the European Top 16, they were defeated by Spanish side BM Ciudad Real. Koper in 2013 2010‚Äì2011 After 19 victories in a row during the regular part of the Slovenian First League of Handball, Gorenje was leading by five points with ten rounds to go. However, things went downhill from there and the team's season rivals, Koper, caught up and won the title. Through the season, Gorenje and Koper played three matches. Gorenje won the first match (27‚Äì24) and Koper won the other two (28‚Äì25 and 26‚Äì21). That meant that Gorenje had to win the fourth and final match with a minimum of five goals difference in order to win the championship. The last match of the season was then played in Velenje, where Koper won 34‚Äì23. The team also competed in the EHF Cup as well where Frisch Auf G√∂ppingen knocked them out in the quarter-finals. The German team won the first match 33‚Äì20, even though Gorenje won the second match 26‚Äì22.

Life Al-Walid was born in Mecca to father Uqba ibn Abi Mu'ayt of the Banu Umayya clan and mother Arwa bint Kurayz of the Banu Rabi'a.Bosworth 2002, p. 130. Both of his parents belonged to clans from the Banu Abd Shams branch of the Quraysh tribe, which dominated Mecca. He was also a maternal half-brother of Uthman ibn Affan, a member of the Banu Umayya who went on to become caliph in 644. Like most Meccans at the time, his family was polytheistic and opposed Muhammad. His father died fighting against the latter at the Battle of Badr in 624. However, al-Walid converted to Islam after the Muslim conquest of Mecca in 630. He was charged by Muhammad with collecting the sadaqat (charitable tribute) from an Arab tribe known as the Banu Mustaliq. During the rule of Caliph Umar (r. 634‚Äì644), al-Walid was charged with collecting the sadaqat from the Banu Taghlib tribe in Upper Mesopotamia. His uterine brother, Uthman, appointed him governor of Kufa in 645/46, but his behavior and wine consumption riled the pious Muslims of that city, compelling Uthman to recall him in 649/50. He fled to Upper Mesopotamia following Uthman's assassination in 656 and died in al-Raqqa in 680. His son Aban served as governor of Homs under Caliph Abd al-Malik.

Life Meyer Kupferman was born in New York City to Jewish parents.Meyer Kupferman at the Milken Archive of Jewish Music; accessed January 9, 2014 A self-taught composer, Kupferman first gained attention in the late 1940s when his early opera \\"In A Garden\\" was premiered at the Tanglewood and Edinburgh Festivals. From 1951 to 1993 he was on the faculty of Sarah Lawrence College. He also served as Chairman of the Music Department for five terms. Kupferman began music at the age of five on violin. As an adult he claimed little memory of his violin instruction, but at age 10 he began to play the clarinet. He taught himself piano and studied music theory at The High School of Music & Art in New York City, subsequently attending Queens College in New York. As a young man Kupferman played jazz in bars and clubs on Coney Island, and arranged for big bands. In 1951 he was hired as Professor of Composition and Chamber Music at Sarah Lawrence College, a position he held until 1994. In the 1950s he began to experiment with twelve-tone row techniques, and in 1961 devised his \\"Infinities Row,\\" consisting of the group of notes of G‚ÄìF‚ÄìA‚ÄìB‚ÄìB‚ÄìD‚ÄìF‚ÄìE‚ÄìC‚ÄìE‚ÄìA‚ÄìC, which would become the only tone row he used subsequently in his major works. In 1990 he published Atonal Jazz. Much of Kupferman's music contains large gestures and short dramatic hooks which are a critical to his compositional technique (his \\"gestalt form\\"). His works are eclectic syntheses of disparate elements. Their extremes of contrast, and outrageousness were reflections of his personal life. Kupferman resided in Rhinebeck, New York, where he and his wife Pei-Fen welcomed members of the community. On the day before Thanksgiving, November 26, 2003, he died of heart failure.

The Canary Islands have been known since antiquity. Until the Spanish colonization between 1402 and 1496, the Canaries were populated by an indigenous population, whose origin is still the subject of discussion among historians and linguists. The islands were visited by the Phoenicians, the Greeks and the Carthaginians. According to the 1st century CE Roman author and philosopher Pliny the Elder, the archipelago was found to be uninhabited when visited by the Carthaginians under Hanno the Navigator in 5th century BCE, but ruins of great buildings were seen. This story may suggest that the islands were inhabited by other peoples prior to the Guanches. At the time of medieval European engagement, the Canary Islands were inhabited by a variety of indigenous communities. The pre-colonial population of the Canaries is generically referred to as Guanches, although, strictly speaking, Guanches were originally the inhabitants of Tenerife. According to the chronicles, the inhabitants of Fuerteventura and Lanzarote were referred to as Maxos, Gran Canaria was inhabited by the Canarii, El Hierro by the Bimbaches, La Palma by the Auaritas and La Gomera by the Gomeros. Evidence does seem to suggest that inter-insular interaction was relatively low and each island was populated by its own distinct socio-cultural groups who lived in relative isolation separated from each other. Historical background The origins of the Canarian indigenous people remain the subject of debate. Numerous theories have achieved varying degrees of acceptance. Various Mediterranean civilizations in antiquity knew of the islands' existence and established contact with them. Visitors included Phoenicians, Greeks and Carthaginians. According to Pliny the Elder, an expedition of Mauretanians sent by King Juba II (d. 23 CE) to the archipelago visited the islands, finding them uninhabited, but noting ruins of great buildings. When King Juba, the Roman proteg√©, dispatched a contingent to re-open the dye production facility at Mogador (historical name of Essaouira, Morocco) in the early 1st century,C.Michael Hogan, Chellah, The Megalithic Portal, ed. Andy Burnham Juba's naval force was subsequently sent on an exploration of the Canary Islands, using Mogador as their mission base. The peak of Teide on Tenerife can be seen on clear days from the African coast. The Carthaginian captain Hanno the Navigator may have visited the islands during his voyage of exploration along the African coast. The Phoenicians may have arrived seeking the precious red dye extracted from the orchil ‚Äì if the Canaries represent Pliny the Elder's Purple Isles or the Hesperides of legend. Although no evidence has survived of any permanent Roman settlements, in 1964 Roman amphorae were discovered in waters off Lanzarote. Discoveries made in the 1990s have demonstrated in more definite detail that the Romans traded with the indigenous inhabitants. Excavations of a settlement at El Bebedero on Lanzarote, made by a team under Pablo Atoche Pe√±a of the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and Juan √Ångel Paz Peralta of the University of Zaragoza, yielded about a hundred Roman potsherds, nine pieces of metal and one piece of glass at the site, in strata dated between the 1st and 4th centuries. Analysis of the clay indicated origins in Campania, Hispania Baetica and the province of Africa (modern Tunisia). The Romans named each of the islands: Ninguaria or Nivaria (Tenerife), Canaria (Gran Canaria), Pluvialia or Invale (Lanzarote), Ombrion (La Palma), Planasia (Fuerteventura), Iunonia or Junonia (El Hierro) and Capraria (La Gomera). From the 14th century onward, sailors from Mallorca, Portugal and Genoa made numerous visits. Lancelotto Malocello settled on the island of Lanzarote in 1312. The Mayorcans established a mission with a bishop that lasted from 1350 to 1400. It is from this mission that the various paintings and statues of the Virgin Mary that are currently venerated in the island were preserved. European disembarkations of Genovese, Castilian and Portuguese missionaries and pirates on Canarian shores became relatively common and the prehispanic populations experienced a long and ongoing process of Westernisation before formal colonization took place. A variety of theories regarding the origins of pre-colonial Canarians explain them by the hypothesis of a more recent immigration. Some scholars (mainly from the University of La Laguna, in Tenerife) defend the theory that the Canarian populations are Punic-Phoenician in origin. Professor D. Juan √Ålvarez Delgado, on the other hand, argued that the Canaries remained uninhabited until 100 BCE, when Greek and Roman sailors began to explore the area. In the second half of the 1st century BCE, King Juba II of Numidia abandoned North African prisoners on the islands, who eventually became the pre-Hispanic Canarians. If the first inhabitants were abandoned prisoners, this explains, according to √Ålvarez Delgado, their lack of navigational acumen. Genetic analysis using mitochondrial DNA points to the Moroccan Berbers as the African population most closely related to the Guanches.  Archaeology  Archaeology suggests that the original settlers arrived by sea, importing domestic animals such as goats, sheep, pigs and dogs and cereals such as wheat, barley and lentils. They also brought with them a set of well- defined socio-cultural practices that seem to have originated and been in use for a long period of time elsewhere. Today, archaeological and ethnographic studies have led most scholars to accept the view that the pre-colonial population of the Canaries shared common origins with North African Berber tribes from the Atlas Mountains region who began to arrive in the Canaries by sea around 1000 BCE or earlier. However, there is no archaeological or historical evidence to prove that either the Berber tribes of the Atlas Mountains or the Canarian pre-colonial population had knowledge or made use of navigation techniques. The peak of Tenerife is visible from the African coast on the very clearest of days, but the currents around the islands tend to lead the boats southwest and west, past the archipelago and into the Atlantic Ocean. Most scholars would now agree that the earliest reliable dates related to permanent human occupation can be traced back to about 1000 BCE, but different absolute dating technologies such as carbon-14 and thermoluminescence have provided variable results. Inadequate methodologies and an insufficient number of absolute datings carried out throughout the archipelago have yielded inconsistencies and information gaps. Studies of precolonial Canarian society illustrate both agricultural and pastoral ways of life in the Canaries.cf. Diego Cuscoy 1963: 44; Gonz√°lez Ant√≥n & Tejera Gaspar 1990: 78. Population genetics  A 2003 genetics research article by Nicole Maca-Meyer et al. published in the European Journal of Human Genetics compared mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA, inherited matrilineally) from aboriginal Guanche (collected from Canarian archaeological sites) to mtDNA of today's Canarians and concluded that, \\"despite the continuous changes suffered by the population (Spanish colonisation, slave trade), aboriginal mtDNA lineages constitute a considerable proportion [42 ‚Äì 73%] of the Canarian gene pool. Although the Berbers are the most probable ancestors of the Guanches, it is deduced that important human movements [e.g., the Islamic-Arabic conquest of the Berbers] have reshaped Northwest Africa after the migratory wave to the Canary Islands\\" and the \\"results support, from a maternal perspective, the supposition that since the end of the 16th century, at least, two-thirds of the Canarian population had an indigenous substrate, as was previously inferred from historical and anthropological data.\\" mtDNA haplogroup U subclade U6b1 is Canarian-specific and is the most common mtDNA haplogroup found in aboriginal Guanche archaeological burial sites. Lineages of Y-DNA (inherited patrilineally) were analysed in a later study by Rosa Fregel and colleagues published in BMC Evolutionary Biology. Y-DNA was extracted from the same aboriginal Guanche samples used by Nicole Maca-Meyer et al., and compared to samples from 17th-18th century remains post-dating the Spanish conquest of the islands, and samples from the present population. They found Berber Y-chromosome lineages (E-M81, E-M78 and J-M267) prominent in the indigenous remains, confirming the North West African origin for the Guanches deduced Nicole Maca-Meyer et al. from mitochondrial DNA results. \\"However, in contrast with their female lineages, which have survived in the present-day population since the conquest with only a moderate decline, the male indigenous lineages have dropped constantly being substituted by European lineages.\\" They conclude that the European colonization of the Canary Islands changed the local gene- pool most dramatically in the male line. A Guanche sanctuary in the Garajonay National Park - La Gomera Island  Society  Although denied by certain scholars (cf. Abreu Galindo 1977: 297), specialisation of labour and a hierarchy system seem to have governed the social structures of the Canarian precolonial populations. In Tenerife the highest figure was known as the Mencey, although, by the time the first Spanish incursions in the Canaries took place, Tenerife had already been divided into nine menceyatos (i.e. separate regions of the island controlled by its own Mencey), namely Anaga, Tegueste, Tacoronte, Taoro, Icod, Daute, Adeje, Abona and G√ºimar. Despite the fact that all Menceys were independent and absolute owners of their territory within the island, it was the Mencey of Taoro who acted, according to the chronicles, as primus inter pares. Gran Canaria, on the other hand, appears to have been divided into two guanartematos (i.e. functionally, politically and structurally differentiated regions): Telde and G√°ldar, each governed by a Guanarteme. Little information has survived regarding the religious and cosmological beliefs of the Guanches. Indigenous Canarian people often performed their religious practices in places marked by particular striking geographical features or types of vegetation. Certain sites containing architectonic remains and cave paintings have been identified as sanctuaries.

Signs and symptoms Toxic levels of chloramphenicol after 2‚Äì9 days result in: loss of appetite, vomiting, ashen gray color of the skin, Hypotension (low blood pressure), Cyanosis (blue discolouration of lips and skin), Hypothermia, Cardiovascular collapse, hypotonia, abdominal distension, irregular respiration and increased blood lactate. Pathophysiology Two pathophysiologic mechanisms are thought to play a role in the development of gray baby syndrome after exposure to the anti-microbial drug chloramphenicol. This condition is due to a lack of glucuronidation reactions occurring in the baby, thus leading to an accumulation of toxic chloramphenicol metabolites: # The UDP-glucuronyl transferase enzyme system of infants, especially premature infants, is immature and incapable of metabolizing the excessive drug load. # Insufficient renal excretion of the unconjugated drug. Insufficient metabolism and excretion of chloramphenicol leads to increased blood concentrations of the drug, causing blockade of the electron transport of the liver, myocardium, and skeletal muscles. Since the electron transport is an essential part of cellular respiration, its blockade can result in cell damage. In addition, the presence of chloramphenicol weakens the binding of bilirubin and albumin, so increased levels of the drug can lead to high levels of free bilirubin in the blood, resulting in brain damage or kernicterus. Diagnosis Gray baby syndrome should be suspected in a new born with abdominal distension, progressive pallid cyanosis, irregular respirations, and refusal to breastfeed. The cause of gray baby syndrome comes from the mother's use of an antibiotic, chloramphenicol, during pregnancy or breastfeeding. The presentation of symptoms can depend on the level of exposure of the drug to the baby. A broad diagnosis is usually needed for babies who present with cyanosis. Blood work is done to determine the level of serum chloramphenicol. Other tools used to help with diagnosis include CT scans, ultrasound, and electrocardiogram. Prevention The condition can be prevented by using chloramphenicol at the recommended doses and monitoring blood levels, or alternatively, third generation cephalosporins can be effectively substituted for the drug, without the associated toxicity. If maternal use of chloramphenicol cannot be avoided, close monitoring of the baby's symptoms such as feeding difficulties, and blood work is recommended. Treatment Chloramphenicol therapy should be stopped immediately. Exchange transfusion may be required to remove the drug. Sometimes, phenobarbital to induce UDP- glucuronyltransferase enzyme is used.

Sometimes the term \\"atom\\" is used, although in recent years the term \\"simple\\" has become the standard. Simples are to be contrasted with atomless gunk (where something is \\"gunky\\" if it is such that every proper part has a further proper part). Necessarily, given the definitions, everything is either composed of simples, gunk or a mixture of the two. Classical mereology is consistent with both the existence of gunk and either finite or infinite simples (see Hodges and Lewis 1968). The Simple Question Mirroring the special composition question is the Simple Question.Markosian 1998 It asks what the jointly necessary and sufficient conditions are for x to be a mereological simple. In the literature this question explicitly concerns what it is for a material object to lack proper parts, although there is no reason why similar questions cannot be asked of things from other ontological categories. There have been many suggested answers to the Simple Question. Answers include that x is a simple if and only it is a point-sized object; that x is a simple if and only if it is indivisible; or that x is a simple if and only if it is maximally continuous. Kris McDaniel has argued that what it is for an object to be a simple is a matter of brute fact, and that there is no non-trivial answer to the Simple Question (2007b). Extended simples Of those philosophers who believe the material world contains simples, there has recently been debate over whether there can be extended simples (see Braddon- Mitchell and Miller 2006, Hudson 2006, Markosian 1998, 2004, McDaniel 2007a, 2007b, McKinnon 2003, Parsons 2000, Sider 2006, Simons 2004 inter alia). An extended simple is (i) a material object; (ii) simple, and (iii) it occupies an extended region of space. Various reasons have been offered in favor of the claim that extended simples are possible, including: (a) that they are conceivable (Markosian 1998), (b) that purportedly plausible modal principles claiming, roughly, that there are no necessary connections between distinct existences entail their possibility (McDaniel 2007a, Saucedo 2009, Sider 2006), and (c) that contemporary physical theories entail that there are extended simples (Braddon-Mitchell and Miller 2006). One might also argue in favor of the possibility of extended simples by noting that their existence is consistent with the answer to the Simple Question one endorses. In the literature, however, the reasoning is often reversed: Those who think that extended simples are possible often use their purported possibility to argue against answers to the Simple Question that entail their impossibility and those who think that they are impossible uses their purported impossibility to argue against answers to the Simple Question that entail (or strongly suggest) their possibility. There have been arguments against extended simples. Arguments include variants on Lewis' argument from temporary intrinsics, as well as arguments that intuitively an extended object must have, for instance, a right half and a left half, and thus have parts (cf Zimmerman 1996: 10) Similarly, one who endorses the Doctrine of Arbitrarily Undetatched Parts, which states that necessarily, if an object occupies region R then every occupiable proper sub-region of R is exactly occupied by a proper part of that object (see van Inwagen 1981), might use that principle in an argument against the possibility of extended simples. If there are no extended simples, the only remaining options would material objects being made of unextended simples (objects that have a space-time extension of 0) or atomless gunk. Some philosophers seem to have held that the whole universe is one enormous extended simple. According to some interpretations of Descartes and Spinoza, for instance, they held this view. More recently, this view has been defended in Schaffer 2007. Non-material simples The use of 'simple' is not restricted to material objects. Anything, no matter what ontological category it is from, is a simple if and only if it has no proper parts. Thus Lewis has argued that singletons are simples (Lewis 1991) and spacetime points are often thought to be simples (although in some non-standard spacetimes, points have proper parts). Similarly, there is a question of whether things from other categories--for instance, fictional characters and properties, if there are such things--are simples. Furthermore, just as every material object may be made of atomless gunk rather than simples, so too for objects from other ontological categories. For instance, some have held that spacetime is gunky, claiming that every region of spacetime has a proper sub-region.

History Community Hospital was founded on August 6, 1956, at the corner of 16th Street and Ritter Avenue on the east side of Indianapolis. The hospital was the result of a massive fund-raising effort started out by volunteers who envisioned a hospital closer to the booming east side, instead of driving all the way downtown for health care. Volunteers began a house-to-house campaign, collecting loose pocket change. Soon funds poured in from businesses and civic organizations. The name \\"Community Hospital\\" was chosen by leaders because of the massive involvement of the neighbors and community of the east side to help build the hospital. Ground was broken in 1954 at a site donated by farmer Edward F. Gallahue. The ground-breaking ceremony was attended by then Vice President Richard Nixon. When opened, the $5 million hospital came complete with the novelty of air conditioning, piped in oxygen and had 300 beds and 111 employees. W.C. McLin guided the opening of Community Hospital as its first administrator. It wasn't long before the need for more space became apparent. In 1964, \\"The Towers\\" were opened. The building's radial design - with two circular towers allowing central nursing stations to observe patients at all times was one of the first of its kind in the nation. Throughout the next few years, Community underwent many expansions and upgrades, including the opening of psychiatric inpatient units, a coronary care unit, and specialized services including ambulatory care and a cardiac catheterization lab. In 1972, Allen Hicks was chosen to lead Community following the death of W.C. McLin in 1971. In 1974, Building 3 opened at Community, dedicated to W.C. McLin, adding 250 more beds. More additions included the Hook Rehabilitation Center, Gallahue Mental Health Center, pain and cancer centers, plus new surgery suites and education facilities. In 1981, a new laboratory opened, along with a medical office building. Community, at this time, was the second largest hospital in the city of Indianapolis with approximately 800 beds, and was considered one of the leading health-care facilities in the state. William E. Corley arrived at Community in 1985 as the CEO after Allen Hicks left in 1983. A new satellite hospital for Community was planned in 1982 on the north side of Indianapolis. What is now Community Hospital North opened in 1985 and has far out-grown its satellite status. Community Hospital was subsequently renamed Community Hospital East. The Same-Day Surgery Center opened at Community East in 1988 and a new main lobby, entrance and professional building opened in 1991. Community East marked the birth of its 100,000 baby in 1993. In 1996, Community East adopted the Family Rooms concept in the maternity unit. The unit features LDRP - labor, delivery, recovery, postpartum - rooms, allowing mothers and babies to remain in the same room throughout their stay. The Indiana Surgery Center opened on the Community East campus in 1999 and is part of the Community Health Network. It is an outpatient surgery center formed through the partnerships of a group of surgeons. In 2004, Community East opened the Center for Interventional Radiology, one of the first centers of its kind in the country and the only one in the Midwest. The hospital celebrated the opening of The Community Regional Cancer Care Radiation Oncology Treatment Center, a $7-million addition, in March 2007. In November 2007, Community East opened a medical oncology center. The Center for Joint Health, a specialized unit for joint replacement surgery patients, opened in July 2008. Community East celebrated its 50th anniversary in August 2006. On August 19, 2015, Community Hospital East, broke ground on a brand new Hospital. This $175 million investment is a new commitment to the neighborhood. The Project is expected to be completed in April 2020. Current status Community East is currently led by Robin Ledyard, M.D., who assumed her new role as president on August 31, 2009. She replaced Anita Harden, who retired in November 2008, and Steve Hultgren who had served as interim president after Harden's retirement. Bryan Mills is the president and CEO of the parent Community Health Network.

December 1641) was an English iron founder, soldier and politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1601 and 1622 when he inherited the Baron Bergavenny peerage. Life Nevill was the son of Edward Nevill, 8th Baron Bergavenny and his wife Rachel Lennard, daughter of John Lennard. He was educated at Queens' College, Cambridge in 1586 and was awarded BA in 1589. He was incorporated at Oxford University and awarded MA in 1594. Recusant He then travelled abroad and was at Venice in July 1594 where he was approached by English Catholics, presumably with the intention of involving him in one of the numerous conspiracies against Elizabeth I which were rife in that decade. Nevill conformed outwardly to the Church of England, but was generally believed to be a Roman Catholic at heart, a belief which could only have been strengthened by his second marriage to Catherine Vaux, who belonged to a notable recusant family.Fraser, Antonia The Gunpowder Plot- Terror and Faith in 1605 Weidenfeld & Nicolson, London 1996 p.270 Her mother, Elizabeth Vaux (n√©e Roper) sheltered Catholic priests at the family home at Harrowden Hall,Fraser p.100 and her brother Lord Vaux fled the country after being suspected of complicity in the Gunpowder Plot,;Kenyon, J.P The Popish Plot Phoenix Press reissue 2000 p.8 on his return to England in 1611 he was imprisoned for two years.Kenyon p.8 Later generations of the Nevill family openly professed the Catholic faith, and followed Henry's example in marrying into well-known recusant families like the Giffords and Chamberlains. Military and political career In 1596 he served at the Capture of Cadiz under Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex and was knighted. In June 1597 he was licensed to travel abroad for two years with his brother-in-law Thomas Sackville, son of Lord Buckhurst, later Earl of Dorset. Buckhurst and Nevill owned several iron foundries between them, and by December 1596 they had a patent which gave them a monopoly in the production of ordinance. History of Parliament Online - Neville, Henry In 1601 Nevill was elected Member of Parliament for Kent. He took no part in Essex's Rebellion, though he was apparently invited to do so. During this parliament Nevill's patent was mentioned during an attack on monopolies. Nevill is mentioned sitting on a committee considering the Penal Laws on 2 November, somewhat ironically in view of his own well-known Catholic leanings. In 1604, he was elected MP for Lewes. In 1621 he was elected MP for Wilton and sat until 1622 when he succeeded to the Barony upon the death of his father. Nevill died in 1641. Family Nevill married firstly Lady Mary Sackville (d.

Established in 1932 as Yerid HaMizrach at the site of the Levant Fair, near the Tel Aviv Port, the fairgrounds moved to their present location at 101 Rokach Boulevard (near the Yarkon Park and Tel Aviv University) in 1959. The site is directly accessible from the Ayalon Highway, Tel Aviv‚Äôs main transportation artery, as well as from the Tel Aviv University railway station. Expo Tel Aviv hosts up to 2.5 million visitors and between 45 and 60 major events annually. The fairground has ten halls and pavilions and a large outdoor space including an amusement park known as the Luna Park. Nearby is the Drive in Arena which was built on the grounds of what was once Israel's only drive-in theater. Between 14 and 18 May, the fairground hosted the 2019 Eurovision Song Contest. The venue has been renamed Expo Tel Aviv (International Convention Center).  History Aerial view of the Levant Fair in the 1930s Tel Aviv round pavilion, built in 1959 and demolished in 2010 The Levant Fair was an international fair site next to the Tel Aviv Port established in 1933 to showcase the accomplishments of the pre-state Jewish community in the sphere of industry. After the success of the first fair, permanent structures were built on a plot of land at the northern end of Dizengoff street on the banks of the Yarkon River. Fairs were held in 1934 and 1936 with pavilions and halls constructed for the participating countries. The chief architect was Aryeh Elhanani. A flying camel became the official logo. Richard Kauffmann planned the pavilion layout. Other leading architects were Arieh Sharon and Joseph Neufeld. The pavilions were designed in the International Style. In 1959, the fairgrounds were moved to their present location on Rokach Boulevard, and the new site was inaugurated with an exhibition marking Tel Aviv's 50th Jubilee. In 1983, the convention center opened within the fairgrounds and at the end of 2003 the \\"Pavilion No. 1\\" was opened. It has 20,000 m¬≤ of exhibition space and is the largest object of its kind in Israel and in the Eastern Mediterranean. In 2010, the \\"round pavilion\\" in the fairground was demolished. In its place began the construction of a new 10,000-seat congress and convention center called \\"Bitan 2\\" (Pavilion 2), which was inaugurated in January 2015. The new pavilion hosted the 2018 European Judo Championships from 26‚Äì28 April. Entertainment Expo Tel Aviv, 2018 In recent years, the center has been used for many musical concerts and shows. On 13 September 2018, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) & Israeli broadcaster Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation (KAN) announced that the center would host the Eurovision Song Contest 2019. The semi-finals were held on 14 and 16 May 2019, with the final taking place on 18 May 2019. The IPBC expected Pavilion 2 to have room for up to 9,000 attendees.

Early life and medical training Moore was born in Bloomington, Indiana. He attended Indiana University and graduated in 1845. He had graduated from the Medical College of Ohio in Cincinnati in 1844.MCO is the second oldest medical school west of the Allegheny Mountains. It was founded in 1819, the date that the modern University of Cincinnati uses as its date of origin. He scored first place in the internship examination at the Commercial Hospital and Lunatic Asylum of Ohio (chartered in 1821), the hospital whose attending physicians were members of the MCO faculty. He served during 1845‚Äì46, and then filled in when another intern had to leave the following mid-year. He took further medical courses at the University of Louisville Medical Department in 1848‚Äì49 and at the medical department of the University of the City of New York in 1849‚Äì50, graduating later that same year. After one-year internship in Bellevue Hospital and two years with the New York Dispensary, Moore entered the Army as assistant surgeon in 1853. He served in Fort Myers, Florida, and then in a fort in Boston Harbor before going to the Utah Territory frontier as a surgeon during the Utah War in 1857. He was promoted to the rank of captain in 1858. Civil War When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Dr. Moore was attached to the Cincinnati Marine Hospital, which became the Military Hospital of Cincinnati, that was opened in May 1861. He was promoted to surgeon in 1862. In Cincinnati, he was assigned to previously unstable hospital situations. Then he was assigned to the Army of the Potomac and served as divisional chief surgeon at the battles of Antietam and Fredericksburg. He was promoted to Medical Director of the V Corps and served in that role at the Battle of Chancellorsville. In June 1863 he became Medical Director of the Army of the Tennessee and later accompanied Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman on his famous \\"March to the Sea\\" and through the Carolinas. In 1865 he received the brevet rank of colonel and was mustered out of the volunteer army with the close of the war. Postbellum career Dr. Moore stayed in the regular army following the Civil War and served in a variety of medical posts, spending over a decade on assignment in New York City. In 1883 he was made Assistant Medical Purveyor with the rank of colonel. In 1886, he succeeded Robert Murray as Surgeon General and was promoted to brigadier general.

Informant In May 1988, Bagga accused Secretary of State for External Affairs Joe Clark of interfering with his claim for refugee status to placate the Indian government. Despite the RCMP protection provided, and history of activism with Babbar Khalsa, Bagga did not testify in the 2004/2005 Air India bombing trial.. Babbar Khalsa was suspected of involvement in the Air India bombings, and two of its members, Ajaib Singh Bagri and Ripudaman Singh Malik were charged and put on trial. They were cleared largely due to the lack of credible witnesses. Tara Singh Hayer, a vocal critic of the Babbar Khalsa who had been on the Air India witness list, identified Bagga as a source of disputed information in several of his stories at the time. When Bagga denied the allegations, Hayer put taperecorded copies of the interviews on sale in Punjabi stores. In August 1988, Bagga's 17-year-old son shot and paralyzed Hayer at his newspaper office, and was sentenced to 14 years imprisonment.

Three years after principal photography, and after the film's owner, Warner Independent Pictures, was shut down by its parent company, it was released direct-to-video in 2009. Plot The film begins with Gayle, Becky and Judi performing in McCormick State College's Senior Talent Show in 1992. The three of them were the 'losers' and geeks in college but were always hopeful about their future. The next scene then jumps to 15 years later. Gayle is now a guide dog trainer for the visually handicapped. She asks her client out on a date but gets rejected after he touches her face. Becky is an office manager for Senator Hartmann. Judi and her fiance, William, go for relationship counseling and insist that there are no secrets between them. Becky returns home only to find her cat, Honey, dead. The three of them hold their usual 'make your own pizza party' and play their usual 'movie game'. They decide to go on a trip to Tempe, Arizona to the Wimmin's Music Festival. Senator Hartmann announces to her team that she is the potential next vice president. In order to ensure success, she has to make sure that she has a good reputation and background. Ashley, her daughter, just broke up with her boyfriend because she is not slutty enough. In order to win him back and not disappoint her mother, she decides that she will be going to South Padre for her spring break. She wants her to think that she is 'just like her mother was back in the days' - the most popular girl in her sorority and 'always up for a good time'. In order to make sure that Ashley does not act out, Senator Hartmann sends Becky to go to South Padre to keep an eye on her. Throughout the trip, Gayle becomes very close to a group of girls called The Sevens who are Ashley's nemesis. Judi returns home and discovers that William is actually gay and he ends up breaking off with her. Judi meets up with Becky and Gayle and the three of them decide to go to South Padre to relive the college days that they never had. Even though the girls are appalled with the state of the place, Gayle and Judi fit into the crowd easily. They spend the next few days getting wasted while Becky keeps to the main reason of her being there. Gayle and Judi eventually persuade Becky into relaxing. One night at a foam party, Ashley finds out that Becky was actually sent by her mother and feels betrayed because she thought they were friends. They engage in a cat fight and end up in jail. That night, William goes to find Judi and asks for a second chance. Then Judi bails Becky and Ashley out of jail. She announces to everyone that she is going to marry William. Gayle declares that she's going to be in the All Girl Talent Show with The Sevens because she is finally going to win. This leads to an argument, and Judi leaves to get married, while Becky and Gayle prepare separately for the talent contest. At the airport, Judi finally admits to herself that William is gay and tells him she can't marry him. Gayle falls out with Mason, the leader of The Sevens, just before they go on stage. Senator Hartmann appears backstage and wants to bring Ashley back home by force. They have a confrontation and Ashley begs her mother to let her compete in the show, and her mother relents. As the group begins to perform, the pianist passes out (drunk) and Judi returns just in time to replace her. They perform, with begrudged success. The film ends with the three of them back home, at their usual 'make your own pizza party' playing their usual 'movie game'.

The score to Spring Breakdown was composed by Deborah Lurie who recorded her score with the Hollywood Studio Symphony conducted by Blake Neely and recorded by Greg Dennen at the Eastwood Scoring Stage at Warner Brothers. In April 2008, co-star Missi Pyle believed the box-office performance of Baby Mama would determine whether Warner Bros. released this film theatrically. The film was screened at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2009 as part of Park City at Midnight before going direct-to-video. Reception Sundance called Spring Breakdown an \\"outlandish, quick-witted romp that jubilantly leaves none immune to ridicule\\" and a film that \\"chews up our geeky gals and spits them out triumphant powerhouses‚Äîconfident that being who they truly are is way cooler than fitting in.\\" Variety magazine called the film \\"energetic but uninspired\\" with a \\"party-boatload of comedic talent [that] is fairly wasted\\" and notes: > There are funny lines scattered about, and the pacey pic has an aptly cheesy > look dominated by the neon hues of tropical drinks and thong wear. But the > situations offer no real satiric finesse on familiar genre tropes -- wet > T-shirt contest, drunken puke-outs, a climactic talent show triumph -- and > the rote girl-power message rings unironically hollow. Ray Greene of Boxoffice magazine, after seeing the film at Sundance, gave the film no stars, saying \\"The annual Sundance ‚ÄúWhat the f---‚Äù moment has arrived in the form of Spring Breakdown, a very bad genre exercise starring some very good comedic actresses.\\" References External links  Category:2009 films Category:2009 comedy films Category:2009 direct-to-video films Category:American films Category:American comedy films Category:American direct-to-video films Category:English-language films Category:Films scored by Deborah Lurie Category:Films set in Texas Category:Warner Bros. direct-to- video films ","title":"Spring Breakdown"},{"id":"7128774","text":"Northwest Missouri Regional Airport is a city-owned public use airport located two nautical miles (3.7 km) west of the central business district of Maryville, a city in Nodaway County, Missouri, United States.

Jenkins was a coal miner's agent who studied at the Sorbonne in Paris and at Ruskin College, Oxford, before becoming Vice- President of the South Wales Miners Federation. At the 1935 general election he was elected to the House of Commons as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Pontypool, replacing former Labour minister Thomas Griffiths. He held the seat until his death in 1946 at the age of 64. Arthur was born at Farteg, Abersychan, Monmouthshire son of Thomas Jenkins and wife, Eliza Perry. He left school aged 12 to work down the pit at Viponds. It was there he became actively engaged on district trades and labour council with trade union business. He attended night school, learning enough to gain a scholarship from the Eastern Valley Miners educational group to go to Ruskin College. He remained a member of the NUM all his life. In 1909 he went on strike over the dismissal of militant Marxist teacher Dennis Hird. Partly in disgust at the way socialists were treated in higher education, he transferred to the Central Labour College, and from there to the campus in London. He had not completed his studies at Ruskin when he left for Paris. In 1910 Jenkins returned to the valleys to work as a miner and teach evening classes in the mining village of Garndiffaith. On 2 October 1911, Arthur Jenkins married Hattie Harris (1886-1953), the daughter of a local steelworks manager from Blaenafon. She worked in a Pontypool music shop. Their son Roy Jenkins (1920‚Äì2003) was a Labour, SDP, and Liberal Democrat politician, serving as Home Secretary, Chancellor of the Exchequer and President of the European Commission and as Liberal Democrat leader in the House of Lords. Jenkins quickly became very active in local politics serving the Labour party on Monmouthshire county council. But he was also a strongly militant socialist agitating for rapid and violent change. During the General Strike of 1926 he was arrested on disputed charges, hauled before the magistrate, and sent to prison for nine months. This did not prevent him from returning to the National Executive Committee. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s he continued to promote the sectional interests of miners and the Labour movement. He was elected to represent MacDonald's Labour Party at the 1935 General Election in one of the party's safest seats. By July 1945 his share of the vote had risen to 77%. With the rise of totalitarian dictatorships during 1930s his interests spread from coal and unemployed miners to poverty more generally and education, through to foreign affairs. Rearmament and the threat of global conflict attracted the attention of Clement Attlee in 1937 for whom he worked as PPS. Arthur Jenkins and the Indemnity Act 1941 During the war Jenkins worked on industrial tribunals for the Royal Ordnance Factory, Glascoed, for which he needed legal dispensation from parliamentary privilege because he was an MP. He accepted the chairmanship of a local appeals board created under the Essential Work (General Provisions) Order 1941 for a Royal Ordnance Factory, ROF Glascoed. The role entitled him to a small payment per sitting, which, however, he did not accept. Nevertheless, the position was deemed to be an office for profit under the Crown, therefore leading to Jenkins vacating his seat in Parliament. Although the House of Commons Disqualification (Temporary Provisions) Act 1941 had been brought in to remedy such situations, it applied to MPs who had accepted offices of profit between the start of the war and the passing of that act. Jenkins took up the chairmanship of the appeals board after the act was passed. The Temporary Provisions Act also permitted the Prime Minister to issue a certificate to an MP to permit them to take up an office for profit without losing his or her seat. Unfortunately Jenkins had not done so before taking the chairmanship, and was thus no longer an MP.\\"...it does seem hard and unnecessary that he should be pilloried by losing his seat and incurring penalties,\\" remarked Sir William Davison, a Conservative MP. The Indemnity Act therefore operated to restore Jenkins to his seat in the Commons. In March 1945 Jenkins was appointed Parliamentary Under Secretary to the Ministry of Town and Country Planning. Suffering from illness he was forced to retire from the Attlee government in October 1945 before being able to assume his rightful position in the cabinet. He died at St Thomas Hospital, London on 25 April 1946.

In 1989, Chris Blackwell sold Island Records to Polygram, which resulted in a remarketing of the Island back catalogue on compact disc under the Island Masters brand.

Singles of the 1960s  The first Island \\"white and red\\" label was used mainly for Jamaican productions released in the United Kingdom. Catalogue numbers started at WI-001. Many of these records had been released previously in Jamaica and other territories on small local labels. For a variety of reasons details of the artists and songs printed on the labels do not always match what is actually to be found in the grooves of the record! The main Island label was soon joined by another three labels: Sue for black American music with catalogue numbers starting at WI-300, Black Swan for more Jamaican music starting with WI-400, and Jump Up, for Calypso and Trinidadian music, starting with 500, but using another prefix (JU). The Aladdin label was started in about 1965 and used numbers starting with 600, using the WI prefix.  Island (white and red label)  Island singles were released with prefix WI and numbers starting with 001. The Island label itself was white with red lettering and logotypes - for the first 100 releases it had a round \\"Flaming sun\\" logo on a white label, then and for reprints of the early issues a red strip across the centre of the label like a \\"bow tie\\". The labels have the Rutland Gate Mews address on all first pressings up until about number 14; this was followed by the London England address which goes up to at least # 47, then came Cambridge Road.

The releases followed the catalogue numbers of Island's singles starting at number 300. The first 17 releases of the British Sue label were in fact related to Henry 'Juggy' Murray's New York based Sue label. Some earlier issues from the black-owned independent American label established in 1957 were released on the London American label. The original Island agreement with the American company ended in disagreement and all (U.S.) Sue records were deleted from their catalogue in July 1965, and American Sue issues returned to the London American label. Island records retained the use of the name Sue until the final release in 1968. *WI 301 - Inez Foxx: \\"Mockingbird\\" / \\"He's The One You Love\\" *WI 308 - Derak Martin: \\"Don't Put Me Down Like This\\" *WI 309 - Ernestine Anderson: \\"Keep An Eye On Love\\" *WI 312 - The Soul Sisters: \\"I Can't Stand It\\" *WI 323 - Inez Foxx: \\"Hurt by Love\\" (UK #40, July 1964) *WI 335 - Elmore James: \\"Dust My Blues\\" *WI 337 - Louisiana Red: \\"I Done Woke Up\\" *WI 339 - J.B.

Island reactivated the label in 1976/1977 within the WIP series and with a small series of 12\\" singles in a BS series. *WI 401 - Laurel Aitken: \\"Lion Of Judah\\" b/w \\"Remember My Darling\\" (b-side with Cynthia Richards), 1963 *WI 402 -

The \\"P\\" in WIP is variously said to stand for \\"Progressive\\" or \\"Pop\\" and reflects the fact that this new series was geared towards the new generation of rock/pop acts that Island had begun to accumulate from early 1967 onwards, as well as artists from its traditional roster who were being oriented towards the rock/pop audience, such as Jackie Edwards and Jimmy Cliff. Another change was that releases in the WIP series were normally stereo productions. Major UK top twenty singles' chart success for the label came very early in the WIP series, with WIP-6002 - Traffic's \\"Paper Sun\\" (#5, 6/1967), a classic slice of British psychedelia released just in time for the \\"summer of love\\", but quite a high proportion of the early WIP-series output was by artists who failed to develop as anticipated (e.g. Hard Meat, The Smoke) or represented one-off licensing deals with artists who never again appeared in the Island listings (e.g. WIP-6001, WIP-6013, etc.). The series continued throughout the 1970s and into the early 1980s (see below). The first of a series of pink label designs was used for singles WIP-6000 to WIP-6051, inclusive. Sometimes referred to as the \\"eye\\" label design, it featured an orange and black elliptical device on the left-hand side of the label which could be said to resemble a grotesque eyeball when viewed sideways. \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" sides were clearly delineated on this early series of pink label singles, thus: WIP-6050-A (Traffic's \\"Medicated Goo\\") and WIP-6050-B (the same band's \\"Shanghai Noodle Factory\\"). Beginning with WIP-6052, a new series of matrix numbers was introduced for 7\\" singles. Henceforward, singles' sides were not usually identified as \\"A\\" or \\"B\\", but each bore a unique matrix number in a series starting at wipx 1002.It seems probable that the series was intended to start at wipx 1000 and to apply to the previous release, WIP-6051. However, label scans of WIP-6051 show that the matric numbers did not appear on the face of the labels; it would, however, be interesting to know what matrix numbers were stamped or scratched into the run-out grooves of the record. The matrix number appeared on the label, usually upside-down directly beneath the main catalogue number. The matrix numbers seem to have been allocated to each release in numerical sequence, irrespective of the actual or proposed release date of the record; thus the two sides of WIP-6056 (Jethro Tull's \\"Living In The Past\\" b/w \\"Driving Song\\") have matrix numbers wipx 1010 and wipx 1011, respectively. Initially, the new matrix numbers were used in conjunction with the existing \\"eye\\" label design, but beginning with releases in June 1969 a new pink label design was introduced, known as the \\"block\\" design. The new design continued to feature the \\"eye\\" device in plain black enclosed within the push-out centre of the record, but the company name was now written in capital letters within a rectangular black block in the lower part of the label. The first release to feature the new label design appears to have been WIP-6060 and the last to feature the orange-and-black \\"eye\\" design WIP-6061, a reissue of \\"Incense\\" by the Anglos, which had actually been released the previous month. One or two earlier releases which were evidently still selling were re-pressed with the new design (e.g. WIP-6056, which exists with both the orange-and-black \\"eye\\" and the \\"block\\" label designs). Towards the end of 1969, artists signed to Terry Ellis and Chris Wright's Chrysalis management company began to be favoured with a special Chrysalis label design - green with a red Chrysalis butterfly logo. Initially this applied to Jethro Tull and former Tull guitarist Mick Abrahams' band Blodwyn Pig. These early Chrysalis singles were allotted catalogue and matrix numbers in the main Island WIP and wipx series, respectively, and bore the legend \\"manufactured and distributed by island records basing st london\\" on the upper circumference of the label. Chrysalis continued to issue singles bearing Island catalogue numbers until Autumn 1971, after which the label broke away completely and began its own series of catalogue numbers in a CHS 2000 series. *WIP-6000 - Owen Gray: \\"Help Me\\" b/w \\"Incense\\", 14/1/1967 *WIP-6001 - Rene & Rene: \\"Loving You Could Hurt Me So Much\\" b/w \\"Little Diamonds\\", 14/1/1967 *WIP-6002 - Traffic: \\"Paper Sun\\" b/w \\"Giving to You\\", 5/1967 (UK #5, June 1967) *WIP-6003 - Ray Cameron: \\"Doing My Time\\" b/w \\"Getaway, Getaway Car\\", 1/1967 *WIP-6004 - Jimmy Cliff: \\"Give and Take\\" b/w \\"Aim And Ambition\\", 2/1967 *WIP-6005 - The V.I.P.'s: \\"Straight Down To The Bottom\\" b/w \\"In A Dream\\", 2/1967 *WIP-6006 - Wynder K Frog: \\"Green Door\\" b/w \\"Dancing Frog\\", 2/1967 *WIP-6007 - Tim Tam and the Turn-Ons: \\"Wait A Minute\\" b/w \\"Ophelia\\", 4/1967 *WIP-6008 - Jackie Edwards: \\"Come Back Girl\\" b/w \\"Tell Him You Lied\\", 4/1967 *WIP-6009 - Julien Covey and the Machine: \\"A Little Bit Hurt\\" b/w \\"Sweet Bacon\\", 4/1967 *WIP-6010 - Joyce Bond: \\"Do The Teasy\\" b/w \\"Sugar\\", 4/1967 *WIP-6011 - Jimmy Cliff: \\"I Got A Feeling\\" b/w \\"Hard Road To Travel\\", 5/1967 *WIP-6012 - Jackie and Millie: \\"In a Dream\\" b/w \\"Ooh, Ooh\\", 6/1967 *WIP-6013 - The Bill Shepherd Sound: \\"Whistling Sailor\\" b/w \\"March of the Seven Seas\\", 1967 *WIP-6014 - Wynder K Frog: \\"I'm A Man\\" b/w \\"Shook Shimmy And Shake\\", 6/1967 *WIP-6016 - Nirvana: \\"Tiny Goddess\\" b/w \\"I Believe in Magic\\", 7/1967 *WIP-6017 - Traffic: \\"Hole in My Shoe\\" b/w \\"Smiling Phases\\", 8/1967 (early issues in picture sleeve; UK #2, September 1967) *WIP-6018 - Joyce Bond: \\"This Train\\" b/w \\"Not So With Me\\", 8/1967 *WIP-6019 - Art: \\"What's That Sound (For What It's Worth)\\" b/w \\"Rome Take Away Three\\", 7/1967 *WIP-6020 - Nirvana: \\"Pentecost Hotel\\" b/w \\"Feelin' Shattered\\", 9/1967 *WIP-6021 - Millie Small: \\"I Am In Love\\" b/w \\"You Better Forget\\", 10/1967 *WIP-6022 - Spooky Tooth: \\"Sunshine Help Me\\" b/w \\"Weird\\", 1/1968 *WIP-6023 - The Smoke: \\"It Could Be Wonderful\\" b/w \\"Have Some More Tea\\", 11/1967 *WIP-6024 - Jimmy Cliff: \\"That's The Way Life Goes\\" b/w \\"Thank You\\", 10/1967 *WIP-6025 - Traffic: \\"Here We Go Round The Mulberry Bush\\" b/w \\"Coloured Rain\\", 11/1967 (first 100,000 in picture sleeve) (UK #8, November 1967) *WIP-6026 - Jackie Edwards: \\"Julie On My Mind\\" b/w \\"If This Is Heaven\\", 2/1968 *WIP-6027 - Kytes: \\"Running In The Water\\" b/w \\"The End Of The Day\\", 2/1968 *WIP-6028 - Peter Sarstedt: \\"I Must Go On\\" b/w \\"Mary Jane\\", 1/1968 *WIP-6029 - Nirvana: \\"Rainbow Chaser\\" b/w \\"Flashbulb\\", 3/1968 (UK #34, May 1968) *WIP-6030 - Traffic: \\"No Face, No Name And No Number\\" b/w \\"Roamin' Thru' The Gloamin' With 40,000 Headmen\\", 2/1968 (UK #40, March 1968) *WIP-6031 - The Smoke: \\"Utterly Simple\\" b/w \\"Sydney Gill\\", 3/1968 (not issued)Rare Record Price Guide, 2008 edition *WIP-6032 - Dave Mason: \\"Just For You\\" b/w \\"Little Woman\\", 2/1968 *WIP-6033 - Emil Dean: \\"This Is Our Anniversary\\" b/w \\"Lonely Boy\\", 3/1968 *WIP-6034 - Santos Morados: \\"Tonopah\\" b/w \\"Anytime\\", 3/1968 *WIP-6035 - Sarolta: \\"Open Your Hands\\" b/w \\"L.O.V.E.\\", 4/1968 *WIP-6036 - Jackie Edwards & Jimmy Cliff: \\"Set Me Free\\" b/w \\"Here I Come\\", 6/1968 *WIP-6037 - Spooky Tooth: \\"Love Really Changed Me\\" b/w \\"Luther's Groove\\", 6/1968 *WIP-6038 - Nirvana: \\"Girl In The Park\\" b/w \\"C Side In Ocho Rios\\", 6/1968 *WIP-6039 - Jimmy Cliff: \\"Waterfall\\" b/w \\"Reward\\", 7/1968 *WIP-6040 - Soul People: \\"Hummin'\\" b/w \\"Soul Drink\\", 7/1968 *WIP-6041 - Traffic: \\"You Can All Join In\\" b/w \\"Withering Tree\\", 8/1968 (promo/export issue only - see reference)Jan Inge Sommerseth's comprehensive Steve Winwood discography lists this as a UK promo item, but the eil.com discography illustrates a copy which is described as an export issue with black & silver labels and matrix number SON-638.

Some internet biographies of Sue & Sunny suggest that they released at least one single on Island; this would appear to be it, but the obvious discrepancy in catalogue numbers is not explained. *WIP-6043 - Jethro Tull: \\"A Song for Jeffrey\\" b/w \\"One for John Gee\\", 27/9/1968 *WIP-6044 - Wynder K Frog: \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\" b/w \\"Baldy\\", 8/1968 *WIP-6045 - Nirvana: \\"All Of Us (The Touchables)\\" b/w \\"Trapeze\\", 11/1968 *WIP-6046 - Spooky Tooth: \\"The Weight\\" b/w \\"Do Right People\\", 9/1968 *WIP-6047 - Fairport Convention: \\"Meet on the Ledge\\" b/w \\"Throwaway Street Puzzle\\", 12/1968 *WIP-6048 - Jethro Tull: \\"Love Story\\" b/w \\"Christmas Song\\", 29/11/1968 (UK #29, January 1969) *WIP-6049 - Heavy Jelly: \\"I Keep Singing That Same Old Song\\" b/w \\"Blue\\", 1/1969 *WIP-6050 - Traffic: \\"Medicated Goo\\" b/w \\"Shanghai Noodle Factory\\", 12/1968 *WIP-6051 - Joyce Bond: \\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\\" b/w Joyce Bond Review: \\"Robin Hood Rides Again\\", 12/1968 *WIP-6052 - Nirvana: \\"Wings Of Love\\" b/w \\"Requiem To John Coltrane\\", 1/1969 *WIP-6053 - Bob & Earl: \\"Harlem Shuffle\\" b/w \\"I'll Keep Running Back\\", 1/1969 (UK #7, March 1969) *WIP-6054 - Free: \\"Broad Daylight\\" b/w \\"The Worm\\", March 1969 *WIP-6055 - Clouds: \\"Make No Bones About It\\" b/w \\"Heritage\\", 3/1969 *WIP-6056 - Jethro Tull: \\"Living in the Past\\" b/w \\"Driving Song\\", 2/5/1969 (UK #3, May 1969) *WIP-6057 - Nirvana: \\"Oh!

Z. Hill / Intentions: Gimmie Gimmie (Sue subsidiary)  LPs of the 1960s  For LPs the label chose the prefix ILP (meaning: Island Long Player) with a number of three figures beginning with 900, later supplemented by ILPS (meaning: Island Long Player Stereo) to distinguish between Mono and Stereo records. Some records were issued in both forms. For those records in stereo, the catalogue number was changed by adding a fourth figure (e.g.: ILP 970 was the mono equivalent of ILPS 9070).  ILP/ILPS series  *ILP 901 - Keith and Enid: Keith and Enid Sing, 1964 the above was the only Island LP released with a black and silver 'flaming sun' label. All following Island LPs had the white and red 'flaming sun' label.

It is known as the 'black block' label, as it featured a thick, block-like letter i at the bottom, dotted by a black eyeball in the centre of the label. This was very quickly replaced by the third pink label, featuring a small white letter i logo. Due to variations in catalogue number assignation and the actual release dates of the records, there is a small cross-over period between the three pink label designs. The original label designs for the following LPs are detailed in parentheses. *ILPS 9102 - Fairport Convention: Unhalfbricking, 1969 (black block label) *ILPS 9103 - Jethro Tull: Stand Up, 1969 (eyeball label) *ILPS 9104 - Free: Free, 1969 (white i label) *ILPS 9105 - Nick Drake: Five Leaves Left, 1969 (black block label) *ILPS 9106 - Dr. Strangely Strange: \\"Kip of the Serenes\\", 1969 (eyeball label) All following LPs were originally issued on the third pink label, with 'white i' logo. *ILPS 9107 - Spooky Tooth: Ceremony, 1969 *ILPS 9108 - Mott the Hoople: Mott the Hoople, 1969 *ILPS 9109 - V.A.: British Blues Adventures Vol.2, 1969 (France Only) *ILPS 9110 Q- Quintessence: In Blissful Company, 1969 *ILPS 9111 - King Crimson: In the Court of the Crimson King, 1969 *ILPS 9112 - Traffic: Best of Traffic, 1969 *ILPS 9113 - John & Beverley Martyn: Stormbringer!, 1970 *ILPS 9114 - Renaissance: Renaissance, 1969 *ILPS 9115 - Fairport Convention: Liege & Lief, 1969  IWP/IWPS series  During the same period Island Records released some sampler albums with the prefixes IWP/IWPS: *IWPS 2 - You Can All Join In, 1968 *IWP 3 - This Is Sue *IWPS 4 - Jackie Edwards - Put Your Tears Away *IWP 5 - This Is Blues *IWPS 6 - Nice Enough To Eat, 1969  UK releases 1970s   Singles in the 1970s   Island WIP series  The first release in 1970, WIP-6075, had the \\"block\\" label design, but the very next one, \\"John The Baptist\\" by John & Beverley Martyn, featured a third pink label design, characterised by a large white letter \\"i\\" on the left-hand side. This design was used for the remaining pink label issues, interrupted with increasing frequency by green Chrysalis label releases, as denoted in the listing below. Bronze label singles by artists such as Tony Hazzard and Uriah Heep began to appear in the Island listing from May 1971, for a couple of years until that label's own BRO- series was begun. An American record label, Blue Thumb, also released a small number of UK singles with WIP-series numbers in 1972/3. The one-off catalogue number WI-4002 was given to the flexi-single \\"Let There Be Drums\\" which came with the album Rock On by The Bunch in 1972. In the second half of the decade the character of the label began to change and this is reflected in its singles releases from about 1976 onwards. There was a conscious move back towards the label's roots in Jamaican music in the form of commercial reggae aimed at the rock/pop audience. Names such as Bob Marley & the Wailers, Toots & the Maytals and Third World crop up in the listings with increasing frequency. They and others enjoyed considerable commercial success in the U.K. market. There is evidence too of an increasing number of one-off licensing deals featuring (mainly American) soul and R & B singers (e.g. Barbara Pennington and Betty Davis). Island also joined a growing trend amongst U.K.-based record companies at that time towards exploitation of its own back catalogue,See article by Simon Frith on A & R men in Rock File 4 (eds. Frith & Gillett, pub. Panther books, 1976), and a substantial programme of reissues was undertaken, especially of ska and reggae titles, most of which seem to have been aimed at a small, specialist audience and did not enjoy widespread commercial success. Also in 1976, another American record label, Shelter Records, began to issue U.K. singles through Island, which received WIP-series catalogue numbers. Artists included the Dwight Twilley Band, J.J. Cale and Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers, the last-named of whom enjoyed some success on the coat-tails of punk. Finally, the Black Swan label was reactivated for certain reggae- styled releases, some of which appeared with WIP-series numbers. (N.B. For reasons of continuity, this section of the discography also includes singles numbered in the WIP 6xxx series which were released between 1980 and 1983.) *WIP-6075 - Quintessence: \\"Notting Hill Gate\\" b/w \\"Move Into The Light\\", 1/1970 *WIP-6076 - John & Beverley Martyn: \\"John The Baptist\\" b/w \\"The Ocean\\", 1/1970 *WIP 6077 - Jethro Tull: \\"The Witch's Promise\\" b/w \\"Teacher\\", 16/1/1970 (green Chrysalis label, some in picture sleeve) *WIP 6078 - Blodwyn Pig: \\"Same Old Story\\" b/w \\"Slow Down\\", 1/1970 (green Chrysalis label) *WIP 6079 - Renaissance: \\"Island\\" b/w \\"The Sea\\", 1/1970 *WIP-6080 - King Crimson: \\"Cat Food\\" b/w \\"Groon\\", 13/3/1970 (picture sleeve) *WIP 6081 - Jethro Tull: \\"Inside\\" b/w \\"Alive And Well And Living In\\", 24/4/1970 (green Chrysalis label) *WIP-6082 - Free: \\"All Right Now\\" b/w \\"Mouthful of Grass\\", 5/1970 (reissued in 1973 with same catalogue number, but \\"pink rim\\" labels *WIP 6083 - If: \\"Raise The Level Of Your Conscious Mind\\" b/w \\"I'm Reaching Out On All Sides\\", 5/1970 *WIP 6084 - Spooky Tooth: \\"Nobody There At All\\" b/w Art: \\"Room With A View\\", 6/1970 (withdrawn, white-label/promo copies exist) *WIP-6085 - Fotheringay: \\"Peace In The End\\" b/w \\"Winter Winds\\", 6/1970 *WIP-6086 - Cat Stevens: \\"Lady d'Arbanville\\" b/w \\"Time/Fill My Eyes\\", 6/1970 (some in picture sleeve, which miscredits b-side as \\"Katmandu\\") *WIP-6087 - Jimmy Cliff: \\"Wild World\\" b/w \\"Be Aware\\", 8/1970 *WIP 6088 - High Broom: \\"Dancing In The Moonlight\\" b/w \\"Percy's On The Run\\", 8/1970 *WIP-6089 - Fairport Convention: \\"Now Be Thankful\\" b/w \\"Sir B. McKenzie's Daughter's Lament For The 77th Mounted Lancers' Retreat From The Straits Of Loch Knombe, In The Year Of Our Lord 1727, On The Occasion Of The Announcement Of Her Marriage To The Laird Of Kinleakie\\", 9/1970 WIP-6089 was the last single to be released with a pink label. The next single, WIP-6090 was on the Chrysalis label, but from the one after that, WIP 6091, the \\"pink rim\\" palm tree label was introduced. *WIP 6090 - T√≠r na N√≥g: \\"I'm Happy To Be (On This Mountain) b/w Let My Love Grow, 10/1970 (green Chrysalis label) *WIP 6091 - The Alan Bown!: \\"Pyramid\\" b/w \\"Crash Landing\\", 10/1970 *WIP 6092 - Cat Stevens: \\"Father and Son\\" b/w \\"Moon Shadow\\", 9/1970 Other discographies, e.g. give release date as 6/1971, which is shortly before the b-side, \\"Moon Shadow\\", charted in the U.K. However, the matrix numbers - wipx1089 for \\"Father and Son\\" and wipx1090 for \\"Moon Shadow\\" - make it clear that \\"Father and Son\\" was originally the a-side and the original release date of 9/1970, in advance of the \\"Tea for the Tillerman\\" LP seems correct. Probably, the single was repromoted in June 1971, in advance of the \\"Teaser and the Firecat\\" LP, on which \\"Moon Shadow\\" appeared, and the latter track promoted as the a-side.

Possibly as a result of a pressing plant change, Jethro Tull's Chrysalis album Benefit was also pressed on the pink rim/palm tree Island label sometime between November 1970 (when that label design went into use) and July 1973 (when Tull's first four albums, including Benefit, were reissued in the Chrysalis CHR 1000 series). *ILPS 9100-9115-various prog groups: Renaissance, Jethro Tull, King Crimson, Fairport Convention, etc.; LP at this point were pressed by Polydor. In late 1970, pressing was then switched from Polydor to EMI Records. Then as of late 1975, they switched to an unknown, budget manufacturer (EMI had type-printed Matrix/catalog numbers around center label; Budget mfg. had sloppily hand written matrix numbers around label and used inferior vinyl). *ILPS 9116 - Traffic: John Barleycorn Must Die, 1970 *ILPS 9117 - Spooky Tooth: The Last Puff, 1970 *ILPS 9118 - Cat Stevens: Mona Bone Jakon, 1970 *ILPS 9119 - Mott the Hoople: Mad Shadows, 1970 *ILPS 9120 - Free: Fire and Water, 1970 *ILPS 9121 - not issued *ILPS 9122 - Blodwyn Pig: Getting To This, 1970 (Label: Chrysalis) *ILPS 9123 - Jethro Tull: Benefit, 1970 (Label: Chrysalis) *ILPS 9124 - Bronco: Country Home, 1970 *ILPS 9125 - Fotheringay: Fotheringay, 1970 *ILPS 9126 - McDonald & Giles: McDonald and Giles, 1970 *ILPS 9127 - King Crimson: In the Wake of Poseidon, 1970 *ILPS 9128 - Quintessence: Quintessence, 1970 *ILPS 9129 - If: If, 1970 *ILPS 9130 - Fairport Convention: Full House, 1970 The pink label was replaced by the 'pink rim/palm tree' label at this point, but there was a small cross- over period. At the same time, Island changed its main pressing plants from those of Polydor to EMI. *ILPS 9131 - The Alan Bown: Listen, 1970 (pink rim/palm tree label) *ILPS 9132 - Emerson, Lake & Palmer: Emerson, Lake & Palmer, 1970 (pink label) *ILPS 9133 - John and Beverley Martyn: The Road to Ruin, 1970 (pink label) *ILPS 9134 - Nick Drake: Bryter Layter, 1970 (pink rim/palm tree label) *ILPS 9135 - Cat Stevens: Tea for the Tillerman, 1970 (pink label) From this point, all Island releases featured the pink rim/palm tree label.

Some new labels entered the Island distribution and were given Island catalogue numbers received for UK release while retaining their original labels (e.g. ZE, Celluloid). *ILPS 9590 - Toots & the Maytals : Just Like That (1980) *ILPS 9591 - Sugar Minott : Black Roots (1979) *ILPS 9592 - Grace Jones : Warm Leatherette (1980) *ILPS 9593 - Black Uhuru : Sinsemilla (1980) *ILPS 9594 - Strand : Strand (1980) *ILPS 9595 - Robert Palmer : Clues (1980) *ILPS 9596 - Bob Marley & The Wailers : Uprising (1980) Collectable Records.ru *ILPS 9599 - Aswad : Live & Direct (1983) *ILPS 9601 - Various Artists : The Secret Policemen's Ball (1980) *ILPS 9603 - The Jags : Evening Standards (1980) *ILPS 9604 - The Distractions : Nobody's Perfect (1980) *ILPS 9605 - Linton Kwesi Johnson : Bass Culture (1980) *ILPS 9606 - Michael Prophet : Serious Reasoning (1980) *ILPS 9608 - Inner Circle : New Age Music (1980) *ILPS 9611 - Aswad : Hulet (1979) *ILPS 9613 - Steel Pulse : Caught You (1980) *ILPS 9614 - Ultravox : Three Into One (1979) *ILPS 9615 - Vivian Jackson (aka Yabba U) : Jah Jah Way (1980) *ILPS 9616 - Third World : Prisoner In The Street (1980) *ILPS 9617 - Rivits : Multiplay (1980) *ILPS 9618 - Randy Vanwarmer : Terraform (1980) *ILPS 9619 - Tony Tuff (aka Winston Morris): Tony Tuff (1980) *ILPS 9620 - Gibson Brothers : On The Riviera (1980) *ILPS 9622 - The B-52's : Wild Planet (1980) *ILPS 9624 - Grace Jones : Nightclubbing (1981) *ILPS 9625 - Black Uhuru : Red (1981) *ILPS 9626 - Rockats : Live At The Ritz (1981) *ILPS 9627 - Plastics : Welcome Back (1981) *ILPS 9629 - Bunny Wailer : Sings The Wailers (1981) *ILPS 9631 - The Paragons : Sly & Robbie Meet The Paragons (1981) *ILPS 9640 - Various Artists : Crucial Reggae Driven By Sly & Robbie (1981) *ILPS 9641 - Basement 5 : 1965-1980 (1980) *ILPS 9644 - Brian Briggs : Brian Damage (1980) *ILPS 9646 - U2 : Boy (1980) *ILPS 9647 - Toots & the Maytals : Live (1980) *ILPS 9648 - Marianne Faithfull : Dangerous Acquaintances (1981) *ILPS 9649 - Judy Mowatt : Black Woman (label: Island/Grove Muzic) (1980) *ILPS 9650 - Linton Kwesi Johnson : LKJ in Dub (1980) *ILPS 9655 - The Jags : No Tie Like A Present (1981) *ILPS 9656 - Ryuichi Sakamoto : B2-Unit (1980) *ILPS 9657 - Todd Rundgren Healing (1981) *ILPS 9658 - Manu Dibango : Ambassador (1981) *ICT 9662 - Sly and Robbie : The Sixties Seventies+Eighties /Taxi = Sly And Robbie (1981) *ILPS 9665 - Robert Palmer : Maybe It's Live, 1982 *ILPS 9666 - Was (Not Was) : Was (Not Was) (1981) *ILPS 9667 - Various Artists : SeiZE The Beat (Label: ZE), 1981 *ICT 9668(?) - Sly and Robbie : Present Taxi, 1981 *ILPS 9669 - Gregory Isaacs : More Gregory, 1981 *ILPS 9670 - Toots & the Maytals : Knock Out, 1981 *ILPS 9671 - Jimmy Riley : Rydim Driven, 1981 *ILPS 9673 - Sly Dunbar : Sly-Go-Ville, 1982 *ILPS 9675 - Adrian Belew : Lone Rhino (1982) *ILPS 9676 - Pete Shelley : Homo Sapiens (Label: Genetic), 1981 *ILPS 9680 - U2 : October, 1981 *ILPS 9682 - Excalibur : Excalibur, 1981 *ILPS 9686 - Tom Tom Club : Tom Tom Club, 1981 *ILPS 9688 - Elli & Jacno : Tout Va Sauter 1980 *ILPS 9692 - Alan Vega : \\"Collision Drive\\" (Label: Celluloid), 1981 *ILPS 9693 - Material : \\"Memory Serves\\" (Label: Celluloid /Metropolis), 1981 *ILPS 9696 - Black Uhuru : Tear It Up, 1982 *ILPS 9697 - Various Artists : Sound d'Afrique, 1982 *ILPS 9698 - Various Artists : The Secret Policeman's Other Ball (The Music) 1982 *ILPS 9699 - Gwen Guthrie : Gwen Guthrie, 1982 *ILPS 9700 - Joe Cocker : Sheffield Steel, 1982 *ILPS 9701 - Black Uhuru : Chill Out, 1982 *ILPS 9705 - Various Artists : Raiders Of The Lost Dub, 1981 *ILPS 9706 - Cat Stevens : Morning Has Broken, 1981 *ILPS 9711 - Aswad : A New Chapter Of Dub, 1982 *ILPS 9712 ‚Äì King Sunny Ad√© : Ju Ju Music, 1982 *ILPS 9713 - Barry Reynolds : I Scare Myself, 1982 *ILPS 9714 - Tony Tuff Tuff : Selection 1982 *ILPS 9717 - Michael Smith : Mi Cyaan Believe It, 1982 Discogs *ILPS 9719 - Free : Completely Free, 1982 *ILPS 9720 - Robert Palmer : Pride, 1983 *ILPS 9721 - Gregory Isaacs : Night Nurse, 1982 *ILPS 9722 - Grace Jones : Living My Life, 1982 *ILPS 9730 - Various Artists : Crucial Reggae - Driven By Sly & Robbie 1982 *ILPS 9733 - U2 : War 1983 *ILPS 9734 - Marianne Faithfull : A Childs Adventure 1983 *ILPS 9735 - Szajner : Brute Reason (LP, Album) 1983 *ILPS 9736 - Set The Tone : Shiftin' Air Affair 1983 *ILPS 9737 - King Sunny Ad√© : Synchro System, 1983CD label: Mango CCD 9737 /US *ILPS 9738 - Tom Tom Club : Close To The Bone 1983 *ILPS 9739 - David Joseph : The Joys Of Life 1983 *ILPS 9742 - Paul Haig : Rhythm Of Life 1983 *ILPS 9743 - Kid Creole And The Coconuts : Doppelganger 1983 *ILPS 9746 ‚Äì King Sunny Ad√© : Aura, 1984 *ILPS 9747 - Rupert Hine : The Wildest Wish To Fly 1983 *ILPS 9748 - Gregory Isaacs : Out Deh!

The albums were compiled by Trevor Wyatt, the covers were illustrated by various artists on the basis of paintings and contain extensive liner notes. This part of the Island Records discography can be found here: Island Reggae Greats  Island CID 101 series  After the CD format was introduced on the record market Island reacted coolly by releasing only a small number of bestsellers during 1984/1985 introducing the CID (Compact Island Disc) prefix with catalogue numbers starting at 101. Soon after the company started to release new CDs and to re-release older material with the CID prefix and the \\"ILPS\\" catalogue numbers. *CID 101 - Frankie Goes To Hollywood: Welcome To The Pleasuredome (ZTT label), 1985 *CID 102 - U2: Unforgettable Fire *CID 103 - Bob Marley: Legend *CID 104 - Wally Badarou: Echoes *CID 110 - U2: Boy *CID 111 - U2: October *CID 112 - U2: War *CID 113 - U2: Under A Blood Red Sky *CID 120 - Philip Glass: Koyaanisqatsi *CID 126 - Propaganda: A Secret Wish (ZTT label) *CID 127 - Andrew Poppy: The Beating Of Wings (ZTT label) *CID 128 - Sly & Robbie: Language Barrier *CID 130 - Robert Palmer: Riptide *CID 131 - Tom Waits: Raindogs, 1985 *CID 132 - Grace Jones: Island Life *CD: Island CID 132 / 610 584-222 / UK/Germany, 1985  Island Masters  In 1989, Island Records was sold to Polygram. Immediately Polygram started to re-release parts of the Island catalogue, mainly classics from the 1970s and good selling records from the 1980s within a CD series called Island Masters. The series ran with the prefix IMCD and catalogue numbers starting with 1. The first year of the label has seen more than 70 releases. Finally the catalogue comprised more than 300 titles, from the year 2000 on in re-mastered quality. The discography can be seen under Island Masters.  UK releases 1990s   Singles of the 1990s   The IS/CID series  As CD became the preferred format for the majority of sales, singles released in that format were prefixed CID. Otherwise, the series continued the numbering of the IS series begun in the 1980s. Singles released on a variety of vinyl formats (7\\", 10\\", 12\\", etc.) continued to be prefixed IS (or 10IS, 12IS, etc.). Frequently, CD and larger format releases included additional (or sometimes different) songs to those found on the traditional 7\\" format. *CID 463 - Hinterland: \\"Desert Boots\\", July 1990 *CID 470 - Anthrax: \\"In My World\\", 1990 *CID 471 - Claudia Br√ºcken: \\"Absolut(e)\\", 1990; CD; 12\\": 12IS 471 / UK *CID 477 - This Ragged Jack: \\"The Party's Over\\", 1990; 12\\": 12IS 477 / UK *CID 479 - Claudia Br√ºcken: \\"Kiss Like Ether\\", 1990; 12\\": 12IS 479 / 878 449-1 /UK; 12\\"-Promo: 12IS 479DJ *CID 482 - Nine Inch Nails: \\"Down In It\\", 1990; 12\\": 12IS 482 / UK *IS 483 - Julian Cope: \\"Beautiful Love\\" b/w \\"Port of Saints\\", 2/1991 *CID 484 - Nine Inch Nails: \\"Head Like A Hole\\", 1990/1991; 10\\"-Picture Disc: 10ISP 484 /UK; 12\\": 12IS 484 *CID 490 - Anthrax: \\"Bring The Noise\\", 1991; CD; 12\\": 12IS 490 / UK *IS 492 - Julian Cope: \\"East Easy Rider\\" b/w \\"Butterfly E\\", 1991 *CID 496 - Top: \\"Number One Dominator\\", 1991 *CID 497 - Julian Cope: \\"Head E.P.\\", 1991; 12\\": 12IS 497 /UK *CID 498 - Robert Palmer: \\"Every Kinda People\\", 1991; 12\\": 12IS 498 /UK *CID 499 - Screaming Target: \\"Knowledge 'N' Numbers\\", 1991; 12\\": 12IS 499 / UK *CID 500 - U2: \\"The Fly\\", 22.10.1991; 12\\": 12IS 500 / UK *IS 524 - Robert Palmer: \\"You're In My System\\"; 12IS 524 DJ /UK *IS 548 - The Cranberries: \\"Dreams\\" b/w \\"What You Were\\", 1992; 12\\": 12IS 548 (includes extra track \\"Liar\\") *IS 550 - U2: \\"Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses\\", 1992 *CID 559 - The Cranberries: \\"Linger (Live)\\" / \\"I Still Do (Live)\\" b/w Waltzing (Live)\\" / \\"Pretty (Live)\\", 1994; 10\\": 10IS 559 / 858 241-0 / UK *CID 576 - Sheep On Drugs: \\"Let The Good Times Roll\\", 1994; 10\\": 10IS 576 / UK *IS 591 - The Wedding Present: \\"It's A Gas\\" b/w \\"Bubbles\\", 1994 *ISC 595 - Pulp: The Sisters EP (\\"Babies\\", \\"Your Sister's Clothes\\" b/w \\"Seconds\\", \\"His'n'Hers\\"), 1994 *IS 600 - The Cranberries: \\"Zombie\\" b/w \\"Away\\", 1994 *IS 601 - The Cranberries: \\"Ode To My Family\\" b/w \\"So Cold In Ireland\\", 1994 *IS 629 - V.A.: Don't Be A Menace; 12\\": 12IS 629 DJ / UK promo *IS 647 - Lewis Taylor: \\"Whoever\\"; 12\\": 12IS 647 DJ / UK promo *IS 653 - Lewis Taylor: \\"Bittersweat\\"; 12\\": 12IS 653 DJ /UK promo *IS 687 - Carrie: \\"Molly\\" b/w \\"Split Up Song\\", 1998 *IS 689 - Hinda Hicks: \\"If You Want Me\\"; 12\\": 12IS 689 DJ / UK promo; 12\\": 12ISX 689 DJ / UK promo *IS 700 - Hinda Hicks: \\"You Think You Own me\\"; 12\\": 12ISX 700 DJ / UK promo *CID 711 - Paul Weller: Brand New Start, 1998 *CID 718 - PJ Harvey: A Perfect Day Elise', 1998 *CID 721 - Hinda Hicks: Truly, 1998 *CID 724 - Talvin Singh: OK, 1998 *IS 738 - Elcka: \\"Pleasure\\"; 12\\": 12IS 738 DJ / UK promo *IS 740 - Witness: \\"Scars\\" b/w \\"More Miles Away\\" and \\"Long First Chapter\\", 1999 *IS 749 - Witness: \\"Audition\\" b/w \\"Blind Soul Mime\\" and \\"Could've Had A Time\\", 1999 *IS 758 - Witness: \\"Hijacker\\" b/w \\"Lowjacker\\", 1999 *IS 816 - Bon Gar√ßon: The E.P.; 12\\": 12IS 816 DJ / UK promo *IS 849 - Keane: \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\" b/w \\"Snowed Under\\", 2004  The Island Jamaica series  *IJA 2005 - Chaka Demus & Pliers: Every Kinda People, 1996 (IJA 2005DJ: promo 12\\" single) *IJA 2007 - Luciano meets Jungle Brothers: Who Could It Be, 1995 *IJA 2008 - Luciano: Life, 1996 (IJA 2008DJ: promo 12\\" single) *IJA 2009 - Frankie Oliver: She Lied To Me, 1996 (IJA 2009DJ > promo 12\\" single) *IJCD 2016 - Frankie Oliver: Who's Gonna Do It, 1997 (5\\"CD-single)  LPs/CDs in the 1990s   The CID 8000 series  1992 Island had reached catalogue number 9999 for its ILP/ILPS series and continued at number 8000; as the principal medium had changed since several years, CID became the general prefix.

The discography can be found under Island Masters.  Reggae Refreshers  This series started with 26 releases in 1990. Island used the new label to re-issue a part of its reggae catalogue. Confusing was that some of the titles were also released within the Island Masters series or deleted shortly after the release to be re-released otherwise (the Bob Marley & The Wailers catalogue).

Namalata is part of Lomaloma Tikina. The people of Namalata were the original inhabitants of Mago Island, which is now owned by the actor and film director Mel Gibson. Chiefly Titles The Chief of Namalata Village is the Tui Mago. From Mago to Namalata In the mid-19th century, Fiji's two dominant chiefs at the time, the Vunivalu of Bau (Seru Epenisa Cakobau) and the Tui Cakau were threatened by the Tongan warlord, Enele Ma'afu. They sought the help of the Namalata people while Ma'afu was in Lomaloma, on Vanua Balavu, as they could provide information on his movements. The island of Mago was then given to Europeans in order to slow Ma'afu's advancement into Fiji, as the threat of retaliation from their respective homelands deterred him from attacking Europeans. When Fiji was ceded to the United Kingdom in 1874, those occupying the island were registered as the rightful owners, thus dispossessing the Namalata people. Effectively, they lost their land while providing a service to their people.  References  * Derrick, Ronald Albert; The Fiji Islands, a Geographical Handbook, published 1957 Govt.

These panels are designed so as to produce a distinct and easily identifiable infrared signature when seen through thermal imaging systems. Originally created as a hasty expediency, the use of low-thermal-emissivity tape and physical separation from the body of the vehicle meant that the panel would appear as a contrasting dark (i.e. cooler) area through thermal viewers.

Name  The name has also been transliterated into Rashidiya, Rashidiyah, Rachidiye, Rashidiyyeh, Rashadiya, Rashidiyya, Resh√Æd√Æyeh, or Rusheidiyeh with or without a version of the article Al, El, Ar, or Er. The London-based Palestine Exploration Fund (PEF) and other sources recorded that in the Mid-19th century the settlement was named after its then owner, the Ottoman top-diplomat and politician Mustafa Re≈üid Pasha, known best as the chief architect behind the regime's modernization reforms known as Tanzimat.  Territory  There is an abundance of fresh water supplies in the area with the springs of Rashidieh itself and those of Ras al-Ain nearby. To its northern side, Rashidieh borders the Tyre Coast Nature Reserve. According to a 1998 fact-finding mission of the Danish Immigration Service, the camp covers an area of 248,426 square meters. Journalist Robert Fisk estimated the size to be four square miles. A 2017 census found that there were 1,510 buildings with 2,417 households in Rashidieh.  History of the site   Prehistoric times  According to Ali Badawi, the long-time chief- archaeologist for Southern Lebanon at the Directorate-General of Antiquities, it can be generally assumed that all villages around Tyre were established already during prehistoric times of the neolithic age (5.000 BCE), especially in the fertile area of Ras al-Ain, next to the Tell El-Rashdiyeh (the Hill of Rashidieh).  Ancient times   Phoenician times  leftAmphora from Rashidieh with Phoenician inscription mentioning the volume, the bat = 22 liters Many scholars assume that the area of what is now Rashidieh actually used to be the original Ushu (also transliterated Usu or Uzu), founded on the mainland around 2750 BCE as a walled place. It was later called Palaetyrus (also spelled Palaityros or Palaeotyre), meaning \\"Old Tyre\\" in Ancient Greek, and was the lifeline for Island Tyre as its continental twin sister: > \\"To an overpopulated island, its mainland territory was a vital necessity, > supplying it with agricultural products, drinking water, wood and murex. In > isolation the island city was nothing.\\" One of the reasons to locate Ushu/Palaetyrus in the Rashidieh area is the delineation of its acropolis by Ancient-Greek geographer Strabo, who visited Tyre himself. The springs of Ras al-Ain were described by later scholars as the \\"cisterns of Solomon\\" and said to have been commissioned by the legendary King of Israel, who was a close ally of Tyrian king Hiram I. Very few archaeological excavations have been conducted in Rashidieh. However, the collections of the National Museum of Beirut hold a number of items which were found there. Amongst them is an amphora with Phoenician inscriptions dated to the Iron Age II and a cinerary urn dated 775-750 BCE. The latter was an import from Cyprus and gives evidence that Rashidieh was used as a necropolis as well. However, Ushu/Palaetyrus apparently suffered great damages when the Neo- Assyrian king Shalmaneser V besieged the twin-city in the 720s BCE. Likewise during the attack by Neo-Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II, who started a siege of Tyre in 586 BCE that went on for thirteen years.  Hellenistic times  Illustration of Alexander's siege by the United States Military Academy locating Old Tyre in the Rashidieh area Reportedly, when Alexander the Great arrived at the gates of Tyre in 332 BCE and proposed to sacrifice to city deity Melqart in the temple on the island, the Tyrian government refused this and instead suggested that Alexander sacrifice at another temple on the mainland at Old Tyre. Angered by this rejection and the city's loyalty to Persian king Darius the Great, Alexander started his Siege of Tyre despite its reputation as being impregnable. However, the Macedonian conqueror succeeded after seven months by demolishing the old city on the mainland and using its stones to construct a causeway to the island. This isthmus increased greatly in width over the centuries because of extensive silt depositions on either side, making the former island a permanent peninsula - based on the ruins and rubble of Palaetyrus.  Roman times (64BCE-395)  During Roman times, large water reservoirs were built in Ras al-Ain as well as an aqueduct which channeled the water to Tyre. At the same time, the use of the area as a burial ground seems to have continued: a marble sarcophagus from the first or second century CE was discovered there in 1940. It is exhibited at the National Museum in Beirut.  Byzantine period (395‚Äì640)  According to the Syrian scholar Evagrius Scholasticus (536-596 CE), the hill of what is now Rashidieh was known as Sinde - \\"a place where a hermit called Zozyma used to dwell.\\" Over the course of the 6th century CE, starting in 502, a series of earthquakes shattered Tyre area and left the city diminished. The worst one was the 551 Beirut earthquake. It was accompanied by a Tsunami and probably destroyed also much of what was left in the area of what is now Rashidieh. In addition, the city and its population increasingly suffered during the 6th century from the political chaos that ensued when the Byzantine empire was torn apart by wars. The city remained under Byzantine control until it was captured by the Sassanian shah Khosrow II at the turn from the 6th to the 7th century CE, and then briefly regained until the Muslim conquest of the Levant, when in 640 it was taken by the Arab forces of the Rashidun Caliphate.  Medieval times   Early Muslim period (640‚Äì1124)  As the bearers of Islam restored peace and order, Tyre soon prospered again and continued to do so during half a millennium of Caliphate rule. The Rashidun period only lasted until 661. It was followed by the Umayyad Caliphate (until 750) and the Abbasid Caliphate. In the course of the centuries, Islam spread and Arabic became the language of administration instead of Greek. At the end of the 11th century, Tyre avoided being attacked by paying tribute to the Crusaders who marched on Jerusalem. However, in late 1111, King Baldwin I of Jerusalem laid siege on the former island city and probably occupied the mainland, including the area that is now Rashidieh, for that purpose. Tyre in response put itself under the protection of the Seljuk military leader Toghtekin. Supported by Fatimid forces, he intervened and forced the Franks to raise the siege in April 1112, after about 2.000 of Baldwin's troops had been killed. A decade later, the Fatimids sold Tyre to Toghtekin who installed a garrison there.  Crusader period (1124‚Äì1291)  On 7 July 1124, in the aftermath of the First Crusade, Tyre was the last city to be eventually conquered by the Christian warriors, a Frankish army on the coast - i.e. also in the El Buss area - and a fleet of the Venetian Crusade from the sea side. The takeover followed a siege of five and a half months that caused great suffering from hunger to the population. Eventually, Tyre's Seljuk ruler Toghtekin negotiated an agreement for surrender with the authorities of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem. Under its new rulers, Tyre and its countryside - including El-Buss - were divided into three parts in accordance with the Pactum Warmundi: two- thirds to the royal domain of Baldwin and one third as autonomous trading colonies for the Italian merchant cities of Genoa, Pisa and - mainly to the Doge of Venice. He had a particular interest in supplying silica sands to the glassmakers of Venice and so it may be assumed that the area of what is now Rashidieh fell into his interest sphere.  Mamluk period (1291‚Äì1516)  In 1291, Tyre was again taken, this time by the Mamluk Sultanate's army of Al- Ashraf Khalil. He had all fortifications demolished to prevent the Franks from re-entrenching. After Khalil's death in 1293 and political instability, Tyre lost its importance and \\"sank into obsurity.\\" When the Moroccan explorer Ibn Batutah visited Tyre in 1355, he found it a mass of ruins.  Modern times   Ottoman rule (1516-1918)  Emir Fa·∏´ereddin II 1764 map The Ottoman Empire conquered the Levant in 1516, yet the desolate area of Tyre remained untouched for another ninety years until the beginning of the 17th century, when the leadership at the Sublime Porte appointed the Druze leader Fakhreddine II as Emir to administer Jabal Amel (modern-day South Lebanon). He encouraged the systematically discriminated Shiites - known as the Metwalis - to settle near Tyre in order to secure the road to Damascus, and thus laid the foundation of Rashidieh's 19th century demographics. However, the development of the Greater Tyre area stalled once again in 1635, when Sultan Murad IV had Fakhreddine executed for his political ambitions. Henceforth, it is unclear how the area of Rashidieh developed in the following 200 years, except that it was apparently called Tell Habish (also spelled Habesh) during that time, the \\"Hill of Habish\\": \\"Habish\\" may be translated as \\"Ethiopian\\", which in turn might refer to the Tyrian brothers Frumentius and Edesius, who got shipwrecked on the Eritrean coast in the 4th century CE. While Frumentius has been credited with bringing Christianity to the Kingdom of Aksum and became the first bishop of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, Edesius returned to Tyre to become a priest.\\"Er Rusheidiyeh\\" on the SWP map, surveyed and drawn in May 1878 name giver: Re≈üid Pasha It was then in 1856, according to some sources, that Re≈üid Pasha obtained personal ownership of the lands in the area of Tell Habish. This was perhaps when he became Grand Vizier for the fifth time in his career at the end of that year. In any case, the transfer took obiously only place after the Ottoman leadership in Constantinople regained control over Jabal Amel from Muhammad Ali Pasha in 1839 after almost eight years. The army of the rebellious Egyptian Governor was defeated not only with allied support from the British Empire and Austria-Hungary, but mainly by Shiite forces under the leadership of the Ali al-Saghir dynasty. 1906 map The PEF Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) - led by Herbert Kitchener at the beginning of his military career - explored the area in May 1878 and described Er Rusheidiyeh as follows: > \\"It is a hill about sixty feet above the level of the sea. It took its > present name a few years ago, Rusheid Pasha (commonly written Reshid Pasha) > having acquired the place and built a farm upon it of the old materials > which covered the soil.\\" Sultan Abdulaziz And: > \\"A large square building, built by Rusheid Pasha for a factory; now contains > about 70 Metawileh, and is surrounded by gardens of olives, figs, > pomegranates, and lemons. It stands on a slight hill above the plain, and > has two strong springs near, surrounded by masonry.\\" According to the Bavarian historian and politician Johann Nepomuk Sepp, who in 1874 led an Imperial German mission to Tyre in search of the bones of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I \\"Barbarossa\\", the estate was taken over after the death of Re≈üid Pasha in 1858 by Sultan Abdulaziz. In 1903, the Greek archaeologist Theodore Makridi Bey, curator of the Imperial Museum at Constantinople conducted archaeological excavations in Rashidieh and discovered a number of cinerary urns with human bones and ashes. Some were locally made while others were imported from Cyprus. These findings were apparently sent to the Ottoman capital. A map from a 1906 Baedeker travel guide designates the area as \\"Tell Habesh or Resh√Æd√Æyeh\\". It shows a mill and a Khan (a Caravanserai).  French Mandate colonial rule (1920‚Äì1943)  On the first of September 1920, the colonial French rulers proclaimed the new State of Greater Lebanon. According to an oral history project, the new authorities gave \\"sections of Rashidieh Hill, where there were already two churches\\", to the Catholic Church‚Äôs Waqf, i.e. its financial endowment. It is unclear though whether this was the Latin-Catholic School or one of its orders like the Franciscans in Tyre, or the Maronite Catholic Archeparchy of Tyre, or the Melkite Greek Catholic Archeparchy of Tyre. The latter has apparently the largest property holdings of the Christian confessions in the area and is commonly just called \\"the Catholic church\\" In the following years, survivors of the Armenian Genocide started arriving in Tyre, mostly by boat: > \\"The first agricultural settlement was created in Ra's al-'Ain, near the > city of Tyre, in 1926. The operation quickly failed due to the animosity > between refugees from different regions, but also between the refugees and > the local population. The refugees had therefore to be relocated to Beirut.\\" 2017 map by the Dictaphone Group showing the original Old Camp for the Armenians in the South (left) Yet more refugees arrived and hence a branch of the Armenian General Benevolent Union was founded in Tyre in 1928. Then, in 1936, the colonial authorities started constructing a camp for Armenian refugees in Rashidieh. According to the above-mentioned oral history project, they were settled on the land which the French authorities had given to the Catholic church. It planned on a street grid. During the works a number of Phoenician tombs were discovered. One year later, another camp was constructed in the El Bass area of Tyre. In 1942, Emir Maurice Chehab (1904-1994) - \\"the father of modern Lebanese archaeology\\" who for decades headed the Antiquities Service in Lebanon and was the curator of the National Museum of Beirut - conducted further excavations in Rashidieh and discovered more cinerary urns from Phoenician times.  Lebanese independence (since 1943)   1948 Palestinian exodus  When the state of Israel was declared in May 1948, the area of Tyre was immediately affected: with the Palestinian exodus ‚Äì also known as the Nakba ‚Äì thousands of Palestinian refugees fled there, often by boat. However, Rashidieh apparently continued to house Armenian refugees, while Palestinians were sheltered in a tented camp at Burj el-Shemali for transit to other places in Lebanon. > \\"In 1950, a couple of years after arriving in south Lebanon, the Lebanese > authorities decided to relocate all Palestinians residing in southern towns > (e.g., Tibnine, al-Mansouri, al-Qlayla, and Bint Jbeil) to designated > refugee camps. The authorities established one of these camps adjacent to > the Armenian camp with nothing but tents. The residents there began to build > walls from mud and clay in order to reinforce the tents. For every eight > housing units, they built a shared bathroom fifty meters away. A decade > later, as Armenian residents began to leave, the Palestinian refugees began > moving into those lots. 200 of the 311 Armenian houses remain today and are > commonly referred to as the >Old Camp.<\\" In 1963, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) built a new section in Rashidieh to accommodate Palestine refugees from Deir al-Qassi, Alma, Suhmata, Nahaf, Fara and other villages in Palestine, who were relocated by the Lebanese government from the El Bass refugee camp and from Baalbeck. > \\"After the 1969 agreement in which the Lebanese government recognized the > presence of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in Lebanon, and its > control of the camps, the Rashidieh residents worked the Jaftalak fields > surrounding the camp without paying any fees. Each farmer could choose a > plot of land to plant and they would come to be (informally) known as the > owner of that plot. The Jaftalak land was public land divided between the > Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Education, and other-defined state > land. Yet the cultivation of Jaftalak fields was limited to greens: pinto > beans, lettuce, parsley, cilantro, radishes, etc. The farmers were > prohibited from growing fruit-bearing trees since the land did not legally > belong to them. According to Lebanese property law, whoever plants a tree, > automatically owns the land it is on.\\" In 1970, the camp received more Palestinian refugees, this time from Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan following the Black September conflict between Jordanian Armed Forces (JAF) under King Hussein and the PLO led by Yasser Arafat. Rashidieh increasingly became an important recruitment and training center for Al-'Asifah, the armed wing of Arafat's Fatah faction. In 1974, the Israeli military attacked: on May 19th, the Israeli Navy reportedly shelled Rashidieh, killing 5 people and injuring 11. On 20 June, the Israeli Air Force (IAF) bombed the camp. According to the Lebanese army, 5 people were killed and 21 injured in Rashidieh. In the same year, \\"a rescue excavation\\" was conducted in Rashidieh by Lebanon's Department of Antiquities after a mechanical digger was used to build a shelter and five Iron Age tombs were discovered.  Lebanese Civil War (1975‚Äì1990)  In January 1975, a unit of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) attacked the Tyre barracks of the Lebanese Army. The assault was denounced by the PLO as \\"a premeditated and reckless act\\". Two months later, a PLO commando of eight militants sailed from the coast of Tyre to Tel Aviv to mount the Savoy Hotel attack, during which eight civilian Hostages and three Israeli soldiers were killed as well as seven of the attackers. Israel retaliated by launching a string of attacks on Tyre \\"from land, sea and air\\" in August and September 1975. Then, in 1976, local commanders of the PLO took over the municipal government of Tyre with support from their allies of the Lebanese Arab Army. They occupied the army barracks, set up roadblocks and started collecting customs at the port. However, the new rulers quickly lost support from the Lebanese-Tyrian population because of their \\"arbitrary and often brutal behavior\\". = 1978 South Lebanon conflict with Israel = On 11 March 1978, Dalal Mughrabi ‚Äì a young woman from the Palestinian refugee camp of Sabra in Beirut ‚Äì and a dozen Palestinian fedayeen fighter sailed from Tyre to a beach north of Tel Aviv. Their attacks on civilian targets became known as the Coastal Road massacre that killed 38 Israeli civilians, including 13 children, and wounded 71. According to the United Nations, > PLO \\"claimed responsibility for that raid. In response, Israeli forces > invaded Lebanon on the night of 14/15 March, and in a few days occupied the > entire southern part of the country except for the city of Tyre and its > surrounding area.\\" Nevertheless, Tyre was badly affected in the fighting during the Operation Litani, with civilians bearing the brunt of the war, both in human lives and economically: The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) targeted especially the harbour on claims that the PLO received arms from there and the Palestinian refugee camps. On 19 March, the UN Security Council adopted resolutions in which decided on the immediate establishment of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). Its first troops arrived in the area already 4 days later. However, the Palestinian forces were unwilling to give up their positions in and around Tyre. UNIFIL was unable to expel those militants and sustained heavy casualties. It therefore accepted an enclave of Palestinian fighters in its area of operation which was dubbed the \\"Tyre Pocket\\". In effect, the PLO kept ruling Tyre with its Lebanese allies of the National Lebanese Movement, which was in disarray though after the 1977 assassination of its leader Kamal Jumblatt. Frequent IDF bombardments of Tyre from ground, sea and air raids continued after 1978. The PLO, on the other side, reportedly converted itself into a regular army by purchasing large weapon systems, including Soviet WWII- era T-34 tanks, which it deployed in the \\"Tyre Pocket\\" with an estimated 1,500 fighters. From there, and the area around Rashidieh in particular, it kept firing Katyusha rockets across the Southern border into Galilee until a cease- fire in July 1981. As discontent within the Shiite population about the suffering from the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian factions grew, so did the tensions between the Amal Movement - the dominant Shia-party - and the Palestinian militants. The power struggle was exacerbated by the fact that the PLO supported Saddam Hussein's camp during the Iraq-Iran-War, whereas Amal sided with Teheran. Eventually, the political polarisation between the former allies escalated into violent clashes in many villages of Southern Lebanon, including the Tyre area. = 1982 Lebanon War with Israel and Occupation = Graffiti in Rashidieh Following an assassination attempt on Israeli ambassador Shlomo Argov in London the IDF started an invasion of Lebanon on 6 June 1982, which heavily afflicted Tyre area once again. The first target of the invaders was Rashidieh. There were 15,356 registered Palestinian refugees in camp at the time, but John Bulloch, the Beirut-based correspondent of The Daily Telegraph at the time, estimated that it actually housed even more than 30,000. Most civilians fled into underground tunnels and bomb shelters, while Palestinian fighters tried to hold off the Israeli army. The militants, however, came under massive fire from air strikes, gunboats and artillery. Bulloch claimed that the IDF also dropped US-supplied cluster bombs and shells on Rashidieh. Noam Chomsky recorded that already by the second day much of Rashidieh \\"had become a field of rubble.\\" he quoted a UNIFIL officer as commenting: \\"It was like shooting sparrows with cannon.\\" On the fourth day, many civilians reportedly left their shelters waving white flags. Those who remained suffered for three more days, until the last guerillas were defeated. Bulloch writes that the Israelis lost nine men. The volunteer nurse Fran√ßoise Kesteman, who was a member of the French Communist Party, recounted as exemplary the death of a young Palestinian mother: > \\"When Mouna left the bomb shelter to fetch food for the children, Israeli > bombers ripped apart her small slender body.\\" For Kesteman, the bloodbath was a turning-point in her life and she joined the Palestinian guerillas after a brief return to France. She was killed two years later when she participated in an attempted attack on Israeli targets off the coast, making her the first French national to die fighting for the Palestinian militants. When the fighting stopped after one week, more destruction was done \\"systematically\\", as the IDF brought in bulldozers. According to Bulloch, the occupators not only barred international correspondents from visiting the camp, but they also refused to allow the delegates of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) any access for five weeks. Subsequently, the Christian Science Monitor estimated that about sixty percent of the camp were destroyed with some 5,000 refugees living in the ruins: > \\"Israeli soldiers dynamited air raid shelters built by the Palestine > Liberation Organzation.The shelters were scattered throughout the camp and > their demolition resulted in the destruction of surrounding houses as well. > [..] Many other houses were bulldozed, according to camp residents and UNRWA > workers, creating wide swaths leading to the sea.\\" \\"During the evacuation of the western sector in the Tzur area\\"The Israeli forces then made mass arrests and paraded the detainees in front of hooded collaborators who advised the occupators whom to detain. Bulloch reported that > \\"busloads of handcuffed and blindfolded suspects were taken off for > interrogation. These men were denied the small comfort of International Red > Cross visits since they were not considered prisoners of war, but > 'administrative detainees'.\\" Thus, the IDF obliterated Rashidieh as the main center of Palestinian operations into Upper Galliee. However, in the following three years, their occupation forces in the Tyre area came instead under the growing pressure from a number of devastating suicide attacks by Amal and - even more so - its emerging split-off Hezbollah. By the end of April 1985, the Israelis withdrew from Tyre and instead established a self-declared \\"Security Zone\\" in Southern Lebanon with its collaborating militia allies of the South Lebanon Army (SLA): = 1985-1988 War of the Camps: Amal vs. PLO = Berri (right) and Jumblatt in 1989 Tyre was left outside the SLA control though and taken over by Amal under the leadership of Nabih Berri. > \\"The priority of Amal remained to prevent the return of any armed > Palestinian presence to the South, primarily because this might provoke > renewed Israeli intervention in recently evacuated areas. The approximately > 60,000 Palestinian refugees in the camps around Tyre (al-Bass, Rashidiya, > Burj al-Shimali) were cut off from the outside world, although Amal never > succeeded in fully controlling the camps themselves. In the Sunni 'canton' > of Sidon, the armed PLO returned in force.\\" Tensions between Amal and Palestinian militants soon exploded into the War of the Camps, which is considered as \\"one of the most brutal episodes in a brutal civil war\\": In September 1986, a group of Palestinians fired on an Amal patrol at Rashidieh. After one month of siege, Amal attacked the camp. It was reportedly assisted by the Progressive Socialist Party of Druze leader Walid Jumblatt as well as by the pro-Syrian Palestinian militias of As-Saiqa and the \\"Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine ‚Äì General Command\\". Fighting spread and continued for one month. UNRWA recorded that between 1982 and 1987 in Rashidieh > \\"more than 600 shelters were totally or partially destroyed and more than > 5,000 Palestine refugees were displaced.\\" The conflict ended with the withdrawal of Palestinian forces loyal to PLO leader Arafat from Beirut and their redeployment to the camps in Southern Lebanon. The one in Rashidieh likewise continued to be the \\"main stronghold\\" of Arafat's Fatah party and loyalist contingents of other PLO factions, though some forces opposed to them - including Islamists - kept a presence and representation there as well. In February 1988, \\"Amal seemed to lose control\\" when US-Colonel William R. Higgins, who served in a senior position of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO), was kidnapped on the coastal highway to Naqoura close to Rashidieh by armed men suspected of being affiliated with Hezbollah. The incident took place following a meeting between Higgins and a local Amal leader and led to renewed clashes between Amal and Hezbollah, mainly in Beirut. Throughout the war, clandestine excavations were conducted in Rashidieh. Many cinerary urns from Phoenician times thus ended up in private collections without any documentation. In addition, Rashidieh's beach was subject to sand grabbing and suction.  Post-Civil War (since 1990)  Following the end of the war in March 1991 based on the Taif Agreement, units of the Lebanese Army deployed along the coastal highway and around the Palestinian refugee camps of Tyre. By the end of the 1990s, the Coalition of Fatah with the Palestinian Liberation Front (PLF), Palestinian Popular Struggle Front (PPSF), and the Palestinian People's Party (PPP) in Lebanon was headed by Sultan Abu al-'Aynayn, who resided in Rashidieh. At the time of Israel's invasion in the July 2006 Lebanon War, the camp had about 18,000 residents. Reportedly, more than 1,000 Lebanese fled their homes to seek shelter in Rashidieh during the Israeli bombardments of Southern Lebanon: > \\"It's kind of an irony really. It's almost a joke what's going on,\\" said > Ibrahim al-Ali, a 26-year-old Palestinian social worker in the camp. \\"The > irony is that refugees are accepting citizens from their own country.\\" In May 2020, clashes in Rashidieh left one person dead and five others injured.  Cultural Life  Murals in Rashidieh (2001) Like in other Palestinian refugee camps, Rashidieh's visual landscape reflects Palestinian nationalism, as murals, posters and flags express the hope to return homes. In this way they produce and reproduce Palestinian national identity. There have been on several other art projects that focused on individual narratives rather than on general symbols: In 2014, \\"Humans of Al Rashidiya\\" portrayed ordinary residents online, inspired by the photoblog \\"Humans of New York\\", with the aim of countering clich√©s: > \\"Many people think that our camps are security time bombs, while others > haven‚Äôt even heard of us [..]. Stereotypes dating back to the Civil War > haven‚Äôt really faded away, [..] despite the fact that most of us have always > opposed all forms of violence.\\" Two years later, the Lebanese artist collective Dictaphone Group created the project Camp Pause, commissioned by the Beirut-based Dar El-Nimer foundation of Lebanese-Palestinian art collector Rami el-Nimer. It was exhibited at the Qalandia International Festival 2016 and at the 2017 CounterCurrent Festival in Houston, Texas. A video installation, which was contextualised by multidisciplinary research, centered on portraits of four Rashidieh residents around their everyday routes: > \\"Along the way, they weave narratives about the history of the land, their > arrival, the struggle to build, and everyday life in a camp situated away > from the city, bordered by agricultural fields and the sea. [..] We are > reminded through this project that the disregard of people‚Äôs pain and > personal choices, the casual racism and vilification of refugees in Lebanese > villages and towns, and the calls for grouping refugees in camps that are > easily controlled and ultimately attacked is nothing new. While the whole > world is busy discussing what they call the ‚Äúrefugee crisis,‚Äù we hope to > remember the importance of listening to those who are really in that crisis. > We also hope to remember that leaving people in limbo with few resources and > rights is not a solution but an absence of one.\\" Meanwhile, the French anthropologist Sylvain Perdigon - who lived in the Al Bass camp in 2006/2007 and has been a lecturer at the American University of Beirut (AUB) since 2013 - has researched another kind of a cultural phenomenon that he describes as \\"fairly ordinary\\" amongst many Palestianians in Lebanon: It haunts people in their dreams through different forms, interrupts their lives and is especially feared for causing miscarriages. Perdigon lays out one exemplary case of this phenomenon - which is known as Al Qreene - from Rashidieh: > \\"I heard Abu Ali tell of a still fresh encounter with al-Qreene during a > visit in 2014 to relatives in a Beirut flat. He comes from the secluded camp > of Rashidiyye where he lives and works as a foot soldier in the remnants of > the PLO armed forces inside the camp. The telling occurred at this point > when relatives are done with the business of sharing essential family news, > and the conversation starts to wander more lazily. A few months before, in > his mid-forties, Abu Ali had started to have dreams of being stuck by > himself in his own, emptied camp house with a cat walking in circles and > mewing plaintively. There was something unsettling to this cat, yet no > matter how hard Abu Ali tried, there also was no getting him out of the > house. The dream returned for weeks on end and what was only irksome, even a > bit funny, at first gradually turned into a liability as Abu Ali found > himself perpetually tired, unfocused, and less and less capable of holding > his guard duty properly. An old neighbor, upon hearing of Abu Ali‚Äôs dream > from his wife, recognized al-Qreene and advised him to heap small mounds of > salt in every corner of his house. Abu Ali followed her advice, the nagging > cat disappeared from his dreams, and his focus returned.\\" Notable people Samir El-Youssef (born 1965) writer and critic.

The Mac Suibhne family did not permanently settle in Ireland before the beginning of the 14th century, when they became Gallowglass soldiers for the Ua Domnaill dynasty of T√≠r Chonaill. The clan also claims an Irish descent from a prince of the U√≠ N√©ill dynasty, √Ånroth√°n Ua N√©ill, son of √Åed, son of Flaithbertach Ua N√©ill, King of Ailech and Cen√©l nE√≥gain, died 1036. Through this descent the clan can claim a descent from Niall Noig√≠allach (Niall of the Nine Hostages). Origins Leabhar Clainne Suibhne states that after √Åed's death, although his older brother Domnall was the rightful heir, √Ånroth√°n was chosen instead to be king. √Ånroth√°n then gave up the kingship to his brother and made for Argyll, Scotland where he married a daughter of the King of Scotland. √Ånroth√°n's great-grandson was Suibhne, from whom the clan derived its name. The history from Leabhar Clainne Suibhne may be a fabrication that provides the clan with a pedigree connecting them to the Milesian kings of Ireland, although historian W. D. H. Sellar believes this history may be genuine. MacSweens of Scotland Castle Sween, thought to have been built by Suibne, son of Dunslebh, son of Aodh of Buirche (Hugh the Splendid), son of √Ånroth√°n.Castle in the Sea, p.106 In the 13th century the MacSweens controlled lands across central Argyll, extending as far north as Loch Awe and as far south as Loch Fyne.Castle Sween Retrieved on 19 June 2007 Their principal seats included Lochranza Castle on the Isle of Arran, Skipness Castle and Castle Sween at Knapdale, which may be Scotland's oldest surviving stone-built castle. The MacSweens held this lordship of Knapdale and lands in Kintyre until 1262. That year Dugall MacSween granted to Walter Stewart, Earl of Menteith the lands of Skipnish (Skipness), Killislate (South Knapdale) and other lands in the parish of KilcalmonellThe Scots Peerage, p.130-131 in Kintyre. Following this the Earl granted several churches in Knapdale to the monastery of Kilwinning, showing that he now had control of both North and South Knapdale. Also in the same year Alexander III of Scotland granted Lochranza Castle to Walter Stewart, Earl of Menteith.Lochranza Retrieved on 26 June 2007 In 1263 Haakon IV of Norway sailed down the western coast of Scotland with an invasion fleet from Norway. With the arrival of the royal fleet Norse control in the Western Isles and Argyll was re-established, and the Norwegian king's force was strengthened by Islesmen. Among those pressed into his service were the deposed MacSweens of Knapdale, under Murchadh MacSween. The MacSweens seemed to have been of doubtful loyalty as they were forced to also surrender hostages to guarantee their support.Kingship and Unity, p.111-120. Haakon had 'given' Arran to Murchadh, but ultimately, the Norwegian invasion was defeated at what is known today as the Battle of Largs. The Earl of Menteith still controlled Knapdale in 1293, and in 1301 Knapdale was being held by his successor, Sir John Stewart (Sir John Menteith).The Kingdom of the Scots, p.373 It was then that John MacSween approached Edward I of England, asserting that one of the king's enemies, Sir John Menteith, had deprived MacSween of his inheritance. Between 1301 and 1310, John MacSween was in the service of the English in the hope of keeping alive his family's claim against the Menteiths.Robert Bruce, p.80 During the Great Cause, which led to the First War of Scottish Independence, the MacSweens were supporters of the powerful MacDougall Lords of LorneCASTLE SWEEN Retrieved on 26 June 2007 who supported John Balliol as patriots, as long as John was king of Scotland.Robert Bruce, p. 231 After the murder of John Comyn, the nephew of Balliol, by Bruce in 1306, the First War of Scottish Independence became at one and the same time a civil war. The Balliol and Comyn parties taking the side of the English in opposition to Bruce, crowned Robert I of Scotland on 25 March 1306. This was an era of constantly shifting alliances, and in 1301 John MacSween was in alliance with Aonghus √ìg Mac Domhnaill, Lord of Islay (died 1314√ó1318/c.1330) against the MacDougalls of Lorne.Robert Bruce, p. 239 In 1307 the MacDougalls were the bitterest of Robert the Bruce's enemies, and the man in command of the rebellion against Bruce was Sir John Menteith, who had previously removed the MacSweens from Knapdale. By 1310, when Bruce had most of Argyll and the North Channel in his favour, the English encouraged John MacDougall, the ousted Lord of Lorne, to raise a fleet in 1311, based on the eastern coast of Ireland.Robert Bruce, p.279 MacDougall was aided in part by the MacSweens, including John and his brothers Toirdelbach and Murdoch. It was around this time in 1310, that Edward II of England granted John and his brothers their family's ancestral lands of Knapdale,\\"Archaeological excavations at Castle Sween, Knapdale, Argyll & Bute, 1989-90\\" Retrieved on 4 July 2007 provided they could recover it from Sir John Menteith. It is possible, therefore, that this event could have been the \\"tryst of a fleet against Castle Sween\\", recorded in the Book of the Dean of Lismore, which tells of the failed attempt by John MacSween to recapture Castle Sween. With the failure to recapture their lands in Scotland, the MacSweens were forced to permanently leave for Ireland. A plate from The Image of Irelande, by John Derricke, published in 1581. The chief sitting at his table, entertained by his bard and harper is thought to be a \\"Mac Sweyne\\". A contingent of the MacSweens eventually re- established themselves at Donegal as Gallowglass mercenary soldiers and became the progenitors of Clan Sweeney. Some of those who stayed on in Scotland formed into the Clan MacQueen, a branch of whom later joined the powerful Chattan Confederation. According to Niall Campbell, 10th Duke of Argyll, other MacSweens who remained in Scotland became known as the MacEwens of Otter, whose chiefly line may have become extinct in the 17th century. Arrival in Ireland The earliest record of a Mac Suibhne, in relation to the clan, is of Murchadh Mac Suibne in 1267.Mac Sweeney Retrieved on 19 June 2007 Murchadh's father was M√°el Muire an Spar√°in of Castle Sween in Knapdale, who was himself the son of Suibne. Murchadh became a prisoner of Domnall √ì Conchobair and was handed over to the Earl of Ulster, in whose prison Murchadh is said to have died. Once established in Ireland the Clan Sween controlled large territories, and was divided into three branches: *Mac Suibhne F√°nad (Mac Sweeney Fanad) *Mac Suibhne na d'Tuath (Mac Sweeney Doe) *Mac Suibhne Boghaineach (Mac Sweeney Banagh) Rathmullan was the seat of MacSuibhne Fanad for the next 400 years, during which time their influence extended from Donegal into Connacht and Munster. In Donegal their principal seats were Doe Castle and Rahan Castle near Killybegs. In Scotland the inauguration of the MacSuibhne Clan chiefs had taken place at Iona, where they were also buried. In Ireland they were inaugurated in Kilmacrennan, County Donegal, where MacSuibhne Fanad became influential allies of the O'Donnell of Tyrconnell. The remains of the Sweeneys who went to Ireland are interred outside the walls of Castle Doe, Donegal. The historian James Logan, in The Scottish Ga√´l, remarked how the Mac Swineys were notable for their hospitality.The Scottish Ga√´l, p.336 At a seat of theirs, Clodach Castle, there was a stone set near the highway which was inscribed with an open invitation to travellers to make for Clodach for refreshment. At some point, one of the family overturned the stone and subsequently were said to have never prospered. Logan also noted that the war-cry of the Mac Sweins was \\"Battalia-abu\\" (The noble staff, victorious), from the battle-axe they bore in their Arms.The Scottish Ga√´l, p.200 Branches Mac Suibhne F√°nad (Mac Sweeney Fanad) F√°nad, is the peninsula between Lough Swilly and Mulroy Bay, on the north coast of County Donegal. The first Mac Suibhne to settle in T√≠r Conaill was Eoin, grandson of M√°el Muire. It was Eoin who expelled the ruling √ì Breisl√©ins from F√°nad after 1263, and whose daughter married the √ì Domnaill, king of T√≠r Conaill. The male line of the ruling Mac Suibhnes soon failed after Eoin, when both his son, Suibne, and his brother, Toirdelbach, died without heirs.Mac Sweeney Fanad Retrieved on 19 June 2007 Following the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314 Murchad Mear, great-grandson of M√°el Muire an Spar√°in and grandson of the Murchadh who died while a prisoner of the Earl of Ulster, arrived at Lough Swilly with his followers. Murchad Mear was succeeded by his son, Murchad √ìc, as lord of the lands east of Bearnas M√≥r. One of Murchad √ìc's sons, M√°el Muire, became lord of Fanad, and another son, Donnchad M√≥r, became lord of the Tri Tuatha in north west County Donegal, which had been conquered from the √ì B√°egills. M√°el Muire defeated Niall √ì Domhnaill in the battle of Achadh M√≥na but later became an ally of √ì Domhnaill, when Niall killed his brother, Conchobhar √ì Domhnaill, King of T√≠r Chonaill in 1342. Because of his aid, M√°el Muire was granted the lands of Moross in the north of Fanad. M√°el Muire's successor was his son, Toirdhealbhach Caoch, who pledged to √ì Domhnaill, that he and his successors would provide two Gallowglass soldiers for every quarter of land in his territory when the √ì Domhnaills went to war. Toirdhealbhach Caoch's son, Toirdhealbhach Ruadh, succeeded his father in 1399 but only after defeating two uncles who tried to wrest the lordship away from him. Toirdhealbhach Ruadh was aided against his uncles by Toirdhealbhach an Fh√≠ona √ì Domhnaill, king of T√≠r Conaill. Toirdhealbhach Ruadh accompanied Niall √ì Domhnaill and Domhnall √ì N√©ill, when they defeated the English Lord Deputy at Meath in 1423. Though there are contradicting sources that record Mac Suibhne of Connacht present at this battle. In 1434 Niall √ì Domhnaill was captured by the English forces in a skirmish, though Toirdhealbhach Ruadh rescued √ì Domhnaill following the defeat at the English's hands. In around 1438 Toirdhealbhach Ruadh is thought to have died, having ruled for thirty nine years. Afterwards his son, Ruaidhr√≠, succeeded him, though not without dispute. Ruaidhr√≠'s uncle, Donnchadh Garbh, claimed the lordship and the two resolved their differences in a wrestling match in which Ruaidhr√≠ was victorious. Ruaidhr√≠ ruled for thirteen years when he died and was succeeded by his brother, Domhnall. In 1456 √ânr√≠ √ì N√©ill, king of T√≠r Eoghain, with the sons of Neachtain √ì Domhnaill, invaded Inishowen. The invaders were opposed by the ruling √ì Domhnaill who was aided in part by Maol Mhuire Mac Suibhne, son of Toirdhealbhach Ruadh. √ì Domhnaill was later killed and Maol Mhuire and √ì Domhnaill's brother, Aodh Ruadh, were taken prisoner. Neachtain's son, Toirdhealbhach Cairbreach √ì Domhnaill, assumed the vacant kingship of T√≠r Conaill. Domhnall Mac Suibhne was then killed by his nephews (the sons of Ruaidhr√≠), who proclaimed Domhnall's cousin, Toirdhealbhach Bacach, as lord of Fanad. In 1460 Aodh Ruadh √ì Domhnaill and Maol Mhuire Mac Suibhne were released from captivity, and in the following year they both defeated Toirdhealbhach Cairbreach near Mulroy Bay. On the victory, Aodh Ruadh was inaugurated and made Maol Mhuire lord of Fanad. Maol Mhuire Mac Suibhne ruled for eleven years before being killed on Easter Tuesday, 1472 while fighting alongside Aodh Ruadh against √ânr√≠ √ì N√©ill. After the battle, Maol Mhuire's body was taken to Derry for burial, covered in the flag of Mac Domhnaill of Antrim, a captain of Gallowglass captured in the battle. Ruaidhr√≠ succeeded his deceased father and built Rathmullan castle. Ruaidhr√≠'s wife, M√°ire, was a daughter of √ì M√°ille, and was known for her piety. Ruaidhr√≠ and M√°ire built Carmelite priory at Rathmullan which was completed in 1516. Ruaidhr√≠ had many successful campaigns with √ì Domhnaill, though in 1497 Conn √ì Domhnaill was defeated in battle by Tadhg Diarmada and Ruaidhr√≠ was taken prisoner, also in the same year √ì Domhnaill was again defeated and Ruaidhr√≠'s son was captured. When Ruaidhr√≠ died in 1518 the lordship was again contested by members of the leading family. Domhnall √ìg, a cousin of Ruaidhr√≠, was proclaimed lord by the chiefs of Cen√©l Conaill at Kilmacrenan, but Ruaidhr√≠'s son, Toirdhealbhach, defied Domhnall √ìg. When Domhnall √ìg died in 1529 Toirdhealbhach had himself inaugurated at Kilmacrenan. This angered Aodh Dubh √ì Domhnaill, because he believed, only he alone had the right to inaugurate a sub chief of his. However in 1544 Toirdhealbhach was killed by the sons Domhnall √ìg Mac Suibhne, in revenge. It was during this era that Leabhar Clainne Suibhne was written. Domhnall √ìg's son, Ruaidhr√≠ Carrach, ruled for ten years until 1552 when he and his kin were killed. In 1557 a Domhnall Gorm Mac Suibhne was leader of \\"Sl√≠ocht Domhnaill\\" and was recorded as being with Calbhach √ì Domhnaill in a victory over Se√°n an D√≠omais √ì N√©ill. Domhnall Gorm was killed in 1568 by his kin and was succeeded by Toirdhealbhach √ìg who was a son of Toirdhealbhach who was killed in 1544. Toirdhealbhach √ìg was killed in battle in 1570 at D√∫n na Long on the Foyle, by Toirdhealbhach Luineach √ì N√©ill. Toirdhealbhach √ìg's brother, Domhnall, succeeded him and was the last chief inaugurated lord of Fanad. Domhnall lived into the 17th century and witnessed the end of the Gaelic order in T√≠r Conaill. In 1599 Domhnall was recorded as taking part in a raid into Thomond. In March 1601 an English garrison was stationed in Rathmullan and Domhnall submitted to the English. In September he rose against the English but by January 1602 he had again submitted. In 1607 when √ì N√©ill and Ruaidhr√≠ √ì Domhnaill sailed out of Rathmullan, some of the crew had gone ashore to collect water and Domhnall's son attacked the crew but were routed. In 1608 Domhnall was recorded as being on a list of jurors who indicted the earls of Tyrconnell and Tyrone for treason. For this Domhnall received a grant in the Plantation of Ulster. By 1619 he is recorded as having allotted to him, called Roindoberg and Caroocomony, on which he \\"built a good bawne, and a house, all of lime and stone, in which with his family, he dwelleth.\\" Domhnall's son, Dormhnall Gorm, married a daughter of Eoghan √ìg Mac Suibhne na dTuath and had ten children, before dying in 1637. Dormhnall Gorm's sons, Domhnall √ìg and Aodh Buidhe are recorded having lands in Clondavaddog in north Fanad, held forfeit after the Irish Rebellion of 1641. Mac Suibhne na d'Tuath (Mac Sweeney Doe) Castle Doe, Barmkin and Keep. Na Tr√≠ Tuatha or Tuatha Toraighe, which was an area west of Fanad (modern day parishes of Gweedore and Tory Island), was controlled by the √ì Baegill until just after 1360, when it was conquered by Clann tSuibhne (Clan Sweeney).Mac Sweeney Doe Retrieved on 26 June 2007 Donnchadh M√≥r, who was son of Murchad √ìc, and grandson of Murchad Mear, was the first Suibhne na d'Tuath. Donnchadh's father and grandfather had conquered large tracts of land in T√≠r Conaill in about 1314. In 1359 when √ì Conchobhair defeated S√©an √ì Domhnaill, Donnchadh M√≥r's son, Eoghan Connachtach, was held captive by the son of √ì Conchobhair Shligigh. Later Eoghan was able to help S√©an √ì Domhnaill defeat Toirdhealbhach an Fh√≠ona √ì Domhnaill in battle, at Sliabh Malair. Eoghan died as they plundered Glencolumkille \\"as a result of his violating the monastery there\\". According to the Book of Ballymote, Eoghan's son, Toirdealbhach √ìg was lord of Na Tuatha. Another of Eoghan's sons drowned in 1413. Little more is known of Mac Suibhne na d'Tuath until the middle of the 16th century. In 1543 MacSuibhne na d'Tuath and his brother, Brian, were held as prisoners at Inis Mhic an Doirn (Ruthland Island, parish of Templecrone). By 1545 MacSuibhne na d'Tuath had died the lordship was taken over by his son, Eoghan √ìg, who was killed fighting in 1554 at Ceann Salach (in Cloghaneely). The lordship then passed to his son, Murchadh Mall, who in 1567 aided Sir Aodh √ì Domhnaill defeat S√©an an D√≠omuis √ì N√©ill, in battle, near Letterkenny. Murchadh Mall and Mac Suibhne F√°nad (Toirdealbhach √ìg) were killed in 1570 by Clann Domhnaill Gall√≥glaigh, at Dun na Long near Strabane. After his death, Murchadh, was succeeded by his brother, Eoghan √ìg. In 1588 the English were concerned that Eoghan √ìg was aiding stranded Spaniards from the Armada. In 1590 Eoghan √ìg gave protection to Brian √ì Ruairc of Breifne, after √ì Ruairc's defeat at the hands of the English. In 1592 Eoghan √ìg attended the inauguration of Aodh Ruadh √ì Domhnaill as lord of T√≠r Conaill. Eoghan √ìg died in 1596 and was succeeded by, Maol Mhuire, a nephew (son of Murchadh Mall). The last lord of Na Tuatha was Maol Mhuire. In early 1598 Maol Mhuire took the side of the English against Aodh Ruadh √ì Domhnaill but was defeated and was consequently banished from his lands by √ì Domhnaill. In May 1600 Maol Mhuire was knighted for his support of the English, though later in the same year he had switched sides, sided with √ì Domhnaill, and was then captured by the English. Maol Mhuire was then held prisoner on a ship on the River Foyle, near Derry, but managed to escape with the aid of a prostitute. Maol Mhuire's grandson, Colonel Maol Mhuire Mac Suibhne, was a leading rebel in the Irish Rebellion of 1641, who had his lands in Dunlewy (in the parish of Gweedore) held forfeit for his actions. Mac Suibhne Boghaineach (Mac Sweeney Banagh) Mac Sweeney Banagh, according to Leabhar Clainne Suibhne, were descended from Dubhghall Mac Suibhne, who received the lands of T√≠r Boghaine from his grandfather Murchadh Mear who died in ca.1320. Boghaine consisted of the modern barony of Banagh in south-west Co. Donegal and part of Boylagh.Mac Sweeney Banagh Retrieved on 20 June 2007 There are contradictory sources for early history of Mac Suibhne Boghaineach. In the Book of Ballymote (c. 1400), six of Dubhghall's grandsons are said to belong to the Mac Suibhne of Connacht. The eldest of the grandsons, Toirdhealbhach was also listed as the High Constable of Connacht and was killed with two of his brothers, Donn Sl√©ibhe and Donnchadh in 1397. By the 16th century the Mac Suibhne Boghaineach was seated at Rahan Castle, (near Dunkineely in Co. Donegal). In 1524 Niall M√≥r mac Eoghain (Mac Suibhne Th√≠re Boghaine) died here, and who was described as \\"a constable of hardest hand.\\" Also at Rahan, Niall M√≥r mac Eoghain's son Maol Mhuire M√≥r, lord of Banagh, was killed by another son, Niall √ìg, in 1535. Killybegs (Irish Gaelic: Na Cealla Beaga, meaning 'the small churches'), was also controlled by Mac Suibhne Boghaineach. In 1513 Killybegs was plundered by Eoghan √ì M√°ille and the crews of three ships, who were, however, unable to return home to Connacht with their prisoners because of stormy weather. Though the leaders of Banagh were away in √ì Domhnaill's army at the time, a youth, called Brian Mac Suibhne, along with some shepherds and farmers, rescued the prisoners and slew Eoghan √ì M√°ille. Another raid was recorded in 1547, in which the Mac Suibhnes were able to drive off another landing at Rathlin O'Beirne. In 1547 Niall √ìg was killed at Badhbhdh√∫n Nua by the sons of Maol Mhuire (the brother he slew in 1535). After this, Niall √ìg, was succeeded by Toirdhealbhach Meirgeach Mac Suibhne. By 1550 Toirdhealbhach Meirgeach was killed at Baile Mhic Suibhne, by the Clann Coinneig√©in. Ruaidhr√≠ Ballach Mac Suibhne then requested to Maghnus √ì Domhnaill to be installed as lord of Banagh, but was refused. In retaliation, Ruaidhr√≠ Ballach then plundered Killybegs. Ruaidhr√≠ Ballach was killed by a Maol Mhuire, who then became the rightful lord. In 1581 Maol Mhuire and his sons, Murchadh and Toirdhealbhach Meirgeach, and many kinsman were killed fighting under Aodh √ì Domhnaill, against Toirdhealbhach Luineach √ì N√©ill at Kiltole (near Raphoe). The lordship then passed to a son of Maol Mhuire, Maol Mhuire √ìg who was soon killed, in 1582, by a group of Scots who were present at a meeting near Lough Foyle between √ì Neill and √ì Domhnaill. The next lord was Brian √ìg (a son of the Maol Mhuire killed in 1535). Brian √ìg was then killed by Niall Meirgeach (son of Maol Mhuire who died in 1581). Niall Meirgeach, like those before him, didn't last long and was killed in 1588 at the island of Derryness in the barony of Boylagh, by Donnchadh (son of Maol Mhuire Meirgeach, who died in 1564). In 1590 when Aodh Ruadh √ì Domhnaill (Red Hugh O'Donnell) was held in Dublin Castle, his half-brother, Domhnall, attempted to wrest T√≠r Conaill from his father Aodh. Aodh Ruadh's mother in response mustered a large force of Scots and also the Mac Suibhne branches of Na Tuatha and Fanad to oppose Domhnall. During this time Donnchadh. lord of Banagh took Domhnall's side, along with √ì Baoighill. The opposing forces met near Glencolumbkille, in September 1590, and Domhnall's force was defeated. By 1592 Aodh Ruadh was in power of T√≠r Conaill and it seems as if Donnchadh was pardoned for opposing him, as Donnchadh was present at Aodh Ruadh's inauguration at Kilmacrenan. In late 1601 Mac Suibhne's Castle was taken by the English, and then recaptured by √ì Domhnaill. In November Donnchadh submitted to Niall Garbh √ì Domhnaill, who was on the side of the English. In 1608 Donnchadh was part of the jury that indicted √ì N√©ill and Ruaidh√≠ √ì Domhnaill, earl of T√≠rconnell, after they fled from Rathmullan in 1607. During the era of the plantations in Ulster, Donnchadh was allotted in the barony of Kilmacrenan, Donegal. In 1641 Donnchadh's son, Niall Meirgeach, was killed in a skirmish near Killybegs by settlers who were under Andrew Knox.

Cambridge University Press, 1977. . The organization serves as a point of contact between the main city government and the city's residents, through functions such as publishing community newsletters to communicate civic and political issues to the community, making advisory recommendations to the citywide government on the community's needs and its views on governmental policies and issues, and direct participation in the management of neighborhood projects and facilities. Neighborhood councils do not have direct legislative power of their own. Neighborhood councils often act in concert with local schools, churches, political organizations, and recreational organizations in keeping all members of the community informed of current issues and activities. A typical neighborhood council executive comprises a president, a vice-president, a secretary, a treasurer (these two roles are often carried out by the same person), a representative to the municipal council, and one or more members which represent other community organizations. Depending on the model in place, executive members may be elected either generally by members of the community at large, or internally within the league's pool of active volunteers and members. Other services the councils provide can include meeting and recreation space for the members of the community, typically a community hall, an ice skating rink, a playground, and so on. Neighborhood councils can be found in many cities throughout the world, especially but not exclusively in large metropolitan cities. The concept is similar but not identical to neighborhood associations, in that while a neighborhood association is generally a private non-profit organization, a neighborhood council is a governmental structure in which multiple distinct neighborhood associations may be participants. History The concept has its origins in the 19th-century emergence of \\"social centers\\" or \\"city clubs\\", community organizations which were formed in the northeastern United States to provide a forum for citizens to engage in debate on local political issues. In 1917, the city of Edmonton, Alberta, became one of the first cities in the world to directly formalize social centers as a local government structure, when George Hall, a native of Providence, Rhode Island, who had been hired as the city's commissioner of industry in 1912, began implementing a local system of community leagues to assist in addressing the rapidly growing city's social development challenges. Canada Edmonton, Alberta is noted as having strong system of community leagues. The first community league in Edmonton (the Crestwood community league) was formed in 1917. Now there are 157 community leagues in the city (as of 2017) that are overseen by the Edmonton Federation of Community Leagues. In addition to Edmonton, other cities in Canada that have systems of neighbourhood councils include Greater Sudbury and Quebec City.Andrew Sancton and Robert A. Young, Foundations of Governance: Municipal Government in Canada's Provinces. University of Toronto Press, 2009. . Greater Sudbury formed its community action networks in 2001, when the former towns and cities of the Regional Municipality of Sudbury were amalgamated into the current city government, while Quebec City has had a system of neighbourhood councils, or conseils de quartier, since the early 1980s.Andrew Sancton and Robert A.

United States In the United States, such councils are active in cities like Los Angeles, California; Tacoma, Washington; and San Diego, California.

From there, Sikyea grew up in the mission in Fort Resolution until he was 18; in 1923, he married Rose Benaya (Wennaya). While he spent most of his life living on the land traditionally: trapping, hunting and fishing at Moose Bay, southeast of Yellowknife, he also worked part-time for 16 years at Con Mine. As well, Sikyea worked seven years at Giant Mine. In 1963, he moved to Ndil«´, where he and his wife lived until they moved to Aven Manor, a senior citizens facility in Yellowknife,Avons Seniors in 1995. During his time in Ndil«´, Sikyea was both a councillor and a council advisor; he also was a signatory on Treaty 11, and raised awareness about indigenous rights by teaching others about the treaty. The story of the million dollar duck begins in the late 1960s when Sikyea shot a female mallard duck out of season; he was subsequently reported and taken to court. The result of this was that he was fined $1, while the government had to pay the bill for the over $1 million in court costs. Thus, he had started some of the fight for indigenous and treaty rights before such a thing existed, and won. Sikyea's contribution to Ndil«´ is recognized through the community deciding to name the road that leads into Ndil«´ after him. He died December 21, 2002. References * External links *1962 Regina v.

Members of the band had previously played in other groups, including London SS and Hollywood Brats. After recording four studio albums and eight singles, as well as recording Christmas themed music under the name The Yobs, they disbanded in the summer of 1982. The band reformed in 1999, and released a new album in 2014. History The Boys came together when singer/guitarist Matt Dangerfield left the punk band London SS in September 1975 to form a new band with ex-Hollywood Brats keyboard player Casino Steel. Dangerfield‚Äôs art college friend, guitarist Honest John Plain, was recruited and in June 1976, two of Plain‚Äôs co-workers at a T-shirt printing company, bassist Duncan \\"Kid\\" Reid and drummer Jack Black, completed the line-up. Steel (ex-Hollywood Brats) and Dangerfield played in the London SS together. The band's early recordings were made in a home recording studio which Dangerfield had set up in his rented basement apartment in Maida Vale. The band played their first concert at the Hope and Anchor pub in Islington, London on 15 October 1976. Among the crowd were Mick Jones, Billy Idol, Tony James and Gene October. After a few concerts, The Boys signed to NEMS in January 1977, and at that time the only British punk band to have a record deal - the Sex Pistols having been sacked by EMI on 6 January 1977 and the Damned having initially signed a one single deal with Stiff for New Rose, which had been released in October 1976. Their first release was the single \\"I Don't Care\\", and in support of that release, they toured with John Cale of Velvet Underground. Their 16-track debut album, The Boys, was recorded in early May 1977, but commercial release was delayed until 9 September 1977. The album reached No. 50 in the UK Album Charts. A second single, \\"First Time\\" ‚Äî with a theme of losing virginity ‚Äî was released on 27 July 1977. As a result, John Peel invited The Boys to record a live session for his show, which became 'Single Of The Week' in Sounds magazine. The single was steadily climbing the chart, until August 1977. The Boys released a second album on NEMS, titled Alternative Chartbusters, and toured in support of it with the Ramones. The Boys then signed with Safari in 1979, and two albums and five singles followed before the band broke up in the summer of 1981. Each Christmas, the group rearranged the \\"B\\" and the \\"Y\\" in their name and became The Yobs, releasing four singles and one album; 1980s Christmas Album. In this incarnation, the band members used the pseudonyms Noddy Oldfield, Ebenezer Polak, Kid Vicious and H. J. Bedwetter. On 31 July and 1 August 1999, four out of five original members, along with Steve \\"Vom\\" Ritchie (replacing Jack Black on drums, who was busy with his own band) played concerts in Japan. In September 2000, this new lineup played at the 'Holidays in the Sun Festival' in Bilbao, Spain. Original drummer Jack Black made a guest appearance and filmed the concert. It was the first time in 18 years that the five original band members had been reunited on stage. In 2006, the band again performed concerts, including their first shows in London in 25 years. Following their reunion tour in London, one of the Boys' early songs, \\"Jimmy Brown\\", was released as a single in December 2008. In June 2014 The Boys released their first new studio album since 1981, Punk Rock Menopause, on Wolverine Records.\\"Album Review: The Boys ‚Äì ‚ÄúPunk Rock Menopause‚Äù\\". New Noise Magazine.

The band set off on a cultural tour of China hosted by Shanghai-based punk band Round Eye. Along the way they played three underground gigs promoted by word of mouth, gave a number of interviews, were the subject of a one-hour documentary on top TV channel in Beijing, and recorded a live album ‚Äì \\"Undercover - Live in China\\", which was released by Action Records on 1 July 2015. Legacy The Boys achieved limited commercial success, but their music has influenced the development of other bands. German punk band Die Toten Hosen performed cover versions of their music regularly for more than a decade. They also recorded cover versions of some songs, namely \\"First Time\\" for their album Auf dem Kreuzzug ins Gl√ºck - 125 Jahre die Toten Hosen and \\"Brickfield Nights\\" for the cover album Learning English, Lesson One. On the rear of the cover of The Jam's 1978 album All Mod Cons, the photograph of Paul Weller's Rickenbacker 330 guitar carries a The Boys sticker. In the mid 1990s, Los Angeles based power pop band, Amanda Jones, covered the song, \\"First Time \\". Later that decade, Japanese band Thee Michelle Gun Elephant had a hit with a Boys cover. This prompted the re- release of several Boys albums, and more than 30,000 albums were sold in Japan alone. A Boys tribute album was also released featuring 13 bands from around the world. The Boys also influenced the cult power pop band The Exploding Hearts, who performed and recorded in the early 2000s.

One intriguing move he made was to hire an Inuit carver to make soapstone carvings of prominent murder cases he presided over throughout the Far North; he was inspired to do this when he ruled in the favour of traditional justice in the case of a young boy, and the boy presented him with a soapstone carving after the trial.

The TIA-MC-1 was developed in Vinnytsia, Ukraine by the Ekstrema-Ukraina company in the mid-1980s under the leadership of V.B. Gerasimov. The machine was manufactured by the production association Terminal and some other factories.  Games  Some of the TIA-MC-1 based games are: * –ê–≤—Ç–æ–≥–æ–Ω–∫–∏ (Avtogonki, Autoracing) * –ë–∏–ª–ª–∏–∞—Ä–¥ (Billiard, a pool-like game) * –ó–≤—ë–∑–¥–Ω—ã–π —Ä—ã—Ü–∞—Ä—å (Zvezdnyi Rytsar, Star Knight) * –ò—Å—Ç—Ä–µ–±–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å (Istrebiteli, Fighter Jet, Harrier) * –ö–æ–Ω—ë–∫-–ì–æ—Ä–±—É–Ω–æ–∫ (Konek-Gorbunok, The Humpbacked Horse by Pyotr Pavlovich Yershov) * –ö–æ—Ç-—Ä—ã–±–æ–ª–æ–≤ (Kot-Rybolov, Cat the fisher) * –ö–æ—Ç–∏–≥–æ—Ä–æ—à–∫–æ (Kotigoroshko, title of a Russian fairy tale) * –û—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤ –¥—Ä–∞–∫–æ–Ω–∞ (Ostrov Drakona, Dragon Island) * –û—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤ —Å–æ–∫—Ä–æ–≤–∏—â (Ostrov Sokrovish, Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson) * –°–Ω–µ–∂–Ω–∞—è –∫–æ—Ä–æ–ª–µ–≤–∞ (Snezhnaja koroleva, The Snow Queen by Hans Christian Andersen) * S.O.S. The Konek-Gurbunok game is comparable to The Legend of Zelda and included environments such as forests and castles.  Technical specifications  The arcade machine consists of several boards called BEIA (Russian:–ë–≠–ò–ê, –ë–ª–æ–∫ –≠–ª–µ–º–µ–Ω—Ç–æ–≤ –ò–≥—Ä–æ–≤–æ–≥–æ –ê–≤—Ç–æ–º–∞—Ç–∞, Blok Elementov Igrovogo Automata). The boards have the following purposes: * BEIA-100: data processing; RGB DAC; sound generation; coin-op and game controller interface * BEIA-101: video sync and background generation * BEIA-102: sprite generation * BEIA-103: game ROM and main RAM Games in a TIA- MC-1 arcade machine can be switched by replacing the BEIA-103 module, not unlike cartridges in video game consoles. Main system characteristics are as follows: * CPU: –ö–†580–í–ú80–ê (clone of Intel 8080), 1.78 MHz * Video resolution: 256√ó256, 4 bits per pixel selectable from a palette of 256 colors ** Background: two video pages composed of 32√ó32 tiles, each tile is 8√ó8 pixels. Tile RAM can store 256 separate tiles. ** Sprites: up to 16 simultaneously displayed hardware-generated sprites; total of 256 sprites can be stored in sprite ROM. Sprites can be vertically and horizontally mirrored in hardware. * Sound: two –ö–†580–í–ò53 interval timers (Intel 8253) driving a mono speaker. * Display: 20\\" (51 cm) TV screen * Main RAM ‚Äî 8KiB. * Character RAM ‚Äî 8KiB. * Video RAM ‚Äî 2KiB. * Sprite ROM ‚Äî 32KiB. * ROM with game code and background graphics ‚Äî up to 56KiB.  Emulation  For a long time the TIA-MC-1 hardware remained unemulated due to a lack of technical information and ROM dumps. Soon after the Russian emulation community obtained technical documentation and ROM dumps of one of the games, Konek-Gorbunok, the first emulator named TIA-MC Emulator was released on July 27, 2006. A TIA-MC-1 driver was included in MAME on August 21, 2006 (since version 0.108). By now, only five games (Konek- Gorbunok, S.O.S., Billiard, Snezhnaja koroleva, Kot-Rybolov) are dumped and supported by emulators. An ongoing search for other games is in progress.

PACER, an acronym for Public Access to Court Electronic Records, is an interface to the same system for public use. History and associated applications CM/ECF was first implemented in 1996 in the Northern District of Ohio to handle a large number of asbestos cases. Pilot programs were implemented in the Western District of Missouri, the Eastern District of New York and the District of Oregon in late 1997. National rollout of the system started in bankruptcy courts in 2001, 2002 in district courts, and in 2004 in appellate courts. CM/ECF is not used in state courts, but several states have moved toward implementation of comparable systems for at least some cases. As of January 2012, there were \\"some two hundred\\" courts running CM/ECF. PACER (Public Access to Court Electronic Records), the Federal Judiciary's electronic public access system, still provides access to docket entries as it did before CM/ECF; however, CM/ECF allows for access to pleadings, motion papers, briefs, and other documents filed by the parties and attorneys in the case (with the exception of any documents permitted to be filed under seal or in camera). For most documents, an access charge of $0.10 per page is levied to defray the cost of maintaining the system. In compliance with the E-Government Act of 2002, written opinions that \\"set forth a reasoned explanation for a court's decision\\" are free of charge. To facilitate online access, courts implementing CM/ECF require attorneys to file copies of most litigation papers electronically, instead of or in addition to the traditional filing of paper copies. Operational description The main purpose of the system is to fulfill the legal obligation of the Clerk of Court as custodian of court records. Each case is assigned a number in the format D:YY-TT-SSSSS where D=Division Office (most districts are split into divisions), YY=Year, TT=Type (e.g. bk=bankruptcy, cv=civil, cr=criminal), SSSSS=Sequence number. The case number does not contain any type of court identifier. The main list of the case is the docket sheet. The docket sheet contains a chronological list of each filing and any associated documents (in PDF format) in the case. Each record includes the filing date, docket text, and a link to filed documents. Events can link to past events. Example docket text: \\"Hearing Held on #18 Motion for Relief from Stay to Proceed With Foreclosure Action Against 123 Corporate Drive, Anytown, Pennsylvania. Filed by ABC Bank Represented by DEWEY CHEATEM (Counsel). ORDER ENTERED (T., Jason) (Entered: 03/01/2007)\\"‚Äîsee this sample CM/ECF docket sheet. The application CM/ECF is a web-based application that is written mainly in Perl and Java, which generates HTML with JavaScript for some client side validation. The software runs under Solaris or Red Hat Linux OS using Apache webserver. Most courts have moved to a Linux server. An Informix SQL database is used to store the data. In general, the software is fairly simple and easily maintained. All documents are required to be filed in the PDF format. Other file types may be encapsulated inside PDF files, e.g. audio files in MP3 format, or video files. CM/ECF plans to require PDF/A compliant files to meet the requirements of the National Archives and Records Administration. Each court will set its own deadline for requiring documents to be filed in the PDF/A format. No warning period is planned.CM/ECF to Transition to PDF/AFAQ PDF/A in CM/ECF Extensive changes were made in version 3.3 to use Yahoo!'s YUI library. This has increased the complexity of the version 3.2 code. The 3.3 application sports a more modern interface with drop down menus and no frame. Much of the 3.2 simple HTML user interface is still available depending on the menu items selected. The system is decentralized with each court running its own servers and its own copy of the software. Each court has a live server and separate training and test servers. The test server is used to make changes and install new versions before \\"going to live.\\" The training server allows users to learn how to use CM/ECF without affecting live cases. While the application is developed and maintained centrally by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, local staff members configure the application specifically for the local court to conform to local rules and practices. Since source code can be modified locally, there is some variability in the application between districts. Most local changes are cosmetic and do not change the core functionality of the application. The database design centers on the case record and each case record has multiple related records. For example, the \\"party\\" table lists parties to the case‚ÄîPlaintiff, Defendant, Debtor, etc. In a bankruptcy case the Trustee, US Trustee, and certain creditors can become parties to a case. Each party is either pro se or has one or more counsel (attorney) listed. A party can also have a list of aliases, e.g., \\"Winona Judd DBA 'The Judds'\\". This feature allows name searches to find the case.

Slobodkina was a celebrated avant garde artist and feminist in the middle part of the 20th century. Biography Esphyr Slobodkina (ESS-phere sloh-BOD-kee-nah) was born in Chelyabinsk, Russia in 1908.Ari L. Goldman, \\"Esphyr Slobodkina, Artist And Author, Is Dead at 93,\\" New York Times, July 27, 2002. During the Russian Revolution of 1917, she emigrated with her family to Harbin, Manchuria (China), where she studied art and architecture. Slobodkina immigrated to the United States in 1928. She enrolled at the National Academy of Design. It was there that she met her future husband, Russian-born Ilya Bolotowsky (they divorced in 1938). Along with Ilya, Slobodkina was a founding member of the American Abstract Artists group, which began amid controversy in 1936. Like other Russian modernists, surrounded by ancient icons and a rich craft tradition, Slobodkina developed a lifelong appreciation of clear, rich colors, and flat, stylized forms. According to her biography on the HarperCollins website, Front cover of Caps for Sale, 1940 In the late 1930s, Slobodkina began to write and illustrate her own children's books. Among her 24 published works Caps for Sale (1940) is considered a children's book classic; it has sold more than two million copies and has been translated into more than a dozen languages. Caps for Sale won the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award in 1958. Other children's works include The Wonderful Feast (written in 1928, first published in 1955), The Clock (1956), The Long Island Ducklings (1961), and Pezzo the Peddler and the Circus Elephant (1967), reissued as Circus Caps for Sale (2002). In 1948, feeling the need to get out of New York City and having saved some money, Slobodkina built a house in Great Neck, New York and moved there with her mother; they remained in the house until 1977. According to the Sullivan Goss art gallery website, Slobodkina died in 2002. Work Through the 1930s Slobodkina developed her unique method of working in oils; a flattened, abstracted style that incorporated line, suspended or interlocking forms. But by the late 30s and 40s Slobodkina was using a variety of techniques and materials. Many of her works are collages and constructions, integrating paint, wood, plastic, and metal with everyday objects such as parts of disassembled typewriters and computers into amusing and often great art. Slobodkina's work eventually received high acclaim. In 1943, Slobodkina was included in Peggy Guggenheim's show Exhibition by 31 Women at the Art of This Century gallery in New York. ‚ÄúHer life‚Äôs work pulled imagery and objects together into magnificent compositions time and time again,\\" stated Harold Porcher, an authority on Slobodkina's art. \\"I equate an artist like Esphyr to the American mockingbird. A mockingbird borrows and embellishes the songs of other birds around him. Often he changes the phrasing as he incorporates each element into an orchestration of birdsong. The abstract expressionist movement shifted the center of the art world from Paris to New York City, where it remains today. Slobodkina was a member of the early founders of American Abstract Artists which help to establish abstraction as a viable form of expression in America. In the last years of the 20th century, Slobodkina continued her productivity, alternating serious work on abstract paintings with the more relaxing activities ‚Äî to her ‚Äî of creating sculpture, wall hangings, multimedia constructions, dolls and jewelry, often made out of old typewriter and computer parts. As Anne Cohen DePietro wrote, \\"Traversing nearly a century of inspiration, it is Slobodkina‚Äôs enduring delight in the creative act and her single-minded pursuit of her aesthetic vision in a multiplicity of media that continues to enchant.\\"Anne Cohen DePietro, \\"\\"Esphyr Slobodkina,\\" Slobodkina Foundation website. Legacy In April 2000, at age 91, Slobodkina established the Slobodkina Foundation, dedicated to the conservation, preservation, and exhibition of art. The Slobodkina Foundation was designed to educate the public about Slobodkina's work and encourage others to pursue their dreams through awareness of Slobodkina's accomplishments. Before her death in 2002, Slobodkina redesigned her home in Long Island, New York, as a mini-museum and reading room for children, a place where guests viewed more than 500 works of art for more than ten years. Although, the Slobodkina Home was sold out of necessity in 2011, the charitable Slobodkina Foundation continues to preserve the legacy of Slobodkina's prolific, multifaceted career. Her paintings, sculptures and literary works are part of the collections of The Metropolitan Museum, New York; the Smithsonian; the Philadelphia Museum of Art; the Heckscher Museum of Art; Hillwood Art Museum, the Whitney Museum, New York; the Northeast Children's Literature Collection, Thomas J. Dodd Research Center, University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut; the Corcoran Gallery, Washington, DC; the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; the de Grummond Children's Literature Collection, The University of Southern Mississippi; the New York Public Library; among others.

History Congress established the Medical Service of the Continental Army on July 27, 1775, and placed a \\"Chief physician & director general\\" of the Continental Army as its head. The first five surgeons general of the U.S. Army served under this title. An Act of Congress of May 28, 1789, established a \\"Physician general\\" of the U.S. Army. Only two physicians, doctors Richard Allison and James Craik, served under this nomenclature. A Congressional Act of March 3, 1813, cited the \\"Physician & surgeon general\\" of the U.S. Army. That nomenclature remained in place until the Medical Department was established by the Reorganization Act of April 14, 1818. Additionally, physicians assigned to the U.S. Army were not accorded military rank until 1847.

Letters of recommendation are typically related to employment (such a letter may also be called an employment reference or job reference), admission to institutions of higher education, or scholarship eligibility. Recommendation letters are usually specifically requested to be written about someone, and are therefore addressed to a particular requester (such as a new employer, university admissions officer, etc.), although they may also be issued to the person being recommended without specifying an addressee. References may also be required of companies seeking to win contracts, particularly in the fields of engineering, consultancy, industry and construction, and with regard to public procurement and tenders. Reference letters for organizations are used to assess its ability to deliver the required level of service. Some applications, such as professional schools give applicants the choice to waive their right to view their letters or not. Usually, applicants are encouraged to waive their rights because if they do not, it is a sign they are not confident in their recommenders.  Referee  The person providing a reference is called a referee. An employment reference letter is usually written by a former employer or manager, but references can also be requested from co-workers, customers and vendors. Teachers and professors often supply references for students who have taken their classes. Reference letters for organizations are usually supplied by parties to which the company has provided similar services in the past.  Content  The employment reference letter can cover topics such as:Peter H√§usermann: Arbeitszeugnisse ‚Äì wahr, klar und fair. Tipps und Anregungen f√ºr verantwortungsbewusste Arbeitgeber. 6. Auflage. Spektramedia, Z√ºrich 2008, * the employee's tasks and responsibilities * the duration of employment or tasks/ responsibilities * the position relative to the author of the reference letter * the employee's abilities, knowledge, creativity, intelligence * the employee's qualifications (foreign languages, special skills) * the employee's social attitude * the employee's power of rapport * reason(s) of employment termination * some text with the actual recommendation itself (e.g. 'I unequivocally recommend ... [name] as a ... [function/ role] and would be happy to hire him/ her again').  Language  In some countries, elements of performance are evaluated using established forms of expression, sometimes euphemistic. For example, in the German-language Arbeitszeugnis, the following terms are frequently used:G√ºnter Huber, Waltraud M√ºller: Das Arbeitszeugnis in Recht und Praxis. Rechtliche Grundlagen, Musterzeugnisse, Textbausteine, Zeugnisanalyse. 12. Auflage. Haufe, Freiburg/Breisgau, Berlin, Planegg bei M√ºnchen, W√ºrzburg 2009, * Excellent = stets zu unserer vollsten Zufriedenheit erledigt (always done to our complete satisfaction) * Good = stets zu unserer vollen Zufriedenheit (always to our full satisfaction) * Satisfactory = zu unserer vollen Zufriedenheit (to our full satisfaction) * Adequate = zu unserer Zufriedenheit (to our satisfaction) * Poor = hat sich bem√ºht, den Anforderungen gerecht zu werden (has endeavored to meet the demands) This language established itself as an unwritten code in the employment world. Its purpose was to give even weakly performing employees a letter of recommendation that does not sound negative. However, the euphemistically glazed-over descriptions are now codified and generally known, so that the original cryptic intent is no longer served. Thorsten Knobbe, Mario Leis, Karsten Umnu√ü: Arbeitszeugnisse: Textbausteine und T√§tigkeitsbeschreibungen (dt./engl.). 5. Auflage. Haufe, Freiburg/Breisgau, Berlin, Planegg bei M√ºnchen, W√ºrzburg 2010, . Nonetheless, it is still standard to use this codified language.  Checking of references  Most potential employers will contact referees to obtain references before offering a job to a new employee. A survey by the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) found that eight out of ten resource professionals said they regularly conduct reference checks for professional (89%), executive (85%), administrative (84%) and technical (81%) positions. Candidates are advised to ensure that they provide a suitable list of referees to their new prospective employer or institution, and to contact those referees to ensure that they are able and willing to provide a suitable reference. In some cases employers will contact a candidate's former company for a reference even if no contact is supplied by the candidate. Duty to provide a reference Some employers may not be willing to provide reference letters because they may be worried about potential lawsuits. In this case, the employer may only provide the job title, dates of employment and salary history for the employee. Finland, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, HungarySee Section 81 of the Labour Code and Bulgaria are the only countries in Europe where employees can legally claim an employment reference, including the right to a correct, unambiguous and benevolent appraisal.Heinz-G√ºnther Dachrodt, Erich Ullmann: Zeugnisse lesen und verstehen. Formulierungen und ihre Bedeutung. √ñGB-Verlag Wien 2000, While there is no common law duty to provide a reference,Lawton v BOC Transhield Ltd, [1987] 2 All ER 608 the Supreme Court of Canada has held that a refusal to do so may constitute \\"conduct that is unfair or is in bad faith\\" with respect to a wrongful dismissal, and thus \\"indicative of the type of conduct that ought to merit compensation by way of an addition to the notice period.\\", subsequently affirmed in There is a duty of care to ensure that, where one is provided, it is accurate and fair and not give a misleading impression, as held by the House of Lords in Spring v Guardian Assurance plc. If an employer goes beyond what a reference should contain, or if it gives inaccurate or misleading information, liability may arise in the areas of breach of statutory duty, negligent misstatement, deceit, defamation or malicious falsehood. It does not matter what form the reference might take. In the United Kingdom, references received by an employer from another person or organization can be disclosed to the person about whom they are written under the subject access provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998, but certain confidentiality considerations apply as to the identity of the person giving the reference. As a result, together with the duty of care under Spring, many organizations have issued guidance as to best practice to be undertaken by reference providers. The duty of care has also been held to apply in non-reference situations, as noted in 2011 in McKie v Swindon College., discussing In another case, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales has held that \\"a reference must not give an unfair or misleading impression overall, even if its discrete components are factually correct.\\" However, while a reference must be accurate and fair, it is not necessary to report all material facts concerning an individual, but it can be argued that, if an agreed reference arising from a settlement agreement is misleadingly incomplete, the employer can be sued by a subsequent employer for breaching its duty of care. The Employment Appeal Tribunal, in an unfair dismissal case, ruled that, in preparing a reference, it was not reasonable to provide details of complaints against an employee of which the employee was not aware.TSB Bank Plc v Harris [1999] UKEAT 1145_97_0112 (1 December 1999) The Court of Appeal has further held that, if an employee leaves when an investigation is ongoing but has not been concluded, or where issues arise after an employee leaves that have not been investigated, employers can disclose this information but should do so in a measured and fair way, which will be particularly important if to omit this information would mean providing a misleading reference. In 2016, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority are issuing rules that will require the furnishing of references, before any approval or certification may be given by them, as well as specifying the information that they must contain.

It was a Queen Anne style mansion that was built in 1889 and has now been gutted by the arson fire. It served as the private residence of ambassador and congressman Richmond Pearson. Its name derives from a combination of its builder, Richmond Pearson, and the designer, James G. Hill. At the time of its construction, the mansion was one of the most elegant structures in Asheville, with running water, ten fireplaces, and a pulley-operated baggage elevator. It served as a center for social and political activity for many years during Pearson's life. The Estate is located on French Broad River, surrounded by rolling grounds with gardens. Relocation and renovation In 1984, the Pearson heirs sold the Richmond Hill estate. The Preservation Society saved the mansion from demolition and had it moved 600 feet. The mansion underwent a $3 million restoration before being opened as part of an Inn in 1989. The second and third floors housed 12 guest rooms, while the first floor contained a restaurant called Gabrielle's, a grand Oak Hall, library, and front parlor. Two other additions have been made since the initial reopening, both designed by architect Jim Samsel. A manicured croquet court with 8 cottages overlooking the greens were built in 1990. A new building called The Garden Pavilion was added in 1996, containing 16 guest rooms and overlooking a Victorian Parterre-style garden. 2009 fire On March 19, 2009, a fire destroyed the 120-year-old historic mansion. Due to the size of the fire, an arson investigation began immediately. Within days of the blaze, officials with the Asheville Fire Department, confirmed the discovery of what they considered to be evidence indicating that the fire had been intentionally set. Further suspicions were aroused due to an ongoing legal battle which had led the Buncombe County Clerk of Court ordering that the inn be sold in a foreclosure auction on the Buncombe county court house steps. This foreclose notice was entered into three days before the 2009 fire. The owners at the time of the fire had failed to make mortgage payments on the property since August 2008. This failure to make payments led the previous owners, who had financed the purchase, to seek foreclosure. One day before the 2008 foreclose hearing Richmond Hill Inn (Hammock LLC) managing partner William G Gray and his half sister, The Hammocks LLC/Lake Norman pavilion LLC majority partner Virginia C Love (of the law firm Baker, Donelson, Bearman, Caldwell & Berkowitz, PC) filed suit against the former owners and mortgage holders for alleged faulty pipes on the property. In addition, the Buncombe county tax assessor was seeking over $64,000 in property taxes from 2008 The next transcript deals with testimony in regard to William Gray losing his license to practice medicine over charges of sexual misconduct with his under age male patients see medical board documents below. The bankruptcy court for the Eastern District of North Carolina has granted a motion for the state lawsuit in regard to the alleged faulty pipes at the Richmond Hill Inn to proceed in state court. At present, the investigation into the fire is ongoing with a sole person of interest in the case but no arrests have been made.  Bankruptcy court case, documents and transcripts  The Harleysville Mutual Insurance Company has filed a pleading in bankruptcy court for the Eastern District of North Carolina denying liability for the insurance claim for the arson and for the following reasons, quote \\"9. The Policy excludes recovery for loss where the loss is caused by criminal, fraudulent, dishonest, or illegal acts committed by the insured or those with an interest in the property. Document Page 2 of 9. 11\\\\. As alleged in greater detail in the Complaint, Harleysville believes, and expects to be able to prove at trial, that under these exclusions it has complete defenses to the Demand, including that (a) the fire was caused by the Debtor's arson and (b) that in applying for the Policy the Debtor made material misrepresentations. Document page 3 of 9 \\" end quote. The Harleysville Mutual Insurance Company filed a petition in the bankruptcy court for the eastern district of North Carolina to remove the civil arson case from bankruptcy court to federal district court and to request a trial by jury. This has been so ordered by the court The Harleysville Mutual Insurance Company deposed (questioned) William Gilman Gray under oath on June 10 and 11 2009. The questions and answers where wide- ranging as follows, William Gray did not take a lie detector test at the request of the Ashville fire department so the identity of the one person who did is still a mystery . Under questioning William Gray testified to a letter his sister Virginia C love,The Hammocks LLC/Lake Norman pavilion LLC majority partner(of the law firm Baker, Donelson, Bearman, Caldwell & Berkowitz, PC) sent to a Jim Sloggart demanding money for failure to perform as a partner in The hammocks LLC William Gray was asked to speculate as to whom may have burned down the Richmond Hill Inn he stated that he could not imagine the following people would have \\"done it themselves\\" but may have had motive to do so, Jim Sloggart, Mrs Micheal(the note holder)and Bland Holland a former Richmond Hill Inn manager. At some point before the arson the night watchmen had been laid off The next transcript discuses Virginia c love's law firm Baker, Donelson, Bearman, Caldwell & Berkowitz, PC doing the accounting and tax returns for the Richmond hill Inn.this transcript also has William Gray stating that at an employee meeting held several days after the arson the entire staff of the kitchen and dining room resigned in mass.William gray testified that he provided copy's of an audit to all owners of the Hammocks LLC except his other sister Mary Mullins.William Gray testified that he knew at the time of the purchase of the Richmond Hill Inn that it was a financial failure The fourth transcript discusses the sell of the Richmond Hill Inn. Rockey Lapomardo from Florida is a friend of Virginia C love and has tried to sell the property so far without success. The Lapomardo firm still has images of the property for sell from before the arson the sixth transcript contains testimony from William Gray as to a call from Jim Sloggart right after the arson quote, \\"well, you know they are going to blame us for doing it' And I said, probably.\\" The next transcript contains testimony in regard to allegations that William Gray lost his license to practice medicine due to sexual misconduct with his under age male patients. William Gray gives testimony in regard to 1977 California Medical Board allegations of sexual misconduct with male patients(the first California case) The bankruptcy court for the western district of North Carolina has granted a motion for the state lawsuit in regard to the alleged faulty pipes at the Richmond Hill Inn to proceed in state court.Further testimony was given in regard to whether William Gray told employees he was bipolar William Gray denied he made any such statement. Testimony on page 76 In a recently filed document in the Federal District Court for western North Carolina The Harleysville Mutual Insurance Company makes the statement that it believes that the arson was set by The Hammocks LLC's \\"Authorized agents\\" On January 20 in bankruptcy court for the western region of North Carolina there is a hearing scheduled to argue whether to convert the Richmond Hill Inn from a Chapter 11 to a chapter 7 liquidation, to decide whether to accept \\"the plan\\" submitted by the debtor, to appoint the US trustee for the estate and to examine the Hammocks LLC financial discloser statements.The US trustee an employee of the court has objected to the financial discloser statement, \\"the plan\\" and has asked the judge to convert the case to a liquidation bankruptcy. The US trustees motion to convert the case to a chapter 7 and/or appoint a chapter 11 trustee was denied in a hearing 20 January 2010 Thus The Hammocks LLC doing business as the Richmond Hill Inn shall remain as debtor in possession in till such time as there is a discharge from bankruptcy court. It appears that the managing partners plan to shut down the Richmond Hill Inn soon under a chapter 11 \\"liquidation plan\\" and sell the real estate to satisfy the mortgage owed The bankruptcy court for the western district of North Carolina has objected to this plan as it is not transparent. It does not disclose partner compensation. It does not disclose timing of this \\"liquidation\\" It is noted it does not appear that employees or future guests have been notified of this plan. The Richmond hill Inn has closed for the winter but appears to be still taking reservations for April 2010. It is not known if Richmond hill inn is collecting deposits on wedding reservations. As of late February 2010 the Richmond Hill Inn website is reporting that it will not reopen in April 2010, due to arson by former employees. Controversy over media coverage of William Gilman Gray managing partner of Hammock LLC d/b/a Richmond Hill Inn Local paper Asheville Citizen-Times ran an article on Richmond Hill Inn managing partner William G Gray on his past criminal arrest record for allegedly molesting boys in several states over the last three decades and surrendering his license to practice medicine in lieu of a hearing or after a hearing in many states. The article generated intense controversy in the community as to its content. There appear to be federal government documents that support the controversy in regard to William G Gray losing his DEA license to proscribe controlled substances for \\"his prescribing or dispensing various controlled substances to several individuals, two of whom were minors, without a legitimate medical purpose and outside the scope of professional practice\\" and there appear to be state of California, North Carolina and state of Virginia documents in regard to alleged criminal behavior in regard to minors And a Revocation of license to practice for a \\"mental abnormality\\" in regard to behavior towards his male minor patients It is a public policy question to note that William Gilmans Gray's 1977 surrender of his California license to practice medicine still does not appear on the California's medical board website. The ownership management team at the Richmond Hill Inn did release a statement prepared by the public relations firm of Dan Kellerby Media of Nashville, TN. It tells of the hardships in the hotel industry in the last years of the economic crises and alleged forced cutbacks on staff and the ownership structure's family and emotional attachment to the community. This is an example of a case study of multi-media tourism marketing before the fire Continued Operation After Fire The Richmond Hill Inn re-opened after the 2009 fire and continued to operate under chapter 11 bankruptcy protection , even though the mansion was destroyed and Gabrielle's Restaurant was destroyed due to the arson.

R. Scott in 1940. Summary Based on a folktale, the story follows the life of a mustachioed cap selling street vendor (unnamed in the book, he is known as Pezzo in the sequels Circus Caps for Sale and More Caps for Sale) who wears his entire stock of caps on his head. He (in this story) carried wares on his head instead of a real street vendor that carries wares on their backs (or in a selling container such as a wagon or wheelbarrow) in reality. The set of caps consist of his own checked (or checkerboard) cap, followed with a bunch of caps from each specific color. The peddler's checked cap is followed with a bunch of green (or gray) caps, a bunch of yellow (or brown) caps, a bunch of blue caps, and finally a bunch of red caps on the very top. He strolls through towns and villages saying (if they want a cap), \\"Caps! Caps for sale! Fifty cents a cap!\\" The peddler could not sell any caps. Nobody wanted a cap that morning. Nobody even wanted a red one. All the people in the town (not wanting caps) were probably sleeping. He began to feel very hungry. But he had no money for food. One day, the peddler sits down under a tree to take a nap, with all his wares still on his head. When he awakens, all the caps but his own (which is his own checked cap) are missing. He looked in the front, the back, the left, and the right of him, but there were no caps. But when he looked up in the tree, he saw a troupe of monkeys. He finds the monkeys who are now sitting in the tree and have stolen and are now wearing his caps. On every branch there was a monkey and on every one was a green, a yellow, a blue, or a red cap. The peddler then spoke to them. He orders them to return his caps. So he starts a little game (a little trick) to get the no- good monkeys to give him back his caps. He scolds them, and yells at them (saying the same thing, \\"YOU MONKEYS YOU! YOU GIVE ME BACK MY CAPS!\\"; shaking a finger, shaking both hands, and stamping his foot), while the monkeys refuse and ignore his warning. Instead, they imitate him doing the same actions as him (saying, \\"Tsz, tsz, tsz!\\"). At the last point, the peddler (who was really, very, very angry) shouted, \\"YOU MONKEYS YOU! YOU MUST GIVE ME BACK MY CAPS!\\". But one last time, the monkeys refused. They stamped both of their feet back at him and imitated him (and said, \\"TSZ, TSZ, TSZ!\\"). Finally, he becomes furious that he throws down his own cap in disgust and walked away. At this, the monkeys throw down theirs as well, right at his feet. After the monkeys give the peddler back his caps, they leave. The peddler stacks up the caps and puts them back on his head (first the bunch of green caps, then the yellow caps, then the blue caps, and the red caps from the very top). Then that afternoon, the peddler strolls back to town, where he starts calling once again, \\"Caps! Caps for sale! Fifty cents a cap!\\". Popularity It is Slobodkina's best-known work, and has sold more than two million copies. Caps for Sale is a popular read-aloud book, because its repetitive text permits children to speak the lines and thus join in the reading experience. It won a Lewis Carroll Shelf Award in 1958. History The earliest known account of the story may be found The Wilmington Centinel published in Wilmington, North Carolina January 8, 1789. \\"According to the following relation from a person just returned from the Labrador coast, the imitative faculty in monkeys seems to exceed every thing short of human. ‚ÄìA sailor having a number of red woolen caps, &c; to dispose of among the natives, went on shore for that purpose ; his way to a settlement lying through a woods very copiously inhabited by the species abovementioned, and it being mid day, put a cap on his head, and laying the others by his side, he determined upon a little repose under the shade of a plantain tree. To his utter astonishment, when he awoke, from the specimen he had given his imitative observers of the use of his caps, he beheld a number of them upon the heads of the monkeys on the trees, round about him, while the wearers were chattering in an unusual manner. Finding every attempt to regain them fruitless , he at length in a fit of rage and disappointment, and under the supposition the one he retained was not worth taking away, &c.; pulled the same from his head, and throwing it upon the ground exclaimed ---‚Äú here d‚Äîn you, take it among ye,‚Äù which he had no sooner done, than to his great surprise, the observant monkeys did the same, by which means he regained the greatest part of his property.\\" Other media Caps for Sale was included as one of five stories on the 1986 VHS release Five Stories for the Very Young from Weston Woods Studios, animated using illustrations from the book.

Origins The name originated from Charles Cadby, piano manufacturer, who purchased of land along the High Road (today named Hammersmith Road) in 1874. The location had formerly been known as the Croften Estate. Cadby allocated on the site for his new piano factory and showrooms while the remaining were set aside for smaller building plots. Cadby Hall itself was designed by Lewis Henry Isaacs and constructed using Portland stone and red Fareham bricks, with terracotta panelling above the first floor windows, and carved portraits of famous composers. Reliefs on the sides of the entrance doorway depicted scenes celebrating music and poetry. Cadby called the building the Cadby & Company Pianoforte Manufactory. The arrangement of buildings in the complex was designed primarily to prevent the spread of fire by confining it to one building should such an incident occur. Cadby lived for a time in what is now known as Keats House, previously owned by the poet John Keats in Hampstead. When Cadby died on 22 October 1884, the factory and all stock were sold, and subsequently a variety of businesses occupied the site between 1886 and 1893, including Kensington Co-operative Stores and the Schweppes Mineral Water Works. J. Lyons & Co. Ltd. By 1899, the fledgling J. Lyons company had purchased property near Cadby Hall at No. 62 Hammersmith Road, and when they subsequently took over the Hall complex itself they retained the name, although the official address of the Cadby Hall complex became 66 Hammersmith Road. In time it became one of the largest food factories in the United Kingdom, growing to cover an area of more than . As the Lyons catering business expanded, the factory complex grew outwards from the central point of the original Cadby Hall, spreading in all directions but chiefly east and west along the Hammersmith Road, with new blocks being added as new areas of production were launched, including tea, baked goods, meat and ice cream. As part of this expansion, the company purchased the St Mary's College campus that adjoined Cadby Hall in 1922 and began using the land and property when the college moved to Strawberry Hill in 1925. Blocks were given a letter designation, with A Block being the original piano manufacturing area, which was converted into bakeries. Subsequent blocks were added to the site, and as time and production moved on throughout the 20th century, old blocks would be renovated or demolished and new ones built in their place, although the original Cadby Hall building (A Block) remained largely intact right through until the demolition of the entire complex in 1983, by which time it had become J Block. At the peak of the Lyons operations, the entire stretch of land along the Hammersmith Road between Blythe Road and Brook Green became one vast manufacturing enclosure with over 30,000 staff working 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The name of Cadby Hall became so synonymous with the company that the three later overseas J. Lyons & Co. complexes in Toronto, Canada; Natal, South Africa, and Salisbury, Rhodesia (today Harare, Zimbabwe) were also named Cadby Hall. The original Cadby Hall site in Hammersmith also earned a place in history as the birthplace of the first ever business computer, LEO, which Lyons developed between 1949-1951 to automate its clerical and administrative tasks. Most famous employee In 1951, after she had met Denis Thatcher and moved to Dartford, Margaret Hilda Roberts was employed as a research chemist at Cadby Hall on emulsifying ice cream. She later became the United Kingdom's first woman Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher.  Decline  By the late 1970s, J. Lyons & Co. began to decline as rapidly as it had expanded a century earlier, and in 1978 the company was taken over by Allied Breweries Ltd. Gradually, the Lyons infrastructure was sold off to pay for Allied's consolidation in the drinks industry, and the Cadby Hall complex was scaled down until the site was finally cleared in June 1983. Prior to its demolition, Cadby Hall served as a location for filming of episodes of 1970s TV action dramas The Professionals and The Sweeney .

The American National Bank was built on the former property of the Belle Haven Hotel known earlier as the DeSoto Hotel built in 1886. The hotel in May 1925 was put for sale at a price of $533,000 ( $7,341,328.80 in 2016) and was bought by the Adair Reality and Trust of Atlanta, Georgia. After purchasing the hotel, there were plans to tear it down and replace it with a new one. There had been rumors that it was to be replaced with an office building. In March 1926 the foundations of the building were laid and with all building materials sent in before being built and by April 1926 it was at 4 stories. On April 29, 1926 an article by The Week in Sarasota had titled a story \\"New Belle Haven Hotel on Bay Front Marks New Epoch in History of Sarasota and Its Commanding Position as a Resort City.\\" The cost of the building was estimated to be at about $3,000,000 to $3,500,000 (about $40,000,000 to $47,000,000 in 2016), and in late April, 1926 the American National Bank moved into the new building.  Hotel usage  Sarasota in the 1930s saw a growth in tourists coming here. In 1936 with a growth in tourism Joseph Spadaro from Boca Grande bought it and converted it into a hotel. It was described by R.L. Polk City Phone Directories as \\"a fireproof building built of steel and concrete, steam heat and with 2 elevators and 125 rooms\\". There was a room called the Aztec Room a cocktail lounge was popular with tourists and residents in the area. The hotel was sold in 1946 to Louis Swed from Tampa and Associates for $225,000 (about $2,000,000 in 2016). There were plans to redo the hotel's rooms and add a coffee bar and a restaurant. In 1946 the Orange Blossom Hotel Corporation was formed and had Lewis Swed, Jack Shapiro and M. B. Sullivan as executives. In 1950 the hotel was sold to Elizabeth Fitizie and Mrs. Thomas Kewley for in excess of $300,000 (worth about $3,000,000 in 2016.) The new owners took a major part in the hotel's operation and the dining room. The Hotel did have Jimmy Roosevelt and Peter Lawford as notable guests of the hotel. The hotel struggled with business during the 1950s and 1960s when new hotels were being opened in Sarasota.  Retirement Facility  In 1967, it was announced that the Trustees of the Sarasota Non-Profit foundation had purchased the hotel and decided to use it as a nursing home with 60 rooms. The next year, the hotel was modernized and even made it into being in the Building Magazine in the magazines Modernization Citation. In the 1980s when a large amount of its lifetime tenants didn't occupy the building it was closed.

The vast majority of Mozambican Muslims are Sunni belonging to Shafi school of jurisprudence, although Twelverhttp://shiawaves.com/english/world/5447-shia-muslims-of-nampula- mozambique-help-victims-of-natural-disasters-photos and Ismaili Shiite Muslims are also registered. The Muslims consist primarily of indigenous Mozambicans, citizens of South Asian (Indian and Pakistani) descent, and a very small number of North African and Middle Eastern immigrants. Pre-colonial history A mosque in Mozambique Island Mozambique has long historic ties with the Muslim world. Initially by way of Sufi merchants, mostly from Yemen, and centuries after through a more organized system of coastal trading cities, more heavily influenced by the Ibadi Muslims from Oman along the shores of Eastern Africa. The arrival of the Arab trade in Mozambique dates to the fourth Hijri century when Muslims established small emirates on the coast of East Africa. Links between Islam and the chiefly clans in Mozambique have existed since the eighth century, when Islam made inroads into the northern Mozambican coast and became associated with the Shirazi ruling elites. Since the founding of the Kilwa Sultanate in the 10th AD century by Ali ibn al- Hassan Shirazi, Islam had become a major religion in the region. The former port city of Sofala, which became famous for its trade in ivory, timber, slaves, gold (by way of Great Zimbabwe) and Iron with the Islamic Middle East and India, was one of the most important trading centers on the Mozambique coast. Sofala and much of the rest of coastal Mozambique was part of the Kilwa Sultanate from Arab arrival (believed to be the 12th century) until the Portuguese conquest in 1505. During the subsequent period of the Omani Al Bu Said dynasty, Muslim merchants expanded their trading zones south along the coast. It is believed that nearly all of the cities' inhabitants were Muslim before the arrival of the Portuguese in the 16th century. Colonial history A mosque in Mozambique Islam faced serious challenges in Mozambique during the colonial era. Since the Estado Novo period (1926‚Äì1974), Roman Catholicism has become the dominant religion following a formal alliance (Concordat) between the Church and the government. Only with the start of the War of Liberation did the state lower its opposition to Islam and try to coopt the religion, in order to avoid an alliance between Muslims and the dissident liberation movement. Modern Mozambique Since the end of the socialist period (1989 onwards), Muslims have been able to proselytise freely and build new mosques. Muslims have also made their way into the parliament. Several South African, Kuwaiti and other Muslim agencies are active in Mozambique, with one important one being the African Muslim Agency. An Islamic University has been set up in Nampula, with a branch in Inhambane. Mozambique is also an active member of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). Rather than relying on the culturally loaded notions of a \\"chief\\" of r√©gulo, the FRELIMO government has preferred to use the term \\"traditional authorities\\" to indicate a group of chiefs and their entourage of subordinate chiefs and healers. Realizing the social importance of this group, FRELIMO gradually reinstated \\"traditional authority.\\" While the Muslim leadership in northern Mozambique seems to have recovered the \\"traditional\\" side of their authority and power with legal reforms, they are still largely associated with chiefship and African culture rather than Islam. Because of this they are barely able to access benefits or gain socio-political influence through Islamic platforms or organizations. This situation has been the source of their continual frustration and resistance to the alleged racial and cultural discrimination perpetrated by FRELIMO allied with southern Wahhabis, Afro-Indians, and Indians.

Stewart was defeated in the 2014 Summerside mayoral election by Bill Martin. Before mayorship Before his election as mayor, Stewart was a police officer for the Summerside Police Department from 1971 to 1984, when he retired from the force.

In 1993, Stewart ran in a federal election as the Progressive Conservative candidate for the riding of Egmont. He was defeated by then-incumbent Liberal MP Joe McGuire, who won with a plurality of approximately 3,700 votes. He was accused of wasting $1.3 million of taxpayers' money, which was forwarded as a purported deposit towards a Michael Jackson tribute concert that never ended up happening, \\"In January 2011, the city filed a complaint with the United States District Court, Northern District of California, San Jose Division, for fraud, conspiracy to commit fraud, negligent misrepresentation and rescission (rescinding) of a contract against Katrina Berg Sussmeier and Starlink Productions Inc.\\" At the 2014 Summerside mayoral election, Bill Martin, a Summerside businessman, was elected mayor with a vote of 4614 compared to Stewart's 2092, thus ending Stewart's 29-year run as mayor of Summerside.

In any case, the screen door incorporates screen mesh to block birds, flying insects or airborne debris such as seeds or leaves from entering, and pets and small children from exiting interior spaces, while allowing for air, light, and views. History The first screen doors were made using cheesecloth. After the American Civil War, wire cloth was coated with paint and sold for window screens. Construction Aluminium framed Aluminium sliding screen doors are generally constructed by two methods: rollformed or extruded. In both cases the rectangular rollformed or extruded shapes are joined together into a door frame using metal corners or screws. Rollformed The first are rollformed from thin aluminium sheets into a rectangular shaped door frame which incorporates a screen channel to hold the window screen material. Desire, New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Rollformed aluminum sliding screen doors are the least expensive to produce because they can be manufactured from thin aluminum sheet formed into a relatively strong rectangular shape. Rollformed screen doors have mitered corners into which a steel or aluminum alloy corner is forced using a friction fit. If a steel corner is used, the rollformed sections are often pierced or staked into the corners, to help secure the corners together. If aluminum alloy corners are used, the corner relies on its friction fit alone to hold the door frame together. The weakest point of a rollformed sliding screen door is the corner. After repeated opening and closing, stresses will cause the rollformed shape to loosen in the area of the corner. The door will then stick and jam and typically will require replacement rather than repair Extruded The second are extruded aluminum shapes, with aluminum frames made from thicker aluminum than rollformed doors. This makes an extruded aluminum door much stronger but also more expensive. Extruded aluminum screen door frames can be mitered and joined with aluminum alloy corners or can be notched out and joined together with screws that fit in screw holes made as part of the extrusion process. Extruded aluminum screen doors are generally longer lasting than rollformed screen doors. They are also more easily repaired since, if the corners break, new corners can be inserted without losing the friction fit necessary to hold the door together. Wood framed Wood framed screen doors, hinged and sliding, are also available from limited production and custom carpentry sources, used for aesthetic style and sustainable building applications. Wood-framed screen doors were a fixture of many homes in the American South before air conditioning was common. Screen door from early 20th century Retractable screen doors An alternative to sliding screen doors are a version of pocket doors, retractable screen doors which 'disappear' out of sight into their own protective housing or casing. These casings can be mounted in several ways. An inside mount is where is can be flush with the door frame. A surface mount can be mounted on the surface of your door frame. Thirdly, you can build in your casing inside the wall and your screen and casing will recess completely out of the way. These screen doors are custom made to fit the measurements of your doors. Most retractable doors use a spring-loaded roller very similar to a window blind, except the roller is mounted vertically when used in a door application. Screen material is attached to the roller while the opposite side of the material is attached to sliding bar riding on top and bottom tracks. The bar is moved back and forth to open or close the screen. The bar is usually held closed with a magnetic closure. Different types of mesh fabric options are available from standard fiberglass mesh, pet screen resistant mesh and solar screen mesh. The operation of the screens are typically manual, but motorized versions do exist.

He played college football at Nebraska under head coach Bob Devaney. Glover played high school football at Snyder High School in Jersey City, New Jersey. Glover recalls a time when his coach, Roy Corso, instructed each player to bring a garbage pail cover with them for after the game. When asked why, Corso responded it was for their own protection. Glover admits if it wasn't for those covers, they never would have made it past the losing team throwing rocks at the bus windows on the way out of the parking lot. In his senior season for the Huskers in 1972, he won the Outland Trophy and the Lombardi Award; the second of eight Nebraska winners of the Outland Trophy and the first of five Nebraska winners of the Lombardi Award. Nebraska players have won nine Outland Trophys overall, by far the most in the nation. Oklahoma has the second most with four. As the middle guard, he was a key member of the Blackshirts as an underclassman on the 1970 and 1971 undefeated Nebraska teams that won consecutive national championships. The 1972 team was a pre-season #1 but lost their road opener to UCLA and finished 9-2-1, rising to fourth in the final AP poll, buoyed by a third consecutive Orange Bowl victory, 40-6 over Notre Dame. Rich Glover was the second straight winner of the Outland Trophy from Nebraska, his New York Giant teammate Larry Jacobson won in 1971. He is the first of four Cornhuskers (Dave Rimington, Dean Steinkuhler and Ndamukong Suh), and one of thirteen lineman, to have won both the Outland Trophy and the Lombardi Award in their careers. Glover also finished third in the 1972 Heisman Trophy voting, won by teammate Johnny Rodgers; he was the only defensive player in the top ten.Heisman.com - 1972 - Johnny Rodgers He was selected to the Nebraska All-Century Football Team and is one of sixteen Cornhuskers to have his jersey (#79) retired. Glover was selected to the College Football Hall Of Fame in 1995. In 1999 Glover was selected as a starting defensive tackle by Sports Illustrated in their \\"NCAA Football All- Century Team\\" alongside other starting defensive tackle Bronko Nagurski. The second and third team defensive tackles were Buck Buchanan, Lee Roy Selmon, Mike Reid and Randy White. Glover was one of six Nebraska Cornhuskers on SI's All-Century Team 85 man roster; the others being Johnny Rodgers, Dave Rimington, Dean Steinkuhler, Tommie Frazier, and Aaron Taylor. Glover, the oldest of the six, was the only Cornhusker defensive player selected. Following his collegiate career, he was selected by the New York Giants in the third round of the 1973 NFL Draft, the 69th pick overall. He played with the Giants (along with fellow Husker and Outland winner Larry Jacobson) for one season before joining the Shreveport Steamers of the World Football League in 1974. He then joined the Philadelphia Eagles in 1975 before injuries ended his NFL career. He went on to become a teacher and coach in the public school system of San Jose, California.

Early career Born into a Quaker family in Morrisville, Pennsylvania.The American Journal of Insanity Vol. 55 p. 120 (1898) He began a study of medicine in 1828 under Dr. Nicholas Belleville, of Trenton, New Jersey when he was eighteen. After receiving a medical degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1832, Kirkbride had his own practice from 1835 to 1840. Psychiatry In 1840, Kirkbride became superintendent of the Pennsylvania Hospital for the Insane. In 1844, Kirkbride helped to found AMSAII, becoming secretary and treasurer, and subsequently its president from 1862 to 1870. Kirkbride pioneered what would be known as the Kirkbride Plan, to improve medical care for the insane, as a standardization for buildings that housed the patients. Kirkbride's influential work, On the Construction, Organization, and General Arrangements of Hospitals for the Insane with Some Remarks on Insanity and Its Treatment,On the Construction, Organization, and General Arrangements of Hospitals for the Insane with Some Remarks on Insanity and Its Treatment, was published in 1854, and again in 1880. Kirkbride's ideas brought about mixed feelings in both patients and peers. Some in the medical community saw his theories and ideas as stubbornly clinging to ideals that hindered medical progress, while others supported his ideas, and saw them change the treatment philosophy for the mentally insane. In his patients, he sometimes inspired fear and anger, even to the point that one attempted to murder him, but he also believed that the mentally ill could be treated, and possibly cured, and in fact Kirkbride, after the death of his first wife, married a former patient. Kirkbride architecture Kirkbride was an advocate of building hospitals for the mentally ill in a style which he believed promoted recovery and healing. This style was used on many late 19th century hospitals, including St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, D.C. Many of these buildings, designed by leading architects of the time, are in ruins or decay.\\"Adventures in the Forbidden Zone\\" (Mar 2007) Popular Photography Vol.71, No.3 p.75 An estate, now known as \\"The Village\\",The Village, Grand Traverse Commons previously Traverse City State Hospital, was saved from destruction and restored.\\"The Kirkbride Connection\\" (Nov-Dec 2007) Old-House Journal p.45 Personal life Kirkbride was married to Ann West Jenks in 1839.

History From a Textile Village to the Church on the Hill The Blackstone River powered the machinery of those textile mills that brought the Industrial Revolution to America. One such mill owned by Samuel Mann (or Man), who gave his name to the village of Manville in which his mill was located. Here, as in the other new mill villages that spread upriver from Samuel Slater‚Äôs original mill in Pawtucket, itinerant revivalists rather than settled churches provided only sporadic religious services for the workers in these early factories. Mann, himself a Quaker, found these ‚Äúenthusiasts‚Äù distasteful and sought to replace them with a ‚Äúsober religion.‚Äù He was clearly concerned not only for the souls of his workers but also for the discipline of his workforce when he wrote in 1835 to the Episcopal Bishop of Rhode Island to request a missionary. He offered to provide for the missionary lodging in a mill house, two new suits of clothes a year, and a salary of $300, to be collected at the mill's pay window at the rate of $6 a week. He also promised ongoing financial support for the building and maintaining of a church. The bishop sent the Rev. Ephraim Munroe to answer the call. If some of these early operatives had emigrated from England, they had not been Anglicans there any more than their Yankee counterparts had been Episcopalians here. Munroe found his congregation largely unfamiliar with the Prayer Book and uncertain how to use it. He could be sure, however, of a captive audience for his Sunday afternoon service because Mr. Mann himself attended and noted any absentees, who would next day be summoned to explain their whereabouts. On Sunday mornings teachers instructed the children in reading and writing using the Bible and available primers; the only schooling these children would get, for they too labored in the mill along with their parents. Munroe claimed success in getting increasing numbers of the congregation to use the Prayer Book and participate in the services though the numbers of actual communicants remained very small. From that hopeful beginning Emmanuel Church carried on, experiencing periods of gratifying growth as well as dispiriting declines, which often coincided with a rather rapid turnover of rectors or a period when the pulpit was vacant. It survived the vicissitudes of 19th-century economic depressions, the Civil War, and a large influx of Roman Catholic French Canadians in the 1880s. It had always through this long period depended on the mill owners‚Äô continuing financial support. The Great Depression of 1929, however, bankrupted the Manville-Jenckes Mill, leaving the church to struggle through a very difficult time. It nevertheless celebrated its centennial in 1935 in the presence of the Right Rev. DeWolf Perry, who was not only Bishop of Rhode Island but also the Presiding Bishop of the American Episcopal Church. After World War II, however, the downhill trajectory resumed and membership sank to new lows. Moving across the River :Meanwhile, across the Blackstone River in Cumberland Hill was an area experiencing rapid growth and was deemed an appropriate site for a new mission. To this Church of the Incarnation came the Rev. Walter Lyons, who conducted the first service of the new mission on July 20, 1958, at Cumberland Hill Elementary School. Less than a year later he could present to Bishop Higgins a group of 25 to be confirmed and received into the church, even providing for the women and girls in the group the white veils deemed appropriate for the ceremony. :The mission was at that point without a church while the church in Manville had received in 1958, for the first time in 23 years, an extensive redecoration. The two churches decided to merge as the Church of Emmanuel and the Incarnation, but, to avoid the expense of obtaining a new state charter, agreed subsequently to operate under Emmanuel‚Äôs existing charter of 1836 and to use its name. The first service of the joint congregations was held at Cumberland Hill School on 7 July 1959 but they now also could use the renovated church in Manville. The new church was thus able to celebrate as ‚ÄúEmmanuel‚Äù its 125th anniversary in 1960. Building a New Church :At this point the Episcopal Diocese of Rhode Island intervened with the purchase of the present site on Nate Whipple Highway and a substantial contribution toward the cost of a new church. Records found at the Cumberland Town Hall indicate that the land was purchased for $1 from the heir, Ruth Cook, of the estate of Handel Cook. Work was begun on August 28, 1960, and on March 1, 1961, the new edifice was formally dedicated. :With the completion of a parish house adjoining the church, the Sunday school could meet on the premises rather than having to transport to the children to the local school for classes. Understandably the Manville parishioners were reluctant to leave their newly remodeled church but the new location was clearly more convenient for most parishioners. Both a stained glass window from Manville and the baptismal font were eventually incorporated into the new Emmanuel Church to retain continuity with that period of the church‚Äôs past. Thus established, the church continued to grow and prosper.

Taylor-Clarke, like Neil Godwin, is seen as a sharp contrast to the lead character of the series, David Brent. She is a competent executive who is often bewildered by the half-witted antics of Brent, who nicknames her Camilla Parker-Bowles, and who is frequently seen taking covert peeks up her skirt. Unlike her subordinate, she appears to be well respected by the majority of the staff at Wernham-Hogg (with the exception of the Warehouse crew, who are seen making sexist remarks to her in one episode). In the series one finale, Jennifer is promoted from a regional directorship to a corporate position, and informs David he has been selected by the board of directors to succeed her, though he loses this opportunity when he fails a health examination. Following this, Jennifer remains in an overseer's role over the Slough branch. Jennifer is not directly a comical character; her humour, rather, is drawn from giving David a dressing down and interrogating him over his offensive and impulsive remarks. In the series two finale, she agrees with Neil's suggestion that David be sacked, and offers him a generous redundancy package. Jennifer appeared regularly throughout the first series of the show as well maintaining regular visits to the Slough branch in the second series.

The town derived its original name from the adjacent Elizabeth Creek. History The town site was located in the southwest corner of Shamblen Survey. Its first residents, members of the Peters Colony arrived c. 1850. Elizabethtown served a supply station in 1852, mostly for cowboys driving their herds to Kansas. The town founders, the Harmonsons, constructed a church, homes, a business, and a school. At its height the school had 25 students. In 1859 the town had six saloons, a hotel and a post office, a staple of all true towns. According to residents of nearby Justin, Texas, Elizabethtown was once known as Bugtown after so many bugs swarmed in on a camp meeting one night that the preaching had to be stopped. During the American Civil War the frontier in and west of Denton County remained undefended against Indian resistance, many families moved east during this time period. Later, though, many did return. As the town grew it gained four general stores, another hotel and a livery stable, along with Baptist and Methodist churches, and a Masonic lodge that operated from 1873 to 1876.

The Texas and Pacific Railway, which was built in 1881 from Fort Worth through Denton County, bypassed Elizabethtown by just two miles. Many residents subsequently moved two miles east to the newly established town of Roanoke, along with their businesses, churches and the Masonic lodge.

Following shakedown in February 1950, Robert A. Owens, one of the first hunter-killer destroyers so designated, was reclassified DDE-827 on 4 March 1950. She operated in the western Atlantic and the Caribbean (during which time she sank west of Key West, Florida during rocket tests on 7 October 1951) and in late 1952 when she deployed to the Mediterranean. From that time into the 1960s, she operated with the 6th Fleet for six months out of every eighteen. During the remaining twelve months, she conducted anti-submarine patrols off the Atlantic coast and in the Caribbean. In the fall of 1957 she added the North Sea to her operational area as she joined in NATO exercises. 1960-1969 In the 1960s Robert A. Owens continued to rotate between 2nd and 6th Fleets. In November 1960 and February 1962, she assisted in the recovery operations for Project Mercury space capsules, Mercury 2 and Mercury 6. After the latter, Robert A. Owens sailed east to join Task Group Bravo (TG Bravo) for eastern Atlantic antisubmarine operations. Reclassified DD-827 on 7 August 1962, she was a unit of the Cuban Quarantine Task Force 136 during October and November. In January and February 1963, she conducted anti- submarine warfare (ASW) operations in the Atlantic. March brought another period of patrol off Cuba; and, in April, Robert A. Owens again got underway for extended deployment. Duty in the Mediterranean, the Red Sea, and the Indian Ocean followed and on 23 December she entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) overhaul. Completing overhaul on 15 November 1964, Robert A. Owens served as schoolship for the Fleet Sonar School and, after refresher training at Guantanamo Bay, joined the Recovery Force for Gemini-Titan 3 (GT3) in March 1965 and Gemini- Titan 4 (GT4) in June. On 27 November, she sailed for an extended deployment to the 6th Fleet and Middle East Force, returning to Fleet Sonar School ship duty in May 1966. She then operated in the Atlantic until deploying to the Mediterranean during the first five months of 1967. The balance of the year was spent in Atlantic operations, schoolship duties, and overhaul which was completed on 11 March 1968. Robert A. Owens then participated in the search for submarine from 28 May to 13 June, and conducted ASW operations before deploying to the 6th Fleet from 5 September 1968 to 27 January 1969. She then operated in the Atlantic and Caribbean without an extended deployment for the balance of that year. 1970-1973 Between 1 January 1970 and 31 December 1972, she alternated two Mediterranean deployments with normal operations in the Atlantic and Caribbean, out of her home port, Norfolk, Virginia. The year 1973 was taken up completely by Atlantic and Caribbean operations. During 1976 at least, she was home ported in Galveston Texas, making a round trip to Norfolk that spring. 1978-1981 Between 1978 and 1981, she was assigned to the Naval Surface Reserve Force and homeported at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida, berthed adjacent to the training aircraft carrier USS Lexington. During this time the USS Owens was used to train reserve members of the Navy and Marines.  TCG Alcitepe (D-346)  Robert A.

U.S. Attorney Chuck Rosenberg released a statement saying the findings \\"manifested his commitment to commit violent jihad... Terrorist organizations like Lashkar-e-Taiba rely on a network of individuals to carry out their deadly operations.

Background After the retreat of the Muslim army at the Battle of Mu‚Äôtah, the Muslims decided to retaliate against tribes that had supported the Ghassanids in Mu'tah. The Banu Qudah were one such tribe, additionally there were rumours of them planning an attack on Medina itself. It is said Banu Qudah were motivated by Ghassanids and by some extend by the Byzantine elements themselves to attack Muslims area straight in their citadel, Medina Another reasons because Muslim spies has detected the Byzantines has incited their Arab tribe allies to attack Medina. Those informations immediately sent to Medina, caused Prophet Muhammad summoning his council of Sahaba to decide how they should handle such mater. Muhammad immediately appointed Amr ibn al-As, a new Muslim, to lead the expedition against the tribe of Banu Qudah. According to Sealed Nectar, Amr was chosen probably because he was related to Bali tribe, who were located in the area he was to carry out the operation. The contingent consisted of 300 men and 30 horses with Amr ibn al-As as commander,. primary sources from Muslim contemporary chroniclers also stated the inclusion of famous Usama ibn Zayd, son of Zayd ibn Haritha who fell earlier in the battle of Mu'tah.Despite relative his young age, Usama already possessed battle experience, including from the battle of Mu'tah where his father died and later fought under command of Khalid ibn Al-Walid. Aside from huge portions Medina war veterans, the prophet also enlisted some tribes who had already accepted to Islam and come to his aid in the event of great opposition.https://www.withprophet.com/ar/-ÿ≥ÿ±Ÿäÿ©-ÿπŸÖÿ±Ÿà-ÿ®ŸÜ-ÿßŸÑÿπÿßÿµ-ÿ±ÿ∂Ÿä-ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá-ÿπŸÜŸá- ÿ•ŸÑŸâ-ÿ∞ÿßÿ™-ÿßŸÑÿ≥ŸÑÿßÿ≥ŸÑ_475https://www.alsirah.com/ÿ≥ÿ±Ÿäÿ©-ÿπŸÖÿ±Ÿà-ÿ®ŸÜ-ÿßŸÑÿπÿßÿµ-ÿ±ÿ∂Ÿä-ÿßŸÑŸÑŸëŸ∞Ÿá-ÿπŸÜŸá- ÿ•ŸÑŸâ-ÿ∞ÿß/The Life of Muhammad, Ibn HishamThe Life of Muhammad, Ibn Hisham Expedition After Marching for 10 days, Amr ibn al-As encamped at a spring called Salasil, there he found that the enemy was assembled in large numbers, so he sent a messenger back to Muhammad asking for reinforcement. As a response, Muhammad sent 200 men, which included Abu Bakr and Umar, headed by Abu Ubaidah ibn al Jarrah. When Abu Ubaidah arrived he asked to be the Commander of the entire force, to which Amr refused, Abu Ubaidah accepted this and does not complaint since he has been warned before by the Islamic Prophet, Muhammad not to enter any conflict over leadership during this expedition. This instruction included the ruling of who should command the prayer according to Fiqh or Islamic jurisprudence regarding the leader of daily prayer during the time of war. So it is agreed 'Amr should lead the prayer despite he still newly converted Muslim while Abu Ubaidah is veteran companion of Prophet who had adhered Islamic teaching for long time Preparation after the Muslim army has reached the outskirt of the enemy encampments, 'Amr sending scouts. Soon 'Amr realized their enemy forces dwarved his forces by astronomical margin. Many accounts from surviving soldiers of Muslims stated that the enemy exceeding a hundred thousands. So 'Amr decided not to immediately launch the attack in daylight and instructed his soldiers to built encampment until night. Battle Under the cover of night after morning prayer, Amr ibn al-As launch a night raid at the enemy camp in the night while cloaking their own number. 'Amr also instructed his soldiers for each of two men to stay close together, they even instructed to tied their horses together so they cannot separated whatever happened during the combat. According to the Muslim scholar Saifur Rahman al-Mubarakpuri, causing most to flee, except one sub-tribe which fought. This battle also recorded the famous narration from Usama ibn Zayd that has been chronicled by many Muslim historians & authentic Hadith narrator including Bukhari and Muslim. during the battle, Usama faced one particular enemy and immediately faced him one on one while Usama on his horse. Usama successfully dismantled his opponent sword. however, when Usama was about to kill the man, he suddenly plead for mercy. However, In the end Usama killed him the raid was so successful and causing panic among the unprepared enemies. the less than five hundred Muslim warriors scored victory causing havoc among enemy camps without suffering single casualties before retreated along with some handsome spoils of war toward Medina.ÿßŸÑÿ∑ÿ®ŸÇÿßÿ™ ÿßŸÑŸÉÿ®ÿ±Ÿâÿå ÿßÿ®ŸÜ ÿ≥ÿπÿØÿå ÿ¨2ÿå ÿµ131ÿå ÿØÿßÿ± ÿµÿßÿØÿ±ÿå ÿ®Ÿäÿ±Ÿàÿ™. Aftermath Later after the Muslim army has been returned to Medina, Amr immediately reported to Muhammad there is personal commentary account from 'Amr himself who explained this strategy to prophet Muhammad saying he instructed this because he want his men to fight in united stance under the cover of darkness of night, without being separated too far each others, so the enemy does not realized their numbers. Indeed, by fighting this way, the much numerous yet unprepared enemies are deceived to think they have been attacked by very large Muslim forces. which also now agreed by Umar who also participated in the battle The incident regarding Usama also reported to the prophet, then Usama became deeply lamented after he is strongly admonished by the prophet regarding his conduct towards the surrendering enemy who has professed conversion to Islam It is said by Muslim scholars and historians including Ibn Hisham which was quoted on the commentary of Dr. Khalid Abdullah Zeed Basalamah Lc, M.A, during public lecture of one of the series of Seerah Nabawi or Prophetic biography book which released by Shaykh MahMud al-Mishri that 'Amr ibn al-Aas operation causing hostile Arabic clans which affiliated with Byzantine immediately aborted their intention to attack Medina due to realizing Medina capability to mount preemptive attack.

(The Future File) has been the title of an Egyptian science fiction series of novels written by Nabil FaroukAsmaa al- Ghoul, Do Gaza‚Äôs melting-pot markets reflect identity crisis?, al-monitor.com. Retrieved 31 July 2017. and published by Modern Arab Association as a part of Rewayat since the year 1984. 160 titles were published from 1984 to 2009.  Plot summary  The events of the series happen in the not so distant future. Starting December 28, 2000 as stated vaguely in the very first issue, The Death Ray (ÿ£ÿ¥ÿπÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÖŸàÿ™), which was published in 1984. In that era a fictional Egyptian Scientific Intelligence Agency (ESIA) (ÿßŸÑŸÖÿÆÿßÿ®ÿ±ÿßÿ™ ÿßŸÑÿπŸÑŸÖŸäÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÖÿµÿ±Ÿäÿ©) is protecting Egypt from numerous threats. The series begins when the main character, Nour El Deen Mahmoud (then a Lieutenant (ŸÖŸÑÿßÿ≤ŸÖ)), is summoned by the High Commander of Scientific Intelligence for a secret mission to locate a newly developed death ray device which had been stolen from the agency. For this mission, Nour was assigned to head a team of scientists who would form the core team of main characters for the series: communications engineer Salwa, psychiatrist Ramzy, and radiation scientist Mahmoud. For some time, the team is focused solely on solving mysteries which require them to draw on both their policing and scientific skills. As the series progresses, Nour and Salwa get married (Issue #13: Lost Time (ÿßŸÑÿ≤ŸÖŸÜ ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÅŸÇŸàÿØ)). They have a daughter, Nashwa, who becomes the team's computer expert after her growth is artificially accelerated to adulthood as part of an alien weapons' test (Issue #63: The Inflamed Ocean (ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ≠Ÿäÿ∑ ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÑÿ™Ÿáÿ®)). A key milestone in the series takes place during a five-part storyline (Issues #76-80), in which the Earth is occupied by an alien warrior race from the planet Glorial (ÿ¨ŸÑŸàÿ±ŸäÿßŸÑ). In the initial invasion (Issue #76: Invasion (ÿßŸÑÿßÿ≠ÿ™ŸÑÿßŸÑ)), Glorial's armies destroy nearly all of Earth's most significant military, scientific, and cultural assets and landmarks. Nour and his team lead an international resistance movement which, after a year-long campaign, liberates the Earth (Issue #80: Victory (ÿßŸÑŸÜÿµÿ±)). The storylines following the liberation often focused on the struggle for power between different countries and factions in the aftermath of Earth's scientific and cultural devastation, with Egypt becoming the world's leader in science and technology. During this period, Egypt's Scientific Intelligence is re-constituted under a new High Commander, and Nour's team resumes its mystery-solving work. Another milestone in the series takes place when the team travels to the planet Arghoran (ÿ£ÿ±ÿ∫Ÿàÿ±ÿßŸÜ) to help liberate it from Glorial's occupation. This was the fulfillment of a promise Nour had made to Bodon (ÿ®ŸàÿØŸàŸÜ), an Arghorian who once tried to lead his planet to occupy Earth (Issue #58: Battle of the Planets (ŸÖÿπÿ±ŸÉÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÉŸàÿßŸÉÿ®)), but later died in the effort to liberate Earth from Glorial's occupation (Issue #78: Struggle (ÿßŸÑÿµÿ±ÿßÿπ)). While they succeed in liberating Arghoran and returning to Earth, the team disbands after Mahmoud apparently dies (Issue #100: Time = Zero (ÿßŸÑÿ≤ŸÖŸÜ = ÿµŸÅÿ±)), and Salwa becomes pregnant. At the behest of the High Commander, Nour continues his work for Scientific Intelligence as part of a new, two-man team with Akram, a rogue fighter and ally of the team whom Nour and Ramzy first encountered in the aftermath of Earth's liberation (Issue #81: Symbol of Power (ÿ±ŸÖÿ≤ ÿßŸÑŸÇŸàÿ©)). Shortly thereafter, however, the original team, absent Mahmoud, was re-constituted with Akram as the newest member. It also became increasingly clear to the team members that Mahmoud had not died, but that his consciousness was trapped in an unknown dimension from which he occasionally managed to communicate with and assist his former comrades. In its current form, the team continues to solve increasingly complex scientific mysteries, often involving time travel, as well as interstellar and inter- dimensional travels and encounters.  Characters  ; Nour Nour El Deen Mahmoud () is an agent of the ESIA. He is characterized with an outstanding ability to solve mysteries. According to the series, Nour is born in 1976.

Themes   Egyptian and Arab Nationalism  Part of the premise of the series is that, in the future, Egypt becomes the a leading but peaceful world power. In various stories, Farouk regularly emphasizes the patriotism of his characters, and their willingness to make considerable sacrifices for Egypt. Additionally, a number of the stories in the series touch on the themes of pan-Arab solidarity, with Nour and his team members encountering and collaborating with a number of characters from different Arab countries. In these interactions, a sense of fraternity and comradeship between the Egyptians and other Arabs is emphasized. Beyond this, Farouk's stories often include strong criticisms of countries that are unpopular in Egypt and the Arab world today, most notably: the United States, Great Britain, and Israel. In the future which Farouk posits, these countries are shown to be strongly resentful of Egypt's success. The team confronts Israeli spies during numerous stories, and in one notable storyline, Akram goes up against a British spy called James Bradley (Issue #92: The Terrible Journey (ÿßŸÑÿ±ÿ≠ŸÑÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ±ŸáŸäÿ®ÿ©)), whose character is a ruthless and amoral version of the famous fictional British spy James Bond. The United States is often described as a country that deals only in the logic of military strength and force.  Faith and Religion  The heroes of the series are regularly shown to be people of strong faith in God. At times when a character is caught in a seemingly hopeless predicament, he or she will call on God, and a way out will present itself. On one mission, the team encounters an alien race living under the surface of the Moon (Issue #48: Prison of the Moon (ÿ≥ÿ¨ŸÜ ÿßŸÑŸÇŸÖÿ±)), who turn out to be a monotheistic society. A nemesis of Nour who appears in a number of storylines is the half-human son of the Devil (first introduced in Issue #72: The Devil's Son (ÿßÿ®ŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ¥Ÿäÿ∑ÿßŸÜ)).

One of the organisms that is identified using this staining technique is Cryptococcus neoformans. Another use is in surgical pathology where it can identify mucin. This is helpful, for example, in determining if the cancer is a type that produces mucin.

These cards are most often found in the United States and other countries where the sport is popular. Most football cards features National Football League (NFL) players, but can also feature college football players. Player cards normally list the player's statistics and a narration about their play. Some special edition packs of cards include authentic autographs or jersey cards. Some may include bubble gum or a special edition player card. Many cards are serial- numbered, meaning that there are only so many of that particular card produced. These include unique prints (numbered 1/1). Included in these are printing plates, used in the actual production of the card.

They were used to promote other items in addition to tobacco products such as Spalding's sporting goods, breakfast cereal, ice cream, doughnuts and gum. Jim Thorpe on a 1933 Goudey card The National Chicle Company released its own football set, with only 36 cards, in 1935. It was the first set to feature players from the National Football League, including six Hall of Fame players. Along with baseball cards, American football cards began gaining popularity after World War II. In 1948, there were two sports card producers, Bowman and Leaf Candy Company. Both produced their first football card sets, each consisting of about 100 cards of then-current players from the National Football League, with the Leaf set including a number of prominent college players. Leaf's set had also the distinction of being the first post-war cards in color. Leaf only went on to produce one more set, a skip-numbered set in 1949. However, Bowman continued producing sets, from 1950 through 1955. In addition, Topps Chewing Gum Company produced its first set in 1950. Bowman would be bought out by Topps in 1956. That year, Topps produced a new card set (after producing sets of historic college players in 1950, 1951, and 1955).

Another cereal company, Kellogg's, released its first set in 1970. Kellogs would launch sets regularly until 1983. A new brand, Score, entered into market in 1989 with its collection of football cards. Two years later, Upper Deck obtained licenses from the NFL to produce trading cards. Upper Deck established itself so quickly that it rivaled Topps. Upper Deck produced cards under license of the NFL until 2010. In 1992, SkyBox International (a company founded only three years ago) produced its first set of football cards. Collector's Edge was another company that produced football cards in the 1990s.

History Located 16 miles northwest of Pearsall, the town was laid out by A.L. Oden in 1871. The river crossing it lay near was named for the fact that numerous cannonballs, swords, and sabers were found there. Juan De Ugalde in the 18th century, Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna in 1836, and Adri√°n Woll in 1842 were all thought to have used the Presidio Crossing. The first mail to the town was delivered by horseback from Benton City; later, it arrived by stagecoach from San Antonio. In 1871, Frio City became the first county seat of Frio County. Carting cypress shingles from Leakey, L.J.W. Edwards completed the first Frio County courthouse in January 1872. The same year, the town's stone jail was built. The jail eventually housed such famed outlaws as Sam Bass, Jesse James, Frank James, and writer William Sydney Porter. With the rise in construction, high-cost building material from out of town became impractical and led to the establishment of a cypress shingle mill, brick factory, and lime kiln in Frio City. In 1872, the town started delivering its own mail with the establishment of a post office in Frio City with James McClain Elledge at its helm. The town's first merchant was L.J.W. Edwards and the first school in Frio County was a private home in Frio City. During the 1870s, a local chapter of the Freemasons was established. In 1877, the courthouse burned down and was replaced by a two-story, native-stone building, funded in part by wealthy local resident W.J. Slaughter. The new courthouse reportedly once had an ornate walnut staircase. In the mid-1870s, Indian attacks in and around Frio City caused the Texas Rangers to be called in, and many frontier residents sought shelter in town. The last major Indian attack in the area occurred in the spring of 1877.Frio Town, Texas: Handbook of Texas Online, University of Texas at Austin Growth Frio City became known as a \\"cowboy capital\\" and cultural center during the 1870s. By the 1880s, estimates of its population hovered around 1,500. Evangelists John Wesley DeVilbiss and Andrew Jackson Potter preached in the area and the Rio Grande Baptist Association was organized in Frio City in 1880. That same year, the International-Great Northern Railroad extended through Frio County, though it bypassed Frio City. Decline With the establishment of the town of Pearsall along the rail route, people began to leave Frio City. By 1883, Pearsall had become the county seat, and in 1886, Frio City changed its name to Frio Town. W. Yancey Kilgore purchased the Frio Town courthouse in 1884, it later housed a general store, the post office, and in 1884, the Frio Academy. By 1890, the population had fallen to 100, and in 1906, 17 pupils attended the two-teacher Frio Academy. The town slowly dwindled into obscurity even with the addition of telephone connections in 1914. During that year, Frio Town housed a general store and six cattle breeders. In 1929, the town had a school and five homes. In June 1930, the Rio Grande Baptist Association celebrated their 50th anniversary at the site of the old courthouse. By 1953, the townsite was mostly abandoned, and a Mrs. A.C. Roberts owned most of the structures, including the courthouse and roofless jail. The town's population remained steady at 20 throughout the 1960s and even jumped to 49 in 1969. By 1990, all that remained of the once-bustling Frio City was the Frio Town Cemetery and the largely intact ruins of the original courthouse and jail on the private Roberts Ranch. The ruins of the courthouse are considered a historic courthouse by the Texas Historical Commission.Historic Courthouses : Texas Historical Commission References External links * Category:Geography of Frio County, Texas Category:Ghost towns in South Texas ","title":"Frio Town"},{"id":"7129798","title":"Try Whistling This"},{"id":"7129800","text":"The 184th Infantry Regiment (Second California) is an infantry regiment of the United States Army consisting of soldiers from the California Army National Guard.

History The 184th Infantry Regiment is a descendant of a number of unofficial militias that were formed in California in the mid-to-late-19th century. Bravo Company is the direct descendant of the Sarsfield Grenadier Guards. Charlie Company is the direct descendant of the Auburn Greys. In its dual role in service to both the United States of America and the State of California, the regiment can be mobilized to serve under state control. The 184th Infantry Regiment was formed on 20 October 1924 from what had been known as the 2d Infantry Regiment (California). 1864‚Äì95 Precursors to 2d Infantry (California) On 9 December 1895, the 2d Infantry Regiment (California) was formed by consolidating the 1st Artillery Regiment (California) with the 8th Infantry Regiment (California). The headquarters of the 2d Infantry Regiment (California) was in Sacramento and the unit was part of the California National Guard. The lineage of these two units is described below. :1st Artillery Regiment (California). On 19 March 1880, the 1st Artillery Regiment (California) was formed from the consolidation of the Sacramento Light Artillery (California) and the 1st Infantry Battalion (California). The headquarters of the 1st Artillery Regiment (California) was in Sacramento and the unit was part of the California National Guard. ::Sacramento Light Artillery (California). In 1864, the Sacramento Light Artillery (California) was formed from precursor militia elements in Sacramento as part of the California Militia. (Note: On 2 April 1866, the California Militia was redesignated as the California National Guard.) ::1st Infantry Battalion (California). On 15 March 1872, the 4th Infantry Regiment (California) was formed from precursor militia elements, including the Sarsfield Grenadier Guards as G company, as part of the California National Guard. From 1875 through 1877, the 1st Infantry Battalion (California) was formed through the reduction, reorganization, and redesignation of the 4th Infantry Regiment (California). The headquarters of the 4th Infantry Regiment (California) was in Sacramento and the unit was part of the California National Guard. :8th Infantry Regiment (California). On 15 February 1890, the 8th Infantry Battalion (California) was formed from precursor militia elements with headquarters in Chico, as part of the California National Guard. On 31 October 1891, the 8th Infantry Regiment (California) was formed through the expansion, reorganization, and redesignation of the 8th Infantry Battalion (California). The headquarters of the 8th Infantry Regiment (California) was in Chico and the unit was part of the California National Guard. 1895‚Äì1924 2d Infantry (California) Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War From 6‚Äì9 July 1898, three of the companies from the 2d Infantry Regiment (California) were mustered into federal service in Fruitvale as part of the 8th California Volunteer Infantry for service during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Although the units were mobilized for federal service, they never left the United States. From 28 January 1899 through 6 February 1899, the three companies were demobilized in Washington and California and returned to the 2d Infantry Regiment (California). On 11 May 1907, the 2d Infantry Regiment (California) was reduced and consolidated with the 6th Infantry Regiment (California) (which had originally been organized on 22 July 1885 as the 6th Infantry Battalion (California)) to form the 2d Infantry Regiment (California), with headquarters in Sacramento, as part of the California National Guard. 1916 Mexican Border Crisis On 18 June 1916, the 2d Infantry Regiment (California) was mobilized for border security duty during the Mexican Border Crisis. On 15 November 1916, the unit was demobilized. World War I =Mobilization, restructuring and training= On 26 March 1917, the 2d Infantry Regiment (California) was mobilized into federal service for World War I. Many of the units were well prepared for the mobilization because of the recent experience of mobilizing in support of the Mexican Border Crisis. In response to the consolidation of so many state militias, the United States Army created a new division system, and needed to fit the various state militias into the system. Originally, the 2d Infantry Regiment (California) was organized as part of the 19th Division, which consisted of various elements of state militias from Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah. On 16 September 1917, the 19th Division was redesignated as the 40th Division at Camp Kearny near San Diego, California. At that time, the division was referred to simply as the 40th Division because there were no armored or cavalry divisions. On 24 September 1917, the 2d Infantry Regiment (less the 2d Battalion, Companies L and M, and the Sanitary Detachment) was consolidated with the 5th Infantry Regiment (California) and redesignated the 159th Infantry Regiment, 40th Division. On 25 September 1917, the 2d Infantry Regiment's 2d Battalion, companies L and M, and the Sanitary Detachment were consolidated with the 7th Infantry Regiment (California) and redesignated the 160th Infantry Regiment, 40th Division. In November 1917, the 40th Division moved to continue training at either Camp Lewis near Seattle, Washington, which had finished construction and opened for training purposes only two months earlier, or Fort Funston near San Francisco, California. Although the units had received an infusion of new soldiers and equipment and had begun training for war in earnest, almost immediately the soldiers and equipment were being siphoned off to form new units. This was the start of what the unit would experience for the rest of the war. =Operations in theater= In August 1918, the 40th Division arrived in France. At that moment, the Germans had just completed a series of offensives that started on 21 March and ended on 15 July. These offensives were designed to destroy the American Expeditionary Force before it could be fully constituted, and they almost succeeded. Upon the arrival of the 40th Division in France, it was decided that the division would be used as a depot and it was redesignated as the 6th Depot Division, supplying fresh troops to the more experienced combat divisions. By the end of the war, the 40th Division provided more than 27,000 replacements to the 26th, 28th, 32d, 77th, 80th, 81st, 82d, and 89th Divisions. Of those soldiers provided from the 40th Infantry Division, 2,587 members were killed in action and 11,596 were wounded. An additional 103 were to die of their wounds at the Post Hospital in Camp Kearny near San Diego, California. =Demobilization and restructuring= On 20 April 1919, the 40th Division was demobilized at Camp Kearny near San Diego, California, where they had been formed just two years before. On 1 May 1919, those elements of the 2d Infantry Regiment (California) that were used to create the 159th Infantry Regiment were released from federal service at the Presidio of San Francisco near San Francisco, California. On 7 May 1919, those elements of the 2d Infantry Regiment (California) that were used to create the 160th Infantry Regiment were returned to the 2d Infantry Regiment (California) at Camp Kearny near San Diego, California. Decorations The 2d Infantry Regiment (California) received a campaign streamer (without inscription) for service. The 184th Infantry Regiment proudly displays this streamer as a descendant of the 2d Infantry Regiment (California). 1924‚Äìpresent 184th Infantry On 20 October 1924, the 184th Infantry Regiment was formed as a result of the reconstitution and reorganization of the northern and central California elements of the 2nd Infantry Regiment (California). The San Francisco area elements of the 2nd Infantry Regiment (California) were not included. The headquarters of the 184th Infantry Regiment (California) was in Sacramento and the unit was once again a part of the 40th Division of the California National Guard. 1927 Folsom State Prison riots In November 1927, elements of the 184th Infantry Regiment were mobilized to assist with quelling a riot at Folsom State Prison. From 18 February 1929 through 1 April 1929, the 185th Infantry Regiment was formed as a result of the withdrawal, expansion, reorganization, and redesignation of the central California elements of the 184th Infantry Regiment. 1934 West coast waterfront strike On 9 May 1934, longshoremen and sailors throughout the West Coast of the United States began a strike that would last for 83 days. On 5 July, elements of the 184th Infantry Regiment, along with other members of the California National Guard, were mobilized to restore order in San Francisco's waterfront when hostilities during the strike escalated. World War II =Mobilization, restructuring, and training= On 3 March 1941, the entire 184th Infantry Regiment was mobilized as part of a general mobilization of the United States Army National Guard, and mustered at Camp San Luis Obispo. Most of the soldiers believed that they would be mobilized for a year and then sent home, which changed on 7 December 1941 when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. Within 48 hours of the attack on Pearl Harbor, the regiment moved to the San Diego area and took up defensive positions for the expected attack or invasion of the West Coast of the United States. The regiment was scattered throughout a number of areas including Del Mar, La Mesa, and Lindbergh Field, while Company A was sent to San Clemente Island. If the Japanese attack had occurred, this lone company of Sacramentans would have been decimated since there was no avenue of retreat or reinforcement. The regiment remained in the greater San Diego area until April, when (similar to the mobilization for World War I) they were stationed at Fort Lewis near Seattle, Washington and later to the Presidio of San Francisco near San Francisco, California. In June 1942, while at the Presidio, the regiment was relieved from the 40th Infantry Division and attached directly to the Western Defense Command. In November 1942, while still officially under the control of the Western Defense Command, the regiment was attached to the 7th Infantry Division at Fort Ord and later Amphibious Training Force Nine. It was during this period that the regiment was reinforced and its title modified to \\"184th Regimental Combat Team\\". =Operations in theater= Aleutian Islands Campaign In July 1943, the regiment left San Francisco bound for the Japanese-held Kiska in the Aleutian Islands, Alaska during the Aleutian Islands Campaign. The 184th arrived on Adak Island for training and was assigned again to the 7th Infantry Division. On 15 August 1943, the regiment participated in Operation Cottage, the retaking of the last Japanese-held island in the Aleutians. The regiment, augmented by the 1st Battalion, 87th Mountain Infantry Regiment, and with the 13th Canadian Infantry Brigade Group on its right, made its first of many assault landings at Long Beach on Kiska Island. When the regiment landed, its commander, Colonel Curtis D. O'Sullivan, ordered the regiment's band to play. They responded with \\"California, Here I Come,\\" and \\"The Maple Leaf Forever.\\" After an unopposed landing, the regiment found that the Japanese garrison had been evacuated by a large cruiser and destroyer force on 28 July. The enemy had left in such a hurry that they left mess tables still set with meals, and blankets soaked in fuel oil, but not lit. Nevertheless, the regiment did have the honor of being the only National Guard regiment to regain lost American soil from a foreign enemy in World War II, the first since the War of 1812. On 23 August 1943, the regiment was officially assigned to the 7th Infantry Division. In September 1943, when the island was declared secure, the regiment moved to Schofield Barracks, Hawaii. This was a welcome change for the men who just spent over three months on the Alaskan islands, but it did not last long. Battle of Kwajalein On 20 January 1944, the regiment left Hawaii bound for the Marshall Islands. Kwajalien Atoll had been Japanese territory for decades. As such, they had many opportunities to build a complex system of fortifications. On 1 February 1944, the regiment, along with the 32d Infantry Regiment assaulted the heavily defended atoll. Two days later, Companies A, B and C were given the assignment to clear the highly fortified blockhouse sector. Approximately five days later, when the battle for Kwajalien was over, more than 8,000 Japanese soldiers of the 61st Naval Guard Force were killed in action. General George C. Marshall, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, later said that the operations on Kwajalien were the most efficient of the war. Once again, the regiment achieved another first, as they were the first National Guard unit to seize and hold territory that Japan held prior to the start of the war. With the island secure, the regiment re-embarked on to their transports and returned to Hawaii for rehabilitation and more training. On 15 September 1944, they departed Hawaii, bound for Eniwetok Island. Initially, this was to be a staging area for the invasion of Yap Island. When they arrived, however, they found that the operation had been canceled in favor of a larger landing, the liberation of the Philippines. Battle of Leyte Leyte On the morning of 20 October 1944, the regiment landed on the beaches near Dulag on the east coast of the island of Leyte. With the beachhead secured, they moved inland. The island provided the Japanese with an ideal defensive terrain, as Leyte is a large island, covered with mountains, rain forests, and swamps. The Japanese were long accustomed to fighting in the jungle, and had over three years of occupation to learn the terrain and plan defenses. Additionally, it was easy for the Japanese to reinforce their garrison on Leyte from Luzon in the north and Mindanao in the south. The Japanese 34th Army, consisting of four divisions, including the infamous 16th Division that was credited for the \\"Rape of Nanking\\" and the \\"Bataan Death March,\\" was the primary opponent on Leyte. The 184th Infantry Regiment pushed through the Dulag Valley and experienced high casualties. When the Japanese counterattacked the 32d Infantry Regiment, which had spread out along the Palanas River, the 184th was sent to reinforce them. Several attacks were repulsed and the enemy was driven into the bamboo thickets. This action later became known as The Battle of Shoestring Ridge. On 28 November 1944, the 11th Airborne Division relieved the division, less the 17th Infantry Regiment. The division then moved to Baybay, and the 184th started a drive from Damulaan towards the port of Ormac. They then seized the town Albuere and had joined up with soldiers of the 77th Infantry Division, which had landed near Ormac. The remainder of the 7th then moved to Ormac to regroup. From there, they spent several weeks landing on and securing several of the small islands that surround Leyte. On 10 February 1945, they were relieved by the Americal Division and started to prepare for the Ryukyus Campaign. When the division left, they were credited with inflicting more than 54,000 enemy deaths. Battle of Okinawa On 1 April 1945, the division landed on Okinawa. Initially, the 7th and 96th Infantry Divisions were to clear the southern end of the island. Fortunately for these thinly spread forces, an expected counterattack did not occur. If it had, there was a possibility that the Japanese could have driven the invasion force into the sea. On 5 April, the 184th Infantry Regiment encountered typically fierce Japanese opposition at a rocky pinnacle located about 1,000 yards southwest of Arakachi (later dubbed \\"The Pinnacle\\"). A few days after the landing, the 184th came into contact with elements of the Japanese 32d Army on the heavily fortified Kakazu Ridge. On 9 April, with the assistance of massed artillery fire, Tomb Hill was captured. By now, companies were losing 30 to 50 men per day. Rifle companies of 40 or 50 men became the rule. On 1 May, despite the presence of infiltrators, the 184th attacked and briefly held Gala Ridge before losing it to a counterattack. Both sides traded blow for blow until the Japanese fell back to their final defensive positions along the Naha-Shuri-Yanabarau Road. In keeping with their motto, \\"Let's Go,\\" the 184th, using a rainstorm to cover their movements, outflanked the Japanese positions and effectively cut off their forces on the Chenin Peninsula. All that was left to do was mop up the scattered pockets of resistance on the peninsula. When the campaign ended, the Japanese 32d Army had lost tens of thousand of its soldiers. The 184th had lost hundreds. Surrender of Japan ‚Äì Occupation of Korea The 7th Infantry Division began planning for an invasion that was to make Okinawa look easy ‚Äì the invasion of the Japanese Home Islands. The dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki ended the need for the landings. If they had taken place, some predicted that over a million deaths would have occurred on both sides. Instead, the 7th was rushed to Korea to disarm the Japanese garrison there and to provide an occupation force. When the regiment arrived in Seoul, they had the honor of accepting the surrender of all Japanese forces in that region. While there, the regiment would lose many of its members to rotation, although there were few of the original members of regiment left by now. Those who didn't have enough points to be rotated home were used to help reform the 31st Infantry Regiment that had been destroyed on Bataan. It is ironic that the 184th, who helped destroy the Japanese 16th Division, would be rebuilding the regiment destroyed by the 16th. When the 31st Infantry Regiment was fully reconstituted, it replaced the 184th in the 7th Infantry Division's Order of Battle. On 20 January 1946, the 184th Infantry Regiment was inactivated in Korea. =Demobilization= On 5 August 1946, the 184th Infantry Regiment was relieved from assignment to the 7th Infantry Division and was assigned to the 49th Infantry Division of the California National Guard. =Decorations= The 184th Infantry Regiment received four Asiatic Pacific Theater streamers with the following inscriptions: ALEUTIAN ISLANDS 1942‚Äì1943, EASTERN MANDATES 1944 (with arrowhead), LEYTE 1944‚Äì1945 (with arrowhead) and RYUKYUS 1945. The regiment also received a Philippine Presidential Unit Citation with an accompanying streamer embroidered 17 OCTOBER 1944 TO 4 JULY 1945 and a Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation with an accompanying streamer embroidered KOREA 1945‚Äì1946. Post‚ÄìWorld War II era On 10 October 1946, the 184th Infantry Regiment was reorganized and federally recognized, with headquarters in Sacramento, as part of the 49th Infantry Division of the California National Guard. On 1 May 1959, the 184th Infantry Regiment was reorganized as the 184th Infantry, a parent regiment under the Combat Arms Regimental System, to consist of the 1st and 2d Battle Groups, elements of the 49th Infantry Division of the California National Guard. The lineage of Company A, 184th Infantry Regiment was used to form HHC, 1st Battle Group, 184th Infantry, while the lineage of Company B, 184th Infantry Regiment was used to form HHC, 2d Battle Group, 184th Infantry. The term \\"regiment\\" was no longer used because regiments were no longer in the force structure, having been replaced by battle groups, and regimental numbers were only used for purposes of lineage and honors. On 1 March 1963, the 184th Infantry was reorganized to consist of the 1st and 2d Battalions, elements of the 49th Infantry Division of the California National Guard. =Watts riots= In August 1965, the 1st and 2d Battalions of the 184th Infantry were mobilized in response to the Watts riots. The battalions were mobilized as part of the 49th Infantry Division, which arrived after much of the rioting had ended. On 4 December 1965, the 184th Infantry was reorganized to consist of the 1st Battalion, an element of the 49th Infantry Division of the California National Guard. On 29 January 1968, the 184th Infantry was reorganized to consist of the 1st Battalion, an element of the 49th Infantry Brigade of the California National Guard. On 1 November 1976, the 184th Infantry was reorganized to consist of the 1st battalion, an element of the 40th Armored Division of the California National Guard. =Los Angeles riots= In April 1992, elements of the first battalion were mobilized under state and federal control in response to the Los Angeles riots. 21st century =Operation Desert Spring= In 2001, Companies A and B of the 1st Battalion (augmented with soldiers from other battalion elements) were mobilized under federal control for deployment to Kuwait. The soldiers conducted readiness processing and training at Camp Roberts. In July 2001, Company A arrived in Kuwait. In January 2002, Company A was replaced by Company B and returned to California in July 2002. Soldiers from the 1st Battalion provided security at Camp Doha and at several Patriot missile battery sites along the border with Iraq. Although the deployment was scheduled as a routine mission, the 11 September 2001 attacks occurred while Company A was in Kuwait, thus the mission changed to become part of the Global War on Terrorism. Company A returned to California as scheduled in January 2002. Company B returned to California as scheduled in July 2002. Both units returned from theater to Camp Roberts near Paso Robles, California for demobilization activities. While the 1st Battalion did not receive campaign participation credit, those soldiers who served with Companies A and B during this mobilization received either the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal or the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal. =2004‚Äì06 Iraq= In August 2004, the entire 1st Battalion was mobilized for a deployment in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom 05-06. The battalion was initially mobilized to Camp Roberts near Paso Robles, California for initial readiness processing. On 16 August 2004, the battalion was transferred to Fort Bliss near El Paso, Texas for four months of pre-deployment training. In early January 2005, the battalion moved to Fort Polk in Louisiana for a readiness evaluation prior to movement into theater. In late January 2005, the battalion arrived in Kuwait to acclimate and conduct final training and organization prior to moving into Iraq. In late February 2005, the battalion arrived in Baghdad, Iraq and was attached to the 4th Brigade Combat Team, 3d Infantry Division. On 23 March, the battalion assumed control of an area of operations in central and southern Baghdad from the 1st Battalion, 153d Infantry Regiment, and conducted full spectrum combat operations out of FOB Falcon and the Green Zone. The battalion's area of operations included the Karrada and Dora neighborhoods of southern Baghdad. Several active duty units were attached to the 1st Battalion to form \\"Task Force Nightstalker\\" under the command of the battalion HQ, including one company of M1A1 Abrams tanks from the 4th Battalion, 64th Armor Regiment. The battalion's Charlie company was temporarily assigned to provide security at the Convention Center in the Green Zone during the 16 March first meeting of the transitional National Assembly that was elected on 30 January, assuming control of the Convention Center from a company of the 2d Battalion, 325th Infantry Regiment and relinquishing control less than two months later to the 13th \\"Shavnabada\\" Infantry Battalion from the Republic of Georgia. The battalion provided security during the constitutional referendum held on 15 October and the election of the Council of Representatives on 15 December. In January, the battalion was relieved by a company of the 2d Battalion, 506th Infantry Regiment as part of planned operations to increase the role of Iraqi Army and Police forces in the area as a substitute for United States forces. A list of twelve of the soldiers assigned to the battalion who were killed in action during this mobilization, not including five soldiers from units who were attached to Task Force Nightstalker, is available here. Not since the Korean War had a unit from California had as many combat casualties. The battalion returned to Fort Bliss near El Paso, Texas in January for demobilization processing, and returned to California in January. The battalion received two Iraq Campaign streamers with the following inscriptions: IRAQI GOVERNANCE 2004‚Äì2005 and NATIONAL RESOLUTION 2005‚Äì2007. The battalion also received a Valorous Unit Award and streamer with the inscription BAGHDAD 2005. =2005 Hurricane Katrina Task Force California= On 1 September 2005, Soldiers assigned to the first battalion's rear detachment (not forward deployed to Iraq) were mobilized under federal control as part Task Force California in response to Hurricane Katrina. The Soldiers were sent to New Orleans, Louisiana as part of Task Force California to help restore order to the city and surrounding area and provide humanitarian assistance. The Soldiers assisted the local residents in the aftermath of one of the most severe natural disasters to occur in the United States. The Soldiers who mobilized in support of relief operations in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina were released from active duty on 11 November 2005. =2006 Operation Aero Shield= In August 2006, elements of the 1st Battalion were mobilized under state control in response to a planned terrorist attack that was disrupted in the planning stages in the United Kingdom. =2007 California wildfires= Soldiers from Company C, 1‚Äì184th Infantry pose for a photo at Qualcomm Stadium on 29 October 2007.On 22 October 2007, elements of the 1st Battalion were mobilized under state control in response to widespread wildfires near San Diego. Elements of the battalion, although they mustered in northern California, were nonetheless some of the first California National Guard elements to occupy Montgomery Airfield in San Diego. In addition to other elements of the California National Guard, the battalion used Montgomery Airfield as their primary base of operations to conduct local civil support missions throughout San Diego County. The battalion augmented local security at several sites, including Qualcomm Stadium, that were established to support local residents who were forced to evacuate their homes. In addition, elements of the battalion augmented local authorities throughout the area, conducting patrols of evacuated neighborhoods and manning checkpoints. As a link to their progenitors of the 2d Infantry Regiment (California) in World War I, Montgomery Airfield is located two miles south of MCAS Miramar, which was previously named Camp Kearny. Camp Kearny was the site where many of the soldiers in the 2d Infantry Regiment (California) were mobilized and demobilized for service during World War I. =2008 California wildfires= In July 2008, elements of the 1st Battalion were mobilized under state control in response to widespread wildfires throughout California. The battalion completed hand crew training for wildland fire fighting in conjunction with the United States Forest Service at McClellan Airfield, but the battalion was never selected to perform actual wildland fire fighting. =2008‚Äì09 Iraq= In August 2008, the 1st Battalion's Companies A and B (augmented with soldiers from other battalion elements) were mobilized for a deployment in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom 08-09. The companies were released from the 184th Infantry Regiment and reassigned to the 1st Battalion, 185th Armor Regiment. The two companies performed combat logistical patrols throughout northern Iraq. In August 2009, the two companies returned to California. While the 1st Battalion did not receive campaign participation credit, those soldiers who served with Companies A and B during this deployment earned Iraq Campaign credit for IRAQI SURGE and IRAQI SOVEREIGNTY. The two companies also were awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation as part of the 230th Combat Support Sustainment Battalion, Tennessee Army National Guard. =2008‚Äì09 Kosovo= In December 2008, the 1st Battalion's HQ and Company D were mobilized for a deployment in support of Operation Joint Guardian. In addition to these companies, \\"Task Force Nightstalker\\" consisted of Company A from the 1st Battalion, 185th Armor Regiment and Company E from the Special Troops Battalion, 79th Infantry Brigade Combat Team. Task Force Nightstalker was once again assigned to the 40th Infantry Division. The task force conducted initial readiness processing and training at Camp Roberts in November 2008. In December 2008, the task force moved to Camp Atterbury in Indiana for additional training. In January 2009, the task force moved to JMRC Hohenfels for final validation training prior to moving into the Kosovo theater. Soldiers from the 184th Infantry conduct live fire training in Kosovo on 20 July 2009.The task force operated in Kosovo as part of Multinational Task Force East (KFOR 11). The task force operated as one of two maneuver task forces tasked with providing a safe and secure environment and ensuring freedom of movement in accordance with United Nations Resolution 1244. On 7 March, the task force assumed control of an area of operations in the Gnjilane, Kamenica, and Novo Brdo areas of eastern Kosovo from the 1st Battalion, 129th Field Artillery Regiment. The majority of the stability and support operations were conducted by the task force out of Camp Bondsteel. In addition to normal operations, task force Soldiers also maintained their proficiency with live fire exercises. In October 2009, Task Force Nightstalker began familiarization training with their relief force, the 231st Maneuver Task Force, a unit consisting of soldiers from both the 231st Brigade Support Battalion (ND ARNG) and the 137th Infantry Regiment (KS ARNG). In late October, Task Force Nightstalker officially handed over responsibility for their area of operations to the 231st Maneuver Task Force. In November 2009, the task force departed Kosovo to conduct demobilization operations at Fort Lewis near Seattle, Washington and returned to California a few weeks later. The battalion received one Kosovo Campaign streamer with the following inscription: KOSOVO DEFENSE CAMPAIGN. Individual Soldiers may also have received the Kosovo Campaign Medal and the NATO Non-Article 5 Medal. =2017‚Äì18 Jordan= For a year, elements of the Regiment, deployed to Jordan for Operation Spartan Shield. In 2018, they were relieved by elements of the 18th Cavalry. =2017-18 Qatar, Bahrain, Kosovo, and Hawaii= For a year, elements of the Regiment, deployed to Qatar to provide security for the Al Udeid Air Base. Other elements of the Regiment went to Bahrain, Kosovo as well as the aforementioned deployment to Jordan. After the deployments some elements went to Hawaii to assist in training.https://www.army.mil/article/224358/the_cal_guards_thunderbolt_brigade_reunites_for_annual_training_2019 Subordinate units Only the 1st Battalion remains an active unit. The 2d Battalion was inactivated on 29 January 1968 during a reorganization of California Army National Guard forces. The 3d Battalion (pre-Pentomic battle group era) was inactivated when the regiment was reorganized on 1 May 1949. First Battalion The 1st Battalion currently serves as one of two infantry battalions of the 79th Infantry Brigade Combat Team.

The PSWL was a member of the National Baseball Congress. The PSWL League Champion represented the league annually at the National Baseball Congress World Series in Wichita, Kansas. The original league consists of 4 teams: Tucson Nationals, Casa Grande Cotton Kings, Mesa Garden of Gears and the Bisbee Copper Kings. Former teams like the Lake Havasu City Heat and the Palm Springs Power were one of the founding teams in the first season of 2000. Due to financial instability in 2011, the PSBL announced they will fold and any remaining teams will join the renamed Pacific Southwest Collegiate Baseball League for the 2012 season.

The Havasu Heat did not participate in 2009 in order to prepare the organization for their move to Kansas. The PSWL consisted of 4 teams in Arizona that included college baseball players not only from Arizona, but from colleges and universities throughout the United States. The four teams included the Tucson Nationals, Casa Grande Cotton Kings, Mesa Garden of Gears and the Bisbee Copper Kings. Some games are played in Goodyear, Arizona and Green Valley, Arizona where former PSWL teams had been in the early 2000s. The Mesa Garden of Gears won the PSWL regular season championship in 2009. The Tucson Nationals hosted the 2009 PSWL Championship Tournament at Tucson Electric Park (former home of the Arizona Diamondbacks affiliate AAA Tucson Sidewinders). The 2009 tournament championship was won by the Casa Grande Cotton Kings. By taking the championship, the Cotton Kings secured the PSWL's automatic bid in the 2009 NBC World Series in Kansas. The 2009 season also marked the centennial for the Bisbee Copper Kings' historic Warren Ballpark, it is the oldest continuously operated ballpark in the United States and during the 2009 season the ballpark celebrated its 100th year of continuous operation. A special exhibition game was played between the Bisbee Copper Kings and the El Paso Sun Kings in honor of the two teams (Bisbee and El Paso) that played in the first game at Warren Ballpark 100 years ago. The PSWL also played teams from the Rocky Mountain Baseball League, the El Paso Sun Kings and the Davis‚ÄìMonthan Air Force Base U.S. Air Force Team during the 2009 season. 2010 season The Pacific Southwest Baseball League will play under the name Pacific Southwest League for the 2010 season. The league will consist of 8 teams for the upcoming season including the Tucson Nationals, Tucson Outlaws, Casa Grande Cotton Kings, Yuma Scorpions (not to be confused with the Golden Baseball League team of the same name), Bisbee Copper Kings, Prescott Bears, Green Valley Sox and Nogales Owls. The Mesa Garden of Gears are now affiliated with the Bisbee Copper Kings after an off-season merger between the two organizations. An exhibition team represents Luke Air Force Base of Surprise, Arizona and the US Army team of Sierra Vista, Arizona. 2011 season It is thought the league after first disbanding in 2008, will not return in 2011 due to financial issues. The Bisbee Miners of the Arizona Winter League acquired the bygone Copper Kings, while the Cotton Kings and new Garden of Gears are independent, and the rest of the league went to the Rocky Mountain League. The Tucson Outlaws folded while the city now hosts the Tucson Padres of the AAA level Pacific Coast League and has a rival team, the Tucson Toros of the independent AA level Golden Baseball League, but postponed its inaugural season. The Tucson Nationals are expected to be an independent team. The Yuma, Arizona Bandits want to join the Sou. Cal.

Yuma is the home base of two minor leagues: the Arizona Summer League (the Yuma Panthers) and co-owned Arizona Winter League (the Yuma Scorpions winter league team).  2012 season  The 2012 Southwest Collegiate Baseball League never got off the ground. The Southwest Collegiate Baseball League was to be the reincarnation of the PSBL. The Southwest Collegiate Baseball League had intentions to have 10 opponents, due to limited schedule by teams not able to afford the costs of long-distance travel, have to play in divisions with 5 teams each.

First described by zoologist George Albert Boulenger in 1913, P. aurotaenia is known for being the third most poisonous frog in the world. It is the smallest of the poison dart frogs in the Phyllobates genus and is endemic to the Pacific coast of Colombia. Wild specimens store batrachotoxin in glands in their skin, which can be fatal to humans in doses as small as 100 ¬µg. The unique lethality of their poison is a trait often exploited by certain Native American peoples of Colombia for hunting. The members of this species are characterized by: black dorsums, sometimes covered by orange suffusions; green, yellow, orange, or brownish gold dorsolateral stripes; and black abdomens with blue or green dots. The name Phyllobates aurotaenia is currently applied to two forms: a smaller, large-stripe form and a larger, small-stripe form. These forms are separated by a ravine yet retain the ability to interbreed. The number and range of P. aurotaenia is declining, primarily due to loss of habitat, and is currently classified as Least Concern by the IUCN. Range and habitat P. aurotaenia is found in the wet forests of the Choco region of Colombia, west of the Andes, in the Atrato and San Juan drainages. It lives on the ground of humid lowland and submontane forests, typically between altitudes of 60 and 520 meters, and is found in primary and secondary forest but not in degraded areas. As a vivarium subject, this frog is an active animal that will make use of vertical space. Kokoe dart frogs are highly social frogs that require high humidity, cool temperatures, and larger prey items than many dart frogs. Mating P. aurotaenia usually performs mating calls while concealed beneath fallen leaves or logs, but occasionally while sitting on top of leaf litter. Their calls have been described as a loud, bird-like whirring twitter that consists of rapidly repeated notes, repeated at irregular intervals of several seconds and lasting up to 45 seconds. These frogs do not engage in wrestling behavior among each other as do many other dart frogs. Males vying for a female will face off, calling loudly until one backs down. Unlike the other Phyllobates species, these frogs will not breed in coconut shells; they prefer to lay their eggs inside a narrow tube (small film canisters or nut pods) on the ground. Female P. aurotaenia lay their clutch of eggs, averaging 15-20, in leaf-litter and the male takes the tadpoles to slow-flowing water after the eggs hatch. Toxicity P. aurotaenia is one of the most lethal species of the poison dart frogs, which is attributed to their storage and release of batrachotoxin from cutaneous granular glands scattered throughout the frogs‚Äô bodies. This extremely potent toxin is a steroidal alkaloid which, in mammals, acts by irreversibly binding to and permanently opening sodium ion channels within nerve and muscle cells. This prevents repolarization of the cell membrane and halts further signaling, resulting in paralysis and often death as any affected muscle becomes locked in the contracted state. In order to avoid self-intoxication the frogs have developed modified sodium channels to prevent the binding of batrachotoxin. Although wild frogs are extremely deadly, frogs raised in captivity are generally non-toxic. It has therefore been proposed that the frogs do not synthesize batrachotoxin themselves, but it is instead obtained from their environment. Evidence suggests that the frogs accumulate this toxin through their diet of various beetles (ex: melyrid beetles), millipedes, and flies as well as the unique composition of leaf litter on the forest floor. Value P. aurotaenia is one of three species known to be used for poisoning darts; the others being P. terribilis and P. bicolor. The Choc√≥ Native Americans of the upper San Juan drainage region of Colombia attract and capture these species by imitating their calls. Because they release their poison only under stress, the poison is extracted by piercing the frogs through the mouth with a wooden skewer and holding them over a fire. The Choc√≥an people then coat their darts by rubbing the darts across the backs of the frogs.

Murder Parsons was facing capital charges for the April 21, 2005, murder of Chillicothe Police Officer Larry R. Cox following a gas station robbery. On that evening, Chillicothe police responded to a report of a car being stolen from a restaurant. Just 15 minutes later, chased by a Chillicothe police officer, the suspect bailed out of the car and took off running. At around 6 pm, as he walked from his parents' house to his own, off-duty Officer Larry Cox also took up the foot chase, and confronted the robber in an alleyway near Chestnut and North High streets. Cox was shot and killed in the alley. Several clues led investigators to John Parsons, whom police arrested July 10, 2005, and charged with the killing. He pleaded guilty and was given Life in prison Escape Parsons escaped from the Ross County jail on Saturday, July 29, 2006. He asked his mother for help in escaping, but she was arrested before plans could be made. Parsons made a rope from bed-sheets, newspaper and toilet paper, which he hid behind a brick in the wall of his cell. He used toothpaste and green and blue Jolly Ranchers to match the paint on the wall to disguise the broken mortar around the loose brick, which Parsons had carved out with a piece of metal from an air vent in his jail cell. As a fugitive, he was twice featured on the Fox television show America's Most Wanted.

It is one of the Borough's flagship parks, having won a Green Flag Award. Stamford Brook and Ravenscourt Park tube stations are close by. History The origins of Ravenscourt Park lie in the medieval manor and estate of Palingswick (or Paddenswick) Manor, located on the site and first recorded in the 12th century. The historic name still exists today in the name of Paddenswick Road, which runs along the north east boundary of the park. Medieval origins By the 13th century the manor house was a mansion surrounded by a moat fed by the Stamford Brook. The lake in the centre of the park today is a remnant of the original moat. King Edward III‚Äôs mistress Alice Perrers lived in the manor during the 14th century. 17th and 18th centuries The manor house was rebuilt in 1650 and in 1747 it was sold to Thomas Corbett who named it Ravenscourt, probably derived from the raven in his coat of arms, which was itself a pun on his name as corbeau is French for raven. 19th century Ravenscourt Park House, photographed in 1915 In 1812 the Ravenscourt House and estate were bought by its final private owner, George Scott, a builder and philanthropist who developed nearby St Peter‚Äôs Square. Scott employed leading landscaper Humphry Repton to lay out the gardens of the estate, and encouraged the building of houses along its edges. According to a park plan from 1830, there were 78 houses within the park, and by 1845 this number had risen to 330. In 1889, the first public library in Hammersmith opened in Ravenscourt House. Sale, development and public ownership In 1887, the Scott family sold the estate to a developer for building purposes, to be covered, it was said, with working-class dwellings. Counterproposals to prevent this, either by repurchasing the property by public subscription or by appealing for public purchase by the Metropolitan Board of Works, both failed, largely owing to the exorbitant price ‚Äì said to be well over ¬£70,000 ‚Äì demanded by the new freeholder. Blossoms in Ravenscourt Park However, it transpired that the ground-leases of the row of detached and semi-detached residences called Ravenscourt Park, extending southwards from No. 23, contained a proviso giving ground-tenants the right to forbid any building on the width of the park opposite their frontages. The new freeholder promptly took steps to remove this obstacle by buying out the rights of prohibition for small cash sums. Two of the ground-tenants, Ebenezer Stanley Burchett of 23 Ravenscourt Park and Frank Dethbridge of \\"The Hermitage\\", determined to block the development by demanding much larger sums of ¬£1000 each. Their action had the desired effect, and other lessees demanded similar sums. A total of at least ¬£10‚Äì¬£12,000 would have been added to the development costs, and this initiative effectively knocked the bottom out of the speculation. The freeholder became amenable to fresh negotiations, and eventually agreed to sell the property for the greatly reduced sum of ¬£58,000. It was acquired by the Metropolitan Board of Works (the Vestry of Hammersmith contributing half the purchase-money) on 20 November 1887. The Board of Works established a public park, laid out by J. J. Sexby, in the of land surrounding the House. It was opened on 19 May 1888. Management of the park was transferred to the London County Council in 1889, to the Greater London Council in 1965, and finally to the London Borough of Hammersmith in April 1971. A number of \\"lodges\\" (i.e. cottages) on the perimeters of the park were also transferred with the stipulation that they could only be inhabited by Council staff who worked there. 20th century Part of Ravenscourt House was used as a tuberculosis dispensary from 1918. In 1941 Ravenscourt House was severely damaged by incendiary bombs, during The Blitz, and was later demolished. Today, only the stable block remains, which now houses Ravenscourt Park's cafe, sometimes known as the Ravenscourt Park Tea House. Modern era The main avenue in Ravenscourt Park The park is part of the Conservation Area of Ravenscourt and Starch Green, and its north- eastern corner has been designated an Archaeological Priority Area. Today there is still much evidence of historic planting throughout the park, including plane trees and cedars. The park is home to two Great Trees of London, an old and stunted plane tree, and a large mature tree of heaven. Ravenscourt Park currently offers many facilities including tennis and basketball courts, a bowling green, an all-weather pitch, a walled garden, multiple play areas, and a paddling pool for children. There are two cafes in the park. The Tea House is run by Fait Maison and is nearest the Paddenswick Road entrance. W6 Cafe is located within the W6 Garden Centre on Ravenscourt Avenue near King Street. Friends of Ravenscourt Park is an organisation whose aim is \\"to maintain and improve a well used and loved park in west London.\\" A memorial in the park to Giles Hart was unveiled on 5 July 2008.

Sometimes called \\"campaign manuals,\\" most pressbooks took the form of large, multi-page brochures that were mailed to movie theaters in the interest of helping theaters attract an audience. A typical pressbook contained images of the various advertising \\"accessories\\" available to promote a movie, including images of the available film posters, lobby cards, and 8 x 10 film stills. They also contained the various newspaper advertisements exhibitor could employ in local newspaper advertising as well as short, feature pieces that could be planted in local newspapers, usually without cost. During Hollywood's Golden Age, pressbooks also contained various ideas for so-called exploitation campaigns, including souvenir-style give-aways, tie-ins and contests, as well as live promotional stunts. Most pressbooks also contained a list of the film's cast and crew credits (probably to assist local film critics.) A movie pressbook should be distinguished from a press book, which is a collection of works and communications used to represent an individual, group of individuals, service, company or product. Such press books are usually associated with professionals in the graphic arts, etc. but are used by people in many other professions as well.

The film is hosted by Adolph Caesar. Bruce Lee was deceased before the film went into production, and any footage featuring Lee was taken from earlier films or television appearances.http://www.sykografix.com/articles/article39/index.html It is considered to be an exploitation film or Bruceploitation, exploiting Bruce Lee's popularity, and the mystique surrounding his death. Plot TV reporter Adolph Caesar is outside Madison Square Garden before the start of a martial arts tournament that will apparently determine the \\"successor\\" to the legacy of Bruce Lee. He interviews martial arts promoter Aaron Banks, who says that Lee was actually killed by a kung fu move called \\"The Touch of Death.\\" Banks describes the move as being effective in \\"three to four weeks.\\" The segment contains a sequence of flashbacks to Bruce Lee ostensibly supporting Banks' assertion. From inside Madison Square Garden, Caesar discusses the competitors . He talks about the legacy of Bruce Lee, and shows what he describes as \\"interview footage\\" he did with Lee shortly before his death. Then, Caeser flashes back to earlier in the day, where action star Fred Williamson seen having to traverse through a number of obstacles to get to the tournament while being repeatedly mistaken for Harry Belafonte. Next, Ron Van Clief is also profiled and interviewed. Van Clief is then seen saving a woman from four hoodlums in a New York park. The middle section of the film is devoted to \\"The Bruce Lee Story,\\" a chronicle of Bruce Lee's early years in China, where he is depicted as being \\"karate crazy,\\" much to the dismay of his parents. The footage from this section of the story is from the 1957 Bruce Lee film Thunderstorm, which has also been redubbed.http://www.sykografix.com/articles/article39/index.html This act of the presentation purports that Lee was learning karate to live up to the legacy of his great grandfather, who was \\"one of China's greatest Samurai masters\\" (an anachronism as China did not actually have Samurai, these were in fact Japanese warriors).http://www.sykografix.com/articles/article39/index.html The life of Lee's grandfather is also portrayed in this act at alternating points, in scenes lifted from Invincible Super Chan. Later, Lee leaves home and lands a career as an actor. This segues into a scene of Bill Louie, dressed as Kato from The Green Hornet, saving two female joggers from being raped by a gang near the World War II memorial in Battery Park in broad daylight. This segment ends after Louie apparently murders the last conscious gang member with a throwing star. After Caesar announces the conclusion of \\"The Bruce Lee Story,\\" the film transitions back to Madison Square Garden, where a number of performers are showcased. Caesar interviews Fred Williamson, who denounces the idea of a contest to determine Bruce Lee's successor. The grande finale is devoted to a two-round kickboxing match, in which Louis Neglia reigns victorious. Adolph Caesar concludes the film with a final thought. Criticism Fist of Fear, Touch of Death is routinely lambasted by fans of martial arts movies for its complete ignorance not only of the facts of Bruce Lee's life, but of its apathy towards the culture of China (karate and samurais are constantly referred to as being Chinese, even though they are actually Japanese).http://www.sykografix.com/articles/article39/index.html Fans are also usually disappointed to learn that Bruce Lee had no actual involvement in this film (it was released 7 years after his death), despite the fact that his face is invariably plastered on posters and DVD boxes for the film.http://www.sykografix.com/articles/article39/index.html A typical reaction comes from the website \\"Movies in the Attic\\": > \\"I can't even explain how mind-bogglingly awful Fist Of Fear Touch Of Death > is. The worst part is how it insults the intelligence of the viewer who has > even mildly enjoyed a Bruce Lee movie. We hear Bruce Lee's grandpa was a > samurai.(The fact that samurais were from Japan and Bruce Lee is Chinese > notwithstanding) Just adds to the overall stupidity. Oh and then we get > footage of Bruce Lee explaining to his mother that he beats people up > because of his tradition of his samurai grandfather, what makes this movie > so unbelievably bad is that this footage is shot like a soap opera and is > then spliced in with a bad samurai movie.

He came from the Fur people of the Darfur region of the country. In the early 1970s, Bolad was nominated by the Islamist National Islamic Front to be the president of the Khartoum University Students Union (KUSU). He became the first KUSU president who was not from the Arab tribes along the Nile who dominate national politics. The position was seen as placing Bolad on the fast track to national political leadership as part of the 'western strategy' of Hassan al Turabi to gain the votes of Darfur and Kurdufan. Bolad's deputy and bodyguard at this time was Tayeb Ibrahim, nicknamed 'al Sikha' after the rebar with which he attacked student demonstrators.Flint, Julie and Alex de Waal, Darfur: A Short History of a Long War, Zed Books, London March 2006, , p. 20-21 However, Bolad was arrested in 1971 by the police of then-President Jaafar Nimeiry for his high-profile militant activity and severely tortured. Darfur Map  Racial Discrimination  After graduation Tayeb 'Sikha' rose up through the political establishment, while Bolad did not. The racial discrimination of the national political elite kept him from progressing, a charge he would make openly against the Muslim Brotherhood.Flint and de Waal, p. 21 Bolad would later write, \\"even when I go to the mosque to pray, even there, in the presence of God, for them I am still a slave [abd] and they will assign me a place related to my race.\\"Quoted in Prunier, G√©rard, Darfur: The Ambiguous Genocide, Cornell University Press, 2005, , p. 73 Bolad returned to Darfur and became a small businessman.  Separation from Islamic Movement  He had further second thoughts about the Islamist movement in 1988 after al Turabi silenced all criticism of the Libyan-backed violence in Darfur. (See History of Darfur.) He was briefly associated with the Sudan Socialist Union, the party of Nimeiry, and continued to drift to the political left. He was described as \\"obsessive and driven, meticulously and energetically building up his political network\\".  Building the resisting force  Frustrated and disillusioned, Bolad went to Chad in 1989 seeking the support of President Hiss√®ne Habr√© in starting a rebel movement in Darfur, but was rejected. He then went to Ethiopia to meet John Garang, leader of the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), which had been prosecuting the Second Sudanese Civil War in the south since 1983.Prunier, p. 73 Other prominent leftist Darfuri politicians, such as Ahmad Diraige, felt that the SPLA would use Darfur for its own purposes and refused to involve themselves.Flint and de Waal, p. 22 Bolad joined the SPLA in 1990 and received military training in South Kurdufan. He was made the political commissar of a SPLA military expedition into Darfur that began in November 1991 and proved disastrous.  SPLA military expedition  The given reason for the expedition was to spark a Darfuri guerilla movement and spread the civil war to the west, as had been done in the Nuba Mountains and Blue Nile.de Waal, Alex, \\"Counter-Insurgency on the Cheap\\", London Review of Books, 5 August 2004 SPLA chronicler Douglas Johnson suggests that the expedition may have been seen by the SPLA leadership as a diversionary tactic to create a rift in the north, like that created in the south by the splitting of the SPLA-Nasir faction under Riek Machar and Lam Akol. Ethiopian President Mengistu Haile Mariam, one of the major supporters of the SPLA, had recently been overthrown by the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front. SPLA-Torit (the faction led by Garang) was thus fully engaged in fighting SPLA-Nasir in the south and could not send help to Bolad's force once it ran into difficulty.Johnson, Douglas H., The Root Causes of Sudan's Civil Wars, Indiana University Press, 2003, , p. 140 There had been little advance preparation done in Darfur and Abd-el-Aziz al-Hilew, who had been named military commander of the expedition, did not receive enough equipment. The force was composed of Dinka fighters, who were perceived as foreigners in Darfur and the Mahdist networks, who were the only organized opposition to the government in Darfur, resented the insertion of a political competitor.Prunier, pp. 73-74 The force intended to reach sanctuary in the Marrah Mountains but had to cross an arid expanse controlled by Baggara Arabs in the dry season, in which the only sources of water were the village boreholes that were both few and well-known. Bolad's presence was soon reported by the police, with at least one source indicating that he was reported by the Mahdists.Prunier, p. 74 A force composed of regular army and a horse-mounted militia composed of Beni Halba Arabs quickly tracked and overwhelmed Bolad's force. The military governor of Darfur who directed the force was Tayeb Ibrahim 'Sikha', Bolad's old bodyguard and now both a physician and army colonel. There is no record of their meeting. The Beni Halba district town of Idd al Ghanam (\\"Well of Goats\\") was renamed Idd al Fursan (\\"Well of Horsemen\\") in celebration of the victory and dozens of Fur villages who had not taken part in defeating Bolad were burned in reprisal.Flint and de Waal, p. 25  His Death  Bolad was captured alive and taken to Khartoum, where he was tortured to death in January 1992. Even worse, he was captured with his diary in which he had recorded every member of the underground resistance cells he had set up in Darfur. Many of these plotters disappeared into jails or disappeared entirely. Others were released after renouncing rebellion, though in the knowledge that they would continue to be watched by security forces. One history sums up the result, \\"The Darfurian resistance was set back by ten years.\\" Darfurian dissidents drew a harsh lesson from this, becoming even more distrustful of the SPLA. With the failure of Bolad's insurrection and the coming to power of Idriss D√©by in Chad, and resulting lowering of Libyan involvement in the region, much of Darfur subsided into a state of generalized insecurity that never reached the status of actual peace. The Black Book, a 2000 publication by Darfuri dissidents, lists Bolad as a \\"martyr\\".Flint and de Waal, p. 26  Notes and references  Category:Year of birth missing Category:1992 deaths Category:Sudanese politicians Category:People from Darfur Category:Second Sudanese Civil War Category:Executed Sudanese people ","title":"Daud Bolad"},{"id":"7130039","text":"LaMarcus Darnell Coker (born June 26, 1986) is a former football running back who played for the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League.

He is best known as the co-founder, with Samuel Z. Arkoff, of American International Pictures.  Early life Nicholson was born on September 14, 1916 in Seattle, Washington. As a child, he developed a love of movies, especially fantasy and science fiction films. While at San Francisco Polytechnic High School, he joined a science fiction fan club, where he met Forrest J Ackerman. The two produced a fantasy fanzine together. Years later, Ackerman's magazine Famous Monsters of Filmland would heavily promote AIP's films.  Career  Nicholson's first work in the film industry was as an usher at the El Rey Theatre in San Francisco when he was 16. He became a projectionist the following year and two years later bought his first theater. He was the manager of two theaters in Omaha, Nebraska. The chain that owned the theaters soon went out business and Nicholson found himself unemployed. He drifted through a series of short-lived jobs, and ended up running four revival movie theaters in Los Angeles with Joseph Moritz in 1944. He introduced new ways of attracting customers, including showing the 1949 Rose Bowl. Nicholson was eventually hired by Jack Broder at Realart Pictures in their advertising department; his job was to devise new campaigns for the old movies that Realart re-released, which often included retitling the films. A threat of a lawsuit from Alex Gordon, regarding a title similarity between one of Realart's reissues and a screenplay Gordon had written with Ed Wood with exactly the same title, led to Nicholson meeting Samuel Z. Arkoff, who was at that time Gordon's lawyer. Nicholson and Arkoff became friends and eventually decided to form American Releasing Corporation, a film distribution company, in 1954, in association with Moritz. Two years later they founded American International Pictures to make independent films for their circuit, with Nicholson as president. Nicholson was known as the creative member of the partnership. His movie sense, combined with Arkoff's business savvy, led to AIP's long string of successful films aimed squarely at teenaged audiences. From 1954 to 1980, AIP released over 125 films, most of them released directly to drive-ins and grindhouses. Nicholson would often think up an exploitable title, and devise an entire advertising campaign complete with poster art, even before a script had been drafted. The films were mostly completed on low budgets, with shooting done in two or three weeks (and sometimes only a few days) on rented stages at the Chaplin Studio, and nearly all of them turned profits. Nicholson and Arkoff were named Producers of the Year in 1963 by the Allied States Association of Motion Picture Owners and in 1964 were named by the Theatre Owners of America as Master Showmen of the Decade. Independent producer In 1972, Nicholson left AIP to make independent productions under his Academy Pictures Corp. with a distribution deal with AIP however, he later severed ties with AIP by signing a distribution deal with 20th Century Fox. According to his then-wife, Susan Hart, he was going to make five films: *The Legend of Hell House *Black Father *Street People *The B People *Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry. Nicholson's death meant only the first and last of these were made. Personal life Nicholson was married twice. He had three daughters (Luree Holmes, Laura Nicholson, Loretta Nicholson) with his first wife, Sylvia, and a son, Jimmy, with actress Susan Hart. His granddaughter from Laura was film producer Jill Messick.  Death  Nicholson was diagnosed with a brain tumor during 1972 and received cobalt therapy but relapsed and died in the aftermath of surgery aged 56. He is buried in Inglewood Park Cemetery. AIP continued for several more years before Arkoff, having lost interest in the movie business, allowed himself to be bought out by Filmways for $4.3 million.

He was born into a musical family in which his father played the tuba and his uncle played the banjo. As a mostly self-taught musician, he developed his facility on all of his instruments using unconventional techniques, which gave his playing an unmatched fluidity. At the age of 11 he began playing the clarinet and in years to come he picked up the alto and tenor saxophones as well as the flute. At the age of 20 he dropped his alto saxophone off to be repaired, and the only horn the shop had to loan him was the baritone sax. After that, the baritone sax became his main, but not only instrument. While studying education at Ithaca College in New York, Brignola and some of his fellow students made a recording, which won a Down Beat Magazine award for the best college group of the year. The award afforded the group of young musicians many opportunities including the recording of an album as well as performance at various festivals, and a performance at the Caf√© Bohemia in Greenwich Village. In the Down Beat critics poll he was labeled a ‚Äúnew star.‚Äù The newfound fame landed him with the Benny Goodman Scholarship to the prestigious Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts. During his time at Berklee he did a recording with legendary professor and musician Herb Pomeroy and forged relationships with lifelong musical friends including Dick Berk. Nick did not have a long stay at Berklee though. His popularity launched him into the music scene and lead him to gig with many well established musicians. In the 1960s Nick toured with trumpeter Ted Curson, which gave him his initial international exposure. Nick and Ted remained friends for the rest of Nick's life. They reunited in the mid 1970s and played several gigs at the Tin Palace in New York City where the group recorded their only album. Also, in the mid 1970s, Nick heard a group called Petrus at the Last Chance Saloon in Albany, N.Y. It was led by pianist Phil Markowitz with Gordon Johnson on bass, and Ted Moore on drums. The trio began at the Eastman School of music in Rochester, NY. They were a fusion oriented group greatly influenced by Chick Corea. Nick joined the group, which became known as Nick Brignola and Petrus and while they never recorded, found a great deal of both popular and critical acclaim for their work together. During this time, Nick also played at the regular Sunday evening sessions that were held at the Ramada Inn in Schenectady. It was there that he got to play with many of his favorite musicians such as Cecil Payne, Woody Shaw, Jon Faddis, Chet Baker and Bill Watrous. His connection with Watrous was especially fortuitous and they maintained contact for many years. He also played with dixieland/swing trumpet player Doc Cheatham and the two became a mutual admiration society. There are several bootleg recordings of Nick's performances available on the internet. Another highlight in Nick's career was the Many Styles of Nick Brignola series, which had Nick playing three distinctly different styles of jazz. The first set was a swing/dixie with such stars as Doc Cheatham, Jimmy McPartland and Helen Humes. The second set was dedicated to bebop, with Chet Baker, Thad Jones and Jack Wilkins. His final set was with Petrus - his working group at the time, where they played both fusion and avant garde jazz. Two such performances were held at the Cohoes Music Hall in Cohoes, NY and the final one at Page Hall in Albany, N.Y. Though Nick was mostly known as a bandleader, he performed and released albums with many famous and well-established musicians. He recorded the album Baritone Madness with one of his idols, bebop heavyweight Pepper Adams. He released several tribute albums with an equally stunning cast of musicians paying respect to Gerry Mulligan and Lee Morgan. He played an integral role in the three-baritone sax band, which also played tribute to Gerry Mulligan. He recorded two incredible sets at the Sweet-Basil Lounge in New York city with Randy Brecker and Claudio Roditi, and played alongside fellow baritone sax player Ronnie Cuber on the album Baritone Explosion with Rein DeGraff.

It was the first iteration of the first generation of the Holden Commodore. The car was officially launched on 26 October 1978 with showrooms receiving the first examples on 13 November 1978. Production of the VB only lasted seventeen months, the shortest reign of any Commodore. The VB Commodore was effectively the successor of the Holden HZ, although most models in that series continued to be produced until the introduction of the facelifted VC Commodore on 30 March 1980. 95,906 units of the VB Commodore were manufactured during the car's lifespan, and during 1979 the VB became Australia's number one selling car. Also in 1979, the VB won Wheels Car of the Year award, with the car being praised in the media for its value for money and engineering sophistication.  Design  The VB Commodore was loosely based on the 1977 Opel Rekord E bodyshell but with the front grafted on from the Opel Senator to accommodate the larger Holden six- cylinder and V8 engines, giving it a similar appearance to the Opel Commodore, the Vauxhall Viceroy, sold in the UK and the Chevrolet Commodore, sold in South Africa. Overall, the body was strengthened substantially to withstand the harsh conditions of the Australian outback. Total cost of development is reported to be over A$110 million. The Commodore represented a major shift in thinking for Holden since it was significantly smaller than the previous full- size family car, the Holden Kingswood, but visually similar in size to the mid-size Torana / Sunbird sedans. It essentially came about in response to the 1973 oil crisis and the need to produce more fuel-efficient cars. Holden, hedging their bets, initially built the Commodore alongside the other two established body styles, until the Torana was dropped in mid-1979, with only the Sunbird surviving into mid-1980 following release of the updated VC Commodore. The VB was available in three specification levels: Commodore, Commodore SL, and Commodore SL/E. A station wagon variant ‚Äì not available in SL/E form ‚Äì was released on 24 July 1979, hitting showrooms on 6 August 1979. It featured a large cargo area and an easy access one-piece lift-up tailgate. As the wagon-specific sheet metal had to be imported from Germany (from the Rekord), the wagon suffered from inevitable component differences from the sedan, confirmed by the separate keys for the ignition system and rear door.Bebbington (2009), p. 77. \\"[W]agon models joined the line-up in July 1979 [...] The sheetmetal unique to the wagon body style was imported from Germany\\". The OHV engines were largely carried over from the Kingswood: a 2.85-litre 64-kilowatt (86 hp) straight-six, 3.3-litre 71-kilowatt (96 hp) straight-six, 4.2-litre 87-kilowatt (117 hp) V8, which was also available with dual exhausts to produce 96 kilowatts (129 hp) of power, and a 5.0-litre 114-kilowatt (153 hp) V8, which in dual exhaust form was rated at 125 kilowatts (168 hp). The engine blocks on these motors were painted red and are therefore commonly referred to as the Red motors. The VB was also available with either a four-speed manual transmission or a three-speed Trimatic automatic transmission, or the Turbo-Hydramatic 350/400 automatic transmission with the 5.0-litre V8.  Specification levels  Holden Commodore 3.3 sedan Holden Commodore SL station wagon :All V8's came with power steering. On the station wagon, there was no 15x6 inch alloy wheels option.

In 1979 the factory backed Holden Dealer Team entered a three-car VB Commodore team in the Repco Round Australia Trial which started and finished at the Royal Melbourne Showgrounds and travelled clockwise around the country over some of the most inhospitable terrain imaginable. The team Commodore's were powered by the 3.3-litre straight-six Holden Red motor rather than the more powerful V8 due to their much lighter weight. Anxious to prove the then new cars reliability, the cars were perfectly prepared and finished first, second and third. Lead HDT driver Peter Brock won the event along with co- drivers Matt Phillip and Noel Richards. Brock has cited this event as his career highlight as it was an event in which many motor racing experts throughout Australia, as well as the media, did not believe he would do well in despite his previous rally and rallycross exploits. With new regulations for Group C Touring car racing introduced by the Confederation of Australian Motor Sport in 1980 which forced teams to use low emission engines, the HDT (by now owned by Brock and with actual support from Holden dealers after Holden had pulled out of racing at the end of 1979) had been secretly testing a VB Commodore as its replacement for the A9X Torana. The new regulations saw that the Holden's racing 5.0-litre V8 engine had a drop in power from 1979's to approximately . However, the new regulations also saw to it that the HDT had arguably the only race ready car for the 1980 Australian Touring Car Championship. Peter Brock won the championship in his VB Commodore, winning four of the eight rounds while claiming pole position at each and every round. 1979 ATCC winner Bob Morris also won a round of the championship driving his Craven Mild Racing VB Commodore. Brock then won the 1980 CRC 300 at Sydney's Amaroo Park circuit before upgrading to the VC Commodore by the Hang Ten 400 at Sandown Raceway. The VB's final placing in an Australian touring car race was a strong third place by Ian \\"Pete\\" Geoghegan and Paul Gulson at the 1980 Hardie-Ferodo 1000 at Bathurst (Brock and Jim Richards won their third straight Bathurst 1000 in their VC Commodore). The VB is only one of two Commodore models (along with the VN) not to have won the Bathurst 1000.  References  *  External links  * Holden VB Commodore crash test.

It was the second iteration of the first generation of the Holden Commodore.  Overview  The VC Commodore was launched on 30 March 1980 and is primarily distinguished by its \\"eggcrate\\" style grille. This series brought many improvements over the VB Commodore and maintained the Commodore's place as the best selling car in Australia. It was replaced by the VH series in October 1981. Commodore SL 3.3 sedan Commodore L wagon The improvements included revised suspension to improve ride and handling, a few cosmetic changes and the availability of new options such as cruise control. However, one of the biggest changes were a series of engine upgrades which included redesigned cylinder heads, now with a single intake and exhaust port for every cylinder, improved intake/exhaust manifolds, new camshafts and pistons and an all-new carburettor called the Rochester Varajet, as well as the fitment of electronic ignition. In total, these upgrades brought up to 25 percent more power and 15 percent better fuel efficiency. The engine block on these motors were painted a blue colour (as opposed to the previous red) and were commonly referred to as the Blue motor. As well as changes to the existing engines, a new 1.9-litre inline-four engine was introduced. Known as the Starfire four, the new engine was the 2.85-litre blue inline-six engine with two cylinders removed. Also used in the UC Sunbird, this engine was fitted to the Commodore in response to increasing pressure from the 1979 energy crisis. This new engine was not a complete success however, as its lack of power meant the engine needed to be pushed hard to deliver acceptable performance, negating any fuel saving benefits. The engines used in this generation were Holden's own, and were not shared with the equivalent Opel Rekord or Vauxhall Carlton. A new specification level was added to the range: the L, to replace the unbadged base model. The mid-range SL and SL/E flagship trim levels from the VB continued on. Transmission choices remained the same as the VB Commodore. A total of 121,807 VC Commodores were produced. With the discontinuation of the Holden HZ models in 1980, the Commodore was complemented by a range of Holden WB commercial vehicles and the Statesman WB luxury models. All of these also utilised the \\"Blue\\" motors.  HDT Commodore  In late 1979, Holden pulled out of touring car racing after two years of domination by the LX Torana A9X SS hatchback. In 1980, this led to Peter Brock buying the Holden Dealer Team (HDT), though without Holden funding was needed to continue racing and development. This led to the creation of a modified VC Commodore, tuned and styled under the direction of Peter Brock who established HDT Special Vehicles, not only to produce enhanced versions of the Commodore but as a way of funding the race team. The result was a luxury-performance version of the VC Commodore, to be sold through select Holden dealers throughout Australia as the HDT Commodore. The HDT Commodore was powered by an HDT tuned 5.0-litre V8 engine, producing at 4500 rpm. The HDT Commodore was a limited edition vehicle, with exactly 500 production models produced. These only sold with a choice of three colours (Palais White, Firethorn Red or Tuxedo Black) to pay homage to Marlboro, HDT's main sponsor at the time. 1980-81 VC Commodore SLE-.JPG Commodore SL/E sedan 1980 HDT Commodore (VC) sedan 01.jpg HDT Commodore exterior 1980 HDT Commodore (VC) sedan 03.jpg HDT Commodore interior  References   External links  * VC Category:Cars introduced in 1980 Category:Cars of Australia Category:Mid-size cars Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles Category:Sedans Category:Station wagons ","title":"Holden Commodore (VC)"},{"id":"7130213","text":"Junub () is an Islamic term meaning ritually impure due to sexual intercourse or seminal discharge.

FKBPs have been identified in many eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans, and function as protein folding chaperones for proteins containing proline residues. Along with cyclophilin, FKBPs belong to the immunophilin family. FKBP12 is notable in humans for binding the immunosuppressant molecule tacrolimus (originally designated FK506), which is used in treating patients after organ transplant and patients suffering from autoimmune disorders. Tacrolimus has been found to reduce episodes of organ rejection over a related treatment, the drug ciclosporin, which binds cyclophilin. Both the FKBP- tacrolimus complex and the cyclosporin-cyclophilin complex inhibit a phosphatase called calcineurin, thus blocking signal transduction in the T-lymphocyte transduction pathway. This therapeutic role is not related to prolyl isomerase activity.  Use as a biological research tool  FKBP (FKBP1A) does not normally form a dimer but will dimerize in the presence of FK1012, a derivative of the drug tacrolimus (FK506). This has made it a useful tool for chemically induced dimerization applications where it can be used to manipulate protein localization, signalling pathways and protein activation.

Born in Hanna, Alberta and raised in an orphanage in Victoria, British Columbia, Jenkins served in the Royal Canadian Air Force from the age of 17. He would be posted in Germany and in Canada to do various military jobs. He eventually left the military to work with Sunoco. That wouldn't last, and Jenkins convinced the curling club in Trenton, Ontario to take him on as ice maker. He wanted to be an ice maker after noting how terrible the ice was at the 1974 provincial championships he was competing in. One trend Shorty started in curling was that of timing rocks. He used his idea to judge how good the ice was. Jenkins claimed he was the only person who could \\"choose and match rocks for major championships\\". He refused to do the ice of a tournament without choosing the rocks for it. Jenkins kept video tapes of the tournaments he had done to see what the television announcers were saying about his ice. In the late 1990s Jenkins starred in his own commercial for the Tim Hortons donut chain, celebrating \\"true Tim Hortons stories\\".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDrjQ3sQ0bk Presently, the Shorty Jenkins Classic curling bonspiel is held in his name.

History Kee Wah Bakery was founded by Mr. Wong Yip Wing in 1938 as a small grocery store in a corner of Shanghai Street. A few years later World War II began and the store was forced to closed. At that time one of the employees used some simple tools and an old oil barrel as an improvised oven, and began baking pastries to sell to the boat dwellers on the harbor. This marked the beginning of Kee Wah Bakery. Since then, Kee Wah has become one of Hong Kong‚Äôs oldest bakeries, and has made its name in Chinese Wedding Cakes and Mooncakes. In 1997 the baton of the business were passed to the second generation; Mr Kevin S Wong revamped the company‚Äôs branding and product packaging by engaging renowned graphic designer Mr Suen Siu Wah to overhaul the corporate identity, product packaging, outlet interiors and staff uniforms. Headquarter is located at Kee Wah Industrial Building, 666 Castle Peak Road, Cheung Sha Wan, with production lines; There is also a production centre in Taipo Industrial Estate which started in 2009. Hong Kong actor Eric Tsang is the endorser for Kee Wah Mooncake and Kee Gift Series. Taiwanese actress Annie Liu is the endorser for Kee Wah Chinese Bridal Cakes. The Kee Wah Bakery in California was established in 1985 and continues to produce freshly baked goods daily. Many well known favorites are the egg tarts and the pineapple buns. Collaboration In 2008, Hong Kong lifestyle retail store G.O.D. collaborated with Kee Wah Bakery to design mooncakes for the Chinese Mid-Autumn Festival. G.O.D. came up with presenting the traditional treats in the shape of bottoms in eight different designs, but still filled with traditional white lotus seed paste and salted yolks. In 2012, Kee Wah opened its first nostalgia-themed store in Hong Kong in Ocean Park‚Äôs ‚ÄúOld Hong Kong‚Äù attraction. Based on Kee Wah‚Äôs flagship store in Shanghai during the 40s, the d√©cor and ambience of the store aims to offer visitors a chance to reminiscence the past while tasting fresh baked traditional pastries and snacks. A series of co-branded products are launched which are available for sale not only inside the Park but also in other Kee Wah outlets in Hong Kong.

It also has the distinction of being the first album released as part of the Neil Young Archives series of archival recordings. Overview In February and March 1970, Young and Crazy Horse went on tour to support Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere (1969). Live at the Fillmore East features performances from the tour. The tour was the last Neil Young and Crazy Horse tour to feature Whitten. Young played four shows at the Fillmore East on March 6 and 7, each show consisting of a solo acoustic set and an electric set with Crazy Horse. This release contains each song performed during the electric set, minus \\"Cinnamon Girl\\" (which was eventually released as a BD-Live download as part of The Archives Vol. 1 1963‚Äì1972 box set). It was released on CD and DVD. The DVD features pictures from the show, pictures of the original handwritten lyrics and reviews from the era, as well as improved sound (24bit/96 kHz PCM audio) over the CD release. The album is the first live release featuring Danny Whitten, who died in 1972. It also features Jack Nitzsche as an official member of the band, as indicated by Young in the band introductions; this four-man line-up of Crazy Horse backed Young for a short American tour in February and March 1970. A performance of Whitten's \\"Come On Baby Let's Go Downtown\\" from the same shows was previously released on Young's 1975 album Tonight's the Night, which explores Young's grief at the loss of friends to drugs. A studio version of this song appears on the album Crazy Horse. While the song is credited to Young and Whitten both on that album and on Tonight's the Night, here \\"Downtown\\" is credited to Whitten alone. (At the very end of the final track, \\"Cowgirl in the Sand\\", one can hear the studio version of James Taylor's \\"Sweet Baby James\\" being played.) The release features two other songs from the era that wouldn't see the light of day until years after the concert. \\"Winterlong\\" was first released on the 1977 compilation Decade and \\"Wonderin'\\" would feature on the 1983 rockabilly album Everybody's Rockin', complete with doo-wop backing vocals. It is the first release related to the Neil Young Archives|Archives series, but labeled the second. (However, two earlier concerts have since been released, Sugar Mountain - Live at Canterbury House 1968 which was released on November 25, 2008 and Live at the Riverboat 1969, from a 1969 Young residency at the Toronto coffee house of the same name, which was released on June 2, 2009.)Jonathan Cohen, \\"Neil Young Opens Archives For Fillmore CD/DVD\\" 22 September 2006.

Last accessed 4 November 2006. Later, another installment, Live at Massey Hall 1971 was released and fared better on the charts. The release date of the first of the box sets Young discussed, The Archives Vol. 1 1963-1972, was announced in March 2007 Warner Bros. + Reprise Records for release in September or October of that year. Soon after those months passed without the box set, a new release date was announced - February 2008 - which also passed without further Archive releases. Finally on June 2, 2009 the Archives were released with Live at Fillmore East comprising disc 5 of the 8-disc CD release. The album debuted on the Billboard 200 album chart at number 55 on December 2, 2006, with sales of 20,000 copies. It spent three weeks on the chart. There is also a 200-gram vinyl LP pressing by Classic Records. Though originally planned to include a bonus performance of \\"Cinnamon Girl\\" as a bonus track, the final product has the same track listing as the CD and DVD. \\"Cinnamon Girl\\" is separately available online. The support act for this performance was Miles Davis performing with an electric sextet.

A disjunct population exists in northwestern Peru, while the main distribution is from extreme southeastern Brazil to Patagonia and central Chile. The population from southern Chile is considered a separate subspecies, P. m. navasi. Taxonomy The great grebe was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1781 in his Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by Fran√ßois-Nicolas Martinet in the Planches Enlumin√©es D'Histoire Naturelle which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name Colymbus major in his catalogue of the Planches Enlumin√©es. Buffon mistakenly believed that his specimen had come from Cayenne in French Guiana. The great grebe is now placed in the genus Podiceps that was erected by the English naturalist John Latham in 1787. Two subspecies are recognised: *P. m. major, (Boddaert, 1783), West Peru, Paraguay, southeastern Brazil, Uruguay to central Chile & southern Argentina *P. m. navasi, (Manghi, 1984), Southern Chile Habitat This species occurs mainly in open waterways. Most birds are seen on low altitude lakes and sluggish rivers (often surrounded by forests), as well as estuarine marshes. While breeding, it frequents the heavily vegetated inlets off of large lakes. Outside of the breeding season, most birds will move to estuaries and bays, usually heavy with kelp (occasionally, they even are seen on the open sea). Non-breeding birds may live along the coasts all year. These birds are widespread and common through most of their range. Much of their native habitat has not been cleared, especially in the southern portions of their range. In Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil Description This is a very large grebe, with proportions more like a goose or a cormorant then a typical grebe. They range in length from 67‚Äì80 cm (26-32 inches) and usually weigh about 1600 grams (3.5 lb), but can scale to at least 2 kg (4.4 lb). They are buffy-rufous on the neck and chest, blackish on the back and have a whitish belly. The head is sooty gray with a reddish-brown eye. Due to its size and unique coloration, the great grebe is unlikely to be confused with any other bird, including other grebes. Diet The great grebe lives on a diet mostly of fish, sometimes over 11 cm (4.3 inches) long, but usually smaller. Prey competition can occasionally occur with the neotropic cormorant over fish, but that species (in spite of smaller body size) usually takes larger fish. Also insects, crustaceans and mollusks are taken. The diet can switch to almost half crabs during the wintertime along the coasts, and these birds can also take the young of other waterbirds, especially coots. Breeding After living in groups numbering up to the hundreds, these birds move inland to breed. Most populations lay their eggs from October to January, becoming later further south. In the isolated Peru population, nesting occurs in September & October, with a possible second clutch in January or February. They are moderately social when breeding, occasionally forming colonies. Three to five eggs (sometimes six) are laid. Two broods, or possibly more, can be raised at the same time. References *del Hoyo, Elliott & Sargatal.

Kinsarvik Municipality existed as a municipality off and on from 1838 until 1964 when it was merged into Ullensvang. This village was the administrative centre of Ullensvang until 2020 when the municipality was enlarged and the administrative centre was moved to the town of Odda. Geography Kinsarvik sits at the end of the Husedalen valley. The wild Kinso river runs through the village, and the rivers is what gives name to Kinsarvik. Its name stems from \\"kinn\\" which means \\"steep mountainside\\" (the valley has steep mountainsides) and so \\"Kinsarvik\\" simply means \\"The Bay of Kinso\\". The Kinso River drops from the vast Hardangervidda plateau through the Husedalen valley before emptying into the sea level fjord at Kinsarvik. Along the way there are 4 spectacular waterfalls. The waterfalls can be viewed over the course of 4‚Äì6 hours of hiking. Kinsarvik is also a major access point many longer treks into the Hardangervidda National Park.

The factory employs about 50 people. Tourism Summer Midnight at Kinsarvik The history of Kinsarvik tourism has been one of dramatic changes. Up until the 1970s, the village was the busiest ferry port in Norway and a crucial junction on the only all-year road connecting the main cities of Bergen and Oslo. More recently, however, alternative routes have eroded its importance a little, but in 2006 the Norwegian Parliament approved the Hardanger Bridge, a monumental bridge located only north of Kinsarvik. The bridge was completed in 2013 and since then Kinsarvik is no longer part of the dominant route and tourist stop for both east-west and north-south traffic. Kinsarvik functions as a base camp for tourists visiting the surrounding areas and has several camping grounds and a hotel. Kinsarvik B√•thavn is a small marina located in the village.. The shores of the fjords in this area are thick with fruit trees, primarily cherry and apple trees. There are spikes in tourism for the flowering and harvest of these trees.  History   Vikings  In the time of Julius Caesar, a clan known as Charudes was reported to live in the Jutland region of Denmark. The people were reported to be involved in many battles and thereby had a tradition of warfare. About the time of the fall of Rome and the arrival of the Huns, there was a great movement of people in Europe. The Charudes were squeezed between the Angles, Saxons, and the Jutes. It has been theorised that the clan, which was by now referred to as Horder or Harding left Denmark and settled in Scotland, Iceland, and the area around what is now Kinsarvik, setting up an independent kingship. The county of Vestland and the region of Hardanger are thought to be named for this people. The shores of the Hardangerfjord are steep and rocky. The gradual earthen banks at the mouth of the Kinso River were an important place for the building and repair of the Longship. Any attack on Kinsarvik would have to be made by ship. The area was backed by the glaciers of the Hardangervidda and on the east any land force would have to go around the long, narrow, and deep waters of the S√∏rfjord or Eid Fjord. It was an ideal defensive position for Vikings.  Christianity  Kinsarvik-style bunad (traditional dress) Christianity arrived in the 11th century, and the wooden Kinsarvik Church was built at Kinsarvik, which was an important economic centre in the region of inner Hardanger. In 1160, a stone church was erected in its place. That building is still standing, making it one of the oldest stone churches in Norway. Christianity also brought English settlers with Apple rootstock. The English also brought the art of grafting to the fruit industry of Hardanger about 1300. The area around Kinsarvik is well suited for growing fruit and its practice expanded. In the Middle Ages, Kinsarvik Church was the site of a market, the legal magistrates, as well as a religious center for the region. In the winters, the ship masts and sails for the boats in the area were stored in the church attic. By 1536, the Protestant Reformation was underway. The first church in Norway to convert was Ullensvang Church just about south of Kinsarvik. At this time the Catholic paintings and frescos of Kinsarvik Church were whitewashed. In the 17th century, the woodwork of the church was painted. In 1961, the original frescos were uncovered and the church was restored to its Catholic appearance including a fresco of the Archangel Gabriel weighing souls.  S√°mi  Archaeological studies have shown that reindeer and the hunting of reindeer on the Hardangervidda was well established in the iron (Viking) age and Middle Ages. However, the current reindeer herds on the Hardangervidda plateau do not originate from the old Reindeer population which occupied all the high plateaus in pre-historian times, but the present herd is a result of early 1900 initiatives with reindeer herding on the Hardangervidda. For this both reindeer and sami (herders) were brought to the area. The reindeer herding on the Hardangervidda did not succeed and the reindeers either escaped or were let loose. Some of the Sami herders settled down in Kinsarvik, but more so in Eidfjord, the municipality to the north of Kinsarvik.

It is located between 77th and 78th Streets, on the north side of 34th Avenue. More than half of the park is occupied by an asphalt play area, with basketball and tennis courts. A children's playground with leaf- and-vine shaped spray shower occupies about one third of the park. There are also restroom facilities, handball courts, a small picnic area and a bicycle rack. In 2012, a segment of adjacent 78th Street was transformed in a permanent Street Plaza and the sports area of a nearby school was bought by New York City and added to the park. Although Travers Park is surrounded by trees, it does not have a lawn or any significant green space. Travers Park is a heavily used park. It is located in City Council District 25, which ranks 50th out of 51 Council Districts in the city in terms of park space, according to the nonprofit group New Yorkers for Parks; the only Council district in the city with less park space is on Manhattan's Upper East Side, near Central Park.  History  In April 1948 the City of New York acquired land for Travers Park by condemnation. The park was named in honor of Jackson Heights community leader Thomas J. Travers, and dedicated on July 26, 1949. The park underwent a major renovation in the mid-1990s, vastly improving what had been a badly neglected playground. A series of green planting areas were created through the northern half of the park that still flourish today. Many of the shrubs, perennials and fencing protecting them are the work of Friends of Travers Park, which continues to maintain the plantings and provides community input to the New York City Parks Department. A movement to expand the park started in 2007. Related to this effort was the closing of neighboring 78th Street traffic from July to November in 2008 and 2009. The street functioned as a play street. The play street project was a joint effort by several organizations, including the Friends of Travers Park, JH Green Alliance, and the Western Jackson Heights Alliance. The intention was to seek the closing of the street in 2009 to coincide with the presence of Green Market. In 2010, after organizing a march to Queens Community Board 3 to request their support,http://www.streetsblog.org/2010/05/24/jackson-heights-neighbors-band- together-to-win-car-free-street-expansion/ the organizing groups were granted permission to close 78th Street to traffic for the entire months of July and August.http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2010/05/24/2010-05-24_new_park_for_summer.html In August 2012 a section of 78th Street adjacent to the park was permanently closed to traffic and transformed into a pedestrian plaza, effectively adding a 10,000-square-foot area to Travers Park. This plaza is managed by the Jackson Heights Green Alliance who are responsible for the maintenance and overseeing the events that take place on the plaza. In February 2013, NYC Parks and the NYC Department of Citywide Administrative Services completed the acquisition of a 24,600-square-foot asphalt play yard formerly owned by the Garden School at 33-16 79th Street, and added the land to Travers Park.http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/traverspark/pressrelease/21107 That year, the children's playground was renovated again. The playground became fully Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)-compliant and is appropriate for children aged 5 to 10 years old.http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/traverspark/ As of March 2018, Travers Park and Staunton Play Field is being renovated and expected to reopen in late 2019. A large portion of the park reopened in February 2019. The tot lot at Travers Park is set to be rebuilt by late 2020. During this renovation, there was a controversy about the opening of a Mazda car dealership next to the park. Original plans had called for the entirety of 78th Street next to the park to be turned into a car-free zone, but a 200-foot section remained to provide access to Koeppel Mazda, which opened in 2018.

Activities  The Jackson Heights Greenmarket, a farmer's market, opens on Sundays year-round in the park.http://www.grownyc.org/greenmarket-site/queens/jackson-heights- greenmarket Since 2004, Travers Park has been home to Summer Sundays in the Park, a performance series that features a wide range of music, both in style and ethnicity. The series includes a musical produced by Theater for the New City, and a show by the Swedish Cottage Marionettes, based in Central Park. The series is sponsored by the Jackson Heights Beautification Group, its committee, Friends of Travers Park, and beginning in 2008, the Queens Community House. It will be funded in 2009 largely through grants from the Queens Council on the Arts, which had provided funding for several of the earlier editions. On a sunny spring or summer day it's not unusual to see multiple activities occurring in Travers Park or Rory Staunton Field, such as bicycle riding, cricket, baseball, softball, soccer, tennis, and basketball. There is also a handball and a full-court basketball court. There is a place for toddlers, a section for a few waterworks and tables for checkers or chess.

It is located in the northeastern part of the city, namely the Vrapƒçiƒái suburb, and is principal stadium and the home- ground of FK Vele≈æ Mostar football club. The stadium takes its name from FK Vele≈æ's and its supporters' nickname \\"Roƒëeni\\" (, as in \\"our own\\"; literally \\"born\\"), and it was decided after an online poll. History Bijeli Brijeg Stadium construction 1947‚Äì1958 The first attempt to build a stadium happened at the beginning of 1938. FK Vele≈æ management decided to call a loan among the club's supporters and friends, and all Mostar's working class, whose money would be used to buy land and build a playground. A non-interest-bearing loan, with a two-year repayment period after the construction of the playground, was proposed, and coupons called \\"Loan\\" were issued in denominations of 50 and 100 dinars. In this way, 100,000 dinars were collected. When an agreement was reached on the purchase of land, the club was banned by the regime on 3 September 1940, and the money collected was than directed to humanitarian cause \\"Red Assistance\\". After the World War II stadium Pod Bijelim Brijegom was built through volunteer labor of young people from Mostar and Bosnia and Herzegovina, between 1947 and 1958. The club currently plays at the Roƒëeni Stadium, but its historic stadium is the Bijeli Brijeg Stadium. From time the Bosnian War broke out, and in particular subsequent incitement of Croat- Bosniak hostilities, conflicting ideologies and interests were conveyed from the war times into the post-war era, which continuously manifesting itself through steady political divisiveness in the city of Mostar, among other shown in issues of territorial and ownership disputes. Such political ambiance showed in the forced eviction of FK Vele≈æ Mostar from its traditional home- ground of Bijeli Brijeg, and in subsequent legal disputes over stadium usurpation by another club, emerging in the city at the time. Bijeli Brijeg was a stadium used by FK Vele≈æ Mostar from the time it was built until 1992, through the club's glory days, when they emerged triumphant from their campaigns in the 1980‚Äì81 and 1985‚Äì86 Yugoslav Cups competition, and before that when the club also reached the quarter-final stage of the 1974‚Äì75 UEFA Cup.  New location, new facilities  Roƒëeni Stadium, then known as Vrapƒçiƒái Stadium in 2010 The new location of the club's new stadium facilities is in the northeastern part of the city, namely the Vrapƒçiƒái suburb. It is the principal stadium and the home-ground of FK Vele≈æ Mostar, and at present stage of development, it can receive up to 7,000 supporters in attendance. The lack of funds and a slow process of country's recovery from the war, as well as complicated political ambient in the city and the country as a whole, all influenced the scope and the tempo of stadium development. Vele≈æ returned to the top flight of Bosnia and Herzegovina football after being promoted in 2006. This return was accompanied with a construction of large northern and smaller eastern stand. In 2012, the eastern stand was renamed the Red Army Tribina (Red Army Stand) after Red Army Mostar, Vele≈æ's supporter group. In 2008, a large western stand was built, which was followed with additional works and expansions between 2017 and 2018. In 2019 a roof for the western stand was finished. While hosting a fundraiser for the club, the president of Vele≈æ, ≈†emsudin Hasiƒá announced that within three years (2022 will be Vele≈æ's 100 year anniversary) the stadium would be upgraded to the point it could be known as the \\"Roƒëeni Arena\\". One month later in December 2019, the eastern stand was demolished for a new stand to be built proportional to the northern stand, known by supporters as the Red Army.

He was twice British Champion Amateur Jump Jockey, before becoming a celebrated journalist and recognisable racing personality both on television and through his charitable work for the Injured Jockeys Fund, which he helped establish. He has been described as \\"quite possibly the outstanding racing figure of modern times, touching so many via his compelling writing, broadcasting, race-riding and tireless fund-raising\\". Early life Quadrangle at Eton College, Oaksey's alma mater He was the son of the noted jurist Geoffrey Lawrence, 1st Baron Oaksey, and his wife Marjorie, daughter of Commander Charles Robinson, RN. He preferred to be called Oaksey, although Trevethin is the longer- established title. In his broadcasting career, he was initially known as John Lawrence before adopting the name John Oaksey when he succeeded to the baronies on the death of his father in 1971. The Oaksey family seat is the parish of Oaksey in the extreme north of Wiltshire, between Malmesbury and Cirencester. He was educated at Eton College, where he was captain of the boxing team. At age 16 he spent the summer attending the Nuremberg trials at which his father was officiating, the family diaries and memoires of which are now on permanent loan to the NCCL Galleries of Justice in Nottingham. After Eton, he undertook National Service at Catterick and was commissioned as second lieutenant with the 9th Queen's Royal Lancers. He then went up to New College, Oxford, to read Philosophy, Politics and Economics. On graduating, he took law at Yale University and, at that point, looked destined to follow his father into the profession. Career Jockey Oaksey had learned to ride on an old pony called Mince Pie, which later gave rise to the title of his autobiography, Mince Pie For Starters A photo of him being ejected from Mince Pie during the 1935 Purton pony trials appeared on the front page of the Daily Express. He began competitive riding in point-to-points, starting with a ride on a horse called Paula at Siddington, Gloucestershire, in April 1950. He pulled up after six fences. He had his first winner the following year on board Next of Kin at the Pegasus Club meeting at Kimble, a meeting confined to lawyers and their families. When he started running under rules, his first win came on Pyrene in a hunter chase at Sandown Park on 16 March 1956. He also had his first major victory at the same track: Flaming East in the 1958 Imperial Cup. The horse with which he was most closely associated, though, was the staying chaser, Taxidermist. On this horse, he was second in the Kim Muir Chase at the Cheltenham Festival, beat stablemate Mandarin in the 1958 Whitbread Gold Cup and then in November of that year, produced the performance of his career in the Hennessy Gold Cup, then run at Cheltenham rather than Newbury. Passing four horses after the final fence, he got up to win on the line by a short head. Cheltenham Festival wins then followed ‚Äì on Bob Turnell's Sabaria in the 1959 National Hunt Chase, Jimmy Scot in the 1966 Kim Muir, Black Baize in the 1971 Kim Muir, and Bullocks Horn in the 1973 Foxhunters‚Äô Chase. In 1963, he went very close to winning the Grand National too. Riding Carrickbeg, he was beaten only by three-quarters of a length. In total, he rode in the Grand National eleven times, completing the course in four of them. Once in the race, he was unseated by his horse and knocked unconscious, but still insisted on filing his copy to the Sunday Telegraph before being taken away by stretcher. As his riding career entered its later years, he nearly won a second Whitbread Gold Cup in 1974 on board Proud Tarquin. He passed the post first, but was demoted to second after it was ruled he had interfered with The Dikler. He thought this immensely unfair, saying later, \\"The passing of time has done nothing to diminish my feeling that a great injustice was done\\". It was to be his last major race performance. He retired from racing after being injured in a fall at Folkestone in 1975. As a jockey, he rode as John Lawrence and won 200 races. Although the majority of these were over fences, 20 of his wins came on the flat, including the first three runnings of the Amateurs Derby at Epsom (1963‚Äì1965), and again in 1973. He had been Champion Amateur Jump Jockey in 1957‚Äì58 and 1970‚Äì71. Despite this, he was not noted as a particularly talented rider. He has been called \\"more effective than stylish in the saddle\\", or, in the words of fellow broadcaster Peter O'Sullevan, \\"He did not have any natural ability riding, it was pure application, but he did become most successful.\\" His connection with the Hennessy Gold Cup was revived in 2011, when Carruthers, a horse he bred and partially owned, won an emotional renewal of the race at a time when Oaksey himself was seriously ill. Broadcasting Oaksey began his broadcasting career while still active in the saddle. The BBC booked him four days before his Grand National ride on Carrickbeg to tour the site by helicopter and talk the audience through the fences. This was followed by his first regular television work which was with Pay-TV, a short-lived pay- as-you-view experiment set up by the boxing promoter Jarvis Astaire in 1965. For a time, they held the contract to broadcast from Kempton races. He joined ITV in 1969, and was regularly seen and heard on The ITV Seven and later Channel 4 Racing, where he was invariably referred to by John McCririck as \\"My Noble Lord\\". In the 1980s he also appeared on BBC Radio alongside Peter Bromley. Together they covered Bob Champion's famous win in the 1981 Grand National. Oaksey remarked afterwards: \\"If an imaginative novelist had dreamt up that result everybody would have called him a very silly imaginative novelist.\\" He retired from regular broadcasting at the end of 1999, though he still appeared occasionally for a while after that. Journalism In order to ride as an amateur jockey, rules required Oaksey to have another job. Therefore, he took up journalism as a career. He wrote for the Daily Telegraph, as the paper's racing correspondent \\"Marlborough\\" for over 30 years. He wrote for the Sunday Telegraph during the first 28 years of its existence and for a similar length of time he was the \\"Audax\\" columnist in Horse & Hound. His most celebrated piece of writing was his account of the 1963 Grand National he rode on Carrickbeg. This started life as a section of dialogue from his BBC preview and when that description was replicated by events on the day it was adapted for his newspaper column. The piece is most familiar within racing circles for its description of the closing stages: This has been described by fellow racing journalist, Brough Scott as \\"the greatest single piece of first-person big sporting event narrative in the English language\\". His commitment to his journalism was described thus by Peter Michell, the Telegraph's sports editor: \\"Oaksey would gallop for four miles, nip up Mount Kilamanjaro for a spot of exercise and then dictate a thousand words.\\" He is also noted for his account of Fred Winter's win in the 1962 Grand Steeplechase de Paris on Mandarin. Other works include a biography of Mill Reef and the script for a film called Something To Brighten The Morning. Injured Jockeys Fund His lasting legacy to the racing industry is the Injured Jockeys Fund (IJF). This started life as the Farrell-Brookshaw Fund, a charitable foundation started in 1964, after Oaksey's fellow jockeys, Tim Brookshaw and Paddy Farrell, broke their backs in falls at Liverpool. This later became the Injured National Hunt Jockeys‚Äô Fund, and ultimately, the Injured Jockeys Fund (IJF), embracing all areas of the sport. Oaksey became its president and figurehead. In 2004, he stated that the IJF had given him \\"more pride than any of the other activities in my racing life\\". In 2009, the IJF retirement complex in Lambourn was named Oaksey House in his honour. There is a statue of him in the grounds. Awards His work with the IJF led to his appointment as OBE in 1985. Other awards he received during his lifetime include Racing Journalist of the Year in 1968, the Daily Telegraph Order of Merit in 2003 and the Peter O'Sullevan Award for Services to Racing in 2008. He was elected honorary member of the Jockey Club in 2001. The 2013 running of the National Hunt Chase Challenge Cup at the Cheltenham Festival (a race he won in 1959) was named in his honour. In 2014, Sandown named a new 2 mile 6 furlong Listed Chase at their end of season finale, the Oaksey Chase, after him. Personal life In 1959 he married John Betjeman‚Äôs former secretary, Victoria (\\"Tory\\") Dennistoun, whose father John (\\"Ginger\\") Dennistoun was a racehorse trainer. The couple split in public fashion when Victoria started a relationship with artist Maggi Hambling. Oaksey married again, in 1988, to \\"Chicky\\" Crocker (n√©e Hunter), who had been married to a family friend. This provoked newspaper headlines and widespread disapproval from his circle as an uncharacteristic act of ungentlemanly behaviour.

He got his nickname \\"Oil can Eddie\\" because he often carried an oil can while walking around plants and talking with rank-and-file members. \\"Rank and File Insurgency in the Calumet Region during the 1970s\\", James B.

The following year Local 65 members elected him their president, and in 1964 at age 25 Sadlowski became the youngest person to hold that union office, overseeing about 23,000 workers. He won re- election in 1967.https://reuther.wayne.edu/files/LP000754.pdf  District 31 Director Election  In 1972 long time District 31 Director, Joe Germano, announced he was retiring. District 31 was the USWA's largest district, covering the Chicago, Illinois - Gary, Indiana area with about 128,000 members. Sadlowski announced he candidacy for the Director position: His opponent, Samuel C. Evett, had the support of the International Union, including its President I.W. Able. District 31 included 288 locals and Sadlowski needed nominations from 29 of them to get on the ballot. He conducted a street campaign at plant gates and coffeehouses, bars and restaurants.\\"Rank and File Insurgency in the Calumet Region during the 1970s\\", James B. Lane and Mike Olszanski, Steel Shavings, Indiana University Northwest, Volume 30, 2000. The International refused to give the Sadlowski campaign a list of the locals, but eventually Sadlowski secured nominations from 40 locals. The Evett forces claimed Sadlowski was supported by Communists and that he long opposed the Vietnam War.\\"Rank and File Insurgency in the Calumet Region during the 1970s\\", James B.

When votes starting coming in again, Evett was winning and was ultimately declared the winner by 2,000 votes. Sadlowski protested the election and sued the union. The U.S. Department of Labor investigated and found massive fraud, including that the official union leadership at the Gary Works U.S. Steel local (one of the district's biggest) had faked ballots. A federal court fight followed, which led Evett in July 1974 to agree to a new election. Meanwhile, Sadlowski's supporters had built an organization known as \\"Steelworkers Fightback\\".

United Steelworkers of America Presidential Race  After Sadlowski won the District Director election, he traveled around the country talking to steelworker groups about whether to run for International president. The International offered Sadlowski a deal. They would give him the staff he wanted in his district and would stay out of the district's political affairs. In return they wanted Sadlowski to stay out of International union politics. Sadlowski rejected the deal, commenting: Sadlowski became a candidate for president of the Steelworkers in 1977, running at the head of a reformist slate (Steelworkers Fightback).http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,918590,00.html \\"U.S.W.

The International denied Sadlowski access to all membership lists. Since the Steelworkers Union represents many jobs which are not steel related, Sadlowski sent union activists from Chicago around the country to help campaign at many of these locals. During the campaign Sadlowski gave a controversial interview with Penthouse magazine, in which he said he would not want his children to work in a steel mill: About 580,000 of the union's 1.4 million members voted. McBride won with 328,000 to Sadlowski's 249,000 votes, but Sadlowski beat McBride in the large steel locals.William Serrin, Sadlowski Serves His Union In Quiet, New York Times, September 27, 1982http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,918689,00.html \\"No Go for Oilcan Eddie.\\" Time, February 21, 1977. He also won in the United States-based locals, but the vote in Canada was overwhelmingly for McBride (McBride had a Canadian, Lynn Williams, running on his slate for International Secretary). Canada also did not have labor law fraud protections that exist in the U.S. Sadlowski had raised donations from both inside and outside the union. His enemies had charged that if he was elected outsiders would run the union, and Sadlowski's failure to respond forcibly may have cost him many votes. When the USWA at their 1978 convention outlawed such donations, Sadlowski sued to overturn the union rule on First Amendment grounds.

She was part of a multi-national five-destroyer screen for the Australian aircraft carrier during the war games.Frame, Pacific Partners, p. 126. Despite being informed of the collision Melbourne had been involved in five years earlier, and of the operating conditions demanded by the Australian admiral commanding the group of ships, Larson was nearly involved in a collision with Melbourne during the early hours of 31 May.Hall, p. 176. The destroyer had put herself in danger while assuming the plane guard station, and only quick thinking on the parts of both warships' crews prevented a collision. Three nights later, , also a part of Melbournes screen, was rammed and sunk by the carrier with the loss of 74 U.S. sailors.Frame, Pacific Partners, p. 127. Larson was involved in the salvaging of Evans stern section after the collision. The Everett F. Larson continued to operate with the 7th Fleet throughout the sixties and early seventies.

SRP receptor The eukaryotic SRP receptor (termed SR) is a heterodimer of SR-alpha (70 kDa) and SR-beta (25 kDa), both of which contain a GTP-binding domain, while the prokaryotic SRP receptor comprises only the monomeric loosely membrane-associated SR-alpha homologue FtsY. SR- alpha regulates the targeting of SRP-ribosome-nascent polypeptide complexes to the translocon. SR-alpha binds to the SRP54 subunit of the SRP complex. The SR-beta subunit is a transmembrane GTPase that anchors the SR-alpha subunit (a peripheral membrane GTPase) to the ER membrane. SR-beta interacts with the N-terminal SRX-domain of SR-alpha, which is not present in the bacterial FtsY homologue. SR-beta also functions in recruiting the SRP-nascent polypeptide to the protein-conducting channel. This family represents homologues of the alpha subunit of the SR receptor. Members of this entry consist of a central six- stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet sandwiched by helix alpha1 on one side and helices alpha2-alpha4 on the other. They interact with the small GTPase SR- beta, forming a complex that matches a class of small G protein-effector complexes, including Rap-Raf, Ras-PI3K(gamma), Ras-RalGDS, and Arl2-PDE(delta). Signal recognition particle (SRP) The signal recognition particle (SRP) is a multimeric protein, which along with its conjugate receptor (SR), is involved in targeting secretory proteins to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) membrane in eukaryotes, or to the plasma membrane in prokaryotes. SRP recognises the signal sequence of the nascent polypeptide on the ribosome, retards its elongation, and docks the SRP-ribosome- polypeptide complex to the RER membrane via the SR receptor. SRP consists of six polypeptides (SRP9, SRP14, SRP19, SRP54, SRP68 and SRP72) and a single 300 nucleotide 7S RNA molecule. The RNA component catalyses the interaction of SRP with its SR receptor. In higher eukaryotes, the SRP complex consists of the Alu domain and the S domain linked by the SRP RNA. The Alu domain consists of a heterodimer of SRP9 and SRP14 bound to the 5' and 3' terminal sequences of SRP RNA. This domain is necessary for retarding the elongation of the nascent polypeptide chain, which gives SRP time to dock the ribosome-polypeptide complex to the RER membrane.

Sprague de Camp, the third book of his Novarian series. It was first published as a two-part serial in the magazine Fantastic for December 1972 and February 1973, and subsequently expanded and revised for book publication. The novel was first published in book form as a paperback by Signet Books in 1973; it was later reprinted by Remploy (1974), Sphere (1978), Del Rey/Ballantine (1981), Baen (1992) and the Thorndike Press (2002). The Remploy edition was both the first British and first hardcover edition.

Sprague de Camp webpageAmazon.com entry for e-book edition It has also been translated into German and Italian. Plot summary On the demonic Twelfth Plane, the demon Zdim Akh's son is drafted for a year's indentured servitude on the human Prime Plane, the demon society having an agreement to provide service to human sorcerers in return for supplies of iron, a raw material it desperately needs. Zdim is duly summoned to the Prime Plane by the sorcerer Dr. Maldivius of Novaria. There he strives to do his duty, but his demonic literal-mindedness hampers him. Assigned to protect the Sibylline Sapphire from any trespassers, he promptly eats Maldivius' apprentice Grax when the latter intrudes. Similar misadventures result in the disgusted Maldivius selling his contract, and the demon is passed from one master to another, from circus master Bagardo to the rich widow Roska of Ir, all the while doing his level best to figure out what the muddled humans truly wish of him. Against all odds he becomes a hero when he recruits aid for the city-state of Ir after it discounts intelligence of an imminent invasion by the cannibal Paaluans. Returning to his home plane early and with extra iron, he resolves never again to leave the comforts of the Twelfth Plane ‚Äî until he realizes how dull it is compared with the picturesque insanity of the human realm... By internal chronology, The Fallible Fiend is the second story in the Novarian series, coming after the short story \\"The Emperor's Fan\\", which is set centuries before the others, and prior to the Reluctant King trilogy. (The Paaluan invasion of Ir is mentioned in the second and third books of the trilogy, The Clocks of Iraz and The Unbeheaded King, respectively, as an event occurring either recently or some generations past.) Setting The world of which Novaria is part is a parallel world to Earth, a plane of existence related to ours in that ours constitutes its afterlife. Culturally it bears resemblances to the eras of both Classical Greece and Medieval Europe. The states of Novaria itself are split between competing systems of government, some of them unique, which allows the author to explore various pros and cons of different styles of governance as his hero tours the country. The name of Ir, the subterranean city-state where much the plot takes place, is simply the Hebrew word for \\"city\\" (◊¢◊ô◊®). Features Adopting the viewpoint of an outsider to comment on the foibles of one's own society has been done before in fiction, but adapting it to fantasy also permits him to extend it into an outside view of humanity as a whole by an alien being and maintain a satirical edge throughout the book. De Camp's demonic protagonist Zdim long remained a uniquely unlikely fantasy hero, as other authors were slow to mine the concept de Camp pioneered. Reception Al Nofi in Amra, observing that the book \\"has neither characters nor plot line in common with the earlier pair\\" of Novarian novels, finds this \\"a very good move on Mr. de Camp's part; it saves the work needed to construct a credible ethos yet gives the author an opportunity to work with new characters and situations.\\" Noting that \\"Mr. de Camp, of course, has been doing unusual things with his swords and sorcery for years,\\" he calls the demon Zdim Akh's son \\"a most unusual hero indeed,\\" \\"one of de Camp's best heroes yet; to me, he seems more human, even, than the hordes of breech- clothed, shaggy-haired giants with names all ending in -ar who romp through countless S & S sagas. All in all, this is a fine book.\\"Nofi, Al. Review in Amra v. 2 no. 60, September 1973, pages 21-22. Roger C. Schlobin praises the book's \\"[d]elightful episodes occur[ring] as the fiend misunderstands his commands and tries to function in a totally alien environment, which is, of course, quite normal for the reader.\\" He feels it \\"[d]eteriorates somewhat at the end as the fiend becomes a hero and saves civilization.Schlobin, Roger C. \\"Masterpieces of Modern Fantasy: an Annotated Core List.\\" In Tymn, Marshall B., ed., The Science Fiction Reference Book, Starmont House, c1981, p. 567. Brian M. Stableford calls \\"The Fallible Fiend ... more offbeat than de Camp's other ventures in the genre,\\" and Zdim \\"perhaps the only sword-and-sorcery hero who regularly devours people. Still, he remains likable as he provides a suitably ironic commentary on human affairs from the demonic standpoint.\\"Stableford, Brian M. \\"L. Sprague de Camp 1907- / Fletcher Pratt 1897-1956,\\" in Bleiler, Everett F., ed., Supernatural Fiction Writers, 1985, v. 2, p. 929. Steven Silver called the book \\"a humorous novel, although not in a laugh-out-loud way.\\" He sees its \\"main point [as] satire, a fact which is driven home if the reader begins to look at characterization or plot, neither of which appear in particular abundance. ... The characters are drawn with broad strokes, each inspired by one, or possibly two, character traits.\\" But \\"as [with] most satire, he causes the reader[s] to recognize the humor of the situation and compare it to their own situation.\\" Silver sees \\"Zdim's travels throughout Novaria as a pretext for unleashing slings and arrows of outrageous satire at governmental practices and systems ... thereby highlighting the follies of our own system of government.\\" The hero's contact with other cultures, the \\"fantasy staples\\" of \\"the semi-human Zaperazh, the horse nomadic Hruntings, and the cannibalistic Paaluans ... clearly shows why each is as implausible as the more 'corrupt' human institutions of civilizations.\\"Silver, Steven. \\"Steven Silver's Reviews: The Fallible Fiend.\\" At The SF Site: The Best in Science Fiction and Fantasy, January 1999. Don D'Ammassa finds \\"The Fallible Fiend ... in much the same vein\\" as The Reluctant King series, with \\"[m]ost of the humor com[ing] from the efforts by the demon to understand human behavior.\\"D'Ammassa, Don. Encyclopedia of Fantasy and Horror Fiction, Facts on File, c2006, p. 82. Mike Ashley called the story \\"a wonderfully nostalgic fantasy in the Unknown tradition.\\"Ashley, Mike. Gateways to Forever: The Story of the Science-Fiction Magazines from 1970-1980, Liverpool University Press, 2007, p. 81.

He became a major general during the reign of Emperor Xiaozhuang, when his father's cousin Erzhu Rong was the paramount general of the state. He was renowned for pacifying the Guanzhong region, which had been seized by agrarian rebel generals Moqi Chounu (‰∏á‰øüÈÜúÂ•¥) and Wang Qingyun (ÁéãÊÖ∂Èõ≤) in 530. He thereafter tried to maintain a relatively distant profile from the other Erzhu clan members, particularly after Emperor Xiaozhuang killed Erzhu Rong later in 530 and then was overthrown and killed by Erzhu Rong's nephew Erzhu Zhao and cousin Erzhu Shilong. In 532, after the other Erzhus had suffered defeats at the hand of the rebelling general Gao Huan, Erzhu Tianguang tried to come to their aid, but was also defeated by another general who rebelled, Husi Chun, and Gao executed him.  Under Erzhu Rong's command  Erzhu Tianguang's father was a cousin of Erzhu Rong, who was a Northern Wei general and the chief of the ethnic Xiongnu Qihu (Â•ëËÉ°) tribe. In Erzhu Tianguang's youth, he was described to be resolute and capable in archery and horseriding. Erzhu Rong considered him a close confidant, and often discussed military matters with him. In 528, after Emperor Xiaoming was poisoned by his mother Empress Dowager Hu, it was after consulting with Erzhu Tianguang that Erzhu Rong set out to attack the capital Luoyang to overthrow Empress Dowager Hu. As he did, he entrusted one of his home provinces, Si Province (ËÇÜÂ∑û, roughly modern Xinzhou, Shanxi) to Erzhu Tianguang, and after Erzhu Rong killed Empress Dowager Hu and made Emperor Xiaozhuang emperor, Erzhu Tianguang was created the Duke of Chang'an. In 528, when Erzhu Rong set out to destroy the rebel Emperor of Qi, Ge Rong (ËëõÊ¶Æ), he entrusted his entire home base, including Bing Province (Âπ∂Â∑û, roughly modern Taiyuan, Shanxi) to Erzhu Tianguang as well, remarking, \\"Only you can make me feel secure about places where I am not at.\\" In 529, Erzhu Tianguang was one of the generals under the command of Erzhu Rong's close associate Yuan Tianmu (ÂÖÉÂ§©Á©Ü) when Yuan Tianmu attacked and defeated the rebel general Xing Gao (ÈÇ¢Êù≤). At the same time, however, Yuan Hao the Prince of Beihai, who also claimed the throne, was attacking Luoyang with the support of rival Liang Dynasty, and Yuan Tianmu was unable to stop Yuan Hao. Emperor Xiaozhuang fled Luoyang, and Yuan Tianmu and Erzhu Tianguang also fled north with their troops, joining with Erzhu Rong. Erzhu Rong sent Erzhu Tianguang back to Bing and Si Provinces to secure them, before he himself advanced south and defeated Yuan Hao. After Yuan Hao's defeat, Emperor Xiaozhuang created Erzhu Tianguang the greater title of Duke of Guangzong. In 530, with Moqi Chounu, who had claimed imperial title by that point, attacking and seizing parts of the Guanzhong region, Erzhu Rong was initially going to send the general Heba Yue (Ë≥ÄÊãîÂ≤≥) to command an army against Moqi. However, Heba Yue declined to be in command, believing that he would draw suspicions even if were victorious, and instead offering to serve under a member of the Erzhu clan. Erzhu Rong therefore put Erzhu Tianguang in command of the army, with Heba and Houmochen Yue (‰æØËé´Èô≥ÊÇÖ) as Erzhu Tianguang's lieutenants. Erzhu Tianguang was given a relatively small army, and initially the campaign against Moqi appeared hopeless, but with Erzhu Tianguang himself and Heba both being capable generals, they scored initial victories and then misled Moqi into believing that they would rest several months before taking further action. Instead, they made a surprise attack against Moqi, capturing him in battle, and then captured Moqi's capital Gaoping (È´òÂπ≥, in modern Guyuan, Ningxia) and Moqi's prime minister Xiao Baoyin. Erzhu Tianguang's follow-up campaign against Moqi Chounu's general Moqi Daoluo (‰∏á‰øüÈÅìÊ¥õ), however, was initially unsuccessful, and Erzhu Rong, in anger, had Emperor Xiaozhuang demote his rank and title to marquess. Erzhu Tianguang, however, was eventually able to force Moqi Daoluo to flee to another rebel general, Wang Qingyun, and then defeated and captured both Moqi Daoluo and Wang.  Involvement in the campaign against Emperor Xiaozhuang  With the Guanzhong region and the surrounding provinces pacified, Erzhu Tianguang was put in charge of those provinces, with his headquarters at Chang'an. His title was restored to duke. Late in 530, Emperor Xiaozhuang, apprehensive that Erzhu Rong would eventually seized the throne, ambushed him in the palace and killed him. Erzhu Rong's cousin Erzhu Shilong and nephew Erzhu Zhao rebelled, declaring Erzhu Rong's wife Princess Beixiang's nephew Yuan Ye the Prince of Changguang emperor. However, Erzhu Tianguang initially took no corresponding action; rather, when Emperor Xiaozhuang sent his official Zhu Rui (Êú±Áëû) to try to persuade Erzhu Tianguang to join his side, Erzhu Tianguang deliberately made ambiguous gestures, trying to instead encourage Emperor Xiaozhuang to abandon Luoyang and flee, rather than to directly confront the emperor. Both Emperor Xiaozhuang and Yuan Ye conferred princely titles on Erzhu Tianguang, and Erzhu Tianguang eventually accepted Yuan Ye's bestowment of the Prince of Longxi title, but did not make further threatening gestures against Emperor Xiaozhuang. Around the new year 531, Erzhu Zhao made a surprise attack on Luoyang and captured it and Emperor Xiaozhuang, and only then did Erzhu Tianguang go to Luoyang to meet with Erzhu Zhao and Erzhu Shilong, but soon returned to his post at Chang'an. While Erzhu Tianguang was still at Luoyang, however, he suggested to Erzhu Shilong, who had become concerned that Yuan Ye's lineage was too far from the recent emperors' to be a proper candidate for the throne, to make Emperor Xianwen's grandson Yuan Gong the Prince of Guangling emperor. In spring 531, Erzhu Shilong took such action, forcing Yuan Ye to yield the throne to Yuan Gong, who took the throne as Emperor Jiemin.  Defeat and death  Erzhu Tianguang continued to control the western provinces, and in summer 531 he attacked the rebel general Suqin Mingda (ÂÆøÂã§ÊòéÈÅî) and captured him, taking Xia Province (Â§èÂ∑û, roughly modern Yulin, Shanxi), which Suqin controlled, under his own control, while delivering Suqin to Luoyang to be executed. However, when the general Gao Huan rebelled at Xindu (‰ø°ÈÉΩ, in modern Hengshui, Hebei) later in the summer, Erzhu Tianguang abandoned his planned campaigns against the rebel generals Gedouling Yili (Á¥áË±ÜÈôµ‰ºäÂà©) and Moqi Shouluogan (‰∏á‰øüÂèóÊ¥õÂπ≤), who controlled the modern central and western Gansu, and prepared for possible action in the east, although he did not immediately intervene in the campaign between Gao and his fellow Erzhu clan members, even after Gao defeated Erzhu Zhao in battle late in 531. In 532, hoping to force Erzhu Tianguang to come to his clan members' aid so that they could be destroyed together, the generals Husi Chun and Heba Sheng (Ë≥ÄÊãîÂãù, Heba Yue's brother) persuaded Erzhu Shilong to put pressure on Erzhu Tianguang to act against Gao Huan. Soon, Erzhu Tianguang took his army to converge with Erzhu Zhao, and Erzhu Shilong's brothers Erzhu Dul√º (ÁàæÊú±Â∫¶Âæã) and Erzhu Zhongyuan (ÁàæÊú±‰ª≤ÈÅ†) at the important city Yecheng, which Gao had taken earlier in 532. Despite numerical advantage, however, Gao defeated them, and Erzhu Zhao fled back to Jinyang (ÊôâÈôΩ, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), while Erzhu Zhongyuan fled back to Huatai (ÊªëÂè∞, in modern Anyang, Henan). Erzhu Tianguang and Erzhu Dul√º retreated toward Luoyang, but Husi rebelled at this time, seizing the fortress of Beizhong (Âåó‰∏≠, just north of Luoyang across the Yellow River), and when Erzhu Dul√º and Erzhu Tianguang failed to recapture Beizhong, they were forced to flee, and they were captured and delivered to Husi, who in turn delivered them, as well as the heads of Erzhu Shilong and Erzhu Shilong's brother Erzhu Yanbo (ÁàæÊú±ÂΩ•‰ºØ) (whom Husi had earlier captured and executed) to Gao. Gao had Erzhu Tianguang and Erzhu Dul√º executed. The official history of Northern Wei, the Book of Wei, written during the succeeding Northern Qi (whose imperial family was Gao Huan's descendants), was largely highly critical of the Erzhus, but remarked that Erzhu Tianguang was, unlike the other Erzhu clan members, neither corrupt nor violent, and praised him for his recapturing the western provinces for Northern Wei.

The IACP represented the pilots of Continental and Continental Express Airlines and was initially headquartered in Denver, Colorado near Stapleton International Airport. History In 1985 a card signing campaign by strike breaking pilots (strikebreaker) gave CEO Frank Lorenzo an excuse for stating that the airline was withdrawing its voluntary recognition of the Air Line Pilots Association, International (ALPA) as the bargaining representative for the Continental pilots. The rationale for this action was based on the belief that since in the 1930s the airline, in the face of an overwhelming number of cards requesting that a representational election be held, agreed to recognize ALPA as the bargaining agent for the pilots without a representational election, that they could withdraw that recognition at any time. The strike breaking pilots (strikebreaker) of Continental Airlines maintained that after that time they were no longer represented by ALPA, however, ALPA maintained and the National Mediation Board (NMB) confirmed that ALPA continued to represent all Continental pilots despite the airline's pronouncement to the contrary. This confirmation is best evidenced in a letter from the NMB to Continental Airlines in which the NMB notified that since the airline had failed to respond to a Section 6 letter from ALPA to open negotiations, that an NMB representative would present himself at the airline‚Äôs headquarters to assist in opening contract negotiations between ALPA and the airline. Additionally, the NMB answered several pilot inquiries about their representational status stating that there had not been any action that resulting in a change to the bargaining agent. Traditional union representation by ALPA in terms of contract negotiations (collective bargaining) and prosecution of grievances was virtually nonexistent from the end of the pilot strike in 1985, but ALPA vigorously represented the rights of pilots who return to work after the strike. The contentious 1993 representational election conducted by the NMB between the IACP and ALPA settled the question of ALPA representation. The IACP was victorious by a wide 68% margin where more than 92% of the eligible voters participated, the highest participation ever recorded by the NMB. The Continental Express pilots also won the right to be represented by the IACP during that election. Negotiations In 1995 the IACP met with exceptional initial success by securing the first contract for the Continental pilots in more than ten years, and the very first contract for the Continental Express pilots. Most noteworthy is that the contracts were negotiated while the airline was mired in its second bankruptcy, and during the life of the Continental contract, overall pilot compensation was increased more than 80%. In 1999 the contract negotiations by the IACP yielded even greater improvements to the pay and benefits of Continental pilots. The Continental pilot contract was followed shortly by a new contract for the Continental Express pilots. Merger A third organizational effort by ALPA began officially in 2000 (headed by the then current IACP president captain Pat Burke) was finally successful and approximately 7,000 Continental and Continental Express pilots elected about 2:1 to be represented by ALPA, at which time the IACP ceased to exist (May 22, 2001).

Synopsis Once there was a man had to pay the king rent in the form of four baskets of pears. One year his trees yielded only three and a half baskets full, so he put his youngest daughter in the fourth basket to fill it up. When the baskets arrived at the castle, the royal servants found the girl by the pears she ate, and they set her to work as a servant. As the girl grew up, she and the prince fell in love, which caused the other maidservants to grow envious. In Manning-Sander's version, the servants told the king that she had boasted of doing all the laundry in one day; with the prince's aid, she was able to do it. In most other versions, the maids then tell the king that she had also boasted that she could steal the witch's (or ogress's, depending on the version) treasure. The king insisted that she do it. In Manning-Sanders had the prince told her what to do. Although Calvino found this in his original version, to increase her identification with the pears, she went and passed by an apple tree and a peach tree to sleep in the third, a pear tree. In the morning, a little old woman was under the tree.Italo Calvino, Italian Folktales p 718 In both cases, they gave her grease, bread, and millet. She went on, gave the millet to three women in a bakery, sweeping out the ovens with their hair, threw the bread to some mastiffs, crossed by a red river with a charm that the little old woman had given her, and greased the hinges of the witch's house. Then she took the treasure chest. The chest began to speak, but the door refused to slam on her, the river to drown her, the dogs to eat her, and the women in the bakery to bake her. Curious, she opened the chest and a golden hen with her chicks escaped, or musical instruments that played on their own, but the little old woman or prince put them back. The prince told her to ask, for her reward, for the coal chest in the cellar. When she asked and it was brought up, the prince was hidden in it, so they married.

He was the founder, along with Albert Petrak, of the International Piano Archives (initially named the International Piano Library but later changed due to state law). Benko managed the non-profit institution for two decades, attracting Spanish virtuosa Alicia de Larrocha to act as the President of the corporation, and building an enormous collection of recordings, scores, memorabilia and associated matter concerning concert pianists. In 1977 Benko donated the collections to the University of Maryland, College Park, where they formed the nucleus of the International Piano Archives at Maryland. Perhaps Benko's most hailed achievement to date is the unearthing and publishing of all known recordings of the Polish virtuoso Josef Hofmann, as well as dozens of historic recordings by other \\"golden age\\" pianists. He is also credited with rediscovering and bringing back to public awareness the elderly and reclusive Hungarian piano virtuoso Ervin Nyiregyh√°zi. The recordings that Benko produced, initially for the International Piano Archives, as well as new recordings he made with Nyiregyh√°zi that were issued by Columbia Records, were heatedly discussed for a time due to the pianist's enormous dynamic range and willful interpretive style. Well-regarded critic Harold C. Schonberg - also a devotee of Romantic pianism - called one of them \\"a divine madness.\\" Benko had almost no formal education, but credits his close relationships with Schonberg and Frank Cooper, founder of the Festival of Neglected Romantic Music at Butler University, as the most important professional associations in his life, and considers each a mentor. Benko's later career has included lecturing, articles, reviews, liner notes. With Edward Blickstein, he is the co-author of Chopin's Prophet, the Life of pianist Vladimir de Pachmann. He has been engaged for over thirty years in work on a comprehensive biography of Josef Hofmann. Benko was awarded the American Liszt Society medal at the 2017 Festival of The American Liszt Society in April 2017. The citation for the medal concludes with these words by Dr. Richard Zimdars: \\"Gregor‚Äôs life work has made and will continue to make a priceless contribution to preserving the aural and documentary history of piano performance in the twentieth century for listeners, performers, scholars, and Lisztians.

Army established Fort Selden in 1865 for the purpose of protecting westward settlers from Native American raids, the post fell into disrepair after the American Civil War. It was ultimately abandoned in 1891, due in large part to the decision to expand Fort Bliss and the lack of any expenditures for repair of the facility. History Paraje de Robledo For centuries the site of Fort Selden had been the Paraje de Robledo, a camp site along the course of the El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro on the east bank of the Rio Grande. The campground or paraje was named for an old Spanish soldier, Pedro Robledo, who died and was buried there on the 1598 expedition of Juan de O√±ate.

Later the name was shortened to Paraje Robledo.Appendix 4 Historical Narrative, FORT SELDEN MILITARY RESERVATION; Spanish Contact from nmhistoricsites.org accessed Dec. 21, 2016 Paraje Robledo was the last stop along the Rio Grande before the route of the Camino Real left the river to enter the Jornada del Muerto on the way north toward Santa Fe. By the time of the American Civil War the Mesilla Valley, around Las Cruces had developed a population base who valued the fertile land along the Rio Grande and were suffering from attacks by the Apache. Also travelers along Camino Real, that passed through the area, were uneasy about moving further north on the Jornada del Muerto for the same reason. Camp Robledo In 1861, the Confederate Army established a post, Camp Robledo, at the Paraje de Robledo to guard the approaches from the north to the Mesilla Valley of Confederate Arizona along the Rio Grande and across the Jornada del Muerto on the El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro. It was used as a base for cavalry patrols and operations against Fort Craig and other places in Union held New Mexico Territory. Fort Selden Fort Selden was located in Do√±a Ana County, 12 miles north of Las Cruces, New Mexico. It was established in 1865 at the Paraje de Robledo in an effort to bring peace among the varied inhabitants in the south central region of present-day New Mexico. It was named in honor of Col. Henry Raymond Selden who had served many years in New Mexico Territory before and during the American Civil War and had died of illness in Do√±a Ana County, and buried at Fort Union on February 2, 1865. The primary intent of the fort was to protect settlers and travelers in the Mesilla Valley from attacks by desperados and Mescalero Apache Indians. Built near the banks of the Rio Grande, the adobe fort housed units of the California Volunteer Cavalry, U.S. Army Infantry and Cavalry. The first troops to occupy the fort were Company M 1st Regiment of Cavalry, California Volunteers from 31 July 1865 to 31 August 1866, and subsequently companies of the 125th US Colored Infantry Regiment, a group of African-American enlisted soldiers from Kentucky who had been mustered into the Union Army near the close of the American Civil War. Several of the units assigned later, including the 38th Infantry Regiment, 9th US Cavalry and 10th US Cavalry, all composed of black troopers, sometimes referred to as Buffalo Soldiers. As a testament to their bravery, nine Buffalo Soldiers received the Medal of Honor while serving in New Mexico Territory.David Pike, Roadside New Mexico: A Guide to Historic Markers, Revised and Expanded Edition, UNM Press, Aug 1, 2015, 160. Fort Selden Cemetery In 1884, Captain Arthur MacArthur, Jr., 13th Infantry, was assigned as post commander. With him was his wife and two young sons, Arthur MacArthur III, age 7, and Douglas MacArthur, age 4. In his memoirs, Douglas MacArthur wrote that it was at Fort Selden that he and his brother learned to ride and shoot, even before we learned to read and write. The MacArthurs spent two years at Fort Selden before Captain MacArthur was transferred to Fort Wingate. By late 1886, the frontier had rapidly changed. Geronimo's surrender to Brigadier General Nelson A. Miles at Skeleton Canyon in Arizona ended the nation's long Indian Wars. As a result, Army commander- in-chief, Lt. General William Tecumseh Sherman, ordered a consolidation of six military posts in southern New Mexico and eastern Arizona. He favored a giant, one-square-mile installation large enough to accommodate six troops of cavalry and six companies of infantry. Sherman further ordered that the permanent post be located near the junction of the Santa Fe Railroad and the Southern Pacific Railroad in southern New Mexico. For a time, Fort Selden was the leading candidate for the site of the new post, but because the railroads had brought spectacular growth to the El Paso, Texas area, Fort Bliss, was selected. By 1890, criminals and raiding parties were no longer considered a threat as hostilities eventually lessened and the fort was no longer needed. Like many small forts in the American Southwest, the government decommissioned the fort and it was abandoned for the last time in 1891. On 20 January 1891, Lt. James Brett, commanding a small caretaker force, filed the final post return, which reported: > \\"All public property from this post having been disposed of, it was > abandoned on this date.\\" Fort Selden Historic Site right For decades, the ruins of Fort Selden were consumed by the ravages of rain, snow and wind. Vandals, souvenir hunters and treasure-seekers added to its demise. In 1963, the land encompassing Fort Selden was donated to the state by Harry N. Bailey, a longtime resident of the area. In 1970, the fort was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and in 1974, the fort was declared a New Mexico State Monument. It is overseen by the New Mexico Historic Sites (formerly State Monuments) Division of the New Mexico Department of Cultural Affairs. The present day ruins are available for viewing via an interpretive trail. A visitor center offers exhibits on frontier and military life. Fort Selden Historic Site is located north of Las Cruces, New Mexico, off Exit 19 of Interstate 25, near Radium Springs, New Mexico.

It was particularly notable for a more rigorous approach to recipe writing than had been common up to that point. In the preface Farmer states: ::It is my wish that it may not only be looked upon as a compilation of tried and tested recipes, but that it may awaken an interest through its condensed scientific knowledge which will lead to deeper thought and broader study of what to eat. Farmer's 1896 compilation became the best-selling cookbook of the era. In 2007, that period of American culinary history was recreated in an elaborate dinner using the Victorian cooking methods outlined in this book. The extensive preparations and the ultimate results were described in a book entitled Fannie's Last Supper by Christopher Kimball; and an American public television program of the same name was broadcast in 2010. Publication history When Little, Brown & Company was preparing the first edition of Fannie Farmer's cookbook, they were not confident it would sell well. As such, the first edition, released in 1896, had a limited run of only 3,000 copies.Nelson, Randy F. The Almanac of American Letters, p. 94. It proved an immediate success. Facsimiles of the original book are still in print. Heavily revised successor books, later retitled The Fannie Farmer Cookbook, have also been published, the most recent being the thirteenth edition by author Marion Cunningham, originally issued in 1990 and then reissued in 1996 for the 100th anniversary of the original book.

It was his first novel. Synopsis Marty Strauss is a gambler recently released from prison. He is hired as the personal bodyguard of Joseph Whitehead, one of the wealthiest men in the world. The job is more complicated and dangerous than first he thought. He gets caught up in a series of supernatural events involving Whitehead, and a devilish man, Mamoulian, with whom Whitehead made a deal with the Devil during World War II. Whitehead is haunted with Mamoulian's supernatural powers (like raising the dead) to urge him to satisfy Mamoulian's pact. Whitehead decides to escape after several encounters with Mamoulian and after having his wife, his former bodyguard, and his daughter, Carys, taken away from him. With hope left to save Carys, Marty Strauss believes that Whitehead deserved his punishment after all and also decides to save the heroin addict from being another victim to the damnation game. Characters Marty Strauss: A man addicted to gambling and released from prison works and lives on Mr. Whitehead's Estate as a personal bodyguard.

Nancy McIntosh (25 October 1866 - February 20, 1954) was an American-born singer and actress who performed mostly on the London stage. Her father was a member of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, which had been blamed in connection with the 1889 Johnstown Flood that resulted in the loss of over 2,200 lives in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. McIntosh is perhaps best known for creating the role of Princess Zara in Gilbert and Sullivan's Utopia, Limited in 1893. She obtained this role after beginning a concert singing career in America in 1887, moving to London in 1890 and continuing her concert career in Britain. She became one of the last of W. S. Gilbert's actress proteges and continued her acting and singing career in Britain and America for several years. After McIntosh retired from the stage, she lived with Gilbert and his wife until Lady Gilbert's death in 1936 and eventually inherited Gilbert's estate, helping to preserve his legacy by selling his papers to the British Museum and leaving the remainder of the Gilbert estate to the Royal General Theatrical Fund. Early life and career with Charles Kenningham in Utopia, Limited Nancy McIntosh was born in Cleveland, Ohio, the daughter of William A. McIntosh (died 1921) and his wife Minerva n√©e Bottenberg (died 1883).\\"Death of Mrs. W. A.

Nancy's brothers were John S. McIntosh (1860‚Äì1889), a businessman, and Burr McIntosh, a writer, publisher, photographer, war correspondent, radio personality, and stage and film actor. Nancy was \\"an expert horsewoman, had won prizes in sculling matches, could shoot and fence, played baseball and cricket and enjoyed swimming and diving.\\"Walters, Michael. Article in \\"Some Comments on Original Artists\\", Gilbertian Gossip, No. 39, Winter 1992‚Äì93 A pupil of Signor Achille Errani, McIntosh commenced a singing career, making her debut on the concert platform on 3 March 1887 in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. On 1 November 1887, she appeared in the first of a series of concerts with William H. Sherwod in the Chickering Musical Bureau concerts in Boston, Massachusetts, singing pieces by, among others, Tosti, Chopin, Bach and Wagner.Nancy McIntosh's cuttings book (1887 - 1893) in the Gilbert Papers, British Library She also made a specialty of singing Scottish songs.\\"Princess Zara: A Chat with Nancy McIntosh\\", The Sketch, Vol. III, No. 37, 11 October 1893 In 1890 The Daily Gazette and Free Press in Elmira, New York wrote of her: \\"Miss McIntosh has studied under the best masters in Paris, London and New York. She will sail for London on June 25th and will make her debut there as a concert singer under Randegger at the London academy. It is safe to prophecy that her name will be added to the list of American girls who have carried London by storm.\\"The Daily Gazette and Free Press May 26, 1890 McIntosh travelled to England with her father in 1890 (shortly after the flood disaster), where she studied voice for a year under George Henschel. She then sang in concerts, including in Henschel's Serbischer Liederspiel at Kensington Town Hall in December 1891The Times, 2 December 1891 and at The Crystal Palace, where she sang in Beethoven's Choral Symphony and selections from Wagner's Die Meistersinger. She also performed with the London Symphony Orchestra, among others, and in oratorio in the British provinces. Throughout 1892 she sang in Monday Popular Concerts in Hull, Sheffield, Manchester and Liverpool. On one occasion Arthur Sullivan was in the audience. In December 1892 she sang in Handel's Messiah.Rochester and Chatham Journal, 24 December 1892 Early in 1893 McIntosh sang in a series of concerts under Sir Charles Hall√© in Manchester, Wales and Bowness-on-Windermere, among other places. His Excellency In the Spring of 1893, Henschel held a dinner party where W. S. Gilbert asked McIntosh if she was interested in singing on stage. Gilbert asked Arthur Sullivan to hear her audition as the lead soprano in their forthcoming opera, Utopia, Limited. In letters to Sullivan, Gilbert said of her: > \\"She is rather tall, extremely fair ‚Äì very nice looking, without being > beautiful ‚Äì good expressive face ‚Äì no appreciable American twang. Something > like a good and ladylike version of Roosevelt. ... She sings up to C > (whatever that means) and I am told that she is never out of tune.

Sullivan recorded in his diary that he was \\"Disappointed in her voice ... but I don't think she was at her best ‚Äì however, she will do as she is nice, sympathetic and intelligent.\\"Wolfson, p. 27 Having been accepted, she debuted on the theatrical stage in October 1893 at the Savoy Theatre, creating the role of Princess Zara in Utopia, a role much expanded for her from its initial conception.Stone, David. Nancy McIntosh at Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, 17 August 2005, accessed 17 April 2010 According to scholar John Wolfson, Gilbert's expansion of the role damaged and unbalanced the script by detracting from its satire of government.Wolfson, p. 32 Commentators agreed that the inexperienced McIntosh was not a good actress, and during the run of Utopia, which lasted into June 1894, her lack of confidence and ill health combined to affect her performance.Ainger, pp. 349‚Äì50 Utopia, Limited was to be McIntosh's only part with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, as Sullivan refused to write another piece in which she was to take part.Ainger, p. 352 After Utopia as La Favorita in The Circus Girl McIntosh became one of the last actress prot√©g√©es of W. S. Gilbert's. She eventually lived with Gilbert and Lady Gilbert, and they considered her an \\"adopted\\" daughter, as they had no children of their own. After Utopia, she appeared as Dorothy in a revival of Gilbert's Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith (1894) and created the role of Christina in Gilbert and Osmond Carr's His Excellency (1894‚Äì95). Discussions over McIntosh playing the role of Yum-Yum in a proposed revival of The Mikado led to an argument between Gilbert and Sullivan that prevented the revival, and Gilbert's insistence upon her playing the soprano lead in His Excellency caused Sullivan to refuse to set the piece.Wolfson, pp. 61‚Äì62 In May 1885, McIntosh sang the role of Margarita in Sullivan's cantata The Martyr of Antioch in Dover, receiving a warm review.\\"The Martyr of Antioch\\", Dover Express, 10 May 1895, p. 5 McIntosh appeared in the American production of His Excellency in 1895 and also starred in New York at Daly's Theatre in the title role of The Geisha (1896‚Äì97).Green, Stanley. Encyclopedia of the Musical Theatre, p. 147, New York: Da Capo Press (1980), She also played Hero in Much Ado About Nothing (singing a solo in the suite of incidental music), Julia Mannering in Guy Mannering, Miranda in The Tempest and La Favorita in The Circus Girl (all in 1897 at Daly's).Brown, Thomas Allston. \\"A history of the New York stage\\". Dodd, Mead and company (1903), pp. 580‚Äì82 Soon after this, she retired from the stage, making occasional concert appearances. At a recital at the Bechstein Hall in 1903 she sang 18 songs by Richard Strauss,The Times, 30 April 1903, p. 8 and at the same hall in 1909 she sang the soprano part in Walford Davies's Pastorale; \\"a most welcome reappearance\\", wrote The Times.The Times, 30 May 1906, p. 10 McIntosh's grave at Stanmore After nearly a decade away from the operatic stage, McIntosh returned, at Gilbert's request, to appear as Selene, the Fairy Queen, in Gilbert and Edward German's flop, Fallen Fairies at the Savoy Theatre in 1909. The theatre's management attributed much of the blame for the failure of Fallen Fairies to McIntosh. Critics said that she was \\"too much a tragedy queen\\"; the sensuality required by the role was \\"not her sphere\\".Stedman, pp. 334‚Äì35 It is likely, however, that the work's tedious libretto was as much to blame. In any case, C. H. Workman, the opera's producer and lead comic, was forced to replace McIntosh after the first week of the opera's run, incurring the wrath of Gilbert, who banned him from playing in any of his pieces in Britain.Morrison, Robert. \\"The Controversy Surrounding Gilbert's Last Opera\\" , The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 17 April 2010 McIntosh never appeared in an opera again, although she may have had concert engagements. Retirement with the Gilberts McIntosh lived with the Gilberts for the rest of their lives, at their home, Grim's Dyke, where she assisted Lady Gilbert as hostess and published some articles in the press about Gilbert's many and exotic pets. After Lady Gilbert died in 1936, McIntosh sold the house and moved to Knightsbridge, London. She succeeded Lady Gilbert as Vice-President of the Gilbert & Sullivan Society in London. Gilbert's entire estate, including the Garrick Theatre, passed from Lady Gilbert to McIntosh. She took part in a drive to raise funds for a proposed National Theatre, endowing a seat in Gilbert's name in 1938.The Times, 13 August 1938, p. 8 McIntosh died in London in 1954, and the remainder of the Gilbert estate went to the Royal General Theatrical Fund. This included stocks and revenues from the sale of Gilbert's papers to the British Museum and substantial royalties from the recordings of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas on the HMV and Decca labels. Her ashes were buried with those of W. S. Gilbert and Lady Gilbert in the churchyard at the Church of St. John the Evangelist in Stanmore. Notes References  * McIntosh, Nancy. \\"The Late Sir W.S.

In protest, the Kenseikai initiated a no confidence motion, which subsequently dissolved the Diet and led to the political isolation of the Kenseikai for almost a decade. During its period in the opposition, the Kenseikai strongly opposed the Siberian Intervention and pushed for greater rights for labor unions.Garon. The State and Labor in Modern Japan p. 63‚Äì65 In the 1924 General Election, the Kenseikai secured 150 seats, making it the largest single party in the Lower House, but without a majority. Kat≈ç agreed to form a coalition government with the Rikken Seiyukai (led by Takahashi Korekiyo), which had 100 seats, and the Kakushin Club (led by Inukai Tsuyoshi), which had 30 seats. This three-party coalition (Goken Sampa Naikaku) was the first ruling coalition government in Japanese history, and used its majority to focus on domestic political reform and a moderate foreign policy. It pushed strongly for rule under the Meiji Constitution, without influence or control by the genr≈ç. It also favored universal male suffrage (which led to the General Election Law) and much needed reforms in labor laws and in the economic situation for farmers. However, despite its liberal image, the coalition passed the Peace Preservation Law in 1925. Following Kat≈ç's death, the party was led by Wakatsuki Reijir≈ç, but his cabinet was unable to weather the Sh≈çwa financial crisis of 1927. The Kenseikai merged with the Seiy≈´ Hont≈ç in June 1927 to form the Rikken Minseit≈ç. References  * Jansen, Marius B. (2000). The Making of Modern Japan.

The kings of Tonga and their very close relatives (wives, husbands, children) are buried there. Those who are a little farther away from the mainline (cousins, nephews, nieces, inlaws) are buried elsewhere, in other chiefly cemeteries. Kings from older times, (i.e. the Tui Tonga dynasty), are mostly buried in the langi in Mua. Malaekula is a short distance south of the royal palace along the Hala Tui (kings road). Kings Road is the official name of this road and its name means that this is the last road every Tongan King will travel during his reign, toward his resting place in Mala'ekula. This road is also known as the Hala Paini (pine road) because of the Norfolk pines (a royal tree in Tonga) which were planted by Europeans along this road but all have disappeared due to the deep roots reaching the underground seawater. The cemetery was established when the first king of modern Tonga died, Siaosi TƒÅufaƒÅhau Tupou I. His tomb is positioned in the middle of the field, such that one can see it there when looking from the palace grounds straight along the Hala Tui . The word malae means in Tongan: (village)-green, park, playground, etc. but it is also the royal word for cemetery. Kula means red. It is a reminder of the famous kƒÅtoanga kula (red festival) held at that place in 1885. The festival was a fundraising event for Tonga college (whose corporate colour is vermilion-red, opened 1882), and everybody was dressed in red that day. References * Hixon, Margaret, 2000.

It takes its name from the Mapudungun words for \\"valley\\" (mau) and \\"rainy\\" (len). Geography The town of Maule lies near the Maule River. The Maule commune spans an area of . History Since the time of the Incas, the area that makes up the Maule commune today has been a place of strategic and communicative value due to its close proximity to the river of the same name. In this area, the city of Talca was founded as the Villa de San Agust√≠n about to the north. In the mid 18th century, nearby Duao was founded as the communal seat. During the 19th century, many people were attracted to the mining activity in the area of El Chavito and settled here looking for a better future. They founded various towns, principally Peumo. Toward the west was the old river port of Linares de Perales which lies between the confluence of the Maule and Claro rivers, where barges transported agricultural products to their destination of Constituci√≥n. On 30 December 1927, then-president Carlos Ib√°√±ez del Campo Mientras renamed Peumo to Maule and established the commune with Supreme Decree 8583. At this time, the communal seat was moved from Duao to Maule where it remains to this day. In 1928, a year after its founding, the commune of Maule, which was at one time owned by the Lailhacar brothers, belonged to the municipality of Duao but was renamed to the municipality of Maule. Until 1927, the ancient city of Duao had been led by seven alcaldes. The current commune of Maule, since its first mayor Carlos Garcena to its present mayor, has been led by 39 alcaldes. Economy The economy of the commune is based primary on agriculture and stockbreeding. The goldmine El Chavito can be found on the riverbank where El √Åguila hill, property of the Silva Neale family, was the area's main gold deposit in the 19th century. The vineyard and garden La Vertientes (meaning \\"The Slopes\\") has become the premiere industrial flower garden that exports flowers and seeds to Europe, particularly to Germany. Their owner, Carlos Steinhoff von Bohlen, married Amalia Silva Neale and began work in the 1950s, becoming a pioneer in the commune in this non-traditional export trade. In the Maule Region, principle exports are wine and fruits such as apples and grapes. Demographics According to data from the 2002 Census of Population and Housing, Maule had 16,837 inhabitants; of these, 6,739 (40.0%) lived in urban areas and 10,098 (60.0%) in rural areas. At that time, there were 8,691 men and 8,146 women. The population grew 22.3% (3,068 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses. The demonym for a person from Maule is Maulino for a man or Maulina for a woman. Administration As a commune, Maule is a third-level administrative division of Chile administered by a municipal council, headed by an alcalde who is directly elected every four years. The 2008-2012 alcalde is Iv√°n Riveros Cerda (ILE), and his council members are: * Luis Vasquez Galvez (UDI) * Sergio Jelvez Medina (PS) * Pablo Opazo Encina (DC) * Vladimir Albornoz Espina (ILD) * Carlos Ovalle Rojas (ILF) * Juan Gutierrez Moreno (RN) Within the electoral divisions of Chile, Maule is represented in the Chamber of Deputies by Pablo Lorenzini (PDC) and Pedro Pablo Alvarez-Salamanca (UDI) as part of the 38th electoral district, (together with Curepto, Constituci√≥n, Empedrado, Pencahue, San Clemente, Pelarco, R√≠o Claro and San Rafael).

His most noteworthy activities relate to his missionary work in Western Canada between 1840 and 1848. Early life Rundle was born in Mylor, Cornwall in 1811. As the grandson of the noted Methodist lay minister William Carvosso, and nephew of Carvosso's prominent missionary son, Benjamin, religion, in particular Methodism, was an obvious influence on Rundle's life from early on.Rundle, R: \\"The Rundle Journals\\", ix. Glenbow Institute, 1977 Rundle's father kept his family within the Church of England. This Anglican influence stayed with Robert even after he joined the Methodist church in later years, as he still relied on documents such as the Book of Common Prayer in his ministry. Robert Rundle enrolled in a business school near Boscastle, Cornwall in 1837. Once describing himself as a \\"radical\\", he felt that he would, \\"be transformed into a Tory before long,\\" by the influence of his instructors.Rundle, R: \\"The Rundle Journals\\", xi. Glenbow Institute, 1977 While at Boscastle, Rundle took an interest in the Wesleyan Church affairs there. Eventually Rundle joined the Wesleyan Church in a more active role; he undertook several months of missionary training, and was ordained on 8 March 1840, in London after being approved for a missionary assignment in Rupert's Land. Travel to Rupert's Land In 1840, the Hudson's Bay Company reached a deal with the Wesleyan Missionary Society that several Methodist missionaries would be dispatched to the western districts of Rupert's Land. This was spurred in part by pressure from Evangelical groups in England, as well as from a desire by the Company to improve its public face by improving the standard of living in Rupert's Land. Ultimately, it was also meant to keep the British Government sympathetic to the HBC in case another party tried to stake a claim on Rupert's Land. The Company's Governor in Rupert's Land, Sir George Simpson, wanted to avoid giving ground to the Roman Catholic missionaries, who were backed by the French Government and already had a presence in the eastern districts, and maintain the HBC's control over the west.Rundle, R: \\"The Rundle Journals\\", xvi‚Äìxvii. Glenbow Institute, 1977 Robert Rundle was among the four who were invited, and after only two months of training, he was ordained. Just over a week later on 16 March 1840, he shipped out from Liverpool. When Rundle landed in New York City, he travelled first north to Montreal, and then started westward on his long journey across the expanse of Rupert's Land. He encountered natives during this travel, and quickly found that the apprehensions that he had had of meeting them contrasted with the delight he felt at being in their company. He arrived at Fort Edmonton, the center of the Hudson's Bay Company Saskatchewan District, in October 1840. Years in Saskatchewan Rundle arrived in Fort Edmonton on 16 October 1840, after almost a month and a half travelling by river. He remained in the Saskatchewan District for eight years before his permanent departure. Rundle's contemporaries Several persons were crucial to Robert Rundle's missionary work and professional growth during his eight years in Rupert's Land. They are listed below. Governor Sir George Simpson ‚Äì Governor-in-Chief of Rupert's Land, Simpson was the head of the HBC's operations there. He met Rundle on at least one occasion in July 1841, and the two shared correspondence during Rundle's tenure at Edmonton. Privately, Simpson criticized Rundle's wanderings amongst the First Nations, and like his subordinate John Rowand, questioned Rundle's aptitude for missionary work.Rundle, R: \\"The Rundle Journals\\", xxxviii‚Äìxxxix. Glenbow Institute, 1977 However, Simpson had worked tirelessly in service of the HBC and expected the same from those around him, and that his criticisms came very early in the then-inexperienced Rundle's career. Governor Simpson later professed support for a school in the area to be taught by Rundle with native children attending, but this did not materialize. Chief Factor John Rowand ‚Äì As Chief Factor of Saskatchewan, Rowand, who ran the District from Edmonton, was a reputed businessman and firm disciplinarian. Rowand expressed fear that conversion by missionaries would distract the natives from the trapping and trading of animal furs, which was vital to the Company's operation. Nevertheless, he took a liking to Rundle early on, despite opinions that the missionary was too young for his chargeRundle, R: \\"The Rundle Journals\\", xxxiv. Glenbow Institute, 1977 and ill-suited to pioneer living.Rundle, R: \\"The Rundle Journals\\", xliii. Glenbow Institute, 1977 Rundle held a form of school and instructed those of Rowand's children who still dwelled in Edmonton. Rowand also provided one of his horses for Rundle's use, named 'Little Black'.Rundle, R: \\"The Rundle Journals\\", xxxiii. Glenbow Institute, 1977 Chief Trader John Edward Harriott ‚Äì As John Rowand's second-in-command, and also Rowand's son-in-law, Harriott was a valuable benefactor for Robert Rundle. He assisted Rundle in the translation of a prayer book to Cree language, and was known to have helped the mission's endeavours in various ways. He was the first person on record to be married by Rundle in the Saskatchewan District, having sanctified his wedding vows to John Rowand's daughter Nancy in 1841 (whereas he and Nancy had been engaged in a country marriage since the late 1830s). Reverend James Evans ‚Äì Evans was the supervisor of the Wesleyan missionaries in Rupert's Land. A linguist, Evans is credited with devising the syllabics, which constitutes a written language for the Cree and was subsequently taught by Rundle and others.Rundle, R: \\"The Rundle Journals\\", xxx. Glenbow Institute, 1977 Evans' removal to face trial for a sexual misconduct, and untimely death, in 1846, left Rundle and his Methodist colleagues unsupported.Rundle, R: \\"The Rundle Journals\\", lii. Glenbow Institute, 1977 Father Pierre-Jean De Smet ‚Äì A fellow Missionary, De Smet acquainted Rundle in autumn of 1845 at Rocky Mountain House. Though De Smet was Catholic and Rundle was a Methodist Protestant, the two managed to debate theology in a cordial manner despite the sometimes-contentious divisions of the Christian schism. This is especially remarkable considering Rundle's personal wariness of Catholic missionaries. Missionary work Initially optimistic about his work in the District, Rundle was slowly demoralized on several fronts. The religious denomination most prevalent in Fort Edmonton was Catholic, thus few people attended Rundle's Protestant services. Within the Fort, Rundle often attempted, with limited success, to teach the labourer's children about the gospel. He held services throughout the week, especially on the Christian Sabbath (Sunday), which would often include a Cree service. Rundle urged that no work be done in observance of the Sabbath, and himself avoided travel on that day; in this, Rundle had John Rowand's support, but some of the workers were too used to their routines to pay the missionary any mind. Rundle often wintered at the Fort, and visited with the natives through the spring and summer to preach the gospel, and educate them in the Cree syllabics invented by his Wesleyan missionary colleague, Reverend James Evans. In this way, Rundle became extremely well- travelled, having gone the distance between the HBC's larger trading posts in what is present-day Alberta, and having sought out the natives who lived in the country along the way. In 1843, the Hudson's Bay Company erected a small chapel which Rundle boasted could seat 100 people. Described by Rundle in a letter home, the structure served not only as a Chapel, but had a small lodging for Rundle including a study space. Health issues Possibly due to his constant and laborious travel, Robert Rundle was prone to recurrent headaches and a bleeding nose. Rundle persevered for eight years in Rupert's Land until he suffered a more serious injury from a horse-riding accident ‚Äì a fractured wrist ‚Äì in July 1847. Even after 12 months Rundle's injury did not heal properly, rendering his left hand essentially useless. Rundle decided to return home to seek treatment; he reached England in September 1848. While he had intended to go back to Rupert's Land, he never did again. Later years Return to England After regaining his health, Rundle was prepared to do missionary service abroad again. He was evidently offered a missionary post in Australia;Rundle, R: \\"The Rundle Journals\\", lxiii. Glenbow Institute, 1977 however, his plans changed when he married a woman named Mary Wolverson in 1854, and he stayed in England. Robert and Mary had nine children, though only four of them survived to maturity: Martha Anne, Rupert, Mary Grace and Sarah Alice. Rundle continued to serve as a minister in England until his retirement. He died on 4 February 1896, in Garstang, Lancashire. His epitaph is located in Blackburn, Lancashire, at the Whalley New Road Cemetery.Searching for Robert Rundle Legacy Rundle's Mission In 1847, Reverend Rundle received permission to create a mission site at Pigeon Lake. After Rundle's permanent departure to England the following year, his follower Benjamin Sinclair attempted to keep the Methodist church alive. Sinclair oversaw the construction of mission buildings at the behest of Rundle in 1848, and was left in charge in the missionary's absence. The mission served the Cree, Stoney, and Blackfoot peoples, instructing them not only in Christianity, but in reading and writing in syllabics, and growing crops.http://www.abertasource.ca/methodist/The_Missions/Pigeon_Lake_Establishment.htm Unsupported, Sinclair abandoned the mission in 1851 and continued his work elsewhere; the structures were inhabited again by Rundle's Methodist successors, Rev. Thomas Woolsey and Henry Steinhauer from 1856‚Äì8.http://www.abertasource.ca/methodist/Own_Voices/T_W_Mission_Work.htm Woolsey found the area was prone to a poor growing season to due a colder climate, had poor soil conditions, and due to a shrinking Bison population, there was violence amongst the native tribes in the area who relied on it for food. Thus, Woolsey eventually opened a new mission near Smoky Lake in 1861. Sinclair and Woolsey maintained Rundle's remaining followers, and the Methodist church in central Alberta survived and grew into the 20th century. Eventually the Methodists joined with the Presbyterians and Congregationalists to form the United Church of Canada in 1925. Incidentally, Woolsey later married Rundle's sister-in-law, Sarah Wolverson.Thomas Woolsey The Rundle Mission site was declared a National Historic Monument in 1965, and the site, its buildings and cemetery were designated a Provincial Historic Site in 1997. Though the original buildings no longer survive, there is a retreat house present. Journal and registries Robert Rundle documented his work in Rupert's Land in his journals. Included in this are two sets of registers: one set documenting hundreds of baptisms and dozens of weddings all performed by Rev. Rundle. Each ledger typically notes the first and last names of the persons involved (including parents of children for the baptisms), the age of the child (for baptisms), the date of the ceremony, and the precise location when applicable (although occasionally he broadly refers to the location as \\"Saskatchewan District\\" when the ceremony was performed away from a Hudson's Bay Company post or body of water). Additionally, Rundle kept an anecdotal record in his journal, shedding light on his experience as a missionary and a Christian, and on life within Hudson's Bay Company posts.

She also wrote under the pseudonym Helen Zenna Smith. She is now best remembered for her World War I novel Not So Quiet (published in America as Stepdaughters of War) which adapts the style of Erich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front to depict the experiences of British female ambulance drivers. During her lifetime she was known for her many romance novels, some of which were serialised in national newspapers, as well as for her children's books starring the popular character Jane Turpin. In the nineteen-fifties, she became a regular performer on television, as a storyteller and as an astrologer. For twenty-five years she published a monthly astrology column in SHE magazine. Biography Early years and first marriage Evadne Price's own account of her early life is full of contradictions. There is considerable evidence that she was born Eva Grace Price on 28 August 1888 in Merewether, New South Wales, Australia (NSW Registry of BDM cert. no. 1888/032162). In \\"SHE Stargazes\\" Evadne gives her birth date as 28 August (p. 82). Evadne's claim to have British parents is also unreliable, as BDM records show that they were both born in NSW, Australia. Her father, Jonathan Dixon Price, was a miner. He died in 1921, not, as Evadne claimed, during her teens. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography follows the Times obituaristThe Times (London, England), Friday, 19 Apr 1985; p. 14. in accepting her own claim that she was born at sea in 1896The Sunday Post, Lanarkshire, 7 March 1920 p.11 includes her claim to have been born on an ocean liner. but there is no birth certificate to support this, and she can not be found in the 1901 or 1911 British census listings. The article \\"Newcastle Girl is Film Writer\\" (Newcastle Morning Herald, 20 June 1939, p. 6) reports that Evadne Price/Helen Zenna Smith was born in Merewether and attended the Junction School in Merewether. In July 1902 Eva Price obtained a bursary at the Maitland High School and in 1903 she attended the Largs Public School near Maitland. She performed in the end-of-year school concerts at these establishments, giving recitations (as reported in the Maitland Daily Mercury). In her late teens Eva Price was familiar to Newcastle audiences as an elocutionist. In 1908 Eva Price played the First Twin in Australia's first production of \\"Peter Pan\\". On her 21st birthday, 28 August 1909, Eva Grace Price, actress, daughter of Jonathan Dixon Price, married a German-born actor Henry A. Dabelstein in Sydney (NSW Registry of BDM cert. no. 1909/007059). Henry used the stage name Harry Preston. Moving to England and second marriage In 1910 Price left Australia for London. Unable to find work there she went on to New York where she found a job in a burlesque variety show. She returned to the UK in 1912 and began to secure parts in provincial tours of dramatic productions: The Girl Who Knew A Bit (1912), Mr Wu (1914), Oh I Say (1915), Within The Law (1916).The Stage 13 Apr 1916) In 1915 she changed \\"Eva\\" to the more evocative \\"Evadne\\" (Dumfries & Galloway Standard, 25 August 1915 p. 3) and invented a new persona for herself, claiming to have been born at sea of British parents and considerably understating her age. In 1920, Price married Charles A. Fletcher, a soldier. There was no mention of any previous marriage on the GRO entry form. Her second husband was a Captain in the 3rd Devonshire Regiment; he died in the Sudan in 1924. When her stage career ended in 1923 Price turned to journalism.  Third marriage and World War II  In 1939 Evadne Fletcher married the Australian writer, Kenneth Andrew Attiwill alias Ken Attiwill (1906-1992) in Kent, England. The couple co-wrote a number of books and plays. They also later wrote scripts for the British television soap-opera Crossroads.Interview with Ken Attiwill, National Library of Australia (sound recording) She was the war correspondent for The People from 1943, covering the Allied invasion of Europe and many major war stories, including the Nuremberg Trials. She was the first woman journalist to enter the Belsen concentration camp. Her husband, was a prisoner of war in Japan, and was presumed dead for two years.  Writing career  As a journalist, Evadne wrote a column for the Sunday Chronicle and contributed to other newspapers. She also began contributing short stories to the fiction magazines of the period. Many of these are comic, and her most notable successes were the Jane Turpin stories, about a female equivalent of Richmal Crompton's William. These were published in the Novel magazine from 1928, and then in books, beginning with Just Jane (1928). There were ten collections of Jane stories, finishing with Jane at War (1947). Price, however, did not take kindly to Jane stories being referred to as a copy of the William series. She went on record saying she \\"had never heard of William\\", even though William stories were regularly advertised on Jane book dust jackets. The famous illustrator Thomas Henry illustrated both Jane and William books, but signed the illustrations for the Jane books as \\"Marriott\\", to distinguish the two series. Helen Zenna Smith In 1930, Albert E. Marriott, who had recently started a publishing company, asked Evadne Price, who was known for her skill at pastiche, to write a parodic version of Erich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front, featuring women at war; his suggested title was All Quaint on the Western Front. By her own account she took Remarque's book home to read and decided: 'Anyone who wants a skit on this book wants their brains dusted.'. She told him that he should publish an authentic account of women at war, and he asked her to write it, despite her protests that she was too young to know anything about the war. He offered her ¬£50 if she could bring him 20,000 words by Monday morning. Through an acquaintance she met Winifred Constance Young, who had been a wartime ambulance driver. Young lent Price her wartime diary, and the 20,000 words were written in less than forty-eight hours. Price recounts that Marriott was so delighted with her work that he immediately took the carbon copy to the News of the World, who paid him ¬£5000. It is likely that in making this deal he represented the writing as a first-hand account rather than a piece of historical fiction. If there was dishonesty or misrepresentation, there is no direct proof that Evadne Price was actively complicit in it; late in life, in an interview, she presented herself as a complete innocent manipulated by Marriott.Evadne Price interviewed by Hazel de Berg The book Not So Quiet... was published as by Helen Zenna Smith, which was also the name of its central character. The book's jacket presents it as: 'An honest, unsentimental, savage record of a girl ambulance driver in France.' and claims: 'This is not a story.' These claims for authenticity persuaded reviewers to treat the book as a record of the author's own experience. The Manchester Guardian critic wrote: 'The author was attached to a convoy under the command of a domineering and heartless commandant, where the drivers suffered every discomfort of bad food, lack of sleep, dirt and petty tyranny.'Manchester Guardian (24 April 1930) The book was an immediate success, and Marriott employed young women to drive around London in ambulances to publicise it. It was translated into French as Pas Si Calme and published by Gallimard, Paris in 1931. It was translated into Spanish as Hay novedad en el frente...: (Hijastras de Guerra), in 1935. In the Netherlands it and two sequels were translated as a trilogy: Gij vrouwen....!, Vrouwen in nood and Vrouwenroeping. In Germany she was compared to Adrienne Thomas, whose book, Katrin becomes a soldier was published in 1930. Shortly after the publication of Not So Quiet..., according to Evadne Price's later account, the publisher Albert E. Marriott committed fraud by forging a letter on Buckingham Palace notepaper claiming to have the rights to Queen Mary's memoirs. He sold these to the Daily Mail for a considerable advance, and then absconded. According to her own account, it was only at this time that she discovered that 'Albert E. Marriott' was a pseudonym of Netley Lucas, a career criminal. Marriott/Lucas became bankrupt, but because he had paid her nothing, Price's copyrights did not go to his creditors. They remained her property, and Not So Quiet... was republished by Newnes, in a format that presented it as more obviously fictional. Four sequels to Not So Quiet were also published by Newnes. These were: Women of the Aftermath (1931); Shadow Women (1932); Luxury Ladies (1933); and They Lived With Me (1934). These books are written in the same dramatic style as Not So Quiet..., and take the same heroine into the challenges of the 1920s. They touch on such social issues as the care of the war-wounded; post-war decadence; eugenics; and the fate of destitute women in London. Romance novel author Under her own name, Evadne Price was a successful romance novelist. She wrote over 150 paperback novelettes for cheaply produced series such as The Lucky Star Library, The Glamour Library and The Silver Star Library, as well as longer romance novels that were published in hardback. She was a vice-president of the Romantic Novelists' Association. Playwright and screenwriter Price's career as a romance novelist took her into playwriting, radio scriptwriting and screenwriting. Her play Big Ben, written for the Malvern Festival in 1939, was a successful one (The Times called it \\"a large, comfortable play with a soul to call its own\\"). The Phantom Light (1937) was a stage version of her novel, The Haunted Light. The play was also made into a film starring Gordon Harker. Once a Crook (1939) - a play which was co-written by Price and her husband Ken Attiwill, was filmed in 1941. She also acted in the movie Trouble with Junia (1967) in the minor part of Miss Hallyday, beside her husband Ken Attiwill. In 1965, she and Ken Attiwill joined the scriptwriting team of the ATV soap opera CrossroadsThe Stage 7 October 1965 Astrology Evadne Price had a parallel career as a broadcaster during the early years of British television. Her afternoon horoscope show called \\"Fun with the Stars\\" led to regular appearances on the lunchtime chat and music show Lunchbox, with Noele Gordon. Price was dubbed the \\"new astrologer extraordinaire\\" for twenty-five years for the SHE magazine and published a successful collection of these columns as SHE Stargazes. When she and her husband retired to their native Australia in 1976, Evadne Price wrote the monthly horoscope column for Australian Vogue. She also appeared weekly on the ITV Central evening news magazine show with a 5-minute astrological reading, and she would always close with the catchphrase \\"think lucky and you'll be lucky\\". Final years Evadne Price died on 17 April 1985 in Sydney, Australia, aged 96. Evadne Price has an unfinished autobiography which was to have been named Mother Painted Nude. Posthumous reputation In the year of Price's death, a selection of the Jane Turpin stories was published as Jane and Co, with an introduction by Mary Cadogan (London: Macmillan, 1985). In 1989, Not So Quiet... was republished to acclaim by The Feminist Press, New York, and later by Virago in the UK. The Feminist Press edition included a discursive afterword by Jane Marcus, which explained much of the story of the book's origins, but the back cover describes it as 'a scathing firsthand account of war from the point of view of women actively engaged in it', which may have allowed some readers to overestimate its authenticity. Since then there have been notable critical accounts of the novel by Angela K. Smith in The Second Battlefield: Women, Modernism and the First World War,Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2000 and by Alison Hennegan in 'Fighting the peace: Two women's accounts of the post-war years', an essay included in The Silent Morning: Culture and Memory After the Armistice, a collection edited by Trudi Tate and Kate Kennedy.Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2013 Bibliography As Evadne Price Jane Series :NB: All \\"Jane\\" books were published by Robert Hale, London unless otherwise mentioned # Just Jane, John Hamilton, London (1928) # Meet Jane, Albert E.

His genealogy is obscure, but he was probably a son of Sancho II S√°nchez. There is much confusion among the sources about the identity of Sancho Mitarra. Some give that sobriquet to Sancho II, while some give it to Sancho III. Some call the latter Mitarra Sancho and call him a son of the former. It seems likely that these two Sanchos are related. Genealogies of a \\"phantasmagorical\\" character assign to him a Castilian parentage.Higounet, p 44.

Distribution The plant is primarily native to the Southwestern United States and Northern Mexico. Its range extends on the northeast through Texas and into southern Kansas, and west to southern California. It can be part of the Mesquite Bosque plant association community in the Sonoran Desert ecoregion of California and Arizona (U.S.), and Sonora state (M√©xico). Description Seedpods Prosopis glandulosa has rounded big and floppy, drooping branches with feathery foliage and straight, paired spines on twigs. This tree normally reaches , but can grow as tall as . It is considered to have a medium growth rate. It flowers from March to November, with pale, yellow, elongated spikes and bears straight, yellow seedpods. The seeds are eaten by a variety of animals, such as scaled quail. Other animals, including deer, collared peccaries, coyotes, and jackrabbits, feed on both pods and vegetation. Varieties * Prosopis glandulosa var. glandulosa (syn. Prosopis chilensis var. glandulosa (Torr.) Standl., Prosopis juliflora var. glandulosa (Torr.) Cockerell) * Prosopis glandulosa var. torreyana (L.D.Benson) M.C.Johnst. (syn. Prosopis juliflora var. torreyana L.D.Benson) Invasive species Prosopis glandulosa has been intentionally introduced into at least a half-dozen countries, including Australia, Botswana, Namibia and South Africa. The IUCN considers it as one of the world's 100 worst invasive species outside its native habitat range. The seeds are disseminated by livestock that graze on the sweet pods, and the shrubs can invade grasslands, with cattlemen regarding mesquites as range weeds to be eradicated.NPIN Database: Prosopis glandulosa Due to latent buds underground, only coppicing them makes permanent removal difficult. A single-trunked tree that is cut down will soon be replaced by a multi-trunked version. Uses Prosopis glandulosa shrubs and trees provide shelter and nest building material for wildlife, and produce seed pods in abundance containing beans that are a seasonal food for diverse birds and small mammal species. As the common name indicates, honey mesquite is a honey plant that supports native pollinator species of bees and other insects, and cultivated honey bees. It is a larval host for the long-tailed skipper and Reakirt's blue butterflies. Mesquite flour contains abundant protein and carbohydrates, and can be used in recipes as a substitute for wheat flour. In Namibia, although an invasive species, it has qualities that have made it useful for humans, including: growing extremely rapidly there, having very dense shade, abundantly producing seed pods, and a readily available firewood. Indigenous peoples The indigenous peoples of California and southwestern North America used parts of Prosopis glandulosa as a medicinal plant, food source, building and tools material, and fuel. The Cahuilla ate the blossoms and pods, which were ground into meal for cake. The thorns of the plant were used as tattoo needles, and the ashes for tattoos, by the Cahuilla and Serrano Indians of Southern California.Marsh Trail Guide, Big Morongo Canyon Preserve Its dense and durable wood is prized for making tools and arrow points, and for the unique flavor it lends to foods cooked over it. The deep taproots, often larger than the trunks, are dug up for firewood. This species of mesquite, known as haas (pronounced ) by the Seri people of northwestern Mexico, was very important for food and nonfood uses. The Seris had specific names for various stages of the growth of the mesquite pod. Historically, it was a very important wild food plant because it fruits even during drought years.

Its estimated population in 2006 is 46,439. The municipality was created on June 5, 1892, and incorporated July 18, 1892. The name 'Beberibe' means \\"where the sugar cane grows\\". Geography The headquarters of the municipality are located in the town of Beberibe, which is situated about 80 km SE of Fortaleza, the state capital of Cear√°. Near the town of Beberibe, and extending south-east along the coastline, are many magnificent beaches, popular with tourists. Sports such as kitesurfing are also popular at many of these beaches. The Beberibe Cliffs Natural Monument was instituted in 2004 to protect the sea cliffs of Beberibe, which at that time were being visited by 400 people per day. The designation protects the cliffs from damage, and allows visitors to access them only with authorized guides. The municipality contains the Prainha do Canto Verde Extractive Reserve, created in 2009 to protect a fishing community after a lengthy struggle against real estate speculators. The municipality is divided into several rural districts, aside from the municipal seat of the township of Beberibe. The districts are Parajuru, Paripueira, Itapeim, Sucatinga, and Serra do F√©lix. The districts are named after the major towns in them. History The first register of Beberibe was in 1691, when a small cluster of buildings were built on the \\"sesmaria\\" given to Manuel Nogueira Cardoso, Sebasti√£o Dias Freire, Jo√£o Carvalho N√≥brega and Capit√£o Domingos Ferreira Chaves. But it was not until the start of the 19th century that the village became occupied, when Baltazar Ferreira do Vale, a resident of Riacho Fundo, in Cascavel, and Pedro Queiroz Lima, a resident from the farm of Mirador, in Aquiraz, bought farms there. The farm of Baltazar was suitable for population, and the town of Beberibe developed from there. The area around Beberibe was originally named Uruanda by the native peoples of Brazil, and Beberibe was the name of the plot of land owned by Brasiliano Ferreira de Ara√∫jo, which is currently the site of the city's municipal headquarters. Brasiliano donated some of this land for the construction of the local church, which encouraged rapid growth of the town. The church was inaugurated in 1875, by which time the town was widely known as Beberibe. The Municipality of Beberibe was created in 1892, and fell in the judicial district of Cascavel. However, the status of Beberibe as a Municipality or a District continually changed up until 1951, when, petitioned by Appeals Court judge Boanerges Fac√≥, the governor Raul Barbosa passed a law establishing Beberibe as a municipality, and the autonomy which came with such a designation. It was not until 1955, however, that the Municipality was officially installed. Beberibe, as its name origin may suggest, experienced rapid economic growth as a result of the construction of numerous sugar mills in the region. The wealth which was produced by the rapadura industry led to the city being nicknamed \\"Vila Rica\\" (Rich Town). Many mills have now gone bankrupt, and the rapadura industry declined, so the name no longer applies.

In visual arts and particularly cinematography, framing is the presentation of visual elements in an image, especially the placement of the subject in relation to other objects. Framing can make an image more aesthetically pleasing and keep the viewer's focus on the framed object(s). It can also be used as a repoussoir, to direct attention back into the scene. It can add depth to an image, and can add interest to the picture when the frame is thematically related to the object being framed. Purpose The goal is often to focus the viewer's attention upon the subject, but the ends and means are ultimately at the discretion of the artist. It is accomplished by manipulating the viewpoint of the image, rather than the object(s) within. Framing, especially in the photographic arts, is primarily concerned with the position and perspective of the viewer. The position of the observer has tremendous impact on their perception of the main subject, both in terms of aesthetics and in their interpretation of its meaning. For example, if the viewer was placed very far away from a lone subject in an image, the viewer will gather more information about the subjects' surroundings and bearing, but very little in terms of emotions. If the setting was in the middle of flat plain, the viewer might perceive a sense of loneliness or that the subject is lost, because the viewer himself cannot find any visual cues to orient the location of the subject. If some foreground elements are put in front of the viewer, partially obscuring the subject, the viewer would take the position of an unseen observer. Especially if the artist chooses to hint malicious intent, a member of the audience might feel uncomfortable looking through the eyes of a stalker. Factors determining frame *Repoussoir ‚Äì Foreground elements placed along the sides of the frame to lead the viewer's eye onto the subject. Can be used to create a more closed and stable space in the frame. * Depth of field (DoF) ‚Äì The distance between the nearest and furthest points in which an object will be in focus. A longer distance means the DoF is deeper, and a shorter distance means the DoF is shallower. This selective focus technique allows the artist to directly control which areas of the frame the viewer should be focused on. * White space ‚Äì Negative space used in framing to increase aesthetic appeal. This principle of design allows a balance in the frame to positive space. The empty area can form contrasting silhouettes with the subject and thus become a meaningful aspect of the frame; however, negative space is used mostly as a neutral or complementary background in order to draw focus upon the central subject. * Vignetting ‚Äì A naturally occurring optical phenomenon where the brightness or saturation is reduced at the periphery of an image. Can be produced mechanically or digitally to bring focus to the well-lit and saturated areas of the image, known as the \\"hotspot\\" effect. * Perspective distortion ‚Äì An optical technique where lenses of different focal lengths are used to affect the perceived distance between the foreground and background. Wider lenses extend the distance and show more of the background, which can be used to reveal a detailed view of the subject and its immediate surroundings in the same frame. Longer lenses compress the distance; because it can minimize the perception of space within the frame, it can be used on buildings and cars to create a scene of congestion. * Color and lighting References Category:Photographic techniques Category:Composition in visual art ","title":"Framing (visual arts)"},{"id":"7131118","text":"Stadion Zlatica is a football stadium in Zlatica, a suburb of Podgorica Capital, Montenegro.

This commonly applies to telecommunication, computer networks, and computer hardware. In particular, Ethernet operations, administration and maintenance (EOAM) is the protocol for installing, monitoring and troubleshooting Ethernet metropolitan area network (MANs) and Ethernet WANs. It relies on a new, optional sublayer in the data link layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. The OAM features covered by this protocol are discovery, link monitoring, remote fault detection, remote loopback  Standards  * Fault management and performance monitoring (ITU-T Y.1731Operators Given Performance Management For Ethernet With New Standard ) - Defines performance monitoring measurements such as frame loss ratio, frame delay and frame delay variation to assist with SLA assurance and capacity planning. For fault management the standard defines continuity checks, loopbacks, link trace and alarm suppression (AIS, RDI) for effective fault detection, verification, isolation and notification in carrier networks. * Connectivity fault management (IEEE 802.1ag802.1ag - Connectivity Fault Management) - Defines standardized continuity checks, loopbacks and link trace for fault management capabilities in enterprise and carrier networks. This standard also partitions the network into 8 hierarchical administrative domains. * Link layer discovery (IEEE 802.1ab) - Defines discovery for all Provider Edges (PEs) supporting a common service instance and/or discovery for all edge devices and P Routers) common to a single network domain. * Ethernet in the First Mile defined in IEEE 802.3ahIEEE 802.3ah EFM Standard Ratified mechanisms for monitoring and troubleshooting Ethernet access links.

OAMP OAMP, traditionally OAM&P;, stands for operations, administration, maintenance, and provisioning. The addition of 'T' in recent years stands for troubleshooting, and reflects its use in network operations environments. The term is used to describe the collection of disciplines generally, as well as whatever specific software package(s) or functionality a given company uses to track these things. Though the term, and the concept, originated in the wired telephony world, the discipline (if not the term) has expanded to other spheres in which the same sorts of work are done, including cable television and many aspects of Internet service and network operation. 'Ethernet OAM' is another recent concept in which the terminology is used. Operations encompass automatic monitoring of environment, detecting and determining faults and alerting admins. Administration typically involves collecting performance stats, accounting data for the purpose of billing, capacity planning using Usage data and maintaining system reliability. It can also involve maintaining the service databases which are used to determine periodic billing. Maintenance involves upgrades, fixes, new feature enablement, backup and restore and monitoring the media health. The major task is Diagnostics and troubleshooting. Provisioning is the setting up of the user accounts, devices and services. Although they both target the same set of market, OAMP covers much more than the five specific areas targeted by FCAPS (See FCAPS for more details; it is a terminology that has been more popular than OAMP in non- telecom environs in the past). In NOC environments, OAMP and OAMPT are used to describe problem management life cycle more and more - and especially with the dawn of Carrier-Grade Ethernet, telco terminology is becoming more and more embedded in traditionally IP termed worlds. O - Operations A - Administration M - Maintenance P - Provisioning T - Troubleshooting  Procedures  Operational Basically, these are the procedures you use during normal network operations. They are day to day organisational procedures: handover, escalation, major issue management, call out, support procedures, regular updates including emails and meetings. In this section group you will find things like: Daily Checklists, On-call and Shift rotas, Call response and ticket opening procedures, Manufacturer documentation like technical specifications and operator handbooks, OOB Procedures Administration These are support procedures that are necessary for day-to-day operations - things like common passwords, equipment and tools access, organisational forms and timesheets, meetings minutes and agendas, and customer Service Reports. This is not necessarily 'network admin', but also 'network operations admin'. Maintenance Tasks that if not done will affect service or system operation, but are not necessarily as a result of a failure. Configuration and hardware changes that are a response of system deterioration. These involve scheduling provider maintenance, standard network equipment configuration changes as a result of policy or design, routine equipment checks, hardware changes and software/firmware upgrades. Maintenance tasks can also involve the removal of administrative privileges as a security policy. Provisioning Introducing a new service, creating new circuits and setting up new equipment, installing new hardware. Provisioning processes will normally include 'how to' guides and checklists that need to be strictly adhered to and signed off. They can also involve integration and commissioning process which will involve sign-off to other parts of the business life cycle. Troubleshooting Troubleshooting is carried out as a result of a fault or failure, may result in maintenance procedures, or emergency workarounds until such time as a maintenance procedure can be carried out. Troubleshooting procedures will involve knowledge databases, guides and process to cover the role of network operations engineers from initial diagnostics to advanced troubleshooting. This stage often involves problem simulation, and is the traditional interface to design.

They play in the second division of Nigerian football, the Nigeria National League. Their home games are played at the Yenagoa Township Stadium. 2008/09 season Due to torrential rains making the pitch unplayable, they played the 2007‚Äì2008 season in the Delta State town of Oghara. During the 2008‚Äì09 season, Bayelsa was forced to play three home games in Ibadan after crowd trouble in their derby with Ocean Boys. Then at the new year's break the team was suspended from continuing their league schedule despite being at the top of the table. This was due to outstanding debts and salaries. In a surprising move, the team sacked technical adviser Miekeme Fekete right as the squad was traveling to Brazzaville to play in the CAF Confederation Cup. They won the Nigerian Premier League for the first time after a 2‚Äì2 draw at Warri Wolves F.C. on June 14, qualifying them for the 2010 CAF Champions League. The celebration was dampened however when captain Abel Tador was killed by robbers hours after the game. 2009/10 season In January 2010, the Bayelsa State government said they were looking for private sponsorship to take over the team. They were relegated at the end of the season by one point after losing three of their last four games and being banished to play home games in Kano. They protested the relegation, claiming three points should have been awarded from an abandoned game in Bauchi when home team Wikki Tourists left the pitch. After months of court action (and the temporary expansion of the league to 24 teams), their relegation was confirmed in September 2010. 2011 season Financial problems plagued Bayelsa's return to the second division. They let many players leave on free transfers at the start of the season due to non- payment of salaries. In May 2011, they boycotted their state FA cup final and had a protest at the Bayelsa State government building because of non-payment, in some cases going back two years to their league title. At the time, they were at the top of the table in the National League Division 1-B. 2012 season They won their nine-team division to win promotion back to the Premier League and placed second to rivals Nembe City F.C. in the Nigerian National League Super Four tournament.

Before his arrest, he was an honorary member of the Romanian Academy. Born in Tritenii de Jos, Transylvania (inside the Hungarian Kingdom in Austria-Hungary at the time), Ha≈£ieganu studied and practiced Law. He became a professor at the University of Cluj, and served as its rector in 1929‚Äì1930.≈¢iu Following World War I and the Aster Revolution in Hungary, he was present with PNR leaders at the Alba Iulia assembly that called for union with Romania, and served on the Directory Council designated by the participants. A Minister of Labour and Social Security in the Iuliu Maniu cabinets in Bucharest, he was kept in the Gheorghe Mironescu one (that brought about the return of Carol II as King of Romania); he also held the office of Minister of State for Transylvania. In 1940, he became noted for his vocal protest against the cession of Northern Transylvania to Hungary (the signing of the Second Vienna Award).≈¢iu Retreated from political life during World War II, he returned to the forefront of illegal opposition before the fall of the Ion Antonescu pro-Nazi dictatorship (see Romania during World War II).

This image shows a cross-section of the vascular tissue in a plant stem. Bright-field microscopy is the simplest of all the optical microscopy illumination techniques. Sample illumination is transmitted (i.e., illuminated from below and observed from above) white light, and contrast in the sample is caused by attenuation of the transmitted light in dense areas of the sample. Bright-field microscopy is the simplest of a range of techniques used for illumination of samples in light microscopes, and its simplicity makes it a popular technique. The typical appearance of a bright-field microscopy image is a dark sample on a bright background, hence the name. Light path The light path of a bright-field microscope is extremely simple, no additional components are required beyond the normal light-microscope setup. The light path therefore consists of: * a transillumination light source, commonly a halogen lamp in the microscope stand; * a condenser lens, which focuses light from the light source onto the sample; * an objective lens, which collects light from the sample and magnifies the image; * oculars and/or a camera to view the sample image. Bright-field microscopy may use critical or K√∂hler illumination to illuminate the sample. Performance Bright-field microscopy typically has low contrast with most biological samples, as few absorb light to a great extent. Staining is often required to increase contrast, which prevents use on live cells in many situations. Bright-field illumination is useful for samples that have an intrinsic color, for example chloroplasts in plant cells. Image:Paper_Micrograph_Bright.png|Bright-field illumination, sample contrast comes from absorbance of light in the sample Image:Paper_Micrograph_Cross- Polarised.png|Cross-polarized light illumination, sample contrast comes from the rotation of polarized light through the sample Image:Paper_Micrograph_Dark.png|Dark-field illumination, sample contrast comes from light scattered by the sample Image:Paper_Micrograph_Phase.png|Phase- contrast illumination, sample contrast comes from interference of different path lengths of light through the sample Bright-field microscopy is a standard light-microscopy technique, and therefore magnification is limited by the resolving power possible with the wavelength of visible light. Advantages * Simplicity of setup with only basic equipment required. * Living cells can be seen with bright-field microscopes. Limitations * Very low contrast of most biological samples. * The practical limit to magnification with a light microscope is around 1300X. Although higher magnifications are possible, it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain image clarity as the magnification increases. * Low apparent optical resolution due to the blur of out-of-focus material. * Samples that are naturally colorless and transparent cannot be seen well, e.g. many types of mammalian cells. These samples often have to be stained before viewing. Samples that do have their own color can be seen without preparation, e.g. the observation of cytoplasmic streaming in Chara cells. Enhancements * Reducing or increasing the amount of the light source by the iris diaphragm. * Use of an oil-immersion objective lens and a special immersion oil placed on a glass cover over the specimen. Immersion oil has the same refraction as glass and improves the resolution of the observed specimen. * Use of sample-staining methods for use in microbiology, such as simple stains (methylene blue, safranin, crystal violet) and differential stains (negative stains, flagellar stains, endospore stains). * Use of a colored (usually blue) or polarizing filter on the light source to highlight features not visible under white light. The use of filters is especially useful with mineral samples.

It is a mottled texture, more intense than a simple flat finish, but less intense than orange peel, or popcorn, texture. Heavy knockdown applied with a spray hopper.

He was propelled to leave Ayodhya after he fell in love with a simple village girl, Kajolie. Bahuka's adopted father King Shava did not approve of the match. In the east, he met three wise women. One of the dark haired women said that she came from Bamyian and she knew the secret to life was to realize the stupidity of human beings. The second woman from Sichuan preached that everything exists through exclusion of everything else. The third woman from Dravida was quiet and said nothing. Bahuka understood the meaning of enlightenment and kept these words of wisdom near his heart. On his eastward journey, he entered the village of Tripura where he met the village leader Chameli who gave Bahuka magic beans (in some accounts he received magic sweets) with the power to summon the blue spirit Jaduu. Jaduu grants Bahuku with gifts of wisdom and dance. Bahuka is also another name of King Bahu. In literature Gujarati poet Chinu Modi has written a long narrative poem entitled Bahuk on the character.

Roche was born to a middle-class family in Dublin in 1729 and received a gentleman's education, he was in fact so well turned out that his comportment sufficiently impressed the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland to offer him a military commission at sixteen years' old. Roche had fallen in with bad company and was possibly involved in an attack on a night watchman, one of many carried out by gangs of bucks at the time. He fled to North America where he volunteered during the French and Indian War. There his bravery and intrepidity impressed and he quickly rose to a high rank; until accused of theft from a fellow officer. Roche always denied the allegation, stating he had bought the gun in question, but according to the corporal from whom he claimed to have done so, Roche himself had stolen it. Roche was convicted and disgraced by Court Martial. Roche later attacked several people involved in the case, including the Corporal, after which he earned the nickname \\"Tiger\\". He continued to fight with distinction in the war, and then with money from friends in Ireland, sailed for England where he hoped to buy a commission in the army. However the stain of his conviction followed him, and the other officers refused to serve with him, until the dying Corporal confessed that he had in fact stolen the gun. Roche was vindicated overnight and returned to Dublin a hero, where he was offered a Lieutenancy in a new regiment. His status was further boosted after he raised a unit to patrol the streets at night against a particularly vicious brand of criminals active at the time. After the Treaty of Paris in 1763 Roche was forced to retire from the army and move to London, where he married the wealthy Miss Pitt, but later squandered her money and she divorced him. Roche ended the affair in debtors' prison, until his own inheritance freed him. Roche idled along in London until friends asked him to stand for Parliament, though he declined the offer. In 1773, though, he accepted a captaincy in an infantry regiment and sailed for India. There were disagreements aboard the ship and Roche fell out with the Captain and other gentlemen aboard. When they landed at the Cape of Good Hope Roche called on Captain Ferguson's house, who was later found dead behind it. Roche fled, but was caught, tried and acquitted by the Dutch. He continued to Bombay where the British arrested him; he opposed the legal grounds of his trial, but he was returned to London to stand trial in the Old Bailey in December 1774. He was again acquitted. The case is the last trace Roche left. He appeared as the hero in a play by John MasefieldThe Locked Chest [and] The Sweeps of '98, The Macmillan Company, New York, 1916 and may have been the model for William Makepeace Thackeray's Barry Lyndon. Early life David Roche was born, either the first or second of three sons, to Jordan Roche and Ellen White in Dublin, Ireland in 1729. His younger brother was Sir Boyle Roche, the eminent politician. Roche received the best education Dublin could provide, and was instructed in all the accomplishments then deemed essential to the rank and character of a gentleman. So expert was he in the various acquirements of polite life, that at the age of 16 he recommended himself to Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield, then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, who offered him, gratuitously, a commission in the army. However, Roche had fallen in with a disreputable crowd who convinced him to refuse Chesterfield's offer. Further, Roche was present (and probably directly involved) when his associates attacked and killed a watchman. Compelled to leave Dublin, Roche made his way to Cork, and from there to North America. At the outbreak of the French and Indian War, Roche entered as a volunteer in one of the provincial regiments, and distinguished himself in skirmishes against the Indians. Court Martial Roche displayed intrepidity and spirit in his military doings, and was expected to rise to a high rank until an unfortunate event destroyed his career. An officer of Roche's regiment missed a valuable gun, which was later found in Roche's possession. Roche declared that he had bought the gun from a corporal of the regiment named Bourke. Bourke declared on oath that Roche's statement was false, and Roche was brought to a court-martial. Roche was convicted of the theft and ordered to quit the service with \\"every mark of disgrace and ignominy\\". Roche subsequently challenged and attacked a number of the people involved in the incident, including Corporal Bourke. During his fight with Bourke, Roche sank his teeth into Bourke's throat and was pulled away dragging a mouthful of flesh (which he afterwards said was \\"the sweetest morsel he had ever tasted\\"). It was from this fight that he gained the nickname \\"Tiger\\". After this incident, Roche fought as a volunteer in other battles, possibly including the first battle at Fort Ticonderoga. Though he fought well, Roche was not able to escape the stain of the robbery. He made his way to New York and eventually, in 1758, received some money from friends in Ireland and was able to obtain passage on a vessel bound for England. Roche reserved part of his supply of money for the purchase of a regimental commission. Unfortunately, just as the purchase was about to be completed, a report of his theft in America reached the regiment, and the officers refused to serve with him. Roche traced the origin of the report to a Captain Campbell, whom he met and challenged to a duel. Both men were desperately wounded. On other occasions Roche challenged or attacked others connected with the incident, and generally anyone who spread the story. Roche's attacks, though fierce, were not usually successful, and he was seriously wounded on several occasions. Ultimately, redress to his character came accidentally and unexpectedly. Corporal Bourke was mortally wounded by a scalping party of Indians, and on his death-bed made a solemn confession that he himself had actually stolen the gun, and sold it to Roche, and that Roche had purchased it without any suspicion of the theft. This declaration of the dying man was properly attested and universally accepted, and instantly restored Roche's character. A hero in Dublin In compensation for the injustice and injury he had suffered, Roche was awarded a lieutenancy in a newly raised regiment. He returned to Dublin (where the old murder charge had been quietly dropped) a much-celebrated hero. Dublin was at this time infested with criminals known as sweaters or pinkindindies (who cut off the points of their swords because they would rather \\"inflict considerable pain\\" than kill). One evening Roche happened to single-handedly rescue an old gentleman with his son and daughter from a gang of several such attackers. This gave him the idea to form a body, consisting of officers and others of his acquaintance, to patrol Dublin at night, further enhancing his heroic status. Fall and rise in London The peace concluded in 1763 reduced the size of the army, and forced Roche to retire in indigent circumstances to London, where he soon lived beyond his income. In order to repair it, he managed to marry a Miss Pitt, who had a fortune of ¬£4,000 (approximately ¬£100,000 in today's money). Unfortunately, on the anticipation of this fortune, Roche engaged in a series of extravagances that accumulated debts beyond his marriage portion. He was arrested and cast into the King's Bench Prison, where his wife divorced him and where so many detainers were laid upon him so that it seemed unlikely that he would ever go free. However, a legacy left him by a relation enabled him to escape confinement. Roche became a constant frequenter of billiard-tables. One day he was idly pushing balls around a table, and someone complained that while he was not playing himself, he was \\"hindering other gentlemen from their amusement.\\" Roche replied, \\"why, sir, except you and me, and two or three more, there is not a gentleman in the room.\\" A friend afterwards remarked that he had grossly offended a large company, and wondered why none had appeared to resent the affront. \\"Oh!\\" said Roche, \\"there was no fear of that. There was not a thief in the room that did not consider himself one of the two or three gentlemen I excepted.\\" Once again Roche's fortunes improved, and he was called on to stand as candidate to represent Middlesex in Parliament. So high an opinion was entertained of his daring spirit, that it was thought by some of the popular party he might be of use in intimidating Colonel Luttrell, who was the declared opponent of John Wilkes at that election. In April 1769, he was put into nomination at Brentford. Roche disappointed his friends and declined the poll, induced, it was said, by promises of Luttrell's friends to provide for him. Roche's stay in London included at least one duel, and also an attack by two ruffians with pistols in which Roche, armed only with a sword, nevertheless prevailed. Less savoury stories of Roche's attachment, mismanagement and eventual dissipation of a young woman's fortune also survive from this period. A murder in Africa Roche was appointed captain of a company of foot soldiers in the East India Service, and embarked in the Vansittart for India in May 1773. Apparently Roche was in such a temper that he fell out with all the passengers, including a Captain Ferguson, who called him out as soon as they arrived at Madeira. Roche was seized with a sudden and unaccountable fit of terror, and refused to fight. The early arrogance and later cowardice he had displayed revolted the whole body of the passengers, and the captain of the ship expelled him from the table, leaving Roche to join the common sailors and soldiers on board the ship. With these he endeavoured to ingratiate himself by claiming vengeance against every gentleman and officer on board the ship. His threats were particularly directed against Ferguson, whom he considered the origin of the disgrace he suffered. On the arrival of the ship at the Cape of Good Hope, Roche came ashore and was seen near the house where Ferguson lodged. A message was conveyed to Ferguson, who went out, and was found soon afterwards behind the house with nine deep wounds, all on his left side. Suspicion immediately fixed on Roche as the murderer and he fled during the night, taking refuge among the Kaffirs. Roche was tried by the Dutch authorities at the Cape of Good Hope, and acquitted. He then took a passage in a French vessel to Bombay, but the Vansittart had arrived in India before him. Information had been given to the British authorities, charging Roche with Ferguson's murder, and Roche was arrested as soon as he landed. He asked to be discharged, or at least bailed, on the grounds that there was not sufficient evidence against him and that he had been already acquitted. He also argued that as the offence, if any, had been committed outside British dominions, he could only be tried by special commission, and it was uncertain whether the Crown would issue one or not, or when or where it would sit. He argued his own case with the skill of a practised lawyer. The authorities, however, declined either to bail or discharge him, and he was kept in custody until he was sent a prisoner to England, to stand his trial. A charge of murder was brought against him, and a commission was issued to try it. The case came on at the Old Bailey, in London, before Baron Burland, on 11 December 1774. Roche's counsel declined to rely on the former acquittal at the Cape of Good Hope, and the case was again gone through. The fact of the killing was undisputed, but from the peculiar nature of the proceedings, there could not be, as in a common indictment for murder, a conviction for manslaughter; and the judge directed the jury, if they did not believe the killing to be malicious and deliberate, absolutely to acquit the prisoner. The jury brought in a verdict of acquittal. Mysterious end It is not known what happened to Roche next, or where and when his life ended. Somerville-Large claims he returned to India, and lived quietly until his death.

It occurred on the morning of December 10, 1968, in Tokyo, Japan. Half a century later, the case remains unsolved. Robbery Fuch≈´ Prison On the morning of December 10, 1968, four Kokubunji branch employees of the Nihon Shintaku Ginko (bank) transported 294,307,500 yen (about at 1968 exchange rates) in the trunk of a company car. The metal boxes contained bonuses for the employees of Toshiba's Fuchu factory. They were stopped in the street next to Tokyo Fuch≈´ Prison by a young uniformed officer on a police motorcycle. The police officer informed them that their branch manager's house had been blown up, and they had received a warning that dynamite had been planted in the transport car. The four employees exited the vehicle while the officer crawled under the car to locate the bomb. Moments later, the employees noticed smoke and flames under the car as the officer rolled out, shouting that it was about to explode. When the employees retreated to the prison walls, the police officer got into the car and drove away. Investigation The bank employees believed the thief was a police officer, and accepted his story about the bomb because threatening letters had been sent to the bank manager beforehand. The smoke and flames turned out to be the result of a warning flare he had ignited while under the car. At some point, the thief abandoned the bank's car and transferred the metal boxes to another car, stolen beforehand. That car too was abandoned, and the boxes transferred once again to another previously stolen vehicle. There were 120 pieces of evidence left at the scene of the crime, including the \\"police\\" motorcycle, which had been painted white. However, the evidence was primarily common everyday items, scattered on purpose to confuse the police investigation. A 19-year-old man, the son of a police officer, was suspected just after the robbery. He died of potassium cyanide poisoning on December 15, 1968. He had no alibi. However, the money was not found at the time of his death. His death was deemed a suicide and he was considered not guilty, according to official record. A massive police investigation was launched, posting 780,000 montage pictures throughout Japan. The list of suspects included 110,000 names, and 170,000 policemen participated in the investigation ‚Äî the largest investigation in Japanese history. On December 12, 1969, a 26-year-old man was suspected by the Mainichi Shimbun. He was arrested on an unrelated charge, but he had an alibi; the robbery occurred on the day he was taking a proctored examination. As the arrest was made based on false pretenses, the arresting police officer, Mitsuo Muto, was accused of abuse of power. A friend of the 19-year-old suspect was arrested on an unrelated charge on November 15, 1975, just before the statute of limitations. He had a large amount of money and was suspected of the robbery. He was 18 years old when the robbery occurred. The police asked him for an explanation for the large amount of money, but he did not say anything and they were not able to prove that his money had come from the robbery. The statute of limitations The seven-year investigation offered few answers, and in December 1975, the statute of limitations on the crime passed without an arrest. As of 1988, the thief has also been relieved of any civil liabilities, allowing him to tell his story without fear of legal repercussions. He has yet to come forward.

Some of the Fijian cane growers unions are/were provincially based, as indicated by their names: Nadroga Fijian Cane Growers Association in Nadroga-Navosa Province, the Ra Fijian Cane Growers Association in Ra Province, and the Ba Fijian Cane Growers Association in Ba Province. Other regionally based unions include Labasa Kisan Sangh, the Rewa Planters Union, and the Southern Division Kisan Sangh. Other farmers unions were formed to provide leverage to ethnic sections of the community, such as Indians in Fiji and indigenous Fijian people. History The first farmers union in Fiji was the Indian Cane Growers Association, established in 1919. It negotiated with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, the predominant sugar cane plantations and raw sugar production company established in 1880. The 1921 strike by sugar cane farmers was a spontaneous action led by Vashist Muni. Umbrella organisations were formed to present a united front in negotiating with the CSR and later the Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC) (est. 1973). In 1959, the Federation of Cane Growers was formed, and in 1980 the Joint Committee of Cane Growers Associations was formed. Ethnicity and unions The Fijian cane growers unions were ethnically and provincially based as indicated by their names; Nadroga Fijian Cane Growers Association, the Ra Fijian Cane Growers Association, and the Ba Fijian Cane Growers Association. Some unions claimed to be open for everyone but their membership indicated sectional interest. For example, the Maha Sangh had a predominantly South Indian membership, the Vishal Sangh had a predominantly Sikh membership, and the Kisan Sangh had a predominantly North Indian membership. In 1959, when the Federation of Cane Growers was negotiating the new cane contract with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company (CSR), three indigenous Fijian cane farmers unions were set up to send three Fijian delegates to the Federation although ethnic Fijians made up less than 5% of the cane farmers.

Plot summary Gradisil takes place over several generations of the Gyeroffy family, the novel's timeline spanning from 2059 to the first half of the 22nd century, circa 2130. On these generations hang the novel's basic plots - a murder story, a domestic story, a political story and a revenge story. The first involves Klara Gyeroffy and her father, an aeronautics hobbyist, in their establishment of the low Earth orbit settlement of the Uplands. With the advent of more efficient propulsion technology, space travel reaches a new level of attainability, the Uplands phenomenon being a product of direct access, for those wealthy enough, to the lower orbits. The Uplands has no legal or taxation systems, civic obligations, boundaries, politics or treaties. In 2059 Klara's father Mikl√≥s flies Kristin Janzen Kooistra, a tenant who requires a hideaway, for their Upland lodging. Kooistra kills him during docking, it being later revealed that she is a serial killer at large. Klara, orphaned, flees to Jon, a neighbour in Canada, in distress. The pair soon remove Upland and organise a more permanent residence there, with other billionaire eccentrics of the neighbourhood. The next portion of Gradisil is largely an exposition of the environment's domestic capacity, Roberts investigating the challenges and novelties of day-to-day Upland life, the question of zero-g as hindrance and boon, and ever-present logistics issues. Jon and Klara become sexual partners, but she soon tires of him and develops a relationship with Teruo Nakagomi, a shrewd businessman. After falling pregnant by him, Klara returns to Earth to deliver her child. Her daughter, Gradisil, is born in 2063. Gradisil is about Earthbound conflict as well as Upland conflict. United States-EU tensions of the previous century have become critical, with war finally erupting in 2065. Politically, the Uplands is still a non-entity and the pioneers remaining proudly aloof to \\"Downland\\" politics. Klara remains on Earth, supporting Gradisil. In 2081 the first seizure of \\"EU houses\\" by the US takes place in the Uplands. The orbit settlement is now transformed into both a political and military battlefield, with the US anti- Upland and EU pro-Upland, and receives increasing coverage by Earth media over the coming years. Klara is appointed EU envoy to the Uplands in 2075. Two new narrators are introduced: Lieutenant Slater of the United States Upland Corps, providing insights into the exigencies and metamorphoses of that nation's military-industrial complex in the late 21st century; and Paul Caunes, Gradisil's second husband, who would later betray her to US authorities. As the Uplands comes into its own as the first extraterrestrial country in human history, Gradisil consolidates her role of political activism and de facto media ambassador. Many Uplanders later address her as \\"President\\" during her household visits. She is embarked on a campaign to awaken in the rudimentary nation \\"matriotism\\"‚Äîa unique nationalism for a unique entity‚Äîwhich aims to preserve a default peacetime anarchy. In 2091 and 2093 Gradisil's sons, Hope and Solidarity respectively, are born, however Paul Caunes is the biological father of neither. 2099 sees the onset of the US-Upland war. Every logistical aspect of the war has been meticulously designed by the US to fulfil a new legal bureaucratic order (for instance, the war must officially conclude before the turn of the century and take no longer than 72 hours in all), Slater contending that the real war takes place in the courts. Gradisil and her young nation lie under siege for months, their supply lines cut off by USUC forces. All the while she has turned pregnant with her first child to Paul. Knowing that she cannot return to Earth without being captured, she sacrifices the foetus in orbit. Gradisil waits for the opportune moment to launch a kamikaze attack on USUC orbital stations. It proves effective, and shatters the image of US unassailability that the European loss of the \\"war of '81\\" cemented. There occurs a realisation, both Down- and Upland, that the United States can never exercise any meaningful control over the territory. Upon embarking on the victory rounds, Gradisil and her retinue are soon led into a trap, she falling into US custody. The novel leaps forward twenty years, to focus on an adult Hope, on business excursion to the Uplands, trying to secure an investment for a mining project on Mercury. However, his brother Sol is also at the hotel complex at which he's lodged, on an assassination mission, the target being Paul Caunes. Hope has a run-in with an undercover American agent, under the assumption that Hope conspires with his brother. Sol kills him, shortly secures his father and escapes with him and Hope. On board the escape ship, a kangaroo court is held in what turns out to be a makeshift Upland town hall. Caunes is sent into the vacuum to die, after telling his sons that he is \\"sorry\\".

He joined his brother-in-law in a 1009 revolt against Byzantine authority in southern Italy. In 1010, the rebels took Ascoli and Troina. In March 1011, the catepan Basil Mesardonites and Leo Tornikios Kontoleon, the strategos of Cephalonia, disembarked with reinforcements from Constantinople. Basil immediately besieged the rebels in Bari. The Greek citizens of the city negotiated with Basil and forced the Lombard leaders, Melus and Dattus, to flee. Basil entered the city on 11 June 1011 and reestablished Byzantine authority. He did not follow his victory up with any severe reactions. He simply sent the family of Melus, including his son Argyrus, to Constantinople. While Melus fled to Guaimar III of Salerno, Dattus looked to the protection of the Abbey of Montecassino, where he was aided by the Latin monks, and to Pope Benedict VIII, who loaned him papal troops to garrison a tower on the Garigliano, in the territory of the Duchy of Gaeta, then ruled by the anti- Byzantine Emilia. In 1016, Dattus rejoined Melus and his Norman mercenaries in Apulia. They were moderately successful at first, but they were defeated at Cannae (1018) and Dattus fled back to Montecassino and thence to the old tower. In 1020, while Melus was conferencing with pope and the German king in Bamberg, the new catepan, Basil Boiannes, and his new ally, Pandulf IV of Capua, marched on the tower and took it. At Bari on 15 June, Dattus was tied up in a sack with a monkey, a rooster, and a snake and tossed into the sea (the so-called ', similar to the ancient Roma Poena cullei).

For example, in Holocene times, ancient pangolin (Manis palaeojavanica), panther (Panthera sp) and tapir (Tapirus indicus) became locally extinct in Borneo. Of the 57 mammal species that were identified from archaeological remains in the Niah Caves, Sarawak, 13 were bats. Four of these were megachiropterans, Pteropus vampyrus, Rousettus amplexicaudatus, Rousettus sp and Eonycteris spelaea, all of which remain extant species in Borneo and Peninsular Malaysia. The provisional list of mammals of Borneo (sensu Lord Medway, Payne et al., Corbet and Hill, Koopman, and Wilson and Reeder) are listed in the table below. There are various conflicts in the taxonomic lists by previous authors, which need further field research for validation.

The son of Ashe Windham and Elizabeth Dobyns, he made an extensive Grand Tour of Europe in his youth, accompanied by his tutor, Benjamin Stillingfleet; the pair left England in 1737. During 1740‚Äì1741, Windham and Stillingfleet were members of a circle of British expatriates known as The Common Room. The circle lived in Geneva, and amused themselves with amateur theatricals (an unusual sight in that Calvinist city). Other notable members of the group included Richard Aldworth, the 7th Earl of Haddington and his brother, and Lord Hervey. In June 1741, several members of the circle, including Windham, joined Richard Pococke in making an expedition to Chamonix. They appear to have been the first recorded travellers for pleasure in the region, scaling Montenvers with the aid of local guides and giving the name of \\"Mer de Glace\\" to the glacier they subsequently examined. Stillingfleet and Windham returned to Geneva 25 June 1741, and returned to England in July 1742. Returning to England, he became a friend of the actor David Garrick. In 1744, he published a pamphlet, Letter from an English gentleman ... giving an account of a journey to the glacieres or ice alps of Savoy, describing his experiences and observations there. This piece of work, in addition to a talent for mathematics, secured his admission to the Royal Society on 26 April 1744. He married late, having had an illegitimate daughter, Elizabeth, by his first mistress, Mary Morgan, and marrying his second, the widow Sarah Lukin, on 13 February 1750 shortly before the birth of his son, William, on 3 May 1750. The year before, Windham's father Ashe died, and he inherited the family seat of Felbrigg Hall. Elizabeth went on to marry Thomas de Grey. After inheriting the house, he took considerable interest in the local militia, particularly in 1756 when the Seven Years' War made a French invasion a possibility. He aided Lord Townshend in forming the Norfolk militia in 1757, and the two co-authored A Plan of Discipline, Composed for the use of the Militia of the County of Norfolk in 1759. This work became one of the principal drill manuals used during the American Revolution. However, Windham did not live to see this, as he died of tuberculosis in 1761.

As a result of the campaign, the Vaudois were expelled from their homes, but they returned during the War of the Grand Alliance under an agreement reached with Victor Amadeus, the Duke of Savoy. In 1685, Louis XIV issued the Edict of Fontainebleau, which undid the Edict of Nantes in 1598 by ordering the destruction of Protestant churches and the closing of Protestant schools. Louis wanted to bar the flight of Protestants to Southern France and began applying pressure on the Vaudois, who inhabited certain Alpine valleys southwest of Turin, because they were a weak and vulnerable group. The French fortress of Pinerolo was near Vaudois lands and could be used as a springboard for any possible military action.John Lynn, The Wars of Louis XIV. p. 179 Shortly after abrogating the Edict of Nantes, Louis informed his ambassador, the Marquis d'Arcy, to pressure the Duke to deny rights to his Protestant subjects as Louis had done. The Duke politely refused at first, but strong insistence from the French eventually led Amadeus to comply with their requests. On February 16, 1686, d'Arcy reported to Louis that Amadeus had officially requested French military assistance. Louis responded with an offer of five infantry regiments and ten cavalry squadrons to be led by Marshal Catinat, the governor of Casale. Duke Amadeus and Swiss envoys attempted to convince the Vaudois to leave peacefully, but the latter resolved to stay and fight.John Lynn, The Wars of Louis XIV. p. 180 Large- scale military operations began on April 21. French and Piedmontese troops, a total of about 7,000 to 8,000, enjoyed success in the early fighting. An attempt by 500 Barbets, the French name for the Vaudois, to catch and destroy an isolated detachment guarding the French lines of communication failed badly, with the Barbets suffering severe casualties. The Barbets turned to guerrilla warfare in early May, a reflection that direct clashes with the French and the Piedmontese did not produce any results. By this point, 6,000 Vaudois men, women, and children had been imprisoned. Eventually, however, French and Piedmontese forces eliminated all opposition. Catinat wrote the following on May 9: John Lynn, The Wars of Louis XIV. p. 181 Fighting ended in June and Catinat returned to Casale. The surviving Vaudois would continue to suffer. The Piedmontese placed them into prison camps where many died of malnutrition and disease. There may have been anywhere from 10,000 to 12,000 Vaudois in these camps. Of the 900 held at Verrue, only 150 were left by late October. In December 1686, Duke Amadeus reached an agreement with Swiss officials that would allow the remaining 4,000 to 5,000 Vaudois to resettle in Protestant Germany. During the War of the Grand Alliance from 1689 to 1697, a band of Vaudois fought their way from Geneva back to their homeland. Duke Amadeus signed a peace treaty with them and allowed them to live in his lands free of persecution.

He was the son of Abu Bakr Muhammad.  Biography  In 939, Muhammad became ill and Abu Ali was assigned to succeed him in his posts. As governor of Khurasan he undertook several campaigns in northern Iran, conquering Gurgan and territory as far west as Ray from the Ziyarids, forcing the Ziyarids to acknowledge Samanid authority, and killing the Dailamite adventurer Makan ibn Kaki. After he departed for Khurasan the Buyid Rukn al-Dawla seized Ray. In 945 Abu Ali returned and expelled the Buyids from Ray, but they returned a year later. Persia in the mid-10th century That same year, 945, the Samanid amir Nuh I dismissed Abu Ali from the governorship of Khurasan after hearing complaints of the latter's harsh rule, and sought to replace him with a Turk, the Simjurid Ibrahim ibn Simjur. Abu Ali refused to accept his dismissal and rebelled. He was joined by several prominent Iranian figures such as Abu Mansur Muhammad, whom he appointed as the commander of Khurasan. Abu Ali also convinced a Samanid, Nuh's uncle Ibrahim ibn Ahmad, to come from Iraq and installed him as amir in Bukhara when he took the city in 947. Abu Ali, now having secured his position, returned to Chaghaniyan. Ibrahim, however, was unpopular with the people of Bukhara, and Nuh soon retaliated by retaking the city and blinding Ibrahim and two brothers. When the news of the re-capture of Bukhara arrived to Abu Ali, he once again marched towards Bukhara, but was defeated by an army sent by Nuh and withdrew back to Chaghaniyan. After some time, he left the region and tried to obtain support from other Samanid vassals. Meanwhile, Nuh had Chaghaniyan ravaged and its capital sacked. Another battle shortly ensured between Abu Ali and a Samanid army in Tukharistan, which resulted in a Samanid victory. Fortunately for Abu Ali, he managed to secure the support of other Samanid vassals, such as the rulers of Khuttal, and the Kumiji mountain people, and in the end made peace with Nuh, who allowed him to keep Chaghaniyan in return for sending his son Abu'l-Muzaffar Abdallah as hostage to Bukhara. Some time later, Abu Ali was sent on an expedition to quell a rebellion near Chaghaniyan under a self- proclaimed prophet known as Mahdi. Abu Ali managed to successfully defeat and capture the latter and then had his head sent to Bukhara. In ca. 951/2, Abu Ali's son Abu'l-Muzaffar Abdallah died in an accident and his corpse was shortly sent to Chaghaniyan, where he was buried. In 952 following the death of the governor of Khurasan, Mansur ibn Qara-Tegin (Ibrahim ibn Simjur had already died in 948), 'Abu Ali was reinstated by Nuh as governor of the province. At the insistence of the Ziyarids he began a war with the Buyid Rukn al-Dawla, but was unable to take Ray and made peace. This action upset Nuh, who again removed him from the governorship. 'Abu Ali fled to the Buyids and received an investiture diploma for Khurasan from the Caliph and was even reinforced by an army under Lashkarwarz, but was unable to enforce his claim or even return to Chaghaniyan. In 955 he and one of his sons died of the plague in Ray. Their bodies were shortly brought to Chaghaniyan where they were buried. A certain Muhtajid prince, Abu'l Muzaffar ibn Muhammad, probably the grandson of 'Abu Ali, was then appointed as the new ruler of Chaghaniyan. However, according to some other sources, Abu Ali was succeeded by his relative Abu'l-Hasan Taher.

Edward Cole \\"Eddie\\" Oatman (June 10, 1889 ‚Äì November 5, 1973) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player. He was among the elite goal scorers of his era. Among his 32 years (1907‚Äì39) playing professional ice hockey, Oatman was named an all-star for ten consecutive seasons by the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA). He was a star with the Quebec Bulldogs when it won the 1912 Stanley Cup. Oatman played with clubs that won five league championships, and he was a successful coach and captain of five different hockey teams. His brother Russell also played professional ice hockey. Personal life Born and raised in Springford, Ontario, Eddie Oatman began playing organized hockey at age ten and continued for the next eight years in youth leagues in his hometown. He moved away to play hockey for a career, and he coached hockey before returning home and becoming a barber. He married Helen Durning in 1921 and had one son, Ted, born in 1922. He died on November 11, 1973, and was interred at the Springford Cemetery, Oxford County, Ontario, where he is buried next to his brother Russell. He was the subject of a Ripley's \\"Believe It Or Not\\" article for playing 30 years in professional hockey and is featured on at least two trading cards. Playing career Oatman played in 1907 with the Tillsonburg (Ontario) Junior Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) club. The next year he played with the Simcoe Intermediate OHA and, in 1909, he turned professional with the Cleveland, Ohio, club of the International League. The next season, he played on a line with Joe Malone and Jack McDonald for Waterloo of the Ontario Professional Hockey League. In 1911, when Quebec was admitted into the NHA, the three played with the Bulldogs and helped win the 1912 Stanley Cup. Because of that championship, he and every member of the Bulldogs were offered a contract by PCHA teams. Oatman signed with New Westminster Royals. In the 1914‚Äì15 season, he was named to the PCHA All-Star team. The Royals became the Portland Rosebuds and Oatman became the team captain. The following year, he was also its coach and was an All-Star again when the club won the league championship. However, in 1916 the Montreal Canadiens won their first Stanley Cup title, beating Portland three games to two in a best of five playoff series. With Portland's near victory over Montreal, expectations grew for their chances in the 1916‚Äì1917 season, but these hopes ended when Oatman enlisted in the Canadian armed forces as part of the 228th Battalion. When the 228th Battalion secured a franchise in the NHA for the 1916‚Äì17 season, Oatman joined the roster. But when the 228th was sent to Europe for military action in the First World War, Oatman was discharged \\"for special circumstances.\\" The following season Oatman went back to Portland, again as its coach and captain. When the Rosebuds suspended operations, Oatman joined the Victoria Aristocrats as their captain and remained with the team for the next five years. As result of another player's injury, he saw action with the Vancouver Millionaires when they lost the Stanley Cup to the Toronto St. Pats in 1922. Oatman was traded to the Calgary Tigers in 1923‚Äì24.\\"Tigers Getting 60-Minute Player in Eddie Oatman\\" The Calgary Daily Herald, October 18, 1923. He helped the team win the Western Canada Hockey League title, but were denied a Stanley Cup championship when they again lost to the Montreal Canadiens. From 1924 to 1926, he was the Tigers' coach and captain, leading them to back-to-back championships in 1924 and 1925. Unfortunately, pro hockey collapsed in the West after the 1925‚Äì26 season, but he continued to play minor-league hockey. Oatman was the team captain of the Minneapolis, Minnesota, club in the American Hockey Association (AHA) in 1927. Then, for the next three years, he played for the Boston Tigers in the Canadian-American Hockey League (1928‚Äì1930), and as their captain led them to the league championship in the 1929. In 1931, he played as captain for the Buffalo Majors in the AHA. He later served as a player-coach in Yorkton, Prince Albert and Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, until his hockey-playing career ended when he was 50.

It is composed mainly of ground substance with few cells or fibers. It can also refer to a group of mucoproteins resembling mucus found, for example, in certain types of cysts. It is most easily found as a component of Wharton's jelly. The vitreous body of the eye is of a similar tissue. In invertebrate zoology, the term refers to free cells loosely arranged in a matrix. Terminology \\"Mesenchyme\\" is a term introduced by Oscar Hertwig in 1881. In order to differentiate the use of the word mesenchyme in invertebrate zoology (an ecto- or entomesodermal middle layer of some invertebrates) and the use in vertebrate embryology (that is, undifferentiated tissue found in embryonic true mesoderm - entomesoderm - from which all connective tissues like blood vessels, blood cells, the lymphatic system, and the heart are derived.), some authors prefer to use the term mesoglea (in wider sense) in lieu of mesenchyme when referring to the middle layers of sponges and diploblasts, reserving the term mesenchyme for the embryological sense. However, Brusca & Brusca discourage this usage, using mesoglea in its strict sense (noncellular mesenchyme), and preferring to maintain both the embryological and zoological senses for the term mesenchyme. Finally, some similar terms used in botany generally are differentiated by the suffix \\"a\\": mesenchyma (a tissue between xylem and phloem in roots), collenchyma (primordial leaf tissues) and parenchyma (supportive tissues). Vertebrates Structure Mesenchyme is characterized morphologically by a prominent ground substance matrix containing a loose aggregate of reticular fibers and unspecialized mesenchymal stem cells.Mesenchymal tissue Mesenchymal cells can migrate easily, in contrast to epithelial cells, which lack mobility, are organized into closely adherent sheets, and are polarized in an apical-basal orientation. Development The mesenchyme originates from the mesoderm. From the mesoderm, the mesenchyme appears as an embryologically primitive \\"soup\\". This \\"soup\\" exists as a combination of the mesenchymal cells plus serous fluid plus the many different tissue proteins. Serous fluid is typically stocked with the many serous elements, such as sodium and chloride. The mesenchyme develops into the tissues of the lymphatic and circulatory systems, as well as the musculoskeletal system. This latter system is characterized as connective tissues throughout the body, such as bone, muscle and cartilage. A malignant cancer of mesenchymal cells is a type of sarcoma. Epithelial to mesenchymal transition The first emergence of mesenchyme occurs during gastrulation from the epithelial‚Äìmesenchymal transition (EMT) process. This transition occurs through the loss of epithelial cadherin, tight junctions, and adherens junctions on the cell membranes of epithelial cells. The surface molecules undergo endocytosis and the microtubule cytoskeleton loses shape, enabling mesenchyme to migrate along the extracellular matrix (ECM). Epithelial‚Äìmesenchymal transition occurs in embryonic cells that require migration through or over tissue, and can be followed with a mesenchymal‚Äìepithelial transition to produce secondary epithelial tissues. Embryological mesenchymal cells expresses fibroblast-specific protein (Fsp1), which is indicative of their shared properties with the migratory adult fibroblasts, and c-Fos, an oncogene associated with the down-regulation of epithelial cadherin. Both formation of the primitive streak and mesenchymal tissue is dependent on the Wnt/Œ≤-catenin pathway. Specific markers of mesenchymal tissue include the additional expression of ECM factors such as fibronectin and vitronectin. Implantation The first cells of the embryo to undergo EMT and form mesenchyme are the extra-embryonic cells of the trophectoderm. These migrate from the body of the blastocyst into the endometrial layer of the uterus in order to contribute to the formation of the anchored placenta. Primary mesenchyme Primary mesenchyme is the first embryonic mesenchymal tissue to emerge, and it is produced from EMT in epiblast cells. In the epiblast, it is induced by the primitive streak through Wnt signaling, and produces endoderm and mesoderm from a transitory tissue called mesendoderm during the process of gastrulation. The formation of primary mesenchyme depends on the expression of WNT3. Other deficiencies in signaling pathways, such as in Nodal (a TGF-beta protein), will lead to defective mesoderm formation. The tissue layers formed from the primitive streak invaginate together into the embryo and the induced mesenchymal stem cells will ingress and form the mesoderm. Mesodermal tissue will continue to differentiate and/or migrate throughout the embryo to ultimately form most connective tissue layers of the body. Neural mesenchyme Embryological mesenchyme is particularly transitory and soon differentiates after migration. Neural mesenchyme forms soon after primary mesenchyme formation. The interaction with ectoderm and somite-forming morphogenic factors cause some primary mesenchyme to form neural mesenchyme, or paraxial mesoderm, and contribute to somite formation. Neural mesenchyme soon undergoes a mesenchymal‚Äìepithelial transition under the influence of WNT6 produced by ectoderm to form somites. These structures will undergo a secondary EMT as the somite tissue migrates later in development to form structural connective tissue such as cartilage and skeletal muscle. Neural crest cells (NCCs) form from neuroectoderm, instead of the primary mesenchyme, from morphogenic signals of the neural crest. The EMT occurs as a result of Wnt signaling, the influence of Sox genes and the loss of E-cadherin from the cell surface. NCCs additionally require the repression of N-cadherin, and neural cell adhesion molecule. NCCs ingress into the embryo from the epithelial neuroectodermal layer and migrate throughout the body in order form multiple peripheral nervous system (PNS) cells and melanocytes. Migration of NCCs is primarily induced by BMP signaling and its inhibitor, Noggin. Invertebrates In some invertebrates, e.g., Porifera, Cnidaria, Ctenophora and some triploblasts (the acoelomates), mesenchyme refers to a more-or-less solid but loosely organized tissue consisting of a gel matrix (the mesoglea) with various cellular and fibrous inclusions, located between the epidermis and the gastrodermis. In some cases, the mesoglea is noncellular. * In sponges, the mesenchyme is called mesohyl. * In diploblasts (Cnidaria and Ctenophora), the mesenchyme is fully ectodermally derived. This kind of mesenchyme is called ectomesodermal, and is not considered true mesoderm. * In triploblastic acoelomates (such as flatworms), the term parenchyma is sometimes used for the middle (mesenchymal) layer, in which the dense layer includes tissues derived from both ectoderm, and entomesoderm (true mesoderm, derived from entoderm). When cellular material is sparse or densely packed, as in cnidarians, the mesenchyme may sometimes be called collenchyma, or parenchyma in flatworms. When no cellular material is present as in Hydrozoa), the layer is properly called mesoglea. In some colonial cnidarians, the mesenchyme is perforated by gastrovascular channels continuous among colony members. This entire matrix of common basal material is called coenenchyme.

He was in the Royal Ranger Regiment and Regimental Sergeant Major of 8 Renjer (8th Rangers) of the Malaysian Army with his tag number of 901378. He was awarded the Panglima Gagah Berani and Seri Pahlawan Gagah Perkasa medals from the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, Sultan Ahmad Shah on 3 June 1981. He is the sole recipient of both the Seri Pahlawan Gagah Perkasa and Pingat Gagah Berani, and was the last living recipient of the Seri Pahlawan Gagah Perkasa. In the annals of the Malaysian Military History, no one person was more decorated than Kanang anak Langkau of the Ranger Corps. He is one of the very few survivors ever conferred the \\"Seri Pahlawan Gagah Perkasa\\" (Valour Award) whilst still alive and a \\"Pingat Gagah Berani\\" (the Bravery Medal). No other person has ever received two gallantry awards in the history of the Malaysian Armed Forces. Early life and military service Kanang anak Langkau was born on 2 March 1945 in Julau, Sarawak. He entered military service with the British Army, as an Iban Tracker, attending Jungle Warfare School in Ulu Tiram in early 1962. Kanang was attached to the 42 Commando serving during the Brunei Revolt and during the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation. He later served with the Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment. (Subscription Required) He was absorbed into the Sarawak Rangers which eventually became part of the Malaysian Rangers when Malaysia was proclaimed on 16 September 1963. Kanang joined the Sarawak Rangers as an Iban tracker on 21 April 1962. (He was among those recruited by the late Bennett Jarrow). Sarawak Rangers was then part of the British Army and later absorbed into the Malaysian Army's Royal Ranger Regiment upon the formation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963 between the then Federation of Malaya, Singapore, Sabah (then North Borneo) and Sarawak with Singapore ceded later and Brunei opted not to join. In an operation in the Korbu Forest Reserve at Fort Legap on 1 June 1979 whilst on a mission tracking the enemy, Sergeant Kanang's group came across a temporary enemy resting camp. Sergeant Kanang ak Langkau from the 8th Battalion Royal Rangers immediately launched an attack on that enemy camp, an enemy that far outnumbered the Kanang's group. In this fierce contact with the enemy, two of the Rangers were mortally wounded. Five of the enemy were killed and enemy equipment was captured. He was conferred the highest gallantry award, the \\"Pingat Gagah Berani\\" by his Majesty the King. In an incident in Tanah Hitam, Perak on 8 February 1980 a soldier was killed. Kanang, leading a platoon, was sent to track the enemy down and eliminate them. For eleven days they tracked the enemy until they stumbled upon a much larger enemy force at Ladang Kinding, Sungei Siput, Perak. Kanang's tracking skills allowed him to successfully to follow the enemy. The enemy was cunning and skilful in using the ground to their advantage. The lay of the land at that time was an obstacle as they were in very difficult terrain. The enemy was adept at concealment, after the years they spent fighting the British and the Malayans before that. However, the Rangers managed to keep up with the enemy. Even as some of his men were disheartened, he kept their morale up by encouraging them. 11 days after the death of the soldier, he managed to track and identify the enemy's route of escape. On the evening of 19 February 1980 at around 1500, after conducting a reconnaissance, his platoon managed to estimate the location of the enemy, which was located near their location. Actually, they were inside the location of the enemy, as they were at the foot of the hill. They only realized that they were inside the enemy's location when they found a communication cord from the enemy sentry's location. This cord was running from the sentry's location to the enemy's main force. This cord is normally attached to a small bush or empty cans which make noise when pulled. This way the main force can be alerted by the sentry when an enemy approaches. At that moment, Sergeant Kanang was approximately 8 meters from the enemy sentry's location. Realizing that, he launched an assault towards the right by firing towards the right of the enemy with his platoon. After launching the attack, they realised that the enemy's main force was on the left, below the slope of the hill. Without losing his senses, he switched the direction of the assault to the left. They ploughed through the enemy but a large force of the enemy managed to escape. The platoon and Kanang managed to capture five Communist Terrorists on that day. Even with that success, they were saddened by the loss of one of their group who was killed and one more seriously wounded. Whilst trying to rescue his wounded friends, Sergeant Kanang was repeatedly shot, he took three rounds from the enemy into his body. He was in a coma for two months in the hospital but recuperated and was back on active duty. The legendary battle cry  Kanang's battle cry 'Agi Idup Agi Ngelaban' (Still Alive, Still Fighting) inspired his men and other soldiers to fight to death in the defence of the nation. It is believed among the Ibans that this battle cry originated from the famous Iban warrior by the name of Libau \\"Rentap\\" who fought the Rajah of Sarawak, James Brooke at Skrang and Sadok Hill. The son- in-law of Libau \\"Rentap\\" named Layang was known to be the first Iban to kill (bedengah in Iban) a British officer in Sarawak by the name of Alan Lee at the battle of Lintang Batang at the newly built Skrang fort. It was this incident that caused the Brooke to refuse pardon or accept Rentap's surrender like the other Iban chiefs during that time, notably the sons of Orang Kaya Pemancha Dana \\"Bayang\\" by the name of Nanang and his second brother Luyoh who turned rebels against the Brooke government for killing their third brother Ajie at the battle of Sungai Langit in Padeh. Nanang was later appointed Orang Kaya Pemancha to replace his father, for his surrender and his assistance to defeat his fellow Iban chief Libau \\"Rentap\\" at Sadok Hill who he followed just before that surrender. The cannon named \\"Bujang Timpang Berang\\" (One Shoulder Guy) marked with the year 1515 was actually obtained by Orang Kaya Pemancha Dana \\"Bayang\\" in a ngayau expedition to Sambas, Kalimantan and inherited by his sons. Libau \\"Rentap\\" was only defeated after three repeated punitive expeditions by the Brooke force at Sadok Hill but he never surrendered to the White Man like his fellow countrymen did at that material time. He died as a hero and was accorded a warrior or chieftain cremation on a platform above the ground (called \\"dilumbong\\" in Iban) at the Sibau Hill in Pakan Sarawak for defence of his remain from being taken by his enemies and care by his family vis-a-vis a normal burial under the ground for ordinary persons. In recent time, his bones were put inside a proper coffin in a traditional Iban ceremony called \\"ngerapoh\\" and a sungkup shrine built at the same Sibau Hill which can be visited by tourists. Indeed, the ngayau or headhunting spirit of the Ibans for which they were legendary before the practice ceased, is still very much in the blood and body of Kanang and other heroes from Sarawak. Honors For his bravery, Kanang was awarded the nation's two highest awards Sri Pahlawan Perkasa (SP) and the Panglima Gagah Berani (PGB) by His Majesty the King Yang Di-Pertuan Agong Sultan Ahmad Shah in June 1981. He retired as Warrant Officer One (WOI) after serving the army for more than 21 years. A book entitled Kanang, The Story of a Hero was written about his military service and used as a literature text book in the Malaysian national secondary school. Prior to Kanang, Awang anak Raweng who was an Iban Scout from Sarawak in Borneo, won the George Cross for gallantry as recorded in the London Gazette on 20 November 1951.[1] The only Sarawakian who was bestowed with the highest British gallantry award. King George bestowed the 83-year-old veteran from Nanga Skrang, Sri Aman with the George Cross on 20 November 1951 in recognition of his bravery in fighting the communists all by himself after he and four other British army personnel were ambushed in Kluang, Johor on 27 May 1951. Please note Nanga Skrang is the original place of the famous Iban warrior Libau \\"Rentap\\" during the James Brooke era. Retirement and recognition Kanang retired after 21 years of service as a First Warrant Officer. He was the Temenggong (paramount chief) of the Iban in Sri Aman, his place of residence. He was awarded the Officer of the Most Exalted Order of the Star of Sarawak (PBS) (Malay: Pegawai Bintang Sarawak) in 1987. Malaysia's most decorated war hero Kanang Anak Langkau could have died as a pauper as his military services ‚Äì helping to liberate Malaya (and later Malaysia) from the communists were not respected as a hero should be until he and few other war heroes made noise complaining that they had been treated shabbily both by the Federal Government and Sarawak State Government. Their contributions were not financially recognized ‚Äì not even a sen and their welfare were not taken care of, as compared to financial rewards and other perks given to communist terrorists who surrendered. There were six holders of Sri Pahlawan (SP) Gagah Perkasa (the Gallantry Award) from Sarawak, and with the death of Kanang Anak Langkau, there is one SP holder in the person of Sgt. Ngalinuh (an Orang Ulu). The heroes were 21 holders of Panglima Gagah Berani (PGB) with 16 survivors. Of the total, there are fourteen (14) Ibans, one Bidayuh, one Kayan, one Malay and two Chinese army officers. But the majorities in the Armed Forces are Malays, according to a book ‚Äì Crimson Tide over Borneo. The youngest of the PGB holder is ASP Wilfred Gomez of the Police Force. Kanang Anak Langkau was the holder of both the SP and PGB. Their contributions were initially not rewarded, not even a sen except they received pensions like other retired civil servants. The heroes were not even invited to attend national day celebrations. Angered by the ill-treatment, Kanang even refused 'Datukship' offered to him saying he was a poor man and could not afford to receive the title of 'Datukship'. Their woes got the attention of the Member of Parliament (MP) for Lubok Antu in Sarawak Mr. Jawah Gerang who raised the issue in Parliament some time in the 1980s. Approved by the government, a PGB holder was given a monthly allowance of RM300 and a SP holder RM400. For PGB holders like Sgt Dajai Angie, their allowances were backdated to 1973. (Dajai was given the bravery medal in 1971). In 2006, a delegation of the heroes from Sarawak met with the Defence Minister Najib Tun Razak and appealed to increase their monthly allowances by RM700. Instead of accepting their recommendation, Najib who was also the Deputy Prime Minister decided to more than double the increase of the allowance by RM1,600. The issue was brought to Parliament and approved. Thus, a SP holder receives RM2,000 a month, while a PGB holder receives RM1,900 a month. Promotionwise, only on 1 November 2010, an Iban Officer by the name of Stephen Mundaw was promoted to a Brigadier-General. He was the first Iban to become a General in the Malaysian Army since Sarawak became independent on 22 July 1963 from the British and forming The Federation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963 along with North Borneo (Sabah now) and Singapore which was ceded later. If you want to look further; he was the first Iban General in the long history of the Malaysian Rangers when its predecessor the Sarawak Rangers was formed by Rajah Charles Brooke in 1862. With this promotion, inadvertently, \\"an Iban allocation\\" might have been created in the Malaysian Army. For his knowledge in Iban traditions and customs, Kanang was later made a Temenggong for the Iban community of Sri Aman division and last year he was conferred a Datukship by the state government. On 15 April 2009, he made headlines after rescuing a baby orangutan from captivity with his friend, Tay Choon Yong. The baby orangutan was being handed to Semenggoh Wildlife Centre. On 24 September 2011, he was conferred the Commander of the Order of the Star of Hornbill Sarawak (PGBK) (Panglima Gemilang Bintang Kenyalang), with the title of Datuk by the Abang Muhammad Salahuddin, the Head of State's 90th Birthday. In 2011, Kanang supervised Operation Mai Pulai. This operation involved the locating and exhumation of the remains of 21 Iban Trackers and Sarawak Rangers who were killed during the Second Malayan Emergency. Their remains were exhumed from multiple location on the Malay Peninsula and returned to Sarawak where they were ceremonially reburied in July 2011. Death and Funeral Kanang anak Langkau's grave at Kuching Heroes Cemetery On 3 January 2013, he collapsed while watching television at home in Sungai Apong, Sri Aman after complaining of chest pains. Immediately rushed to the Sarawak General Hospital, he was pronounced dead at the age of 67. He was buried on 6 January with full military honours at the Heroes' Grave at Jalan Budaya, Kuching. Meanwhile, messages of condolences and sympathy have been received by the family of the late Kanang from government leaders including from the Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak and Sarawak Chief Minister Abdul Taib Mahmud. According to the Minister of Defence, Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, he will be given a national burial. His coffin, draped in the Jalur Gemilang and the colours of the Malaysian Armed Forces, was first brought to the 1st Infantry Division base located at Bukavu Camp in Penrissen for the family members and friends to perform prayers and miring ceremony (offering ceremony), before being brought to Kuching Civic Centre for the public to pay their last respects. He was buried at the Heroes' Grave in Jalan Taman Budaya, after the funeral prayers at St.Thomas Cathedral in Kuching. Among Ibans, Kanang's acts in the military service is regarded as \\"raja berani tau serang\\" which is commensurate with the highest widower fee for Great War Leader. Otherwise, his temenggong chieftain title entitled him for the fifth widower fee.

The most westerly and most isolated lighthouse in North America, Cape Sarichef Light marks the northwest end of Unimak Pass, the main passage through the Aleutian Islands between the Bering Sea and the Pacific Ocean. When it was first lit on July 1, 1904, it was Alaska's second coastal lighthouse (after Scotch Cap Light), and the only U.S. manned lighthouse on the Bering Sea. Today, the lighthouse is automated, and the beacon is mounted on a skeleton tower. Cape Sarichef was named in 1816 by Russian explorer Otto von Kotzebue after Admiral Gavril Sarychev of the Imperial Russian Navy. History The original lighthouse was a wood tower on an octagonal wood building, in height. The light was above the sea. The lighthouse was known for its extreme isolation, which precluded regular resupply. From August 1912 to June 1913, the lighthouse received no supplies at all; the nearest neighbor was a trapper some away. Although living quarters were originally provided for keepers' families, the Lighthouse Board prohibited civilian keepers from bringing their families because of the site's isolation. Mail and supplies were not received for months at a time. The station shut down from December 1 through March 1 because the Bering Sea was frozen. Due to the privations they endured, civilian keepers got one full year off every 4 years of service. Circa 1933, one of the assistant keepers suffered a breakdown after two years at the lonely station. Following the disastrous tsunami in 1946 that destroyed Scotch Cap Light and killed its 5-man crew, the Coast Guard razed and rebuilt Cape Sarichef Light in 1950. The upgrade included a LORAN radiobeacon to help ships and aircraft obtain an accurate position. A crew of 21 men each served a one-year tour of duty at the station. Approximately from the station was an Air Force DEW (Distant Early Warning) Line radar station crewed by 25 men. Relations between the two services were reportedly very good, with a lot of swapping of everything from food to vehicle parts. The station was automated in 1979. The new light was erected on a steel skeleton next to the old tower. The old light, fog horn and radiobeacon were turned off. The Coast Guard turned the property over to the Fish and Wildlife Service. The old tower and buildings were demolished in 1999.

Members are currently known from Brazil, England, Hungary, Morocco, Spain and China, where the most primitive genera are found, indicating that the family has an Asian origin. Description Reconstructed profiles of three Brazilian species; from top to bottom, Tapejara wellnhoferi, Tupandactylus navigans, and Tupandactylus imperator Tapejarids were small to medium-sized pterosaurs with several unique, shared characteristics, mainly relating to the skull. Most tapejarids possessed a bony crest arising from the snout (formed mostly by the premaxillary bones of the upper jaw tip). In some species, this bony crest is known to have supported an even larger crest of softer, fibrous tissue that extends back along the skull. Tapejarids are also characterized by their large nasoantorbital fenestra, the main opening in the skull in front of the eyes, which spans at least half the length of the entire skull in this family. Their eye sockets were small and pear-shaped. Studies of tapejarid brain cases show that they had extremely good vision, more so than in other pterosaur groups, and probably relied nearly exclusively on vision when hunting or interacting with other members of their species. Tapejarids had unusually reduced shoulder girdles that would have been slung low on the torso, resulting in wings that protruded from near the belly rather than near the back, a \\"bottom decker\\" arrangement reminiscent of some planes. Biology Tapejarids appear to have been arboreal, having more curved claws than other azhdarchoid pterosaurs and occurring more commonly in fossil sites with other arboreal flying vertebrates such as early birds. Tapejarids have long been speculated as having been frugivores or omnivores, based on their parrot-like beaks. Direct evidence for plant-eating is known in a specimen of Sinopterus that preserves seeds in the abdominal cavity. The Barremian- Aptian distribution of some tapejarids may even be partially associated with the first radiation phase of the angiosperms, especially of the genus Klitzschophyllites which represents a more basal angiosperm.Meng, X. (2008). \\"A New Species of Sinopterus from Jehol Biota and Reconstraction of Stratigraphic Sequence of the Jiufotang Formation\\". Thesis, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Could Tapejarid Pterosaurs be the dispersers of Klitzschophyllites angiosperm? A preliminary case of study of zoocory Flaviana J. Lima 1*, Renan A. M. Bantim1,2, Ant√¥nio A. F. Saraiva1 & Juliana M. Say√£o3 Classification Hind leg of an indeterminate tapejarid, with preserved foot pads, scales, and claw sheaths Tapejaridae was defined by Alexander Kellner in 1989 as the clade containing both Tapejara and Tupuxuara, plus all descendants of their most recent common ancestor. As originally conceived, it was composed of two subfamilies: the Tapejarinae of \\"Huaxiapterus\\" corollatus, Sinopterus, Tapejara, Tupandactylus, Europejara, Caiuajara, and possibly Bakonydraco, and the Thalassodrominae of Thalassodromeus and Tupuxuara. Some studies, such as one by L√º and colleagues in 2008, have found that the thalassodromines are more closely related to the azhdarchids proper than to the tapejarids,L√º, J., Unwin, D.M., Xu, L., and Zhang, X. (2008). \\"A new azhdarchoid pterosaur from the Lower Cretaceous of China and its implications for pterosaur phylogeny and evolution.\\" Naturwissenschaften, and have placed them in their own family (which has sometimes been referred to as Tupuxuaridae,Martill, D.M., Bechly, G., and Heads, S.W. (2007). \\"Appendix: species list for the Crato Formation.\\" In: Martill, D.M., Bechly, G., and Loveridge, R.F. (eds.), 2007. The Crato Fossil Beds of Brazil: Window into an Ancient World. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. Pp. 582‚Äì607. though Thalassodrominae was named first). At least one study has also found that the Chaoyangopteridae, often found to be closer to azhdarchids, represent a lineage within the Tapejaridae, more closely related to the tapejarines than to the thalassodromines. Felipe Pinheiro and colleagues (2011) reclassified the group as a subfamily of Tapejaridae, Chaoyangopterinae, for this reason. The exact relationships of tapejarids to one another and to other azhdarchoid pterosaurs has historically been unclear, with different studies producing significantly different cladograms (family trees). It is also unclear exactly which pterosaurs belong to the Tapejaridae; some researchers have found the thalassodromines and chaoyangopterines to be members of this family, while other studies have found them to be more closely related to the azhdarchids (in the clade Neoazhdarchia). Several studies have shown that the \\"tapejarids\\" as traditionally thought of (that is, including the classic examples of both Tapejara and Tupuxuara) are paraphyletic, and do not form a natural group, but instead represent sequential branches of the tree leading. In light of this discovery, several of the traditional names associated with the group have been re-defined. Martill and Naish proposed a revised definition for Tapejaridae, as all species more closely related to Tapejara than to Quetzalcoatlus. Andres and colleagues did not follow this proposal, instead formally defining Tapejaridae as the clade Tapejara + Sinopterus. They also re-defined the Tapejarinae as all species closer to Tapejara than to Sinopterus, and added a new clade, Tapejarini, to include all descendants of the last common ancestor of Tapejara and Tupandactylus. Below are two alternate cladograms: the first, presented by Andres, Clark and Xu (2014), found the a grouping of tapejarids at the base of the clade, with thalassodromids more closely related to azhdarchids and chaoyangopterids, as well as dsungaripterids. The second, presented by Vidovic and Martill (2014), found tapejarines and chaoyangopterines to be the closest relatives of azhdarchids, followed by thalassodromids (represented by Tupuxuara).

The typical operational states of trunks and lines are the idle and busy states, seizure, and disconnect.Bell Laboratories Technical Staff, Telecommunication Transmission Engineering, Vol. 1, 2ed, Salem, NC (1977) p.321. The states are indicated by various electrical signals and electrical conditions depending of the type of circuit, the type of terminating equipment, and the type of intended service. Answer and disconnect supervision are functions of line signaling that convey circuit seizure and disconnect. Answer supervision indicates that a call has been answered. Disconnect supervision provides a signal that the call has been disconnected. For example, the called party may indicate to the telephone exchange that the call is being disconnected by the called party by allowing loop current to flow in the line, or the called party indicates to the exchange that the call is being answered. Requirement The primary reason for answer and disconnect supervision is for billing. The telephone company and the customer need an accurate accounting of calls. It is standard for telephone companies not to charge for unanswered or unsuccessful calls. All call detail records (CDRs) produced should indicate a call was unanswered or unsuccessful, and therefore, incur no charge from the billing system. Some systems may not cut through the audio path until there is a positive indication that the called party answered the call‚Äîthere may not be an audio connection until the answer signal is sent. Lastly, the channel should become free to take new calls when the previous call clears. If there was no indication of the call's disconnect, thus no teardown or clearing then all channels in the system would eventually be blocked. Operation This example shows a T1 trunk using E&M; wink start signaling only. Other methods can be used, although this was the most common in 20th century private circuits. Wink start is used to notify the remote side or PBX that it can send the Dialed Number Identification Service (DNIS), also referred to as the Called Number. Automatic Number Identification (ANI) can also be transmitted. For an incoming call, this occurs: #Calling switch goes off-hook. It sends ABCD bits = 1111. #The called switch sends wink. The ABCD bits transition from 0000 to 1111 for 200 ms, then back to 0000. #The calling switch sees the wink, and then proceeds to send the \\"DNIS\\" (called number) information. This is done when inband multifrequency/dual tone multifrequency (MF/DTMF) tones are sent. #The called switch goes off-hook when the call is answered. It sends ABCD bits = 1111. #The audio path is connected, parties can talk, and the billing system registers a call start record. In an outgoing call the same procedure occurs, but the calling switch and called switch exchange roles. These occur when a disconnect from the calling party happens: #Calling switch goes on-hook by sending ABCD bits = 0000. #The called switch sees the network go on-hook and the switch goes on-hook. ABCD bits = 0000. #The audio path is disconnected, and the billing system registers a call stop record. For a disconnect from the called party to the calling party, these steps are reversed. Supervision signals The signal used for supervision varies depending on the type of trunk being used. These signal types include: #Digital E&M; \\\\- Used on T1 carriers with Channel Associated Signalling trunks #Analog E&M; \\\\- Used for analog E&M; signalling trunks #Analog Disconnect Tone - Used in many South American countries on analog loop start trunks #Analog Open Switching Interval (OSI) - Used in North America on analog loop start trunksUS government glossary #Digital ISDN - Used with both PRI and BRI digital trunks E&M; signaling For channel-associated signaling (CAS) in Digital Signal 1 (T1) trunks that use E and M signaling (earth & magneto, or ear & mouth signaling), there are only two voice channel states. A channel is idle/on hook when there is no call on it or seized/off-hook/energized by an active call. There is no separate state for answered. It mimics an analog loopstart or groundstart line. After a channel is initially seized, each device must indicate the progress of a call. The progress indicators include whether a call is answered or remains unanswered, and when a call is answered, which party disconnects first. These call progress states are important as Telephony systems need to know when the call was attempted, answered, and cleared, hence the term Answer and Disconnect Supervision. Calling party control Calling party control (CPC), or forward disconnect, is a telecommunication signal sent from a central office to the telephone subscriber's equipment to indicate that the calling party has hung up. This indicates that answering machines should stop recording, notifies conference call bridges that a participant has left or removes an abandoned call from a hold queue or interactive voice response menu. The signal may be implemented by removal of battery on the circuit (open switching interval) or by polarity reversal of the tip and ring conductors of the telephone line. An analogue telephone line may also send tones, such as a busy signal, reorder tone, or dial tone, to indicate a call has ended. Some digital trunks, such as SS7, use out-of-band signaling to indicate termination of a call. Open switching interval An open switching interval (OSI), also called open loop disconnect, is a period of time for which the central office battery is removed from a telephone line. The removal of battery may be used to signal the disconnection (disconnect supervision) of the telephone circuit. The term open switching interval originates from the time of early electronic switching systems in the Bell System, e.g. the 1ESS, that replaced electromechanical switches. In the 1ESS switching system employing ferreed crosspoint switches, battery may have temporarily been removed for a few hundred milliseconds from the tip and ring conductors during switching network reconfigurations.Phillip P. Daniele, US Patent No. 4,158,755,Telephone system open switching interval protection circuit (1979) When used with early key telephone systems, this caused a problem of calls, held by the customer via their key telephone, being disconnected inadvertently. In modern telephone systems, including voice over IP (VoIP) media gateways, OSI is intentionally used as a supervisory signal to communicate call disconnection. It indicates that the far end system has released the call.RFC 3660, Basic Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) Packages, B. Foster, F.

Its fossil remains dated back to the Late Jurassic period. History of discovery Fragments of Gnathosaurus jaws were first discovered in 1832 in the Solnhofen limestones of southern Germany but were mistaken for a piece of teleosaurid crocodile jaw by Georg zu M√ºnster, who first named the species Crocodilus multidens in that year. Soon afterwards, Hermann von Meyer classified the same specimen as the new genus and species Gnathosaurus subulatus, a name which came to be universally used shortly thereafter. In the 1860s, scientists such as Albert Oppel compared the G. subulatus jaw fragment to contemporary pterosaurs such as Pterodactylus and Ctenochasma, and concluded that it was also probably a \\"flying reptile\\" rather than a crocodilian.Oppel, A. (1862). Paleontologische Mittheilungen aus dem museum der Koenigl, Paleontologische Mittheilungen aus dem museum der Koenigl. Ebner & Seubert. A more complete skull of an adult pterosaur was found in 1951 and classified as Gnathosaurus subulatus. This slender, long skull had up to 130 needle-like teeth arranged around the side of a spoon-shaped tip. The specimen had an estimated wingspan of about . It probably lead a lifestyle akin to that of modern spoonbills, wading with its jaws open and closing them upon touching small prey.Wilton, Mark P. (2013). Pterosaurs: Natural History, Evolution, Anatomy. Princeton University Press. . Possible juvenile specimens of G. subulatus may be known from several complete skeletons that had previously been classified as the separate species Pterodactylus micronyx. These specimens have also been referred to the genus Aurorazhdarcho, which may itself be a synonym of Gnathosaurus. However, because Gnathosaurus subulatus is currently known only from skulls and jaws, and adult Aurorazhdarcho micronyx known only from a skeleton lacking a skull, the two cannot be confidently referred to the same species. Furthermore, in the only cladistic analysis to date that tests the relationships of both taxa they are found distinct. An additional large specimen, originally named Pterodactylus macrurus, is known from the Purbeck Limestone formation of England. Represented only by a partial lower jaw and neck vertebrae, it has since been considered closer to Gnathosaurus, and its binomial changed to G. macrurus.Howse S. C. B. and Milner A.

Early life Evelyn Owen was born on 15 May 1915 in Wollongong, New South Wales. He attended Wollongong High School but was not particularly academically inclined. Having an independent streak, he set up a ready-mixed mortar business with his brother; this venture subsequently failed.Wardell, 2000, pp. 549 - 550 Despite his lack of a technical background, Owen had a keen interest in firearms. This interest led him to develop a submachine gun, which he believed would be widely used in modern warfare. Development of the Owen gun By 1938, Owen had constructed a prototype which used .22 LR ammunition. The following year, he took the gun to an ordnance officer at Victoria Barracks in Sydney. Despite advising that the gun could be upgraded to a larger calibre, Owen was told that the Australian Army would not be interested. Submachine guns, such as the Thompson Machine Gun, were regarded as being unimportant, and furthermore, there was a perception in the army that such weapons were for gangsters rather than soldiers.Mellor, 1958, pp. 326327 Owen, disappointed with the lack of interest in his firearm, enlisted in the Second Australian Imperial Force (AIF) in May 1940. He was assigned to the 2/17th Battalion. However, just before embarking for the Middle East with his unit, he managed to interest the manager of the Port Kembla plant of Lysaght's Newcastle Works, Vincent Wardell, in the gun. Australia had no experience in the development of mass-produced firearms and relied entirely on designs from the United Kingdom for the manufacture of its small arms.Mellor, 1958, p. 325 Wardell believed that the gun could be quickly manufactured in Australia in quantity and raised the matter with Lysaght's owner, Essington Lewis. Lewis arranged for Owen to meet with a representative of the army's Central Inventions Board, Captain C. M. Dyer. The German Army's use of submachine guns during the French Campaign of 1940 had demonstrated the potential of such weapons, and consequently some elements of the Australian Army were now more receptive to the value of Owen's gun. Dyer, despite a lack of enthusiasm from his superiors, arranged for Owen to obtain leave with a view to constructing more prototypes. Working with Lysaght, by March 1941 Owen produced versions utilising .32 ACP and .45 ACP rimless ammunition. Trials with these prototypes were such that a formal approach was made to the Master- General of the Ordnance, Major General Edward Milford. It transpired that a potential barrier to the adaption of the Owen gun by the army was the development of the Sten gun in the United Kingdom, which was expected to be available by the end of 1941. Milford advised Owen that the army was prepared to wait for the Sten, unaware that significant compromises had been made to the design of the Sten to facilitate mass production. However, the government, in the form of the Minister for the Army, Percy Spender overruled the decision and placed an order for 100 guns. This allowed large-scale testing to be completed.Mellor, 1958, pp. 328329 The Owen Gun circa 1942 In late June 1941 Owen was discharged from the AIF and began work at Lysaght who manufactured his gun. In September 1941 his gun was ready for testing against similar weapons; the American Thompson Machine Gun, the Sten and the German Bergmann. The Owen proved superior to the other weapons and having been variously immersed in water, mud and sand, it also proved itself almost impossible to jam while the other weapons faltered and eventually became unworkable. As a result of the success of the trials, the initial order of 100 firearms was increased to 2,000. After further difficulties, the Owen gun entered mass production in Australia.Mellor, 1958, p. 331 The gun was eventually patented in 1943, and Owen, the patentee, received royalties per gun built. He later sold the rights to the patent to the Commonwealth of Australia. By late 1942 the Owen was being used in jungle fighting against the Japanese in New Guinea. Despite the development of an Australian variant of the Sten, the Austen, the Owen was found to still be the weapon of choice amongst soldiers.Mellor, 1958, p. 332 More than 45,000 Owen guns were produced during the Second World War and they continued in use during the Korean War, the Malayan Emergency and in the early years of the Vietnam War. Later life Owen received ¬£10,000 in royalties and from the sale of patent rights, and used the money to establish a sawmill near Wollongong. His interest in firearms was undiminished and he continued to develop and experiment with guns, notably sports rifles. A bachelor, he was admitted to Wollongong hospital where he died from cardiac syncope on 1 April 1949 at the age of 33.

The Legend In 1723, Hetman Polubotok was recalled to St. Petersburg by Tsar Peter I of Russia. The story holds that suspecting his imminent arrest, Polubotok secretly deposited 200,000 gold coins (chervonets) in the Bank of England, under 7.5% annual interest. The amount, the bank, and the interest vary in different versions: some sources cite two barrels of gold, or 2.5% annual interest, or the Bank of the British East India Company. In his will, Polubotok allegedly bequeathed eighty percent of the gold to a future independent Ukraine, and the rest to his successors. Russian investigation and recovery attempts  The story first became widely known in 1907, when it was published in the Russian journal New Time by Professor Alexander Rubets. In 1908 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia ordered the issue to be investigated by the Russian Consulate in London. Specifically, their unclaimed deposits at the Bank of England over the previous 200 years were investigated, and were found to total less than the alleged amount of Polubotok's fortune. In August 1913 a group of 170 individuals was met in Starodub, Chernihiv region who called themselves the offspring of Polubotok. However, none of the offspring were able to documentarily provide the bonifide documents regarding their relationship to Polubotok nor provide any information regarding the account at the Bank of England. Ukrainian Soviet recovery attempts  A relative - Ostap Polubotok was however found in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. In 1922 he met up with the Ukrainian Soviet Consul - Yuri Kotsubinsky in Vienna and had with him a copy of the 200-year-old document attesting to his legacy. Kotsubynsky approached Hryhory Petrovsky with a plan for the recovery of the fortune. In July 1922 a meeting took place between Ostap Polubotok, Robert Mitchell (from the Bank of England and because of Kotsubynsky's ailment Consul Peter in Maria-Esensdorf outside of Vienna. The matter however came to a halt with the removal and repression of Petrovsky and Kotsubynsky. Soviet investigation and recovery attempts On January 22, 1960 under the Dwight Eisenhower administration the United States proclaimed Ukraine Day. The Soviet KGB reported that England had given money to support this propagandist action and that the money had come from the Polubotok bank account. The matter came to the attention of Nikita Khrushchev who initiated an investigation to recover the money. A commission as set up which included historians - Dr Olena Kompan, and Dr Olena Apanovych.Plachynda, S. Kozak-dusha pravdyvaya - Kiev, 208 p.177 In January 1968 Olena Apanovych published her findings in a paper read at the Presidium. She was later asked not to discuss this \\"state secret\\". According to the investigators on 22 May 1723 Polubotok received a summons to appear in Petersburg. Polubotok thought that the matter was related to his son's secret meeting with Pylyp Orlyk in France. Polubotok began his trip to the Russian capital 13 July 1723. It accompanied two huge carts of \\"salt\\" and \\"salted fish\\". The carts continued to Arkhangelsk and were put onto an English frigate from where the gold was sent to London. The cargo was met in London by Polobotok's son and Pylyp Orlyk and the gold was deposited into the Bank of England with two copies of Polubotok's instructions in Latin. These two documents remain in the Bank of England today. In the chaotic time of the Soviet Union's collapse, the story again attracted public attention. In May 1990, Ukrainian poet Volodymyr Tsybulko announced that if the gold were returned, it would amount to 38 kilograms for each citizen of independent Ukraine. This astronomical figure, about twenty times the world's gold reserve, was achieved due to compounding of interest over 270 years. The heated interest in the Polubotok treasury coincided with a visit to Kiev on June 9, 1990 of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The Ukrainian parliament ordered the creation of a special committee headed by the Vice Prime Minister of Ukraine, Dr. Petro Tronko, which visited London. The gold, however, has not been found. Recently, poet Tsybulko confessed that his speech in 1990 was propagandistic. Outcomes The legend of Polubotok's gold was made into a comic film.

In other words, for finite rings, there is no distinction between domains, skew-fields and fields. The Artin‚ÄìZorn theorem generalizes the theorem to alternative rings: every finite alternative division ring is a field.  History  The original proof was given by Joseph Wedderburn in 1905,Lam (2001), [ p. 204] who went on to prove it two other ways. Another proof was given by Leonard Eugene Dickson shortly after Wedderburn's original proof, and Dickson acknowledged Wedderburn's priority. However, as noted in , Wedderburn's first proof was incorrect ‚Äì it had a gap ‚Äì and his subsequent proofs appeared only after he had read Dickson's correct proof. On this basis, Parshall argues that Dickson should be credited with the first correct proof. A simplified version of the proof was later given by Ernst Witt. Witt's proof is sketched below. Alternatively, the theorem is a consequence of the Skolem‚ÄìNoether theorem by the following argument.Theorem 4.1 in Ch. IV of Milne, class field theory, http://www.jmilne.org/math/CourseNotes/cft.html Let D be a finite division algebra with center k. Let [D : k] = n2 and q denote the cardinality of k. Every maximal subfield of D has qn elements; so they are isomorphic and thus are conjugate by Skolem‚ÄìNoether. But a finite group (the multiplicative group of D in our case) cannot be a union of conjugates of a proper subgroup; hence, n = 1. A later \\"group-theoretic\\" proof was given by Theodore Kaczynski. (Jstor link, requires login) This proof, Kaczynski's first published piece of mathematical writing, was a short, two-page note which also acknowledged the earlier historical proofs.  Relationship to the Brauer group of a finite field  The theorem is essentially equivalent to saying that the Brauer group of a finite field is trivial. In fact, this characterization immediately yields a proof of the theorem as follows: let k be a finite field. Since the Herbrand quotient vanishes by finiteness, \\\\operatorname{Br}(k) = H^2(k^{\\\\text{al}}/k) coincides with H^1(k^{\\\\text{al}}/k), which in turn vanishes by Hilbert 90.  Proof  Let A be a finite domain. For each nonzero x in A, the two maps :a \\\\mapsto ax, a \\\\mapsto xa: A \\\\to A are injective by the cancellation property, and thus, surjective by counting. It follows from the elementary group theorye.g., Exercise 1.9 in Milne, group theory, http://www.jmilne.org/math/CourseNotes/GT.pdf that the nonzero elements of A form a group under multiplication. Thus, A is a skew-field. To prove that every finite skew-field is a field, we use strong induction on the size of the skew-field. Thus, let A be a skew-field, and assume that all skew-fields that are proper subsets of A are fields. Since the center Z(A) of A is a field, A is a vector space over Z(A) with finite dimension n. Our objective is then to show n = 1. If q is the order of Z(A), then A has order qn. Note that because Z(A) contains the distinct elements 0 and 1, q>1. For each x in A that is not in the center, the centralizer Zx of x is clearly a skew-field and thus a field, by the induction hypothesis, and because Zx can be viewed as a vector space over Z(A) and A can be viewed as a vector space over Zx, we have that Zx has order qd where d divides n and is less than n. Viewing Z(A)*, A*, and the Z*x as groups under multiplication, we can write the class equation :q^n - 1 = q - 1 + \\\\sum {q^n - 1 \\\\over q^d - 1} where the sum is taken over the conjugacy classes not contained within Z(A)*, and the d are defined so that for each conjugacy class, the order of Z*x for any x in the class is qd-1. qn‚àí1 and qd‚àí1 both admit polynomial factorization in terms of cyclotomic polynomials :\\\\Phi_f(q). In the polynomial identities :x^n-1 = \\\\prod_{m|n} \\\\Phi_m(x) and x^d-1 = \\\\prod_{m|d} \\\\Phi_m(x), we set x = q. Because each d is a proper divisor of n, :\\\\Phi_n(q) divides both qn‚àí1 and each {q^n - 1 \\\\over q^d - 1}, so by the above class equation \\\\Phi_n(q) must divide q‚àí1, and therefore :|\\\\Phi_n(q)\\\\leq q-1. To see that this forces n to be 1, we will show :|\\\\Phi_n(q)> q-1 for n > 1 using factorization over the complex numbers. In the polynomial identity :\\\\Phi_n(x) = \\\\prod (x - \\\\zeta), where Œ∂ runs over the primitive n-th roots of unity, set x to be q and then take absolute values :|\\\\Phi_n(q)= \\\\prod |q - \\\\zeta|. For n > 1, we see that for each primitive n-th root of unity Œ∂, :|q-\\\\zeta> |q-1because of the location of q, 1, and Œ∂ in the complex plane. Thus :|\\\\Phi_n(q)> q-1.

Biography Grace Lavinia Poole Williams was born the second of six children in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, grew up in Portsmouth, Virginia and Brooklyn, New York, and studied at Washington Irving High School and then the Art Students League of New York, where she joined the American Negro Ballet, beginning her career in a number of dance companies and stage productions. Her work included classical ballet, folk, modern, musicals, and, most importantly, Caribbean dance, which she mastered in the 1940s while working with Katherine Dunham. She spent nearly the entirety of the years from 1953 through the late 1980s teaching dance and founding and developing national schools of dance in Haiti, Guyana, and the Bahamas. She spent most of the last years of her life teaching in New York City, but left the United States for Haiti in 1984 February.

It was located in Tavastia Proper about north of Helsinki. It is also speculated that it might have been the name for an Iron Age and early Middle Ages settlement found opposite to the H√§me Castle. Iron Age Finnish settlement Vanaja is a name commonly used about the excavation site of an Iron Age settlement in central Tavastia, Finland, opposite to the later H√§me Castle in Varikonniemi.Varikonniemi today. According to some interpretations it was a proto-urban settlement, but this is contested. The settlement existed roughly during the 6th to 13th centuries. It is possibly the \\"town of Vanai\\" mentioned once in a Novgorod chronicle that describes how it was destroyed by Novgorodian forces in 1311 CE.Novgorod Chronicle. English translation. It has been suggested that the site was abandoned after the attack. As another possible result from the war, the present-day H√§me Castle was built on the opposite shore of the Vanajavesi lake soon (some researchers, however, have dated the earliest building phase of the castle to the late 13th century). It took however more than 300 years before there was a town next to it again: H√§meenlinna was established 1639. According to preliminary estimations, the site was about hectares making it about half the size of the Bj√∂rk√∂ settlement in Sweden. Excavations have so far covered only a small fraction of the area, and its nature as a town-like settlement or just an ordinary rural site has been disputed. The site was found in 1986.Suomen Museo 99 (1992). . Schulz, E.-L., & Schulz, H.-P., 1993: H√§meenlinna Varikkoniemi - eine sp√§teisenzeitliche - fr√ºhmittelalterliche Kernsiedlung in H√§me.

Vanaja municipality used to cover all the area around the H√§me castle, but eventually it diminished in size and was finally divided between H√§meenlinna, Janakkala, Renko and Hattula in 1967. The most of the municipality is now part of H√§meenlinna. The medieval church of Vanaja is located about south-east of the Iron Age settlement, on a cape, that may have served as the local place of sacrifice. The oldest Swedish name (Vaan-√∂) of the municipality probably originated from the name of the cape, which during springtime floods used to be an island. There was an episcopal manor nearby in the 14th and 15th century.

Eastern Wei did not recognize it, and instead referred to him as Emperor Chu. The official history of Northern Wei, the Book of Wei, written during Eastern Wei's successor state Northern Qi, thus referred to him as Emperor Chu. However, Chinese historians, following the lead of the History of Northern Dynasties, generally refer to him as Emperor Xiaowu. was an emperor of the Xianbei dynasty Northern Wei. After the general Gao Huan rebelled against and defeated the clan of the deceased paramount general Erzhu Rong in 532, he made Emperor Xiaowu emperor. Despite Gao's making him emperor, however, Emperor Xiaowu tried strenuously to free himself from Gao's control, and in 534, he, aligning with the general Yuwen Tai, formally broke with Gao. When Gao advanced south to try to again take control of the imperial government, Emperor Xiaowu fled to Yuwen's territory, leading to Northern Wei's division into two (as Gao then made Yuan Shanjian the Heir Apparent of Qinghe emperor (as Emperor Xiaojing), establishing Eastern Wei). Emperor Xiaowu's relationship with Yuwen, however, soon deteriorated over Yuwen's refusal to condone his incestuous relationships with his cousins, and around the new year 535, Yuwen poisoned him to death. Emperor Xiaowu's successor Emperor Wen of Western Wei is typically regarded, then, as the first emperor of Western Wei, formalizing the division of the empire.  Background  Yuan Xiu was born in 510, as the third son of Yuan Huai (ÂÖÉÊá∑) the Prince of Guangping, a son of Emperor Xiaowen and a younger brother of the then-reigning Emperor Xuanwu. His mother Lady Li was Yuan Huai's concubine, although historical records were not clear on the issue. In 517, Yuan Huai died.Little is known about the rest of Yuan Xiu's family, as the biographies of Yuan Huai were inexplicably lost from extant editions of both the Book of Wei (:zh:s:È≠èÊõ∏/Âç∑22) and the History of Northern Dynasties. In Yuan Xiu's youth, he was considered to be quiet and smart, and he was interested in military matters. In 527, Emperor Xuanwu's son Emperor Xiaoming created Yuan Xiu the Duke of Ruyang. In 530, Emperor Xiaozhuang promoted him to the title of Prince of Pingyang. In 532, the general Gao Huan defeated the members of the clan of the paramount general Erzhu Rong (who had overthrown and killed Emperor Xiaozhuang after Emperor Xiaozhuang killed Erzhu Rong in 530). During the campaign, Gao had declared Yuan Lang, a distant member of the imperial Yuan clan, emperor, to compete with Emperor Jiemin, whom Erzhu Rong's cousin Erzhu Shilong had made emperor. Gao, after victory, considered Yuan Lang an inappropriate choice to be emperor, given his distant relationship to the recent emperors. He considered keeping Emperor Jiemin on the throne, but decided against it when his generals Wei Lan'gen (È≠èËò≠Ê†π) and Cui Ling (name not in Unicode) opined that Emperor Jiemin would be difficult to control in the future; he therefore had Emperor Jiemin imprisoned. He also considered making Yuan Yue (ÂÖÉÊÇÖ) the Prince of Ru'nan, the only surviving son of Emperor Xiaowen, whom he welcomed back from rival Liang Dynasty (where Yuan Yue had fled earlier), emperor, but later changed his mind after hearing that Yuan Yue was violent and arbitrary. At that time, the imperial princes were all largely in hiding, and Yuan Xiu was hiding at a farm. Gao's ally, the general Husi Chun, located Yuan Xiu, and Gao wanted to make Yuan Xiu emperor. After a meeting with Gao, in which Gao vowed allegiance, Yuan Xiu decided to agree. Gao therefore forced Yuan Lang to yield the throne to Yuan Xiu, who then took the throne as Emperor Xiaowu.  Reign in Luoyang  One thing Emperor Xiaowu immediately started doing‚Äîfor which he was criticized by historians‚Äîwas eliminating potential claimants to the throne. Less than 10 days after taking the throne, he poisoned the deposed Emperor Jiemin to death. Six months later, he forced Yuan Lang and another former emperor, Yuan Ye, to commit suicide. He also executed his uncle Yuan Yue. Although Gao made him emperor, Emperor Xiaowu also almost immediately tried to do what he could to avoid being controlled by Gao. Although he married Gao's oldest daughter as his empress around the new year 533, he, after initially appearing to show deference to Gao, began to rule with Husi Chun and his associate Wang Sizheng (ÁéãÊÄùÊîø) as his assistants, making decisions contrary to Gao's opinion, particularly after Gao had defeated the final major member of the Erzhu clan, Erzhu Zhao. He secretly communicated with Heba Yue (Ë≥ÄÊãîÂ≤≥), who controlled the western provinces, and also commissioned Heba Yue's brother Heba Sheng (Ë≥ÄÊãîÂãù) as the commander of the southern provinces, wanting to depend on the Heba brothers to resist Gao's hold. Tensions also increased over Gao's desire to control more provinces and Emperor Xiaowu's corresponding desire to wrest control of the provinces from Gao. In spring 534, Heba Yue's friend and lieutenant, Houmochen Yue (‰æØËé´Èô≥ÊÇÖ), due to Gao's instigation, assassinated Heba Yue. Heba Yue's troops supported Heba Yue's assistant Yuwen Tai to replace him, and Yuwen soon defeated Houmochen, who committed suicide. Emperor Xiaowu continued to engage in talks with Yuwen (whom Heba Yue had previously sent to Emperor Xiaowu as a liaison) with an eye of depending on Yuwen to face off against Gao. In summer 534, Emperor Xiaowu prepared his troops and, believing he could catch Gao by surprise, issued secret edits to Gao pretending that he was suspecting Yuwen and Heba Sheng of rebellion and planning to attack them with Gao. Gao saw through Emperor Xiaowu's plot, however, and instead marched toward Luoyang. Wang Sizheng, believing that the imperial troops were not strong enough to resist Gao's, suggested Emperor Xiaowu to flee to Yuwen's territory, and Emperor Xiaowu decided to do so, rejecting Husi Chun's offer to take one final stand at Luoyang, particularly when Heba Sheng failed to come to the emperor's aid and when Yuwen's troops failed to arrive quickly. It took Gao only a month to reach Luoyang, and Emperor Xiaowu fled west, encountering Yuwen's troops on the way, and had them escort him back to Yuwen's headquarters at Chang'an, where he reestablished the imperial government and made Yuwen prime minister. He also married his sister Princess Fengyi to Yuwen.  Flight to Chang'an and death  Meanwhile, Gao Huan took over the Luoyang region, and soon also defeated Heba Sheng, taking over his territory and forcing him to flee to Liang. Gao then wrote repeated petitions to Emperor Xiaowu, requesting that he return to Luoyang and indicating that he was willing to return to the status quo ante. Emperor Xiaowu did not respond to any of Gao's overtures. Gao therefore made Yuan Shanjian, the son and heir apparent of Emperor Xiaowu's cousin Yuan Dan (ÂÖÉ‰∫∂) the Prince of Qinghe emperor (as Emperor Xiaojing) and moving the capital from Luoyang to Yecheng, thus formally dividing the empire into two (Eastern Wei under Emperor Xiaojing and Western Wei under Emperor Xiaowu), albeit with each claiming to be the rightful one. Meanwhile, Emperor Xiaowu's relationship with Yuwen Tai was deteriorating. While at Luoyang, he had previously entered into incestuous relationships with three of his cousins‚ÄîYuan Mingyue (ÂÖÉÊòéÊúà) the Princess Pingyuan, the Princess Ande, and Yuan Jili (ÂÖÉËí∫Ëóú), who was also created princess. Yuan Mingyue accompanied him on his flight to Chang'an, but Yuwen disapproved of the relationship, and persuaded the imperial princes to arrest and kill her. Emperor Xiaowu was very angry, and he often used his bow or pounded his table inside the palace as demonstrations of his displeasure. Around the new year 535, he drank wine spiked by poison‚Äîin all likelihood placed by Yuwen's assassins‚Äîand died. Yuwen made his cousin Yuan Baoju the Prince of Nanyang (Yuan Mingyue's brother) emperor (as Emperor Wen).

The area is managed by the Bureau of Land Management. At over 11,000 feet, Animas Forks is one of the highest mining camps in the Western US. Location Animas Forks is located on a system of roads known as the Alpine Loop. The loop is a system of unpaved roads which connects the small mountain towns of Lake City, Ouray, and Silverton. Most of the land in the area is managed by either the U.S. Forest Service or the Bureau of Land Management. The Alpine Loop is visited by over 100,000 people each year. Animas Forks, at an elevation of , is more than two miles (3 km) above sea level. The unimproved road from Silverton to Animas Forks is passable in summer by two-wheel drive vehicles. The road beyond Animas Forks over Engineer Pass to Lake City may require four-wheel drive. Low clearance cars will find the Alpine Loop extremely difficult or impossible. History The town's first log cabin was built in 1873 and by 1876 the community had become a bustling mining community. At that time the town contained 30 cabins, a hotel, a general store, a saloon, and a post office. By 1883 450 people lived in Animas Forks and in 1882 a newspaper, the Animas Forks Pioneer, began publication and lasted until October 1886. Every fall the residents of Animas Forks migrated en masse to the warmer town of Silverton. In 1884 a 23-day blizzard inundated the town with of snow; the residents had to dig tunnels to get from building to building. Mining, speculation and processing mills helped Animas Forks grow. Decline When mining profits began to decline investment in Animas Forks was no longer justified. Although mining made a brief 1904 rebound with the construction of the Gold Prince Mill the town's mining days were nearing an end. A rail line ran through the area and stimulated interest in mining in the community again but the railroad never reached its expectations. The Gold Prince Mill closed in 1910 and in 1917 most of the mill's major parts were removed for a new facility in Eureka. The mill's dismantling signalled the beginning of the end for Animas Forks. The town was a ghost town by the 1920s. Today The site continues as a tourist attraction. A Colorado State Historical Fund grant to San Juan County, in cooperation with the Bureau of Land Management, provided for stabilization of the remaining structures in 1997 and 1998. In 2011 the townsite was listed on the National Register of Historic Places which opened up opportunities for additional funding. The initial stabilization effort of the late 1990s was followed up with a comprehensive restoration of the buildings in 2013-2014\\\\. Work identified in the 2009 Historic Structures Assessment was completed under two subsequent grants from the State Historical Fund, beginning in 2013. Work was completed in 2014, just in time for the recognition of the 25th Anniversary of the establishment of the Alpine Loop Scenic Byway. The site was managed collaboratively by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and San Juan County until a long-awaited land swap was recently completed in 2009. The BLM is now the sole owner of the Townsite, and provides interpretive brochures and maps at an adjacent parking area. Entry into the buildings is unrestricted. The nine standing buildings within the Townsite have been stabilized and restored, repairing floors, walls, windows, and doors, to secure the envelope of each building. Cedar shingle roof sheathing has been restored on several of the buildings along with structural repairs and improvements to the drainage around the structures and across the site. The jail structure, the oldest building on the site, has had it gable roof reconstructed as part of the second phase of the project along with new interpretive signage installed in 2014.

The museum is a non-profit organization governed by a 28-member elected board of directors. History The museum was founded in 1964 as the outgrowth of the Southwest Georgia Art Association. It was first housed in an empty hosiery mill, then in 1969, through the generosity of W.B. Haley, Jr., the Art Association constructed a small facility in a local park. In 1983, after a successful capital campaign, the citizens of Albany and Southwest Georgia opened the Albany Museum of Art, a new museum facility located adjacent to the West Campus of Albany State University (formerly Darton College). The Museum facility contains six gallery spaces, a museum store, a 200-seat, multi- functional auditorium, an interactive children‚Äôs gallery, and a classroom for studio arts. On January 2, 2017, the AMA facility sustained serious damage from the straight line winds that blew through the city. Just seven months later, the museum reopened three of the six galleries located on the first floor, the museum sales gallery, classroom, and auditorium. While the permanent collection is currently located in an off-site storage facility, the museum continues to present a robust schedule of exhibitions and programming. The Museum is making plans to move to a downtown facility, pending the location of a suitable building. After the move, the museum will be reunited with its permanent collection. Collection and exhibits The growing collection of the AMA now includes 19th and 20th century American and European paintings, drawings, sculptures, watercolors, prints, and photographs and what has become one of the largest collections of traditional African art in the Southeast outside of a university setting. The museum displays more than 200 works of African, European, and American art from a collection of 2,400 original works. The African collection includes masks, sculpture, pottery, baskets, textiles, jewelry and gold weights. It is one of the largest collections of Sub-Saharan art in the Southeastern United States.

He played eight times for the Ireland national team. Born in Castlewellan, County Down, Toner played for Belfast United before joining Arsenal in August 1919, making his debut for the side against Everton on 11 October 1919. An outside-left, he was a semi-regular in his first two seasons before breaking through properly in 1921-22. He won his first Ireland cap on 4 April 1922 against Wales in Belfast; the match finished 1-1. His second cap came a year later, again against Wales, this time at Wrexham. By now he had been dropped by Arsenal; thanks to fierce competition for the outside left spot from Jimmy Paterson and Samson Haden, Toner only played eight games in total during 1922-23 and 1923-24. He became a regular again in 1924-25 before being dropped after Arsenal were given a 5-0 hiding at home to Huddersfield Town. He also won four more Northern Ireland caps as an Arsenal player, before leaving to join St Johnstone in January 1926 after new Arsenal manager Herbert Chapman decided Toner wasn't part of his plans. In total he played exactly 100 times for Arsenal (89 in the league and 11 in the FA Cup), scoring six goals (all of them in the league). He won two further Ireland caps while with St Johnstone, playing in the Home International games against England and Scotland in 1927. A broken leg forced him to retire, but he subsequently returned to Ireland and became a coach Coleraine, and on one occasion came out retirement to deputise in the side. Toner also played hurling for his county and Gaelic football for Castlewellan GAC.

He played college football at the University of Colorado. Early years Clarke was named after Franklin D. Roosevelt, the 32nd President of the United States. He attended Beloit Memorial High School where he received All-state honors in football and track. He clocked 49.9 seconds in the 440-yard dash. After attending Trinidad State Junior College for two years, where he had a successful career, he became the first African-American varsity football player at the University of Colorado at Boulder, joining the Buffaloes in September 1954. He had to sit out the season after transferring. He was joined by John Wooten the following year and because this was before the civil rights movement, the pair often had to endure open racism outside of Boulder. As a junior, he was an honorable-mention All-Big 7 conference performer, when he was second in the league with 407 receiving yards, during a run-oriented era. He also returned kickoffs, while leading the team with 13 receptions and 5 receiving touchdowns. As a senior, he led the team with 7 receptions for 124 yards and 2 receiving touchdowns. Trailing 0-13 against the University of Missouri and needing a tie or a win to clinch a berth for the 1957 Orange Bowl, Clarke scored 2 second half touchdowns. Clemson University originally stated that they would not play in the bowl against a team with black athletes, but later changed its position and would end up losing 21-27. He was selected to play in the Copper Bowl All-Star game. Clarke amassed 20 receptions for 532 yards (26-6-yard average), 7 receiving touchdowns and 2 blocked kicks, ending his career fifth at the time in receiving yards at Colorado. He was so well liked among his peers on campus, that he was chosen as King of the annual Days festival, Colorado's equivalent of Homecoming King. He also practiced basketball and track. In 2008, he was inducted into the Colorado Athletic Hall of Fame. Professional career Cleveland Browns Clarke was selected by the Cleveland Browns in the fifth round (61st overall) of the 1956 NFL Draft. He played with the team for three seasons, from 1957 to 1959, even though he stood on the sidelines during the first two. He had a total of 10 catches during those three years at offensive right end and was left unprotected in the 1960 NFL Expansion Draft. Dallas Cowboys Clarke was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the 1960 NFL Expansion Draft. His coaches at Colorado and Cleveland criticized his blocking, but the Cowboys were still intrigued by the 6-1, 215-pound player. Instead of picking at his deficiencies, Tom Landry chose to accentuate his strengths. The coach appreciated his speed, soft hands and his ability to run precise routes, so he was converted into a split end. Mostly a backup behind Billy Howton and Fred Dugan, he appeared in 8 games (3 starts), registering 9 receptions, 290 yards, 3 touchdowns and a 32.2-yard average. He moved into the starting role in 1961, tallying 41 receptions, 919 yards, 22.4-yard average (led the league), 9 touchdowns and scored 54 points (led the team). Additionally, he began a streak of seven consecutive games with at least a touchdown reception, which still stands as a Cowboys record shared with Bob Hayes (1965‚Äì1966), Terrell Owens (2007), and Dez Bryant (2012). He turned out to be the Cowboys' first bona fide long-ball threat‚Äîbefore \\"Bullet\\" Bob Hayes joined him. Hayes even credits Clarke for teaching him the proper way to catch \\"the bomb\\"‚Äîthe long pass. He is also credited as the first African American star athlete, on a Cowboys that played in a then racially divided Dallas. In 1962, His opening day performance against the Washington Redskins was one for the ages. His 10 receptions for 241 yards, remains the best opening day performance in terms of most yards receiving, of any wide receiver in the history of the NFL. On September 23, Clarke was part of an infamous play where, for the first time in an NFL game, points were awarded for a penalty. The Cowboys were holding in the end zone on a 99-yard touchdown pass from Eddie LeBaron to Clarke, and the Pittsburgh Steelers were awarded a safety, helping them win the game 30-28. He was close to breaking the NFL season touchdown receiving record until missing the last 2 games with an injury. That year would be his best, becoming the first player in team history to gain more than 1,000 yards in a season (ground or air) and recording 47 passes for career high numbers in yards (1043) and touchdowns (14). In addition to leading the NFL with 14 touchdowns and a 22.2-yard average per reception. In 1964, he caught 65 passes (franchise record) for 973 yards, 5 touchdowns and received All-Pro honors. In 1965, he was moved to tight end and was second on the team with 41 receptions for 682 yards and 4 touchdowns. In 1965, he was a backup to Pettis Norman, but remained productive and became a clutch third down receiver, recording 26 receptions for 355 and 4 touchdowns. The next year, his production fell to 9 receptions for 119 yards. He announced his retirement on July 17, 1968. Clarke led the Cowboys in yards and touchdowns from 1961 to 1964, and catches in 1963 and 1964. He held the franchise record for most touchdowns in a season by a receiver with 14 from his 1962 season, which stood for 45 years until 2007, when it was broken by Terrell Owens. He also had the team record for the most career receiving multi-touchdown games with 9, until it was broken by Dez Bryant in 2014. He retired after the 1967 NFL Championship Game against the Green Bay Packers, in what is now known as the ‚ÄúIce Bowl‚Äù, won by the Packers, 21-17. He left with most of the franchise's records for receiving, finishing with 281 receptions for 5,214 yards and 51 touchdowns in 140 NFL games, which ranks sixth in receiving yards in Dallas Cowboys history. Broadcasting Clarke began his career as a sportscaster for WFAA-TV (Channel 8). He became the first African American sports anchor in a Dallas television station and at CBS. On weekends, he anchored sports reports for WFAA-TV when not working NFL games for CBS. Personal life Clarke died on July 25, 2018 at the age of 84.

Justin's father's profession, cigar making, didn't suit H. J., so he moved to Texas in 1877 at the age of 18. First settling in Gainesville, Texas at a time when Indian raids from the Oklahoma Territory were just beginning to wane, Justin was first employed as a shoe repairman at a local Gainesville shop. After a few years working on shoes, he moved west to the fledgling town of Burlington, Texas (now Spanish Fort, Texas) in Montague County, Texas and opened a boot shop with a $35 loan from the local barber. The town he chose for relocation was ideal for a boot maker. Burlington was not only on the Chisholm Trail near the crossing of the Red River, but also served as a supply headquarters for cowboys and ranchers. In Burlington, Joe met and married Annie Allen, and in 1889 moved south to Nocona, Texas with their first son, John. Although successful in Spanish Fort, Joe knew that the business environment in Nocona would be more promising due to the newly constructed Missouri-Kansas-Texas railway and expanded market capacity. Once in Nocona and capitalizing on the larger market, Annie Justin, H.J.'s wife, developed a fit kit in the early 1890s, which included a tape measure and an instructions chart for taking one's measurements for a pair of custom fit boots. Cowboys carried the fit kits with them on their journeys, becoming Justin's first traveling sales force. In 1908, sons John and Earl came to work for their father, and the company was renamed H.J. Justin and Sons. In 1910, the company doubled its production utilizing new technology, and Justin boots were sold to 26 states, Canada, Mexico, and Cuba for $11 a pair. H. J. Justin and Sons continued to expand until the elder Justin's death in 1918. John and Earl took over the business after their father's death in 1918. In 1925, the brothers moved the company headquarters to Fort Worth, Texas to capitalize on that city's growth. John and Earl's sister, Enid Justin, knowing that father H. J. would have wanted the boot company to remain in Nocona, opened her own business, the Nocona Boot Company. Thus began the legend of quality and craftsmanship from one of the most famous boot-making families in the world. While Justin and Nocona have grown considerably since the early days in Burlington, the same principles passed down from H. J. to sons John and Earl and daughter Enid, still hold true. H.J. Justin said, \\"No boot shall ever bear the Justin brand unless it is the very best that can be produced from the standpoint of material, style and workmanship. It is my wish that I might leave behind me an institution which will uphold the standards and spirit of the true West.\\" References * University of Texas Austin External links * Findagrave memorial for Herman Joseph Justin Category:1859 births Category:1918 deaths Category:People from Lafayette, Indiana Category:People from Gainesville, Texas Category:People from Montague County, Texas Category:People from Nocona, Texas ","title":"Herman Joseph Justin"},{"id":"7132427","title":"Rowing at the 1976 Summer Olympics"},{"id":"7132452","text":"Tada is a village in Nellore district of Andhra Pradesh.

From there it belongs to the genus Coenobita, one of two genera split from the family, which contains sixteen species. The Latin origins of the species name, brevimanus, come from the adjective brevis (\\"small\\") and the noun manus (\\"hands\\"). It is known as the Indos crab or Indonesian crab because it is primarily distributed throughout the Indo-Pacific.  Description  C. brevimanus is one of the larger species in the genus Coenobita. The adults can grow up to .5 pounds (230 g). They can live 12‚Äì70 years and are known to grow to the size of a coconut. During the beginning of the crab's juvenile stage the middle of its carapace possesses a long reddish pigment area as does each side wall of the carapace. As the crab reaches one month old these areas develop into a brown stripe down the middle of the carapace and two brown bands on either side wall of the carapace. The rest of the carapace as well as the pereiopods slowly transition from a white color to a grayish color. Eventually, when they reach full adulthood, they are brownish red with violet shading on their limbs. The brown stripe and bands are still present in the adult crabs. They are darker than most other species of its genus.Hamasaki K, Tsuru T, Sanda T, Fujikawa S, Dan S, Kitada S (2017). Ontogenetic change of body color patterns in laboratory-raised juveniles of six terrestrial hermit crab species. Plazi.org taxonomic treatments database. Checklist dataset https://doi.org/10.11646/zootaxa.4226.4.5 accessed via GBIF.org on 2019-03-19. They have an abdominal lung and extremely reduced gills due to their terrestrial lifestyle.Farrelly C.A., Greenaway P. (2005) The morphology and vasculature of the respiratory organs of terrestrial hermit crabs (Coenobita and Birgus): Gills, branchiostegal lungs and abdominal lungs Arthropod Structure and Development, 34 (1) , pp. 63-87. They also have a disproportionately large dark purple pincher and long black eye stalks which they can easily be identified by. There is also a pink variation of C. brevimanus in which their dominant pincher is pink instead of a dark purple. Compared to other species in their genus, they do not prefer large gastropod shells, and the armored variation of this crab, in which a tougher exoskeleton is present, specifically likes small shells that only cover their body past their third pair of walking legs. Although their availability and demand has risen in recent years, they are not commonly kept as pets due to their size, but they are the largest land hermit crab known to be in captivity.Hsu C-H, Otte ML, Liu C-C, Chou J-Y, Fang W-T (2018) What are the sympatric mechanisms for three species of terrestrial hermit crab (Coenobita rugosus, C. brevimanus, and C. cavipes) in coastal forests? PLoS ONE 13(12): e0207640. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0207640  Distribution and habitat  C. brevimanus is native to the east coast of Africa and south-west Pacific Ocean. It has also been reported in East Africa, the Philippines, Japan, China, and Taiwan. They usually reside inland and away from the coastline in moist environments such as rainforests because they do not like to get wet, but still require a high amount of humidity. Generally, they require at least eighty percent humidity and enjoy temperatures between eighty and eighty-five degrees, which influences their distribution greatly towards tropical zones.Hsu C-H, Otte ML, Liu C-C, Chou J-Y, Fang W-T (2018) What are the sympatric mechanisms for three species of terrestrial hermit crab (Coenobita rugosus, C. brevimanus, and C. cavipes) in coastal forests? PLoS ONE 13(12): e0207640. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0207640 The present record of this species suggests a continuous distribution from the east coast of Africa to the south-west Pacific Ocean.Reshmi, R., & Bijukumar, A. (2010). First report of the hermit crab Coenobita brevimanus and Coenobita rugosos (Crustacea: Decapoda: Anomura) from the Indian coast. Marine Biodiversity Records, 3, E121. doi:10.1017/S1755267210001089  Behavior and ecology  This purple hermit crab is using a soup can as a shell because there were no large snail shells left in the area, probably due to collection for the souvenir market. C. brevimanus larvae is brooded inside the female's shell, then laid in seawater. This is the only time the adult C. brevimanus returns to the water after they reach adulthood. They grow from the larval planktonic stage to the magalopal stage before migrating from the sea to the land. They also develop a habit of acquiring discarded gastropod shells for inhabitation before migration. If gastropod shells are not present, often due to the collection for the souvenir market, they can be seen using soup cans and other litter as shells. After they acquire their shell, they migrate onto land.Hamasaki, Saori Kato, Sora Hatta, Yu Murakami, Shigeki Dan & Shuichi Kitada (2014) Larval development and emigration behaviour during sea-to-land transition of the land hermit crab Coenobita brevimanus Dana, 1852 (Crustacea: Decapoda: Anomura: Coenobitidae) under laboratory conditions, Journal of Natural History, 48:17-18,1061-1084, DOI: 10.1080/00222933.2013.861941 After this migration they are fully terrestrial, being the most terrestrial species in the genus Coenobita, often found over one hundred meters from the coast. As they grow on land, they tend to molt around every eighteen months, in which they burrow underground, molt, and then come up when their exoskeleton is no longer soft. This process can take upwards to a month.Sue Fox (2000). Hermit crabs: everything about anatomy, ecology, purchasing, feeding, housing, behavior, and illness. Barron's Educational Series. . They are highly active during the month of July, with an increase in activity in the months leading up to July, and a decrease in activity after the month of July.Hsu C-H, Otte ML, Liu C-C, Chou J-Y, Fang W-T (2018) What are the sympatric mechanisms for three species of terrestrial hermit crab (Coenobita rugosus, C. brevimanus, and C. cavipes) in coastal forests? PLoS ONE 13(12): e0207640. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0207640 Although they are terrestrial, they can only tolerate a 28% loss of body water. Beyond this point a severe disruption in oxygen transport occurs. They also have difficulty recovering from periods of dehydration. In order to prevent dehydration they fill their shells with brackish or fresh water.Burggren, W., & McMahon, B. (Eds.). (1988). Biology of the Land Crabs. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. dio:10.1017/CBO9780511753428 They have the ability to detect volatile chemicals in the air in relation to food and water sources and orient themselves accordingly, which is useful in finding food and unevenly distributed inland water supplies.Vannini, Jacopo Ferretti; Chemoreception in Two Species of Terrestrial Hermit Crabs (Decapoda: Coenobitidae), Journal of Crustacean Biology, Volume 17, Issue 1, 1 January 1997, Pages 33‚Äì37, https://doi.org/10.1163/193724097X00061 They are omnivores and scavenger feeders who operate primarily at night. They tend to prefer fish over fruits when given the option between the two. They have also been known to prey on smaller species of hermit crabs, such as C. rugosus, making them not only scavengers, but also predators.Hsu C-H, Otte ML, Liu C-C, Chou J-Y, Fang W-T (2018) What are the sympatric mechanisms for three species of terrestrial hermit crab (Coenobita rugosus, C. brevimanus, and C. cavipes) in coastal forests?

It's an extension to NUnit, a tool for test-driven development in .NET. How it works NUnitAsp is a class library for use within NUnit tests. It provides NUnit with the ability to download, parse, and manipulate ASP.NET web pages. With NUnitASP, tests do not need to know how ASP.NET renders controls into HTML. Instead, NUnitASP library can do this, keeping the test code simple and clean. For example, tests don't need to know that a DataGrid control renders as an HTML table; NUnitASP handles the details. This gives users freedom to focus on functionality questions, like whether the DataGrid holds the expected values.

By 1950, the Maha Sangh, a rival to the Kisan Sangh, was well established in Labasa in the Northern Division. As negotiations began for the 1950 cane contract, the Kisan Sangh decided to spread its activities to the Northern Division and the Labasa Kisan Sangh was formed with support from Viti Levu. After 1954, the leadership of the Labasa Kisan Sangh passed to young lawyer, Vijay R. Singh. The Labasa Kisan Sangh, remained autonomous from the main body based in Viti Levu mainly because of personal differences between Ayodhya Prasad and Vijay R. Singh. In 1959, the Labasa Kisan Sangh was one of the cane farmers unions which formed the Federation of Cane Growers to negotiate the new cane contract with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. In 1960, the Labasa Kisan Sangh together with the Viti Levu-based Kisan Sangh, signed the cane contract in defiance of the majority of the members of the Federation. After Ayodhya Prasad's retirement from public life, Vijay R. Singh, who was then a Government Minister, became the nominal leader of the Kisan Sangh.

He was overtaken and killed by Bhima. According to the Mahabharata (Book III: Varna Parva, Section 156), Jatasura used his powers of illusion to appear in the guise of a Brahmana to the Pandavas. His objective was to gain their confidence in order to seize their weapons, ravish their wife Draupadi, and take some captives. He lay in wait \\"like unto a fire covered with ashes.\\" One day when Bhima was gone, Jatasura took on a monstrous form, seized the weapons and Draupadi, and fled with three of the Pandavas, including Yudhishthira, and twins, as his captives. Yudhishthira, however, confused him by showering him with moral accusations, and Jatasura slowed down enough for Bhima to catch up. The twins were thus speaking of virtue of kshatriya, when Bhimasena made his appearance. He saw his brothers along with wife rebuking that demon. Bhima of mighty strength was fired with wrath, and challenged Rakshasa for a fight saying, ' I had found out your identity already; but i had not slain you at that time. Thou wert in the disguise of a Brahmana - nor didst thou say anything harsh unto us. And, furthermore, thou wert our guest, therefore i slew you not. Now today your time had cometh.' Saying this Bhima bursting with wrath, rushed towards the Rakshasa for a wrestling. Both sons of Madri rushed to help him, but was stopped by Vridokara saying he is himself more than a match for that Rakshasa. They fought with gigantic trees, large crags(rocks), along with their arms. At last, Bhima with force dealt a death blow on his neck. Struck by that fist, Rakshasa became faint. Bhima catching hold of that exhausted one, lifted him up and dashed him with force to the ground, smashing all his limbs. And striking him with his elbow, he severed from his body the head and rolling eyes, he fell besmeared with gore, like unto a fruit from its stem. Having slain Jatasura, Bhima presented himself before Yudhishthira, getting praise from him.

The instrument will be used to look at the light from up to 400 stars or galaxies simultaneously over a field of view of 30 arcminutes (about the size of the full moon on the sky). The instrument will be used for a number of key programmes, including galaxy formation and evolution and dark energy via a measurement of the rate at which the universe is expanding. It is currently being built by a consortium of institutes led by Kyoto University and Oxford University with parts also being manufactured by the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Durham University and the Anglo-Australian Observatory. The instrument is scheduled for engineering first-light in late 2008. The spectrographs use a technique called OH- suppression to increase the sensitivity of the observations: The incoming light from the fibres is dispersed to a relatively high resolution and this spectrum forms an image on a pair of spherical mirrors which have been etched at the positions corresponding to the bright OH-lines. This spectrum is then re-imaged through a second diffraction grating to allow the full spectrum (without the OH lines) to be imaged onto a single infrared detector.

It is located in the suburb of Muthaiga, about 15 minutes' drive from the city centre. The Muthaiga Country Club opened on New Year's Eve in 1913, and became a gathering place for the colonial British settlers in British East Africa, which later became in 1920, the Colony of Kenya. One of the club's main founders was The Hon Berkeley Cole (1882-1925), an Anglo-Irish aristocrat from Ulster. Cole was a son of The 4th Earl of Enniskillen and was a brother of The Hon Lowry Cole (1881-1929). Berkeley Cole was also the brother-in-law of Hugh, Lord Delamere, effective 'founder' of the White community in Kenya. Caroline Elkins describes the club as having had a reputation during colonial times as 'the Moulin Rouge of Africa', where the elite 'drank champagne and pink gin for breakfast, played cards, danced through the night, and generally woke up with someone else's spouse in the morning.' According to Ulf Aschan, \\"The club had a rule, still in force today, that a member is entitled to damage any loose property as long as he pays double its value.\\" Today, the club is still frequented by the upper echelons of Kenyan society. In addition to social gatherings, the club offers accommodation. Many of its members play golf at the nearby Muthaiga Golf Club.  In popular culture  The Muthaiga Country Club is a setting in the 1942 memoir West With the Night by Beryl Markham. The author described it like this: \\"'Na Kupa Hati M'zuri' (I Bring You Good Fortune) was, in my time, engraved in the stone of its great fireplace. Its broad lounge, its bar, its dining-room ‚Äî none so elaborately furnished as to make a rough- handed hunter pause at its door, nor yet so dowdy as to make a diamond pendant swing ill at ease ‚Äî were rooms in which the people who made the Africa I knew danced and talked and laughed, hour after hour.\\" The Muthaiga Country Club features in Ernest Hemingway's novel Islands in the Stream (1970) during events set before WWII Evelyn Waugh describes the Muthaiga Country Club in his 1931 travel book Remote People (also included in the anthology When the Going Was Good). Whilst Waugh was unable to find accommodation on the premises, he discovered, upon his arrival in Nairobi, to be already a temporary member, as he had been registered by the secretary of the club who knew about his arrival.

History An etching by James Hopkirk of a sailboat crossing the aqueduct It was designed by Robert Whitworth, one of John Smeaton's supervising engineers on the Forth and Clyde Canal project. The contractors were William Gibb (founder of the engineering dynasty that led to Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners) and John Muir, who also built the nearby Maryhill locks. A foundation stone was laid on 16 June 1787 by Archibald Spiers, the chairman of the canal committee. When opened in 1790 it was Britain's largest aqueduct, and onlookers were impressed at the sight of sailing boats crossing above them. The entire project cost ¬£8,509, exceeding the original estimated cost of ¬£6,200. It was protected as a category A listed building in 1989. Design It is long, with four arches of span, and high above the surface of the river. According to measurements by John Rennie as the canal was nearing completion, there was around of puddle clay at the bottom of the canal. The aqueduct was designed to carry a depth of of water. The piers are buttressed in such a way as to resemble cutwaters, but only one pier sits in the river. The sides of the aqueduct are arched in order to transfer the outward pressure of the water onto the buttresses, an effect which can clearly be seen from above. This design feature is also present on the Luggie Aqueduct at Kirkintilloch, which opened in 1773. The aqueduct is built from rustic masonry at the lower levels and polished ashlar above. Underneath it is the Kelvin Walkway, which runs through an area of green space around the river.

The avenue is classified as a national tertiary road of the DPWH's Philippine highway network. History Balete Drive was named after a gargantuan balete tree that used to stand in the middle of the road. The road, although the exact construction date is unknown, had been cemented and asphalted and became a main thoroughfare during the regime of President Ferdinand Marcos in the early 1970s. There are several Spanish houses in the area, including the famous 200-year-old \\"Centennial House\\", which supports the claim that Balete Drive has been in use since the late Spanish era towards the end of the 19th century. Haunting legend In the past, the street was lined with large balete trees that darkened the area considerably and made it appear \\"frightening\\" to some Manila residents. In Pinoy folklore, balete trees are believed to be a \\"home for spirits and mysterious creatures\\". Various legends and folklore have circulated since the 1950s that the street was haunted. Most of the legends describe a kaperosa (white lady) ghost, a popular character in the Philippine folklore, who is supposedly haunting taxi drivers \\"for eternity\\". According to legend, the ghost is a teenage girl who was run over and killed by a taxi driver at night, then buried around a Balete tree in Balete Drive. One variation of the legend claims a student at the University of the Philippines was sexually assaulted and killed by a taxi driver, and her spirit roams the street looking for her murderer. Another version of the story claims that a female resident of one of the ancestral mansions lining Balete Drive was abused and killed by her own family, and her spirit haunts the road, seeking help from passing drivers. According to local rumor, the legend of Balete Drive was \\"fabricated by a reporter in the 1953 in order to come up with an interesting story\\". In 2005, a Quezon City barangay official proposed that the city could use the legends to boost tourism by declaring the street \\"haunted\\" and making it available for Halloween parties.

It consists of a set of guiding principles and a number of processes and best practices that are further defined as a set of key management practices to support and help executive management and boards at an enterprise level. The latest release of the framework, published by IT Governance Institute (ITGI), based on the experience of global practitioners and academics, practices and methodologies was named Enterprise Value: Governance of IT Investments, The Val IT Framework 2.0. It covers processes and key management practices for three specific domains and goes beyond new investments to include IT services, assets, other resources and principles and processes for IT portfolio management. Overview Val IT allows business managers to get business value from IT investments, by providing a governance framework that consists of * a set of guiding principles, and * a number of processes conforming to those principles that are further defined as a set of key management practices. The major domains are as follows: * Value Governance (VG prefix) * Portfolio Management (PM prefix) * Investment Management (IM prefix) Currently (as of 2006) a relatively short body of work, it will evolve and expand over time, with documents available for download via the Val IT Page at ISACA, and include: * the framework itself; * a template/guide to using Val IT when developing a business case; * a case study; and * FAQ Relationship to COBIT Val IT is tightly integrated with COBIT Version 4, also from the Information Systems Audit and Control Association (a.k.a. ISACA). The Framework document explains the difference between COBIT and Val IT as follows: > Val IT extends and complements COBIT, which provides a comprehensive control > framework for IT governance. Specifically, Val IT focuses on the investment > decision (are we doing the right things?) and the realisation of benefits > (are we getting the benefits?), while COBIT focuses on the execution (are we > doing them the right way, and are we getting them done well?) COBIT Version 5 incorporates Val IT (and Risk IT) to its framework: > The COBIT 5 process reference model is the successor of the COBIT 4.1 > process model, with the Risk IT and Val IT process models integrated as > well. Relationship to VMM Value Measuring Methodology (VMM), which has the motto \\"it's not just about ROI any more\\", provides more specific guidance than Val IT about: * the different types of value (tangible and intangible) that can be considered; and * how to compare the \\"apples\\" (tangibles) with \\"oranges\\" (intangibles) from individual projects to help maintain balance. Principles * IT-enabled investments will be managed as a portfolio of investments. * IT-enabled investments will include the full scope of activities that are required to achieve business value. * IT-enabled investments will be managed through their full economic life cycle. * Value delivery practices will recognize that there are different categories of investments that will be evaluated and managed differently. * Value delivery practices will define and monitor key metrics and will respond quickly to any changes or deviations. * Value delivery practices will engage all stakeholders and assign appropriate accountability for the delivery of capabilities and the realization of business benefits. * Value delivery practices will be continually monitored, evaluated and improved. Major Processes Each of the following major processes/activities have a responsibility assignment (RACI) matrix, indicating the responsibilities of the senior executives, business managers, and information managers, along with the major and minor COBIT control objectives associated with the activity. Value Governance * VG1: Establish informed and committed leadership. * VG2: Define and implement processes. * VG3: Define portfolio characteristics. * VG4: Align and integrate value management with enterprise financial planning. * VG5: Establish effective governance monitoring. * VG6: Continuously improve value management practices. Portfolio Management * PM1: Establish strategic direction and target investment mix. * PM2: Determine the availability and sources of funds. * PM3: Manage the availability of human resources. * PM4: Evaluate and select programmes to fund. * PM5: Monitor and report on investment portfolio performance. * PM6: Optimise portfolio performance. Investment Management * IM1: Develop and evaluate the initial programme concept business case. * IM2: Understand the candidate programme and implementation options. * IM3: Develop the programme plan. * IM4: Develop full life-cycle costs and benefits. * IM5: Develop the detailed candidate programme business case. * IM6: Launch and manage the programme. * IM7: Update operational IT portfolios. * IM8: Update the business case. * IM9: Monitor and report on the programme. * IM10: Retire the programme. Use with other management domains As with COBIT, Val IT can be adapted for use with many other domains that are yet to develop an engineering perspective, by either removing the phrases \\"Information Technology\\" and \\"IT-enabled\\", or replacing them with the name of your domain of interest (e.g. \\"Marketing\\"), and then \\"season to taste\\".

JODF-TV and JOII-TV functioned as secondary affiliates of ANN (formerly NET) between the early 1970s and the fall of 1996. The Asahi network's full schedule was available on some local cable television providers via JOEM-TV (from Sendai), which was receivable over the air in portions of the prefecture's southern areas. Digital terrestrial television broadcasts commenced on 1 October 2006, and analog broadcasts were expected to continue until 24 July 2011. The 11 March 2011 earthquake resulted in an indefinite postponement of the shutdown of all analog broadcasts across Iwate, Miyagi, and Fukushima prefectures. JOIY-TV finally shut down its analog signal on 31 March 2012 shortly before 0:00 JST, with regular programming having ended twelve hours earlier.

It is located at the intersection of Route 38, U.S. Route 30 (US 30), and US 130, close to the Camden border. South of the circle, US 30 and US 130 run concurrently until they reach the former Collingswood Circle in Collingswood. The Airport Circle opened in 1927 and is the first of is kind in the United States. It is named for Camden Central Airport whose terminal building was located beside the circle, to the south-east. The circle has been modified to include traffic lights and ramps to help move traffic through. Description The Airport Circle is located in Pennsauken Township in Camden County, east of the city of Camden. The circle serves as the junction between US 30, US 130, Route 38, and County Route 607 (CR 607, Kaighns Avenue). From the circle, US 130 heads northeasterly on six-lane divided highway called Crescent Boulevard, US 30 continues westward onto six-lane divided Admiral Wilson Boulevard, CR 607 runs westerly along two-lane undivided Kaighns Avenue, US 30/US 130 continues southward on six-lane divided Crescent Boulevard, and Route 38 heads to the easterly as a six-lane divided road, coming to an interchange with Route 70 a short distance later. All five roadways have ramps that feed into the circle itself, with traffic lights that govern movements at the ramps from westbound Route 38, southbound US 130, and eastbound US 30 and a stop sign at the ramp from Kaighns Avenue. The ramp from westbound US 30/northbound US 130 merges into the main circle. The mainline of US 130 passes through the circle. There are flyover ramps that carry the mainline of US 30 through the circle. The eastbound US 30 ramp heads into the center of the circle, where a ramp for eastbound Route 38 splits and continues east over the circle to connect to that route. Eastbound US 30 merges with southbound US 130 in the median of that route. The flyover ramp carrying westbound US 30 forks to the right from northbound US 130 and heads to the east of the circle, passing over Route 38 before coming to a ramp connecting westbound Route 38 to westbound US 30\\\\. The ramp heads over US 130, with a ramp from the southbound direction of that route, before continuing west and merging with the ramp to US 30 westbound from the center of the circle. To the north of the circle is a residential neighborhood while the Airport Industrial Park is to the southeast. Other commercial and industrial establishments surround the circle to the northeast and west. History Built in 1925, the Airport Circle is New Jersey's first traffic circle. The circle opened to traffic on July 1, 1927, as the first such traffic rotary in the United States. It is named for the former Camden Central Airport, an airport that operated in this vicinity between 1929 and 1957. The Airport Circle was later modified to include overhead ramps and traffic lights to move traffic through. The world's first drive-in theater opened June 6, 1933, on Admiral Wilson Boulevard at Airport Circle a short distance from Cooper River Park.

The reservoir lies in the parish of Grafton and collects rainfall from the eastern end of the Vale of Pewsey and the surrounding hills. It was created by John Blackwell in 1836, by damming a narrow branching valley, and is fed by natural springs. In addition to providing water for the canal, which is pumped by Crofton Pumping Station, it provides a haven for wildlife. It has been stocked with rainbow trout. When the canal was built, there were no reliable water sources available to fill the summit by normal gravitational means. However a set of usable springs were found adjacent to the canal route about one mile (2 km) east of the summit pound, and about 40 feet (12 m) below it. Arrangements were made for these springs to feed the pound below lock 60 at Crofton Locks. Some years later the reservoir was created to enhance the supply to this pound. The reservoir outfall and sluices are designated as a Grade II listed building.

Career After playing in a handful of experimental rock bands in the early 1990s, Vervloesem joined avant-garde band X-Legged Sally at the invitation of Michel Mast. During that collaboration, he appeared on the band's albums: Slow-Up (1991), Killed by Charity (1994), Eggs and Ashes (1995), and The Land of the Giant Dwarfs and the live swan song Fired (both 1996). Since then, he has been a musical partner of Peter Vermeersch in many musical expeditions, both as a performer and as a producer, for example in A Group and the theatre production Weg (by Josse De Pauw). Together Vervloesem and Vermeersch produced the first LP by Antwerp rock group dEUS. Vervloesem has also released several solo LPs where he experiments with unusual instruments (e.g. shaking a crate of empty beer bottles as percussion) and unfamiliar sounds to create what are essentially quite simple songs. One of Vervloessem's main influences is revealed by a song on the 1994 release Home Made,Home Made CD cover, catalogue reference C7-006 consisting of one minute of silence in memory of Frank Zappa. But tellingly, the same album also contains a cover of John Barry's composition \\"Ski Chase\\", from the soundtrack of the James Bond film, On her Majesty's Secret Service. In 2002, Vervloesem released an album of cover versions of John Barry tracks. Playing style Vervloesem's guitar playing style has been associated with that of: Nick Didkovsky, Fred Frith, Zappa, Nels Cline, Joe Satriani, and Steve Vai.

Established in 1883, it has close ties with the all-boys Nelson College and has a private Preparatory School. Nelson College for Girls was one of the highest rankings school in the Nelson region for NCEA with an average of 71% of Year 13 students achieved NCEA Level 3 in 2005. (This compares with a National average of 51.2% and Decile 7 Girls' schools - 68.9%) The boarding house, Clarice Johnstone House is headed by Mrs. Barbara Symonds and caters for around 120 girls from years 7-13.  History  Nelson College for Girls is a single-sex state school in Nelson, New Zealand. The school was established in 1883, and its first principal was Kate Edger, who was the first woman to earn a university degree in New Zealand. As was expected at this time, Kate resigned on her marriage in 1890, and was succeeded as Principal by Beatrice Gibson, one of the well-known Gibson sisters, who were very influential in girls‚Äô education in the South Island at the turn of the 20th century. Gibson also resigned on her marriage, in 1900, and Althea Tendall took her place for a period of five years, followed by Margaret Lorimer from 1906 to 1926. Three of these early principals were graduates of Canterbury College, Christchurch, which came to an agreement with the school to enable pupils resident in Nelson, and enrolled at Nelson College for Girls, to receive university tuition from its staff. The pupils in Nelson were able to enrol in the same university classes as those available in Christchurch, sit the same examinations and receive the same qualifications. This arrangement continued until the 1920s. Throughout its history, the school has enabled its students to attain high academic success as well as promoting a sense of the importance of being a part of the community. During World War, many Old Girls of the school enlisted as nurses and served in theatres of war in a brave and admirable way. Having a strong sense of giving back to community continues today with the significant group of students who volunteer in the local community. The school has a boarding house which caters for a wide range of students from outside of Nelson. The main house is named after another principal, Clarice Johnstone, who was instrumental in setting up the hostel. It caters for around 120 girls from years 7 ‚Äì 13. The arts Music and arts are also very strong at the school, choirs, jazz band and orchestra and private tuition available for the musically inclined. The annual Arts Week organised by the Arts Committee is always a highlight in the year, presenting students from all over the school (even if not normally involved in the arts department) a chance to do fun artistic activities. The sports awards, house music event and weekly assemblies all provide chances for students to receive recognition from their peers for various achievements. Every week, they have a singing assembly. The arts committee chooses two or three for the girls to sing, they vary from cultural and traditional songs to jumpy, new hits. The whole school is very involved in the arts. Houses The school has five \\"houses\\" which divide the girls into groups for school competitions such as athletics, swimming, music, drama and academics. They are named after local landmarks, mountains, rivers and plains; Dun, Maitai, Maungatapu, Waimea and the boarding house, Whangamoa. Points are collected for each event and the end of the year overall winner is awarded with the Whangamoa Shield.

It took place from 15 to 18 March 1990. In 1988, Fran√ßois Mitterrand was re-elected President of France but the PS obtained only a relative majority in the National Assembly. Elected with a moderate program (for a \\"united France\\"), Mitterrand chose his former rival Michel Rocard, leader of the right-wing of the party, as Prime Minister. Furthermore, centrist politicians joined the cabinet. Lionel Jospin, the party's First Secretary since 1981, was appointed national Education Minister. Mitterrand wanted his former Prime Minister Laurent Fabius succeeded him to the head of the party. Fabius appeared as the heir chosen by Mitterrand. A coalition was created in order to prevent Fabius from being elected First Secretary. It gathered Rocard's supporters and a part of the Mitterrandist faction led by Jospin, comprising those members with a background in the grassroots of the party and a long history of membership. Their candidate, Pierre Mauroy, another former Prime Minister, defeated Fabius. During the Rennes Congress, Mitterrand wanted impose Fabius as First Secretary. For a second time, he was opposed by a Rocard-Jospin alliance. The Rennes Congress was marked by the violence in the Mitterrandist group which split between Jospiniens and Fabiusiens, the later group being those \\"high fliers\\" who had joined the party relatively recently.

Plot summary Bike messenger Jace Damon attempts to live under the radar in Los Angeles with his younger brother (Tyler, who has an IQ of 168). The two are raised by their mother, who does her best to remain anonymous. When she falls ill Jace takes her to the hospital, making sure that he is not associated with her. The mother dies, and her children cannot claim her body. Instead, Jace takes his brother to find a new place, deciding that the Chinese community would be the best for them; eventually an elderly Chinese businesswoman (Madame Chen) takes a liking to the pair of boys and gives Jace a part-time job and a place to stay. He also takes a job as a bike messenger, since he can be paid in cash for it. One night, Jace accepts a delivery just as he is about to go off-duty; it is a pickup from the office of one of L.A.'s sleaziest defense attorneys, Lenny Lowell. He is not happy about the late delivery since it is a wet miserable night, but the dispatcher tells him that everyone else has gone off duty, and he is the only one available. Lowell is extremely (despite his reputation) nice to Jace, giving him a good tip. When Jace approaches the delivery address, he finds an empty lot which makes him nervous, so he decides to abort the delivery. Before he can get away, a large black car comes racing towards him to run him down. He barely survives the collision and is forced to abandon his bike. On foot, he is able to elude his pursuer, but loses his delivery bag (but retains the package). Jace returns to the scene of the collision and is relieved to discover that he will only have to replace the wheel. He returns to Lowell's office, only to find it crawling with police; he learns that Lowell has been murdered. Jace does not trust police, so he leaves the scene. In a city fueled by money, celebrity and sensationalism, the slaying of a bottom-feeder like Lowell won't make headlines. So when LAPD's elite show up, homicide detective Kev Parker (assigned to Lowell's case) wants to know why. Parker begins a search for answers that will lead him to a killer‚Äîor to the end of his career. Because if there's one lesson Parker has learned over the years, it's that in a town built on fame and fantasy, delivering the truth can be murder.

Willie has changed many times, and currently, has an appearance that is heavily influenced by the team's Powercat logo. * 1947: K-State's first costumed mascot, \\"Sparky,\\" appeared at the September football game against Oklahoma A&M.; This was by Manhattan High student Andrea Simmons Andersen during halftime performing gymnastics for the crowd in a red-brown wildcat costume with black stripes and a tail. Lack of winning games resulted in fans replacing the young girl with a college student. She was to be the only female to be a K-State mascot. (First Generation) * 1960s: Fraternity members took responsibility of wearing the Willie Wildcat costume and cheering at games. The original K-State Willie costume, which debuted in 1964, was purple in color with large ears that somewhat resembled Mickey Mouse. (Second Generation) * 1967-1980: Sculptor Jim Hagan created a new, \\"meaner-looking\\" Willie head with coyote and wolf hair. (Third Generation) * 1980-1993: A second Willie head made in 1967 by Jim Hagan is used. * 1985: The \\"beefed-up\\" Willie appeared while still using third generation style head.

Additionally, Willie is known to wear outfits specific for special events such as a tuxedo, biker garb for Harley Day, Army Fatigues for Fort Riley Day, costumes for Halloween, and various other outfits for themed nights.  Powercat Logo  In 1989, the Powercat logo was introduced by football coach Bill Snyder, who wanted a new logo to change the image of a program known at the time as a chronic loser. Tom Bookwalter, a Kansas native and K-State art professor, created the logo, a stylized wildcat's head. In 1997, the current \\"21st Century\\" Willie was created. Willie has gray fur, with two white stripes to resemble the Powercat logo. This head weighs eleven pounds. Willie can be seen at various K-State sporting events, often dressed as an athlete. (Sixth Generation) Personality Willie is known to be tough but also mischievous. He is K-State's #1 fan. The student inside the mascot costume (whose identity is kept secret) changes every few years, and the persona of Willie has remained the same throughout. Willie has been known to crowd surf and he also does one push-up for each point on the board for K-State when the Wildcats score a touchdown or make a field goal at football games. He also leads crowds in his signature K-S-U chant in which he moves his arms in legs to form a 'K'-'S'-'U' then fist pumps to signal the crowd to yell \\"WILDCATS\\" 3 times in a row.

In the 1930s, the group became infamous for its decadent lifestyles and exploits amid reports of drug use and sexual promiscuity.Storm clouds over Happy Valley The Telegraph. 16 May 2009 The area around Naivasha was one of the first to be settled in Kenya by white people and was one of the main hunting grounds of the 'set'.\\"Naivasha, Kenya\\" (tourist information), go2africa.com, 2006, webpage: Go2A The colonial town of Nyeri, Kenya, to the east of the Aberdare Range, was the centre of Happy Valley settlers.\\"Cultural Safari\\" (concerning Aberdare & Happy Valley settlers), MagicalKenya.com, webpage:MK In the mid-2000s, descendants of the Happy Valley set appeared again in the news, thanks to the legal troubles of Tom Cholmondeley, the great-grandson of Lord Delamere. Some of the notable members of the Happy Valley set were: The 3rd Baron Delamere and his son and heir The 4th Baron Delamere; Denys Finch Hatton, his lover Baroness Karen von Blixen; Bror von Blixen-Finecke; Sir Jock Delves Broughton and wife Diana Delves Broughton; The 22nd Earl of Erroll; Lady Idina Sackville; Alice, Countess de Janze (cousin of J. Ogden Armour) and her husband Count Frederic de Janz√©. History According to Ulf Aschen, \\"Witty, attractive, well-bred, and well read, Happy Valleyites were relentless in their pursuit to be amused, more often attaining this through drink, drugs, and sex.\\" The height of the Happy Valley set's influence was in the late 1920s. The recession sparked by the 1929 Wall Street stock market crash greatly decreased the number of new arrivals to the Colony of Kenya and the influx of capital. Nevertheless, by 1939 Kenya had a white community of 21,000 people.  Location  The area around Naivasha was one of the first to be settled by white people and one of the hunting grounds of the hedonistic Happy Valley set. The area also includes Thomson's Falls.Happy Valley section in Vertical Land Geoffrey Buxton, the first colonial farmer in the area, had moved up from the arid Rift Valley with its meagre rivers and a relentless dusty wind that gave Gilgil its name. And so, after finding his ideal farming country, he called this new haven 'Happy Valley'.Juliet Barnes: The Ghosts of Happy Valley: Aurum Press Ltd (1 July 2013) Some members of the Happy Valley set lived in Gilgil, Kenya, just north of Lake Elementaita. The colonial town of Nyeri in Central Province, to the east of the Aberdare Range, was the centre of Happy Valley settlers. The town had the atmosphere of a sleepy English village, an impression fostered by the cool air and morning mists. Outside Nyeri is the Outspan Hotel, a colonial landmark which became a place of pilgrimage for the world's Scouts. A small cottage on the hotel grounds was the final home of Lord Baden-Powell and his wife, founders of the Scouting movement, and he is buried outside Nyeri. The cottage has a small museum dedicated to Baden-Powell's life and memory. In popular culture  The antics of the Happy Valley set were highlighted in books and films such as White Mischief, which dramatised the trial of Jock Delves Broughton for the murder of Josslyn Hay, 22nd Earl of Erroll; and The Happy Valley, Juanita Carberry's account of her adolescence and later involvement with the Delves Broughton case. A biography of Idina Sackville, The Bolter, by Frances Osborne, includes stories of the origins of the Happy Valley set and features many of its key characters. Sackville was married to Lord Erroll for several years, and they had a child together. The 1999 UK television mini-series Heat of the Sun looks at the fictional lives and crimes of Happy Valley dwellers. Most recently, British-American author Rhys Bowen has published a murder mystery cozy titled Love and Death Among the Cheetahs taking place in the valley. In 2019, Irish author Lucinda Riley fictionalised the lives of some well known members of the Happy Valley family in her penultimate novel of the Seven Sisters books, ‚ÄòThe Sun Sister‚Äô.  Notables  Some notable members of the Happy Valley set in Kenya, 1926. From left to right: Raymond de Trafford, Fr√©d√©ric de Janz√©, Alice de Janz√© and Lord Delamere. Although there is no actual definition of what constitutes a member of the Happy Valley set, it is generally agreed by writers that it refers to white colonials located in or around the area of the Wanjohi Valley, who were infamous during the 1920s‚Äì1940s period for a number of scandals, usually revolving around infidelity and drug/alcohol abuse. Some of the most notable members of that clique are the following: \\"Corpun ‚Äì Book Reviews Page 4\\" (description), \\"CHILD OF THE HAPPY VALLEY: A Memoir\\" (memoir), CorPun, Colin Farrell, January 2004, webpage: CP-Carberry. Hugh Cholmondeley, 3rd Baron Delamere One of the first British settlers in East Africa, Hugh Cholmondeley, 3rd Baron Delamere (1870‚Äì1931), K.C.M.G., is credited with helping form the Happy Valley set. Lord Delamere first travelled to East Africa in 1891 for lion hunting and returned yearly to resume the hunt. In 1894, he was mauled by a lion. As a result, he limped for the rest of his life. He is also credited for coining the term \\"white hunter\\". In 1896, he moved to Africa and eventually settled in Kenya. In 1906, he acquired a large farm, the Soysambu Ranch, which would eventually rise to . Lord Delamere is also considered to have contributed significantly to the development of Kenyan agriculture. He quickly became the unofficial leader of the white community in Kenya. He was active in recruiting settlers to East Africa,Hughes, Anthony John, East Africa: Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Penguin, 1969, p. 275 and deeply admired the culture of the local Maasai. There is a story of Delamere's riding his horse into the dining room of Nairobi's Norfolk Hotel and jumping over the tables.Barton, Fiona, The Curse of White Mischief, The Daily Mail, 23 September 2006 He was also known to knock golf balls onto the roof of the Muthaiga Country Club, the pink stucco gathering-place for Nairobi's white √©lite, and then climb up to retrieve them. At the outbreak of WWI, Delamere was placed in charge of intelligence on the Maasai border, monitoring the movements of German units in present-day Tanzania.Herne, Brian, White Hunters: The Golden Age of African Safaris, 1999, pp. 99 He married Lady Charles Markham (n√©e Gwladys Helen Beckett) in 1928. He died in 1931.Thurman, Judith, Isak Dinesen: Life of a Storyteller, MacMillan, 1999, p. 123 Josslyn Hay, 22nd Earl of Erroll A Scottish peer and notorious philanderer, Josslyn Victor Hay, 22nd Earl of Erroll (1901‚Äì1941) abandoned his diplomatic career in Great Britain and scandalised society when he eloped with a married woman, Lady Idina Sackville. The couple were married in 1923 and moved to Kenya in 1924. They became the unofficial 'king and queen' of 'Happy Valley' and their home, Slains (named after the former Hay family seat of Slains Castle), became a centre of social life, notorious for its orgies. Idina, Countess of Erroll, divorced him in 1929, because he was cheating her financially. Lord Erroll was already having an affair with married woman Molly Ramsay-Hill. The couple eloped. When Ramsay-Hill's husband found out, he hunted them down and famously horsewhipped Lord Erroll in public at Nairobi Railway Station. Erroll married Molly in 1930. In 1934, Lord Erroll joined Sir Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists (B.U.F.) and, on his return to Kenya a year later, became president of the Convention of Associations. In 1939, on the outbreak of World War II, Lord Erroll became a captain in the Kenya Regiment and accepted the post of military secretary for East Africa in 1940. In 1939, Erroll's wife Molly, Countess of Erroll, died from the effects of consuming a concoction of alcohol, morphine and heroin. In late 1940, Lord Erroll met Diana, Lady Delves Broughton, the new, glamorous and much younger wife of Sir Jock Delves Broughton, 11th Baronet. Lord Erroll and Lady Delves Broughton soon became lovers. Their romance was a very public one and they intended to elope. Delves Broughton reportedly gave his blessings. However, in January 1941, Erroll was found shot dead in his car in an intersection outside Nairobi. Although Delves Broughton was charged and tried, he was acquitted of the murder. Numerous books, films (including White Mischief) and articles have been written on the murder mystery and various theories have been argued; however, the murder remains officially unsolved. Lady Idina Sackville A British aristocrat, daughter of the 8th Earl de la WarrThe Genealogy of the Wallace Family and cousin of poet Vita Sackville-West, Myra Idina Sackville (1893‚Äì1955) scandalised society when she divorced her first husband Euan Wallace, losing the right to see her two sons, who were later killed while serving in World War II. Idina abandoned her second husband Captain Charles Gordon for her lover Joss Hay, the future Earl of Erroll, eight years her junior. Together, they moved to Kenya in 1924 and essentially pioneered the decadent lifestyle of the Happy Valley set. Idina became notorious for hosting wild parties, which included spouse-swapping and drug use. Stories were also told of how she often welcomed her guests in a bathtub made of green onyx and then proceeded to dress before them. After she and Erroll divorced, she married twice more. She died in 1955. Countess Alice de Janz√© Born Alice Silverthorne (1899‚Äì1941), she was a wealthy heiress from Chicago and Buffalo, New York, daughter of an alcoholic felt manufacturer and niece to magnate J. Ogden Armour. She lived in Paris since the early 1920s, together with her husband, Count Fr√©d√©ric de Janz√©. The couple first met Joss Hay, Earl of Erroll and his wife, Idina, when the latter two lived in Paris in the early 1920s. After the Hays moved to the Wanjohi Valley in Kenya, they invited the de Janz√©s for lion hunting, in 1925 and 1926. The de Janz√©s lived in a house next to the Hays for several months. Alice had an affair with Lord Erroll and later with Raymond de Trafford. When the de Janz√©s returned to Paris, Alice abandoned her husband for Raymond. Alice made international headlines in 1927, when she shot Raymond in a Paris railway station and then shot herself. It was later revealed she did this on account of her anguish, after Raymond told her he couldn't marry her. They were both hospitalised but survived; Alice was tried by a Paris court and got away with a four-dollar fine. When she returned to Kenya in 1928, she was forced by the government to leave the country as an undesirable alien. In 1932, she and Raymond married in France, but split almost immediately and later divorced. Alice later returned to the Happy Valley in Kenya. Depressive, alcoholic and addicted to morphine, she remained in Kenya until she committed suicide by shooting herself in 1941. Prior to her death, Alice had been considered as a suspect for the murder of Lord Erroll. Count Fr√©d√©ric de Janz√© A French nobleman from an old aristocratic family of Brittany, Comte (Count) Fr√©d√©ric de Janz√© was also famous in France for his career as a racing driver. Following an invitation from their friends, Joss and Idina Hay, he and his wife, Alice, first travelled to the Wanjohi Valley, Kenya, in 1925 and spent months there, hunting lions. Fr√©d√©ric had an affair with Idina, while Alice was having an affair with Joss. Fr√©d√©ric wrote a memoir, Vertical Land, in which he gives his impressions of several of the notable personalities of the Happy Valley set. He returned with Alice to Happy Valley in 1926, during which time Alice tried to elope with her new lover, Raymond de Trafford. The de Janz√©s divorced in 1927, in the aftermath of Alice's shooting scandal. Fr√©d√©ric died in 1933, of sepsis, aged 37. Kiki Preston Born Alice Gwynne (1898‚Äì1946), she was an American socialite, relative of the powerful Whitney and Vanderbilt families. Kiki and her second husband, Jeromy \\"Gerry\\" Preston (1897‚Äì1934) first moved to Kenya in 1926, after being offered land on the shores of Lake Naivasha by a friend. Kiki and her husband excelled as big game hunters. Kiki was also notorious for her drug use, especially her addiction to cocaine and heroin, and was one of the best clients of Frank Greswolde Williams, the chief drug dealer of the colony. She was nicknamed \\"the girl with the silver syringe\\", due to her habit of always carrying her syringe in her bag and publicly shooting drugs without regard for onlookers. Whenever she was out of supplies, she would send an aeroplane to pick up new ones. Kiki also had numerous affairs with men, including Prince George, Duke of Kent, whom she introduced to drugs, much to the dismay of the British royal family, which forbade them from seeing each other. Kiki is often alleged to have borne a child out of wedlock from her affair with Prince George, who later became publishing executive Michael Canfield, adopted son of Cass Canfield. Following her husband's death, Kiki gradually abandoned the farm and returned to United States. Her son, Ethan, was killed in the Normandy Landings. Kiki committed suicide in 1946, jumping out of the window of her apartment at the Stanhope Hotel in New York City. Raymond de Trafford Son of Sir Humphrey de Trafford, 3rd Baronet, Raymond Vincent de Trafford (1900‚Äì1971) was a British nobleman from an old Irish aristocratic family. A gambler, womaniser and alcoholic, de Trafford was a notable presence in the Happy Valley set during the 1920s, and had numerous lovers, including Alice de Janze and Kiki Preston. He once attempted to seduce Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester, but was repelled. De Trafford was once reported to be so drunk, he set some houses of Kenyans on fire one night. De Trafford was threatened by his family with disinheritance if he were to marry Alice de Janze. In 1927, after discovering the truth, Alice shot him and then shot herself, while in a railway station in Paris. Raymond survived and later tried to defend Alice in her trial. In 1932, he married Alice, but almost immediately deserted her (allegedly, because he feared her) and moved to Australia. In 1939, he hit and killed a man with his car while under the influence, and spent three years in prison for manslaughter. A year later, he filed for bankruptcy. Sir John \\"Jock\\" Delves Broughton A British aristocrat, Sir Henry John \\"Jock\\" Delves Broughton (1883‚Äì1942) moved to Kenya, together with his new wife, Diana Caldwell, thirty years his junior. Diana immediately began a very public affair with Joss Hay, Earl of Erroll. Broughton eventually conceded to the idea of Diana deserting him and marrying Erroll, due to a prenuptial agreement they had made, that she could abandon him if she fell in love with another man. However, Erroll was murdered in January 1941. Broughton was considered a major suspect. He was arrested by the police and tried for the murder of Erroll. Due to lack of evidence and to ballistic considerations, he was acquitted. Juanita Carberry, daughter of John Carberry (10th Baron Carbery), maintains that Broughton confessed the murder to her shortly after his acquittal. Diana quickly divorced Broughton. He returned to England, where he committed suicide by barbiturate overdose in 1942. Diana, Lady Delamere Born Diana Caldwell (1913‚Äì1987), she moved to the Happy Valley in late 1940, together with her new husband, Sir John \\"Jock\\" Delves Broughton, a Baronet with extensive landed estates in England. She almost immediately began a very public affair with the unofficial leader of the community, Joss Hay, Earl of Erroll. She planned to divorce Broughton and marry Erroll. Broughton supposedly gave his blessings. Erroll was discovered murdered in his car in January 1941. Broughton was charged with his murder but was acquitted in the trial. Diana stood up for her husband, but after the trial accused him of being the murderer and abandoned him. Following her divorce from Broughton, she married Gilbert Colvile in 1943, one of the wealthiest and most powerful landowners in Kenya and inherited much of his fortune. They adopted a daughter. Years later, Diana married Thomas Cholmondeley, 4th Baron Delamere, and increased her land fortune. For many years in the 1960s and 1970s and until the death of her lesbian lover, Diana lived in a three-way relationship with her husband and Lady Patricia Fairweather (daughter of the 2nd Earl of Inchcape). By the time of Delamere's death, she was possibly the most powerful white woman in Africa, dubbed the \\"White Queen of Africa.\\"  Leone, Cavaliere Galton-Fenzi  Leone, Cavaliere Galton-Fenzi was the founder of the Royal East African Automobile Association, REAAA, in 1919 and honorary secretary until his death on 15 May 1937. He was the first man to drive from Nairobi to Mombasa in January 1926 in a Riley. There is a monument to this effect on Kenyatta Avenue. In 1923, Galton Fenzi started negotiating for loan cars so that they could be tested under East African conditions. He received several vehicles, notably among them a Riley 12/50 from the Riley Motor Car Co. Ltd. of Coventry, which was used by Fenzi and Captain Gethin to pioneer a route from Nairobi to Mombasa in January 1926, a distance of 300 miles. He also pioneered the Nairobi ‚Äì Dar es Salaam to Malawi route, and the Nairobi- Khartoum route. The EA Standard of 1924 quotes: ‚ÄòGalton Fenzi is always doing things, and he does them so quickly the public has no time to recover its breath!‚Äô.  Others  Others included Gilbert Colvile, Hugh Dickenson, Jack and Nina Soames, Lady June Carberry (stepmother of Juanita Carberry), Dickie Pembroke, and Julian Lezzard. Author Karen Blixen (Isak Dinesen) was a friend of members of the group, and writer and pilot Beryl Markham frequently associated with the Happy Valley set.

Examples of this are the E-ZPass system used on most toll bridges, toll tunnels, and toll roads in the eastern U.S., as far south as Virginia, as far north as Maine, and as far west as Illinois; California's FasTrak; Florida's SunPass; Kansas's K-Tag; Oklahoma's Pikepass; Texas's TxTag (and within Texas, Houston's EZ Tag and Dallas's TollTag); Louisiana's GeauxPass; and Georgia's Peach Pass and Cruise Card. Many toll roads have implemented open road tolling which eliminates the need to stop at toll booths. Toll roads, especially near the East Coast, are often called turnpikes; the term turnpike originated from pikes, which were long sticks that blocked passage until the fare was paid and the pike turned at a toll house (or toll booth in current terminology). Origins of funding through toll In the mid to late nineteenth century, private toll road building was particularly active in the West including California and Nevada. In Nevada, over 100 private toll roads were laid out between the 1850s and 1880s, some of them nearly long. The owners included stage companies, miners, and ranchers who built the roads, at least in part, to attract business for their primary investments.David T. Beito and Linda Royster Beito,\\"Rival Road Builders: Private Toll Roads in Nevada, 1852-1880,* Nevada Historical Society Quarterly 41 (Summer 1998), 71-91. Interstate Highway System Typical Toll Concession P3 Structure as described by the Federal Highway Administration By 1956, most limited-access highways in the eastern United States were toll roads. In that year, the federal Interstate Highway System was established, funding non-toll roads with 90% federal dollars and 10% state match, giving little incentive for states to expand their turnpike systems. Funding rules initially restricted collections of tolls on newly funded roadways, bridges, and tunnels. In some situations, expansion or rebuilding of a toll facility using Interstate Highway funding resulted in the removal of existing tolls. This occurred in Virginia on Interstate 64 at the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel when a second parallel roadway to the regional 1958 bridge-tunnel was completed in 1976. Since the completion of the initial portion of the Interstate Highway System, regulations were changed, and portions of toll facilities have been added to the system. Some states are again looking at toll financing for new roads and maintenance, to supplement limited federal funding. In some areas, new road projects have been completed and later maintained with public-private partnerships funded by tolls, also known as build-operate-transfer systems. One such public-private partnership was the constructions of the Pocahontas Parkway near Richmond, Virginia, which features a costly high level bridge over the shipping channel of the James River and connects Interstate 95 with Interstate 295 to the south of the city. Toll avoidance A practice known as shunpiking (not to be confused with toll evasion, which is the non-payment of tolls at a toll booth or concealment of a toll RFID tag at a toll reader, both violations) evolved which entails finding another route for the specific purpose of avoiding payment of tolls. In some situations where the tolls were increased or felt to be unreasonably high, informal shunpiking by individuals escalated into a form of boycott by regular users, with the goal of applying the financial stress of lost toll revenue to the authority determining the levy. One such example of shunpiking as a form of boycott occurred at the James River Bridge in eastern Virginia. After years of lower than anticipated revenues on the narrow privately funded structure built in 1928, the Commonwealth of Virginia finally purchased the facility in 1949. However, rather than announcing a long-expected decrease in tolls, the state officials increased the rates in 1955 without visibly improving the roadway, with the notable exception of building a new toll plaza. The increased toll rates incensed the public and business users alike. In a well-publicized example of shunpiking, Joseph W. Luter Jr., head of Smithfield Packing Company, the producer of world-famous Smithfield Hams, ordered his truck drivers to take a different route and cross a smaller and cheaper bridge. Despite the boycott by Luter and others, tolls continued for 20 more years. They were finally removed from the old bridge in 1975 when construction began on a toll-free replacement structure.

In the 1970s, he was involved in a long-running and highly publicised battle with the New South Wales (NSW) government after his dismissal from the police service. Arantz claimed that he had been victimised for his whistle- blowing actions, which had exposed systematic police corruption. In 1971, while working on a computerisation program, the computer expert discovered that the NSW police service had been systematically under-reporting crime statistics for years. The obvious inference of this revelation was that police were trying to conceal corruption, which allegedly extended up to the Police Commissioner himself, and the widespread police involvement in organised crime. Arantz took his allegations to senior police but they were dismissed out of hand. Eventually Arantz, now recognised as one of Australia's pioneer \\"whistle-blowers\\", realised that Norman Allan (who had been Commissioner since 1962) was at least aware of the scheme, if not directly involved in it, and that he wanted to suppress Arantz's revelations. The frustrated Arantz created history when, through the journalist Basil Sweeney, he had official figures published in The Sydney Morning Herald showing reported crime in 1971 was 75 per cent above the figures for 1970. The difference was so huge that it could not be explained by a crime wave. An enraged Commissioner Allan began a vicious campaign to destroy Arantz's credibility. As a result, Arantz was suspended, forced to undergo a psychiatric assessment and, finally, dishonourably discharged from the force. It took him years to clear his name. Meanwhile, both Commissioner Allan and New South Wales Premier Robert Askin had retired (respectively in 1972 and 1975), avoiding the taint from the scandal. It was not until 1989 that Arantz and his claims were finally vindicated,\\"A year of shifts and reversals\\", The Sydney Morning Herald, 22 December 1989, page 8 by which point Askin and Allan were long since dead. In 1985, the Wran Government paid him $250,000. He was finally cleared by special legislation, allowing him notional reinstatement in 1989. With his victory behind him, Arantz retired to Dunedoo in mid-western NSW.

Their capital was Bardasir. Muhammad b. Ilyas Abu 'Ali Muhammad b. Ilyas was a member of the Samanid army and was of Sogdian origin. He supported the failed 929 coup against the Samanid amir Nasr b. Ahmad. After the rebellion failed he fled south, eventually arriving at Kerman in 932. He managed to extend his control over the northern part of the province, while the southern and eastern mountainous portions remained under the control of the local Koch and Baloch . Despite Samanid and later Buyid attempts to expel him from Kerman, he succeeded in maintaining his rule there for over thirty years. He acknowledged either the Samanids or the Buyids as his overlords but was effectively independent. In 967 he suffered a stroke and was eventually compelled to abdicate in favor of his son Ilyasa. Ilyasa b. Muhammad Ilyasa b. Muhammad quickly angered the neighboring Buyids under 'Adud al-Daula by arguing over some territory on the border of Kerman and Fars. Before invading Kerman, 'Adud made sure to win over members of Ilyasa's army. This strategy was effective; when he did invade and capture Bardasir, the bulk of Ilyasa's army deserted him. Control of Kerman was transferred nominally to 'Adud's son Abu'l Fawaris Shirzil, while 'Adud's general Gorgir (Kurkir) was given real control. Ilyasa fled to Bukhara, where the Samanids welcomed him, but he aroused their hostility by complaining that they would not help him retake Kerman. He was expelled from Bukhara to Khwarazm, while the governor of Khurasan seized the possessions of Ilyasa's that he had left in Kuhistan. In Khwarazm Ilyasa was stricken with sympathetic ophthalmia and he soon died. Sulaiman b. Muhammad In 969 or 970 Ilyasa's brother Sulaiman, who had fled to the Samanids before the Buyid conquest due to a quarrel with his father, convinced the Samanid amir Mansur b. Nuh to supply him an army to reconquer Kerman. His hope was that he could gain the support of the Koch and Baloch. Gorgir moved to stop them, and in the ensuing battle between Jiroft and Bam, Sulaiman, two of Ilyasa's sons, Bakr and al-Husain, and a large portion of the Khurasanian troops were killed. Al-Husain One more attempt by the Ilyasids to retake Kerman occurred in 975 by a nephew or possibly son of Muhammad, al-Husain. Al-Husain, learning of a rebellion in Kerman, traveled from Khurasan and took control of part of the rebelling forces. 'Adud al-Duala's vizier Abu'l-Qasim al-Mutahhar b. 'Abdallah was sent to restore order to the province; he defeated al-Husain in Jiruft and captured him. Nothing more is heard of him and his capture marked the definite end of the Ilyasids in Kerman.

The film was directed by Phillip Noyce, from a screenplay written by Shawn Slovo. Slovo's father, Joe Slovo, and mother Ruth First, leaders of the South African Communist Party and activists in the Anti- Apartheid Movement, appear as characters in the film, while her sister, Robyn Slovo, is one of the film's producers and also plays their mother Ruth First. Catch a Fire was shot on location in South Africa, Swaziland and Mozambique. Plot In South Africa in 1980, Patrick Chamusso, a young, apolitical man, is accused of carrying out a terrorist attack. Afrikaner police officer Nic Vos is in charge of locating the perpetrators of a recent bomb attack against the Secunda CTL synthetic fuel refinery, which is the largest coal liquefaction plant in the world. Patrick is unwillingly swept into Vos's investigation due to his inability to provide a satisfactory explanation for his whereabouts at the time of the bombing (he was actually having an affair with a woman not his wife). Eventually Patrick, his wife, Precious, and his family are tortured by Vos and his subordinates. Desperate, Patrick says that he is willing to confess to a crime he did not commit to protect his family. Vos concludes that Patrick is innocent, and orders his release. Fuelled by the anger at the injustices he and his family suffered, Patrick joins Umkhonto we Sizwe, the military wing of the ANC (the African National Congress‚ÄîSouth Africa's anti-apartheid movement) and becomes exactly what Vos had initially accused him of being. He attempts to execute a plan to attack Secunda, the oil refinery he used to work for, by first bombing its adjacent water supply facilities, and 15 minutes later triggering the main explosion within the refinery itself. This would allow the refinery's workforce to flee between the two explosions, and not be harmed. Also, the damage of the first bomb would reduce the possibility of successfully extinguishing the fire caused by the second, main explosion. Patrick succeeds in the first part, but the second bomb is discovered by Vos and deactivated. Patrick is arrested and sentenced to 24 years in prison, after his wife goes to Vos and tells him where Patrick is, because she fell for a simple trick in which Vos left photographs of Patrick talking to a female member of the ANC. Due to her unjustified jealousy, she sells him out. He is released early due to the abolition of apartheid. Precious, who has remarried, is waiting for him and apologizes, and Patrick forgives her and says he is sorry as well. Some time later, he sees Vos sitting out near a small body of water. He creeps over and sees that it is indeed Vos, and though a part of him wants to break Vos' neck, he decides that it is not worth it. He left Vos alone, and went on to remarry and take in over 80 orphaned children in South Africa to provide a home for kids who lost their families during the anti-apartheid struggle.

The design of the rifle ‚Äì initially the Rifle 7.62mm 2A ‚Äì began at the Rifle Factory Ishapore of the Ordnance Factories Board in India, soon after the Sino-Indian War of 1962.http://www.firearms.net.au/military/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=83&Itemid;=147 The Ishapore 2A/2A1 has the distinction of being the last bolt-action rifle designed to be used by a regular military force other than specialized sniper rifles. While they are no longer in service with the Indian military, the rifle is still used by the Indian police. Development Delhi Police officers march during Republic Day in 2009 with 2A/A1 rifles and mounted Pattern 1907 bayonets. Production of the 2A/2A1 started in 1962 after the SMLE Mk IIIs* was phased out of service with the Indian military. The Indian-made SMLE Mk IIIs are known as the Type 56, made between 1956 and 1965 although any rifles made in the latter are rare due to the transition to the 2A.http://rodandgun.netfirms.com/ishapore/RFI.pdf Externally, the Ishapore 2A/2A1 rifle is based upon (and is almost identical to) the .303 British calibre SMLE Mk III* rifle, with the exception of the distinctive \\"square\\" (10 or 12 round) magazine and the use of the buttplate from the 1A (Indian version of the FN FAL) rifle. The 2A was designed to allow the British Pattern 1907 (P'07) sword bayonet used on the SMLE MkIII to be attached. Other difference included the use of improved steel (to handle the increased pressures of the 7.62mm NATO round), and a redesigned extractor to cope with the rimless round. The original (2A) design incorporated the Lee‚ÄìEnfield rear sight which has graduations out to 2000 yards. The re-designated \\"Rifle 7.62mm 2A1\\" incorporated a more realistic 800 meter rear sight in 1965. The stock is recycled from the No. 1 Mk. III armory stock, with the addition of a cross screw forward of the magazine well. Some stocks were salvaged from existing surplus and show artificer repairs where rotted or damaged wood has been replaced. This repair is especially evident with the recoil draws (the area the receiver contacts when recoiling after the shot) that often failed over time due to the rifle being rack-stored butt down / muzzle up, which allowed oils and grease to migrate downwards into this critical area. The weapon was produced at a rate between 22,000 and 115,000 rifles annually, averaging 70,000 a year. Around 250,000 rifles were made in total before production ended in 1974.

Collins Scottish Clan & Family Encyclopedia. (Foreword by The Rt Hon. The Earl of Elgin KT, Convenor, The Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs). Published in 1994. Pages 276 - 277. History Origins of the clan The name Moncreiffe comes from the feudal barony of Moncreiffe in Perthshire. The lands of Moncreiffe take their name from the Monadh croibhe which is Scottish Gaelic for Hill of the sacred bough. The plant badge of the clan is the oak and this presumably comes from the sacred tree. Moncreiffe Hill dominates the south- east Perth valley and was a stronghold of the Pictish kings. This connects the clan with the lands of Atholl and Dundas, both of which were held by branches of the Picto-Scottish royal house. Albany Herald and chief of the clan Iain Moncreiffe (1919‚Äì1985) asserted that the coat of arms with the red royal lion on a silver shield were the colours of the house of Maldred, Regent of Cumbria and brother of Duncan I of Scotland. Thus indicating that they were cadets of Maldred's line. Maldred himself was a descendant of Niall of the Nine Hostages, king of Ireland. In 1248 Matthew Muncrephe received a charter from Alexander II of Scotland for lands in Perthshire. Sir John Moncref and William de Moncrefe were amongst the many Scottish nobles who pledged loyalty to Edward I of England. 15th and 16th Centuries Malcolm Moncreiffe the sixth Laird was a member of James II of Scotland's council and received from him a charter incorporating his Highland and Lowland estates into the barony of Moncreiffe. He died in about 1465 and was succeeded by his son, the seventh Laird who was James III of Scotland's chamberlain and shield bearer. The seventh Laird married Beatrix, daughter of James Dundas of that Ilk but was murdered some time before 1475 by Flemish pirates. The three main branches of the clan descend from the eighth Laird of Moncreiffe who died in about 1496. The Moncreiffes of Moncreiffe are the chiefly line of the clan. The principal cadets of the clan are the Baron Moncreiffs of Tulliebole. From the barons descend the Moncreiffs of Bandirran, from whom the Moncreiffs of Kinmonth and the Scot-Moncreiffs descend. During the sixteenth century one branch of the Clan Moncreiffe joined the famous Scots Guard of Archers for the king of France and established at least three noble French families. However the Marquis de Moncrif was one of the French nobles who met his end on the guillotine during the French Revolution. In 1513, Sir John Moncreiffe, the ninth Laird was killed at the Battle of Flodden, as was his cousin, John, Baron of Easter Moncreiffe. His son was William Moncreiffe the tenth Laird who supported the Douglas Earl of Angus and in 1532 was fined for refusing to attend the Court that condemned Janet Douglas, Lady Glamis to be burned to death as a witch, when her only crime was that of being a Douglas by birth. William Moncreiffe was later captured at the Battle of Solway Moss in 1542 and was imprisoned in the Tower of London. When he was released he embraced the Protestant religion and was one of the barons who subscribed to the Articles in the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1567. In 1544, the Clan Moncreiffe supported the Clan Ruthven in a clan battle against the Clan Charteris.Way, George and Squire, Romily. Collins Scottish Clan & Family Encyclopedia. (Foreword by The Rt Hon. The Earl of Elgin KT, Convenor, The Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs). Published in 1994. Pages 100 - 101. The Ruthvens held considerable sway over Perth from their Huntingtower Castle. In 1544 Patrick, Lord Ruthven was elected as Provost of Perth but at the intervention of Cardinal Beaton, Ruthven was deprived of the office and Charteris of Kinfauns was appointed instead. The city refused to acknowledge Charteris and barred the gates against him. Charteris along with Lord Gray and the Clan Leslie then attacked the town, however they were repulsed by the Ruthvens who were assisted by the Clan Moncreiffe. As a result Ruthven remained Provost of Perth until 1584 when William Ruthven, Earl of Gowrie was executed. 17th Century and civil war Sir John Moncreiffe the twelfth Laird and chief of Clan Moncreiffe was made Baronet of Nova Scotia in April 1626. However John was unable to support the king and signed the National Covenant in 1638. His son also called John personally raised a company of the King's Scots Guards by warrant of Charles II of England in 1674. This John was heavily in debt and in 1667 a charter was secured for a family agreement whereby the Barony of Moncreiffe was sold to Thomas Moncreiffe who was a direct descendant of the eighth Laird of Moncreiffe. However the Baronetcy of Moncreiffe passed to John's brother. In 1685, a second Moncreiffe baronetcy was created in which Thomas, now the fourteenth Laird was himself created a baronet by James II of England and VII of Scotland. Thomas later became Clerk of Exchequer in Scotland and baillie of the Regality of St Andrews. He commissioned a new seat at Moncreiffe which was the first major country house to be completed by Sir William Bruce in 1679. Clan chief and seat A new seat was built for the Chief at Moncreiffe, the first major country house completed by Sir William Bruce in 1679. It was the family seat until it was destroyed by fire in November 1957, claiming the life of Sir David Moncreiffe of that Ilk, 10th Baronet, the twenty-third Laird. This tragedy led to the chiefship of the great Scottish herald and historian Sir Iain Moncreiffe of that Ilk, 11th Baronet. Sir David‚Äôs sister, Miss Elizabeth Moncreiffe of Moncreiffe, was his heir, but declared that it was her wish that he be succeeded by her cousin, Sir Iain, the Baron of Easter Moncreiffe, while she retained the feudal barony of Moncreiffe. She built a modern country house on the site of the old seat which incorporates the doorway reclaimed from the ashes of the burned house. Sir Iain died in 1985 and the chiefship reverted to Miss Moncreiffe. On her death, the chiefship passed to Sir Iain‚Äôs younger son, the Hon. Peregrine Moncreiffe of Easter Moncreiffe -- his elder brother Merlin having assumed the name and arms of Hay on succeeding their mother Diana as Earl of Erroll and Chief of Clan Hay.

Career Neville was knighted sometime after 1426. In 1438, Bergavenny, as he was now styled, was a justice of the peace for Durham. He was a captain in the embattled Duchy of Normandy in 1449. His eldest son Richard was one of the hostages given to the French when the English surrendered the city of Rouen in that year. After the death of his first wife, he was summoned to Parliament in 1450 as \\"Edwardo Nevyll de Bergavenny\\", by which he is held to have become Baron Bergavenny. At the time, however, this was considered to be a summons by right of his wife, and so he was considered the 3rd, rather than the 1st, Baron. In 1454, he was appointed to the Privy Council assembled by the Duke of York as Lord Protector, along with his more prominent Neville kinsmen. He was a commissioner of array in Kent in 1461, and was a captain in Edward IV's army in the North the following year.

Mike began lessons on upright with Eligio Rossi then studies with percussionist/composer Warren McLendon. Although his father was primarily an upright bass player, he also owned a 1964 Fender Jazz Bass which Mike felt was the instrument he was meant to play. During this time Mike absorbed a number of influences ranging from jazz to rhythm and blues to blues to rock. After playing in a jazz group called Forerunner/Nuclei, Mike moved to New York in 1980 at the suggestion of the members of the Jazz Messengers. It was here that he began playing with blues legend Johnny Copeland and continued through 1989. While on the road with Copeland, he backed up Chuck Berry pianist Johnnie Johnson which led to Mike working with him off and on for the next several years. It was also around this time that Mike started gigging around the New York scene where he regularly played with future members of The Max Weinberg 7. In 1993, guitarist Jimmy Vivino called Mike about a group being put together by Max Weinberg to audition for the house band on what would become Late Night with Conan O'Brien.

Their shows often have themes; one show could feature a track-by-track rendering of The White Album; the next might feature all of the Beatles' psychedelic work; another will include a full survey of the band from its Cavern Club days through to Let It Be. The Fab Faux has also performed a show of post-Beatle solo material. The group was featured in a full-length profile on CNN that was broadcast worldwide. They also participated in a CD of original material by Beatles tribute bands, recorded in London at Abbey Road Studios and engineered and produced by Will Schillinger. The group has performed multiple times in Liverpool, England, where they played three shows each year from 1999 to 2005 for that city's annual \\"Beatle Week\\" festivities, including outdoor concerts for over 35,000 people on the Yellow Submarine and Let It Be stages. The band was featured in a full-page story in the August 11, 2005, issue of Rolling Stone magazine (page 22). Senior editor David Fricke wrote: \\"The Faux invigorate the artistry of even the Beatles' most intricate studio masterpieces with top chops and Beatlemaniac glee;\\" and the story's byline called The Fab Faux \\"The greatest Beatles cover band...without the wigs.\\" In an on-air interview (and accompanying print article) with National Public Radio's Ashley Kahn in January 2008, members of the band discussed their process of re-creating The Beatles' material for live performance; as well as an account of a brief conversation about the band between Will Lee and Paul McCartney. Notable appearances On February 9, 2007, the band appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman, marking a late night televised cross-over of sorts, as band member Jimmy Vivino was a featured player in the Max Weinberg 7, which is the house band for Late Night with Conan O'Brien. It was also the first time a tribute band was shown on The Late Show and the second act for which members of the CBS Orchestra, Will Lee and Tom Malone, performed as members of a guest band (Paul Shaffer had performed as part of Earl Scruggs and Steve Martin's bluegrass supergroup during that group's 2001 and 2005 appearances on the show). On March 28, 2007, the band performed on The Howard Stern Show for the second time. They performed \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)/A Day in the Life\\" from Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, \\"Penny Lane\\" and \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\". Stern stated during a replay of their performances that listening to them gives him chills. On May 8, 2008, at Madison Square Garden, the band appeared with vocalist Joan Osborne and Phish guitarist Trey Anastasio as featured performers, celebrating the 7th Annual Jammy Awards.Jammy Awards appearance at the 7th annual celebration On September 12, 2008, the band appeared on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, once again marking a \\"cross-over\\".Late Night with Conan O'Brien(TV series 1993‚Äì2009)Eva Mendes/Luke Russert/The Fab Faux On September 20, 2008, the band celebrated its 10th anniversary at a sold-out show in Radio City Music Hall.

He was one of the greatest world fencers, individual and by team; he was born and died in Havana. Biography Although Fonst was born in Cuba, he spent most of his youth in France, where he received his fencing education, and aged just 16 years old he entered the 1900 Summer Olympics which were being held in Paris. He entered the Men's √©p√©e event, which put him up against another 101 fencers from 10 other countries, in his first round group he came out top against the five fencers from France, so advanced into the next round, in the next round and again in a group of six fencers Fonst any managed to finish in third place but was still good enough to advance to the semi-finals, and again he would finish third in the group and so qualifying for the final. In the final, Fonst was up against seven French and one Argentine fencer, and against the odds (and the judges) Fonst won four of his six matches to win the gold medal and so became the first Cuban and first Latin American medalist on the Olympic stage. A few days later after his gold medal, Fonst competed in the Men's amateurs-masters √©p√©e which put the top four amateurs with the top four professionals at the Games, Fonst managed to win six of his seven contests and won the silver medal, his only defeat was against the French professional Albert Ayat who went on to win the gold medal. Four years later, Fonst was in St.Louis, Missouri, competing at the 1904 Summer Olympics, and within two days he won three gold medals, he retained his Olympic title in the Men's √©p√©e, and added the Men's foil title and under the Mixed team banner he won the Men's team foil event with fellow Cuban Manuel D√≠az and American Albertson Van Zo Post. Cuba didn't compete in the Summer Olympics again until 1924, which was again held in Paris, France. Now aged 40, Fonst again competed in the Men's √©p√©e but this time only managed to reach the semi-final, he also competed in the Men's team √©p√©e but they were knocked out of the competition in the quarter-finals. Fonst also competed at three Central American and Caribbean Games in 1926, 1930 and 1938 and won six more gold medals. He fenced often with George Worth, who later became an American Olympic medalist fencer, during Worth's two years in Cuba after fleeing Hungary at the outset of World War II. After his career as an active sportsmen Fonst became president of the National Olympic Committee for Cuba, as well as an adviser for the Department of Physical Education and Sports, which he served until he died from a diabetic coma in 1959, aged 76 years old.

Specifically, the commutation matrix K(m,n) is the nm √ó mn matrix which, for any m √ó n matrix A, transforms vec(A) into vec(AT): :K(m,n) vec(A) = vec(AT) . Here vec(A) is the mn √ó 1 column vector obtain by stacking the columns of A on top of one another: :vec(A) = [ A1,1, ..., Am,1, A1,2, ..., Am,2, ..., A1,n, ..., Am,n ]T where A = [Ai,j]. The commutation matrix is a special type of permutation matrix, and is therefore orthogonal. Replacing A with AT in the definition of the commutation matrix shows that K(m,n) = (K(n,m))T. Therefore in the special case of m = n the commutation matrix is an involution and symmetric. The main use of the commutation matrix, and the source of its name, is to commute the Kronecker product: for every m √ó n matrix A and every r √ó q matrix B, :K(r,m)(A \\\\otimes B)K(n,q) = B \\\\otimes A. It is much used in developing the higher order statistics of Wishart covariance matrices. An explicit form for the commutation matrix is as follows: if er,j denotes the j-th canonical vector of dimension r (i.e. the vector with 1 in the j-th coordinate and 0 elsewhere) then :K(r,m) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{r}\\\\sum_{j=1}^{m}(er,iem,jT)\\\\otimes(em,jer,iT). Example Let M be a 2x2 square matrix. \\\\mathbf{M} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\\\\\\\\\\\ c & d \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} Then we have \\\\operatorname{vec}(\\\\mathbf{M}) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} a \\\\\\\\\\\\ c \\\\\\\\\\\\ b \\\\\\\\\\\\ d \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} And K(2,2) is the 4x4 square matrix that will transform vec(M) into vec(MT) \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\cdot \\\\begin{bmatrix} a \\\\\\\\\\\\ c \\\\\\\\\\\\ b \\\\\\\\\\\\ d \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} a \\\\\\\\\\\\ b \\\\\\\\\\\\ c \\\\\\\\\\\\ d \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\operatorname{vec}(\\\\mathbf{M}^T) For both square and rectangular matrices of M \\\\text{ rows and } N columns, the commutation matrix can be generated by this generic pseudo-code, which is similar to an article at StackExchange.com and demonstrably gives the correct result though is presented without proof. for i = 1 to M for j = 1 to N K(i + M*(j - 1), j + N*(i - 1)) = 1 end end Thus the following 3 \\\\times 2 \\\\text{ matrix } A has two possible vectorizations as follows: : A = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 4 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2 & 5 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 3 & 6 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} , \\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\; V1 = \\\\mathbf {vec(A) } = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 4 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 5 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 6 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} , \\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\; V2 = \\\\mathbf{ vec(A^T) } = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 4 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 5 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 6 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} and the code above yields : K = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & 1 & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & 1 & \\\\cdot & \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\cdot & 1 & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & 1 & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & 1 & \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} giving the expected results : K^T K = KK^T =\\\\mathbf I_{6 \\\\times 6 } : K^T \\\\times V1 = V2 : K \\\\times V2 = V1 References * Jan R.

Football career  Early career  MacDonald played for the Millwall youth team before joining Charlton Athletic as a trainee, turning professional in August 1998. He made his Charlton debut on 3 January 2000, as a late substitute for Martin Pringle in a 3‚Äì0 win at home to Nottingham Forest. He started the FA Cup tie against Queens Park Rangers the following weekend, scoring the only goal as Charlton progressed to the fourth round. He made two further appearances as substitute that season and won the Charlton Young Player of the Year Award. He joined Cheltenham Town on loan in March 2001, scoring twice in seven games with both goals coming in the same game against Blackpool. He returned to the Charlton first team squad later that year and scored his first ever Premiership goal when scoring the late equaliser in the 1‚Äì1 draw with Newcastle United at The Valley. However, that was his last involvement with the Charlton first team and in February 2002 he joined Torquay United on loan, playing five games without scoring. In March 2002 he joined Colchester United on loan, but made just four appearances and scored one goal, in a 2‚Äì2 draw with Wigan Athletic, before returning to his parent club at The Valley. He was released by Charlton in May 2002 and joined Conference side Margate in August. After one goal against Forest Green Rovers and five appearances, the following month he moved to Conference rivals Stevenage Borough.  Crawley Town  In August 2003 he moved to Crawley Town, and after an injury-troubled start, went on to play a crucial role in the club winning the Dr Martens League Premier Division and with it, promotion to the Nationwide Conference for the first time in its history. His best spell saw him score nine goals in seven matches ‚Äì scoring in all seven. He was the side's leading scorer in the league, with 17 goals. He had the honour of scoring Crawley's first ever goal in the Conference, part of a brace that saw them beat Leigh RMI away from home 2‚Äì1. He scored seven goals in the first two months, but eventually lost his place and was loaned out to Weymouth in April 2005.  Gravesend & Northfleet  In May 2005 he moved to Gravesend & Northfleet and soon settled in as a regular in the Gravesend team and a regular on the scoresheet. His contract with Gravesend and Northfleet ended at the close of the 2006‚Äì07 season and put pen-to-paper on a two-year deal with Southend United, arriving at Roots Hall on a free transfer.  Southend United  During his time at Southend he scored just once in the league against Doncaster Rovers, but he scored a further four goals in cup competitions with a goal against Watford in the League Cup, a brace against Oxford United in the FA Cup and another goal in the FA Cup against Dagenham & Redbridge.  Brentford  He joined Brentford on 9 July 2008 for an undisclosed fee on a two-year contract. He scored 18 goals in his first season at the club, helping Brentford to win League Two. He was awarded the League Two Player of the Month award for February 2009. His first season was ended in March due to a shoulder injury; however, he bounced back to become Brentford's top scorer in the 2009‚Äì10 season. In his three-year stay at Brentford he scored a league goal every 2.7 games; 40 goals in 111 games at Griffin Park.  MK Dons  On 26 August 2011, Charlie MacDonald signed a two-year contract with MK Dons for a ¬£35,000 fee. MacDonald was the replacement for Sam Baldock, who recently left MK Dons to join West Ham United.  Leyton Orient  MacDonald signed for Leyton Orient on a free transfer on 12 January 2013. Oldham Athletic MacDonald joined Oldham Athletic on a one-year contract in July 2013, with the option of a second year, after Leyton Orient chose not to extend his contract. MacDonald's debut was against Stevenage FC in an epic match that ended 4‚Äì3 to Oldham Athletic, with MacDonald earning 2 penalties including the match-winner converted by Jose Baxter. MacDonald's first goal for Latics was a consolation header in a 2‚Äì1 defeat to Peterborough United at London Road. At the end of the 2013‚Äì14 season, the one ‚Äì year option that the club had on MacDonald's contract was not exercised, and thus he was released. During his time at the club he had made 30 league appearances, scoring 5 goals. Barnet MacDonald joined Barnet on 16 July 2014. He scored a penalty on his debut, a 5‚Äì0 away win at Chester. He was appointed captain of the side by manager Martin Allen. After scoring eight goals during Barnet's promotion winning campaign, MacDonald was not offered a new contract with the Bees. Boreham Wood MacDonald joined Boreham Wood on 15 July 2015. He scored only twice in all competitions in the first half of the season and was loaned to St Albans City in January 2016. Director of football Ian Allinson stated that \\"it hasn't quite clicked for Charlie in his time with us. He is a great guy who just wants to play football and now he's fit, he was not getting the game time with us that he had hoped for\\". Greenwich Borough Greenwich Borough in 2017. On 10 June 2016, MacDonald joined Isthmian Division One South side Greenwich Borough. He would spend a season and a half at the club, before financial constraints led to a number of players and staff leaving the club. Cray Wanderers On 10 January 2018, MacDonald signed for league rivals Cray Wanderers. He scored on his debut the same day, against VCD Athletic.

The aim of the act was to provide HBOS plc, a banking and insurance group in the UK, the legal authority to reorganise its subsidiaries into a simplified structure. It came into effect on 17 September 2007. Background HBOS plc is a banking and insurance holding company and was created on 10 September 2001 from the merger of the Governor and Company of the Bank of Scotland and Halifax plc. These two banks are the main UK subsidiaries of HBOS, although they themselves operate various other subsidiary companies. The Bank of Scotland was incorporated by an Act of the Parliament of Scotland in 1695, and operates under the authority of this Act and subsequent other Acts passed in 1873, 1920, 1954 and 1970. Halifax is a public limited company and was created in 1997 from the demutualisation of the Halifax Building Society. Aims of the Act The main aim of the Act is to simplify HBOS's operating structure, namely: * changing the legal status of the Governor and Company of the Bank of Scotland to a public limited company (Bank of Scotland plc); * transferring the assets and liabilities of HBOS's UK banking subsidiaries (Halifax plc, Capital Bank plc, and HBOS Treasury Services plc) to the new company ; * transferring the remaining assets of the Clerical, Medical and General Life Assurance Society to HBOS's subsidiary, Clerical Medical Investment Group Limited and dissolve the society. The bulk of the Society's assets were acquired by Halifax plc in 1997, although some residual assets were not transferred at that time. Bank of Scotland plc The Governor and Company of the Bank of Scotland was unusual in its legal structure, as it was a company formed under statute, the 1695 Act, and was governed under the provisions of that Act and successive Acts of Parliament relating to the bank. The most important was the Bank of Scotland Act 1920, which set out the bank's business objectives and its regulations. HBOS Group wished to restructure the bank into a public limited company (plc) governed under the Companies Act 1985, and transfer the assets and liabilities of its other UK subsidiaries with a banking licence (Capital Bank, Halifax plc and HBOS Treasury Service plc) to the new Bank of Scotland plc. By doing it could save the costs of maintaining four banking licences, and the need for four separate companies, each with their own board of directors. The transfer of assets and liabilities from one bank to another also requires the consent of the account holders. For institutions such as the Halifax, this would involve seeking the consent of millions of people, and would be impractical. Thus an Act of Parliament gives HBOS the statutory authority to transfer accounts without seeking individual account holder approval. The Act also allowed the company to retain the right to print banknotes.

Starring Anne Hathaway and Hugh Dancy, the film plays with the usual fairy tale genre. The film is a co- production between companies in the United States, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. Plot In the kingdom of Lamia, baby Ella of Frell is given the \\"gift\\" of obedience by misguided and obnoxious fairy godmother, Lucinda Perriweather; Ella is magically compelled to instantly obey any command she is given. On her deathbed, Ella's mother, Lady Eleanor, warns her not to tell anyone about the gift, for fear someone might use it to exploit Ella. Only Mandy, the household fairy, knows the secret. Years later, Ella's father, Sir Peter, marries wealthy socialite, Dame Olga, who dislikes Ella. Her spoiled daughters, Hattie and Olive, discover Ella's obedience and use it to humiliate her. Ella stumbles upon Prince \\"Char\\" Charmont, pursued by his besotted fan club, who invites her to his coronation ball, but Olga intercepts the invitation. Jealous, Hattie and Olive force Ella to cut ties with her best friend, Areida. Ella resolves to find Lucinda to undo her gift. Mandy lends Ella her boyfriend, Benny, whom she accidentally transformed into a magic book. Learning that Lucinda is attending a wedding in Giantville, Ella leaves home to find her. On her journey, Ella rescues Slannen, an elf who wants to be a lawyer rather than be forced to be an entertainer. They are captured by ogres who intend to eat them, but are rescued by Prince Charmont. He joins them as he intends to avenge the death of his father, King Florian, and Ella opens his eyes to the cruelty of the laws oppressing elves and giants enacted by Char‚Äôs paternal uncle, Sir Edgar, the acting ruler. They discover Lucinda has already left, and Char suggests visiting the castle‚Äôs hall of records to find her faster, which is overheard by Edgar's snake, Heston. After Ella performs \\"Somebody to Love\\" for the wedding guests, she and Char begin to fall in love. At the castle, Edgar learns of Ella's gift from her stepsisters. Knowing his nephew is in love with her, Edgar orders Ella to murder Char at midnight when he inevitably proposes to her at the coronation ball, and to keep this plan secret. Edgar reveals that he murdered Char's father, and the prince‚Äôs death will make Edgar king. Ella writes Char a letter, saying she must leave but cannot explain why. She has Slannen chain her to a tree, hoping to wait out Edgar's command, while Slannen recruits more elves and giants to protect Char. As night falls, Lucinda appears and Ella begs her to take back her gift. Offended, Lucinda insists that Ella remove the gift herself, unchains her, and gives her a fancy dress. Forced back to the castle, Ella stumbles into the ball. Char whisks her away to a secret hall of mirrors where he proposes. As Ella is about to stab Char, she sees her reflection and commands herself to no longer be obedient, freeing herself from the gift. Char notices the dagger, and Edgar has Ella arrested before she can explain herself. Benny, who was left in the hall of records and thrown out, is found by Slannen. Benny reveals Ella in the dungeon, and Slannen sneaks into the castle along with a band of elves, giants, and ogres, and frees her. Benny shows that Edgar has poisoned Char's crown, intending to kill him at his coronation. As Char is about to be crowned, Ella and the others crash the ceremony and a brawl with Edgar's soldiers ensues. In the scuffle, Mandy manages to turn Benny human again. As Char and Ella fight off the guards together, she confesses her love for him, and reveals Edgar's plot and his murder of Char's father, which Edgar denies. Heston almost fatally bites Char, but is kicked away by Ella and trampled by Char's fan club; Char takes this as evidence of his uncle's guilt. Edgar then denounces the prince, and attempts to proclaim himself king, but unknowingly puts on the poisoned crown and collapses. Soon after, Char and Ella are married, much to the envy of Ella's stepsisters; and Char toasts to a new era of equality among all citizens of the kingdom. Edgar is revealed to still be alive, but physically and cognitively impaired. The cast performs a final dance number of \\"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\\", before the newlyweds ride off on their honeymoon.

Production Hathaway, who first read the book when she was 16, says that there was originally a version of the script that was much closer to the book but that it didn't work as a film; she added that she prefers the way the movie actually turned out because it \\"makes fun of itself for being a fairy tale.\\" Levine states that the film is \\"so different from the book that it's hard to compare them,\\" noting the addition of new characters such as Sir Edgar and Heston, and suggested \\"regarding the movie as a separate creative act\\". Hathaway did her own singing in the film. Jimi Mistry, a British actor of Indian descent, said that he enjoyed playing a talking book in the film because it offered him the opportunity to do something different from his other roles. \\"You can't get less Indian than a talking book, and an American talking book, so it was great,\\" he said. Filming took place in Ireland at Ardmore Studios and on location in Wicklow. Locations included Luggala Estate, Killruddery House and Garden, and Kiltegan.http://wicklowmovies.ie/ella-enchanted/ Release Miramax Films released the film on April 9, 2004.

Although this exchange can take place in person, in the last decade it has increasingly taken place almost exclusively online through email, social media, and blogs. History  As far back as 1995, interactive marketing was seen as the future of e-commerce and digital advertising. By 1997, the Journal of Direct Marketing had re-branded to become the Journal of Interactive Marketing, which continues today. In 1999, Salesforce.com was founded, allowing marketers and salespeople to directly affect and guide potential customers through their company's sales process using Salesforce's cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) technology. With the advent of content marketing in the late 1990s and the founding of Hubspot in 2006, interactivity has seen a fundamental change from simple two-way communication to gamification and beyond. This particular type of interactive marketing is known as interactive content marketing, and many SAAS companies have been founded to respond to the need for new kinds of content and differentiation between competitors. Applications As interactive marketing relies on having a means of open communication with customers, social media channels have been a large part of this strategy, usually headed up by a company's marketing or customer success departments. The most common application for interactive marketing is using it as a lead generator in a sales funnel. Interactive marketing is nearly inextricably linked to content marketing, so companies can produce audience-relevant content that is shared many times, or \\"goes viral\\", and eventually establish themselves as an authority in their particular industry. Consumers tend to trust those that are designated thought leaders in their industry, so this strategy can bring in many inbound leads, coming through gated download pages, for example, that they are nurtured via more content created specifically for them off of the information they've previously shared.

The community, which initially was called Wardville, after local landowner C. M. Ward, was settled in 1862 by a small group of families who moved to Texas from Illinois. The name was changed to Illinois Bend in 1877, when a post office was located there. Early settlers were plagued by occasional raids from Comanche and Kiowa Indians who had been placed in the Leased Lands north of the Red River and on the eastern border of the Chickasaw Nation. In 1885 the settlement had a population of 300, two gristmills, a number of cotton gins, a school, and several churches. By 1910 the town had been bypassed by rail lines, and its population had fallen to 112. The population was sixty-eight by the late 1940s, when one business operated there. The community's post office closed sometime after 1930. By the late 1960s, when the last population figures were reported for the community, only fifty-one persons lived in Illinois Bend.

The method relies on the person's capacity to use imagery for purposes such as mental rehearsal. In some populations, it has been found that an imaginary reward can be as effective as a real one. Effective covert conditioning is said to rely upon careful application of behavioral treatment principles such as a thorough behavioral analysis. Some clinicians include the mind's ability to spontaneously generate imagery that can provide intuitive solutions or even reprocessing that improves people's typical reactions to situations or inner material. However, this goes beyond the behavioristic principles on which covert conditioning is based. Therapies and self-help methods have aspects of covert conditioning. This can be seen in focusing, some neuro-linguistic programming methods such as future pacing, and various visualization or imaginal processes used in behavior therapies, such as CBTs or clinical behavior analysis. Covert conditioning does not have a solid base of research. Therapeutic interventions \\"Systematic desensitization\\" associates an aversive stimulus with a behavior the client wishes to reduce or eliminate. This is done by imagining the target behavior followed by imagining an aversive consequence. \\"Covert extinction\\" attempts to reduce a behavior by imagining the target behavior while imagining that the reinforcer does not occur. \\"Covert response cost\\" attempts to reduce a behavior by associating the loss of a reinforcer with the target behavior that is to be decreased. \\"Contact desensitization\\" is intended to increase a behavior by imagining a reinforcing experience in connection with modeling the correct behavior. \\"Covert negative reinforcement\\" attempts to increase a behavior by connecting the termination of an aversive stimulus with increased production of a target behavior. \\"Dialectical behavior therapy\\" (DBT) and \\"Acceptance and commitment therapy\\" (ACT) uses positive reinforcement and covert conditioning through mindfulness. Although the therapies are quite similar in theory and practice, DBT is based on the cognitive psychology philosophy that thoughts and feelings are explanations of motor behavior, whereas ACT--rooted in behavior analysis-- views thinking and feelings as more behavior to be explained. Effectiveness Previous research in the early 1990s has shown covert conditioning to be effective with sex offenders as part of a behavior modification treatment package. Clinical studies continue to find it effective with some generalization from office to natural environment with this population.

Olympic fencing career Born in Brno, Flesch was 27 years old when he came second in the Austrian sabre championships in 1899, the next year he competed for Austria at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, in the first round of the sabre event he was one of the sixteen fencers to qualify to the next round, there he finished third out of a group of eight fencers so qualified for the final pool. In the final pool of eight fencers Flesch won four of his seven matches to finish in third place for the bronze medal, thus becoming the first Jewish fencer to win an Olympic fencing medal. He returned to Olympic competition at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, now aged 36 years old he again participated in the sabre event. In his first round he won his pool after winning all five match ups, unfortunately in the second pool of matches he could only win one against the other four fencers in his pool so was eliminated and was ranked 24th overall in the event.

During this tenure, Kraft, who had been a student of Paul Hindemith in Berlin, revived the practice of evening concerts of sacred works. Such concerts, collectively called Abendmusik, had been regularly given by his predecessors at the church, notably Dietrich Buxtehude and Franz Tunder; but they had ceased in 1810, mainly due to the dislocation caused to northern Germany by the Napoleonic wars. Kraft made numerous commercial recordings (primarily for the Vox label) during the LP era, most of which have been reissued on compact disc and as mp3s. As well as recording Handel's 12 organ concertos, he was among the first to commit to disc the entire solo organ music (or what was believed to be at the time) of Bach and Buxtehude. His discography also included pieces by more obscure German baroque musicians such as Nikolaus Bruhns. Like his younger contemporary Anton Heiller, Kraft also composed a fair amount (mostly organ music but also an oratorio called Christus), though as with Heiller, his fame as a performer completely upstaged his hopes of lasting renown as a creator. Once he retired in 1972 from the Marienkirche post, he apparently planned to write an opera,Christophorus Records 2005 but never finished any such work. He died along with 32 others when Amsterdam's Hotel Polen caught fire.

The missionaries preached the Gospel along the Yangtze River (Changjiang) in Hupeh and Szechwan. After 1949, during the Chinese Civil War when the Communist Party of China expelled Christian missionaries after gaining control of Mainland China, the LCMS missionaries planned to return to the United States. However, they decided to stay and start evangelical work in Hong Kong when they saw so many Chinese Civil War refugees in Hong Kong. Later, The Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod Hong Kong Mission was established.

History Riviera was founded in 1906 by Theodore Fredrick Koch, a land promoter. He purchased land from the King Ranch to sell to landseekers. He built a townsite along the St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway and named it after the French Riviera. Koch ran a train from Chicago to Riviera twice a month to bring more people to the area. Riviera witnessed growth in its first few years, but a drought hit the area in 1915 and then a terrible hurricane hit the area in 1916. When U.S. Highway 77 was constructed, it helped the economy get back on its feet. Now its economy depends on farming. It is also the last stop for about to Raymondville, going south, so its gas stations and restaurants are used by many travelers heading in that direction.

The book details the interactions of the three patients‚ÄîClyde Benson, Joseph Cassel, and Leon Gabor‚Äîeach of whom believed himself to be Jesus Christ. Synopsis Rokeach got the idea from an article in Harper's Magazine describing two women who both believed they were the Virgin Mary. After being assigned as psychiatric hospital roommates, one of the women recovered from her delusion as a result of conversations with the roommate and was discharged. Rokeach was also influenced by Cesare Beccaria's essay On Crimes and Punishments, concerning the subject of Simon Morin, who was claimed to have been potentially cured in a similar way. As a similar study of delusional belief systems, Rokeach brought together three men who each claimed to be Jesus Christ and confronted them with one another's conflicting claims, while encouraging them to interact personally as a support group. Rokeach also attempted to manipulate other aspects of their delusions by inventing messages from imaginary characters. He did not, as he had hoped, provoke any lessening of the patients' delusions, but did document a number of changes in their beliefs. While initially the three patients quarreled over who was holier and reached the point of physical altercation, they eventually each explained away the other two as being patients with a mental disability in a hospital, or dead and being operated by machines. The graduate students who worked with Rokeach on the project have been strongly critical of the morality of the project because of the amount of dishonesty and manipulation by Rokeach and the amount of distress experienced by the patients. Rokeach added a comment in the final revision of the book that, while the experiment did not cure any of the three Christs, \\"It did cure me of my godlike delusion that I could manipulate them out of their beliefs.\\" The book served as inspiration for the song 'Ypsilanti' on the Detroit band Protomartyr's debut album No Passion All Technique. Editions The Three Christs of Ypsilanti was first published in 1964. Rokeach came to think that his research had been manipulative and unethical, and he offered an apology in the afterword of the 1984 edition of the book: \\"I really had no right, even in the name of science, to play God and interfere round the clock with their daily lives.\\" The book was re-published by New York Review Books in 2011.

History According to Binoy Ghosh, the southern portion of Medinipur district, being adjacent to the Baleswar district of Odisha, had a long-standing cultural interaction with the neighbouring state. Moreover, as the area stands along the path of powerful political forces, it has been facing continual turmoil from the 12-13th century right up to the middle of the 18th century. Whenever local forces gathered some strength, peace reigned for a while, to be overwhelmed again and again by external powers. The Ganga dynasty and others who followed in ruling Odisha, had control over this area for a long time. They extended their limits of their empire to around Mandaran and Saptagram in Hooghly district on one side and up to the Damodar River on the other. In the period around the junction of the Hindu and Muslim periods of rule, the Odisha kings were a powerful force. The Muslims took time to consolidate their rule in Bengal, after their capture of Nadia district in the 13th century, and the independent kings of Odisha stood in the way of the Muslim advance. During the rule of Anangabhima Deva III (1211-1238), his general Vishnu, even ventured into the Rarh region and captured Lucknowur (later known as Rajnagar). Sultan Ghiasuddin Khilji recaptured Lucknowur and pushed back the invading forces. In a way, the turmoil of the period of changeover from Hindu to Muslim rule in Bengal, helped the Odisha kings to retain control over this area. The period of turmoil continued till the 16th century when the Mughals arrived on the scene.Ghosh, Binoy, Paschim Banger Sanskriti, , part II, 1976 edition, pages 125-135 , Prakash Bhaban, Kolkata. Daud Khan revolted against the Mughals in 1574 and fled from Saptagram to Dinkeshari (Keshiary). He was defeated by Todar Mal at Moghalmari in 1575. Apart from the Pathans and the Mughals, the Marathas also ruled in the area for some time. In the mid-18th century, Alivardi Khan, after a truce with the Marathas, had left Odisha, including the southern part of Medinipur, to them. There are many places, temples, tanks etc, around Keshiary, that bear the memory of the long rule of the Odisha kings over the region. Perhaps, the most prominent is the Kurumbera Fort. It was built by Kapilendra Deva of the Gajapati dynasty in the 15th century, possibly with a Shiva deul. The fort has been used by the Hindu kings, the Pathans and the Moghuls. Around 1691, it was made a Moghul military camp during the reign of Aurangzeb. The Shiva deul was demolished and a mosque was built. There still are (in 1952-53) signs of the foundations of a Hindu temple. There are clear signs of the pre-eminence of Shaivism and Tantra in the Keshiary region. This was because of the rule of Shashanka, a staunch Shaivite, who ruled long before the Odisha kings and whose empire extended, well beyond the southern areas of Medinipur, up to Ganjam in Odisha.

It was established in 1922 by the socialist activist Leland Stanford Chumley, who converted a former blacksmith's shop near the corner of Bedford and Barrow Streets into a Prohibition-era drinking establishment. The speakeasy became a favorite spot for influential writers, poets, playwrights, journalists, and activists, including members of the Lost Generation and the Beat Generation movements. After a major renovation, it re-opened in October 2016 as a reservations-only dinner restaurant, but closed in March 2020 as a result of the New York City Coronavirus lockdown, and a permanent closure was announced in July 2020. History Some features remain from Chumley's Prohibition-era history. Notably, the Barrow Street entrance has no exterior sign, being located at the end of a nondescript courtyard (\\"The Garden Door\\"), while the Bedford Street entrance, which opens to the sidewalk, is also unmarked.

It was established in October 2000, and currently operates two Airbus H145 aircraft. It is an independent charity that relies solely on the donations of individuals and organisations. The charity's original base is located at Nostell Priory, and has landing pads at various major hospitals around the region including Leeds General Infirmary, Hull Royal Infirmary and James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough. In October 2007, a second base was opened at Sheffield City Airport. The airport then closed at the end of April 2008, but a heliport facility was still provided for the use of the air ambulance and the South Yorkshire Police helicopter. In November 2010, the operational base for the Sheffield-based aircraft was moved to Bagby Airport near Thirsk. The second aircraft then made another move in March 2012 to RAF Topcliffe, which it shares with the 645 Volunteer Gliding Squadron. In 2012, planning permission was granted for a new operating base within the Nostell Priory estate for the Yorkshire Air Ambulance. The new site, including a hangar and aircrew accommodation, became operational in 2013. It replaced the facility at Leeds Bradford Airport. Operations MD 902 Explorer G-SASH in Derbyshire One helicopter (formerly Helimed 99, registration G-SASH) was based at a hangar at Leeds Bradford Airport (EGNM), which enabled servicing and maintenance to be carried out overnight, leading to even quicker response times in many parts of the county. Until 2016, the helicopter was located at Nostell Priory near Wakefield, where it had a newly renovated hangar and accommodation for crew, plus offices on site. The aircraft was then replaced by G-YAAC (Helimed 99), a new ¬£6million Airbus H145. The second helicopter (Helimed 98, registration G-CEMS) was originally based at Sheffield City Airport but moved in March 2012 to RAF Topcliffe near Thirsk. A spokesman for the charity commented: \\"What we're looking to do is provide the very best coverage for the whole of Yorkshire, for the five million population. The people of Yorkshire are better served with an aircraft at Thirsk and one at Leeds Bradford.\\" In 2016, the second helicopter was replaced by G-YOAA as part of the air ambulance's fleet renewal programme. Aircraft Airbus H145 G-YAAC landing at Leeds General Infirmary. The first helicopter was an MBB Bo 105, but in 2005 they started using an MD 902 Explorer. The Explorer was used extensively in an air ambulance capacity throughout the UK, but is gradually being phased out of service for renewal purposes. It has five rotor blades to ensure a smooth flight which can prove particularly beneficial for patients suffering head or spinal injuries. Twin turbine engines give it a cruising speed of , and skid landing gear allows it to cope with all types of terrain. Its compact dimensions allow it to land in confined spaces, yet it has room to carry one stretcher patient. It contains all equipment found on any front-line ambulance plus other special items. They have to land in a great variety of places: in one call, the only land near enough and flat enough to land on was the top of Whernside at . In 2016, the two existing helicopters were replaced by two new Airbus H145, which are registered as G-YAAC (based at Nostell Priory) and G-YOAA (based at RAF Topcliffe). The new H145 helicopters cost at total of ¬£12 million and offer lower operational and maintenance costs, as well as having night capability enabling longer hours of operation. They are expected to serve Yorkshire for the next 20 to 25 years. Cost and financing The Yorkshire Air Ambulance is a charity solely maintained by donations as it receives no form of official funding. Medical and paramedic staff, however, are provided by local hospitals and the Yorkshire Ambulance Service. The resident population and visitors to Yorkshire finance the air ambulance by donations, and various fund-raising events.

As opposed to smaller galago species it would climb, walk or run rather than leap. Subspecies Two subspecies of Otolemur crassicaudatus are recognised: *O. c. crassicaudatus *O. c. kirkii The IUCN considers the silvery greater galago as a third subspecies, O. c. monteiri. Other sources treat it as a separate species, though with \\"misgivings\\". The IUCN Red List assesses all three forms individually as Least Concern. Physical characteristics Illustration by Joseph Wolf This species has a rounded head with a short, wide snout, very large ears that can be moved independently and relatively large forward binocular eyes. They possess flat thickened skin pads at the ends of their fingers and toes for grasping limbs. The fingers are long and toes are flattened with flattened nails. The dentition formula is I 2/2, C 1/1, P3 3/3, M3/3. The thick fur is highly variable in color, depending on the subspecies: O. c. crassicaudatus exhibits dorsal pelage ranging from buff to gray extending to the face, flanks and limbs. The ventral fur is cream colored, and the tail has a darker tip. The hands and feet are darkened except on the digits. O. c. kirkii exhibits fur ranging from brown to grey on the dorsal surfaces. Ventrally, the fur is cream to yellow colored. The tail is usually light brown in this subspecies and the feet and hands lack darkening pattern. The brown greater galago has a head- and-body length of 26 to 47 cm (32 cm on average), a tail length of 29 to 55 cm, and a weight of 0.5 to 2 kg. The brown greater galago exhibits sexual size dimorphism with males being larger than the females. This is due to bimaturism, a longer period of growth in the male, on average 84.5 more days. While males and females galagos grow at the same rate, this longer growth period results in males averaging 16% more body mass than females. On average females weigh , and males . Distribution and habitat This species is common in Southern and East Africa. The largest populations are found in Angola, Tanzania, southern Kenya and the coast of Somalia. The brown greater galago lives in tropical and subtropical forest, preferring riverine and coastal forest, but it can also be found in the woodland savannah. The subspecies display different ranges: O. c. crassidautus is only found in the KwaZulu-Natal region. O. c. kirkii is found from Massangena north to Vila Coutinho, Mozambique and Malawi. Behaviour and diet The brown greater galago is a nocturnal, arboreal animal. During the day, it rests 5 to 12 meters above the ground in a dense tangle of creepers or in the hollow of a tree, rarely on an exposed branch. Female galagos will make nests, leafy platforms with foliage above to shelter their young. An individual galago may have several sleeping sites throughout its home range. At night, it emerges to forage for food. It moves quadrupedally through the trees or bush. This species is capable of short jumps from tree to tree when necessary. Its diet consists of fruit (like berries, figs), seeds, acacia gum, flowers, insects, slugs, and even reptiles, small birds and mammals. An individual galago on average spends 50% of its time each night traveling and only about 20% of its time foraging. It will often follow the same patrol pathway every night. Galago lifespan in captivity is 18 years or more. It is likely that life expectancy in the wild is lower. Territory and social behavior In Hluhluwe, South Africa This species is solitary, living in a home range of a few hectares; however, there is some overlap with other individuals. Males have territories that overlap with a few females and females may have home ranges that overlap, but male territories generally do not overlap. Males tend to have a larger territory than females. The territory is marked by urine and a scent produced in a gland in the chest. Social interaction generally occurs at sites of range overlap, sites of large gum resources or prime sleeping trees. Social play is also exhibited by juveniles, sub adults and adult females with juveniles. Social grooming is absent in the greater galagos compared to other primate species. It is instead filled with a behavior known as reciprocal licking to clean each other's fur. Vocal communication is very important in galago species with significant research systematically identifying types of calls including: raucous cry call, alarm call, contact rejection calls, distress call, infant call, mother call, advertising call. Reproduction morphology and behaviour Male galagos species possess very distinctive penile morphology that can be used to classify species.Perkin, Andrew. \\"Comparative penile morphology of East African galagos of the genus Galagoides (family Galagidae): implications for taxonomy.\\" American journal of primatology 69.1 (2007): 16-26. In O. crassicaudatus, the penis is on average 20 mm in length and increases in width towards the distal tip. The baculum clearly protrudes from the end. The glans and shaft are covered in single keratinised penile spines that point towards the body. During mating season which occurs in June, the female goes into estrus for approximately 2 weeks. She uses an advertising call to indicate her receptivity. Males approach and copulate repeatedly with the female and maintain intromission with the female for several hours. Mating patterns can be either monogamous or polygynous, often determined by the overlapping of host ranges and competing of males for best territories. Females typically give birth to 2 young, sometimes 1 or 3. The gestation period is on average 133 days. The female typically reaches sexual maturity by 2 years of age. Because of competition between males based upon size males usually reach reproductive age later than females. After birth, the mother leaves the young to forage and returns nourishing the young with nutrient rich milk. The juveniles typically remain with their mother until they reach close to sexual maturity.

It previously operated Pacific Blue Airlines, Tigerair Australia and joint-venture airline Polynesian Blue which were absorbed into Virgin Australia in December 2011. Its head office is located in South Bank, Brisbane. After being placed in administration in April 2020, it was purchased by Bain Capital in August 2020. History Former Virgin Blue Holdings logo, used until December 2011 Virgin Blue Holdings was formed in 2000 as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Virgin Group. In 2001, the then Air New Zealand owned Ansett Australia made a buyout offer of $250 million, which was publicly rejected by Richard Branson. In 2002, Virgin came to an agreement with Patrick Corporation to invest in the airline, to allow it to grow into a national airline, filling the void following the demise of Ansett Australia. In return for a 50% share of the company, Patrick invested $260 million. At the time, the view was that Patrick's shareholding would also allow the company to benefit from their new shareholder's political connections with the Howard Government, and also 'Greenwash' the company, allowing it to be described as Australian-owned. In 2003, Virgin Blue Holdings Limited was floated on the Australian Securities Exchange as Virgin Group sought to sell down its holdings. In early 2005, Patrick launched a hostile takeover for Virgin Australia Holdings. Patrick had been unhappy for some time with the company's direction. By the closure of the offer, Patrick held 62% of the company, giving it control. Virgin Group retained a 25% share. In 2006, Patrick Corporation was taken over by Toll Holdings, who maintained the ownership of shares in Virgin Blue Holdings. In 2008 the group announced a plan to distribute 98.3% of its shares in the company to its shareholders, thus making itself no longer a majority stakeholder. At the time Toll Holdings owned 62.7% of the company and had previously attempted to sell the share to no avail. In January 2011, Air New Zealand purchased a 15% shareholding in Virgin Blue Holdings. In June 2013 this was increased to 23%.Air NZ revealed as buyer of 3pc additional Virgin stake The Australian 6 June 2013 In September 2012, Etihad Airways purchased a 10% shareholding, this was later increased to 20%.

In April 2013, Virgin Australia Holdings completed its acquisition of regional airline Skywest Airlines and rebranded it Virgin Australia Regional Airlines. In October 2014, Virgin Australia Holdings announced plans to acquire the 40% stake of Tigerair Australia still held by Tiger Airways Holdings for $1, giving Virgin full ownership. Virgin would retain the Tigerair name and acquire the brand rights for Tigerair to operate to some international destinations from Australia. This acquisition was completed in February 2015 with tigerair becoming a fully owned subsidiary of Virgin Australia Holdings. In May 2016, HNA Group (part owner of Hainan Airlines), announced plans to purchase a 13% stake in Virgin Australia Holdings, which if approved will see existing owners' shares diluted. Air New Zealand's stake would become 22.5%, Etihad would hold 21.8%, Singapore Airlines 20.1% and Virgin Group 8.7%. A month later Air New Zealand sold 19.9% of VAH to Nanshan Group (majority owner of Qingdao Airlines); and in October, Air New Zealand sold its remaining 2.5% of VAH to Nanshan Group (majority owner of Qingdao Airlines). A month later Virgin Australia CEO John Borghetti wrote to the airline's pilots to reassure them the airline was in a sound financial position following publication of a report suggesting the airline was approaching insolvency. In March 2020, Virgin Australia halted all flights from international sector and in early April 2020, all domestic flights except for some services from Sydney to Melbourne due to the COVID-19 pandemic with 8,000 staff would be stood down.

Until early 2003 there were almost no further refurbishments done at the station. From 2003 to 2006, the platforms of the U-Bahn were widened to expand passenger capacity and were lifted by 4 cm to secure same-level boarding.

Common Sense Media Produced in a shoestring budget, and created in Bluth's garage, the film took four years to make and it was the first production of Don Bluth Productions, later Sullivan Bluth Studios.

After one of Banjo's stunts nearly gets his little sisters killed, Banjo's father prepares to whip the kitten and orders Banjo to retrieve the switch that will be used against him; Banjo instead runs away. He hitches a ride on a feed truck to Salt Lake City. In the big city, Banjo finds excitement at first, but soon he causes a massive traffic accident. He eventually retreats to the alleys, homesick and hungry. Another cat named Crazy Legs discovers Banjo and offers to help him find his way back home. During their search, Crazy Legs and Banjo come to a night club and enlist the help of more cats, including a singing cat trio (Cleo, Melina and Zazu). Later that night, while searching for the truck that could take him back to the farm, Banjo and Crazy Legs are chased by a pack of dogs. The pair barely escape and end up at the singing cats' home for the night. The next morning, Banjo wakes up and hears the driver of the truck out in the street. The cats rejoice and say many goodbyes before Banjo gets on the truck and eventually reunites with his family, who are happy to see him home.

Bluth had previously considered producing a short film of The Pied Piper but felt it was too large a production. He invited several other young animators to his house on nights and weekends to discover secrets of classical animation that he felt had been lost at Disney. The team worked in Bluth's garage. Bluth, and animators such as Gary Goldman, felt that Disney were only attempting to reduce the cost of films without paying attention to any artistic values. Eventually he resigned from Disney, along with 17 other animators, to finish this film and begin The Secret of NIMH. That bold walk-out caused a delay in the release of Disney's The Fox and the Hound that was in mid-production at the time. The story is partially based on one of Don Bluth's real-life experiences: While living on a farm, his family's cat, who lived in a woodpile nearby, disappeared, only to return to the farm several weeks later. During the filming stage, it was considered to become a feature-length film. It included a fleshed-out villain: a scarred, cigar- smoking cat named Rocko, who bears similarities to Warren T. Rat (from An American Tail) and Carface Caruthers (from All Dogs Go to Heaven). A termite that saves Banjo from a group of young children in Salt Lake City later became Digit in An American Tail. The tone of the film was darker and more akin to All Dogs Go to Heaven, and the climactic battle between Crazy Legs and Rocko was inspired by Disney's The Jungle Book. However, it was found that padding the film and adding darker elements did not strengthen the storyline, so the filmmakers kept the film as a short. It was considered to be made into a Christmas special and would have featured live-action scenes of Sparky Marcus talking to Santa Claus, and the animation would have more of a Christmas theme. Don Bluth recalled, \\"We forced Christmas into it, and it didn't work.\\" However, Crazy Legs briefly wearing the Santa Claus suit, the wintry landscapes, and decorations, are still evident in the final film. Don Bluth pitched this film, during pre-production, to then-studio head Ron W. Miller, as a future property for Disney. Seeing no value in it, Miller turned it down. The rain and snow effects seen in this movie are re-used live-action passes, thrown away by the Disney studio, in favor of cheaper and faster techniques. Although there has been interest in a revival of the film and characters, including a sequel Banjo Meets the King of the Goblins, Bluth has stated he wishes to leave the film behind. Spinoffs On March 11, 2009, a Dragon's Lair-esque version of the film under the name Banjo the Woodpile Cat Adventure Game was developed and released on the iPhone and iPod Touch by Iconic Apps.

It was directed and produced by John Ford, with Merian C. Cooper as executive producer and Cliff Reid as associate producer. The screenplay was by Dudley Nichols, adapted by Garrett Fort from the novel Patrol by Philip MacDonald. The music score was by Max Steiner and the cinematography by Harold Wenstrom. The film is a remake of a 1929 British silent film, also named The Lost Patrol, based on the same novel.Pallot and Monaco 1995, p. 499. The Lost Patrol stars Victor McLaglen, Boris Karloff, Wallace Ford, Reginald Denny, J. M. Kerrigan and Alan Hale. MacDonald‚Äôs story and the incident depicted in a 1936 Soviet film The Thirteen (set in the Central Asia desert during the Basmachi rebellion and directed by Mikhail Romm) inspired the 1943 film Sahara, featuring Humphrey Bogart. Sahara was remade In 1995, featuring James Belushi, and as a Western, Last of the Comanches, in 1953. Plot During World War I, the young lieutenant in charge of a small British mounted patrol in the empty Mesopotamian desert is shot and killed by an unseen sniper. This leaves the sergeant at a loss, since he had not been told what their mission is and has no idea where they are. Riding north in the hope of rejoining their brigade, the eleven remaining men reach a deserted oasis where they find water, edible dates, and shelter. During the night, one of the sentries is killed, the other seriously wounded, and all their horses are stolen, leaving them stranded. They bury the dead man and put his sword at the head of his grave. One by one, the remaining men are picked off by the unseen assailants. During the course of the film, the men talk and reminisce and fight‚Äîand deal with their situation. In desperation, the sergeant sends two men chosen by lot on foot for help, but they are caught and their mutilated bodies returned. One man, Abelson, suffering from heat exhaustion, sees a mirage and wanders into deadly rifle fire. The pilot of a British biplane spots the survivors, but nonchalantly lands nearby and despite frantic warnings is killed. After dark, the sergeant takes the machine gun from the aircraft and then sets the plane on fire as a signal to any British troops. Sanders, a religious fanatic, goes mad and walks into deadly fire. In the end only the sergeant is left and, thinking he too is dead, the six Arabs who have been besieging the oasis advance on foot. Using the machine gun from the aircraft, the sergeant kills them all. A British patrol which had seen the smoke from the burning plane rides up and the officer in charge asks the sergeant roughly where his men are. In silence, the sergeant looks toward their graves, six swords gleaming in the sun.

The novel was first adapted in 1929, by Walter Summers, who directed and wrote the film with Victor McLaglen‚Äôs younger brother Cyril in the lead role. The novel and movies focus on the psychological strain on a patrol of British soldiers when they become lost in the desert and surrounded by the enemy in Iraq. MacDonald himself served in the British cavalry during World War I in the Mesopotamian campaign. Richard Dix was cast to play the lead role in The Lost Patrol but he went into another film instead and Victor McLaglen replaced him. McLaglen himself was a World War I veteran, having served as a Captain (acting) with the 10th Battalion, Middlesex Regiment. Later he claimed to have served with the Royal Irish Fusiliers. He served for a time as military Assistant Provost Marshal for the city of Baghdad. McLaglen would work with Ford and Nichols again in The Informer. The three of them would win Academy Awards for Best Actor, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay. Already an actor in 1909, Boris Karloff attempted to enlist in the British Army during World War I, but was rejected due to his heart murmur. Wallace Ford and Reginald Denny, who played Morelli and Brown, had both served in World War I. Ford served in the United States cavalry, while Denny served as an observer/gunner in the Royal Flying Corps.

The film made a profit of $84,000. Film reviewer Paul Tatara claims, \\"Critics have alternately hailed The Lost Patrol as a flawed masterpiece and a failed experiment. In reality, it's probably a little bit of both.\\" In a contemporary review, Mourdant Hall of The New York Times, noted: \\"In The Lost Patrol, a picture now sojourning at the Rialto, women are conspicuous by their absence. It is an audible adaptation of Philip MacDonald's novel Patrol, which was exhibited here in silent film form several years ago. The present production is highly effective from a photographic standpoint, but the incidents are often strained.\\"Hall, Mourdant. \\"Movie review: The Lost Patrol (1934); Victor McLaglen, Reginald Denny, J.M.
