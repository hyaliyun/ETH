They are dwarf, deciduous perennials found from southwestern France to Spain. They have been cultivated since Tudor times in Britain, where they are now naturalized. Description It grows from rhizomes, or corms, which spread out into clumps of plants by stolons. Each corm usually sends out one long-tubed, goblet-shaped, or bell-shaped flower.José Luis Benito Alonso The bloom appears in autumn, or at the end of summer. It ranges from deep purple to lilac-purple with a paler throat and bright orange or yellow stigma. Then the linear, basal leaves, usually with a silvery central stripe, are produced in winter and spring following the autumn flowers, when the fruits appear. Taxonomy The Latin specific epithet nudiflorus refers to 'naked flower', this is due to the flower emerging before the leaves grow.Dr. Peter Jarvis It was published and described by James Edward Smith in 'English Botany' Volume 7 on table 491 in 1798. Distribution and habitat Crocus nudiflorus is native to various temperate areas of Europe, mainly southwestern France to Spain. Habitat It is found on roadsides, meadows and pastures. It often grows in pastures with other crocus species including crocus vernus subsp. albiflorus but it is often eaten by Wild boars. Uses It has been used in folk medicine as an anti-spasmodic, as an abortive and a sedative. Culture In 2002, it was voted by the public as the county flower of Nottinghamshire.

W. 1996. Niebla and Vermilacinia (Ramalinaceae) from California and Baja California. Sida Bot. Misc. 14 The epithet, fimbriata is in reference to the fringed branches of the thallus. Distinguishing Features Niebla fimbriata is recognized by the thallus divided into subterete branches from a central attachment point, reaching a height of 6 cm while spreading out as much as 10 cm across; the branches seem to bend backwards as they grow, producing a fringe of narrow branchlets along both margins of a primary branch, all pointing in the same direction—upwards, the whole branch with its branchlets resembling the lobster body on its back with the legs pointing up, but branchlets may also fall off, leaving the margins of the primary branch to appear with rudimentary crinkled branchlets. Black dot-like pycnidia are scattered and immersed along the margins and cortical ridges, or they may be conspicuous and abundant in some thalli. The cortex is rather thick in covering a partially hollow medulla (“subfistulose”), 100–150(-200) µm thick, olive green in color with smooth, reticulate or honeycomb-like areas. Apothecia are born on the narrow branchlets. Lichen substances are sekikaic acid, with triterpenes. Niebla fimbriata is relatively infrequent and widely scattered in its occurrence. At the type locality (mesa above San Antionio del Mar) it was found with two rare species of Niebla, Niebla pulchribarbara, Niebla versiforma, in association with common species, Niebla juncosa, Niebla josecuervoi, Niebla arenaria, and Niebla effusa on lava among a low mixed chaparral desert succulent transition scrub that included Agave shawii, Dudleya ingens, Ferocactus spp. Mammillaria dioica, Frankenia palmeri, Eriogonum fastigiatum, and Rosa minutifolia. This area is just north of Punta Colonet, not between Ensenada and Tijuana where there has been active Real Estate development. Taxonomic History Niebla fimbriata was first recognized in Baja California as a result of pursuing a lichen flora of that region; the type (biology) specimen was collected from San Antonio del Mar, 13 April 1990. It was later found in a lichen collection from Charis Bratt, now at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, reportedly collected on Santa Cruz Island. Niebla fimbriata exhibits geographical variation that is suggested to be related to hybridization. In the Channel Islands intermediates are evident with Niebla siphonoloba and on the Baja California peninsula with Niebla juncosa. A third variant that occurs near Punta Canoas is notably different in the branches densely covered with short isidia-like branchlets.World Botanical Associates, Niebla fimbriata, retrieved 21 Dec 2014, http://www.worldbotanical.com/niebla_fimbriata.htm#fimbriata It may be noted that Niebla fimbriata has been treated as belonging to a broad spectrum of morphological and chemical variation in Niebla homalea that includes many different species of Niebla and Vermilacinia.Bowler, P. and J.

It was built from 1863 to 1864. It is also known as Callender House. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Dr J Espie Dods This pair of semi-detached houses was built in late 1863 to early 1864. The building was probably erected by the first landowner Patrick Mayne (1856), or possibly for the second owner John McNab. The houses were advertised for rent on 30 January 1864, two days after registration in McNab's name, when they were described as \\"newly erected ... containing five rooms and kitchen\\". Subsequent owners included Joseph Buckle (1885-1910), a Primitive Methodist minister, who resided there for a period. From at least 1883 the building was known as Callender House. The property was purchased in 1910 by Dr Espie Dods, who moved there from 97 Wickham Terrace. His architect brother Robin Dods renovated and extended the property for its use as a private house and consulting rooms. This reflected the medico-residential character of Wickham Terrace at the time. In 1925 the property, which included adjacent land now occupied by the Liberal Catholic Church, was purchased by the Brisbane Theosophical Society. Minor alterations were carried out in 1925 by architects Hall & Prentice. Major conservation work was undertaken in 1986-87.  Description  The building comprises a pair of 1860s two-storeyed semi- detached brick houses with a 1912 timber extension to the side and rear. The original houses are small in scale without halls or corridors, and include attic and basement. Construction is of brick, with brick-on-edge construction on walls protected by verandahs. The main roof is gabled and clad in corrugated galvanised iron, concealing earlier shingles. The main facade has a two-storeyed timber verandah, reconstructed in 1986-87 to a 1910 photograph. The timber extension designed by Dods added new large rooms on two levels at the rear, and a single-storeyed kitchen wing. A new porch and hall gave entrance to both consulting rooms and house. The extension is clad with weatherboards, lined with timber and roofed with corrugated galvanised iron. There is no visible evidence of earlier kitchen wings. The fence in front of the extension is by Dods. Dods' enclosure of the front verandahs does not survive. In its present form the building clearly reveals the two major stages in its development.  Heritage listing  Theosophical Society Building was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The building is evidence of the former residential and medico-residential character of Wickham Terrace. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The former Callender House is one of the few remaining 1860s buildings in Brisbane and is a rare example of semi-detached housing which was relatively common in the 1860s. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. As an important example of the work of the architect Robin Dods, which demonstrates his skill in adapting an older building, the former Callender House is significant. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. As an important example of the work of the architect RS Dods, which demonstrates his skill in adapting an older building, the former Callender House is significant.

First proposed by the Liberal Democratic Party in 2001, it is formulated annually by the Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy. The initiative was abandoned by the Democratic Party of Japan in 2010, but revived in 2013 under the Shinzō Abe's administration. Background Before 2001, the Ministry of Finance exercised a strong influence over the compilation of the budget. The 86th Japanese Prime Minister, Yoshirō Mori, established the Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy (CEFP), modelled on the American Council of Economic Advisers, in January 2001 to strengthen the Prime Minister’s power over economic and fiscal policy. The council has up to 11 members, including the Minister of State for Economic and Fiscal Policy and the Governor of the Bank of Japan. It is chaired by the Prime Minister, with four or more independent financial experts. Outside experts are expected to give the council opinions that are not affiliated with the government. It also gives ministers and specialists an opportunity to be more influential in shaping economic policy. History At the end of February 2001, the CEFP proposed the creation of a as a step towards reforming the budget. This garnered opposition from the Ministry of Finance, concerned that the plan would be too detailed and ineffective. After Mori's resignation, his successor Junichiro Koizumi adopted the outline and proposed the first Honebuto-no hōshin (literally \\"big-boned policy\\") statement in June 2001. The Honebuto-no hōshin was designed to change the basic structure of politics, expressly in relation to the budget. Koizumi aimed at giving credibility to the contents of the budget. In Japan, the Ministry of Finance decides on a budget bill, traditionally reflecting the stance of the party in government. Koizumi considered this method inadequate to combat Japan's chronic deflation and wanted accountability to rest not primarily with government officials but rather with the members of the National Diet, the representatives of the Japanese people. Therefore, this policy agenda was put forward in 2001 by the Koizumi government. Honebuto-no hōshin is a policy term used by the Liberal Democratic Party, and was not used to describe the policies of the Democratic Party of Japan, which was in power from 2010 to 2012. It has been amended since then and, after a brief hiatus, Shinzō Abe's government announced a new ‘Honebuto-no hōshin’ in 2013. Major laws proposed by the Liberal Democratic Party have been discussed as part of the policy, for example, postal service privatization in 2001 and the trinity reform in 2003. The policy has had a strong influence on Abenomics.

It was designed by Samuel Drew and built from 1890s to 1940s by Samuel Drew. It is also known as Samuel Drew's House. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 24 November 2000.  History  This substantial timber residence with sub-floor, attic and tower, is understood to have been constructed in the 1890s, possibly in three stages, by American carpenters and boat-builders Samuel Drew and his sons Albert Edward and Frederick William, as their family home. As builders, the Drews erected many houses in the Sandgate/Shorncliffe district in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, during the peak of Sandgate/Shorncliffe's popularity as a seaside resort. They established a boat-building enterprise (constructing mostly pleasure craft) on Cabbage Tree Creek behind 20 Wharf Street, and were well known in local sailing circles. In the early 1850s, Brisbane commercial interests headed by Thomas Dowse and Brisbane Valley squatters John and David McConnel, promoted the establishment of a shipping centre at the head of Cabbage Tree Creek. They were in competition with rival claims for Brisbane and Cleveland as the principal port for Moreton Bay. The Village of Sandgate was officially surveyed in 1852, with the first sale of Sandgate town lots held at Brisbane in November 1853. Most of the land sold was purchased by the speculative investors behind the move to create a port at Sandgate. However, with Brisbane subsequently consolidating its position as the port for Moreton Bay, Sandgate languished. Landowner inaction, poor communication and strong Aboriginal resistance further retarded its development. Native police were stationed at Sandgate from late 1852 until 1862 to \\"disperse\\" the Bribie Island and Ningy-Ningy people, and facilitate non-indigenous occupation of the land in the Cabbage Tree Creek and Pine Rivers districts. With the removal of hostile indigenes, Sandgate/Shorncliffe developed slowly from the 1860s as a seaside excursion venue. By 1868, Cobb and Co was operating a twice-weekly service to Sandgate, and by the mid-1870s, three coach companies were offering services to the bayside resort. In the 1860s six hotels were established at Sandgate, although only two, the Sandgate and the Osborne, survived the decade. Also from the 1860s, a number of summer seaside residences and boarding or guest houses were erected, mostly along Eagle Terrace and at Shorncliffe. In the 1870s the permanent population increased, agitation for a rail link with Brisbane emerged, and municipal status was granted to the Borough of Sandgate in April 1880. With the opening of the extension of the railway from Brisbane to Sandgate in 1882 the permanent population grew rapidly, settlement spread along the flats, and weekend holiday-makers turned the township into a bustling seaside resort. The popularity of Sandgate/Shorncliffe as a seaside resort attracted day-trippers, seasonal holiday-makers and the Moreton Bay sailing fraternity, well into the 20th century. Samuel Drew, his wife Jane Harris and family emigrated to Australia from the United States of America in the mid-1880s, and by 1887 were resident in Sandgate. They had arrived during a colonial-wide economic boom and the local flurry of development which followed the opening of the railway line to Sandgate. Drew, who was a carpenter and boat-builder by trade, gained employment as foreman/carpenter at William Street's joinery works in Creek Street (now Palm Avenue), Sandgate, and in 1888 erected a house there, at the corner of Creek and Wharf Streets. William Street, reputedly formerly employed by Samuel Drew in America, was by this time a prominent Sandgate builder and contractor, who erected the Sandgate Post Office in 1886-87 and the Sandgate Baptist Church in 1887, as well as many houses in the Sandgate/Shorncliffe area. Early in 1886, he had purchased over an acre of land at the southern end of Creek Street (present Palm Avenue) on the western side of the street, adjoining Cabbage Tree Creek, where his joinery works were established. Street was a Justice of the Peace, a trustee of the local cemetery, and along with Edward Barton Southerden (first Mayor of Sandgate), was joint treasurer of the Sandgate School of Arts. By 1890 William Street was in partnership with William Krimmer as proprietors of the local skating rink in Sunday Street, Shorncliffe, erected 1888-89, and Samuel Drew was manager of the rink. During the widespread economic depression of the early 1890s, William Street was forced to liquidate his business affairs, his Creek Street property passing to his mortgagor, the Queensland National Bank, in 1893. The Drew family's 1888 house was located on this property, which in 1904 Albert Edward Drew, Samuel Drew's son, purchased from the bank. From 1889 the land west of Street's Joinery Works, along Wharf Street, was made available as residential allotments. Samuel Drew acquired title to (resubdivisions 96-98 of subdivision A of allotment 3 of section 15, Village of Sandgate) of unimproved land backing onto Cabbage Tree Creek and fronting Wharf Street, in May–June 1890. The eastern boundary of this land abutted William Street's Creek Street property. According to Samuel Drew's descendants, over the next decade the Drews built their family home here in several stages: firstly the main bedrooms and sewing room, then the central section (including the tower). A stables, complete with bell tower, and a large boatshed which housed the family's boat building business, were erected prior to the construction of the third stage of the house. It is not clear whether Samuel Drew actually lived in the Wharf Street house, as through the 1890s and early 1900s he was listed in the Queensland Post Office Directories at Creek Street, Sandgate. His Wharf Street property was transferred to four of his children in 1895: Mary Ellen, Elizabeth Jane, Albert Edward and Frederick William, then in 1905 (perhaps following Albert's purchase of the Creek Street property in 1904) back to Samuel, who on the same date nominated Mary Ellen and Elizabeth Jane Drew as trustees. When Samuel Drew died in April 1907, the funeral party left from his late residence, Creek-street, Sandgate. However, by 1911 his widow, Jane, was resident in the Wharf Street house, and his unmarried daughters remained there until their deaths in the mid-20th century. Boat made by Albert Drew at the opening of the Sandgate Sailing Club, 1922 The family understands that the sisters conducted a sewing and sail-making business from 20 Wharf Street for many years. An intriguing reference in the Queensland Post Office Directory of 1910-11 lists \\"Drews Sanatorium Home for Infants\\" at Sandgate – whether the Drew daughters ever used their home for this purpose has not been established. In 1918-19 Samuel John Drew (Samuel Drew's youngest son) built a house for himself at 19 Wharf Street. He and his brother Albert Edward, who continued to live in the 1888 house at the corner of Wharf Street and Palm Avenue (formerly Creek Street), maintained the family boat-building business from the boatshed at the rear of 20 Wharf Street until the 1930s depression, when Samuel leased his house and moved to Toowoomba. Albert and fellow boat builder and relative, Theo Woodhead, constructed the last boat in 1948, the year in which Albert died. Albert Drew, known locally as \\"Skipper\\" Drew, was a foundation member of the Sandgate Yacht Club, established in 1912, and was well known in local sailing circles. He won many sailing titles on Moreton Bay, in craft he had built himself. In 1947, prior to Elizabeth's death in 1950, Samuel John Drew and his son Oliver, also a builder, repaired and repainted 20 Wharf Street in white and several different shades of grey, believed to be the original colours. At this time they removed an early hedge and fence, replacing them with a smaller wrought iron fence. As the original timber gates were in poor condition, replicas were constructed in their place. In 1952, 20 Wharf Street suffered slight damage by a cyclone, and decorative fretwork across the ridge of the tower was blown away. Following Elizabeth Drew's death in 1957, the residence was transferred to Samuel John Drew and William Roy Drew (son of Frederick William Drew and Samuel Drew's grandson). As both had homes elsewhere, it was decided to convert the house into two flats to provide an income sufficient to pay the rates on what was effectively three blocks of land. In 1966 the flats were reconverted to a single house and offered for sale, passing out of the Drew family in 1967. The large boatshed on Cabbage Tree Creek and the stables were demolished subsequently. In 1987-88 the house was raised slightly and the undercroft, which previously housed a bathroom, laundry, and two water tanks, was converted into a lounge/dining room area. The place remains a private residence.  Description  Entrance, 1998 The former Drew Residence at 20 Wharf Street, Shorncliffe, is a substantial, high- set, single-storeyed timber residence with enclosed brick undercroft, attic and viewing tower. It is located at the southern end of Shorncliffe, on a property of over which slopes to Cabbage Tree Creek, providing boat access. The core of the house is rectangular in form, with gabled transverse wings at each end. There is a substantial brick chimney rising above the main roof, and the roofs of the side wings have galvanised iron ridge ventilators. Its most distinctive characteristic is a centrally-positioned Mansard tower over dormer rooms in the main roof, providing a central focus to the front elevation and a viewing room with vistas over Cabbage Tree Creek to Moreton Bay. Across the front of the main body of the building is a deep verandah. The Wharf Street elevation is particularly decorative, with paired, chamfered verandah posts with timber capitals and brackets; a decorative timber balustrade across the front verandah; decorative timber bargeboards and gable infills; an attic room with large dormer window over the front entrance and vestibule; and the elaborate timber viewing tower above this, complete with decorative bargeboards, spandrels beneath the guttering and acroteria. The rear elevation also has a central, decorative focus, where a dormer window and a room beneath this project from the core of the house, overlooking Cabbage Tree Creek. There are some later additions at the rear, and the undercroft has been enclosed with brick, which is screened from the front street by timber battens. Most of the windows are tripartite sashes, and have window hoods. Those facing the street incorporate a small gable in the window hood. The interior also has ornate decorative elements and fine joinery. These include a narrow staircase in the vestibule with turned timber balustrades and an ornate, carved newel post. The interior is lined throughout with wide tongue and groove boards. To dado height throughout most of the house the boards are diagonally placed, contrasting with the vertical boarding above. Architraves around all windows and doors have a carved quatrefoil detail to the corners, and doors throughout are timber panelled. The interior is painted throughout. In plan, the building is largely symmetrical. The centrally-positioned front door with sidelights and fanlights opens into a wide vestibule, off which a large room opens either side. That on the western side is the lounge room, which has an early timber fireplace surround incorporating an over mantle and a cabinet. The eastern room was formerly a dining room, and has ornate, hand-crafted timber architraves. Each of the side wings contains two rooms. Those in the western wing are separated by pairs of folding, panelled timber doors. Those in the eastern wing function as bedrooms and do not have connecting access. The side rooms which face Wharf Street are accessed both from the front verandah and from the large rooms which open off the vestibule. The two rooms which face the creek are accessed from rooms at the rear of the house. Beyond the vestibule a door opens into a room at the rear of the house which overlooks Cabbage Tree Creek, and from which two small rooms open, one either side, entered via arches, one of which is an early arch. These are the rooms which give access to the rear rooms in the side wings. The back room on the western side also has access to an external set of stairs, but the stair to the room on the eastern side has been removed. Later bathroom extensions at the rear are accessed from these rooms also. A narrow stair in the vestibule leads to two small attic bedrooms with arched doorways. From the front attic room another narrow stair leads to the tower viewing room. The enclosed undercroft, which is accessed via a recent stair in the room behind the vestibule, contains an living space, dining area and kitchen. The chimney at this level has a double fireplace, which is of recent construction, but utilising the base of the original chimney. A recent galvanised iron awning extends from the rear of the undercroft. The grounds have been altered, and the only evidence of the boatshed are two slipways, now covered by rapid mangrove re-growth. A recent timber jetty extends from the rear of the property into Cabbage Tree Creek, and later sheds replace the stables along the northwestern boundary of the property. A tennis court has been constructed in the southeast corner of the block along the creek frontage, and gardens have been built up in front of the house. Paved paths have been added and the driveway cemented. The front fence along Wharf Street has three ornate timber gates, one situated in front of the stairs leading to the front entrance, and the other two on the eastern side of the property which give vehicle access. These are 1947 replicas of the original timber gates.  Heritage listing  The former Drew Residence was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 24 November 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Constructed in the 1890s by American carpenters and boat-builders Samuel Drew and his sons as their family home, the place is important in illustrating the expansion of Sandgate as a town and seaside resort in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The place is closely associated with the Drew family and their contribution to local pleasure-craft construction in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, further illustrating the nature of Sandgate as a bayside community. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The former Drew Residence is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a substantial, late 19th century artisan's residence designed to impress, and of large timber sea-side homes in the Sandgate/Shorncliffe area in general, including in the design a tower room with views over Cabbage Tree Creek to Moreton Bay. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The place exhibits a range of aesthetic characteristics, including the setting of the house adjacent to Cabbage Tree Creek; the scale, form, and materials employed; the decorative external timberwork; and the quality of the interior detailing, particularly the well- crafted joinery. The place makes a significant contribution to the streetscape, and is a local landmark.

It was launched by the U.S. Air Force (USAF) in support of Hmong guerrillas raised by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). As the guerrillas were being pressured by enemy troops pushing to within ten kilometers of their main bases, the aerial campaign was planned to cause a pullback by the pressing communists. As the first well-targeted aerial campaign in Laos, Operation Raindance's 65 strikes per day gained such great results that it was extended indefinitely. Even after its \\"ending\\" on 7 April, the interdiction continued; eventually, it would be dubbed Operation Stranglehold. In all, it was the most successful Lao air strike operation to date. Among enemy losses to air were two tanks, two BTR-40 armored cars, 32 other vehicles, 28 antiaircraft guns, 28 bunkers, and six gun positions. Bombing caused over 1,500 secondary explosions of munitions, and destroyed over 2,000 storage caches. In one spectacular case, a cavern full of munitions exploded and burned for 16 hours. The Hmong who followed in the path blasted by the bombers captured and destroyed 300 tons of medical supplies. They ruined a 1,000 bed medical facility they found hidden underground, along with operating rooms and X-ray machines. The three light battalions of guerrillas withdrew in the face of the imminent arrival of four heavily armed People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) battalions. However, the advantages gained in Raindance would shortly be nullified by the communists' first-ever rainy season offensive. Overview After World War II, France fought the First Indochina War to retain French Indochina. Following the French defeat, the Kingdom of Laos gained its independence with Laotian neutrality established in the 1954 Geneva Accords. When France withdrew most of its military in conformity with the treaty, the United States filled the vacuum with purportedly civilian paramilitary instructors.Castle, pp. 7–12, 15–18. A North Vietnamese-backed communist insurrection began as early as 1949. Invading during the opium harvest season of 1953, it settled in northeastern Laos adjacent to the border of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.Dommen, pp. 30-34. As the Laotian Civil War flared, the CIA established a secret guerrilla army in the Plain of Jars. Interposed between the communist settlement around Xam Neua and the Royal Lao Government in Vientiane, the Hmong military irregulars fought to hold on to their traditional territory, and to preserve Laos.Warner, pp. 44–47 After the failure and defeat of Operation Pigfat, the communists had overrun the Plain of Jars to within ten kilometers of the guerrillas' main base at Long Chieng.Warner, p. 264. Background Hmong General Vang Pao not only suffered the reverses of his failed offensive, and the loss of a forward airfield at Muang Soui; his defensive position was soon further weakened by Vietnamese communist attacks.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 207–208. The communist wet season offensive was unprecedented in Laos. Now, faced with the possibility of a final guerrilla defeat, American Ambassador William H. Sullivan and Lao Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma loosened the restrictive rules of engagement inherent in the Operation Barrel Roll bombing campaign.Conboy, Morrison, p. 209. For the first time, the CIA, the Embassy air attaché and USAF planners jointly planned a strike package of 345 targets, complete with supporting documentation on aerial photographs.Anthony, Sexton, p. 298. Operation The USAF proposed a three-day bombing campaign against communist sanctuaries on the eastern Plain of Jars. It was posited that the enemy would withdraw back to protect their bases, thus relieving the pressure on the Hmong. A request for 80 sorties per day was lodged with the air force. Sixty sorties per day would be allocated to direction by Raven Forward Air Controllers; twenty would strike the enemy lines of communication, Route 7. Approval came for 65 missions daily. Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma lifted most bombing restrictions on the Plain of Jars.Anthony, Sexton, p. 298. The USAF initiated Operation Rain Dance on 17 March 1969 with immediate success. The sanctuaries having been previously held off-limits for air strikes, the communists did little to hide or disguise their supply depots. By the close of 18 March, so many secondary explosions and petroleum fires were reported that Seventh Air Force decided to continue the campaign \\"as long as resources are available, lucrative targets exist, and weather permits\\". By the close of 20 March, USAF had flown 261 sorties; the Royal Lao Air Force added 43 T-28 strikes. Bomb damage assessments reported included 486 secondary explosions of munitions, 570 buildings and 28 bunkers destroyed, 288 fires, six gun positions, and a 105mm howitzer. By 25 March, 192 of the original 345 targets had been systematically destroyed. After the interdiction strikes began, the Hmong irregulars moved south from the Plain of Jars on 23 March. Some guerrillas emerged from nearby Lima Site bases to cut Route 7; failing that, they settled for sniping at enemy resupply. Other Royalist forces threatened another communist supply line, Route 4. Forces Armées Neutralistes operating in the hills around Muang Soui were poised on the Lima Site 19 mountaintop position southwest of it by 30 March. Simultaneously, Neutralist forces pushed out from Muang Soui.Conboy, Morrison, p. 210.Anthony, Sexton, p. 300. The USAF deemed Raindance such a success they extended it until 7 April. By that date, 730 air sorties had struck the communists. Bomb damage assessment reported amounted to 1,512 storage caches struck, resulting in 765 secondary explosions from munitions and petroleum products. General Vang Pao now regained the confidence in air power that had been shaken in Operation Pigfat when his air strike allotment was slashed. Operation Raindance was the most successful aerial campaign flown in Laos to date.Anthony, Sexton, p. 300. Aftermath Continuing success Even as Raindance closed down, the flow of air power continued. With 150 fresh targets added to the remainder of the original target package, an allotment of 60 strike sorties per day was requested. Vang Pao had an ongoing promise of 50 USAF air strikes per day to support his guerrillas. The air actions continued through April, with great results. On 21 April, a Bullpup missile detonated a cavern storing fuel and munitions; the near-simultaneous eruption of a village about a kilometer away proved they were linked via tunnel. The cave complex would burn and explode for 16 hours, while the village disappeared.Anthony, Sexton, pp. 300–301. Vang Pao moved three battalions back into a fertile rice growing area, the Muong Ngan valley. Next, he received reinforcements from the Royal Lao Army. With the 103rd Bataillon Parachutiste (103rd Parachute Battalion) added to the irregulars, the combined force moved down from their hill position to Phonsavan on 29 April. In the ruins of the town smashed by artillery and air strikes, they found two BTR-40 Armored Cars, 18 other vehicles, 12 37mm antiaircraft guns, and a 75mm howitzer, which they destroyed. Continuing through town two kilometers to the northwest, on the north side of Route 4 they uncovered a cave complex crammed with pre-positioned communist supplies. Behind barrels of rocks barricading cave entrances against air attack, they found 300 tons of medical supplies. Another cave contained hospital beds for 1,000 patients. Still another contained over a mile of supplies within it; as the cache was too big to ruin, local Buddhist monks were convinced to lay a curse upon it so the superstitious Pathet Lao would not reclaim the goods.Ahern, p. 315. There were operating theaters; one had a pair of X-ray machines. Air America flew in a cargo of varied explosives to destroy the goods.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 210–211. The 1,000 Hmong troops occupied Phonsavan for the first time since 1962; they did not have to fire a shot.Anthony, Sexton, p. 301. Withdrawal Within two weeks, road watch reconnaissance teams began to report heavy inbound communist traffic. By mid-May, it was known that three PAVN battalions were en route from Vietnam with orders to retake Muang Soui. Enemy troops were also being withdrawn from their probe against the guerrilla main bases to pressure the Hmong guerrillas. A pincer attack on Phonsavan was threatened, with prongs poised south and northeast of the town. On 21 May 1969, the PAVN 174th Regiment knocked the irregulars from their perch on the hill north of town. The next day, one company of the paratroopers tried to recapture the hill while the other held the town. On 23 May, the PAVN overran Phonsavan and the paratroopers withdrew, having suffered 200 casualties. However, even as Vang Pao gave back some of his gained ground to his enemies, the USAF followed up on Raindance with Operation Stranglehold.Conboy, Morrison, p. 211. Operation Stranglehold Vang Pao intended to cut Route 7 during his withdrawal; he ordered guerrilla forays against the road from Bouamlong, San Tiau, and Sam Hong Hong. Stranglehold was a five-day air campaign to cover the Hmong retreat. The USAF devoted 50 of its 90 daily Barrel Roll flights against 75 targets. Selected targets were better hidden and defended than the Raindance targets, but it was believed their destruction would have a longer impact on events. In the event, 68 of the designated targets were struck; bomb damage reported included 296 secondary explosions of munitions and 212 fires. Two tanks, 14 trucks, and 16 antiaircraft guns were also destroyed. When the guerrilla sweep was successfully completed by the end of May, the communists reclaimed the lost ground. However, Muang Soui was saved from assault; the USAF claimed the credit. With monsoon rains drenching the Plain, communist resupply lines were expected to be bogged down. In past rainy seasons, air operations supporting the Hmong against the communists had occurred during breaks in the weather. However, in mid June 1969, the communists launched their first ever wet season offensive, Campaign Thoan Thang. It circled behind the Hmong positions and used a tank-supported attack to conquer Moang Soui on 27 June.Anthony, Sexton, p. 302. The Hmong were left facing an enemy that now was being supplied by an all-weather road, Route 7; the communists were still poised to strike.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 212–213.

It was designed in the office of the Queensland Colonial Architect and built from 1886 to 1887. It is also known as Sandgate Post and Telegraph Office. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 February 2005.  History  The two- storeyed Sandgate Post and Telegraph Office was erected in 1886-7 to a design prepared in the office of the Queensland Colonial Architect. A post office had operated at Sandgate since 1864, on Eagle Terrace near Palm Avenue. In the early 1880s a new site in Bowser Parade, closer to the railway line that had reached Sandgate in 1882, was purchased for £800. In June 1885 the Post and Telegraph Department requested that the Department of Public Works prepare plans for a new post and telegraph office building for Sandgate, to cost no more than £2,000. It is likely that the design was produced under the supervision of John James Clark, Colonial Architect from 1883 to 1885. Tenders were called in March and April 1886, but the design proved too expensive. Fresh plans were prepared under the supervision of Clark's successor, George St Paul Connolly, Queensland's first locally born and trained Colonial Architect (1886–1891). These plans were further amended to reduce costs and tenders were called in June–July 1886. A contract was let to local Sandgate builder William Street, with a price of £2,025. It is thought that the bricks for the construction were supplied from Leopold Fiedler's brickworks in Roghan Road, Zillmere, beside Cabbage Tree Creek. The new post and telegraph building, uncommonly substantial for what later became a suburban office, reflected government confidence in the booming economy and the importance of Sandgate both as a popular seaside resort and, increasingly, as a residential commuter district. Sandgate had its own local government (Borough of Sandgate) at that period and was not officially a \\"suburb\\" of Brisbane until the establishment of Greater Brisbane on 1 October 1925, but the railway enabled residents of Sandgate to commute daily to work in Brisbane. Sandgate Post Office in final stages of construction, circa 1887 The building opened as a post and telegraph office on 7 May 1887, with residential accommodation for the postmaster on the first floor, a dining room, post and telegraph offices and public area on the ground floor and a detached service wing housing kitchen, servant's quarters and wash house. The exterior brickwork was colour- washed originally, but has been painted since 1894. The layout was innovative, the central public area with an entrance porch either side becoming a principal feature of late 19th and early 20th century Queensland post offices. Along with post and telegraph offices constructed at the important commercial centres of Fortitude Valley (1887) and South Brisbane (1889-1890) it was one of only three substantial, two-storeyed brick post offices constructed in metropolitan Brisbane in the late 19th century. The Woolloongabba Post Office, also a substantial two-storeyed brick building, was erected in 1905. It was designed by the Queensland Government Architect's office for the Australian Government, which had assumed responsibility for post and telegraph communication following the federation of the Australian colonies on 1 January 1901. A telephone service was established in the Sandgate Post and Telegraph Office in 1898 and a telephone exchange was installed in 1907. The exchange was removed to a new building . After the second world war the first floor verandahs were enclosed with fibrous cement sheeting and casement windows and from 1981 the upper floor was used for office purposes. The exterior was restored in 1983-1984 and the interior was refurbished in time for centenary celebrations of the 1887 opening. The building continued to function as a post office until , when it was sold to private enterprise. Its renovated exterior continues to make a substantial contribution to the townscape of central Sandgate. The building was operated as the 4017 Bar and Grill for a number of years, taking its name \\"4017\\" from the postcode for Sandgate. However, by 2014, it was under new management and renamed the Chandelier Bar & Restaurant.  Description  The former Sandgate Post and Telegraph Office is a rectangular, two-storeyed painted brick building with Italian Renaissance stylistic elements. It rests on concrete foundations and has a hipped roof of corrugated iron with acroteria and gablets at either end. Dominating the front elevation is a projecting gabled portico, with the words Sandgate Post Office in low-relief beneath the first floor windows. Originally this read \\"VR 1887\\", VR being the abbreviation of Victoria Regina as the building was constructed during the reign of Queen Victoria. Front verandahs to either side of the portico are ornamented with chamfered timber posts, a timber frieze on the lower level and fretwork brackets and cast-iron balustrading on the upper floor. These details were recreated in the 1983-1984 restoration to as close to the original as possible. A double rear verandah with formerly the same detailing, remains enclosed. The interior has been modified and refurbished. The detached timber service wing to the rear remains, but has been altered substantially. Also at the rear are two later, single-storeyed brick additions. One is an attached extension constructed to house the telephone exchange. The other is a more recent, detached, rectangular building which served as a postal depot. It appears to have been erected in the 1980s following re-subdivision of the site in 1978 and replaces a longer timber building extant by 1953. Both additions employ rooflines and exterior finishes similar to those of the 1886-1887 building. The former Sandgate Post and Telegraph Office stands isolated on the corner of Bowser Parade and Rainbow Street and dominates the vista west along Eagle Terrace and Seymour Street. It forms part of an historical grouping that includes the adjacent Sandgate war memorial and the nearby former Sandgate Town Hall.  Heritage listing  Sandgate Post Office was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 February 2005 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former Sandgate Post Office, erected in 1886-1887 as a post and telegraph office, is important in demonstrating the pattern and evolution of Queensland's history. The building survives as an expression of government \\"boom\\" era confidence; of the popularity of Sandgate as both a seaside resort and as a commuter residential district from the 1880s; and of the important role of the post and telegraph services in the Queensland community and economy at this period. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The building is a substantial former post and telegraph office of a type more usually found in regional centres. It remains substantially intact and is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of its class of cultural places: two-storeyed late 19th century brick post and telegraph offices. These characteristics include: the form (two-storeyed), materials (brick), planning (upstairs residence for the postmaster and downstairs offices including a large central public space with two entrances) and design (classical motifs and detailing). The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The place is significant for its landmark quality, intactness and contribution to the Sandgate townscape. Located in the centre of the Sandgate commercial precinct, the place contributes to an historical grouping that includes the adjacent war memorial and the nearby former Sandgate Town Hall. The place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period. The place is important for having established a precedent for subsequent late 19th century and early 20th century Queensland post and telegraph office layouts, demonstrating creative achievement.

She became India's first female train driver in 1988. She drove the first \\"Ladies Special\\" local train for Central Railways when it was first introduced in the four metro cities by Mamata Banerjee the then Railway Minister, in April 2000. A momentous event in her career was on 8 March 2011, on the International Women's Day, when she became Asia's first woman train driver to drive the Deccan Queen from Pune to CST, through difficult but scenic topography, where she was greeted by the then Mayor of Mumbai Shraddha Jadhav, at CST, the headquarter of Central Railway zone. It was Surekha's dream-come-true as she drove one of the prestigious trains of the Central Railway, which carries the female of name; the Mumbai-Pune Railway Pravasi Sangh (association) strongly supported her to run this train. However, a commonly heard comment on her driving is that \\"Women don't drive railway engines'\\". Early life Surekha was born in Satara in Maharashtra on 2 September 1965 to Sonabai and Ramchandra Bhosale. Her father late. Ramchandra Bhosale was a farmer; she is the eldest of his five children. She had initial schooling at Saint Paul Convent High School, Satara. After completion of schooling, she took admission for vocation training and then studied for a Diploma in Electrical Engineering from the Government Polytechnic at Karad in the Satara district of western Maharashtra She wanted to continue her college studies to get graduate degrees of Bachelor of Science (B.Sc) in mathematics and Bachelor of Education (B.Ed) to become a teacher, but a job opportunity in the Indian Railways put an end to her further studies. Professional life Yadav was interviewed by the Railway Recruitment Board, Mumbai, in 1987. She was selected and joined the Central Railway as a trainee assistant driver in 1986 at the Kalyan Training School where she trained for six months. She became a regular assistant driver in 1989. The first local goods train that she piloted was numbered L-50, which runs between Wadi Bunder and Kalyan when she was assigned the task of checking the running condition of train's engine, the signals and all related works. She was then assigned to work as a goods train driver in l996. In 1998, she became a full-fledged goods train driver. In 2010, she became a ghat driver on the Western Ghat railway line. For driving a “ghat loco”, in the ghat (hill) section of the Western Ghats, she received special training to run the twin-engined passenger trains that negotiate the hills of western Maharashtra. She said that \\"Because I was the only woman, they were curious whether I could do it or not\\". As an assistant driver, she drove shunters. She was promoted as motor-woman in 2000. In this capacity her occupying motorman's cabin in the train attracted attention and there were admirers seeking her autograph. In May 2011, she was promoted as an express mail driver. She is currently teaching in Driver's Training Centre (DTC) Kalyan, as Senior Instructor. When she joined service with the Indian Railways, she realized that she was the first woman to drive a railway train in India, which till then was totally a male bastion. Other women were inspired by her, and as of 2011 there were 50 women locomotive drivers who were operating suburban trains and goods trains, and also as shunters or assistant drivers. For pursuing a career as train driver in Mumbai, she said that she received full support from her family, friends and colleagues and has not experienced any discrimination as a woman. Even though she does not know how to drive a two-wheeler or a four-wheeler vehicle, she is happy driving a 9 or 12 car rake of a suburban train which carries 4,500 people. She is dedicated to run trains safely with full presence of mind, as the risks faced could be in the form of breakdowns due to mechanical problems, chain-pulling, rasta rokos (a form of protest in India to stop trains or block roads), and people or animals crossing the track suddenly, which need right thinking, prompt and quick action. She has no record of train accidents. She has so far driven many types of trains such as local suburban trains, ghat trains with twin engines (hill section train on the Western Ghat), goods and mail express trains., and she works for ten hours a day. Her ambition is to drive a long distance passenger train. She has also participated in activities to check eve-teasing. In 1991, Surekha acted in a television serial titled \\"Hum Bhi Kisise Kum Nahi (we are second to none)\\". She has received adulation from several organizations for her unique role as a woman train driver. She has given interviews several times on national and international TV channels. Personal life She got married in 1990 to Shankar Yadav, who is a Police Inspector in the Government of Maharashtra. They have 2 sons, Ajinkya (1991) and Ajitesh (1994), both being students of Engineering in Mumbai University. Her husband is supportive of her work.

It is located in the eponymous forest reserve about 5.5 km west-southwest of the town of Wiehe. This village was a clearing settlement and was first mentioned in the records in 1226. The village belonged to St. Peter's in Mainz and had its own church. But as early as around 1480 the place is described as abandoned. On the site of the village there are only a few signs of settlement in the shape of uneven ground. The vicinity of the site is also interesting: only two kilometres to the east lie the remains of Rabenswalde Castle; this was the main residence of the lords of Rabenswalde, a branch of the family of the counts of Kevernburg. The castle was besieged and destroyed around 1350 after the Rabenswaldes became robber knights during the Thuringian Counts' War. It is possible that settlements around the castle were also attacked and destroyed at the time the castle was slighted.

He played for Palace as an amateur, and was on the books of Sunderland before finishing his career with Darlington. He began his career as a centre forward and finished as an outside right. Life and career Morton was born in Consett, County Durham. He began his football career as a teenage amateur with Crystal Palace, and scored three goals from five Third Division South appearances in the 1953–54 Football League season. He returned to the north-east of England and spent a season with First Division club Sunderland, but never appeared for their first team. In May 1955, he signed for Third Division North club Darlington, where he soon established himself as a first-team regular. In the fourth round of the 1957–58 FA Cup, Ron Harbertson, Dave Carr and Morton scored at Stamford Bridge to give Darlington a three-goal lead over Chelsea, league champions only three years earlier, but they let the lead slip. Unfit for the replay because of injury, Morton's place went to Tommy Moran, who scored twice and created two more to inflict an embarrassing defeat on the First Division side. In a match against local rivals Hartlepools United at Christmas 1958, he was knocked unconscious and broke bones in his neck when opposing full-back Jack Cameron fell on him after a tackle. He underwent emergency surgery and was in an upper-body cast for four months. Although able to resume his career the next season, he retired in 1961, having made more than 200 appearances for the club in all competitions. In March of that year, he shared a benefit match with Darlington's appearance-record holder Ron Greener.

A midfielder or defender, Clark went on to play non-league football for Nuneaton Borough, Crawley Town and Hinckley Town. Life and career Clark was born in Coventry. He was associated as a junior with Wolverhampton Wanderers, and joined hometown club Coventry City under the YTS scheme. He turned professional in September 1986, and was a member of the Coventry squad that won the 1986–87 FA Youth Cup. He made his first-team debut at the age of 20, on 5 November 1988, playing the whole of a 1–1 draw at home to West Ham United in the First Division, but never established himself in the first team. He made 20 League appearances over three years, and spent a few weeks on loan at Darlington of the Third Division, before moving to another Third Division club, Shrewsbury Town, on a free transfer in December 1991. At the end of his first season, Shrewsbury were relegated to the fourth tier, renamed Third Division after the Premier League split from the Football League. He stayed for a season at the lower level, and made 56 league appearances in all. In the 1993 close season, he signed for Third Division Hereford United, where he played under the management of Greg Downs who had been a teammate at Coventry. In his first season, he appeared regularly, but less so in 1994–95, at the end of which he left the club for Southern League football with, successively, Nuneaton Borough, Crawley Town and Hinckley Town.

A graduate of the University of Göttingen, where he studied for his doctorate under the direction of James Franck, winner of the 1925 Nobel Prize for Physics, he left Germany after the Nazi Party came to power there in 1933, and moved to Britain, where relatives had settled, becoming a British subject in 1939. At the invitation of Frederick Alexander Lindemann, he worked for Imperial Chemical Industries at the Clarendon Laboratory in Oxford, where he studied hyperfine structure. During the Second World War, he worked on isotope separation for Tube Alloys and the Manhattan Project. He was the first physicist to become a fellow at Balliol College, Oxford, in 1950, and published textbooks on atomic spectra in German in 1934 and English in 1962.  Biography  Heinrich Gerhard Kuhn was born in Breslau, Germany, on 10 March 1904, the second son of Wilhelm Felix Kuhn, a rechtsanwalt (lawyer) and notary public, and his wife Marthe née Hoppe. His older brother became a philosophy professor. His paternal grandmother was Charlotte Kuhn née Henschel, the half-sister of George Henschel, a musician who emigrated to Britain. Much of Kuhn's early life was spent in Lüben, where he went to school and attended the Real-Gymnasium. He passed his abitur in March 1922 and entered the University of Greifswald intending to study chemistry. In 1924, he decided to switch to physics and moved to the University of Göttingen, where there was a thriving school of physics that included Max Born and James Franck. Franck had recently published a theory of electron motion and diatomic molecules, and at his suggestion Kuhn studied the absorption spectra of chlorine (Cl2) and bromine (Br2). His results confirmed the Franck–Condon principle and formed his 1926 doctoral thesis on Absorptionspektrum und Dissoziationswarmen von Halogenmolekül (Absorption spectra and dissociation warming of halogen molecules). Kuhn became a became a demonstrator at Göttingen in 1926, and then a lecturer in 1931. He continued his studies of the Franck–Condon principle and the Stark effect for his habilitation in February 1931, which allowed him to become a privatdozent. He married Marie Bertha Nohl, the daughter of the Göttingen philosophy professor . Although his father was Jewish, he had been baptised when he married, and Kuhn was brought up as a Christian. This meant little when the Nazi Party came to power in Germany in 1933. Kuhn was classified as non-Aryan because he had two Jewish grandparents. He was dismissed from his university positions, and his habilitation was revoked. As a decorated veteran of the First World War, Franck was not dismissed from his post, but elected to resign in protest rather than dismiss colleagues for their race or political beliefs. Before leaving Germany, Franck attempted to find positions for his former students and colleagues. He introduced Kuhn to Frederick Lindemann, who invited Kuhn to come to the Clarendon laboratory at Oxford University, where he could work on atomic spectra with Derek Jackson. Kuhn and his wife left Germany for Britain in August 1933. They were welcomed by his relatives, the Henschels, and Kuhn received a grant of £400 per annum, initially for two years, but it was extended to three, and then six. His two sons, Anselm Thomas and Nicholas John, were born in Britain. They attended Dragon School and St Edward's, and entered Balliol College, Oxford, where they earned doctorates. Kuhn became a naturalised British subject in 1939. At the Clarendon laboratory, Jackson and Kuhn studied the hyperfine structure and Zeeman effects of the light elements such a lithium, sodium and potassium. In 1940, Kuhn joined a team led by Francis Simon that also included Henry Shull Arms and Nicholas Kurti, working on the British nuclear weapons project, known as Tube Alloys. Ironically, foreign-born physicists were assigned this work because they could not initially obtain the required security clearance to work on top-secret projects like radar. Simon's team studied the technology of gaseous diffusion. As part of this work, Kuhn visited the United States in December 1943 and January 1944 to work with the Manhattan Project. Jackson left Britain for tax purposes after the war, but Kuhn remained at Oxford, where he continued his research into atomic spectra with G.W. Series and G.K. Woodgate. Kuhn had become a lecturer at University College, Oxford, in 1938, and he began tutoring students in physics in 1941. In 1950, Balliol College elected him as its first physics fellow, and its only refugee fellow. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1954. He became a senior research fellow in 1969, and an emeritus fellow in 1971. He received the Holweck Prize in 1967. Germany restored his habilitation, and he was given the status and pension of a full professor, but he declined offers to return to Germany. Kuhn had published a textbook on atomic spectra in German, Atomspektren, in 1934. In 1962, he published an updated version, Atomic Spectra, in English; it was still widely used two decades later. He died in Oxford on 26 August 1994 after a long illness.

He also was involved with Dimension Films in making educational films such as Can a Parent Be Human? Biography Mackenzie was born on April 6, 1930 in Hampstead, England. His mother was English, and his father was Dewitt Mackenzie, who was head of the London Bureau of the Associated Press. After finishing school, Kent Mackenzie enlisted in the air force and later ended up in Hollywood, where, after gaining a scholarship, he made Bunker Hill, his first film. His next film The Exiles was released in 1961. In later years, he worked as an editor on television documentaries and medical and industrial films and shorts. During the 1960s and 1970s, he taught film-making to high school classes. He also directed some films for Dimension Films. Since the mid 1970s, he suffered from seizures. He died on 16 May 1980 in Marin County, California as a result of his medication and related complications. Films The Exiles The setting for The Exiles was in Bunker Hill. This was the second time Mackenzie had used the Hill in a film. The first instance was in 1956 when he made a film about the displacement of pensioners being moved because of high-rise buildings being built in their area. The Exiles was an independent film and took three-and-a-half years to make and had its share of issues. During the course of the film some of the cast were imprisoned and therefore never appeared in later scenes. He also lost two of his cameramen. The film is about Native Americans who move from the reservation to the city and some of the issues they encounter. Christina Rose of the Indian Country Today Media Network wrote that it was the first film to give an accurate portrayal of urban natives. Other films Before making The Exiles, Mackenzie made Bunker Hill in 1956. He was still a student at USC at the time. The film centered on elderly pensioners and their community and the displacement they experienced because of a block of high-rise offices that was to be built there. In 1965, he produced and directed The Teenage Revolution, which featured Barry Brown in an early role and was narrated by Van Heflin. It looked at six teenagers and their society and culture as well as their current lives while speculating about their futures. He directed and produced Saturday Morning, a film about teenagers, released in 1971 through Dimension Films, of which Gary Goldsmith was chief and producer. It was a non-fiction film that involved a group of 20 teenagers being filmed over a period of a week.

In the early 1960s a new generation of dealer galleries (often short-lived) arose in Auckland, encouraging people to see and buy contemporary New Zealand art. Barry Lett Galleries filled a gap left in the Auckland cultural scene by the closure of Ikon Gallery (which had shown, among others, Colin McCahon, Don Binney and Pat Hanly), as did Kees and Tina Hoses’ New Vision Gallery. Barry Lett Galleries showed many of the leading painters of the 1960s and 1970s, including McCahon, Binney, Hanly, Milan Mrkusich, Gordon Walters, Ralph Hotere, Michael Smither, Michael Illingworth and Robert Ellis. Unlike most commercial galleries, Barry Lett Gallery also showed the work of 'post-object' artist Jim Allen and his students at the Elam School of Fine Arts, such as Leon Narbey. In 1975 the gallery celebrated its tenth anniversary with a show of two works each by 14 of its core artists, including McCahon, Binney, Hotere, Mrkusich, Illingworth and Teuane Tibbo. Frank Lowe sold his interest to Kim Wright in 1966, and in 1975 Barry Lett left the gallery to paint full-time, leaving Rodney Kirk- Smith. In 1976 the gallery became known as RKS Art. Barry Lett multiples In 1968 the gallery issued a set of prints by 12 of its artists: Binney, McCahon, Walters, Mrkusich, Illingworth, Hotere, Hanly, Ellis, Michael Smither, Mervyn Williams, Ross Ritchie, and Toss Woollaston. The prints were intended to make contemporary art more accessible to the public, and were priced at $35 before publication and $40 after. Lett selected the twelve to reflect an 'up and coming' generation of new artists; the prints were not numbered but between 200 and 250 editions were believed to have been produced.

The term máchimoi (, plural of μάχιμος, máchimos, meaning \\"pugnacious\\") commonly refers to a broad category of ancient Egyptian low- ranked soldiers which rose during the Late Period of Egypt (664–332 BCE) and, more prominently, during the Ptolemaic dynasty (323–30 BCE). History Herodotus and the Late Period The earliest attestation of this term given to native Egyptian warriors came from Herodotus – who visited Egypt during the first Persian domination (Manetho's 27th Dynasty) – and since him this term has been usually translated simply as \\"warriors\\" or \\"fighting men\\". The same term was used by him, referring to Asiatic troops employed by the Persians. Herodotus provided some information about the Egyptian máchimoi, claiming that they were literally a closed caste of warriors who were forbidden to practice other activities outside of combat and were provided twelve arourai of tax-free land as a reward for their services. Herodotus also recognizes two categories of máchimoi, called hermotybies and kalasiries, which were distinct by their districts of origin; he also claims that the two categories were composed by 160,000 and 250,000 soldiers respectively.Fischer- Bovet, op. cit. pp. 210–12 As well as Herodotus, also other Greek authors such as Plato and Diodorus Siculus, reports that the máchimoi were deployed in many battles during the Late Period. Pharaoh Apries send them against Cyrene but after their defeat, they proclaimed general Amasis as pharaoh and served him against Apries in 570 BCE. Egyptian máchimoi also fought at Plataea in 479 BCE.Fischer-Bovet, op. cit. p. 210 During the 30th Dynasty, Egyptian máchimoi were widely used against the Achaemenid Empire: according to Diodorus, pharaoh Teos sent 80,000 of them in his expedition in the Near East in c.360/358 BCE and his nephew Nakhthorheb (the future Nectanebo II) was their commander.Alan B. Lloyd, Egypt, 404-332 B.C. in The Cambridge Ancient History, volume VI: The Fourth Century B.C., 1994, , p. 342 Nectanebo II himself later relied on these soldiers before the second Persian conquest of Egypt in 343 BCE. Ptolemaic Period The Rosetta Stone mentions an amnesty given to some máchimoi Máchimoi were still present during the Ptolemaic period, and most scholars considers them as the direct successors of their Late Period counterparts; Ptolemaic máchimoi are mostly still seen as a caste of native-Egyptian, land- granted, low-ranked warriors whom, with the passing of time, takes on increasingly important roles alongside the Greek army likely since the battle of Raphia in 217 BCE, and exerted increasing social pressure on the Ptolemies and was responsible for various rebellions and uprisings.Heinz Heinen, Heer und Gesellschaft im Ptolemäerreich, in Vom hellenistischen Osten zum römischen Westen: Ausgewählte Schriften zur Alten Geschichte. Steiner, Stuttgart 2006, , pp. 61–84Fischer-Bovet, op. cit. p. 220 n. 67 Curiously, under the Ptolemies the name máchimoi is attested only on documents while during the Late Period they were mentioned exclusively on Greek literary works: for example, Diodorus clearly calls máchimoi the Egyptian soldiers of pharaoh Teos, but not their Ptolemaic counterparts.Fischer-Bovet, op. cit. pp. 219–21 The earliest mention of máchimoi on Ptolemaic documents is dating back to the reign of Ptolemy II Philadelphus (261 BCE) and refers to guard duties; this was not uncommon, as from many documents it seems that they sometimes were guards and sometimes had purely army duties.Fischer-Bovet, op. cit. p. 222 However, the most famous document mentioning them is the Rosetta Stone (Greek text, row 19) made under Ptolemy V Epiphanes (196 BCE), which refers to an amnesty for some deserted máchimoi.Fischer-Bovet, op. cit. pp. 223–24 2013 reinterpretation A 2013 paper by historian Christelle Fischer-Bovet revised many of the traditional claims about the máchimoi. She challenged most of Herodotus' description, pointing out that ancient Egyptians never used similar caste systems, and both the total numbers of máchimoi and of the lands given to them are almost certainly unsustainable, suggesting that Herodotus unintentionally merged professional military officers with a militia composed by commoners who were called to arms if necessary, and attributed to the whole group an elite status not much different from that of Greek Spartiates.Fischer-Bovet, op. cit. pp. 210–12; 216–17 Fischer-Bovet also perceived a discontinuity between Late Period and Ptolemaic máchimoi and criticized the aforementioned traditional rendering of the latter group; historical documents mentioning Greek máchimoi during the Ptolemaic Period proves that they were not exclusively native Egyptians as usually thought, suggesting that the term was rather an indicator of their military role (for example, the pike-bearing máchimoi epilektoi or the mounted máchimoi hippeis) and/or of the amount of land received (a pentarouros, for example, was a máchimos granted with five arourai of land) and not of their ethnicity. In this regard, she accepts the idea that the máchimoi were the lowest level of the military hierarchy, but their socio- economic status was still higher than that of the average peasant.Fischer- Bovet, op. cit. p. 225 References Sources * Christelle Fischer-Bovet (2013), \\"Egyptian warriors: the Machimoi of Herodotus and the Ptolemaic Army\\".

His failing eyesight obliged him to abandon porcelain painting, and in 1815 to take up the position of Keeper of the Musee de Ceramique at Sèvres. Tutored by his father, Riocreux soon became skilled in drawing and painting. Alfred also worked at the Sèvres factory and his work, which included botanical drawings, was exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1837, 1838 and 1855. In 1870 he was awarded the Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur. In 1856 he became a member of the Société Impériale et Centrale d’Horticulture. His interest in botanical illustration was furthered through meeting the botanist Adolphe Theodore Brongniart. It seems probable that Brongniart first introduced Riocreux to the Museum d'Histoire Naturelle, where he befriended the botanist and author Joseph Decaisne, who later named the genus Riocreuxia in his honour, and in turn introduced him to Gustave Thuret. He also made use of Riocreux's talents to illustrate the nine volumes of \\"Le Jardin Fruitier du Muséum\\" (1858-1875). This led to more illustrating for other botanists, such as Étienne Fiacre Louis Raoul's \\"Choix de Plantes de la Nouvelle-Zélande\\" (1846), W.B. Hemsley's \\"Handbook of Hardy Trees, Shrubs, and Herbaceous Plants\\" (1873) and Gustave Thuret's \\"Notes Algologiques\\" (1876-1880) and \\"Etudes Phycologiques\\" (1878), the latter being highly acclaimed. His illustrations were also used in the journals \\"La Revue Horticole and Annales des Sciences Naturelles\\". Riocreux was chosen by Édouard André to arrange the engravings for C.S. Sargent's \\"Silva of North America\\", in twelve volumes from 1890-1899. Working from Paris, Riocreux supervised the production of the six hundred plates drawn in pencil by Charles Edward Faxon (1846-1918) and engraved by Philibert and Eugene Picart. Thirty of Riocreux's original plates for \\"Choix de Plantes de la Nouvelle-Zélande\\" are held by the Herbarium at Kew. He was an early exponent of using a microscope for botanical dissections. His work may be seen at the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. A collection of 86 drawings by Riocreux (four of which are shown below) was once held by the Arnold Arboretum at Harvard University - C.S. Sargent was its first director during 1872-1927.

The war lasted from 1342 to 1346.Die Saale aus der Luft by Bogner, Franz Xaver. Retrieved 23 Dec 2014 The conflict is also called by various other names in English sources including War of the Thuringian Counts and Thuringian Comital War. In 1247, the last Thuringian landgrave from the House of the Ludovingians, Henry Raspe, died without a male heir. During the war of succession that followed, Henry the Illustrious, Margrave of Meissen, finally won the landgraviate for the House of Wettin, whilst the Hessian territories went to Henry I of Hesse and formed the new Landgraviate of Hesse. The grandson of Henry the Illustrious, Frederick I, the Brave, and his son, Frederick II, the Serious, tried to secure the suzerainty of the Wettins over Thuringia and thus fell inevitably into opposition with the other princes in the land. On 1 September 1342, the various counts and lords of Thuringia of sealed a pact in Arnstadt which effectively allied them against Frederick the Serious.Langhof, Peter (1995). Die Thüringer Grafenfehde und die Schwarzburger, pdf. Retrieved 23 Dec 2014. The parties to the alliance included the counts of Schwarzburg, Weimar- Orlamünde and Hohnstein and the advocates of Gera and Plauen. Conflict broke out in October. The Electoral Mainz archbishop, Henry III of Virneburg, who was already in dispute with the citizens of Erfurt over city rights, supported the counts and so the citizens of Erfurt took the side of Frederick the Serious. By 14 December 1342 the first peace treaty, brokered by the Emperor, was signed. Because the counts and advocates were bound to pay a very high sum - 338,000 Marks of Erfurt silver - for \\"breaking the peace\\", however, the peace did not hold and fighting soon flared up again. Frederick now sought to weaken the opposing allies by agreeing separate treaties with his enemies: first on 6 September 1343 with the advocates of Gera and Plauen, on 28 July 1345 with the Schwarzburgs, and finally on 11 April 1346 in the Treaty of Dresden with the Count of Weimar-Orlamünde. Each of the allies had to turn their main territories into fiefs of the Wettins and so lost their imperial immediacy and their political independence. The outcome of the comital war strengthened the position of the Wettins in Thuringia, although were unable to finally drive the Schwarzburgs and the advocates out of Thuringia and these vassals continued to play an important role until the end of the monarchy in Thuringia in 1918 (c.f. Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, Schwarzburg-Sondershausen, Reuß). However, after the counts' war they could not further expand their territories, but were restricted to their homelands and therefore no longer in a position to threaten the dominance of the Wettins in Thuringia. For the counts of Weimar-Orlamünde the result of the war meant the end of their imperial immediacy. A short while later, Weimar fell to Wettin as an agreed fief and became an important residenz of the Ernestine branch of the Wettins (c.f. Saxe-Weimar and Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach).

The building is now occupied by a Waitrose and flats. History John Barnes was one of six founders who came up with the idea to open a department store in 1898. The founders were all prominent London retailers, with John Barnes being a director of Barkers of Kensington. However, before the store could open John Barnes, who had been the chairman of the founders board had died in a shipping accident off the coast of Guernsey in 1899. In 1900 the remaining founders opened their store on Finchley Road in the name of their former Chairman. The store occupied the site of 14 shops and several houses and included a central passenger lift. The store occupied four of the floors, and there was accommodation for over 400 members of staff. The store in its first year had a turnover of £125,000 (£10 million in today's money) but it was not until 1905 that the store started making profits. In 1926, the business was purchased by the newly formed Selfridge Provincial Stores group. With the purchase major changes were brought in to modernise the business, including no staff living on the premises. The business was so successful that in 1935 the store was completely rebuilt in the fashionable style of the time by a design from architect T P Bennett. The new store was located on three of the 8 floors, with 96 flats on the upper five floors in a development known as St John's Court. However the collapse of the Selfridge Provincial Store group in 1940 saw John Barnes become part of the John Lewis Partnership. The business flourished after the Second World War as it was one of the few businesses not affected by the German bombing. However the store became more reliant on the Food Hall to stay profitable, and the opening of the Brent Cross shopping centre in 1976 (which included a John Lewis store) damaged the business further. In January 1981 the store closed for good with 253 John Lewis partners losing their jobs. However, on 2 February 1981 the store reopened as Waitrose John Barnes on the ground floor (the food hall had been previously in the basement) and continues to operate from there. The basement is now a car park for the store offering limited parking for customers of the store.

Massive Cuban migration to Miami during the second series led to major demographic and cultural changes in Miami. There was also economic emigration, particularly during the Great Depression in the 1930s. As of 2018, there were 1,343,960 Cubans in the United States.http://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?t=Place%20of%20Birth&tid;=ACSDT1Y2018.B05006&hidePreview;=false&vintage;=2018 The Louisiana Purchase and the Adams–Onís Treaty of 1819, Spanish Florida, including the present day state of Florida and, at times, Louisiana and adjoining territory, was a province of the Captaincy General of Cuba (Captain General being the Spanish title equivalent to the British colonial Governor). Consequently, Cuban immigration to the U.S. has a long history, beginning in the Spanish colonial period in 1565 when St. Augustine, Florida was established by Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, and hundreds of Spanish-Cuban soldiers and their families moved from Cuba to St. Augustine to establish a new life. Thousands of Cuban settlers also immigrated to Louisiana between 1778 and 1802 and Texas during the period of Spanish rule. By 1820 the Cuban presence was more than 1000 people. In 1870 the number of Cuban immigrants increased to almost 12,000, of whom 4,500 resided in New York City, 3,000 in New Orleans, and 2,000 in Key West. The causes of these movements were both economic and political, which intensified after 1860, when political factors played the predominant role in emigration, as a result of deteriorating relations with the Spain, the colonial power. The year 1869 marked the beginning of one of the most significant periods of emigration from Cuba to the United States, again centered on Key West. People would often come over in rafts or weak and small boats. The exodus of hundreds of workers and businessmen was linked to the manufacture of tobacco. The reasons are many: the introduction of more modern techniques of elaboration of snuff, the most direct access to its main market, the United States, the uncertainty about the future of the island, which had suffered years of economic, political and social unrest during the beginning of the Ten Years' War against Spanish rule. It was an exodus of skilled workers, precisely the class in the island that had succeeded in establishing a free labor sector amid a slave economy. The manufacture of snuff by the Cuban labor force, became the most important source of income for Key West between 1869 and 1900. Tampa was added to such efforts, with a strong migration of Cubans, which went from 720 inhabitants in 1880 to 5,532 in 1890. However, the second half of the 1890s marked the decline of the Cuban immigrant population, as an important part of it returned to the island to fight for independence. The War accentuated Cuban immigrant integration into American society, whose numbers were significant: more than 12,000 people.Cuba vs Bloqueo (In Spanish). Posted by Dr. Antonio Aja Díaz – CEMI (Centro de Estudios de la Migración Internacional- Center for the Study of International Migration) July 2000 Circulo Cubano (Cuban Club), Ybor City  Immigration to Key West and Tampa (1850-1889)  In the mid-to late 19th century, several cigar manufacturers moved their operations to Key West to get away from growing disruptions as Cubans sought independence from Spanish colonial rule. Many Cuban cigar workers followed. The Cuban government had even established a grammar school in Key West to help preserve Cuban culture. There, children learned folk songs and patriotic hymns such as \\"La Bayamesa\\", the Cuban national anthem. In 1885, Vicente Martinez Ybor moved his cigar operations from Key West to the town of Tampa, Florida to escape labor strife. Ybor City was designed as a modified company town, and it quickly attracted thousands of Cuban workers from Key West and Cuba. West Tampa, another cigar manufacturing community, was founded nearby in 1892 and grew quickly. Between these communities, the Tampa Bay area's Cuban population grew from almost nothing to the largest in Florida in just over a decade, and the city as a whole grew from a village of 1,000 residents in 1885 to over 16,000 by 1900. Both Ybor City and West Tampa were instrumental in Cuba's eventual independence. Inspired by revolutionaries such as Jose Martí, who visited Florida several times, Tampa-area Cubans and their neighbors donated money, equipment, and sometimes their lives to the cause of Cuba Libre. After the Spanish–American War, some Cubans returned to Cuba, but others chose to stay in the U.S. due to the physical and economic devastation caused by conflicts on the island.  Immigration to the Northeast (1900–1958)  Several other small waves of Cuban emigration to the U.S. occurred in the early 20th century (1900–59). Most settled in Florida and the northeast U.S. The majority of the 100,000 Cubans came for economic reasons due to (the Great Depression of 1929, volatile sugar prices, and migrant farm labor contracts). Others included anti-Batista refugees fleeing the military dictatorship, which had pro-U.S. diplomatic ties. During the '20s and '30s, emigration basically comprised workers looking for jobs, mainly in New York and New Jersey. They were classified as labor migrants and workers, much like other immigrants in the area at that time. Thus migrated more than 40,000 in the first decade, encouraged by U.S. immigration facilities at the time and more than 43,000 by the end of the 30s. Subsequently, the flow of Cubans to the United States fluctuated, due to both the domestic situation in the 40s and 50s in Cuba, and U.S. immigration policies, plus intermittent anti-immigrant sentiment. Cuban migration in those years included persons who could afford to leave the country and live abroad. The Cuban population officially registered in the United States for 1958 was around 125,000 people, including descendants. Of these, more than 50,000 remained in the United States after the revolution of 1959.  Cuban exile to Miami (1953–1959) After the Cuban revolution led by Fidel Castro in 1959, a Cuban exodus began as the new government allied itself with the Soviet Union and began to introduce communism. From 1960 to 1979, tens of thousands of Cubans left Cuba, with the vast majority coming from Cuba's educated, landowning upper class. Operacion Pedro Pan developed when children arrived in Miami and were met by representatives of Catholic Charities. The children were then sent to live with relatives, foster homes, orphanages, or boarding schools. In order to provide aid to the immigrants, the United States Congress passed the Cuban Adjustment Act in 1966. The Cuban Refugee Program provided more than $1.3 billion of direct financial assistance. They also were eligible for public assistance, Medicare, free English courses, scholarships, and low-interest college loans. Some banks pioneered loans for exiles who did not have collateral or credit but received help in getting a business loan. These loans helped many Cuban Americans to secure funds and start-up their own businesses.

According to author Lisandro Perez, Miami was not particularly attractive to Cubans prior to the 1960s.Grenier, Guillermo J. Miami Now!: Immigration, Ethnicity, and Social Change. Retrieved March 31, 2011. It was not until the exodus of the Cuban exiles in 1959 that Miami became a preferred location. Westchester, Florida within Miami-Dade County, was the area most densely populated by Cubans and Cuban Americans in the United States, followed by Hialeah, Florida in second. Communities like Miami, Tampa, and Union City, which Cuban Americans made their home, experienced a profound cultural impact as a result, as seen in such aspects of their local culture as cuisine, fashion, music, entertainment and cigar-making.Martin, Lydia (August 9, 1995). \\"Cuban cool\\" The Star-Ledger. pp. 41 and 54.Juri, Carmen (August 9, 1995). \\"Jersey's Cuban flavors\\" The Star-Ledger. p, 41 and 54. 1980 There was a sizable migration wave of Cubans into Florida in 1980 Exodo de Mariel Mariel boatlift. Mid-1990s to 2000s In the mid-1990s, after the implementation of the \\"wet feet, dry feet\\" policy, immigration patterns changed. Many Cuban immigrants departed from the southern and western coasts and arrived at the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico while others landed on Isla Mujeres. From there they went to the Texas–Mexico border to request asylum. Many of the Cubans who did not have family in Miami settled in Houston; this has caused Houston's Cuban American community to increase in size. The term \\"dusty foot\\" refers to Cubans emigrating to the U.S. through Mexico. In 2005 the Department of Homeland Security had abandoned the approach of detaining every dry foot Cuban who crosses through Texas and began a policy allowing most Cubans to obtain immediate parole.Russell Cobb and Paul Knight. \\"Immigration: Cubans Enter U.S. at Texas-Mexico Border\\", Houston Press, January 9, 2008 Jorge Ferragut, a Cuban immigrant who founded Casa Cuba, an agency that assists Cuban immigrants arriving in Texas, said in a 2008 article that many Cuban immigrants of the first decade of the 21st century left due to economic instead of political issues.\\"Immigration: Cubans Enter U.S. at Texas- Mexico Border.\\" Houston Press. 3.

This changed in the 1990s so that only Cubans who reach U.S. soil were granted refugee status under the \\"wet foot, dry foot policy\\". While representing a tightening of U.S. immigration policy, the wet foot, dry foot policy afforded Cubans a privileged position relative to other immigrants to the U.S. According to a U.S. Census 1970 report, Cuban Americans lived in all 50 states. But as later Census reports demonstrated, most Cuban immigrants settled in south Florida. A new trend in the late 1990s showed that fewer immigrants arrived from Cuba than previously. While U.S. born Cuban Americans moved out of their enclaves, other nationalities settled there.

The anime aired 13 episodes in Japan between July 5 and September 27, 2015. An original video animation episode was released in March 2016. Two manga series were serialized in ASCII Media Works' Dengeki G's Comic. The story takes place in an alternate reality where a small percentage of children manifest superhuman abilities upon reaching puberty. A focus is placed on Yuu Otosaka, a high school boy who awakens the ability to temporarily possess others, which brings him to the attention of Nao Tomori, the student council president of a school founded as a haven for children with such abilities. The story was originally conceived by Jun Maeda, who also wrote the screenplay and composed some of the music, with original character design by Na-Ga. Both Maeda and Na-Ga are from the visual novel brand Key, and Charlotte is the second original anime series created by Key following Angel Beats! in 2010. Maeda had thought up the concept for Charlotte long before he was approached in early 2012 to work on another anime series after Angel Beats!. Maeda narrowed down the number of main characters compared to Angel Beats! and attempted to put more of a focus on their behavior. Instead of employing the same staff that had worked on Angel Beats!, the aim for Charlotte was to bring together a staff that would add a new variety to the creative process to prevent being influenced by the work done on Angel Beats!. Charlotte was praised for its unpredictability and evocative moments, but its pacing and structure have been criticized as inefficient. It has been described as approachable for a wide audience and for defying the \\"moe anime\\" stereotype. Although the comedic elements have been called dumb and corny, they have overall been lauded for offering some relief from the serious moments, which one reviewer likened to a palate cleanser. P.A.Works' production was praised for its beautiful animation sequences and expressive cinematography. Plot Charlotte takes place in an alternate reality where a short-period comet called Charlotte passes near Earth once every 75 years. As this happens, it spreads dust onto the Earth, which causes a small percentage of preadolescent children who inhale the dust to manifest superhuman abilities upon reaching puberty. In Japan the story follows the protagonist Yuu Otosaka, a boy who awakens the ability to temporarily possess another person for five seconds. Although hoping to use his ability to fraudulently live a carefree high school life, he is unexpectedly exposed by Nao Tomori, a girl who can make herself invisible to a specific target. She forces him to transfer to and join its student council, of which she is the president. Also on the student council is Jōjirō Takajō, a boy who can move at uncontrollably high speeds. The student council's main objective is to ensure the safety of ability users from organizations who seek to exploit their powers. In doing so, the student council warns ability users of the potential danger of using their abilities openly. This leads the student council to Yusa Nishimori, a pop singer who has the ability to channel the spirits of the dead as a medium. Yusa's dead older sister Misa frequently makes use of this ability to freely possess her at any time, which allows Misa to use her own ability, pyrokinesis. Nao soon arranges for Yusa to transfer to Hoshinoumi Academy and join the student council. Yuu's younger sister Ayumi unexpectedly awakens an ability to cause anything around her to suddenly collapse, which results in her death. Yuu falls into a deep depression as a result and isolates himself, but Nao successfully manages to pull him out of his depression and gets him to return to the student council. While attending a concert of the post-rock band Zhiend with Nao, Yuu recollects previously suppressed memories of his older brother Shunsuke, who has the ability to time travel. Shunsuke had used this ability to establish Hoshinoumi Academy and an affiliated organization attempting to develop a vaccine to prevent children from developing abilities before they manifest, but his repeated use has left him blind. Yuu learns that the true nature of his ability enables him to steal another person's ability by possessing them. Yuu takes Shunsuke's ability to go back in time and ultimately prevent Ayumi's death by stealing her collapse ability before she can use it. A terrorist group manages to abduct Nao and Kumagami, one of Shunsuke's closest friends and aides, and holds them hostage in exchange for Yuu, who attempts to rescue them. However, the operation does not go as planned, which results in Kumagami's death and Yuu being gravely injured. After Yuu recovers, he resolves to protect all of the ability users around the world by stealing their abilities as per Nao's suggestion. As Yuu travels the world stealing abilities, the more powers he takes on soon takes its toll on him as he starts losing his memories and sense of self. However, he still manages to steal everyone's abilities throughout the world before collapsing. Shunsuke rescues Yuu, bringing him back to Japan among friends and family. Yuu is left with no past memories, but Nao tells him she is his girlfriend. Yuu and his friends look forward to the memories they will make from now on as Yuu continues to recover from his ordeal. Characters Main The main characters of Charlotte (from left to right): Yusa, Jōjirō (back row); Nao, Ayumi, and Yuu (front row) ; : :Yuu is the protagonist of Charlotte.

Yuu is a first-year student at Hoshinoumi Academy, and he is forced to join its student council. Initially a fake honors student and chronic cheater, Yuu is reluctant to use his ability to aide the student council, but as time goes on, he becomes less narcissistic and much more selfless and caring towards others. Over the course of the story, he becomes a fan of the post-rock band Zhiend and falls in love with Nao.

Production Creation and conception The original creators of Charlotte are Jun Maeda and Na-Ga of Key, and Charlotte is the second original anime series created by Key following Angel Beats! (2010). Yōsuke Toba of Aniplex approached Maeda in early 2012 with an offer from P.A.Works president Kenji Horikawa to do another anime series with the studio. Maeda was surprised by this, as he never expected to work with P.A.Works again. Horikawa explained that the production staff could now handle things that were not able to be fully materialized during the production of Angel Beats!. Maeda did not think he would ever be involved in the planning of another anime series, but he said that he had no choice but to accept Horikawa's offer after discussing it with him. Toba asked Maeda to write a \\"Key-like story\\", and Maeda started out by applying his prior experience of working on Angel Beats!. He went through a trial-and-error process to work out what kind of setting and story would work well for an anime series. Long before working on Charlotte, Maeda had thought up a concept for a story with characters who have imperfect superpowers that must cooperate with each other to resolve any incidents that arise. Maeda originally submitted three separate ideas for a story to Toba, and he asked him which one he liked best. However, after Toba pointed out one of the other two, Maeda made it clear that he wanted to do the story that would become Charlotte. When writing the story, Maeda also reconsidered how he had done certain things with Angel Beats!. In particular, he attempted to put more of a focus on the behavior of the characters. Maeda also narrowed down the number of main characters in Charlotte compared to Angel Beats!, which could not put a focus on each and every character. Toba felt that Maeda was influenced by his work on Angel Beats!, which changed his thought process and what he wanted to depict in Charlotte. Maeda thought issues had arisen with the large cast of characters in Angel Beats!, such as overlapping personality traits and not being able to remember everyone, and he used those considerations when writing Charlotte. Similarly, when designing the characters in Angel Beats!, Na-Ga had been concerned about designs being too similar among the characters, and went on to make use of that experience with Charlotte. When developing Jōjirō Takajō, he originally had a different appearance and personality, but over the course of the development process, he eventually became similar to Takamatsu from Angel Beats!. Maeda decided fairly early on to make Yuu Otosaka a low- life cheater at the start of Charlotte because he had never created a character like that before. When trying to choose a title for Charlotte, Maeda's friend Taisei Nakagawa proposed a title which could be abbreviated as \\"AA\\" based on its similarity to Angel Beats! abbreviation of \\"AB\\". However, Maeda did not like the title, and devised the title Charlotte as one that would surpass the original \\"AA\\" title. The title Charlotte came from the song by the Japanese band Art-School. Development When deciding on Charlotte staff, Toba thought it would be better not to have exactly the same team that produced Angel Beats!. Having already decided to stick with Maeda, Na-Ga and P.A.Works, Toba aimed to bring together a staff that would add a new variety to the creative process, and in doing so would prevent being influenced by the work done on Angel Beats!. With that in mind, Toba wanted a director who had a good understanding of Angel Beats! and who would also be suitable as Charlotte director, leading him to seek out Yoshiyuki Asai. Toba took into consideration the storyboarding Asai had done for two episodes of Angel Beats!, and he thought that Charlotte would be a good opportunity to have a first-time series director. Asai was also chosen as someone who could handle both comedic and serious moments. When Horikawa first looked at Charlotte incomplete script, he told Maeda that it did not feel like it had the same kind of zeal that Angel Beats! had. However, once he saw the whole script, his concerns with it were dispelled, much to Maeda's relief. While the entire script was still in the draft phase, Maeda revised lines that felt unnatural after asking others for their opinions on it, including Na-Ga. When writing the script, Maeda made a conscious effort to write Charlotte in the framework of an anime series, as opposed to when he wrote the script for Angel Beats!, which he admits he wrote more akin to the framework of a video game. In this way, Toba felt that Charlotte was Maeda's effort to write a story in its purest form that could not be made into a video game, unlike Angel Beats!. Toba also noted that the characters in Charlotte are not written for a video game scenario, especially the protagonist, and went on to echo Horikawa's sentiment that Charlotte is akin to an I novel for Maeda. Toba explained that this is a result of Maeda's effort to remove the restrictions that come from writing the scenario for a video game. Kanami Sekiguchi was chosen as the character designer after Horikawa took notice of her work as the animation director of episode nine of Angel Beats!, and Toba was eager to see how she would render Na-Ga's original designs. When it came time to choose an art director, Kazuki Higashiji was chosen for his zeal in the workplace and Horikawa's confidence in his artistic talent; Higashiji had also been the art director for Angel Beats!. Similarly, Satoki Iida was brought back to work on Charlotte again as the sound and music director, and he also helped with the proofreading of the script as he had done for Angel Beats!. Iida was largely chosen for his good communication with Maeda, and so that he could make the best use of his experience working on Angel Beats!. When writing the music for How-Low-Hello, Maeda reused some older songs he had composed as a student in the 1990s that he felt were selective of his best songs from that period. At the time, his concept when composing the songs was \\"early B'z\\", but Maeda notes that this is no longer the case with the completed songs.

Reception In a review by Anime News Network, reviewer Gabriella Ekens praised the series for \\"sculpting singular, evocative moments\\", but went on to say that a \\"problem arises when you try to tie them into a bigger picture.\\" Ekens criticized the pacing and structure of the show, calling it an \\"inefficient...collection of sprawling narrative ideas\\" and comparing it to \\"Anohana suddenly turn[ing] into Darker than Black.\\" Ekens also notes that its thematic purpose \\"seems to be Jun Maeda's opportunity for melodramatic elaboration on the emotional dilemmas posed by Madoka Magica.\\" Overall, Charlotte was lauded for its entertainment value and unpredictability, but \\"disappoints as a work of art.\\" Early on, Ekens described the series as having \\"sharp comedic timing,\\" and by episode four, she praised the comedic elements as \\"already much funnier than Plastic Memories.\\" She went on to say that \\"it's dumb, but I like it for the same reasons I liked the comedy in Seraph of the End: Vampire Reign.\\" Chris Beveridge of The Fandom Post found Charlotte unpredictability \\"engaging\\" and its animation \\"beautiful\\". Ekens praised P.A. Works for their dynamic direction and \\"expressive cinematography\\" which offers \\"a distinct, pleasant aesthetic.\\" In a column on Mainichi Shimbun Mantanweb portal, Charlotte was praised for the balance it strikes to reach a wide audience, from \\"core fans\\" of anime to casual viewers, in regards to its creative use of peculiar characters coupled with a scenario focused on resolving problems. Columnist Ryō Koarai commended Charlotte for pulling in the viewer from the first episode due to Yuu's surprising, unorthodox personality in contrast with how he uses his superhuman ability in his everyday life. Writer Seiji Nakazawa lauded Charlotte for defying the \\"moe anime\\" stereotype at first glance and for instead being what he describes as a \\"human drama\\". He notes that Charlotte is written in much the same way as Maeda's previous works by inserting jokes between serious moments to offer some relief to the viewer. While Nakazawa admits that some may find the jokes in Charlotte corny, he finds them acceptable and likens them to a palate cleanser.

Life Early years Krüger was born in Jüterbog, a traditionally walled town some 40 miles (65 km) south-west of Berlin. His father worked as a waiter and his mother was employed in retailing. His own schooling came to an accelerated conclusion through the device of an \\"Emergency Abitur\\" due to the pressures arising out of war and he was conscripted for Labour service early in 1943. Army life in the Soviet Union In June 1943 he was drafted into the army, serving initially in Poland before being transferred to the Russian Front in June 1944. By September 1944 he had been promoted to the rank of sub- officer. That was the month in which he defected to the Red Army and almost immediately joined the Soviet backed National Committee for a Free Germany (NKFD / Nationalkomitee Freies Deutschland). He then undertook propaganda missions on behalf of the NKFD with the troops still fighting. From December 1944, in Soviet captivity, he undertook numerous assignments for the NKFD in the prisoner camps. From 1948 he was employed as a production manager in Camp 7351/6. He also attended an Anti-Fascist School in Tagil (near Moscow). East Germany When, in October 1949, he returned to what remained of Germany, Krüger found his home region in the Soviet occupation zone, which was by now being transformed into a separate German state called the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). His first job involved the registration of returning prisoners of war at the Gronenfelde Returnees Camp near Frankfurt (Oder). He then worked as a construction engineer/soil mechanic back in his birth town, with the Jüterbog Building Union.

Johann- Dietrich Wörner, ESA Director General On 18 December 2014, the European Space Agency announced that Wörner would assume the office of director general for four years on 1 July 2015. On 19 October 2016 Wörner claimed that the despite the crash at the attempted landing, the Schiaparelli mission was still a success from an engineering standpoint because of the data gathered. Not only was the parachute released early, but moreover the retrorockets fired for only 3s rather than the required 30s. The probe crashed into the surface at 300 km per hour, leaving a 40m wide impact site. In 2015, Wörner has proposed cooperation among countries and companies on lunar capabilities, a concept referred to as Moon Village.

The film incorporates computer-generated imagery to create seven real-seeming fictional amusement park rides used in a faux documentary film about the construction of physics-defying rides intended for use in research efforts to improve human cognitive function. Nowak was inspired to create the project when visiting an amusement park in 2008. Background Art installation Creating the sequences for the seven rides took three months, spread out through 2008 and 2011. After Nowak created the short as the three-minute video presentation The Experience of Fliehkraft, it was shared as part of the art installation \\"A Lot of Civilisation\\" at various museums and international venues during 2011. Blueprint renderings of seven unique rides were displayed while a looped video presentation repeated on several screens. In 2011, the 3-minute art piece was presented in November 2011 as part of the solo exhibition \\"A Lot of Civilisation\\" during \\"Walk of Art\\" at Prototyp Museum in Hamburg, Germany. It was also presented at Ars Electronica in Linz, where it was awarded with an honorary mention, and SIGGRAPH in Vancouver, British Columbia, where it received a juried runner up. In 2012, it was presented at the Transmediale in Berlin, the Seoul Biennale in South Korea, and the 7th edition of Media City Seoul. Most recently it was presented at the Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie in Paris as part of L' Art Robotique through January 2015. Short film As Nowak began sharing his faux blueprints and realistic clips as part of art installations, he also released The Centrifuge Brain Project. Its creation was inspired by his wish \\"to create an even stronger clash between realism and absurdity.\\" Choosing a realistic approach, he chose the mockumentary style to allow viewers \\"to feel as if they were eye witnesses\\", and \\"to enhance the impact of the idea.\\" As part of the film's plot, Nowak created the fictional \\"Institute for Centrifugal Research\\" as the researching firm and chose actor Leslie Barany for the role of Chief Engineer Dr. Nick Laslowicz. Barany was cast because of his ability to improv from the scripted lines to have them seem as if given in a real interview. Nowak related that \\"Barany was perfect for the role, because he turned out to be a very good liar.\\" Nowak had the monologue concept in his head for a while; the script was written just two days before filming. Nowak stated, > I had no technical reference for the short film. I created the manipulated > amusement rides and the techy talk just out of my own scientific humor. They > are a mix of real physics, absurdity and deliberate contradictions. The goal > was to create the biggest possible mistake, but still make it sound serious > and convincing. Filming took two days – one day in an actual amusement park and one day in a laboratory – and editing took two months. With the added storyline and the narration by Leslie Barany as Dr. Nick Laslowicz, the short film debuted in October 2011, at Filmfestival Münster. Its world premiere was on January 28, 2012 in France at the Clermont-Ferrand International Short Film Festival, followed by screenings on October 19 in Taiwan at the Kaohsiung Film Festival, November 17 in Germany at the Unlimited Film Festival Cologne. It showed on July 1, 2013 in the Czech Republic at the Karlovy Vary Film Festival, July 2 in France at the La Rochelle International Film Festival, and had its television debut December 21 on Yleisradio in Finland. After being published to YouTube in January 2013, the film received more than 3.3 million views. An unreleased alternate version has interview questions becoming so accusatory that Dr. Laslowicz becomes angry and walks away, cancelling the interview. Film synopsis Dr. Nick Laslowicz (Leslie Barany) speaks toward the discovery of how playground merry-go-rounds increase creative activity in children and discusses the investigation of centrifugal force on human development to expand the human mind. He explains how his company, the Institute for Centrifugal Research (ICR), officially doubts the generally accepted laws of physics and has developed tests of human mental endurance disguised as amusement rides. He then describes how ICR developed a series of experiments as rides, created to test and expand a subject's mental growth. The first was the 1977 prototype 6 G-force Vertical Centrifuge which self- destructed in 1978. ICR then joined forces with a company that built and distributed amusement park rides to develop projects and gain funding. Their first working machine was the 432-seat, 1.6 to 2.1 G-force \\"Spherothon\\" globular centrifuge in 1982. The second was 1985's 96-seat, 2.3 G-force \\"Wedding Cake Centrifuge\\", so named because of how its four platforms were layered one above the other. In 1991, ICR shifted its concentration to height, and developed the 2844-seat, 1-G \\"High Altitude Conveyance\\" (HAC), which initially confused riders who were unaware the ride took fourteen hours. ICR learned that passengers would suffer from boredom on rides that were too long, specially for those passengers who had fallen asleep, missed disembarking, and had to ride an additional fourteen hours. In 2005, a redesign of the HAC added toilets and oxygen masks. Dr. Laslowicz explains that to deal with the boredom issue, in 1993, ICR created the 18-seat, 1.1 to 3.6 G-force \\"Expander\\", as a ride with an interactive component. Finding this created brain activity, in 1996 ICR created the 126-seat, 2.7 G-force \\"Dandelion\\" to simulate the prenatal experience of an embryo. In 2003, ICR created the 10,000 horsepower 172-seat, 9-G \\"Steam Pressure Catapult\\" (SPC) to add a level of uncertainty which resulted in riders re-evaluating their own goals and aspirations. The last ride created was 2005's 12-seat, 17 G-force \\"Centriductor Schwingmaschine\\". Reception Carl Zimmer of National Geographic referred to the film as one of his favorites from 2012, writing > I like The Centrifuge Brain Project so much because it toys with science in > such a deadpan way–so deadpan that some commenters at Vimeo asked if the > crazy amusement park rides were real or not. And yet, in the end, it's not a > simplistic joke, but a short meditation on how we humans try to fight > gravity–and nature in general–both in the lab and at amusement parks. Writing in Huffington Post, Katherine Brooks called the film a hilarious mockumentary, adding \\"the visual renderings are mind-blowing enough.\\" DVICE offered that humans are thrill-seekers by nature, and explains that as the reason why some would \\"leap from a 1,149-foot-tall tower or wait in line to ride the world's steepest roller coaster.\\" They praised the film and its challenging the concept that brain activity would decrease when \\"riding high- speed, vomit-inducing amusement park rides,\\" and concluded that while they were unable to decide their favorite of the seven, they enjoyed how protagonist Dr. Nick Laslowicz \\"tries to convince us that 'gravity is a mistake' and that brain activity actually increases when a person experiences his terrifyingly impossible park rides. Obviously, as a joke, all logic is thrown out of the window.\\" Casey Chan of Gizmodo praised the film, writing \\"I don't like riding roller coasters because I'm a big weenie when it comes to mechanical excitement. But I have no problem believing that I would ride these ridiculously thrilling (and totally fake) roller coasters from the Centrifuge Brain Project,\\" and also praised \\"the fake doc who would go to these lengths to manipulate the brain and push excess G-Force on people.\\" Colossal writes that The Centrifuge Brain Project is \\"a brilliantly fun mockumentary\\". The Creators Project noted that people who like fast amusement park rides might scream to go faster even while being twisted upside down, but if they had the opportunity to ride the rides created for this film, their need for speed and terror would be well sated. They concluded \\"The film works because this detached documentary feel is intercut with mindboggling, fantastical rides brought to life with great skill—and reminiscent of Fernando Livschitz's films which put rides in the centre of cities like New York and Buenos Aires\\". Founding editor Joey Paur of Geek Tyrant wrote of The Centrifuge Brain Projects screening at San Diego Comic-Con 2012, calling it an \\"amazing short film\\", and expanding \\"out of all the films they ended up showing this was my favorite, and I can guarantee it's going to entertain the hell out of you!\\" First Showing wrote of the 14th Annual Animation Show of Shows at Comic-Con 2013 and labeled the film \\"incredible\\" and \\"worth watching\\", expanding that of the films screened, \\"one that really tickled our fancy was a live-action faux documentary called The Centrifuge Brain Project. The film follows the studies of pseudo-mad scientist Dr. Nick Laslowicz and his wild amusement park prototypes, brought to life by some impressive visual effects work.\\" TV QC wrote that the film is \\"a fun and especially brilliant documentary\\". GBTimes writes that with having seen his own \\"film hundreds of times in different movie theaters, sometimes with ten people, other times with 500 people in the audience,\\" Till Nowak loves to watch audience reactions as they watch the film, and is bemused that \\"some people have perceived it as a real documentary of real amusement parks.\\" He has stated, > there are actually still people, especially if they see it on the internet, > that really think everything is real. To me that is super interesting > because the film is also about our reception of media, how we believe > everything, how media can manipulate us. I had never expected that a lot of > people would believe the whole film. I thought okay, maybe the first half, > but then... For me as a filmmaker and my filmmaker friends, it is very > obvious. But people who are not working with the media, it is very > surprising for me, how much they believe. Sometimes it is a bit shocking – > but also an honor and a compliment because it means that the film was > convincing, and that to \\"amusement park enthusiasts it feels almost like a pity that these rides are not real.\\" He explains, > the bizarre thing is that if it would be possible, they would also exist. > The only reason these things do not exist in this crazy world that we live > in is that they are physically impossible.

History  The park was opened by Terry Waite and the then Mayor of Maidstone Paulina Stockell in 2001 as part of the millennium celebrations, using money provided by the National Lottery's 'lasting legacy project'. To mark the Millennium, hundreds of young childrens' hand and footprints were used as part of an art installation, as well as a piece of public art in the form of a 60-yard long double helix by Scottish sculptor David Annand. In recent years the park has hosted the Maidstone Mela, an annual world art, music and food festival, as well as various open air cinema events. Facilities The park features two children's playgrounds, a skate park, boardwalks which run through trees, an open air stage — the riverstage.http://www.visitmaidstone.com/things-to- do/whatman-park-p109911 Both of the river boats, the Kentish Lady and Allington Belle have request stops in the park.

The church is dedicated to Saint Sebastian. Arson In the year 2014 prior to Christmas was gutted by some anti social elements so as to create social unrest among the religious minority community listing one more incident of Anti-Christian violence in India. The Evangelical Fellowship of India condemned the burning of St. Sebastian's Church. The entire interior of the Church building, including the Altar, the Holy Bible and Cross were reduced to ashes. The church was constructed in 2001 in East Delhi. The forensic team that was investigating found traces of kerosene inside the church premises Delhi Archbishop Most Rev. Anil Couto said \\"The arson in St. Sebastian's church was condemnable not just because it was an act of sacrilege and hate against the community and its faith, but that it could happen in the national Capital which is just recovering from a series of communal incidents.\\" The act of sacrilege and hate against the Christian community is carried with impunity with very often law agencies remaining silent spectators. This will dent the image of the present government within India and abroad and leave the minorities vulnerable and targets of hatred. Archbishop Couto demanded a judicial inquiry into the incident. Hundreds of Christians protested the arson in Delhi, and the continued persecution of Christians in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and other tribal and rural areas. Responses There was no response of the ruling Govt. of India on this making this minority community upset. But the incident was criticized internationally including a scathing editorial by the New York Times stating that \\"Attacks at Christian places of worship have prompted no response from the man elected to represent and to protect all of India's citizens.\\" Administration The church is a Latin Rite church administered by Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Delhi, an archdiocese of Catholic Church in India. Parish Council There is also a parish council of the church whose members take decisions regarding the welfare of Church people, the decisions regarding feast celebration, organisation of camps are taken with the consent of parish members. Monthly meeting is held for this purpose. Youth Indian Catholic Youth Movement being the apex body under the auspices of Catholic Bishops' Conference of India works for the development of Christian youth helps the upcoming Christian youth various seminars, Retreat camps are simultaneously organised for and by youth with the helping hands of parish council members.

Located in a strategic point along the southern coast, the fort was constructed to defend the anchorage from attacks by pirates and corsairs, that frequented this region of the Atlantic during the Age of Discovery. Contemporary archaeological campaigns during the 20th century attempted to ascertain if this forte constituted one of the oldest in the archipelago, yet this never conclusively validated by documented sources. In fact, the oldest forts in the Azores have been validated in Terceira and São Miguel: Castle of São Cristóvão (1460), in the Alto dos Moinhos, Angra do Heroísmo; the Fort of São Brás (1551) in Ponta Delgada; and the Fort of São Sebastião (1572) over the Porto das Pipas, also in Angra dor Heroísmo. History A view from the scenic overlook at the remains of the fort A portion of the remaining two-storey structure used for kitchen and barracks One of the openings used as windows or emplacements The main courtyard, used during the Maré de Agosto Festival as a secondary stage The beach on which the fort was raised was, in 1584, referred to as Plaia Hermosa, based on the Castillian language, owing to Spanish dominion of the region at the time.Carlos Luís M.C. da Cruz (2007), pp.2 The same author (Luís Teixeira), later (1587) indicated that this region served within the religious parish of Figueira () which, before its construction, included little more than 40 people, in an area called Praia Fremosa. English privateers (1599) and, later, Algerian Barbary coast pirates (June 1616) used this beachhead in their assaults on the island, the latter resulting in major damage to Vila do Porto.Guedes (1996), p.1 Since 1599, the towns folk had requested that some defence be constructed to protect them from further assaults: :...and it was that the (general of the militia, Manuel de Sousa), who advised the town officials, that he felt it was necessary to guard the landing, so that when there were enemies, who wished to land, that fifty adventurous men, thirty arquebus and twenty pikes were always available and diligent to whatever enemy encounter, and that he requested of the same officials, that it was necessary that over the fajã of São Lourenço, a watch over that part [of the island], and that they should look daily into a watch position, so that they could determine where it was more accommodating to place a permanent watch in the summer, over the Beach where the enemies had entered, and another at Prainha and Touril when it was necessary to defend the land... Apparently, the initial requests were not taken seriously, and the 1616 incursion resulted in the cataclysmic destruction of Vila do Porto. In 1617, a new request was made directly to Philip III of Spain, by the third Donatary-Captain, Pedro Soares de Sousa.Guedes (1996), p.3 The memory of the 1616 catastrophe and these recommendations to the monarch, resulted in initial steps in 1618 to defend \\"the women and children and herds\\". The author of the building's construction is unknown, although it is speculated that Sergeant-major Marco de Teive, who visited the archipelago in 1630, may have had a hand in its construction, during his visit to Santa Maria. It is known that following the 1616 tragedy, in 1617 (by royal order) Captain Marcos Fernandes de Teive was sent to the islands to design and initiate construction of new battlements, in addition to reorganizing the militia.Pereira (1987), p.129Rezendes (2010) Yet, the work on the fortifications did not progress.Guedes (1996), p.4 In 1624, in order to speed up construction, Philip IV of Spain granted Brás Soares de Sousa (in compensation for his services in North Africa), the Command of the island of Santa Maria (through the Order of Jesus Christ), with the right to his privileges as of 24 June 1623. But, many of the resources were used in Royal Service, and the monarch imposed on Brás Soares de Sousa the obligation to donate, for five years, the land rents of the command towards the fortifications necessary for the island. These lands rents would be safeguarded in a separate coffer and only spent on the construction, by order of the Finance Council. Only after the completion of the public works, would those monies would be once again used for the repairs of churches as needed, as stipulated by Council for Religious Conscience and Orders. Two decades later (1638) the town hall registered: \\"A fortification on this island, that was started, but not finished.\\" By the Restoration Wars (1640-1668), due to the difficult circumstances of the civil authorities in Vila do Porto, the Crown provided monetary funds for the defence of Praia Formosa. But, even by 1664, the issue of artillery at the site had not been resolved, even as the King had ordered their installation in 1655.Guedes (1996), p.5 By Royal decree, on 6 August 1683, Vicente Pires Ferreira was placed in the position of constable for castles and redoubts, following the death of his father, overseeing the beach of São João and its fortifications. A few years later, Father António Cordeiro wrote of the defence of Santa Maria, referring to the castle located in Praia Formosa: :\\"The defence of the town, and all the island, was little before, which has a league of postos, where there could enter, and had entered three times Moors, English and French, but then they made the on the beach of the castle, two forts with 14 pieces and before it another, with a few; in the town, two forts with artillery;...but immediately, an artillery captain with 30 artillerymen, in addition to the Captain-major, officials and ordinance people...\\".Cordeiro (1981), p.144 Figueiredo (1960) referred to the bay of Praia and its fortifications in 1815: :\\"The Bay of Praia with a large areal of white sand, drains the Ravine of Gatos and of Praia, that has its four watermills, and three castles that were mentioned\\". \\"The Castle of São João Baptista in the site of Praia, with seven pieces, of which two are 12-calibre bronze and one lead 24-calibre canon and three of 7-calibre, but all in ruined condition\\".Figueiredo (1960), p.233 The \\"Relação\\" by field marshall Baron of Bastos, in 1862, informed the Crown, that the castle : \\"has a high barracks and a kitchen\\" and that it was in a state of ruin.Bastos (1997), p.269 By the end of the 20th century, there still existed two artillery pieces on the abandoned battlements, alongside the ruin structure (which since disappeared).Guedes (1996), p.7 A later periodical indicated: \\"The Câmara Municipal de Vila do Porto will proceed with the removal of the two, old pieces that exist in the abandoned small castle of Praia. Once they are recuperated, this pieces will be ceded to the Museum of Santo Espírito to be publicly exhibited.\\" Yet, there are no proofs that the pieces finally made it to the museum. In fact, there is speculation that any of those artillery-pieces may have joined the group in the Fort of São Brás in Vila do Porto. Ferreira (1997) registered the state of ruin of the fort, of what he defined as a 16th-century fort. Technical studies were made at the site, in order to recuperate the structure, by then in an advance stage of degradation and which was not registered for protection or classification. The grounds of the fort were used as a secondary stage (Palco Oportunidades - DRJ), during the 23rd Annual Festival Maré de Agosto in 2007. Between 27–28 September 2011, a storm with winds exceeding , heavy rainfall and waves affected the southern coast of the island), resulting in landslides that influenced the ruined structure, alongside the ravine. Consequently, the remaining portions of the structure continued to deteriorate.

The Stoke to Market Drayton Line was opened by the North Staffordshire Railway (NSR) in 1870. A station called simply Madeley was opened on the line in the same year. Within a few months; possibly to avoid confusion with the LNWR station that was, at least, on the edge of Madeley; the station was renamed Madeley Manor after the nearby, abandoned house of that name. By August 1871 the name had been changed yet again to Madeley Road. The station had no goods facilities and due to its rural location passenger use was low and in 1931 the London, Midland and Scottish Railway closed the station. An indication of how little usage the station received is shown by the LMS estimate that only £92 per year was saved by closure of the station. The line through the station remained in use until the closure of Silverdale Colliery in 1998. Present day Madeley Road still has track in situ and is out of use.

Robert Montgomery, son of the aforementioned George and Jean let the side down and died aged 68, however his brother Hugh restored the family's reputation for longevity and died aged 80 on 24 February 1766.Paterson, Page 271 Hugh had been the Provost of Campbeltown in Argyll and Bute.Paterson, Page 276 Charles Montgomery of Broomlands inherited, however he sold the estate and died in the 1780s unmarried after a career as a merchant burgess in Glasgow.Paterson, Page 277 Jean Montgomerie was Charles's eldest sister and she married Henry Eccles of the excise. Robert Hamilton of Bourtreehill held Broomlands before the property was acquired by Archibald Montgomerie, 13th Earl of Eglinton, his great-grandson. Family history Charles Montgomery of Broomlands believed that he was a male heir of the Eglinton line of the Montgomery family with precedency over the Lainshaw branch and employed Mr Dickie of Kilmarnock to produce a family tree of such a size that stretchers of wood were needed when it was opened. The Montgomery of Assloss family were a cadet branch of the Montgomerys of Broomland, however this line ended with an heiress, Jane Montgomery who married James Sommerville of Kennox near Stewarton.Robertson, Page 23 Robert Montgomery of Broomlands, a banker, represented the line of the Hammils of Roughwood through his great-grandfather Robert Montgomery of Craighouse who had married Anna Hammil.Robertson, Page 374 Robert Montgomery of Broomlands married Jane Haldane, granddaughter of William Cunninghame of Lainshaw.Robertson, Page 319 The estate The lands of Broomlands consisted of the 'Little,Aitken Upper or Over Broomlands' and 'Nether Broomlands'.Paterson, page 275 East Broomlands and Broomlands Cottage are also recorded, however inclusion within the estate is not clear. Fencedyke and old Hiemyre was sold by Irvine Council to Montgomerie of Broomlands at an unspecified date.Strawhorn, Page 74 The 1856 OS map shows Nether Broomlands with farm-like outbuildings and a 'superior' dwelling facing an ornate garden with eight parterre-like beds that are absent by 1805,OS Map : Ayrshire, Sheet XVII Survey date: 1856.

By 1908 coal pits near Nether Broomlands were disused, as was Broomlands Coal Pit No.7., however the Broomlands Miners Rows on Station Brae at Dreghorn are still present and Broomlands Coal Pit No.8 was still operational.OS Map : Ayrshire Sheet XVII.SW Publication date: 1911.

He later appears in spin-off works by other writers. Nym is a soldier and criminal follower of Sir John Falstaff and a friend and rival of Ancient Pistol. In the plays In The Merry Wives of Windsor Nym is one of Falstaff's servants along with Pistol. He and Pistol refuse to assist Falstaff's plan to seduce both Mistress Ford and Mistress Page, considering it beneath them. He informs Page and Ford that Falstaff \\"loves\\" their wives. In Henry V we learn that Nym has been courting Mistress Quickly. He gets into an argument with Pistol when he learns that she has married Pistol. Pistol tells him to find prostitute Doll Tearsheet and marry her. Bardolph reconciles the two. The three of them join Henry's army, hoping to profit by looting in France. We later learn that Nym has been hanged for looting. Role Nym's name is probably derived from the old English word \\"nim\\", meaning \\"to take\\", referring to his propensity for thieving.Davis, J. Madison, The Shakespeare Name Dictionary, Routledge, 2004, pp.341-2. Nym's extremely curt and disconnected style of speech contrasts with Pistol's expansive bombast, which is full of florid grandiosity and garbled intellectual references. In contrast, Nym explains everything by his \\"humour\\", meaning his mood or inclination, which suggests that his character was designed as a parody of Ben Jonson's \\"comedy of humours\\". According to Gail Paster, Nym uses his \\"humour\\" to justify his behaviour, as a rationale for unprovoked \\"impulsiveness and aggressiveness\\".Paster, Gail, \\"The Humor of it: Bodies, Fluids and Social Discipline in Shakespearean Comedy\\" in Dutton & Howard (eds), A Companion to Shakespeare's Works, The Comedies, John Wiley & Sons, 2008, pp.50-1. Nym's laconic and sometime gnomic utterances are explained by the Boy in Henry V as a result of a confused idea that terse speech makes a man seem serious, A notable example of Nym's speech patterns occurs when Nym informs Master Page of Falstaff's plan to seduce his wife; he manages to be both curt and pointlessly repetitive, with additional obscure assertions: In other literature Nym plays a major role in William Kenrick's play Falstaff's Wedding (1766 version), in which he plots with Pistol to deceive Justice Shallow and Abraham Slender (from Merry Wives) to marry the disguised Mistress Quickly and Doll Tearsheet respectively. Shallow discovers the plot. He and Slender switch places with Nym and Pistol, who end up married to Quickly and Doll, as is implied in Henry V.Kendrick, W., Falstaff's Wedding, A Comedy: as it is acted at the theatre Royal in Drury- Lane. Being a sequel to the Second Part of the play of King Henry the Fourth. Written in imitation of Shakespeare. In magnis voluisse sat est. London. Printed for L. Davis and C. Reyers, in Holborn; and J. Ayan, in Pater-noster- Row. 1766. James White's book Falstaff's Letters (1796) purports to be a collection of letters written by Falstaff and his cronies, found in an archive owned by a descendant of Mistress Quickly's sister. A letter from Pistol to Falstaff says that \\"the Nym is a pauper vile - I do retort - hath not utterance to woo his dog to bite at badger\\". A letter jointly signed by Nym and Pistol is written in a conflation of their different styles.White, James, Falsteff's Letters, London, Robson, 1877, p.39, 49. In Vaughan Williams' opera, Sir John in Love the role is sung by a baritone. On Screen (Film and Television) *On film, in the acclaimed 1944 Laurence Olivier version of Henry V, Nym was played by Frederick Cooper. In that version his execution was neither mentioned or shown, as the British public much needed a boost in morale from World War II, and Olivier felt Henry needed a more chivalrous depiction. *In the 1964 film Falstaff aka Chimes at Midnight, although it was primarily Orson Welles' take on Henry IV, in which Nym did not appear, a couple of his scenes from Henry V were interpolated, in which he was played by an uncredited actor. *In the 1989 Kenneth Branagh version he was played by Geoffrey Hutchings and in that version his death was shown, but not by hanging; instead he is slaughtered by French army deserters while he and Pistol are robbing bodies of their fallen comrades during the Battle of Agincourt sequence. *Three soldier characters in the film Cold Mountain are named Bardolph, Nym and Pistol. *On television, in the 1960 series An Age of Kings which was a presentation of Shakespeare's history plays, Nym was played in the Henry V episodes by David Andrews. *in the 1979 version of Henry V which was part of a series of BBC presentation of plays by Shakespeare, Nym was played by Jeffrey Holland, in which his execution was mentioned as in the play but not actually shown. In The Merry Wives of Windsor which followed during the 1982 season, he was played by Michael Robbins. *In a taped 1989 stage performance of Henry V that was part of Michael Bogdanov/Michael Pennington's English Shakespeare Company's Wars of the Roses series, he was played by John Dougall. Again his execution is referenced but not shown. *In the Henry V filmed as part of the 2012 Hollow Crown series, he was played by Tom Brooke.

Its members fulfilled various non-combatant roles in the army during the First World War, the Second World War and the period of conscription after the Second World War.Felicity Goodall, A Question of Conscience: Conscientious Objection in the Two World Wars (Stroud UK, 1997)Denis Hayes, Challenge of Conscience, Allen & Unwin (London UK, 1949) First World War The Non-Combatant Corps was first established by Royal Warrant in March 1916 as a result of the Military Service Act 1916, which introduced conscription in Britain for the first time. The British Army, which had no precedents or guidelines for conscription, formed the corps to provide a military unit for a category of conscientious objectors who had been conscripted but were prepared to accept only non-combatant duties, which was guaranteed in the case of the NCC.BBC News, Conscientious objectors in prison dated 4 November 2009 It was commanded by regular army officers and NCOs, and its members wore army uniform and were subject to army discipline, but did not carry weapons or participate in battle.Hansard, House of Commons debate 13 August 1919, (Volume 119, cc1292-3) Their duties were mainly to provide physical labour (building, cleaning, loading and unloading anything except munitions)Hansard, House of Commons debate 6 March 1918, (Volume 103, cc1958-9) for the rest of the army, both in the British Isles and overseas. Conscientious objectors directed to the NCC but who refused to serve were court martialled and imprisoned. Approximately 3,400 registered conscientious objectors accepted call-up into the NCC. In a House of Commons debate on 13 August 1919, Winston Churchill, Secretary of State for War, stated that with respect to the Army, the members of the NCC \\"must be regarded as soldiers, and not as conscientious objectors\\", as it was \\"entirely composed of men whose conscience permits them to serve as British soldiers, though it does not permit them to take human life\\". The NCC received lesser pay than most other soldiers and were generally held in lower esteem by British society.Michael Snape, God and the British Soldier: Religion and the British Army in the First and Second World Wars (Routledge, 7 May 2007), 193.Jeremy Paxman, Great Britain's Great War (Penguin UK, 3 Oct 2013). The Corps was disparagingly referred to as the 'No-Courage Corps' by some sections of the British press, and as the 'Pick and Shovel Brigade' by The Times newspaper.Ann Kramer, Conscientious Objectors of the First World War: A Determined Resistance (Pen and Sword, 30 Nov 2014), 74-77. The NCC's establishment was opposed by the pacifist No-Conscription Fellowship. The Corps were refused the January 1919 army pay increase, and they were denied any final gratuity. The NCC was demobilised more slowly than combatants and it was not finally disbanded until January 1920.Alan Wilkinson, The Church of England and the First World War (Lutterworth Press, 30 Jan 2014), 49. Second World War The NCC was re- formed during August 1940, just over a year after conscription was reintroduced.Rachel Barker, Conscience, Government and War: Conscientious Objection in Great Britain 1939-1945 (London, 1982), 24-6. The corps was composed of conscripted men who had been registered as non-combatants by tribunals.Rachel Barker, Conscience, Government and War: Conscientious Objection in Great Britain 1939-1945 (London, 1982), 78-85. Unlike in the Great War, there were also enlisted members of the NCC who had been deemed not physically competent for combatant service.Imperial War Museum - BRITAIN'S HOME FRONT 1939 - 1945: NON-COMBATANT CORPS http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/205082358 This gave the Corps less of a stigma than it had twenty five years earlier. It was divided into 14 companies, commanded mostly by veteran officers of the First World War and reservists. During the course of the war 6,766 men served in the NCC, of whom 465 volunteered to specialise in bomb disposal, on attachment to the Royal Engineers but remaining in the NCC. In 1944-45 some volunteered for transfer to the Royal Army Medical Corps, while retaining their non-combatant status, in order to join Parachute Field Ambulance units dropped over France on and after D-Day. Others worked in army stores, transport, agriculture, forestry, or on other projects 'not involving the handling of military material of an aggressive nature'. As in the First World War the NCC was part of the army, not a civilian unit. During the war some members of the NCC renounced their conscientious objector status in order to serve in combat roles, sometimes as examples of German war crimes came to public attention,Ernest Spring, Conchie: The Wartime Experiences of a Conscientious Objector (London, 1975), 12-42. just as some men who had originally accepted call-up into the ordinary armed forces changed their minds, and claimed conscientious objection. The Corps was disbanded for a second time when conscription finally came to an end in 1963. In popular culture In the fictional television series Danger UXB, Private John Brinckley, a Quaker, is a member of the NCC in the Second World War. Assigned to Lieutenant Brian Ash's 347 Section of 97 Tunnelling Company, Brinckley reconsiders his objections to war and requests reassignment to the Royal Engineers. He later is sent to Officers Candidate School, is commissioned, and is trained as a bomb disposal officer. The storyline derives from an actual NCC member who took that path.

It lobbied for the sensitive restoration of old buildings instead of their demolition. It also proposed a modern tram system in Dublin instead of destructive road proposals. It was known for using large campaigning banners draped on historic structures. The first meetings of the group were held in the School of Architecture in the Dublin Institute of Technology, Bolton Street, Dublin 1. The group was initially set up by four students of architecture: Orla Kelly, Eunan McLaughlin, Roísín Murphy,and Brian O'Brien. They were soon joined by other students from the Dublin Institute of Technology, University College Dublin, Trinity College Dublin and the National College of Art and Design.  Chronology  In June 1987, it campaigned to protect buildings on Clare Street in Dublin 2 that were threatened with demolition by the National Gallery of Ireland. In November 1987 it organised a symposium on Dublin's future in the Dublin Institute of Technology, Bolton Street. In December 1987, it helped organised a large protest march to Dublin's City Hall on Cork Hill to campaign against the City Council's proposals for an 'Inner tangent' road proposed to run through Clanbrassil Street, Dublin 8\\\\. In January 1988, it continued to campaign against road proposals.'Uproar as council fails to vote on road plan' Irish Times 5 January 1988'The Fight Goes On' Evening Herald 12 January 1988 It was successful in seeking changes that reduced the eventual width of the redesigned street. In the same month it also campaigned unsuccessfully to save an historic Quaker meeting House in Gray Square in Dublin's Liberties from demolition. The following month members of the group addressed a meeting of the City Council and urged it to abandon its controversial road plans.'Students urge Corporation to drop road plan' Irish Times 12 February 1988 In February 1988'Hospital gets order against students' Irish Times 29 February 1988 members of the group occupied buildings on Eccles Street that were in the course of being demolished by the Mater Hospital and halted their demolition.'Hospital says Georgian houses will be restored' Irish Times 7 March 1988 In March 1988 it held an exhibition in the Atrium in Trinity College Dublin entitled 'Tempest, a storm in the mildness of the Millenium Year'.'SAD Success' Sunday Tribune 27 March 1988 The group made submissions to Dublin City's draft City Development Plan in June 1988. In August the organisation spoke at a Bord Pleanála hearing and argued for the retention of buildings on Dublin's Harcourt Terrace.'Cheaper to refurbish buildings, experts admit' Irish Times 5 August 1988 Later that year it campaigned against the comprehensive redevelopment of Dublin's Bachelor's Walk and produced a postcard entitled 'Don't destroy the central river bank of Ireland''Postcard Protest' Irish Times 10 December 1988 featuring a facsimile of a ten-pound note. In January 1989, members of the group occupied buildings on Dublin's Arran Quay to try and halt their demolition. Several members of the group became members of the Green Street Trust that was set up in that year to undertake urban renewal projects including the refurbishment of the Debtors' Prison Dublin. In January 1991, it held an exhibition entitled 'Cartoonatics''Fighting back for the future of the capital' Evening Press 8 January 1991 in the City Arts Centre in Dublin's Moss Street. In March 1991 it argued for a 'dedicated truckway' to remove heavy traffic from Dublin's city centre, instead of an 'Eastern Bypass' road.'Truckway can remove need for eastern Bypass says students' Irish Times 8 March 1991 In September of that year the organisation addressed a meeting of the General Purposes Committee of Dublin Corporation suggesting that the Corporation seek European funding for public-transport and traffic-management projects. In 1990, the organisation made a submission to Phase One of the 'Dublin Transportation Study 1990' seeking the re-establishment of the Dublin Transportation Authority. As a result, SADD was asked to become a member of the Consultative Committee of the Dublin Transport Initiative (DTI) which operated from 1991–95. The DTI recommended construction of a 3-line light rail system which, in a slightly truncated form, became the Luas system which opened in 2004. In the late 1980s Dublin Corporation saw older buildings as a problem and wider roads as a solution. The vision for the city centre proposed by senior staff of the local authority was fundamentally flawed. SADD challenged this model and while it lost several key battles, it won the war in proposing a Living City based on a strong residential population in the inner city, and investment in walking, cycling and public transport. The Irish Times statedIrish Times 31 January 2015 that SADD '...took the discussion out of drawingrooms and relatively polite meetings into the streets – occupying threatened buildings, staging well-flagged protests and acting as shock troops against road-widening schemes that had done so much damage to the inner city's fabric.' Many of the key figures in SADD currently work in architecture, planning, design and environmental management and are contributing to improving urban life in Dublin and elsewhere.  Membership  Members included the following: Helen Blake, Owen Browne, Niall Chadwick, Ciaran Cuffe, Enda Finlay, Michelle Howard, Livia Hurley, Garret Kelly, Orla Kelly, Sinead Lynch, Donal McCarthy, Eunan McLoughlin, John McLaughlin, Conor Moloney, John Munro, Roísín Murphy, Colm Murray, Brian T O'Brien, Darragh O'Brian, Jerome Ó Drisceoil, Catherine O'Malley, Suzie O'Reilly, Anna Rackard, Colmán Ó Siochrú, John Parker, Michael Punch, Grainne Shaffrey, Blaise Smith, Ciaran Swan, Gráinne Weber.

Since selling Pictionary, he has gone on to invent board games and products. Most of his life is spent drawing fruit and surfing the Pacific Angel currently lives in Seattle and is involved in multiple non profit companies. Early life Angel was born in Vancouver, Canada in 1958. He moved to the US at the age of 5 with his family, they lived in Spokane, WA. Angel attended Joel E Ferris High School, graduating in 1976. He then went on to Western Washington University and graduated in 1981 with a 2.9 GPA (he pioneered the idea of grades don't matter). In 1982, he spent 5 months backpacking/hitchhiking throughout Europe. Upon his return to Spokane he moved in with 3 high school friends, which is when Pictionary was first conceived. Career In 1982, following his graduation from Western Washington University with a degree in Business Administration and while working as a waiter, Angel invented Pictionary. After work, Angel would gather with friends to play a version of the game that required each player to randomly locate a word in the dictionary, then sketch it for his teammates. Two years later in 1984, Angel moved to Seattle and found his old notes on the game. After a few positive play tests with family he decided to go for it. Knowing the words for the game were critical, he went into his back yard and read the entire dictionary to compile the original word list. Two others then joined the company and they produced the first 1,000 games in Angel's apartment. Angel and his business partners Terry Langston and Gary Everson first published Pictionary in 1985 through Angel Games, they managed to sell 6,000 copies in one year at $35 each. They licensed the game in 1986 in a joint venture between The Games Gang and Western Publishing. Then in 1994, Hasbro took over publishing after acquiring the games business of Western Publishing. In 2001, Pictionary was sold to Mattel. At that time they were in 60 countries and 45 languages, with 11 versions just in the US and a total of 32,000,000 games sold worldwide. Angel developed another game adult board game called ThinkBlot. While the game was not as successful as Pictionary, it was still a hit for 2 years. Angel has also worked as a producer, known for Finding Hillywood (2013) (aka Film Festival: Rwanda), the 1997 game show Pictionary, and It Snows All the Time in 2015.

December 11, 1528) was a bishop of the Unitas Fratrum, one of the most significant theologians of the Bohemian Reformation. Luke of Prague was born in Prague in the late 1450s and grew up in Prague.C. Daniel Crews, Faith Love Hope: A History of the Unitas Fratrum (Winston-Salem: Moravian Archives, 2008), 134. He attended University of Prague where he studied the standard church fathers and medieval teachers but was also exposed to the writings of Petr Chelčický.Rudolf Říčan, The History of the Unity of Brethren, trans.

Daniel Crews, “Luke of Prague: Theologian of the Unity.” The Hinge: A Journal of Christian Thought for the Moravian Church 12, no. 3 (2005): 23. Luke encountered the Unitas Fratrum around the time he graduated from University and after reading some their writings and meeting with members in Litomyšl, decided to accept their basic principles and become a member.Říčan, History of the Unity, 50. Around the time that Luke joined the Unitas Fratrum, the “seclusionary and narrow views” of the early members of the Unity were being challenged by views that “were not so completely terrified of any involvement in the outside world.”Crews, “Luke of Prague,” 24. During this difficult time, Luke and three other members were sent to find a Christian community “fully keeping and living the “apostolic faith.”Crews, History, 139. Luke travelled to through the Balkans and covered the Turkish lands in Europe and Asia but did not find any such communities. Luke wrote Bárka [The Ship] in 1493 as an allegorical tale where the Unity was depicted as a boat that was weathering a storm.Crews, “Luke of Prague,” 25. The Ship sought to address the issues that were dividing the Unity but also illustrates Luke’s theology that “involves a full dependence on Christ.”Crews, “Luke of Prague,” 25. The Unitas Fratrum went into an open schism in 1495 with the church divided into the Minor Party representing the views of the early members of the Unity and the Major Party backing the ideas of Luke and other newer members. The viewpoint of Luke and those that felt similarly ultimately prevailed at a Synod in Rychnov in 1494.Crews, “Luke of Prague,” 26. Luke was elected to the Inner Council of the Church at that Synod.Crews, “Luke of Prague,” 26. Luke was the head of the Unity when the Protestant Reformation began and corresponded with Martin Luther.Nola Reed Knouse, The Music of the Moravian Church in America (Rochester: University of Rochester Press, 2008), 277.

De Budapest à Hollywood: Le théâtre hongrois et le cinéma hollywoodien 1930-1940 (Rennes University Press, 2010), 359-362. Directed by Walter Lang, it stars William Powell and, in her American English- language debut, Annabella. Plot Johann Porok, a third-generation butler in the service of Count Albert Sandor, the Prime Minister of Hungary, is unexpectedly elected to the Hungarian parliament, representing the opposition social progressive party. Despite this, he insists on remaining a servant as well. Count Sandor is pleased with this peculiar arrangement, as he has found Johann to be the perfect butler and does not wish to break in a new man. His daughter, Baroness Katrina Marissey, however, considers Johann a traitor and treats him very coldly. In parliament, Johann attacks the Prime Minister, his employer, for yearly promising much to the poor underclass and delivering nothing, always citing \\"difficulties\\". To Katrina's puzzlement, the Count is not offended in the least and remains quite friendly with Johann. Within three months, Johann becomes the leader of his party. Katrina becomes more and more furious, finally throwing her purse and striking Johann in parliament during one of his scathing speeches. When his colleagues assume it was thrown by someone from the ruling conservative party, a brawl breaks out, and Johann and the Prime Minister hastily depart. Baron Georg Marissey, Katrina's husband and another member of parliament, later informs them that a vote of confidence was held after they left; the Count lost and will have to resign as Prime Minister. He is pleased to be able to spend more time with his wife. However, he reluctantly discharges Johann, as he has been neglecting his duties as head butler. They part good friends. When Katrina holds a ball, her ambitious husband invites Johann without her knowledge. Left alone together, Katrina gradually warms to Johann. Then he confesses that he loves her, and that is why he is trying to better himself, even though he knows his cause is hopeless. Katrina embraces and kisses him. They are interrupted by Georg and Major Andros, another ardent admirer of Katrina.

It is a remake of the Italian film Darò un milione (1936). Plot In the south of France, wealthy American businessman Tony Newlander is fed up with life. It seems everyone is friendly with him only because of his money or influence, including his ex-wife Cecilia and his valet. While on his yacht, he spots Louie, a tramp drowning in the water. Unable to attract the crew's attention over the sound of the ship's whistle, Tony jumps in to rescue him. The yacht sails away, so Tony drags a strangely uncooperative Louie ashore. It turns out that Louie was trying to commit suicide. However, since he has been saved, he desists from trying again. Louie takes him to his shack on the beach. The next morning, the tramp discovers that Tony has taken Louie's clothes and left his tuxedo and money behind in exchange. Louie dresses up in his new finery and goes to a cafe for breakfast. The proprietor thinks he stole the money he flashes. Louie insists that an eccentric millionaire, dressed like a tramp, gave him a million francs and will do the same to anyone who is kind to him in his disguise. A reporter publishes his story, and soon everyone is being extra generous to anybody who looks down on his luck. Meanwhile, Tony encounters a mischievous chimpanzee named Darwin. Jean Hofmann, a performer at the Circus Primerose, enlists Tony to capture Darwin. The chimp indulges in a favorite pastime, setting off a fire alarm. Tony is blamed for the rash of phony alarms, taken into custody and sentenced to ten days in jail. However, after the judge reads the newspaper article, he lets Tony go. Tony flips a borrowed coin, which sends him to the circus. Jean gets Anatole Primerose, the proprietor, to give him a job as a relief night watchman. Meanwhile, tramps flood the region to take advantage of the situation. Soon there are complaints, and the newspaper editor is pressured to either produce the millionaire or retract the story. He in turn threatens to accuse Louie of murdering the millionaire and stealing his money and gives him one last chance to find the man. The police round up all the tramps in town for Louie to look over. Tony and Jean start falling in love, but to stop Max, the jealous son of the proprietor, from getting Tony fired, Jean lies (so she thinks) and tells him she is being friendly to Tony only because he is the millionaire. Unfortunately, Tony overhears her. To save himself from a possible charge of murder, Louie identifies a tramp at random as the millionaire: Kopelpeck. Disillusioned, Tony decides to end the charade and expose the imposter, but no one will believe him. In fact, he is thrown in jail for making a nuisance of himself. Jean bails him out. Then Tony discovers that Jean does not believe he is the millionaire. His identity is finally confirmed by the captain of his yacht and others. The public surrounds the police station, demanding to be compensated for their misguided efforts. To prevent a riot, Tony agrees to donate half a million to the poor and the same amount to the city, but only if Jean will marry him. She holds out for a while, but then gives in.

It occurred in the Dangam district of eastern Kunar province, in Afghanistan bordering on Pakistan. The offensive was launched by the Afghan Army on 22 December 2014 after Kunar province had been the site of armed clashes since 12 December 2014. It was a joint operation involving support from the Pakistan Army, aimed at destruction of TTP sanctuaries in Kunar province. Background Peshawar school attack On 16 December 2014, a group of seven members of the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), led by Abu Shamil who planned the attacks, accompanied by three Arabs and two Afghans who spoke Pashto and were from Eastern Afghanistan, conducted a terrorist attack on the Army Public School in the Pakistani city of Peshawar. They entered the school and opened fire on school staff and children, killing 145 people, including 132 schoolchildren, ranging between eight and eighteen years of age. TTP leaders operating in Afghanistan coordinated the attacks. A rescue operation was launched by the Pakistan Army's Special Services Group (SSG) special forces, who killed all seven terrorists and rescued 960 people. Pakistani pressure Pakistani Taliban were hiding in distant areas of Kunar and Nuristan provinces of Afghanistan. On 17 December, Pakistan's Chief of Army Staff General Raheel Sharif, accompanied by the Director General of the Inter-Service Intelligence, Lieutenant-General Rizwan Akhtar, went on a visit to Kabul to meet with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and General John F. Campbell, the commander of American and NATO forces in Afghanistan. According to the news sources in Pakistan, General Raheel asked for the handovers of TTP leadership and asked the Afghan government to act against hideouts of the Taliban terrorists in its territory. At the meeting with Afghan officials, General Raheel delivered a message to Afghan National Army's's Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Sher Mohammad Karimi, \\"to take decisive action against sanctuaries of the TTP or else Pakistan would go for a hot pursuit.\\" One intelligence official confirmed the message relayed to Afghan president and reportedly cautioned that \\"if Afghan authorities fail to act this time, we will explore all options, including hot pursuit.\\" In further talks, [General Raheel told the Afghan president that \\"Pakistan's military could eliminate TTP's sanctuaries in Kunar and Nuristan on its own but was showing restraint due to Afghanistan's sovereignty and territorial integrity. President Ashraf Ghani assured General Raheel that his country would take all the necessary steps to root out the terrorists. A joint operation against the Taliban was also discussed with the Afghan leadership. In a media report published in The Nation, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif released a separate statement to Afghan president on a \\"hot pursuit\\" and has sent a message to Kabul reportedly stressing: \\"Wipe out Taliban or we will.\\" Earlier in June 2014, it was reported by Afghan officials that the Pakistan Armed Forces had started an offensive in Kunar province, an allegation denied by Pakistani foreign office. Pakistani officials said that Afghan army was committing border violations and was involved in cross-border attacks. On 24 December 2014, Afghan Army chief General Sher Mohammad Karimi and ISAF Commander General John Campbell while on a visit to Pakistan Army's GHQ in Rawalpindi, achieved consensus to continue coordinated operations and eliminate the TTP sanctuaries in Afghanistan. A Pakistani military official said, \\"It (Kunar) was a coordinated operation. The Afghan side shared information with us and we took measures on our side.\\" An ISPR statement added: \\"Both leaders assured their full support in fight against terrorism and eliminating terrorists on Afghan soil.\\" Insurgents from Pakistan and Afghanistan attacked Afghan army posts in Dangam district of Kunar province. As many as 2,000 militants were reported to be involved in the conflict. Fazlullah's presence In November 2009, Fazlullah told the BBC's Urdu Service that he had escaped from Pakistan to Afghanistan and warned that he would continue to attack Pakistani forces in Swat. After the death of Hakimullah Mehsud in a drone attack, Fazlullah was appointed as the new \\"Amir\\" (Chief) of the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan on 7 November 2013. He narrowly escaped a U.S. drone strike on 25 November 2014. After reports that Fazlullah masterminded the Peshawar school attack, Pakistan Army officials were pressured to kill him within 24 hours. On the other hand, Pakistani officials in turn have asked Afghan authorities to capture and hand over Fazlullah multiple times.

The Great Reform Act Plans and Reports map of 1832 does not show the tram roadGreat Reform Act Plans and Reports, 1832 that first appears in the 1856 OS maps.OS Map - Ayrshire, Sheet XVII. 17. Survey date: 1856. Publication date: 1860 The Towerlands Colliery at Dreghorn had closed by 1878, and the OS map of 1890 only names and indicates the route of the tram road without marking the colliery or the tram road tracks. Later OS maps mark the old colliery 'offices' as Towerlands Cottage. In keeping with other such tram roads the line was probably worked by gravity, manually and by horses.The Haytor Tramroad The use of horses is also indicated by the horse trough next to the line near Fencedyke.OS Map - Ayr Sheet XVII. 10 (Irvine). Survey date: 1856. Publication date: 1860 The use of steam locomotives is not consistent with the tram road's infrastructure as indicated on the OS maps, with right angle bends, gaps at road junctions, etc., although the short section of line to Dreghorn was different in this respect, and a locomotive-style run-round loop is suggestive of some form of steam engine being in use here. A 'tram' in historical terms was a low box-shaped four-wheeled cart or barrow used in coal mines,The Free Dictionary often without a flange on its wheels that were either wood with metal tyres or made from metal. A 'tram road' was a roadway built to permit the passage of trams or waggons and consists of parallel tracks made of metal plates or rails, carved stone blocks or wooden rails, often with metal traction surface strips attached.Merriam-Webster Dictionary Tramroads often run on roads that are also used by cars, pedestrians, etc. A small railway turntable such as could have existed at the Dreghorn exchange sidings One branch of the Towerlands Tram Road appears to have been relatively cheaply constructed to supply coal to the population of Irvine and to the Town Mill using horse drawn waggons or trams that used dedicated sections of tram road along the edge of the existing road in places, with a few diversions through fields where necessary. The horse-drawn waggons may have been able to continue and complete their journey into Irvine by road, and as noted a weighing machine was present at Townhead near the toll. The Dreghorn branch is not shown as being physically joined to the Irvine branch. The presence of a run-round loop and a siding at Towerlands Colliery may be suggestive of the use of a steam locomotive, which would require a heavier gauge of track. This section of the line was built for the export of coal via the exchange sidings located at Dreghorn railway station as shown on the 1856 OS map. Associated infrastructure The surfacing of the early 19th century roads outside of the town that were not surfaced with cobblestones would not have been sufficient to resist the wear and tear from a regular movement of heavy coal waggons, which may explain why the tram road was built and why it stopped close to the cobbled streets of Irvine town centre. It is not known what sort of sleepers were used; however, stone blocks were favoured on horse-worked lines, as they did not interfere with the centre of the track as do wooden sleepers that run right across the centre of the trackbed.Plateways A typical stone railway sleeper from the Kilmarnock and Troon Railway The Ordnance Survey maps show that weighing machines existed at both the colliery and at the Townhead turnpike in Irvine.OS map - Ayr Sheet XVII.13 (Irvine) Survey date: 1856. Publication date: 1860 The tram road gauge is not known, but the OS map depiction suggests that standard gauge of 4 ft 8.5 in. was in use on the Dreghorn section at least, as the Towerlands Colliery tram road ran on to standard gauge railway exchange sidings at Dreghorn railway station.OS Map - Ayr Sheet XVII.14 (Irvine) Survey date 1856. Publication date 1860 The route was not entirely fenced, such as at the 'on road' section running past Bourtreehill down to the Irvine municipal boundary where the fencing started and then continued down to the terminus near Springfield House. Operation of the tram road The tram road is reminiscent of transport systems such as the Cambridgeshire Guided Busway where dedicated busways have gaps for roads to cross and also sections of normal road that may lead on to other sections of guided busway. The Towerlands tram road had several places where short 'gaps' existed which presumably had no rails or plates, a gap at a 'T' junction, and near Irvine the route even crossed from one side of the road to the other without any physical connection of the 'permanent way'. If the coal was transported in waggons or trams with no flanges, then such gaps would not be a real problem, just an inconvenience. The routes The site of the tram road route at Mill Road in Irvine The tram road was divided into a section that ran from the Towerlands Colliery to the outskirts of Irvine and a short separate section that ran from sidings and a turn-round loop at the colliery to sidings at Dreghorn Station, running past the old Broomlands miners rows along the Station Brae Road without any 'breaks', suggesting that it was more of a standard railway than the tram road that ran to Irvine. The line joined the sidings at a right angle, indicating that a small turntable was used. The route towards Irvine ran through fields with two right-angle turns until it reached the road near Towerlands House, where it ran along the side of the road with a gap or 'break' opposite the lane that divided Towerlands estate from the old Bourtreehill estate and further along a break at the 'T' junction near Fencedyke on the road that leads to Irvine via Mill Lane. After the 'T' junction at Fencedyke, the tram road is shown to 'break' and cross to the other side of Mill Road at the municipal boundary.

A housing estate now occupies the site. The tram road's route survives in part, and the sections running into Irvine and Dreghorn are occupied by the Broomlands Busway that joins Mill Road.

After the outbreak of World War I, he declared his loyalty to France and joined the French Army. In response he was stripped of German citizenship August 5, 1914. After the Allied victory the provinces of Alsace-Lorraine returned to France, he was elected general counsel of the Lower Rhine in 1919 and became a socialist member of the French Parliament for the Bas-Rhin district. Early life Georges Weill was born in 1882 to the merchant Elias Weill and his wife Melanie Weill Dreyfus in Strasbourg. He came from a bilingual family living in the German-controlled Alsace-Lorraine. He attended secondary school in Strasbourg, the Faculté des Lettres (Sorbonne) in Paris, the law and political science faculty of the University of Strasbourg and received his PhD in 1904 as Doctor of Political Sciences in Strasbourg with the German economist Georg Friedrich Knapp. From 1900 to 1901, he was the editor of the magazine Le Mouvement socialiste in Paris, in 1902–1904 research assistant at the Chamber of Commerce in Strasbourg, in 1905 the editor of the Free Press in Strasbourg and in 1906–1910 editor of the Franconian Daily Mail in Nuremberg. His writings got him in trouble, and he frequently suffered fines because of press offenses and had two prison sentences. Political career From 1912 he was a member of the German Reichstag for the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) for the constituency of the Alsace-Lorraine city of Metz. He won the constituency against the previous mandate holder, the Lorraine protester Albert Grégoire, in the runoff election with the support of the Liberals. He was with famed socialist Jean Jaurès when Jaurès was assassinated on July 31, 1914. When war broke out in 1914 he joined the French Army on August 5 as an interpreter and publicly declared to stand on the side of France. For joining the French, he was stripped of his German citizenship and he lost his seat in the Reichstag. The German SPD disavowed him. From 1924 to 1928 and from 1932 to 1936, he was a member of the French National Assembly. In 1928, he was in a runoff election with candidate Jean-Pierre Mourer. He was vice president of the National Republican League (Ligue républicaine national), a party founded by former French President Alexandre Millerand. During the Second World War he lived in the city of Algiers. He died in Paris on January 10, 1970, at the age of 87.

History The Kingdom of Yugoslavia did not give to much attention to community of Yugoslavs in the Union of South Africa. The state did not send teachers, priests or financially assist local associations such as was the case with communities in North and South America. In 1941, According to the first Yugoslav general consul in Cape Town Stojan Gavrilović, the local community was in chaotic situation. In 1942 the Royal Yugoslav Army sent agents on a mission to Cape Town to recruit local male civilians of Yugoslav descent to help with the war effort. In 1952 Serbian community that left Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia after World War II founded a local Saint Sava church and school municipality in Johannesburg. In 1978. local Serbian Orthodox Church dedicated to Thomas the Apostle was built.

Later known as the Hotel Harris, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Description and history The Strathglass Building, 1906 The building was designed by the architectural firm of Stone, Carpenter & Willson, based in Providence, Rhode Island, and was completed by 1906.Brickbuilder April 1906: 86. It was built for Hugh J. Chisholm, the industrialist responsible for Rumford's development in the late 19th century as a major paper processing center. Chisholm named the building after the river in Scotland which flows near his family's traditional seat. Chisholm also gave the Strathglass name to the Strathglass Park District, an area of high-quality mill worker housing in Rumford. The Strathglass Building stands on a slightly non-rectangular lot bounded on three sides by Congress, Lowell, and Hartford Streets. It is a four-story brick structure, with the bays of the first three floors separated by engaged limestone fluted columns. The main entrance is set under a two-story arch supported by square stone piers, and topped by a triangular pediment at the top of the third floor. When originally built, the building only had three stories, and had a concrete balustrade with urns. this was removed in 1931, when the building was rebuilt after a devastating fire.Peterson, Jane W., Nghia Ha, and David Gawtry. \\"Fires in Rumford\\". http://foothills.mainememory.net/. n.d.

Volker Haucke (born 29 June 1968 in Berleburg, now Bad Berleburg, Germany) is a biochemist and cell biologist. He is Director of the Leibniz-Forschungsinstitut für Molekulare Pharmakologie Berlin (FMP) Berlin and Professor of Molecular Pharmacology at the Institute for Pharmacy of the Free University of Berlin.  Biography  Volker Haucke studied biochemistry at the Free University of Berlin and at the Biozentrum of the University of Basel (1989-1994) as a scholar of the German National Merit Foundation Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes. In 1997, he was awarded a PhD (\\"summa cum laude\\") in biochemistry by the University of Basel (Biozentrum) for his work in the laboratory of Gottfried Schatz on the mitochondrial protein import machinery. From 1997-2000 he was a postdoctoral fellow in the research group Pietro De Camilli at Yale University School of Medicine and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) funded by long-term fellowships from the Human Frontier Science Programme Organization (HFSP) and the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO). Since 2000 he led an independent research group funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft at the Centre for Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology at the University of Göttingen. In 2003, he became chair of the Department of Membrane Biochemistry at the Free University of Berlin. Since 2007, he is a member of the NeuroCure Cluster of Excellence. Haucke was spokesperson of the Collaborative Research Centres (SFB) 449 (Structure and Function of Membrane Integral Receptors, 2008-2010) and 958 (Scaffolding of Membranes - Molecular Mechanisms and Cellular Functions, 2011-2012, since 2012 Deputy Spokesperson.) Since 2012, Volker Haucke is Director of the Leibniz-Forschungsinstitut für Molekulare Pharmakologie (FMP) in Berlin and Professor (W3-S) of Molecular Pharmacology at the Freie Universität Berlin. At the FMP, he heads the Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Cell Biology. From 2008-2016 he was an elected member of the review board biochemistry of the German Research Foundation (DFG) and from 2007 to 2012 a member of the editorial board of the Journal of Biological Chemistry. He is currently a member of the editorial boards of EMBO Reports and Biology of the Cell, a member of the scientific advisory board of the open access platform Matters as well as a member of Faculty of 1000. For his work, he has received numerous awards. Since 2014 Haucke is an elected member of the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) and since 2017 a member of the National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina. In 2017 he received the Avanti Award of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB) and was awarded funding within the Reinhart-Koselleck program of the DFG. Volker Haucke is married and has two daughters.  Research interests  Volker Haucke and his group study endocytosis and exocytosis, the uptake of substances into and their release from cells via membrane-bound vesicles, especially in nerve cells. A further focus of his research is the elucidation of the mechanisms of intracellular membrane traffic in the endosomal and lysosomal system and its control by specific membrane lipids, so-called phosphoinositides. A specific focus of his research is the development of tools that target these processes and the development of high-resolution light microscopy techniques, with which these processes can be visualized directly in cells. His most important discoveries include the dissection of the mechanisms that control the recycling of neurotransmitter-containing synaptic vesicles and the development of the first selective inhibitors of clathrin- based cellular uptake processes. Moreover, Volker Haucke and his team have been able to identify signaling lipids and the enzymes that metabolize them that are of central importance for cellular transport processes and for the question of membrane identity, and, thus, the function of intracellular compartments. Loss or impairment of the activity or function of these enzymes can result in severe diseases that range from inherited muscle disorders via cancer to neurological and neurodegenerative disorders.

Synopsis Santiago (Matías Oviedo) is an unassuming DJ and gamer who accidentally finds himself overhearing gangster Che Longana (Jorge Alis) and his underlings trying to plan a hit on a bounty hunter known only as \\"Machine Gun Woman\\" (Fernanda Urrejola). Upon being discovered Santiago does the only thing he can: he offers to kill Machine Gun Woman and bring back her head to prove that she is truly dead. He decides that the best way to approach the situation is to treat the potential murder as he would a violent video game. He does manage to find Machine Gun Woman, but Santiago is unaware that Che's underlings have followed him with the intention to kill the both of them. Machine Gun Woman kills both underlings but spares Santiago out of pity.

Thirteen people were injured, two of them seriously. The alleged perpetrator had a record of mental disorder and no known links with terrorist groups. The local prosecutor said the incident was not linked to terrorism and the Interior Ministry believed that he had acted alone, although anti-terrorism investigators opened an inquiry into the attack. Attack In the space of half an hour, the alleged attacker, identified only as Nacer B, drove a Renault Clio van into groups of pedestrians in five separate areas of the city. Thirteen people were injured; two of them sustained serious injuries. The accused allegedly shouted Allahu Akbar, brandished a knife, and claimed that he was \\"acting on behalf of the children of Palestine.\\" According to Dijon city prosecutor, Marie-Christine Tarrare, the accused had become “very agitated” after watching a television program about the plight of children in Chechnya. Suspect The man arrested was reported to be \\"40-year-old man of Arab origin\\" and \\"Algerian and Moroccan descent.\\" He had been known to the police for minor offenses committed over the course of 20 years, and had repeatedly been treated for “serious and long- established psychiatric issues”. French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve described him as \\"very unstable\\". The local prosecutor said the incident was not linked to terrorism and the Interior Ministry believed that he had acted alone, although anti-terrorism investigators opened an inquiry into the attack. The Times described Dijon as a \\"apparently lone-wolf Islamist attack.\\" The Financial Times described it together with the attacks in Tours and Nantes as \\"the first Isis-linked attacks in the country.\\" According to The Globe and Mail, this attack was \\"apparently inspired by a video\\" circulated by ISIL calling on French Muslims to attack non-Muslims using vehicles. According to David C. Rapoport of the University of California, Los Angeles, these three attacks can be understood in the context of the rise of the Islamic State in Syria. \\"In September 2014, after the U.S. organized its airstrikes, the Islamic State’s chief spokesman called on Muslims in Western countries to find an infidel and ‘smash his head with a rock’, poison him, run him over with a car or ‘destroy his crops’. Two months later a video released in French contained virtually the same message, and a series of strange 'lone wolf' attacks followed on three consecutive days, the perpetrators declaring “'God is Great' in Arabic. Three policemen were stabbed in Joué-lès-Tours, and vehicles were used to run over eleven pedestrians in Dijon and ten in Nantes.\\" The Financial Times describes the 20 December 2014 Tours police station stabbing, this attack on 21 December, and the 22 December 2014 Nantes attack as \\"the first Isis-linked attacks\\" in France. In his 2017 book, Words Are Weapons: Inside ISIS’s Rhetoric of Terror, Philippe-Joseph Salazar, wrote that \\"the French government strenuously denied that (this and the 2014 Nantes attack) were terrorist attacks, but terrorist experts dissented, referring to them as examples of a 'low intensity permanent warfare.'\\" Citing this 2014 Dijon car attack, Mark Silinsky of the United States Army War College describes a view held by \\"some in the West... that political violence perpetrated by Muslims in the name of Islam is not and cannot be authentically Islamic... In this view, the perpetrators are fueled with a rage unconnected to any religion. Even when perpetrators roar “Allahu Akbar” or bellow praises for the Caliphate, these proclamations are dismissed as empty or misguided rhetoric.\\". In their 2017 article, Is there a Nexus Between Terrorist Involvement and Mental Health in the Age of the Islamic State?, Emily Corner and Paul Gil, describe this attack as example of the \\"tendency to try to dismiss the possibility of terrorism altogether\\" in instances where a \\"confirmed diagnosis\\" is available. Context In his 2017 book Migration, Terrorism, and the Future of a Divided Europe: A Continent Transformed, Christopher Deliso discusses this attack in the context of a series of \\"terrorist\\" attacks \\"carried out by immigrants (and new migrants)\\" using \\"very basic but deadly weapons\\" in Western countries, noting that this particular attack occurred after ISIS released a video calling on Muslims in France to run non-Muslims over \\"with your cars.\\" The attack has been described as one of a series of terror attacks on French soil, as a contemporary example of vehicle ramming as a terrorism tactic, and as one of the many ISIS-inspired lone wolf terrorist attacks worldwide. Impact In what The New York Times described as an effort \\"to reassure a jittery nation\\" government deployed 300 troops onto French streets \\"to guard against copycat attacks inspired by\\" the 20 December 2014 Tours police station stabbing, this attack on 21 December, and the 22 December 2014 Nantes attack on the city's Christmas market in which ten people were injured and one was killed. According to Public Radio International, these three attacks \\"prompted the French government to step up security at police and fire stations across the country.\\" According to Le Monde, following the series of three attacks police were ordered keep their weapons constantly within reach, even when inside their stations, and to wear their protective vests. In addition to these immediate responses by the French government, according to CNN security analyst Peter Bergen writing in 2016, this attack was one of a number of Vehicle-ramming attacks that forced police in a number of countries to reconsider methods of protecting crowded public spaces. According to The Times, this series of three attacks (Dijon, Nantes, Tours) caused Whitehall to move protective measures against \\"lone volatile extremist(s)\\" intent on committing vehicle ramming attacks \\"to the top of the agenda,\\" with a list of recommended measures including bollards, building design, and standards to insure that concrete sets properly. Manuel Valls, the Prime Minister of France, expressed his \\"solidarity\\" with the victims of the attack via Twitter.

He contributed to various anarchist journals before World War I (1914–18). Despite being a pacifist, he served in the army during the war. Afterwards he joined the French Communist Party, but was expelled in 1923 for his pacifist convictions. He wrote a number of books, both fiction and non-fiction, and founded the Ligue internationale des combattants de la paix (LICP: International League of Fighters for Peace). Life Henri Coudon was born in Marseille on 10 May 1876. He moved to Paris, where he joined anarchist circles and took the pseudonym Victor Méric. He contributed to Le Libertaire, where he became a friend of Gaston Couté and Fernand Desprès. He was one of the founders of the Association internationale antimilitariste in 1904. In 1906 Méric joined the revolutionary socialists and contributed to Gustave Hervé's journal La Guerre Sociale. In 1907 Méric and Henri Fabre created the periodical Les Hommes du jour, illustrated by Aristide Delannoy, which was a great success. They were convicted twice for \\"insulting the army\\" and spent one year in prison, where Delannoy died. From 4 June 1910 Méric published the periodical La Barricade. With the outbreak of World War I (1914–18), despite being pacifist he was mobilized and sent to the front line for four years. Victor Méric was one of the contributors to La Voix des femmes, founded in 1917 by Louise Bodin and Colette Reynaud. Others included Séverine, Marthe Bigot, Hélène Brion, Madeleine Pelletier, Magdeleine Marx, Romain Rolland, Henri Barbusse, Léon Werth, Georges Pioch, Georges Yvetôt and Marianne Rauze. The journal covered a broad range of opinions, with a radical left-leaning outlook. It demanded full sexual equality and emancipation. After the war Méric was enthusiastic about the Russian Revolution. In 1920 he joined the French Communist Party (PCF) and was elected to the steering committee of L'Humanité. Just after the end of the Tours Congress of 25–30 December 1920, pacifist intellectuals including Méric, Georges Pioch and others took a position of opposition to all war, including war for the defense of socialism. From 1921 he was opposed to the discipline of the Bolsheviks. In 1923 Méric was expelled from the PCF. Méric then participated in the Union socialiste communiste (USC: Socialist-Communist Union). In 1931 he launched the pacifist newspaper La Patrie Humaine and created the Ligue internationale des combattants de la paix (LICP: International League of Fighters for Peace). Victor Méric died of cancer in Paris on 10 October 1933. He was cremated on 13 October 1933 in the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

The film, a spoof of the devil-may-care motoring exploits of King Leopold II of Belgium, features the King engaging in a manic, implausibly fast automobile ride from Paris to Monte Carlo. The singer-comedian Harry Fragson stars as the King, supported by a large cast of stage performers from the Folies Bergère cabaret and other venues, with two cameo appearances from Méliès himself. Méliès, working in collaboration with the stage director Victor de Cottens, designed An Adventurous Automobile Trip as an innovative Folies Bergère act combining stage performance and film, with a live prologue and epilogue used to frame the filmed sequence. After this version premiered on 31 December 1904, Méliès adapted the film to be a standalone release for general distribution in 1905. The lavish film, available in both black-and-white and hand-colored versions, was a popular and critical success both in France and in America. However, the film's high production values made it too expensive for many exhibitors, one of several factors that sent Méliès's career into decline. Plot King Leopold, on holiday in Paris, wants to visit Monte Carlo, but does not have time for the seventeen-hour express train ride between the two cities. He happens upon an automobile maker who claims his car can make the distance in just two hours. The King agrees and sets off in the car, with the auto maker acting as chauffeur. A large crowd sees them off from outside the Paris Opera House, including many celebrities from the Paris theatre world. After stopping to fill the car with gas, the King starts it and, from inexperience, accidentally runs it backward over a policeman, who is squashed flat as a pancake. The King starts inflating him with a pump, and then, to save time, lets other onlookers finish the job while he drives off. The onlookers set to the work with gusto, so much so that the overinflated policeman ends up exploding. The car speeds over the French countryside and into the Alps, leaping between mountains and knocking over a postman as it goes. At the gates of Dijon, town officials try to stop the car to enforce the octroi tax, but the car keeps its course and runs headlong into one of the officials, who explodes in his turn. The car wends its way across the Mediterranean coast, overturning a fruit stand, crashing through a greenhouse, colliding with a tar wagon (with another explosion ensuing), and, finally, arriving at the grandstand of spectators awaiting them at Monte Carlo. The car is now going at such speed that, rather than stopping in front of the grandstand, it somersaults up the stairs and crashes to earth. The King and chauffeur, unharmed by their adventurous race, are greeted warmly. Production Frame from a hand-colored print of the film For the 1904 Folies Bergère cabaret revue, the director Victor de Cottens approached Méliès—then at the height of his fame as a filmmaker—with the idea of combining theatre and cinema by presenting a short film as one of the fourteen segments of the stage production. The two directors worked out a scenario that would parody the motoring adventures of King Leopold II of Belgium, who was famous for driving, and often crashing, fast cars. In the stage-screen amalgamation devised by Méliès and de Cottens, the segment began as a sketch with live performers before continuing as a film; at the end of the film, the actor playing the King, as well as other actors playing cheering spectators, returned to the stage to finish the sketch live. Méliès drew the cast of the film from various sources. Harry Fragson, a London-born singer and comedian who was one of the stars of the Folies Bergère at the time, played the lead role of King Leopold. Louis Maurel, a Paris singer and comedian who had worked with Fragson in the 1903 Folies Bergère revue, was the chauffeur. In the scene in front of the Paris Opera, the celebrities assembled include Jean Noté, a singer at the opera house; the short actor Little Pich, whose persona was a close imitation of the better-known British comedian Little Tich, and who also acted in films by Pathé Frères and the Gaumont Film Company; the tall actor Antonich, known as the \\"Giant Swede\\"; Félix Galipaux, who had been a popular music hall monologuist in Paris since the 1880s and who acted in several Méliès films; Jane Yvon, a Folies Bergère entertainer; Séverin Cafferra, a popular mime; and de Cottens himself. Fernande Albany, who also appeared in Méliès's films The Impossible Voyage, Tunnelling the English Channel, and The Conquest of the Pole, played the plump lady in the Dijon scene, and the Folies Bergère entertainers Blondet and Raiter also made appearances. Méliès himself plays two roles in the film: a mailman who gets knocked over by the car, and the octroi official who explodes. Méliès also cast more extras in the film than was usual for him, sometimes staging them in layered arrangements for visual clarity, and sometimes letting them move at whim to create more disorganized, naturalistic groupings. In addition to the parody of King Leopold II, Méliès's scenario for the film features another topical element: the scene with the tar wagon is based on the experiments of Ernest Guglielminetti, who spread tar over a small part of the gravel road to Monaco. This experiment, widely reported by the press, successfully eliminated the dust clouds kicked up by cars on gravel and sand roads. The film's special effects were created using stage machinery, miniature models, pyrotechnics, and the editing technique known as the substitution splice. Long shots showing the car were filmed with a miniature car and a landscape rolling past it, creating a multiplane effect. Most scenes, including the detailed and faithful recreation of the Place de l'Opéra outside the Opera House, were painted studio sets, as was Méliès's custom. However, the last scene, showing the arrival at Monte Carlo, was filmed not in the studio but outdoors in Méliès's garden. Release and reception The New Amsterdam Theater in 1905, the year An Adventurous Automobile Trip was shown there An Adventurous Automobile Trip premiered at the gala opening night of the Folies Bergère revue on 31 December 1904. It ran for six months at the Folies Bergère, lasting more than 300 performances. Méliès also intended for the film to be shown by exhibitors elsewhere, outside the context of the revue. Thus, after its Folies Bergère run, it was released as a standalone item by Méliès's Star Film Company and numbered 740–749 in its catalogues, where it is advertised as a grande course fantastique funambulesque. As with at least four percent of Méliès's output, the film was available both in black-and-white and in individually hand- colored prints sold at a higher price. The film was also released in the United States, by the New York branch of Méliès's company. During the summer of 1905, Klaw & Erlanger showed it at the Aerial Gardens, on the rooftop of the New Amsterdam Theatre. In the American release, the scenes were slightly rearranged: the first and second scenes were switched in order, as were the sixth and seventh. In addition, because of a renumbering, ten tableaux were advertised instead of the French catalogue's twelve, although no scenes were removed. (The two prints of the film surviving in the Méliès family's archive, the Cinémathèque Méliès, use the French ordering of the scenes.) Another discrepancy between the French and American catalogues occurs for political reasons: the American catalog specifies that the protagonist is King Leopold, but the French one keeps the identity anonymous, so as not to offend Belgian audiences. Similarly, the Alps in the film are named as such in the American catalog but are unnamed in the French one. Georges Méliès An Adventurous Automobile Trip was one of Méliès's most successful films, and ran to acclaim at the Folies Bergère for six months. A notice in The New York Clipper said that the film \\"is very clever, and keeps the audience in continuous good humor\\". The Morning Telegraph concurred, reporting that the film \\"scored an instant success. Nothing funnier has been seen here in many a day. ... The thing is a scream.\\" However, the venture was not as profitable as Méliès had expected; the high costs of the lavish hand-colored film put it out of the reach of many fairground exhibitors. These financial difficulties, which continued with Méliès's similarly spectacular film The Merry Frolics of Satan the following year, helped hasten the decline of Méliès's career. Portions of at least three prints of the film survive: a complete nitrate print with the car sometimes painted red, given to Méliès's granddaughter Madeleine Malthête- Méliès by an American collector; an incomplete hand-colored nitrate print, bought by Malthête-Méliès from a Belgian collector; and some fragments at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. In his book-length study of Méliès, the film historian John Frazer spoke highly of the film, noting its careful use of continuity of direction and comparing it to Mack Sennett's slapstick comedies and to the 1968 automobile film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Méliès made another film in a similar vein, Le Raid New York–Paris en automobile, in 1908; it was also received with success.

Built in 1846-47 and substantially altered in the early 20th century, this expansive two-story wood-frame structure is a bold statement of Greek Revival architecture, and is an early work by a notable local master builder of the period, Joseph Bigelow. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history The main block of the Bigelow-Page House is a roughly square two-story wood frame structure, with a hip roof and two interior brick chimneys. A series of ells extend to the rear, connecting the main house to a gable-roofed barn with cupola. The main block has a single-story hip-roof porch wrapping around two sides, supported by paneled square posts. The corners of the main block are decorated by pilasters, and a broad entablature encircles the house below the roof line. The first ell is a fairly large two-story structure with Italianate features. The interior of house is stylistically diverse, reflecting the architectural trends also visible in the exterior. Original Greek Revival features are joined by an Italianate arched fireplace mantel, and a Colonial Revival bay window. This house was built in 1846-47 by Joseph Bigelow for his own family. Bigelow (1804–83) had by then already acquired a reputation in the area for is high quality craftsmanship, having built a church in Bloomfield and the Symphony House in Bangor. He is also credited with building one of Skowhegan's other fine Greek Revival houses, the Gov. Abner Coburn House. Bigelow exchanged houses with lumberman Samuel Robinson in 1853, and the house was acquired in 1893 by Edward Page, whose family is responsible for the later Colonial Revival alterations.

In orange: Cleves-Mark wins Soest and the Soest Börde; in grey: Cleves-Mark loses its rights in Fredeburg and Bilstein The Soest Feud (), or Feud of Soest, was a feud that took place from 1444 to 1449 in which the town of Soest claimed its freedom from Archbishop Dietrich of Cologne (1414–1463), who tried to restore his rule. The town of Soest opposed this attempt on 5 June 1444 by accepting a new suzerain, John I, the Duke of Cleves-Mark, who guaranteed the town its old rights as well as new ones. As a result Emperor Frederick III imposed the imperial ban on the town. The victory of the town (as a result of the Archbishop of Cologne abandoning his attempt) meant that Soest had de facto more freedom than a free imperial city until it was annexed by Prussia, but at the same time it had to forfeit its economic power because it was now an enclave within Cologne's territory.

The land was bought by the forerunner of Copenhagen Municipality at the beginning of the 1800s so it could relocate the municipality's psychiatric hospital to a more rural location. With a history beginning in 1620, the hospital now has 180 beds and offers specialized treatment in the areas of forensic psychiatry and dual diagnosis. History The institution was first known as Københavns Pesthus which accommodated mentally ill patients from c. 1620 to 1651 when it moved to Copenhagen Castle's Ladegård in 1651. In 1808, the Copenhagen authorities bought Bistrup Manor in Roskilde for the care of the mentally ill, invalids and the poor. By the 1850s, the number of psychiatric patients had substantially increased, necessitating the establishment of a new treatment centre designed by Gottlieb Bindesbøll which was completed in 1859. The hospital was later expanded in order to function as Copenhagen's psychiatric hospital with some 2,000 beds. In 1987, Roskilde County acquired part of the facilities which it called Roskilde Amtssygehus Fjorden. As of 2014, the Psykiatrisk Center Sct.

On the first day of the Congress, the issue of state symbols was addressed. On 29 March 1920, the symbols were finally approved. The author of the sketches was the Finnish artist Akseli Gallen-Kallela. The coat of arms was a red-green bicolour Varangian shield, topped with traditional headdress loggers. The shield was a picture of a bear in black with a vesuri in their paws. By the bear's feet was a black chain, and above it were white sparks northern lights. The national flag was a black Scandinavian cross with a red border, situated on a green cloth. The colors of the flag symbolize the following: green - a symbol of the country's forest and nature, red - bloodshed for the homeland, and the joy and fire, as in the ancient Karelians used slash-and-burn agriculture, black - the native land and sadness. On the state flag, it had a red canton with white northern lights. The war flag was made in the same style but had three plaits and a complementary Bear with a vesuri in the clutches (there is evidence that in the center of the black cross on it was a red square). There was also a pilot flag (luotsilippu), postal flag (postilippu), a customs flag (tullilippu), and a war pennant, in a similar manner to Finnish Household pennants.Flag of the World: East Karelia (Russia) 1919-1920 The congress decided to secede from Soviet Russia and, guided by the Soviet authorities declared the principle of \\"the right of nations to self- determination\\", they declared independence as the Republic of Uhtua.

A. Prokhorov . - 3rd ed. - M . : Soviet Encyclopfedia, 1969-1978. During the negotiations between the RSFSR and Finland, the Finns promoted territorial claims to Karelia, but due to the Red Army's size, the Finnish government was forced to abandon the idea. As a result, on 14 October 1920, the Treaty of Tartu was signed between the RSFSR and Finland.  The East Karelian Uprising  However, as it turned out, the Government of Finland and Karelian supporters of independence were not going to completely abandon their claims. 10 December 1920 in Vyborg the Karelian united government was created, which, in addition to the Provisional Government of Karelia, became the Olonets government and other national education. In October 1921 in the territory of the Karelian labor commune in Tungudskoy parish was established as the underground Karelian Temporary Committee. In November and December 1921, the Finnish troops reoccupied part of the regions of Karelia, which began the Soviet–Finnish conflict. In Karelia, martial law was imposed, commander of the Karelian Front was appointed commander of A. I. Sedyakin. By early January 1922, the units from Petrozavodsk of the Red Army defeated the main group of Finns, and in early February 1922 the Center Committee Karelian village of Uhtua was re-occupied by the Red Army. As a result of the successes of Soviet troops, Finland was forced to cease hostilities. The Republic of Uhtua ceased to exist.  Gallery  Karelian National Flag.svg|Civil flag.

It first aired on CBS on February 23, 2012. In the episode, Sheldon (Jim Parsons) abandons his methodical approach to life after failing to get a haircut from his usual barber, while Howard (Simon Helberg) has a rough time in his astronaut training. The episode was submitted for Parsons' Emmy nomination, but received mixed reactions from critics. Plot Sheldon goes to get a haircut; his usual barber Mr. D'Onofrio is in a coma, so the barber's nephew Angelo (Peter Onorati) is there instead. Sheldon is uncomfortable with the situation and runs away. Later, he talks to his friends; Penny (Kaley Cuoco) offers to cut his hair while Raj (Kunal Nayyar) and Amy (Mayim Bialik) suggest other barbers. He rejects all of their ideas. Sheldon goes to visit Mr. D'Onofrio in hospital. When the nurse sees him with scissors, expecting to get a haircut, she calls security and he has to leave. He accepts that he is not going to get a haircut, but also abandons all of his meticulous planning (for example, his bowel chart spreadsheet), realizing it has been a waste of time. Early in the morning, Leonard (Johnny Galecki) and Penny wake up to find Sheldon playing a bongo drum, as Richard Feynman played bongos. They try to make him stop but he leaves the apartment, eventually falling asleep on Amy's couch. The next morning, Penny convinces him to let her cut his hair, although she ends up accidentally shaving off part of the back of his hair. Meanwhile, Howard is summoned for astronaut training by NASA. After his first day of training, he talks to Bernadette (Melissa Rauch) via webcam; he vomited while experiencing microgravity. Next, he is forced to go on overnight survival training, where he is spooned by an armadillo during a sandstorm. Bernadette goes to visit Howard in Houston, but finds his mother already there, taking care of him. Production Jim Parsons at PaleyFest in 2013. At the 64th Primetime Emmy Awards, Jim Parsons received a nomination for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series.

However, he lost to Jon Cryer, who played Dr. Alan Harper in Two and a Half Men. Vernee Watson-Johnson, who has appeared on several episodes of the show including the pilot, appeared briefly in the episode as Mr. D'Onofrio's nurse.

Club gave the episode a B+, describing it as \\"relatively strong\\" while claiming there were \\"some imperfections in characterization\\" of Sheldon and that \\"Raj had little more than cameo status\\" in the episode. Harris was \\"actually moved\\" when Bernadette arrived at Howard's hotel room in Houston. R. L. Shaffer of IGN gave \\"The Werewolf Transformation\\" 6.5 out of 10 and described it as a \\"good filler episode\\"; however, the subplot was criticized as viewers never see Howard experiencing hardships in training, and due to the \\"sour end\\" where Howard's mother is revealed to be staying with him in the hotel. Shaffer also suggested that episode would have been a good opportunity for Sheldon to have sex with Amy. Jim Garner of TV Fanatic gave the episode 3.8 out of 5 stars, saying that while it \\"wasn't the most hysterically funny episode of the season, it did explore some fun areas of our favorite geeks\\". However, Garner criticized the Howard subplot, saying that it had been \\"lingering\\" for too long and that \\"we [should] go ahead and shoot Howard in to space and be done with it\\". Robin Pierson of The TV Critic rated the episode 43 out of 100. Pierson had \\"mixed feelings\\" about Howard's storyline, but described Sheldon's plot as \\"tedious\\". When Sheldon abandoned the systematic organization of his life, \\"the episode was half over already\\", so he did not have a chance to \\"question anything seriously\\". Jill Mader from Inside Pulse described the episode as \\"solidly average\\", commenting that Sheldon's reaction was not surprising given his \\"strong signs of Autism Spectrum\\". Howard's subplot was described as \\"pretty funny\\", although Mrs. Wolowitz's appearance was described as an \\"easy joke\\".

It is situated in Tallinn's Old Town. The museum focuses on natural history and nature education, offering its visitors a tour in the wilderness of Estonia. The exhibition space consists of permanent exhibition and temporary showcases.  History  The foundation of the Estonian Museum of Natural History was laid by naturalists of the 19th century. The history of the museum goes back to an earlier museum, that of the Estonian Literary Society which was founded in 1842. This museum was active in exploring the natural sciences, an area that increased in significance at the museum in 1872 when Alexander von der Pahlen (1820–1895) began to contribute to the collection. Pahlen was later elected chairman and under his leadership the collection continued to grow. It soon became apparent that a separate museum for natural history was needed. The collection was kept and displayed in a temporary building until 1911 when a building was purchased in Kohtu Street in Tallinn. The new Provincial Museum exhibited the art and natural sciences collection of the entire province of Harjumaa. The collection was under threat of damage during the First World War so it was moved to Russia for safe keeping and returned when the war ended. The Provincial Museum continued to operate under the Arts and Heritage Department of the Minister of Education and Research but changed its name back to The Estonian Literary Society in 1926. After the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, Baltic-German institutions, including the Estonian Literary Society, were closed. In 1940, through the Regulation of the Council of People’s Commissars of the Estonian SSR, the Soviet authorities nationalized all museums allowing for a National Museum of Natural History to be established in Tallinn on January 1, 1941 .  Collection  The collections of the Estonian Museum of Natural History contain nearly 300 000 museum specimens. Approximately 90% of the plant, beetle, butterfly and moth, bird and mammal species found in Estonia are represented in the collections. A highly valuable part of the collections is made up by type specimens – the specimens used to provide the first description of a new taxon and serving as a definitive example of that taxon.  Botanical  The principal botanical collection contains approximately 108,000 plant specimens. The vascular plant herbarium includes 79,000 specimens, of which 77,000 are leaves, and the rest fruits, seeds, and strobili. Most of the material was collected in Estonia, and the collection contains specimens of a predominant part of the domestic flora - 1,600 taxa.  Mycological collections  The mycological herbarium includes approximately 2,450 plant specimens. The unlichenized fungi collection contains 250 samples. Of the more than 2,200 specimens included in the lichen i.e. lichenized fungi collection, approximately 1,600 were collected in Estonia and 600 from abroad (mainly Scandinavia and other parts of Europe).  Zoological  The zoological collections of the Museum of Natural History contain approximately 130,000 specimens. The collections boast a wide selection of both vertebrate and invertebrate species from Estonia as well as other parts of the world. The zoological collections include: * The ornithological collections * The mammal collection * The species-rich collection of mollusk shells, corals, and echinoderms * The wet specimen collection * The entomological collections  Geological  The geological collection of the Museum of Natural History holds approximately 3,500 samples. Nearly three fourths of the specimens constitute paleontological material, the oldest specimens of which were collected in the mid-19th century. The dominant part of the paleontological collection is formed by Paleozoic fossils found in the Estonian bedrock. The most numerous samples among the preserved material include fossils of marine invertebrates from the Ordovician and Silurian Periods. The paleontological collections furthermore contain bone fractions and skeletal fragments of mammals of the Quaternary Period, most of which originate from Russia’s northern territories. Lithological collections hold typical sedimentary rocks of the Estonian bedrock: limestone, marl, sandstone, and mudstone. Petrological collections are small, with the main specimens being Estonian glacial erratic samples and samples of metamorphic rocks and igneous rocks collected from the territory of the former Soviet Union. The number of the Museum’s mineralogical specimens has increased significantly during the last decade, owing to domestic and foreign donations. While minerals inserted into the collections in previous years mostly come from Russia, Eastern Europe, and Germany, the contemporary collection includes minerals from Australia, South America, and Africa. Some of the most notable mineralogical samples include large quartz, amethyst, and fluoride druses.  History of science collection  The history of science collection with approximately 1 050 specimens comprises archival materials and historical items pertaining to the study and mediation of nature.  Photo collection  The photo collection contains photos, negatives and colour slides, 28 000 specimens in total, reflecting the daily life, exhibitions, field work and events of the museum throughout time. The photo collection of the museum has been digitised in the biodiversity information system PlutoF under the acronym TAMF.

He holds a degree in political sociology and International Relations from the International Studies Association in Tunis.  Early life  Mohsen Marzouk was born in July 1965 and raised in a poor working-class neighborhood in the city of Sfax. At fourteen, he was expelled from school for his oppositional political activities. He managed to re-enter and finish high school in Sfax. At the University of Tunis, Marzouk was a leading student activist. In 1987, while still enrolled, he was arrested by Tunisia's secret police. He was interrogated and tortured for many days before being sent to a labor camp in the southern desert. When he was allowed to return, Marzouk remained politically active. He worked towards reinstating the General Union of Tunisian Students (UGET) which after Ben Ali's rise to power became deeply divided over its further political course. Marzouk was appointed to the UGET's executive bureau while at the same time, he was conspiratively active for the outlawed leftist movement El Amal Ettounsi.  Career  From 1989 on, he worked as a coordinator for the newly founded Arab Institute for Human Rights. Since 2008 he has been secretary-general of the non-governmental Arab Democracy Foundation and member of the International Steering Committee of the Community of Democracies. Marzouk is one of the founders of Nidaa Tounes and was member of the party's Executive Committee. As Beji Caid Essebsi's campaign manager in the 2014 presidential election he announced Essebsi's victory in the runoff vote on 21 December, stating that Tunisians were now turning the page of the transitional phase and that Tunisia was now a stable democracy. Marzouk’s faction within Nidaa Tounes supported a more assertive, secularist government. Marzouk left the party in early January 2016 and later became part of Machrouu Tounes.

She fought in World War I and later in the Russian Civil War on the side of the anti-communist White movement. Wounded several times, she won the Russian Cross of Saint George for bravery three times. She eventually made her way to Vladivostok, then to Japan and finally to the USA, where she performed as a dancer. Yurlova published her autobiography in three parts: Cossack Girl (1934), Russia Farewell (1936) and The Only Woman (1937). Biography Marina Yurlova during World War I She was born in Raevskaya, a small village near Krasnodar. The daughter of a colonel of the Kuban Cossacks, she was just 14 years old when her father went to war in August 1914. Caught up in the adventure and tradition of Cossack women following their men to the front, she became a child soldier in the Russian army at age 14. Specifically, she joined the Reconnaissance Sotnia (100 horse squadron) of the 3rd Ekaterinodar Regiment. Yurlova originally worked as a groom in Armenia; She was mentored and protected by a sergeant in the army of the Causcasus named Kosel, who procured a uniform for Marina and made her a sort of mascot for his unit. In 1915, she was on a dangerous mission in which Kosel was killed, and she was shot in the leg while blasting bridges across the Araxes River near Yerevan. She was treated at the Red Cross hospital in Baku and then returned to the Eastern Front, where she trained as an auto mechanic and became a military driver. In 1917, she was wounded, and spent nearly the entire year 1918 in a hospital in Moscow, suffering from concussion and shell shock - the result of an explosion. After her release, she again joined the Russian forces under the command of Captain Vladimir Kappel, and was shot through the shoulder by Bolsheviks while on patrol. According to her autobiography, she was wrongly sent to an asylum in Omsk for a period of about three weeks as she recovered from this wound and from shell shock. Due to the intervention of a friendly officer, she was released and given passage and 500 rubles to travel to the American hospital in Vladivostok. The train she was a passenger on was stopped in the middle of the Siberian wasteland, sandwiched between two Bolshevik armies. Led by a contingent of Russian officers, along with party of about 100 Royalists (both men and women) she walked through Siberia for a month, eventually reaching the American hospital in Vladivostok. The American hospital, Marina said, \\"was quite perfectly run, quite perfectly kind\\", and after recuperating there for three weeks, she was given passport and passage to Sulphur Springs, Japan. In 1922, she emigrated to the United States, where she performed as a dancer. She married filmmaker William C. Hyer and became a U.S. citizen in 1926. In 1984, she died at the age of 84 years.  Autobiography  Yurlova published an autobiographical trilogy. The first in the series, Cossack Girl (1934), covered her life from age 14 through five years of war and societal collapse. The second, Russia, Farewell (1936), was published by Michael Joseph LTD., 14 Henrietta Street, W.C.2, printed by Mayflower Press, Plymouth, England, following a court case in which Yurlova sued Liberty Press in the US for libel. The book covers the time until her emigration to the U.S. in 1922. Her third book, The Only Woman (1937), was published in the US by Macauly in 1938. It picks up the story of her life in the U.S. Cossack Girl leaped back into print in paperback upon the centennial of The Great War, with broadcast of 14 - Diaries of the Great War, however there is little chance the second and third books will be republished. Russia, Farewell copies are rare, editions of The Only Woman even more so. In popular culture Yurlova is one of those whose wartime experiences are described in Women Heroes of World War I: 16 Remarkable Resisters, Soldiers, Spies, and Medics by Kathryn J. Atwood in the Chicago Review Press. She is one of the 14 main characters of the 2014 documentary drama series 14 - Diaries of the Great War where she is played by actress Natalia Witmer.

Bedfordshire Clinical Commissioning Group was said to be in the most difficult financial position of any in England in 2014. It was supposed to produce a £4.6m surplus at the end of 2014/15 but now expects to run up a ‘very serious and disturbing’ £25m deficit. Accountable Officer Dr Paul Hassan said “Much of our overspend has been on caring for patients at our local acute hospitals, but we have also seen a large rise in costs for providing mental healthcare and continuing healthcare for people in the community.\\" By March 2015 the deficit for the year was predicted to be “up to £40m”. Contributing factors were said to be a difficult winter, increased hospital activity and a high number of expensive out of area placements for mental health service users. It restated its accounts in June 2015 to record a £12.7m deficit for 2013-14 and £30.5m for 2014-15, resulting in a £43.2m cumulative deficit. It has had an increase in funding of £30 million per year. History From 1947 to 1965 NHS services in Bedfordshire were managed by the North-West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board. In 1974 the Boards were abolished and replaced by regional health authorities. Bedfordshire came under the North West Thames RHA. Regions were reorganised in 1996 and Bedfordshire came under the Anglia and Oxford Regional Health Authority. Bedfordshire had an Area Health Authority from 1974 until 1982 when it was divided into two district health authorities: North and South. in 1993 these were reunited. Regional health authorities were reorganised and renamed strategic health authorities in 2002. Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire was under Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire SHA. In 2006 regions were again reorganised and Bedfordshire came under NHS East of England until that was abolished in 2013. There were two primary care trusts for the area: Luton and Bedfordshire. Sustainability and transformation plans Milton Keynes, Bedfordshire and Luton formed a sustainability and transformation plan area in March 2016 with Pauline Philip, the Chief Executive of Luton and Dunstable University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, as its leader The three CCGs plan share a single clinical commissioning group chief officer and plan to set up a “fully operational” integrated care system but it is to continue in shadow form until 2019. In June 2018 the leaders of Milton Keynes, Luton and Bedford councils threatened to quit the partnership, saying it could not legitimately claim to be working towards an integrated system. The partnership is now led by Richard Carr who is also chief executive of Central Bedfordshire Council, also in the STP, which did not sign the letter. In January 2019 Luton Borough Council pulled out of what is now called an integrated care system, although it said it had close working relationships with Luton Clinical Commissioning Group and that this would continue. Commissioning NHS England appointed Nick Robinson, an accountant, as interim accountable officer for Bedfordshire CCG, in March, breaching its own guidance about clinical leadership, although there are two interim assistant clinical deputy chairs. In June 2017 Milton Keynes CCG was reported to be considering rationing the supply of hearing aids to one per person, and none for people with mild hearing loss. Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust, which runs community services in the area, complained that these proposals were “incredibly damaging”, contrary to national policy, robust evidence, and professional opinion...\\" In October 2017 plans were announced to deny surgery to smokers and obese people indefinitely unless the patients stopped smoking or lost substantial amounts of weight. Ian Eardley of the Royal College of Surgeons said, \\"This goes against clinical guidance and leaves patients waiting long periods of time in pain and discomfort. It can even lead to worse outcomes following surgery in some cases.\\"Hertfordshire NHS breath tests for smokers before surgery BBC Luton Borough Council agreed to establish a health commissioning budget jointly with its CCG starting in 2018. Primary and community care There are 55 GP practices in Bedfordshire CCG and 31 in Luton CCG. Out-of-hours services are provided by Bedford On Call Palliative care is provided by Keech Cottage, the Sue Ryder St John’s Hospice in Moggerhanger, Bedford Daycare Hospice and Willen Hospice in Milton Keynes. In November 2017 East London NHS Foundation Trust won a £195 million five year contract to provide community health services in the county. Acute care The main providers of NHS acute hospital care in the county are Bedford Hospital NHS Trust, and Luton and Dunstable University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. Circle Health Ltd have a contract in the county for management of musculoskeletal care, which started in 2014. They have reduced the proportion of patients going on to secondary care by 24%. Bedford Hospital NHS Trust staff complain that patients are diverted to the nearby private hospital, that there are delays in referrals and that the trauma service which they provide is financially unsustainable without the flow of elective work. Some of these problems, they say, would be alleviated if there was an integrated information system. Mental health NHS mental health services are provided by East London NHS Foundation Trust. South Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust provided mental health services in the county until 1 April 2015. HealthWatch Healthwatch is an organisation set up under the Health and Social Care Act 2012 to act as a voice for patients. There are three separate local Healthwatche groups in the county covering Bedford Borough, Central Bedfordshire and Luton.

Aerial view of the area around Paulsplatz, including St Paul's Church. Paulsplatz (in English: St Paul's Square) is a historic square in the heart of Frankfurt, Germany. St Paul's Church is located here, dominating the square. The Römerberg, another square, is to the south. Berliner Strasse is immediately to the north. Paulsplatz is a major location for the outdoor Frankfurt Christmas Market. Overview Paulsplatz is the largest square in the old town of Frankfurt am Main. To the north is Berlin Street, east is the new Kräme (built 1900–08), to the northwest is the Old Town Hall and to the south are Bethmannstraße and Braubachstraße .Since the devastation of World War II in 1944, the square is connected with the Römerberg square to the south. Dominating Paulsplatz is the classical-style St Paul's Church (1789–1833), the meeting place of the Frankfurt National Assembly of 1848. The square is a pedestrian zone. The eastern part has plane trees and a number of cafés with outdoor tables during summer months. There are various street festivals that take place in the square during the summer, as well as the Frankfurt Christmas Market in late November and December. History Until the 18th century, the first recorded Frankfurt Franciscan monastery was located on the site of today's square, from 1270. From 1526 there were regular sermons in the Barfüßerkirche. In 1529, the last eight Franciscans left the monastery. The monastery was handed over to the city council. The Barfüßerkirche became the main Protestant church of Frankfurt. Important theologians such as Philipp Jakob Spener and Johann Friedrich Starck and musicians such as Georg Philipp Telemann attended. The monastic buildings north of the church became a school from 1542. Map of the area around Paulsplatz in 1861. In the 18th century, the building became too small and dilapidated. In 1782, the Barfüßerkirche was closed and it was demolished in 1786. In 1789, construction of a new church began under municipal architect Johann Georg Christian Hess. Because of delays due to war, construction continued until 1833. Historical view of St Paul's Church in Paulsplatz. The construction of the Gothic Barfüßerkirche was oriented in an east–west direction. The new church was an oval building with an offset tower to the south, which also formed the main entrance. The square was connected to the west and east by two narrow lanes following the main north–south axis of the old town. To the west, east, and north of St Paul's Church, the building was surrounded by a dense development. In 1838, the school and medieval monastery buildings were demolished. In their place, a block was built between Neue Kräme and St Paul's Church, located on the northern side. During 1840–1952, this was the Old Stock Exchange. The Old Exchange The Old Exchange (Alte Börse) in 1845. The most significant building in the square while extant, the Old Exchange (Alte Börse), next to the church, was built from 1840 to 1843 by Jakob Friedrich Peiper (1805–1878), following to the plans of the Berlin architect Friedrich August Stüler. The Old Stock Exchange was used for the emerging securities trading market in Frankfurt. The late- classical building was a two-story cube of red and white sandstone. The Old Stock Exchange was also the location of the Frankfurt telegraph offices. In 1879, the Frankfurt Chamber of Commerce supported the Stock Exchange, a new building that still called New Market in the New Town. The Old Stock Exchange was the hall that GmbH adopted and used as a meeting place. In 1944 during World War II, heavy bombing of the city caused the building to be burned down. The remaining outer walls were demolished in 1952. The Unity Memorial The Unity Monument (Einheitsdenkmal) in 1907, with St Paul's Church to the left and the Old Exchange (now demolished) to the right. On the square in front of St Paul's Church since 1903 is the Unity Monument (Einheitsdenkmal). In 1898, the city of Frankfurt launched a contest for the monument. The Commission appointed by the city council selected the design of the architect Fritz Hessemer and the sculptor Hugo Kaufmann. On top of a four-stage base of travertine stone is a three-sided obelisk made of the same material, crowned by an allegorical bronze figure. On pedestals around the base there were three pairs of figure in bronze. The first group, representing the free bourgeoisie and the struggle for freedom, showed a young fighter at a weary older fighter's feet. The next group consisted of an allegorical alma mater, which satisfies the thirst for knowledge of a young man by giving him a drink from a cup. The third group, the song of freedom, presented two men, the elder with a lyre and a youth with a sword, a representation allowing the role of music to be appreciated. The groups of figures were destroyed in 1940 when the metal was melted for the war effort during WWII. Between the pedestals are three relief panels. The first is the exodus of the fraternity and irregulars for the liberation of Schleswig-Holstein. On the second, a youth of a family says farewell. Among the group are the words of Ernst Moritz Arndt: \\"We are beaten, not defeated. In such a battle you cannot succumb!\\" The third relief shows a group of men at a sword forge, one of which bears the features of Bismarck. It remained unclear who the allegory represents on the top of the obelisk. Contemporary reviewers describe the female figure, with the words \\"Stand Together\\", as Clio, the muse of epic poetry, but also as Germania. On 18 October 1903, the 90th anniversary of the Battle of Leipzig, the monument was inaugurated by the Mayor, Franz Adickes. References Sources * German page, Wikipedia.

Haywood is an American politician from Pennsylvania currently serving as a Democratic member of the Pennsylvania State Senator for the 4th district. Prior to being elected to the State Senate in the 2014 election, Haywood practiced law and served as a commissioner in Cheltenham Township, Pennsylvania.  Biography  State Senator Art Haywood represents the fourth senate district in Pennsylvania which covers Chestnut Hill, Mt. Airy, Germantown, West Oak Lane, Cheltenham, Springfield, Jenkintown, Rockledge and Abington neighborhoods. In the Capitol, since 2015, he has been leading legislation to increase retirement savings with a state management auto-IRA and increasing the use of clean energy by electric companies to 30% by 2030. He is a leading advocate for raising the minimum wage, negotiating and successfully advocating for increased wages for CVS employees in 2018. He has also been a leading advocate for gun violence prevention since 2015, hosting the first Gun Violence Awareness Day in the Capitol and serving as a current member of Moms Demand Action. In 2018, he led the passage of SB919 which provides emergency transfers to survivors of domestic and sexual violence who live in public housing, and a change to the PA School Code to require lead testing of water in public schools statewide or a public hearing. Most recently, he worked with the Department of Aging to save taxpayers $2.4 million for the prescription drug program PACE over two years. He initiated a Mentoring Collaborative with the Urban Affairs Coalition to expand mentoring organizations with youth and brought more than $18 million in state grants for employment and neighborhood improvement. In the 4th District, Art and his staff have served more than 8,000 neighbors through constituent services and outreach events. Art Haywood was raised by his mother, an educator who instilled within him hard work and the value of an education.

His legal career has concentrated on preserving and creating affordable housing and neighborhood revitalization. Art has three adult children and resides in Wyncote with his wife Julie of 29 years.  Political views   Public education  According to the state Senator's campaign website, \\"low levels of state funding puts a greater burden on local taxes.\\"  Minimum wage  Haywood argued that \\"everyone who's able to work, should work, and receive a decent wage for that work. Without proper wages, parents are less able to provide for their children. Raising wages not only benefits families, businesses also benefit from greater consumer spending.\\" Poverty pay must be ended in the Commonwealth. Every hardworking individual deserves a living wage and Senator Haywood has been fighting since his time in the state legislature to raise the minimum wage in PA.  Gun laws  Also during the 2014 campaign, based upon the number of gun-related deaths in Pennsylvania from 2001 to 2010, he proposed \\"restricting access to guns. \\"  References   External links  *Art Haywood for State Senate campaign website * http://www.senatorhaywood.com/ Category:African-American state legislators in Pennsylvania Category:Living people Category:People from Montgomery County, Pennsylvania Category:People from Cheltenham, Pennsylvania Category:Marshall Scholars Category:University of Michigan Law School alumni Category:21st-century American politicians Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Wikipedia requested images of people Category:Wikipedia requested images of politicians of the United States Category:Wikipedia requested images of politicians and government-people ","title":"Arthur L.

More than 100 people were killed. Seventy-two of them were identified; the majority were Bengali Hindus, the rest Muslims, mostly supporters of the Bangladesh Awami League and sovereign Bangladesh. In 1992, a memorial was constructed with a marble plaque containing the names of the 72 victims and six other victims killed elsewhere.  Background  In 1969, Patuakhali district was carved out of the erstwhile Bakerganj district. The Patuakhali district consisted of the Patuakhali Sadar and Barguna sub- division. On 25 April 1971, the Pakistan Armed Forces launched Operation Barisal to capture Barisal. On 26 April, they occupied the Patuakhali district town. Major Raja Nadir Pervez Khan of the 6 Punjab Regiment was appointed as the Martial Law Administrator of Patuakhali district. On 14 May, the Pakistan Armed Forces arrived at Barguna in a gunboat and took control of the town. On 15 May, they took captive some residents of Patharghata and brought them to Barguna. Some of the captives were killed on the banks of Bishkhali the rest were imprisoned in the Barguna sub-divisional jail. Lakshman Das, a noted Bengali Hindu businessman from Patharghata and his three sons were among the imprisoned. The Pakistan Armed Forces then left for Patuakhali. After the Pakistan Armed Forces left Barguna, the Peace Committee members announced that the Hindus can come back to town. None of them except the caste Hindus would be killed. After getting the assurance from the Peace Committee, many Bengali Hindus returned to their homes in Barguna. Service holders joined their office, others opened their shops.  Killings  Major Nadir Pervez (left) On 26 May, a contingent of five soldiers led by Captain Shafayet secretly arrived from Patuakhali in a speedboat. From the morning of 27 May, the Pakistani soldiers and their local collaborators raided the Barguna town. It was raining incessantly from the morning and most of the residents stayed indoors. Being unaware of the raid they did not get a chance to flee the town. The raiders targeted the Hindu localities of Amtala, Karmakarpatti and Nathpatti. By the evening they arrested around 500 – 600 residents, tied them with ropes and took them to the Barguna sub-divisional jail. The captive men and women were segregated in separate male and female wards. According to eyewitness accounts there were around 150 female captives. The Pakistani soldiers used to pick up women according to their choice. If anybody refused, she was kicked or beaten up with the rifle butts or sometimes shot dead. The women were then taken to an adjacent empty ward, where they were gang-raped by the soldiers throughout the night. Some women were sent to the C & B bungalow where the Pakistan Armed Forces and the Peace Committee members set up their temporary camp. In the morning, the women were returned to the female ward of the prison. Some of the women were draped with red sarees to hide the blood stains resulting from rapes. On 28 May, Major Nadir Pervez arrived in Barguna. On 29 May, Major Pervez constituted a tribunal within the Barguna sub-divisional jail for the trial of the inmates and left for Patuakhali. The tribunal sentenced the Bengali Hindus and the Muslims who supported the idea of sovereign Bangladesh to death after a brief trial. When the first bell rang in the Barguna Zilla School adjacent to the jail, the Pakistani soldiers fired at their targets. Lakshman Das and his son Arun Das were killed in the massacre. Dr. Krishna Das, a popular doctor of Barguna did not die immediately after being shot. He tried to escape by crawling across the WAPDA road, when his head was smashed by a spade. After the killings, Peace Committee members buried the dead in the south western region of the jail compound. According to eyewitness accounts many women were denied the right to cremate their husbands. According to Dr. M. A. Hasan, the Convener of War Crimes Facts Finding Committee, 55 persons were killed on the first day and 36 people were killed on the next day. In other accounts the death toll is mentioned in hundreds.  Aftermath  Many of the survivors were taken to Patuakhali and killed. Later on many people were killed in the prison compound during the course of the Bangladesh Liberation War. According to Dr. M.A.Hasan thousands of innocent people were killed by the Pakistan Armed Forces in the Patharghata, Amtali, Betagi and Bamni areas of the sub-division. However, no authentic data is available on the total numbers of deaths in the then Barguna sub-division or present day Barguna District. The victims of the massacre has been officially recognised as martyrs of the Liberation War by the Bangladesh government.

Early life Ellis was the son of the mathematician and philologist Alexander John Ellis. He and his twin sister, Miriam Anne, were born at Great Malvern on 2 July 1844. He was known to his family as Tristie and spent his early years in Bath, Clifton and Edinburgh, after which he was sent to school at Queenwood College in Hampshire. At school, he excelled in mathematics, and while he did study drawing, he disliked the emphasis placed on copying rather than original art. In 1862, Ellis went to King's College, London, where during his second year he earned the highest distinction in the Applied Sciences department in the college's history. He won all the scholarships offered by the college and was awarded the Associateship of King's College after only two years' study, in recognition of his exceptional achievements. After university, Ellis completed a pupilage under the railway engineer Sir John Fowler and became a partner in a firm of engineers. After several years, Ellis decided that his calling lay in art. As he had sufficient means to support himself, he abandoned engineering and devoted his time to oil painting. Artistic career Several of Ellis's early oil paintings were shown at the Royal Academy. Despite this, he felt his technique needed improvement and moved to Paris to become a student of Léon Bonnat, practicing 12 hours a day. Ellis was one of 170 students from 43 countries in Bonnat's studio at the time, but seems to have developed a friendship with his teacher, who advised him to focus on history painting. Ellis, however, was too interested in the outdoors to accept Bonnat's suggestion. After his studies in Paris, Ellis began to travel to sketch foreign scenes. In 1878, he spent six months in Cyprus, then under British occupation, where he contracted a fever. Despite this he returned with 50–60 watercolor sketches that were all sold to a dealer after their exhibition in Bond Street in April 1879. This success encouraged him to plan a more ambitious trip, and so on 1 October 1879 he boarded a steamship for Alexandria with the aim of visiting Syria, Asia Minor and Mesopotamia. Ellis succeeded in traveling from the Syrian coast, overland to Diyarbakır in southeast Turkey and then by raft down the Tigris to Mosul and Baghdad in Iraq. From Baghdad, Ellis traveled overland to Palmyra and Damascus in Syria and then to Beirut, Lebanon. After his return, he showed about 90 sketches from his travels, and sold them immediately. Ellis also wrote a two- volume illustrated account of his trip, \\"On a Raft, and Through the Desert\\", which was published in 1881. Ellis's next trip was to Egypt in the spring of 1882. He spent three weeks at the Pyramids, where he stayed with the Egyptologist Flinders Petrie, and left the country in May, just before the massacre at Alexandria on 11 June 1882 that precipitated the Anglo-Egyptian War. Several years later, Ellis made another trip to the eastern Mediterranean, where he spent time in Athens, and had three sketches selected by George I of Greece. After this, Ellis made three visits to the Arctic, including to Spitzbergen, and also returned to the Mediterranean. In 1896, Ellis was married and living comfortably in London.

Farooq Abdullah was reappointed as the Chief Minister.Statistical Report on the General Election, 1987, Election Commission of India, New Delhi. The election is widely perceived to have been rigged. The rigging of the election is believed to have led to the insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir After the following elections to the Parliament in 1989, which saw low turn-out, Governor's Rule was declared in Jammu and Kashmir in 1990, which lasted till 1996. The 1987 election in a way was a watershed in the politics of the Jammu and Kashmir state.Question of Simple Majority Greater Kashmir; 7 July 2014. Background The background of the 1987 election is fraught with multiple complexities. During the long years of imprisonment of Sheikh Abdullah, his loyalists split off from the National Conference party and formed a Plebiscite Front. The remaining members of the National Conference merged their party with the Indian National Congress. After Abdullah's release and his accord with Indira Gandhi, the Congress party accepted him as its own Head and elected him as the State's Chief Minister. However, during the 1977 election, Abdullah shunned the Congress party and revived a new National Conference party from the erstwhile Plebiscite Front. He won the election handsomely. After Sheikh Abdullah's death, the Congress party again sought an alliance with the National Conference for the 1983 election. It was again shunned and the new leader Farooq Abdullah won the election independently. Congress however emerged as the de facto party of the Jammu region. Congress exploited the internal squabbles in the National Conference and teamed up with Farooq's brother-in-law G. M. Shah to topple Farooq's government. This led to a period of instability during which the Governor's Rule was imposed. After Rajiv Gandhi became the leader of the Indian National Congress, another accord was reached with Farooq Abdullah. The Governor's Rule was lifted and Farooq returned to power in 1986, but with the understanding that Congress and the National Conference would form an alliance for the 1987 election. In the view of scholar Sten Widmalm, the State's two largest parties had formed an 'election cartel' so that discontent could not be channeled. Before the election, various anti-establishment groups including Jamaat-e-Islami joined hands to form a Muslim United Front (MUF) mainly pointing out that the NC had capitulated before the Centre for the sake of power and bartered away the special status of the State. Efforts were made to arouse Muslim sentiments along communal lines. MUF's election manifesto stressed the need for a solution to all outstanding issues according to Simla Agreement, work for Islamic unity and against political interference from the centre. Their slogan was wanting the law of the Quran in the Assembly. The NC-Congress(I) combine contested all the 76 seats and the MUF, 43 seats. Voting The election were held on 23 March 1987. Nearly 75 percent of the voters participated, highest recorded participation in the state. Nearly eighty per cent of the people in the Valley voted. Elections for Bhadrawah, Leh and Kargil were held in June 1987.A Survey of Elections in Kashmir, Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies, 10 April 2002 Results The NC-Congress alliance won 66 seats in the Assembly: NC winning 40 seats of the 45 it contested, and Congress winning 26 out of 31 (5 out of 6 contested seats in the Valley). The alliance received only 53% of the popular vote but garnered 87% of the seats. The BJP won 2 seats, in Jammu. The MUF expected to win 10 seats out of the 44 seats it contested. But it won only 4 seats, even though it had polled 31% votes. Syed Ali Shah Geelani of Jamaat-e-Islami (a constituent of MUF) won from Sopore. The disparity between the popular vote and the seat wins was very high. (In comparison, in 1983, the NC and Congress polled 78% of the vote to achieve 95% of the seats.) Scholar Sten Widmalm explains the increased disparity as an effect of forming an \\"election cartel\\" (between the NC and Congress), which had a dominant effect in the first-past-the-post election system used in India. The cartel's victory seemed unfair to many Jammu and Kashmir voters, which was magnified when allegations of fraud came to surface.; : \\"The unusually poor correlation between votes and seats may possibly have planted unfounded suspicion in the minds of those who were unaware of the peculiarities of the majority election system with single-member constituencies.\\" The MUF's garnering of the 31% of the vote in its first electoral contest has been described as a 'huge' success. Journalist Balraj Puri states that the MUF emerged as the main alternative to the NC-Congress alliance in all parts of the Valley, except the four constituencies of the Kupwara district where People's Conference came in the second place. The People's Conference did not win a seat despite having been expected to do well in the constituencies of Bandipora, Sangrama, Handwara, and Kupwara. They still managed to capture 93,949 votes. Electoral malpractice The India Today reported that ″starting about two weeks before the election, 600 opposition workers were arrested in areas where the MUF, independents, and PC [People's Conference] candidates were showing strength″. In the Amira Kadal constituency of Srinagar, MUF's Syed Mohammed Yusuf Shah was a candidate. As the vote counting began, it was becoming clear that Yusuf Shah was winning by a landslide. His opponent, Ghulam Mohiuddin Shah, went home dejected. But he was summoned back by the electoral officials and declared the winner. When the crowds protested, the police arrived and arrested Yusuf Shah and his supporters. They were held in custody till the end of 1987. Leader of the People's Conference party, Abdul Ghani Lone, complained that vote counting in the constituency of Handwara was tampered with by the deputy inspector-general of police, A.M. Watali. There were several cases like this with other candidates but the petitions to the courts did not lead to any action. There was no response from the central government, courts or the election commission to the demands that the allegations of rigging be investigated. Kashmir's High Court chose not to probe the allegations and the Election Commission was inactive at the time. Balraj Puri has noted three constituencies where the MUF lost narrowly: Bijbehara, Wachi and Shopian. The number of rejected votes in these constituencies was far higher than the margin of victory for the alliance, indicating that the vote counting could have been easily manipulated. Whereas it took only three hours to count the votes in Farooq Abdullah's seat, the vote counting in seats where the MUF had influence took considerably longer. In Anantnag it was reported that the results were delayed for two and half days while the polling station was surrounded by hundreds of policemen. In Bijbehara the polling officers refused to count when they found that a MUF candidate had taken an early lead. In Doru, an NC candidate with a lead of 300 votes was declared the winner even though more than a thousand votes remained to be counted. Counting in the Pulwama constituency took no account of the strategic Tahab belt. Counting in Shopian and Sopore went on for three days until MUF candidates were declared the losers. BBC reported that Khem Lata Wukhloo, who was a leader of the Congress party at the time, admitted the widespread rigging in Kashmir. He stated: > \\"I remember that there was a massive rigging in 1987 elections. The losing > candidates were declared winners. It shook the ordinary people's faith in > the elections and the democratic process.\\" Governor Jagmohan is reported to have been appalled at what was being done, but he said that he was ordered by the central government in Delhi not to interfere. Many see this rigged election as a cause of militancy in Kashmir. Abdul Ghani Lone became a separatist leader after the 1987 election and stated that many young people, out of frustration with the democratic process, decided to go for an armed struggle. Extent of electoral malpractice The extent of election malpractice has been debated by scholars and analysts.: \\"The exact extent of rigging is still difficult to assess, but qualified estimates have been made.\\": \\"But to suggest that every constituency in Kashmir was corrupt in equal measure would be an overstatement.\\" Scholar Victoria Schofield has stated that the MUF might have won four more seats if there was no electoral fraud. On the other hand, an anonymous source in the Intelligence Bureau has advanced the estimate that the MUF may have lost approximately 13 seats due to electoral malpractice. Other journalists and commentators have estimated a loss of fifteen to twenty seats.Praveen Donthi, How Mufti Mohammad Sayeed Shaped The 1987 Elections In Kashmir, The Caravan, 23 March 2016. Farooq Abdullah conceded that the opposition parties might have been able to win 20 seats instead of 10 in the absence of rigging. He denied his own involvement in rigging.: \\"Farooq Abdullah virtually admitted that these elections were rigged, though he denies that he rigged them or that the Congress-Conference coalition would have lost had they not been rigged. He did concede that the MUF might have won twnety seats instead of ten if the elections had been held more fairly.\\" Former Kashmir civil servant Wajahat Habibullah states that clear indications of malpractice were found in ten constituencies. These constituencies were mainly in Srinagar and all of them were counted as wins of the National Conference.: \\"Clear indications of malpractice in the 1987 election had been found in only ten constituencies, primarily in Srinagar, where the support base of the NC had been tenuous. Moreover, such evidence appeared only in those constituencies that were won by the National Conference.\\" He believes that Farooq Abdullah allowed them to be rigged in order to gain a majority for the National Conference in the Assembly, so that it would not be dependent on support from the Indian National Congress. He also notes that the methods of rigging appeared \\"blatant\\" and lacked the finesse of the pre-1977 elections. Aftermath Farooq Abdullah was elected Chief Minister and formed a coalition government. However, the Government lacked legitimacy in the eyes of the people in the Valley. Rebels branded the election as a \\"thoroughly made one\\". The Valley sank into a \\"morass of frustration and radicalisation\\", states scholar Sumantra Bose. In June 1988, there were protests against a hike in the electricity tariffs, resulting in police firings. In July, the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front launched its first bomb attack in Srinagar. A cycle of violence and protests took hold, steadily rising in tempo. In January 1990, the Farooq Abdullah government was dismissed and Governor's Rule was declared.

Upon the outbreak of the Civil War, Ankeny raised eight companies of volunteers before fighting with the 46th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment. Twice wounded, Ankeny was lauded by his superiors for his topographical maps of battlegrounds and was brevetted a brigadier general. After the war, Ankeny returned to Freeport before purchasing a large farm north of Des Moines, Iowa. Biography Rollin Valentine Ankeny was born in Somerset, Pennsylvania, on May 22, 1830. Shortly after his birth, his parents moved the family to Millersburg, Ohio. Ankeny grew up on the family farm and also worked in his father's store. He attended public schools, then moved to Freeport, Illinois in 1854. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Ankeny helped to raise Company A of the 11th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment and transferred it to Smith D. Atkins. Ankeny then helped to raise seven companies of troops for the next call for volunteers. Ankeny was named first lieutenant of Company B, 46th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment. He fought with the regiment, was wounded at the Battle of Fort Donelson and the Battle of Shiloh. He was named captain of Company B in 1863. His superiors utilized his skills in drawing topographical maps of battlegrounds. When the 142nd Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment was raised in June 1864, Ankeny was named its colonel. When the war ended, Ankeny was brevetted a brigadier general. After the war, Ankeny returned to Freeport and continued to farm until 1868. He then moved to Des Moines, Iowa, where he purchased a plot of land north of the city. He moved to Winterset, Iowa after the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad connected to the city and traded in lumber. While there, he was named a deputy United States Marshal. He returned to Des Moines in 1882 but was forced to retire soon after following an injury sustained in a train wreck. After a failed enterprise in the Black Hills of South Dakota, he took a job with the United States Department of the Interior. He retired and returned to Des Moines. Ankeny married Sarah Irvine on August 9, 1851. They had four children: Irvina, Harriet, Rollin, and Mary. Ankeny was a Mason—a member of the Des Moines Commandery—and attended the Christian Church.

The 1983 election established the model for any future Congress-NC alliance - the Congress allotting itself seats mainly in the Jammu and Ladakh regions, while the National Conference limiting itself to the Kashmir Valley.

Jammu & Kashmir National Conference, newly revived from the former Plebiscite Front, won an overwhelming majority and re- elected Sheikh Abdullah as the Chief Minister.Statistical report J&K; 1977 Background After reaching the 1974 Indira-Sheikh accord, Sheikh Abdullah was elected as the Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir by the ruling Indian National Congress party in the state legislature (which had in fact been the original National Conference founded by Abdullah in 1930s but merged into Congress prior to the 1967 elections). Abdullah remained in power during the National Emergency imposed by Indira Gandhi in 1975. After the Emergency was lifted, the Janata Party came to power in the Centre in the 1977 general election. Elections were called for the state Legislative Assembly in June 1977. Sheikh Abdullah now revived the National Conference from the erstwhile Plebiscite Front. The National Conference and Congress met head on as equals, the first time such an electoral contest occurred since the State's Accession in 1947. The Prime Minister Morarji Desai (of the Janata Party) took steps to strengthen security in the state and declared that any rigging would be severely punished. This had a 'salutary effect' in the political atmosphere in the state witnessing its first 'free and fair' election.; The revival of the National Conference was greeted with great enthusiasm in the Kashmir Valley. In the words of a Kashmiri, \\"the entire valley was red with N. C. flags. Every house and every market stood decorated with bunting.\\" Results The National Conference won the majority in the Assembly with 47 of the 76 seats. Whereas it won 40 of the 42 seats in the Kashmir Valley, it was able to win only 7 seats out of 32 in the Jammu province. The Indian National Congress (former National Conference, which had been in power since the State's accession) was reduced to third place, winning 11 seats in Jammu and none in the Valley. The Janata Party (which had incorporated the former Jammu Praja Parishad) won 13 seats, its best performance so far. In addition to 11 seats in Jammu, it won 2 seats in the Valley for the first time. Also significant is the fact that Jamaat-e-Islami won only one seat, down from 5 seats in the previous Assembly. Government formation Sheikh Abdullah was sworn in as the Chief Minister of the State following the election. By the end of the 1970s, the seventy-year- old Sheikh Abdullah anointed his son Farooq Abdullah as his successor. Following Sheikh's death in 1982, Farooq Abdullah was appointed as the Chief Minister. The National Conference government completed a full five-year term. Prior to his death, Sheikh Abdullah initiated a controversial 'Grant of Permit for Resettlement' bill in the State's Legislative Assembly. As per the bill, any state subject of Jammu and Kashmir prior to 14 May 1954 or any of his descendants could apply for resettlement in the State provided they swore allegiance to both the Indian Constitution and the Constitution of the State. The bill was passed by the Legislative Assembly after Sheikh's death, but it aroused fears among the Hindus of Jammu that Pakistani sympathisers and agents could cross into the State and create tensions. The Central government forced Farooq Abdullah to refer the bill to the Supreme Court of India where it has been put into cold storage. Commentary All the elections held in Jammu and Kashmir prior to 1977 were plagued with corrupt electoral practices. The elections of 1977 represented a 'democratic breakthrough', according to scholar Steve Widmalm. Politician Bhim Singh stated, 'Morarji Desai openly declared that anyone who would attempt to pursue some form of rigging would be severely punished, and this was quite effective'. The Congress party in the Central Government has therefore been regarded as an obstacle to the State's democratic functioning. The party regarded Jammu and Kashmir to be a sensitive border state, which was not 'ready for democracy'. Building Indian nationalism was considered far more important. Activist Balraj Puri has disagreed with the sentiment. In his view, the democratic functioning was indeed a prerequisite to integration and national unity. As a result of the democratisation process, he has asserted that there were ten years of peace with 'no fundamentalism, no secessionism and no communalism'. JKLF's Amanullah Khan has also endorsed the assessment. The observers he sent to the Kashmir Valley during the early 1980s reported that the situation was not conducive to inciting a rebellion. Journalist Tavleen Singh who covered the subsequent Assembly election in 1983 asked people wherever she went whether they regarded the plebiscite as an issue. 'Almost everywhere the answer was an emphatic no. People said that the past was dead and they were participating in this election as Indians,' she recounted.

For the first time women entered the Jammu and Kashmir assembly in 1972 assembly elections. That year, ten women filed their nominations, six of them contested and four won. This made the percentage of women legislators 5.33% in Jammu Kashmir assembly. Aftermath In 1971 an insurrection broke out in erstwhile East Pakistan, and subsequently war broke out between India and Pakistan which ended in the creation of Bangladesh. Sheikh Abdullah, watching the alarming turn of events in the subcontinent, realised that for the survival of this region there was an urgent need to stop pursuing confrontational politics and promoting solution of issues by a process of reconciliation and dialogue rather than confrontation. Critics of the sheikh hold the view that he sold the goal of a plebiscite for gaining chief ministers chair. He started talks with Prime Minister Indira Gandhi for normalising the situation in the region and came to an accord called 1974 Indira-Sheikh accord by giving up the demand for a plebiscite in lieu of the people being given the right to self-rule by a democratically elected government (as envisaged under article 370 of the Constitution of India) rather than the puppet government which till then ruled.Sheikh Abdullah; M.Y. Taing (1985), p. 827-838. Syed Mir Qasim most famously offered to resign from the office of chief minister in order to encourage and institutionalize the landmark 1974 Indira-Sheikh accord in 1975.

Biography Coleman began his film career in the 1915 silent film, The Mummy and the Humming Bird, which was also the screen debut of Charles Cherry, a noted stage actor. In his over 200 performances in films, he would appear in over half of them as either a butler, doorman/concierge, valet, or waiter. The 1930s would see Coleman appear in such notable films as Beyond Victory (1931), starring Bill Boyd and James Gleason, the Wheeler & Woolsey comedy Diplomaniacs (1933), 1934's Born to Be Bad which starred Loretta Young and Cary Grant, the 1934 version of Of Human Bondage starring Bette Davis and Leslie Howard, the first film to star the pairing of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, The Gay Divorcee (1935), the first feature-length film to be shot entirely in Technicolor, Becky Sharp, 1936's Magnificent Obsession starring Irene Dunne and Robert Taylor, the Spencer Tracy vehicle, Captains Courageous (1937), The Prince and the Pauper (1937), starring Errol Flynn and Claude Rains, and the Reginald Owen version of A Christmas Carol (1938). The 1940s would see Coleman's prolific career continue, including roles in many more notable films. Among these were: Buck Privates (1941), the first film starring the comedy duo of Abbott and Costello; 1943's Du Barry Was a Lady, starring Red Skelton, Lucille Ball, and Gene Kelly; Orson Welles and Joan Fontaine in the 1944 version of Jane Eyre; the 1945 film The Picture of Dorian Gray, with George Sanders, Donna Reed, Angela Lansbury, and Peter Lawford; and the 1949 comedy A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, starring Bing Crosby and Rhonda Fleming. The last film Coleman would work on was the Gene Autry vehicle, The Blazing Sun, which was released in November 1950. Double Dynamite, starring Jane Russell, Groucho Marx, and Frank Sinatra, would be the final film released in which he would appear, which would premiere in New York City on Christmas Day 1951. Coleman had worked on the film in 1948, but it was shelved for several years by Howard Hughes, and not released until after Coleman's death. Coleman died of a stroke on March 8, 1951, and was cremated and interred at Chapel Of The Pines Crematory in Los Angeles.

It has a large polar or sub-polar filiform prostheca very similar to that of Caulobacter. In addition to having a nutritional function, the prostheca also plays a role in the initiation of DNA replication.

He dismissed all consular agents, auctioned off their commissions, and purchased dancing girls. Shortly before his recall in 1872, he was involved in a brawl with three former Confederate officers. Background and career Butler was born in Massachusetts but spent his formative years in California. During the Civil War he was a lieutenant in the 10th US infantry and later a quartermaster and ordnance officer, resigning in 1863. He was a theatre critic and talented writer, contributing to various publications including Wilkes' Spirit of the Times. His drinking bouts often got him into trouble despite the best efforts of his friends and family. In 1870 his uncle, Congressman General Benjamin Franklin Butler, who had some influence with President Ulysses S. Grant, was instrumental in getting him a job as US Consul General in Alexandria, Egypt, as a non-career appointee. Butler presented his credentials on the 2 June 1870 and took up residence in Alexandria with his wife, actress Rose Eytinge. He employed an assistant by the name of Strologo, dismissed all of the US consular agents in the area and auctioning off their positions to the highest bidders. A missionary working in Alexandria, Reverend David Strang, attempted to intercede on behalf of the dismissed agents and eventually wrote to Ulysses S. Grant about the \\"corrupt management of consular affairs\\". Strang also wrote that Butler and his companions demanded entertainment from dancing women performing \\"in puris naturalibus\\". Butler came into conflict with several of the American officers serving in the Egyptian army. These were predominantly ex-Confederate soldiers/sailors, recruited by Thaddeus P. Mott and Charles Pomeroy Stone, who were helping the ruling Khedive to modernise his army. The Khedive also considered appointing the former Confederate General, P. G. T. Beauregard, as his commander, but Butler counselled against this and the Khedive withdrew the offer. Some years later Butler explained that \\"there wasn't room in Egypt for Beauregard and myself at the same time\\". A fight between Butler and three of the American officers occurred in July 1872; shots were fired and one of the soldiers was wounded. In fear of his life, Butler fled Egypt. The activities at the Consulate were investigated by General F. A. Starring. Strogolo claimed that his boss Butler was often drunk, took bribes, opened mail addressed to others and instigated the shooting of the army officer. However, Strogolo also admitted taking his share of the bribes and was implicated in an assault on the missionary, Reverend Strang. In 1875 Butler owned and edited a New York journal called The Arcadian; the venture lasted less than a year. In 1877 he was appointed Special Postal Agent for the Black Hills territory based in Deadwood. Travelling to his new position on the train, he became very drunk and made a nuisance of himself. News of this got back to his boss who promptly sacked him. Some years later he was the Forage Master at Fort Keogh but this time resigned because it was too cold. His marriage to Jewish-American actress Rose Eytinge ended in divorce in 1882; they had two children. Their son Benjamin Franklin \\"Frank\\" Butler (1871-1904) married actress Alice Johnson, but died an early death. Final years He became a sorry figure, drunk for days at a time, often living rough. He was even incarcerated in an asylum for a time to try and stop him drinking but celebrated on his release by getting drunk. During these final years in Washington one lady stuck by him and tried to protect him. She was Josephine Chesney who kept her attachment secret, but it became known after Butler's death that they had been married for several years.

Critic Donald Richie considered \\"The River Fuefuki\\" to be Kinoshita's last important film. Marcus Stiglegger found it to be one of Kinoshita's most experimental and spectacular films. The film is set during eld of the Sengoku period period in Japan, with the action marked by historical events from the Battle of Iidagawara and the birth of Takeda Shingen in 1521 to the Battle of Tenmokuzan and fall of the Takeda clan in 1582. The film displays the impact of the Takeda clan's actions on five generations of a farming family, particularly family members' decisions to join or avoid the Takeda's battles of the period. Alexander Jacoby found the message of the film to be \\"a simple pacifism.\\" Stiglegger viewed it as a pessimistic version of the samurai myth, contrasting it with Akira Kurosawa's samurai films from the late 1950s and early 1960s. Kinoshita incorporated a number of unusual techniques into the film, including freezing the action with still photographs during battle scenes. Richie interprets this technique as being a means to \\"both halt and hold the action.\\" According to Stiglegger, the technique is a metaphor for the immobility of a social system that has exhausted itself in its traditions. Another technique used in the film is the occasional addition of washes of color to portions of the black and white film. Richie filt the use of color in this manner to woodblock prints.

At least one bridge crosses the stream. The stream is most likely named after Alexander Colley, Sr. Course Culley Run looking downstream Culley Run begins in a valley in Benton Township between Steinbuck Road and Cully Run Road. It flows southeast for several hundred feet, alongside Cully Run Road. It then turns east for a short distance and then turns south, still following the road. After a few tenths of a mile, the stream crosses Pennsylvania Route 254 and turns east-southeast for several tenths of a mile, flowing alongside Pennsylvania Route 254. After several tenths of a mile, it crosses Pennsylvania Route 254 again. Several hundred feet further downstream, it reaches its confluence with Fishing Creek, not far from the community of Maple Grove. Culley Run joins Fishing Creek upstream of its mouth. Geography, geology, and watershed The elevation near the mouth of Culley Run is above sea level. The elevation of the stream's source is between above sea level. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation has made plans to put of rock slope protection on the right bank of Culley Run at a location west of the intersection of Pennsylvania Route 254 with Pennsylvania Route 487. This project was expected to permanently affect of Culley Run and of Fishing Creek. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation also has a permit to maintain a box culvert made of reinforced concrete on the stream. This culvert is long and high and is sunk into the streambed. Culley Run flows over alluvium in its lower reaches. This alluvium contains stratified sand, silt, gravel, and some boulders. It is approximately thick. Colluvium can also be found in the vicinity of the stream's lower reaches. It contains shale and sandstone pieces of various sizes. A glacial till known as the Illinoian Till can be found in the upper reaches of the stream's watershed. Bedrock containing red and gray sandstone and shale also occurs in the watershed.

Ted has always held a grudge against Jimmy and lets his current fame influence others, despite the objections of his own son Eric. When the kids are humiliated, Jimmy decides to find a sponsor. However, Ted's influence leads Jimmy to a road of nowhere until old friend and food truck owner Big Mama decides to sponsor him. However, to get the sponsorship, Jimmy goes to the next competition dressed up as a big hot dog, even furthering the humiliation of the kids. When the kids learn Jimmy got them a sponsor, they are happy until they learn they will be known as the \\"Underdogs\\".

Lerdo Landing was a steamboat landing for the settlement of Colonia Lerdo that was established on the east side of the Colorado River. It was originally served by steamboats of George Alonzo Johnson's Colorado Steam Navigation Company until the Southern Pacific Railroad reached Yuma, Arizona, in 1877 and bought out the steamboat company. The railroad company shut down its steamboat operations at Port Isabel, Sonora and ceased traffic on the river below Yuma. The promoters of Colonia Lerdo attempted to establish its own steamboat service, buying and operating the seagoing side-wheel steamship General Zaragosa and for the river the small propeller-driven steam launch the General Rosales. After the failure of that effort, wagons from Yuma and small sailing craft supplied transportation to the settlement until it was abandoned in the 1896. Richard E.

It was co-located with the American Central Intelligence Agency's Operation Hardnose at Camp Siberia 26 kilometers northeast of Savannakhet, Laos. The operation was founded although American intelligence sources in the area already shared their results with the Thais. Royal Thai Special Forces assigned as instructors to Operation Hardnose were utilized as reconnaissance teams. In early 1967, the CIA eventually severed the Thai intelligence operation from the instructional duties for Lao irregular military troops. Background American awareness of the importance of the Ho Chi Minh Trail took root early. It was soon concluded that if this sole land supply route through the Annamese Cordillera were cut or blocked, the communist insurgency in South Vietnam would wither for lack of supplies. Because of this, the Trail was subjected to constant air and ground surveillance by American, Lao, and Thai intelligence operations.Dunnigan, pp. 173, 299. Operations Operating in deep security, Operation Star's four six-man road watch teams generally infiltrated toward the Mu Gia Pass on the border between Laos and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. In one case, Team Red Bull was infiltrated overseeing Route 912 of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, only to be ambushed and dispersed. The survivors took up to a month to emerge from the Annamese Cordillera.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 144-146. In February 1966, Operation Star got to share in the newly assigned helicopter assets of Operation Pony Express for infiltration and exfiltration of intelligence teams. As 1966 progressed, Operation Star swelled to ten teams. In conjunction with the operation, the CIA tried using Thai espionage agents, in an attempt to hurdle the language barrier between Americans and Lao hill tribesmen. English-speaking Thais from the Royal Thai Marine Corps, Border Patrol Police, and RTSF were trained for 30 days at the old Wapi Project camp 36 kilometers northwest of Pakse. Inserted near the Ho Chi Minh Trail at the end of 1966, they were exfiltrated without moving onto the Trail. This failure saw them discharged by March 1967. It also led impetus to the efforts that developed the Hark-1 radio for Project Hardnose. Arrival of a CIA case agent to oversee the Camp Siberia operations in early 1967 led to changes. The five Thai instructors were severed from support of Operation Star, to devote their entire energies to training Operation Hardnose road watchers. A building program included two classrooms, obstacle course, dining hall, and a land navigation course. There was also a move to replace Thai instructors with Lao; to American surprise, the latter performed as well in the instructional role as Thais.

Note that it uses a single midship commanding bridge, and like other ferries at the route never needs to turn. A sister ship, Mercandia IV is still in use, since 2013 by Scandlines. The main port of Helsingborg, the medieval fortress tower \\"Kärnan\\" is seen to the right in the background. To the left, the Town Hall. The two-floor yellowish building closest to the water on the left, is the Sundbusserne terminal. The Helsingør–Helsingborg ferry route (\\"HH route\\") is a shipping route connecting Helsingør (Elsinore), Denmark and Helsingborg, Sweden across the northern, and narrowest part of the Øresund. Due to the short distance, which is less than 3 nautical miles, is it one of the world's busiest international car ferry routes, with around 70 daily departures from each harbour. The oldest-known written mention of the route dates to the German traveller Adam of Bremen in the 11th century, but it has likely been in use much longer. Before 1658, the route was a domestic Danish route. For several centuries, the route has been run regularly by various Danish shipping lines. Its significance grew during the 1950s, but since the inauguration of the Øresund Bridge in 2000, at the southern end of the Øresund, it has lost some significance but remains as one of the world's most important ferry routes, particularly as a cheaper alternative to the bridge tolls. Since 1952, passports have not been required for citizens of the Nordic Passport Union countries.  Current traffic  The route is currently served by car ferry shipping line Scandlines and a smaller passenger shipping line known as Sundbussernehttp://sundbusserne.se/ (\\"The Sound Buses\\"). Scandlines' ferries departure more than 70 times daily, from each port. Every 15 minutes for most of the day, and every 12 minutes during the peak summer weeks with an additional ferry.Note! Scandlines have several shipping routes, look at \\"Helsingør-Helsingborg\\" at http://www.scandlines.com/tickets-und-tarife/tickets-and-prices.aspx As the distance between Denmark and Sweden here only is around 2.5 nautical miles (approx. 4 km), the crossing time is just 20 minutes.same, Scandlines While Sundbusserne, currently (as of January 2015) departs every hour with their only \\"bus\\".http://sundbusserne.se/fartplan-priser.html Scandlines uses four ferries, MF Tycho Brahe, MS Aurora, MF Hamlet and MF Mercandia IV.Bottom of the complete timetable; PDF http://www.scandlines.dk/~/media/Scandlines/ScandlinesDk/Docs/Tidtabell-HH- sep-dec-2014.ashx The M/F Mercandia VIII is available and used during the annual maintenance of the other ferries and during the July peak weeks.The vessel in question is usually located at \\"the Ocean port\\" of Helsingborg port, it's painted in Scandlines colours The three first mentioned ferries are sister ships and were tailored for this short route. They use dual command bridges and lack natural prows and sterns (nor starboard and port side) and hence never need to turn. Aurora, Hamlet and Tycho Brahe are also built rather low (above sea level) and very wide. The Mercandia IV and Mercandia VIII sister ships were not built especially for this particular route, being vessels of the so-called Superflex type, and have a single bridge. As the bridge is located in the middle of the ship, they also don't need to turn around to change east/west travel direction. Although Mercandia IV and Mercandia VIII look very different from the other three ferries, all five ferries fit within the same category, which allows fastest possible return time. The crossing takes 20 minutes and the vessels only need 10 minutes in port, so the same ferry regularly departs from both ends of the route inside every hour. Sundbusserne currently (as of February 2015) uses only the Pernille, a passenger boat for around 200 passengers. A smaller bar is located at its prow and astern two decks are available for passengers. All Scandlines' vessels have cafeterias, bars, shops and Aurora also has an additional a la carte restaurant. This isn't intended for travelers, but more for local residents and others who makes one or more immediate return journeys (passengers do not need to leave the ships in port). Double or even triple return voyages are not uncommon. Locally this has spawned a new word (a verb)—to \\"tura\\" (Swedish) or to \\"ture\\" (Danish), which simply means \\"making at least one return trip for fun\\". In each city, the ferry terminals are directly connected to the main railway stations. Trains depart from Helsingør to Copenhagen four to seven times per hour and arrive at Copenhagen Central Station after 38 or 55 minutes (at more northern Copenhagen stations such as Østerport faster).http://borupgaardnet.dk/pdf/20010515144938.pdf Two different local train lines depart from Helsingør station. Both lines end in Hillerød, but one of them takes an indirect path, first along the North Zealand coast. From Gilleleje, the tracks turns to the south and pass through Gribskov, one of Denmark's largest forests. The short route takes 20 minutes to Hillerød, the long route 80 minutes. In Helsingborg, the ferry terminal is connected to an underground railway station. The entire building is known as \\"Knutpunkten\\", \\"The Junction\\". The total number of passengers from trains and ferries makes it one of the most busy stations in Sweden. Around 50.000 passengers (including them in cars and lorries) uses \\"Knutpunkten\\" every day.Helsingborgs stad (2003), stadskärna: Bevarandeprogram 2002, page 156. Helsingborg: Helsingborgs stad. Helsingborg is located on the Swedish West Coast Main Line (\\"Västkustbanan\\"), but the first 25 km north of \\"The Junction\\" station (until Ängelholm), only consist of a single track railway, which have some very sharp bends and a steep elevation in the northern part of the city.Last part of http://www.trafikverket.se/Privat/Vagar-och-jarnvagar/Sveriges- jarnvagsnat/Vastkustbanan/ \\"Enligt vår nuvarande planering kommer utbyggnaden till största delen vara klar 2012–2014.

Hence it is possible to make a full journey around the Øresund by the use of trains and the HH Ferry route. Local Pågatågen also departs from \\"The Junction\\", in four directions. In 2017 Scandlines began a project which is aiming for electrical power through huge batteries, in order not to emit greenhouse gases and other pollutants. The old oil (or diesel) burning engines will mainly be used to charge the batteries. The final intention however, is to abandon the old engines totally. The initial part will for instance reduce the carbon dioxide emissions by 50 percent.http://seglamedstrommen.se/ History Early history There is proof of traveling across the northern part of Øresund from earliest possible historical times, or since the Christianisation of the Vikings (in Denmark from around 985, according to the larger Jellinge Stone). The oldest-known historical text about travels across Øresund derives from the German history writer Adam of Bremen, who around 1070 wrote \\"From Zealand to Scania are many well used crossings, of which the shortest leads to Helsingborg.\\"http://www.helsingorleksikon.dk/index.php/Helsing%C3%B8r-Helsingborg_overfarten Danish and Kalmar Union King, Eric of Pomerania introduced the Sound Dues in 1429. This charge were to be paid to Denmark by every ship that passed through Øresund. They were at the time mainly enforced as a disadvantage to the Hansa, but soon became an important source of income for Denmark for the following hundreds of years. Helsingør became a flourishing and famous town. William Shakespeare unfolded his famous play Hamlet (written 1599–1601; first printed in 1602) at Helsingør and Kronborg Palace. At the end of medieval times, Kronborg was a fortress (completely rebuilt during the early Renaissance) and until 1658 the Danes had a complete view across the narrow northern part of Øresund. It was not only from Kronborg they could watch ships, but also from the tower in Helsingborg, known as Kærnen. The Sound Dues were to last until 1857—with exception for Swedish ships between 1658 and 1720—when international complaints initiated economic and political agreements. Fishers and ships that crossed the Øresund were not passing through, and were hence not affected by the Sound Dues. Before 1658, ships could pay their commission both sides of the narrow strait which constitutes the Northern part of Øresund. After the Swedish conquest of Scania, the ships which were bound to pay the charges needed to anchor just south of Kronborg Castle, as Sweden had never been allowed to take any dues. The sheltered location just south of Kronborg, where ships anchored in order to pay the Sound Dues, are the ferry berth of Helsingør today. Renaissance to 19th century King Frederick I decided in 1524 that Elsinore would exempt from paying royal taxes, on the condition that \\"his people\\" should be shipped across the route for free. This was a heavy burden on the people of Elsinore during wartime.(source states nothing about Helsingborg, which still would be a part of Denmark for many years to come) http://www.helsingorleksikon.dk/index.php/Helsing%C3%B8r-Helsingborg_overfarten In 1630 the ferry route was established and a \\"ferry team\\" was created. The size of the ferry crews and the fares were regulated by law. Contrary to other ferries within the Kingdom of Denmark, the \\"Helsingør færgelaug\\" (Helsingør ferry team) received all rights to sail the route as a vague monopoly. The ferry team was also awarded a part of the Sound Dues for ships that also used the ferries for parts of their cargo. In 1836 a shipping line began to use the paddle steamer Maria on the route. This wasn't well liked by \\"Helsingør færgelaug\\", who complained in defence of their 200-year-old privileges. The ferry men won in court. From 1840 \\"Helsingør færgelaug\\" received a legal monopoly on the route. But times were about to change with the industrial revolution. The \\"Helsingør færgelaug\\" continued until 1882, when Christian IX formally abolished the monopoly. However, in practice the monopoly was abandoned already by 1874, as Denmark's largest shipping line at the time had begun to operate on the route. Regular ferry history Kronborg Palace in the background. From 1874 the monopoly instead went to \\"Det Forenede Dampskibs-Selskab\\" (The United Steamship Company), which probably is more known as DFDS.After third headline at http://www.helsingorleksikon.dk/index.php/Helsing%C3%B8r-Helsingborg_overfarten \\"Dampskibenes æra\\" which means \\"The era of the steamships\\" Fourteen years later, in 1888, private ownership was abandoned, as \\"De Danske Statsbaner\\" the Danish national railways or DSB took over the service. Although the monopoly was formally abandoned already in 1874, DFDS never attempted to compete with nationally owned DSB. As a railway company, DSB surely was thinking of a train ferry line already from scratch. However between 1888 and 1892 they only operated the ship Masnedsund, which apart from pedestrian passengers only transported mail. But four years later, in 1892, did DSB open its train ferry route (open also for pedestrian passengers). No less than three paddle- streamers for trains were taken in use, Kronprinsesse Louise (in 1892), Thyra (in 1893), Kronprins Frederik (in 1898) was in operation before the end of the 19th century. And the first ship to use a propeller, Helsingborg (in 1902) was of course also a train ferry. The ferry crossing became a part of the \\"classical\\" train line between Copenhagen and Oslo and later also night trains to Stockholm.fifth headline at http://www.helsingorleksikon.dk/index.php/Helsing%C3%B8r-Helsingborg_overfarten The route was from its beginning a totally Danish matter (though some cars of the trains could belong to Norwegian NSB), first by 1931 did the Swedish counterpart to DSB, Statens Järnvägar or SJ involved. This was done through a deal which got the label \\"Midtsunds-trafikoverenskomst\\" (in Danish). DSB and SJ should from this year split all revenues and spending between them equally. The running of the HH ferry route was, however, still managed by DSB.After fourth headline, lower part, at http://www.helsingorleksikon.dk/index.php/Helsing%C3%B8r-Helsingborg_overfarten \\"De Danske Statsbaner overtager færgefarten\\" During the First World War the southern Øresund was mined by Denmark, Sweden and the German Empire at the request of the latterSwedish Encyklopedia \\"Nordisk Familjebok\\" 3rd edition, 1924-37 20 volumes + 3 supplementary 1937-39, volume 20, article \\"Öresund\\" but the northern and central parts of Øresund were not affected by this and the traffic could continue. During the Second World War, Denmark, despite their neutrality, become occupied by Germany on 9 April 1940, known as \\"Besættelsen\\" in Denmark.http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_historie/Danmark_1849-1945/Bes%C3%A6ttelsen In the beginning of this occupation the Germans expected the Danish society to keep working as usual. The ferries continued to sail, but with reduced number of departures. Competition begins An important date for the Øresund crossing was 13 July 1952, as passports were no longer needed for travel between the Scandinavian countries and Finland, due to the Nordic Passport Union.http://www.oresundstid.dk/arkiv/arkivkilde.aspx?id=1135&tekst;=Temaer It was first in 1955 that any Swedish shipping line got interested in competing with DSB on the route. It was the bus company Linjebuss AB which from then also became a shipping line. The new ferries become known as LB.http://www.helsingorleksikon.dk/index.php/LB_F%C3%A6rgerne From 13 July 1952, passports were no longer needed for traveling between Sweden and Denmark.http://www.port.helsingborg.se/allmanhet/farjetrafiken/http://www.oresundstid.dk/arkiv/arkivalt.aspx?id=1135&tekst;=Temaer&standard;=J This was soon extended also to Norway in 1954https://snl.no/Nordisk_passunion and eventually also within entire Scandinavian countries and Finland. And from the mid 1950s a golden era began as cars had become more common, people could afford holidays (and Copenhagen Airport has since passenger aviation began been the main airport also for southern Sweden). But also pedestrian passengers became more and more common. DSB had the same year as LB started to compete put the new M/F Helsingør on the route and later followed her sistership M/F Hälsingborg. Both had dual railway tracks on board, located laterally along the center of the ships. To the left and the right were space for a few cars, lorries couldn't be shipped together with trains, however. But a strange solution for the cafeteria and toilets, below car-deck, made these ferries notably unpopular. However, M/F HälsingborgSecond photo at http://www.kwmosgaard.dk/ferries/haelsingborg_1960.htm, information about the ferry - under the picture and M/F HelsingørNote the same info as about MF Hälsingborg at http://www.kwmosgaard.dk/ferries/helsingoer_1955.htm became the first ferries on the route which didn't need to turn. LB challenged DSB with a rather different concept, M/S Betula was despite she was 26 years old, when she became first challenger on the route ever in 1955.http://kommandobryggan.se/hh/betula.htm Betula had a natural prow and stern, and hence needed to turn twice on the way from Helsingør to Helsinborg, if the cars, lorries and buses shouldn't need to drive off the ferry backwards. LB would continue with that concept as long as they sailed the route. In Helsingborg the vehicles drove on board through the stern, and then drive off through the opened prow in Helsingør. The earliest LB ferries had the cafeterias well above the car deck which was the difference between watching the sea or perhaps feeling a bit claustrophobic. Helsingør Town wasn't too happy about the Swedish privately owned LB; the main trouble was the increased traffic that drove to the LB ferries. While the DSB terminal was built together with Helsingør's main train station, LB had to (by time) build two smaller terminals on the opposite pier. Which also was on the small road to Kronborg Palace. The LB terminals also caused ever-increasing traffic through central Helsingør and was generally disliked by Helsingør's local politicians. But the town simply had to accept the competition from LB. Just three years after LB established their line, in 1958, did Sundbusserne, small ships or \\"Sound Buses\\" (which couldn't carry cars, lorries or trains), began to operate on the route.http://sundbusserne.se/om-sundbusserne.html Sundbusserne made the route \\"all-Scandinavian\\" as they sailed under Norwegian flag, LB under Swedish ones and DSB under Danish ones. From around 1960 a kind of \\"golden era\\" began at the route. Both shipping lines ordered more and larger ferries. LB put M/S Primula in operation this year.http://kommandobryggan.se/hh/primula.htm By 1973 LB had replaced their first two ferries with four new ones M/S Carola 1964,http://kommandobryggan.se/hh/carola.htm M/S Betula (the second) 1968, rebuilt in 1985,http://kommandobryggan.se/hh/betula68.htm M/S Regula 1971, rebuilt 1985http://kommandobryggan.se/hh/regula.htm and M/S Ursula 1973, rebuilt 1985.http://kommandobryggan.se/hh/ursula.htm Betula (II), Regula and Ursula were sisterships, while Carola externally was a sistership to M/S Dana Scarlett, a ferry that mostly operated on the route between Landskrona and Copenhagen, 25–40 km further south.http://kommandobryggan.se/hh/dana.htm Also DSB ordered new ferries, larger, more pleasant for passengers and which could take lorries and train simultaneously. However they kept M/F Helsingør and M/F Hälsingborg as well. The four sister ships M/F Najaden,Second photo at http://www.kwmosgaard.dk/ferries/najaden_1967.htm information about the ship below the photo M/F Kronborg,Same as for \\"Najaden\\" at http://www.kwmosgaard.dk/ferries/kronborg_1973.htm M/F KärnanSame as \\"Najaden\\" and \\"Kronborg at http://www.kwmosgaard.dk/ferries/kaernan_1970.htm and M/F Holger Danske.Same as Najaden, Kronborg,Hälsingborg at http://www.kwmosgaard.dk/ferries/holgerdanske_1976.htm (There are a number of Danish ferries with this name, but this is the one which trafficked the HH- route) By the middle of the 1970s LB departed every 20th minute from each port, with their four ferries, DSB every 15th minute with their six ferries, and so did the Sundbusserne. On top of that an older ship called Marina sailed every hour from Helsingborg to Snekkersten just a few kilometers south of Helsingør's port.http://www.helsingorleksikon.dk/index.php/Snekkersten- Helsingborg_f%C3%A6rgerute In all 12 departures from Helsingborg every hour during day time and early evenings. LB operated also two other ferry routes, SL ferries operated at the central part of Øresund, between Landskrona and the northern Copenhargen port, Tuborg (owned by the Tuborg brewery) as well as a route from Helsingborg through Copenhagen Tuborg and Travemünde, Schleswig- Holstein, Federal Republic of Germany (The latter line was only used from either Helsingborg or Copenhagen, Tuborg to Western Germany, not between Helsingborg and Copenhagen). The three sister shipping lines were labeled as the LB/SL/TL ferries, where SL meant \\"Skandinavisk Linjetrafik\\" (Scandinavian Line Traffic) and TL meant \\"Trave Line\\".http://www.simplonpc.co.uk/ScandLinjetrafik.htmlhttp://www.simplonpc.co.uk/TraveLine.html End of the \\"golden era\\" The 1973 energy crisis and higher oil prices affected the Øresund crossing routes, from huge profits the privately owned shipping lines got financial difficulties. TL or Trave Line was the first to be closed down, this was in 1976. And LB's headquarters in Stockholm decided to move the SL ferries, which had sailed between Landskrona and Copenhagen Tuborg every hour or 90th minute since 1954 (crossing time was 70 minutes), to Malmö in an attempt to increase their profits ended already after eight months only. In October 1980 LB's headquarters in Stockholm decided to move the SL ferries from Landskrona to Malmö, but they still sailed to Copenhagen Tuborg Danish side. This made the crossing time 20–25 minutes longer (much due to the flat island Saltholm and its surrounding shallow waters), and the already existing route between Limhamn (a borough in southern Malmö with a port of its own) and Dragør (just south of Kastrup Airport) had a crossing time of just 50 minutes. And already eight months the SL ferries closed down. The move to Malmö was an obvious mistake. In the following year, 1981, LB merged with the shipping line which from 1960 had begun to operate in the southern part of Øresund between Dragør and Limhamn, Dampskibsselskabet Øresund A/S and the new shipping line name became Scandinavian Ferry Lines or simply SFL,http://stadslexikon.helsingborg.se/index.php?title=F%C3%A4rjetrafik which now operated the HH route as well as the Dragør–Limhamn route. The end of the train ferries All goods trains were removed from the route in November 1986, as two large goods-train ferries began to operate between Helsingborg harbour's western port (Swedish: Västhamnen) and the north port (Danish: Nordhavn) in Copenhagen. The huge goods train ferries were sister ships, the Danish M/F Trekroner, and the Swedish M/S Öresundhttp://www.hauerslev.com/danlink/materiel/faerger/oresund/index.htm were operated by DanLinkhttp://www.denstoredanske.dk/Bil,_b%C3%A5d,_fly_m.m./Jernbane/Godstransport/DanLinkhttp://www.hauerslev.com/danlink/index.htm until the opening of the Øresund Bridge in July 2000. But the passenger train line Copenhagen–Oslo continued to be using the DSB ferries across the HH route until the bridge opened 1 July 2000. Ironically, the so-called Linx trains between the Danish and Norwegian capitals went into bankruptcy a year later. End of competing (cars and lorries) In 1984 Helsingborg City Council and the Swedish government decided to replace the city's two railway stations with one. The single track from north was split up underground and connected to the railway from the south. It was also decided to move DSB's ferry terminal to SFL's. The new combined railway station and ferry terminal got the name \\"Knutpunkten\\", or \\"the Junction\\". Also in Elsinore SFL's two smaller ferry terminals would be demolished, located at the Kronborg pier, the SFL (and LB before them) terminals had caused a major traffic problem in the Danish town. All ferries from Elsinore should just like in Helsingborg leave from one single terminal. And also Elsinore station and ferry terminal was enlarged. The port wasn't expanded for more ferries, but the area just south of Helsingør port is usually calm enough to handle larger ships. Hence a space for two ferries was constructed on the outer side of the southern pier. Towards the end of \\"the old order\\", DSB finally replaced the \\"U-boats\\" M/F Helsingør and M/F Hälsingborg, which both had cafeterias below car deck, with ferries that had sailed on the Aarhus–Kalundborg route. They were M/F Prinsesse Anne-Marie and M/F Prinsesse Elisabeth. In 1991, when the new ferry terminals were inaugurated, the operators, DSB (the Danish National Railways) in cooperation with its Swedish counterpart SJ, and privately owned SFL began to cooperate. This meant the end of competition on the route. Also the names of the operators changed from DSB and SFL to Scandlines. The Sundbusserne still existed, but could only carry pedestrian passengers. The remodeled ferry terminals couldn't handle both SFL's former four ferries together with DSB's former six ones,about their names and how many http://www.helsingorleksikon.dk/index.php/Helsing%C3%B8r-Helsingborg_overfarten#Bilf.C3.A6rgerne instead three longer and wider ferries were ordered. The first delivered was M/F Tycho Brahe (1991) thereafter M/S Aurora (1992) but the third sister ferry was delayed, as the Danish and Swedish governments had signed the deal to build the Øresund Bridge. In order to maintain the capacity, two larger former DSB ferries from Great Belt complemented the Scandline fleet temporarily. M/F Hamlet arrived in the mid 1990s. From 2019 Scandlines has changed name to \\"Forsea Ferries\\".https://www.forsea.se ACE-link and Sundbusserne Sundbusserne was sold in the autumn of 2006, the buyers were another Norwegian shipping line, Eitzen Holdings, and by May 2007 was the name shifted to Ace link. In 2008, a large investment in two notably bigger passenger ships failed, and early in 2010 ACE-link went bankrupt. But soon a new shipping line \\"Sundbusserne af 2010\\" (The Sound Buses of 2010) was founded and has since used the original shipping line's boat Pernille.http://www.helsingorleksikon.dk/index.php/Sundbusserne The period of renewed competition After complaints of high prices, Denmark enforced a new law in 1996. According to this law half of the terminal in Helsingør was expropriated in order to re-establish a second competing shipping line on the route. Hence could HH Ferries begin to compete with Scandlines. In Helsingborg they already had found a location for a new terminal. This was at a distance from the city centre, a remote and far from optimal location for pedestrians. However, for cars and lorries the location didn't cause any problem. HH Ferries opened in 1996 using two so called superflex ferries, M/F Mercandia IV and M/F Mercandia VIII. However, after a larger cooperation bought Scandlines and through the purchase of the owners of HH ferries, suddenly both Scandlines and HH Ferries became two parts of one and the same cooperational group and the supreme management soon afterwards decided to close HH Ferries again. As of January 2015 Scandlines remains as the single operator of cars and lorries at the route. In 2015, HH ferried 7.4 million passengers, 1.4 million cars, 390,000 lorries and 20,000 busses. Two of the four ferries are scheduled to be converted to full electric propulsion with 4 MWh batteries each, being recharged from land by a robot when docked.http://www.tu.no/artikler/89-tonn- batterier-i-verdens-storste-el-ferge/348995 The Øresund Bridge vs. the HH Ferry route For drivers passing through the Øresund Area, using the ferries gives a 20-minute break, using the bridge is also notably longer After Scandlines as new owners of HH-Ferries closed the latter shipping line, prices went up. For less frequent drivers and their passengers, the single and return prices with Scandlines are almost exactly the same as on the Øresund Bridge (summer 2015). The driving distance, if using the fixed connection, is notably longer though. For people living close to the HH route, return tickets prices equals the single ticket (half the price)—but the return travel must begin prior to midnight. Lorry and bus companies usually have special deals with Scandlines. The future There are proposals for road and multiple rail tunnels across the route as well as partial bridge options. None of the proposed alternatives have a schedule or funding. The proposals have, to date, received greater political priority from Sweden than Denmark.

It is situated at the hill just besides the Deepor Beel. It is believed that Lord Shiva had incarnated here to destroy a demon called Bhimasura and protect his devotees. The exact location of Dakini is a debated subject. The Shiva Purana and the Koti Rudra Samhita refer to Bhimashankar Jyotirlinga on Dakini hill. Bhimeswar dham at Pamohi is interpreted by the devotees to be the same Dwadas Jyotirlinga. Bhimashankar dham of Pune is also referred by some people as the Dwadas Jyotirlinga. There is no temple here. Instead there is a hill stream surrounding the Shiva Linga and one can observe continuous water flowing over the Linga. There is also a Lord Ganesha temple on the half way to this dham. The road leading to the linga is very beautiful with hills, streams and bamboo grooves. Jyotirlinga and the hill stream at the Bhimeswar dham. Legend According to Shiva Purana, Kumbhakarna (brother of Lanka king Ravana) was in love with Karkati, daughter of King of Patal Lok. When Ravana came to invite Karkati’s father and Kumbhakarna to fight with Rama, Kumbhakarna refused to come until Ravana allowed him to marry Karkati. At last on the advice of Narada, Ravana agreed and Kumbhakarna married Karkati. After marriage Kumbhakarna left Karkati to participate in the war. After Kumbhakarna’s death, Karkati gave birth to Kumbhakarna’s son; who was named as Bhimasura. Bhimasura did penance to get boon from Lord Brahma. He later challenged Lord Vishnu to fight with him. Lord Vishnu agreed and lost the war to keep Lord Brahma’s boon. This made Bhimasura very arrogant and he started conquering various kingdoms. He imprisoned the king Priyadharman (also called Kamrupeshwar) and his wife Dakshinadevi of Kamrupa. King Priyadharman and his wife were worshiping Lord Shiva even in prison. When Bhimasura sent his army to stop King worshiping, they were destroyed by rage of Lord Shiva. Bhimasura wanted to kill king Kamrupeshwar. When Bhimasura attacked the king busy in worship at this place, his sword fell on the Linga instead of the king. Instantly Lord Shiva appeared and killed Bhimasura. The sweat from his body formed a river, said to be the same steam which is running over the Jyotirlinga now. The place where king was worshiping Lord Shiva was named after this episode as Bhimeswar. On the request of the gods, sages and devotees, Lord Shiva agreed to reside there eternally by the name of Bhimashankar.The Assam Tribune: Shiva Ratri celebration at Bhimeswar dham Access It is around 13 km from Guwahati.

It produces several lingerie brands on an international scale.  History  The roots of the Groupe Chantelle go back to the 19th century, specifically 1876, when Mr Gamichon founded a company specialising in the manufacturing of elastic knits. He tapped the discovery of the vulcanisation of rubber which allows improved conservation. The products were then exported all the way to Latin America. In 1898, he went into partnership with his nephew, Paul-Maurice Kretz, the first representative of the Kretz family. The company changed its name, becoming Les Etablissements Kretz. In 1902, Les Etablissements Kretz launched production of its line of corsets with elastic bands focused on comfort. In 1936, Jean Kretz took over the company, rebranding it SNEK (Société nouvelle des Etablissements Kretz). He then invented an elastic fabric with the width and height which would allow the Chantelle corsets to be launched several years later. His son, Claude Kretz, took over the business in 1949 and launched the production of corsets. He brought back the Chantelle name inherited from his grandfather Paul-Maurice. At this point, the Chantelle brand is first introduced, quickly establishing its reputation. In 1960, SNEK started to produce bras with the construction of its first factory in Épernay, in the north of France. The company then launched its Fête model made of Calais lace, then in 1972 it launched its Défi model, the first moulded bra. Bras soon became the company’s development engine and in 1976 it changed its name to Chantelle SA. In 1962 the group grew and started investing in the European market with the establishment of its first branch in Germany then in the Benelux countries and Switzerland. Today the group has 15 international branches. It is the largest French exporter of women’s lingerie. In 1985, Patrice Kretz, current Président Directeur Général, joined the group. In 1988 he suggested the launch of a younger, more affordable brand: Passionata. The success was immediate. In the late 1990s, Passionata started to be distributed on a massive scale. In 1993, the inauguration of the American branch in New York marks the Group’s expansion beyond Europe. In 1995, Chantelle SA launches Darjeeling, the Group’s first brand sold exclusively in its own retail outlets. The network gained further strength in France. In 2006, the Group made the acquisition of the Orcanta retail network, a new distribution channel. Between 2010 and 2011, the Group expanded with the acquisition of the Danish brand Femilet, and the designer brand Chantal Thomass. In 2014, the group acquired Livera, a Dutch multi-brand company based near Amsterdam. The Livera shops sell women’s lingerie products, swimwear and nightwear.

The claims for \\"homeoprophylaxis\\" were assessed as misleading by the Complaints Resolution Panel of the Therapeutic Goods Administration and a retraction demanded; this was ignored.

In 1883 he was commissioned to clarify the murder of a citizen of British origin, which occurred in the town of Merlo.

It was designed by George Gray Prentice and built from 1923 to 1924 by Lowther & Sons. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 3 October 2005.  History  Sandgate War Memorial Park is a triangular portion of land situated close to the Sandgate Town Hall. The war memorial located in the middle of the park was unveiled on 24 February 1924 to memorialize the men from Sandgate who had died while serving their country during World War I (1914 - 1918). European settlement in the Sandgate district began in the 1850s. By the 1860s, the area was frequented by visitors from Brisbane for recreational purposes and after the opening of the rail to Sandgate in 1882 the area rapidly developed as a seaside resort. The Sandgate Post Office was erected near the Sandgate railway station in 1887, the Town of Sandgate was proclaimed in 1902 and a town hall erected in 1912. By the mid-twentieth century, increased use of cars meant that more distant seaside places became more accessible and the popularity of Sandgate as a seaside resort declined. According to Brigadier James Cannan, in a speech given at the unveiling of the Sandgate monument, 330 soldiers from the township had enlisted for World War I. Of these, 51 were killed. The impact of the war Australia-wide was devastating with over 300, 000 volunteers from a national population of four million serving overseas and one fifth, approximately 60,000 dying. Virtually every community in every state was affected by the war in Europe and Asia Minor. After the war, memorials honouring those who served were erected in nearly every city, town and community in Australia. The erection of memorials peaked during the period 1919 to 1925. Typically, a committee of patriotic citizens was formed which raised money by public subscription and public entertainments. Land on which to erect the memorial was usually provided by the local authority. Expenditure was often considerable for the size of communities and war memorials became a matter of local pride, an indication of a district's patriotism and wealth. Construction of the Sandgate memorial was organized by a committee chaired by the Mayor of Sandgate (Alderman William Henry Bowser). The design was by prominent Queensland architect, George Gray Prentice, who was practicing at the time in partnership with Thomas Ramsay Hall as Hall & Prentice. The Brisbane newspapers reported that the memorial, composed of about 100 tons of granite and concrete, cost around £850. The granite blocks that made up most of the structure were donated by Alderman Bowser from his quarry at Samford and the top sills and the borders of the trachyte panels were of polished Victorian granite. At the unveiling, the Mayor noted that granite was used to \\"resist the seaside atmosphere\\". The front panel of the monument listed the names of the 51 Sandgate soldiers who had lost their lives during the war and the rear panel contained a verse composed by William Henry Lister, a member of the committee. The foundation stone was laid by the Queensland Governor, Sir Matthew Nathan, on 14 July 1923 and the completed memorial was unveiled by the Governor on 24 February 1924. Wreath-laying ceremony at the Sandgate War Memorial, circa 1923 The monument was built by Messrs. Lowther and Sons. This was an early Brisbane masonry firm, established in the 1880s by John Lowther. The Lowthers became one of the largest suppliers of stone and marble in the southern hemisphere by the time of WWI. Charles Lowther served with the Australian Light Horse in Palestine during the war. After his return in 1919, he executed war memorials for the family firm. Notable memorials built by the firm include the Digger at Blackbutt (1920) and the obelisk at Goodna. The extant concrete posts and chain surrounding the monument were erected in 1931 to replace a pre-existing wooden fence. Subsequently, to the unveiling of the monument in 1924, the names of Sandgate residents killed in WWII, Malaya, Korea and Vietnam were added to the monument. A memorial site for the Niuean Anzacs WW1 was unveiled in the Memorial Park on Anzac Day 2015. This is the first known Pacific Island memorial site of its kind in Australia, and the first in the world for the Niuean people outside of their island. The park that forms the setting for the monument contains a large small-leafed fig that reputedly was a popular meeting place. The grandsons of Hezekiah Shepherd, said to have been an inspector and overseer of works with the then Sandgate Municipal Council, claim that he planted the tree in the early 1880s and built a seat (no longer extant) under it. The rotunda in the park was built during the \\"Australia Remembers\\" commemorations in 1995.  Description  Sandgate War Memorial Park is a small island of parkland bounded by Seymour Street, Bowser Parade and Brighton Road. The memorial and surrounding gardens constitute an integrated and contained landscape within the island and provide a verdant forecourt to the former Sandgate Post Office and the former Sandgate Town Hall. The monument, a cenotaph form reminiscent of the Lutyens' Cenotaph (Whitehall, London), is the central focus of the park. Constructed from coursed pale grey quarry-faced granite, the monument is approximately in plan, rising to a height of about from a concrete plinth measuring about . A band of dressed and polished granite forms a collar to the stepped crown of the cenotaph. A low protective painted metal rail is erected to the perimeter of the plinth. Within this protective fence stand decorative bollards linked by metal chains. Plaques to the long sides of the monument list those from the Sandgate district who fell in WWI, WWII and the conflicts in Malaya, Korea and Vietnam. A verse is inscribed to the obverse side: > \\"They died, and yet in memory shall they live, That we may know the worth of > sacrifice, Know that their death is freedom's cause, Stands as a beacon > light to point the way To paths of peace\\". A large metal utility box located near a path to the north east of the memorial and a recently constructed wooden rotunda in a corner of the park are not considered to be culturally significant. The park also contains a green painted metal drinking fountain. Concrete paths across the island converge on the monument. The park contains mature palms, shade trees and decorative planted beds and hedges.

The memorial and surrounding park make a significant aesthetic contribution to the townscape of Sandgate. The park constitutes an integrated and contained landscape that provides a verdant forecourt to the Sandgate Post Office and the former Sandgate Town Hall.

The memorial is significant as an example of the work of prominent Brisbane architect, G. G. Prentice and the Brisbane masonry firm Lowther and Sons.

Of the publication Carter once stated that the purpose of the magazine was \\"to explore new possibilities and forms of expression, to develop craft and technique without becoming sequestered in an intellectual or academic ivory tower.\\" Redtape featured comics, fiction, poetry, graphic art, and photography. It also provided a venue for both established and emerging artists and writers of the downtown New York scene. Carter is the author of two books of poems; Broken Noses and Metempsychoses (Fly By Night Press, 1996) and On Bolus Head (Cill Rialaig/En Garde Books, 2012) — poems and prints in collaboration with artist Brian Gormley. He had previously been an artist-in- residence at the Cill Rialaig Artist Retreat in County Kerry, Ireland. Carter is interviewed on screen in the 2017 documentary film Shadowman on the late 1980s East Village graffiti artist, Richard Hambleton.https://carlosdev.wordpress.com/2017/12/01/shadowman/ References Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:American male poets Category:American publishers (people) ","title":"Michael Carter (poet)"},{"id":"44809094","text":"The 2005 Biathlon Junior World Championships was held in Kontiolahti, Finland from March 14 to March 20, 2005.

He also played non-league football for many clubs in the north-east of England. Life and career Robson was born in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear. He began his football career with local team Murton and spent time as a youngster with Southampton before signing for Third Division club Rochdale in 1996. Robson made his debut in the Football League on 25 February 1997, as a late substitute in a 2–1 defeat at home to Hull City. He played in two more league matches that season and seven the next, all coming off the bench, without scoring, and and was released. He then played for Spennymoor United and Harrogate Town, with whom he was the Northern Premier League First Division second-highest goalscorer in the 1998–99 season. Robson signed for a third Northern Premier side, Blyth Spartans, ahead of the 1999–2000 season. His Blyth career was interrupted by an ankle injury sustained in October 1999, later confirmed as a hairline fracture, that forced him to miss the remainder of the season. Returned to fitness, he scored heavily in his second season, at the end of which he had a trial with Darlington of the Third Division. He chose not to take up their offer, as he would earn more playing semi- professionally for Blyth and working outside football. Again the club's top scorer in 2001–02, he was equally prolific in 2002–03 when available, but was sent off several times and missed large parts of the season through suspension. His Blyth career ended with 86 goals from 126 appearances, and he went on to be inducted into the Blyth Spartans Hall of Fame. In the 2003 close season, he made another attempt to break back into the Football League. He was reported to have taken a week off work and paid his own expenses to take part in Oldham Athletic's pre-season tour to Ireland, and then, after scoring three goals in two pre-season fixtures for Darlington, signed a one-year contract with the club. He played six games in August, which included scoring the matchwinning penalty in the shootout to eliminate First Division club Bradford City from the League Cup, and a place in the starting eleven for Darlington's first match at their new stadium, but was then out until the end of October with a hamstring injury. He made one brief substitute appearance on his return, but was released a few days later by new manager David Hodgson, and signed for Northern League club Durham City. Given orders to \\"shoot on sight\\", Robson scored 24 goals in what remained of the season and helped his team reach the final of the Northern League Cup and finish as runners-up in the league. Despite interest from other clubs, he signed for another season with Durham. In November 2004, he suffered a knee injury that was to keep him out of football for a lengthy period. In May 2009, he was reported to be \\"keen to resurrect his career at Durham\\", and he trained with the club at the beginning of the new season, but did not sign. Robson played for Northern League Morpeth Town in 2009–10, and went on to appear for a variety of clubs in north-eastern non-league football: successively, Consett, Brandon United, Shildon, Stokesley (on loan), Newton Aycliffe, Sunderland RCA, and Bedlington Terriers. Robson joined Easington Colliery as a coach in 2017 and made one substitute appearance in a 5–5 draw at Heaton Stannington. Robson, along with the rest of the management team, left the club after that game.

W. 1996. Niebla and Vermilacinia (Ramalinaceae) from California and Baja California. Sida Bot. Misc. 14 The epithet, flabellata is in reference to the flattened branches of the thallus. Distinguishing Features Niebla flabellata is characterized by a fragile thallus divided into irregularly flattened branches spreading from a holdfast, to 7 cm high and 6 cm across, and by containing the lichen substance salazinic acid (without triterpenes; with consalazinic acid, sabrosin derivative), and by its relatively thin cortex, 25–50 µm thick, in contrast to 45–75 µm thick in Niebla josecuervoi, which also differs by the cylindrical-prismatic branches. The branches of N. flabellata rarely show any definite shape, varying from almost entirely ribbon-like, to often partly ribbon-like with irregularly dilated parts, or mostly dilated and variously torn along the margins. Black dot like pycnidia are common and conspicuous along the branch margins, on the cortical ridges, and at the branch tips, undoubtedly due to the relatively thin cortex. The species will mostly likely be confused with Niebla effusa, one that differs by having a rigid thallus that grows on ground instead on rocks, features that are associated with a thicker cortex (35–75 µm thick) and by the absence of a central attachment holdfast (in spreading over the ground). Niebla flabellata is one of the common pebble lichens in the Niebla communities found along the northern coastal peninsula of Baja California south of Campo Nuevo,Niebla and Vermilacinia Communities, Richard W. Spjut, World Botanical Associates, retrieved 22 Dec 2014; http://www.worldbotanical.com/niebla_communities.htm but it also occurs on rocks of canyon walls of arroyos, and on calcareous ridges. On Cedros Island, and in the Sierra Hornitos on the Vizcaíno Peninsula, and near Rosarito towards the southern end of the northern peninsula of Baja California, Niebla spatulata is recognized as a rare species that occurs with N. flabellata. It differs by having the lichen substance hypoprotocetraric acid. The two species appear to represent one of the few examples of sibling species in the genus.Culberson, W. L. 1986. Chemistry and sibling speciation in the lichen- forming fungi: Ecological and biological considerations. The Bryologist 89:123-131 Also along the northern Vizcaíno Peninsula is Niebla limicola, a species that has the flattened branch morphology of N. flabellata, the short bifurcate branchlets of Niebla arenaria, and the terricolous lichen habit of Niebla effusa, all which contain salazinic acid. It is found mainly along the barren tidal flats and on dunes with coastal salt scrub. Taxonomic History Niebla flabellata was first collected just north of Punta Santa Rosalillita (vicinity of Rancho San Andrés, 2 May 1985, as part of a 100 gram sample that largely contained Niebla caespitosa to be submitted for anti-HIV screening by the National Cancer Institute, but the sample was not immediately submitted because it contained thalli of N. flabellata and Niebla flagelliforma; the former is distinguished by having salazinic acid as indicated above, the latter with divaricatic acid and terminal flagelliform branchlets;. The entire sample was analyzed by thin-layer chromatography from which 55 grams of Niebla caespitosa were later submitted (14 Nov 1985) to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Natural Products Branch, among 63 other lichen samples, 59 of which were from Oregon. The sample was accessioned as WBA-202 with reference to the collection number S & M 9073 (for Richard Spjut & Richard Marin), identified as Niebla aff. testudinaria.Samples of lichens were collected from the Eastern and Western regions of the United States and Baja California, Mexico during 1985 for anti-HIV screening. Prior to 1982, samples for antitumor screening were supplied in 1 kilogram (kg) quantity (dried) to the NCI by the USDA Agricultural Research Service. In October 1982, the funding for this cooperative agreement was terminated. World Botanical Associates (WBA) was formed by Richard Spjut in May 1983 to continue to supply samples for antitumor screening. Lichens were considered a potential novel source for new anti-HIV drugs since they had rarely been collected for the NCI antitumor screening program. Richard Spjut, the Senior Partner of WBA, proposed that the NCI reduce their 1 kg quantity to 25 grams in order to obtain a broad diversity of lichen samples. The NCI group maintains an inventory of natural product extracts with details on the collection data. Voucher specimens are deposited at the United States National Herbarium (Smithsonian Institution) and cited in Spjut's 1996 revision of the genus under N. caespitosa. It may be noted that Niebla flabellata has been treated as belonging to a broad spectrum of morphological and chemical variation under a single species, Niebla josecuervoi, which includes all the other species of Niebla mentioned above and more.Bowler, P. and J. Marsh. 2004. Niebla. ‘Lichen Flora of the Greater Sonoran Desert 2’: 368–380.

A similar blackout had happened to him in the driving seat of a bus, although he had not disclosed the incident on his heavy goods vehicle licence renewal application, despite such self-reporting being mandatory. Clarke was officially told he would not face further prosecution, effectively giving him immunity over the deaths and causing protests from victims' families at the way the case had been handled. In October 2015 it was reported that Clarke had been arrested on suspicion of driving without a licence in September 2015. The incident was the third Christmastime tragedy to affect the city in four years. It followed from a similar accident in 2010 and a 2013 helicopter crash.  Incident  The accident occurred in Queen Street at around 14:30 GMT. The 26-tonne vehicle was being driven by 58-year-old Harry Clarke, with two crew members seated in the rear compartment, separated from the front by a railing. While travelling north, Clarke blacked out just after the traffic lights at the Gallery of Modern Art. After mounting the pavement the lorry travelled for 19 seconds, striking pedestrians, initially accelerating to before dropping to and as it struck walls and other street furniture. It came to rest part-way into an alley between the entrance to Glasgow Queen Street railway station and a hotel. The pedestrian collisions resulted in six deaths and a further 15 injuries. The six dead were a family of three from Dumbarton — an 18-year-old woman and her grandparents — and a 29-year-old woman from Glasgow, a 51-year- old woman from Glasgow and a 52-year-old woman originally from Edinburgh. Rail services at the station continued and were accessed through alternative entrances in Dundas and North Hanover Streets.Glasgow evening Times, 22, December 2014 From shock to respect: Glasgow mourns victims of bin lorry crash  Investigation  At a meeting between representatives of Police Scotland, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS), the Health and Safety Executive and others the day after the accident, it was concluded that the incident was to be treated as a road traffic accident and thus should be investigated by the police as the proper regulator (as opposed to the HSE for any offences under Health and Safety law). Having been admitted to the Western Infirmary after the crash, Clarke was discharged on 7 January 2015. He was eventually diagnosed as having suffered neurocardiogenic syncope, a fainting episode caused by drop in blood pressure. He waived the anonymity he was given immediately after the incident and released a statement in a newspaper on 5 February to the effect that he had been unconscious and had no memory of the crash. After the police investigation, which did not involve Clarke giving a police statement, on 25 February 2015 the Crown Office concluded that no criminal charges would be brought against either Clarke or the council. It had been determined that as he was unconscious Clarke did not \\"have the necessary criminal state of mind required for a criminal prosecution\\" and also that no breaches of Health and Safety law had occurred. It was, however, decided that a fatal accident inquiry (FAI) would be held to determine the cause of the crash and establish what lessons could be learned. The inquiry would examine three main aspects — Clarke's health and training, the safety of the vehicle and the safety of the route. On 25 June 2015 the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) withdrew Clarke's car-driving licence for medical reasons and banned him from driving heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) for ten years. The inquiry began at Glasgow Sheriff Court on 22 July 2015 before Sheriff John Beckett QC. Evidence to the inquiry found there were no mechanical faults with the vehicle and that the other two crew members would have been unable to apply the handbrake because they were wearing their seatbelts. No other safety devices were fitted to the vehicle that would have allowed a crew member not in the driver's seat to stop the vehicle. The inquiry also revealed that Clarke's medical history contained episodes of dizziness and fainting dating from the 1970s and that he had previously suffered a blackout while at the wheel of a First Glasgow bus, which was in service but stationary at a bus stop. It was stated that Clarke had been passed fit to return to work as a bus driver owing to failures by both the bus company's doctor and Clarke's own general practitioner (GP) to spot that Clarke had changed his account of events, telling his GP that the episode had occurred in the canteen, which the GP then attributed to the hot conditions and deemed to be unlikely to be repeated. The inquiry further found that Clarke had subsequently lied about this medical history, both when he applied for a large goods vehicle (LGV) licence from the DVLA in Swansea and in his job application to Glasgow City Council. As a result, Clarke was suspended by the council on 6 August 2015.\\"Glasgow bin lorry crash driver suspended by city council\\". The Guardian. 6 August 2015. \\"Glasgow bin lorry crash: Driver 'not fit to drive'\\", 7 August 2015 In giving evidence the DVLA admitted its self-declaration system had a weakness, since it allowed applicants to be assessed by either an employer-appointed occupational-health doctor or their own GP, and occupational-health doctors would not usually have access to the applicant's medical records. In August 2015 the head of the inquiry reiterated that the February 2015 decision not to file criminal charges still stood, clarifying that \\"this covered all aspects of Mr Clarke's driving and any false information he had given to doctors, the DVLA and Glasgow City Council about his medical history.\\" This was followed by confirmation that a possible prosecution in the jurisdiction of England and Wales by the DVLA for the non-disclosure to them would not be pursued either. During the fifth week of the inquiry, with Clarke still to give evidence, the family of one of the dead applied for an adjournment of up to three months in order to pursue a private prosecution against Clarke for dangerous driving, on the basis that the evidence so far showed unfitness to drive owing to a medical condition. The move was opposed by the family of one of the other victims but supported by those of the remaining five. After further discussions with the other families they decided to drop the motion while still intending to pursue the private prosecution. A subsequent motion by Clarke's lawyer to have the inquiry halted was dismissed as being against the public interest. Owing to the prospect of the private prosecution, when the inquiry resumed Clarke was warned by the Sheriff that he did not have to answer incriminating questions. On giving evidence Clarke declined to answer all questions save some that dealt with his recollections of the crash, leading to some of the families walking out of the inquiry. The inquiry was adjourned on 28 August, with the Sheriff anticipating reporting his findings by January 2016, although this could be delayed if it were deemed it would be prejudicial to the planned private prosecution. Upon closure the Lord Advocate, Frank Mulholland, reiterated the defence of the decision not to prosecute Clarke for the reasons previously given, explaining that the decision had been based on the fact the Crown would have had to prove Clarke would have known he was unfit to drive, something they doubted could be done based on a number of factors — his four-year history of episode-free driving after the 2010 incident, the fact that First Glasgow's occupational-health doctor had cleared him to drive after the 2010 incident and told him he need not notify the DVLA and the fact that First had given the council an acceptable reference. Citing DVLA procedures, he also pointed out that even if the DVLA had been notified of the 2010 incident \\"the worst that could have happened\\" was a maximum 12-month suspension and a return of his licence if there were no further concerns, and that the DVLA had returned Clarke's licence even after the 2014 crash. Based on this lack of evidence, he cast doubt on the prospect of a court granting authority for a private prosecution. The inquiry determined that no reference from First to the council could be found despite a detailed search. On 4 October 2015 Clarke was arrested for allegedly driving a car on 20 September, in contravention of the withdrawal on 25 June 2015 of his car licence for a year. He resigned from his post on 30 October, shortly before he was due to attend a disciplinary hearing to consider reports that he had failed to disclose issues in relation to his health. On 9 December 2016, the bereaved families were told that private prosecution for Clarke has been ruled out.  Vehicle  In January 2018, an investigation by SWD Media found that Glasgow City Council was still in possession of the Green DAF CF 75-310 bin lorry. The vehicle was purchased in April 2016 for an undisclosed fee – the lorry's lease had been due to end on 22 March 2018. The vehicle had been stored in a secret location since the Fatal Accident Enquiry concluded in December 2015 and although repairable, council chiefs had always hoped to buy the vehicle outright and scrap it out of respect to the victims’ families. A council spokesman confirmed: \\"Our position remains the same – we feel it is inappropriate to put the vehicle back on the road\\".  Reactions  Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon gave a statement following the accident saying that her \\"thoughts are with everyone involved in this tragic incident, and especially with the friends and families of the six people who lost their lives in what is another sad day for Glasgow and Scotland\\". The Scottish Labour leader, Jim Murphy, the Scottish Conservative leader, Ruth Davidson, the Prime Minister, David Cameron, the Opposition leader, Ed Miliband, Queen Elizabeth II and leading Scottish religious figures all publicly expressed their condolences. Many compared it to the helicopter crash in the city the previous December.  Bereaved families  In a BBC television documentary broadcast, relatives of the victims and survivors of the incident maintained that they had been told by a Crown Office official in one to one meetings that Clarke's prior blackout happened in a canteen, instead the driving seat of a bus, and that his obesity and lack of intelligence were major factors in not charging him.BBC News Scotland 3 November 2015 Glasgow bin lorry crash families speak out in BBC documentaryInterviews in \\"Lies, Laws and the Bin Lorry Tragedy\\" broadcast on BBC 1 Scotland, 11 November 2015.  Memorials  On the day following the crash all flags on Scottish Government buildings were flown at half-mast; the Christmas lights on George Square were switched off and the attractions closed as a mark of respect. A special service was held in St George's–Tron Church the same day. Further special services were held at Glasgow's St Andrew's Cathedral and Glasgow Cathedral on 24 December. An appeal fund for the victims was set up with initial contributions from the Scottish Government, Glasgow City Council and the office of the Lord Provost of Glasgow.  Previous similar incident  In the aftermath of the incident, media attention drew parallels with a similar previous fatalities to pedestrians in Glasgow city centre, in which two girls were killed on a 2010 Christmas shopping trip by a Range Rover that hit them on the pavement in North Hanover Street.

It was designed by Richard Gailey and built from 1884 to 1920s. It is also known as Lady Musgrave Sanitorium for Sick Children. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 22 October 1999.  History  Located on a spacious corner block facing Cabbage Tree Creek, Musgrave House is a low set timber building with a high pitched, hipped roof designed by renowned Brisbane architect Richard Gailey. Built in 1884 as a convalescent home for children from the Hospital for Sick Children, Musgrave House dates from the time when Sandgate and Shorncliffe were crowded with boarding houses and convalescent homes. Since 1939, Musgrave House has continuously operated as a boarding house for men. In its inception, the Lady Musgrave Sanatorium for Sick Children reflects prominent nineteenth- century ideas about health and childhood. Providing health facilities was not a main concern for the colonial government of Queensland, caring for the sick was considered a task for voluntary groups and charitable organisations. The idea of hospitals specifically for children was itself a new idea and had evolved steadily throughout the nineteenth century. Children's hospitals were increasingly established throughout the world in the latter half of the century. The vivid impressions left by a visit to children accommodated in adult wards in Brisbane led Mary McConnel of Cressbrook Station to launch the idea of a children's hospital for the colony. Indeed, at this time children under five years of age were denied treatment at the General Hospital. Thus, the Hospital for Sick Children in Brisbane was founded in 1878 and was the second in Australia. Statistics from the 1860s and 70s show how perilous life was for the children of colonial Queensland. In 1866, the Queensland Registrar-General announced that the infant mortality rate was \\"out of all proportion great\\", 49.25% of all deaths in 1863 were of children under the age of five. Half the children born in 1877 died before reaching the age of five. Dysentery, diarrhoea and typhoid were rife, along with many other illnesses unknown to medical practitioners of the time. At the same time, there was growing recognition of childhood as a distinct stage of life and less acceptance of the moralistic view that providing facilities for children encouraged mothers to abdicate their maternal responsibilities. Such was the prevailing attitude towards children when Lady Lucinda Musgrave became the first patroness of the Hospital for Sick Children. Lady Musgrave was an enthusiastic Patroness, attending monthly Hospital Committee meetings and \\"doing much by her loving example to interest others\\". The idea of a sanatorium was proposed in 1883 and she took up the scheme with energy, personally securing the land at Shorncliffe which was given in trust by the government. The choice of the Shorncliffe site for the sanatorium was in keeping with prevailing ideas about health. The widespread acceptance of the miasmic theory of disease meant that fresh air and well ventilated, well lit buildings were considered essential for recuperation and recovery from illness. Bayside suburbs which offered sea bathing and outdoor enjoyment in addition to fresh air, were considered ideal for therapeutic purposes. The building was completed in 1884 at a cost of . The architect was Richard Gailey, the official architect for the Hospital for Sick Children. Gailey designed the original Children's hospital at Bowen Bridge in 1883, charging only half of his commission to support the establishment of the hospital. He went on to design the fever ward in 1884, the morgue in 1885, the Resident Surgeon's quarters in 1889 and the nurse's quarters in 1891. Other buildings in Sandgate designed by Gailey were the original Sandgate Municipal Chambers and Town Hall in Kate St in 1882 (destroyed by fire May 1910) and the second Sandgate Baptist Church on Flinders Parade in 1887. It is clear that Gailey had accepted current thinking about hospital design and had adopted the pavilion plan in his design for the main block of the Hospital for Sick Children. Elements of the pavilion plan as it was adapted for the Queensland context are plainly evident in the design of the Lady Musgrave Sanatorium. With its centrally located entrance hall and wards to either side shaded by a deep verandah, the planning of the sanatorium has strong similarities to timber hospitals constructed throughout Queensland, albeit on a smaller scale. Kitchen and other service areas are located in a separate wing at the back of the building, enabling the wards to be ventilated with windows along two sides. Although the building was completed in 1884 and the permanent reserve announced in 1885, it did not formally open until 1888. Committee meeting minutes indicate that the sanatorium was in operation by 1887 and that it was the committee's unwillingness to enter into debt that caused the delay in opening. The three years 1884–1887 were spent fund raising and organising equipment and furniture for the sanatorium. Lady Musgrave furnished one ward herself and several other ladies \\"gave most timely gifts of the same kind\\", personally furnishing and equipping the other ward. Each ward initially accommodated six children in cots and beds. Patients and nurse at the Lady Musgrave Sanatorium An article in The Queenslander in May 1888 reporting on the formal opening of the building described it thus: \\"The building is a handsome and substantial wooden structure ...the entrance to the main portion of the home is from the shore. The centre is appropriated to the reception room, and on either side is a large ward; while the nurses' rooms occupy the ends of the verandah. The verandah, which has wide projecting eaves, formed to give the greatest possible protection from wind and rain, while at the same time affording splendid ventilation, will be used in the summertime as a residence and recreation ground for the children. From the reception- room a corridor runs to the kitchen and servants' rooms and on either side are the pantry, store and bathrooms and wc. There are fireplaces in the wards and the whole establishment is so arranged to afford the utmost comfort and convenience to the little patients and those attached to the institution.\\" The 1888 Annual Report of the Children's Hospital stated \\"The rapid improvement of the patients sent down is very marked, showing the institution to be salubrious; and the work being put in hand by the Sandgate Council - viz., forming the Esplanade (now Allpass Parade) in front and perfecting the drainage and levelling the sports ground at the back - will, when completed - make the sanatorium all that can be desired.\\" The sanatorium was also used as a place of rest and training for nurses from the Children's Hospital and respite for families who had \\"sickly\\" children. The yearly report of 1896-97 states that 87 children passed through the sanatorium. In 1923 the Brisbane Courier reports that the sanatorium committee met to discuss the disposal of the Agnes Thorn legacy. \\"The committee intends to lay out the legacy, which with the Government subsidy totals 450 pounds, in something of a permanent character, such as a memorial to the donor, who was well known to old Sandgate residents.\\" It is unclear whether the plan for a memorial ever eventuated. We can assume, however, that some of the funds went towards extending the building. The Courier reported on a \\"novelty coin and jazz evening\\" held in aid of funds for the sanatorium later in 1923. In describing the evening, reference is made to the new wing \\"beautifully decorated with mauve and biscuit\\". In 1920, the number of children passing through had increased to 162 over the year. Matron Maude Flewell-Smith became Sister-in-charge of the children's sanatorium in 1921, a role she held until 1927 when she was transferred to Brisbane Hospital's Sandgate convalescent home and became Matron of both institutions. Her daughter, Mrs Win Jackman remembers that during this time there was an enclosed bathing area and shed across the road where her mother took children to swim on a daily basis during the summer months. Arrival of Santa Claus at the Lady Musgrave Sanatorium There was an ongoing relationship between the people of the Sandgate district and the sanatorium. From as early as 1893, local fund raising events took place. Over the years these events included concerts, fish luncheons, dances and euchre parties and several of these were organised by local children. The children's sanatorium enjoyed a special relationship with members of the Toowong branch of the Ministering Children's League who organised a Christmas party at the sanatorium for over twenty years providing toys, Santa Claus and decorations which included the tradition of transforming one of the trees in the garden into a gift-laden Christmas tree. In 1924, the Brisbane Hospital Board had taken over control of the Children's Hospital and in 1927, the training schools of both hospitals were amalgamated. This signalled the beginnings of changes in hospital administration and practices that would lead to the closure of the sanatorium by the Hospital Board in 1931. Children were then transferred to Brisbane Hospital's convalescent home located nearby in Flinders Parade which by this stage accommodated women only. It appears the building remained vacant for several years, although local residents recall \\"state children\\" living there. Notification of land for sale by auction as a Perpetual Town Lease appeared on the 16 November 1939. James Brown took up the lease in perpetuity from the first of April 1940 at a yearly rent of five pounds, five shillings. The area of one rood ten perches was considerably smaller than the of the original Government reserve. Sandgate District Historical Society's journal By the Seaside tells that James Brown started an old men's home and rental was five shillings per week, meals not included. In order to accommodate the tenants, Mr Brown carried out work subdividing the rooms. In 1946 the lease was transferred to William Austin Fitzgerald and Mary Violet Fitzgerald on 28 March. Fitzgerald was the local stationmaster and used Musgrave House as accommodation for railway workers. Mrs Norma Turbet took over the lease in September 1960, eventually purchased the land at a cost of $3000 in 1980 and then sold the property in August 1999.  Description  Musgrave House is a low set timber building with a hipped, painted corrugated iron roof located on a corner block overlooking Cabbage Tree Creek and the foreshore reserve. The building faces south-east and the large block backs on to the Sandgate Golf Course. The building has a strong symmetry with a centrally located front verandah, central steps and extensions at each end. Wide eaves overhang the verandah which has a delicately detailed timber valance, dowel balustrades and chamfered timber posts with moulded timber capitals. The verandah has three wide bays with steps centrally located in the middle bay. The wall areas either side of the verandah are clad with vertical tongue-and-groove timber boards and have small sections of exposed timber cross bracing tucked under the eaves. Each contains a double hung timber sash window. The extensions at each end have skillion roofs, are clad with horizontal weatherboards and each has a timber door and set of steps. At the southern corner, the building has sliding, timber framed, multi-paned windows with coloured glass that return around the corner and continue along the western wall. The eastern corner has a timber sill at the same level as the windows but the windows are along the eastern elevation only. The building is set on concrete stumps with timber batten infill. The verandah is deep, with a tongue-and-groove ceiling and timber cornice. The walls are single skin timber with exposed cross bracing used to decorative purpose, painted in shades of aqua. The floor is covered with a black, bituminous sheet material. Four doorways lead off the verandah, including the entrance door into the central hall. Panelled timber doors with operable glass fanlights are located at each end of the verandah and lead to the former nurses' rooms. These rooms are lined with tongue-and-groove, have remnants of original ventilators and fretwork fanlights over blocked-in doorways that formerly led into the wards. The main entrance of the building consists of two timber doors with four upper panels of glass and a long glass fanlight. The hallway is wide, has a high ceiling with pale yellow painted tongue-and-groove lining. A rendered brick chimney with a decorative cedar mantelpiece is located on the western wall. The large mirror panel of the mantel is decorated with a painting of birds and flowers. Basic timber bookshelves are mounted on the eastern wall in the space formerly occupied by another chimney. Timber, wall-mounted lockers are to be found either side of the wide doorway that leads into the back section of the building. Panelled timber doors with fretwork fanlights are opposite each other at the back of the hall. They each lead into large rooms, formerly the wards of the sanatorium, now subdivided into four small rooms. These rooms do not have full height partitions and the space of the wards is discernible. The raked ceiling is lined with tongue-and-groove with two horizontal bracing members running across the room at the same level as the top of the walls. Light fittings and switches are suspended from these members. The northern face of the ceiling has a centrally located, timber framed, fixed glass skylight whilst on the western and eastern walls respectively, there are small corrugated fibreglass panels that also let in light. A section of rendered brick provides evidence of the chimney once located in the eastern ward. The chimney remains in the western ward, however, it has been blocked up and there is no fireplace. Evidence of windows is visible along the northern walls of both wards. The side extensions are accessed via partially enclosed passageways at the back of the building. Between the wards and these passageways are lean-to additions with skillion roofs that each contain a further two rooms. At the western end of the building there is also a timber toilet block with terrazzo floors attached at the northern side of the passageway. The western extension contains four equal sized rooms, with three- quarter height, fibrous-cement partitions and lino floors, the eastern extension is divided into five small rooms. The perimeter walls have multi- paned, coloured glass sliding windows and timber sills with tongue and groove lining below. Many of the rooms are furnished with cast iron beds from the sanatorium. Original doors are located in the wall between the former ward and the eastern extension. The kitchen and former maids' quarters are located at the end of the hallway in a small building semi-detached from the main building. There is a small north-facing verandah at the back of the kitchen with stairs to the garden that together with an adjacent bedroom forms an extension to the original kitchen. The kitchen building is single skin timber with exposed cross bracing, a hipped corrugated iron roof and a brick chimney on the western wall. The extension is clad with horizontal weatherboards and the verandah has a dowel balustrade and simple valance. The two sash windows have metal window hoods. The kitchen contains an operable, wood-burning stove, sink and a large, old, compartmentalised fridge. There is an outdoor laundry located between the kitchen and toilet areas, adjacent to a septic tank. A corrugated iron shed with lean-to garage and wood-chop area are to be found in the back section of the block. The garden has no mature vegetation.  Heritage listing  Musgrave House was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 22 October 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Musgrave House is important in demonstrating the development of health services, specifically children's health services, in Queensland. The building demonstrates the growth of the Sandgate-Shorncliffe area as a popular nineteenth-century watering place and the custom of going to the seaside for recuperation following illness. As a convalescent home for the children's hospital, Musgrave House is significant in demonstrating the establishment and development of health services by volunteer effort in early Queensland. Its subsequent use as a boarding house demonstrates the continuing appeal of Sandgate as a location for boarding houses and convalescent homes. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Musgrave House has architectural and aesthetic significance as an example of the small scale work of architect Richard Gailey and in demonstrating the acceptance of the pavilion plan in hospital design in the 1870s and 80s, evident in the internal volumes and planning. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The building's aesthetic qualities are exemplified by the high pitched roof, exposed cross bracing and carefully detailed verandah. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Musgrave House has special associations with the Sandgate and Shorncliffe communities. For fifty years local people undertook fund- raising activities in aid of the sanatorium and visiting children and their families were welcomed as part of the wider community of the district. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Musgrave House has a special association with the activities of prominent women of colonial Queensland. The sanatorium was named for Lady Lucinda Musgrave, wife of Sir Anthony Musgrave, Governor of Queensland 1883–1888 and first patroness of the Hospital for Sick Children. There is also a close association with Mary McConnel, founder and chair of the Committee of the Hospital Sick Children, who was prominent in many aspects of life in early Queensland.

The polyp is yellow or orange with about ninety-six long, translucent yellow tentacles. It can retract back into the skeletal cup, so that the tentacles become barely visible. This species can be confused with another yellow or orange cup coral, Balanophyllia regia, but that species never grows so large and has fewer tentacles. Distribution and habitat Leptopsammia pruvoti is found in the western Mediterranean Sea and the Adriatic and on the Atlantic coasts of Portugal, Brittany, the Channel Islands and southwestern England. Independent of sunlight, it is found under boulders, on bedrock, in crevices, under overhangs and in caves at depths between . In a sea cave in Italy it was noticed that the colonial coral Astroides calycularis was plentiful in well- lit locations but became less numerous in the darker parts of the cave while L. pruvoti became more abundant in dark positions. However, in locations where sulphur-laden spring water mixed with the sea water, this situation was reversed and Astroides calycularis was more common. The relative proportions of the two species may have been affected by the existence of mats of sulphur- digesting bacteria around the spring. Ecology A barnacle, Megatrema anglicum, is often found living parasitically inside Leptopsammia pruvoti. The breeding strategy of L. pruvoti involves high fecundity, a short incubation time for the embryos, small planula larvae and rapid maturation. The generation time is about 2.3 years and maximum longevity 13 years.

The mine opened in 1910 and covers underground. In the beginning, the leather and food industries were the primary customers. Today, road deicing salt is the primary product. History Rock salt was discovered in 1895. The Detroit Salt and Manufacturing Company was formed to extract the salt. The company went bankrupt before finishing the shaft down to the salt. A new company was formed and the shaft was completed in 1910. A second larger shaft was completed in 1925. The first shaft was relegated to hauling workers and materials. By the late 1950s, the company operated through both shafts, which are about 1100 feet deep. The mine was closed from 1983 to 1998, when production was restarted to produce road deicing salt. In October 2010, the Detroit Salt Co., LLC, was acquired by the Kissner Group of Canada for an undisclosed price.

Early life in the US  Jeanie Lucinda Field was born on 9 October 1833 in Massachusetts, probably in a family home in StockbridgeThe family of Rev. David D. Field, D.D. of Stockbridge, Mass. by Henry M. Field (1860), page 60 She was still a two-year-old when her mother, Jane Lucinda (nee Hopkins), died of consumption in January 1836.Ibid. and she and two siblings would be raised by a nanny until her father, David Dudley Field II (1805-1894), married his second wife, Harriet Davidson, in 1841.Record of the life of David Dudley Field, by Emilia R. Field (1931), pages 30 & 51The family of Rev. David D. Field, D.D. of Stockbridge, Mass. by Henry M. Field (1860), page 60 Her father was a lawyer who would later achieve national distinction as a reformer and briefly represent New York in the US House of Representatives as a Democrat. Through him and other family members, from an early age Jeanie would meet leading figures in American law, politics and other fields. For example, in August 1850, when she was 16, she accompanied the “Moby Dick” author Herman Melville and fellow writers Nathaniel Hawthorne and Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. on a hike and picnic up Monument Mountain in Massachusetts, then joined them for dinner at her father’s summer home in Stockbridge in the evening.https://www.americanheritage.com/melville-meets- hawthorne#3 The 1855 New York State Census shows her living in New York City with her father, her step-mother, and her elder brother, Dudley, along with six house servants.New York State Census, 1855, New York City, Ward 18 [database on-line, Ancestry.com]  Marriage and life in British Columbia  Among Jeanie’s uncles, Stephen Johnson Field (1816-1899), would become the Chief Justice of California and later an Associate Justice of the US Supreme Court, and Henry Martyn Field (1822-1907), became a well-known author. However, it seems she was closest to another uncle, Cyrus West Field (1819-1892). His New York home was next door to her father’s, and even connected by a hallway,Record of the life of David Dudley Field, by Emilia R. Field (1931), page 41 and it’s likely she met her future husband through him. Cyrus had won fame in 1858 as one of the driving forces behind the laying of the first telegraph cable across the Atlantic Ocean. In 1866, he befriended the Antigua-born British imperial civil servant, Anthony Musgrave (1828-1888) at the time of the laying of a new trans-Atlantic cable from Britain to Newfoundland, where Musgrave was the Governor. The following year, Musgrave stayed in New York as a guest of Cyrus.Halifax Sun and Advertizer, 4 December 1867, page 2 When Jeanie married Musgrave on 20 June 1870 he had become the Governor of another British colony in North America, British Columbia. The marriage took place in a five-minute ceremony in San Francisco performed by the Episcopal Bishop of California, Ingraham Kip. She was “given away” by Cyrus, even though her father was present.The Sacramento Bee, 22 June 1870, page 3Victoria Daily British Colonist 22 June 1870, page 5Victoria Daily British Colonist, 3 July 1870, page 5 From then often known as Lucinda Musgrave, she began almost two decades of life in British colonies across the world. In the official speech at the reception to mark the Governor’s return to British Columbia with his new wife, hope was expressed that the fact that she was American would help to strengthen bilateral bonds with the US just as the colony was moving towards joining the newly-formed Canadian Confederation.Victoria Daily British Colonist, 3 July 1870, page 5 However, within days of British Columbia joining on 20 July 1871, the couple left for England.Victoria Daily British Colonist, 25 July 1871, page 6New Westminster Mainland Guardian, 26 July 1871, page 3 A short time later, Lucinda Musgrave gave birth in London to the couple’s first child, Joyce Harriet Musgrave.  Life in Natal  From England, Anthony Musgrave’s next appointment was in southern Africa, as interim Lieutenant-Governor of the British colony of Natal.Morning Post (London), 5 April 1872, page 5Broad Arrow, 15 June 1872, page 19 He and Lucinda arrived in Natal in September 1872 after what one report described as “five chequered and gloomy years” of administration by his predecessor, winning praise for his tact, good judgement and a lack of formality.Yorke's Peninsula Advertiser and Miners' News,13 June 1873, page 3 Lucinda’s ability to join her husband in official or ceremonial duties may have been restricted for much of the time they were in Natal by the fact that she was pregnant with their second child. Dudley Field Musgrave (1873-1895), named after her father, was born on 5 Jan 1873 in Pietermaritzburg.South Australian Register, 8 April 1873, page 5 Soon after the birth, the couple received news of his appointment as the next Governor of South Australia.Morning Post (London), 29 January 1873, page 4 A few months later, at an official farewell ceremony in Durban, “universal regret” was expressed among the colonists that the Musgraves were leaving after only nine months.South Australian Register, 16 June 1873, page 6  Life in South Australia  Not long after the couple arrived to a relatively low-key welcome in the South Australian capital, Adelaide, in June 1873,Yorke's Peninsula Advertiser and Miners' News, 10 June 1873, page 2 Lucinda Musgrave publicly outlined her vision for her vice-regal role. In a speech delivered at her insistence on her behalf by Musgrave, she expressed her determination to join not only the “social pleasures and duties” of being the Governor’s wife, but also “the sorrows and griefs” of the community in which she was living. The speech came after she had laid the foundation stone for “cottage homes for the aged poor” in North Adelaide. Notably, she made no mention of Aboriginal South Australians, instead stressing the worthiness of an institution set up to help elderly colonists from Britain who had “endured hardships and privations” as “early settlers”.South Australian Register, 28 October 1873, pages 6-7 Lucinda had already become the patroness of Adelaide’s Orphan Home, which trained orphaned girls to be domestic workers.South Australian Chronicle and Weekly Mail, 18 July 1873, page 10 Later, she would also lay the foundation stone for the first home for convalescent patients from the Adelaide Hospital. A committee of women had worked quietly to raise funds for the project, and Musgrave also made a “handsome donation”.Express and Telegraph (Adelaide), 15 September 1874, page 3Evening Journal (Adelaide) 15 September 1874, page 3 Many events in the early stages of her time in South Australia should have been joyous for Lucinda. Her husband’s appointment had proved popular, with the South Australian parliament showing its satisfaction by commissioning a new government steamer named The Governor Musgrave.South Australian Register, 5 October 1874, page 5 On 10 March 1874, she gave birth to the couple’s third child, Arthur David Musgrave (1874-1931). She then learned that her beloved father, David, had arrived in Adelaide by ship on a round-the-world trip that same day to visit for a few weeks.The Life of David Dudley Field by Henry M. Field, (1898), page 251 However, a few months later, just after the newly- built steamer arrived in Adelaide from Sydney, tragedy struck. On October 9 1874, Lucinda’s 41st birthday, three-year-old Joyce Harriet Musgrave accidentally fell into a bath of hot water being prepared by her nurse. Joyce died two days later from the severe scalding she’d received.Evening Journal (Adelaide), 12 October 1874, page 2 Lucinda was pregnant at the time of the loss of her daughter, giving birth to another son, Herbert, on 11 May 1875.Record of the life of David Dudley Field, by Emilia R. Field (1931), page 52 A few months later, it was learned that her husband had been knighted by Queen Victoria.The Express and Telegraph (Adelaide), 15 October 1875, page 2 For the rest of his life, he was known as Sir Anthony Musgrave, and she became Lady Lucinda Musgrave. The couple continued official and social duties in South Australia without controversy until news came through in late 1876 of another promotion for him, this time to be Governor of Jamaica. At a farewell function at Government House in January 1877, Lucinda entertained “a large number of ladies and the gentlemen accompanying them”. In her address, she said she was taking away two children born in Adelaide who must always have a personal interest in their birthplace, and to her the city would always be “inexpressibly dear” to her, a probable reference to it being the burial place of her daughter, Joyce.Evening Journal (Adelaide), 26 January 1877, page 3 When the Musgraves sailed out of Adelaide on their way to the West Indies, they left behind a land sub-division in the south-east corner of the colony called “the Hundred of Joyce”, named after their daughter, and within it, plans for a new township called Lucindale.South Australian Register, 26 January 1877, page 7  Life in Jamaica  The Jamaica appointment presented more opportunities for Lucinda to catch up with her then 72-year-old father, David. She arrived in Jamaica in October 1877, having given her father “unspeakable happiness” by visiting him at his home in Stockton, Massachusetts, on the way.The Life of David Dudley Field by Henry M. Field, (1898), page 277 Her father would visit Jamaica in 1880 and go with Lucinda into the rugged hills of St Andrew, overlooking Kingston city and harbour, where she and her family sought refuge from the summer heat in a vine-covered cottage called Flamstead.Ibid. page 288 During the visit, she pointed out to her father a treacherous mountain hillside where she’d been thrown from a runaway horse. “It is a frightful place, and it was a miracle that she was not killed,” he recorded.Ibid. page 289 During her time in Jamaica, Lucinda would accompany her husband in performing the same sort of social and ceremonial functions she had performed in Adelaide. However, her most notable achievement would be as the founder of what would become known as the Lady Musgrave Women’s Self-help Society. This group was established in 1879 “for the instruction of poor women of the better class in various kinds of ornamental and fancy work, with a view to the sale of such work in the US and elsewhere”.Kingston Daily Gleaner, 30 July 1879, page 2 To women who provided certificates of commendation from their local clergymen, the Society offered six months of free classes in needlework and straw-plaiting, if they didn’t have other craft skills. For a fee, women could market their crafts through the Society, then keep the profits.Ibid. 2 March 1883, page 2 Members of the Society expressed sadness in 1883 when they heard that Lucinda would be leaving Jamaica, following her husband’s appointment as the next Governor of the colony of Queensland. In a formal address on the eve of her departure in April 1883, the committee of the Society in Kingston told Lucinda that “sad hearts have been cheered by your kindness, bitter needs relieved by your charity, dark lives brightened by your thoughtful wisdom”Ibid. 18 April 1883, page 2 Hundreds of members of the Society in the outer district of Portland would sign a statement expressing similar sentiments.Papers of Sir Anthony Musgrave (as filmed by the AJCP): [M412], 1862-1912, File 4, Address to Lady Musgrave, 1883  Life in Queensland  After arriving in Brisbane in November 1883, Lucinda would again take on a range of social and ceremonial functions, often alongside her husband, but sometimes on her own account. Organisations of which she agreed to be patron included the Lady Bowen Hospital in Brisbane, named after one of her predecessors,The Telegraph, 19 March 1885, page 2 the Brisbane Charity Organisation Society,The Brisbane Courier, 13 May 1884, page 5Ibid, 24 April 1885, page 6 and the Brisbane Industrial Home, which offered training and “shelter, relief and Christian sympathy to fallen and friendless women who have resolved to lead a new life”. Queensland Figaro and Punch, 26 September 1885, page 31 She also travelled extensively to other parts of Queensland with Musgrave, and became involved in charity projects outside Brisbane. For example, within months of her agreeing to become patron of a safe maternity facility for women in Maryborough, enough funds had been raised for the new “Lady Musgrave Lying-In Hospital” to begin receiving patients.Maryborough Chronicle, Wide Bay and Burnett Advertiser, 24 April 1884, page 2Ibid, 4 February 1885, page 2 Much of Lucinda’s charity work in Queensland would involve helping young single women who arrived in the colony as immigrants from Britain or other colonies. Her involvement began in 1884 after she became the inaugural patron of the Young Women’s Institute. Emanating from the Young Women’s Christian Association, the Institute provided temporary safe accommodation in Brisbane for women who could demonstrate “respectability of character” and who were seeking work as teachers or governesses.The Telegraph, 7 March 1884, page 3The Week, 28 March 1885, page 7The Brisbane Courier, 14 May 1885, page 5 After concerns were voiced at public meetings that similar help was needed for young women seeking other types of work, and who didn’t necessarily have anyone to vouch for their characters, a women’s committee headed by Lucinda established the Lady Musgrave Lodge in Brisbane in June 1885.Brisbane Courier, 14 May 1885, page 5Ibid, 19 May 1885, page 3The Telegraph, 11 June 1885, page 5 After a few months of operation, girls who had stayed at the Lodge had found employment as general servants, housemaids, nurses, dressmakers and shop assistants.The Telegraph, 8 October 1885, page 2The Brisbane Courier, 4 November 1885, page 2The Telegraph, 4 February 1887, page 4The Brisbane Courier, 13 July 1887, page 50 By 1888, when a new government “depot” opened to receive immigrant women in Brisbane, demand for places in the Lady Musgrave Lodge did not dwindle, with the majority of young women using it being locally-born single girls engaged as domestic servants.The Brisbane Courier, 6 July 1888, page 6 A week after the last meeting of the Lodge that she would attend, just a few minutes into her 55th birthday on 9 October 1888, Musgrave died unexpectedly at Government House in Brisbane. “My life today has gone out,” she recorded in her diary.Papers of Sir Anthony Musgrave (as filmed by the AJCP): [M412], 1862-1912, File 8, Diary of Lady Cosgrove 1 Jan-31 Dec 1888 It was reported that soon after Musgrave’s funeral, Lucinda would return to Britain, where her sons were at boarding school.The Telegraph, 12 October 1888, page 4 Before she left Queensland, she would receive numerous messages of condolence, including from organisations which she had supported in her vice-regal role. Many local newspaper reports lamenting Musgrave’s death and praising his time as Governor also paid tribute to her. “It is impossible to exaggerate the utility of her practical interest in the social work of this city: an interest which has been active and generous,” wrote one Brisbane paper.The Telegraph, 10 October 1888, page 4 “In all works of charity, more especially in any object for the benefit of women and children, Lady Musgrave’s name was ever to the fore; and not her name alone, but her time, her services, and her open hands,” wrote another.Queensland Times, Ipswich Herald and General Advertiser, 3 November 1888, page 7  Life in Britain  On her arrival in London in December 1888, Lucinda was met by her father, who had sent a telegraph promising to meet her there as soon as he heard of Musgrave’s death.The Life of David Dudley Field by Henry M. Field, (1898), page 304 For a time, she lived in a house close to the famous Harrow school so her three sons could attend it.Ibid. page 308 Her father, David, would become a regular visitor from America. When he made his last overseas trip against doctors’ advice to see her and her sons in 1894, they had finished their studies at Harrow, and she had moved to a 400-year-old house called “Hurst-an-Clays” at East Grinstead in Sussex. Dudley had joined the Royal Navy, Arthur was at military school at Woolwich, and the youngest, Herbert, had applied to join the same school.The Life of David Dudley Field by Henry M. Field, (1898), pages 334-5Record of the life of David Dudley Field, by Emilia R. Field (1931), page 51 Not long after returning to New York after visiting her, Lucinda’s father died in April 1894.The Boston Globe, 13 April 1894, page 1 He left the bulk of his considerable estate to Lucinda, “the one he loved most on earth”. Altoona Tribune, 19 April 1894, page 1The Life of David Dudley Field by Henry M. Field, (1898), page 345 In April 1895, Lucinda was struck by tragedy again, with the loss of a second child, Dudley, who died of typhoid fever in Bombay (now Mumbai) as a Navy midshipman, aged 21.Record of the life of David Dudley Field, by Emilia R. Field (1931), page 52 Perhaps in response, she joined the committee of the newly-formed Colonial Nursing Association. Its aim was to provide more trained nurses throughout the British Empire to colonists who could afford to pay for private nursing services.London Evening Standard, 16 July 1896, page 7Daily Telegraph & Courier, 14 December 1897, page 9 Lucinda was an active member of the Association at least until the eve of World War I in June 1914.Westminster Gazette, 10 June 1914, page 5 That war would cost her a third child. Her youngest son, Herbert, born in Adelaide in 1875, would be killed in action in France as an army major in June 1918, leaving behind a wife (nee Georgiana Hopkins) and two children – one called Jeanie Lucinda Musgrave, after her grandmother.Record of the life of David Dudley Field, by Emilia R. Field (1931), page 53 Other organisations backed by Lucinda after she moved to Sussex were of a distinctly conservative political nature. These included the Primrose League, which supported the British Conservative Party and its candidates for election to the House of Commons. In the early 1900s, she became president of the East Grinstead branch of the League, and her home and its large gardens were used to host fund-raising events.Sussex Agricultural Express, 18 June 1904, page 3West Sussex Gazette, 4 June 1914, page 5 At a time when many women in Britain were campaigning for voting rights, she also became president of the local branch of the Women’s National Anti-Suffrage League, and also allowed her home to be used for its meetings. London Standard, 25 July, 1910, page 10Sussex Times, 18 July 1911, page 5West Sussex Gazette, 14 August 1913, page 5 At one meeting, Lucinda reportedly stated that she thought that voting rights for women “would do a lot of harm”, adding that overall, women were not equal to men in endurance, intellect or “nervous energy”.East Grinstead Observer, 27 May 1911, page 8 From her home in Sussex, Lucinda also spent considerable time organising memorials for her late husband in the various colonies in which he had been an administrator or governor. These included a church lectern in Nevis, a small boat called the Governor Musgrave to be used by a missionary group in British Columbia, and a competitive “shield” in his honour among members of the Church Lads’ Brigade in Newfoundland.Papers of Sir Anthony Musgrave (as filmed by the AJCP): [M412], 1862-1912, File 3,Correspondence of Lady Musgrave concerning memorials in honour of her husband, 1910 – 1913 Lucinda died at the age of 86 on 12 Aug 1920 at East Grinstead. She left an estate valued at just under £60,000. She was survived by one of her four children, Arthur David Musgrave, then a British army colonel.Scotland, National Calendar of Confirmations and Inventories, 1876-1936Portsmouth Evening News, 21 December 1920, page 2  Legacy  The Lady Musgrave Women’s Self-help Society in Jamaica continued to operate until at least the mid-1930s, well after her death, and more than 50 years after she left the colony.The Daily Gleaner, 16 November 1935, page 20 Although the Society had initially catered primarily for poor members of Jamaica’s minority white and “coloured” communities,International Journal of Gender and Women’s Studies, Vol 2 (3), September 2014, page 16 it was later seen as having helped to raise international awareness of Jamaican craft skills, including those based on African artwork.Caribbean Women and Their Art by Mary Ellen Snodgrass (2019), page 107 At the Colonial and Indian Exhibition in London in 1886, for example, the Society’s display included items made of African lace-bark work, and a traditional Afro-Caribbean clay cooking pot, a yabba.Catalogue of the Colonial and Indian Exhibition, 1886, page 413 The Society was also seen as an agent for change as it exposed many Jamaican women to organised mass movements for the first time, ahead of later campaigns for political, educational and legal rights for all communities.Gender in Caribbean Development, Centre for Gender and Development Studies, University of the West Indies (1999), page 64, In Australia, the Lady Musgrave Trust, originating from the Lodge, remained in operation in 2020, describing itself as “Queensland’s oldest charity and a champion for homeless women”. The Trust estimated it had so far helped about 10,000 vulnerable women and their children with shelter and other support services since its establishment in 1885.https://ladymusgravetrust.org.au/about/our-history/ In Britain, a report about Lady Musgrave and her support for the Anti-suffrage League would be used in the 21st Century in online educational materials for students learning about British history.https://spartacus-educational.com/Wanti.htm  Place and boat names  In addition to the township of Lucindale in South Australia, there is also a town called Lucinda near Ingham in Queensland, and there is a Lady Musgrave Island near the southern end of the Great Barrier Reef. At least as late as 2020, there was a Lady Musgrave Avenue in Kingston, Jamaica, and various Lady Musgrave thoroughfares in parts of Queensland. Lucinda Musgrave also had boats named in her honour. In September 1884, a privately-owned steamer called the Lady Musgrave, described as “one of the finest boats ever built in Queensland” was launched. It was used for Brisbane River trips and coastal trade.The Telegraph, 6 September 1884, page 4The Brisbane Courier, 8 September 1884, page 5The Telegraph, 10 November 1884, page 4The Week, 1 October 1887, page 16 Around the same time, two new paddle steamers commissioned by the Queensland government – the Lucinda and the Musgrave – were built in England, though only the Lucinda survived the voyage to the colony, the Musgrave being wrecked after running aground near Colombo.The Brisbane Courier, 12 January 1885, page 4  External links  https://ladymusgravetrust.org.au/  Further reading  The family of Rev.

It was built from 1870s to 1930s circa. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 9 July 1993.  History  Saltwood, circa 1940 This sprawling, single-storeyed timber residence was constructed apparently in several stages during the 1870s and 1880s, as a holiday residence for the Hart and Drury families. Sandgate/Shorncliffe began development in the 1860s, particularly for those who could afford private transport and holiday residences. With the extension of the railway from Brisbane to Sandgate in 1882, the permanent population grew, and weekend holiday-makers turned the township into a bustling seaside resort. The Saltwood site was first alienated from the crown in 1854 by William Sheehan of Brisbane, as a 2 rood allotment. In 1867 it was subdivided into five blocks, and in January 1874 the four which fronted Shorncliffe (Parade) were acquired by Graham Lloyd Hart of Greylands, a prominent Brisbane solicitor. The first section of the building was erected probably for Hart in the mid to late 1870s, as a seaside holiday residence. A transverse section along the western side, and two rear wings, was constructed probably at a later date, possibly in the 1880s, although the southern wing may have been the original detached service wing. Although Edward Robert Drury, general manager of the Queensland National Bank, did not acquire Saltwood until 1895, he and his family appear to have shared the house with the Hart family, as a holiday home. As early as 1882, Drury had acquired the fifth subdivision of the original site, fronting Swan Street, and this became part of the Saltwood grounds. A photograph dated , shows a separate timber building on the fifth subdivision, which may have been erected soon after Drury's purchase of the site. This building is no longer extant. Drury died at Saltwood early in 1896, but the residence remained in the Drury family until 1919. It may have functioned as a boarding house or guest house from about 1900. From 1920 to 1979 the property was owned by the McMenamin family, who used two rooms as a doctor's surgery and locum's room in the late 1960s. During their occupancy, the original picket fence was replaced with the present masonry and timber structure, and by the early 1950s, a tennis court had been created on the lawn to the south of the residence, and the open space between the two rear wings had been covered. The residence was renovated in the 1980s, and verandahs added to the rear extension after 1986. Most of the present planting dates to the early 1980s.  Description  Saltwood, 2006 Saltwood is a single- storeyed chamferboard residence, with a hipped corrugated iron roof, located on the southern corner of Swan Street and Shorncliffe Parade. The building is sited on the crest of a rise opposite Moora park, with views over Moreton Bay and to the islands beyond. The building has concrete stumps and is built close to the corner boundary, with a large lawn to the east. The earliest northern section of the building has verandahs to three sides, with shaped timber brackets, chamfered posts with capitals, cross-braced balustrade and boarded ceilings. The main entry is from the northwest via a gabled entry with fretwork panel, paired posts and timber louvred doors, and a panelled timber entry door with original hardware. French doors with fanlights and timber shutters open from each room. The central transverse section consists of two large projecting bays, to the northwest and southeast, surmounted by a timber finial with bracketed eaves, sash windows and shutters. The southern section has two parallel hipped sections, with a flat roofed section between, surrounded by a recent verandah with a curved corrugated iron awning and timber details to match the earlier section. Internally, there is a central L-shaped hall, with bedrooms in the northern section and living and dining rooms in the central section. The southern section has been altered and refitted, with a recent kitchen and family room, with two skylight shafts inserted in the hall area. The building has cedar joinery; including a fireplace surround, fretwork ceiling roses and internal doors with fanlights, original door hardware, tongue and groove walls and boarded ceilings. The northern bedroom has a fibrous cement ceiling and a large opening which originally housed four-fold cedar doors, which are currently in storage. The former kitchen has a large fireplace, plaster ceiling, built-in cupboards and sash windows with diamond pattern, lead framed glazing. The street frontage has a substantial brick pier and timber batten fence, with a gateway on the northwest supporting an overhead beam with the name SALTWOOD.

Early life Laurence (aka Lawrence) Makata was born in 1916 in Ndirande near Blantyre, Nyasaland (now Malawi) into an influential Yao family. Eschewing a mission education, which would have been the normal step to a position of relative influence for one of his background, he left school early to work in Hall's Garage as a driver and mechanic. Lorries (or \\"trucks\\" in American parlance) were then just beginning to supplant human porters as the main means of moving freight in Nyasaland. During the Second World War he drove lorries carrying goods (some of them illicit) between Blantyre and Salisbury, the capital of Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). After the war, together with another Yao lorry driver, Lali Lubani, he founded the Nyasaland African Drivers Association. He recruited drivers and mechanics from Conforzi's Tea and Tobacco company in Cholo (or Thyolo) where they had recently participated in a strike, as well as from Tobacco Auctions, local garages and from the recently formed national bus service, Nyasaland Transport Company. There was an entry fee of five shillings and annual dues of 12 shillings, a rate high enough to discourage unskilled applicants. Makata and Lubani affiliated this organization with the politically active Nyasaland African Congress (fore- runner of the Malawi Congress Party which became the only legal political party after Malawi became a republic in 1966). At the NAC's fourth annual meeting in September 1947, Lubani called on the government to introduce a minimum wage for lorry drivers. In 1948, they changed the name to the Nyasaland African Workers Association and in 1949 registered it as the country's first official trade union. By 1957, the Association had a membership of 255. Business Success In 1948, while still secretary of the Association, Makata bought a lorry which he used to transport and sell firewood in Blantyre. Within a short time, he had grown this into a general trucking business with five lorries. In 1951, along with Lali Lubani and Hartwell Solomon, another African entrepreneur, he contributed free labour, transport and bricks to Mikeka Mkandawire who was constructing buildings without permits in Chichiri in protest against a town plan which seemed designed to clear the area, designated as African Trust Land, of low-income (i.e. African) residents. By 1952, Makata's businesses had expanded to include maize machines, a brick-making operation, a timber business and a bus and taxi service. Later, Makata & Sons Ltd. added five milling machines, a garage and a bar in Lilongwe. In 1953, with businesses now worth thousands of pounds, he created an African Chamber of Commerce along with other African entrepreneurs. Political Influence During this time, Makata also developed ties of patronage with Blantyre's urban poor by providing credit and making his lorries available for funerals. He sponsored a primary school in Ndirande and provided a bus service to areas where the European-operated service was absent. He took responsibility for the housing, health and general welfare of his employees, both kin and non-kin. He revived the moribund Ndirande Welfare Club, which became a focal point for African political activity. In August 1958, along with Lubani, he became a member of the Executive Committee of the Nyasaland African Congress. According to John McCracken (Blantyre Transformed): For example, in January 1959, Makata and Lubani provided lorries to transport attendants to and from the so-called secret meeting at which an alleged \\"massacre plot\\" against Europeans had been discussed. On March 3, 1959, he was detained and interned in Kanjedza Camp, along with hundreds of others, in a massive nationwide swoop which became known as Operation Sunrise. His businesses suffered severely during the ten months of his detention. He was released, along with Hastings Banda and many others, in April 1960. Banda arrogated to himself the power to appoint all Malawi Congress Party (MCP – successor organization to the Nyasaland African Congress) candidates running in the parliamentary elections to be held in August 1961. He did not appoint Makata or Lubani, allegedly because he regarded them as having too little education. (According to one story, Banda, who was always immaculately dressed, took exception to Makata wearing a torn shirt and wrote him a check suggesting he go and buy a new one—see Power, Building Kwacha, p. 290). This was in contrast to several \\"Northerners\\", young, educated men, who were prominent in the MCP. By October 1961, after the new government led by Banda had been sworn in, Makata along with Lubani, Sydney Somanje and Willie Chokani are said to have founded a rival, southern-based bloc. Death Makata died in April 1962 at the Mchinji turn-off in Lilongwe when his car crashed after he and two friends had been celebrating at Kwacha Cultural Centre in Blantyre where they had reportedly been drinking heavily.

It was designed by Alfred Barton Brady and built in 1896 by Arthur Midson. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 August 1992.  History  The Victoria Bridge Abutment is the remnant of the fourth Victoria Bridge (the second permanent bridge) to cross the Brisbane River at this point. Constructed in 1896 to a design by A B Brady, Queensland Government Architect, the bridge was constructed of iron, with stone abutments at each end. The stonework was undertaken by Arthur Midson and the ironwork by Messrs Cormick. The abutment comprises a large masonry podium supporting a section of road and a sawn stone rusticated arch with composite neoclassical ornament. A marble memorial tablet is fixed to the southern side of the arch to commemorate an eleven-year-old Greek Australian child, Hector Vasyli, who was accidentally killed on the site in 1918 while welcoming returning soldiers. The decision to retain this portion of the bridge was a combination of the desire to retain an example of the stonework associated with the earlier bridge, and as a result of consultation with the Greek Community who wished to maintain an appropriate location for the memorial plaque for Hector Vasyli. The 1896 bridge was the fourth structure to cross the Brisbane River at this point. The first, built from timber in 1865, was closed only two years later due to excessive damage caused by marine borers. A permanent structure was commenced in 1864, but was not completed until 1874 when it was opened by the Queensland Governor who named Victoria Bridge for the ruling British sovereign, Queen Victoria. Operating as a toll bridge until 1877 it was destroyed in the February 1893 floods. A further temporary bridge was erected by September 1893 but was again destroyed by flooding in 1896. By this time, however, the second permanent bridge was nearing completion. On 30 September 1896 the \\"downstream half\\" of the second permanent Victoria Bridge was \\"opened without ceremony\\".A.B. Brady, 1901 On 22 June 1897 (Diamond Jubilee Day) the second permanent Victoria Bridge was opened for traffic, including trams. The opening of the first permanent Victoria Bridge in 1874 provided an important transport and communications link between the north and south banks of the river and provided further impetus to the development of the south bank. In the 1880s the south bank experienced a development boom. The South Brisbane Dry Dock was opened in 1881, coal wharves at Woolloongabba and associated rail links were established in circa 1885, and South Brisbane railway station was established as the passenger terminus for suburban and country train lines built during the 1880s. Industry and commerce was attracted to the area, and Stanley Street developed into a major retail centre and thoroughfare. The spread of housing included the development of large residences located along the ridges with views of the river and industry developed along the southern bank of Milton Reach. South Brisbane Municipality was established in 1888. The development of the civic centre focussed on the Stanley and Vulture Street intersection and included the South Brisbane Town Hall, Post Office, Fire Station and South Brisbane railway station. A swinging span was designed to permit the passage of tall-masted ships; however even at that stage such vessels were becoming increasingly scarce and much of the up-river traffic was the lower motorised vessels. Following the introduction of tram services to South Brisbane, this \\"swinging girder\\" was closed permanently to permit the laying of tracks. The boom of the 1880s collapsed, following maritime and pastoral strikes in the early 1890s and the collapse of banks in 1893. A series of floods in 1893 resulted in the collapse of the Victoria Bridge which cut vital transport and communications links with the central city. Urban expansion continued following the opening of the new Victoria Bridge in 1897 and was further supported by the introduction of electric trams. The significance of the Victoria Bridge to the commercial development of the south side of the river is best demonstrated in two anecdotes relating to human nature. At the opening of the bridge in 1897 both North and South Brisbane demanded that they have a ceremony to celebrate this significant event. The ceremony therefore required a formal opening on the north side, following which the party of dignitaries proceeded to cross the bridge to the southern bank. Here another ceremony was held and the procession then crossed the river once more to be met with refreshments on the north bank. The second story relates to a Commemoration Day prank perpetrated by university students in the early 1930s. Early one morning they installed a sign at each end of the bridge indicating that the bridge was closed to traffic. Police arriving on the scene took the signs at face value and proceeded to prevent vehicular traffic from using the bridge for most of the day. It was not until someone thought to check with the appropriate authorities that it was discovered that the signs were placed in position as a joke. As a consequence of this prank commerce on either side of the river was considerably disrupted and the university students were severely reprimanded for their actions. Victoria Bridge The design of the bridge caused much comment, due to the impressive stone arches flanking the approaches and the manner in which the engineers had addressed the various problems presented by the site. The river banks were at two different levels, presenting a design challenge which was competently met by Brady. The gentle slope of the decking from the higher north bank down to the southern abutment was imperceptible to the eye. The cylindrical iron pillars which supported the span across the river were slightly tapered above normal water level. The metal material was \\"imported from Great Britain\\" and mostly (wrought and cast iron - practically everything: structure in full and superstructure all \\"except the cast - steel bearings\\") \\"manufactured\\" in situ, \\"in Queensland\\". As per the other construction materials - wood and stone - the bridge was built with local ones (with the only possible exception of the Oregon pine of the main girders).\\"Portrait of a Bridge. Ephemeral silhouettes of Brisbane's Victoria Bridge\\" by Daria Gomez Gane 2007 The builders worked at great depths under water and some suffered from the bends with one casualty. Divided carriageway, 1906 The bridge provided a divided carriageway for traffic, with two lanes operating in each direction. The central dividing structure echoed the form of the sides of the bridge, consisting of a series of metal lattice framed hog- backs. Each end of the central divider was marked with a rusticated stone pilaster topped with an ornate gas light. The sides of the bridge were also enclosed in lattice trussing. Each end of the bridge was provided with stone pillars at the river bank and, at the point of entry, stone arches spanned the pedestrian walkways. Pedestrian footways were provided either side of the main decking. Until the 1930s the Victoria Bridge remained the only permanent crossing point between the north and south banks of the Brisbane River within Brisbane. By 1926 the bottleneck caused by the increased volume of traffic attempting to use the only river crossing in the city led to the establishment of a commission to explore alternative sites for bridges. After consideration of a number of factors such as flooding, navigation and level of demand, the William Jolly Bridge was constructed, followed by the Walter Taylor Bridge at Indooroopilly which functioned as a toll bridge from its opening in 1936. The Story Bridge was not opened until 1940 due to pressures against the construction of a down-river bridge which had the potential to limit shipping to the city wharves. In 1918, during the celebrations marking the end of World War I and the return of the soldiers from the front, an incident occurred that touched the heart of the public and led to the provision of a memorial tablet on the southern end of the bridge. An 11-year-old child, Hector Vasyli, of Greek ancestry, was struck by one of the vehicles in the parade and killed. A marble tablet was erected to his memory and a memorial service has been held at the site on Anzac Day ever since. In 1969 when the bridge was being demolished, to be replaced by the present structure, the memorial tablet was removed for safekeeping until a suitable location was found for it. Discussion with the Greek Community and Brisbane City Council led to the decision to retain that portion of the abutment which had originally held the memorial tablet and so it was returned to its original location on 24 April 1970. During storage the bronze relief head of the boy which decorated the tablet was lost. The Greek Consul, Mr Alex Freeleagus located the boys' sister in Sydney and she provided a photograph of the boy from which a replacement likeness was cast. The bridge abutment was left as a ruin for some time following the demolition of the bridge, photographs taken in 1971 show that it was still in a ruined state at that time. Restoration work is reported as having been undertaken as a part of the revivification of the south bank area in preparation for the World Expo 88 which was held at South Bank Parklands. At that time two bronze plaques were attached to the side of the abutment recording the history of the bridge.  Description  Architectural plans of cylinders & bracings to piers, 1893 Architectural plans of abutments, fencing, lamps, archway etc, 1893 The Victoria Bridge Abutment stands on the southern side of the Brisbane River downstream of the existing Victoria bridge. It consists of a large stone podium with rock-faced ashlar facing. The upriver side is faced with polygonal masonry, indicating that it is newer stonework. The podium is capped with the downstream arch of the southern abutment, together with a section of roadway which retains the tracks of the tramway. The entry to each pedestrian footway was defined with a rusticated arch of sawn stone which combines both Classical and Egyptian vocabularies. The pylons supporting the arch are tapered towards the base of the arch from which they continue as attached pilasters with parallel sides. The arch springs from a cornice at the top of the tapered portion of the supporting pylons. Above the arch a cornice defines the base of a Doric frieze which continues around the tops of the attached pilasters. The entablature is topped with another cornice. Either side of the arch a granite tablet is applied which supports ornate metal brackets which held gas lamps to illuminate the entry to the bridge. A similar tablet is located on the sides of the structure at the same level. The three lowest courses have been treated with a \\"rockfaced\\" surface. The outer pylon of the arch is continued to the base of the abutment as a low profile pilaster with a rock-faced surface. Hector Vasyli Memorial At the centre of the arch, galvanised piping projects and a section hangs parallel with the face of the structure. A marble tablet is applied to the landward side of the up-river pylon below the lowest cornice, commemorating Hector Vasyli. The tablet is in the form of an aedicule in the Corinthian style. The inscription on the entablature reads: \\"EVERY LAND IS HIS NATIVE LAND TO A BRAVE MAN\\" The Corinthian columns frame a tondo beneath which the inscription continues. The tondo contains a bronze relief portrait of the boy facing outward. Below this lies the body of the inscription. The inscription reads: > NEAR THIS SPOT AS THE RESULT OF A LAMENTABLE ACCIDENT, WHILST WELCOMING > RETURNED SOLDIERS HECTOR VASYLI WAS KILLED 9TH JUNE 1918 AGED 11 YEARS. > DURING HIS BRIEF SOJOURN ON EARTH, HE DEVOTED MUCH OF HIS TIME TO PATRIOTIC > WORK FOR AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS DURING THE GREAT EUROPEAN WAR. IN HIS VEINS RAN > THE HEROIC BLOOD OF GREECE, AND IN THE BREAST OF A CHILD HE CARRIED THE > HEART OF A MAN. THIS TABLET WAS ERECTED BY THE RETURNED SAILORS, AND > SOLDIERS IMPERIAL LEAGUE, HELLENIC (GREEK) ASSOCIATION AND CITIZENS OF > BRISBANE The stylobate is supported on two brackets of marble. Below the tablet two rows of metal hooks are attached to the stonework. These may be intended for the support of commemorative wreaths relating to the Anzac Day memorial services. Off centre from the entrance to the arch, a metal bollard remains in situ. Upriver from the arch a section of roadway remains, bearing sections of tramline. Between the two sets of tracks the remains of a low concrete platform with a rounded end has been left in situ. The surface to the landward side of this platform retains painted chevron markings. On the downriver side a low stone wall curves out, terminating in a low pilaster which defines the entry point for the bridge. The area is paved in bitumen. Metal brackets are attached to the stonework of the pylons, the centre of the arch and on the top of the outer pilaster; fittings for a gas illumination. Curved stone kerbing defines the footpath from the road way. The white marble memorial tablet is situated on the landward side of the up-river pylon of the arch. The abutment is isolated from its original context as the approach road and bridge decking are no longer in place. Additional stabilising footings and retaining works have been constructed to maintain the abutment in its present location. All the stonework below the road level is done in rock-cut masonry. Other additions include a white safety railing around the perimeter which matches the railing of the neighbouring bridge, and a flight of metal and concrete stairs to permit access to the platform of the abutment. Two bronze plaques have been applied to the stonework, one at each landing of the stairway. The inscriptions show a number of inaccuracies, however are transcribed below: Plaque, ground level, 2013 Plaque one - ground level \\"This plaque marks the site of the southern approach to the second Victoria Bridge, completed in 1897 at a cost of £125,000 to replace the bridge destroyed by floods in 1896. When the bridge was demolished in 1969, following the completion of the present bridge, this section was retained as a memorial to the endeavour of successive generations of Brisbane's citizens to provide swift means of cross-river transport.\\" Plaque two - first landing \\"This stonework is all that remains of the first permanent bridge to span the Brisbane River. A temporary wooden structure was erected in 1865 as staging for the permanent bridge, but was closed to traffic from Nov 1897 as a result of flood damage. On the 15th June 1874 the new bridge was opened and named Victoria Bridge. The northern section of the Victoria Bridge collapsed on 6 February 1893 under pressure from debris during the disastrous flood of that year.\\"  Heritage listing  Former Victoria Bridge Abutment was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 August 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Victoria Bridge Abutment stands as a memorial of the first permanent bridge to be constructed across the Brisbane River which did not succumb to the forces of nature. The opening of the bridge in 1897 provided a major boost to the continued development of the City of South Brisbane which had first received its development impetus from the introduction of cross-river transport provided by the previous bridges at this location. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. The manner of the design reflects the aesthetic values of Brisbane's early public structures and provides information regarding the manner in which the engineering challenges of the site were addressed. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The manner of the design reflects the aesthetic values of Brisbane's early public structures and provides information regarding the manner in which the engineering challenges of the site were addressed. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Victoria Bridge Abutment has a high social value for the Greek community of Brisbane, containing as it does, the memorial to Hector Vasyli, a young Greek Australian boy who died while demonstrating his loyalty to his adopted homeland. This association is further demonstrated by the role of the Greek community in ensuring that this portion of the bridge was retained to provide a fitting location for the memorial plaque erected in the memory of the Vasyli boy and the continued practice of conducting a memorial service for the boy each Anzac Day. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The elegance of this remaining portion serves as a reminder of the grace and style of the substantial structure designed by A B Brady, Government Architect.

This was replaced by a purpose-built facility at Batt's Corner known as Fiveways Hospital in 1872. This was, in turn, replaced by an improved facility in Bide's Gardens which was designed by Paul Waterhouse and officially opened as Yeovil General Hospital by the Prince of Wales on 19 July 1923. It joined the National Health Service in 1948. The current facility was designed by Sir Percy Thomas & Son and construction started in Higher Kingston in 1968. It was officially opened by the Duke of Kent on 15 October 1973. It was refurbished, creating a new coronary care unit, intensive care unit and private patient ward at a cost of £9.3 million, in 2000. A 24-bed extension was completed in April 2016.

It contains the majority of the commercial development of the original Perry townsite. The district contains 132 buildings, (including the First National Bank and Trust Company Building, the Noble County Courthouse, and the Wolleson-Nicewander Building, previously listed on the National Register of Historic Places), 92 contributing resources, and 37 noncontributing resources. Its period of significance is given as 1893 to 1953. The period begins with the Land Run of 1893.The District was added to the National Register of Historic Places under Criteria A and C on September 2, 2003. The NRIS reference number is 03000881. Description The PCSHD is in downtown Perry, Oklahoma. Most of the downtown is included in the District. It is bounded by Birch, Elm, Sixth and Seventh Streets. Birch, Flynn, Elm and Gene Taylor are streets within the district which still retain their original brick paving. All other streets in the district have been paved more recently with asphalt According to the NRHP application, the parts excluded from the District have been altered so much as to disrupt the look and feel of the original area. National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) list The District still retains about 72 percent of its commercial architecture that was built during its Period of Significance. This strong retention qualifies the District under Criterion C. Many of the commercial buildings were built in the Plains Commercial and Territorial styles. The NRHP application notes that the Central Square (the area containing the Courthouse, post office and land office) also supports Criterion C. This area was named \\"Government Acre,\\" and was laid out by Hoke Smith, Secretary of the Interior under President Grover Cleveland. History Perry became a beehive of activity after noon on September 16, 1893. The scene was almost chaotic as an estimated 25,000 people crowded into town on the first night. The original size of the townsite was long from east to west and . It contained the land office for this run. Prospective settlers needed to register their claims at the land office (located in a wooden courthouse), as soon as possible. People who intended to live and work in the town immediately threw up tents, some of which would remain in place for several years. Gradually, the tents were replaced by wooden buildings with false fronts. The Globe Building, built in 1894, was the first permanent building in Perry. The Globe housed a mercantile general store. It was of Late Victorian commercial style architecture. Government Acre The area on the eastern end of the townsite was designated as \\"Government Acre\\". It would eventually contain the Noble County Courthouse, the Carnegie Library, the Post Office and the city's Central Park. The Land Office was relocated immediately east of Government Acre. Another area east of Government Acre was called \\"Hell's Half Acre,\\" because it contained most of the saloons and dance halls. After squatters were driven off, Government Acre was a dusty lot in the center of town, occupied only by the small wooden Post Office building. In 1895, the ground was planted with alfalfa to hold down the sand and dust.\\"Noble County Courthouse - Perry, OK - Courthouses on Waymarking.com\\" August 18, 2010. Accessed November 23, 2016 Will T. Little, a local nature lover, got permission from the county commissioners in 1896, to plant elm tree seedlings on Government Acre. He planted 8,600 seedlings, each 6 to 8 inches long. They obviously thrived, because enough trees were sold from this crop to repay the cost of planting. The rest were left in place to adorn the courthouse lawn in memory of Mr. Little. Although the county needed a central government office as soon as it was formed, there were no funds to build a courthouse. A lumber company, T. M. Richardson & Sons, Inc., constructed a two-story wooden building on the east side of the property to serve this purpose. The donated building served well for twenty years, when the county voters passed a $100,000 bond issue to construct the present Noble County Courthouse, which is now listed on the National Register of Historic Properties.

Career Santiz worked as a reporter for more than 30 years and, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, “was well-known in Guatemala.” During the last 15 years of his life he covered “the police beat.” At the time of his death, he was a reporter for the news program “Telecentro Trece” on the national television station Telecentro 13, on which he often covered graphic crime stories. Santiz was also a volunteer firefighter. Murder  Santiz and his cameraman, Juan Antonio de León Villatoro, were driving in a company-owned vehicle at around 5:10 pm on April 1, 2009. They had just been covering the murder of a suburban bus driver in Alameda IV colony, Zone 18, and were heading back to their workplace in Guatemala City when two people riding motorcycles shot at them repeatedly. The assault took place at 4th Avenue and 20th Street in Zone 1 of the capital city. Santiz was struck four times and killed; de León Villatoro was struck three times and wounded. The murderers, who were later described as “two hired thugs,” “shot at the car repeatedly, killing Santiz immediately and injuring de León in the head, jaw, and chest.” Santiz was pronounced dead at the scene. De León was taken to the Hospital General San Juan de Dios, where he was reported as being in stable condition. He was put into protective custody. Santiz was 52 years old when he died. He had told his colleagues about receiving death threats, but it was not clear whether the threats were linked to a specific story. La Federación Latinoamericana de Periodistas (FELAP) condemned the murder of Santiz. The Committee to Protect Journalists called on Guatemalan authorities to conduct an immediate and thorough investigation into the crime. “We are saddened by the death of Rolando Santiz and send our condolences to his friends and family,” said Robert Mahoney, CPJ's deputy director. “Guatemalan authorities must ensure that the investigation into Santiz's killing is thorough and provide Antonio de León with the ongoing necessary protection to assure that he is able to continue working as a journalist.” Ileana Alamilla, the coordinator of CERIGUA's Journalist's Observatory (Observatorio de los Periodistas), called for the perpetrators to be arrested and punished. According to IFEX, “Alamilla said that journalists no longer believe in the promises of upper level authorities or in security plans proposed by the government. Journalists are demanding concrete actions to stop the violence inherent in the environment in which they work every day.” Similarly, the vice president of the Inter American Press Association (IAPA), Gonzalo Marroquín, “demanded that the authorities investigate the crime to end the impunity that so often prevails in these types of cases.” “Hundreds of people, including politicians, union members, journalists, firefighters and citizens, congregated at the funeral home in Guatemala's capital city where the journalist's body was taken in order to offer their condolences to Santiz's wife, Lorena Ramírez,” stated IFEX, which noted that Ramírez's father, Héctor Ramírez, known as “Reporter X,” had been killed in violent protests in 2003. On June 8, 2009, the Committee to Protect Journalists reported that Guatemalan authorities had not made public any leads in the case. In January 2010, the CPJ also reported that the motive for the murder still remained “unconfirmed.” 2009 was Guatemala's most violent year in recent history, with 6,451 homicide victims, including several journalists. “After Rolando Santiz was assassinated, attacks against journalists have increased,” Raúl Morales, a journalist with Radio Sonora, said in April 2010. “When I leave my house, I look all around to be sure there is no one around me.” Gonzalo Marroquín, vice president of the Inter-American Press Association and director of the Guatemalan daily newspaper Prensa Libre, said that the situation had become so dangerous that journalism in Guatemala was on the way to extinction.

In December 2014 documentary won the DOC Wine Travel Food Prize 2014, for the best film on wine and food themes. The film depicts the last thirty years of technical innovations and changes in the story of Barolo, a red wine produced from Nebbiolo grapes, almost unknown until the 1970s (apart from its land of origin, an area of 11 communes in the Langhe) and now considered one of the best red wines in the world. This is partly due to the work and innovations of the Barolo Boys, or Modernists, who introduced a series of technical innovations in the world of Italian wine. The film focuses on these innovations, and the contrasts that derived from these changes, but also depicts the friendship and spirit of the group behind these producers and their success.

Only one was built, development ceasing when funding ran out. Design and development Louis Bréguet designed his first helicopter, the Bréguet-Richet Gyroplane, in 1908 but his 1935 Gyroplane Laboratoire was much more successful. It had no tail rotor but instead had co-axial contra-rotating rotors. After World War II Bréguet was approached by the Société Francaises du Gyroplane (SFG, ) for a helicopter capable of carrying several passengers. Bréguet developed his wartime studies of a project named the G.34 into the two-passenger Bréguet G.11E, otherwise known as the Société Francaises du Gyroplane G.11E. Though a much larger aircraft, the G.11E used the same coaxial, three blade twin rotor layout as on the Gyroplane Laboratoire. It was initially powered by a fan cooled Potez 9E nine cylinder radial engine mounted amidships, under the concentric rotor shafts. There was 6.5:1 speed reduction gearing between the engine and the rotor drive. The rotors are built around tapered tube spars, which carry ribs and are Dural clad at the leading edges and with alloy over 3-ply elsewhere. They are mounted on flapping hinges and have drag hinge dampers. The control column alters cyclic pitch via a pair of swashplates and pedals make torque corrections and control yaw by changing the relative collective pitch of the two rotors. A mechanical inertial governor limited rotor accelerations; the pilot could increase the collective pitch over that set by the governor but not below it, emergencies apart. The G.11E's fuselage has a tapered, oval section. The forward part is a light alloy monocoque containing the well glazed cockpit, accessed by two sliding doors. The rear fuselage is a steel tube structure, covered in fabric, bearing a tall T-tail with a moving, one-piece tailplane which corrected the cyclic pitch via the control column to prevent once per revolution pitch oscillations. A wide track undercarriage has main wheels mounted on horizontal V-struts from the fuselage bottom and with a single bracing strut to the mid-fuselage on each side. The first flight was made on 21 May 1949 but tests showed that the G.11E was underpowered, so a decision was made to replace the Potez engine with a bigger nine-cylinder radial, a Pratt & Whitney Wasp Junior. The type name was changed to G.111 and some re-design accompanied the power increase; the rotor diameter was increased by and the fuselage lengthened by to include two more seats so that four passengers could be carried. Empty and maximum weights increased to and respectively. The G.111 began flight tests in 1951 but these were not completed as SFG were declared bankrupt the following year.

It was located just downstream of the Carmel River and San Clemente Creek confluence. Completed in 1921 to supply water to the Monterey Peninsula, the dam was removed in November 2015 due to safety and environmental concerns. Background The San Clemente Dam was implemented by Samuel Morse, owner of the Del Monte Properties Company, in order to supply municipal water to the growing population on the Monterey Peninsula. It would replace the Old Carmel River Dam which was built just downstream in 1883. At a cost of US$300,000, the arch dam was designed by J.A. Wilcox and constructed by Chadwick & Sykes Inc of San Francisco from 1918 to 1921. About of concrete was used in its construction. A fish ladder was constructed on the dam shortly after its completion. In 1930 Morse sold the dam to Chester Loveland, owner of the California Water and Telephone Company (CWTC). In 1966 California American Water (CAW) purchased CWTC and acquired the dam for US$42 million. Removal The dam's reservoir originally had a storage capacity of , but over of sediment built up over the years, leaving the water storage capacity at by 2008. Due to the threat sediment build-up poses to a dam and that the location of the dam is near a fault line, in 1991 the California Department of Water Resources (CDWR) issued a warning of potential dam failure and sought alternatives. In 1992, CAW was required to upgrade the dam for safety which, along with an annual drawdown in reservoir levels, included a US$1 million project which drilled holes in the face of the dam to relieve hydrostatic pressure. In February 2008, the CDWR approved a plan to reroute the Carmel River and demolish the dam. It became known as the Carmel River Reroute & San Clemente Dam plan. An agreement was reached with CAW in 2010 to implement this option. The project includes rerouting the Carmel River upstream of the dam through a half-mile-long channel into San Clemente Creek, which contains the least amount of sediment. The Carmel River currently contains most of the sediment and the section between the reroute and immediately upstream of the dam will be a permanent holding area since it was determined there is no feasible way to remove all of the sediment. About of sediment will also have to be excavated from San Clemente Creek to the permanent holding area on the Carmel River. Once the sediment is secure, the San Clemente Dam and Old Carmel River Dam will be completely removed. Construction began in 2013 and the Carmel River was diverted by December 2014. By November 2015 the San Clemente Dam was removed. The Carmel River Dam removal and project completion is slated for 2016. The project will cost US$84 million. $49 million is being provided by CAW, US$25 million by the State of California and the remaining by Federal and other funding. Other benefits from removing the dam include freeing up of the river for rainbow trout migration and to improve the California red-legged frog habitat.

He is the current head football coach at the Minnesota State University, Mankato, a position he held from 2008 to 2011 and resumed in 2014. Hoffner was the head football coach at the University of Wisconsin–Eau Claire from 1999 to 2005. He was an assistant football coach at University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point from 1991 to 1998 and served as the offensive coordinator at the University of South Dakota from 2006 to 2007. Hoffner played college football and ran track at Valley City State University, from which he graduated in 1989. He is a native of Esmond, North Dakota. In August 2012 Hoffner was charged by local authorities after a staff member at Minnesota State discovered videos of his naked children on a cell phone that was issued to Hoffner by the university. Hoffner was removed from his position as head football coach and placed on administrative leave. The charges were dismissed in December 2012. The judge who dismissed the charges ruled that the videos of the children amounted to nothing more than them acting silly after a bath. Hoffner was later fired by Minnesota State. In January 2014, he was hired by Minot State University to serve as their head football coach. In April 2014, Hoffner was reinstated in his position at Minnesota State after an arbitrator ruled in his favor. Minnesota State destroyed notes from its controversial investigation of Hoffner, and the Minnesota legislative auditor’s office meanwhile said it was “surprised” that the school’s investigator, an affirmative action officer, “destroyed her contemporaneous interview notes” when she conducted an investigation for Richard Davenport, the college's president. The school's investigator conducted flawed interviews in which questioning was not recorded or conducted under oath. Hoffner received Division II Region 5 Coach of the Year honors in December 2014 from the American Football Coaches Association. Under Hoffner's guidance in 2014, the Minnesota State University Mavericks won their second consecutive NSIC Championship.

Strong and destructive tornadoes form most frequently in the United States, Bangladesh, Brazil and Eastern India, but they can occur almost anywhere under the right conditions. Tornadoes also develop occasionally in southern Canada during the Northern Hemisphere's summer and somewhat regularly at other times of the year across Europe, Asia, and Australia. Tornadic events are often accompanied with other forms of severe weather including strong thunderstorms, winds and hail. There were 1,265 tornadoes reported in the United States in 2015 according to the Storm Prediction Center (SPC), of which at least 1,178 have been confirmed. Worldwide, 109 fatalities have been reported: 45 in Pakistan, 36 in the United States, 14 in Mexico, seven in China, three in Myanmar, two in Brazil and one each in Italy and Russia. 2015 ended the very quiet trend of the 2012, 2013 and 2014 seasons, and was the most active in four years. Synopsis Throughout much of the first half of 2015, tornado activity was near record low mostly due to a continuous pattern of a trough in the east, which brought colder than average temperatures there, and a ridge in the west, which brought warmer than average temperatures in the west. The pattern changed, slightly, in late March and early April to allow for some severe weather. During May, a few large tornado outbreaks occurred, which led it to be the most active tornado month since April 2011, and the most active May since 2008. Due to a significant El Niño event, November and December were extremely active months with over 20 fatalities in December alone. 93 tornadoes were reported in December, well above average for that month. Furthermore, 2015 was the first year since 2011 to see a total of more than 1,000 tornadoes across the United States. In synopsis, 2015 was the first average or above average year in terms of the number of tornadoes since 2011. Events United States yearly total Final totals through December 31 January There were 32 tornadoes reported in the U.S. in January, of which 27 were confirmed. January 3–4 On January 1, the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) began highlighting the potential for severe weather across portions of the central Gulf Coast and lower Mississippi Valley. The following day, the pre-existing Marginal risk was upgraded to a Slight risk across southeastern Louisiana, southeastern Mississippi, and southwestern Alabama. On January 3, the combination of high dewpoints, marginal instability, and strong wind shear allowed for the development of supercells across central and southern Mississippi, where an Enhanced risk was briefly introduced. An EF2 tornado touched down west of Rose Hill, Mississippi, causing significant damage, while several other tornadoes were recorded. Activity spread eastward on January 4, with a second EF2 tornado causing substantial damage north of Dozier, Alabama. February There were 2 tornadoes reported in the U.S. in February, both of which were confirmed. March There were 13 tornadoes reported in the U.S. in March, of which 11 were confirmed. March 24–25 A double-wide mobile home destroyed by an EF2 tornado in alt=An image depicting the remains of a destroyed double-wide mobile home in Sand Springs, Oklhoma. Early on March 24, the SPC outlined an Enhanced risk for severe weather across portions of southwestern Missouri, northwestern Arkansas, and northeastern Oklahoma, where conditions were expected to become favorable for strong supercells. That afternoon, a waterspout over Bull Shoals Lake moved ashore as an EF0 tornado but caused no damage. Numerous reports of damaging winds and hail were relayed. On March 25, a more substantial severe weather risk evolved across southwestern Missouri, northwestern Arkansas, and northeastern Oklahoma, where the SPC outlined the year's first Moderate risk. At 22:21 UTC, a waterspout spawned over Keystone Lake and moved through Sand Springs, Oklahoma, causing EF2 damage in a mobile home park where one fatality and 30 injuries were observed. At 23:34 UTC, a second EF2 tornado developed and tracked through southwestern Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, before entering Moore. Several structures sustained substantial damage, and several cars were flipped and overturned on Interstate 35. Several other weak tornadoes touched down in adjacent states as well. April There were 185 tornadoes reported in the U.S. in April, of which 171 were confirmed. April 2 (India) On April 2, a tornado of unknown strength struck the city of Bikaner in Rajasthan, India. At least 50 families were displaced by the storm. April 2–3 On April 2, upper-level southwesterly flow overspread the Ozarks and Ohio River Valley, where an Enhanced risk for severe weather was introduced by the SPC. A surface low tracked into Ontario, supporting a cold front down into southern Missouri. Throughout the afternoon hours, a shortwave trough tracked across the Central Plains, providing ample lift for the development of severe thunderstorms. Several weak tornadoes were recorded. On April 3, the Enhanced risk shifted southeast, encompassing portions of Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, and Alabama. An EF2 tornado tracked north of Pomona, Missouri, in the pre-dawn hours, damaging or destroying several buildings. Several tornadoes of lesser intensity were observed farther east. April 6 (Myanmar) On April 6, three people were killed and five others were injured when a tornado struck two villages within Phakant, Kachin State, Myanmar. April 8–9 High-end EF4 wedge tornado near Rochelle, Illinois on April 9. A two-day severe weather episode affected parts of the Great Plains and Midwestern United States. Several EF0 tornadoes occurred on April 8 in the south central part of Kansas, including some to the northwest of Wichita, Kansas, near the towns of Garden Plain and Andale. An EF1 tornado caused moderate damage as it struck the town of Potosi, Missouri, that evening as well. Several tornadoes were also reported from Texas to Illinois on April 9. A multiple-vortex EF1 tornado struck the towns of Clinton, Iowa, and Fulton, Illinois, and an EF2 tornado near Mount Selman, Texas snapped and uprooted numerous trees, damaged outbuildings, and removed the roof and collapsed a few exterior walls at a frame home. The most significant event of the outbreak was a violent, long- tracked, very high-end EF4 wedge tornado that moved along a 30.14 mile-long path across several counties in northern Illinois, killing two people and injuring another 22. An EF0 satellite tornado also caused major damage to outbuildings at the Summerfield Zoo near Belvidere, where two animals were killed. Two other EF1 tornadoes from the same parent supercell also occurred near Belvidere after the main EF4 dissipated, causing mostly minor damage, though one home lost most of its roof. Another tornado spawned by a separate supercell passed near Cherry Valley, though it remained over open country and caused no damage. Overall, this relatively small outbreak produced 2 fatalities and 24 tornadoes. April 20 (Brazil) A long-tracked, rain- wrapped F3 wedge tornado spawned by a supercell thunderstorm struck the city of Xanxerê, Santa Catarina in Brazil during the afternoon of April 20. Approximately 500 homes were damaged in the city, many of which lost their roofs and some were destroyed. Many trees and power lines were downed, trees were snapped and debarked, and industrial buildings sustained major damage as well. Two people lost their lives. Additionally, 120 people were injured, 15 critically. The meteorological consulting agency MetSul Meteorologia stated it was one of the largest tornadoes ever recorded in Brazil. Roughly 1,000 people were forced out of their homes due to the storm. The city of Ponte Serrada was struck by an F1 tornado on the same day. May There were 414 tornadoes reported in the U.S. in May, of which 383 were confirmed. May 5 (Germany) An F3 tornado hit the German town of Bützow, Mecklenburg- Vorpommern, causing major structural damage, littering streets with debris, and flipping vehicles. One car was reportedly thrown 70 meters by the tornado. Video evidence showed that the town was hit by a multiple-vortex, wedge tornado. Moreover, straight-line thunderstorm winds killed one person and injured 30 others in Hamburg. This event followed an episode of unusually warm weather in the area. May 5–10 EF3 damage to a house in Van, Texas. A six-day outbreak of tornadic activity began on May 5 with isolated tornadoes in western Texas. More widespread and significant activity occurred on May 6\\\\. Much of central Oklahoma experienced tornadoes, and the town of Bridge Creek sustained major impacts from a large EF3 tornado, where several businesses and homes were heavily damaged or destroyed. Another EF3 tornado caused major damage in southwestern parts of Oklahoma City, just north of Valley Brook, where a hotel, several self-storage units, a mobile home park, and an RV park were heavily damaged, numerous vehicles were flipped, and at least 12 people were injured. Large, strong tornadoes, including two EF3 tornadoes, severely damaged or completely destroyed rural homes near the Kansas towns of Mount Hope, Scandia, and Munden. Several additional less intense tornadoes occurred on May 7 and May 8 across an area extending from Colorado to Texas. Another wave of significant tornado activity occurred on May 9 throughout an area extending from Nebraska to Texas. This included a large EF3 tornado that caused major damage and killed one person near Cisco, Texas. Destructive tornado activity continued on May 10, as a high-end EF2 tornado struck the town of Delmont, South Dakota, where severe structural damage and injuries occurred. Later that evening, a multiple-vortex EF1 tornado struck Lake City, Iowa, where homes were damaged, trees and power lines were downed, and the local high school had its roof torn off. Significant tornadoes continued to touch down after sunset later that night, and the town of Van, Texas, was devastated by a strong EF3 tornado, where two people were killed and 47 others were injured. Two other fatalities occurred in Nashville, Arkansas, when an EF2 tornado struck a mobile home park. A total of 127 tornadoes were confirmed and rated as a result of this outbreak sequence. May 13–14 (Germany) One F3 tornado which caused severe damage to many well-built brick buildings was confirmed in the district of Aichach-Friedberg north of Augsburg, Bavaria. Two more tornadoes were confirmed in the southern part of the Black Forest, Baden- Württemberg. May 16–17 A two-day tornado outbreak affected the Great Plains states beginning on May 16. Most of these tornadoes were weak, though a few significant tornadoes occurred, including a large and long-lived multiple- vortex wedge tornado that tracked from near Chillicothe, Texas, to near Snyder, Oklahoma, causing significant damage to farming equipment, trees, and a few structures along its path. The tornado was caught on video by numerous storm chasers as it passed near Elmer, Oklahoma. Based on radar and video evidence, surveyors determined that it was likely a violent tornado capable of producing EF4 or greater damage, though due to the fact that the tornado remained over very rural areas throughout most of its life and never directly impacted any substantial structures, the highest rating that could be applied was EF3. Two EF2 tornadoes also caused heavy damage near the town of Inola, Oklahoma later that evening, one of which damaged up to 120 homes. Further east, an EF2 tornado destroyed a mobile home and damaged frame homes near Sibley and Orrick, Missouri. Numerous additional weak tornadoes occurred mainly across Iowa, Oklahoma, and Missouri the following day. Overall, the outbreak produced 60 tornadoes and no deaths. May 23–25 A large storm system that resulted in catastrophic flooding produced numerous tornadoes across the Great Plains on May 23 and 24. Most of these tornadoes were weak, though EF2s caused considerable damage near New Boston, Illinois, and Ensign, Kansas. In Texas, EF1 tornadoes impacted mainly residential areas of Dallas, Houston, and Corpus Christi as well. In the early morning hours of May 25, a destructive tornado struck the Mexican border city of Ciudad Acuña, Coahuila; it was the first twister to strike the city in its history. Numerous cars and buses were thrown and mangled, and 750 properties were damaged or completely destroyed. Several masonry construction homes along the path were completely leveled. 14 fatalities occurred as a result, and an additional 229 residents were injured. The tornado was officially rated F3, though some sources list it as an F4. Additional tornadoes, a few of which were strong, touched down in Texas later throughout the day. This included an EF2 that killed one person near Cameron, Texas. Another EF2 struck Henderson, causing considerable damage in town. In Oklahoma, an EF2 caused heavy damage near the towns of Wister and Panama, while an EF3 killed one person near Blue. Overall, the outbreak produced 75 tornadoes and killed 16 people, making it the deadliest North American tornado outbreak of 2015. June There were 184 tornadoes reported in the U.S. in June, all of which were confirmed. June 4 On June 4, severe thunderstorms developed over north central Colorado and produced a total of 20 tornadoes, most of which were weak. However, there was one EF3 tornado that damaged 25 homes, destroyed three of them, and debarked small trees near Berthoud, Colorado. The tornado moved on an unusual westward track and was the first EF3 tornado in Colorado since 2008. Another supercell dropped 19 weak tornadoes near Simla, Colorado over the course of about three hours. Three of them were rated EF1 and the rest were rated EF0, and some of the tornadoes were anticyclonic. In addition, large hail also fell in Boulder and Elbert counties. June 22–23 High-end EF3 damage to a house in Coal City, Illinois. A damaging outbreak of strong tornadoes impacted the Great Lakes region of the United States from June 22 to June 23. The most significant activity occurred on the 22nd, including a high-end EF1 tornado that damaged numerous structures in Portland, Michigan early that afternoon. Later that evening, a strong, rain-wrapped EF3 partially debarked trees and swept away an unanchored house near Lovilia, Iowa, before weakening and striking the town of Albia at EF1 strength. A separate EF2 tornado from the same cell heavily damaged homes and businesses west of Albia as well. As the evening progressed, numerous tornadoes began touching down across northern Illinois and in Michigan as well. An EF2 struck the south side of Edgington, Illinois, tearing roofs off of homes, destroying garages, and snapping large trees. Another large EF2 wedge tornado caused major damage at the Woodhaven Lakes Campground near Sublette, flattening a large swath of trees, destroying or tossing numerous recreational vehicles and mobile homes, and injuring seven people. In Michigan, an EF2 tornado severely damaged two homes and downed numerous trees near the town of Millington. The strongest and most destructive tornado of the outbreak initially touched down after dark as a weak tornado south of Morris, Illinois, causing roof and chimney damage to homes, and downing trees and power poles as it moved along a southeasterly path. The storm intensified and widened rapidly as it entered Coal City, reaching nearly a mile wide in diameter and attaining high-end EF3 strength. Numerous anchor- bolted frame homes in Coal City were damaged or destroyed, and a few were leveled or swept from their foundations (though vehicles parked at these residences were not moved, and nearby vegetation was not defoliated or debarked, precluding a higher rating). Two large high-tension metal truss towers were toppled to the ground in Coal City as well. The tornado weakened to EF2 strength as it struck the neighboring town of Braidwood, heavily damaging trees, power poles, and a motel in the southwestern part of town. The tornado moved out of Braidwood and maintained EF2 strength as it continued along its southeasterly path through rural areas, rolling a recreational vehicle, damaging the roof of a frame home, snapping numerous power poles, and completely destroying an outbuilding before dissipating. The outbreak continued the following day as a few weak tornadoes were observed in Michigan, Ohio, and Massachusetts. Overall, this outbreak produced 28 tornadoes, though no fatalities occurred. July There were 122 tornadoes reported in the U.S. in July, of which 115 were confirmed. July 8 (Italy) A violent F4ARPAV: storms of 08/07/2015 on Veneto tornado impacted areas in and around the towns of Pianiga, Dolo and Mira, causing major damage and several casualties within the Riviera del Brenta region of Italy, famous for its villas and channels. About 500 buildings were badly damaged or destroyed, and among them was the large, two-story, masonry construction Villa Fini restaurant and hotel from the 17th century, which was almost entirely leveled to the ground. Many trees were defoliated, snapped, and partially debarked, and numerous cars were tossed and mangled, a few of which were thrown into canals and submerged. As the tornado impacted rural areas, homes and farmsteads were severely damaged or destroyed, metal high-tension truss towers were toppled to the ground, and agricultural fields were scoured. One person was killed, and at least 72 people were injured. July 13 A slow-moving EF3 stovepipe tornado occurred near Nickerson, Kansas, on the evening of July 13, completely debarking trees and cleanly sweeping away an unanchored farm home. The tornado was highly visible from the nearby town of Hutchinson, and was photographed and caught on video by many local residents. A few additional weak tornadoes occurred across parts of Indiana, Kentucky, and Wisconsin that evening as well. July 16 A localized outbreak of nine tornadoes impacted Iowa and Illinois on the evening of July 16. A few of these tornadoes caused significant damage to towns, including a large multiple-vortex EF2 that passed near the Illinois town of Monmouth and struck the nearby town of Cameron. Homes in Cameron had their roofs ripped off, large grain bins were destroyed at a granary in town, and trees were snapped as well. Another EF2 near Kirkwood destroyed barns and outbuildings and snapped power poles along its path. The most significant tornado of the event was a damaging EF2 that heavily damaged numerous homes, completely destroyed many garages and outbuildings, and snapped numerous trees in the southern part of Delavan, Illinois. Some homes had their roofs torn off, and one had its entire second story ripped off. In total, the Delavan tornado damaged 51 homes in town, 15 of which sustained major impacts. The tornado developed and dissipated so quickly that a tornado warning was never issued. July 27 (Manitoba) Large EF2 wedge tornado and associated wall cloud in Manitoba on July 27 A tornadic supercell produced an extremely long-lived high-end EF2 tornado that was on the ground for up to three hours as it tracked approximately across southern Manitoba. The tornado moved along a sharp northeasterly path, remaining over very rural areas as they passed near the towns of Pierson, Melita, Tilston, Reston, and Virden. Very few structures were impacted in this sparsely populated area, though a few farmsteads sustained some damage. Numerous trees and power poles sustained major damage along the storm track, and asphalt was scoured from a highway bridge near Melita. No injuries occurred as a result of this tornado and due to the rural nature of the affected area, no significant damage occurred. August There were 44 tornadoes reported in the U.S. in August, however, 47 were confirmed. August 18 An outbreak of 10 weak tornadoes struck the Chicago and Milwaukee Metro areas. Only minor damage was observed from the tornadoes and there were no injuries or fatalities.https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/listevents.jsp?eventType=%28C%29+Tornado&beginDate;_mm=08&beginDate;_dd=18&beginDate;_yyyy=2015&endDate;_mm=08&endDate;_dd=18&endDate;_yyyy=2015&hailfilter;=0.00&tornfilter;=0&windfilter;=000&sort;=DT&submitbutton;=Search&statefips;=-999%2CALL August 24 (Netherlands) Although strong tornadoes are extremely rare in the Netherlands, Wieringerwerf was struck by a small but destructive tornado during a severe weather event on the afternoon of August 24. The storm damaged 4 farms. August 24 (Australia) Around 5 p.m. local time, a tornado touched down near Dubbo, in the Central West region of New South Wales and in its 200 meter wide path through a semi-rural area damaged homes, sheds, and vegetation.  September  There were 24 tornadoes reported in the United States in September, of which 17 were confirmed. September 16 (France) A damaging F2 tornado struck the small village of Sonnac in southern France. Well-built homes had their roofs torn off, with some partial collapse of brick exterior walls observed. Major tree and outbuilding damage occurred as well. October There were 57 tornadoes reported in the United States in October, of which 40 were confirmed. October 4 (China) Several strong tornadoes impacted the Guangdong region of China killing 7 people, injuring over 223, and leaving 16 others missing. Three significant tornadoes occurred in Guangdong Province, impacting Foshan, Guangzhou, and Haifeng County. Two of these tornadoes impacted densely populated areas, leaving major damage. Homes were reportedly ripped apart and vehicles were overturned. The tornadoes were spawned by Typhoon Mujigae, which was approaching the area at the time. The Canton Tower had to be evacuated during a blackout throughout the whole province during the storms. October 30–31 EF2 damage to an industrial building in Pasadena, Texas. A small tornado outbreak occurred across Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi during a major flooding event. The first two tornadoes touched down in southern Texas during the early morning hours of the 30th, including an EF1 in Los Coyotes that was caught on surveillance video lifting a barn from its foundation and destroying it. Other outbuildings and trees sustained damage along the path as well. Another EF0 near Willamar knocked over a cotton seed holder and snapped tree limbs. More intense tornado activity occurred later on the 30th, as tornadoes impacted areas in and around the greater Austin and Houston areas, a few of which were strong. An EF0 struck the town of D'Hanis early in the morning, causing tree and roof damage throughout town. One frail, older brick building in the downtown area had its second story collapse. The town of Floresville sustained a direct hit from a strong EF2 tornado, where extensive tree and roof damage occurred, a billboard was collapsed, and recreational vehicles were thrown and destroyed, including one that was lifted and deposited on the roof of a three-story hotel. The local high school was severely damaged, sustaining two major exterior wall collapses on the second floor, as well as partial collapse of its roof. Another EF2 tornado damaged at least 25 homes near the town of Geronimo. Some of the homes sustained total roof loss, and mobile homes were rolled and destroyed. Numerous trees were downed, and outbuildings, garages, and pieces of farm equipment were damaged or destroyed as well. During the early morning of October 31, ten tornadoes touched down in the densely populated Houston Metropolitan Area. An EF0 tornado struck a mobile home park near Alvin, causing minor damage to 20 mobile homes and overturning one of them, injuring the couple inside. An EF1 tornado also occurred near Manvel destroying a mobile home and damaging 5 others, injuring three people. Another EF0 tornado caused roof damage to the Brazos Mall in Lake Jackson. One tornado struck the Houston suburb of Friendswood, causing mostly moderate tree and roof damage, though one well-built house had most of its roof torn off, warranting an EF2 rating. Another strong tornado began at the southeast edge of Pasadena before tearing through densely populated areas of La Porte. The most intense damage occurred in Pasadena, where a metal-frame industrial building was destroyed at EF2 strength. Significant tree and roof damage occurred in La Porte, where one home had most of its roof torn off and another was shifted off of its foundation. Many other homes sustained lesser damage. A third EF0 also touched down later in the morning, causing minor damage to homes in Highlands and Barrett. Tornadoes continued to touch down in areas further east later in the day, as weak tornadoes touched down in Louisiana and Mississippi. An EF0 tornado struck residential areas of Hattiesburg, Mississippi, causing minor tree and roof damage. Overall, this outbreak produced 24 tornadoes, though no fatalities occurred. November There were 95 tornadoes reported in the United States in November, however, 98 were confirmed. November 1 (Australia) A severe spring storm outbreak over eastern Australia caused one or possibly more tornadoes in northern Victoria. A multiple-vortex tornado was filmed in Nathalia, causing severe damage to farm buildings. Possibly the same tornado uprooted trees and damaged ten homes, destroying three in nearby Strathmerton. November 11 On Veterans Day, a powerful low-pressure system spawned a localized tornado outbreak, mainly across parts of central Iowa. Most of these tornadoes were weak, though a few were strong or caused considerable damage. This included an EF2 tornado that caused heavy damage to rural properties near Rathbun Lake, tearing roofs off of homes, shifting other homes off of their foundations, destroying outbuildings, and snapping power poles. Another EF2 tornado destroyed a well-built barn near the beginning of its path before weakening and striking Barnes City, Iowa, as an EF1, resulting in moderate tree and outbuilding damage in town. EF1 tornadoes also struck the Iowa towns of Le Claire and Knoxville, causing moderate damage. One EF0 tornado was observed and reported by air traffic controllers as it caused minor damage at the Des Moines International Airport. Overall, the outbreak produced 22 tornadoes and no fatalities or injuries. November 16–18 Building at a chemical plant that was leveled by the second EF3 tornado near Pampa, Texas. On November 16, an unusual late-season nocturnal tornado outbreak produced numerous tornadoes in parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska during the late evening and overnight hours. A long-track EF3 wedge tornado began northeast of Liberal, Kansas, and moved along a path through several counties before dissipating near Montezuma, causing extensive damage to farmsteads and trees along the path. Trees were partially debarked and denuded, homes were heavily damaged, a well-built metal frame hog containment building was obliterated, and a heavy steel oil tank was thrown by this strong tornado. Another large EF2 wedge tornado spawned by the same supercell caused considerable damage in rural areas between the towns of Ensign and Cimarron as well. A separate supercell storm also produced an EF2 tornado that caused damage to farms near Ness City as well. The towns of Grainfield and Lenora sustained direct hits from EF1 tornadoes, resulting in moderate damage at both locations. Further to the south, a large EF3 wedge tornado passed to the southeast of Pampa, Texas, before dissipating near Miami, debarking trees, toppling metal high-tension truss towers, and causing some ground scouring as it passed through rural areas. A well-anchored mobile home was completely swept away with little debris recovered, and nearby heavy farm equipment along with a two-ton truck were thrown 150 yards away. Shortly after the initial Pampa tornado, a second large EF3 passed to the southeast of the city, missing densely populated areas by just three miles. This large cone tornado leveled a large chemical plant complex on the outskirts of town, tossed vehicles, and destroyed a manufactured home. The destruction of the chemical plant complex resulted in a major gas leak and chemical spill, prompting a Hazmat team to respond. A large EF2 tornado passed near Groom, heavily damaging a frame home, destroying a well-built metal frame outbuilding, and moving a flat-bed truck 50 yards, while another EF2 heavily damaged a well service rig near Seminole. As the supercells crossed into the Oklahoma panhandle later that night, additional tornadoes touched down, including an EF2 that caused damage near the town of Fort Supply. Many other tornadoes were sighted in rural areas across the four states that night as well, though they remained mostly over open country and caused minimal damage. Due to the highly anomalous time of year and geographical locations of the outbreak, the National Weather Service office in Dodge City, Kansas described the event as being \\"unprecedented in recorded history for southwest Kansas\\". The parent storm system went on to produce additional weak tornadoes across the southern United States on the 17th and 18th, some of which impacted suburbs of Dallas and Atlanta. Overall, the outbreak produced 61 tornadoes, though no fatalities occurred. November 19 (Brazil) Three different tornadoes were sighted in three cities in the late afternoon: Marechal Cândido Rondon, in the state of Paraná (F1); Chapecó (F1) and Treze Tílias (F0), both in the state of Santa Catarina. In Marechal Cândido Rondon, the gusts reached the mark at 4:00 pm local time (UTC−02:00), leaving 20 people injured; several trees were toppled and approximately 1,500 houses were damaged, causing the disruption of the electricity service for 14,000 people. In Chapecó, the strong winds from a F1 tornado damaged 20 roofs, partially destroyed 6 houses and completely demolished another four. Four people were injured and the electricity service was cut in the evening. In Treze Tílias, a F0 tornado downed several trees and destroyed 10 roofs; a hospital was flooded and the electricity service was disrupted at 7:00 pm local time (UTC−02:00). December There were 93 tornadoes reported in the United States in December, of which 83 were confirmed. December 12 A localized outbreak of eight tornadoes impacted parts of Oklahoma and Texas on December 12. This included three EF2 tornadoes caused considerable damage in Texas, the first of which struck the town of Lindale and damaged roughly 50 homes. Another EF2 caused major damage to large industrial buildings and RVs near Willis, while a third damaged or destroyed homes and mobile homes near the towns of Pickton and Saltillo, injuring two. Three people were also injured by an EF2 tornado that damaged 16 homes and destroyed 4 mobile homes near Valliant, Oklahoma. December 16 (Australia) An estimated EF2 tornado spawned by a violent supercell hit parts of southern Sydney, New South Wales around 10:30am AEST. The suburb of Kurnell was hardest hit, with a confirmed wind gust of 213 km/h (132 mph) associated with the tornado. Numerous houses were partially destroyed, a major shopping centre and desalination plant were also damaged, whilst many trees were snapped and boats and trucks were reportedly flipped. Tennis ball sized hail and flash flooding with rainfall up to in an hour was also recorded from the same storm system, with damage reported across the Greater Sydney Area and the Illawarra. December 23–25 EF3 damage to a church in Lutts, Tennessee. On the evening of December 23, a significant tornado outbreak affected the Midwest and South, producing tornadoes mainly across Illinois, Michigan, Indiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee. One of the first tornadoes of the event was an EF1 tornado that touched down in Greenwood, Indiana, where several homes sustained damage. Another EF1 tornado caused damage to homes in the Indianapolis suburb of Noblesville. Two other tornadoes were reported in Indiana - an additional EF1 near the Rush County/Decatur County Line and an EF0 in Wayne County near Fountaintown. In Illinois, an EF1 tornado destroyed outbuildings and downed trees near the town of Sciota. The outbreak also spawned the only known tornado to touch down in Michigan during the month of December, an EF1 that struck the Detroit suburb of Canton, causing considerable damage to vehicles, an industrial park, and a gas station. Farther south, a strong EF2 tornado occurred near Marianna, Arkansas, completely destroying mobile homes, tearing roofs off of frame homes, and damaging cabins in the area. A large, destructive high-end EF3 tornado touched down south of Clarksdale, Mississippi, killing two people and severely damaging or destroying about 15 homes in that area. The tornado continued to the northeast, later snapping trees and destroying homes near Marks and Como before dissipating. The parent supercell that produced the Clarksdale tornado then produced a new tornado, a violent wedge that grew to nearly a mile wide and devastated the southern edge of Holly Springs, where two people were killed and a motorsports park and many homes were destroyed. Additional people were killed further along the path near Ashland and Canaan as well, where the tornado reached EF4 intensity. Homes were swept away and pavement was scoured from roads in this area. The tornado killed another person near Walnut before it eventually crossed into Tennessee, destroying homes near Middleton and Selmer before lifting. The Holly Springs/Ashland tornado killed 9 people in all. Another destructive EF3 tornado struck the small community of Lutts, Tennessee after dark, destroying homes and a church, and completely flattening the local post office. Significant tornado activity continued through parts of Mississippi and Tennessee overnight, including an EF2 tornado near Linden that downed many trees and killed an elderly couple in their small, unanchored home. More tornadoes were reported the following day and on Christmas as well, including a high-end EF2 tornado that destroyed homes in Birmingham. Overall, the outbreak resulted in 36 tornadoes and 13 deaths.  December 26–28  Damage in a residential area as a result of the EF4 Garland/Rowlett, Texas tornado. On the evening of December 26, a series of destructive tornadoes impacted areas in and around the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex, resulting in fatalities and major damage across densely populated areas. An EF3 tornado ripped through subdivisions in Ovilla and neighboring Glenn Heights, destroying numerous homes, two churches, and severely damaging a school building. Later that evening, a large EF4 wedge tornado touched down in northeastern Dallas County with major damage occurring in Garland and Rowlett. The Garland/Rowlett tornado completely destroyed numerous homes and vehicles along its path, and killed 10 people. Later that night, an EF2 tornado killed two people and caused major damage in Copeville, while an EF1 caused another fatality near Blue Ridge, leaving a total of 13 tornado related fatalities and making the event the deadliest tornado disaster in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex since the Dallas tornado of 1957. The parent storm system went on to produce several other tornadoes across the Southern United States throughout the next two days, including the second tornado to cause EF2 damage near Marianna, Arkansas within a six-day period. Overall, the storm system produced 32 tornadoes, along with significant snowfall and flooding.

He became a master in the Guild of Saint Luke in 1658 where he was registered under the name 'Jan van Beucken'. In the period from 1666 to 1682 he worked in Rome while regularly travelling back to Antwerp. He returned to live in Antwerp after the death of his parents.Zoltan Kovacs, \\"Jan van Buken Fecit” Egy antwerpeni mester ismeretlen műve Magyarországon, in: Artmagazin 2014/2. P. 44-50 Jan Baptist Beveren was registered as his pupil in 1689-90.Jan Baptist Beveren at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Jan van Buken died in Antwerp in 1694. Work Italianate Market Scene He painted mainly genre scenes and still lifes. The genre scenes cover the whole range of farm, kitchen and market scenes often including still lifes of food, game and fruit. He also painted still lifes of game, fish, food and flowers. Van Buken's paintings are in many ways close to those of the \\"Bamboccianti\\" painters. The name Bamboccianti is given to a loose group of principally Dutch and Flemish genre painters who were active in Rome from about 1625 until the end of the seventeenth century and took as the subject of their paintings the everyday life of the lower classes in Rome and its countryside. Bild des Monates at the Kurpfälzisches Museum An example of a composition in Bambocianti style is \\"An Italianate Market Scene with Remnants of a Roman Temple with a Harbour Beyond\\" (Sotheby's, 27 March 2007, London, lot 15). It depicts a 'low-life' scene of a vegetable market in an Italianate harbour town with Roman ruins. The composition includes other typical Bamboccianti elements such as the morra players in the middle of the market. The scene includes some high-ranking individuals such as the gentleman on a horse apparently returning from the hunt with a servant carrying his gun. He turns his head to look in amusement at the market scene just like van Buken's patrons would have done when confronted with a similar scene in real life. Typical for van Buken is the inclusion of a still life of vegetables in the foreground of this composition. Kitchen still life Van Buken's market scenes with abundant still life elements are also reminiscent of the work of Antwerp painters such as Erasmus de Bie, Peeter van Bredael and Peeter Gijsels whose works are similarly themed. About 25 works are currently attributed to Jan van Buken. Only two are known to be in museum collections: one is A still life of vegetables, poultry and meat in the collection of the Staatliches Museum Schwerin while a Market Scene is in the collection of the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm.Still life of vegetables, poultry and meat in the collection of the Staatliches Museum Schwerin at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Market Scene in the collection of the Nationalmuseum A Kitchen still life in a private collection in Hungary illustrates some of the compositional qualities of the artist. The painting shows a kitchen scene with a still life of game, food and kitchen utensils in the foreground and a large fireplace and two persons - apparently a female and male servant - at the back of the scene. The man is exiting through a door at the left while the woman has her hand on top of the ledge above the fireplace, possibly cleaning it. The still life´s apparent disorder hides a compositional scheme based on triangles.

It takes its name from the French word \\"skein\\" which are loose, tangled layers of yarn. A large, colorful canebrake resembling yarn; formed a near impenetrable, natural wall near the mouth of the creek before it was cleared for farming. French trappers and explorers named several of the major tributaries of the Arkansas River in Oklahoma; as it was once a part of the French Territory of Louisiana that was later the Louisiana Purchase. At one time, there were large rock bluffs near Big Skin's confluence with the Arkansas (most of these bluffs were later destroyed to provide rock fill for the W.D. Mayo Lock and Dam). The bluff on the south side (LeFLore County side) of the river and across from Big Skin's confluence was known as Swallow Rock, named for the birds that nested there and was the site of the old Fort Coffee. The bluff on the north side of the river (Sequoyah County side) and west of Big Skin is known as Wilson Rock (on some maps listed as Wilson's Rock). Both bluffs formed a natural wharf and served as historic steamboat landings and ferry crossings. The cemetery at Wilson Rock contains the graves of local residents as well as some travelers that fell victim to the river over the years. Tiana, the wife of the famed Texan Sam Houston was buried at Wilson Rock Cemetery for several years until she was moved to a cemetery near Fort Gibson. Wilson Rock and Big Skin Bayou were also drop off points for several groups of Cherokees that were forced to relocate to that part of Oklahoma/Indian Territory on the Trail of Tears. The relocated tribesmen that disembarked here would then follow the creek into the interior parts of Skin Bayou District where they settled. Most of eastern Sequoyah County was included in the \\"Skin Bayou District\\" of Cherokee Nation, Indian Territory; which also took its name from the creek. The headwaters of Big Skin Creek is located north of the Arkansas River, in the vicinity of Polecat Hollow, which is located in the Brushy Mountains of northern Sequoyah and southern Adair Counties. The creek flows in a southeasterly direction intersecting with Black Creek, near Sequoyah's Cabin and the community of Maple. Sequoyah was a respected elder of the Cherokee Tribe and the inventor of the Cherokee Syllabary (alphabet). After passing Sequoyah's Cabin, the creek widens and the flow begins to slow as it approaches U.S. Highway 64, near Muldrow, Oklahoma. It is at this point that is becomes known as Big Skin Bayou forming the north and east border of the Redland community. It flows under U.S. Interstate 40, which is just north of where it intersects with Little Skin Bayou and Tomlin Branch near the community of Baldridge; it continues southeast passing south of the Lee's Chapel community where the bayou splits, forming Breedlove Island and Cherokee Chute before emptying into the Arkansas River just upstream of the W.D. Mayo Lock and Dam.

Presidential systems Under the separation of powers model, the state is divided into different branches. Each branch has separate and independent powers and areas of responsibility so that the powers of one branch are not in conflict with the powers associated with the others. The typical division creates an executive branch that executes and enforces the law as led by a head of state, typically a president; a legislative branch that enacts, amends, or repeals laws as led by a unicameral or bicameral legislature; and a judiciary branch that interprets and applies the law as led by a supreme court. Divided governments are seen by different groups as a benefit or as an undesirable product of said separations. Those in favor of divided government believe that the separations encourage more policing of those in power by the opposition, as well as limiting spending and the expansion of undesirable laws. Opponents, however, argue that divided governments become lethargic, leading to many gridlocks. In the late 1980s, Terry M. Moe, a professor of political science at Stanford University, examined the issue. He concluded that divided governments lead to compromise which can be seen as beneficial. But he also noticed that divided governments subvert performance and politicize the decisions of executive agencies. Early in the 20th century, divided government was rare in the United States, but since the 1970s it has become increasingly common. Divided governments are contrasted by government trifectas—a different situation in which the same party controls both the executive and legislative branches. Semi-presidential systems In systems with a strong president and prime minister, such as in France, divided government is known as cohabitation. In cohabitation, executive power is divided between a president of one party and a cabinet of government ministers of another. Cohabitation occurs because of the duality of the executive: an independently elected president and a prime minister who must be acceptable both to this president and to the legislature. Jean V.

History From 1947 to 1965, National Health Service services in Somerset were managed by the South-Western Regional Hospital Board. In 1965, a new board was formed for Wessex which also covered Somerset. In 1974, the boards were abolished and replaced by regional health authorities; the whole of Somerset came under the South West RHA. Regions were reorganised in 1996 and Somerset came under the South and West (Wessex and South Western) Regional Health Authority. Somerset had its own area health authority from 1974 until 1992. Regional health authorities were reorganised and renamed strategic health authorities in 2002, with Somerset part of Dorset and Somerset SHA. In 2006, regions were again reorganised and Somerset came under NHS South West until that was abolished in 2013. There were three primary care trusts for the area: Bath & North East Somerset PCT, North Somerset PCT, and Somerset PCT. These trusts were abolished in 2013 and replaced by clinical commissioning groups. Sustainability and transformation plans Somerset formed a sustainability and transformation plan area in March 2016 with Dr Matthew Dolman, the Chair of Somerset CCG, as its leader. Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire formed a separate sustainability and transformation plan area with Robert Woolley, Chief Executive of University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, as its leader, replaced by Stephen Ladyman in 2018. Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust (which managed Musgrove Park Hospital in Taunton) and Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (which was the area's mental health trust) merged in April 2020, forming Somerset NHS Foundation Trust which provides acute, community and mental health services. Commissioning The clinical commissioning groups covering Somerset are: * Bath and North East Somerset, Swindon and Wiltshire CCG * Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire CCG * Somerset CCG  History  The CCG for Bath and North East Somerset proposed to set up a pooled budget with Bath and North East Somerset Council in August 2015. Somerset CCG proposed to set up a \\"joint health and care board\\" with a \\"significantly pooled budget\\" with Somerset County Council and NHS England after it was rated inadequate in August 2017. The CCGs for Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire merged in April 2018, and the Bath and North East Somerset CCG merged with the Swindon and Wiltshire CCGs in April 2020. Primary care There are 24 GP practices in Bath and North East Somerset . There are 25 in North Somerset CCG, while Somerset CCG has 63 practices grouped into nine GP federations. Yeovil District Hospital NHS Foundation Trust set up a subsidiary company, Symphony Healthcare Services, in 2016. It took over the running of three small practices, with a combined registered list of 12,500 in March 2016. Symphony was also forming a partnership with South Somerset Primary Healthcare, to manage an outcomes-based budget for the 120,000 population of South Somerset. In February 2018, it was reported that there had been a 15.6% increase in the emergency admissions rate in the area between 2014/15 and the 12 months to September 2017. Yeovil walk-in centre opened in 2009 and was closed in 2017. Somerset CCG said too many people were misusing the town centre facility with relatively minor ailments that could be solved by a pharmacist or by ringing 111. It was replaced by an urgent care service at the hospital, open from 10am to 6pm on Saturdays and Sundays. Acute care The main providers of NHS acute hospital care in the county are Yeovil District Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Somerset NHS Foundation Trust and Royal United Hospitals Bath NHS Foundation Trust. Weston General Hospital is managed by University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust. Taunton and Somerset Foundation Trust and Somerset Partnership (the county's mental health trust) decided in June 2017 to set up a joint management team overseen by a single chief executive. The same year, North Somerset Clinical Commissioning Group stated Weston Area Health Trust should become \\"part of a larger organisation\\" and in 2018 it was announced that Weston General would merge into University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust. The merger completed on 1 April 2020. Mental health and community services NHS Mental Health services are provided by Somerset NHS Foundation Trust, Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust and Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust. Somerset CCG is planning a significant reduction in community hospital beds provided by the partnership trust. In 2014 there were 312 beds but the CCG considered only 210 were needed. They are also planning to procure an integrated service for patients with long term conditions. It is also planning a health campus in Shepton Mallet which will have surgical and diagnostic services and medical assessment beds. The service provider will also be expected to collaborate closely with local charities and voluntary groups. In January 2020 Somerset Clinical Commissioning Group announced plans to close the 14-bed St Andrews unit in Wells and move the service to Yeovil, where it would be close to the hospital. A crisis cafe would be established in Wells, and another in Bridgwater. Since April 2010, Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust has provided tiers 3 and 4 of Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) in Bath and North East Somerset following a competitive tender. Previously this service had been operated primarily by the Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust. The service is jointly funded by the NHS and the local authority. Virgin Care won a seven-year contract to act as prime provider of community services in Bath and North East Somerset for an annual cost of £69.2 million in December 2016. This includes adult social work services, public health nursing, integrated reablement, speech and language therapy, continuing healthcare and children’s community health. Most were previously run by Sirona Care & Health. Some will be provided directly by Virgin and some contracted out. It is intended that the services will be more joined up and focussed on preventative care, through setting up hubs aligned with GP practices. In 2019, Sirona Care & Health won a 10-year adult community services contract to start in April 2020. Previously it had provided the service jointly with Bristol Community Health and North Somerset Community Partnership. Palliative care in the county is provided by St. Margaret's Hospice, which operates from Taunton and Yeovil, and Weston Hospicecare in Weston-super-Mare. HealthWatch Healthwatch is an organisation set up under the Health and Social Care Act 2012 to act as a voice for patients. There are three separate local Healthwatches in the county covering Somerset, North Somerset and Bath and North East Somerset.

It was designed by Raymond Clare Nowland and built from 1935 to 1936. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 24 June 1999.  History  Opened on 6 July 1936, the Fortitude Valley Police Station is a striking, two- storeyed red facebrick building with contrasting imitation stone dressings to arched entrances and window surrounds on the corner of Brookes and Wickham Streets, Fortitude Valley. From the 1850s there was a spread of urban settlement into Fortitude Valley and the area quickly became a thriving village. By the end of the 19th century Fortitude Valley had emerged as an important commercial and retail area with a number of substantial buildings and was a popular residential area. The area continued to expand during the early decades of the 20th century. The Fortitude Valley Police Station replaced an earlier station in Church Street when the area was elevated to the status of a police district in 1934 and the existing police station in Church Street was declared \\"quite inadequate for such an important quarter of the city.\\" At the official opening the new station was described as the \\"finest, most up-to-date, and most comfortable police station in Queensland.\\" The Station provided an entrance lobby and offices on the ground floor for the Inspector of Police and Clerks, Sergeant of Police and Clerk, Records, Station Sergeant's office, Constables and Non-Commissioned Officers' day rooms, plain and uniform Enquiry staff rooms with interrogating rooms, Paymaster and Enquiry rooms; dormitory accommodation, recreation rooms and sitting rooms, married and single men's messes, kitchen and lavatory and bathing facilities on the first floor; a lavatory block connected to the rear of the main building by a battened gangway; and garage to the rear corner of the courtyard. The dormitory was designed to provide commodious accommodation for single constables and were cross ventilated with tilting fanlights to each room. The building has been in continuous use as a police station since its construction. With changes to police work practices the building has been altered on a number of occasions since 1962. The first floor dormitory accommodation has been adapted for use as office accommodation for the CIB, Records, interviewing rooms and intelligence data recording. Glazed panels and door have been inserted within the elliptical arch between the main entrance lobby and the main hall; toilet and shower facilities have been refurbished; dropped ceilings have been inserted in some areas; plant for air conditioning and computers inserted; and an office mezzanine inserted within the former Sergeant's Clerks Office. The exterior of the building is substantially intact and much original interior fabric survives including window and door joinery; fibrous cement ceilings with timber cover strips; decorative plaster ceilings; plaster and timber skirtings and architraves; timber picture rails; decorative elliptical arch between the lobby and hall; terrazzo floors to the main entrance lobby and main hall; the main and subsidiary staircases with terrazzo treads and landings, silky oak handrails and newels, decorative wrought iron balustrading and decorative consoles to the flat arched approaches to the stairwells. Formerly stained and varnished, the timber panelling to the walls throughout the public areas, cover strips to the fibrous cement ceilings, timber architraves, cornices and picture rails are now painted. The integrity and spatial relations of the internal planning remain. The main entrance stair was an important component of the building and the French polishing section of the building specification referring to the stair handrails, newels and panelling states that \\"great care to be taken to show off the timber and panels to best advantage\\". The Fortitude Valley Police Station is a landmark structure within a precinct of community service buildings including the Fortitude Valley Swimming Baths, former Fortitude Valley State School, present Fortitude Valley State School, Holy Trinity Church and rectory. Designed by Raymond Clare Nowland, an architect in the Department of Public Works (DPW), the Fortitude Valley Police Station was constructed during an intensive public works building program undertaken by the Forgan Smith Labor Government in Queensland during the 1930s to counter the effects of the Great Depression. Raymond Clare Nowland joined the architectural office of the DPW in November 1932 where he became a senior architect in 1938. He produced the most significant buildings of his career between 1932 and 1942 including the University of Queensland Mayne Medical School at Herston (1939); Brisbane Dental Hospital and College (1941); Police Barracks, Petrie Terrace (1942); the Cairns Court House Complex (1935), the Rockhampton Courthouse, Toowoomba Police Station Complex and Maryborough Government Offices Building. Nowland undertook architectural studies at the Sydney Technical College (1911–14) and the Architectural Association School London (1919). In private practice from 1926–32, he undertook a range of domestic and commercial commissions including the Brisbane Clinic, Wickham Terrace, Brisbane (1930) (Lister House). His preference for designing within a restrained classicism reflects his architectural training, the prevailing professional architectural attitudes and the design direction given by the Chief Architect, A.B. Leven. Along with many British Empire architects of the 1930s, Leven and Nowland shared a respect for simplicity, order and rational planning which in his public work enabled Nowland to make a notable contribution to the architectural fabric of Queensland towns and cities.  Description  Architectural plans, circa 1935 The Fortitude Valley Police Station, a two-storey, L-shaped building in red facebrick with contrasting imitation stone facings in cream cement render, is a striking presence to the corner of Brookes and Wickham Streets, Fortitude Valley. The prominent tiled hipped roof is interrupted at the street corner and building ends by high narrow parapets with relieved quoining. Built around a courtyard containing a lavatory block and garaging to the rear, the Station is distinguished by a rendered portico entrance below an electric clock and rendered arched timber sash window within the high narrow parapet to the corner and striking rendered arches with prominent scroll keystones to the ground floor timber sash windows to both elevations.Police station, 1936 Single-height Doric columns flanked by rusticated pilasters beneath a dentilled cornice frame the main corner entrance portico which contains a set of terrazzo stairs and landing. The rusticated rendered arch with a prominent scroll keystone marks the side entrance portico to Wickham Street and is framed by rendered quoining to a high narrow parapet. Wrought iron ornamental grilles are provided to the ground floor street windows and ornamental iron gates to the arched vehicle entrance to Brookes Street. Overlooking Wickham Street from the first floor, an open porch framed by four half-height rendered Doric columns has an elegant, projecting oval balcony with decorative wrought iron balustrading. Bold brackets to lined roof eaves project over the plain flat arched sash windows to the first floor. The narrow high triangular parapeted rear entrance is accessed from the courtyard from a door sheltered by a moulded concrete awning supported by consoles which sits beneath the large semi-circular window which lights the main stairwell. The main corner entrance portico opens to a spacious main entrance lobby and hall around which the building hinges and from which central corridors run through each wing. Within the hinge, a dog leg timber stair connects to the first floor and a rear entrance opens to the courtyard beyond. The corridor to the Brookes Street wing opens to the vehicle laneway and the corridor to the Wickham Street wing terminates at a secondary dog leg timber stair. A side passage off this corridor connects via a battened gangway to the lavatory block in the rear courtyard. The main entrance lobby, hall floors, Wickham Street side entrance lobby, stair treads and landings in both stairwells are in pale gold and white terrazzo with black terrazzo borders to the floors. Two large plaster rosette pateras lie to the upper corners of the main lobby to each side of the elliptical moulded arch with large scroll keystone which separates the lobby from the hall. This opening has now been glazed and contains a glazed security door. The main stair doglegs off the hall and has a grooved silky oak handrail and 6\\"x6\\" stop chamfered silky oak newels with sunk necking and domed caps. Ornamental consoles decorate the flat arched openings to the stairwell. The plaster ceilings to the lobby and hall are decorated with a border figure of tied bundles of straight twigs. The Wickham Street entrance stairwell has similar detailing but is narrower. The offices on the ground floor are accessed from central corridors with semi-circular arched doorways to each end. The rooms retain their original spatial forms with some changes to doorways, some added internal glazing and refurbishment of tiling and fittings to the lavatory areas. The Constables' Day Room continues to be used for this purpose. The insertion of a mezzanine to the former Sergeant's clerks office has disrupted the form of this room. The dormitory accommodation on the first floor retains its spatial integrity and now accommodates offices and associated storage and interview rooms. The tilting fanlights to the bedrooms remain along with window and door joinery, architraves, skirtings, picture rails, fibrous cement ceilings with timber cover strips. The recreation room is now a locker room and opens to the balcony overlooking Wickham Street. The balcony has a concrete floor, decorative wrought iron balustrading and four half-height Doric columns. The balcony affords views across to Holy Trinity Church and associated grounds. The rear courtyard contains the lavatory block and a two vehicle garage. A retaining wall separates the yard from the adjacent police car parking area which looks onto the former Fortitude Valley State School. This car parking area adjacent to the School was used as a playground by pupils attending the former Fortitude Valley State School until the 1940s.  Heritage listing  Fortitude Valley Police Station was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 24 June 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Constructed in 1936, the Fortitude Valley Police Station was the second purpose-built police station erected on the police reserve. The prominent siting, scale and form of this distinctive L-shaped building to the corner of Brookes and Wickham Streets demonstrate the emerging importance of Fortitude Valley as an urban centre and the development of law and order services in the district. The Station provides evidence of the evolution of the role of police and police stations in a major urban district illustrating the decreasing importance of the provision of a supporting accommodation function to the establishment of the Station as an official base for extended police operations. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The site has had a continuous association with law enforcement activities since 1889 and the present Fortitude Valley Police Station has been operating as a police station for the Fortitude Valley district since 1936. The place is a fine example of the planning of a 1930s police station with barracks though the barracks are now adapted for use as offices. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. A striking, L-shaped, two- storeyed, red facebrick building with contrasting rendered dressings, the Fortitude Valley Police Station is a landmark building on a busy arterial road and forms an integral part of an important group of community service buildings within the area. A prominent public building, the Station provides a strong civic presence and contributes to the streetscape. The careful detailing, use of materials and thoughtful composition illustrate competency in design and workmanship. The Fortitude Valley Police Station is important for its intact exterior and for its surviving interiors particularly the main entrance lobby, hall and main stair. The Fortitude Valley Police Station is an integral component within the picturesque precinct of ecclesiastical, recreational, law enforcement and educational buildings and associated grounds formed by the Holy Trinity Church, Holy Trinity Rectory, Valley Swimming Baths, former Fortitude Valley State School and present Fortitude Valley State School. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The Fortitude Valley Police Station has a special association with Queensland Police, demonstrating the evolution of work practices and the changing nature of the lifestyle associated with police work in a major urban district. The Fortitude Valley Police Station is important for its association with the extensive public works building program undertaken by the Forgan Smith Government throughout Queensland during the 1930s. The place is an important building within the body of work produced by the Department of Public Works in the first half of the 20th century. The Fortitude Valley Police Station is important for its association with the architect Raymond Clare Nowland. The building is one of the most notable structures designed by Nowland, an architect of considerable talent working in the Department of Public Works during the period of extensive public works building in the 1930s.

It is located along the Upper New York Bay, between 29th and 39th Streets in the Sunset Park and Greenwood Heights neighborhoods of Brooklyn, New York City.https://www.dot.ny.gov/recovery/sponsors/tiger/repository/NYCEDC%20SBMT%20Application.pdf The site is adjacent to Bush Terminal and Industry City, which respectively lie directly to the south and east. A recycling and waste transfer facility managed by Sims Metal Management is the major tenant. In May 2018, the city contracted partners to activate the largely unused terminal.https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/nycedc-moves-to- reinvigorate-south-brooklyn-terminal Early ferry service Connector from waterfront to 38th Street Yard and the South Brooklyn Railway. The New York and South Brooklyn Ferry operated a ferry from the Battery Maritime Building (formerly known as Municipal Ferry Pier) to the South Brooklyn/39th Street Ferry Terminal, where rail transfer (to the South Brooklyn Railway) was possible until 1935. Formerly, a Staten Island Ferry route ran between the ferry slip at 39th Street within Bush Terminal, and the St. George Terminal in Staten Island. The ferry route was discontinued in 1946 after a fire at St. George Terminal. Rail service 2nd Avenue Yard is located on the marine terminal Adjacent to the Bush Terminal it is served by car float and transloading activities of New York New Jersey Rail via the 65th Street Yard which also connects to the Bay Ridge Branch, operated by the New York Connecting Railroad. Rail infrastructure improvements along 1st Avenue completed in 2012 connected the yard to SBMT. Other investments in infrastructure included a new break-bulk rail spur along the 39th Street shed, two new rail sidings for auto rack transloading, and a new rail connection to the SIMS facility at the 29th Street Pier. SBMT is also connected along the South Brooklyn Railway (ROW) to 36th–38th Street Yard. In 2012, the interchange with New York New Jersey Rail, LLC at Second Avenue was refurbished and a new ramp was installed at the 38th Street Yard at Fourth Avenue to allow receipt of new R156 locomotives and other subway rolling stock that are delivered on flat cars. Waste management thumb Sims Metal Management subsidiary Sims Municipal Recycling (SMR) managed construction of a new 11-acre recycling center at SBMT from 2010 to 2013. SMR worked with geotechnical engineers to develop structural fill blends using “mole rock” from NYC tunneling projects mixed with recycled glass aggregate (RGA). More than 5,000 tons of RGA were blended with 20,000 tons of mole rock and used to elevate sections of the site by 4 feet, thereby protecting buildings and equipment against sea level rise and storm surges. Wind turbine In January 2015, SIMS inaugurated the city's only commercial-scale wind turbine at the recycling center. Built by Northern Power Systems at the cost of about $750,000, the tall turbine has the capacity to produce 100 kilowatts, or 4% of the center's power needs. Auto processing Auto processing, the customization of imported automobiles, is done at the terminal at a scaled- down assembly plant where much of the work is done by hand using simple tools. Quality control inspections are done, repairs are made, and accessories – such as floor mats, GPS systems, satellite radios, alloy wheels and roof racks – are installed. The facility at SBMT was operated by the Axis Group. which filed bankruptcy in 2012. Plans by the New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC) to redevelop and expand the auto processing have been bogged down since 2014. Sustainable South Brooklyn Marine Terminal The SBMT was designated as part of America's Marine Highway in 2015. In 2018, Sustainable South Brooklyn Marine Terminal (SSBMT) was established and operations turned over the Red Hook Container Terminal operators.https://untappedcities.com/2018/05/17/see-inside-the-reactivated- south-brooklyn-marine-terminal-in-sunset-park/ See also * List of North American ports * List of ports in the United States * Red Hook Container Terminal * Rail freight transportation in New York City and Long Island * Tugboats in New York City * Vision 2020: New York City Comprehensive Waterfront Plan  References  Category:Transportation buildings and structures in Brooklyn Category:Ports and harbors of New York (state) Category:Railway freight terminals in the United States Category:Sunset Park, Brooklyn Category:Port of New York and New Jersey Category:Wind power in New York (state) ","title":"South Brooklyn Marine Terminal"},{"id":"44810279","text":"Castle Peak is the highest point on the Idaho Batholith The Idaho Batholith is a granitic and granodioritic batholith of Cretaceous-Paleogene age that covers approximately of central Idaho and adjacent Montana.

Experts believe that survival is threatened by a combination of factors including habitat loss, animal grazing, the harvest of woody fuel by local farmers, and fragmentation. Several concerned individuals and organizations have been working to ensure this species is conserved and saved from extinction.

Different from data analysis that transforms data and information into insights, data reporting is the previous step that translates raw data into information. When data is not reported, the problem is known as underreporting; the opposite problem leads to false positives. Data reporting can be an incredibly difficult endeavor. Census bureaus may hire even hundreds of thousands of workers to achieve the task of counting all of the residents of a country.

It is unknown who commissioned the work or where it was kept after completion, but in 1923 it was acquired by the Melbourne Cricket Club through its then-secretary, Test cricket great Hugh Trumble. The Handcock portrait is the best-known painting of Wills and is currently on display in the National Sports Museum. Background Tom Wills is recognised as Australia's first multi-sports superstar, for he dominated cricket and was the primary catalyst behind the sport of Australian rules football. Born in 1835 in the British colony of New South Wales and raised in Victoria, Wills was sent to England in 1850 to attend Rugby School, where he became captain of the school cricket team and played a nascent form of rugby football. Returning home in 1856, Wills revolutionised Australian cricket and captained Victoria to repeated victories in intercolonial matches. In 1858 he called for the formation of a \\"foot-ball club\\" with a \\"code of laws\\" to keep cricketers fit during winter. The following year, he assisted in drawing up the laws from which Australian rules football evolved. He is regarded as one of the more complex and intriguing figures in Australian history, given his lifelong engagement with Indigenous Australians and the nature of his downfall. Wills posed for the portrait before the end of 1870. The artist, William Handcock, was born in Ireland and lived for a period in New Zealand before relocating to Melbourne. He died from tongue cancer soon after the portrait's completion. There is no recorded evidence of the portrait until 1923, when The Australasian reported that Test cricket great Hugh Trumble, then secretary of the Melbourne Cricket Club (MCC), purchased the painting (from whom is not stated) and donated it to the MCC.Worrall, Jack (8 December 1923). \\"MR. T. W. WILLS\\", The Australasian. Description The portrait is full-length, measuring 42 cm by 32 cm and done in oils, an unusual medium for Handcock. Set at sunset against a backdrop of firs in the outfield of a cricket oval, Wills is shown in his white flannels and the colours of the MCC on his belt and cap. Appearing stately like a \\"pasha of the East\\", he holds a cricket bat in the manner of a walking cane. According to biographer Greg de Moore, \\"he does not look like an athlete, more like a middle-aged lawyer with a liking for a nobbler\\". Wills' \\"pendulous paunch\\" is suggestive of the early stages of physical decline, and his coarsely reddened nose and cheeks allude to years of alcohol abuse. Historian Geoffrey Blainey detects \\"a slight air of weariness\\" in his blank expression. Legacy The portrait is the most recognisable image of Wills and the most public symbol of his link to the MCC. It has been reproduced as souvenirs, including Christmas cards. The portrait serves as the cover image of the 1987 book Glorious Innings: Treasures from the Melbourne Cricket Club Collection. In his historical novel The Call (1998)—a semi-fictional account of Wills' life—journalist Martin Flanagan opens the final chapter with an imagining into Handcock's encounter with Wills and the circumstances under which the portrait was painted. In 2003, the Melbourne Cricket Ground celebrated its 150th anniversary by commissioning illustrator Robert Ingpen to create a woven tapestry depicting a chronological history of the ground. The figure of Wills—the second to appear, after the MCC's inaugural president—is based on Handcock's portrait. Wills appears two more times: as umpire of the first recorded Australian rules football match in 1858, and as coach of the 1866–67 Aboriginal cricket team, the first Australian team to tour England.

Her father was the late trumpeter, saxophonist, and vocalist, Tim Ballard, whom was honored as an inductee into the Kansas Music Hall of Fame (2008, as member of Capitol Records recording artists, Garry Mac and the Mac Truque (1969–1971)).  Early Life and education  Ballard Shut was born in 1972 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, but after her parents divorced in August 1977, moved to Kansas City, Missouri when she was four years old. She was raised by her mother Sharyn and step-father, J. Michael Pendergist, in Eastern Jackson County, Missouri (Kansas City), from 1977 to 1995 and lived in the area again from 1999 to 2000. Her first and primary instrument was the piano at age 8, but starting in fifth grade, she also earned the first chair clarinet spot in the school band. However, Ballard Shut deeply wanted to play in jazz band, and upon learning that clarinetists were only welcome in a jazz ensemble if they were also saxophonists, she switched to tenor and baritone saxophone and continued to excel on these instruments as a 'doubler' throughout high school. Among her musical honors as a youth, she auditioned and was selected from hundreds of area-wide competitors to perform with the 1989 Kansas City All District \\"Blue\\" Jazz Band (on baritone saxophone and under the direction of saxophonist Jim Mair), and under the direction of Dr. James Popejoy, was the honored recipient on saxophone of the prestigious John Philip Sousa Band Award, granted to one band student from each American high school that demonstrated the highest quality of musical excellence within his or her senior year. Ballard Shut was active in every musical organization offered, including all bands and also as one of only two mezzo-soprano vocalists selected to sing in the school's 40-member honor choir, Camerata, under the direction of the esteemed Mr. Noel Fulkerson. As the string orchestra did not allow saxophonists as a general rule, she instead performed in the percussion section, having learned timpani, crash cymbals, bass drum, and other auxiliary instruments at Central Missouri State University's Summer Music Camp in 1988 and 1990. Because of her extreme musical versatility and due to often seeing her perform with a different instrument in her hand, by her senior year, fellow members of her high school band granted her an additional humorous award at the annual banquet entitled, \\"I Have More Instruments Than The United States Marine Corps Band\\". After graduating from Raytown Senior High School in Raytown, Missouri in 1990, she first attended The University of Central Missouri in Warrensburg, Missouri as a Music Education major from 1990–1993 and in 1993 was inducted as a lifetime member into Sigma Alpha Iota music fraternity, Epsilon Omega chapter. Disenchanted with the rigors of the major, in 1993, Ballard Shut changed her field of study in her junior year from Music Education to Spanish, moved back home, and transferred to Rockhurst University in Kansas City, Missouri, where she graduated magna cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in 1995. As a result, she won a full-ride scholarship in 1995–1996 to Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and worked as a Teaching Assistant in the Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures. In 1997, after leaving the program at Marquette to spend a year of self-discovery, Ballard Shut found that she could apply her honed teaching skills in the growing information technology field, eventually leading to strong experience as a data architect and team manager in the data warehousing field. In 2015, Ballard Shut later graduated magna cum laude with a Master of Business Administration degree from Webster University.  Musical family legacy  Ballard Shut's family was particularly musical on her father's side. Her paternal grandmother, Velma Ballard Mitchell (née DeWeese), was first an accomplished pianist and then an organist later in life, and Velma's father, (Grover Seldon DeWeese) was a barn dance fiddler who was also the proprietor of a dairy farm in Miami County, Kansas. DeWeese's fiddle, passed down to her from her father, hangs in a showcase in Ballard Shut's home. Still other members of Ballard Shut's great-grandmother's family history (Esther DeWeese (née Reimal)), had been either musicians, traveling thespians, and even early silent film stars. As an adult, she is a multi-faceted musician who has performed jazz as both pianist and also woodwind \\"doubler\\" (clarinet/flute/saxes) in big bands, small jazz combos, theatre productions, and charity concerts.  Recent events  In 2000, Ballard Shut moved from Kansas City to Denver, Colorado. From 2002 to 2008, she served as a member of several jazz orchestras within The Colorado Jazz Workshop (CJW) under the leadership of famed trumpeter Hugh Ragin. In 2008, after five seasons of professional coaching and performing with the organization, she left the CJW to form her own group, together with the late trumpeter and fellow CJW alumnus, Mike Evans (1955-2017), known in Denver as 'Lost Soul Jazz Combo',. She is currently a co-composer/author, American label partner, and international press agent for the Italian jazz-funk ensemble, Camera Soul (2012–present). In addition to collaborating with jazz & soul master and father, the late Tim Ballard, Ballard Shut has also worked closely with Latino film and music star Daniel Valdez (of films 'Zoot Suit' and 'La Bamba'; stage production, 'The Westside Oratorio'), Los Angeles-based Nigerian vocalist Douyé, and Front Range (Colorado) jazz artists Vern Neeley, Tony Exum, Jr., Mark Diamond, Keith Oxman, Drew Morell, Linda Theus-Lee, Mike Evans, Kevin MacInness, Mark Brostrom, Jared Johnson, Jean-Luc Davis, Ron Bland, Amy Kay, and many others. On October 16, 2007, largely due to her father's ailing health during his decade-long battle with cancer and to grant his wish for a company to continue his musical legacy, Ballard Shut founded TIMKAT Entertainment LLC, an independent record label devoted to producing world- class jazz and soul music. When her father passed in June 2009, the label went dormant for three years; however, since 2012, TIMKAT has achieved positive notoriety and modest success through a strong fan following on Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, ReverbNation, music review sites, and via Internet radio play, primarily on stations based in the US, France, Australia, and the United Kingdom, as well as several dedicated artist channels on Pandora Radio, Amazon Music, Earbits, Spotify, Deezer, and Jango Radio. The label's preferred sales channels are Bandcamp and CDBABY, and it often utilizes CDBABY's extensive digital music network to distribute its albums globally via major mp3 stores such as iTunes and Amazon. The label often collaborates with other independent labels worldwide and serves as an American partner label for international distribution and marketing throughout North America. Aside from producing music, Ballard Shut also produced and hosted a popular monthly syndicated Internet radio show called Modern Soul Sauce, dedicated to showcasing music from top independently-produced soulful artists. The syndicated program was commissioned by Jerome Demortier of Radio Kaos Caribou (Paris, France), world- premiered in October 2012, and during its four-season run, was featured on as many as 15 Internet global radio networks, with several stations continuing to air past episodes weekly. The show helped to bring long-term exposure to over 300 independent artists, the majority of whom were not associated with the TIMKAT label. Some of the show's best-known past artists include Will Downing, Traedonya, Incognito, Jarrod Lawson, Camera Soul, Tyler Kinchen and the Right Pieces, producer James Day, SuCh, Kenya McGuire Johnson, and Maysa Leak. Due to her album credits, in 2012, Ballard Shut became a Voting Member of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences aka \\"The Recording Academy\\", known internationally for its Grammy Awards, after having first been an Associate Member (2008–2012), and is still active in the Recording Academy today. She is also a member of ASCAP as a composer, author, and music publisher (popular music) (TIMKAT Entertainment), IPIs 6910514154 and 672818809. Recreationally, Ballard Shut is an avid traditional recurve bow archer as a member of both the Colorado State Archery Association (CFAA) and the National Field Archery Association (NFAA), as well as a former member of the Kansas City Swing Dance Club. She is a language enthusiast, a fluent speaker of English and Spanish, and has basic knowledge of Russian, French, Italian, German, and Hebrew.

Kao was waving a wooden stick in the street in front of his driveway, prompting multiple 911 calls placed by Kao's neighbors. He was then fatally shot by public safety officer Jack Shields. Kao's family filed a lawsuit against Rohnert Park which was settled for $1 million. Background Kuanchung Kao ( – ; ) was a Taiwan-born microbiologist working as a quality control engineer. He was married to Ayling Wu, a registered nurse, and they had three children together. Officer Mike Lynch was the first police respondent on the scene. Officer Jack Shields was the second respondent, a 25-year veteran Rohnert Park public safety officer (the combined police and fire departments) at the time of the shooting in 1997. He had been promoted to police lieutenant soon after joining the force, and was later promoted to fire commander after serving more than twenty years as a police lieutenant. He was demoted to patrol officer after a year as fire commander after he was found guilty of falsifying time cards for other employees. Shooting On the night of , Kao was drinking at the Cotati Yacht Club in celebration of a new job. While at the bar, he was involved in two scuffles with at least one other bar patron. In the first, he corrected a patron by stating he was Chinese, not Japanese, to which the other patron responded by saying \\"You all look alike to me.\\" The bartender, who was familiar with Kao, separated them by seating them at opposite ends of the bar. The same patron later approached Kao and whispered some inflammatory words, instigating an altercation to which police were called. Kao was sent home in a taxicab by the bartender, who said the bar fight was inconsistent with Kao's usual behavior. Upon arriving home, Kao stayed outside, crying \\"Neighbors, please help me!\\" Postmortem tests showed Kao's blood alcohol level was 0.23%, well over the legal limit of impairment in California. Neighbors called 911 to report a drunken disturbance at 2:11a.m. Kao retrieved a wooden stick comparable to a closet rod from a motorhome parked in his driveway at around this time. Four minutes later police officer Lynch arrived and stopped his patrol vehicle close to Kao in what witnesses felt was an attempt to scare him, but Kao hit the patrol car with the stick. Lynch backed the car away and remained in the car waiting for backup. Almost simultaneously, officer Shields arrived, training a spotlight on Kao and exiting his vehicle, despite Lynch radioing Shields to remain in his car. Shields later testified that he left the car to find Kao's wife Ayling Wu. Lynch and Shields were in uniform and arrived in marked patrol cars with their sirens on but an eyewitness later stated neither of them identified themselves as police officers. When the officers arrived, Kao's wife Ayling Wu was outside trying to calm Kao and grab the stick. Shields commanded Wu to step away from Kao. She believed the officer would grab the stick but once she had retreated, Shields shot Kao once in the chest. Shields later testified that Kao charged him with the stick raised over his head in a striking posture, closing to within . Four separate eyewitnesses contradicted Shields' testimony, saying that Kao was never closer to Shields than . Kao was then handcuffed behind his back and left face down on his driveway to await paramedics. Ayling Wu, a trained medical professional, said she could see her husband breathing and tried to administer aid but was physically restrained by the officers and threatened with arrest. By the time paramedics arrived some ten minutes later Kao was dead.His body remained in the driveway until noon, and his 5-year-old daughter witnessed part of the disturbance. Shields later testified that he feared for his life as Kao was waving the stick in \\"a threatening martial arts fashion.\\" Kao never studied martial arts. A warrant executed the next day had police comb through Kao's house for evidence of martial arts training or paraphernalia. None was found. Legal actions Sonoma County District Attorney The Sonoma County Sheriff's Department conducted an investigation of the shooting and filed a 600-page report with the Sonoma County District Attorney's office in May 1997. On , Sonoma County District Attorney Michael Mullins decided not to file criminal charges against Officer Jack Shields, concluding that Officer Shields had acted in self-defense. The California Attorney General's office investigated whether the decision not to prosecute was an abuse of discretion, concluding in a letter from Dan Lungren that deadly force was justified. Rohnert Park On , the Rohnert Park Department of Public Safety ruled Officer Shields acted in accordance with departmental policies and procedures for the use of deadly force. Federal Bureau of Investigation The United States Attorney in San Francisco requested an FBI investigation of the shooting shortly after it occurred, on the suspicion that Kao's civil rights had been violated through the use of excessive force, which potentially could have led to a life sentence. Senator Barbara Boxer met with Ayling Wu and Nancy Wang on ; following the meeting Boxer stated she would relay concerns to the US Attorney. On , US Attorney Michael Yamaguchi declined to file criminal charges against Officer Shields, citing insufficient evidence that Kuanchung Kao's civil rights were violated. Civil suit On , John Burris and the Asian Law Caucus filed an administrative wrongful death claim, followed by the filing of a million federal suit against Rohnert Park, its Police Department, and the two officers involved. The suit was settled out-of-court for million in 2001 with no admission of liability. Aftermath The shooting of Kuanchung Kao mobilized Asian-American activists to protest the perceived racial factors in his killing. Days after the August 1997 Rohnert Park investigation cleared Shields, on the 100-day anniversary of Kao's death, a vigil was held in San Francisco in part demanding a new investigation. Activist pressure along with a growing trend of fatal police shootings in Sonoma County culminated in a United States Commission on Civil Rights investigation, which held a public hearing on . Police and police supporters packed the meeting, forcing those with different viewpoints to stand outside the meeting room. Kao's widow Ayling Wu and their three children moved to Orange County by 1998.Karolyn Kao, daughter Most of the court settlement was overtaken with lawyer fees and moving expenses. Wu was forced to sell the family dog, a 3 year old fawn American Mastiff named Nala, which was purchased as a puppy by Kao for their daughter several years prior. Wu received temporary support with childcare from the family nanny, who assisted with the moving transition to Orange County for several months. All of Kao and Wu's extended families reside in Taiwan, and maintained infrequent contact after Kao's death. Following the departure of the family nanny after the move south, Wu fell into a period of extreme depression and experienced suicidal thoughts, while struggling to make ends meet while also attempting to raise the children on her own. Wu's condition gradually improved over the years and continues to lead a moderately successful career as a Director of Nursing, but never remarried or fully recovered from the trauma and isolation. The twin boys currently attend San Diego State University and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, pursuing kinesiology and forestry, hoping to eventually practice physical therapy and smokejumping.

Once part of a large Roman treasure, only the silver lanx remains from the original find. The British Museum eventually purchased it in 1993.British Museum Highlights British Museum Collection Discovery In 1735, the daughter of a local cobbler found the silver lanx on the banks of the River Tyne near the village of Corbridge, Northumberland. Over a period of about 30 years in the early eighteenth century, a number of silver objects were found in the vicinity, which were probably part of a large Roman hoard. Unfortunately, all other items from the treasure disappeared, with only the Corbridge Lanx remaining. The lanx became the property of the Dukes of Northumberland and remained in their possession until 1993, when it was sold by Henry Percy, 11th Duke of Northumberland to the British Museum. Description Full view The large silver tray is rectangular in shape and is engraved with mythological scenes from antiquity. Designed either as a serving dish for Roman banquets or as a ritual tray for sacrifices, this particularly extravagant example is similar in style to several platters from the Mildenhall Treasure and can be dated to the 4th Century AD. The main scene on the dish shows the god Apollo at the entrance to a shrine, clasping a bow with a lyre at his feet. To his left enters the goddesses Artemis and Athena in conversation. The two female deities in the centre have not been conclusively determined. In front of the gods is depicted an altar, flanked by Artemis's hound, a fallen stag and a griffin, a mythical animal often associated with Apollo.

Life Sarah Cheney first came to notice when she appeared at the Drury Lane Theatre in October 1763 in a play by William Congreve. She worked regularly, commanding two pounds a week, and, in 1765, she appeared in the first performance of Samuel Foote's play, The Commissary, at the Haymarket Theatre. That year, she met the actor William Gardner and they were married. The new couple took up roles in Foote's Company of Comedians. In the autumn, she was appearing as Mrs Gardner in the title role of Polly Honeycombe at Covent Garden with her new husband. Gardner moved in with Foote, as his housekeeper, at some point. In the eleven years from 1766 to 1777, she appeared in comic roles for Foote but she had her best success in summer roles at the Haymarket, including The Nabob. It was said that her acting skills were less apparent after Foote died in 1777, and it was then that Gardner turned to playwriting. She wrote and appeared in The Advertisement, or, A Bold Stroke for a Husband at The Haymarket, but this was not acclaimed.Alison Oddey, ‘Gardner , Sarah (fl. 1763–1795)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 22 Dec 2014 In the same year, she separated from her husband and gained custody of their children. William Gardner went to work in numerous secondary roles and died in 1790 whilst his wife was abroad. Gardner went to the Caribbean for four years and returned to act again in London before taking up work in Dublin. It was said that she arranged her own death and funeral to avoid paying debts. In 1789, she was appearing in New York having travelled there via Jamaica. In 1795, there was a benefit for her at The Haymarket after she had appeared there in her own play entitled Mrs Doggrell in her Attitudes, or, The Effects of a West India Ramble.

It publishes more than 30 monthly titles across a wide range of interest sectors, including human health, pets, marine, aviation and organic farming. Belvoir also publishes more than 100 special health reports — thirty-thousand word white papers on topics that include Macular Degeneration and the Aging Eye, Heart Failure, and Living with Diabetes. The company owns numerous websites published in concert with its many titles, and runs the publishing operations of Harvard Medical School and Tufts University. History The progenitor of Belvoir Media Group was Belvoir Publications Inc. It was purchased by Belvoir Chairman Robert Englander in 1972, and consisted of a single title, Aviation Consumer. The publication was characterized by an advertising-free, subscriber-supported, high-value-content format modeled on Consumer Reports magazine that would become a Belvoir trademark. Practical Sailor was acquired in 1975, and Aviation Safety, also for pilots, was launched in 1980. During this period, Belvoir acquired additional titles in the aviation and marine domains—Light Plane Maintenance, IFR (which stands for “instrument flight rules”), and Boatbuilder. The company started Powerboat Reports in 1989. An audio information service, Pilot’s Audio Update, and a newsletter titled IFR Refresher were acquired in 1992. The mid-1990s witnessed an energetic effort to apply Belvoir’s ads-free, consumer newsletter format to the equine world. The company started Michael Plumb’s Horse Journal, purchased The Horse (from Tufts University) and started John Lyon’s Perfect Horse, a training and horse- care publication with a western horsemanship focus. Later equine acquisitions included Rodeo (formerly Spin to Win) and Trailrider. Now renamed Belvoir Media Group, the company sold the equine division in 2012 to Active Interest Media. In 2002, the company acquired AVweb.com, the nation’s leading online news and information service for pilots, and, in 2003 Kitplanes for builders of full-size aircraft. Health Media In 1998, Belvoir Media Group purchased the health newsletter division of the Toronto Star. The acquisition came with eight monthly publications: Cleveland Clinic Heart Advisor, Cleveland Clinic Men’s Health Advisor, Mount Sinai School of Medicine (now Icahn School of Medicine) Focus on Healthy Aging, Weill-Cornell Women’s Health Advisor, Weill- Cornell Women’s Food and Fitness Advisor (now Women’s Nutrition Connection), Cornell Dogwatch, and Cornell Catwatch.

History Hale Ranch was founded in 1915 by farmer and homesteader Richard Farrell, and was originally known as Dickey's Place. It later passed into the ownership of Farrell's grandson, Norman Hale, and has been used as a cattle ranch ever since. The headquarters is located in Harshaw and includes multiple historic buildings, associated outbuildings, and building foundations. The most prominent of these is the James Finley House, a red brick and adobe structure originally used as the office for the Hermosa Mining Company. Because of its unusual construction—red bricks salvaged from a nearby mine—and its association with the early history of Harshaw, the James Finley House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Another historic home located on the ranch is the Norman Hale Residence, an adobe house with a tin gabled roof, part of which dates back to the 1880s. Nearby is the Mary Hale Residence, another adobe house with a tin hipped roof, built around the same time as the others and locally referred to as the \\"Lions Den\\". Further down the road is the ruin of a third adobe building that was originally owned by Ignacio \\"Nacho\\" Arias, who used it as his home and a pool hall. In addition to the old houses and outbuildings, there are the foundations of several historic structures. The most notable is that of the Hermosa Mill, which was originally built in the 1870s when mining operations began. Closer to the James Finley House is the concrete foundations of a two-room frame schoolhouse and a Catholic church built of volcanic tuff, both of which were built in the 1940s and torn down in the 1960s. A smaller rock alignment nearby was part of an assay office from the late 19th century. Two small cemeteries are also located in the area. The main cemetery to the north of the Hale Ranch headquarters and the townsite is known locally as the \\"Mexican cemetery\\", because of the many Mexican-American pioneers buried in the cemetery. A short distance away is the \\"American cemetery\\", which is located on private property and contains the graves of American pioneers, among them Richard Farrell. A few miles to the east of the Hale Ranch headquarters is another historic ranch house owned by the Hale family. Located along the San Rafael Valley road, the home was originally the headquarters for the Ernest Best Ranch, and was used as a filming location for several Western films. The opening scene of the 1971 made-for-television film \\"Wild Rovers\\", starring William Holden and Ryan O'Neal, was shot in the living room of the ranch house.

Japara without date, tonnage or other distinguishing characteristics may be confusing in wartime accounts. That ship was delivered to the War Shipping Administration on 13 December 1941 and was allocated to and operated under Army Transportation Corps charter agreement, redelivered to Rotterdamsche Lloyd for charter to the Transportation Corps and then, in 1946, under Netherlands Ministry of Shipping, again placed under charter to the U.S. Army Transportation Corps (MARAD Vessel Status Card). Japara of 1930 played an important logistics role in the New Guinea Campaign. World War II Japara was one of twenty-one KPM vessels that took refuge in Australian ports after the fall of Java that Dutch officials requested be put into service for the war effort. The ship, among others, was chartered by the Chief Quartermaster, U.S. Army Forces in Australia (USAFIA) on 26 March 1942 with long term details to be negotiated at higher levels to become part of the U.S. Army's local fleet crewed by its KPM officers and men with an Army local fleet number of X-18 being assigned until released from the fleet May 1945. Japara and escorted by were due in Milne Bay on the evening of 11 September, days after the surface raid that had sunk , when reports of another possible surface raid developing caused the convoy to hold until the morning of 12 September when it entered Milne Bay at about six in the morning. The transports finished unloading and departed for Townsville under escort of Arunta and on 15 September. LILLIPUT area of operations. Logistical support of Allied offensive operations on the north coast of New Guinea by sea required establishment of a port west of Milne Bay at Oro Bay and a route by which large ships could pass through the largely uncharted and hazardous waters between. Small vessels transporting supplies in the early stages and survey vessels found that route and convoys code named Operation Lilliput were put into place to run two large ships under escort of one or two corvettes to Oro Bay in what were termed \\"flights\\" and given numbers. Japara was in a convoy of nine ships that departed Townsville 15 November 1942 that split on 17 November into a contingent going to Port Moresby and four, Japara, , and J. B. Ashe under escort of corvettes headed to Milne Bay with the three Dutch ships to become the first \\"flights\\" of Lilliput. A section of the Oro Bay-Dobodura road. Japara, escorted by , departed Oro Bay on 18 December on the voyage starting Operation Lilliput transporting U.S. Army port and engineer troops from Gili Gili at Milne Bay to Oro Bay that were to establish a functioning port and to construct a road from that shipping terminus to the new airfields at Dobodura which would make it possible to support and base bombers and fighters north of the Owen Stanley Range. The ship arrived with the troops, 750 tons of cargo, Australian pontoon barges to form a new docking facility and the Commander, Combined Operational Service Command (COSC) detachment for Oro Bay that would operate the growing port on the night of 19 December and was unloaded and away from danger by daylight. Japara returned to Oro Bay on the night of 26 December with the remainder of the U.S. troops to operate the port and build the Dobodura road and a troop of Stuart light tanks to supplement those arriving earlier in and two brought in by on 23 December.

It has one unnamed tributary and there are two lakes in the watershed. Course Ashelman Run begins in a large pond in Sugarloaf Township, on the southern base of Central Mountain. It flows southwest for several hundred feet, crossing Pennsylvania Route 118. The stream then turns south-southeast. After a few tenths of a mile, it receives an unnamed tributary from the left. Some distance further downstream, the stream reaches its confluence with Coles Creek. Ashelman Run joins Coles Creek upstream of its mouth. Tributaries Ashelman Run has no named tributaries. However, it does have one unnamed tributary. Geography, geology, and watershed The elevation near the mouth of Ashelman Run is above sea level. The elevation of the stream's source is between above sea level. For most of its length, Ashelman Run flows over a glacial till known as the Wisconsinan Till. This glacial till is typically more than thick. However, the stream's lower reaches are on alluvium containing stratified silt, sand, and gravel. The alluvium is approximately thick.

It was developed by Spike Chunsoft and Atlus, and published by Atlus in Japan on March 5, 2015 and Atlus USA in North America on April 7, 2015. It was published by NIS America in Europe on September 11, 2015. The game is a crossover between Atlus' Etrian Odyssey series, and Spike Chunsoft's Mystery Dungeon series.  Gameplay  The game features the character customization and character class system from the Etrian Odyssey series, and the dungeon crawling from the Mystery Dungeon series; the player's party, which is made up of custom-made characters, ventures into randomly generated multi-floor dungeons, with the objective to reach the end of each dungeon. Only the party leader is directly controlled by the player, while the other characters follow along, attacking enemies and providing support. The game is turn-based; each time the player performs an action, including moving one space on the map, attacking, or using an item, enemies will also move or attack. When the player's party is not engaged in combat, each turn the party makes will make the characters' health regenerate a little, but will also make their hunger go up. There are various classes to choose from during character creation, which determine the characters' roles in the party: for instance, the Protector class has a high defense stat and is capable of attracting the attention from enemies who might otherwise attack the other characters, the Medic class is capable of healing or reviving wounded characters, and the Gunner class specializes in ranged attacks and is capable of \\"binding\\" enemies' body parts, thereby hindering them from moving or attacking. If the player gets a game over, their party is sent back to the town outside the dungeons; additionally, the player loses all their in-game money and items. However, if the player has set up a manned fortress in the dungeon, they can attempt to lead the characters from the fortress to the fallen party, and attempt to rescue them. Some enemies, referred to as D.O.E.s, are much stronger than normal enemies, and will attempt to escape the dungeon and attack the town outside. If they succeed, the player will get a game over, and certain facilities in the town will be destroyed and rendered unusable by the player for some time; it is up to the player to protect the town by fighting these enemies. When doing so, the player may set up various kinds of fortresses, some of which will buff the party's stats. These fortresses can either be left empty, or be manned by the player's characters. Even empty fortresses can be used as a way of protecting the town from D.O.E.s; if the D.O.E. manages to destroy a fortress, it will stop its attempt at reaching the town, and return to the bottom floor of the dungeon.  Development  The game was developed by Spike Chunsoft and Atlus, the developers of the Mystery Dungeon and Etrian Odyssey series, respectively, with most of the actual development done at Spike Chunsoft, while Atlus acted as supervisors. The game was directed by Yukari Yokoro and Seiichiro Nagahata, and produced by Shigeo Komori. Background designs were handled by Nizo Yamamoto, while character design was split between Kaoru Hasegawa who designed the character classes, and Shin Nagasawa who designed the enemies; additionally, some character designs from previous Etrian Odyssey games, done by Yuji Himukai, were brought back for Etrian Mystery Dungeon. During development, both the companies would continuously share their most recent data on a shared server, and discuss details of the game direction using an instant messaging program; additionally, they would hold weekly meetings during which they made various arrangements for the game, and every month during development, Spike Chunsoft would send their latest playable build to Atlus, who would check the direction the game was going in. Character classes that were brought in from the two series had to be carefully considered in order to maintain game balance and to avoid overlap with other classes; for instance, the Gunner class was chosen to be the \\"ranged attacker\\" class of the game rather than the similar Survivalist class—a class introduced in the first Etrian Odyssey game—as the Survivalists in addition to their ranged attacks have several skills that assist with dungeon exploration, and thus would overlap with the abilities of the Wanderer class - a class based on the player character in the Mystery Dungeon: Shiren the Wanderer series. Another class that was considered for the \\"ranged attacker\\" role was the Arbalist—a class from Etrian Odyssey III: The Drowned City—but due to its high damage output it would have been very difficult to balance the game had it been included. Another factor in choosing the Gunner was that it already was a popular class in the Etrian Odyssey series, and had been made into figurines in Japan.  Localization  Atlus USA, the American subsidiary of Atlus, began work on an English localization of the game before development had finished, resulting in an English release only a month after the original Japanese release. According to an interview with Atlus USA localization editor Nich Maragos and PR manager John Hardin, this was \\"kind of a hassle\\" because of the risk of having to redo localization work as the developers make changes to the game, but ultimately worth it since they could release the game in English much sooner than had they waited for development to finish.  Music  The game's score was composed and arranged by Yuzo Koshiro, with Takeshi Yanagawa arranging an additional 10 tracks. In addition to new compositions, the soundtrack also includes arranged music from previous Etrian Odyssey games. An original soundtrack release, titled Sekaiju to Fushigi no Dungeon Original Sound Track, was published by 5pb. Records and released in Japan on April 22, 2015.  Release  The game was released by Atlus on March 5, 2015, in Japan, and on April 7, 2015, in North America. The game was published in Europe by NIS America on September 11, 2015. The first print of the Japanese release came bundled with a copy of an Etrian Mystery Dungeon themed issue of Marukatsu Super Famicom—a Japanese video game magazine that had not been in print since its final issue 23 years previously—titled Marukatsu Super Famicom 2015 Revival Edition, including 52 pages of information and artwork related to the game, as well as a soundtrack CD with six songs from the game. Similarly, the first print of the North American release came with a set of bonus items titled \\"The Sights and Sounds of Mystery\\", which includes a soundtrack CD with rearranged versions of six songs from the game; a 28-page book with artwork from the game as well as information intended to help the player with forming their party in the game; and a box that holds the game and the items. Players of the North American version were able to get five pieces of downloadable content for free during the first month following the game's release. Since the end of that period, the content is available for purchase for players who did not download it during the first month.  Reception  The game has been mostly positively received, with an aggregate score of 77/100 on Metacritic. Famitsu gave the game a score of 34/40 in their review, with the sub-scores 8, 8, 9, and 9.  Sales  Etrian Mystery Dungeon was the second highest selling video game in Japan during its opening week, with 65,226 copies sold and 91.96% of the initial shipment sold out.

It closed in 2006 after 112 years as an Anglican place of worship. History and description St James the Great was designed by architect Colonel E. M. Bruce Vaughan. It was built between 1890 and 1894, replacing an earlier iron church. Bruce-Vaughan's church is described as his \\"major work\\" and took some inspiration from the nearby St German's Church in Adamsdown (particularly the high, wide chancel) but with the noticeable addition of a \\"finely composed\\" tower and spire. It cost a substantial £10,000 to complete. Externally the church is finished with Sweldon limestone, Bath stone and ashlar while, internally, the nave pillars are alternatively round and octagonal. The carved pulpit was \\"a sumptuous piece\\" in pink, green and buff coloured stone. The gilded and painted reredos screen was early 20th- century. The church became a Grade II listed building in 1975. The church closed in 2006 and sold in 2007 by the Church in Wales for £500,000. Planning permission was granted in 2008 to create 12 one and two-bedroom flats and, in addition, a seven storey apartment in the church tower. As of 2018, construction and renovation works are still taking place by the owners after a delayed start. Important architectural fittings have been relocated, for example the font is now in the entrance hall of the next door Tredegarville Primary School and the reredos has been refitted to St Theodore's Church, Port Talbot.

Museo del Prado, Madrid The Fountain of Life or The Fountain of Grace and the Triumph of the Church over the Synagogue are names given to an oil on panel painting completed c 1432. For most of its history the painting has been in Spain, latterly in the Museo del Prado which recently featured it in a special exhibition. Stylistically and thematically, the painting is related to the work of Jan van Eyck, but it is unsigned and there have been competing theories as to whether it is by van Eyck himself. The subject matter of the painting would have been of particular interest in 15th century Spain which had the world's largest Jewish community. There has been recent speculation that it was painted by van Eyck himself, possibly while he was on a diplomatic mission to the Iberian peninsula. However, technical analysis suggests that it was painted in the Netherlands, albeit possibly in response to a commission from Spain, in van Eyck's workshop. The Fountain of Life closely resembles passages in the 1432 Ghent Altarpiece by Jan and his brother Hubert.Ridderbos et al, 58 Although there is consensus among specialists that it is the product of a workshop, some attribute The Fountain of Life to a youthful Jan, his brother Hubert,Borchert, 71 or much later, and less likely, Petrus Christus.Ferrari, 132 The painting is structured into three levels. The top terrace shows a Deësis of God the Son, the Virgin Mary and St. John the Evangelist. The middle section shows four groups of angels, while the lower level has two groups of holy men; with Christians led by a Pope and princes to the right, and Jews led by blindfolded high priests to the left. These two groups represent true believers and non true believers in Christ as the messiah respectively.Devonshire Jones et al, 213 The Fountain of Life is a symbol referring to baptism and or eucharist. The water that flows from the top to the lower terrace, is intended as a symbol of \\"the Grace that illuminates the Triumphant Church and blinds the Synagogue\\".The Fountain of Grace and the Triumph of the Church over the Synagogue. Museo del Prado. Retrieved 22 December 2014. Description The painting is organised into three horizontal levels or planes, each showing a terrace on which the figures are positioned. Upper terrace The top level shows a Deësis scene, with God the Father in the center, flanked by the Virgin Mary and St. John the Evangelist. This passage closely resembles a similar scene in the Ghent Altarpiece. All three figures are seated in front of hanging oriental style carpets. Detail showing the Virgin Mary God holds a staff in his left hand, and holds up his right up in the act of blessing. He is enthroned within a tall, elaborate Gothic architectural setting. His throne contains symbols of the Evangelists, while the baldachin around and above him is decorated with illusionistic painted reliefs of Old Testament prophets intended to look like sculptures. The lamb sits on a pedestal before God, on a structure through which the water of grace,Colas, 61 symbolising the rite of baptism, flows before reaching the fountain of life in the lowest terrace.Roth, 56 Mary is seated and reading a red book, probably a book of hours. She wears a blue gown, the folds and cloth of which are closely detailed. She has blond hair which is unbraided and falls over her shoulders. In contrast to her depiction in the Ghent Altarpiece, here her dress is plain, lacks any embroidery or gilded lining, while her book is not girdled. John is dressed in a green robe, also has blond hair and sits writing in a holy book. Middle terrace Detail showing musical angels Detail from the \\"Musical Angels\\" panel of the Ghent Altarpiece, before 1432 The middle level shows two groups of musical angels dressed in white robes and sitting on grass. Choirs of singing angels are positioned in towers on either side of them. This section is again similar to a panel in the Ghent Altarpiece. The instruments include a harp, a type of viol and a lute. Lower terrace The lower section represents the triumph of the Church over the Jewish Synagogue, through the depiction of the Christians as collect as almost serene, and the Jews as chaotic, blinded and resistant. The fountain of life is positioned in the center, with a group of Christians to its left, including a Pope (possibly Martin V), members of his service, an emperor and various princes. Detail showing the blinded High Priest in the lower terrace To the right is a grouping of \\"despairing Jews\\" who seem to be fleeing from the scene. The figure on the far left of this group is a high priest who has been blindfolded, symbolising his blinding to the true significance of Jesus.Benjamin, 163 A rabbi in the immediate foreground holds a Torah scroll with, according to historian Norman Roth, \\"gibberish Hebrew writing\\", while another \\"Jew shows a scroll to a figure, apparently Christian, who tears his clothing at the sight\\". In contrast to the Christians, the Jews do not wear grand, ceremonious hats or badges. They carry a variety of banners, scrolls and parchments, which contains texts that while illegible, can be recognised as mostly written in Hebrew, with some lettering that is almost nonsensical. The texts are arranged across the passage in a haphazard way, reflecting the disorder of the figures, and more generally within the Synagogue.Benjamin, 162 This placement must be contrasted with those on the two level, where the books held by Mary and John rest stably on their laps. Provenance The painting's first documentary record is in the Libro becerro (vellum acquisitions register) of the Monastery of the Parral outside Segovia, which recorded it as the gift of King Henry IV of Castile in 1454. That year marked the beginning of Henry's reign, as well as a building programme at the monastery. He may have inherited the painting from his father John II. It was secured to the wall of the vestry, being gradually painted into the wall as the vestry was redecorated down the centuries, until it was removed in 1838 as part of the secularisation of the monasteries: parts of the border were lost in the removal but the painting is generally in good condition. The painting was moved to the Trinidade monastery opposite the Atocha station in Madrid, used as a general store for the religious wealth collected. The painting was photographed in 1859 by Jean Laurent. Its first formal attribution was in 1870 when it was transferred to the Prado, dating it as 1454 on the strength of the entry: however, it was stylistically anachronistic, an accurate dating should have read \\"before 1454\\", a mistake which has caused no end of confusion in the 130 years following as scholars attempted to identify a non-existent atelier or pupil/follower of van Eyck's. Following a dendrochronological study undertaken by the Prado in the late 1990s, which dated the felling of the wood to 1418, it was dated to \\"after 1428\\" after allowing a standard ten years for seasoning: the Prado currently attributes it to c1432. During the time in the Parral, it became highly influential and was widely copied, one copy was later housed in Palencia Cathedral. Today it is in the collection of the Museo del Prado, Madrid. The Prado version was the star of an exhibition of its reassessments in 2003, and it was previously the subject of the 1957 Utrecht doctoral thesis of Josua Bruyn, who went on to become Professor of the History of Art at Amsterdam and establish the Rembrandt Foundation.

In cricket, a five-wicket haul (also known as a \\"five–for\\" or \\"fifer\\") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement, and as of August 2015 only 43 bowlers have taken 15 or more five-wicket hauls at the international level. Craig John McDermott is a former Australian cricketer who, according to the sports journalist Greg Baum, was \\"Australia's premier strike bowler in the early 1990s\\". A right-arm fast bowler, he played 71 Test matches and 138 ODIs in his career, taking 291 and 203 wickets respectively. He took fourteen five-wicket hauls in Test cricket, including two in a single ten-wicket match, and one in the ODI format. McDermott made his Test match debut for Australia against the West Indies at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in December 1984, with Richie Richardson being his first Test victim. His first Test five-wicket haul came at Lord's in the second Test of the 1985 Ashes series in June of that year, taking 6 wickets for 70 runs in a 4-wicket victory for Australia. McDermott's best bowling analysis in Test cricket is 8 for 97 against England in the fifth Test of the 1990–91 Ashes series. He was most successful against England, taking eight of his fourteen five-wicket hauls against them, including four during the 1994–95 Ashes in which he was named player of the series. McDermott's ODI debut came against the West Indies at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in January 1985. He did not bat and although he took the wicket of Viv Richards, Australia lost the game by seven wickets. McDermott played 138 ODIs, and took a solitary five-wicket haul against Pakistan in November 1987, in the Cricket World Cup semi-final. His figures of 5 for 44, and an Australian victory by 18 runs, saw him awarded man of the match as Australia progressed to the final. Key { border=\\"1\\" |- ! Symbol !

American Publishers Association, 1915, p. 381. She graduated from the Cooper Female Seminary in Dayton, Ohio, and studied at the Library School of Albany, New York.  Career  Doren began work at the Dayton Metro Library, known at the time as the Dayton Public Library, in 1879. In 1897, she became the library system's director and instituted a number of new programs, including a school library department, a library training school and a reorganization that saw titles for the first time filed using the Dewey Decimal System. The institution of the Dewey Decimal System opened the library for public use for the first time and allowed for the country's first book wagon service, which took books to rural areas of the community. Doren left Dayton in 1905 and became the first director of the Western Reserve University Library School. Following the Great Dayton Flood (part of the Great Flood of 1913), she returned to Dayton as chief librarian until her death in 1927, where she aided library staff in recovering items damaged by the flood, allowing the library to reopen just three months after the flood waters receded. During her two terms as chief librarian, she expanded the collection from 36,000 books to 185,000 and increased the budget from $64,000 to $225,000. During World War I, she was a member of the Committee of the American Library Association, where she chose books that soldiers at home and in active duty could read. Doren later founded the Ohio Library Association, serving for a year as its president, and was a vice president with the American Library Association.  Death and legacy  She died on March 4, 1927.

The ship of was launched 31 August 1909 and delivered 29 October 1909 for operation by Koninklijke Paketvaart-Maatschappij (KPM) in the Dutch East Indies trade. During World War I Van Heemskerk, then at Singapore, came under the Shipping Controller, London for wartime operation by British India Steam Navigation Co. Ltd., London until returned to KPM in 1919. Van Heemskerk was one of twenty- one KPM vessels that took refuge in Australian ports after the fall of Java that Dutch officials requested be put into service for the war effort. The ship, among others, was chartered by the Chief Quartermaster, U.S. Army Forces in Australia (USAFIA) on 26 March 1942 with long term details to be negotiated at higher levels to become part of the U.S. Army's local fleet crewed by its KPM officers and men without an Army local fleet \\"X\\" number being assigned.

On December 26 and 27, while at Merauke, New Guinea, the ship was bombed by a Japanese float plane suffering seven casualties. LILLIPUT area of operations. Logistical support of Allied offensive operations on the north coast of New Guinea by sea required establishment of a port west of Milne Bay at Oro Bay and a route by which large ships could pass through the largely uncharted and hazardous waters between. Small vessels transporting supplies in the early stages and survey vessels found that route and convoys code named Operation Lilliput were put into place to run two large ships under escort of one or two corvettes to Oro Bay in what were termed \\"flights\\" and given numbers. Van Heemskerk took part in a simultaneous, specialized operation code named Accountant that was to transport the United States Army 162nd Regiment, 41st Division, from Australia to the Buna-Gona operations area. The ship was then to join the regular Lilliput convoy system as flight number 28. Loss Van Heemskerk and arrived at Milne Bay under escort of on 14 April 1943 just as the twenty-fourth air raid on that port was developing and after being diverted from Port Moresby due to air raids there. The ship discharged the embarked troops but still had cargo of ammunition and fuel to be unloaded and not enough time to clear the bay. The U.S. troop commander left an improvised defense of twenty U.S. soldiers who placed a jeep with mounted .50 caliber machine gun on each hatch for defense until, after surviving four masthead level attacks, a hit in a hold containing ammunition and fuel destroyed the jeeps and crews. Despite efforts of and her crew to control the fire the ship blew up at about five in the afternoon with four killed, the last casualty of Lilliput.

Taxonomic history The genus Hedstroemia was named in 1978. The type species designated was Hedstroemia delicatus, which had originally been described as Proetus delicatus in 1923. In 1990 the subgenus Pachyproetus was proposed to accommodate a single species, P. pachydermata. In 1994, the genus Milesdavis was proposed based on incomplete fossils consisting of the pygidium (rear segment) of three individuals. The genus was named after musician Miles Davis, and the type species, Milesdavis eldredgei, was named in honor of the paleontologist Niles Eldredge. In 1997, Milesdavis and the subgenus Pachyproetus were recognized as junior synonyms of Hedstroemia, by paleontologist Jonathan Adrain, who regarded the type species of both as ingroup Hedstroemia. Species Several species of Hedstroemia are recognized, and other species are questionably assigned to the genus.

W. 1996. Niebla and Vermilacinia (Ramalinaceae) from California and Baja California. Sida Bot. Misc. 14 The epithet, flagelliforma is in reference to the individual branches of the thallus shaped like a flagellum. Distinguishing Features Niebla flagelliforma is easily recognized by a thallus—up to 6 cm high and 3 cm across—divided from a holdfast into narrow erect branches that terminate—after branching one or more times—in flagelliform branchlets. The cortex of the thallus, which covers a partially hollow medulla, has conspicuous and closely reticulate ridges, often cracking along the transverse ridges, and becomes thinner towards apex, 75–25 µm thick. This thinning of the cortex and the development of a subfistulose medulla probably relates to the coiling of the branches. Black dot-like pycnidia are abundant on the flagelliform branchlets, each pycnidiumPycnidium (pycnidia plural) is a small flash-shaped structure (200–300 µm wide near the base in Niebla) that produces conidia, which escape through an opening (ostiole) at the top and function in reproduction, asexually or sexually is surrounded by a cortical margin similar to the thalline margin of an apothecium. The key lichen substance is divaricatic acid (with triterpenes and usnic acid). Niebla flagelliforma is frequent in wind-sheltered areas inland from the coast on the northern peninsula of Baja California, generally south of Campo Nuevo, but also occurs around Bahía de San Quintín and nearby Isla San Martín.Isla San Martin, MapCarta, retrieved 22 Dec 2014, http://mapcarta.com/20316724 Taxonomic History Niebla flagelliforma was recognized as distinct from Niebla homalea, 1 May 1985, following a sample of N. homalea collected 29 April 1985 on Punta Banda in Baja California; N. flagelliforma was collected by Richard Spjut and Richard Marin (S & M 9058A) near Rosarito along Baja Mexico Highway 1, 33 km south of junction with road to Bahía de los Angeles, on rocks of north-facing slopes in the understory of dense brush. A sample of 110 grams was submitted to the National Cancer Institute, Natural Products Branch for their natural product screening program in search of new compounds to treat HIV and cancer; the sample was accessioned as WBA-122, and identified as “Niebla sp. (undscribed) rock ‘ceruchis’ type.”Samples of lichens were collected from the Eastern and Western regions of the United States and Baja California, Mexico during 1985 for anti-HIV screening. Prior to 1982, samples for antitumor screening were supplied in 1 kilogram (kg) quantity (dried) to the NCI by the USDA Agricultural Research Service. In October 1982, the funding for this cooperative agreement was terminated. World Botanical Associates (WBA) was formed by Richard Spjut in May 1983 to continue to supply samples for antitumor screening. Lichens were considered a potential novel source for new anti-HIV drugs since they had rarely been collected for the NCI antitumor screening program. Richard Spjut, the Senior Partner of WBA, proposed that the NCI reduce their 1 kg quantity to 25 grams in order to obtain a broad diversity of lichen samples. The NCI group maintains an inventory of natural product extracts with details on the collection data. Voucher specimens are deposited at the United States National Herbarium (Smithsonian Institution), http://botany.si.edu/colls/collections_overview.htm and cited in Spjut's 1996 revision of the genus under N. flagelliforma. The species was described in 1996. It has been since included under an extremely broad interpretation of Niebla homalea;Bowler, P. and J. Marsh. 2004.

Construction Dr. Károly Szendy, the mayor of the Hungarian capital, ordered the construction of an emergency hospital and reinforced bomb shelter under Buda Castle. Construction began in 1939 and the emergency surgical centre was completed in 1944. Its primary role was to provide general emergency care for injured civilians, later on they treated soldiers as well. Anybody could get treatment here, regardless of their gender, race, religion or ethnicity. The chief nurse of the Hungarian Red Cross, Countess Edelsheim-Gyulai Ilona, was there at the time of the opening and worked in the hospital as a nurse. The hospital was staffed by approximately 40 doctors, nurses, and assistants together. The hospital tunnel system was connected to an existing tunnel network by manual labor. The original system had been in use by various inhabitants of the castle for many years, and was said to have been part of a penal system in centuries past. 1944-45 Siege of Budapest During the Siege of Budapest, the hospital handled the wounded and dead. Bodies were sent out of the hospital at night and buried in bomb craters. The hospital was without food or medicine at some points during the siege, with staff having to recycle supplies by taking them from corpses and sterilizing them before reuse. Eventually, horses were brought in and killed for food. The hospital was designed to treat 60-70 patients, but at one point was being used to treat 600 wounded soldiers. Both civilians and soldiers were treated in the hospital with a separate ward for women. German soldiers were also treated in the hospital but they mostly stayed in their own part of the cave system. Swabian Hungarian soldiers who were forcibly conscripted and got into the Waffen-SS groups were also treated in the hospital. The facility had its own generators, so they could X-ray patients even during the siege of Budapest, when it was impossible in other hospitals. The hospital was one of the most advanced of its time with state of the art surgical equipment. Doctors saved the lives of thousands of civilians and soldiers. On the day of the break-out, able patients left the hospital. Those who were unable to evacuate themselves were transported home or to overground hospitals. 1946-1957 After the siege, the hospital was only used once more, in 1956, in response to the uprising against the Soviet rule. After that, the hospital functioned as a prison for a short period before being re-purposed as a nuclear bunker, but one dedicated to keeping 200 doctors and nurses safe and available to treat the wounded. Nobody ever took up residence in the bunker, except for a caretaker and his wife. Because of this, the hospital museum now has a collection of anti-radiation kits, as well as some Soviet spying equipment, on display. 1958-1962 Between 1958-62, the hospital equipment was upgraded to take account of the risk of a chemical or nuclear attack. A water tank, a ventilation and poison gas-filtering system were installed. Two Ganz diesel engines were also built to power electrical generators. Engineers such as István Bakonyi contributed to the planning and supervision. 1962-2007 The hospital became part of the civil defense infrastructure and was classified as \\"Top Secret\\". Only members of John's Hospital – doctors and nurses – were assigned as staff to survive a nuclear strike. People inside the hospital could probably have survived for 72 hours after a chemical or nuclear attack. Then, according to the plan, there should have been three week partial period quarantine. The hospital was equipped with ventilation fans equipped with poison gas filters. The facility became obsolete at the end of the 1960s because of the fast development of technology. The Szabó Family were replaced by the Mohácsi family in 1967. They lived in a lodging in the foreground and maintained the hospital until 2004. Mr. Mohácsi was a mechanic: he checked the equipment daily and aired the place. Mrs. Mohácsi did the cleaning every second week of 2,400 square meters and made 200 beds. Nobody ventured to close the hospital so the maintenance of the civil defense places was handled secretly during the rule of the Hungarian Communist Party. The costs were hidden in the budget of the John's Hospital. The members of the John's Hospital came here for yearly practice until the middle of 1980s while maintaining secrecy. The facility was occasionally used by the Krétakör Theatre between 2004 and 2006. On the European Heritage Days in 2006, the hospital could be visited. Modernization and restoration started in 2007. Present day In recent times, the hospital has been made into a museum, complete with waxwork recreations of hospital treatments and day-to- day scenarios during the siege. Access to the museum is limited to guided tours. Old equipment that was left over from its operational days is available for sale, including stretchers, gas masks and civil protection uniforms.

At 10:20 a.m., the British Aerospace ATP, named Graciosa, while enroute to Horta, collided with Pico da Esperança, on the central mountains of the island of São Jorge, resulting in the deaths of all passengers and crew (totalling 35 people). Flight On 11 December 1999, the British Aerospace ATP (CS-TGM) with 35 people aboard, began flight SP530M from Ponta Delgada (on the island of São Miguel) to Horta (on the island of Faial, as part of the first leg of the wider Ponta Delgada to Flores flight. The flight departed at 9:37 a.m. from Ponta Delgada, with a planned flight level of feet and cruising speed of 260 knots, with an estimated 51 minutes flight time. The meteorological information (submitted by the Instituto Meteorlogia) forecast between the hours of midnight and 6:00 a.m. in the islands of the Azores indicated a superficial cold front, with heavy clouds, moderate southwesterly winds changing to strong northerly winds, but generally weak in the central and western groups of the Azores. Wind strength for the itinerary ranged from 30 to 45 knots. Accident A view of the Pico da Esperança on the island of São Jorge where the fatal accident occurred During the course, the crew decided to alter their flight plan, opting for a route that included approach descent over the channel between the islands of Pico and São Jorge, to intercept the 250 degree VOR/VFL Horta radial. Horta tower initially cleared the flight to FL100 , but the crew then requested (and were cleared) to descend to with instructions to maintain visual contact with the island of Pico. At 10:03 a,m., the co-pilot had contacted the Santa Maria control tower to communicate it was passing the LIMA-MIKE waypoint. The flight was planned for a route direct to Horta, but when the crew reported their position as LIMA-MIKE, the ATP had already drifted 14 nautical miles from its course: the crew did not indicate their awareness of diversion. About 43 nautical miles from Horta, the crew was authorized by the Horta tower to descend to and indicated their visual contact with Pico. During the descent, heavy rain and turbulence were encountered. The flight continued their course as they descended, crossing the north coast of the island of São Jorge. But the crew had lost situational awareness: could not distinguish their barometric altitudes from the radio altimeter indicators. The crew only realized that they were overflying the island from the verbal indication by the co-pilot and the final audible sound of the GPWS. Five seconds after the first alarm by the GPWS, the co-pilot reacted by pulling back on the throttles, and eight seconds following the alarm, the motors reacted. The plane began to recover its altitude and turned to the left. Seven minutes (10:17 a.m.) after initiating the descent, the left wing of the ATP impacted the northern hillside and eastern flank of Pico da Esperança and separated from the fuselage, at approximately altitude on the island of São Jorge. The plane had continued its crash trajectory, rolling along a longitudinal path and inverting towards the sea before crashing. The GPWS alerted the crew 17 seconds before impact. No emergency call was received from the aircraft before it went down. There was no fire. Aftermath The memorial cross to Father Júlio Soares, parish priest, who died in the SATA Air Açores accident A memorial plaque with the names of the victims of SP530 located on the summit of Pico da Esperança Rescue teams reached the wreckage more than four hours after the ATP crashed on Sao Jorge, where it scattered debris and victims across a dense ravine. The search was called off after dark, and only resumed on Sunday, when the investigation team was sent to the isolated crash site from the mainland. Seven bodies were recovered as rescuers using ropes and carrying stretchers, who scrambled over the steep mountainside before nightfall. Similarly, a thick mist shrouded the area, which was inaccessible to vehicles, making difficult the search operation. Although the Portuguese Air Force helicopters were on standby to winch out any survivors, the time spent meant that the searchers were only there to \\"collect the bodies and examine the causes of the accident\\", since there was \\"no hope of finding survivors\\", from the comments of Internal Affairs Minister Fernando Gomes. All SATA flights were canceled after the crash. Portuguese Prime Minister António Guterres, who was in Helsinki, Finland, for a European Union summit, cancelled a planned visit to Kosovo and headed straight for the Azores. SATA arranged flights to the islands for international relatives of crash victims. Report The final report by the commission of inquiry by the National Institute of Civil Aviation () concluded that the flight had made a slight deviation from its route to Horta, that was not perceptible by the flight crew. This deviation crossed the northern coast of the island of São Jorge, where it crashed into Pico de Esperança. The crew \\"was completely convinced\\" that the plane was over the São Jorge Channel, and they were concentrated on meteorological conditions at the time of the collision. After hearing their impact warning, three seconds before the first impact, the copilot alerted the crew that they were \\"losing altitude and over São Jorge\\". But, even as the pilots increased engine output, the maneuver was \\"insufficient to overcome the obstacle\\". The conclusion of the report indicated that there was a lack of rigour in maintaining the prescribed safe altitude, inaccurate dead reckoning, lack of cross-checking the information of the radio altimeter and barometric altimeter, and improper use of airborne weather radar as an additional ease of navigation, all of which contributed to the disaster. The bad meteorological conditions on the day (which included clouds, moderate to heavy winds, with turbulence) and the lack of autonomous navigational aids aboard the aircraft (such as GPS), that could have determined their position, were also factors that contributed to the accident. In regards to the aircraft, the report determined that the ATP was operating within the navigational conditions correspondent to the regulations and approved procedures outlined by aeronautical authorities. José Estima, member of the directorate of the APPLA Associação Portuguesa de Pilotos de Linha Aérea (Portuguese Airline Pilots Association) stated that the factor that contributed to the accident of the SATA commuter was \\"a quality and quantity of infrastructures to support aerial navigation\\". Referring to the credibility of the plane's pilot, APPLA indicated that the \\"pilot had flown for more than 20 years in the archipelago\\" and recorded that SATA pilots \\"are at the forefront, since they work in these adverse [local] conditions\\".
