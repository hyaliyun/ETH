(1999). How People Learn: Bridging Research and Practice. Washington, DC: National Academy of Sciences. It refers to a \\"wide variety of educational and instructional techniques focused on connecting what students are taught in school to real-world issues, problems, and applications. The basic idea is that students are more likely to be interested in what they are learning, more motivated to learn new concepts and skills, and better prepared to succeed in college, careers, and adulthood if what they are learning mirrors real-life contexts, equips them with practical and useful skills, and addresses topics that are relevant and applicable to their lives outside of school.\\"Authentic Learning. (n.d.) The Glossary of Education Reform. Retrieved from http://edglossary.org/authentic-learning . Authentic instruction will take on a much different form than traditional teaching methods. In the traditional classroom, students take a passive role in the learning process. Knowledge is considered to be a collection of facts and procedures that are transmitted from the teacher to the student. In this view, the goal of education is to possess a large collection of these facts and procedures.Sawyer, K. (2006). The Cambridge Handbook of the Learning Sciences. New York, NY: Cambridge University Press. Authentic learning, on the other hand, takes a constructivist approach, in which learning is an active process. Teachers provide opportunities for students to construct their own knowledge through engaging in self-directed inquiry, problem solving, critical thinking, and reflections in real-world contexts. This knowledge construction is heavily influenced by the student's prior knowledge and experiences, as well as by the characteristics that shape the learning environment, such as values, expectations, rewards, and sanctions. Education is more student-centered. Students no longer simply memorize facts in abstract and artificial situations, but they experience and apply information in ways that are grounded in reality.Newmann, F., Marks, H., & Gamoran, A. (1995). Authentic pedagogy: Standards that boost student performance. Issues in Restructuring Schools, 8, 1-12.  Characteristics  There is no definitive description of authentic learning. Educators must develop their own interpretations of what creates meaning for the students in their classrooms.Maina, F. (2004). Authentic learning: Perspectives from contemporary educators. Journal of Authentic Learning. Retrieved from https://dspace.sunyconnect.suny.edu/bitstream/handle/1951/389/maina.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed;=y . However, the literature suggests that there are several characteristics of authentic learning. It is important to note that authentic learning tasks do not have to have all the characteristics. They can be thought of as being on a spectrum, with tasks being more or less authentic. The characteristics of authentic learning include the following: *Authentic learning is centered on authentic, relevant, real-world tasks that are of interest to the learners. *Students are actively engaged in exploration and inquiry. *Learning, most often, is interdisciplinary. It requires integration of content from several disciplines and leads to outcomes beyond the domain-specific learning outcomes. *Learning is closely connected to the world beyond the walls of the classroom. *Students become engaged in complex tasks and higher-order thinking skills, such as analyzing, synthesizing, designing, manipulating, and evaluating information. *Learning begins with a question or problem, which cannot be constricting in that it allows the student to construct their own response and inquiry. The outcome of the learning experience cannot be predetermined. *Students produce a product that can be shared with an audience outside the classroom. These products have value in their own right, rather than simply for earning a grade. * The resulting products are concrete allowing them to be shared and critiqued; this feedback allows the learner to be reflective and deepen their learning. *Learning is student driven, with tutors, peers, teachers, parents, and outside experts all assisting and coaching in the learning process. *Learners employ instructional scaffolding techniques at critical times. *Students have opportunities for social discourse, collaboration, and reflection. *Ample resources are available. *Assessment of authentic learning is integrated seamlessly within the learning task in order to reflect similar, real world assessments. This is known as authentic assessment and is in contrast to traditional learning assessments in which an exam is given after the knowledge or skills have hopefully been acquired. *Authentic learning provides students with the opportunity to examine the problem from different perspectives, which allows for competing solutions and a diversity of outcomes instead of one single correct answer.Herrington, J., & Oliver, R. (2000). An instructional design framework for authentic learning environments. Educational Technology Research and Development, 48 (3), 23-48.Lombardi, M. (2007). Authentic learning for the 21st century: An overview. EduCause Learning Initiative. ELI Paper 1:2007. Mims, C. (2003). Authentic learning: A practical introduction and guide for implementation. The Meridian Journal,6 (1), Article 6.Rule, A. (2006). The components of authentic learning. Journal of Authentic Learning, 3 (1), 1-10. *Students are provided the opportunity for articulation of their learning process and/or final learning product.  Five standards  While there has been much attention given to educational standards for curriculum and assessment, \\"the standards for instruction tend to focus on procedural and technical aspects, with little attention to more fundamental standards of quality.\\"Newmann, F. & Wehlage, G. (1993). Five standards of authentic instruction. Educational Leadership, 50 (7), 8-12. The challenge is not simply to adopt innovative teaching techniques but to give students the opportunity to use their minds well and to provide students with instruction that has meaning or value outside of achieving success in school. In order to address this challenge, a framework consisting of five standards of authentic instruction has been developed by Wisconsin's Center on Organization and Restructuring of Schools. This framework can be a valuable tool for both researchers and teachers. It provides \\"a set of standards through which to view assignments, instructional activities, and the dialogue between teacher and students and students with one another.\\" Teachers can use the framework to generate questions, clarify goals, and critique their teaching. Each standard can be assessed on a scale of one to five rather than a categorical yes or no variable. \\"The five standards are higher-order thinking, depth of knowledge, connectedness to the world beyond the classroom, substantive conversation, and social support for student achievement.\\" *Higher-Order Thinking: This scale measures the degree to which students use higher-order thinking skills. Higher-order thinking requires students to move beyond simple recall of facts to the more complex task of manipulating information and ideas in ways that transform their meaning and implications, such as when students synthesize, generalize, explain, hypothesize, or arrive at some conclusion or interpretation. *Depth of Knowledge: This scale assesses students' depth of knowledge and understanding. Knowledge is considered deep when students are able to \\"make clear distinctions, develop arguments, solve problems, construct explanations, and otherwise work with relatively complex understandings.\\" Rather than emphasizing large quantities of fragmented information, instruction covers fewer topics in systematic and connected ways which leads to deeper understanding. *Connectedness to the World: This scale measures the extent to which the instruction has value and meaning beyond the instructional context. Instruction can exhibit connectedness when students address real- world public problems or when they use personal experiences as a context for applying knowledge. *Substantive Conversation: This scale assesses the extent of communication to learn and understand the substance of a subject. High levels of substantive conversation are indicated by three features: considerable interaction about the subject matter which includes evidence of higher-order thinking, sharing of ideas that are not scripted or controlled, and dialogue that builds on participants' ideas to promote improved collective understanding of a theme or topic. *Social Support for Student Achievement: The social support scale measures the culture of the learning community. Social support is high in classes where there are high expectations for all students, a climate of mutual respect, and inclusion of all students in the learning process. Contributions from all students are welcomed and valued.  Examples  There are several authentic learning practices in which students may participate. These are a few examples: *Simulation-Based Learning: Students engage in simulations and role-playing in order to be put in situations where the student has to actively participate in the decision making of a project. This helps in \\"developing valuable communication, collaboration, and leadership skills that would help the student succeed as a professional in the field he/she is studying.\\"Peterson, L. (2007). Authentic Learning Environments. Retrieved April 9, 2014 from http://etec.ctlt.ubc.ca/510wiki/Authentic_Learning_Environments . Learning through simulation and role-playing has been used to train flight attendants, fire fighters, and medical personnel to name a few. *Student-Created Media: Student-created media focuses on using various technologies to \\"create videos, design websites, produce animations, virtual reconstructions, and create photographs.\\" In addition to gaining valuable experience in working with a range of technologies, \\"students have also improved their reading comprehension, writing skills, and their abilities to plan, analyze, and interpret results as they progress through the media project.\\" *Inquiry-Based Learning: Inquiry-based learning starts by posing questions, problems or scenarios rather than simply presenting material to students. Students identify and research issues and questions to develop their knowledge or solutions. Inquiry-based learning is generally used in field-work, case studies, investigations, individual and group projects, and research projects. *Peer-Based Evaluation: In peer based evaluation students are given the opportunity to analyze, critique, and provide constructive feedback on the assignments of their peers. Through this process, they are exposed to different perspectives on the topic being studied, giving them a deeper understanding. *Working with Remote Instruments: Specialized software can provide students with opportunities they might not have otherwise. For example, \\"various software packages produce similar results that students working in a fully equipped lab might receive. By interpreting the software based results students are able to apply theory to practice as they interpret the data that would otherwise not be available to them.\\" *Working with Research Data: Students collect their own data or use data collected from researchers to conduct their own investigations. *Reflecting and Documenting Achievements: The importance of metacognition in the learning process is well- documented. Giving students the opportunity to reflect upon and monitor their learning is essential. Journals, portfolios, and electronic portfolios are examples of authentic learning tasks designed to showcase the student's work as well as give the student a means to reflect back on his/her learning over time. *Project-Based Learning: Begins with a problem or question that is the starting point for inquiry and which all products are created as a result of. Results in a single or series of products or artifacts that are created as a result or solution to the inquiry.  Benefits  Educational research shows that authentic learning is an effective learning approach to preparing students for work in the 21st century. By situating knowledge within relevant contexts, learning is enhanced in all four domains of learning: cognitive (knowledge), affective (attitudes), psychomotor (skills), and psychosocial (social skills). Some of the benefits of authentic learning include the following: *Students are more motivated and more likely to be interested in what they are learning when it is relevant and applicable to their lives outside of school. *Students are better prepared to succeed in college, careers, and adulthood. *Students learn to assimilate and connect knowledge that is unfamiliar. *Students are exposed to different settings, activities, and perspectives. *Transfer and application of theoretical knowledge to the world outside of the classroom is enhanced. *Students have opportunities to collaborate, produce products, and to practice problem solving and professional skills. *Students have opportunities to exercise professional judgments in a safe environment. *Students practice higher-order thinking skills. *Students develop patience to follow longer arguments. *Students develop flexibility to work across disciplinary and cultural boundaries.Benefits of Authentic Learning.

The books cover his private life and thoughts, and unleashed a media frenzy upon its release, with journalists attempting to track down the mentioned members of his family. The series has sold half a million copies in Norway alone and has been published in 35 languages.  Overview  The author, Knausg√•rd My Struggle is a six- book autobiographical series by Karl Ove Knausg√•rd outlining the \\"banalities and humiliations of his life\\", his private pleasures, and his dark thoughts; the first of the series was published in 2009. It has sold nearly 500,000 copies in Norway, or one copy for every nine Norwegian adults, and is published in 22 languages. The series is 3,600 pages long, and was finished when Knausg√•rd was in his forties. Though categorized as fiction, the books situate Knausg√•rd as the protagonist and his actual relatives as the cast, with their names mostly unchanged. The books have led some of his relatives to make public statements against their inclusion in Knausg√•rd's novels.  History  As he struggled to write a novel about his relationship with his father, Knausg√•rd set upon a new project in early 2008: to write less stylistically and deliberately and instead, to \\"write plainly about his life\\". He wrote mainly to break his block with the other novel and thought that there would not be an audience for the work. Knausg√•rd would call his friend and fellow writer Geir Angell √òygarden daily and read the work aloud. Angell √òygarden felt that Knausg√•rd needed encouragement to continue, and Knausg√•rd felt that Angell √òygarden was essential to the project. Angell √òygarden eventually listened to 5,000 pages of the novel and proposed the series title, which he felt was perfect. The novel's Norwegian title, Min Kamp, is very similar to Hitler's Mein Kampf. The book's editor, Geir Gulliksen, originally forbade Knausg√•rd from using the title, but later changed his mind. Knausg√•rd's British publisher at the time was not interested in the book, and Knausg√•rd did not protest the German translation publisher's decision to change the title in that region. In writing the first book, Knausg√•rd reflected that he did not consider the consequences of writing so candidly about his close relations until he paused on the passage about his grandmother. He circulated the first book to about ten of the largest figures in the book before its release and offered to change their names. His brother and mother did not object, but Knausg√•rd's father's family attempted legal intervention and wanted to block publication, calling the novel, \\"a book full of insinuations, untruths, false personal characteristics and disclosures\\". Knausg√•rd was scared, but fixed some errors, changed some names, removed a single person, and published the book without acquiescing to all requests. He later acknowledged that he had a choice and chose to publish \\"no matter what\\", and referred to this admission of guilt as \\"cowardly\\". Knausg√•rd's wife relapsed into depression upon reading his first book. He added that he would not be able to publish the book again now, but was previously able due to his desperation. Knausg√•rd had finished two volumes when the first book was released. He had been planning to finish the six volumes within the year, preferring to work under harsh deadlines to combat his writer's block. The book's release began a media frenzy as reporters tracked down the novel's characters, which was simple because his family were the only Knausg√•rds in Norway. Knausg√•rd went into hiding and shut out the media exposure to write daily. Working almost all day aside from chauffeuring his kids, he could write 20 pages in a day. The 50-page section on his first days with his wife was written in a 24-hour spurt. Knausg√•rd felt that the third through fifth volumes suffered for the influence of the ongoing controversy that followed the original publication. He wrote the 550-page fifth book in eight weeks. The sixth book has a 400-page essay on Hitler's early life and autobiography. He wanted \\"unsparing honesty\\" in the last book \\"to save the project\\", and so discarded 400 pages, delayed the book, and wrote about the fallout from the publication of the previous five volumes, including a breakdown suffered by his wife during which she was hospitalized. Knausg√•rd described his portrayal of his wife as \\"the most painful thing\\" he has done. His wife, although hurt by portions of the series, did not ask for it to be rewritten and has publicly taken his side. Though he wrote at the end of his series that he is finished with writing, he plans to write a new and fantastical novel not about his life, and influenced by Jorge Luis Borges and Italo Calvino.  Themes  Though the book's protagonist is conflicted between his commonplace needs and his longing to make monumental art, the novels show that the main functions of his life are not the latter art work but the former family life. The series is centered around family and relationships, not the writer's relationship with his work. Titles The books have different titles depending on country and translation. In the native Norwegian and in Swedish they are simply known as Min kamp 1, Min kamp 2, etc.. The first volume in English was published under various titles such as My Struggle: Book One and A Death in the Family: My Struggle Book 1. The second volume was published as My Struggle: Book Two: A Man in Love and A Man In Love: My Struggle Book 2. The third volume was published as Boyhood Island: My Struggle Book 3. The fourth volume was published as Dancing in the Dark: My Struggle Book 4. The fifth volume was published as Some Rain Must Fall: My Struggle Book 5. The sixth and final volume was published as The End: My Struggle Book 6. The title of the series, of both the English translation and the original Norwegian, is a translation of \\"Mein Kampf\\" and is thus a clear reference to Hitler. In an essay for the New Yorkers website, Evan Hughes explains how Knausg√•rd, in interviews, \\"has argued that a frightening characteristic that connects Mein Kampf to the writings of Anders Breivik, the perpetrator of the 2011 Ut√∏ya massacre, is that in the mind behind both texts there seems to be an 'I' and a 'we' but no 'you,' reflecting a dangerous blindness that allowed an otherwise impossible evil.\\" The sixth book of the series includes a meditation on Breivik's attacks. The title of the first volume of the German translation is Sterben, which means \\"to die\\" or \\"dying\\", the second volume Lieben, meaning \\"to love\\" and so on. At the insistence of the publisher, the work was not published as Mein Kampf in Germany. Knausg√•rd says that he understood and did not protest this decision.  Reception  The New Republic Evan Hughes wrote that Knausg√•rd's followers feel like he writes about them, that the book is \\"like opening someone else's diary and finding your own secrets\\". Hughes called Zadie Smith and Jonathan Lethem admirers of Knausg√•rd's. Novelist Jeffrey Eugenides said that Knausg√•rd \\"broke the sound barrier of the autobiographical novel\\". In a long and largely positive review of the first Min Kamp books, James Wood of The New Yorker wrote that \\"There is something ceaselessly compelling about Knausg√•rd‚Äôs book: even when I was bored, I was interested.James Wood, \\"Total Recall\\". The New Yorker, 13 August 2012.\\" In a review of Book 2: A Man in Love in The New York Times, Leland de la Durantaye called the My Struggle series \\"breathtakingly good\\" and compared it to Marcel Proust‚Äôs In Search of Lost Time.Leland de la Durantaye (21 June 2013): Inside Story The New York Times, retrieved 25 June 2013 In a review of Book 3: Boyhood Island in the Times Literary Supplement, Thomas Meaney reflected on the differences between Proust and Knausg√•rd, and wrote about the philosophy behind the Min Kamp books.Thomas Meaney (21 March 2014): \\"A Vital Hatred\\", The Times Literary Supplement; retrieved 25 April 2014. Joshua Rothman notes in his article in The New Yorker that \\"In previous volumes, we‚Äôve watched a younger Karl Ove struggle to absorb his father‚Äôs dark energies. In the new volume, his dad is no longer abusive.\\" However, in an interview with Andrew O‚ÄôHagan, Knausgaard has said that writing My Struggle has not helped him in conquering his fear of his father. Frenchculture.org website noted that, even though Knausg√•rd was called the \\"Norwegian Proust\\", the first volume sold very few copies in France, probably because the strong French tradition of autofiction makes the book look less original than it appears in the US. Liesl Schillinger further explains the uniqueness in Knausg√•rd's writing for even his own culture, stating in her Wall Street Journal profile piece: :\\"No other Norwegian writer had dared such full disclosure. France has a tradition of autobiographical fiction, and memoir is common in the United States but not in Scandinavia.\\" Lorin Stein observes: :\\"Norwegians say that the confessional instinct is so culturally alien to them that it was, in a funny way, useful to him.\\" As Knausgaard sees it, \\"There was a threshold for writing about real people, and it was shockingly open. That was very important to me, it gave me courage.\\" Knausg√•rd has been criticized over the way he exposes other people in the book. A girlfriend he had for four years, anonymized under the name ¬´Gunvor¬ª in the fifth volume, said to the newspaper Bergens Tidende: \\"It was as if he said: Now I'm going to punch you in the face. I know it's going to hurt, and I will drive you to the hospital afterwards. But I'm going to do it anyway.\\" Theatrical adaptation A theatrical adaptation of My Struggle into a Swedish language play entitled \\"Min Kamp\\" was premiered in Stockholm at Kulturhuset Stadsteatern on 29th August 2015, adapted for the stage and directed by Ole Anders Tandberg. The play was premiered in Kristiansand on 2 September 2016 in Norwegian language (in Norwegian) and performed at the Oslo Nye Centralteatret from 11 October 2016 running until 29 October 2016. (in Norwegian) The play successively toured various Norwegian theatres before returning to Oslo in December.

The \\"city\\" belongs to Korea's Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism. Paju Book City is home to 250 publishers with over 10,000 workers. It covers the entire process of publishing from planning to printing and distribution and is home to a large number of book cafes and bookstores. The City Paju Book city is about an hour's drive north of Seoul, and sits directly alongside the 38th Parallel. Approximately 250 companies have offices in this complex which spreads across 215 acres (875,000 meters2). These firms employ generate over $1 billion in annual sales. As of the end of 2014 the city will be nearly doubled in size as 300 more publishing and printing companies have plans to move to Paju Book City. The Telegraph described the role of Paju Book City as: :Korea‚Äôs publishing world is concentrated in Paju Book City, an hour‚Äôs drive north of Seoul. Inspired by Hay-on-Wye, Paju is a turbocharged version of the town of books. Two hundred publishers jostle in gleaming glass buildings above a plethora of bookshop caf√©s. At the weekend, I was told, it‚Äôs packed with literary-minded Koreans. Inside Paju Book City books outnumber people by a ratio of 20:1. Korean books are often sold from the ground floor of publishing companies in the city, but there are also several good used bookstores, at least two of which feature books in languages other than Korean. The city also contains unusual art galleries, book cafes, one guesthouse, and specialized exhibition spaces. There is also a playground for children, as well as an adjacent Premium Shopping Outlet. History The first plans for Paju Book City were created in 1989 by a group of publisher desiring a model village that would be based solely on the idea of books and their productions, and that this model village would place ‚Äúcommon good‚Äù above ‚Äúruthless self-interest‚Äù, as well as be built in harmony with the existing environment of the area. The Korean government lent support to this plan and in 2001 the foundation as begun for the Asia Publication Culture and Information Centre which has since morphed into approximately 150 buildings containing more than 200 publishing companies. The development process was unusual, as the desire for \\"harmony\\" was placed above the desire for \\"industrial development.\\" Two different architects were commissioned as 'architectural coordinator' (Min Hyun-Shik and Seung H-Sang). These coordinators worked in concert with UK architect Florian Beigel of the University of North London, as well as more local architects Kim Jong-Kyu and Kim Young-Joon, in preparing an Architectural Guideline for Bookcity. All individual buildings had to be built according to that guideline and the city was divided into sectors, with each sector being given a lead architect. As the official site of Paju Book City notes, \\"It also was not an easy task to persuade tenants not accustomed to such a process to follow the plans.\\" Most of Korea's influential publishing companies maintain at least an office in Paju Book City, including MunhakDongne and Chang Bi, the publishers of Kyung- Sook Shin, author of Please Look After Mother which won the Man Asian Book Prize. Paju has also created its own series of book prizes given to Asian books, writers, designers, publishing companies, and editors ‚Äúwho have dedicated themselves to the development and promotion of Asian publication culture.‚Äù Events Although events are held at the event center year round, Paju is known for two international festivals. In spring, it is the International Children's Book Festival and in fall it is the annual International Book Festival whose theme is \\"Booksori\\", which typically receives nearly half-a million visitors over a 9-day period.

Published in Arabic in 2014, the book, ostensibly set in 2013 after the time of the 2013 Egyptian coup d'√©tat, is a Picaresque novel. The book is a scathing, minimalistic portrayal of a modern generation in Egyptian society during the 1990s. The locale of the novel is several unnamed lower and middle middle class areas in Cairo. The novel also reflects on the porn industry, and how it has impacted modern Egyptian society, referencing porn stars such as Jenna Jameson and Sunny Leone among others. A Well-trained Stray has a warm reception upon its publication critically or commercially, it has \\"A fresh sophisticated structure\\" as Akhbar Al-Adab called it, and it is \\"a renovation on the linguistic, theoretical, and artistic levels\\" as the notable Egyptian critic Amani Fouad described it. and it is \\"monitoring with witty and ironic drive a whole generation\\" as the young critic Hasan Marouf wrote once., and it is \\"a witty novel on critique the state and the intelligentsia\\" as the notable Egyptian Tahrir newspaper called it, and it is \\"generates vertigo in the reader's mind, without being direct or loud\\", as described by the critique of the prolific Lebanese Newspaper An Nahar, on May 14, 2014. The novel was translated and published in Italian in 2016, by Il Sirente, presented in Turin international book fair, after a wide warm reception by major Italian publications, Il fatto quotidiano, Il Manifesto, L'Esspresso, among many others, which ran critique of the novel or interviews with the author. Plot summary The novel opens with a funny scene where Ahmad, the main character and the book's narrator, is with his friend Nevine in her car by Cairo-Alexandria desert road. They are nearly caught by the police, but Nevine narrowly manages to escape. We know that Ahmad is writing pornographic stories for a living, using odesk.com, and through it he's found an agent who interested in Arabic porn stories. After sending a sample, he completed a simple interview and began to work. We know that he's living alone with his aunt after the death of his grandmother and that his father has remarried after the death of his mother, and we get to know two of his best friends‚ÄîEl Loul, a failed TV director who is now trying to promote his scriptwriting as well as managing C-rated belly-dancers for cheap satellite channels ‚Äì Abdullah, a drug addict, and his childhood best friend, who came from a wealthier family and has doesn't-give-a shit type of attitude. Through tracking the two characters and their connection to Ahmad we can glimpse the 1990s middle-class generation in Cairo as well as the strange relationship Ahmad and Abdullah had when they were teenagers, and, echoing that, the porn industry and stars. Nevine herself is such a character: She's a perfect nymphomaniac who married a guy she despises after returning with her family from the Persian Gulf region, where she spent her childhood. While the hubby, who married her for her family's money, is off in the Gulf, she has her revenge by shagging as many men as she can, only two or three times before hitting on a new man. Through this, she got to know Ahmad and she dumped him as usual before getting to know Ali Luza. Ali Luza, a \\"Robin Hood targeting the Sluts\\", as Ahmad describes him in one point in the novel, escorts them for a while and pays for them, but after his boredom with the liaison, he just mugs them, getting his money back with extra. Ali is a son of a working-class \\"shaabi\\" restaurant owner but never lacks for self-esteem. He has a brother, Hamousa, addicted to recreational drugs, and he's serving as a local thug. Nevine got mugged by Luza as expected, and from what she said very briefly to Ahmad, she was also gang-raped before he took all of her money, credit cards, with codes, and made her sign a contract selling her expensive car. As Ahmad realizes, the contract will only be used to get more money out of her to get the car back. Nevine wants to beat Ali up for what he did, and she seeks Ahmad's help. He takes her to see El Loul in one of his favorite night-clubs, and while Tslam Al Ayadi is playing with a C-rated belly-dancer, Ahmad was telling El loul his idea: He will keep Nevine in his place while sending a belly dancer El Loul knows to seduce Ali, who will go to El Loul's place. There, they would kidnap him till getting Nevine's stuff back. Abdullah agreed to join the scheme for the good money Nevine offered, and so did El Loul. Indeed, they sent a belly dancer to Ali Louza's father restaurant, which was where he first picked up Nevine and where he used to stay. There, Ali fights with locals and gains the belly dancer's admiration, which makes her screw up the whole thing when Ali falls for her friend. It's a fiasco, and facing this truth Ahmad improvises an even crazier scheme: They, he and Abdullah, will wait in the spot Ali Louza will come to pick up the money and give back the car, in some alley near downtown. There, they'll attack him, put him in the car, and drive to one of Abdullah's friends homes in Al Rehab (a city in between Cairo and Suez). Eventually, they went there, wearing two pairs of women's stockings over their heads so as not to be discovered (such a lousy old-fashioned way to masquerade, in tribute to old Egyptian action movies especially Adel Emam's \\"Al Mashbooh\\"), and they attacked Ali and Hamousa, who was taken aback. But suddenly another thing happened: The local gang Ali Louza had previously fought ambushed him at the same time, bullets were whizzing around, and Ahmad found himself in front of the bag of money Nevine brought for Ali. He just picked it up without thinking, leaving both Abdullah (who had probably been hit by then) and Nevine, who had fled with the car after the windows had been shot out. Ahmad ran to a wide street, discovering that he had failed to remove the stocking from his head, and faced a patrol and lots of people who looked at him in shock. He continued to run, both police and people after him. Literary significance and criticism In his article about the novel, Egyptian poet Rami Yehia compared the lead paragraph of the First- person narrative novel with the great opening of Kafka's The Metamorphosis, where both of them, in his opinion, did a great introduction for the world of their novels. Along with Yehia, the two critiques Amani Fouad and Hasan Maarouf wrote in there pieces about how the characters convey that feeling of lost and mechanical way of living, reviewing the condition of those characters and their own lanes in life. It was highly notable that a certain line Aladdin wrote reflected how his protagonist review Egypt and its current condition: \\"Nobody has interfered with that fight, which seemed to me like everything in this city: A pseudo-something.\\" On January 30, Aladdin spoke with Macia Lynx Qualey of Arabic Literature in English blog, stating that \\" I have built on our lives in the 1990s, and our nightmares in 2013\\". then he goes more to speak about the novel when asked about its variation of his previous works like The Gospel According to Adam \\" I guess A Well-trained Stray has more of a \\"realistic\\" kick, the way it can be somehow a part of dirty realism. It has simpler language and more obvious humour. It is like \\"The Season of Migration to Arkidea\\" (my latest long story), I guess both the story and the novel marking a new drive for me, putting in mind that I guess I use the right language level on each piece. For me, you can't write A Well-trained Stray with The Gospel According to Adam language level, and vice versa\\". It is the first time ever Aladdin uses slang-even in dialogue- in his books.

He had three older siblings Cornelia Maria \\"Corrie\\"(1906-2004), Gijsbertus \\"Gijs\\" (1908-1993), & Marinus Allegondus (1909-1911). Rein died on 29 January 1999.

He enlisted in the Princess Irene Brigade in England in 1943, where he was part of Gevechts Groep 3 (GGIII). He returned to Africa after the war. He studied art in Europe and Africa.Bronwyn Hughes, \\"Twentieth Century Stained Glass in Melbourne Churches\\", Masters thesis, Faculty of Arts, The University of Melbourne, 1997. Rein emigrated to Australia with his then wife Hilary Prudence \\"Prue\\" Reynolds Slagmolen in 1949 to establish himself as an artist and sculptor. Vetrart Studios H.W. Jones Pty Ltd, through the initiative of Rex Jones, expanded their lead-lighting work about the time the new St Andrew's Church, Brighton was being built in 1961. H.W. Jones was an established firm in Sydney Road, Brunswick, Melbourne and operated as experienced leadlighters, merchants and importers. With the intention of providing a full design service, Rex Jones and Rein Slagmolen formed a partnership to establish Vetrart Studios for the purpose of designing and making windows and other art works. Vetrart Studios recognised the need for architects, artists and industry to work collaboratively in the design and construction of new church buildings. Slagmolen also had a background in chemical research, leading to the making of such materials as 'Polylite' panels and a matrix for concrete glass windows. The latter, he claimed, was dimensionally stable and overcame the problem of these windows leaking because of the shrinking of the concrete matrix. He worked with the C.S.I.R.O. to develop innovative techniques to hold and strengthen glass panels. In the early 1960s, Slagmolen and Vetrart Studios worked with the noted Australian church architect Louis Williams for such major commissions as St Andrew's Church, Brighton and St Boniface's Cathedral, Bunbury. Another well known example of Slagmolen's work is the glass mosaic wall in the foyer of Qantas House in Melbourne.http://www.artrecord.com/index.cfm/artist/10281-slagmolen- rein/ Slagmolen's artistic work was not restricted to a single material and he worked in bronze, aluminium, concrete, plastics, enamels as well as stained glass.

It was incorporated in 1989. It is known for artists working in a primarily figurative style, and continuing and developing the West Arnhem rock art tradition. It is also known for pandanus weavings.Hamby, Louise, Twined Together, Injalak Arts and Crafts, 2005 Artists are mostly Kunwinjku people; however, artists from many language groups across Arnhem Land are represented.

How Aborigines invented the idea of contemporary art, Institute of Modern Art, 2011, p. 17 History =Development of the market= The demand for art and artefacts from the Gunbalanya area began long before the incorporation of Injalak Arts and Crafts. Since early European contact, several notable collections were created and much informal trade took place. The anthropologist Baldwin Spencer visited Gunbalanya in 1912 in his role as Special Commissioner for Aboriginals and Chief Protector, staying with Paddy Cahill, the founder of the cattle station in Gunbalanya.Allen, Lindy, 'Greedy for bakki', in Hamby, Louise, Twined Together, Injalak Arts and Crafts, 2005, 41-51, p.43 He collected many bark paintings and fibre works, and Cahill continued to send him new works for the collection until around 1922.Allen, 'Greedy for bakki', in Hamby, Twined Together, p.48 The American-Australian Scientific Expedition to Arnhem Land arrived in Gunbalanya in October 1948, and its leader Charles Mountford commissioned many paintings on bark.Dyer, Christine Adrian, Kunwinjku Art from Injalak 1991-1992: The John W. Kluge Commission, Museum Art International Pty.

Berndt of the Australian National Research Council, working for Professor A.P. Elkin of Sydney University. They too created a notable collection.Dyer, Kunwinjku Art from Injalak, p. 21 The market for Kunwinjku art began to expand from the late 1950s, largely thanks to major purchases by government institutions. The major collectors included Dorothy Bennett and Dr Scougall for the Art Gallery of New South Wales (1959-1966), the anthropologist Karel Kupka for the Basel Ethnographic Museum (1960), Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies (1963), Mus√©e national des Arts d'Afrique et d'Oc√©anie (1963), and his private collection (now held at the National Gallery of Australia), as well as Helen Groger-Wurm for the Darwin Museum and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies (1965‚Äì70).Taylor, Luke, Seeing the Inside: Bark Painting in Western Arnhem Land, Oxford University Press, 1996, p. 35 From the 1962 to 1974, the Church Missionary Society (CMS) marketed the ‚Äúart and crafts‚Äù of Arnhem Land, selling them through a dedicated outlet in Sydney.Taylor, Luke, Seeing the Inside: Bark Painting in Western Arnhem Land, Oxford University Press, 1996, p. 35 The fourth ‚Äúclassic‚Äù collection of art from Gunbalanya was gathered mostly through this source, by the Australian Aboriginal Arts Board.Dyer, Kunwinjku Art from Injalak, pp. 21-22 By the 1970s, visiting collectors and casual visitors also comprised a ready market for West Arnhem Land art.May, Sally K., 'Started down at the little shed', in Hamby, Louise, Twined Together, Injalak Arts and Crafts, 2005, 187-195, p.188 =Beginnings of Injalak Arts and Crafts= The history of Injalak Arts began with a screenprinting group started in 1986. In that year, a representative of the Duke of Edinburgh's Award scheme visited Gunbalanya with funding for people to participate.May, 'Started down at the little shed', in Hamby, Twined Together, p.189 Wendy Kennedy, a teacher who came to Gunbalanya in 1974, had in 1983 accepted a position as adult educator in Gunbalanya. She and a group of her students decided on trying screenprinting for the 'hobby' element required by the award. The screenprinter Ray Young was hired to assist, and with the women sewing, they were soon producing printed fabric, bags, calico skirts, baby wraps, nappies and singlets.May, 'Started down at the little shed', in Hamby, Twined Together, p.189 A number of the original participants in the Duke of Edinburgh's award, including Gabriel Maralngurra and Donna Nadjamerrek, are still involved in Injalak Arts to the present day, having become leaders within the organisation. In 1988, the men of the group moved from the adult education centre to a shed near the community council office (the shed is now known as the old CDEP workshop). Around this time, the printers began moving away from generic figurative designs to designs influenced by the traditional style and subject matter of West Arnhem Land art. This raised the attention of elders and traditional custodians of the designs such as Lofty Bardayal Nadjamerrek. But while this could have led to conflict, it slowly developed into a system of cultural protocols around commercial painting still in play at Injalak today.May, 'Started down at the little shed', in Hamby, Twined Together, p. 190 The screenprinting group caught the attention of the Commonwealth Government's Community Development program, which was keen to promote local business. In 1986‚Äì87, discussions and consultations were held about expanding the operations of the group to become an art centre trading a range of artistic media. This was in the context of the rapidly expanding Aboriginal Art movement at the time. In 1988, the screenprinting group successfully applied for $500,000 in funding from the Commonwealth Government, which led to the building of the Injalak Art Centre where is stands today. It was incorporated on 12 April 1989.May, 'Started down at the little shed', in Hamby, Twined Together, p. 191 =Development of the Art Centre= Art production picked up quickly following the creation of the new building. Screenprinting and sewing continued, and painting and weaving (primarily pandanus weaving) increased dramatically.May, 'Started down at the little shed', in Hamby, Twined Together, p.191 Wendy Kennedy stayed on until 1990, before handing over interim management to the screenprinter Ray Young. The first appointed manager, Felicity Wright, arrived in October 1991. Critical in the early days of the art centre was the senior painter Thompson Yulidjirri (d. 2009), who mentored the younger artists and developed Injalak as a place for the transmission of cultural knowledge outside the traditional venues.May, 'Started down at the little shed', in Hamby, Twined Together, p.191 Felicity Wright stayed on as manager until 1995, a time which saw increasing recognition for Gunbalanya artists. Samuel Namundja won the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award in the bark painting category in 1993. A series of managers between 1995 and 2001 included Andrew Headley, Matthew Johnson, Anthony Murphy and Paul Magin, until Anthony Murphy took up the position full-time again in January 2001.May, 'Started down at the little shed', in Hamby, Twined Together, p.193 Anthony Murphy remained as manager until 2010.Munro, Keith et. al, Bardayal 'Lofty' Nadjamerrek AO, Museum of Contemporary Art, 2010, p.178 Lorna Martin arrived in August 2009 and remained as manager until December 2012. In December 2012 Injalak's first manager, Felicity Wright, returned and currently shares managerial responsibilities with Gabriel Maralngurra and Isaiah Nagurrgurrba (2014). Cultural tourism Since its inception, Injalak has been involved in cultural tourism, facilitating tours of nearby Injalak Hill. Injalak Hill is an important Aboriginal rock art site located just one kilometre from the art centre across the floodplain, or about a four kilometre drive via the main roads. =History of tourism at Injalak= Injalak artists have acted as guides of Injalak Hill since the opening of the art centre in 1989. Injalak Hill tours began as informal service, with tourists hiring artists as guides for rates often organised on the day.Wright, Felicity, The Arts and Crafts Centre Story, Vol 1: a Survey of 39 Aboriginal Community Art and Craft Centres in Remote Australia Undertaken by Desart Inc, Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Commission, 1999, p. 203 In 1992, a five-year plan for the art centre was formulated, with the Aboriginal governing body of Injalak expressing the desire to formally promote cultural tourism.Wright, The Arts and Crafts Centre Story, Vol 1, p. 201 The main reasons highlighted were to facilitate the understanding of Kunwinjku art and culture, and to generate work and income. In the same year, a number of outside tour operators approached the traditional owners and Injalak to contract the services of Injalak guides. Some partnerships, such as those with Arnhem Land Explorer and Lord's Safaris, have continued to the present day. As demand increased, tourists began to book in advance, and eventually by the dry season of 2000, about 10-15 tours were leaving the art centre for Injalak Hill each week.Wright, The Arts and Crafts Centre Story, Vol 1, p. 203 Injalak currently runs three daily tours of Injalak Hill in peak season, with spaces shared between tour operators and free independent travellers. Tours are generally available from the early dry season(late April‚ÄìMay), with the hill becoming inaccessible again with the onset of the wet season (late November‚ÄìDecember).

Access Visitors coming via road need to cross the East Alligator River at Cahill's Crossing. Image: Tourism NT The accessibility of Gunbalanya via road is determined by the level and flow of the East Alligator River. Cahill's Crossing, about 16 km from Gunbalanya, may be impassable during the wet season or towards high tide. In the dry season, from May to October, the road is generally passable, though visitors are advised to check tide times and consult with Kakaku National Park or the art centre.http://www.injalak.com/ Depending on the year, the river is often also passable in April, November and early December. Visitors are required to acquire a permit from the Northern Land Council in Jabiru or Darwin to enter Arnhem Land. For day visitors, these permits are generally issued on the spot. However the offices are closed on weekends so visitors may need to plan ahead. Occasionally weather conditions, ceremonial events or funerals may result in permits not being issued, so visitors are advised to contact the Northern Land Council in advance.http://www.nlc.org.au/articles/cat/frequently-asked-questions/ The turnoff to Cahill's Crossing is on the Arnhem Highway just before Jabiru. The road is tarred between the highway and Cahill's Crossing, and dirt between the crossing and just before Gunbalanya. The drive from Jabiru to the art centre takes around 60 minutes. Visitors are free to travel to the art centre via private vehicle, and there are also a range of tour companies which include Injalak Arts on their itinerary. Gunbalanya also has a sealed all-weather airstrip, Oenpelli Airport, and charter flights are available from Jabiru year-round. Gunbalanya Air Charters also provides transport between the airport and the town in both Gunbalanya and Jabiru.

It was established by the Lutz family in 1947, who maintained ownership until the business was purchased by the Barisich family in 1954. Working-class locals and Reed College students frequent the bar, which is known for popularizing the beer Pabst Blue Ribbon. Lutz closed in 2010 after being run by the Barisich family for 56 years, then re-opened under new ownership and management in 2011. Description and history Lutz Tavern, established in 1947, is located at 4639 Southeast Woodstock Boulevard in Portland's Woodstock neighborhood. The Lutz family owned the bar until 1954, when it was purchased by the Barisich family. Lilias Barisich, who shared ownership with her brothers after their parents handed it over to them, said of the bar and her mother's operating style: \\"It's always been a homey place because my mom would kick people out if they acted different. She'd tell them they wouldn't act that way if they were invited to our home for dinner, so there was no call to act like that at the Lutz.\\" For many years, Lutz attracted a mixture of working-class men and Reed College students. The Portland Mercury said the bar served \\"cheap swill to blue-collar folks and Reed kids that didn't mind walking those extra few blocks.\\" Barisich recalled that \\"at one time, it was a favorite of concrete workers, city crews and the like. You couldn't keep the floor clean on a Friday afternoon. Every muddy workboot in the city was here.\\" It served beer only, accepted cash only, and offered the \\"bare minimum of food that the OLCC required\\". The crowd became steadily younger over time. In the 1990s, when her parents still operated the bar, Barisich asked if she could sell a case of what was then considered premium beer. She recalled, \\"I convinced them to let me buy a case of Heineken's, which at that time sold for unheard-of price of a buck a bottle. My dad said that people would never pay that much for a bottle of beer, and they'd only let me buy the case if I promised to drink what didn't sell.\\" Her introduction of premium beer proved to be successful. Lutz would soon be recognized by Blitz-Weinhard for serving more Blitz beer than any other establishment. In 1999, Lutz reportedly served BridgePort IPA, Sierra Nevada Pale Ale and Widmer Hop Jack and Hefeweizen for $2.60 per pint, but still offered Blitz and Pabst Blue Ribbon for $1 per can. The Oregonian John Foyston said of the bar then, \\"The floor stays cleaner, but the decor remains minimal: beer signs, a pool table, handwritten signs advertising the famous hot pickles (60 cents) and ham sandwiches ($2).\\" Willamette Week called Lutz a \\"true dive, but one with outsize influence among bike messengers and other curators of cool\\". = Pabst Blue Ribbon= Though the claim is disputed, Lutz is known nationally for being the origin of Pabst Blue Ribbon's recent popularity. In 2015, Willamette Week Matthew Singer invited representatives from Lutz and EJ's, the former bar, strip club, and music venue in northeast Portland which also claims to have re-introduced Pabst, to explain their competing claims. Layne Martin, who managed Lutz from 1994 to 2000, said: > There was this absolute scorching deal on cases of PBR and kegs. We were one > of the few outlets in Portland that sold kegs to go, so we could sell them > at a really good deal. So we started the PBR dollar-can special. I'd say it > was around 1997 or 1998. At one point, I know they said we were the largest > distributor of Pabst in the state, if not the country. We got written up in > The New York Times about it. We were going through hundreds of cases and > dozens of kegs a week. Mike Thrasher, EJ's talent buyer from 1995 to 1999, recalled: > I started working at EJ's when it was a strip club in about October 1994. A > couple of the key staff and I convinced the owner we would do better as a > rock-'n'-roll bar, and decided to launch the new format on 1, 1995. As a > future rock club, we decided we needed to rethink our drink selections to > suit that clientele. While comparing the prices of the domestic beers, we > found that Pabst was cheapest at $33 per keg. The club gained popularity, > and Pabst became the drink of choice. On Tuesdays, Pabst was sold at the > full price of $1.75, but there was no cover to see the bands. Things kept > getting busier. It was suggested that Thursdays become a 'beer bust,' where > a patron could get unlimited Pabst between opening at 6 pm and 8 pm, when > the room was cleared for the show. By this time, perhaps mid-1996, EJ's had > achieved some recognition from touring bands and had a steady influx of > national talent, which again increased sales. During busy months, we were > getting three deliveries a week and moving more than 40 kegs a month. Years > later, Pabst became known as the 'hipster' beer of Portland. There is no way > for me to warrant that EJ's decision to make PBR its house beer caused this > impact, but I have done so nonetheless, for years. Matt Slessler, the field marketing manager for Pabst's Pacific region, weighed in on the debate as well, saying: > We've always thought Lutz was the first one to sell it. But it's like how > people claim they saw Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game or were at > Woodstock. The landscape is littered with salesmen who say, 'Oh yeah, I was > the first one to bring that in.' The first PBR I ever had was at the Jockey > Club, this really old-school punk-rock bar on Killingsworth. As far as the > very first ones, there was the Lutz and EJ's, and it's always been our > thought that Lutz was first. In 2003, Willamette Week published an image of a man drinking Pabst at Lutz with a caption making fun of \\"middle-class, college-educated, salaried Portland hipsters\\" for drinking that brand of beer, and noting its relation to MillerCoors. =Closing and reopening= Lutz Tavern signage in 2014 In September 2010, after operating Lutz for 56 years, the owners held a \\"farewell bash\\" and closed its doors after deciding that they could no longer borrow money to stay open. However, the bar was re-opened in 2011 by the staff of the Portland establishments Clinton Street Pub and Crow Bar. Willamette Week reported that Lutz began serving liquor, eight taps of \\"good Northwest micros, and a real kitchen that makes a kick-ass burger\\" as the result of new management. The Woodstock Neighborhood Association (WNA) originally made plans to paint Woodstock Mural on the east exterior of Lutz. In August 2012, the Regional Arts & Culture Council (RACC) confirmed funding of $6,000 for the painting. The mural's design was divided into three parts to accommodate the exterior wall's three sections. RACC published an image of artist Mike Lawrence's proposed mural and said the goal of the project was to \\"highlight the best of the neighborhood and instill a sense of community pride\\". The agency also said the project was still raising funds and hoped to start in the spring of 2013. Efforts stalled, but WNA later proposed a mural with a different design for the east side of the nearby Red Fox Vintage building. In 2013, Lutz earned top honors in the Dill Pickle Club's annual \\"Perfect Pickle\\" competition, in which nine restaurants competed. In 2014, The Oregonian reported that Robert Kowalski was the owner of Lutz and several other local establishments, including Crow Bar and Clinton Street Pub. Reception Lutz has been a part of the community for decades. Shortly following Lutz's 2011 re-opening, Ben Waterhouse of Willamette Week quipped that the bar had kept its \\"old look and clientele: The lineup at the bar on a recent Friday was plaid, fleece, tweed, plaid, plaid, plaid and tweed.\\" In Willamette Week 2014 \\"Bar Guide\\", Matthew Korfhage described Lutz as an \\"old-school, diner- countered, deep-boothed drinking hole\\" serving \\"Reedies, old rockers and rank- and-file preservers of the AFL-CIO to equal satisfaction\\". He wrote, \\"The bar's been upgraded in recent years, but this mostly just means the diner- style food's edible and there's no pay phone. But if you hang around past 11 pm on a Friday, the wild union boys of Woodstock again arrive to reclaim the place, smokin', hootin', hollerin', who cares? It's the Lutz.\\" In 2016, Thrillist contributor Dan Schlegel wrote, \\"The lived-in charm of this Woodstock haunt feels a lot like something out of a Paul Thomas Anderson movie, like the place where you'd meet up at 2 in the afternoon for a drink or six with an estranged half-brother who's involved in some weird pyramid scheme. The cocktails are stiff, the beer list is impressive, and the clientele has way fewer nail-biting Reedies than you'd expect.\\" References External links  * 1947 establishments in Oregon 2010 disestablishments in Oregon 2011 establishments in Oregon Companies based in Portland, Oregon Drinking establishments in Oregon Restaurants disestablished in 2010 Restaurants established in 1947 Restaurants established in 2011 Restaurants in Portland, Oregon Woodstock, Portland, Oregon ","title":"Lutz Tavern"},{"id":"42479099","text":"Mue (French \\"the moulting\\") is √âmilie Simon's sixth studio album, released by Barclay Records on 17 March 2014.

Obernolte's biggest concerns are taking care of veterans and holding the VA accountable, securing the border and cracking down on human and drug trafficking, and lowering taxes. He also supports creating jobs and helping small businesses, working with public safety officials to reduce the number of gangs and violent criminals, and cutting wasteful government spending to address the federal budget deficit. On February 12, 2020, President Donald Trump endorsed Obernolte on Twitter. Political actions =Caucuses and committees= In January 2016, Obernolte was elected to served on the California Legislative Technology and Innovation Caucus, which is co-chaired by Assemblymembers Ian Calderon and Evan Low. Obernolte also sits on the following committees: Arts, Entertainment, Sports, Tourism, and Internet Media as Vice Chair; Budget as Vice Chair; Appropriations; Budget Subcommittee 6 on Budget Process, Oversight and Program Evaluation; Budget Subcommittee 6 on Budget Process, Oversight and Program Evaluation; Utilities and Commerce; Joint Committee on Arts; and Joint Legislative Budget. =Fire tax and fire insurance= Obernolte authored Assembly Bill 1642, which would extend the deadlines to either pay the fire tax, which is a state fire prevention fee, or file a petition for redetermination from 30 days to 60 days. In July 2017, the fire fee was suspended as part of Assembly Bill 398. Obernolte opposes raising fire insurance costs, which is calculated by factors in the risk of wildfire, fuels, slope and road access for emergency vehicles. =Minimum wage= Obernolte opposes increases in the minimum wage. In an April 2016 op-ed published in the San Bernardino Sun, Obernolte wrote on the effects of increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour. He wrote that \\"income inequality is the defining challenge of our generation\\" and the recent push to increase the minimum wage \\"is an effort to address the very real problem that wages are less than we feel they should be. However, we need to remember that income inequality is the result of a multitude of factors ‚Äî among them, globalization, technological change, the efficient employment of capital and changing institutions. In other words, low wages are a symptom of the problem of income inequality, not the root cause of income inequality.\\" =Frontier Communications= In April 2016, Frontier Communications took over Verizon's voice, video, data, and FiOS network. In May 2016, Obernolte voiced his concern over Frontier Communications' acquisition of Verizon services noting that it has \\"negatively affected my constituents... It is particularly disturbing to me that the public safety of our residents has been threatened by the faulty landline telephone service they have experienced since the (acquisition).\\" =Legal= In May 2016, Obernolte introduced Assembly Bill 2341, which would provide San Bernardino and other rural counties with additional judges to resolve backlogged court systems. \\"San Bernardino County currently faces an unacceptable shortage of judicial officers. My hope is that this bill will provide the necessary judicial resources to alleviate this critical problem\\" Obernolte said. The bill would have shifted seats from Santa Clara and Alameda counties to the counties in San Bernardino but it died in the Senate Appropriations Committee without a hearing. In January 2017, Obernolte released a statement on his opposition to Xavier Becerra's nomination as California's Attorney General stating, \\"While Congressman Becerra possesses many of the qualifications necessary in an Attorney General, many of his positions on constitutional issues deeply concern me. His stances on both the First and Second Amendments clearly don't align with my values or those of my constituents. California's Attorney General should be committed to protecting these Constitutional rights.\\" =Veterans= Every year, California State Assemblymembers select a veteran in their district to be recognized as the Veteran of the Year and honored in Sacramento with a ceremony and luncheon. In 2015, Obernolte awarded Hesperia Chamber of Commerce President Brad Letner. In 2017, Anthony \\"Tony\\" Cooker was recognized as the 2017 Veteran of the Year for the 33rd Assembly District. In 2019, he recognized United States Army Veteran Ed Morgan as Veteran of the Year. In 2016, Obernolte sponsored approved Assembly Concurrent Resolution 180, which dedicates a stretch of California State Route 247 (SR-247) to the late Sgt. Brian L. Walker. =California budget= Obernolte stated that Governor Jerry Brown's $179.45 billion budget proposal, which focused on \\"long-term fiscal responsibility\\", was \\"responsible\\", although he expressed a preference for fixing existing programs over creating new ones. Obernolte also stated an interest in funding job skills training, improving the state's Denti-Cal program, repairing infrastructure, and working on the housing crisis. Obernolte pushed for lawmakers to limit long-term funding commitments and also noted that the budget proposal does nothing to address the \\"state's out-of- control pension debts and retiree health care liabilities.\\" =California Roll ‚Äì AB 1103= Obernolte co-authored Assembly Bill 1103, which would allow California bicyclists to roll through stop signs, if it was safe to do so. The bill is based on a law adopted by Idaho in 1982 and will be voted on in 2018. Under the proposed legislation, cyclists would be authorized to \\"[approach] a stop sign, after slowing to a reasonable speed and yielding the right-of-way, to cautiously make a turn or proceed through the intersection without stopping, unless safety considerations require otherwise.\\" Personal life Obernolte married his wife Heather in 1996 and together they have two sons: Hale and Troy. The family has lived in Big Bear Lake since 1997. Obernolte holds an airline transport pilot's license. He is also a certified flight instructor and has flown light aircraft since 2005. He worked with Embraer as a member on its Pilot Advisory Board during the development of the Phenom 300.

The final lasted only 55 minutes, the fifth-shortest women's singles final in Wimbledon history in terms of time elapsed. Bouchard had not lost a set prior to the final and was the betting favorite to win. Marion Bartoli was the reigning champion, but retired from professional tennis in August 2013. Kvitov√° dropped only one set the entire tournament, to Venus Williams in the third round. Like the previous major, the 2014 Wimbledon Championships was marked by two big upsets. The top two seeds ‚Äì Serena Williams and Li Na ‚Äì both lost in the third round. This marked the first time in the Open era that neither of the top two seeds reached the fourth round of Wimbledon. Five-time Wimbledon champion Williams' defeat to 25th-seeded Aliz√© Cornet equalled her earliest exit from the tournament (she lost at the same stage in 1998 and 2005).

Bouchard, playing in only her sixth grand slam tournament, advanced to the final without losing a set, becoming the first Canadian tennis player to reach the singles final of a grand slam. The title match was the first grand slam final contested between two players born in the 1990s. In the first set, Kvitov√° broke in the third game and broke again in the seventh to establish a 5‚Äì2 lead.

The victory gave Kvitov√° her second Wimbledon title and second Grand Slam title overall.

In 100 captionless woodcut prints Masereel looks at many facets of life in a big city. Background Frans Masereel (1889‚Äì1972) was born in Blankenberge, Belgium. His stepfather's political beliefs left an impression on the young Masereel, who often accompanied him in socialist demonstrations. Masereel left to study art on his own in Paris and volunteered as a translator for the Red Cross in Geneva during World War I. He drew newspaper political cartoons, and copublished a journal in which he published his first woodcut prints. In 1918 he created the book of woodcuts to feature a narrative, 25 Images of a Man's Passion, which he followed with Passionate Journey (1919), The Sun (1919), Story Without Words (1920), and The Idea (1920). Content and style Unlike many of Masereel's other books, The City does not follow the unraveling of a plot. Instead, a series of images of life in a big city are on display, showing people from different backgrounds and stages of life: a state funeral, the inside of a poor family's home, a woman's lifeless body dragged out of a canal, prostitutes and entertainers, courtrooms and factories. It opens with a figure seated on a grassy hill staring at the smokestacked cityscape before him and closes with a solitary woman staring from her attic into a star-filled sky. The visuals bear a strong German Expressionist influence‚Äîwhat critic describes as \\"the pictorial vocabulary of Expressionism\\". Masereel shared with the Expressionists a fondness for the woodcut, though he rejected such labeling of his work. Freed from the needs of plot Masereel was free to focus on individual images to express his vision of the city. Publication history and reception The work was made up of 100 woodcut prints sized . It was first published in 1925 in Paris under the French title by A. Morenc√©, and in a German edition titled Die Stadt from Kurt Wolff. Later editions include a 1961 edition from Pierre Vorms under the French title ',) and under the English title The City from Dover Publications in 1972 and from Random House and Schocken Books in 1988. Critic Perry Willett believed The City \\"must be considered Masereel's masterpiece woodcut novel\\", and believed it anticipated the films Berlin: Symphony of a Metropolis (1927) and Man with a Movie Camera (1929), in which the protagonist was the city itself. Masereel continued to publish wordless novels throughout his life, from L'Oeuvre in 1928 to Route des hommes in 1964. External links The City - Archive.org Source : Complete text online.

History and architecture The presently visible stone church dates from the 13th century but probably replaced an earlier, wooden church. The exact history of the church is unknown; perhaps it was built at the end of the 13th century. The church is rectangular, with a protruding church porch and sacristy. Elements of the medieval entrance door have survived in the door between the church porch and the church itself. Inside, the church ceiling is supported by vaults constructed in the 16th century and decorated with frescos, made by an artist known as √ñrjan the Painter in the 1520s. The church is unusually rich in furnishings. It houses three medieval altarpieces. The most ornate one was made in Antwerp and was probably made in 1515. The two others were made in present-day Germany and Sweden respectively and both date from the 15th century. In addition, the church has two crucifixes, also dating from the 15th century and also made in Germany and Sweden respectively. An additional three carved wooden statuettes of saints date from the same century.

Around 1100, it was important for the monastery, which had now become wealthy, to distance itself from the Bishop of Speyer and his influence. To this end a new tradition was established about the origins of the monastery, backed up by forged documents (such forgery was not anything unusual in the Middle Ages). In the case of Weissenburg, the story now ran that the abbey had been founded in 623 by the Merovingian king, Dagobert I. Detailed historic research in recent decades has demonstrated that this was unlikely to have been the case. Weissenburg developed quickly into one of the wealthiest and culturally most significant abbeys in Germany. As early as 682 it was able to purchase shares in a saltworks in Vic-sur-Seille for the princely sum of 500 solidi; in 760 it was given the Mundat Forest. The Gospel Book (Evangelienbuch) written around 860 by a monk, Otfrid of Weissenburg, represented a milestone in the development of German language and literature. At that time the abbey was in the charge of Abbot Grimald of Weissenburg, who was also the Abbot of the Abbey of Saint Gall and chancellor to Emperor Louis the German, and thus was one of the most important figures in the whole of the German imperial church. The abbey lost an important possession, however, when in 985 the Salian Duke Otto appropriated 68 of the parishes belonging to it in the so-called Salian Church Robbery (Salischer Kirchenraub). Above all though, it was the transition from a situation in which the abbey managed its monastic estates itself to a feudal system in which the estates were granted as fiefs, that resulted in the loss of most of the abbey's possessions. This was because, over time, their vassal viewed their fiefs as allods, i.e. as freehold properties. Thus the once extensive monastic estates increasingly evaporated. In the 16th century only three estates were left out of the thousands the abbey used to possess: these were Steinfeld, Schweighofen and Koppelhof; in addition, the abbey had tithe rights in Weissenburg and Bergzabern which gave it an annual income of 1,500 gulden. In 1262‚Äì1293, during the time of its decline, Abbot Edelin attempted to halt the loss of the monastic estates and to recover its stolen property by compiling a record of the abbey's possessions in a new register. This index, called the Codex Edelini or Liber Possessionum, is currently held in the Speyer State Archives (Landesarchiv Speyer). In 1524, the abbey, now entirely destitute, was turned into a secular collegiate church at the instigation of its last abbot, R√ºdiger Fischer, which was then united with the Bishopric of Speyer in 1546. The princely provost of Weissenberg had an individual vote in the Reichsf√ºrstenrat of the Reichstag of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation. In the wake of the French Revolution the foundation was dissolved in 1789. Part of the monastic library went in the 17th century to the Herzog August Library in Wolfenb√ºttel, the abbey records largely perished in the confusion of the revolutionary period.  Estates  In 1764 the secular state of the Princely Propstei of Weissenburg comprised the following offices and estates (in today's spelling): # the Provost's Office with a master of the household (Hofmeister), provost's counsel (Probsteirat), secretaries, architect (Baumeister) and messengers (Boten) # the court (Staffelgericht) in Weissenburg with nine officials # the Fauthei of Schlettenbach with four officials and the villages of Bobenthal, Bundenthal, B√§renbach, Finsternheim and Erlenbach # the Provost's Court (Propsteigericht) in the Zweibr√ºcken district of Kleeburg with three officials # the districts of Altstadt and St. Remig with eleven officials and the villages of Gro√üsteinfeld, Kleinsteinfeld, Kapsweyer, St. Remig, Schweighofen, Schleithal and Oberseebach # the stewardship (Schaffnerei) of Hagenau with two officials for St. Walpurga's Abbey # the Sheriff's Office (Schulthei√üerei) of Uhlweiler near Hagenau Towards the end of the 18th century the territories of the Propstei of Weissenburg covered 28 square miles with 50,000 inhabitants.  List of abbots of Weissenburg  In his abbey chronicle which first appeared in 1551, the theologian and historian, Kaspar Brusch, left a record of the abbots of Weissenburg, which appears to be partly fictitious (at least for the abbots who presided before Dragobodo - to wit the rather stylized name of the supposed first abbot, \\"Principius\\"). In addition Brusch suggests this himself (\\"Nihil enim de his Abbatibus primis aliud scriptum reperi, quorum seriem etiam ac successionem aliquid erroris habere non dubito\\". As the source for the abbots before Adalbertus (No. 23) he discloses that he was given this information by the Bishop of Speyer of that time). * Principius * Cheodonius * Radefridus * Ehrwaldus * Instulphus * Astrammus * Gerbertus * Ehrimbertus * Dragobodo (also Bishop of Speyer) * Charialdus * Bernhardus (or Wernharius; later Bishop of Worms) * David * Wielandus * Grimald, (around 825‚Äì839) * Odgerus (or Odogarius, 839‚Äì847, also Archbishop of Mainz) * Grimald, (847‚Äì872, for the second time) * Volcoldus * Gerochus * Voltwicus * Mimoldus * Adelhardus * Gerrichus * Ercarmius * Adalbertus (abbot from 966, in 968 Archbishop of Magdeburg, died there in 981) * Sanderadus (970‚Äì985.

The Pasadena Museum of History maintains the century-old estate and offers docent-led tours of the Fenyes Mansion, the Curtin House, and the Finnish Folk Art Museum and gardens. In 1905, Dr. Adalbert Fenyes, a Hungarian entomologist and the first Pasadena doctor to use an X-ray machine, and his wife Eva Scott Muse Fenyes commissioned a two-story house from architect Robert D. Farquhar. Designed in the Beaux Arts manner, the mansion was completed at a cost of $20,325, In 1911, architect Sylvanus Marston of Marston & Van Pelt completed an addition consisting of a studio, conservatory, and laboratory. Like many of the large old homes along Orange Grove Boulevard, the Fenyes Mansion reflects the opulent neoclassical tastes popular at the turn of the century. Dr. Fenyes' wife, Eva, was an accomplished artist and world traveler who met her husband in Cairo, Egypt. The estate and gardens were used as sets for a number of early motion pictures for film industry notables such as Douglas Fairbanks and D.W. Griffith. The estate is listed as a Pasadena Cultural Landmark and was added to the National Register of Historic Places . on September 5, 1985. Marston & Van Pelt also designed the 1915 Curtin House, a smaller French-influenced house on the grounds for Eva Fenyes' only daughter, Leonora Curtin, who inherited the mansion from her mother. Leonora Curtin had one daughter also named Leonora who was known as ‚ÄúBabsie‚Äù. A linguist who spent time among the Pueblo Indians, Babsie traveled widely, spending time in Santa Fe and Pasadena until she met Yrjo Alfred Paloheimo, a Finnish diplomat whom she married in 1946. Paloheimo was Finland's Consul for the Southwest area and the Fenyes Mansion served as the Finnish consulate's office for seventeen years. Paloheimo also established the Finnish Folk Art Museum, a Swiss chalet-style building.

Created by writers Dwayne McDuffie and Robert L. Washington III, and artist John Paul Leon, Larry first appeared in Static #1 (June 1993), one of the titles published by Milestone Comics, an imprint of DC Comics. After the closing of Milestone Comics, Larry became part of DC's mainstream universe of characters. He was also featured on the Static Shock TV series from the DCAU and was voiced by Omar Gooding. Publication history Larry Wade appeared in the same issue as Static in Static #1 (June 1993) created by Dwayne McDuffie, Robert L. Washington III & John Paul Leon (artist). Fictional character biography Milestone and DC Universes Larry Wade is one of Virgil Hawkins close friends. He attends Ernest Hemingway High School with Virgil, Daisy Watkins, Frieda Goren & Rick Stone. Like most of the series regulars, Larry didn't know that Virgil was secretly the superhero known as 'Static'. Throughout the original comic series, Larry was one of Virgil's closest friends. Wade was tougher and older than Hawkins and looked out for him when he was being bullied. In the first issue, he protected Virgil after Virgil took a beating from Martin \\"Biz Money B\\" Scaponi. He encouraged Virgil to kill Biz Money B for humiliating him the way he did. He convinced Virgil that his reputation would be nothing if he didn't, gave him a gun and a plan for when and how to kill Biz Money. Thanks to Larry, Virgil knew that Biz Money B was in a gang called the Firecrackers and would be at the Big Bang, where all the Dakota gangs planned to fight it out to see who would run Dakota. Larry gave him a gun, taught him how to shoot it and left him to the task. Virgil couldn't shoot when it came down to it, but because he was at the Big Bang, he was exposed to the experimental gas that transformed many Dakota citizens in different ways. Larry was directly responsible for Virgil becoming Static. Larry and Virgil's friendship was strained when Virgil found out that he was dating Frieda Goren, Virgil's crush. They made peace, but the strain returned when Virgil realized that Larry always had money and nice clothes because he was a gun and drug runner. It came to a head one night when Static was out crime-fighting and found Larry among the criminals he and fellow crime fighter Dusk were beating up. He let Larry go, only to see Larry gunned down by his own suppliers. With his dying breath, Larry let Virgil know he knew that his best friend was Static. At that point, Virgil realized that despite all they had been through, Wade was in fact a true friend. A week after Larry's funeral, Virgil pays his respects at his grave and considered giving up his heroics. Dusk came to him, injured and out of costume, and encouraged him not to quit because he was needed. Larry is also the namesake of Larry Hawkins, the son of Virgil and Frieda who has inherited his father's abilities and grows up to become a superhero.

It is spindly, glabrous shrub with narrow leaves and with flowers that vary in colour from blue to pink, sometimes white. It is native to Western Australia and the Northern Territory. Description Eremophila granitica is an open, straggly shrub which grows to between and which has slender branches covered with red-brown resin. The leaves are arranged alternately and often widely spaced along the branches. They are mostly long, wide, linear in shape, sometimes with a few small teeth near the tip. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils on a hairy stalk long. There are 5 green to purple, egg-shaped to lance-shaped sepals which are long. The petals are long and are joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is white to pale lilac, often darker lilac-coloured on the top and cream to yellowish with purple spots inside. The outside of the tube and petal lobes are hairy but the inside of the lobes is glabrous and the inside of the tube is woolly. The 4 stamens are fully enclosed in the petal tube. Flowering occurs from April to November and is followed by fruits which are dry, woody, oval-shaped with a papery covering and long. E. hughesii habit Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described in 1874 by Victorian Government Botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in his Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae based on plant material collected between Barrow Range and Rawlinson Range during Ernest Giles's expedition. The specific epithet (hughesii) honours Sir Walter Hughes, the founder of the University of Adelaide. Two subspecies are recognized in the Australian Plant Census: *Eremophila hughesii F.Muell. subsp. hughesii which occurs from Laverton to the extreme west of the Northern Territory in the Gascoyne, Gibson Desert and Murchison biogeographic regions; *Eremophila hughesii subsp. sanguinensis Chinnock \\\\- from the western part of Bloods Range in the Northern Territory. Distribution and habitat Eremophila hughesii grows in sand and gravelly soils on sandplains and rocky ridges usually in mulga woodland or spinifex grassland. Conservation status Eremophila hughesii is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture The open, spindly growth form of this eremophila limits its appeal although young specimens can be attractive. It can be propagated from cuttings or by grafting onto Myoporum rootstock and grows best in well-drained soil in a sunny or partially shaded position. Although it is drought tolerant, it is sensitive to frost.

Military cadet organisations  = Air Training Corps = The Air Training Corps (ATC) is a British cadet organisation; a voluntary youth group which is part of the Royal Air Force Air Cadets (formerly known as the Air Cadet Organisation or ACO) and is sponsored by the Royal Air Force (RAF) under No 22 Group. It is supported by the Ministry of Defence; a regular RAF officer served as Commandant Air Cadets at the rank of Air Commodore until 2012, when the post was changed (as part of the ongoing defence cuts) to a Full Time Reserve Service (FTRS) position, also at Air Commodore rank. In 2013, the officer in command of the ATC was Air Commodore Dawn McCafferty. The cadets and the majority of staff are civilians. Although a number of ATC cadets go on to join the RAF or other services every year, the ATC is no longer set up as a recruiting organisation. Activities include sport, hill walking, parade drill, rock climbing, rifle shooting, fieldcraft and other outdoor activities, as well as the study of subjects related to aviation, leading to a national vocational diploma (BTEC in Aviation Studies and others including Teamwork and Leadership). Week-long trips to RAF stations in the UK and abroad, or camps offering adventure training or music, allow the opportunity for cadets to gain a taste of military life and often to gain some flying experience in RAF gliders. A teenager can join at the age of 12 or school year 8 as a junior cadet and earn positions of increasing responsibility in a military rank structure, as well as having increasing skill and competence recognised in a classification scheme. Service as a cadet ends at the age of 20. In 2012, the ATC had around 41,000 cadets aged between 13 and 20 years, in 1009 squadrons. Its cadets are supported by a network of around 10,000 volunteer staff and around 5,000 civilian committee members. = Army Cadet Force = The Army Cadet Force (ACF) is a British youth organisation that offers training and experience around a military training theme including adventurous training, at the same time as promoting achievement, discipline, and good citizenship, to boys and girls aged 12 to 18 years and. It is a separate organisation from the Combined Cadet Force which provides similar training within principally independent schools. Although sponsored by the Ministry of Defence the ACF is not a branch of the British Armed Forces, and as such cadets are not subject to military 'call up'. Some cadets do, however, go on to enlist in the armed forces in later life, and many of the organisation's leaders have been cadets or have a military background. Cadets do participate with the regular army on some occasions, however. = Combined Cadet Force = The Combined Cadet Force (CCF) is a Ministry of Defence sponsored youth organisation in the United Kingdom. Founded in 1948, its aim is to \\"provide a disciplined organisation in a school so that pupils may develop powers of leadership by means of training to promote the qualities of responsibility, self reliance, resourcefulness, endurance and perseverance\\". It is not a pre-service organisation, although it acknowledges that one of its objectives is \\"to encourage those who have an interest in the services to become Officers of the Regular or Reserve Forces\\", and a significant number of officers have indeed had experience in the CCF. Prior to 1948 cadet forces in schools existed as the junior division of the Officers' Training Corps framework, but in 1948 Combined Cadet Force was formed covering cadets affiliated to all three services. = Girls Venture Corps Air Cadets = The Girls Venture Corps Air Cadets (GVCAC) is a voluntary uniformed youth organisation for girls aged between 11 and 20, It is also a registered charity,http://www.charitiestrust.org/charities/GirlsVentureCorpsAirCadets/index.html and by virtue of its work towards the personal and social development of young people, it is a member of The National Council for Voluntary Youth Services (NCVYS).Full list of NCVYS members The current Corps Director is Brenda Layne, MBE, and the Corps Commandant is Yvonne McCarthy.

Cadets follow similar rates and ranks, traditions, values and ethos as their parent service, the Royal Navy for the Sea cadets and for the Royal Marines Cadets the Royal Marines. Whilst the SCC is not a pre-service organisation, a significant minority of former Sea Cadets and Royal Marines Cadets do go on to join the Royal Navy, Royal Marines or other sections of the Armed Forces.  Uniformed services cadet organisations  = Fire Cadets = Many Fire Brigades in the United Kingdom offer a cadet service to young people. The main aim of the Cadet Service is to provide a disciplined environment for young people aged 13 to 18 years of age from all sectors of society to learn basic fire service skills and core values.

These groups are designed to provide a sense of what it is like to be a police officer, by getting cadets involved in various police related activities, such as crime prevention projects. Some forces allow cadets to go out on patrol with Police Officers in connection with non- confrontational policing duties, once they reach the age of 14. Each scheme is sponsored by a statutory police service, although it has a separate identity, and in that sense is more distant from regular policing than the work of the former full-time Police Cadets. In most forces there are no formal entry requirements to become a cadet.  Scouting organisations  = Baden-Powell Scouts' Association = The Baden-Powell Scouts' Association was formed in the United Kingdom in 1970 when it was felt that The Scout Association was abandoning the traditions and intentions set out by Baden-Powell in 1908. The Baden-Powell Scouts retain the belief that the essence of the movement should be based on outdoor activities related to the skills of explorers, backwoodsmen and frontiersmen. It is a voluntary, non-formal educational charity movement for young people. It is independent, non-political, non- military, and open to all without distinction of origin, race, creed or gender, in accordance with the purpose, principles and method conceived by Robert Baden-Powell.

At present about one in four of all eight-year-old girls in the UK are Brownies.Surprising facts about Girlguiding Girlguiding is a charitable organisation and adult leaders are not paid for their time. For this reason, and for its work aiming for the personal and social development of young people, Girlguiding is a member of The National Council for Voluntary Youth Services (NCVYS).Full list of NCVYS members = Kibbo Kift = The Kibbo Kift was a youth organisation in the UK between 1920 and 1951. The Kibbo Kift (archaic Kentish dialect for 'proof of great strength'Andrew Marr, The Making of Modern Britain, Macmillan, 2009.) has been described as 'the only genuine English national movement of modern times'.Professor L.P. Elwell-Smith, Introduction to John Hargrave, The Confession of the Kibbo Kift, London, 1927; facsimile 1979. The Kibbo Kift was to be not merely a youth organisation but was to involve all ages and, very daring for the times, it was open to both sexes. The ideas of world peace and the regeneration of urban man through the open-air life replaced the nationalism and militarism Hargrave had detested in the post-World War I Scouts. By 1932 the Anglo-Saxon costumes, camping, hiking and woodcraft had been replaced by military uniform, marching and propagandising. The name was changed to the Green Shirt Movement for Social Credit, and later to the Social Credit Party of Great Britain. The organisation was wound up in 1951. = Navigators UK = Navigators UK is a branch of Navigators USA, an American non-aligned Scouting organization that was founded in 2003 in New York City.

The first Young Farmers' Club opened in 1921 in Hemyock, Devon, where the United Dairies milk factory set children of the area's milk producers the task of calf rearing, with competitions and prizes for those achieving the highest standards. Over the next decade more clubs opened to provide agricultural education, with the focus on the keeping of growing and living things including calves, pigs, poultry, bees and gardens. After the death of one of YFC's original founders and greatest inspirations, Lord Northcliffe, in 1922 the Ministry of Agriculture took on development of the organisation. But within six years it was proving difficult for it to offer the type of help needed by the members to organise the 50 clubs or offer guidance on the rural social role Young Farmers' Clubs were assuming. Membership is steadily increasing and there is a significant increase in the number of junior members joining the organisation.

These differ from general criminal processes, and are governed by different principles.  Law governing child and youth justice  = Historical context = New Zealand has historically focused on a welfare model for youth offenders, which put the child's needs at the forefront. This often involved taking the child away from their family and by putting them into institutions. The Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Act 1989 (CYPTFA) signified a shift away from this to a family-based process and justice model, which views state intervention as a last resort. The argument supporting this was that the community needed to be kept together, and these ties were important for helping youth. = Current domestic context = New Zealand legislation differentiates justice processes for under-17-year-olds. The CYPTFA governs these processes.Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Act 1989, Part 4 and 5. They are diversion-focused, and include the dual aim of rehabilitation and accountability. Other legislation is also relevant, particularly the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 (NZBORA). This includes a child's right to be dealt with in a manner that takes into account their age.New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, s. 23.  Overview of CYPTFA  The CYPTFA creates two separate justice processes for children and youth. This differentiation is based on the attitude that younger people are more vulnerable and have a more immature judgment, and this should be accounted for. The different processes recognise the child or youth's offending in a manner that acknowledges their higher needs and vulnerability. Thus, levels of culpability are determined by age group. However, major legislative changes now allow children to be prosecuted if the crime is sufficiently severe.Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Act 1989, s. 272. The Act aims to promote the well-being of children, young persons and their families. The process is aimed to reduce the levels of youth incarceration and constructively deal with issues and problems created by youth and children.Her Honour Judge Carolyn Henwood \\"The Children, Young Persons and Their Families Act 1989 (NZ) ‚Äì A Judicial Perspective in 1997\\", Address on 22 July 1997 at Judicial Commission of New South Wales Seminar Series, published (1998) TJR 215, 215. This is done by holding the child or young person accountable for their behaviour and encouraging them to accept responsibility for their offending, while taking into account their needs and ensuring they are given the chance to develop beneficially from the experience.  Principles from CYPTFA  Principles governing youth justice reflect different objectives from traditional criminal prosecution.Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Act 1989, s. 4. These are: * Avoidance of criminal proceedings when possible; * Criminal proceedings are not to be used as a means of delivering welfare; * Strengthening family and whanau; * Keeping children and young persons in the community; * Age as a mitigating factor; * Sanctions should promote young person‚Äôs development within family and whanau, and be least restrictive in form; * Regard for victims interests; and * Special provisions to address vulnerability of children and young persons.  Definitions ‚Äì Child and youth  A child under the age of ten cannot be convicted of an offence.Crimes Act 1961, s. 21. If the child is aged 10 or 11, they can be prosecuted for murder or manslaughter. If the offender is aged 12 or 13, they can only be prosecuted for an offence if the maximum penalty is 14 years imprisonment or more, or if the maximum penalty is 10 years imprisonment or more if they are a repeat offender and the previous offence had a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment or more.Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Act 1989, section 272 All children aged between 10 and 13 have a rebuttable presumption of incapacity to commit a crime.Crimes Act 1961, s. 22. Young persons aged 14 to 16 may be prosecuted for any crime, unless a higher age limit is stated in the specific legislation (e.g. people under 16 cannot be convicted of incest). If the child is brought within the court system, the judge has a discretion to not use the criminal process and direct them towards social welfare.Crimes Act 1961, s. 280(a). When the child offender does not fall into these categories, they are dealt with under the care and protection provisions of CYPTFA, or by the police, which are governed by youth justice principles.Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Act 1989, s. 280. If between 14 and 17, the court will have regard to the age of the offender.Crimes Act 1961, s. 9(2)(a). If the crime is dealt with in the Youth Court, then the Youth Justice Act and youth principles will apply. However the offender can be sent to the District Court or High Court for sentencing or trial, where the Sentencing Act 2002 applies. Under the Sentencing Act 2002, a child or young person under 17 cannot be sentenced to prison or home detention unless they commit a Category 4 offence (e.g. murder, manslaughter, crimes against the State) or an offence where the maximum penalty is 14 years imprisonment or more. = International context = There are several international conventions that affect youth justice, most significantly the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child 1990 (UNCROC), which New Zealand ratified in 1993. This requires New Zealand to submit regular reports on the status of children's rights. The latest UN recommendations in response to this has expressed concern about the low age of criminal responsibility, and that NZ has lowered it from 14 to 12 for grave and repeated offences.http://www.hrc.co.nz/international-human-rights-new/new-zealands- international-obligations/united-nations-convention-on-the-rights-of-the- child/ There is also concern that CYPTFA only extends youth justice protections to 17 years, where UNCROC has defined a \\"child\\" up unto 18 years. Once young people turn 17, they are dealt with in adult courts, although age can be taken as a mitigating factor.Becroft, Andrew J.'Children and Young People in Conflict with the Law: Asking the Hard Questions' in Juvenile and Family Court Journal, Issue 4 Fall 2006, p. 5.  Children and young persons justice processes  CYPTFA established an alternative system of dealing with child and youth offenders through Family Group Conferences (FGC) and the Youth Court, with the exception of non-imprisonable traffic offences in the case of young persons. This is combined with various policies employed by the police to decrease the use of the court system when possible. = Family Group Conferences = The first step is the FGC, which is used as both a pre- and post-charge mechanism.Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Act 1989, s. 247. They are designed to encourage collaborative decision-making by all affected parties, reflecting Maori custom.McElrea, F. 'Restorative Justice. The New Zealand Youth Court: A Model for Development in Other Courts?' at National Conference of District Court Judges, April 1994, Rotorua. Their purpose is to provide recommendation and make decisions that are thought to be \\"necessary or desirable in relation to the child or young person in respect of whom the conference was convened\\".Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Act 1989, s. 260. If a unanimous decision is not reached, the case can go to the youth court judge. Pre-charge FGCs account for 40% of FGCs, and are employed to determine whether prosecution can be avoided.http://www.justice.govt.nz/courts/youth/about-the-youth-court/family- group-conference Post-charge, they determine how to deal with cases admitted or proved in the Youth Court.  Criticisms  There is limited data on the effectiveness of FGCs. The focus on the family has been criticised as sometimes resulting in a tension between promoting the child‚Äôs development while also addressing underlying causes for their offending, such as their family. The system may not work well for those who come from dysfunctional families, as youth justice principles aim to keep the child with their family, but this is on the assumption that the family has the ability and the interest to control young people and believes offending is not acceptable. For young people such as these, the youth justice system may be better able to provide guidance.Braithwaite, J. 'What is to be Done About Criminal Justice?' in B J Brown & F W M McElrea (eds.) The Youth Court in New Zealand: A New Model of Justice, Legal Research Foundation, Auckland (1993), p. 32-40. = Police role = Police play a major role in youth justice, and such cases are governed by the principle that criminal proceedings should not be used if there is an alternative way of dealing with the offending. This means that most child and youth apprehensions are dismissed by way of police warning, cautions, or diversion. 62% of youth crime is handled by police without moving onward to FGCs or Youth Court. Police have two statutory alternatives to the formal criminal justice process.Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Act 1989, s. 209.  Police warnings  Police officers are able to issue a warning where appropriate and consider that sufficient. There will be written notice of the warning. Warnings may be issued when the police officer is satisfied the person is guilty, but do not need an admission of guilt. Warnings have been criticised as they may end up on the youth‚Äôs record regardless of whether the young person is guilty or not. Additionally, it may label them as acting with criminal behaviour when they did nothing.  Formal police cautions  These are a more formal alternative to warnings.Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Act 1989, s. 111. This follows the Family Group Conference approach, and is one of the possible outcomes.  Diversions  This is a possible police option and is widely used for minor child and youth offending. This is a discretionary response and offers a lot of flexibility to the Police Youth Aid who administers it. Practical examples of potential actions are: * an apology to the victim, * restitution or reparation, * possible curfew, * maintenance of school attendance, * completing an assignment on the effects of their offending; and * sometimes permitting the police to take and keep photographs or fingerprints on file. There is no need for a FGC, and the process considers a number of criteria. Using identity evidence as a bargaining tool has been questioned, as usually police are not able to hold such information unless the offender has been questioned. = Criticisms of the relationship between FGC and the police = The relationship between FGC and police diversion has been questioned. Diversion challenges the primacy of FGCs, as 62% of cases do not get to FGCs, and are instead dealt with by the police.Jim Chong \\"Youth Justice Statistics in New Zealand: 1992 to 2006\\" (Prepared for Ministry of Justice) Table 3.12. The police refer around 6% of cases to FGCs, and outcomes here are agreed and implemented, typically without referral to the Court. The other 29% of cases involve youths being arrested and directly referred to the Youth Court, who have an obligation to refer all proved cases under its jurisdiction to a FGC for a recommendation.Jim Chong \\"Youth Justice Statistics in New Zealand: 1992 to 2006\\" (Prepared for Ministry of Justice) Table 3.12. The reasoning for this is unclear, but it is questioned if it is useful to divert and keep the youth out of the system, or if this process is undermining the process and role of the family. Police motives are also questioned. It is argued that police are avoiding FGCs because either they want to keep people out of the system or they do not trust it as an option. = Youth Court = The Youth Court is less formal than other courts, and the judge is more active in explaining the procedure as well as gathering data. The punishments are less severe, and are grouped depending on their restrictiveness into seven categories.Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Act 1989, s. 282. The court has a stronger focus on restorative justice, reflected in the involvement of the victims, the young person's understanding and co-operation in the proceedings, acknowledgement of the power imbalanced by proving all young people with a lawyer, and the restorative justice outcomes promoted.Becroft, A. 'Restorative Justice in the Youth Court: A Square Peg in a Round Hole?' in Restorative Justice Online (May 2006). The Youth Court is a subdivision of the District Court and has the same general status and powers. Youth Court decisions are appealed to the High Court.Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Act 1989, section 351  Youth offending trends  Youth are over-represented in the criminal justice system. Young people aged 14‚Äì16 account for around 15% of all police arrests, which is second only to 17- to 20-year-olds.Jin Chong, Youth Justice Statistics in New Zealand: 1992 to 2006, table 3.2. However, the number of apprehensions is decreasing.Ministry of Justice, 'Trends in Child and Youth Prosecutions in New Zealand 2002‚Äì2011' (2012). The number and rate of youth appearing in court is also declining, with only the most serious cases reaching court. Nearly 80% of child and youth cases are dealt with by FGCs or police alternative actions, including diversions, before reaching court.Ministry of Justice, 'Trends in Child and Youth Prosecutions in New Zealand 2002‚Äì2011' (2012). = Characteristics of youth offenders =  Gender  In line with adult statistics, the majority of youth appearing in court are male. While the rate of males appearing in court has substantially decreased in recent years, they still account for 79% of young people appearing in court. The rate of females appearing in court has also decreased; however it is less marked that males.  Ethnicity  While the number of children and young people recorded as MƒÅori has decreased, they are still over-represented in court. Around 20 percent of the youth population is MƒÅori, yet MƒÅori account for 54% of all children and youth in court. The number of children and young people recorded as European appearing in court has decreased most substantially. Between 2002 and 2011, the rate dropped by 18%.

Ajax fans (few of whom are actually Jewish) responded by embracing Ajax's \\"Jewish\\" identity: calling themselves \\"super Jews\\", chanting \\"Joden, Joden\\"\\" (Jews, Jews) at games, and adopting Jewish symbols such as the Star of David and the Israeli flag. This Jewish imagery eventually became a central part of Ajax fans' culture. At one point ringtones of \\"Hava Nagila\\", a Hebrew folk song, could be downloaded from the club's official website. Beginning in the 1980s, fans of Ajax's rivals escalated their antisemitic rhetoric, chanting slogans like \\"Hamas, Hamas/all Jews to the gas\\" (\\"Hamas, hamas, alle joden aan het gas\\"), hissing to imitate the flow of gas, giving Nazi salutes, etc. The eventual result was that many (genuinely) Jewish Ajax fans stopped going to games. In the 2000s the club began trying to persuade fans to drop their Jewish image, yet have achieved no success in this pursuit. Supporters, on and off the field, still employ imagery associated with Jewish history and the Israeli nation.

After showing useful, but unexceptional form in his early career he emerged as a major talent with a win in the 2013 Autumn edition of the Tenno Sho. In March 2014 he ran outside Japan for the first time and won the Dubai Duty Free by more than six lengths. By April 2014 he was the top-rated in the world and retained his position throughout the year. Background Just A Way is a bay horse with a white star and white socks on his hind legs bred in Hokkaido by the Shadai Corporation. He was from the second crop of foals sired by Heart's Cry a horse whose wins included the Arima Kinen and the Dubai Sheema Classic. His dam, Sibyl was a Japanese-bred daughter of the Breeders' Cup Classic winner Wild Again and the CCA Oaks winner Charon. As a descendant of the broodmare Venturesome, Charon was distantly related to several major winners including Silver Patriarch, Touch Gold, Discreet Cat, With Approval and Izvestia. In July 2010, the yearling was consigned by the Shiraoi Farm to the JRHA Select Sale and was bought for 12 million yen by Akatsuki Yamatoya. The name came from that of a toy in episode 32 of the anime series Gintama, the script for which was written by Yamatoya. Racing career =2011: two- year-old season= Just A Way made a successful debut on 23 July 2011 when he won a maiden race over 1600 metres at Niigata Racecourse. He was moved up to Grade 3 level at the same course in September and finished second when 7/10 favourite for the Niigata Nisai Stakes. On his final appearance of the season he finished fourth behind Deep Brillante in the Tokyo Sports Hai Nisai Stakes Grade 3 at Tokyo Racecourse in November. =2012: three-year-old season= In February 2012, Just A Way finished fourth in the Grade 3 Kisaragi Sho and then recorded his first important success when winning the Grade 3 Arlington Cup over one mile at Hanshin Racecourse. He was then moved up to Grade 1 class in May and finished unplaced in both the NHK Mile Cup and the Japanese Derby. After a break of four months, Just A Way returned in autumn to finish second in the Grade 2 Mainichi Okan and sixth in the Tenno Sho. =2013: four-year- old season= Just A Way was beaten in his first five races, competing in Grade 2 and Grade 3 races. He finished third in the Nikkan Sports Sho and second in the Epsom Cup, Sekiya Kinen and Mainichi Okan. On 27 October, Just A Way started at odds of 14.5/1 for the Grade 1 Tenno Sho over ten furlongs at Tokyo. The Japanese Horse of the Year Gentildonna started favourite for the race ahead of Tokei Halo and Eishin Flash who had won the race in the previous year. Ridden by Yuichi Fukunaga, Just A Way was not among the early leaders but began to make progress with a quarter of a mile left to run. He took the lead a furlong from the finish and drew clear in the closing stages to win by four lengths from Gentildonna in \\"impressive\\" style. After the race Fukunaga said: \\"In his previous race I felt he was getting stronger, so I expected his success today.\\" =2014: five-year-old season= Just A Way began his fourth season in the Nakayama Kinen on 3 March and won by three and a half lengths from Archimedes. He was then sent to Dubai where he started 3/1 favourite for the Dubai Duty Free over nine furlongs at Meydan Racecourse. His opponents included the British mares The Fugue and Dank as well as runners from South Africa, France, Dubai and Hong Kong. He was restrained towards the rear of the field by Fukunaga before moving forward in the straight. He took the lead a furlong and a half from the finish and accelerated clear to win by six and a quarter lengths from the South African horse Vercingetorix with Dank in third place. Fukunaga commented: \\"That was amazing. The start didn't go as I hoped it would and I had to change my plan but it all worked out for me\\". On his return to Japan, Just A Way was moved back in distance for the Yasuda Kinen over 1600 metres at Tokyo on 8 June. Despite doubts about his ability to cope with the soft turf he was made 7/10 favourite against sixteen opponents, with Yoshitomi Shibata taking over from the suspended Fukunaga. He looked likely to be beaten in the straight as the 147/1 outsider Grand Prix Boss established a clear lead, but produced a strong finish to take the lead in the last stride and win by a nose. In autumn, Just A Way was one of three Japanese horses, the others being Gold Ship and Harp Star, sent to Europe to contest the 93rd running of the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp Racecourse. Racing over a distance of 2400 metres for the first time for more than two and a half years, he started the 8/1 fifth choice in the betting behind Taghrooda, Avenir Certain, Ectot and Harp Star. He raced in mid-division before making some progress in the straight but never looked likely to win and finished eighth of the twenty runners, five lengths behind the winner Treve. On his return to Japan, Just A Way continued to compete over longer distances and started third favourite behind Gentildonna and Harp Star for the Japan Cup on 30 October. He finished second of the eighteen runners, four lengths behind the winner Epiphaneia. On his final racecourse appearance, Just A Way was stepped up in distance again for the Arima Kinen over 2500 metres on 28 December and started third favourite behind Gold Ship and Epiphaneia. After being held up at the back of the field by Fukunaga he made progress on the outside in the straight but was unable to reach the leaders and finished fourth behind Gentildonna, To The World and Gold Ship. Assessment and awards In the April edition of the World's Best Racehorse Rankings Just A Way was placed first, five pounds ahead of Game On Dude. His rating of 130 was the highest achieved so early in the year since Curlin in 2008. In the polling for the 2014 JRA Award Just A Way was elected Best Older Male Horse, taking 242 of the 285 votes beating Epiphaneia (31 votes) and Gold Ship (11 votes). He also finished runner-up to Gentildonna in the Japanese Horse of the Year poll and third to Snow Dragon in voting for the JRA Award for Best Sprinter or Miler. When the 2014 World's Best Racehorse Rankings were published in January 2015, Just A Way was rated the best horse to race anywhere in the world in 2014, one pound ahead of Epiphaneia and two ahead of Able Friend, Australia, Kingman, The Grey Gatsby and Variety Club.

The mission was detained in Baku, Azerbaijan, following the latter's invasion by the Red Army and the subsequent change of government. The party was imprisoned for six months until released in a prisoner exchange.  Background  From September 1918 to May 1919, Commodore David Norris RN had built up a flotilla of armed merchant cruisers (AMC) with which, by May 1919, he had wrested control of the Caspian Sea from the Soviet Navy. When Britain withdrew its forces from the area in August 1919, eight AMCs of the Caspian Flotilla were handed over to General Denikin's Volunteer Army.The Naval Review 1920 - The Royal Navy on the Caspian, 1918-1919, p. 218. But in March 1920, advances by the Soviet Red Army threatened the flotilla's base of Petrovsk (now Makhachkala) and General Erdeli (whom Denikin had appointed Russian Governor of Daghestan) was compelled to evacuate his forces by sea. With no other safe port to go to, the flotilla sailed to Enzeli, on the North Persian coast, where a detachment of Norperforce was stationed under the command of General Bateman-Champain. The sudden arrival of fourteen ships (six AMCs and eight transports) on 22 March 1920, had caught both Champain and the Persian authorities unprepared. The Persians responded by interning all the ships and ordering that they be disarmed. Champain had no naval personnel in Norperforce, so he requested Royal Navy assistance. The request was granted by Admiral John de Robeck, the high commissioner at Constantinople, despite his misgivings. He had previously advised the Admiralty in January, about a proposed earlier mission, that it should not proceed unless Baku was re-occupied and the safety of the Batum- Baku railway assured. Nevertheless, a party of volunteers (five officers and twenty six ratings) was assembled from ships at Constantinople.  The naval mission  Red Army in Baku, Azerbaijan in May 1920 Led by Commander B.A. Fraser (later Admiral Lord Fraser of North Cape), the naval party assembled at HMS Julius, the harbour craft base at Constantinople. From its composition of a shipwright, blacksmith, ordnance artificers and engine room artificers, amongst others, it would appear that the party's purpose was the upkeep of the armed merchant cruisers, and possibly their disarmament; the small size of the party precluded any offensive intentions. The party sailed from Constantinople in HMS Gardenia, across the Black Sea, arriving at the British-occupied Georgian port of Batum on 21 April, where they awaited further orders. After the arrival of de Robeck next day, and on receiving the report of Commander Luke (the chief commissioner at Tiflis), they were allowed to depart by train on 23 April. Their planned route was by train from Batum to Baku, Azerbaijan by way of Tiflis, Georgia, then by ship to Enzeli. After a journey of four days, they arrived at Baku on 27 April at about 16.00, to be greeted with the news that the Soviet 11th Army had crossed the northern frontier of Azerbaijan at 01.00 that same morning. Owing to the general disorganisation at the station due to the need of many special trains, their train was stuck there for several hours waiting to proceed to the docks. Later that evening, a commissar appeared and said they were to consider themselves as prisoners.The Northern Advocate, 1 February 1921, page 4  Imprisonment  The naval party was kept in the train under guard at the station for four days, until 1 May when a commissar came and said they were to be moved into the town. They were marched a mile to the Cheresvichaika where they were searched and everything taken away. The next day, they were moved to the Bailoff Prison, where they were allotted three small cells, each about 10 feet square, each with a small window high up in the wall and little else. A fourth cell was used to accommodate other British civilian prisoners amongst whom was the British vice-consul, Mr. Hewelcke. There were vermin everywhere, and by way of welcome a packet full of lice was pushed through the grating in the doors of the cells. Sanitary arrangements were practically non-existent, as there were only three filthy latrines for some 350 prisoners. The cells were only opened for half an hour each evening, when exercise was allowed in a small courtyard, in which there was a tap and trough - the only washing facilities provided. For the first two weeks the food consisted of one pound of black bread per head, with a little rice. On 5 May, the Admiralty received the news that the naval party had been detained by the Bolsheviks at Baku. = Life in Bailoff Prison = On 10 May Mr. Hewelcke, was taken and transferred to the condemned cell, waiting to be shot. Twice during the night cars came to take them away, but each time the execution was postponed. Commander Fraser managed to persuade an interpreter to contact the Dutch Consul, and requested him to look after the safety of Mr. Hewelcke and to supply the party with food. After several days in the condemned cell, on 16 May, Hewelcke was taken ill and removed to the prison hospital which had no medicines, nurses or bedding, except what the patients could provide themselves. The food supplied was exactly similar to that given to the remainder of the prisoners. In the meantime, the Dutch consul had arranged for a Mr. Seaman (one of the few British citizens who had not been arrested) to send in meals for the whole party each day. From about 18 May onwards, the prison regulations were gradually relaxed, until they were allowed in the courtyard from 08.30 until 19.00 each day. The condemned cell was next to one in which the naval prisoners were held and, at the beginning of June, executions began. Each night, at about 23.00, prisoners from the condemned cell were taken out into the courtyard and shot against the wall underneath the barred window of one of the naval cells. = Living together = In one cell there were the five officers and five men; the officers taught the men bridge, and the men taught the officers solo whist. Cards were forbidden, but they managed to play in the evenings by leaving a man standing by the door so that the peephole was covered. Later, when released, each man in the cell kept one card as a souvenir, signed on the back by all the others.Commander Fraser - The Hobart Mercury 4 February 1921 On St. George's Day, red, white and blue rosettes were made from a signalman's flag. They were questioned about it by the prison authorities, who said no more about it when told it was being done in celebration their national day. Clothing was maintained by a system of borrowing and lending. Most of the sailors had kept their 'housewives' (sewing and repair kits); so when part of one person's trousers required mending, another would cut off the bottom of his, which was then used to patch the worn trousers. Some had also managed to keep a razor, despite the many searches, so that they were able to shave, but most had to grow beards. Knives were confiscated and replaced with wooden spoons. Their bread ration, which was as hard as a brick, had to be broken by hand as best they could. After protests, a knife would be allowed for a few days, then it would be taken away again. = Health = There were several cases of jaundice and many suffered from boils. Most of the party were suffering from stomach troubles, and the remainder from malaria; but nothing could he done for them as no medicines were available, except to make them comfortable. Their sickberth steward acted as doctor for the party, but with little equipment, he was forced to improvise. He used the blade of a safety razor for minor surgical operations, and extracted teeth with a pair of wire nippers. = Move to a disused school = In August they were moved from Bailoff prison to a disused school which was in a state of disrepair. They were still given only prison rations of 1 lb. of black bread per day; everything else they had to buy for themselves, which they were able to do as the Royal Navy had sent money to them in July.  Negotiations  In the meantime, the efforts of the British Government to have the prisoners released were directed mainly at the Soviet trade delegation in London. Despite British support for the White Russians against them, the Soviets were desperate to acquire much needed goods and, pragmatically, put their animosity towards Britain to one side for the duration, and negotiations began in early June.Curzon - Hansard 7 June 1920 The Soviets wanted finished goods such as mining gear, machine tools, electric plant, medical appliances and drugs, agricultural machinery, locomotives and railway material, and in exchange, were offering mainly raw materials such as cereals, oil, timber, minerals, etc.Bonar Law, Hansard 1 July 1920 On 6 July, it was stated in Parliament \\"that it has been made clear to the Soviet trade delegation that until the release of all British prisoners in Russia takes place, no trade will be permitted between Russia and the United Kingdom.\\"Harmsworth - Hansard 6 July 1920 From its North Russia intervention, Britain had retained about 100 Soviet prisoners, who were taken to Britain to be held as hostages,Churchill - Hansard 12 February 1920 and were offered, with other prisoners held in Egypt and elsewhere, in exchange for all British prisoners held in Russia. The Soviet delegation accepted the principle of a prisoner exchange, but its leader, Krassin, said that the prisoners held in Baku were not their responsibility, but that of the Azerbaijan government (knowing full well the Soviet 11th Army occupied Azerbaijan, and its government would do whatever the Soviets told them). As a result of this pressure, the prisoner's conditions began to improve while negotiations continued. But diplomatic wheels turn slowly, and it wasn't until 13 October that a note was received from the Soviet Government stating that the evacuation of all British subjects is to be carried out without delay in exchange for the Russians in Great Britain, Egypt, and elsewhere, who wish to return to Soviet Russia.Chamberlain - Hansard 21 October 1920 It was finally agreed that 300 Russian prisoners from Egypt and Constantinople would be exchanged for all the British prisoners held in Baku.Bonar Law - Hansard 26 October 1920 On 31 October, a telegram was received from the President of the Government of Azerbaijan:  Release  On 4 November, the naval party was told to prepare to travel to Tiflis. At 16.00 the next day, sixty one British prisoners boarded the train to Tiflis. They reached Akstafa, a small town five miles from the frontier at 14.00 on the 6th, and waited for a day amidst snow and bad weather, during which time the remainder of their gear was searched through again. Before allowing the train proceed to Tiflis, the Georgian Government, who were acting as intermediaries, were waiting for confirmation that the 300 Russian exchange prisoners from Egypt and Constantinople had arrived at the Black Sea port of Odessa, Ukraine. Finally, they were allowed to proceed and crossed the frontier at 17.00 on 7 November, arriving at Tiflis the next day, all in good health. From Tiflis they travelled on to Batum, then sailed first to Constantinople then, on 12 November, departed Constantinople in HMS Heliotrope calling in at Malta where one man was detained in hospital while the others continued on board. The naval party arrived at Portsmouth on 1 December where they were greeted on the quayside by Commander Fraser who had arrived five days earlier, having travelled on ahead to report to the Admiralty. Twenty four years later, Admiral Fraser, as commander-in-chief of the Home Fleet, was awarded the Order of Suvorov 1st Class by the Soviet Union for his part in the sinking of the Scharnhorst in the Battle of the North Cape.

In 2017 he started collaborating with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and was named Senior Advisor on the Future of Aviation in 2018. =Concept designs= Bombardier began publishing his concepts in 2013. As of February 2019, he had published and shared over 325 concepts openly ranging from recreational products to cars, boats & aircraft Each of his concepts includes a brief project description. Bombardier collaborates with industrial designers from around the world to convert his vision into 3D models and graphic images. Bombardier does not patent his ideas, he publishes them on Imaginactive.org to inspire the public, foster innovation and gather feedback to improve his ideas. =Skreemr and Antipode Supersonic Aircraft= The Skreemr and Antipode concepts depict two types of hypersonic aircraft concepts able to fly from New York to London in less than 11 minutes Reusable rocket boosters would initially accelerate and propel the aircraft to Mach 5, after which, scramjets engines would take over and continue accelerating them up to Mach 24. An opening in the Antipode's nose would expel counter-flowing jets of air to cool the aircraft surface and reduced its sonic booms. This technology, dubbed long penetration mode (LPM), was inspired by a NASA study. Both concepts were featured in many magazines including Popular Mechanics and Architectural Digest, CNN and Forbes amongst others. =Seataci= The Seataci is a yacht concept that uses a biomimetic propulsion system resembling the movement of whale's tail. Its main hull would be lowered underwater, providing passengers with an excellent underwater view of the coral reefs and marine life. It features a dozen villas and two landing pads specially designed for personal flying drones. It received a lot of press around the world and appeared in Forbes, Business Insider and hundreds of other websites around the world. =The Solar Express= The Solar Express is a space train that would be designed and used to ferry humans, supplies and minerals between celestial bodies and space stations in our solar system. It would run non-stop, so smaller vessels would need to catch the train when it passed by. It provides an artist's rendering of a Mars cycler spacecraft. The Solar Express concept generated thousands of articles around the globe in dozens of languages including Chinese, Arabic, German, Italian, Russian and many others.

It is a blackish to greyish lithified claystone. The known occurrence of this rock is a graptolitic argillite of the T√ºrisalu Formation in northern Estonia and northeast Russia. It is correlated with Swedish alum shale being its younger facial eastward continuation, and both being a part of the Baltoscandic Cambrian-Ordovician black shale, together with black shales in the Oslo region in Norway, Bornholm, Denmark, and Poland. Other known occurrences are in North America,Dover et al. (1980), p. 1 the Malay Peninsula, and New Zealand. Although the name dictyonema argillite is widely used instead of graptolitic argillite, this name is now considered a misnomer as the graptolite fossils in the rock, earlier considered dictyonemids, were reclassified during the 1980s as members of the genus Rhabdinopora.Aaloe et al.

The thickness of the layer varies from less than to a maximum of in western Estonia, as does its subsurface depth, which ranges from . It formed some 480 million years ago. The composition of graptolitic argillite varies by location within Estonia. Its organic content ranges from 10 to 20% and its sulfur content is 2-4%. Correspondingly, its calorific value is 5-8 megajoules per kilogram (MJ/kg) and Fischer Assay oil yield is 3-5%. In northeastern Estonia its carbon-to-hydrogen atomic ratio is about nine. Graptolitic argillite from the northeastern region contains up to 9% pyrite (generally between 2.4 and 6%), heavy metals such as uranium (up to 1,200 parts per million (ppm) or 300 grammes per tonne (g/t)), molybdenum (up to 1,000 ppm or 600 g/t), vanadium (up to 1,600 ppm or 1,200 g/t), and nickel, and other minerals including K-feldspars, quartz, clay minerals, light-brown phosphatic ooids, and accessory amounts of zircon, tourmaline, garnet, rutile, chalcopyrite, and glauconite. Graptolitic argillite from the northwestern region contains fewer metals than are present in deposits in the northeast; it also contains more clay minerals. Rock in these deposits contains corundum, amphiboles, and kyanite. Geological reserves of graptolitic argillite in Estonia have been estimated at 60‚Äì70 billion tonnes. Although resource of graptolitic argillite exceeds that of kukersite, attempts to use it as an energy source have been unsuccessful due to its low calorific value and high content of sulfur. However, it contains potentially about 2.1 billion tonnes of oil. In addition, graptolitic argillite in Estonia contains 5.67 million tonnes of uranium which makes it one of the future main potential uranium sources in Europe. Graptolitic argillite in Estonia contains also 16.53 million tonnes of zinc and 12.76 million tonnes of molybdenum; however, there is no the environmental-friendly and economical technology to extract those metals yet.

History Since 1872, schools offering an education in English and serving the expatriate community have existed in Japan. Four current JCIS member schools can trace their origins to before the First World War. The number of schools burgeoned in the 1950s and 1960s. When school representatives met for the first time in October 1965, they discovered that they shared many of the same problems.

The parish lies to the east and north of the town of Ennis. The M18 motorway runs through the parish from north to south. A 1942-43 description described it as \\"a very undulating parish, and its good and bad land is just as much mixed as its contour.\\" The only village or town at that time was Barefield, a small cluster of houses, and the only industry was agriculture. Public buildings The most important public building in 1942 was the County Clare Lunatic Asylum, a large stone building set in of farmland. There were schools at Doora, Barefield and Knocknane. Today there are still three national schools, the Knockanean National School, Doora National School and Barefield National School. Parish churches are St. Brecan‚Äôs Church in Doora, the Church of the Immaculate Conception in Barefield and the Church of Our Lady in Roslevan. Associations The Doora Barefield CCE is a group of musicians devoted to playing and promoting Irish music.

He served as an interpreter for Prime Minister Winston Churchill during the war, often accompanying Churchill to summits with other world leaders. Lunghi was one of the last living participants of the \\"Big Three\\" meetings between Allied leaders at Tehran, Yalta and Potsdam. Lunghi was the first British soldier to enter Hitler's bunker in Berlin in 1945. Soviet troops, who were guarding the bunker, had granted Lunghi permission to enter. He kept one volume of Hitler's Brockhaus Enzyklop√§die from the bunker as a memento. Early life and education Lunghi was born at the British Legation in Tehran, Persia on 3 August 1920. His father, Phillip Lunghi, was an economic adviser at the legation. His mother, Helena, was an Anglo-Russian. The Lunghi family returned to the United Kingdom when Hugh Lunghi was ten months old. His mother taught him Russian. Lunghi attended Abingdon School, Abingdon-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, until 1939, where he was Head Boy and captained the 1st XV at rugby for a record three consecutive years.Abingdon News No 35, April 2014 Lunghi studied Greek and Latin at the University of Oxford. Biography Hugh Lunghi's first wife was Helen Kaplan; the couple had one daughter. In April 1950, he married his second wife, Ren√©e Banks, with whom he had three daughters. The Lunghi family moved to Fleet, Hampshire, in 1960. He became a longtime parishioner of St Phillip & St James, as well as All Saints, in Fleet. After the war, Lunghi worked as Second Secretary at the Moscow Embassy. He interpreted for Field Marshal Montgomery in 1948 at crisis meetings at the Kremlin during the Berlin Blockade. The following year, he was posted back to the Foreign Office in London, and managed to smuggle home under his seat on the train the Laika hound which he had rescued from fierce shepherd dogs in Georgia. His Russian fianc√©e, an opera singer, was not so fortunate. Although, as a favour by Stalin to Lunghi, she was given permission to leave the Soviet Union, she was then taken off the train bringing her to the West after first being poisoned by the KGB. Only many years later did Lunghi discover that she had subsequently been sent to Siberia. Lunghi had a daughter by his wartime marriage to Helen Kaplan, which was dissolved. In 1950 he married Ren√©e Banks. In 1954, he joined the BBC World Service. He became deputy head of current affairs commentaries and then head of the Central European department, which broadcast to Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. During the crushing of the Prague Spring by Warsaw Pact forces in 1968, he was the BBC's principal commentator for both radio and television audiences. He continued his campaign for freedom of expression as director from 1980 of the Writers‚Äô and Scholars‚Äô Educational Trust, and as editor of its journal, Index on Censorship. He was able to revisit Russia in the 1990s, later lectured on Soviet affairs to universities, and was an invaluable source of information and wartime reminiscence for historians Death Lunghi died on 14 March 2014 at the age of 93. His wife, Ren√©e, died in 1992. He was survived by his three daughters; the eldest, Xanthe, has been planning adviser to the NFU; Melissa has worked for many years for the NHS; and Diana is a retail fashion manager.

Elrington The Judges in ireland 1221-1921 He should not be confused with his much younger cousin Sir Thomas Cusack, Lord Chancellor of Ireland, who was a child of about six when the elder Thomas died. Elrington Ball states that he belonged to a junior branch of the well-known landowning Cusack family of County Meath. He was thus a cousin of John Cusack of Cussington: John was the father of the Lord Chancellor, Sir Thomas Cusack, and ancestor, through his granddaughter Catherine Colley (n√©e Catherine Cusack- Wellesley) Burke's Peerage of the Duke of Wellington. Thomas is first heard of in London in 1472, when he was a law student: he went to London, in his own words: \\"so as to thoroughly ground himself in the King's law\\", and he was given a licence to import grain into Ireland. He was appointed Attorney General for Ireland in 1480. Like nearly all the senior Irish judges in that era he was a client of Gerald FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Kildare, who was almost all-powerful in Ireland for more than 30 years. Kildare and his faction made the mistake of supporting Lambert Simnel, a pretender to the English Crown, who was decisively defeated at the Battle of Stoke Field in 1487. The victorious King Henry VII was merciful to the Irish rebels (as indeed he was to Simnel himself, who became a servant in the Royal household). He issued a royal pardon for the great majority of the rebels, including Cusacke, who became Lord Chief Justice in 1490. Henry's policy of clemency had its limits, and his strong suspicion that the Anglo-Irish nobility were aiding another pretender to the Throne, Perkin Warbeck, led to Kildare's temporary downfall in 1494. The new Lord Deputy of Ireland, Sir Edward Poynings, undertook a general purge of the Irish judges, including Cusacke who was replaced by the eminent English lawyer Thomas Bowring. From 1496 onwards Kildare regained much of his influence. Some of his former allies on the bench returned to office, but no more is heard of Cusacke, which suggests that he had died sometime between 1494 and 1496. References Sources *Ball, F.

He is also known as \\"Massenm√∂rder vom Falkenhagener See\\" (\\"Terror of Falkenhagen Lake\\"). Schumann murdered seven people and raped 11 women. He was 28 years old when he was executed in 1921.  Murders  Schumann was born in 1893 in Spandau, his father had a long criminal record and suffered from alcoholism and his grandfather had been convicted of pedophilia. He bought his first gun at a young age, practicing by shooting at the local wildlife. During his teenage years he killed his female cousin, claiming that the gun accidentally went off while he was playing with it, spending some time at a correctional institution as a result. After completing his locksmith apprenticeship he was conscripted into the German army. He fought during the First World War, where he was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd class for his excellent marksmanship. Following the end of the war he struggled to adjust to civilian life, embarking on his criminal career. Over the course of three years Schumann committed 7 murders, 15 attempted murders, 5 arsons, 11 rapes and a series of thefts and robberies. 18 August 1919 Schumann shot 52-year-old forester Wilhelm Nielbock from Spandau. On 20 August 1919 he was arrested in Berlin. The trial against Schumann started on 5 July 1920 in Berlin.  Trial and execution  Friedrich Schumann was convicted of murder, and on 13 July 1920 he was sentenced to seven death penalties, one life sentence, ten years hard labour and several other sentences in Berlin. He was therefore sentenced to death.Blazek, Matthias, Carl Gro√ümann und Friedrich Schumann - Zwei Serienm√∂rder in den zwanziger Jahren, Stuttgart 2009, p. 123. On August 27, 1921, at 6 o'clock in the morning, Schumann was executed in the courtyard of the Pl√∂tzensee Prison by Prussian executioner (Scharfrichter) Carl Gr√∂pler, using the axe. The Berlin lawyer Erich Frey later recalled his brief encounter with the executioner: \\"At the end of the corridor, I had to give way to a broad-shouldered man. He looked like a transport worker; the high-buttoned formal jacket looked strange on him. His closely-cropped skull rested upon a bull neck. In spite of the faint light, he looked suntanned and healthy. Never before had I seen executioner Gr√∂pler from Magdeburg. But as he passed me with a slight bow, I knew it was him. Anyone who had any business in the Criminal Court of Justice knew about Gr√∂pler. He had been a horse butcher previously.... each month he collected a small fixed salary, and had in return to be ready with his massive axe and his three skilled assistants at the demand of the State attorney. For every execution he received 300 Marks plus his expenses. Gr√∂pler went in to see his customers.... \\"You can go to him [Schumann] with no trouble,\\" I heard the guard say to Gr√∂pler in Berlin dialect, \\"he's got no nerves.\\"Frey, Erich, Ich beantrage Freispruch.

Early life and career  Kirk Reid was raised by his mother in Battersea, London, until the age of nine, and then spent time periodically in the care system. Reid has three brothers, some of whom are half-siblings; one of them was a Metropolitan Police constable at the time of Reid's arrest. Reid made his living as a chef, and at the time of his arrest, he was head chef at Camberwell College. Reid's avocation was football, and he refereed and coached amateur matches in the Wimbledon district league and Battersea Park, sometimes for teams of children and women. Reid's criminal notoriety and work with children prompted the Football Association (FA) to issue the statement that \\"The FA would like to make it very clear that Kirk Reid was not a qualified FA youth football coach and did not undertake a mandatory FA CRB check.\\" At the time of his arrest in 2008, Reid lived in Cavendish Road, Balham, with his partner of five years, and owned a second property nearby.  Criminal history  Police believe that Reid may have been responsible for more than 70 sexual assaults over a period of 23 years. Reid's pattern involved driving around South London districts‚Äîmost frequently Tooting and Balham, close to where he lived‚Äîlooking for women walking home alone. Waiting for them to be distracted or occupied, he would then attack them from behind. Reid's victims ranged in age from 28 to 61, and at least one woman was visibly pregnant. At Reid's trial in 2009, a woman testified that Reid had raped her near his own home in Battersea in 1984. The woman was 17 years old, and did not report the rape to police at the time. Reid has not been charged with her rape. Another woman accused Reid of raping her in Balham in 1995. She reported the rape after his arrest in 2008, and Reid admitted having sex with her, but claimed it was consensual. That same year, Reid was accused and acquitted of indecent assault after a woman claimed he attacked her in an alley. In 2002, police discovered links between 26 sexual assaults in the Wandsworth area of London dating back two years, and Reid was detained after a woman complained of being followed by him, but no further action was taken. In both 2004 and 2006, a car matching the description of Reid's red Volkswagen Golf was witnessed in connection with two separate sexual assaults, once via CCTV.  Arrest  In 2008, the serious crime unit of the Metropolitan Police took over the investigation into the series of assaults, and within hours they named Reid as a suspect. Reid was arrested five days after a DNA test positively linked him to several attacks. Once in custody, Reid's half-brother Roger, a police constable, visited his cell and asked him directly if he was guilty of the rapes. Reid replied, \\"I did it\\", a confession he later retracted. Reid's uninterrupted crime spree, like that of another prolific serial rapist, the black cab driver John Worboys, was largely blamed on the failure of the police to successfully investigate sexual assaults, and led to procedural changes in the London Metropolitan Police's handling of rape and sexual assault crimes. John Yates, an assistant police commissioner at the time, stated that \\"Nothing can adequately excuse the failure to follow up straightforward lines of inquiry that should have seen Reid arrested\\" in 2004‚Äîfour years before his actual arrest. Officials acknowledged that they had missed 12 chances to catch Reid. Conviction In March 2009, Reid was convicted at Kingston Crown Court of two rapes and 26 sexual assaults committed in southwest London from 1995‚Äì2007, for which he was sentenced to life imprisonment. The judge recommended that Reid serve at least seven-and-a-half years before being considered for release. In January 2018, more than a year after Reid's recommended non-parole period had elapsed, the Parole Board announced that his case had come up for review \\"following the standard six-month process for all indeterminate sentence prisoners\\". In September 2018, Reid's request for release was denied, and the board ruled that he could request release again in 2020.

The camps are designed to encourage children to 'Question, Understand, Explore, Search and Test' and often use a group of philosophical techniques called Philosophy for Children (P4C) to develop reasoning and creative thinking skills. History Camp Quest began in the United States as a non-religious humanist summer camp for children in 1996. It was conceived by a small committee of members of the Free Inquiry Group of Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky (FIG) with Helen and Edwin Kagin acting as directors for the first ten years. In 2000 Camp Quest expanded with independent camps operating throughout the United States with the same mission statement, eventually becoming Camp Quest Inc. in 2007 with Fred Edwords as its first president. After reading about Camp Quest in Richard Dawkins' The God Delusion, Samantha Stein became a volunteer for the organisation at a camp in Michigan and was prompted to start a similar camp in the UK. Camp Quest UK was started by Stein and a group of volunteers in 2008, supported by a grant from the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science, and hosted its first camp in 2009 in Somerset for children aged 8-17. Stein, who has a degree in Psychology and a Masters in Religion in Contemporary Society, initially fielded a considerable amount of press interest when the Sunday Times broadsheet newspaper ran a front page article on Camp Quest UK; the headline read 'Dawkins sets up kids‚Äô camp to groom atheists'. The Times later went on to include it in their Best kids camps in Britain and 10 best kids' adventure holidays. The name originates from the initials ‚ÄúQuestion, Understand, Explore, Search and Test‚Äù, reflecting the ethos of Camp Quest UK. Stein was keen to promote a more reason-based, inclusive camp for children from a mix of religions including children with no religion. At the time she set up Camp Quest UK, Christian Camping International estimated that \\"more than one million Britons attend faith vacations through their affiliates every year.\\" Camp Quest UK has been supported by several secular organisations including Humanists UK, Good Thinking Society, National Secular Society and Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science. As of 2018 Camp Quest Inc. operates thirteen affiliated camps in the USA and in addition to Camp Quest UK also operates in Switzerland and Norway. Camp activities At Camp Quest UK, participants discuss philosophical ideas, learn about subjects such as astronomy, and take part in traditional camp activities. The camp aims to promote co-operation, tolerance, and empathy, and teaches children how to think for themselves on matters such as religion and ethics. Children are taught and encouraged to use creative thinking and reasoning skills using a set of philosophical techniques known as Philosophy for Children (P4C). Children can explore concepts such as morality, honesty and justice. At Camp Quest UK children are also encourage to use scientific method and reasoning to problem solve, and activities can also involve investigating evolution, astronomy and paleontology. In recent years there are two camps running at different times and locations divided by the age of participants, junior camp for children aged 7-11, and senior camp for ages 11-17. A central theme is chosen for each year, past themes have included: Evolution (2009), The Mind (2010), What is Science (2011), Humanity and Language (2012), The Future (2013), Worlds within our World (2014), Artificial Intelligence (2015), Space (2017), Thought (2018) and Sustainable Futures (2019). In addition to reasoning and science based activities Camp Quest UK also hosts traditional camping and Outward Bound style activities such as campfires, learning to canoe, swimming, trekking and cooking. The 2017 camp also included outdoor sports such as \\"archery, zip wire, climbing, high ropes, rafting, the Great Wall, air rifle shooting, mountain biking, night line, abseiling and the assault course.\\" =Invisible unicorn challenge= During Camp Quest UK attendees are tasked with the invisible unicorn challenge, aimed at showing that a negative cannot be proven. The task is one of the ways used to encourage children to exercise critical thinking and explore ideas about the burden of proof and challenges the children to prove that invisible unicorns do not exist. The children are told that two invisible unicorns exist at Camp Quest UK and that there is a valuable book proving their existence which has been passed from generation to generation but no one is allowed to read. Any child who can prove they do not exist stands to win a ¬£10 note signed by Dawkins. The prize has not yet been claimed.

Dr. Bergantin received his academic education at EPM-UNIFESP (Brazil) and UAM (Spain): degree in biomedicine (2008), MSc (2010) and PhD (2014). His research involves cell signaling mediated by Ca2+ and cAMP, skeletal and smooth muscles, peripheral and central nervous systems. His research work solved the enigma of the paradoxical effects produced by L-type Ca2+ channel blockers (TOP 25 Hottest Articles - Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology - Cell Calcium - TOP 1 July to September 2013/ TOP 5 October to December 2013/ TOP 1 January to December 2013 full year/TOP 6 January to March 2014). Since 1975, several clinical and experimental studies have reported that acute and chronic administration of L-type voltage-activated Ca2+ channels (VACCs) blockers, such as nifedipine, produces reduction in arterial pressure associated with an increase of sympathetic activity. Despite this sympathetic hyperactivity has been initially attributed to adjust reflex of arterial pressure, the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in this apparent sympathomimetic effect of the L-type VACCs blockers remained unclear for decades. In 2013, Dr. Bergantin and collaborators discovered that this paradoxical increase in sympathetic activity produced by L-type VACCs blockers is due to interaction of the Ca2+/cAMP signaling pathways. Then, the pharmacological manipulation of the Ca2+/cAMP interaction produced by combination of the L-type VACCs blockers used in the antihypertensive therapy, and cAMP accumulating compounds used in the antidepressive therapy, could represent a potential cardiovascular risk for hypertensive patients due to increase in sympathetic activity. In contrast, this pharmacological manipulation could be a new therapeutic strategy for increasing neurotransmission in psychiatric disorders, and producing neuroprotection in the neurodegenerative diseases.

It is the fundamental law of Algeria. The constitution was amended in 2002, 2008 and 2016. History The Algerian constitution was amended in 1996 to address years of sectarian strife. This violence started in January 1991, when Muslim groups began violently protesting in response to the cancellation of the first ever multiparty election of Algeria by the military junta, where the Islamic Salvation Front was expected to come out victorious. The Algerian military declared a state of emergency and adopted a \\"transitional rule\\" for the next few years. While violence had been simmering from January 1991 to the summer of 1995, Islamist groups started more actively fighting with the Algerian military in response to multiparty elections announced in November 1995. This clash led to the opposition parties of Algeria boycotting the election and assuring the election of Liamine Zeroual, the incumbent. Seeking to address the political conflict in Algeria, newly-elected President Zeroual announced on 5 May 1996 that he would put in place a three-part plan to reform the Algerian Constitution and restore order to Algeria. These three parts were: generating nationwide interest and ideas through a conference in the summer of 1996, holding a referendum on the results of the conference at the end of 1996, and holding elections for the Algerian legislature in 1997. The referendum passed the new constitution on 28 November 1996, although opposition parties claimed a fraudulent election. While violence continued after the ratification of the new constitution, the Algerian economy improved and the World Bank loaned the Algerian government $656 million in 1997. The new constitution changed the form of the legislature to a bicameral system, banned political parties based on religion, gave more powers to the president, imposed presidential term limits of two terms lasting five years, and included Islam as the official religion of Algeria.  Amendments  The 1996 Constitution was revised in 2002 and 2008. In February 2016, the Parliament adopted a third constitutional revision which entered into force on March 6, 2016. On May 7, 2020, the preliminary draft revision of the Constitution is published. It provides for the replacement of the post of Prime Minister by that of head of government, responsible to the Assembly, which can overthrow it by a motion of censure, the possibility for the President of the Republic to appoint a vice-president, the replacement of the Constitutional Council by a Constitutional Court, the retention of the limit on the number of presidential mandates to two, consecutive or not, or the limitation of the mandate of deputy to one re-election..

Postel was also a member from the Third Order of Saint Francis and had served as a schoolteacher after the French Revolution where she oversaw the education of around 300 children. The Revolution saw her use her then-disbanded school to house fugitive priests despite the great risk that posed to her own life. Postel's beatification was celebrated in 1908 and Pope Pius XI later canonized her in mid-1925. Life Postel's tomb in St-Sauveur-le-Vicomte. Julie Fran√ßoise-Catherine Postel was born on 28 November 1756 in Barfleur to the fisherman Jean Postel and Th√©r√®se Levallois. Postel was the aunt to Placide Viel. The Benedictine nuns oversaw her education in Valognes after her initial schooling and it was during that time that she discerned a call to serve God in the religious life; she took a private vow to remain chaste as a step forward in this dream. Postel founded a school for girls in Barfleur in 1774 that became a center for underground religious activities during the French Revolution for those who were unwilling to support the new regime. This school had been shut down at the Revolution's beginning. Authorization was granted to her to keep the Blessed Sacrament in her house as the conflict continued and she carried it on her person at times to provide the Viaticum to those who were ill and at the verge of death. The Jacobins often suspected her but never made allegations and left her alone. The end of the Revolution saw Postel take up teaching and catechizing in Cherbourg where she taught around 300 children. Postel made her religious profession into the Third Order of Saint Francis in 1798 (while assuming her religious name) and founded the Sisters of the Christian Schools in Cherburg on 8 September 1807 which was met with little success until 1832 when she acquired a derelict convent in St-Sauveur-le-Vicomte to use as her headquarters which then prompted growth within the order. The Bishop of Coutances Claude-Louis Rousseau issued diocesan approval for her order and it went on to receive the papal decree of praise from Pope Pius IX on 29 April 1859; it received full papal approval much later in 1901. The order based itself on the Rule of the Franciscan Third Order though this later changed in 1837 to be based upon that of the De La Salle Brothers which also prompted a name change for the congregation. Postel died in 1846; her order continues its work in places such as Romania and Mozambique and in 2005 had 442 religious in 69 different locations worldwide. Canonization The cause for Postel's canonization began under Pope Leo XIII on 27 July 1897 at which stage Postel became titled as a Servant of God; Leo XIII later confirmed that Postel had lived a life of heroic virtue and named her as Venerable on 31 May 1903. Pope Pius X later signified on 22 January 1908 his approval to two investigated healings as miracles attributed to her and so beatified her on 17 May 1908. Pope Pius XI confirmed two additional miracles and canonized Postel on 24 May 1925.

Origin Bespoke is derived from the verb bespeak, meaning to \\"speak for something\\". The particular meaning of the verb form is first cited from 1583 and given in the Oxford English Dictionary: \\"to speak for, to arrange for, engage beforehand: to 'order' (goods).\\" The adjective \\"bespoken\\" means \\"ordered, commissioned, arranged for\\" and is first cited from 1607. According to Collins English Dictionary, the term was generally British English in 2008. American English tended to use the word custom instead, as in custom car or custom motorcycle. Nevertheless, bespoke has seen increased usage in American English during the 21st century. History The word bespoke is most known for its \\"centuries-old relationship\\" with tailor-made suits, but the Oxford English Dictionary also ties the word to shoemaking in the mid-1800s. Although it is now used as an adjective, it was originally used as the past participle of bespeak. According to a spokesperson for Collins English Dictionary, it later came to mean to discuss, and then to the adjective describing something that was discussed in advance, which is how it came to be associated with tailor-made apparel. The word was used as an adjective in A Narrative of the Life of Mrs Charlotte Charke, the 1755 autobiography of the actress Charlotte Charke, which refers to The Beaux' Stratagem as \\"a bespoke play\\". After that, the adjective was generally associated with men's tailor-made suits. Before about the 19th century, most clothing was made to measure, or bespoke, whether made by professional tailors or dressmakers, or as often, at home. The same applied to many other types of goods. With the advent of industrialised ready to wear clothing, bespoke became largely restricted to the top end of the market, and is now normally considerably more expensive, at least in developed countries. At some point after that, the word bespoke came to be applied to more than tailoring, although it is unclear exactly when. Mark-Evan Blackman of the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York told The Wall Street Journal in 2012 that the \\"bespoke proliferation may be tied to young Hollywood types becoming enamored with custom suits about a decade ago\\". The Wall Street Journal article said that \\"language purists\\" were not happy, while suit makers said the word had been \\"bastardized\\". Contemporary usage Fitting of a bespoke jacket In 1990, American writer William Safire, questioned in a The New York Times article what had become of \\"custom, a word fading from our fashion vocabulary in a blizzard of British usage\\". In a play on words, he wrote of the snob appeal of the word: \\"To be suitably trendy, bespeak to me of bespoke tailoring.\\" Gentlemen's Quarterly magazine wrote that the word was \\"gaining in popularity\\", meaning \\"the opposite of off-the-rack\\". In its contemporary usage, it implies exclusivity, and is used as an aid in marketing and branding. A 2014 India Today article described bespoke as an emerging branding trend that marketers would need to embrace. A 2001 google search of \\"bespoke and software\\" produced 50,000 hits, many not in the UK or the US. The New York Times quoted an Indian tech director as saying the \\"global communications boom\\" contributed to a \\"superset of English vocabulary\\"; another business writer explained that software companies in India were accustomed to adapting their language depending on the client, so that switching between bespoke software and custom software was the equivalent of switching between lift and elevator or queue and line. By 2008, the term was more often used to describe software, database and computer applications than suits, shirts or shoes. The BBC News Magazine wrote in 2008 that the word had increasingly been used to describe things other than websites, suits and shoes‚Äîlike cars and furniture. Some examples of usage of the word are: *bespoke medicine (a movement to better fit treatment to the individual patient), *bespoke portfolio (an investment tool), *bespoke shoes (shoes that are made to fit the customer's specifications), *bespoke software (software written to the specific requirement of a customer), and *bespoke tailoring (clothing made to the individual measurements of the customer). Deborah Tannen, a Georgetown University linguistics professor, told The New York Times that \\"Americans associate it with the British upper class\\", adding that the word for Americans tapped into \\"our individualism. We want everything made special for us. Even when it comes to salad bars.\\" As of 2012, there were 39 applications using the term bespoke at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, with half of those having been filed only in the previous 18 months. The Wall Street Journal said that the term had started to proliferate in corporations and among investors a few years before that. A writer in The Independent said that consumers no longer wanted to \\"keep up with the Joneses\\", but wanted to set themselves apart, saying that the bespoke drive was anti-tradition, and about a desire to be different rather than identify collectively with others. Newsweek described the word as \\"monstrously distorted, abused and otherwise mangled into near meaninglessness\\", saying that anything can now be labeled \\"bespoke\\". The same Newsweek writer used the word as a verb to describe ordering a custom-made pair of glasses (\\"bespeaking a pair of spectacles\\"). One French bespoke shirtmaker was said to offer 400 shades of white, to satisfy vendor-customer relationships and desire for custom-made items. The New York Times devoted an article to bespoke cocktails, which they described as \\"something devised on the spot to a customer's precise and sometimes peculiar specifications\\". In another article, The New York Times described bespoke perfumes' taking the \\"world of personalization to an entirely new level\\". A 2016 The New York Times article describes a satirical video about bespoke water and observed: > \\"The B word has become an increasingly common branding lure employed by > interior design companies, publishers, surgeons and pornographers. There are > bespoke wines, bespoke software, bespoke vacations, bespoke barber shops, > bespoke insurance plans, bespoke yoga, bespoke tattoos, even bespoke medical > implants.\\" UK tailoring controversy The UK Savile Row Bespoke Association has requirements for a garment to use the term bespoke, but those requirements are not followed by some manufacturers. In 2008, the British Advertising Standards Agency allowed a company, Sartoriani, to use the word bespoke to describe its suits, causing a controversy with the Savile Row tailors who used that term to describe custom, hand-made suits.

Lao literature refers to the written productions of Laotian peoples, its √©migr√©s, and to Lao-language works. In Laos today there are over forty-seven recognized ethnic groups, with the Lao Loum comprising the majority group. Lao (part of the Lao-Tai family) is officially recognized as the national language, but owing to the ethnic diversity of the country the literature of Laos can generally be grouped according to four ethnolinguistic families: Lao-Tai (Tai-Kadai); Mon-Khmer (Austroasiatic); Hmong-Mien (Miao- Yao), and Sino-Tibetan (primarily Tibeto-Burman). As an inland crossroads of Southeast Asia the political history of Laos has been complicated by frequent warfare and colonial conquests by European and regional rivals. As a result, Laos today has cultural influence from France, Thailand, China, Vietnam, Burma, and Cambodia.  Literature in Lao society  Novice monks practicing the art of making palm-leaf folios at Wat Manolom, Luang Prabang, Laos Traditionally literature is held high regard in Lao society. Lao literature spans a wide range of genres including religious, philosophy, prose, epic or lyric poetry, histories, traditional law and customs, folklore, astrology, rituals, grammar and lexicography, dramas, romances, comedies, and non- fiction. Lao thematic elements frequently combine the religious and philosophical with secular works and folklore. It is important to appreciate that for the Lao, to engage in study or writing was in essence to pursue a deeper philosophical or religious meaning. Equally important is that oral traditions continue to exist along with written literary forms, and there is difficult to distinguish the two as separate traditions they are essentially coexisting and complementary. Written texts, in particular classical or religious, frequently do not have individual authorship nor do they have a fixed form, they are subject to continual retelling, reinterpretation and elaboration. Most works of Lao literature have been handed down through continuous copying and have survived in the form of palm-leaf manuscripts, which were traditionally stored in wooden caskets and kept in the libraries of Buddhist monasteries. The act of copying a book or text held deep religious significance as a meritorious act. The emphasis in writing was to convey Theravada Buddhist thought, although syncretism with animist beliefs is also common, religious and philosophical teachings. Individual authorship is not important; works were simply attributed with a perceived religious origin raising its status in the eyes of the audience. Owing to the religious and societal importance of most literature, the written word is generally kept in high regard and stored according to specific cultural taboos (i.e. never on the ground, and must be stored in a way that demonstrates respect). =Scripts= 246x246px Traditionally texts were kept as palm leaf manuscripts (bailan), which were prepared from dried palm leaves which had been cut, incised, covered over with ink or charcoal and subsequently cleaned to reveal the written words. Texts were also recorded using folding books of locally produced paper from mulberry bark paper (saa), khoi paper, or from lacquered cotton although these materials were less durable, and thus tended to be used for non-religious purposes. Theravada Buddhist religious texts were generally written in Pali, or transcribed into Lao using Tham script. The Tham script shows a strong similarity to the Mon script used in inscriptions in the ancient Mon kingdom of Haripu√±jaya (present-day Lamphun Province of Northern Thailand), dating from the 13th century. Versions of the Tham script continue to be used to this day by the Lao, Northern Thai, Tai Lue and Tai Khuen. comprising present-day Laos, the Upper North and Northeast of Thailand, the Northeast of Myanmar, and the Southwest of Yunnan Province in China. In Laos, the Tham script was generally reserved for religious writings, whereas texts which were considered secular were written in Lao Buhan, the precursor of the modern Lao script. Less common script variants include Tai Dam, and Khom (Ancient Khmer) scripts. Khom script was mainly used for Buddhist texts, works on language, medicine, cosmology, astrology and numerology, protective and astrological formulas (mantra and yantra) in Pali or Sanskrit, based upon the belief that it was a sacred script and special knowledge was required to produce and to use these manuscripts. In the early periods, knowledge of Khom script was originally exclusively attributed to court Brahmin from Angkor. Khmer Brahmin priests were recruited by Lao kings for the purpose of carrying out certain ritual functions at the royal courts. =Historical Overview= Luang Prabang, Wat Xieng Thong, an ornate Ho or library is in the background. The Lao trace their linguistic, cultural, and political history to the Kingdom of Lan Xang (1353-1707). Lan Xang had a highly literate society because of the importance of religion and religious education in Lao society. A temple (wat) typically existed in every Lao village and certainly in every town (muang). The Lao sangha had a moral and religious authority on par with the monarchy. All Lao males were expected to spend several years in religious education as a novice or to continue on as a Buddhist monk. Monastic education was the typical route to gain literacy and also some degree of social mobility in traditional society. Royal and religious records were stored in Ho or specifically designed libraries on temple grounds. From 1707-1713 the Kingdom of Lan Xang had split into the kingdoms of Vientiane, Luang Prabang, and Champassak. By the end of the eighteenth century the Lao kingdoms, had become vassal states to Siam. The cultural impact of Siam was greatest in the Isan region of northeast Thailand, an area which was predominantly Lao in terms of history and ethnicity. By the end of the nineteenth century the French had forced Siam to cede the areas on the east bank of the Mekong River, and had roughly established the borders of modern Laos. Colonialism during these periods had a lasting impact on Lao society and literature. The traditional model of monastic education was slowly replaced by a secular one which was dominated by Siamese or French culture. The earlier forms of Lao literature were preserved only in the monasteries, and folk culture and tradition remained one of the few remaining links between the Lao and their ethnic heritage. The twentieth century was period of immense upheaval and conflict, but also a gradual renewal of Lao literature. Both French and Thai nationalist policies aggressively sought to assimilate the Lao during the 1920s-1940s. World War II and the Franco-Thai War had a profound impact on everyday life for the Lao, which gave way to independence movements and the emergence of communism. Politics split Lao society and Lao literature, while the Royal Lao Government struggled to establish itself from 1954-1975. Independence and secular education helped to create a nationalist identity for the Lao, and interest in traditional Lao history and culture slowly reemerged. Revolutionaries in Laos and Vietnam during the early 1950s began to spread communist ideology, which culminated in the Vietnam War era and the ousting of the Lao monarchy in 1975. During this period Laos became the most heavily bombed country in world history. Politics continued to dominate literature in the 1980s, with the communist Pathet Lao struggling to assert their control over Laos. Today Laos has a reawakening interest in literature, as people struggle with national identity, rapid technological and social changes, development and a lagging economy, while maintaining a strong popular interest in the folk culture which has been part of their cultural heritage for millennia.  Classical literature  The Lao period of classical literature began during the Lan Xang era, and flourished during the early sixteenth century. The primary cultural influence on Lan Xang during this period was the closely related Tai Yuan Kingdom of Lanna. By the second resurgence of Lao classical literature in the seventeenth century, the Lao had developed a sophisticated tradition of art, literature and scholarship. Subjects were primarily religious or historical in nature, but also included epic poems, law, customs, astrology, numerology, as well as traditional medicine and healing. Many of the works during this period have been lost due to wars in the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth century. = The epic poem of Sin Xay = The epic of Sin Xay was composed by the Lao poet Pangkham during the reign of King Sourigna Vongsa and is regarded as the seminal work of Lao epic poetry. The central message is one that unchecked desires will inevitably lead to suffering. A mural of San Sin Xay epic from Wat Chaisi in Isan, Thailand. The plot follows the exploits of a king and his family, whose sister was kidnapped by a flying multi-headed nyak (mythological giant) during his youth. The king is so distraught he renounces the throne, and becomes a wandering monk to find his sister. As a wandering monk the king makes his way to a city where he sees seven daughters of wealthy merchant and falls in love. He returns to the kingdom and ceases being a monk to wed all seven of the girls. Six of the queens bear six sons. Through divine intervention the first queen gives birth to an elephant with giant golden tusks, and the youngest gives birth to twins- a golden snail, and boy born clutching a bow, who they name Sin Xay. The king feared the omen of the births, and consulted the court astrologer, who secretly plotted with other six queens, and suggested that the snail, elephant, and boy together with the two queens who bore them be exiled. The Lord of Heaven (Phaya Thaen) at this point in the epic saves the divine children and the queens by constructing a castle in the sky for them to live. The astrologer is made to raise the remaining six princes, who are neither very smart nor very diligent. When the princes come of age the king sends them out to find his sister who had long ago been kidnapped. Through the princes aimless wanderings they come to find Sin Xay- whom they trick into thinking will be welcomed back by the king if he joins them in their quest. The group endures many adventures, finally coming to the City of the Nyak among the clouds, where they find the king's sister. They fight a terrible battle where Sin Xay slays the flying multi-headed nyak. Having achieved their quest, group sets out to return but stops to cleanse themselves and make offerings to the Lord of Heaven. The six brothers, not wanting to lose face in the eyes of their father push Sin Xay, the golden-tusked elephant and snail off a cliff and tell the king's sister that they had tragically drowned. The king‚Äôs sister did not believe the princes, but waited to tell the king directly. On seeing his long lost sister and hearing from her that the princes had killed their brothers, the king becomes enraged and banishes them all, the astrologer, and his six remaining queens. Sin Xay, who did not die in the fall, but was saved by his elephant and snail brothers, returns to see his father. The king is overjoyed to see his faithful son, and crowns him king. Hmong girls at the Plain of Jars, Xieng Khouang Province, Laos = The epic poem of Thao Hung Thao Cheuang = The Thao Hung Thao Cheuang epic is regarded by literary critics and historians as one of the most important indigenous epic poems in Southeast Asia and a Lao language literary masterpiece for artistic, historical, and cultural reasons. Both the single extant copy of the text and the oral history originated in Xieng Khouang in Laos, among the Khmu peoples, which were indigenous to Laos prior to the Tai migrations. The oral tradition of the folktale recalls the struggle between the Khmu and indigenous peoples of Laos and the Tai-Lao. During the fifteenth century, under the Lan Xang era, the story was written and adapted by royal scribes so that the version recalled the struggle of the Lao against the Dai Viet during the 10th and 12th centuries. The plot follows the exploits of a conquering hero Thao Hung, who even in death goes on to lead a ghost army in the afterlife. One scene of the epic describes the creation of the Plain of Jars as part of a massive victory feast. The composition resulted in three patterns of Lao verses in 20,000 lines, making it one of the longest Lao epics. Despite the changes, major thematic elements and wording remained consistent, so the epic is one of the only descriptions of life in Southeast Asia among indigenous peoples during the Tai migrations. Both the written form and oral traditions are uniquely Lao and show the complex relationship between the major ethnic groups of the Lao Loum, Lao Theung and Lao Sung. The historical and cultural value continues in the description of the way of life among Lao peoples prior to the introduction of Theravada Buddhism. = Phra Lak Phra Lam ‚Äì the Lao version of the Ramayana = The Phra Lak Phra Lam is the official national epic of Laos and retells the Lao version of the Ramayana. Phra Lak Phra Lam is named after two principal characters, the brothers Phra Lak, or Lakshaman, and Phra Lam, or Rama. The emphasis of the story is on selflessness and brotherly love in the Lao version, making it traditionally classified among the Jataka tales although the story also had great significance in the royal court as a dance- drama. During the festivals of Pii Mai (Lao New Year) scenes from the work would be recreated, read aloud, or used in religious sermons. The Lao version is set along the Mekong River and includes Lao characters such as the king of the nƒÅga, and scenes which involve buffalo sacrifice which is associated with the satsana phi (animist religions) in Laos. The story is part shows the influence of India in Lao culture, and more broadly throughout Southeast Asia. Variations of the Ramayana story are common in Southeast Asia, and can be found as the Reamker in Cambodia or the Ramakien in Thailand. Luang Prabang, Wat Xieng Thong, Gilded bas relief figures from the Phra Lak Phra Lam = The Rocket Festival Epics = The tale of the Toad King (Phya Khankhaak) and the nithan or love poem Phadaeng Nang Ai are extremely popular literary works and are read or sung as part of the Rocket Festival (Boun Bang Fai; ) celebrations each year. The festival has roots as a fertility celebration, and is held at the beginnings of the monsoon season each year. The epic of the Toad King, tells the story of a prince born to a king in the form of a golden toad. The king cares for the prince, but the prince wishes for a wife as he grows older. The toad prince prays to the Lord of Heaven (Phaya Thaen), who grants the prince everything he wishes for and allows him to shed his toad-like appearance to become a handsome prince. The prince finds a beautiful wife and his father happily allows his son to become king. The Toad King and his wife are so beloved that everyone and everything under heaven comes to pay him homage, and forget to honor the Lord of Heaven. The Lord of Heaven is so humiliated he forbids the nƒÅga to make rain, which causes drought, terrible fires and suffering on Earth. After seven years of suffering the people, and creatures of Earth and even the divine creatures of heaven cannot take anymore trouble, and come to the Toad King for help. The Toad King builds a bridge to heaven and fights a terrible battle with the Lord of Heaven. The Toad King wins, and teaches the Lord of Heaven the value of humility. As a result, each year the Lord of Heaven sends down rains, but just in case he forgets the people hold festivals and shoot rockets into the air to bring the rains and remind the Lord of Heaven of his promise. The Phadaeng Nang Ai poem is a love story that takes place across multiple reincarnations. The title heroine Nang Aikham was born to a powerful Khmer king, her beauty was so great it was renowned even among the nƒÅga. King Phadaeng,in a neighboring kingdom came to see her and seek her hand in marriage. The two fell quickly in love. The Khmer King ordered a rocket festival (Boun Bang Fai), where the winner would be the one to shoot their rocket the highest. As a reward they would win his daughter‚Äôs hand in marriage. King Phadaeng built a rocket but it exploded on the launcher, he left humiliated, and the Khmer King sent the contestants away without promising his daughter to anyone. When the nƒÅga came to bring the rain after the rocket festival, the nƒÅga prince Phangkhi fell madly in love with Nang Aikham. Prince Phangkhi had been Nang Aikham‚Äôs soul mate in past lives. Prince Phangkhi transformed himself into a white squirrel to slip past her father‚Äôs guards and visit Nang Aikham. Prince Phangkhi was shot by a poisoned arrow, while transformed as a squirrel and with his dying breath laid a curse on his meat. The meat from his dead body multiplied and was served to the entire Khmer court. The court was all poisoned except Nang Aikham. King Phadaeng charged in to rescue her on a white horse. The nƒÅga king, seeking revenge on the Khmer for killing his son sent a massive nƒÅga army to destroy the Khmer. The nƒÅga king pursued King Phadaeng and Nang Aikham in a chase that went on for days. Eventually he caught up when Nang Aikham stopped to drink water from a stream, where the nƒÅga king was able to drag through the water to the NƒÅga City. King Phadaeng looked for her till the day he died. In death, he became a ghost king and made constant war with the nƒÅga. Finally the Lord of Heaven (Phaya Thaen) had to separate Nang Aikham from her two lovers; there they wait between rebirths for the second coming of the Buddha, who will make the final judgment of who she should be with for eternity.  Historical legends and chronicles  History was related using san (poetry) which was intended to be sung or performed, and phongsavadan (chronicles) which were meant to be read aloud during festivals and important occasions. Luang Prabang, Lao New Year, Spirit masks of Pu Nyoe and Ya Nyoe. = Origin legends = The Lao frequently wrote origin legends (nithan a-thi bay hed) for the people, places, and cultural relics which were part of their society. The Nithan Khun Borom (Story of Khun Borom) is one of the most important origin legends and describes the origin of the peoples in Laos and the surrounding regions from a common gourd. The Nithan Khun Lo expands where the Khun Borom story ends to describe the relationship between the early Lao and the Lord of Heaven (Phaya Thaen) and how the first kings were sent among men to rule the surrounding regions. Within the tale, mankind was threatened with destruction by giant creeping ivy, and was saved only through the sacrifice of a common elderly couple who volunteered to destroy the ivy and was crushed to death in the process. The story is recalled during the annual Pii Mai (New Year) celebrations by red-faced masked figures representing the spirits of the couple (Pu Nyoe and Ya Nyoe). Other origin legends describe the founding of major cities in Lan Xang, such as Vientiane, Luang Prabang, Xieng Khouang, and Sikhottabong. Important religious sites such as Phu Si in Luang Prabang and Wat Phu in Champassak were also recorded. Major statues of the Buddha, which included the Phra Kaew (Emerald Buddha), Phra Bang (namesake of Luang Prabang), Phra Sae Kham, and Phra Luk (Champassak) all had written accounts for their creation or discovery and transfer to Lan Xang. The Buddha images were symbols of royal and religious authority, and their stories combined folklore with animist traditions to become powerful palladiums of the monarchy and kingdoms of Lan Xang and Laos. = Chronicles = The royal court chronicles (phongsavadan) and more general historical accounts (phuen sueb) of Laos come in many versions, yet few of these primary sources have survived due to wars throughout the history of Laos and the earlier Kingdom of Lan Xang. Each of the major cities (muang) Vientiane, Luang Prabang, Xiengkhouang, Champassak maintained various versions of the court chronicles of Lan Xang. During the eighteenth century when these muang became the kingdoms of Vientiane, Luang Prabang and Champassak, and the Principality of Xieng Khouang, the chronicles became more regional in nature. In 1779 under King Taksin the Great and again following the rebellion of King Anouvong in 1828, the Lan Xang capital city of Vientiane was razed and many of the most important royal chronicles were destroyed or carried to Bangkok along with the Phra Kaew(Emerald Buddha) and other cultural treasures. The population in and around Vientiane was relocated to the west bank of the Mekong in the area of the Khorat Plateau. The Isan region, although historically within the Lan Xang mandala, was more accessible for the growing power of a nationalist Siam where the population could be taxed or brought into the corvee system of labor. The Lao kingdoms maintained their monarchy and sangha but became vassal states within Siam. The French establishment of Laos in 1893 as part of Indochina would create a political division with the Isan region, although the majority population was historically and ethnically Lao. Today the Isan region remains part of Thailand, and has developed a distinctly different historical identity which has been the result Thai policies which began during the 1930s and sought to assimilate these people within the dominate culture of the central Thai. During the Vietnam War, and the period of the Khmer Rouge, the influx of Lao and Khmer refugees to the Isan region revived cross cultural communications. The importance of this history to Lao literature and culture is that Thailand is now home to an estimated 30 million Lao speakers, while Laos has an approximate total population of 6 million. Lao Naga outside the Haw Phra Kaew, Vientiane. = Leup Pha Sun and other secret histories = The dominance of Siam during the nineteenth century left the Lao unable to remain politically independent, and the infighting among the kingdoms of Vientiane, Luang Prabang and Champassak was bitterly resented among the common people. In 1828, King Anouvong of Vientiane, together with his son the king of Champassak rebelled against Siam in what became known as the Anouvong Rebellion (1828). The end results of the rebellion were disastrous for the Lao, and resulted in the total destruction of Vientiane and more forced population transfers to the Isan. The willingness to challenge Siamese hegemony created the first stirrings of Lao nationalism, and presented a folk hero identity to the Lao who would not compromise to outside pressures. In one of the most enigmatic and controversial Lao epics, the Leup Pha Sun expresses the author's sadness that he cannot speak freely of his country while he tries to cope with tumultuous relationship between Lan Xang and Siam using both romantic and religious language and imagery. The unnamed author In the end prays for a divine intervention to end the widespread suffering. Similarly, the Pheun Raxavong and Pheun Viang are first hand Lao histories of the Anouvong Rebellion. Other histories were put into the classical form of epic poetry including the Kab Phagna Siengsa, which retold the history of King Anouvong from the perspective of his top commanders. These secret histories and poetry circulated among the ethnic Lao in Isan and in Laos, keeping the cultural memory of the rebellion in the popular memory. In 2010 a statue of King Anouvong was erected in Laos, a tangible symbol that the cultural memories of the rebellion still carried symbolic importance in the modern era.  Religious literature  Monks at evening prayer Wat Xieng Thong, Luang Prabang Religion and religious teaching is a recurring theme for much of Lao literature throughout its history. Laos is predominantly Theravada Buddhist, which was the state religion in the Kingdom of Lan Xang since the time of King Photisarath in the 1520s. King Fa Ngum the founder of Lan Xang brought Theravada monks and the Phra Bang (palladium of Laos) with him when he established Lan Xang in 1353, according to folk traditions. The principle religious texts of Theravada Buddhism are known as the Tipitaka (Three Baskets) which include: # Vinaya Pitaka (\\"Discipline Basket\\"), dealing with rules for monks and nuns # Sutta Pitaka (Sutra/Sayings Basket), discourses, mostly ascribed to the Buddha and disciples # Abhidhamma Pitaka, variously described as philosophy, psychology, metaphysics, etc. The texts, collectively known as the Pali Canon, are written in Pali and were a traditional merit making gift among the kings and sanghas of Southeast Asia. The earliest record of a complete copy of the Tipitaka in Laos was such a gift from the Kingdom of Lanna to King Vixun in the 16th century. Monastic education has been central to Lao society from the Lan Xang period to the modern day. The oldest monastic school in Laos was founded by King Vixun in 1503. Throughout the areas of what are today southeast Myanmar, the Xipsongpanna in China, north and northeast Thailand, northwest Vietnam, and Laos it was common for monks, texts and even complete libraries to move between monasteries. Kingship in Laos, and Southeast Asia generally, was reinforced and legitimized by sponsorship of the sangha and acts of religious merit. In return, the most prolific teachers with royal sponsorship attracted wealthy patrons, artists, and pilgrims. As a result of itinerant monks, Buddhist texts in Laos vary greatly between monasteries, with an emphasis for those texts used most frequently in daily community life, rather than complete or formal copies of the Pali Canon. Generally, the most popular texts include blessings used in ritual ceremonies (animasa); blessings used for protection (paritta); instructions used for lay or religious ceremonies (xalong); non-canonical stories from the life of the Buddha (jataka); commentary on Tipitaka (atthakatha); ritual rules or instructions for monks and nuns (kammavaca and vinaya pitaka); local epics and legends (e.g. Xieng Mieng, Sin Xay, and Thao Hung Thao Cheuang); summary treatises on Theravadist doctrine (Visuddhimagga and Mangaladipani); grammar handbooks (excerpts from the Padar≈´pasiddhi and KaccƒÅyanavyƒÅkarana); and relic, image and temple histories (tamnan).Luang Prabang, Wat Mai, Scenes from the Prince Vessantara Jataka. = Jataka tale of Prince Vessantara = Jataka tales are morality stories which recall previous incarnations of the Buddha before he was able to reach enlightenment. The stories are used to exemplify a particular virtue or teach a specific lesson, in which the character representing the Buddha may be either human or animal. In Theravada Buddhism, the Jatakas are a textual division of the Pali Canon, included in the Khuddaka Nikaya of the Sutta Pitaka. The term Jataka may also refer to a traditional commentary on this book. Jataka tales are common throughout Southeast Asia and there can often be found with many regional variations. Laos has developed a number of Jataka tales which are uniquely Lao in their tradition. The Lao written version of the Vessantara Jataka is generally considered one of the greatest masterpieces of Lao literature. The story recalls the past life of a compassionate prince, Vessantara, who gives away everything he owns, including his children, thereby displaying the virtue of perfect charity. The story is incorporated into Lao celebrations of the festival Boun Phra Vet (Festival of Prince Vessantara) where the story is read aloud and is usually accompanied with dance, drama and mor lam (Lao folk singing).  Folklore  Folklore is among the most diverse, and expressive form of literature in Laos. The category can apply to almost any narrative form of expression, and includes many myths, customs, popular beliefs, riddles, jokes, and common depictions of everyday life. Most Lao folklore is pre-classical and mostly comes from oral traditions. Lao folk singing or mor lam is one of the most popular and widely used methods to preserve folk heritage. Another widely used method is in the various motifs found in weaving. All ethnic groups in Laos practice weaving at some level and it forms an important method of story telling and identity through folk art. Lao Mor Lam folk singing. = Spirit stories = Animism is the most widely practiced spiritual practice in Laos behind Theravada Buddhism. Collectively known as Satsana Phi the religion preserves pre- Buddhist, indigenous, and tribal spiritual practices. Although there is no central hierarchy or authority, the practices do form a cultural link between the Lao Loum, Lao Theung and Lao Sung throughout history. Phi, or spirits, are believed to inhabit buildings, territories, natural places and things, and phenomena. Phi commonly includes ancestral spirits and protection spirits, which are popular in shamanism and traditional medicine. Oral and written traditions also include entertaining stories of malevolent ghosts, such as Grandmother Vom (Phi Ya Vom), who eats the living that wander into the jungle, or the ghosts of spurned lovers (Phi Khon Long). The spirit stories are varied and extremely popular. The Lao ceremony known as baci is one of the most popular folk traditions and beliefs which stem from animist traditions, and are performed at key moments in Lao life to strengthen the soul and its believed thirty-two components (kwan). = Naga stories = Folk traditions include the protector spirits of the Mekong River, the nƒÅga which take a serpentine form and are popular motifs in Lao art, weaving and folklore. The nƒÅga are along with phi the oldest written and oral subjects in Lao folklore. The nƒÅga stories show a mixing of indigenous Lao beliefs and Khmer influence. The indigenous and pre-Buddhist Lao took their folklore and combined it with the serpents found in the Hindu pantheon which was familiar through interaction with the Khmer. The nƒÅga would again be ‚Äútamed‚Äù by the influence of Buddhism, and became popular spirit guardians depicted among Lao temples (wats). The cities of Vientiane and Luang Prabang were first ruled by nƒÅga in Lao tradition, and the Mekong River itself was first called Nam Nyai Ngu Luang or \\"Great River of the Giant Serpent,\\" for the belief that the river and surrounding terrain were gouged by the movement of a great nƒÅga lord over the Earth. Nyak folk masks, Lao New Year = Trickster tales of Xieng Mieng = Xiang Miang tales are among some of the most recent and widely known folk literature in Laos. The stories emerged as clever and irreverent political satire during the wars of the eighteenth and nineteenth century when both the Lao kings and sangha were politically at their weakest, and yet direct criticism would have broken cultural taboos or religious authority (saksit). The stories involve the protagonist Xiang Miang, who is portrayed as a boy and novice monk, and his efforts to outwit the king or abbot in both humorous and morally instructive ways. = Indigenous and tribal stories = Oral traditions among the ethnic minority groups of Laos are a rich source of folklore which developed along parallel lines to the written literature of the majority Lao Loum. Stories from the Mon-Khmer, Blang, Lamet, Khmu, Akha, Tibeto-Burmese, Tai-Rau, and Hmong-Mien create unique myths, legends, laws, customs, beliefs and identities which have been passed down largely through oral tradition. Anthropological studies of these societies, and first hand retelling from the members of these groups have become an increasing part of modern literature about Laos, and are a source of increasing ethnographic study. Each group maintains unique aspects of their storytelling culture. For instance, the Hmong, a division of the Mien who immigrated to Laos in the nineteenth century from China, are famous for their \\"story cloths\\". These cloths, ranging in size up to several square feet, use figures to represent stories from Hmong history and folklore in a narrative form.  Modern literature  Modern Lao literature is inseparable from the political history of the country. Modern literary forms began in Laos began to emerge during the French Colonial period in Laos (1893-1954). French cultural influence was strongest among the Lao nobility and upper classes who were sent to French language parochial schools in Laos, would subsequently pursue high school at the lycee in Vietnam, and in rare occasions were sent on to higher education in France. Studies into traditional Lao literary forms were made by a small group of French intellectuals representing the French cultural institute the √âcole Fran√ßaise d'Extr√™me-Orient. The goals of these initial studies were threefold. The first goal, was a genuine intellectual and rational discourse to better understand the Lao, from an anthropological and historical perspective. The second, being more intentionally political, was to preserve Lao cultural identity and fashion it into a more nationalist one as a means to counterbalance Thai cultural influence. Lastly, there was also a political aim to present colonialism to the French public as a \\"positive\\" for Lao society in general. The net impact to the culture was one which was positively pro- French. The first modern Lao novel, The Sacred Buddha Image (Phra Phoutthahoup Saksit) by Somchine Nginn, was published in 1944 and was composed entirely in Lao, with an introduction in French. The fictional account follows a French- Lao detective in his efforts to recover a stolen sacred Buddha image. In the same period, French colonial influence took a decidedly more nationalistic tone to counterbalance Thai regional hegemony. In the Isan region, the fascist policies of Field Marshal Phibun, sought to forcibly assimilate the ethnic minorities of Thailand into the Central Thai identity. Lao language, dress, and cultural expression in the Isan region were made illegal. The ultimate goal was an attempt to absorb the territories of Laos (as well as the Malay in the South, and the remaining traditions of the Tai Yuan, of Lanna) into a reunified Thailand, within the borders of the former Siam. In promoting a Lao identity, the French had indirectly created the Lao independence movement under the Lao Issara. When Paris fell to the Axis powers in 1940, the momentary weakness of the Vichy Government, forced France to permit the Empire of Japan to establish a military presence in Indochina. Seizing on this opportunity and perceived weakness, Thailand attacked French outposts in the Franco-Thai War (1940-1941) where Thailand was able to seize areas of Laos and Cambodia. The Empire of Japan mediated the conflict, which forced Vichy France to cede Lao territories and areas of Cambodia. In 1945 facing when the Empire of Japan was on the defensive, control of Laos was handed over to the Lao Issara. In 1946 following the end of World War II, Thailand returned the territories to France in exchange for recognition in the newly established United Nations. France reasserted control of Laos, and the Lao Issara fled to Thailand. Lao nationalism having been firmly established during the 1930s-1940s, political movements for independence took shape after World War II. Politics and internal struggle would come to dominate Lao life and literature for the second half of the twentieth century. Literature took on a polarity between pro-French views which distrusted the influence of Vietnam and Thailand, the Issara which sought their own government but were deeply divided between pro-Thai and pro-Vietnamese factions, and communist revolutionaries among the Pathet Lao which were supported from Vietnam. = Post-Second World War = In 1946 the French established Laos as a constitutional monarchy within the French Union, in an attempt to reconcile with the nationalists. Academic study took a step forward in the early 1950s with the creation of the Comite Litteraire, the forerunner of the Lao Royal Academy, and brought together both French and Lao historians and academics for serious study with an aim of popular publication. By 1953 the Franco‚ÄìLao Treaty of Amity and Association, gave control of Laos to the Royal Lao Government, with the exception of the military. However the rifts between the political factions were deep and split along both ideological and personal lines among the Lao royal family, and would later give rise to the Laotian Civil War. Literature produced during the war, from the early 1950s to the communist Pathet Lao victory in 1975, can be divided into two distinct groups: literature created in the regions of the country controlled by the Royal Lao Government and literature from the \\"liberated zones\\" governed by the communist Lao Patriotic Front (Pathet Lao). Further complicating the conflict was the internationalization of the Laotian Civil War, with the United States supporting the Royal Lao Government, the Vietnamese supporting the Lao Patriotic Front, and the Thai government which was concerned with its own internal security and relationship with the United States, but very cautiously seeking to preserve its own regional interests. From 1975 to the present Lao literature has begun to reemerge after decades of wars and conflict. Some literature remains overtly political, Laos being one of the few remaining communist states is caught in a balancing act between China, Thailand and Vietnam, and all three have a history of mutual distrust stronger than cooperation. Yet, the economic power of China and its increasing nationalistic image remain a model for Muang Lao's communist regime. Statues of former Lan Xang kings were erected beginning in 2004, with the founder King Fa Ngum. At the same time, expatriate Lao are reflecting on the period of upheaval which began in the 1940s and came to crisis during the Vietnam War era, creating a Lao literary tradition from outside the country. The younger post-war generation of Lao is influenced by Thai culture and Western pop influence, creating a modern mix of genres and topics. All of these groups and transitions are creating a broad spectrum of uniquely Lao literary voices, which are reemerging with a frequency that had long been dormant since the classical era of Lan Xang.  Preservation efforts  Reading aloud is one way that Big Brother Mouse, a literacy project in Laos, gets children excited about reading. The history of conflicts in Laos over the centuries shaped much of Lao literature, and determines what primary sources have continued to survive. Yet, renewed scholarship has led to important discoveries of classical literature in the twentieth century. The first serious efforts to interpret and preserve Lao literature began in the twentieth century. Modern efforts to translate and preserve Lao literature began with French scholars working with the √âcole Fran√ßaise d'Extr√™me-Orient, a French colonial institute dedicated to cultural studies within Indochina. Academics like George Coedes, Henri Parmentier, and Louis Finot working in the late 1910s and 1920s produced the first in depth cultural materials on Laos since the explorations of Auguste Pavie in the 1870s. From 1928-1940 Prince Phetsarath promoted the Chanthabouly Buddhist Institute for the promotion and preservation of Lao cultural heritage. During the 1940s and 1950s preeminent Lao scholars began to emerge. Nhoui Abhay, and Maha Sila Viravong working through the Comite Litteraire, produced the first popular publications of classical Lao literature. Maha Sila Viravong did extensive work on the early classics identifying the major masterpieces of Lao storytelling and producing one of the first popular histories of Lan Xang. Maha Viravong is also credited with the rediscovery of one of the only primary copies of the Thao Hung Thao Cheuang which he uncovered in 1943, having been kept in storage at the National Library in Bangkok for a century. In 1956, the National Library of Laos (Lao language: ‡∫´‡ªç‡∫™‡∫∞‡ªù‡∫∏‡∫î‡ªÅ‡∫´‡ªà‡∫á‡∫ä‡∫≤‡∫î) was established in Vientiane. In 1988 the first serious attempt to catalogue and digitize Lao primary sources began. The Toyota Foundation in conjunction with the Lao Ministry of Information and Culture began an initiative to catalogue over 300,000 phuk (palm-leaf books) in over 800 monasteries. From 1992-2004 the Preservation of Lao Manuscripts Programme began as a joint German and Lao venture. Starting in October 2007, the National Library has collaborated with the University of Passau and the Berlin State Library (Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin Preu√üischer Kulturbesitz) to create the Digital Library of Lao Manuscripts. The government granted permission for the manuscript collection to be made accessible via the Internet. The project digitally copied and stored Lao palm leaf manuscripts, with over 86,000 texts being preserved and 12,000 texts microfilmed in a central database. The results of these efforts are over 7,500 old and unique titles, representing a massive amount of literary wealth despite the destruction and wars of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The effort to translate, preserve and promote these primary sources is ongoing and will protect the literary heritage of Laos for future generations.

Establishment of Montagu Montagu was founded on the farm \\"Uitvlugt\\" in 1851, and is known for its hot mineral springs and scenic mountains. Montagu is a town in the Western Cape province of South Africa, about 180 km from Cape Town in the western Klein Karoo. It is named after former secretary of the Cape Colony 1843-1853, John Montagu, but was once known as Agter Cogman‚Äôs Kloof, Cogman‚Äôs Kloof linking the town of Montagu with the railway station in Ashton which is known for the Langeberg Canning Factory.. He was a very able administrator and a man with vision who realized that the colony would not make significant progress without proper means of communication. Shortly after his appointment as colonial secretary he therefore initiated a road-building programme which left mark on the landscape, the economy and the social life of the colony. John Montagu was born in 1797- probably in India- where his father served in the British army. At the age of 17 he joined the army himself and served in the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. His military career blossomed and he married Jessy Worsely in 1823. Thereafter his career took a new turn when he entered the service of the colonial government of Van Diemensland (Tasmania). After serving two more years in the military (1829‚Äì31) he returned to Tasmania, occupying the post of colonial secretary from 1834 to 1842. In this senior post he gained valuable experience showing a gift for efficient administration. However after a clash with the lieutenant-governor he left Tasmania in 1842. Later in 1842 a report on his clash with the lieutenant governor exonerated him from any misconduct and he was offered the post of colonial secretary of the cape colony. He arrived at the Cape in April 1843. It is situated at the confluence of the Keisie and Kingna rivers.Heydenrych, H. 2005. 30 Stories of Montagu and its people. The Museum and its theme The main aim of the Montagu Museum is to research and portray the cultural-historical heritage of Montagu and its people. The Museum owns a collection of oil paintings and drawings by the famous South-African artist Francios Krige who lived and worked in Montagu. Included in the collection is one of his major works ‚Äò‚ÄôBegrafnis in die Karoo‚Äô‚Äô (Burial in the Karoo) which he bequeathed to the Museum. The Museum has its own oval date stamp which is an exact replica of the postmark which was first used in Montagu in 1858. The distinctive design to post offices in the Cape from 1853 onwards, were based on Liverpudlian, and American date stamps. All letters and postcards mailed at the Museum are stamped with this unique date stamp. The T.O Honiball collection of cartoons and books is an important acquisition. This famous South-African cartoonist whose worked appeared in the Die Burger for many years, became a household name for his satirical and humorous depiction of animal characters which still captivate old and young alike. Take a look at the Brink Brothers exhibition at the Museum. Between 1902 and 1985 the Brink Bros enterprises was of mayor economic significance to the town. They were general dealers who owned a hotel, a department store, a winery which produced an extensive range of exotic liqueurs and fortified wines; a canning factory which exported canned fruit and they also produced dried fruit for the export market. The archive which houses all documents, photographs and Africana relating to the history of Montagu, is becoming an increasingly important research centre. The devastation caused by the flood of 25 January 1981 has been fully documented by the museum. The Museum has been researching traditional herbal remedies since 1982 and these are for sale at the museum or can be ordered by post. Montagu Museum comprises the following historical buildings in Long Street =Joubert House= It is situated in no 25 Long Street. A proclaimed national monument which was built in 1853 and is the oldest house in the town. After the devastating flood of January 1981 it was saved from demolition and restored to its former glory by the Board of Trustees. Today it functions as a House Museum that portrays the lifestyle of the rural Victorian era. At the back of Joubert House there is an Indigenous Medicinal Plant Garden. =Montagu Museum Art Gallery= In 2007 the new art gallery was established in a part of the KWV Building Cnr Kohler and Long Street. It is the most interesting and noteworthy example of commercial architecture in Montagu from the early 1930s. The art gallery was opened with an exciting exhibition of sculptures and works by Willie Bester, internationally recognized artist and born Montaguer.

Those runners that had to run the full distance, the most highly rated, were running from 'scratch'. A huge amount of betting surrounded all the professional races and they were often shrouded in allegations of fraud to ensure a winner favourable to the bookmakers. The race later moved from Powderhall to the Meadowbank Stadium in Edinburgh and then onto Musselburgh Racecourse.https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/dec/22/powderhall- sprint-professional-running \\"Days of bookies, fast bucks and foot soldiers at the Powderhall Sprint\\", Harry Pearson, The Guardian, 22 December 2011.\\"'Powderhall Sprint' finds new home at Musselburgh\\", Doug Gillon, HeraldScotland, 30 December 1999.

Famous Competitors  The New Year Sprint in its various incarnations has attracted many of the world's top sprinters.

The district lies to the west of the Jaffrey's main business district, extending along Main Street (New Hampshire Route 124) from Harkness Road to the Jaffrey Common, and along Thorndike Pond Road northward from Main Street. It includes the town's oldest civic buildings, and was its main center until the mills of East Jaffrey eclipsed it. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Description and history The district retains the feel of an 18th-19th century rural village, and includes elements dating to shortly after the town's incorporation in 1773. The old burying ground was established in 1774, and the old meeting house (now a cultural center) was raised in 1775. The district includes 19th century school houses, and houses that were built in the 18th and 19th centuries, in predominantly Georgian, Federal, and Greek Revival styles. One of the town's early industries is also represented, in the remnants of a tannery established c. 1810 at the east end of the district. The area's importance as an economic as well as civic center arose after completion of the Third New Hampshire Turnpike (now NH 124). The turnpike brought travelers, who stopped at inns and taverns in the center, and goods, which were sold to local farmers. Melville Academy, a secondary school, was founded in 1832, and its 1833 building is now a local museum. The area remained of some significance even as East Jaffrey's mills became more prominent, as it catered in the late 19th century to vacationers drawn to nearby Mount Monadnock.

Shenzhen lobbied hard in the early 2000s to be included in the Hong Kong‚ÄìZhuhai‚ÄìMacau Bridge project through a proposed double-Y-shaped design with one of the extensions connecting Shenzhen to the structure, but the Government of China picked a single-Y-shaped design in 2004, leaving Shenzhen out of the project. The idea of a separate link to connect Shenzhen with Zhongshan was originally proposed in 2008, but was shelved for several years amid concerns it could jeopardize the success of a bridge between Hong Kong, Zhuhai and Macau.

At the PlayStation Experience 2014 in December, DrinkBox Studios announced that Severed would be released on PlayStation Vita, continuing the trend of DrinkBox' previous games of releasing on PlayStation platforms first. After being delayed, DrinkBox Studios announced on April 11, 2016, that Severed would be released for PlayStation Vita on April 26. On June 13, 2016, during the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2016, Severed was announced for both the Wii U and Nintendo 3DS. The game supports cross-buy, so if a user buys it on the Wii U, they also get the game free on the 3DS. The Nintendo Switch version released on August 8, 2017.  Music  The soundtrack for Severed was created as a collaboration between the Juno and Polaris-nominated band Yamantaka // Sonic Titan and Pantayo, and was created with the support of FACTOR and the Canadian Government. Severed's soundtrack took home an award for Best Musical Score from the Canadian Videogame Awards  Reception  The game received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. It was named Apple's 2016 iPad Game of the Year.

It consists of a connected series of primarily brick buildings flanking the Contoocook River just north of Main Street. Its oldest buildings, the original mill and office building, are on the west side of the river. They were built in 1868, and feature mansard roofs and banded dentil brick cornices. The mill building has a tower that originally sported a cupola, but this was removed early in the 20th century. In 1872 the building on the east side was built, and the two sides joined by timber-frame bridges were added in 1897, at the same time the east building was extended northward. Later additions to the north of the east building include a storage area and a loading dock. The mill complex, the only 19th- century industrial complex of its type to be built in Jaffrey, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. It has been converted into residences. The oldest buildings in the complex were built by Alonzo Bascom, the local postmaster. He sold them, unused due to his ill health, in 1871 to Stone Brothers and Curtis. They built the east side mills, and began the manufacture of woven cotten fabric, also using the water power to support a grist mill and various woodworking operations. Their business was short-lived due to the post-Civil War economic downturn, and they closed in 1876. The White Brothers of Winchendon, Massachusetts next took over the property, again using for textile manufacture until 1939, when it closed due to the Great Depression. Before it was converted to housing, it saw a number of varied light industrial uses in the mid-20th century.

The author is David J. Cord, an American expatriate living in Finland. Summary The book covers the history of the company Nokia from 2006 to 2013, during the upheaval in the mobile device industry caused by newcomers Apple, Google and low-cost competitors. To a lesser extent it also covers Nokia Solutions and Networks, then a joint venture called Nokia Siemens Networks, during the same period. The main focus of the book is Nokia's decline in the mobile device industry, which culminated in the sale of the handset division to Microsoft. According to the book major reasons for Nokia's decline include a pervasive bureaucracy leading to an inability to act, destructive internal competition and the failure to realize the importance of lifestyle products like the iPhone. Other factors include the company's weakness in North America and the botched attempt to move out of hardware into services with Ovi (Nokia). The book refutes the idea that Nokia was unable to innovate, saying that incompetent middle management hampered attempts to bring innovations to market. Cord spreads the blame for Nokia's fall onto former CEO Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, and the company's faulty organisational structure. According to the book, the reason Nokia declined to switch to Android was because Samsung was much stronger and executives were afraid to compete against them in that ecosystem. The author discusses a theory that skewed decision making during the tenure as CEO of Stephen Elop was due to his conscious desire to do deals specially favorable to his former employer of Microsoft; Cord admits that Elop‚Äôs actions appear suspicious, but maintains that they were all logical at the time in the eyes of subordinate Nokia executives who agreed with the decisions Development After the completion of the author‚Äôs first book in 2012, Mohamed 2.0: Disruption Manifesto, his Finnish publisher asked him to write a book about Nokia. Cord initially declined, because he was working on a novel and thought the time wasn‚Äôt right to write about the company. When his novel was completed he began work on The Decline and Fall of Nokia. Reception The book generated considerable attention from the press as it claims Sun Microsystems' co- founder Scott McNealy had been offered the job of Nokia CEO in 2010 but declined. The board of directors next looked to promote long-time Nokia executive Anssi Vanjoki, but were stymied by major American investors, including Morgan Stanley, who demanded an outsider be chosen. The board‚Äôs third choice, according to the book, was Stephen Elop of Microsoft. Scott McNealy issued a statement, doubting that he was the \\"dream candidate\\" to succeed Kallasvuo and that he was never offered the job. The process of choosing the CEO in 2010 had previously been wrapped in secrecy, so there was much speculation about Cord‚Äôs sources of information. One publication wondered if long-time chairman of the board Jorma Ollila had been the leak.

Smith taught at Tufts University (1970‚Äì71), The University of Michigan at Flint (1971‚Äì72), The University of Pittsburgh (1972‚Äì73), The University of Michigan at Ann Arbor (1973-80), The University of Illinois at Chicago Circle (1980‚Äì83), The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (Visiting Associate Professor, 1981‚Äì82), and The University of Arizona (1983-2001). From 2001 she has served as Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at Rutgers University-New Brunswick. Her husband Alvin I. Goldman is Board of Governors Professor of Philosophy and Cognitive Science at Rutgers.\\"Goldman, Alvin\\", biography at Rutgers School of Arts and Sciences; Alvin I. Goldman page at Rutgers.

Heller Collegiate Professor, School of Art & Design\\", Stamps School of Art and Design, University of Michigan; Sherri smith webpage.  Research  Smith's philosophical work falls into four main areas: biomedical ethics (with an emphasis on reproductive ethics); consequentialism (the theory that the moral status of our acts depends on their consequences alone); moral responsibility; and normative ethics concerns that transcend particular normative theories. = Reproductive ethics = Smith defended a liberal perspective, arguing that the fetus has no natural right to the use of its mother's body during pregnancy,\\"Whose Body Is It, Anyway?\\" in James Thomberlin, ed., Philosophical Perspectives, Vol. 6 (Atascadero, California: Ridgeview Publishing Company, 1992), 73-96. and that it has no right to ‚Äúrescue‚Äù by the mother.\\"Fetal-Maternal Conflicts,\\" in In Harm's Way: Essays in Honor of Joel Feinberg, edited by Allen Buchanan and Jules Coleman (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994), 324-343; and \\"Intercourse and Moral Responsibility for the Fetus,\\" in Abortion and the Status of the Fetus, Vol. XIII of the series, \\"Philosophy of Medicine,\\" eds William B. Bondeson, H. Tristram Englehardt, Stuart Spicker, and Daniel H. Winship (Dordrecht, Holland/Boston, Massachusetts: D. Reidel, 1983), 229-245. = Consequentialism = Smith focused on forms of rule utilitarianism, arguing, contra David Lyons,David Lyons, Forms and Limits of Utilitarianism (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1965). that act utilitarianism and full compliance forms of rule utilitarianism do not always prescribe the same actions, and maintaining that the project of finding an appropriate definition for ‚Äúconsequences‚Äù within rule utilitarianism had been misconceived and was doomed to failure.\\"David Lyons on Utilitarian Generalization\\", Philosophical Studies, Vol. 26 (October 1974), 77-94 (as Holly S. Goldman); and ‚ÄúMeasuring the Consequences of Rules‚Äù, Utilitas, Vol. 22, No. 4, December 2010, 413‚Äì433. = Moral responsibility = Smith explored how to assess an agent's degree of credit or blameworthiness for an action when the agent acts from a mixture of good and bad motives.\\"Varieties of Moral Worth and Moral Credit\\", in Ethics, Vol. 101 (January 1991), 279-303. She worked on the question of whether an agent is blameworthy for a wrongful act done in culpable ignorance.\\"Culpable Ignorance\\", The Philosophical Review, Vol. XCII (October 1983), pp. 543-571; ‚ÄúNon-Tracing Cases of Culpable Ignorance‚Äù, Criminal Law and Philosophy, Vol. 5, Issue 2 (2011), 115-146; and ‚ÄúThe Subjective Moral Duty to Inform Oneself before Acting,‚Äù forthcoming in Ethics. Her most noted paper is ‚ÄúCulpable Ignorance,‚Äù which was named by The Philosopher‚Äôs Annual as one of the ten best articles in 1983.The Philosopher's Annual, Vol. VI, from the literature of 1983. It analysed in detail the terms of the debate between those who argue that a person is blameworthy for an action performed in culpable ignorance, versus those who hold that while a person is blameworthy for the initial dereliction of failing to acquire information, that does not taint a subsequent action, done in culpable ignorance, that is itself done from acceptable motives. Smith concluded that the only defense for the position‚Äîa controversial one in law and philosophyDaniel Statman, Moral Luck (Albany, New York: State University of New York Press, 1993).‚Äîis one that holds people blameworthy for the unlucky consequences of their actions. Later she explored the implications of cognitive and social psychology for questions about moral responsibility, arguing that agents should not be held responsible for emotional reactions and behavior that issue from cognitive processes involving automatic (Kahneman/Tversky's System 1) responses to environmental stimuli.‚ÄúNon-Tracing Cases of Culpable Ignorance‚Äù, Criminal Law and Philosophy, Vol. 5, Issue 2 (2011), 115-146; ‚ÄúDual-Process Theory and Moral Responsibility,‚Äù forthcoming in Michael McKenna, Angela Smith, and Randolph Clarke (eds), The Nature of Moral Responsibility (Oxford University Press).  Actualism  Much of Smith's work focused on questions about right and wrong that are common to many distinct ethical theories, including both consequentialist theories and deontological ones (the moral status of an act depends on features of an act other than its consequences, such as whether or not it involves telling a lie or breaking a promise). Her paper ‚ÄúDated Rightness and Moral Imperfection‚Äù\\"Dated Rightness and Moral Imperfection\\", The Philosophical Review, Vol. LXXXV (October, 1976), 449-487 (as Holly S. Goldman). helped launch a debate now known as the debate between Actualism and Possibilism by arguing for the first time in favor of Actualism.Holly S. Goldman, \\"Dated Rightness and Moral Imperfection\\", The Philosophical Review, Vol. LXXXV (October 1976), n. 16, p. 246. Possibilists believe that whether or not the agent ought to perform an immediate action depends on whether performing it would enable the ideal course of action in the future. Actualists believe that whether or not an agent ought to perform the action depends on what performing that action would actually lead her to do in the future. The issue is illustrated by an example from Smith/Goldman's later paper ‚ÄúDoing the Best One Can‚Äù.\\"Doing the Best One Can,\\" in Values and Morals, eds Alvin Goldman and Jaegwon Kim (Dordrecht: Reidel, 1978), 186-214. Published under the name Holly S. Goldman. A graduate student asks faculty member S for comments on a paper he plans to present at a job interview. If S agrees and comments on the paper, the student will improve the paper substantially, have a highly successful interview, and receive an offer for a three-year job. If S accepts the task but fails to comment on the paper in time, the student will make no revisions, have a dismal interview, and receive no job offer. If S declines to provide comments, the student will elicit comments from a less expert faculty member, make less helpful revisions on the paper, have a moderately successful interview, and receive a one-year job offer. Clearly S's accepting the task would enable her to follow the ideal course of action, namely reading and commenting on the paper in a timely way, resulting in the student's receiving a three-year job. However, in reality if S accepted the task, she would actually fail to comment on the paper in time, either because she would misunderstand the deadline, or because she of her time-consuming administrative chores. In this case the student would receive no job offer. Possibilism recommends that S agree to comment, that would support her intent to follow the best course of action. Actualism takes a more realistic stance: it recommends that S decline since that would lead to a better outcome. Smith argues this case requires the same reasoning as a prudential decision, such as deciding to drive carefully to avoid a crash. = Information = Smith also considered the question of how to use moral theories in actual decision-making, especially given agent's lack of enough information about the world to ascertain accurately which action their favored moral theory implies. Thus the intent to avoid adultery may be thwarted by not knowing that a partner is actually married. And someone trying to follow W. D. Ross‚Äôs prima facie duty to keep promises may fail should she forget the promise. Smith repeatedly explored these ‚Äúepistemic‚Äù problems\\"Making Moral Decisions\\", Nous, Vol. XXII, No.1 (March 1988), 89-108; \\"Two-Tier Moral Codes\\", Social Philosophy & Policy, Vol. 7 (Autumn 1989), 112-132; \\"Deciding How To Decide: Is There a Regress Problem?\\" in Michael Bacharach and Susan Hurley (eds), Essays in the Foundations of Decision Theory, Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1991, 194-219; ‚ÄúSubjective Rightness‚Äù, in Social Philosophy and Policy 27 (Summer 2010), 64-110; ‚ÄúThe Prospective View of Obligation‚Äù, Journal of Ethics and Social Philosophy, February 2011; ‚ÄúNon-Tracing Cases of Culpable Ignorance‚Äù, Criminal Law and Philosophy, Vol. 5, Issue 2 (2011), 115-146; ‚ÄúUsing Moral Principles to Guide Decisions‚Äù, Philosophical Issues, Vol. 22, Action Theory (2012), 369-86; ‚ÄúThe Moral Clout of Reasonable Beliefs,‚Äù in Mark Timmons (ed.), Oxford Studies in Normative Ethics, Vol. I (Oxford University Press, 2011), pp. 1‚Äì25; ‚ÄúThe Subjective Moral Duty to Inform Oneself before Acting‚Äù, forthcoming in Ethics. and argued that the solution depends on recognizing that moral theories must be supplemented by a hierarchy of decision rules that prescribe acts as ‚Äúsubjectively right‚Äù to agents who are uncertain what the moral theory itself recommends. Smith was awarded a National Humanities Center Fellowship during 2013-14 to complete a book manuscript on this cluster of epistemic challenges to using morality to make decisions.  Recognition  Smith's article \\"Culpable Ignorance\\" was selected by The Philosopher's Annual as one of the ten best articles to appear in print in 1983.

Background  He Ning was born in 898, during the reign of Emperor Zhaozong of Tang. His family was from Xuchang (È†àÊòå, in modern Tai'an, Shandong). He claimed ninth-generation ancestry from He Fengyao (), an imperial censor during the reign of Emperor Gaozong of Tang, early during Tang. However, his male-line ancestors were not in prominent governmental services after that, including his great-grandfather He Chang (), grandfather He Ru (), and father He Ju (). He Ju was said to be a drinker who lacked adherence to social protocols, and was not learned, but was said to respect scholars such that he spent his wealth in receiving and aiding them. (This suggested that He Ju was a man of some wealth.) He Ning himself was said to be intelligent and dextrous in his youth, and also had a handsome appearance. He was also studious, and it was said that he read books quickly and could understand their basics even when reading quickly.  During Later Liang  When He Ning was 16 (914) ‚Äî by which time Tang had fallen, and He Ning's home territory was under the rule of Tang's successor state Later Liang ‚Äî he was set to submit to the imperial examinations in the Mingjing class. When he went to the capital Daliang to do so, however, he dreamed of a man who gave him a number of five-colored pens, and stating to him, \\"You, son, have such great talent; why do you not submit yourself for the Jinshi class?\\" (Jinshi was a more prestigious class of imperial examinations than Mingjing.) It was said that after that dream, He became even more impressive academically, and in 916, at age 18, he passed the imperial examinations in the Jinshi class. After He passed the imperial examinations, then-military governor (Jiedushi) of Xuanyi Circuit (ÂÆ£Áæ©, headquartered in modern Anyang, Henan), He Gui (Ë≥ÄÁìå ‚Äî note different surname despite their identical rendition), who had heard of him by reputation, invited him to serve on staff. While serving on staff, He Ning also became known for his capability in archery. As of late 918, He Gui was the supreme commander of the Later Liang troops against Later Liang's archrival to the north, Jin. Around new year 919, Jin's prince Li Cunxu, wanting to carry out a decisive attack to destroy Later Liang, crossed the Yellow River and tried to head for Daliang. He Gui tried to intercept him, and the armies engaged at Huliu Slope (ËÉ°Êü≥ÈôÇ, in modern Heze, Shandong). Both armies suffered tremendous losses during the battle.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 270. At one point during the battle, He Gui's army had suffered a crushing defeat, and no one was left to follow him other than He Ning. He Gui, believing doom to be coming, stated to He Ning, \\"Son, do not follow me. You should strive for yourself.\\" He Ning wept and responded, \\"It is not my aspiration to be a man who was trusted by another but who then abandons him in disaster. I only would regret not dying in the right place.\\" When a Jin cavalry soldier subsequently did try to chase He Gui down, He Ning first tried to scare him off but when the soldier persisted, He Ning fired an arrow and killed him. When they returned to headquarters the next day, He Gui told his sons, \\"Yesterday, but for Lord He, I would not be here. Lord He is capable in both civilian and military matters, and also has great ambition. He will surely be in an important position in the future. You should serve him carefully.\\" He Gui thereafter gave He Ning a daughter in marriage, leading to He Ning's reputation becoming known. He later served three terms as secretary to military governors.  During Later Tang  During the subsequent Tiancheng era (926-930), during the reign of Li Siyuan (Li Cunxu's adoptive brother) as emperor of Later Tang (as Li Cunxu's Jin state had been transformed into Later Tang, and then destroyed Later Liang), He Ning was recalled to the imperial government, then at Luoyang, to serve as an imperial censor with the title of Dianzhong Shi Yushi (), and then served successively as Yuanwailang () at the ministries of rites (Á¶ÆÈÉ®, Libu) and justice (ÂàëÈÉ®, Xingbu). He later served as Zhuke Yuanwailang () at the ministry of rites but was also simultaneous put in charge of drafting edicts. Not long after, he was promoted to be an imperial scholar (Áø∞ÊûóÂ≠∏Â£´, Hanlin Xueshi) as well as the higher supervisory position of Zhuke Langzhong () at the ministry of rites. He was also put in charge of the imperial examinations. It had become custom at the office of the imperial examinations that on the day the results were announced, the doors would be tightly closed and protected by fences, to prevent rowdy examinees from charging the door. However, with He Ning in charge, he ordered that the fences be removed and the doors be opened; despite that, because the examinees were respectful of him, no disturbance occurred. It was said that he was discerning and selected a number of examinees who were capable. As a result, Li Siyuan respected him more. He was subsequently promoted to be Zhongshu Sheren (‰∏≠Êõ∏Ëàç‰∫∫, a mid-level official at the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng)), and then deputy minister of public works (Â∑•ÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Gongbu Shilang), while continuing to serve as imperial scholar.  During Later Jin  = During Shi Jingtang's reign = In 936, Li Siyuan's son-in-law Shi Jingtang, then the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), rose in rebellion against then-emperor, Li Siyuan's adoptive son Li Congke, and, with aid from Later Tang's northern rival Khitan Empire, defeated Later Tang armies that Li Congke sent against him. Li Congke committed suicide, ending Later Tang, while Khitan's Emperor Taizong declared Shi the emperor of a new Later Jin state, which then took over the former Later Tang lands.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 280. He Ning initially continued to serve Shi as imperial scholar, and was in 937 given the greater title of imperial scholar at Duanming Hall (). After his promotion, he initially posted a notice on his door that he would no longer receive any guests (apparently to avoid people's making requests to him). A former low level official, Zhang Yi (), however, wrote him and pointed out that, in serving as the emperor's eyes and ears, if he cut himself off from the public, he would not be able to observe what was occurring in the public properly. He Ning was impressed, and recommended Zhang to the chancellor Sang Weihan.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 281. In addition to being imperial scholar at Duanming Hall, he was also put in charge of the imperial treasury. Not long after, when the Duanming Hall positions were abolished, he was made chief imperial scholar (Áø∞ÊûóÂ≠∏Â£´ÊâøÊó®, Hanlin Xueshi Chengzhi). It was said that Shi often consulted him on key decisions and found his advice helpful. In 940, He Ning was made Zhongshu Shilang (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰æçÈÉé, deputy head of the legislative bureau) and chancellor, with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (). In late 941, when Shi was preparing to depart then-capital Kaifeng to head to Yedu (ÈÑ¥ÈÉΩ, in modern Handan, Hebei) in anticipation of a rebellion by An Chongrong the military governor of nearby Chengde Circuit (ÊàêÂæ∑, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei) so that he could react quickly, He Ning pointed out to him that after he left Kaifeng, another rebellious military governor, An Congjin of Shannan East Circuit (Â±±ÂçóÊù±ÈÅì, headquartered in modern Xiangyang, Hubei), would surely rebel as well, and that Shi should prepare for it. Shi asked him was his advice was. He advised Shi that Shi should leave a number of blank edicts with Shi's adoptive son (biological nephew) Shi Chonggui the Prince of Zheng, whom Shi left in charge of Kaifeng, so that when An Congjin did rebel, Shi Chonggui could react quickly and commission appropriate generals to counterattack. Shi Jingtang agreed. Subsequently, when An Congjin did rebel, Shi Chonggui was quickly able to mobilize a number of generals to command the imperial army against him, with Gao Xingzhou in overall command. An Congjin was quickly defeated and forced to return to Shannan East's capital Xiang Prefecture () to defend it,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 282. and later committed suicide when the city fell.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 283. = During Shi Chonggui's reign = Shi Jingtang died in later 942. He was succeeded by Shi Chonggui. He Ning continued to serve as chancellor, and received the additional title of You Pushe (Âè≥ÂÉïÂ∞Ñ, one of the heads of the executive bureau (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng). In fall 945, He Ning was removed from his chancellor position and served only as You Pushe from this point on; he was replaced in the chancellorship by Feng Yu, the brother of Shi Chonggui's wife Empress Feng, who was already serving as a chief of staff.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 285. He was shortly after given the slightly higher title of Zuo Pushe (). Contrary to Shi Jingtang's submissive posture toward Khitan (whose state's name had been changed to Liao by this point), Shi Chonggui took a confrontational stance against Liao, resulting in military confrontations between the two states. In late 946, Emperor Taizong made a major attack south, and, after forcing the surrender of the major Later Jin general Du Wei (Shi Jingtang's brother-in-law, Shi Chonggui's uncle), approached Kaifeng. Shi Chonggui, believing defeat to be inevitable, surrendered, ending Later Jin. Emperor Taizong entered Kaifeng.  During the Liao occupation  Emperor Taizong claimed to be the emperor of China as well, and he took over the imperial administration structure left over from Later Jin, the territory of which largely submitted to him as emperor at that point. He commissioned He Ning as chancellor again with the titles of Zhongshu Shilang and Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi, serving along with Zhang Li, a formerly Later Tang imperial scholar whom he had captured during Later Tang's fall and who then served him after that point. However, the subsequent misrule by Emperor Taizong over the former Later Jin territory caused many rebellions to break out through the realm, and he decided to withdraw back Liao proper. He took many of the ethnically Han Chinese officials with him, including He Ning, leaving his brother-in-law Xiao Han in charge of Kaifeng as the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered at Kaifeng). However, Emperor Taizong fell ill on the way and would not reach Liao proper alive, dying near Heng Prefecture (ÊÅÜÂ∑û, Chengde's capital).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 286. In the aftermaths of Emperor Taizong's death, the Liao general Zhao Yanshou (also a son-in-law of Li Siyuan's, who was also captured by Emperor Taizong when Later Tang fell), to whom Emperor Taizong had previously promised the Chinese throne but then reneged on the promise, tried to take over Heng and claim the title of regent over the southern court (i.e., the former Later Jin domain). The ethnically Khitan Liao generals, however, had already resolved to support Emperor Taizong's nephew Yel√º Ruan the Prince of Yongkang, and they quickly tricked Zhao and arrested him. Yel√º Ruan then took the throne (as Emperor Shizong) at Heng.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 287. Believing that his grandmother (Emperor Taizong's mother) Empress Dowager Shul√º would not agree to his ascension (as she favored his uncle (Emperor Taizong's younger brother) Yel√º Lihu), Emperor Shizong headed north to contend with her. Most of the ethnically Han officials accompanying Emperor Taizong were left at Heng, and he left Emperor Taizong's cousin Yel√º Mada () in charge of Heng. Subsequently, Emperor Shizong sent an edict to Heng, ordering He Ning and a number of other Han officials, including fellow chancellors Feng Dao and Li Song, to rendezvous with him for Emperor Taizong's burial. However, at that time, a rebellion by the Han soldiers against Yel√º Mada, led by the officers Bai Zairong () and Li Rong, broke out at Heng. Initially, Yel√º Mada's Khitan soldiers had the upper hand in street battles, but a turning point came when the official Li Gu, asked He Ning, Feng, and Li Song to visit the battle scene to encourage the Han soldiers. When the soldiers saw the three senior chancellors, they were encouraged, and they fought harder, eventually expelling the Khitan soldiers out of the city. Subsequently, the soldiers supported Bai to be the acting military governor of Chengde, so that he could submit to Later Han and seek aid. Meanwhile, Bai, who was greedy, wanted to kill Li Song and He Ning to seize their wealth. Li Gu rebuked him, pointing out that if he did so, the new Later Han emperor would surely have him punished, so Bai did not do so. Bai subsequently submitted the region to the sovereignty of Liu Zhiyuan, a former Later Jin military governor of Hedong who had declared himself emperor of Later Han.  During Later Han  He Ning, along with Feng Dao and Li Song, shortly after returned to Kaifeng. Liu Zhiyuan gave him the honorary title of Taizi Taibao (). Sometime later, He Ning was also created the Duke of Lu.New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 56.  During Later Zhou  After Later Han was later displaced by Later Zhou, He Ning was given the honorary title of Taizi Taifu (). He died in 955 after suffering an ulcer on his back. He was given posthumous honors.  Personality and literary/musical works  He Ning was said to be meticulous in details. Ever since he began to serve as a junior official, to the time that he served as a chancellor, he made sure that his wagons and clothes were all properly decorated such that they impressed the onlookers. He was also intent on helping junior officials, such that he dealt humbly with those in lower positions no matter how able or not they were. He wrote all his life, and was particularly good at writing short, exotic songs. He created a 100-volume collection of his works, and he personally wrote them out for the purpose of creating printing woodblocks. He printed several hundred copies and distributed them.

The family escaped to England and lived in Richmond, Surrey. Her older brother, Andrew, was an historian specialising in Byzantium. He moved to Israel with his wife, Eva, a painter, and his mother they emigrated to Israel. Andrew became professor of history at Bar Ilan University. Education and career She was educated at City of London School for Girls, and graduated from Cambridge University with a degree in English and Russian. During the war she worked in Bletchley Park. She then worked for the Ministry of Education and was Head of English at Kettering Girls High School. One of her students wrote after her death \\"Miss Marina Sharf was our English teacher and sometime form mistress at Kettering High School. Hundreds of young women are indebted to her for the inspiring quality of her teaching, especially of Shakespeare, which was one of her great joys.\\" Isobel Watson She took the name Thekla after St. Thekla, a disciple and companion of the Apostle Paul in 1st century. She is given the title \\"Equal- to-the-Apostles\\" because she accompanied St. Paul in founding churches because her witness converted so many others to Christ, and she was the first woman martyr for the Christian Faith. Monastic life Mother Thekla first come in contact with Mother Maria (Lydia Gysi) on the Feast of the Assumption in 1965, at which time Mother Maria was living as an Orthodox nun with the Anglican Community of St. Mary's Abbey at West Malling in Kent. With the help of the Abbey, a house was found for Mother Maria and Sister Thekla at Filgrave, where they settled as 'Spiritual Mother and disciple, living a life of near silence, with day and (often) night being given over 'to the work of the heart and of the mind'. They were then joined by Sister Katharine. Shortly before the Monastery moved from the Filgrave to the North York Moors, Sister Thekla (as she was then) wrote about how the Orthodox Monastic Vocation had been put into practice in Buckinghamshire. The Sisterhood consisted of \\"three women, all British by nationality: one born Swiss, one born Russian, and one born English; all three nuns in the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople!\\" Referring to the monastic tradition, Mother Thekla wrote: \\"I can only tell what I was taught in the stillness of those years\\". She is referring to her early years with Mother Maria. \\"I was taught the meaning and work of repentance, that is, the growing into the attitude ‚Äì in spite of every lapse until death ‚Äì which recognises the failure within oneself, not even as much in the sin committed, as in the very being. I was trained even ruthlessly in the recognition of the sin of double ignorance; and I was taught the joy, which nothing can shake, of the acknowledgement of the limitation of human reasoning; and, hence, the glad freedom of the mind which can work to the uttermost of its own limits without fear of trespassing into the Divine.\\" However, the encroachment of Milton Keynes meant that the small Community at Filgrave felt that they needed to move, which they did in 1974, choosing a farmhouse on the North Yorkshire Moors in which to establish themselves. There, their work of prayer, study and manual work continued. Links to Sir John Tavener In the obituary in Gramaphone Magazine,[6] she was described as \\"a librettist, counsellor, 'spiritual mother' and even commercial adviser\\". As a leading theologian and religious thinker, she strongly influenced the great British composer, John Tavener, who converted to Orthodoxy from Presbyterianism. He was greatly influenced by her book The Life of St Mary of Egypt (1974) and this provided the plot for his second opera, Mary of Egypt (1992). She acted as his counsellor and spiritual advisor in the years after the death of his mother in 1985. She helped him to deal with the concern that he would not be able to compose original works again. It has also been said that she advised him to be more commercial. As a result, he wrote The Protecting Veil (1987), which was extremely popular. She also provided libretti for a series of important works including \\"Song for Athene\\" (1993) which was part of the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales, The Apocalypse (1993), Fall And Resurrection (1999), We Shall See Him As He Is (1993), and Let Us Begin Again (1995), inter alia. He wrote he could not have worked so well with another librettist: \\"It's one of those very special relationships in life, which will not ever happen again.\\" He dedicated The Music Of Silence: A Composer's Testament (1999) to her. She had \\"helped me put my music and my life together\\". Final Years ‚ÄúIn her final years at the Infirmary of the Order of the Holy Paraclete in Whitby she saw many visitors and old friends. She was cared for by a team who loved her and teased just as much as she did them.

It focuses around utilizing the region's multitude of \\"slides,\\" which are areas where the soil and growth have been washed away in a landslide, leaving a strip of bedrock; these slides have a wide variation in type, which could last as short as a few hundred feet to over a mile long, and as gradual as the hiking trails in the area to the point where they can accurately be described as cliffs. The activity gained much of its popularity after Hurricane Irene in 2011, where the downpour in the High Peaks region caused many slides to expand and appear. However, utilizing slides as means of climbing mountains likely goes back as far as the exploration and mapping of the area in the mid to late 1800s.Colvin, Verplanck. 1869. Albany Evening Journal, 1869, Sept. 11. In addition to the sport of simply climbing the slides, others utilize them as a unique way to summit the peak (despite the rough bushwhack they may require to get on or off the slide), or for the purpose of backcountry skiing towards middle to late winter when the snow has accumulated. Despite its popularity among the group of dedicated hiking community, it is inherently dangerous. A slip of fall could leave you dead, or injured or wounded hours away from help. As such, many climbers choose to learn on easier slides first, such as the Bennie's Brook Slide on Lower Wolfjaw, and then work their way up to more difficult and demanding slides. They typically require the use of rock shoes at the least, with helmets, harnesses, ropes and belay devices also being necessary, also with crampons or skis/snowshoes in the winter with ice protection as well, on the more difficult slides, such as the East Face Slide on Mount Marcy. While some are very easy to find and exit, others require extensive skill in backcountry navigation and an intimate knowledge of the area.

Course The source of the brook is on the edge of the Nottinghamshire Wolds, near Old Dalby, Leicestershire. It initially flows in a northerly direction, and then turns west passing through the villages of Widmerpool, and Bunny. It crosses Bunny and Ruddington moor, and then flows north between Clifton and the village of Ruddington. The brook joins the River Trent near Silverdale, on the outskirts of Nottingham near Clifton Bridge. Catchment The catchment has an area of , which lies between that of the Polser brook and River Smite to the north, and that of the Kingston brook to the south. The brook has a number of tributaries, which are mostly unnamed, except for the stream that flows from Gotham, known as the Gotham brook, the stream that flows between Ruddington village and Mickleborough Hill which is known as Packman's Dike, and the Nethergate brook which drains the Clifton estate. Fairham brook flowing through Bunny moor In its middle reaches the brook drains an area known as \\"The Moors\\", a flat fenland landscape that includes Ruddington, Bunny, Bradmore and Gotham moors. Agricultural drainage is important for these moors, with the smaller drains being maintained by the Trent Valley Internal Drainage Board. Fairham Brook acts as the arterial watercourse and has been designated as main river from Clifton to its confluence with the Trent. Wildlife and ecology Alongside the brook near Clifton, is a local nature reserve, which consists of wetland and scrub, where kingfishers have been seen in the vicinity of the brook. There is another nature reserve beside the brook known as Keyworth Meadow, which supports a population of turtle doves. In the 17th century, a bridge over the brook marked the start of Clifton Grove which was originally an avenue of elm trees that bordered the carriage route to Clifton Hall. Although the elm trees were lost to Dutch elm disease, the grove still exists, and contains other trees including oak, chestnut, and giant redwoods. It is now an important wildlife site and local nature reserve, that links other reserves alongside the River Trent, including Clifton wood and Holme Pit. Fairham brook has been classed as having poor ecological quality under the Water Framework Directive. This is one of the lower bands in the five part framework scale, which ranges from high, good, and moderate, through to poor and finally bad.

Cassette Store Day was first held in 2013. The celebration was inspired by Record Store Day, which acknowledges the importance of record stores and the vinyl music format. Origin Cassette Store Day was conceived by a group of record labels based in the UK. In a blog post for NME, BBC Radio 1 DJ Jen Long explained that she collaborated with Steven Rose of Sexbeat Records and Matt Flag of Suplex Cassettes to establish the observance. According to Long, although Cassette Store Day was inspired by Record Store Day, the intention of Cassette Store Day is focused on celebrating cassettes rather than supporting shops‚Äîwhereas the latter is the main goal of RSD. The first Cassette Store Day was observed on 7 September 2013. More than twenty-eight shops, including Rough Trade in London, participated by stocking special limited-edition cassettes. Some stores also hosted live performances. Cassette Store Day 2013 releases were led by the labels Sexbeat, Kissability, and Suplex Cassettes. New releases for Cassette Store Day 2013 included albums by Fucked Up and Fair Ohs, as well as cassettes reissues of material by artists including The Flaming Lips, At the Drive-In, and Haim. Despite a major decline in popularity after the introduction of compact discs, cassette sales are slowly increasing along with sales of other analogue formats. In June 2014, Cassette Store Day confirmed that the observance would continue into a second year. Despite continually unsteady cassette sales in recent years, founder Steve Rose expressed confidence in the cassette tape's \\"currentness\\" in the \\"DIY and underground scenes due to its affordability and ease\\". By 2016, shops in the US and UK were joined by participants in Australia, New Zealand, Germany, France, and Japan. Entering its seventh year in 2019, International Cassette Store Day is now managed in collaboration by Blak Hand Records (UK), Burger Records (USA) and Side-B Creations (Japan). Reception Cassette Store Day aims to repopularize Compact Cassettes. Founder Steve Rose did not anticipate resounding success for Cassette Store Day. However, he has predicted that the inexpensive and easy manufacturing of cassettes will help to steadily encourage their reintroduction. On the other hand, Bobby Owsinski wrote in Forbes that cassettes were too dilapidated to see the same resurgence as vinyl records. Writing for Washington City Paper, Sean Gray expressed reservations about Cassette Store Day and Record Store Day. Gray observes that as cassettes and records become more popular, prices may rise to exorbitant rates, making it difficult for collectors to enjoy the formats. Emma Garland of The Four Oh Five stated that while Record Store Day may overshadow small labels and artists, Cassette Store Day gives small labels better access to the celebration of analogue formats. Releases =2013= In 2013, more than 50 cassette editions of releases were issued for Cassette Store Day. The three founding labels, Sexbeat, Kissability, and Suplex, were supplemented by 4AD, Transgressive Records, Bella Union, and other small independent labels.

The wildfire destroyed at least 2,500 homes, leaving 11,000 people homeless. An additional 6,000 people were evacuated from the city, which was placed on red alert and declared a disaster zone. Fifteen people were confirmed killed and ten suffered serious injuries. Origin An investigation by the Chilean police is taking place to determine the origin of the Valpara√≠so wildfire. The police believes that it may have originated south of the Camino La P√≥lvora area, and southwest of Parque del Puerto cemetery. ONEMI officials have reported \\"there is no doubt the fire was started by the intervention of third parties\\". It is also thought that contact by birds on an electrical transmission cable may have generated the initial spark for the wildfire, but an investigation by electricity provider company Chilquinta stated that the incineration of black vultures or any other birds was unlikely to have started the fire. Development President Michelle Bachelet during a press conference about the wildfire The wildfire started on the afternoon of 12 April at 16:40 local time (19:40 UTC) in the Camino La P√≥lvora area near the El Molle dump in the commune of Valpara√≠so. As an initial measure, the Regional Government of Valpara√≠so (Intendencia de Valpara√≠so), along with the ONEMI (Oficina Nacional de Emergencia del Ministerio del Interior) and the CONAF (Corporaci√≥n Nacional Forestal), declared red alert in the commune. The fire, however, grew uncontrolled, and affected several houses. Subsequently, the Chilean government declared Valpara√≠so a disaster zone, which was later expanded to a state of constitutional exception, which allowed the Chilean Army to take control of the city, with the purpose of guarding the people's safety and maintaining public order. Several areas of the city were evacuated. During the wildfire, there were at least six general power outages in the city, which occurred between 18:00 and 01:00 local time, making it more difficult to extinguish the fire. This also made it easier for thieves to loot abandoned and damaged homes as a result of the evacuation. The fire is now regarded as the most catastrophic in the city's history. President Michelle Bachelet confirmed that \\"it may be the worst fire in the history of Valpara√≠so\\" and did not rule out that the number of victims and the damage estimate could increase as the ruins are inspected to determine the number of destroyed houses. She also sent \\"a message of support to all those hundreds of families who lost their homes, their things, and in some cases, their loved ones\\". It was reported that many Valpara√≠so residents were suffering from smoke inhalation. the impoverished neighbourhoods of Mariposa and La Cruz hills were the most affected areas. ONEMI reported that at least 850 hectares of vegetation (grassland, scrub and eucalyptus) were destroyed, and that twelve helicopters and three air tankers were struggling against the fire outbreaks that were still active in some hills. In total, according to the state organization, around 3,500 people from the CONAF, firefighters, police (carabineros de Chile), the army, health services and the ONEMI itself are working to combat and control the wildfire. The ONEMI has also sent trucks with mattresses, blankets, water, masks, tents and food rations for the victims of the wildfire, hosted in three schools and a Catholic church. One of the affected hills of Valpara√≠so, on 13 April 2014 Satellite image of the fire in Valpara√≠so, on 13 April 2014 The fire at Camino La P√≥lvora was worsened by another fire at Fundo Las Cenizas, which forced the authorities to request interregional support of firefighters. With strong winds and difficult access, the process of extinguishing the fire has proven challenging. The Chilean Red Cross chapter started the \\"Todos con Valpara√≠so y su gente\\" (Everyone with Valpara√≠so and its people) campaign, to help victims of the wildfire. Other NGOs and institutions have also collaborated in relief efforts. Esval (the local water supply company) announced an outage of supply on 13 April at Achupallas, Re√±aca Alto, Santa Julia, Villa Dulce Ampliaci√≥n, Curauma, and Placilla de Pe√±uelas. The wildfire re-activated in areas of Cerro Ramaditas, Rocuant, and Cuesta Colorada on 13 April, between 20:45 and 21:15 local time; the outbreaks of fire left 100 additional destroyed houses. Two fire engines collided as they were reaching the area, leaving two injured firefighters. On 14 April (two days after the wildfire started), about twenty-one aircraft worked on the fire extinguishment. Local firefighters reported an outbreak of fire at Ramaditas and Mariposa hills; while the ONEMI reported on 14 April afternoon there was an active fire in Fundo Los Perales. The office also announced three (out of thirteen) people killed by the wildfire were identified. The government announced the grant of 500 million Chilean pesos (approx. one million US dollars) to the commune of Valpara√≠so, because of the emergency. International reaction * ': Because the aircraft used by the Chilean government to combat the fire could not cover all the affected areas, international help was requested. Subsequently, the Argentine government announced they were sending Chile a White Helmet task force, firefighting planes and work teams. Foreign Minister H√©ctor Timerman gave his Chilean counterpart, Heraldo Mu√±oz, the \\"Argentine condolences and solidarity with the Chilean people.\\" *': Colombia, through its Ministry of Foreign Affairs, expressed its solidarity with the Chilean people as well as with the Chilean Government. In the same press release, Colombia gave its condolences to the families of the victims and offered support in order to \\"aid the sister nation of Chile to overcome the devastating effects of this terrible disaster\\". Colombia's consular team in Chile has also kept in touch with the Chilean authorities in order to bring prompt assistance to its nationals that might have been affected by the wildfire. * ': President of the Spanish government, Mariano Rajoy, expressed his \\"grief\\" for the wildfire, and gave his condolences to the victims' families; he also emphasized on the good relations between both countries, and said that \\"Their pain is ours. We, the Spanish people feel specially close to Chileans.

Bundy (born April 29, 1946) is an American cattle rancher who was charged and underwent pre-trial detention for his alleged role in the 2014 Bundy standoff. Bundy vocally advocated a philosophy opposed to what he views as federal government overreach. He is the father of Ammon Bundy, who in 2016 also led another armed standoff against the government, the occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon. Bundy initiated the 2014 Bundy standoff in Nevada, an armed standoff with federal and state law enforcement over defaulted grazing fees. On February 10, 2016, Cliven Bundy was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) at the Portland International Airport while he was on his way to support the Malheur Standoff. He was placed in federal custody, facing federal charges related to his own standoff with the Bureau of Land Management in 2014. On December 20, 2017, because of prosecutorial misconduct violating the federal Brady rule, his case was declared a mistrial by Judge Gloria Navarro and his charges were dismissed. Bundy has participated in, and had links with various related movements, including anti-government activism, (which opposes federal government involvement in favor of state and local governments) and the sovereign citizen movement (which holds that people are answerable only to their particular interpretation of the common law and are not subject to any government statutes or proceedings). Some view him as a hero for having led a movement of ranchers to encourage more ranchers to join him in defaulting on their grazing fees as per their federal grazing contracts. Bundy's views have also generated significant controversy and criticism; for instance, he came under fire for remarks suggesting that African Americans might have been better off under slavery than living under government subsidy. Early life Bundy was born on April 29, 1946, in Las Vegas, to David Ammon Bundy and Bodel Jensen Bundy. His father started grazing cattle with his 8-year-old son on an allotment near the farm in Bunkerville, Nevada that he purchased in 1949 while his mother had settled on land near Mesquite, Nevada. Worldview Bundy advocated for limited federal government involvement in local affairs, particularly in ranching. Bundy supported the ideas of the sovereign citizen movement. Many of the adherents of the movement argue that the federal government is illegitimate and does not have jurisdiction over individuals, meaning that laws do not apply to them. Bundy had asked for the support of members of the Oath Keepers, the White Mountain Militia, and the Praetorian Guard. Cliven Bundy has said he does not recognize federal police power over land that he believes belongs to the \\"sovereign state of Nevada.\\" Bundy has denied the jurisdiction of the federal court system over Nevada land and filed an unsuccessful motion to dismiss the Bureau of Land Management case against him by claiming the federal courts have no jurisdiction because he is a \\"citizen of Nevada, not the territory of Nevada\\". Bundy also believes that federally owned land in Nevada actually belongs to the state.Bundy doesn‚Äôt understand Constitution , Ian Bartrum, Las Vegas Review-Journal, April 27, 2014. According to The Guardian, Bundy told his supporters that \\"We definitely don't recognize [the BLM director's] jurisdiction or authority, his arresting power or policing power in any way,\\" and in interviews he used the language of the sovereign citizen movement, thereby gaining the support of members of the Oath Keepers, the White Mountain Militia and the Praetorian Guard militias. The movement is considered by the FBI as a major domestic terrorism threat. J. J. MacNab, who writes for Forbes about anti-government extremism, described Bundy's views as having been inspired by the sovereign citizen movement, whose adherents claim that the county sheriff is the most powerful law-enforcement officer in the country, with authority superior to that of any federal agent, local law-enforcement agency or any other elected official. On April 12, 2014, Bundy \\"ordered\\" Clark County Sheriff Doug Gillespie to confront the federal agents, disarm them and deliver their arms to Bundy within an hour of his demand, and later expressed disappointment that Gillespie did not comply. The Southern Poverty Law Center has described Bundy's views as closely aligned with those of the Posse Comitatus organization, and it has also asserted that such self-described \\"patriot\\" groups were focused on secession, nullification, and the principles of the Tenther movement. In May 2014, Bundy changed his party affiliation from the Republican Party to the Independent American Party. =Religion= Bundy is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and has attributed the outcome of the standoff to divine intervention. Standoff BLM Trespass Cattle Closure Map, April 11, 2014. The Bundy standoff was an armed confrontation between protesters and law enforcement that developed from a 20-year legal dispute between the United States Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and Cliven Bundy over unpaid grazing fees on federally owned land in southeastern Nevada. The dispute started in 1993, when, in protest against changes to grazing rules, Bundy declined to renew his permit for cattle grazing on BLM-administered lands near Bunkerville, Nevada. According to the Bureau of Land Management, Bundy continued to graze his cattle on public lands without a permit. In 1998, Bundy was prohibited by the United States District Court for the District of Nevada from grazing his cattle on an area of land later called the Bunkerville Allotment. In July 2013, U.S. District Judge Lloyd D. George ordered that Bundy refrain from trespassing on federally administered land in the Gold Butte area of Clark County. On March 27, 2014, acres of federal land in Clark County were temporarily closed for the \\"capture, impound, and removal of trespass cattle\\". BLM officials and law enforcement rangers began a roundup of such livestock on April 5, and an arrest was made the next day. On April 12, a group of protesters, some of them armed, advanced on what the BLM described as a \\"cattle gather\\". Sheriff Doug Gillespie negotiated with Bundy and newly confirmed BLM director Neil Kornze, who elected to release the cattle and de- escalate the situation. As of the end of 2015, Bundy continued to graze his cattle on Federal land and had not paid the fees. Personal life Cliven Bundy with his son Ammon in 2014 Bundy has claimed he was a descendant of Mayflower Pilgrims. Prior to his incarceration, Bundy lived in his family home which he built with his father. A Mormon, he has many descendants, including 14 adult children and 60 grandchildren. His children include Ammon Bundy and Ryan Bundy, two of the leaders of the 2016 occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. In a 2015 biography, The Guardian reported that Cliven Bundy did not carry a weapon out of concern it would make him an assassination target. The Guardian also reported that prior to his 2016 arrest, Bundy was protected by an armed body guard which he then claimed had 100 \\"heavy operators\\" in the Nevada area, ready to protect him if called upon. Racial comments About a week after the climax of the standoff, on April 19, 2014, Bundy spoke about witnessing a civil disturbance, the 1965 Watts riots. Bundy described his views about unhappiness at that time and criticized what he saw as government interference and its influence on African Americans. He recalled later seeing a public housing project in North Las Vegas where some of the older residents and the children sat on the porch. He said: In reference to Mexican people, he said: A year later Bundy called the reaction to his statements a \\"misunderstanding,\\" saying he was not racist and that he should not have used the term \\"Negro.\\" He added: \\"I've never had a black person or a brown person ever say anything bad about me.\\" He then proceeded to make further statements about race, comparing \\"welfare and housing\\" to slavery. He expressed support for Blacks who have \\"raised themselves up to a point where they are equal with the rest of us.\\" As an alternative to government jobs and programs, he touted private-sector work. \\"We don't need leeches feeding off us and eating off of us,\\" he said. \\"We need producers.\\" =Response by public officials= Then Minority Leader Democratic U.S. Senator from Nevada, Harry Reid, condemned the Bundy statement and said Bundy had, > \\"...revealed himself to be a hateful racist. But by denigrating people who > work hard and play by the rules while he mooches off public land he also > revealed himself to be a hypocrite ... It is the height of irresponsibility > for any individual or entity in a position of power or influence to glorify > or romanticize such a dangerous individual ... For their part, national > Republican leaders could help show a united front against this kind of > hateful, dangerous extremism by publicly condemning Bundy.\\" On April 23, 2014, Bundy defended his comments by saying \\"the statement was right\\". A number of Republican politicians and talk-show hosts who previously had supported Bundy, forcefully condemned his remarks as racist, including then-U.S. Senator Dean Heller of Nevada, who previously had described Bundy defenders as \\"patriots\\", and U.S. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky. On April 23, 2014, Heller said through a spokesperson that he \\"completely disagrees with Mr. Bundy's appalling and racist statements, and condemns them in the most strenuous way\\". =Response by the media= Sean Hannity, who had supported Bundy in his Fox News talk show, had interviewed Bundy several times, and had called him \\"a friend and frequent guest of the show\\", later said that Bundy's remarks were \\"beyond repugnant\\". Glenn Beck criticized Bundy's comments as \\"unhinged from reality\\" and urged his supporters to \\"end your relationship\\" with him. Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Patt Morrison saw the incident as one of many where an ordinary person is \\"turned into the poster boy or the poster girl of some political battle du jour.\\" Morrison wrote, \\"It happens so often that Las Vegas may have a betting line, not on whether these folks will implode but when. The Cliven Bundys of American politics, bit players who are suddenly promoted to center stage, are never as good as their adherents want them to be. They are not empty vessels, but they are flawed ones.\\" Ben Swann questioned whether Bundy's \\"inarticulate\\" comments were given a \\"truthful representation\\", and published a video segment which includes the comments preceding and following the quotation published by Adam Nagourney of The New York Times. Joseph Curl, writing for The Washington Times, described Bundy's views as incorrect and noted the New York Times had failed to print an entire transcript of the remarks. =Other= According to Geoffrey Lawrence, deputy policy director at the Nevada Policy Research Institute, Bundy lost personal credibility with his racist remarks. Lawrence argues that the discussion about federal land use in the West should not be abandoned, and that Congress should act to correct the \\"harsh and unfair federal misuse of state lands\\". 2016 arrest and prosecution Bundy was arrested at Portland International Airport in Oregon on February 10, 2016, while attempting to travel to Burns, Oregon to support militants at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. Bundy was booked into the downtown Multnomah County jail. In a 32-page criminal complaint, federal prosecutors charged Bundy with one count of conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States, one count of assault on a federal officer by use of a deadly weapon and aiding and abetting, two counts of use and carrying of a firearm in relation to a crime of violence and aiding and abetting, one count of interfering with commerce by extortion and aiding and abetting, and one count of obstruction of the administration of justice and aiding and abetting.United States v. Bundy, Complaint, February 11, 2016, case no. 2:16-mj-00127-PAL, U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada (Las Vegas Div.). Bundy made his first appearance before U.S. Magistrate Judge Janice M. Stewart in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon in Portland on February 11. He sought court-appointed counsel. At a detention hearing on February 16, Stewart ordered Bundy to be held without bail, citing the serious nature of the charges and the risk of flight. A preliminary hearing was held on March 4, 2016, at the Las Vegas federal courthouse. On March 10, Bundy refused to enter a plea to the charges against him, as well as recognize federal authority in the courtroom. U.S. Magistrate Judge Carl Hoffman subsequently entered a plea of not guilty for Bundy and scheduled his detention hearing on March 17. His trial was initially scheduled for May 2, but it was postponed to February 6, 2017. Two more of his sons, Melvin and David, were arrested on charges related to the Bundy standoff, along with 12 other men who were likewise involved. On March 10, 2016, Bundy also filed a lawsuit against Judge Gloria Navarro, Senator Harry Reid, Reid's son Rory, and President Barack Obama, alleging a number of conspiracy theories and describing the judge as a \\"Latino activist.\\" A day later, Bundy's lawyer attempted to serve the judge with the lawsuit during a detention hearing, demanding that the judge recuse herself from the proceedings because she was now involved in a legal conflict with Bundy. The motion was quickly denied, but the judge gave Bundy's lawyer until May 25 to make a case as to whether her previous work as a prosecutor in Clark County, Nevada merited any recusal. On May 25, Judge Navarro denied Bundy's motion for her recusal from the case, and ruled that he would not be granted bail due to factors including: *His history of ignoring federal laws and court orders. *The number of supporters willing to act as armed bodyguards. *The chance that he would flee from arrest or fail to report for court appearances as ordered. *The potential for violence by his supporters, constituting a danger to the community. Charlie Pierce, writing for Esquire, described Bundy's legal maneuvers as \\"a bubbling stew of pure crazy\\" sounding \\"like it was dialed in from someone's car to the worst talk-radio show on Planet Stupid\\"; while Amanda Marcotte of Salon described it as a nuisance lawsuit and an \\"incoherent scattershot of a lawsuit.\\" On October 17, 2016, Bundy dismissed his lawsuit against Navarro, President Obama, and the Reids. In a memo dated November 27, 2017, BLM lead investigator Larry Wooten alleged that he was removed from his role in the Bundy case for objecting to a \\"widespread pattern of bad judgment, lack of discipline, incredible bias, unprofessionalism and misconduct, as well as likely policy, ethical and legal violations among senior and supervisory [BLM] staff.\\" However, a prior internal investigation by BLM special agent Kent Kleman contradicted Wooten's particular allegations that staff assigned to the case withheld evidence that would assist the Bundy defense. On December 21, 2017, a mistrial was declared by Judge Navarro, citing a \\"willful\\" failure by federal prosecutors to turn over FBI and BLM documents that would potentially aid the defense. Soon thereafter on January 8, 2018, Navarro dismissed with prejudice all charges against Cliven Bundy and his sons, thus forbidding any retrial of the defendants. In her decision, Navarro further criticized prosecutors for willful violations of defendants' due process rights, as well as the aforementioned failure to properly turn over evidence to their lawyers. The government appealed the dismissal. = United States Appeal to the US 9th Circuit Court of Appeals = On August 6, 2020, the 9th United States Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco denied an appeal by United States prosecutors to reinstate the criminal prosecution of the Bundy's related to the 2014 armed standoff in Nevada and the 2016 armed protest and occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon. The appeals court ruled that the dismissal of the case against the Bundy's due to the prosecution withholding documents and other materials requested by the defense attorneys was proper and supported by the record of the case. The appeals court stopped short of affirming that prosecutorial misconduct had occurred and stated that ‚Äúmisjudgments\\" by prosecutors did not rise to professional misconduct in the case.

See also Christopher Creek - Geological feature References History Courtesy of Creekside Tavern: Christopher Creek, Arizona, which Zane Grey, the celebrated western author, fell in love with was settled in the 1880s by Isadore Creekside Cabins, who was a French cartographer, army scout, and explorer. His first attempt to marry failed when a mail order bride had a look at Isadore and left him to head east. Creekside Cabins turned lucky in the second time when Mary Hope married him and lived with Isadore at Christopher Creek on 160-acre CI Ranch for the rest of her life till through 1903. Isadore raised hogs and also hollowed out a log to brine cure his pork. Brine, a kind of saltwater, which is strong enough to float an egg, was used by homesteaders to keep meats for longer times, spanning weeks or months. The meat was sold to Fort McDowell and was also sold in Winslow. The ‚Äòhog log‚Äô that Isadore used is today on display at the Rim Country Museum. Later, Mrs. Ashby and her family purchased Isadore‚Äôs land in 1938 giving Mr. Christopher the due credits and opened the first Barbeque Restaurant in Christopher Creek. According to a story in The Whorehouse Bells Were Ringing Isadore was away from his ranch during an Apache raid. The Apaches burned two of his log cabins. The day before the raid ‚ÄúChristopher had killed a bear and had hung the carcass in or on one of the cabins. The military force in pursuit of the Indians included the legendary scouts Tom Horn and Al Sieber. They, along with the troops and other scouts decided that the burned bear carcass was Christopher and gave it a decent, solemn Christian burial. They became the objects of laughter and jokes when Christopher later appeared and identified the body.‚Äù Census-designated places in Gila County, Arizona Census- designated places in Arizona ","title":"Christopher Creek, Arizona"},{"id":"42482124","text":"Giovanni Battista Ricci and Cristoforo Greppi, frescos in San Francesco a Ripa, Rome Giovanni Battista Ricci (Novara, circa 1537 ‚Äì Rome, 1627) nicknamed Il Novara after his birth town, was an Italian painter of the late-Mannerist and early-Baroque period, active mainly in Rome.

Retrieved on 2015-5-2. also known as Jesus the Homeless, is a bronze sculpture by Canadian sculptor Timothy Schmalz depicting Jesus as a homeless person, sleeping on a park bench. The original sculpture was installed at Regis College, University of Toronto, in early 2013. Other casts have since been installed and blessed in many places across the world. Description and history Feet of the sculpture in Vancouver King's University College at Western University, Ontario. Homeless Jesus was designed by Timothy Schmalz, a Canadian sculptor and devout Catholic. It depicts Jesus as a homeless person, sleeping on a park bench. His face and hands are obscured, hidden under a blanket, but crucifixion wounds on his feet reveal his identity. The statue has been described as a \\"visual translation\\" of the Gospel of Matthew passage in which Jesus tells his disciples, \\"as you did it to one of the least of my brothers, you did it to me\\". Schmalz intended for the bronze sculpture to be provocative, admitting, \\"That's essentially what the sculpture is there to do. It's meant to challenge people.\\" He offered the first casts to St. Michael's Cathedral in Toronto and St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York, but both churches declined. One spokesperson for St. Michael's said the church declined because appreciation \\"was not unanimous\\" and it was undergoing restoration. The cast intended for St. Michael's was installed at Regis College, the Jesuit School of Theology at the University of Toronto. Similarly, a spokesperson for St. Patrick's complimented the work but declined purchasing the cast due to ongoing renovations. Signature of Timothy P. Schmalz on the bench of the Homeless Jesus sculpture. In 2013, the first cast was installed in the United States, at the St. Alban's Episcopal Church in Davidson, North Carolina. It was purchased for $22,000 and displayed as a memorial to parishioner Kate McIntyre, who had an affinity for public art. According to the Rev. David Buck, rector of St. Alban's, \\"It gives authenticity to our church. This is a relatively affluent church, to be honest, and we need to be reminded ourselves that our faith expresses itself in active concern for the marginalized of society\\". Buck welcomed discussion about the sculpture and considers it a \\"Bible lesson for those used to seeing Jesus depicted in traditional religious art as the Christ of glory, enthroned in finery.\\" Furthermore, he said in an interview with NPR, \\"We believe that that's the kind of life Jesus had. He was, in essence, a homeless person.\\" Detail of the face under the hood of the Homeless Jesus sculpture For the downtown Detroit location, Rev. Gary Wright, S.J. of the Saints Peter and Paul Jesuit Church has said Homeless Jesus honors and may comfort the homeless people whom the church serves. An anonymous alumnus of the Jesuit- and Sisters of Mercy-sponsored University of Detroit Mercy School of Law, which adjoins Saints Peter and Paul, donated funds for the statue at the church, placing it just across East Jefferson Avenue from Detroit's iconic Renaissance Center towers. Charleston, West Virginia, received the 8th Homeless Jesus statue in November, 2014. A cast has been installed on the Via della Conziliazione, the street leading to St. Peter's Basilica outside of the Papal Office of Charities in March 2016. Earlier, Schmalz visited the Pope in Vatican City in November 2013 to present a miniature version of his statue. He recalled about the Pope's reaction, \\"He walked over to the sculpture, and it was just chilling because he touched the knee of the Jesus the Homeless sculpture, and closed his eyes and prayed. It was like, that's what he's doing throughout the whole world: Pope Francis is reaching out to the marginalized.\\" Catholic Charities of Chicago and the Archdiocese of Washington, D.C. have both had casts installed outside of their offices. Pope Francis visited the sculpture installed along G Street in Chinatown, Washington, D.C., during his 2015 visit to the United States. St. Paul's Cathedral, Buffalo, New York, is now the permanent site for Homeless Jesus, installed during Holy Week 2015. St. Paul's, the Cathedral for The Episcopal Diocese of Western New York, is located at 139 Church Street (corner of Church and Pearl in downtown Buffalo). It was considered Buffalo‚Äôs first national architectural landmark in 1851, and is classified as a National Historic Landmark. Santo Domingo's Ciudad Colonial, Dominican Republic. In May 2016, a cast was installed at the new main services building of Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City along Classen Boulevard in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. An estimated 60,000 vehicles pass the sculpture daily at this location. In August 2017, a cast was installed at the front entrance of Father Woody's Haven of Hope in Denver, Colorado, at the corner of 7th and Lipan Streets. Father Woody's Haven of Hope mission is to provide food, shelter, clothing, counseling, rehabilitation and hygienic services to the homeless and less fortunate. Manchester has recently approved an installation outside St Ann's Church. The statue was originally going to be installed in Westminster outside of the Methodist Church's Westminster Central Hall but was eventually rejected. The city believed that the statue would not properly reflect the nature. The Bishop of Manchester reflected on the importance of having Homeless Jesus. He remembered Jesus saying that turning away from helping someone in need is like turning from Jesus. On Dec. 7th, 2017, a cast of the statue was installed in Nelson Mandela Place, Glasgow, Scotland. Scottish artist Peter Howson has made a painting of a homeless Jesus that will be shown alongside the statue. Glasgow priest Father Willy Slavin helped bring the sculpture to Scotland. He was contacted by Schmalz in 2015, and took the idea to the Glasgow Churches Together association. In April 2019 a statue was installed in the Gardens of Church of Our Lady and Saint Nicholas, Liverpool. It was unveiled by residents of Liverpool YMCA and blessed by the Bishop of Liverpool. The unveiling took place in the context of a Homelessness Conference organized by the Parish Church and Crispin Pailing and drawing together politicians with public, private and charitable sectors to address issues of homelessness in the City. In November 2019, a cast was installed in front of the St. James United Church in Montreal, Quebec, ahead of the observance of the second World Day of the Poor. Reception Reception of the statue has been mixed. According to NPR, \\"The reaction [to the cast in Davidson, North Carolina] was immediate. Some loved it; some didn't.\\" Some Davidson residents felt it was an \\"insulting depiction\\" of Jesus that \\"demeaned\\" the neighborhood. One Davidson resident called police the first time she saw it, mistaking the statue for a real homeless person. Another neighbor wrote a letter, saying it \\"[creeped] him out\\". However, according to Buck, residents are often seen sitting on the bench alongside the statue, resting their hands on Jesus and praying. Copies By early 2016, some 100 copies of Homeless Jesus were on display worldwide. The first sculpture outside of North America was installed on the grounds of Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin.

The Act established the administrative framework for the implementation of tax credits and sets out who is entitled to tax credits. The Labour Party continued to make radical changes to employment and welfare laws; in order to facilitate additional top-ups to the low paid. Thresholds were set down by law but changed by revision upwards on an annual basis. Annual changes were also made to the National Minimum Wage. The aim of the act was to reduce poverty, condemn bad employers for poverty pay, and raise standards. In 2015, the newly-elected Conservative majority government determined that Tax Credit abolition would save ¬£4.5 billion from annual expenditure. The plan proposal involved lowering the threshold and increasing the taper rate, in order to take the low paid out of taxation altogether. The Exchequer argued that tax credits were robbing taxpayers by subsidising low pay by employers; effectively repaying the poor from taxed wages. The House of Lords, that no longer had an in-built Conservative majority reported that they would consider rejecting the bill of repeal. Government ministers reminded their Lordships that there were precious few precedents for the revocation of a Statutory Instrument of this kind. The Lords has no constitutional authority over financial bills in Parliament.

The award was given in recognition of her public service record as a minister in Togo, notably, her contribution to the development of the country's digital economy and ICT sector. She is the first African woman political figure to receive the award since it was established in 1997. Education In 1996, Cina Lawson graduated from the Institut d‚Äô√©tudes politiques de Paris after two years of studies in the economic and financial program. She then obtained a masters of advanced studies in Applied Economics. She also holds a degree in History from the University Paris X. Cina Lawson then continued her studies in the United States, where she received a master in Public Policy from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. Career Lawson began her career in the communication and information technology department of the World Bank, in Washington DC. There, she advised governments on various matters such as telecom policies, regulatory reforms or privatization. She also worked as consultant for Alcatel-Lucent in Paris. From 2006 to 2010, she worked for France Telecom North America (Orange Group) in their business development department. On the 28th of May 2010, she was appointed Minister of Post and Telecommunications of the Togolese Republic by Prime Minister Gilbert Houngbo. She kept the position under the Kwesi Ahoomey-Zunu administration. In 2013, her portfolio expands to include digital affairs. This change denotes the will of the Togolese government to use information and communications technologies as a tool for economic development. As of 2019, her portfolio expanded again to include technological innovation. She is thus the Minister of Post, Digital Economy and Technological Innovation under the administration of Prime Minister Komi S√©lom Klassou. While in office, Cina Lawson contributed to the development of Togo's digital administration, to the integration of ICT in the education system, and to the reduction of the digital divide. She also initiated reforms to strengthen competition in the telecommunications sector. Licenses were issued in 2017 for two new Internet service providers, TEOLIS SA and Group Vivendi Africa and two more were extended to include 4G in June 2018 to the mobile operators, Moov Togo and Togo Cellulaire. She also strived to modernize the regulatory framework surrounding electronic communications (law n¬∞ 2012-18 12/12/2012), electronic transactions (law n¬∞ 2017-007 22/06/2017), setting up an environment that fosters cyber commerce and facilitates the digitization of administrative proceeding which ensures the establishment of basic legal principles. In 2019, she led the passing of a new data protection law in Togo as well as the privatisation of the historic telecommunications operator, Togocom.  Achievements  = E-government = Cina Lawson has worked to install a fiber optic network of 250km in Lom√©, connecting buildings which harbors public administrations, hospitals and university while giving them access to high speed internet. She also initiated several projects, including the creation of a professional email platform for government officials and of a unique internet portal for the administration: www.togo.tg. This portal combines the websites of the President (www.presidence.gouv.tg), the minister, the official journal (www.jo.gouv.tg) and the digitalized public services (www.service-public.gouv.tg). To better connect small localities and the central government, Cina Lawson launched the \\"E-Village\\" initiative, which provided more than 4300 local leaders with a professional mobile phone, a sim card and phone credit. This was completed by the creation of an innovative platform which collects, analyses and treats information. = Education = The initiative Wifi Campus, launched in January 2018 enabled the deployment of a fiber optic network over university campuses and teaching hospitals in Lom√© and Kara, in order to better connect them. She also carried out in June 2018 the initiative \\"Environnement Num√©rique de Travail\\" in all technical and scientific high schools. Educational resources were updated and a platform was set up for teachers, students and the whole staff to access information and educational services (online courses, timetable, homework, etc.). = Digital and financial inclusion = Regarding agriculture, the project Agri-PME directed by Cina Lawson has since 2015 led to the identification of vulnerable farmers and to the digitization of the annual payment of their subsidies for fertilizers. Cina Lawson contributed ton the presidential initiative CIZO, launched in November 2017, which sought to expand access to electricity through the provision of individual solar kits with basic electric equipment (lamps, radio, TV). The payment is done through a pay as you go system. Under her influence, the Togolese Post Society launched in May 2018 the ECO CCP account, which is the first saving account that is free, available on mobile phone and remunerated within the UEMOA. = Restructuring and privatisation of Togocom = Cina Lawson is also committed to the strengthening of the sector's governance, through the establishment of news specialized independent institutions, and the National Agency on the Radiofrequency spectrum (ANSR). In July 2017, she initiated the restructuring of Togo's historic fixed telecommunications operator Togo Telecom and its mobile arm Togocel. This reorganisation led to sweeping changes in the internal structure of the operators and their fusion into a single holding, Togocom Group. In 2018, Cina Lawson led the opening of Togocom Group to private investment paving the way for the privatisation of the state-run operators. In November 2019, the Togolese Government announced the completion of privatisation with the acceptance of a bid by Agou Holding to acquire a 51% stake in Togocom Group. As the new majority stakeholder, Agou Holding, a consortium composed of Madagascar's Axian Group and Africa-focused private equity firm Emerging Capital Partners (ECP), plans to revamp Togocom's service delivery with a $214 million investment over the next seven years. The closing of the deal left Togocom with an enterprise value of over $353 million.

In order to foster computer programming among young population, she launched a national contest of app development called Appstogo. In this perspective, Togo was also represented at the event Africa Code Week. = Cybersecurity = In an interview with La Tribune in March 2019, Cina Lawson stressed the need to train more Togolese experts in cybersecurity. During the 7th edition of the Africa CEO Forum in Kigali, Rwanda, Cina Lawson announced the launch of a new cybersecurity institution for Togo called Cyber Defense Africa which will be the first in Africa to combine two cyber security functions: National Security Operation Centre (SOC) and Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT). The joint-venture between the Government of Togo and Asseco Data Systems, a leading Polish IT firm, will provide state-of-the-art cybersecurity to citizens, public and private organisations in Togo and the sub-region. It will also provide the necessary training to create a body of African cybersecurity experts. = BLOC Fund = As a keen supporter of disruptive technologies and approaches to impact investment and financial inclusion, Cina Lawson was pivotal to the establishment of the BLOC (Bamboo Leapfrogging On Cryptocurrency) Fund with Bamboo Capital Partners and Moeda Seeds Bank, which she announced during the 7th Africa CEO Forum in March 2019. BLOC Fund is a pioneering impact fund in Africa and the first of its kind in the world to use blended finance to exclusively invest in companies that use new technologies, particularly blockchain, to solve social and economic challenges for the benefit of low- and middle-income populations in developing countries. Cina has stated that Togo invested into the fund ‚Äúto foster the development of tech companies, which are focused on achieving the Sustainable Development Goals‚Äù and ‚Äúto support local tech entrepreneurs to grow their businesses by providing them capital and tech expertise.

John would allegedly remove jewelry from corpses prior to dissolving them in acid and then hang the baubles as trophies from the basement rafters. During the 1970s, John unofficially adopted Kevin McMahon, a 12-year-old boy he discovered sleeping in his pool house. John served as a surrogate father to McMahon until John's imprisonment in 1989.

Construction began in 1938 and the aerodrome was in use until 1975. At its peak it was the largest water airport in Northern Europe. The first water airport in Troms√∏ was located at the port in the city center and opened in 1935 to serve Norwegian Air Lines (DNL) flights. Skatt√∏ra was first built by the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service, with construction starting in 1938. With the break-out of the Second World War in Norway on 9 April 1940, Skatt√∏ra was the home to Heinkel He 115 and Marinens Flyvebaatfabrikk M.F.11, which participated in the Norwegian Campaign. From June the air station was taken over by Luftwaffe. They expanded the facilities and made it the center for its seaplane fleet in the North Atlantic. The Royal Norwegian Air Force (RNoAF) took over Skatt√∏ra in 1945 and from 1947 it was designated a main air station. Until the military left in 1959, it hosted the 21 Transport Flight of Noorduyn Norseman transporters and the 333 Squadron with Consolidated PBY Catalina reconnaissance aircraft. It also hosted the area control center for Northern Norway until 1957. Civilian traffic commenced in 1946, first by DNL and later its successor Scandinavian Airlines System. Wider√∏e took over the scheduled flights in 1954, but withdrew in 1964 with the opening of Troms√∏ Airport, Langnes. Later operators at the airport included Helikopter Service from 1948 and Nor-Wing, and its successor Norving, from 1965. The control tower was closed in 1967 and the aerodrome abandoned in 1975. History =Preamble= The first proposals for an airport in Troms√∏ was presented in 1918 by Det Norske Luftfartsrederi, who intended to operate air route to Northern Norway. They conducted surveys in 1919, but filed for bankruptcy the following year without their plans being carried through. A 1922 report from Blehr's Second Cabinet proposed water aerodromes as far north as Harstad, but not Troms√∏. Five years later the city was included in the plans for future airline routes. The plans went unsubstantiated until the mid-1930s.Olsen-Hagen (2012): 9 Junkers aircraft visiting Troms√∏ in 1923, docked at the port in the city center When domestic air routes were established in 1935, there only went months from the approval to the services commenced. Permission was granted in April, at which time a suitable site for an aerodrome had yet to be identified. As an interim solution a buoy was founded for the first season. Norwegian Air Lines set up Troms√∏ as the last stop on its coastal service north of Bergen. Using a Junkers W 34, the route was inaugurated on 7 July and ran three times weekly for four weeks in the first season. Travel time to Bergen was ten and a half hours.Olsen-Hagen (2012): 10 From the 1936 season a permanent location for the airport was needed. A key factor was the need to place it as close to the city center as possible. Troms√∏ysundet was selected as the runway and the docks and terminal were located at Dampskipkaien. DNL specified their needs and Troms√∏ Municipality built the airport after the specifications. The most costly part was a floating docks, which was built using twelve used oil drums. A barracks in the inner parts of the port was used as a terminal building.Olsen-Hagen (2012): 11 =Naval establishment= Parliament approved construction of a naval air station in Northern Norway in 1933. The following year the Ministry of Defense asked that two Marinens Flyvebaatfabrikk M.F.11 be station to the north. Ramsund Naval Base was initially proposed as a suitable location, as it would allow it to be co- located with the rest of the operations of the Royal Norwegian Navy.Hafsten (2003): 43 Also Salangen and Harstad were considered. However, the need for a base closer to Finnmark caused them to be discarded.Jensen (2001): 1 The search was intensified with a committee appointed in 1936. They looked at four sites in Troms‚ÄîGibostad, Eidkjosen, Hessfjord and Breivika. The latter included sites both at and south of Skatt√∏ra. It was chosen due to its proximity to Finnmark, proximity to the Navy's offices in Troms√∏ and good landing conditions under a variety of wind conditions. The plans included two hangars the size of the ultimate building, two barracks, a terminal two slipways, docks and ammunition storage. The goal was to make the airport the main air station for seaplanes in Northern Norway. Funding of 100,000 Norwegian krone was granted in 1936 and the project was scheduled for completion in 1941.Jensen (2001): 2 The Navy signed a lease for of land for five years. This was because the station was presumed to be provisional. However, as the fear of war rose, the state chose to expropriate the property on 25 July 1938. Construction commenced in January 1939, consisting of a slipway, a guard station, a barracks and a fuel depot. Further work was started to allow six torpedo bombers and twelve reconnaissance aircraft be stationed at Skatt√∏ra. Heinkel He 115 of the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service at the airport on 28 May 1940, during the Norwegian Campaign With the full mobilization in September 1939, the Navy Air Service organized its 3rd Air Wing at Skatt√∏ra, with detachments at Hammerfest and Vads√∏. The air wing was activated on 27 September, consisting of a single M.F.11. At the time the aerodrome only had a few buoys to anchor to. In October three Heinkel He 115 torpedo bombers were dispatched and were used to patrol the coast from Kirkenes to Helgeland.Arheim (1994): 26 With Operation Weser√ºbung‚Äîthe German invasion of Norway on 9 April 1940‚Äîthe aircraft at Skatt√∏ra did not conduct any activities until 13 April, when they partook in reconnaissance in Ofotfjorden. They were thereafter spread to locations from Central H√•logaland to Finnmark, with as few aircraft as possible at Skatt√∏ra at any given time.Hafsten (1991): 69 Through May the 3rd Air Wing received reinforcements from the south and was by then operating six He 115s and six M.F.11s. This included two captures He 115s.Jensen (2001): 3 Nygaardsvold's Cabinet took office in Troms√∏ and from 13 May the airport was used for flights to and from Sweden and Shetland. In addition to the 3rd Air Wing, these flights were carried out by the French Air Force and the Royal Air Force,Hafsten (1991): 71 the latter who for a period had a Short Sunderland stationed there. The aircraft and crew flew 174 missions, including reconnaissance, transport and bombing of German targets in Ofoten.Jensen (2001): 4 =Luftwaffe operation= A Heinkel He 115C of Luftwaffe at Skatt√∏ra in 1940 Following the surrender in Northern Norway on 10 July 1940, the Luftwaffe took control over Skatt√∏ra. Two days later the airport was cleared for use by German aircraft. Skatt√∏ra was first used by 1. K√ºstenfliegergruppen/506, but their He 115s were soon bombed or destroyed in a fire. Skatt√∏ra was taken over by 2. K√ºstenfliegergruppen/506., which also operated He 115s. From September these aircraft were used to send freight and supplies to Jan Mayen and Svalbard.Hafsten (1991): 111 Until October an air ambulance operated out of Skatt√∏ra.Hafsten (1991): 112 German water airport efforts in Northern Norway originally centered around their own plans for Billefjord Airport and S√∏rreisa Airport. However, with the onset of the fall storms, the Luftwaffe realized the favorable location of Skatt√∏ra. From 1941 they therefore resumed the Norwegian plans for completing the air station. Work progressed with limited supplies and those needed for the Polar Line were cannibalized to give way for the airport's completion.Jensen (2001): 5 From 5 July the workforce was supplemented and later dominatedby Eastern European prisoners of war (POW), mostly from Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union. As of 1 January 1943 there were 441 POWs in Troms√∏, most of which were working at Skatt√∏ra. By 1 April 1945 the number had increased to 1,325, of which 661 were working at Skatt√∏ra. Eighteen POWs died in Troms√∏ during the war.Troms County Municipality (2014): 59 Aftermath of the bombing of the airport on 26 August 1940 About ninety percent of Luftwaffe's seaplane fleet was allocated to Norway, and of that between eighty and ninety percent was allocated to Seefliegerhorst Troms√∂. Although the center of operations, The Seefliegerhorst commanded water air stations along the coast from √Ölesund Airport, S√∏rneset to Kirkenes. Aircraft based at Skatt√∏ra included He 115 torpedo bombers; Arado Ar 196, Arado Ar 199, He 59 and Blohm & Voss BV 222 communication aircraft; BV 138, Dornier Do 18 and Do 24 and reconnaissance aircraft, Do 24 search and rescue aircraft and Fieseler Fi 156. There were also patrol boats, two catapult ships and various auxiliary ships stationed at Skatt√∏ra.Jensen (2001): 6 About 1,500 people were working at Skatt√∏ra. There were not sufficient quarters for these at the air station, so they were lodged throughout Troms√∏. An important task was patrol of the Arctic convoys, in which the reconnaissance aircraft would search for and then report the position of the convoys to naval ships and U-boats. Deutsche Luft Hansa operated an airline route from Kirkenes via Troms√∏ to Hamburg. It was flown three times a week during the summer and at least once a week during the winter. Initially operating with a Ju 52, it was later upgraded to the BV 222. There were two Allied bombings of Skatt√∏ra. The first was on 26 August 1940, conducted by a British Supermarine Walrus. The second took place on 12 April 1942, when the aerodrome was hit by bombs from a Soviet Ilyushin DB-3. Damage was limited to a few blasted oil drums and a few injured soldiers.Hafsten (1991): 133 =Royal Norwegian Air Force operations= Dornier Do 24 at Skatt√∏ra in 1945‚Äì46 The RNoAF returned to Skatt√∏ra in May 1945, after the end of the war.Hafsten (2003): 44 The No. 8601 Demolition Squadron RAF was flown to Troms√∏ to demolish the majority of the Luftwaffe's aircraft. Two Do 24 were taken over by the RNoAF. They were crewed with German pilots and were used to transport German soldiers to conduct minesweeping, as well as to act as ambulances. They were moved to Fornebu Air Station in October,Arheim (1994): 113 but returned for the 1946 season.Jensen (2001): 7 No. 21 Communication Flight was set up at Skatt√∏ra almost immediately after the surrender. They flew Noorduyn Norseman transporters. This task was taken over by the Small Transport Wing in 1946. They would retain between two and four Norsemen at the airport until its closing for military operations.Arheim (1994): 179 Skatt√∏ra was also the base for three Junkers Ju 52 transports of the 335 Squadron from 22 June to November 1945.Arheim (1994): 130 The 333 Squadron was from 1 January 1946 equipped with Consolidated PBY Catalinas. A detachment of these were station at Skatt√∏ra. Their main task was transporting freight, passengers and goods to Svalbard, including the communities of Longyearbyen, Isfjord Radio, Ny-√Ölesund, Hopen and Bj√∏rn√∏ya. The squadron also performed search and rescue and air ambulance missions.Arheim (1994): 114 Two- thirds of the building complex at the station was demolished in the remainder of 1945. This was done to secure building material for the reconstruction of Finnmark. For instance Gunnarnes Chapel is a former barracks built at Skatt√∏ra.Jensen (2001): 14 Skatt√∏ra was the only naval air station of the Navy Air Service to resume use after the war. All other seaplane bases were jointly located with land airport.Hafsten (2003): 44 The Air Force decided in 1947 to make Skatt√∏ra one of its five main air stations‚Äîand the only one of these to be a water airport. The Air Force and the civilian aviation authorities determined that Norway would receive two area control centers for its air traffic control. One of these was located at Troms√∏ and located in the subterranean structure at Marielund. This also acted as a rescue coordination center. The fire station was converted to a joint control tower and weather station.Jensen (2001): 9 With the advent of the Korean War, the 333 Squadron was moved from Sola Air Station to Skatt√∏ra in 1950. Their new main mission was surveillance of the northern sea area of the Norwegian Sea and the Barents Sea. The squadron moved back to Sola in May 1952, although a detachment remained in Troms√∏. From 1953 to 1 November 1955 the squadron also operated Noorduyn Norseman transporters. Flights to Svalbard and Jan Mayen were then flown out of Bod√∏ Main Air Station, although they did not have sufficient range for these missions and had to land at Troms√∏ for refueling. The Catalinas therefore continued to operate out of Skatt√∏ra until 1959.Jensen (2001): 8 The Royal Norwegian Navy had a small guard unit at Skatt√∏ra from 1945 to 1949.Jensen (2001): 10 From 1954 the 21 Communication Flight was equipped with de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otters, to supplements its Norsemen. They originally had pontoons, later they received amphibious pontoons. The air artillery set up a unit at Skatt√∏ra in 1955, with the task of providing air defense for Troms√∏. They remained until 1960. With Norway's entry into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization a large amount of funding was allocated to building new land airports. This and the technological development meant that seaplanes would no longer be a central part of the Air Force. Skatt√∏ra was during the 1950s the only NATO water air station. However, it would take over a decade before the other infrastructure and aircraft had reached such a standard that the air station could be closed. With the replacement of the Catalinas with Grumman HU-16 Albatross, the northern detachment of the 333 Squadron relocated to And√∏ya Air Station.Arheim (1994): 115 The military activity at Skatt√∏ra was therefore terminated in March 1959. However, Albatrosses would continue to use the civilian airport throughout the 1960s. The Navy returned to Skatt√∏ra in 1962 and used the hangar as a depot. It also had a surveillance vessel, Hav√∏rn, which was disguised as a fishing vessel. During the preamble for establishing the Coast Guard during the 1960s, Skatt√∏ra was considered as a possible main base for the flotilla. The Navy pulled out of Skatt√∏ra in 1969. =Commercial operations= When commercial flights resumed on 27 May 1946, Skatt√∏ra was allocated to also serve as the civilian airport for Troms√∏. DNL resumed its coastal route, still flown with Junkers Ju 52 aircraft.Olsen-Hagen (2012): 13 The following year the 37-passenger Short Sandringham flying boats were introduced on the haul,Olsen- Hagen (2012): 14 which remained in use until 1952. SAS's flights continued until 1954, from 1951 as part of the Scandinavian Airlines System consortium.Jensen (2001): 12 Polarfly was established in 1948 and stationed two Norsemen at Skatt√∏ra to act as air ambulance and air taxi. The following year Polarfly merged with Wider√∏e. Skatt√∏ra soon became the airline's main technical base in Northern Norway. Due to security concerns, a separate passenger terminal was built at the aerodrome in 1952, outside the gate of the air station. Bod√∏ Airport opened as the first civilian land airport in Northern Norway in 1952. It was followed by Bardufoss Airport in 1956. The latter served only a small community, but its military counterpart, Bardufoss Air Station, was expanded to meet NATO demands. SAS started direct flights from Bardufoss to Oslo, using it to serve all of Troms. Subsequently, it also shut down its operations out of Skatt√∏ra.Olsen-Hagen: 15 Troms√∏ Air Traffic Control Center remained until 1 January 1957, when it was relocated to Bod√∏. Wider√∏e was given the task of flying the seaplane routes to Finnmark on SAS's concession from 1954. For this Wider√∏e bought new Otters. Two years later the airline took over maintenance of the military aircraft at Skatt√∏ra. The services out of Troms√∏ continue until 1962, when the government abolished the subsidies for the routes. The following year three land airports opened in Finnmark. Wider√∏e remained at Skatt√∏ra until 14 September 1964, when Troms√∏ Airport, Langnes opened. Langnes received its own water aerodrome and Wider√∏e moved its operations there, abandoning Skatt√∏ra. Scancopterservice, later Helikopter Service, established itself at Skatt√∏ra in 1958. Its Bell 47 was the first helicopter based in Troms. Most of its early contracts were tied to construction of hydroelectric power stations. Nor-Wings was established in 1965 and made Skatt√∏ra its base for general aviation jobs. At first it operated a Norseman and later a H√∏nningstad C.5 Polar.Jensen (2001): 13 The control tower at Skatt√∏ra was closed on 1 January 1967. Nor-Wing merged with Varangfly in 1971 to create Norving.Melling: 71 Other airlines which for shorter or longer periods had an aircraft stationed at Skatt√∏ra were Bj√∏rumfly, M√∏refly, Norfly, Norr√∏nafly and Ski og Sj√∏fly. Helikopter pulled out of Skatt√∏ra in 1972 and Norving abandoned the airport three years later. =Later use= Contemporary view of the airport Civilian use of the company began in the 1950s. The ward was in 1955 converted to a psychiatric clinic. The civilian cafeteria was taken over by Northern Troms Vocational School in 1957 and used as a dormitory. The mess hall was converted to a gym in 1960 and its basement as a shooting range used by the Home Guard.Jensen (2001): 15 Starting in the 1970s the Skatt√∏ra area became a popular growth area and the seaside properties in the area experienced a development into industrial sites.Eilertsen (1984): 28 R√∏stad B√•t og Motorco moved into the hangar in 1980. The supplier of boats and boat equipment started the process of converting the docks into a marina.Eilertsen (1984): 144 Later it used the hangars for boat construction. The hangar was rebuilt during the 1990s and given two stories, such that most of the interior does not represent its original form. However, the exterior is largely intact.Troms County Municipality (2014): 22 Troms√∏ Municipality retains ownership of most of the properties at the site.Troms County Municipality (2014): 7 Local historical enthusiasts proposed in 2003 that the remains of the airport be listed as a cultural heritage. This was followed up by Troms County Municipality in December 2009, when they started the listing process. The rationale is that Skatt√∏ra represents the best preserved water airport in Northern Europe and the best preserved military installation in Troms from modern times.Troms County Municipality (2014): 5 Facilities The airport was situated at Skatt√∏ra in what was then Troms√∏ysund Municipality, in today's Troms√∏, some north of the city center. The predominant structure at the airport was the twin hangar building. It consists of two concrete arch triplets which carry the roof. Inside the hangar is split in two with a reinforced wall. The structure measures . There were two slipways, one falling down from the hangar and one further north.Troms County Municipality (2014): 23 There was a pier which ran out from the airport, with a small building at the end.Troms County Municipality (2014): 25 A reinforced wall was built to protect aircraft from attack. From 1937 to 1945 there was an aeradio at the airport. It was then merged and taken over by and co-located with Troms√∏ Radio.Eilertsen (1984): 172 The airport had a control tower situated in the former fire station. From 1947 to 1957 Troms√∏ Air Traffic Control Center was situated in a subterranean facility at Marielund. Its area of operation covered from Tr√∏ndelag and north in Norway, as well as the Atlantic Ocean out to Svalbard, Jan Mayen and Iceland. Luftwaffe installed a subterranean fuel depot. It was taken over by Norsk Br√¶ndselolje, which was again taken over by British Petroleum. At its peak eight people were employed with the fuel service. Shell was responsible for aviation fuel from 1945 to 1972. The base had from 1947 a post office and from 1949 a general store. Both were closed in 1969.

In 1888, after eight years apprenticeship at his father's watch-making business, Giovanni Battista started building Welleyes bicycles, so named because English names had more sales appeal. In October 1898 Giovanni Battista and Matteo co-founded Ceirano GB & C and started producing the Welleyes motor car in 1899. In July 1899 the plant and patents were sold to Giovanni Agnelli and produced as the first F.I.A.T.s - the Fiat 4 HP. Giovanni Battista was employed by Fiat as the agent for Italy, but within a year he left to found Fratelli Ceirano & C. which in 1903 became Societ√† Torinese Automobili Rapid (S.T.A.R.) building cars badged as 'Rapid'.

It lived during the Pleistocene and early Holocene in northern parts of North America (Alaska, US and Canada). Very similar forms have also been found also in Siberia. Distribution The giant pika has been found in Alaska (United States), Yukon (O. whartoni and O cf. whartoni, large number of locations), Alberta and Ontario (Canada). A close relative O. whartoni (O. cf. whartoni) is also known from Eastern Siberia and Kolyma. The ancestors of these pikas migrated from Eurasia to North America during the Early Pleistocene via the Bering Land Bridge, along with another group of small pikas close to the \\"O. pusilla group\\".

Unlike the American pika (O. princeps), which inhabits scree slopes, the giant pika's habitat was largely tundra and steppe, similar to Eurasian pikas.

Jordanus studied at the University of Copenhagen, where in 1550 he was appointed Professor of Mathematics. Among other things, he gave lectures on geodesy and dealt with the geography of Ptolemy. In 1552, he published a map with the printer Hans Vingaard in Copenhagen. This was one of the first printed maps of the Duchies of Schleswig and Holstein, and Abraham Ortelius referred to it in his Catalogus Cartographorum. The map is now lost, and no copies survive.  Career  Duchies of Schleswig and Holstein in 1559 with calendar 1558-1585 by Marcus Jordanus In 1553, Cristian III of Denmark and Norway commissioned Jordanus to visit and map all the provinces of the empire. The resulting map was handed over to the University Library in Copenhagen, but is no longer there. After this commission, the cartographer did not return to the University, but devoted his time to further mapping work. In 1559 he published another map of the Duchies of Schleswig and Holstein. It also included a calendar of 1558 to 1585. There is a copy of this map in the library of the University of Leiden. Jordanus later returned to his birthplace, where he was mayor in 1568 and 1582.

In 2008, graphene produced by exfoliation was one of the most expensive materials on Earth, with a sample the area of a cross section of a human hair costing more than $1,000 as of April 2008 (about $100,000,000/cm2). Since then, exfoliation procedures have been scaled up, and now companies sell graphene in large quantities. The price of epitaxial graphene on silicon carbide is dominated by the substrate price, which was approximately $100/cm2 as of 2009. Hong and his team in South Korea pioneered the synthesis of large- scale graphene films using chemical vapour deposition (CVD) on thin nickel layers, which triggered research on practical applications, with wafer sizes up to reported. By 2017, graphene electronics were being manufactured in a commercial fab on a 200 mm line. In 2013, the European Union made a ‚Ç¨1 billion grant to be used for research into potential graphene applications. In 2013 the Graphene Flagship consortium formed, including Chalmers University of Technology and seven other European universities and research centers, along with Nokia.  Medicine  Researchers in 2011 discovered the ability of graphene to accelerate the osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells without the use of biochemical inducers. In 2015 researchers used graphene to create biosensors with epitaxial graphene on silicon carbide. The sensors bind to 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and is capable of selective binding with antibodies. The presence of 8-OHdG in blood, urine and saliva is commonly associated with DNA damage. Elevated levels of 8-OHdG have been linked to increased risk of several cancers. By the next year, a commercial version of a graphene biosensor was being used by biology researchers as a protein binding sensor platform. In 2016 researchers revealed that uncoated graphene can be used as neuro-interface electrode without altering or damaging properties such as signal strength or formation of scar tissue. Graphene electrodes in the body are significantly more stable than electrodes of tungsten or silicon because of properties such as flexibility, bio-compatibility and conductivity. = Tissue engineering = Graphene has been investigated for tissue engineering. It has been used as a reinforcing agent to improve the mechanical properties of biodegradable polymeric nanocomposites for engineering bone tissue applications. Dispersion of low weight % of graphene (‚âà0.02 wt.%) increased in compressive and flexural mechanical properties of polymeric nanocomposites. The addition of graphene nanoparticles in the polymer matrix lead to improvements in the crosslinking density of the nanocomposite and better load transfer from the polymer matrix to the underlying nanomaterial thereby increasing the mechanical properties. = Contrast agents, bioimaging = Functionalized and surfactant dispersed graphene solutions have been designed as blood pool MRI contrast agents. Further, iodine and manganese incorporating graphene nanoparticles have served as multimodal MRI- computerized tomograph (CT) contrast agents. Graphene micro- and nano- particles have served as contrast agents for photoacoustic and thermoacoustic tomography. Graphene has also been reported to be efficiently taking up cancerous cells thereby enabling the design of drug delivery agents for cancer therapy. Graphene nanoparticles of various morphologies such as graphene nanoribbons, graphene nanoplatelets and graphene nanoonions are non-toxic at low concentrations and do not alter stem cell differentiation suggesting that they may be safe to use for biomedical applications. = Polymerase chain reaction = Graphene is reported to have enhanced PCR by increasing the yield of DNA product. Experiments revealed that graphene's thermal conductivity could be the main factor behind this result. Graphene yields DNA product equivalent to positive control with up to 65% reduction in PCR cycles. = Devices = Graphene's modifiable chemistry, large surface area per unit volume, atomic thickness and molecularly gatable structure make antibody- functionalized graphene sheets excellent candidates for mammalian and microbial detection and diagnosis devices. Graphene is so thin that water has near-perfect wetting transparency which is an important property particularly in developing bio-sensor applications. This means that a sensor coated in graphene has as much contact with an aqueous system as an uncoated sensor, while remaining protected mechanically from its environment. Energy of the electrons with wavenumber k in graphene, calculated in the Tight Binding- approximation. The unoccupied (occupied) states, colored in blue‚Äìred (yellow‚Äìgreen), touch each other without an energy gap exactly at the above- mentioned six k-vectors. Integration of graphene (thickness of ) layers as nanoelectrodes into a nanopore can potentially solve a bottleneck for nanopore-based single-molecule DNA sequencing. On November 20, 2013 the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation awarded $100,000 'to develop new elastic composite materials for condoms containing nanomaterials like graphene'. In 2014, graphene-based, transparent (across infrared to ultraviolet frequencies), flexible, implantable medical sensor microarrays were announced that allow the viewing of brain tissue hidden by implants. Optical transparency was greater than 90%. Applications demonstrated include optogenetic activation of focal cortical areas, in vivo imaging of cortical vasculature via fluorescence microscopy and 3D optical coherence tomography. = Drug delivery = Researchers at Monash University discovered that a sheet of graphene oxide can be transformed into liquid crystal droplets spontaneously‚Äîlike a polymer‚Äîsimply by placing the material in a solution and manipulating the pH. The graphene droplets change their structure in the presence of an external magnetic field. This finding raises the possibility of carrying a drug in graphene droplets and releasing the drug upon reaching the targeted tissue by making the droplets change shape in a magnetic field. Another possible application is in disease detection if graphene is found to change shape at the presence of certain disease markers such as toxins. A graphene ‚Äòflying carpet‚Äô was demonstrated to deliver two anti-cancer drugs sequentially to the lung tumor cells (A549 cell) in a mouse model. Doxorubicin (DOX) is embedded onto the graphene sheet, while the molecules of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) are linked to the nanostructure via short peptide chains. Injected intravenously, the graphene strips with the drug payload preferentially concentrate to the cancer cells due to common blood vessel leakage around the tumor. Receptors on the cancer cell membrane bind TRAIL and cell surface enzymes clip the peptide thus release the drug onto the cell surface. Without the bulky TRAIL, the graphene strips with the embedded DOX are swallowed into the cells. The intracellular acidic environment promotes DOX's release from graphene. TRAIL on the cell surface triggers the apoptosis while DOX attacks the nucleus. These two drugs work synergistically and were found to be more effective than either drug alone. The development of nanotechnology and molecular biology has provided the improvement of nanomaterials with speciÔ¨Åc properties which are now able to overcome the weaknesses of traditional disease diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. In recent years, more attention has been devoted to designing and the development of new methods for realizing sustained release of diverse drugs. Since each drug has a plasma level above which is toxic and below which is ineÔ¨Äective and in conventional drug delivery, the drug concentration in the blood rises quickly and then declines, the main aim of an ideal drug delivery system (DDS) is to maintain the drug within a desired therapeutic range after a single dose, and/or target the drug to a speciÔ¨Åc region while simultaneously lowering the systemic levels of the drug. Graphene‚Äìbased materials such as graphene oxide (GO) have considerable potential for several biological applications including the development of new drug release system. GOs are an abundance of functional groups such as hydroxyl, epoxy, and carboxyl on its basal surface and edges that can be also used to immobilize or load various biomolecules for biomedical applications. On the other side, biopolymers have frequently been used as raw materials for designing drug delivery formulations owing to their excellent properties, such as non-toxicity, biocompatibility, biodegradability and environmental sensitivity, etc. Protein therapeutics possess advantages over small molecule approaches including high target speciÔ¨Åcity and low oÔ¨Ä target eÔ¨Äects with normal biological processes. Human serum albumin (HSA) is one of the most abundant blood proteins. It serves as a transport protein for several endogenous and exogenous ligands as well as various drug molecules. HSA nanoparticles have long been the center of attention in the pharmaceutical industry due to their ability to bind to various drug molecules, high storage stability and in vivo application, non‚Äìtoxicity and antigenicity, biodegradability, reproducibility, scale‚Äìup of the production process and a better control over release properties. In addition, signiÔ¨Åcant amounts of drugs can be incorporated into the particle matrix because of the large number of drug binding sites on the albumin molecule. Therefore, the combination of HSA-NPs and GO-NSs could be useful for reducing the cytotoxicity of GO-NSs and the enhancement of drug loading and sustained drug release in cancer therapy. = Biomicrorobotics = Researchers demonstrated a nanoscale biomicrorobot (or cytobot) made by cladding a living endospore cell with graphene quantum dots. The device acted as a humidity sensor. =Testing= In 2014 a graphene based blood glucose testing product was announced. =Toxicity= The toxicity of graphene has been extensively debated in the literature. The most comprehensive review on graphene toxicity published by Lalwani et al. summarizes current knowledge of the in vitro, in vivo, antimicrobial, and environmental toxicities of graphene, and highlights the various mechanisms of graphene toxicity. Results show that the toxicity of graphene is dependent on several factors such as shape, size, purity, post-production processing steps, oxidative state, functional groups, dispersion state, synthesis methods, route and dose of administration, and exposure times.  Electronics  Graphene has a high carrier mobility, and low noise, allowing it to be used as the channel in a field-effect transistor. Unmodified graphene does not have an energy band gap, making it unsuitable for digital electronics. However, modifications (e.g. Graphene nanoribbons) have created potential uses in various areas of electronics. = Transistors = Graphene transistors have been built that are chemically controlled, and others that are voltage controlled. Graphene exhibits a pronounced response to perpendicular external electric fields, potentially forming field-effect transistors (FET). A 2004 paper documented FETs with an on-off ratio of ‚âà30 at room temperature. A 2006 paper announced an all-graphene planar FET with side gates. Their devices showed changes of 2% at cryogenic temperatures. The first top-gated FET (on‚Äìoff ratio of <2) was demonstrated in 2007. Graphene nanoribbons may prove generally capable of replacing silicon as a semiconductor. for graphene-based electronics was issued in 2006. In 2008, researchers at MIT Lincoln Lab produced hundreds of transistors on a single chip and in 2009, very high frequency transistors were produced at Hughes Research Laboratories. A 2008 paper demonstrated a switching effect based on a reversible chemical modification of the graphene layer that gives an on‚Äìoff ratio of greater than six orders of magnitude. These reversible switches could potentially be employed in nonvolatile memories. In 2008, the smallest transistor so far, one atom thick, 10 atoms wide was made of graphene. IBM announced in December 2008 that they had fabricated and characterized graphene transistors operating at GHz frequencies. In 2009, researchers demonstrated four different types of logic gates, each composed of a single graphene transistor. In May 2009, an n-type transistor was announced meaning that both n and p-type graphene transistors had been created. A functional graphene integrated circuit was demonstrated‚Äîa complementary inverter consisting of one p- and one n-type graphene transistor. However, this inverter suffered from a very low voltage gain. Typically, the amplitude of the output signal is about 40 times less than that of the input signal. Moreover, none of these circuits operated at frequencies higher than 25 kHz. In the same year, tight-binding numerical simulationsFiori G., Iannaccone G., \\"On the possibility of tunable-gap bilayer graphene FET\\", IEEE Electr. Dev. Lett., 30, 261 (2009) demonstrated that the band-gap induced in graphene bilayer field effect transistors is not sufficiently large for high-performance transistors for digital applications, but can be sufficient for ultra-low voltage applications, when exploiting a tunnel-FET architecture.Fiori G., Iannaccone G., \\"Ultralow-Voltage Bilayer graphene tunnel FET\\", IEEE Electr. Dev. Lett., 30, 1096 (2009) In February 2010, researchers announced graphene transistors with an on-off rate of 100 gigahertz, far exceeding the rates of prior attempts, and exceeding the speed of silicon transistors with an equal gate length. The devices were made with conventional silicon-manufacturing equipment. According to a January 2010 report, graphene was epitaxially grown on SiC in a quantity and with quality suitable for mass production of integrated circuits. At high temperatures, the quantum Hall effect could be measured in these samples. IBM built 'processors' using 100 GHz transistors on graphene sheets. In June 2011, IBM researchers announced that they had succeeded in creating the first graphene-based integrated circuit, a broadband radio mixer. The circuit handled frequencies up to 10 GHz. Its performance was unaffected by temperatures up to 127 ¬∞C. In November researchers used 3d printing (additive manufacturing) as a method for fabricating graphene devices. In 2013, researchers demonstrated graphene's high mobility in a detector that allows broad band frequency selectivity ranging from the THz to IR region (0.76‚Äì33 THz) A separate group created a terahertz-speed transistor with bistable characteristics, which means that the device can spontaneously switch between two electronic states. The device consists of two layers of graphene separated by an insulating layer of boron nitride a few atomic layers thick. Electrons move through this barrier by quantum tunneling. These new transistors exhibit negative differential conductance, whereby the same electric current flows at two different applied voltages. In June, an 8 transistor 1.28 GHz ring oscillator circuit was described. The negative differential resistance experimentally observed in graphene field- effect transistors of conventional design allows for construction of viable non-Boolean computational architectures with graphene. The negative differential resistance‚Äîobserved under certain biasing schemes‚Äîis an intrinsic property of graphene resulting from its symmetric band structure. The results present a conceptual change in graphene research and indicate an alternative route for graphene's applications in information processing. In 2013 researchers created transistors printed on flexible plastic that operate at 25 gigahertz, sufficient for communications circuits and that can be fabricated at scale. The researchers first fabricated non-graphene-containing structures‚Äîthe electrodes and gates‚Äîon plastic sheets. Separately, they grew large graphene sheets on metal, then peeled it and transferred it to the plastic. Finally, they topped the sheet with a waterproof layer. The devices work after being soaked in water, and are flexible enough to be folded. In 2015 researchers devised a digital switch by perforating a graphene sheet with boron-nitride nanotubes that exhibited a switching ratio of 105 at a turn-on voltage of 0.5 V. Density functional theory suggested that the behavior came from the mismatch of the density of states.  Trilayer  An electric field can change trilayer graphene's crystal structure, transforming its behavior from metal-like into semiconductor-like. A sharp metal scanning tunneling microscopy tip was able to move the domain border between the upper and lower graphene configurations. One side of the material behaves as a metal, while the other side behaves as a semiconductor. Trilayer graphene can be stacked in either Bernal or rhombohedral configurations, which can exist in a single flake. The two domains are separated by a precise boundary at which the middle layer is strained to accommodate the transition from one stacking pattern to the other. Silicon transistors function as either p-type or n-type semiconductors, whereas graphene could operate as both. This lowers costs and is more versatile. The technique provides the basis for a field-effect transistor. Scalable manufacturing techniques have yet to be developed. In trilayer graphene, the two stacking configurations exhibit very different electronic properties. The region between them consists of a localized strain soliton where the carbon atoms of one graphene layer shift by the carbon‚Äìcarbon bond distance. The free-energy difference between the two stacking configurations scales quadratically with electric field, favoring rhombohedral stacking as the electric field increases. This ability to control the stacking order opens the way to new devices that combine structural and electrical properties. Graphene-based transistors could be much thinner than modern silicon devices, allowing faster and smaller configurations. = Transparent conducting electrodes = Graphene's high electrical conductivity and high optical transparency make it a candidate for transparent conducting electrodes, required for such applications as touchscreens, liquid crystal displays, inorganic photovoltaics cells, organic photovoltaic cells, and organic light-emitting diodes. In particular, graphene's mechanical strength and flexibility are advantageous compared to indium tin oxide, which is brittle. Graphene films may be deposited from solution over large areas. Large-area, continuous, transparent and highly conducting few-layered graphene films were produced by chemical vapor deposition and used as anodes for application in photovoltaic devices. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 1.7% was demonstrated, which is 55.2% of the PCE of a control device based on indium tin oxide. However, the main disadvantage brought by the fabrication method will be the poor substrate bondings that will eventually lead to poor cyclic stability and cause high resistivity to the electrodes. Organic light- emitting diodes (OLEDs) with graphene anodes have been demonstrated. The device was formed by solution-processed graphene on a quartz substrate. The electronic and optical performance of graphene-based devices are similar to devices made with indium tin oxide. In 2017 OLED electrodes were produced by CVD on a copper substrate. A carbon-based device called a light-emitting electrochemical cell (LEC) was demonstrated with chemically-derived graphene as the cathode and the conductive polymer Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) as the anode. Unlike its predecessors, this device contains only carbon-based electrodes, with no metal. In 2014 a prototype graphene-based flexible display was demonstrated. In 2016 researchers demonstrated a display that used interferometry modulation to control colors, dubbed a \\"graphene balloon device\\" made of silicon containing 10 Œºm circular cavities covered by two graphene sheets. The degree of curvature of the sheets above each cavity defines the color emitted. The device exploits the phenomena known as Newton's rings created by interference between light waves bouncing off the bottom of the cavity and the (transparent) material. Increasing the distance between the silicon and the membrane increased the wavelength of the light. The approach is used in colored e-reader displays and smartwatches, such as the Qualcomm Toq. They use silicon materials instead of graphene. Graphene reduces power requirements. = Frequency multiplier = In 2009, researchers built experimental graphene frequency multipliers that take an incoming signal of a certain frequency and output a signal at a multiple of that frequency. = Optoelectronics = Graphene strongly interacts with photons, with the potential for direct band-gap creation. This is promising for optoelectronic and nanophotonic devices. Light interaction arises due to the Van Hove singularity. Graphene displays different time scales in response to photon interaction, ranging from femtoseconds (ultra-fast) to picoseconds. Potential uses include transparent films, touch screens and light emitters or as a plasmonic device that confines light and alters wavelengths. = Hall effect sensors = Due to extremely high electron mobility, graphene may be used for production of highly sensitive Hall effect sensors. Potential application of such sensors is connected with DC current transformers for special applications. New record high sensitive Hall sensors are reported in April 2015. These sensors are two times better than existing Si based sensors. = Quantum dots = Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) keep all dimensions less than 10 nm. Their size and edge crystallography govern their electrical, magnetic, optical, and chemical properties. GQDs can be produced via graphite nanotomy or via bottom-up, solution-based routes (Diels-Alder, cyclotrimerization and/or cyclodehydrogenation reactions). GQDs with controlled structure can be incorporated into applications in electronics, optoelectronics and electromagnetics. Quantum confinement can be created by changing the width of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) at selected points along the ribbon. It is studied as a catalyst for fuel cells. = Organic electronics = A semiconducting polymer (poly(3-hexylthiophene) placed on top of single-layer graphene vertically conducts electric charge better than on a thin layer of silicon. A 50 nm thick polymer film conducted charge about 50 times better than a 10 nm thick film, potentially because the former consists of a mosaic of variably- oriented crystallites forms a continuous pathway of interconnected crystals. In a thin film or on silicon, plate-like crystallites are oriented parallel to the graphene layer. Uses include solar cells. = Spintronics = Large-area graphene created by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and layered on a SiO2 substrate, can preserve electron spin over an extended period and communicate it. Spintronics varies electron spin rather than current flow. The spin signal is preserved in graphene channels that are up to 16 micrometers long over a nanosecond. Pure spin transport and precession extended over 16 Œºm channel lengths with a spin lifetime of 1.2 ns and a spin diffusion length of ‚âà6 Œºm at room temperature. Spintronics is used in disk drives for data storage and in magnetic random-access memory. Electronic spin is generally short-lived and fragile, but the spin-based information in current devices needs to travel only a few nanometers. However, in processors, the information must cross several tens of micrometers with aligned spins. Graphene is the only known candidate for such behavior. = Conductive ink = In 2012 Vorbeck Materials started shipping the Siren anti-theft packaging device, which uses their graphene-based Vor-Ink circuitry to replace the metal antenna and external wiring to an RFID chip. This was the world's first commercially available product based on graphene.  Light processing  = Optical modulator = When the Fermi level of graphene is tuned, its optical absorption can be changed. In 2011, researchers reported the first graphene-based optical modulator. Operating at without a temperature controller, this modulator has a broad bandwidth (from 1.3 to 1.6 Œºm) and small footprint (~). A Mach-Zehnder modulator based on a hybrid graphene-silicon waveguide has been demonstrated recently, which can process signals nearly chirp-free. An extinction up to 34.7 dB and a minimum chirp parameter of -0.006 are obtained. Its insertion loss is roughly -1.37 dB. = Ultraviolet lens = A hyperlens is a real-time super-resolution lens that can transform evanescent waves into propagating waves and thus break the diffraction limit. In 2016 a hyperlens based on dielectric layered graphene and h-boron nitride (h-BN) can surpass metal designs. Based on its anisotropic properties, flat and cylindrical hyperlenses were numerically verified with layered graphene at 1200 THz and layered h-BN at 1400 THz, respectively. In 2016 a 1-nm thick graphene microlens that can image objects the size of a single bacterium. The lens was created by spraying a sheet of graphene oxide solution, then molding the lens using a laser beam. It can resolve objects as small as 200 nanometers, and see into the near infrared. It breaks the diffraction limit and achieve a focal length less than half the wavelength of light. Possible applications include thermal imaging for mobile phones, endoscopes, nanosatellites and photonic chips in supercomputers and superfast broadband distribution. = Infrared light detection = Graphene reacts to the infrared spectrum at room temperature, albeit with sensitivity 100 to 1000 times too low for practical applications. However, two graphene layers separated by an insulator allowed an electric field produced by holes left by photo-freed electrons in one layer to affect a current running through the other layer. The process produces little heat, making it suitable for use in night-vision optics. The sandwich is thin enough to be integrated in handheld devices, eyeglass-mounted computers and even contact lenses. = Photodetector = A graphene/n-type silicon heterojunction has been demonstrated to exhibit strong rectifying behavior and high photoresponsivity. By introducing a thin interfacial oxide layer, the dark current of graphene/n-Si heterojunction has been reduced by two orders of magnitude at zero bias. At room temperature, the graphene/n-Si photodetector with interfacial oxide exhibits a specific detectivity up to 5.77 √ó 1013 cm Hz1/2 W2 at the peak wavelength of 890 nm in vacuum. In addition, the improved graphene/n-Si heterojunction photodetectors possess high responsivity of 0.73 A W‚àí1 and high photo-to-dark current ratio of ‚âà107. These results demonstrate that graphene/Si heterojunction with interfacial oxide is promising for the development of high detectivity photodetectors. Recently, a graphene/si Schottky photodetector with record-fast response speed (< 25 ns) from wavelength 350 nm to 1100 nm are presented. The photodetectors exhibit excellent long-term stability even stored in air for more than 2 years. These results not only advance the development of high-performance photodetectors based on the graphene/Si Schottky junction, but also have important implications for mass-production of graphene-based photodetector array devices for cost-effective environmental monitoring, medical images, free-space communications, photoelectric smart-tracking, and integration with CMOS circuits for emerging interest-of-things applications, etc.  Energy  = Generation =  Ethanol distillation  Graphene oxide membranes allow water vapor to pass through, but are impermeable to other liquids and gases. This phenomenon has been used for further distilling of vodka to higher alcohol concentrations, in a room-temperature laboratory, without the application of heat or vacuum as used in traditional distillation methods.  Solar cells  = Charge conductor = Graphene solar cells use graphene's unique combination of high electrical conductivity and optical transparency.Research Hints at Graphene‚Äôs Photovoltaic Potential, Newly observed properties mean graphene could be a highly efficient converter of light to electric power, by Mike Orcutt, MIT. March 1, 2013. This material absorbs only 2.6% of green light and 2.3% of red light. Graphene can be assembled into a film electrode with low roughness. These films must be made thicker than one atomic layer to obtain useful sheet resistances. This added resistance can be offset by incorporating conductive filler materials, such as a silica matrix. Reduced conductivity can be offset by attaching large aromatic molecules such as pyrene-1-sulfonic acid sodium salt (PyS) and the disodium salt of 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic diimide bisbenzenesulfonic acid (PDI). These molecules, under high temperatures, facilitate better œÄ-conjugation of the graphene basal plane. = Light collector = Using graphene as a photoactive material requires its bandgap to be 1.4‚Äì1.9 eV. In 2010, single cell efficiencies of nanostructured graphene-based PVs of over 12% were achieved. According to P. Mukhopadhyay and R. K. Gupta organic photovoltaics could be \\"devices in which semiconducting graphene is used as the photoactive material and metallic graphene is used as the conductive electrodes\\". In 2008, chemical vapor deposition produced graphene sheets by depositing a graphene film made from methane gas on a nickel plate. A protective layer of thermoplastic is laid over the graphene layer and the nickel underneath is then dissolved in an acid bath. The final step is to attach the plastic-coated graphene to a flexible polymer sheet, which can then be incorporated into a PV cell. Graphene/polymer sheets range in size up to 150 square centimeters and can be used to create dense arrays. Silicon generates only one current-driving electron for each photon it absorbs, while graphene can produce multiple electrons. Solar cells made with graphene could offer 60% conversion efficiency.inhabitat.com cooperating with ICFO (Institute of Photonic Sciences)(2013-04-03)  Electrode  In 2010, researchers first reported creating a graphene-silicon heterojunction solar cell, where graphene served as a transparent electrode and introduced a built- in electric field near the interface between the graphene and n-type silicon to help collect charge carriers. In 2012 researchers reported efficiency of 8.6% for a prototype consisting of a silicon wafer coated with trifluoromethanesulfonyl-amide (TFSA) doped graphene. Doping increased efficiency to 9.6% in 2013. In 2015 researchers reported efficiency of 15.6% by choosing the optimal oxide thickness on the silicon. This combination of carbon materials with traditional silicon semiconductors to fabricate solar cells has been a promising field of carbon science. In 2013, another team reported 15.6% percent by combining titanium oxide and graphene as a charge collector and perovskite as a sunlight absorber. The device is manufacturable at temperatures under using solution-based deposition. This lowers production costs and offers the potential using flexible plastics. In 2015, researchers developed a prototype cell that used semitransparent perovskite with graphene electrodes. The design allowed light to be absorbed from both sides. It offered efficiency of around 12 percent with estimated production costs of less than $0.06/watt. The graphene was coated with PEDOT:PSS conductive polymer (polythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate). Multilayering graphene via CVD created transparent electrodes reducing sheet resistance. Performance was further improved by increasing contact between the top electrodes and the hole transport layer.  Fuel cells  Appropriately perforated graphene (and hexagonal boron nitride hBN) can allow protons to pass through it, offering the potential for using graphene monolayers as a barrier that blocks hydrogen atoms but not protons/ionized hydrogen (hydrogen atoms with their electrons stripped off). They could even be used to extract hydrogen gas out of the atmosphere that could power electric generators with ambient air. The membranes are more effective at elevated temperatures and when covered with catalytic nanoparticles such as platinum. Graphene could solve a major problem for fuel cells: fuel crossover that reduces efficiency and durability. In methanol fuel cells, graphene used as a barrier layer in the membrane area, has reduced fuel cross over with negligible proton resistance, improving the performance. At room temperature, proton conductivity with monolayer hBN, outperforms graphene, with resistivity to proton flow of about 10 Œ© cm2 and a low activation energy of about 0.3 electronvolts. At higher temperatures, graphene outperforms with resistivity estimated to fall below 10‚àí3 Œ© cm2 above 250 degrees Celsius. In another project, protons easily pass through slightly imperfect graphene membranes on fused silica in water. The membrane was exposed to cycles of high and low pH. Protons transferred reversibly from the aqueous phase through the graphene to the other side where they undergo acid‚Äìbase chemistry with silica hydroxyl groups. Computer simulations indicated energy barriers of 0.61‚Äì0.75 eV for hydroxyl-terminated atomic defects that participate in a Grotthuss-type relay, while pyrylium-like ether terminations did not. Recently, Paul and co-workers at IISER Bhopal demonstrated solid state proton conduction for oxygen functionalized few-layer graphene (8.7x10‚àí3 S/cm) with a low activation barrier (0.25 eV).  Thermoelectrics  Adding 0.6% graphene to a mixture of lanthanum and partly reduced strontium titanium oxide produces a strong Seebeck at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 750 ¬∞C (compared to 500‚Äì750 without graphene). The material converts 5% of the heat into electricity (compared to 1% for strontium titanium oxide.)  Condenser coating  In 2015 a graphene coating on steam condensers quadrupled condensation efficiency, increasing overall plant efficiency by 2‚Äì3 percent. = Storage =  Supercapacitor  Due to graphene's high surface-area- to-mass ratio, one potential application is in the conductive plates of supercapacitors. In February 2013 researchers announced a novel technique to produce graphene supercapacitors based on the DVD burner reduction approach. In 2014 a supercapacitor was announced that was claimed to achieve energy density comparable to current lithium-ion batteries. In 2015 the technique was adapted to produce stacked, 3-D supercapacitors. Laser-induced graphene was produced on both sides of a polymer sheet. The sections were then stacked, separated by solid electrolytes, making multiple microsupercapacitors. The stacked configuration substantially increased the energy density of the result. In testing, the researchers charged and discharged the devices for thousands of cycles with almost no loss of capacitance. The resulting devices were mechanically flexible, surviving 8,000 bending cycles. This makes them potentially suitable for rolling in a cylindrical configuration. Solid-state polymeric electrolyte-based devices exhibit areal capacitance of >9 mF/cm2 at a current density of 0.02 mA/cm2, over twice that of conventional aqueous electrolytes. Also in 2015 another project announced a microsupercapacitor that is small enough to fit in wearable or implantable devices. Just one-fifth the thickness of a sheet of paper, it is capable of holding more than twice as much charge as a comparable thin-film lithium battery. The design employed laser-scribed graphene, or LSG with manganese dioxide. They can be fabricated without extreme temperatures or expensive ‚Äúdry rooms‚Äù. Their capacity is six times that of commercially available supercapacitors. The device reached volumetric capacitance of over 1,100 F/cm3. This corresponds to a specific capacitance of the constituent MnO2 of 1,145 F/g, close to the theoretical maximum of 1,380 F/g. Energy density varies between 22 and 42 Wh/l depending on device configuration. In May 2015 a boric acid-infused, laser-induced graphene supercapacitor tripled its areal energy density and increased its volumetric energy density 5-10 fold. The new devices proved stable over 12,000 charge-discharge cycles, retaining 90 percent of their capacitance. In stress tests, they survived 8,000 bending cycles.  Batteries  Silicon- graphene anode lithium ion batteries were demonstrated in 2012. Stable Lithium ion cycling was demonstrated in bi- and few layer graphene films grown on nickel substrates, while single layer graphene films have been demonstrated as a protective layer against corrosion in battery components such as the battery case. This creates possibilities for flexible electrodes for microscale Li-ion batteries, where the anode acts as the active material and the current collector. Researchers built a lithium-ion battery made of graphene and silicon, which was claimed to last over a week on one charge and took only 15 minutes to charge.5 Ways Graphene Will Change Gadgets Forever, Laptop, 14 April 2014, Michael Andronico In 2015 argon-ion based plasma processing was used to bombard graphene samples with argon ions. That knocked out some carbon atoms and increased the capacitance of the materials three-fold. These ‚Äúarmchair‚Äù and ‚Äúzigzag‚Äù defects are named based on the configurations of the carbon atoms that surround the holes. In 2016, Huawei announced graphene-assisted Lithium-Ion batteries with greater heat tolerance and twice the life span of traditional Lithium-Ion batteries, the component with the shortest life span in mobile phones.  Sensors  = Biosensors = Graphene does not oxidize in air or in biological fluids, making it an attractive material for use as a biosensor. A graphene circuit can be configured as a field effect biosensor by applying biological capture molecules and blocking layers to the graphene, then controlling the voltage difference between the graphene and the liquid that includes the biological test sample. Of the various types of graphene sensors that can be made, biosensors were the first to be available for sale. = Pressure sensors = The electronic properties of graphene/h-BN heterostructures can be modulated by changing the interlayer distances via applying external pressure, leading to potential realization of atomic thin pressure sensors. In 2011 researchers proposed an in-plane pressure sensor consisting of graphene sandwiched between hexagonal boron nitride and a tunneling pressure sensor consisting of h-BN sandwiched by graphene. The current varies by 3 orders of magnitude as pressure increases from 0 to 5 nN/nm¬≤. This structure is insensitive to the number of wrapping h-BN layers, simplifying process control. Because h-BN and graphene are inert to high temperature, the device could support ultra-thin pressure sensors for application under extreme conditions. In 2016 researchers demonstrated a biocompatible pressure sensor made from mixing graphene flakes with cross- linked polysilicone (found in silly putty). = NEMS = Nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) can be designed and characterized by understanding the interaction and coupling between the mechanical, electrical, and the van der Waals energy domains. Quantum mechanical limit governed by Heisenberg uncertainty relation decides the ultimate precision of nanomechanical systems. Quantum squeezing can improve the precision by reducing quantum fluctuations in one desired amplitude of the two quadrature amplitudes. Traditional NEMS hardly achieve quantum squeezing due to their thickness limits. A scheme to obtain squeezed quantum states through typical experimental graphene NEMS structures taking advantages of its atomic scale thickness has been proposed. = Molecular absorption = Theoretically graphene makes an excellent sensor due to its 2D structure. The fact that its entire volume is exposed to its surrounding environment makes it very efficient to detect adsorbed molecules. However, similar to carbon nanotubes, graphene has no dangling bonds on its surface. Gaseous molecules cannot be readily adsorbed onto graphene surfaces, so intrinsically graphene is insensitive. The sensitivity of graphene chemical gas sensors can be dramatically enhanced by functionalization, for example, coating the film with a thin layer of certain polymers. The thin polymer layer acts like a concentrator that absorbs gaseous molecules. The molecule absorption introduces a local change in electrical resistance of graphene sensors. While this effect occurs in other materials, graphene is superior due to its high electrical conductivity (even when few carriers are present) and low noise, which makes this change in resistance detectable. = Piezoelectric effect = Density functional theory simulations predict that depositing certain adatoms on graphene can render it piezoelectrically responsive to an electric field applied in the out-of-plane direction. This type of locally engineered piezoelectricity is similar in magnitude to that of bulk piezoelectric materials and makes graphene a candidate for control and sensing in nanoscale devices. = Body motion = Promoted by the demand for wearable devices, graphene has been proved to be a promising material for potential applications in flexible and highly sensitive strain sensors. An environment-friendly and cost- effective method to fabricate large-area ultrathin graphene films is proposed for highly sensitive flexible strain sensor. The assembled graphene films are derived rapidly at the liquid/air interface by Marangoni effect and the area can be scaled up. These graphene-based strain sensors exhibit extremely high sensitivity with gauge factor of 1037 at 2% strain, which represents the highest value for graphene platelets at this small deformation so far. Rubber bands infused with graphene (\\"G-bands\\") can be used as inexpensive body sensors. The bands remain pliable and can be used as a sensor to measure breathing, heart rate, or movement. Lightweight sensor suits for vulnerable patients could make it possible to remotely monitor subtle movement. These sensors display -fold increases in resistance and work at strains exceeding 800%. Gauge factors of up to 35 were observed. Such sensors can function at vibration frequencies of at least 160 Hz. At 60 Hz, strains of at least 6% at strain rates exceeding 6000%/s can be monitored. = Magnetic = In 2015 researchers announced a graphene-based magnetic sensor 100 times more sensitive than an equivalent device based on silicon (7,000 volts per amp- tesla). The sensor substrate was hexagonal boron nitride. The sensors were based on the Hall effect, in which a magnetic field induces a Lorentz force on moving electric charge carriers, leading to deflection and a measurable Hall voltage. In the worst case graphene roughly matched a best case silicon design. In the best case graphene required lower source current and power requirements.  Environmental  = Contaminant removal = Graphene oxide is non-toxic and biodegradable. Its surface is covered with epoxy, hydroxyl, and carboxyl groups that interact with cations and anions. It is soluble in water and forms stable colloid suspensions in other liquids because it is amphiphilic (able to mix with water or oil). Dispersed in liquids it shows excellent sorption capacities. It can remove copper, cobalt, cadmium, arsenate, and organic solvents. = Water filtration = Research suggests that graphene filters could outperform other techniques of desalination by a significant margin. = Permeation barrier = Instead of allowing the permeation, blocking is also necessary. Gas permeation barriers are important for almost all applications ranging from food, pharmaceutical, medical, inorganic and organic electronic devices, etc. packaging. It extends the life of the product and allows keeping the total thickness of devices small. Being atomically thin, defectless graphene is impermeable to all gases. In particular, ultra-thin moisture permeation barrier layers based on graphene are shown to be important for organic-FETs and OLEDs. Graphene barrier applications in biological sciences are under study.  Other  = Plasmonics and metamaterials = Graphene accommodates a plasmonic surface mode, observed recently via near field infrared optical microscopy techniques and infrared spectroscopy Potential applications are in the terahertz to mid- infrared frequencies, such as terahertz and midinfrared light modulators, passive terahertz filters, mid-infrared photodetectors and biosensors. = Lubricant = Scientists discovered using graphene as a lubricant works better than traditionally used graphite. A one atom thick layer of graphene in between a steel ball and steel disc lasted for 6,500 cycles. Conventional lubricants lasted 1,000 cycles.Graphene proves a long-lasting lubricant, Phys.org, 14 October 2014, Jared Sagoff = Radio wave absorption = Stacked graphene layers on a quartz substrate increased the absorption of millimeter (radio) waves by 90 per cent over 125‚Äì165 GHz bandwidth, extensible to microwave and low-terahertz frequencies, while remaining transparent to visible light. For example, graphene could be used as a coating for buildings or windows to block radio waves. Absorption is a result of mutually coupled Fabry‚ÄìPerot resonators represented by each graphene-quartz substrate. A repeated transfer-and-etch process was used to control surface resistivity. = Redox = Graphene oxide can be reversibly reduced and oxidized via electrical stimulus. Controlled reduction and oxidation in two-terminal devices containing multilayer graphene oxide films are shown to result in switching between partly reduced graphene oxide and graphene, a process that modifies electronic and optical properties. Oxidation and reduction are related to resistive switching. = Nanoantennas = A graphene-based plasmonic nano-antenna (GPN) can operate efficiently at millimeter radio wavelengths. The wavelength of surface plasmon polaritons for a given frequency is several hundred times smaller than the wavelength of freely propagating electromagnetic waves of the same frequency. These speed and size differences enable efficient graphene-based antennas to be far smaller than conventional alternatives. The latter operate at frequencies 100‚Äì1000 times larger than GPNs, producing 0.01‚Äì0.001 as many photons. An electromagnetic (EM) wave directed vertically onto a graphene surface excites the graphene into oscillations that interact with those in the dielectric on which the graphene is mounted, thereby forming surface plasmon polaritons (SPP). When the antenna becomes resonant (an integral number of SPP wavelengths fit into the physical dimensions of the graphene), the SPP/EM coupling increases greatly, efficiently transferring energy between the two. A phased array antenna 100 ¬µm in diameter could produce 300 GHz beams only a few degrees in diameter, instead of the 180 degree radiation from tsa conventional metal antenna of that size. Potential uses include smart dust, low-power terabit wireless networks and photonics. A nanoscale gold rod antenna captured and transformed EM energy into graphene plasmons, analogous to a radio antenna converting radio waves into electromagnetic waves in a metal cable. The plasmon wavefronts can be directly controlled by adjusting antenna geometry. The waves were focused (by curving the antenna) and refracted (by a prism- shaped graphene bilayer because the conductivity in the two-atom-thick prism is larger than in the surrounding one-atom-thick layer.) The plasmonic metal- graphene nanoantenna was composed by inserting a few nanometers of oxide between a dipole gold nanorod and the monolayer graphene. The used oxide layer here can reduce the quantum tunelling effect between graphene and metal antenna. With tuning the chemical potential of the graphene layer through field effect transistor architecture, the in-phase and out-phase mode coupling between graphene palsmonics and metal plasmonics is realized. The tunable properties of the plasmonic metal-graphene nanoantenna can be switched on and off via modifying the electrostatic gate-voltage on graphene. = Sound transducers = Graphene's light weight provides relatively good frequency response, suggesting uses in electrostatic audio speakers and microphones., full paper on arxiv.org In 2015 an ultrasonic microphone and speaker were demonstrated that could operate at frequencies from 20 Hz‚Äì500 kHz. The speaker operated at a claimed 99% efficiency with a flat frequency response across the audible range. One application was as a radio replacement for long-distance communications, given sound's ability to penetrate steel and water, unlike radio waves. = Waterproof coating = Graphene could potentially usher in a new generation of waterproof devices whose chassis may not need to be sealed like today's devices. = Coolant additive = Graphene's high thermal conductivity suggests that it could be used as an additive in coolants. Preliminary research work showed that 5% graphene by volume can enhance the thermal conductivity of a base fluid by 86%. Another application due to graphene's enhanced thermal conductivity was found in PCR. = Reference material = Graphene's properties suggest it as a reference material for characterizing electroconductive and transparent materials. One layer of graphene absorbs 2.3% of red light. This property was used to define the conductivity of transparency that combines sheet resistance and transparency. This parameter was used to compare materials without the use of two independent parameters. = Thermal management = In 2011, researchers reported that a three-dimensional, vertically aligned, functionalized multilayer graphene architecture can be an approach for graphene-based thermal interfacial materials (TIMs) with superior thermal conductivity and ultra-low interfacial thermal resistance between graphene and metal. Graphene-metal composites can be used in thermal interface materials. Adding a layer of graphene to each side of a copper film increased the metal's heat-conducting properties up to 24%. This suggests the possibility of using them for semiconductor interconnects in computer chips. The improvement is the result of changes in copper's nano- and microstructure, not from graphene's independent action as an added heat conducting channel. High temperature chemical vapor deposition stimulates grain size growth in copper films. The larger grain sizes improve heat conduction. The heat conduction improvement was more pronounced in thinner copper films, which is useful as copper interconnects shrink. Attaching graphene functionalized with silane molecules increases its thermal conductivity (Œ∫) by 15‚Äì56% with respect to the number density of molecules. This is because of enhanced in-plane heat conduction resulting from the simultaneous increase of thermal resistance between the graphene and the substrate, which limited cross-plane phonon scattering. Heat spreading ability doubled. However, mismatches at the boundary between horizontally adjacent crystals reduces heat transfer by a factor of 10. = Structural material = Graphene's strength, stiffness and lightness suggested it for use with carbon fiber. Graphene has been used as a reinforcing agent to improve the mechanical properties of biodegradable polymeric nanocomposites for engineering bone tissue. = Catalyst = In 2014, researchers at the University of Western Australia discovered nano sized fragments of graphene can speed up the rate of chemical reactions.Research unlocks potential of super-compound, Phys.org, 22 October 2014, David Stacey In 2015, researchers announced an atomic scale catalyst made of graphene doped with nitrogen and augmented with small amounts of cobalt whose onset voltage was comparable to platinum catalysts. In 2016 iron-nitrogen complexes embedded in graphene were reported as another form of catalyst. The new material was claimed to approach the efficiency of platinum catalysts. The approach eliminated the need for less efficient iron nanoparticles. = Aviation = In 2016, researchers developed a prototype de-icing system that incorporated unzipped carbon nanotube graphene nanoribbons in an epoxy/graphene composite. In laboratory tests, the leading edge of a helicopter rotor blade was coated with the composite, covered by a protective metal sleeve. Applying an electrical current heated the composite to over 200 ¬∞F (93 ¬∞C), melting a 1 cm (0.4 in)-thick ice layer with ambient temperatures of a -4 ¬∞F (-20 ¬∞C).

It joined the National Health Service as the Northwood, Pinner and District Hospital in 1948. At the end of 1983 it was the site of a workers occupation aiming to keep the hospital open. This was followed by a successful Judicial Review of the decision by Hillingdon District Health Authority to close it The hospital closed in 2008 after the Hillingdon Primary Care Trust stated it had become too costly to maintain. In 2010 the trust announced the hospital would remain empty for another four years while funding was used to improve services in other areas of the London Borough of Hillingdon. In 2011 the trust said the hospital could remain closed for a further ten years. A potential option of selling the hospital by September 2012 was referred to in the minutes of a budget meeting of NHS Hillingdon.

However, operating a brothel and procuring are both illegal in Macau, with the latter punishable by a maximum jail sentence of 8 years. Street prostitution is illegal but sex work in a massage parlor is considered to be de facto legal. The city has a large sex trade despite there being no official red-light district. In addition to street prostitution, prostitutes work in low-rent buildings, massage parlours and illegal brothels, and the casinos, nightclubs, saunas and some of the larger hotels. Most hotels, however, have suspected prostitutes removed from the premises. Many of the city's sidewalks and underpasses are littered with prostitutes' calling cards. Macau's economy is based largely on tourism with significant input from gambling casinos, drugs and prostitution which has led to the city being called a Sin City. As the Macau administration relies heavily on taxes from prostitution and gambling, the authorities have traditionally been reluctant to reduce the size of the sex industry. The trade is said to be controlled by Chinese organized crime groups with different gangs made up of people from different provinces in China, a system which has led to violent clashes.  History  Prostitution was recorded in Macau during the 19th and 20th centuries. In the nineteenth century, in addition to conventional brothels, Macau had floating brothels known as \\"flower boats\\" which serviced foreign ships. After 1851 prostitution was regulated, and in the 1930s the government attempted to end the exploitation and abuse of prostitutes. In the late 1930s there were 120 brothels in the city with 1500 prostitutes. In the 1990s there were reports alleging that Chinese triad members were arranging marriages of convenience with Portuguese prostitutes in order to secure Portuguese citizenship. In early 2015 there were tabloid reports of popular Japanese pornographic film actresses coming to Macau to work as prostitutes; their clients were said to be rich Chinese men. A subsequent Chinese national anti-corruption drive has reduced prostitution- related advertising and increased the number of inspections of illegal brothels. Some underground brothels have been shut down and over 100 people were arrested in connection with criminal involvement in prostitution at a Macau hotel.  Sex trafficking  Syndicates from China are said to lure women from mainland China to work as prostitutes in Macau with false advertisements for casino jobs, work as dancers, or other types of legitimate employment. There are also allegations that women are trafficked to Macau for prostitution from Mongolia, Russia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Burma, Central Asia and South Africa. A gang bringing South Korean prostitutes to Macau to serve Chinese men was arrested in 2015. According to the United States embassy in Ulaan Bator, estimates of Mongolian sex workers in Macau vary from 200-300 women. Macau has been put on a U.S. State Department watch list for human trafficking, ranked at Tier 2 (territories which do not fully comply with minimum standards in the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 ‚Äúbut are making significant efforts to bring themselves into compliance‚Äù). Human trafficking is illegal in Macau, with a maximum jail sentence of 12 years (15 years if minors are involved). The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Macau as a 'Tier 2 Watch List' territory.

The British European Airways (BEA) aircraft was en route on a scheduled flight from London's Croydon Airport and crashed during approach to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. Three of the five crew members were killed in the accident and all ten passengers survived, though two were seriously injured, the remainder were able to walk away from the crash. The investigation found no faults with the aircraft, but cited a navigation error caused by a combination of insufficient training and shortcomings in the aircraft's low frequency radio range equipment. Flight The accident aircraft was a Douglas C-47A-5-DK Skytrain, c/n 12348 and registered G-AHCS, equipped with two Pratt & Whitney R-1830-92 engines, first flown in 1944, operated by British European Airways. The flight was a scheduled service from BEA's base at Croydon Airport near London to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. Gardermoen acted as Oslo's secondary airport to the more central Oslo Airport, Fornebu. However, BEA opted to use Gardermoen because it needed longer runways to operate the Vickers VC.1 Viking. The aircraft had a crew of five and carried ten passengers. Two of the passengers were Norwegian, the rest were British. Mistberget At 13:44 the radio operator asked air traffic control for permission to land using the low frequency radio range navigation system. Gardermoen confirmed, and noted that the Skytrain was the only aircraft in the area. There was no further radio communication between the aircraft and air traffic control. The aircraft passed the radio range station, located North of the airport and a few minutes later flew into trees on the eastern face of Mistberget at an altitude of . The aircraft plowed a long section of forest before it came to a halt. At the time the aircraft was heading southwards, parallel with the face. The commission concluded that the aircraft was under pilot control at the time of impact. The impact of the accident caused the engines to be knocked off and they slid past the airframe. Debris lay scattered in the area, with a propeller blade found away from the craft. Three of the crew members, the captain, first officer and radio operator, were killed in the collision. Two of the passengers who were unhurt, one British and one Norwegian, walked from the wreck to the farm at Askheim, where they were able to notify about the accident by telephone. A crew of rescue workers were immediately dispatched from Gardermoen. They remained at the site for about four hours; the time was needed to get the steward free from the wreck. He and a passenger were severely injured and were freighted by car to Stensby Hospital. The rest of the passengers were able to walk by themselves and were treated for shock and cuts. Investigation and cause Norway's Ministry of Transport and Communications appointed an investigation commission on the day of the accident. It was led by Major Halle and otherwise consisted of Assistant Chief of Police Skalmerud, Engineer Truls Dahl, Pilot Odd Olsen, Captain Thorleif Eriksen and a representative for British aviation authorities. Their report was published in January 1947. They concluded with that the pilot was in full control of the aircraft and there were no faults with the aircraft, a controlled flight into terrain. The asserted the cause of the accident to improper airmanship, caused by insufficient training in radio range navigation combined with shortcomings in the equipment. At the time of the accident there was a cloud cover of ten-tenths and a cloud base of , giving a visibility of less than . The wind was recorded at . The aircraft's turn, road of engines and impact was heard by a witness. The passengers reported that they did not notice anything unusual until they saw spruce trees rushing past the window. The radio range system had recently been calibrated twice and the commission found nothing wrong with the navigational aids. On the other hand, the aircraft's equipment had been turned to compass instead of antenna. This would have made the beam north of the cone of silence twenty degrees wide instead of four. Although not decisive, it was cited as giving the pilot a disadvantage in navigation. The aircraft's radio range equipment also lacked a marker beacon receiver, due to lack of sufficient parts. This forced the pilots to manually calculate the distance to the beacon. The crew carried out the procedural turn in the right area, but should, according to their route instruction book, have been at no lower an altitude than , thus the aircraft was too low, caused by the let-down being started too early.

The letter was leaked to the press in March 2014. Around a month later, Birmingham City Council claimed that it had received \\"hundreds\\" of allegations of plots similar to those illustrated in the letter, some dating back over 20 years. Tahir Alam, former chairman of the Park View Educational Trust which ran three schools in Birmingham, was alleged to have written a 72-page document for the Muslim Council of Britain in 2007 detailing a blueprint for the \\"Islamisation\\" of secular state schools. This document was, in fact, guidance about the religious needs and practices of Muslim parents and pupils that would facilitate their integration into schools. It was entitled, Towards Greater Understanding: Meeting the Needs of Muslim Pupils in State Schools. Information and Guidance for Schools and is available as an appendix to the Kershaw Report. Its intentions are clearly set out in the introduction where its states, \\"its purpose is to promote greater understanding of the faith, religious and cultural needs of Muslim pupils and how they can be accommodated within schools. It also provides useful information and guidance and features of good practice in meeting those needs.\\" The government's Department for Education initially responded to the scandal with lifetime bans against Alam, along with 14 other teachers, from the teaching profession in 2015. However, the bans against Alam and 13 other teachers were eventually overturned, dropped and/or dismissed in courts between 2016 and 2017. In 2017, the academic scholars Therese O'Toole and John Holmwood, who served as an expert witness in the professional misconduct cases, described the Trojan Horse affair as a \\"false narrative\\" spread by a hostile British press which led to \\"a serious miscarriage of justice\\" against the teachers, drawing comparisons to the Hillsborough affair. The allegations against the teachers were set out in the press and in the Kershaw and Clarke Reports, but the teachers were not able to respond to them as they were placed under confidentiality orders as part of their employment contracts, even after suspension. The first opportunity to put their case would not come until professional misconduct cases were brought against them by the National College of Teaching and Learning (an independent agency of the Department for Education, now replaced by the Teacher Regulation Agency) in October 2015 and dragged on until May 2017 when the case against the senior teachers collapsed because of 'serious improprieties' by the legal team acting for the NCTL. A play about the Trojan Horse Affair and the injustices at its heart by LUNG verbatim theatre group (Helen Monks co-writer, Matt Woodhead co-writer and director) won the Amnesty International Freedom of Expression Award at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in August 2018 and began a national tour in October 2019.  Background Ofsted inspections were undertaken into 21 schools in Birmingham, with the Education Funding Agency (responsible for academy schools) also investigating Park View Education Trust and Oldknow Academy. Ofsted said it had found evidence of an organised campaign to target certain schools by Islamists and that head teachers had been \\"marginalised or forced out of their jobs\\". Golden Hillock School, Nansen Primary School, Park View School ‚Äì all run by the Park View Educational Trust ‚Äì Oldknow Academy and Saltley School were placed in special measures after inspectors found systemic failings including the schools having failed to take adequate steps to safeguard pupils against extremism. Another school investigated, Alston Primary, was already in special measures. A sixth school was labelled inadequate for its poor educational standards and twelve schools were found needing of improvements. Three schools were commended. Ofsted subsequently expanded their investigation into schools in East London, Bradford and Luton over concerns regarding a limited curriculum and pupils' detachment from the wider community. Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw accused Birmingham City Council of a \\"serious failure\\" in supporting schools in protecting children from extremism. Its leader, Sir Albert Bore, said that the Council accepted the Ofsted findings that schools in the city were failing pupils. Birmingham City Council commissioned Ian Kershaw of Northern Education Trust in Newcastle to review the evidence. However, because some of the schools were academies under the responsibility of the Department for Education, the then Secretary of State, Michael Gove, commissioned a separate report by Peter Clarke, the former head of the Metropolitan police's counterterrorism command. The two inquiries shared evidence, with the Kershaw inquiry deferring matters of extremism to the Clarke inquiry. The latter found that there is \\"no evidence to suggest that there is a problem with governance generally\\" nor any \\"evidence of terrorism, radicalisation or violent extremism in the schools of concern in Birmingham,\\" but said that there was \\"evidence that there are a number of people, associated with each other and in positions of influence in schools and governing bodies, who espouse, sympathise with or fail to challenge extremist views,\\" and that there had been \\"co-ordinated, deliberate and sustained\\" attempts \\"by a number of associated individuals, to introduce an intolerant and aggressive Islamic ethos\\" into \\"a few schools in Birmingham.\\" The report found that senior council officials and elected members were apparently aware of these issues, but dealt with them on a case- by-case basis rather than making \\"any serious attempt to see if there was a pattern,\\" though it is not clear whether this was due to \\"community cohesion,\\" an \\"issue of education management,\\" or appeasement. Birmingham City Council imposed a temporary freeze on the appointment of school governors after probes into Operation Trojan Horse were announced. Peter Clarke appeared unaware the schools had a Duty to Promote Community Cohesion, which was assessed as part of Ofsted Inspections. After the Trojan Horse affair, this was replaced by a new Duty to Promote Fundamental British Values. The British Prime Minister, David Cameron, said that \\"protecting our children [was] one of the first duties of government\\" and convened an emergency meeting of the Extremism Taskforce and a ministerial meeting to discuss the affair. He announced proposals to send Ofsted to any school without warning, saying that the schools in question had been able to stage a \\"cover-up' previously. The government terminated its funding arrangement with three of the schools. In the wake of the findings, Michael Gove, the Education Secretary, announced that all schools in the country will have to promote \\"British values\\" of tolerance and fairness and said that teachers will be banned from the profession if they allow extremists into schools. A number of governors and the Muslim Council of Britain dubbed the reaction of authorities to the plot a \\"witch-hunt\\". In protest of the investigations, Tahir Alam and several governors of affected schools resigned. As Holmwood and O'Toole show, neither the Kershaw Report nor the Clarke Report gave any attention to the schools improvement policies of Birmingham City Council or the Department for Education. This had been initiated by Sir Tim Brighouse, who had been Chief Education Officer in Birmingham between 1993 and 2002, and was highly critical of the 2014 Ofsted reports and the subsequent inquiries. This included a special concern with the achievement of Asian heritage pupils, as set out in its ‚ÄòAsian heritage achievement action plan‚Äô of 19 December 2003. Indeed, neither the Kershaw Report, nor the Clarke Report asked the question of how a school could be taken over by governors and teachers. Under the academy schools programme, it could only be done with the active involvement of officials in the local authority (including over the transfer of assets to the new trust) and at the Department for Education and it would require an academically successful school to be the sponsor of 'failing' schools. Neither report addressed this, nor did they report any interviews with those officials and the minutes of the meetings that took place among senior leaders at the various schools. Letter The leaked letter on the plot was reported by media including the BBC on 7 March 2014. The letter was alleged to have been written from Birmingham and sent to a contact in Bradford to expand the operation into that city. Its author described the plan as \\"totally invisible to the naked eye and [allowing] us to operate under the radar\\". In it, responsibility was claimed for installing a new headteacher at four schools in Birmingham, and highlighted 12 others in the city which would be easy targets due to large Muslim attendance and poor inspection reports. It encouraged parents to complain about the school's leadership with false accusations of sex education, forced Christian prayer and mixed physical education, with the aim of obtaining a new leadership of Islamists. The letter described pressure being put on the head teacher at Regents Park school, a school judged to be outstanding and 'planting the seed of her cheating'. The school was one of those identified in the Kershaw and Clarke Reports, but no information about it was provided. The Headteacher and Deputy Headteacher were subsequently found guilty at an NCTL hearing of falisifying SATS tests. The letter also encouraged getting Academy status for successfully infiltrated schools, so as to have a curriculum independent of the Local Education Authority. The letter was alleged to have been written from Birmingham and sent to a contact in Bradford to expand the operation into that city. Its author described the plan as \\"totally invisible to the naked eye and [allowing] us to operate under the radar\\". The Times described the letter as 'a crude forgery', noting that \\"The document appears to show that the conspirators were working to remove a primary school headmistress who was actually dismissed 20 years ago\\".Dominic Kennedy, Greg Hurst and Ruth Gledhill, 'Times discovers that ‚ÄòTrojan horse‚Äô letter is a crude forgery', The Times'\\", 11 March 2014 The Guardian and The Independent both stated that the letter is \\"widely regarded as a fake\\".Richard Adams, Is the Trojan horse row just a witch hunt triggered by a hoax?, The Guardian, 8 June 2014.Richard Garner, Trojan Horse row Q&A;: What is the 'Muslim plot' all about ‚Äì and why is it so important?, The Independent, 8 June 2014. However, both the Kershaw Report and the Clarke Report organised their inquiries in terms of the 5-step plan described in the letter and following the publication of their reports, Birmingham City's education commissioner Sir Mike Tomlinson stated his belief that what the letter described was happening \\"without a shadow of doubt\\". The controversy started with a disclosure by a former teacher from Park View School, who was later named as Michael White. His complaints were published on 24 February 2014, whereas the 'trojan horse' letter was not sent to the press until 2 March 2014. Original allegations On 14 April, the City Council confirmed that it had received over 200 reports from parents and staff at 25 schools in Birmingham. Council leader Sir Albert Bore stated that his council had spoken to authorities in Bradford and Manchester, and said that there are \\"certainly issues in Bradford which have similarities with the issues being spoken about in Birmingham\\". Concerns have also been raised by the National Association of Head Teachers about schools in parts of East London and other \\"large cities around the country\\". Senior Department for Education sources have also been reported as claiming that coordinated attempts to undermine and supplant head teachers have occurred in Bradford, Manchester, and the London boroughs of Waltham Forest and Tower Hamlets. Two anonymous members of staff at Park View School told BBC Radio 4 that school assemblies had praised Anwar al-Awlaki. Although the school describes itself as \\"multi-faith\\", there are claims that the Islamic call to prayer is broadcast to the entire school. A senior teacher told inspectors that the solution to all problems would be a global Caliphate under Sharia law. Michael White, a former teacher at Park View School which was mentioned in the letter, told the BBC that the school's governing board had been \\"taken over by a Muslim sect\\" in 1993. He claims he was pressured to ban sex education and the teaching of non-Muslim religions, and was dismissed in 2003 after he told prospective teachers to question the governors. In May 2014, the BBC reported that Tim Boyes, the former headteacher of Queensbridge School, had written anonymously to Birmingham City Council in 2010 to try to expose Operation Trojan Horse, and in June a former prospective school governor said that he had informed authorities of the conspiracy in 2008. Reverend John Ray, OBE, and ex-head teacher of a school in Pakistan, resigned as a governor of Golden Hillock School after 25 years. He raised concerns about the governance of Golden Hillock 20 years ago stating that the Trojan horse plot \\"reveals something, something that is true.\\" Reverend Ray claimed that in the 1990s, when John Major was Prime Minister, he made the government aware of Islamists from Hizb ut-Tahrir becoming involved at his school. Bhupinder Kondal, principal at Oldknow Academy, stated in July 2014 after the publishing of the reports that she recognised the steps illustrated in the letter and that governors had been trying to undermine her since 2009, although the Local Education Authority would not support her. She also said, \\"It is not just an academy problem, this was happening before we became an academy.\\" Gender segregation and intimidation by governors were alleged at Carlton Bolling College in Bradford In Bradford, teachers reported instances of governors imposing an Islamic ethos. The BBC reported on gender segregation at a state secondary school, Carlton Bolling College, during trips and after-school workshops, as well as boys-only school trips. The school has a largely Muslim governing body. In 2012, head teacher Chris Robinson resigned, having felt that her reputation, integrity and leadership were being questioned by governors. Investigation The Educational Funding Authority, Ofsted and Birmingham City Council agreed to investigate the letter, although West Midlands Police decided that it was not a matter for them. Michael Gove, the Secretary of State for Education, said that \\"wider, more comprehensive action\\" was needed and appointed Peter Clarke, a former senior Metropolitan Police officer and ex-head of the Counter Terrorism Command. to lead the Department for Education analysis of \\"evidence of extremist infiltration in both academies and council-run schools\\" Ofsted investigated in 21 schools in Birmingham in March 2014. The Education Funding Authority conducted a parallel investigation. Ofsted subsequently expanded their investigation into schools in the north and south-east of England. They investigated schools in East London, Bradford and Luton over concerns regarding a limited curriculum and pupils' detachment from the wider community. Birmingham City Council announced an investigation into the allegations, estimated to last six months. Ian Kershaw, Head of Northern Education Trust in Newcastle, was named as its full- time special adviser. In May, Mark Rogers, Birmingham City Council's Chief Executive, had a meeting with head teachers of affected schools. Despite calling for secrecy, a hidden recording was sent to The Daily Telegraph, in which Rogers criticised the approach to the conspiracy by Education Secretary Michael Gove and Chief Schools Inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw. He said that the overview report on the matter could trigger ‚Äúsome kind of bloody firestorm‚Äù and ‚Äúmay well lead to significant structural proposals‚Äù for the city council. Birmingham City Council was already under investigation by Sir Bob Kerslake over problems of governance associated with financial management, looked after children, waste services and issues of equal pay for work of equal value. Kerslake deferred issues of education to the Clarke and Kershaw Reports, but an appendix to his Report provided contextual data on poverty, adult education attainment, unemployment and school performance across comparator cities and for England as a whole. This showed Birmingham to be performing badly on most indicators, but outperforming other cities and the national average for its school results and the proportion of schools graded outstanding. The Kershaw and Clarke Reports provided no data on school performance in Birmingham or of the schools improvement programme which had shaken up schools following Sir Tim Brighouse's appointment. Allegations in full As noted above, governors and teachers accused in the various investigations were given no opportunity to respond to the allegations and the claims made in the various reports were not subject to independent scrutiny until misconduct charges were brought by the NCTL against teachers associated with Park View Education Trust. Of 21 schools investigated by Ofsted, and 14 schools investigated by the Clarke Report, charges were brought against teachers at just 4 schools. Richard Kerbaj and Sian Griffiths, writing in the Sunday Times, reported that over 100 teachers would be charged with professional misconduct. In the event, just 12 teachers were subject to NCTL hearings, in which they were accused of 'undue religious influence', not Islamist extremism. Most of the allegations presented in the Ofsted and EFA reports were not part of the cases against the teachers because they were not believed to be credible by NCTL lawyers. Others were challenged in court before the case against the senior teachers was discontinued. One EFA inspector went on to become educational adviser to Peter Clarke. Her credibility was called into question by the NCTL Panel when discontinuing the case. A detailed discussion of the evidence presented in the NCTL case is provided in chapter 9 of John Holmwood and Therese O'Toole's book on the Trojan Horse affair. =Ofsted and EFA allegations= Investigations by Ofsted and the Education Funding Authority in 21 schools found evidence of an \\"organised campaign to target certain schools\\" by Islamists. Golden Hillock School, Nansen Primary School, Park View Academy - all run by the Park View Educational Trust - Oldknow Academy and Saltley School were placed in special measures after inspectors found systemic failings including the schools having failed to take adequate steps to safeguard pupils against extremism. Another school investigated, Alston Primary, was already in special measures. A sixth school was labelled inadequate for its poor educational standards and twelve schools were found needing of improvements. Three schools were commended. Ofsted expressed concerns about an exclusively Muslim culture in non-faith schools and children not being taught to \\"develop tolerant attitudes towards other faiths\\". The inspections found that head teachers have been \\"marginalised or forced out of their jobs\\". Ofsted found that the curriculum was being narrowed to reflect the \\"personal views of a few governors\\". Teachers reported unfair treatment because of their gender or religious beliefs. Ofsted found a breakdown of trust between governors and staff and that family members had been appointed to unadvertised senior leadership posts Park View Education Trust were found to be in breach of the Education Funding Agreement by failing to promote social cohesion, failing to promote the social, moral, spiritual, and cultural development of pupils, failing to promote balanced political treatment of issues, and failure to comply fully with safeguarding issues concerning criminal records checks. Park View academy had been identified as outstanding in a 2012 Ofsted report, the first school to be inspected under a tougher new inspection regime introduced by then Secretary of State. Michael Gove. Sir Michael Wilshaw, Chief Inspector at Ofsted, had commented at a national conference that, \\"All schools should be like this and there's no reason why they shouldn't be.\\" Park View School At Park View School Ofsted reported that \\"students are not taught citizenship well enough or prepared properly for life in a multi-cultural and diverse society.\\" The EFA inspection found a classroom culture which was not welcoming to non-Muslim pupils. It described a \\"madrassa curriculum\\" and reported that \\"posters were written in Quranic Arabic in most of the classrooms visited. Posters were found in the classrooms encouraging children to begin lessons with a Muslim prayer, one saying: \\"If you do not pray, you are worse than a kafir\\", and staff reported that loudspeakers were set up in the school to broadcast a call to prayer. The few pupils that elected to study a Christianity unit as part of the Religious Studies GCSE course had to \\"teach themselves\\", because the teacher focused on Islamic studies which the majority were studying. The school staff defended the measures stating that the loudspeakers were put up to make announcements in general, not only the Islamic prayer call and that every school in Britain is legally required to provide a collective act of worship, which is usually Christian in nature but in their case was Islamic for which they demanded and received the permission. Year 11 pupils about to sit their GCSEs at the school were instructed to partake in an Islamic fast, taking neither food nor drink, to place them in the right \\"spiritual frame of mind\\" for the exams. Additionally, students were expected to fast during the month of Ramadan. Some staff at the school expressed fear that neither eating nor drinking amid high temperatures during the 18 hours of daylight in the months of June and July would compromise pupils' health and their ability to learn. It was alleged that the sexes were segregated in the classrooms and boys and girls suspected of being too friendly towards each other were disciplined. The Department for Education inspection found the seating arrangements \\"often with boys sitting towards the front of the class and girls at the back or around the sides\\". The annual sports event for boys and girls was scheduled in different days. Girls claimed to have been discriminated against and said some were sent home from a tennis tournament because their dress was too \\"revealing\\". Subjects such as Personal, Social and Health Education, Biology and Sex and Relationships Education were bowdlerised to conform with a conservative Islamic teaching. Pupils studying biology were not taught the section of the syllabus about reproduction and the teacher stated when briefly outlining evolution that \\"this is not what we believe\\". A former staff member said that one teacher had handed out a worksheet stating that women \\"must obey their husbands,\\" and told his class that wives were forbidden from refusing their husbands sex. Pupils and teachers from Park View School denied this version of the story, saying that after this assertion had been raised by a boy during a presentation on sexual education teachers organised an assembly where they explained that \\"marital rape was legally and morally wrong\\". A former teacher at the school reported that the current head teacher, Monzoor Hussain, expressed \\"mind-blowing\\" anti- American views at school assemblies, describing the US as the \\"source of all evil in the world\\". In school assemblies, former staff alleged that a senior teacher frequently praised Anwar al-Awlaki, an al-Qaeda recruiter that had been involved with at least three major terror attacks, and referred to non- Muslims as \\"kuffar\\", an insulting term for \\"infidel\\". The teacher also used school facilities to copy Osama bin Laden DVDs. External speakers were improperly vetted. An extended Islamic assembly for its Year 10 and 11 pupils was arranged with Sheikh Shady al-Suleiman, an extremist preacher who has called on God to \\"destroy the enemies of Islam\\", \\"give victory to all the Mujahideen all over the world\\" and to \\"prepare us for the jihad\\". A teacher from Park View School was reported to the police after he broke into a female pupil's mobile telephone to prove she was having a \\"forbidden\\" relationship with a boy. The 16-year-old girl's phone was confiscated by the teacher during a Sunday event and then taken to a shop for its passcode to be broken, and its contents were then examined by the school. Texts and images of the girl with a boy, a fellow Year 11 pupil at Park View, were used to justify the girl's suspension weeks before her GCSE exams. Golden Hillock School Golden Hillock School in Sparkhill, Birmingham, was put under special measures by Ofsted on 5 June 2014, after being rated \\"inadequate\\" in all categories. The inspection said that \\"too little is done to keep students safe from the risks associated with extremist views\\". The Ofsted report stated that \\"students' understanding of other religions is scant as the religious education curriculum focuses primarily on the study of Islam\\" and said there was a \\"perceived unfairness and lack of transparency\\" over appointments to the school and that female members of staff had felt intimidated. Governors at the school banned any discussions regarding sexual orientation and intimacy. This affected the teaching of English, Art, Religious Education and Personal, Social and Health Education. Staff were prevented from teaching Sex and Relationships Advice freely as well as aspects of Safeguarding and Child Protection. Forced segregation of the genders was observed at Golden Hillock and was mandated in some departmental policy documents. On 9 June 2014, Lord Nash, parliamentary under Secretary of State for schools, wrote to Tahir Alam concerning the OFSTED and EFA reports and outlined the actions required by the school. In August 2014, the Principal Hardeep Saini was replaced by an interim principal. Two other senior teachers have also been suspended. In July 2015, Ofsted stated that Golden Hillock was still inadequate. At the tribunal held in October and November 2015, Mr Saini was accused of advising a teacher who had been arrested for having extreme pornography to throw his mobile phone into the canal to make sure there was no problem. As of September 2015, Golden Hillock School was rebranded Ark Boulton Academy after being taken over by the Ark Academy Chain. Oldknow Academy Ofsted found that a small group of governors were \\"endeavouring to promote a particular and narrow faith-based ideology in what is a maintained and non-faith academy.\\" Staff were afraid to speak out about the significant changes. Ofsted stated that the school had failed to protect students from \\"the risks of radicalisation and extremism\\". The school's curriculum was deemed inadequate because it did not promote tolerance and harmony between different cultural traditions. The Education Funding Agency (EFA) found that the school lacked a balanced and broad curriculum and saw several subjects marginalised. It found that non-Muslim staff were banned from assemblies in which the children were preached at and told that white women were \\"prostitutes\\". Children were urged to join in anti- Christian chants. Exchange visits with nearby churches had been curtailed. The EFA team concluded: \\"We saw evidence that Oldknow academy is acting as a faith school and is not making active efforts to make the academy attractive to all faith denominations including pupils of no faith. Segregation was found in one classroom with girls sitting at the back with their heads covered. The school had spent ¬£50,000 on three subsidised trips to Saudi Arabia so that pupils could visit the cities of Mecca and Medina in what the EFA described as \\"an extravagant use of public funds\\". Pupils and staff stayed in luxury five-star hotels. The contracts for the taxpayer-funded school trips never underwent a formal tender process, and instead a travel firm was used with close links to a current teacher and former director of the school. For three years running non-Muslim pupils and staff were excluded from these trips. Christmas events were cancelled and raffles and tombolas were banned at a recent school fete because they were considered un-Islamic. The summer play was criticised by staff for its \\"use of musical instruments\\" and a teacher was observed covering his ears during his music lesson. Some staff members admonished girls not to partake in school extracurricular visits and activities. Belal Ballali, the spokesman for the Oldknow Academy Parents' Association, was reported to have close links to alleged terrorists. He is also a member of the \\"Educational Activists\\" group of which its leader, Razwan Faraz, says, pursues an \\"Islamising agenda\\" in Birmingham state schools. During the tribunal it emerged that a photo of a white person was shown to students as an example of what Christians look like. Students were also told that it is un-Islamic to have a pet dog. Nansen Primary School Pupils had limited knowledge of any religion apart from Islam. Effective strategies were not in place to deal with extremism and \\"governance, safety, pupils' cultural development, equal opportunities and the teaching of religious education are all inadequate\\". Ofsted found that \\"the governing body has removed some subjects, such as music, from the timetable.\\" Inspectors found that no humanities, arts or music was taught in Year 6 and only \\"limited\\" teaching of these subjects in Year 5. The deputy head of Nansen Primary School, Razwan Faraz, leads a group called the \\"Educational Activists\\" which he says introduces an \\"Islamising agenda\\" in Birmingham state schools. He worked for a charity believed by the US to have links with terrorist organisations. Saltley School and Specialist Science College Ofsted found that the governing body interfered with the running of Saltley School and undermined the work of its senior leaders. It criticised the spending of the school's budget on paying private investigators to investigate the emails of senior staff and paying for meals in restaurants. Olive Tree Primary School The government ordered an inspection of the Olive Tree school following comments by its head, Abdul Qadeer Baksh, that in an ideal Islamic state, homosexuality would be punishable by death. An Ofsted inspection found that the Islamic school, which shares its premises with a mosque, had books in its library with content that had \\"no place in British society\\". The books contained fundamentalist views and promoted executions, stoning and lashing as appropriate punishments. Books available to the children included one which advocated parents hitting children if they did not pray by the age of 10 and another which praised individuals who \\"loved death more than life in their pursuit of righteous and true religion.\\" Additionally, the inspection stated that \\"there are too few books about the world's major religions other than Islam.\\" Senior leaders did not ensure \\"balanced views of the world\\" were taught and that \\"contact with different cultures, faiths and traditions is too limited to promote tolerance and respect for the views, lifestyles and customs of other people.\\" The school was rated \\"inadequate\\".  Laisterdyke Business and Enterprise College  During the inspection at Laisterdyke Business and Enterprise College in Bradford, a mainly Muslim secondary school, pupils were forced to revise for their GCSE exams outside in the street as staff did not want them to have an opportunity to speak to inspectors. After resisting attempts by governors to impose an Islamic ethos, teachers were suspended and its principal, Jennifer McIntosh, and her deputy, faced attempts to oust them. It was alleged by teachers that the governors sought to hire the Trojan Horse \\"ringleader\\" Tahir Alam and model the school on his Park View School in Birmingham. The governors of the school were sacked in April because of inappropriate interference in the running of the school. = Clarke Report = An investigation ordered by the government found a \\"sustained, co-ordinated agenda to impose segregationist attitudes and practices of a hardline, politicised strain of Sunni Islam\\" in several Birmingham schools. However, the report interviewed none of the teachers or governors against whom allegations were made with the single exception of Tahir Alam. It also did not report any intereviews with members of Birmingham Standing Advisory Council on Religious Education (SACRE) responsible for the agreed curriculum on religious education taught in local authority schools in Birmingham, and also responsible for approving deterninations of daily acts of collective worship for other than Christian worship. Nor did Clarke report any interviews with schools improvement officers at the local authority of the Department for Education. Indeed, in presenting his charges, Clarke commented that \\"it is only fair to point out that the Trust disputed most, if not all, of the allegations.\\" The investigation found there to be \\"no evidence to suggest that there is a problem with governance generally\\" nor any \\"evidence of terrorism, radicalisation or violent extremism in the schools of concern in Birmingham,\\" but said there was \\"evidence that there are a number of people, associated with each other and in positions of influence in schools and governing bodies, who espouse, sympathise with or fail to challenge extremist views.\\" It found that a number of governors and senior teachers had been promoting a form of Islamism or Salafism. The report identified the Muslim Council of Britain and the Association of Muslim Schools as organisations \\"[stemming] from an international movement to increase the role of Islam in education\\". This reflects the views of the neo-conservative Henry Jackson Society and included the description of a document intended to provide guidance about the needs of Muslim pupils in state schools as a 'blueprint for Islamisation'. It was entitled, Towards Greater Understanding: Meeting the Needs of Muslim Pupils in State Schools. Information and Guidance for Schools and is available as an appendix to the Kershaw Report. Its intentions are clearly set out in the introduction where its states, \\"its purpose is to promote greater understanding of the faith, religious and cultural needs of Muslim pupils and how they can be accommodated within schools. It also provides useful information and guidance and features of good practice in meeting those needs.\\" Peter Clarke, former counterterrorism chief, conducted the investigation which gathered and examined 2,000 documents and generated 2,000 pages of interview transcripts from 50 witnesses, including former headteachers, teachers, council staff and school governors. He said some of the witnesses had been very nervous and anxious. He found \\"very clear evidence\\" that young people were encouraged to \\"accept unquestionably a particular hardline strand of Sunni Islam that raises concerns about their vulnerability to radicalisation in the future.\\" It described the ideology being promoted as: \\"an intolerant and politicised form of extreme social conservatism that claims to represent and ultimately seeks to control all Muslims. In its separatist assertions and attempts to subvert normal processes it amounts to what is often described as Islamism.\\" He conducted no interviews with governors or teachers who were accused of misconduct, with the exception of Tahir Alam. Nor did he report any evidence provided by school improvement officers at Birmingham City Council or the department for Education. Nor did he report the evidence of the secretary to Birmingham Standing Advisory Council on Religious Education (SACRE) that the scheme of Islamic collective worship at Park View had been in place since 1996 and had been regularly reviewed since then, and that the school was teaching the agreed local curriculum on religious education, despite not being required to do so as academies. This evidence would come to light when the NCTL misconduct case against senior teachers at PVET collapsed because the prosecution had failed to disclose material from the Clarke Report that it had had in its possession since the start of the proceedings. Detailed allegations The report outlined instances of Islamism or Salafism found in the schools. They included: *Anti-Western rhetoric, particularly anti-US and anti-Israel; *Segregationism ‚Äì dividing the world into us and them, with them to include all non-Muslims and other Muslims who disagree; *Perception of a worldwide conspiracy against Muslims; *Attempts to impose its views and practices upon others; *Intolerance of difference, whether the secular, other religions or other Muslims. =Education and curriculum changes= The report found there had been changes made to the curriculum and education plans, including increasing the faith component. The choice of modern language teaching had been restricted to the study of Arabic or Urdu at several schools. At Park View, Golden Hillock, Nansen and Oldknow academy, it is alleged that teachers were instructed not to use images in any subject which displayed even slight intimacy between sexes. The investigation found that \\"terms such as condom, the pill and so forth have been banned\\" and that governors had insisted on an Islamic approach to subjects, such as Personal, Social and Health Education, science, religious education, and sex and relationships education. Governors also restricted teaching topics which were part of the Department for Education's Prevent strategy, such as forced marriage and female genital mutilation. No evidence was provided to substantiate these claims. Creationism was taught as fact in school assemblies and science lessons at both Park View and Golden Hillock. Children were banned from playing musical instruments and drama lessons were dropped from the schedule. The art curriculum was altered to \\"remove full faces or immodest images, such as paintings by Gustav Klimt.\\" These claims by witnesses were unsubstantiated. The educational advisers to the Clarke Report did not set out the guidelines applying to religious education and collective worship in schools and no information was provided about the locally agreed SACRE curriculum which continued to be taught in the schools. The school had a determination from the local SACRE to provide Islamic collective worship since 1996. Responsibility for determinations for academy schools passed to the Department for Education, but they put in place no measures for renewing determinations. The Department for Education had also commissioned a report by Ipsos Mori in 2010 into how schools understood their duties with regard to Community Cohesions and Prevent. This showed that most schools conflated the two and did not have teachers trained in the Prevent duty. Park View was more compliant than would be the case for other schools. In addition, Park View had been designated a National Healthy School for its approach to Personal, Social and Health Education. =Intolerance and racism= The report found evidence of intolerance at several schools toward gay, lesbian, bisexual and transsexual people, and said that governors and staff exhibited openly homophobic behaviour. Staff wishing to discuss LGBT matters were lambasted by governors. The investigation found that at Anderton Park School, after a white child joined the school, a Muslim parent instructed staff: \\"get a white chair and white desk and put the white kid in a white corner with a white teacher and keep him away from the others. If that fails get rid of the white kid.\\" A three-year-old in a nursery said that his family were poor because the Jews and Zionists had all the money. Student ambassadors, known as \\"religious police\\" were appointed at Park View to report \\"the names of staff or students who exhibit behaviours deemed unacceptable by conservative Muslims\\". Park View Brotherhood The investigation obtained 3000 messages, spanning 130 pages of transcripts, of a private WhatsApp discussion between a group of teachers at Park View School called the Park View Brotherhood. The report stated the messages evidenced that the group had \\"either promoted, or failed to challenge, views that are grossly intolerant of beliefs and practices other than their own.\\" The discussions contained: \\"Explicit homophobia, highly offensive comments about British service personnel, a stated ambition to increase segregation at the school, disparagement of Muslims in sectors other than their own, scepticism about the truth of reports of the murder of Lee Rigby and the Boston Marathon bombing and a constant undercurrent of anti-western, anti-America and anti-Israel sentiment.\\" The group promoted links to extremist speakers that betrayed \\"an Islamist approach that denied the validity of alternative belief\\", and some group members who believed that the murder of Lee Rigby was staged encouraged other members to promulgate this view. Figures in the group included Park View Headmaster Mozz Hussain, Deputy Head of Nansen Primary Razwan Faraz and Shahid Akmal, the Chairman of Governors at Nansen. In a discussion on 5 February 2014, a teacher at Oldknow and governor at Small Heath School, revealed that the group's favoured candidate had become the head teacher at Small Heath. Nasim Awan, a governor at Springfield, said that the \\"first agenda item\\" should be to apply for Islamic assemblies at the secular school. Faraz replied by saying that the new head \\"has to establish herself with minimum controversy for first six months\\", also referring to starting an eventual \\"Islamising agenda\\", but at the same time ensuring that the new head does not become a \\"coconut\\" in the process. Another participant in the discussion said that \\"JEWS\\" (emphasis in original) were making websites with false information on the Quran, while Abdul Malik, Deputy Head of Golden Hillock in Bradford wrote \\"Al-Islam will prevail over all other ways of life. Look at how [the] Muslim population is increasing in the UK.\\" Criticism of Birmingham City Council The report concluded that based on the examination of emails and correspondence: \\"There is incontrovertible evidence that both senior officials and elected members of Birmingham council were aware of activities that bear a striking resemblance to those described in the Trojan horse letter many months before it surfaced.\\" It said that the council had been aware of the extremist activities as early as the end of 2012, and that discussions had taken place between officials as early as July 2013, half a year before the emergence of the Trojan Horse letter. Yet, \\"eight weeks after the letter was received there was no systematic attempt to deal with the issue.\\" Instead, the report concluded, the council was focused on community cohesion. It said that there was never a serious effort to ascertain what was happening in school governing bodies, and that council's approach had been described as one of \\"appeasement and a failure in their duty of care towards their employees.\\" These claims by witnesses were unsubstantiated. The educational advisers to the Clarke Report did not set out the guidelines applying to religious education and collective worship in schools and no information was provided about the locally agreed SACRE curriculum which continued to be taught in the schools. The school had a determination from the local SACRE to provide Islamic collective worship since 1996. Responsibility for determinations for academy schools passed to the Department for Education, but they put in place no measures for renewing determinations. The Department for Education had also commissioned a report by Ipso Mori in 2010 into how schools understood their duties with regard to Community Cohesions and Prevent. This showed that most schools conflated the two and did not have teachers trained in the Prevent duty. Park View was more compliant than would be the case for other schools. In addition, Park View had been designated a National Healthy School for its approach to Personal, Social and Health Education. = Kershaw Report = The report commissioned by Birmingham City Council and compiled by former head teacher, Ian Kershaw, concluded that school governors and teachers had tried to promote and enforce radical Islamic values and found evidence of extremism in 13 schools. It said that \\"manipulative\\" governors had been determined to introduce \\"unacceptable\\" practices and to deny students a broad and balanced education. It found evidence that the \\"five steps\\" to destabilise a school's leadership, as outlined in the original Trojan Horse letter, were \\"present in a large number of the schools considered part of the investigation.\\" It said evidence pointed to a group of \\"British male governors and teachers, predominantly of Pakistani heritage\\". The investigation, however, did not find evidence of a \\"conspiracy\\" to promote \\"violent extremism or radicalisation\\" values. Criticism of Birmingham City Council Mr Kershaw stated that the council had been \\"slow to respond\\" to allegations in the letter and said there was \\"culture within of not wanting to address difficult issues and problems with school governance\\" for risk of incurring accusations of racism or Islamophobia.\\" The report said that the extremism went unchallenged as the council prioritised community cohesion over \\"doing what is right\\". Like Peter Clarke, Kershaw seemed unaware that all schools had a duty to promote community cohesion. Extremism The report found that attempts were made to introduce Sharia law in schools. There were posters in schools warning the children that if they didn't pray, they would \\"go to hell\\". Girls were taught they could not refuse sex with their husbands, and would be \\"punished\\" by angels \\"from dusk to dawn\\" if they did. Teachers taught the children at Park View Academy that \\"good\\" Muslim women must wear a hijab and tie up their hair. In an incident that was referred to counter-terrorism police, a teacher told the pupils at the Golden Hillock school \\"not to listen to Christians as they were all liars\\". Another teacher told the children that were \\"lucky to be Muslims and not ignorant like Christians and Jews.\\" At Nansen School, Islamic religious assemblies were introduced and Christmas and Diwali celebrations were cancelled. The study of French was replaced by Arabic. At the Oldknow academy, children were asked whether they believed in Christmas and encouraged to chant \\"no we don't\\" in response. The pupils were told at an assembly not to send Christmas cards and that Mary was not the mother of Jesus. Kershaw revealed to MPs at the Commons select committee on education in September 2014 that at one school \\"a film about violent extremism\\" was shown to the children. In fact, this film was a BBC Panorama programme, a copy of which had been made at the request of West Midlands Police, to show at a session they were providing for the school on the dangers of radicalisation. Criticism of the report Russell Hobby, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers said the organisation could not fully endorse the report. He said that its conclusions did not reflect the full reality in schools, and that discrepancies between this and the governmental report were \\"regrettable and unhelpful\\". He said that Birmingham City Council had limited its process and terms of reference \\"in a way which excludes critical evidence\\", that it had employed \\"too narrow a definition of extremism\\" and that the governmental report had reached a very different set of conclusions by accessing a different evidence base. Response =Political= Prime Minister David Cameron declared that refusing to accept British laws and way of life was \\"not an option\\" Prime Minister David Cameron, on a visit to Birmingham, praised his government's swift action in investigating the conspiracy. He said that \\"protecting our children\\" was \\"one of the first duties of government\\" and convened an emergency meeting of the Extremism Taskforce and a ministerial meeting to discuss the affair. He announced proposals to send Ofsted to any school without warning, saying that the schools in question had been able to stage a \\"cover-up' previously. Former Prime Minister, Tony Blair, said that the Trojan Horse plot was driven by the same Islamic extremism as that of Boko Haram, the Nigerian terrorist group. He said that the efforts to instil fundamentalist practices into Birmingham classrooms were based on a \\"warped and abusive view of the religion\\". Michael Gove, Secretary of State for Education, announced after the investigation that schools must promote \\"British values\\" Michael Gove, the Education secretary, announced that all of England's schools would have to promote \\"British values\\" of tolerance and fairness and that teachers would be banned from the profession if they allowed extremists into schools. This would be so despite the fact that the previous duty on schools to promote community cohesion had included an emphasis on 'shared values' which were exactly the same values espoused in the new duty. New clauses were added into funding agreements for academies, stating that the Secretary for Education could close schools whose governors do not comply with \\"fundamental British values\\". Harriet Harman, the shadow Culture Secretary, urged the Culture Secretary, Sajid Javid, to protect music from being dropped from school curriculums after learning this had taken place at one of the investigated schools. Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal Democrats Nick Clegg also backed the investigation, stating that schools should not become \\"silos of segregation\\". Later, he was critical of the Conservatives' plan to teach \\"British values\\", claiming that it would alienate moderate Muslims. In a letter to Park View Trust chairman Tahir Alam, Education Minister Lord Nash criticised its running of the schools, saying he was \\"deeply mindful of the need to eliminate discrimination, advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations.\\" He said the government would be terminating its funding arrangement with three of the schools. Members of Parliament of all three major parties in Birmingham wrote a joint letter for an inquiry. Khalid Mahmood, the Labour MP for Perry Barr, said that the City Council may have known of previous plots, but not acted due to fears of being seen as anti- Islamic. Mahmood, who is a Muslim and member of the neo-conservative Henry Jackson Society, said that he felt that it was certain that \\"Salafists\\" were attempting to change the school's secular nature and \\"split young people away from their parents\\". He accused Tahir Alam, chairman of the Park View Educational Trust, of \\"planning this for 15 years\\" and honing in Birmingham tactics that he had drafted in his 72-page document, published by the Muslim Council of Britain in 2007, on how to subvert schools to fundamentalist Islam. Mahmood told Channel 4 that he did not believe that the investigation was Islamophobic, stating \\"Over 200 people complaining to the local authority about what's gone on and you can't really claim that it's a witch-hunt\\". When the reports were published, Mahmood said that scepticism of the original letter could be \\"put in the bin\\", but some people still had \\"their heads buried in the sand\\". After the reports were published, Liam Byrne, Labour MP for Birmingham Hodge Hill, said that cultural division in Birmingham had been caused by the rhetoric of the government, and \\"[Birmingham]'s school system is so fragmented it feels at times likes the Balkans\\". In May, David Blunkett announced that if in government again, the Labour Party would appoint an 'Independent Director of School Standards' with the power to monitor academies: \\"In April 2014, the alleged Operation Trojan Horse in Birmingham demonstrated the difficulties that have arisen from this 'absence of transparency'\\". The Labour MP for Poplar and Limehouse, Jim Fitzpatrick, warned of a 'Trojan Horse'-style Islamist plot to infiltrate councils in London. He said that \\"the Trojan Horse in east London was a political one rather than an educational one\\" and spoke of racial politics taking hold. He noted that in Tower Hamlets, a borough in which 32 per cent of the population is Bangladeshi, the Tower Hamlets First Party, of which the Mayor was a member, had 18 councillors who were all Bangladeshi, and 17 of them were men. Salma Yaqoob, a former Birmingham City Councillor and prominent Muslim spokesperson, began a group named \\"Hands Off Birmingham Schools\\" in the aftermath of the inspections, saying that they were influenced by \\"a climate of political and media hysteria\\". Political row between Home Office and Department for Education In June 2014, there was a highly public argument between the Home Office and Department for Education ministers about the responsibility for the alleged extremism. The Prime Minister, David Cameron, intervened, requiring that Secretary for Education Michael Gove apologise to the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism head Charles Farr for briefings critical of him appearing in The Times, and Home Secretary Theresa May to sack a close adviser, Fiona Cunningham, known to be in a relationship with Farr, who was found by a Downing Street inquiry to have been the source of a negative briefing against Gove. =Unions= The National Union of Teachers (NUT) demanded a full review of academies after the letter was revealed, expressing that political and religious groups had exploited the status at thousands of schools to indoctrinate children. The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) has also expressed concerns about the scope of the problem in other major cities, whilst advising that there was no \\"cause for panic\\". The general secretary of the headteachers' union, Russell Hobby, said the union has found \\"concerted efforts\\" by hardliners to infiltrate Birmingham schools, and that it was working with 30 of its members in 12 schools and had \\"serious concerns\\" about some of them. =Birmingham City Council= Sir Albert Bore, the leader of Birmingham City Council, called the original Trojan Horse letter \\"defamatory\\" and \\"hugely difficult to investigate\\" and offered protection to the whistleblower if they would come forward to help in the investigation. He later said that the Council accepted the Ofsted findings that schools in the city were failing pupils. The Council's Chief Executive, Mark Rogers, said that there was no plot, but that \\"new communities\\" had raised \\"legitimate questions and challenges\\" to the \\"liberal education system\\". In July 2014, after the reports had been published, Bore apologised and admitted that the Council had ignored Operation Trojan Horse due to fear of being accused of racism\\". =Schools= David Hughes, a trustee at Park View School, claimed that Ofsted's investigation of the school was biased, and dubbed the inspection a \\"witch hunt\\". Tahir Alam, a governor at Park View School since 1997, and former chair of the education committee of the Muslim Council of Britain, said that the accusations had been \\"motivated by anti- Muslim, anti-Islam sentiment\\". The Muslim Council of Britain also described the investigation as a 'witch hunt'. Waseem Yaqub, former Head of Governors at Al-Hijrah school, called it \\"a McCarthy-style witch-hunt\\" and that the letter was used by councillors \\"to turn on [Muslims] and use Muslims as scapegoats\\". Helena Rosewell, a Music teacher at Park View for 15 years, stated that her \\"blood [was] boiling\\" when investigations started at the school. However, she admitted that senior staff had warned her not to let pupils dance to pop or Bollywood music. Assistant principal Lee Donaghy, a self-declared agnostic, said that the school was achieving more by \\"accommodating\\" Muslim practices, but called it \\"pernicious\\" the idea \\"that people running the school are trying to force more religion on these kids than the parents want\\". On reaction to Gove's call for \\"British values\\" in schools, the Muslim Council of Britain expressed fear that it would effectively bar conservative Muslims from becoming school trustees or governors. Governors resigned from Saltley School in protest after the Ofsted findings were released, stating that they doubted the inspectors' impartiality. Tahir Alam, chair of governors at Park View and labelled by some newspapers as the \\"ringleader\\" of Operation Trojan Horse, resigned alongside all of his board of trustees on 15 July. He denied all allegations against him. =Media= Media coverage of Operation Trojan Horse was varied. Andrew Gilligan of The Daily Telegraph wrote extensively on the episode. He criticised the approaches to the story by the BBC and The Guardian, which he claimed were unduly biased in favour of the schools. Pieces in The Guardian included criticism of the academy system, and demands that all state schools be made secular. The latter piece concluded that in the present system, the schools investigated could have registered themselves as faith schools and been allowed to teach Islamic values with permission from the state. The Guardian also analysed Michael Gove's book on combatting Islamist terror, Celsius 7/7, pointing out that a chapter is titled \\"The Trojan Horse\\". In July 2014, Channel 4's investigative programme Dispatches aired an episode titled \\"No Clapping in Class\\" on the issue of faith schools. It interviewed Mohammed Zabar, a Muslim parent who wrote to the Prime Minister in December 2013 about the lack of cultural balance in the curriculum at his daughter's school, Oldknow. A member of staff at Park View also alleged that the school had handed out worksheets stating that wives can not refuse to have sex with their husbands, a claim that the school denied. The show also found evidence of unregistered Haredi Jewish schools in London, which an ex-pupil claimed were not teaching a balanced curriculum. Daily Mirror expos√© An undercover reporter working for the Daily Mirror posed as a wealthy businessman and potential client of the training firm Exquisitus, a firm owned by Shahid Akmal, the chairman of governors at Nansen Primary School. The reporter recorded a series of meetings with him which the Mirror alleged exposed Akmal as a \\"sexist, racist bigot\\". Akmal was recorded saying that \\"white women have the least amount of morals\\" and since women were \\"emotionally weaker\\" than men, their role was to look after children and the home. Akmal criticised female politicians, saying: \\"She has to sacrifice her family, she has to sacrifice her children, she has to sacrifice her husband, all in the name of equality.\\" He claimed that girls should be taught cooking and sewing while boys should be taught trades. He claimed that white children were lazy and that white people \\"still think they rule half the world.\\" He said that the \\"colonial blood\\" within white people was \\"very difficult to get rid of that very quickly\\". Akmal said that jailing gay people and adulterers was a \\"moral position to hold\\" and that they should be exiled from the community. He said \\"man-made\\" British laws were \\"very confusing\\", unlike those \\"given by God\\", which were fair. =Reinstatement of headteachers= Headteacher of Oldknow Academy Bhupinder Kondal handed in her notice in January 2014. Ms Kondal alleged she had been the victim of undue and unlawful pressure to resign her position by both parents and governors. The previous trustees of the academy having been replaced, she withdrew her resignation and returned to her post on 19 August 2014. Speaking after withdrawing her resignation, Ms Kondal said: \\"The pressures outlined in the Trojan Horse letter are very real and it mustn't be allowed to happen again.\\" Shabina Bano, chair of the Oldknow Academy Parents' Association, said parents would welcome Ms Kondal back because they wanted > stability as soon as possible... At the same time we want to know why she > deserted parents. These questions have been left unanswered... She has not > been held to account. The governors have been made to resign... Has she come > back because she wants to take the school forward or is she fulfilling a > personal vendetta? Ms Bano had previously been highly critical of the terms of the inspections of the school, claiming that \\"(My children) never knew words like radicalisation, but have now been exposed to them.\\" Bhupinder Kondal left the school again shortly after. Aftermath In May 2015, the National Association of Head Teachers' annual conference heard that the problems associated with Operation Trojan Horse persisted, and there were claims that teachers had received death threats for attempting to dissuade students away from homophobia. Responding to those claims, Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said that there was no place for extremism in education, and there was still more work to be done to eradicate it. \\"This is a reminder that this is a serious issue and something that is not going to be solved overnight. We have taken action to remove and continue to take action to remove people from being in schools who don't follow British values.\\" National College of Leadership and Teaching (NCTL) hearings The first opportunity for teachers to challenge the claims came when hearings against them for professional misconduct brought by the NCTL were begun in September 2015 over a year after the story about the affair first broke. Case hearings in July and August 2015 took place to establish the nature of the charges to be put and evidence to be submitted (in the case of the senior teachers at PVET, the evidence file expanded from around 1000 pages to 6000 pages between the two meetings). No charges of extremism were put forward, only charges associated with ‚Äòundue religious influence‚Äô. This was after the government had cited the Trojan Horse affair as justification for its new plans to counter extremism. The hearings were expected to be concluded quickly, but continued through until May 2017. The rush to set up the hearings in July and August 2015 (prior to the Conservative Party conference in September) provided little time for the preparation of the case for the defence prior to the start of the hearings in contrast to the long-drawn-out nature of the proceedings once they had started. Arrangements for the hearings were deeply unsatisfactory, with four separate cases brought against different groups of teachers associated with PVET and one other school, Oldknow Academy (which it transpired had a Memorandum of Understanding with PVET, signed at the behest of the Department for Education). Three cases against junior teachers were heard separately from that against the senior leadership team at PVET. The drawn out nature of the cases meant that there were no journalists present to report the detailed rebuttal of claims indicated above, for example of banning Christmas celebrations, or teacher handouts promoting the obligations on wives to consent to sex with their husbands. The hearings dramatically came back into media attention in October 2016 after one of the hearings that had concluded with guilty verdicts against two teachers went to the High Court on appeal. The findings were quashed on grounds of serious procedural irregularities. Mr Justice Phillips declared that evidence for the defence presented in the hearing against the senior leadership team should have been made available to the defendants in the other case. A further comment by Mr Justice Phillips is noteworthy. At paragraph 37 of his judgement, he writes that: ‚Äòthe Panel expressly stated in each decision, when pronounced on 9 February 2016, that the allegations were ‚Äúin no way concerned with extremism‚Äù. It appears that this wording troubled the Head of the Department for Education's Due Diligence and Counter Extremism Group, Hardip Begol. He asked for publication to be delayed pending ‚Äúclarification‚Äù. With the apparent agreement of the Chair of the Panel, the decisions were amended prior to publication so as to state that the allegations ... were ‚Äúin no way concerned with violent extremism‚Äù.‚Äô The charge of failure to disclose documents from the main hearing against senior teachers in other hearings, however, indicated a possibility of a similar failure on the part of NCTL to fulfil its obligations of disclosure in the hearing against senior leaders. The Panel had been ready to announce its decision in the case on 23 December 2016, but an urgent application for disclosure, relating, in part, to transcripts associated with the Clarke Report, was made by defence lawyers on 24 November 2016. Media reporting expressed alarm that the transcripts were those of ‚Äòwhistleblowers‚Äô who had provided statements under terms of confidentiality. However, what was at issue also included other documents outside the Clarke Report that had potentially been relevant to the case. Altogether the documents that were deemed to be relevant amounted to about 1600 pages. As set out in the Panel Report,NCTL, May 2017. 'Monzoor Hussain, Hardeep Saini, Arshad Hussain, Razwan Faraz, Lyndsey Clark Professional conduct panel outcome Panel decision and reasons on behalf of the Secretary of State for Education in respect of applications for the proceedings to be discontinued'. this included evidence an inspector from the EFA Report who had acted as adviser to the Clarke Report about the circumstances of the EFA inspections where the Panel proposed that ‚Äòno doubt it would be argued that this further undermined her credibility and the reliability of her evidence‚Äô (see paragraphs 124/125 of the Panel's justification of discontinuing). There was evidence from officials at the DfE responsible for managing the incorporation of schools into PVET, as well as initiating a memorandum of agreement between PVET and Oldknow (paragraph 123). It also included evidence from then secretary to Birmingham SACRE, given to the Clarke inquiry but not reported by him, which ‚Äúconflicts with the evidence of NCTL witnesses who had been saying that it was wrong for collective worship to be solely about Islam when a school had a determination but [the secretary] who had been with SACRE for 9 years, said it was acceptable‚Äù (paragraph 125). Initially, the failure to disclose the transcripts was explained as a ‚Äòdepartmental misunderstanding‚Äô, albeit one, according to the Panel, where, ‚Äòeven on that basis such failure was simply unacceptable‚Äô. However, it transpired that, just before the Panel was due to rule on 3 May 2017 on an application by the defence lawyers to discontinue, the NCTL presented a note from their solicitors. This stated that, on 14 October 2014, they had received, ‚Äò25 of the Clarke transcripts to include transcripts of 10 interviewees who went on to be witnesses for the NCTL in these proceedings. This pre-dated by approximately 3¬Ω months the date on which the witness statements were signed and finalised‚Äô. This led the Panel to conclude that the matter had not been a misunderstanding‚Äô, but that the transcripts were ‚Äòdeliberately withheld from disclosure‚Äô. In consequence, the Panel judged that the matter was ‚Äòan abuse of the process which is of such seriousness that it offends the Panel‚Äôs sense of justice and propriety. What has happened has brought the integrity of the process into disrepute‚Äô. The case against the senior leaders was discontinued, as were the remaining two cases in July 2017. Unlike the teachers, the lawyers involved in serious impropriety were not subject to professional misconduct charges despite the cost of thearings. Teachers lost their livelihoods and a community had its reputation besmirched, yet their defence was neither fully heard nor reported. Government officials and policy advisers, as well as journalists previously involved in the case, rushed to announce that the cases had collapsed on a ‚Äòtechnicality‚Äô. For example, the co-head of the security and extremism unit at Policy Exchange (the conservative think tank that had advised Michael Gove's schools programme), Hannah Stuart, and its head of education, John David Blake, proposed that, ‚Äúnon-disclosure of anonymous witness statements from the Clarke inquiry was described as an ‚Äòabuse of process‚Äô, and that is deeply unfortunate, but this falls short of an exoneration. The decision to discontinue disciplinary proceedings was based on procedural grounds ‚Äì not on a shortage of evidence.‚Äù 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. No mention was made of the fact that allegations of extremism had not been any part of the charges against teachers. Jaimie Martin, former special adviser at the DfE, wrote that ‚Äúit is important to note as [the teachers] were not tried for the charges, they were therefore not cleared of them‚Äù, and that ‚Äúpeople who downplay the seriousness of Trojan Horse, claiming those involved exhibited ‚Äòmainstream‚Äô Islamic views, are guilty not only of stunning naivety, but of a dangerous error.‚Äù The academic scholar John Holmwood, who served as an expert witness in the professional misconduct case brought against the senior teachers at Park View Educational Trust, wrote a book with scholar Therese O'Toole about the Trojan Horse affair, Countering Extremism in British Schools? The Truth about the Birmingham Trojan Horse Affair (2017). They described the Trojan Horse affair as a \\"false narrative\\" spread by a hostile British press which led to \\"a serious miscarriage of justice\\" against the teachers, drawing comparisons to the Hillsborough affair.

It premiered on April 13, 2014 on Fox and aired on April 14, 2014 on National Geographic Channel. The episode explores the smallest particles in the universe, where host Neil deGrasse Tyson \\"hunts for elusive neutrinos and the distant, early universe.\\" The episode features the underground neutrino laboratory, Super- Kamiokande, located underneath Mount Kamioka in Japan. The episode received a 1.3/4 in the 18-49 rating/share, with 3.49 million American viewers watching on Fox.  Episode summary  Supernova SN 1987A helped to prove the existence of neutrinos that resulted from the nuclear reactions deep within any star. This episode exhibits the nature of the cosmos on the microscopic and atomic scales, using the Ship of the Imagination to explore these realms. Tyson describes some of the micro-organisms that live within a dewdrop, demonstrating parameciums and tardigrades. He proceeds to discuss how plants use photosynthesis via their chloroplasts to convert sunlight into chemical reactions which convert carbon dioxide and water into oxygen and energy-rich sugars. Tyson then discusses the nature of molecules and atoms and how they relate to the evolution of species. He uses the example set forth by Charles Darwin postulating the existence of the long-tongued Morgan's sphinx moth based on the nature of the comet orchid with pollen far within the flower. He further demonstrates that scents from flowers are used to trigger olfactory centers in the brain, stimulating the mind to threats as to aid in the survival of the species. Tyson narrates how Greek philosophers Thales and Democritus postulated that all matter was made up of combinations of atoms in a large number of configurations, and describes how carbon serves as the basic building block for life on Earth due to its unique chemical nature. Tyson examines the basic structure of atoms, their protons, neutrons, and electrons, and the nature of nuclear fusion, a process found to occur within most stars. He then discusses the existence of neutrinos created by these nuclear processes, and the attempts to detect such subatomic particles which normally pass through matter, requiring subterranean facilities like the Super- Kamiokande which were used to detect neutrinos from the supernova SN 1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud. These neutrinos were detected before any light from the explosion reached us; this was due to their ability to pass through the matter of the dying star itself. Tyson compares how neutrinos were postulated by Wolfgang Pauli to account for the conservation of energy from nuclear reactions in the same manner as Darwin's postulate on the long-tongued moth. Tyson concludes by noting that neutrinos from the Big Bang still exist in the universe but, due to the nature of light, there is a \\"wall of infinity\\" beyond which we cannot observe.

Plot  Bubunne (or Bubunia) is a matriarchal totalitarian country led by the ruthless La G√©n√©rale (Generaless). In Bubun, the roles of men and women are reversed, up to the point where the male population is deprived of any civil rights, including work, education, military service, freedom of marriage etc. People worship The White Horses (making horses sacred animals) and the only source of nourishment is \\"paste\\" (tasteless viscous liquid delivered from waterpipe-like sinks). The country is isolated from the rest of the world, borders are guarded by armed squads, and public executions are in order (the condemned being mostly men). Jacky is an over-popular handsome young man, who lives in poverty with his widow mother, and crushes on La Colonelle (Coloness), the Generaless's daughter and the future leader of the state. Jacky is also one of the few boys with at least some education: his paternal uncle Julin (Michel Hazanavicius) - gigolo and contrabandist, also a masculism revolutionist - teaches the nephew literacy. Jacky's maternal aunt, with two husbands, is quite rich and her two sons constantly bully Jacky for being so poor. Generaless proclaims a grand ball, at which the Lead Rider (the current leader's husband) will be chosen for her daughter as she succeeds to become ruler of Bubun. Jacky's mother cannot afford a ticket to the ball, and Jacky desperately tries to make Julin give up the \\"treasure\\" left by Jacky's father. Jacky reports Julin to the police, yet unexpectedly authorities find Julin guilty of treason (printing illegal pamphlets) and incarcerate him for subsequent hanging. Sheriffess, grateful to Jacky for informing her, leaves him a free ticket to the ball. After Jacky's mother dies (ironically, due to Jacky's own actions; sleepless because of the ball preparations, he cleaned her boots so well that she slipped), his aunt takes him in, but refuses to let him come to the ball. At this point, Jacky flees the village, only to be caught by Sherifess and immediately rescued by Julin (who escaped imprisonment by \\"riding wardens until they were knocked out\\"). Together, they manage to get to the palace. While Julin intends to sell his stash of vegetables and get money for crossing the border, Jacky wants to get to the ceremony and confess his love to Coloness. During the ball, Coloness invites Jacky (disguised as a female officer) to her quarters and tells him that she does not want to be the new Generaless, and tries to seduce him (believing Jacky to be a woman). The Generaless, however, interrupts them, as she has already chosen the Lead Rider for her daughter. Jacky's cover is blown when his relatives recognize him, and he finally tells the Coloness he loves her, revealing himself to be a man. When Generaless orders Jacky to be caught and killed, he ventures deeper into the palace, discovering that \\"paste\\" is actually processed and enriched feces (as the Generaless's adjutant puts it, \\"the poor eat their own shit and are happy\\"). To reveal the truth, Jacky overloads the main cauldron, making the country realize what their food is made of. Hiding under the Coloness's bed, Jacky convinces her of his love and spends a night with her, stating that he will love her regardless of who she is. In the morning, she shows him a crowd of men outside the palace: the entire country believes Jacky to be a hero (not without Julin's provocation). Jacky is then captured and sentenced to death, yet Generaless offers him a deal: life and marriage to her daughter in exchange for his cooperation in preventing rebellion. When he agrees, she tries to cut off his tongue (stating that Jacky \\"has seen too much\\"), but is immediately strangled to death by Coloness. Together, the two open the borders of Bubun, establish democracy and introduce emancipation, as well as restore the country's agriculture. In the last scene, when Coloness and Jacky are about to officially marry, they announce that Bubunia wants \\"no more secrets from its people\\" and strip naked in front of the crowd, revealing that Coloness is actually a man, and that they, in fact, just entered gay marriage (since Generaless had no daughters despite years of trying, she wanted her last child to become the state leader despite being male). The film ends with a woman from the crowd yelling \\"Blasphemy!\\".

She is the daughter of cellist Valentin Berlinsky, founder of the Borodin Quartet.  Life  Berlinskaya is the daughter of a lawyer mother and musician father: cellist Valentin Berlinsky, founder of the Borodin Quartet. Her childhood was spent in the presence of the many artists and figures in the Russian intelligentsia who surrounded her parents such as composers Mieczys≈Çaw Weinberg, Dmitri Shostakovitch, Alfred Schnittke, Sofia Gubaidulina; musicians Mstislav Rostropovitch, David Oistrakh, Daniil Shafran, Yakov Zak, Alexander Goldenweiser, Yakov Flier; conductors Yuri Temirkanov, Yevgeny Svetlanov, Gennady Rozhdestvensky, Dmitri Kitayenko; artists Anatoly Zverev, Nikolai Silis, Vadim Sidur, Vladimir Lemporte, Rustam Khamdamov, Dmitry Krasnopevtsev, author Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and academic Andrei Sakharov.

By the age of 19 she had already performed on the greatest stages in the Soviet Union in Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Nizhny-Novgorod and other cultural capitals. A key stage in her life came during her musical career: 13‚Äëyear-old Ludmila Berlinskaya played one of the three lead roles in the film A Great Space Voyage by Valentin Selyanov which was a phenomenal success and became the symbol of a generation. She performed the two main songs for the film (–¢—ã –º–Ω–µ –≤–µ—Ä–∏—à—å –∏–ª–∏ –Ω–µ—Ç; –º–ª–µ—á–Ω—ã–π –ø—É—Ç—å) both composed by Alexey Rybnikov; these pop songs were and are still played on Russian radio stations on a regular basis. Ludmila Berlinskaya was then offered several roles but turned them all down in favour of music. 15‚Äëyear-old Ludmila Berlinskaya entered the privileged circle that was the entourage of Sviatoslav Richter. Chosen and protected by him, she saw him as a spiritual father and soaked up the creative atmosphere that surrounded the great artist. From the end of the 70s to the start of the 80s, she was even the pianist‚Äôs page turner, a rather unusual role. Besides Sviatoslav Richter‚Äôs personal influence which greatly affected her future decisions, Ludmila Berlinskaya made the most of the relationship to befriend numerous artists: Yuri Borissov, Yevgeny Mravinsky, Galina Ulanova, Boris Pokrovsky, Ivan Kozlovsky, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Peter Schreier, Christoph Eschenbach, Vladimir Vasiliev, Stanislav Neuhaus, Natalia Gutman, Oleg Kagan, Innokenty Smoktunovsky and others. She made numerous appearances at Richter‚Äôs festival at the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts: the December Nights festival whose annual schedule takes the theme of an exhibition hosted by the museum in the room in which the concerts take place. Among her many performances at the festival, she played piano four hands with Sviatoslav Richter at the event in 1985 and she replaced him at the last minute for the piano section of the Britten opera The Turn of the Screw. Well known for his reluctance regarding competitions, Richter encouraged Ludmila Berlinskaya not to go down this route. In spite of some appearances, in which she won the top prize (top prizes in chamber music competitions in Paris and Florence; Leonardo prize), she followed his advice and stopped competing in the top international competitions. She met the young conductor Vladimir Ziva whilst with Richter. They got married and had a son, Dmitri Berlinsky, not to be confused with the violinist of the same name. Ludmila Berlinskaya‚Äôs son is now a professional cello player following studies with Pavel Gomziakov, Natalia Shakhovskaya and Roland Pidoux. In 1989, Ludmila Berlinskaya moved to Paris with her second husband, Anton Matalaev, first violinist in the Anton Quartet, who had just won the Grand Prix at the Concours d'√âvian. Ludmila Berlinskaya began performing with Mstislav Rostropovich in Europe on a regular basis whilst in Paris. Following their first concert at the Paris Town Hall, the then mayor‚Äôs wife, Mrs Chirac, offered Ludmila Berlinskaya the chance to create a festival: the Salon Musical Russe. Anton Matalaev and Ludmila Berlinskaya have a daughter, Macha Matalaev, born in 1991. Anton Matalev died in 2002. The 90s were a busy decade for partnerships and concert performances. Ludmila Berlinskaya performed recitals and chamber music in the greatest international venues such as Wigmore Hall and Barbican Hall in London, Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, Th√©√¢tre des Champs- √âlys√©es and Salle Gaveau in Paris, the Moscow Conservatory, the Fenice in Venice, the Royal Academies of Brussels and Madrid plus a large number of festivals. A great specialist in chamber music, her talent has been called upon by new partners such as Gautier Capu√ßon, Henri Demarquette, David Geringas, Alain Meunier, Pavel Gomziakov, Philippe Muller, Dominique de Williencourt, G√©rard Poulet, Sarah Nemtanu, G√©rard Causs√©, Jean-Marc Luisada, Fran√ßois-Ren√© Duch√¢ble, Paul Meyer, the Modigliani Quartet, the Orlando Quartet, the Danel Quartet, the Fine Arts Quartet, the Saint Petersburg Quartet, the Ardeo Quartet, the Moragu√®s Quintet and other famous ensembles. Ludmila Berlinskaya is known as a great specialist in Shostakovitch music having played all his chamber music for piano with well-known partners and even rarer or more unusual pieces. In 2001 she founded her second Festival, \\"Printemps Musical √† Paris\\", which was taking place in different venues in Paris. It hosted Alexandre Scriabine‚Äôs Parisian creation Prom√©th√©e and for the first time in Paris after George Balanchine, Aubade by Poulenc with a dancer. Alongside her concert performances, Ludmila Berlinskaya has been teaching at the √âcole Normale de Musique de Paris \\"Alfred Cortot\\" since 2006. In June 2009, she founded the Association Berlinsky following the death of Valentin Berlinsky on December 15, 2008. She performed a piano duet with her husband and French pianist Arthur Ancelle in 2011. Released in spring 2012 through Saphir Productions, their first album was devoted to pieces by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and won several awards. The second album, devoted to Sergei Prokofiev‚Äôs ballets, was released in 2014 through the Melodia record label: it‚Äôs the first recording to be entirely produced and released by Melodia since the fall of the USSR. Ludmila Berlinskaya is the artistic co-director of a new music festival in the Loir-et-Cher, \\"La Cl√© des Portes\\", instigated by the Club d'Entreprises des Portes de Chambord. In 2016, Ludmila Berlinskaya had performed another piano duet with Arthur Ancelle playing Danse macabre of Camille Saint-Sa√´ns in Salle Cortot of Paris.

It originally aired on April 17, 2014 on NBC. The episode was written by Ryan Ridley, making this his series writing debut, and it was directed by Rob Schrab. The episode is the second half of a two-part season finale with \\"Basic Story\\", which aired the previous week. The episode shortly served as the series finale after Community was canceled on May 9, 2014, but on June 30, 2014, Yahoo! commissioned the series' sixth and final season to be streamed online on Yahoo! Screen. This is the last episode to be broadcast on NBC. This is also the last episode of the series to feature John Oliver as Professor Ian Duncan (who had a recurring role during seasons 1, 2 and 5) and Jonathan Banks as Buzz Hickey (who had a recurring role during season 5). Plot Dean Pelton (Jim Rash) tells Jeff (Joel McHale) and Britta (Gillian Jacobs) about Russell Borchert (Chris Elliott), the wealthy inventor who founded Greendale. Borchert was developing a computer to process human emotion but eventually disappeared with his fortune. Annie (Alison Brie) explains that Borchert's computer lab was sealed away decades ago. Blueprints reveal a hidden level under the teachers' lounge, and they go there to search. However, when Duncan (John Oliver) accidentally shocks himself, Jeff demands they stop. He announces his engagement to Britta; the others protest their decision. Suddenly, Abed (Danny Pudi) discovers a trapdoor. Chang (Ken Jeong) leads Carl (Jeremy Scott Jones) and Richie (Brady Novak), two school board members, to the lounge, where they find Shirley (Yvette Nicole Brown), Hickey (Jonathan Banks), and Duncan. The others, having entered the trapdoor, search for Borchert's lab. Annie wonders if Greendale is still worth saving. Sensing the true reason for her distress, Abed explains Jeff and Britta's engagement is a crutch to cope with uncertainty. Abed notices a suspicious jukebox, which reveals a secret door. They find Borchert's lab and his gold-lined machine, as well as Borchert himself. Chang, Carl, and Richie unsuccessfully interrogate Shirley and Hickey until a Subway employee reports they found the trapdoor. In the lab, Borchert is fiercely protective of his computer, named \\"Raquel\\", but offers them his leftover money when he realizes their motives. Chang, Richie, and Carl suddenly arrive and take the money. Richie uses a magnet to damage Raquel's hard drive, which controls the lab. The trio escapes before the door closes, trapping the others. Borchert realizes Raquel's emotional circuitry still works. He mentions how he founded Greendale, which prompts Jeff to find documents proving it. Borchert theorizes that an intense burst of emotion could restart Raquel. Jeff volunteers and tells everyone to turn around as he hooks himself up to the machine. He contemplates the Dean, Britta, and Abed, but nothing happens until he looks at Annie. Raquel quickly powers up, and the door opens. Richie and Carl prepare to sign Greendale over to Subway. The group stops the proceedings and presents documents granting Borchert consultation rights on Greendale's endeavors. The Subway rep (James Michael Connor) cancels the deal. As the school celebrates, Jeff and Britta call off their engagement, and Abed muses about next year. Afterwards, the Save Greendale Committee holds a final meeting to commemorate their accomplishment. The end-tag is a fictional NBC programming promo featuring characters from fictional new programs.

Ra»ôcu (most common rendition of Ion Ra»ôcu; ‚Äì 1971) was a Romanian poet of Symbolist verse, cultural promoter, comparatist, and schoolteacher. He is remembered for his participation in the Romanian Symbolist movement: a founder and co-editor, with Alfred Hefter-Hidalgo, of Versuri »ôi ProzƒÉ magazine, he became one of the leading Symbolist figures in his native city of Ia»ôi before 1914. In later years, he lived more discreetly as a scholar and educationist, earning both praise and opprobrium for his sternness and erudition. A Catholic convert and devotional writer, Ra»ôcu spent several years in France. He made a belated attempt to revive Symbolism with the 1930s magazine √éndreptar, where he also published his Catholic prose and fragments of his work in literary history. He became noted, and challenged, for his critical reviews of Mihai Eminescu's poetry. His late works in travel literature document his increasing isolation and monastic fervor, as well as his dedication to Saint Th√©r√®se of Lisieux. In his final years, Ra»ôcu returned to literary life as an authority on, and biographer of, his Symbolist colleagues. Biography =Origins and early years= Ra»ôcu's maternal great-grandfather was the French upper class tailor Fr√©d√©ric Ortgies (described in one of Ra»ôcu's poems as having \\"a rosy and melancholy face\\").CƒÉlinescu, p. 706 Originally from Picardy,Huzum, p. 26 he settled in Moldavia before its 1859 merger into Romania. Ortgies' daughter, Eugenia, married Ioan Tudor Curie (or Curius; 1816‚Äì1898), an actor and French- language teacher from Wallachia. Curie had once been the most promising graduate of the Wallachian Philharmonic Society, and friend of its founder Costache Aristia, before leaving to join the French Foreign Legion.Iolanda Berzuc, \\"Arta interpretƒÉrii teatrale ≈üi societatea rom√¢neascƒÉ √Æn secolul al XIX-lea\\", in Studii »ôi CercetƒÉri de Istoria Artei. Teatru, MuzicƒÉ, Cinematografie, Vol. 1, 2007, p. 97 He settled in Ia»ôi, where he played a minor part in the 1848 upheaval, and afterward spent years in exile.CƒÉlinescu, pp. 706, 1017 Their daughter, Clelia (1865‚Äì1950), was Ra»ôcu's mother. His father, born in Odobe»ôti, worked as an art and calligraphy teacher. The couple also had three daughters, of whom Clelia (1897‚Äì1944) went on to marry University of Ia»ôi physician Emil Hurmuzache; and another son, Gheorghe, who made his living as a teacher of geography.CƒÉlinescu, p. 1017 Also an Ia»ôi native, Ion Ra»ôcu was raised Romanian Orthodox, but later in life returned to the religion of his French forefathers, joining the Roman Catholic Church. In Catholic circles, he was remembered as \\"one of our great converts\\", on par with missionary Vladimir Ghika and author Mariu Theodorian-Carada.Valeriu Hetco, \\"Catolicismul »ôi unificarea sufleteascƒÉ. RƒÉspuns pentru Legea Rom√¢neascƒÉ, II\\", in Vestitorul, Issues 17‚Äì18/1932, pp. 6‚Äì7 As argued by literary historian Paul Cernat, this evidenced a \\"propensity toward 'alternative' spirituality and a tense relationship with the dominant Orthodox religion\\", also found among Symbolists who turned to Theosophy, heresy, or occult practices.Cernat, p. 17 Ra»ôcu was entirely committed to his new faith: he is described by critic George CƒÉlinescu as a Catholic of \\"fanatical correctness\\", \\"discretion\\", and \\"great suaveness\\",CƒÉlinescu, pp. 684, 705 and by philologist Adrian Marino as one who suggested \\"all sorts of anachronisms\\", \\"fervent and very fanatical\\", but \\"distinguished\\", \\"of an entirely Westernized urbanity\\".Marino, \\"Note. I. M. Ra»ôcu »ôi Sf√¢nta...\\", pp. 470‚Äì471 He is also remembered for his withdrawals into mystical contemplation, and for his adhering to an austere dress code in his daily life.CƒÉlinescu, p. 705; Marino, \\"Note. I. M. Ra»ôcu »ôi Sf√¢nta...\\", pp. 470‚Äì471 Ra»ôcu attended primary and secondary school in Ia»ôi, living with his family on the outskirts of that city.Cernat, p. 7 As he himself recounted in later years, the monotonous atmosphere of the Moldavian fin de si√®cle, the sentiment that something was about to happen \\"in the world at large\\", made a mark on him: \\"Perhaps it is that we waited for the age to weight less on us, but to shake us more violently.\\" Ra»ôcu debuted in 1905 in the student review Spre LuminƒÉ. His contributions were a poem, expressing Ra»ôcu's sadness over the recent death of his father, a conventional sonnet, and a brief overview of Aromanian folkloric laments.Opri»ô, p. 23 He sent additional pieces to the popular magazine Duminica, using the pen names I. Cimbru-FrƒÉgar, I. Ieronim, I. Ra»ôcu-Ieronim, I. Ieronim-Cimbru, and some variations of these.Straje, pp. 147, 272, 341, 342, 589, 590 As Evandru, he also contributed to the political newspaper Opinia, owned by Alexandru BƒÉdƒÉrƒÉu.Straje, pp. 257, 589 Graduating from the National High School in 1909, he took a diploma in Letters from the University of Ia»ôi. =Versuri »ôi ProzƒÉ= Ra»ôcu's debut as a Symbolist promoter came in 1911, when he founded at Ia»ôi the review Versuri (\\"Verse\\"). Reappearing as Versuri »ôi ProzƒÉ (\\"Verse and Prose\\") from 1912 to 1916, it was to be Moldavia's longest-lived Symbolist magazine.Cernat, p. 55; Mitchievici, p. 144 Ra»ôcu, the chief editor,CƒÉlinescu, p. 684 often signed his contributions with pseudonyms, introducing himself as M. Zopir, I.M.R., Ev., or just E.Straje, p. 589 He was seconded by Alfred Hefter-Hidalgo, who was the group's theoretician and staff critic.Cernat, pp. 34, 55; Mitchievici, pp. 86‚Äì87, 144‚Äì150 Heavily influenced by the Symbolist critic Ovid Densusianu,CƒÉlinescu, p. 684; Cruceanu, pp. 88‚Äì89 Versuri »ôi ProzƒÉ was quite successful in attracting other Symbolist authors: Mihail Cruceanu, N. Davidescu, Benjamin Fondane, Al. T. Stamatiad, Ion Minulescu, Claudia Millian, Nicolae Budurescu, Eugeniu Sperantia, Tudor Arghezi, Adrian Maniu, Barbu Solacolu, Mihail Codreanu, Drago»ô Protopopescu, Constantin T. Stoika, Perpessicius, Felix Aderca, Alexandru Vi»õianu, and (with early selections from his influential Plumb) George Bacovia.Variously credited by: CƒÉlinescu, p. 684; Cernat, pp. 55, 313; Mitchievici, p. 144 More senior Symbolists such as Densusianu and Alexandru Macedonski were also present, as were the generic modernists Hortensia Papadat-Bengescu, Cezar Petrescu, F. Brunea-Fox, and Vasile Demetrius. Ia»ôi being a city of traditionalist tastes, and primarily a center for the ruralizing Poporanist movement, this Symbolist activation caused a stir. As an additional mark of rebellion, Densusianu was invited by Ra»ôcu in Ia»ôi, where he gave a public lecture against Poporanist tenets. The magazine's printing shop put out copies of Ra»ôcu's own poetry, as Sub cupole de vis (\\"Under the Domes of Reverie\\"). In the closing months of 1912, Ra»ôcu and Hefter-Hidalgo also contributed to Simbolul, the Symbolist review put out in Bucharest by Tristan Tzara.Cernat, p. 49 Ra»ôcu popularized the work of French poets and novelists, beginning with his translations of Albert Samain's Polyph√®me and Marcel Schwob's La croisade des infants.CƒÉlinescu, pp. 705, 1017; Huzum, p. 26 Hefter-Hidalgo, whose Romanian Jewish ethnicity underlined the tolerant and non-traditional character of Versuri »ôi ProzƒÉ,Cernat, p. 34 introduced the public to Remy de Gourmont, Stuart Merrill, Gustave Kahn, and the erotic works of Pierre Lou√øs.Mitchievici, pp. 86‚Äì87, 145 The Poporanist reaction bordered on censorship. Among the rival literary columnists, August Scriban referred to Ra»ôcu as \\"ruddy, long-haired and repulsive\\", while Gheorghe Bogdan-DuicƒÉ dismissed Versuri »ôi ProzƒÉ as the \\"insolence of the impotent\\". After public readings from Ra»ôcu and Codreanu's poetry, unknown authors resorted to putting out a parody of Versuri »ôi ProzƒÉ, with so-called \\"verse from the netherworld\\". According to CƒÉlinescu, these parodists were \\"talentless\\", but also showed \\"common sense\\".CƒÉlinescu, pp. 684‚Äì685 In actuality, Versuri »ôi ProzƒÉ was not entirely opposed to traditionalist literature. According to Cernat, it should be read as a \\"non-exclusive\\" publication, \\"in a gradual‚Äîand discreet‚Äîevolution into modernism.\\"Cernat, p. 55 It even dedicated special issues to Poporanists such as Garabet IbrƒÉileanu, Mihail Sadoveanu, and Octav BƒÉncilƒÉ,Mitchievici, p. 144 and was thus more mainstream than two other Ia»ôi reviews (Eugen Relgis' Fronda, Isac Ludo's Absolutio).Cernat, pp. 55‚Äì57 At times, the opposition was explicit. Writing for Versuri »ôi ProzƒÉ in 1914, Hefter-Hidalgo ridiculed the more radical, post-Symbolist, movements, with reference to Futurism or Simultanism,Mitchievici, p. 145 but explored the possibility of staging in Ia»ôi the Expressionist work of Frank Wedekind. Ion Cazaban, \\"La sc√®ne roumaine et l'expressionnisme (III)\\", in Studii »ôi CercetƒÉri de Istoria Artei. Teatru, MuzicƒÉ, Cinematografie, Vol. 2 (46), 2008, p. 9 Hefter and Ra»ôcu both set out to distinguish between the Decadent movement and Symbolism. Hefter acknowledged the traditionalist dislike for decadent themes and their surfacing in Symbolism, but contended that Symbolist art was fundamentally new, idealistic, and infinitely beautiful.Mitchievici, pp. 146‚Äì150 For his part, Ra»ôcu objected to what he saw as exaggerated Poporanism, noting that the \\"sickness\\" of Decadence was not necessarily bad, since: \\"Not all sick things are repugnant.\\"Mitchievici, p. 146 Marginally affiliated with Densusianu's Viea»õa NouƒÉ circle before 1915,Cruceanu, pp. 43, 89; Huzum, pp. 26, 30; Lovinescu, p. 117; Opri»ô, p. 130; Straje, p. 590; Vianu, pp. 130‚Äì131 Ra»ôcu had his work published in various other Symbolist periodicals in the capital city, Bucharest. His work was taken up by Noua RevistƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ, Av√¢ntul, Farul, and by Stamatiad's GrƒÉdina Hesperidelor.Straje, p. 590 He visited and studied in France during 1912 and 1914, then returned to Romania for employment as a substitute teacher of French in Ia»ôi, BrƒÉila, Tecuci, and B√¢rlad. His second volume, the poem Ora»ôele dezamƒÉgite (\\"Jaded Cities\\"), came out in Ia»ôi in 1914. =1920s= After the outbreak of World War I, and during the two years of Romanian neutrality, Versuri »ôi ProzƒÉ affiliated with the pro-Entente and Francophile movement, finally obtaining its acceptance by the cultural mainstream. Just after the war's end, in 1919, Ra»ôcu received a full teaching position at Unirea High School in Foc»ôani. While there, he founded and led a student literary society, named in honor of Grigore Alexandrescu, and put out its yearbook, noted for its reviews of 19th-century Romantic poetry\\"Cronica mƒÉruntƒÉ\\" (1921), passim; CƒÉlinescu, pp. 982, 991, 1017; Huzum, p. 26; Iordan, passim. See also Straje, pp. 589‚Äì590 and its encouragement of intellectual debates between students.Nicolae I. Popa, \\"Psihologia lecturilor adolescen»õei\\", in Via»õa Rom√ÆneascƒÉ, Issues 1-2/1932, pp. 68‚Äì69 G√¢ndirea magazine condoned his efforts in this respect, while also noting that Ra»ôcu and his students made a habit of trekking through \\"the less visited parts\\" of Vrancea County, following in the footsteps of mountaineer Bucura DumbravƒÉ.\\"Cronica mƒÉruntƒÉ\\" (1921), p. 267 According to linguist Iorgu Iordan, his was \\"a tireless and completely selfless work\\", all the more admirable considering that Foc»ôani \\"was not quite the lover of art and literature\\".Iordan, p. 52 In addition to such contributions, Ra»ôcu himself published his own textbook and chrestomathy of Romanian literature. According to Virgil Huzum, a poet and Unirea graduate, the school could remember Ra»ôcu \\"with justified pride.\\" Nevertheless, Ra»ôcu was not happy teaching in Foc»ôani: as Iordan writes, his sternness was not well received by his students, and, when his grading system was challenged by his superiors, he resigned from his position altogether.Iordan, p. 53 Eventually, he relocated to Bucharest, where, from 1923 to 1933, he taught at »òincai Lyceum, and presided over its students' Society for the Study of Romanian Literature.CƒÉlinescu, p. 1017; Huzum, p. 30 Returning to France for a 1924 visit, Ra»ôcu remained there on an extended study trip, from 1925 to 1929, and was a resident scholar of Nicolae Iorga's Romanian School in Fontenay-aux-Roses.CƒÉlinescu, p. 1017; Huzum, pp. 26, 30 He attended the College of Sorbonne, specializing in comparative literature and attending the courses of Fernand Baldensperger and Paul Hazard.Huzum, p. 30 His main interest was Mihai Eminescu, Romania's national poet, analyzed in comparison with French writers of his day. He inventoried such literary sources at the National Library, which he frequented on a regular basis. While Ra»ôcu was still abroad, fellow writer Al. Lascarov- Moldovanu put out another selection of his poetry, the 1927 Nelini»ôti (\\"Unrests\\").Huzum, p. 30. See also CƒÉlinescu, p. 1017 Ra»ôcu's time in France evidenced his commitment to Catholicism. For 9 days in August 1929, he secluded himself at the original Trappist monastery, the Abbey of La Trappe, in what was an effort to escape from the encroachment of modernity. Adrian Marino, \\"Note. Setea lini»ôtei eterne\\", in Universul Literar, Issue 6/1945, p. 16 In France, Ra»ôcu experienced not just Catholic fervor, but, according to his own account, a personal miracle: he claimed that a statue of Saint Th√©r√®se of Lisieux smiled upon him in Ville-d'Avray.Marino, \\"Note. I. M. Ra»ôcu »ôi Sf√¢nta...\\", p. 471 =√éndreptar= Returning to public life in 1930, Ra»ôcu launched the magazine √éndreptar (\\"Rectifier\\") with assistance from his old Symbolist friends Cruceanu and Sperantia, and with additional help from Huzum and Mia Frollo. Nichifor Crainic, \\"Cronica mƒÉruntƒÉ\\", in G√¢ndirea, Issue 5/1930, p. 191 It was also there that he published \\"splinters\\" from an incomplete Christian novel, as well as articles of literary history‚Äîsometimes as I.M.R., but usually as Evandru. The review was hotly criticized by G√¢ndirea ideologist Nichifor Crainic, who wrote off its attempts to revive Symbolism. Its \\"exaggerated Francophilia\\", Crainic claimed, clashed with the day's agenda, which involved \\"searching for our [Romanian] selves at the deepest level\\". Although an Orthodox theologian, Crainic still admired Ra»ôcu's faith and his \\"fine spiritual evolution\\". At √éndreptar and elsewhere, Ra»ôcu published his finds on Eminescu, hypothesizing about the latter's sources of inspiration in modern French literature (particularly Lamartine and Gautier). These studies earned him accolades from the specialty press, but were also attacked by philologist Vladimir Streinu. According to Streinu, Ra»ôcu's \\"anthill\\" of references only managed to show \\"coincidences\\" between Eminescu's poetry and the work of various French authors.Vladimir Streinu, \\"Despre o modalitate a judecƒÉ»õii literare\\", in Revista Funda»õiilor Regale, Issue 7/1936, pp. 166‚Äì167 Ra»ôcu refocused on his teaching career, and, in 1933, published the pamphlet Cum se dezorganizeazƒÉ √ÆnvƒÉ»õƒÉm√¢ntul (\\"How They Are Breaking Education Apart\\").\\"CƒÉr»õi primite la redac»õie\\", in Arhivele Olteniei, Issue 12/1933, p. 478 In 1934, his account of a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Th√©r√®se in Lisieux was published in Bucharest, followed in 1935 by a selection of prose poems, called VibrƒÉri (\\"Vibrations\\").\\"DouƒÉ recenzii\\", in Flori de Crin. RevistƒÉ FemeninƒÉ, Issue 9/1935, p. 10 Also that year, he issued a monograph about Eminescu's view of Catholicism (Eminescu »ôi catolicismul). It explores the many variants of Eminescu's \\"Prayer to the Virgin\\", linking them to the Litany of the Blessed Virgin Mary and highlighting Eminescu's primordial debt to Western canon. The book also shows Ra»ôcu being troubled by Eminescu's Orthodox background, and what it meant for his theoretical salvation.CƒÉlinescu, p. 705 When switching focus to on politics, Ra»ôcu outlines the tenets of Eminescu's distaste for the enforced secularism of the French Third Republic; however, he also renders (and deplores) the poet's adversity toward the establishment of a Bucharest Catholic See. =Later life= In 1936, the Cluj review G√¢nd Rom√¢nesc put out as a volume Ra»ôcu's literary study, comparing the work of Eminescu and Vasile Alecsandri (as Eminescu »ôi Alecsandri).CƒÉlinescu, p. 1017. See also Huzum, p. 30 The essay Convingeri literare (\\"Literary Convictions\\") came out in 1937. Ra»ôcu had by then moved to a teaching position at Mihai Viteazul National College, and, in 1938, put out a second Romanian literary textbook, Alte opere din literatura rom√¢nƒÉ.CƒÉlinescu, p. 1017; Huzum, p. 30; Iorga, pp. 374‚Äì375 The work pitted Ra»ôcu against his former employer Iorga, whose hypotheses and impressions on the sources of Romantic literature it would not credit. In his review of the book, Iorga complained that Ra»ôcu had displayed a \\"harsh professorial\\" attitude toward his own research.Iorga, p. 374 Ra»ôcu returned to poetry in 1939, with Renun»õƒÉrile luminoase (\\"Luminous Renunciations\\"). In 1943, at the height of World War II, Editura Cugetarea put out his Setea lini»ôtei eterne (\\"Thirsting for Eternal Serenity\\"), which detailed his time at the La Trappe. Ra»ôcu survived the postwar imposition of a communist regime, but faded into obscurity. Leonte RƒÉutu, the communist official in charge of cultural affairs, wrote him off in 1949 as \\"a very inconsequential figure\\" in Romanian literature. Gheorghe Grigurcu, \\"O carte despre Cameleonea (II)\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Issue 38/2009 He returned to the spotlight in the late 1960s, when he helped researcher Mihail Straje document the pseudonymous work of himself and other Symbolists (such as Hefter-Hidalgo, PƒÉstorel Teodoreanu, and Barbu Solacolu).Straje, pp. 63, 322, 590, 659, 712 At the time, a critical review of Ra»ôcu's work was published by Constantin Ciopraga in the magazine Cronica. His own Amintiri »ôi medalioane literare (\\"Literary Memoirs and Medallions\\"), comprising short biographies of his friends, was published in 1967, the same year as his definitive Poeme (\\"Poems\\"). He was also in correspondence with publisher Teodor V√¢rgolici, who published, at Editura Minerva, Ra»ôcu's crowning critical study, the 1969 Eminescu »ôi cultura francezƒÉ (\\"Eminescu and French Culture\\"). Al. SƒÉndulescu, \\"Documente literare\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Issue 46/2009 He died in Bucharest in late 1971. Literary work As CƒÉlinescu suggests, I. M. Ra»ôcu was a \\"constant\\" Symbolist, oriented toward a trademark \\"provincial\\", \\"Sunday\\" poetry, which mirrored his \\"melancholy seclusion\\" and \\"sacred bucolic joys\\". Cultural historian and critic Eugen Lovinescu summarizes Ra»ôcu's poetry as \\"asthenia\\", \\"projecting life beyond reality, into the realm of dreams, [...] the life of a bloodless ghost\\".Lovinescu, p. 117 Critic Tudor Vianu reads Ra»ôcu as mainly a Moldavian Symbolist, in line with Bacovia, »òtefan PeticƒÉ, and Demostene Botez. In comparison with the \\"rhetorical temperaments\\" of the Wallachian Symbolist school, such authors proved to be \\"natures of the interior\\"; against Wallachian \\"cosmopolitanism\\", they held up an attachment to \\"the tiny Moldavian t√¢rg.\\"Vianu, p. 386 However, as Lovinescu writes, such traits did not exempt Ra»ôcu from exoticism and cosmopolitanism: along with Eugeniu Sperantia and Alexandru Gherghel, he \\"made skillful use\\" of the modernizing and \\"decorative\\" Romanian lexis favored by Densusianu at Viea»õa NouƒÉ.Lovinescu, pp. 117, 118 According to Cernat, Ra»ôcu's early poems mainly feature \\"Symbolist, Secessionist and Art Nouveau clich√©s\\"; in his Ora»ôele dezamƒÉgite, he merely adapted the scenery of Georges Rodenbach's Bruges-la- Morte to a Moldavian setting.Anca Clitan, \\"Georges Rodenbach »ôi cultura rom√¢nƒÉ\\", in Verso, Issue 48/2008 His own poetic tropes were nostalgic, evoking the medieval atmosphere of castles, domes, crypts, galleys, but also parks and ponds. The effect of such poetry was, according to Lovinescu, \\"academic\\" and \\"discoursive\\", often \\"prolix\\", and only \\"externally Symbolist\\". Ra»ôcu's religious itineraries were unusual in the Romanian context, and not just for illustrating the Catholic option‚Äîa minority one in Romania. At the time of its publishing, Ra»ôcu's homage to Saint Th√©r√®se was hailed in the Catholic press as one of the \\"few original works of religious inspiration\\" (as opposed to sheer translations), and also the work of \\"a talented poet\\". P. I. G. [Pr. Ioan Georgescu], \\"Viea»õƒÉ ascunsƒÉ √Æntru Domnul\\", in Vestitorul, Issue 1/1935, p. 11 Adrian Marino notes that, as time passed, Ra»ôcu seemed \\"more determined\\" to settle into an absolute seclusion from the secular world. His Catholic writing evidenced \\"such conviction\\", \\"that any suspicion becomes an undeserved insult\\"‚ÄîRa»ôcu seemed to Marino a modern-day \\"Crusader\\". Also according to Marino, Setea lini»ôtei eterne was unwittingly amusing, \\"candid\\" and \\"prudish\\", particularly with its \\"misogynistic\\" commentary on the attire of female believers; however, Ra»ôcu's \\"dreamy and monkish temperament cannot fail to impress us.\\" Notes References * \\"Cronica mƒÉruntƒÉ\\", in G√¢ndirea, Issue 14/1921, pp. 266‚Äì268 *George CƒÉlinescu, Istoria literaturii rom√¢ne de la origini p√ÆnƒÉ √Æn prezent, Editura Minerva, Bucharest, 1986 *Paul Cernat, Avangarda rom√¢neascƒÉ »ôi complexul periferiei: primul val, Cartea Rom√¢neascƒÉ, Bucharest, 2007. *Mihail Cruceanu, De vorbƒÉ cu trecutul..., Editura Minerva, Bucharest, 1973. * Virgil Huzum, \\"I.

Kingdom of Yugoslavia In 1937 Belgrade based daily newspaper Politika published news about a young man from Central Serbia who arrived in Belgrade with his brothers to change his gender. World War II =Independent State of Croatia= In the Nazi Germany puppet state Independent State of Croatia, homosexuals were persecuted and sent to concentration camps, such as Jasenovac. Croatian author Ilija Jakovljeviƒá in his text Konclogor na Savi (English: Concentration Camp on Sava) mentioned that in prison on Square N16 in Zagreb (modern day Square of the Victims of Fascism) he met a \\"lover of the male body\\". =National Liberation War 1941-1945= There are sources about homosexual Yugoslav Partisans during World War II in Yugoslavia. Milovan ƒêilas in his war memoirs tells the story from Sand≈æak where one Muslim soldier was exposed as homosexual by other soldiers and the Regional Secretary, Rifat Burd≈æoviƒá. The Regional Secretary in doubt asked ƒêilas if he should \\"execute [the] freak?\\", while ƒêilas remained in doubt admitting that at the time he neither knew Communist Party of Yugoslavia practice nor anything said on such matters by Marx and Lenin. At the end he concluded that \\"from such vices suffer proletarians, and not only bourgeois decadent\\" but that he can not have functions or be a party member. ƒêilas said that he only later learned that \\"that homosexual, who in appearance was sheer manhood, was very brave and courageously fell in battle\\".J. Batini ÃÅc, Women and yugoslav partisans: A history of world war ii resistance, Cambridge University Press, 2015. Communist Yugoslavia =Postwar persecution= In postwar period there were more examples of persecution and inhumane treatment of homosexual individuals. One of cases took place in Dubrovnik where members of Communist Party in 1952 arrested homosexuals, put bags with pejorative inscriptions on their heads and led them through the city. In 1959 homosexuality was officially criminalized in Yugoslavia. =Liberalization in the 70s= In 1973, the Croatian Medical Chamber removed homosexuality from the list of mental disorders. In 1974 a law professor at the University of Ljubljana, Ljubo Bavcon, urged the decriminalization of homosexuality as one of the members of the Commission for the Adoption of Criminal Law of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia. First federal subjects that decriminalized homosexuality were the Socialist Republics of Croatia, Slovenia, Montenegro and Socialist Autonomous Province of Vojvodina in 1977. Other parts of the Federation will make this move only after the collapse of Yugoslavia. Serbia (excluding Vojvodina) in 1994, Macedonia in 1997 and finally Bosnia and Herzegovina (both Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska) in 1998. =LGBT activism= The first six-day long festival of gay culture in Yugoslavia was organized in April 1984 in Ljubljana. In the same year, the first gay organization Magnus was founded in Ljubljana and in 1987, the first lesbian organisation was founded LL (Lezbijska Lilit). The first regular radio broadcast that, amongst other marginalized groups, dealt with gay issues were the 1985 Zagreb based Frigidna utiƒçnica (English: Frigid Socket) whose host Toni Maro≈°eviƒá was openly gay. Because of disapproval from Veƒçernji list and the Veƒçernje novosti program, it was quickly removed from the station programming. In its 1986 proclamation, the organization Magnus demanded the introduction of prohibition of discrimination based on sexual orientation in the Yugoslav Constitution, decriminalization of homosexuality in the whole of Yugoslavia, the introduction of curriculum that would present homosexuality and heterosexuality on equal terms & demanded a protest of the Federal Government of Yugoslavia against Socialist Republic of Romania, Soviet Union, Iran and other countries where homosexuality was still criminalized at that time. In 1990 in Hotel Moskva in Belgrade, which was a popular gay gathering place in the 1970s, one gay and lesbian group began to organize meetings and in January 1991 they founded the organization Arkadija. =LGBT topics in pop culture= Music In the second half of the 1970s first songs that deal with issues of lesbian and gay population appear. They were very different in genre, from rock, post-punk, electropop to the traditional folk music. Some of the most popular songs with LGBT themes are \\"Neki djeƒçaci\\" sung by Prljavo kazali≈°te, 1982 song \\"Moja prijateljica\\" sung by Xenia, \\"Pre≈æivjeti\\" sung by KUD Idijoti, 1974 song \\"Ramo, Ramo\\" sung by Muharem Serbezovski, 1980 song \\"Retko te viƒëam sa devojkama\\" sung by Idoli, song \\"Javi mi\\" sung by Zabranjeno Pu≈°enje and song \\"Balada o ƒçvrstim grudima\\" sung by ≈†arlo Akrobata.

He was the art director of 20th Century Pictures's special effects department for more than three decades, winning an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects along the way. As a painter of landscapes and urban scenes, he also became known as a prominent member of the California Scene Painting movement. Family and education Emil Kosa Jr. was born in Paris, France. His parents were Emil Kosa Sr., Czech artist, and Jeanne Mares Kosa, a French pianist for the Paris Opera. After his mother died at the age of three, his father married a Czech wife and in 1908, his family moved temporarily to Cape Cod, Massachusetts, where his father worked with Alphonse Mucha. Four years later, the family returned to Czechoslovakia where he attended the primary and secondary school during and after the World War I. After World War I ended, Kosa Jr. trained in art at the Academy of Fine Arts, Prague. After a mere three semesters, he moved to the United States in January 1921, rejoining his family (which had preceded him in emigrating to the United States). He took art courses at the California Institute of the Arts in Valencia. In 1927, he became a naturalized American citizen. He spent the following year in Paris, studying at the √âcole des Beaux Arts and with Pierre Laurens and Frank Kupka, and returned to California in 1928. Career Kosa is credited with designing the logo for 20th Century-Fox (seen here in 1947) Early in his career, Kosa Jr. worked as a mural painter and designer for various architects and interior decoration firms. He also ran a business with his father producing decorative art objects for churches and auditoriums. As a painter, Kosa Jr. was stylistically affiliated with the movement that became known as California Scene Painting. He painted mainly California landscapes and urban settings in both oil and watercolor, and he also produced commissioned portraits of celebrities, businessmen, and politicians. His work was widely exhibited starting in the 1930s, with solo shows at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and elsewhere. In 1933, he joined the newly formed special effects department at 20th Century Fox. He was quickly promoted to art director, a position he held for the next 35 years. In 1964, he became the first person to win the Best Visual Effects after the Academy Awards changed the name from Special Effects. He won at the 36th Academy Awards for his work on the film Cleopatra. He also helped to create the first logo for 20th Century Pictures (later 20th Century-Fox). Personal life Kosa Jr. was married twice: in 1928 to Mary Odisho (d. 1951) and in 1952 to dancer Elizabeth Twaddel.

It virtualizes a single process using the Google Native Client platform. Since only a single process is virtualized (instead of a full operating system), the startup overhead is in the order of 5 ms.  Sandboxing  ZeroVM creates a sandbox around a single process, using technology based on Google Native Client (NaCl). The sandbox ensures that the application executed cannot access data in the host operating system, so it is safe to execute untrusted code. The programs executed in ZeroVM must first be cross-compiled to the NaCl platform. ZeroVM can only execute NaCl code compiled for the x86-64 platform, not the portable Native Client (PNaCl) format. Code executed in ZeroVM cannot call normal system calls and initially cannot interact with the host environment. All communication with the outside world takes place over channels, which must be declared before the program starts. Outside the sandbox, a channel can be connected to a local file, to a pipe, or to another ZeroVM instance. Inside the sandbox, the program sees the channel as a file descriptor. The sandboxed program can read/write data from/to the channel, but does not know where the channel is connected in the host. Programs compiled for ZeroVM can optionally use the ZeroVM Runtime library called ZRT. This library aims to provide the program with a POSIX environment. It does this by replacing parts of the C standard library. In particular, ZRT replaces C file input/output functions such as \`fopen\` and \`opendir\` with versions that operate on an in-memory filesystem. The root filesystem is provided as a tarball. This allows a program to \\"see\\" a normal Unix environment. The ZRT also replaces C date and time functions such as \`time\` to give programs a fixed and deterministic environment. With fixed inputs, every execution is guaranteed to give the same result. Even non-functional programs become deterministic in this restricted environment. This makes programs easier to debug since their behavior is fixed.  Integration with Swift  ZeroVM has been integrated with Swift, the distributed object storage component of OpenStack. When the ZeroCloud middleware is installed into Swift, a client can make a request to Swift containing a ZeroVM program. The program is then executed directly on the storage nodes. This means that the program has direct access to the data.  History  ZeroVM was developed by LiteStack, an Israeli startup. The first commit in the \`zerovm\` Git repository was added in November 2011. LiteStack was bought by Rackspace in October 2013. ZeroVM participated in Techstars Cloud 2013 incubator program and got $500,000 in seed funding. The first ZeroVM Design Summit was held in January 2014 at the University of Texas at San Antonio.

She kept a journal which was published and commented on posthumously by her husband, Anthony Walker, entitled, ‚ÄúThe vertuous wife: or, the holy life of Mrs. Elizabeth Walker, late wife of A. Walker, D.D. sometime Rector of Fyfield in Essex: Giving a modest and short account of her exemplary piety and charity. Published for the glory of God, and provoking others to the like graces and vertues. With some useful papers and letters writ by her on several occasions.‚Äù Early life Elizabeth Walker (n√©e Sadler) was born in Bucklersbury, London, on 12 July 1623. She was the eldest child of John and Elizabeth Sadler. Her father worked as a druggist in London and was quite successful selling tobacco products and other drugs. Elizabeth was born some five years into their marriage, at a time when they despaired of ever having children. This led to her parents being rather indulgent of her, and so she never wanted for much.Anthony Walker, and Elizabeth Walker. The Holy life of Mrs. Elizabeth Walker, (London: Printed by John Leake for the Author, 1690), 9-12. She claims that her mother trusted her more than her sisters, sending her places where the other children might get into trouble. At an early age Elizabeth recognized a certain level of piety and obedience, traits that would become some of her best-known characteristics as an adult.Walker, The Holy life of Mrs. Elizabeth Walker, 13. These traits are exemplified in what Elizabeth's husband later called her ‚Äúgreatest fault [he] ever knew her guilty of‚Äù. When Elizabeth was around fifteen, she got in trouble with a superior. Naturally her father was told, and when he confronted her about it, Elizabeth was so ashamed she denied the accusations. This lie would haunt her for the rest of her life, and her husband claims she never told another lie again.Walker, The Holy life of Mrs. Elizabeth Walker, 14. Sometime during her young adult life, Elizabeth became depressed. She began to question her faith, and was overall discontent. Through a series of contacts and family friends Elizabeth was sent out to the country to live with John Beadle, an elderly minister. With time she was able to temporarily overcome her troubles. Unfortunately depression, or ‚Äòafflictions‚Äô as she called them, continued to trouble her throughout much of her life. Although her depression was not completely cured, Mr. Beadle would introduce her to her future husband, Anthony Walker. Shortly after her return from the country, Elizabeth and Anthony were married.Walker, The Holy life of Mrs. Elizabeth Walker, 17-30. Personal life =Marriage= Elizabeth was married to Anthony Walker on 23 July 1650,Walker, The Holy life of Mrs. Elizabeth Walker, 27. at the age of 27. While not overly old for marriage ‚Äì most women in the early modern period married in their twenties ‚Äì this is notably later than usual. Mr. Walker was a religious man, chaplain to the Earl of Warwick, and later the Rector of Fyfield.Anthony Walker, Memoir of Lady Warwick also her diary ... to which are added, extracts from her other writings.. (London: Religious Tract Society, 1847), Preface, 10. Love appeared to be of most importance to her happy marriage,Charlotte F. Otten. English women's voices, 1540-1700. (Miami: Florida International University Press, 1992), 132-133. for in his commentary Anthony writes: ‚ÄúShe would often come into my Study to me, and when I have asked her what she would have, she would reply, Nothing, My Dear, but to ask thee how thou dost, and see if thou wantest any thing; and then with an endearing Smile would say, Dost thou love me? To which when I replied, Most dearly; I know it abundantly, would she answer, to my Comfort, but I love to hear thee tell me so.‚Äù Walker, The Holy life of Mrs. Elizabeth Walker, 54-6. Walker dutifully recorded every instance her husband fell ill, described the illness to the best of her ability, and wrote a few prayers alongside. His sickness was of perhaps great interest to her as a pharmacist ‚Äì though she never hesitated to call in a doctor if need arose.Walker, The Holy life of Mrs. Elizabeth Walker, 56-7. =Children= Walker gave birth to her first child, a daughter, on 12 July 1651. Over the next 14 years she carried eleven pregnancies to full term. Of the six sons and five daughters, three were stillbirths ‚Äì two boys and a girl ‚Äì giving the Walkers eight children in total. Walker kept meticulous notes in her journal of each child's ‚Äúmerciful deliverance from God‚Äù and other details, such as her health around delivery.Walker, The Holy life of Mrs. Elizabeth Walker, 60-4. ‚ÄúThe twelfth of July, 1651, God mercifully Deliver'd me of my first Child. In 1652, I being big with-Child, had an high Fever, and was after a great and very hot fit delivered of a Daughter, Aug. 29. Being Lord's Day, between four and five in the Morning, my Fever turned to an Ague, and held me ten Weeks, and brought me very low, yet God in his Mercy graciously spared me, and restored my Health, I bless him for it.‚ÄùWalker, The Holy life of Mrs. Elizabeth Walker, 62. As was tradition, Walker was the primary teacher for her children. She kept her children with her, and hired dancing, singing, and writing instructors to fill in what gaps she could not. She taught them to read herself, instructed them in prayer as soon as they could walk, and had them memorize scriptures when they could read on their own.Walker, The Holy life of Mrs. Elizabeth Walker, 66-82. She gave special attention to the teachings of her daughters, addressing them specifically in her notes. She reminded them of the duties of a ‚Äúvirtuous woman‚Äù: that they should work hard, help those in need, and obey their husbands. In her writings, Walker included pages worth of scripture and prayers she deemed noteworthy for her children. She often utilized her daughters as scribes, to transcribe her best recipes.Kathleen P. Long. Gender and scientific discourse in early modern culture. (England: Ashgate, 2010), 199-200. Despite her medical knowledge, most of her children did not make it to adulthood. In her journal, Walker described the death of two of her daughters, Mary, and Elizabeth.Walker, The Holy life of Mrs. Elizabeth Walker, 92-115. Mary was six years old at the time of her death in 1669. Walker writes of her: ‚ÄúMy sweet Child, and dearly beloved Daughter Mary, a sweet tender hearted obedient Child, of great Prudence, and early Piety, and exemplary Inclination to the knowledge of God, and concerns of a better Life; she fell suddenly ill of a Sore Throat, Jan. 17. 1669. and after four Days illness, sweetly fell asleep in Jesus Christ, Jan. 21.‚ÄùWalker, The Holy life of Mrs. Elizabeth Walker, 96. Some five or six years later tragedy again struck the Walker house when her daughter, also named Elizabeth, died of smallpox. She was sixteen.A Walker, The Holy life of Mrs. Elizabeth Walker, 107. Her only daughter to make it to marriage was Margaret, who gave birth to a son later the same year she married. The son lived; Margaret contracted a fever, and died shortly after. Apart from the few mentioned in her book, it is difficult to know exactly when her other children died, but in her journal she writes, ‚ÄúLord I bless thee that of Eleven, for whom I Praise thee, thou hast yet spared me two [‚Ä¶]‚Äù.Walker, The Holy life of Mrs. Elizabeth Walker, 99. It can be surmised that one of those children was Margaret, and the other an unnamed son, however sources are unclear as to whether that son later died as well.Kathryn M. Moncrief. Performing Maternity in Early Modern England. (England: Ashgate, 2007), 175-176. It is entirely possible Walker witnessed the death of all eleven children. Work and charity Walker was perhaps most well known as being a druggist like her father. Her afternoons were filled with helping sick neighbors, preparing medicines, and counseling the poor. She ‚Äú[‚Ä¶] distilled Waters, Syrups, Oils, Ointments, Salves, &c.; or distribute them out, or apply them to those who needed [‚Ä¶]‚Äù Walker, The Holy life of Mrs. Elizabeth Walker, 178. She sought out other recipes for medicines and treatments actively, often enlisting the help of her brother in law, a licensed physician.Long. Gender and scientific discourse in early modern culture, 200. She was skilled as both a physician and a surgeon, and when she wasn't reading scripture, read and studied the works of doctors.Leonard Guthrie \\"The Lady Sedley's Receipt Book, 1686, And Other Seventeenth Century Receipt Books.\\" (The Lancet 181, no. 4676 (1913): 1041-1044), 166-167. No mention is made of a license, so it is likely Walker was one of the many unlicensed medical practitioners of the time. That she chose to deal in drugs and medicines is mildly unusual ‚Äì of the small number of women in the medical field at that time, most were midwives. Even the health of women wasn't entirely a women's field - men were uncomfortable with women practitioners in any part of the field, and they routinely tried to get laws passed that would prevent women from practicing.Monica Green, Women‚Äôs Medical Practices and Health Care in Medieval Europe, (The University of Chicago Press, 1989), 434-473Nina Gelbart, The King‚Äôs Midwife, (California: University of California Press, 1998), 201-222 Along with crafting medicines and helping others, Walker also had duties involving the running of her household. As well as teaching her children to read and write, she taught her own servants, and instructed them to follow in her pious ways. She was careful to maintain a balance, never being too harsh a mistress, but also never too liberal, never too frugal, or too lavish. Her days were kept as meticulous as her bookkeeping, rising early and praying until six in the morning, when she would begin the rest of her day. Her fragility as a child and depression as a young woman never left her, and she was often struck by ill health or depressive episodes.Walker, The Holy life of Mrs. Elizabeth Walker, 32-51. =Writings= ‚ÄúThe vertuous wife: or, the holy life of Mrs. Elizabeth Walker‚Äù was a collaboration between Elizabeth and her husband, Anthony. She wrote the journal while she lived, and forbade her husband from reading it until she died. Upon her death, Anthony published her work and commented on it himself, often reflecting on their relationship. Her journal entries describe events such as the Great Plague of London in 1665, the Great Fire of London in 1666, and her own more personal accounts of her eleven pregnancies.Otten, English women's voices, 1540-1700, 132. It is important to note that for the time, the publishing of any female writings, particularly diaries and memoirs, was still rather new, and Anthony Walker was unique in his long quotes and pages devoted to Walker's writings.Moncrief, Performing Maternity in Early Modern England, 175. Apart from her journal, Walker is credited as a source for a ‚ÄúReceipt for the eyes‚Äù in a manuscript formerly owned by the Duke of Norfolk.Long. Gender and scientific discourse in early modern culture, 200. Referenced in the footnote. Walker may also have been consulted or included in a receipt book written by Mary Rich, Countess of Warwick, and her sister, Lady Katherine Ranelagh, though it is difficult to discern what she wrote or influenced. Death In February 1690, Walker fell ill with a combination of pneumonia and erysipelas, a bacterial infection of the skin. After a few days the illness worsened, and on 23 February she died. Perhaps a true sign of her piety, some of the last words she spoke to her husband were, ‚ÄúA short Prayer my Dear before thou goest.‚ÄùWalker, The Holy life of Mrs. Elizabeth Walker, 211. She was buried on 27 February.Walker, The Holy life of Mrs. Elizabeth Walker, 210-211. Her death was followed by her husband's two years later, in 1692.Francis Skeet. History of the Families of Skeet, Somerscales, Widdrington, Wilby, Murray, Blake, Grimshaw, and Others. (London: M. Hughes and Clarke, 1906), 150. =Legacy= It is unknown as to whether anyone continued with Walker's work after she died. Ideally, her daughters would have continued for her, but with all of them dead this wasn't an option. No mention was made of her ever taking on an apprentice, which was a common practice for the time.Green, Women‚Äôs Medical Practice and Care, 447 Walker's legacy carries on in her writings published by her husband, and those other receipt books she may have been a part of.

A total of three people were killed in the shootings, two of whom were shot at the community center and one shot at the retirement community. The gunman, 73-year-old Frazier Glenn Miller Jr. of Aurora, Missouri, originally from North Carolina, was arrested during the attack and was subsequently tried, convicted of murder and other crimes, and sentenced to death. Miller is a former Klansman, neo-Nazi and former political candidate. Shootings The shootings began at around 1:00 p.m. (CDT) at a rear parking lot of the Jewish Community Center of Greater Kansas City, near the entrance to the White Theater. The gunman first fired a handgun at two men. One of the men managed to escape immediately, while the second man tried to flee in his car. A bullet struck the shoulder bag of the man's seat, but he escaped uninjured. The shooter then fired at two males, 69-year-old Dr. William Lewis Corporon and his 14-year-old grandson, Reat Griffin Underwood, who were hit by gunfire as they pulled into the parking lot inside their car. Corporon died at the scene of a shotgun wound to the head, while Underwood died of handgun wounds at a hospital. During the time of the first shooting, teenagers were inside the building auditioning for KC Superstar, a singing competition. In addition to that, actors, crew members, and other staff were in the White Theater preparing for a 2:00 p.m. performance of To Kill a Mockingbird. The gunman was able to fire several shots into the building. The staff inside the building were the first to make 9-1-1 calls alerting the police. Multiple staff members, one with paramedic training and the other with military medical experience, attempted life-saving measures on the victims, but were ultimately unsuccessful. After firing at several other people, but missing, the shooter fled in his car and opened fire at Village Shalom, a Jewish retirement community located a little more than a mile away from the community center. A woman, Terri LaManno, was killed in the parking lot, and two other people were shot at, but the gunshots missed both people. The gunman was arrested at 2:45 p.m. outside Valley Park Elementary School by two police officers who identified him in his car using tips given by witnesses. As he was led away, he made antisemitic remarks, according to witnesses. A police official confirmed that the gunman used a Remington Model 870 shotgun in the shootings, and several other weapons, including a handgun, were also recovered from his car. Investigators were also determining whether an assault rifle was also used. In a press conference, the Federal Bureau of Investigation stated that it was \\"determined\\" that the motivation for the shootings was antisemitism. Several items were seized from the suspect's home in Aurora, Missouri, including three boxes of ammunition, a red shirt with a swastika symbol, antisemitic publications (such as Hitler's Mein Kampf), a list of kosher places, directions to synagogues, and a printout of the KC Superstar competition at the community center. Suspect Miller was arrested in connection to the shootings. Prior to his arrest, news reports described the suspected gunman as a man in his seventies who was not a Kansas native. Miller was an Aurora, Missouri, transplant from North Carolina, a neo-Nazi, practicing neo-Pagan beliefs, and former politician who founded and formerly led the Carolina Knights, a paramilitary organization with ties to the Ku Klux Klan in the 1980s, with the organization later being disbanded by the Southern Poverty Law Center, after which he founded another group called the White Patriot Party. In the late 1980s, he was sentenced to three years in prison for weapons charging and plotting to assassinate Morris Dees, the leader and co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center. He previously served in the United States Army for 20 years, which included two tours in Vietnam. Miller's most recent comprehensive interview was with David Pakman of the nationally syndicated The David Pakman Show. Pakman also appears to be the media figure to most recently have had contact with Miller, having released email transcripts from November 2013. Also, The Distorted View Show previously spoke to the suspect in 2010. In late March, Miller visited an emergency room and was diagnosed with emphysema, being told he had a 50 percent chance of living three additional years. According to a November 15, 2014, interview with The Kansas City Star, Miller said he began planning the shootings following the visit. He also added that he believed he would die during the shootings and that he frequently visited the Jewish Community Center of Greater Kansas City prior, including three visits that occurred hours before he first opened fire. Miller was said by police officials to have purchased the firearms from a straw buyer, which enabled him to avoid going through federal background checks; he was unable to make personal purchases because of the weapons charges he was issued during his arrest in the late 1980s. John Mark Reidle, a resident of Lawrence County, Missouri, purchased the shotgun for Miller (a \\"straw purchase\\") at a Walmart store in Republic, Missouri four days prior to the shootings.Tony Rizzo & Donald Bradley, Missouri man charged as 'straw buyer' in Jewish center shootings case , Kansas City Star (June 5, 2014). In June 2014, Reidle was indicted by a grand jury on federal charges of charges of providing false information on a federal firearms form (Form 4473) in order to purchase the shotgun.Bill Morlin, Gun Buyer in 2014 Overland Park Killings Admits Guilt , Southern Poverty Law Center (November 10, 2015). Reidle is also believed to be responsible for the purchase of a handgun for Miller, apparently bought at a gun show.

Glenn Miller Jr. a victimless crime , Kansas City Star (March 8, 2016). Conviction and death sentence Two days after the shootings, Miller briefly appeared in court by video and requested a lawyer. He was charged with one count of capital murder, covering all three deaths because the crime was \\"part of a common scheme or course of conduct.\\" Miller is believed to be the oldest person to be charged with capital murder in the history of Kansas. Miller was later also charged with three counts of attempted first-degree murder as well as additional counts of aggravated assault and criminally discharging a firearm at an occupied building. During his November 2014 preliminary hearing, Miller's attorneys requested a competency examination. The request was approved by Johnson County District Court Judge Kelly Ryan after he expressed concerns about Miller's ability to assist his attorneys. The approval of the request drew outrage from Miller himself, who allegedly wanted a speedy trial. In December 2014, Miller was found competent to stand trial. Prosecutors sought the death penalty against him. On March 2, 2015, a preliminary hearing began to determine if there is sufficient evidence to proceed to trial.Preliminary hearing for accused JCC shooter begins by Andres Gutierrez and Amy Hawley, KSHB (KSHB Kansas City), March 2, 2015.Witnesses testify against white supremacist charged in Kansas murders by Kevin Murphy, Reuters March 2, 2015.

Miller's attorneys attempted twice to arrange plea bargains with prosecutors, under which Miller would, in exchange for pleading guilty, be sentenced to life with parole while avoiding a possible death sentence. However, on both occasions, prosecutors refused to accept the deal. At a court hearing on May 14, 2015, Miller announced that he wanted to fire all of his attorneys, insisting instead that he be allowed to represent himself. Over the advice of his attorneys and the judge against such an action, Miller stated that \\"It's my life and I'll do as I please... The death penalty don't bother me\\" while adding that, if found guilty, \\"I'll climb up on the gurney and stick the needle in myself.\\" Ultimately, the judge agreed to Miller's request, on the condition that his attorneys remain as \\"standby counsel\\".

LaManno was also a Christian who attended St. Peter's Catholic Church in Kansas City, Missouri. Initial reports indicated a fourth person who was shot and wounded, but it was later confirmed that all of the people who suffered gunshot wounds were killed. Including the people shot at but escaping uninjured, only one person targeted by gunfire was Jewish. Reactions President Barack Obama called the shootings \\"horrific\\" and said in a statement, \\"While we do not know all of the details surrounding today's shooting, the initial reports are heartbreaking.\\" U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder also issued a statement in the wake of the shooting, saying, \\"I was horrified to learn of this weekend's tragic shootings outside Kansas City.

Other politicians issued statements in which they offered their condolences to those killed in the shooting and decried the antisemitic motivations of the shooter. The Jewish Community Center offered condolences to the victims' families on its Facebook page. Four days after the shooting, the Jewish Community Center hosted an interfaith service in the Lewis and Shirley White Theatre, called a \\"Service of Unity and Hope.\\" Over 1,300 people attended the service, including U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver and Kansas Governor Sam Brownback. Multiple faith leaders from the surrounding area spoke during the service, which culminated with a symbolic show of unity as the clergy, elected officials and members of law enforcement in attendance were asked to gather on the stage as three candles were lit in memory of the victims. While implicitly acknowledging that the attack claimed no Jewish victims, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent his condolences to the families of those killed in Sunday's shootings at two Jewish centers in Overland Park, Kansas. \\"We condemn the shootings which, according to all the signs, were perpetrated out of hatred for Jews,\\" Netanyahu said the day after the attack. John Lewis has put out a statement: It is deeply tragic that such senseless brutality should occur on the eve of Passover, the time when Jews all over the world remember their liberation from slavery in Egypt thousands of years ago.

Early life and education Eliza Louisa Walker was born in Bolarum, Hyderabad, in 1845. Her father, Alexander Walker, was a doctor from Aberdeenshire who worked for the Bombay Military Department. Her younger brother, Archibald Dunbar Walker, also trained in the medical profession. Registration but no subscription required for limited use. Educated at Cheltenham Ladies' College, she was fluent in German, and had a keen interest in medicine. As she was unable to enrol in any British medical schools, she instead received training and tuition from St. Mary's Dispensary for Women under Elizabeth Garrett. She joined the Society of Apothecaries when it revised its regulations to include those who did not attend medical schools. Walker travelled to Switzerland and was one of the \\"Zurich 7\\" who were the first women to gain a medical degree from the University of Zurich. Registration but no subscription required for limited use. After studying there for four years, she submitted her thesis on blockages of the arteries of the brain (Ueber Verstopfung der Hirnarterien), receiving an MD with distinction in 1872. While at the university, she became the first woman assistant in the Zurich canton hospital's women's ward. She carried on to do a year's postgraduate study in Vienna, before returning to England in 1873. It was around this time that she assumed the name of Dunbar. Career On her return to England in 1873, Walker applied for the position of house surgeon at Bristol Royal Hospital for Sick Children. She was the only female candidate, and the incumbent medical staff informed the hospital's managing committee that they would resign if she were appointed. When she did get the job, two staff immediately left. Five weeks later, a disagreement between Walker and another staff member led to the remainder of the doctors, all male, walking out. Walker remained in post for five days, the only medical practitioner on site, before resigning to save the hospital further embarrassment. Instead, she set up a private practice in Clifton, Bristol, before establishing the Read Dispensary for Women and Children in Hotwells, Bristol in 1876. The King and Queen's College of Physicians decided to allow women who already had foreign degrees to register from 1877. Dunbar registered on 10 January 1877. She managed to add her name to the medical register via this Irish route. Walker held a number of roles in subsequent years, including medical officer for educational facilities, then in 1895, she established the Bristol Private Hospital for Women and Children. Originally the private hospital had space for 12 patients, and focused on the treatment of women by women. In 1906 she published an article in the Bristol Medico-Chirurgical Journal on \\"The new theory and prophylactic treatment of puerperal eclampsia.\\" She continued her work until her death following a fall at her home in Bristol on 25 August 1925.

She attends Ernest Hemingway High School and is friends with Rick Stone, Daisy Watkins, Larry Wade & Virgil Hawkins who is secretly the superhero 'Static'.Static #1 Frieda learns of Virgil‚Äôs secret after supervillain 'Hotstreak' (formally ex-student, Martin \\"Biz Money B\\" Scaponi) tries to kidnap her as a prize for himself. Static finds out and shows up to protect her, but he's quickly defeated. Instead of killing them both, Hotstreak leaves. In tending Static's wounds, Frieda removes his mask and learns Virgil's secret. Frieda takes him to her house and he tells her everything about what led to the fateful night at the \\"Big Bang\\". After Virgil is treated, he challenges Hotstreak to a rematch as Static again and defeats him. Virgil made no secret of his romantic interest in her as she became his only confidante with his identity, but Freida was keeping a secret of her own. Virgil is furious to learn that she was dating his best friend Larry Wade and had kept it from him (thanks in part to his own cluelessness- the rest of their friends knew). Larry later explains to him that Frieda hid the relationship because she didn't want to lose him as a friend. Virgil forgives them both and things return to normal. Though her life is never again normal due to her connection to Static, Frieda suffers a great loss when Larry is killed by his drug suppliers in a drive-by shooting. At Larry‚Äôs funeral, she admits that she is worried about Virgil when he's Static.

The prison housed inmates until 1981 and during the 1980s and 1990s theater plays were organized there. In 2007-2008 the prison was rebuilt into a hotel.  History  Ume√• old prison was one of some 20 provincial prisons designed by Wilhelm Theodor Anckarsv√§rd, who was the architect of F√•ngv√•rdsstyrelsen during the years 1855-1877. These prisons were built with the American Philadelphia system as a model, which amongst other things meant that common cells were replaced by individual cells where prisoners would be able to contemplate their fate. The prison housed a total of 24 cells on two floors which were located along the exterior walls so that everyone got daylight. The prison building also housed offices and residential spaces. The building was one of the few that survived the great fire of 1888. Also the southern wooden palisade survived the fire which give contemporary visitors an idea of the shape of the prison's exercise yard. The then-editor in chief of the local newspaper V√§sterbottens-Kuriren, Gustav Ros√©n (1876-1942), spent three months in prison in 1916. He was convicted of defamation of the city's Stadsfiskal (the city's highest police official). This was the culmination of the so-called Ume√• fights (Ume√•br√•ken), which attracted nationwide attention. The prison is now Ume√•'s oldest surviving stone building and is one of the best preserved prisons in the country. It was in use until 1981 when Ume√• prison was completed. The prison is owned by the National Property Board of Sweden (SFV) and became a national monument in 1992.  Theater  From 1987 and during most of the 1990s the building and the exercise yard was used by an amateur theater group, Grotteatern, and the independent theater group Profilteatern. To the centenary of the devastating fire of 1888 Grotteatern in 1988 created a theater production called The Game of the Great Fire (Spelet om den stora branden) (by Frank Kelber) on the old prison's exercise yard. Both Grotteatern and Profilteatern put up shows during the summers on the exercise yard for a number of years after that.  Hotel  In 2007-2008 the building was converted into a hotel with 23 single rooms, 2 family rooms and one double room with a conference room for meetings and celebrations that can accommodate up to 50 people. It offers made beds with communal showers and toilets, and socializing areas. In the annex on the yard is the german styled brasserie \\"Zillers\\".

Life  Her interest in botany and zoology started at a young age, inspired by regular trips to the Amsterdam zoo. She attended the University of Amsterdam in 1880, where she was made to do her laboratory work in a room separate from the male students. Some of her greatest work comes from the Siboga Expedition, considered the most important expedition for marine phycology in the western Pacific for the nineteenth century. She ventured with her husband, Max Weber. These travels brought about numerous discoveries, including entire new genera of algae, such as Periphykon, Exophyllum, and Microphyllum. Much of her discoveries from this trip are documented in her monograph Corallinaceae (1904), and her four-volume Liste des algues du Siboga (1913-1928). Some of her discoveries came during earlier expeditions to northern Norway and the East Indies. She discovered the genus Phytophysa and a form of symbiosis between algae and sponges before she left for Siboga. Much of her later work was done in her small home laboratory Huis Eerbeek, where several botanists would visit for consultation. Outside of marine biology, she worked with community child-care centers in Amsterdam. She received several awards for her work, including one of the country's highest honors, the Chevalier de l'ordre d'Orange-Nassau, and an honorary doctorate from the University of Utrecht. The bird species Dicaeum annae was named in her honour. She died on October 29, 1942, at the age of 90. An excerpt from Dr. Weber-van Bosse's The Corallinaceae of the Siboga - expedition: ‚ÄúThe Siboga had vainly tried to find a good anchorage on the east-side of Saleyer: the night advanced rapidly and therefore Commander Tvdeman resolved to anchor for the night on the above named coral bank, where he was sure to find from 8‚Äî10 m. water. How great was our astonishment the next morning when coming on deck, we saw a distinct red colour at the bottom of the sea regularly interrupted by narrow white bands. It was no coral bank on which we were lying but an enormous bank of Lithothamnia. That gave a red colour to the bottom of the sea,‚Äù (Page 6). Published 1904.

The Blue and Gold Marching Machine performs pre-game and halftime shows at all North Carolina A&T; Aggies Football home games and travels to most away games.  History  The history of the North Carolina A&T; Marching Band can be traced back to the early 20th century. In the school's early history, music was not offered as a course of study. Margaret Falkener is credited with organizing the college's Music Department in 1894. In 1909 Mr. Charles E. Stewart came to the university, then the \\"Agricultural and Mechanical College for the Colored Race,\\" to serve as director of music. Stewart would later go on to compose the school's Alma Mater, \\"Dear A&T;\\". After Stewart's arrival, arts consisting primarily of choral music, unison singing, and band instruction, soon became a requirement in all departments. Charles E. Stewart, director of instrumental and vocal music (1909 to 1917). After Stewart's departure in 1917, W.E. Lew came on as Director of Music until 1933. At that time the music program at the college began to grow. The following year, Lew started the band program as a 50 Piece ensemble. It was not until the 1930s that marching band was offered as an extracurricular activity. During this time, N.C. A&T; was the only Historically Black college in the state of North Carolina with a marching band. A period of band history is unknown, and it is not completely sure if W.E. Lew was the only director of bands for A&T; from 1917 through 1933. After Lew's departure in 1933, the band was taken over by Bernard Lee Mason, from 1933 to 1948. He was a violinist who studied at Oberlin. His impact on the band is unknown as well. In 1940, the college granted its first Bachelor of Science degrees in Instrumental Music in 1940. later in that decade, the marching band was patterned itself after programs found at The University of Michigan and Ohio State. In the 1950s, the director of bands Walter F. Carlson, brought in the idea of dancing during a field show performance. In 1955, the Marching Band reached 135 members, including 66 freshmen. At the time this was the largest marching band in the history of the university. As a result of the growth, the marching band outgrew their current practice and were relocated to a new location inside a renovated Crosby Hall. An early image of the A&M; College Marching Band with Band Director Charles E. Stewart In the mid 1960s the band introduced the concept of majorettes and later incorporated flag twirlers into the ranks. The 1970s saw the A&T; Marching Band gain national attention with several major performances including The Macy's Thanksgiving Parade in New York City and performing at the Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan. In the late 1970s to early 1980s, the band underwent a change in leadership. Dr. Johnny B. Hodge became the directors of the band alongside Jimmy Williams. It was during this era, the marching band gained the ‚ÄúBlue & Gold Marching Machine‚Äù moniker. In the late 1980s and early 1990s the auxiliary units of the Blue and Gold Marching Machine, began to evolve. The group now called \\"The Untouchables.\\" displayed signature elements such as the \\"high step\\" march of the flags and the \\"A&T; Majorette Arch.\\" In 1992, the squad was renamed \\"Golden Delight.\\" and throughout the decade, the ladies began to incorporate dance and flag twirling movements in their shows. The squad soon became known for its versatile nature, in addition to having one of the largest collection of flags and equipment in HBCU bands. Taken from a corps style inspiration, a variety of colored flags were used to accent the music being played by the Blue & Gold Marching Machine, breaking the normal practice of using flags primarily consisting of school's colors. Blue & Gold Marching Machine at the 2012 Macys Thanksgiving Day Parade. In 2003, Dr. Hodge would retire as Director of Bands, and Dr. Kenneth G. Ruff would assume the leadership position. In 2009, the BGMM received their first invitation to appear at the Honda Battle of the Bands, in Atlanta, Georgia. Since then, the band has appeared in Honda, six times. In 2012, the band led the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade in New York City.  Leadership  Directly overseeing the BGMM is Dr. Kenneth G. Ruff In 2003, Ruff replaced the late Dr. Johnny B. Hodge, who served as Director of Bands for four decades before his retirement. As Director of University Bands, Ruff is responsible for not only the BGMM, but also overseeing the organization and planning of the Symphonic bands, Concert bands, Stage band, and Pep bands.

Dr. Ruff is joined by two assistant directors, not only assume the duties of the Director of Bands in their absence, but also oversees other aspects of the band such as the Percussion line, and brass sections. Dr. Thomas Warner, Jr. serves as the Assistant Director of bands for the high brass instruments. Dr. Warner received his bachelor of arts degree in Music Education from Clark- Atlanta University and his Master of Music Education Degree from Florida State University. Dr. Lamon Lawhorn serves as the Assistant Director of Bands for the Percussion Section. His duties include coordinating all aspects of the University Band Percussion Ensembles in rehearsals and field instructions, including the drumline and percussion ensembles. Dr. Lawhorn received his Bachelor of Music Degree in Music Education from Prairie View A&M; University, and was a member of the \\"Marching Storm\\" band. He received his Master of Music Degree in Percussion Performance from the University of Mississippi and his Doctor of Musical Arts degree from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro in Percussion Performance. Dr. Lawhorn is a member of Phi Beta Sigma fraternity, as well as Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia and Kappa Kappa Psi Fraternities. The BGMM also has a host of Student, Graduate Assistants, Clinicians and instructional and administrative staff members that work alongside the Directors and Drum Majors to ensure the seamless operation of the band.  Composition  The BGMM contains numerous woodwind, brass, percussion, and auxiliary members. The band is divided into 12 sections, 10 of which contain instrumentalists. Each section is run by its own section leaders. Woodwind instruments include clarinets known as ebony kings and queens, piccolos essence of silver, and saxophones also known as active. The brass instruments consists of the trumpetbetter known as Scream Machine, mellophonealso known as Sonic Boom, tromboneFrieght Train, euphoniumCrucial Eu, and sousaphone Thundar Brothers. The percussion section, collectively known as the Cold Steel Drumline, contains snare, tenor and bass drums; in addition to cymbal players. Members of the band's auxiliary units include the drum majors and Golden Delight, who serve the roles of majorettes, color guard, and dancers.  Marching style  Traditionally, the Blue & Gold Marching Machine utilizes a variation of the high step marching style. This involves the lifting of the knee with legs directly in front, thighs parallel to the ground, and toes pointed downward. When the leg is elevated, there should be a 90-degree angle with the body and the thigh, and a 90-degree angle with the thigh and the shin. The leg is then lowered, and this is repeated with the other leg. This is informally referred to as the \\"chair step\\". This is also the style commonly found in many HBCU bands. Recently, the band program has introduced into their on-field performances, techniques similar to those seen in modern drum and bugle corps of Drum Corps International (DCI). Commonly referred to as corps style, constantly changing step sizes, forward, backward, and side to side \\"bell-front\\" marching is used to accommodate the different forms the band is creating on the field. The band's auxiliary unit, also known as \\"Golden Delight\\" is a combined unit that serves the purposes of \\"Color Guard,\\" Baton twirlers, and dancers.

She was one of the first women to be appointed to professional positions within the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Charles coauthored several articles on mushrooms while working for the USDA. Education Charles graduated from Mount Holyoke College, and received her PhD from Cornell University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences in 1903. While in school, she primarily studied mycology, but also focused on plant pathology. After graduation, she began to work for the USDA, where she worked for many years in the Office of Mycological Collections and its successors. Career and research During her early career as a mycologist, Charles often worked with Flora Wambaugh Patterson, the first female mycologist in the USDA. During the 1910s and 1920s, they published many coauthored papers. These papers were held in high regard by Charles' and Patterson's contemporaries. This partnership continued until Patterson's death in 1928. Charles was responsible for inspecting many imported plants prior to the Plant Quarantine Act, enacted in 1912. Through inspecting these plants for signs of disease, Charles and her lab were the first to report and categorize potato wart disease. Charles and Patterson became primarily responsible for fungus research with the Pathological Collections after the organization of Plant Disease Survey in 1917. Charles also conducted research and publish articles on the fungal pathogens that North American insects face. Her knowledge of agarics, specifically the identification of edible and poisonous fungi, meant that for many years she was the government expert. Her Some common mushrooms and how to know them published in 1931 and twice revised was still among the most frequently requested publications from the US Department of Agriculture in the mid-1950s. In 1931 she published Introduction to Mushroom Hunting. In addition, she contributed a chapter to a 1935 book on careers for women. Her chapter was entitled \\"The Mycologist.\\" Even after retiring on 30 June 1942, Charles collaborated with other mycologists. However, eventually Charles' eyesight weakened to the point that she could no longer use a microscope but she continued writing. During her career she was author or co-author of over 37 books and scientific papers, as well as assisting other mycologists with descriptions of new species.

It courses through the communities of Corralitos and Freedom, and touches the northernmost part of Watsonville before joining Salsipuedes Creek. Salsipuedes Creek is the lowermost tributary of the Pajaro River, which carries its waters to Monterey Bay and the Pacific Ocean. History On Sunday, October 15, 1769, the Portola expedition's route took them northwestward across today's Corralitos Creek and through a redwood forest. They stopped to camp near a lagoon in the middle of a narrow valley which Father Crespi named Santa Teresa. They left this place in the morning by a northwest course, following the narrow valley where there were many extremely large redwood trees. The lagoon was named Laguna de las Calabasas but is now referred to as Corralitos Lagoon. The lagoon is located on the Rancho Los Corralitos very near its boundary with the Calabasas Rancho just west of Freedom Boulevard and is not part of the Corralitos Creek mainstem. Rancho Los Corralitos was a Mexican land grant given to Jos√© Amesti, a Basque immigrant in 1823. \\"Los Corralitos\\" means \\"the little corrals\\" in Spanish.

It primarily targeted upper-class readers as well as an aspirational middle-class audience, featuring photographs, poems, fiction, and columns by popular authors such as Marie Corelli, Frances Hodgson Burnett, Jack London, and H.G. Wells. The London Season was regularly covered, with visuals of significant society figures and d√©butantes appearing. Fashion trends in Paris and London were frequently discussed as well, particularly by its fashion editor Marian Pritchard. The publication's targeted reader was the \\"New Woman\\", with enlightened ideas on education, health, independence, and employment. More successful than many of its contemporary publications, the magazine sold reasonably well in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. It was a staple of women's reading rooms in public libraries, which were widespread across the UK. Relatively little is known of The Lady's Realms publishing history, as many records were destroyed during the London Blitz. Its end may have been due to the First World War. History Relatively little is known of The Lady's Realms publishing history, as many records of its publisher, Hutchinson, were destroyed during the London Blitz. The first issue was published in November 1896. Its first editor was William Henry Wilkins, a mildly successful novelist who oversaw the publication's editing from 1896 to 1902. Though inexperienced, Wilkins was acquainted with society, being a friend of such figures as the explorer Richard Francis Burton and his wife Isabel Burton. After Wilkins' death in 1905, The Lady's Realm wrote of how \\"the general public are little aware how much of [the magazine's] early success\\" was due to him, and that \\"not a few [contributors who] have since made their names in the world of letters have to thank him for placing their foot on the first rung of the ladder\\". Wilkins' successor as editor is unknown, though Margaret Versteeg and colleagues, who produced an index of the fiction published in The Lady's Realm, detect no changes in editorial judgement in the magazine's tenure after 1902. While the publication mainly featured female writers and feminine topics, all of its editors, most likely, were men. When it debuted, there were more than twenty-nine publications catering to women. Upon the publication of its first issue in 1896, Review of Reviews called it \\"one of the most popular of the magazines that have been started this year\\". The illustrated magazine was produced monthly and cost sixpence (cheap enough for middle-class readers). A typical issue contained 120 pages on quality glossy paper. It sold reasonably well in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada. The magazine was available in women's reading rooms in public libraries, locations that were well distributed across the United Kingdom. The magazine was produced by the English printers Hazell, Watson and Viney. One of its owners, Walter Hazell, was a social reformer and supporter of women's suffrage. A successful firm, Hazell, Watson and Viney also produced the Woman's Signal and the Woman's Gazette, which featured female political and economic topics. The success of The Lady's Realm allowed it to remain published for eighteen years, from 1896 to 1915, much longer than many other contemporary women's periodicals. Thirty-six volumes were produced, from November 1896 to October 1914 (a final volume may have been released in 1915). It is not known why it ended, though Versteeg and her colleagues speculate that World War I may have been a cause, as was the case for other contemporary publications like Young Woman (1891‚Äì1914) and The Girl's Realm (1892‚Äì1915). Content The magazine focused on an upmarket audience, targeting \\"aspirational middle-class and upper-class readers\\". It was also one of the first intended to appeal to the female homeowner. The Lady's Realm featured poems, engravings and photographs, as well as columns by popular authors like Marie Corelli, Frances Hodgson Burnett, Violet Fane, and Mary Elizabeth Braddon. Other authors included Jack London, H.G. Wells, and Mary Eleanor Wilkins Freeman. Fiction, in the form of short stories and serialisations, was released during the magazine's entire span and took up a sizable proportion in issues. A slightly higher percentage of these contributions were written by women. The type of fiction varied, from romances and domestic narratives to fantasies and sociopolitical stories. The publication's targeted reader was the \\"New Woman\\", with enlightened ideas on education, health, independence, and employment. Victorian scholar Kathryn Ledbetter notes that The Lady's Realm was \\"a handbook to the New Woman then being successfully marketed in popular novels... it provides many examples of this ideal in essays, illustrations, fiction, and poetry through the late 1890s\\". Lady's Realm printed an assortment of Court and society news alongside articles on more daily tasks such as food, homemaking, and methods for female readers to earn money. It covered the London Season, displaying photographs of significant society figures and d√©butantes. It claimed to feature over 500 illustrations in each volume. Theatre was another regular topic of the magazine, as was fiction, poetry, and reports on fashion. The Lady's Realms fashion editor Marian Pritchard regularly wrote articles on emerging fashions in London and Paris, and recommended locations where readers could buy them. While still featuring fashion and beauty, it also encouraged careers for women in music, art, business, and millinery. The magazine maintained this blend of topics relatively consistently, though it gradually made minor changes to the proportion it focused on different topics, for instance later focusing less on the nobility and more on the lives of clergymen and governors general. The Lady's Realm was a source of celebrity journalism. Ledbetter writes that the magazine inherited its \\"notions of feminine celebrity\\" from The Woman's World, an earlier publication edited by Oscar Wilde. It published studio photographs of actresses as well as aristocrats, including many in the former group who married into the nobility. The British Royal Family was a frequent subject; one of the magazine's first issues included an article and photographs about the Princess of Wales' childhood, and the publication regularly reported on the movements of Queen Victoria's family.

History The district takes its name from the neighbouring mountain, whose name in turn is believed to be derived from the Yuggera word meaning mountain. However, as Yuggera is not a local indigenous language, it may have been Europeans who introduced the name. The district was first settled in the early 1880s; the Granzein and Soden families were among the early pioneers. Mount Beppo State School opened on 4 September 1893. The chairman of the school was Henry Plantagenet Somerset. In 1929 the school had about 80 pupils. The school closed on 31 December 1972. By 1929, there were two churches at Mount Beppo, the Lutheran church and the Apostolic church, both with associated cemeteries. The Lutheran Church was opened on 12 August 1888. It was extended and re-dedicated in 1930. The first Apostolic Church services were held in 1883 in the home of Mr Carl Casper Meier and the church building was constructed about 1889, but in 1911 the building was relocated higher up the hill and extended. Further extensions occurred at part of the golden jubilee celebrations in 1934. In 2014, only the Apostolic Church remains, but both cemeteries still exist. The town was known for its brass band, which was established in 1898 and celebrated its golden jubilee in 1949. Mount Beppo public hall A public hall was opened at Mount Beppo on 15 March 1930 by Henry Plantagenet Somerset, former Member of the Legislative Assembly for the district, with the then current Member, Ernest Grimstone, in attendance. In the 2011 census, the population of Mount Beppo was 347 people.

Biography  Louis Davids was born in Rotterdam as son of the comedian and caf√© owner Levie David and Francina Terveen (deceased in 1927) in a poor Jewish family of eight children. His parents were performing artists and Louis sang from the age of eight years at all the state fairs with his brother Hakkie who played the Piano. Until he was 13 years old he also performed with his sister Rika in Rotterdam outside of the fair. After an argument with his father he left for England to be an assistant to a Magician. Returning to Rotterdam a year later, returning home with a lot more experience in variety theater. Together with his sister Rika he managed to secure a job outside of the fair, working at the theater Pschorr, on Een reisje langs den Rijn and We gaan naar Zandvoort aan de zee amongst others, him and his sister then moved to Amsterdam to work with theater director Frits van Haarlem in Carr√© with plenty success in creating revues after English fashion. He furthered his success in revue in 1909 working with Henri ter Hall. Detail After Rika married English magician John Weil and moved to England she parted from the successful duo. Louis then formed another duo, after an unsuccessful attempt at a career as a magician, this time with his younger sister Henri√´tte (Heintje). The second Davids duo was a success once more. The husband of Heiintje, Philip Pinkhof, wrote the roles that Davids and his ster would play. In 1906 Louis married Rebecca Kokernoot with whom he had a daughter, he was however unhappy in his marriage. In 1929 Louis Davids appeared in the revue Lach en vergeet with the song which would prpbably become his most popular title De Kleine Man. It was written by Jacques van Tol, with whom Davids would work closely until his death in 1939. Him and Van Tol agreed that Tol would remain anonymous as songwriter after 1929. Despite Davids being from Rotterdam, he was a popular performer of the Amsterdam Jordan repertoire. David was the founder of the career While on tour Davids made the acquaintance of Margie Morris who had moved to the Netherlands in 1913. Up until 1922 Louis and Morris formed the duo \\"He, She and the piano\\", with Morris as the composer. The comedic repertoire soon became well-known across the Netherlands in what is now known as the genre Levenslied. A famous song from this period is De Jantjes which was also released as a silent film in 1922, and as a full motion picture in 1934. Between 1922 and 1926 Davids was the director of the Casino Theater in Rotterdam, but the job of a director does not hold his attention for long.of some big names like Wim Kan and Corry Vonk, Wim Sonneveld and Cabaret Ping Pong. In 1937 Louis Davids had to give up his work at the Kurhaus of Scheveningen-cabaret due to asthma. His early passing at the age of 55 was largely due to asthma. Davids was cremated in Driehuis. His ashes were interred in the columbarium of the crematorium. The remains of his brother Rido and his sister Heintje Davids were later placed next to him.

Her body remained unidentified for 36 years before being identified via DNA analysis and genetic genealogy in April 2018. King was the first unidentified decedent to be identified via this method of forensic investigation. Prior to her 2018 identification, King was informally known as \\"Buckskin Girl\\" and \\"Miami County Jane Doe\\". The first of these two names is in reference to the distinctive tasseled buckskin poncho she was wearing at the time of her discovery. Following the identification of her body, Marcia King's family erected a new headstone at her grave in Riverside Cemetery, inscribed with her actual name. The investigation into her murder is ongoing. Discovery On April 24, 1981, three young men discovered the body of a young Caucasian woman in a ditch alongside Greenlee Road in Newton Township, Troy, Ohio. One of the three men, Greg Bridenbaugh, initially noticed the decedent's distinctive buckskin poncho. Informing one of his companions, Neal Hoffman, to take a look at the coat, Hoffman walked closer to the article of clothing before turning toward Bridenbaugh, stating: \\"Oh my God, there's a woman in that coat!\\" The young woman was lying in a fetal position, on her right side, and without shoes or socks. These members of the public called police to report their discovery. =Autopsy= The decedent's body was autopsied on the afternoon of her discovery. The medical examination revealed she had suffered extensive blunt force trauma to the head and neck, before she had been strangled to death approximately 48 hours before her body was discovered. In addition, her liver had also been lacerated. She had not been subjected to any form of sexual assault. The woman had been between and in height, aged between eighteen and twenty-six, and weighed . She had naturally reddish-brown hair, which was parted in the middle and braided into pigtails on both sides of her head. Her eyes were light brown in color, and she had freckles across her face. In addition, her nose was described as being \\"very pointed\\". The victim also had a ruddy complexion, indicating she had spent a lot of time outdoors in the final weeks or months of her life. The young woman had maintained a high level of personal hygiene. All her teeth, including her wisdom teeth, were in good condition and had no evidence of fillings or other dental work, except for one porcelain crown upon her upper- right incisor. The coroner also noted several scars upon her body, including a vertical scar beneath her chin, with other scars also visible upon one wrist, both arms, and one ankle. =Clothing= The young woman was dressed in blue bell-bottom Wrangler jeans, a brown turtleneck pullover sweater with an orange crisscross design on the front, a white size 32D bra, and a hoodless deerskin poncho with purple lining, which appeared to be handmade. She wore no shoes or socks. No form of identification was located upon her body or at the crime scene. Initial investigation Because the decedent's body was found approximately 48 hours after her death, police were able to obtain her fingerprints and dental information. The dental charts and fingerprints of this decedent yielded no results matching her to any known missing person, and her fingerprints matched no police records, indicating she had no criminal record. Early police efforts to identify this decedent also involved the creation of a composite drawing of her face which was published in local newspapers and broadcast on television networks on April 28, 1981. This initial media publicity surrounding the murder generated approximately two hundred leads. Although all were investigated, all failed to bear fruition. The victim gradually became known as \\"Buckskin Girl\\" in reference to the distinctive tasseled buckskin jacket she was wearing when found. The failure to establish her identity hindered investigators' efforts to solve her murder. As her identity remained undiscovered, investigating authorities came to increasingly believe the reason Buckskin Girl remained unidentified had been due to the fact that she had been murdered far from her hometown. A retired investigator is also known to have opined his belief the decedent was highly unlikely to have originated from the area where she was discovered. Authorities strongly believed Buckskin Girl had been murdered elsewhere and her body discarded beside the road shortly after her death. This conclusion was supported by the fact her bare feet were clean, showing no indication of her having walked upon a dirty surface, and because Interstate 75 is just from where her body was recovered, making the site a convenient and discreet location to discard a body. Police and the media later speculated that she may have been a teenage runaway or a possible victim of a serial killer known to have murdered several sex workers in the region during the 1980s and 1990s. However, her body had not been subjected to any form of sexual assault, indicating she was unlikely to have been a sex worker. The investigation into Buckskin Girl's murder gradually became a cold case, although police and other officials continued to investigate her murder. Her clothing and other physical evidence recovered at the crime scene was retained, and a sample of her blood preserved. Theories =Lifestyle= Investigators theorized that Buckskin Girl had been a runaway teenager, a foster child, or a transient wanderer unlikely to have spent a significant period of time in Ohio prior to her death, although her high quality of personal hygiene strongly indicated that she had not lived as a vagrant. As her body was located close to a town road instead of a highway, the probability of her being a wanderer for a significant amount of time was considered to be negligible. The absence of her footwear at the crime scene led some investigators to believe she may have been murdered by an abusive partner. A 2016 isotope analysis of the decedent's hair and fingernails revealed Buckskin Girl had spent approximately four months in areas within the Southwestern and/or Southeastern United States, as opposed to Ohio, prior to her murder, although the forensic palynology tests had revealed she had most likely originated from either the Northeastern United States or Canada, or had spent a significant amount of time in these regions in the year prior to her murder. Forensic facial reconstruction of Buckskin Girl, depicting her distinctive braided hair. =Link to other murders= Initially, investigators speculated to a potential connection between this decedent and the murder of a 27-year-old woman two months earlier, in February 1981, although police never officially linked these two murders. In 1985, investigators tentatively linked the murder of Buckskin Girl to a nationwide series of murders of caucasian women‚Äîseveral of whom were sex workers or erotic dancers‚Äîknown as the Redhead Murders. However, this theory was eventually disproven. Some investigators also speculated that Buckskin Girl may have been the first of numerous young women murdered by a suspected unidentified serial killer who perpetrated his known murders between 1985 and 2004‚Äîmany of which were of known or suspected prostitutes. This serial killer was suspected to have murdered between seven and ten other young women. All the victims of this suspected serial killer had been murdered via bludgeoning or strangulation, and items of clothing or jewelry were missing from each crime scene. Jewelry and footwear was also missing from the crime scene of Buckskin Girl, and she had been murdered in a similar manner to these victims. However, several elements of evidence were found to contradict this theory. There was no indication Buckskin Girl had engaged in any form of sexual activity prior to her death. In addition, unlike many of the victims of this serial killer, she was markedly well-groomed, with a history of dental care. In 1991, a newly-established task force convened in London, Ohio. This task force was dedicated to the investigation of these unsolved homicides, which had occurred in Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and Illinois and composed of investigators from more than a dozen law enforcement agencies. Further forensic analysis With advances in technology and the increasing use of DNA analysis in criminal investigations, investigators were able to extract the decedent's DNA from the blood sample preserved in 1981. This DNA sample was added to the growing number of law enforcement databases. In 2001, the Miami Valley Regional Crime Laboratory generated a DNA profile of Buckskin Girl, this data was entered into the newly established National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs) database in 2008, through which her fingerprints, dental and DNA information were made nationally accessible to law enforcement. This data was able to conclusively rule out any possibility of 226 missing teenage girls and young women as Buckskin Girl. In 2009, a mitochondrial DNA sample was submitted to the FBI for inclusion within the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS). The following year, the NamUs case management of Buckskin Girl was assigned to Dr Elizabeth Murray, a Cincinnati based forensic anthropologist and professor of biology, who remained active in her pursuit of the decedent's identity. 2016 Forensic facial reconstruction of Buckskin Girl, created by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. =Facial reconstruction= In April 2016, the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children released an updated forensic facial reconstruction of the victim and added her case to their website, depicting her with and without her braided pigtails. This image was extensively distributed via online media, although initially, no significant leads developed. =Pollen analysis= In 2016, the Miami County Police Department approved forensic palynology testing upon the victim's clothing in their efforts to identify her and her murderer(s). This testing was conducted by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency. The results of this testing suggested Buckskin Girl had either originated within the Northeastern United States, or had spent a significant amount of time in this region in the year prior to her murder. Her clothing also contained high levels of soot from exposure to vehicular traffic and/or industrial activity, supporting investigators' initial suspicions she may have been a habitual hitchhiker. In addition, the pollen recovered from her external clothing suggested that, shortly before her murder, she had been in an arid climate such as the Western United States, or northern Mexico. Identification On April 9, 2018, the Miami Valley Crime Laboratory announced they had identified the decedent as 21-year-old Marcia Lenore King of Little Rock, Arkansas. Her identification had been achieved via DNA analysis conducted by the DNA Doe Project, with assistance from the Miami Valley Regional Crime Laboratory. This organization had been contacted by Dr Murray in 2017, and was able to successfully match a sample of King's DNA to a sample submitted for comparison by a first cousin. Her family declined to release a press statement, requesting that their confidentiality be respected. King had last been seen by her family in 1980. She had never officially been reported as a missing person, although her family had continued to search for her. It is believed King had frequently hitchhiked as a means of transportation, as investigators had long theorized prior to her identification. She is also known to have had ties with both the Pittsburg and Louisville, Kentucky districts. Addressing the media to announce the formal identification of Buckskin Girl, a spokesman for the Miami County Police Department informed all present: \\"Law enforcement never forgets. We've had a long journey to [be] where we are today.\\" This spokesman also emphasized the investigation into King's homicide is ongoing, with the primary focus being upon King's movements in the last month of her life, when she was known to have been in both Pittsburgh and Louisville. =Ongoing investigation= In July 2018, the Miami County Police Department announced they had received further information regarding King's actual whereabouts shortly prior to her death. This information included eyewitness accounts placing her in Louisville, Kentucky, approximately 14 days before her death. Six eyewitnesses have also corroborated accounts of King also being in Arkansas shortly before her murder. It is believed the reason she had traveled to Ohio may have been due to her suspected involvement with the religious organization The Way. In February 2020, the Miami County Sheriff's Office announced they had been able to further reconstruct King's whereabouts, and relationships, in the two weeks prior to her murder, adding that as advances in technology now mean Nuclear DNA samples can be retrieved from hair samples missing the actual root, they remained confident hair samples discovered at the crime scene and submitted to a renowned Californian paleogeneticist could yield a Nuclear DNA profile of either her murderer, or an individual she had been in the company of very shortly before her death. Addressing these latest developments, Miami County Sheriff Dave Duchalk stated: \\"We always have hopes to bring justice for homicide victims and their families. We never have, nor will we ever forget, and will continually work the case and, as new technologies are developed, will review our evidence to learn if it is worth re-submitting.\\" Funeral King had been buried as a Jane Doe at Riverside Cemetery in Miami County, Ohio weeks after her death, with several officers assigned to investigate her murder serving as pallbearers at her funeral. Following the identification of her body, King's family chose for her to remain buried within this cemetery, with her stepmother, Cindy Sossoman, explaining her family's belief that it had been God's plan that their daughter was to be murdered and to remain unidentified for so long, they believed King was blessed to have passed away within a community which had shown such consideration and dignity to her while she had remained unidentified. Her parents had long since divorced, and her father, John Wesley Sossoman, had remarried, having several children with his second wife, all of whom had long wondered as to King's whereabouts and welfare. On July 20, 2018, a memorial service for King was held at a chapel in Troy, Ohio. This service was officiated by the Reverend Gregory Simmons. Her new headstone was unveiled at this service. Marcia's father, John, had died on January 5, 2018. Her brother, Daniel King, and half-brother, Jonathan Sossoman, had also died by the time King's identity was discovered. Marcia's stepmother and eight other surviving family members replaced the headstone simply reading \\"Jane Doe\\" with a headstone bearing her actual name at this service, which was attended by over fifty local residents. Describing King's personality, her stepmother described her as a \\"very trusting\\" young woman, before informing all present: \\"Words don't describe the feelings we have for all of you, how you have loved her and taken her in your arms.\\" See also * Cold case * Crime in Ohio * List of formerly unidentified decedents * The Doe Network * Unidentified decedent * List of solved missing persons cases * Unsolved murders Notes References Cited works and further reading    * External links * Contemporary news article pertaining to the 2018 forensic identification of Buckskin Girl * DNA Doe Project webpage pertaining to the identification of Buckskin Girl * 1980s missing person cases 1981 in Ohio 1981 murders in the United States Deaths by beating in the United States Deaths by strangulation in the United States Female murder victims Forensic palynology Incidents of violence against women Missing person cases in Arkansas Unsolved murders in the United States Violence against women in the United States ","title":"Murder of Marcia King"},{"id":"42484142","title":"2014 Coppa Italia Final"},{"id":"42484205","text":"Kai Ka'us I (), was the ruler of the Paduspanid dynasty from 1168 to 1184. He was the brother and successor of Shahrivash.  Biography  Kai Ka'us was the son of Hazarasp I. During his youth, he fled for unknown reasons from his brother Shahrivash, and began serving the Bavandid ruler Shah Ghazi Rustam IV. Kai Ka'us quickly rose into high ranks, and after the death of Shah Ghazi Rustam's vassal Kiya Buzurg in 1156, he was appointed as the successor of the latter. After the death of Shahrivash in 1168, Kai Ka'us quickly took the opportunity to invade Paduspanid territory, where he defeated a prince named Namavar ibn Bisutun, and crowned himself as the ruler of the Paduspanid dynasty. However, after having gained control of his family's domains, Kai Ka'us, along with a local ruler named Fakhr al-Dawla Garshasp, revolted against Shah Ghazi Rustam's successor Hasan I. Hasan I shortly sent an army against the latter, which was, however, defeated by Kai Ka'us. Hasan I then himself invaded the domains of Kai Ka'us, and captured him. However, Hasan I chose to pardon Kai Ka'us. Hasan I later died in 1173, and was succeeded by his son Ardashir I. Ardashir I later took Kai Ka'us' domains, and ordered his general Mubariz al-Din Arjasf to attack Kai Ka'us. Sometime later, Kai Ka'us' son Justan died, and only his 1 year old grandson Zarrinkamar survived, whom Ardashir I agreed to raise and make ruler of the Paduspanid dynasty when the latter had grown up. Kai Ka'us shortly died in 1184. After his death, the nobles of the Paduspanid capital of Ruyan made his nephew Hazarasp II the new ruler of the dynasty.

He has worked with Death Cab For Cutie, Bob Mould, Superchunk, Sparklehorse, Jars of Clay, Yellow Ostrich, The Lonely Forest, Field Report, Someone Still Loves You Boris Yeltsin, and Elsinore. Originally from Wisconsin, Sorenson spent his early career at Smart Studios in Madison, later moving to Portland, Oregon to become an independent producer and engineer. He releases electronic music, collaborations, and remixes under the name Beaunoise, and is a part of \\"band- like\\" project, Exurbs. Life and career =Early life= Beau Sorenson was born and grew up in northwest Wisconsin. Beau took piano and guitar lessons, played in his high school band, and tried his hand playing in a few bands when he was a teenager, but didn't take the normal garage band route to becoming a recording engineer. Living in a remote area provided him with space for making much noise taking apart and building all types of electronics, and for experimenting with four-track recorders, synthesizers, and drum machines. Sorenson attended Wisconsin Indianhead Technical College from 1999‚Äì2001, obtaining an Associate of Science degree in IT and computer support. Later he moved to Madison to study music recording at Madison Media Institute. About having attended a recording school, Sorenson said, \\"there are far more people graduating from recording school than there are opportunities. On the other hand, the old model of interning at a studio is becoming extinct, so there isn't a clear path to being a recording person. Has there ever been, though? It's always been a little strange and convoluted. When I worked at Smart, Mike [Zirkel] always said, \\"You don't choose to make records ‚Äì it chooses you.\\"\\" =Production career= Sorenson began working at Smart Studios in 2004 after one of the other engineers put him in touch with studio manager Mike Zirkel, who convinced him to choose Smart over an internship in Los Angeles. The first album he assisted on was Garbage's Bleed Like Me. \\"I was running around, getting coffee, cleaning toilets ‚Äì all the classic studio intern duties,\\" Sorenson said. \\"I was so nervous, but really excited at the same time. And I really loved that place, too: I'd find any excuse to stay late, to hang out, whatever I could just to be there. [...] Eventually, I started working on my own projects, but I'd still assist on bigger projects that came through. This was a great way to learn how to (and how not to) make a record, and I avoided a lot of pitfalls by watching and helping other people struggle through them.\\" While at Smart, he worked with bands like Death Cab For Cutie, Sparklehorse, Garbage, Tegan and Sara, Someone Still Loves You Boris Yeltsin, The Ericksons, Mr. Gnome, Cougar, Hotel Lights, and Pale Young Gentlemen. During his time at Smart, Sorenson was also an instructor at Madison Media Institute from 2008 to May 2010, teaching audio engineering classes. When Smart Studios closed in 2010, Sorenson decided to go freelance and move to Portland, Oregon. He shifted most of his equipment to portable options (like the Studer 169 console) so he could bring his studio wherever the bands wanted to go, including more secluded locations like cabins, houses, churches, or barns. As a freelance engineer, he has recorded and mixed at: Alberta Court, April Base, Avast!, Black Door Studio, Chrome Attic, Different fur, Electrical Audio, Flora Recording, Hall of Justice, Hyde Street, Jackpot!, London Bridge, Overdub Lane, Pogo, Soma, Sound City, Tiny Telephone, The Tannery, The Warehouse, Two Sticks, and Type Foundry. =Beaunoise= Sorenson also produces electronic music, collaborates with others, and creates remixes, which he releases under the moniker Beaunoise. This work serves as a laboratory for exploring and inventing new techniques and processes that can be used in his work as an engineer. In 2013, he gathered a number of his remixes, including some created with Clive Tanaka, into a cassette album entitled Remixes, which was then released on label Crash Symbols. All three of his Ambient series were released on Burger Records, with Ambient One and Ambient Three (which was released April 23, 2014) being lighter works than \\"dark droney\\" Ambient Two. Though Beaunoise pieces are generally not performed live for audiences, Sorenson did perform some works live as Beaunoise on February 19, 2013 at the Experimental Portland Showcase. =Exurbs= Exurbs is a \\"band-like\\" project of drone and krautrock-inspired instrumental music that Beau Sorenson started with friends Jeff Sauer (Czarbles), and Andrew Fitzpatrick (All Tiny Creatures, Volcano Choir). Their first cassette was recorded over a year and a half at Smart Studios and was released in 2011 by label Zod Records. August 2013, they began recording of their second album at April Base in Fall Creek, Wisconsin.

He remained on the island until 1540, before returning to Lisbon. At the end of that year, he was ordered by the King to the fortress in Santa Cruz do Cabo de Gu√©, which was encircled by Moors, by the time of his arrival in December. He distinguished himself in combat, but was eventually imprisoned. Following two years of captivity, he paid his own ransom, and eventually returned to Lisbon, where he was compensated with his Captaincy privileges. Yet, he remained at Corte until 1552, the year when French pirates and corsairs threatened many of the C√¢mara holdings: his familial ties insisted on his presence. By order of the King, he sailed for S√£o Miguel where he remained until 1554, fortifying the defences, including the Fort of S√£o Br√°s in Ponta Delgada. =Later life= Following volcanic eruptions in 1563, he returned to the islands in 1565 and remained until 1573, when he returned to Portugal, leaving his son, Rui, as the Captain-General in his place.Carlos Melo Bento (2008), p.34Rui Gon√ßalves da C√¢mara, eventually departed for Lisbon, as well, hoping to join the ill-fated North African adventure of King Sebastian, but who did not make it on the expedition. Much like his father before him, Rui would be ordered by the King to return to S√£o Miguel in 1576. Manuel da C√¢mara died in Lisbon on 13 March 1578; his body was laid to rest in Ponta Delgada, where he received a funeral befitting a member of the monarchy.

She sank on 28 January 2018, after hitting the breakwater at Bandar-e Anzali on 10 January. Design and construction On 23 February 2010, the Iranian media reported that the production of the ship had commenced. The ship has the ability to carry helicopters, anti-ship missiles, surface-to-air missiles, torpedoes, modern guns and air defence guns. The vessel is also equipped with electronic warfare devices.Iranian Students' News Agency (ISNA). Destroyer production line inaugurated in Iran (Wave II). 23 February 2007. The warship uses a new modern flat-type, phased array radar, which was being tested in 2011. The development of this new device took more than it was anticipated and delayed the launch of the vessel to March 2013. The fire control radar is also replaced by a modern radar dome. New sensors, e-warfare devices and radars are also installed on the vessel, further enhancing its capabilities. The frigate has a central attack and warfare management command control system integrated inside its systems, allowing the ship to track 100 surface, sub-surface, and air targets simultaneously and choose the best in-order to attack them. Service history Damavand, previously known as Velayat, was launched in March 2013 in the Caspian Sea near the northern port city of Bandar-Anzali. Damavand tested its engines and performed a SAT test in the Caspian Sea from 16 to 17 July 2014. Damavand officially joined the Navy on 9 March 2015. On 10 January 2018 Damavand was based out of Bandar-Anzali on the Caspian Sea. It is believed probable that the incident was the result of navigational error, affected by a strong storm in the area which creating high wave heights and low visibility in the area. During the incident six members of the ship's crew fell overboard. Four of those crew members were later rescued, two are currently considered missing by media sources. The Iranian Navy declined to confirm the reporting. There has been little information released in reference to the cause of the grounding, with exception to statements of wave height and visibility caused by the storm at the time of the grounding. A video circulated in the Iranian media shows Damavand had fully sunk in the Caspian Sea a couple of weeks after it suffered damages during the stormy weather of Anzali Port. This will possibly result in the ship being struck from the active commission list of Moudge-class frigates. On 5 August 2019, Rear Admiral Hossein Khanzadi, Commander of the Islamic Republic of Iran Navy, was quoted (by Jane's Defence Weekly) as saying, \\"The destroyer has been fully revived and this has been done in 18 months.\\" The admiral also said that the ship would be returned to service before the end of the current year (of the Iranian calendar; 19 March 2020). However, the hull of a similar ship has been seen in satellite images, being built at the Caspian Sea port of Bandar-e Anzali.  In popular culture  Iranian singer-songwriter Amir Tataloo filmed music video of his song Energy Hastei () aboard Damavand, that became viral amidst the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.

The rivalry is fueled by the proximity of the schools to each other, as the rivalry is known for being the closest geographical rivalry in US college sports. The campuses of the two schools share a physical border, and the teams' home courts are mere blocks away from each other, as Drexel's Daskalakis Athletic Center is located at 34th and Market Street, and Penn's historic Palestra is located on 33rd Street south of Walnut Street. The series was originally played at the Palestra every year until 2015 with the exception of the 2008 game, when Penn played at Drexel University for the first time in team history. Beginning in 2015, the location began alternating between the two schools. The teams began playing against each other annually during the 1996‚Äì97 NCAA basketball season. Previous to this season, the teams faced each other only eight times. Seven of those games were during the 1920s, where Penn won all seven, and the eighth game was in 1988, where Drexel won 70‚Äì69. Results *The game on December 19, 1928 was scheduled to be the first game played at Drexel, in the newly constructed Curtis Hall, however construction was not completed in time and the game was moved to Palestra. *In 2008, at the first game in the series to be played at the Daskalakis Athletic Center, the game was featured on ESPN Hoops Marathon and tipped off at 10 a.m. Hiatus in 2011, 2013‚Äì2014, 2017‚ÄìPresent In the 2011‚Äì12 season, Drexel and Penn did not play against each other, ending a 14-year streak due to a dispute over where the game should be played. In 1997, the teams agreed to play their games at the Palestra, as it is where many Philadelphia Big 5 and City 6 games are generally played at. However, since then, Drexel's basketball team had greatly improved, and Drexel favored changing the series structure so that the location would alternate between the schools each season. The teams resumed play in the 2012‚Äì13 season at The Palestra, but did not play again until the 2015‚Äì16 season, when Penn agreed to resume the series at Drexel. From that point forward, the location of the game would supposedly alternate between The Palestra and Daskalakis Athletic Center each season, although after Drexel returned to the Palestra in the 2016‚Äì17 season, the teams did not continue the series. Other Events The schools also occasionally face each other in other sports, including lacrosse, women's basketball, and field hockey. On March 11, 2014, Drexel and Penn faced each other in the first round of the 2014 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship. The teams earned automatic bids by winning each of their conference tournaments, and marked Drexel's first invitation to the national championship.

The film, which was directed by Jack King, shows Donald Duck having many troubles with the outdoors when he goes on vacation. Plot Donald Duck is taking a vacation in a canoe. He is shown to walk over rocks while playing a guitar when the canoe cannot go, since his feet and legs are sticking out the bottom of it. While playing his guitar, he unwittingly goes through a small waterfall. He coughs and shakes water off, and gets a fish in his instrument, but he quickly calms down. However, just as he continues playing he goes over a waterfall and falls to the bottom. After an angry outburst, he emerges from the water with the canoe on his back like a turtle's shell. Arriving at his campsite, he pulls a lever which ejects all the supplies he brought along. He then converts the canoe into a tent and puts down a sign that says Camp Peaceful. He gets out a folding chair with an umbrella, but has trouble making it fold. His actions eventually cause the chair to come up below him, put the umbrella inside his shirt, and catapult him into the lake and a patch of cattail grass. He emerges with grass on his head like an Indian warrior's dress and stalks back to the campsite underwater. As he continues to struggle with the chair, a group of chipmunks are attracted by the noise and come to investigate. Donald finally gets the chair to work and settles down for a nap. However, unknown to him, the chipmunks are using this as an opportunity to steal his food, and begin carrying it off. Donald doesn't notice them until two of them carrying a pineapple walk below his bottom, poking it with the pineapple's stalks. Donald squawks in pain and gets trapped in the chair again. When he sees the chipmunks taking his food, he gets angry. After getting hit in the face with a banana, he chases after the chipmunks, using the chair as legs for running. During the chase, Donald's umbrella closes on him, giving the chipmunks time to escape, but they wake up a sleeping grizzly bear in the process which proceeds to eat all of Donald's food. An incensed Donald finally breaks free only to discover what appears to be the chipmunks eating his food. He smashes all the food away and is left clinging to the snout of the bear. After seeing that the \\"chipmunk's mouth is too big,\\" he realizes that's it's a bear and runs away. The bear chases Donald across a log, where Donald thinks he's safe but ends up standing on top of the bear. The bear swipes at him and chases him to a tree. Donald climbs up the tree but the bear responds by clawing down the bark. Donald slides down the now-slippery trunk to the bottom. The bear rips away Donald's part of the tree with its paw and Donald (who thinks he is still with the rest of the tree) tries to climb up again but realizes it's only thin air and falls down, almost into the bear's mouth. He escapes just in time and the bear chases him until it trips. Donald quickly breaks camp, gets into his canoe, and rows away as fast as he can.

Announced as an iPad title in September 2012, the game has been in development since mid-2011, with music by composers Lisa Gerrard and Michael Allen. Between April and May 2014, a successful Kickstarter campaign was started to help fund a port to Steam and GOG.com, as well as stretch goals to bring the game to Android and Windows tablets. The game was chosen to receive additional support from governmental funding agencies Screen Australia and Film Victoria. Set in a fantasy world filled with anthropomorphic animals, up to four players assume the role of a hero chosen among their clan to take part in a campaign to become the next king or queen. The game features turn- based board-game mechanics that revolve around the use of dice and cards that are drawn from a deck, with each player's actions influencing the outcome. Gameplay Armello recreates a traditional tabletop role-playing game, based on a fantasy world populated by anthropomorphic creatures. Armello is a digital simulation of a traditional fantasy tabletop role-playing game utilizing virtual dice and cards which allow the player to carry out specific actions. Up to four players assume the role of a Hero character that represents a specific animal clan, each with their own unique strengths, with the ultimate goal to storm the castle and become the new king or queen of the kingdom. The playing board area is divided into hexagon-shaped tiles that contain randomly generated features such as dungeons to explore, quests to complete, rival heroes to battle, or settlements to capture. As the game progresses, players can acquire currency to purchase additional abilities for their hero using a talent tree system specific to each character. The game uses a turn-based system where players are allowed to perform actions such as equip items and purchase talents during another player's turn to reduce downtime. Cards and dice are used to directly interact with the game world, and form the basis for the game's combat system. Players use cards they draw from a deck to cast spells, recruit followers, heal wounds, or use items that grant special abilities. Cards may also be played as \\"Perils\\" which can be laid on specific tiles to act as traps for other heroes or used immediately in combat, and other cards may be used to forge temporary alliances. Armello also features a day/night cycle where certain heroes gain advantages based on the time of day, and certain groups of enemies only appear in either the darkness or light. There are four alternative paths to victory and every hero is best suited for reaching a particular one, but every victory condition can be reached with every hero. Plot and characters The game takes place in the \\"dark fairy tale\\" Kingdom of Armello, a world filled with anthropomorphic animals separated into numerous clans. When the current king becomes corrupted by a dark force called the Rot, representatives from these factions rise up to embark on a journey to become the new king or queen in his stead. A typical combat result screen, here featuring the characters of Thane the wolf and Barnaby the rabbit. While the game features eight heroes available to all players at launch, more will be added to the game over time. The initial characters include Thane, The Winter Wolf, a lupine warrior who carries a large sword; River the Howling Arrow, a wolf Archer; Amber, The Far Seeker, a rabbit armed with a short sword and umbrella; Barnaby Screwloose, a rabbit with custom made armor and a hammer; Mercurio, The Grinning Blade, a sneaky rat with a rapier; Zosha the Whirlwind, a rat assassin with a join-able pair of daggers; Sana, The Forest Sister, a bear who carries a staff of magic power; and Brun Oakbreaker, a Bear Shaman with a totemic club staff. In Armello: Usurpers, four more heroes are introduced including Elyssia the Wardress of Warrens (Rabbit), Sargon the Death Teller (Rat), Magna the Unbroken (Wolf), and Ghor the Wyldkin (Bear). In Armello: Rivals, four more heroes join the others including Hargrave Thunder Earl (Rabbit), Griotte Butcher Baroness (Rat), Yordana The Devourer (Bear) and Fang The Exiled (Wolf). Four more characters collectively called The Bandit Clan, which includes Twiss the squirrel thief, Sylas the otter butcher, Scarlet the fox revolutionary, and Horace the badger Knight, are also available as paid DLC as of Spring 2017. Development Armello was announced in September 2012 as the debut title from Australian independent game studio League of Geeks, originally as an iPad-exclusive title to be released the following year before experiencing delays. The 15-person development includes four directors: Ty Carey, Trent Kusters, Blake Mizzi, and Jacek Tuschewski, whose total experience in the game industry includes 40 years and 50 released projects. Kusters stated that he was inspired to create the game after hearing about the success Greg Kasavin had in producing Bastion with such a small team. League of Geeks began work on the game after eight months of prototypes on paper, with an additional 18 months of work to arrive at the pre-alpha build. An early version of the game was showcased at the Game Developers Conference in April 2013, and later at the inaugural PAX Australia the following July. In December 2011 and October 2013, League of Geeks received assistance funding from the state government of Victoria. At the 2012 Sydney Film Festival, it was announced that Armello was one of 14 projects chosen from a pool of 89 to receive additional support from the Australian federal government funding body Screen Australia. When describing the title's genre and influences, Kusters pitched it as \\"imagine Magic: The Gathering meets Final Fantasy Tactics,\\" and \\"Game of Thrones meets Kung Fu Panda,\\" also mentioning that it features components of board games, trading card games, and strategy role-playing games. The game was also said to appeal to fans of Redwall and The Dark Crystal, as well as the animated works of Studio Ghibli, particularly Spirited Away, which was cited as a large influence on Armellos art direction and story. The team launched a 30-day Kickstarter project page beginning in April 2014 to garner an additional AUD$200,000 to help produce the game full-time, as well as lend support to a release on Windows, OS X, and Linux platforms using the Steam service. A stretch goal was also added, extending possible support to Android and Windows tablets. A tentative release date of March 2015 was also set. On 8 May 2014, the campaign reached $305,360, successfully funding the game, as well as hitting all extended stretch goals, which included releases for the two additional platforms, more languages, in-game cards, and a winter-based map tileset.  Release  Armello launched on Steam Early Access on 22 January 2015. On 26 May 2015, a PlayStation 4 version was announced. The full version of the game was released for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux and PlayStation 4 on 1 September 2015. An Xbox One version, and a paid expansion which adds four new heroes, were later announced in April 2016, with the Xbox version and the Usurpers expansion both released later that year on 30 August 2016. In December 2015, League of Geeks partnered with IndieBox, a monthly subscription box service, to produce a custom-designed, physical version of Armello. This limited, individually-numbered edition included a flash-drive with a DRM-free copy of the game, the official soundtrack, an instruction manual, Steam key, and several custom-made collectible items. =Downloadable content= The first package of downloadable content titled \\"Armello: Usurpers\\", adding four new heroes to the game, was released on 30 August 2016 about a year after the game's release. The content was limited to the console versions of the title and through Steam for personal computers. Though they had planned on offering the content to all users since the Kickstarter, including those with DRM-free versions of the game as through GOG.com, League of Geeks found that being able to support the content on the DRM-free platform was a task beyond their resources. Co-found Trent Kusters stated \\"given infinite resources and time we could undertake the task of rewriting the underlying architecture at the core of this decision, but that's straight up not feasible for a vast number of reasons that are unique to [League of Geeks], Armello, where we're standing right now and where we see Armellos future.\\" League of Geeks allowed those consumers that had purchased the DRM-free version to request refunds of the game because of this decision. Reception According to Metacritic, Armello has received \\"generally favourable\\" reviews on Windows and Xbox One, and \\"mixed or average\\" reviews on PlayStation 4 and iOS.

At the traditional banquet on 25 May, the usual loyal toasts were made and Mr H.R. Oldfield remarked in his speech upon the international nature of philately and ventured to prophesy that philately would be prosperous when Esperanto had been forgotten. He also noted the presence of ladies, for the first time, at the event. Medals The exhibition was notable for having a special class of awards for exhibits by ladies, the Gold medal in that class going to Mrs E.B.S. Benest for her Brazil and the Silver to Mrs Herxheimer for her General Collection from 1890. The Earl of Crawford won the Championship Cup for his Great Britain, while Gold medals were awarded to Leslie L. R.

The Gazi-Husrev-beg Library is a public library in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina founded in 1537, and is part of a larger complex with Gazi Husrev- beg Medresa. It holds one of the most important collections of Islamic mansucripts in Bosnia-Herzegovina, including many originally donated by Gazi Husrev-beg. The collection survived through Bosnian war and Siege of Sarajevo. The library also holds a sizable number of books, journals, newspapers, documents and photographs. Foundation In 1537, the Ottoman Empire governor of Bosnia, Gazi Husrev-beg, established a madrasa for the education of the people of the region. In the charter for its creation, the governor stipulated that \\"whatever money remains from the construction of the madrasa shall be used for purchasing good books, which will be used in the madrasa by readers, and for copying from them by those who engage in science.\\"Jahiƒá, M. (2013). The Gazi-Husrev-beg Library, AMOSGRAF, Sarajevo. The library and the madrasas functioned for over three hundred years as one unit until, in 1863, the library was moved to its own room, where it stayed until 1935 when it was moved to the Sarajevo Mufti‚Äôs office outside the Careva Mosque. The library continued to grow until the whole building of the former mufti's office was used for housing the library's holdings. It remained in this location until the start of the Siege of Sarajevo in 1992.Gazi-Husrev-beg Library, Hazine, retrieved from http://hazine.info/2013/12/23/ghb_library/ Destruction and safekeeping In 1697, an Austrian general Eugene of Savoy, raided the library, destroying many historical works. Some of the most important documents to be lost were the Sarajevo court registers, chronicalling land ownership, marriages, and other important legal events. During the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s, much of the city of Sarajevo was under siege by forces of the Army of the Republika Srpska. Many of the printed books were moved to the Careva Mosque for safekeeping. The manuscripts were moved eight times during the nearly four-year siege of the city. The 500 most valuable manuscripts were placed inside the vaults of the Privredna Banka, where they were hidden. They remained there until the siege was lifted. Rebuilding The Gazi-Husrev-beg Library re-opened on January 15, 2014, after 10 years of construction.

Since the Siege of Sarajevo and the restoration of the library, several important Islamic manuscripts have been added to the library's collection. Some of the most important of these manuscripts are the following: * The Ihya‚Äôulum al-din is the oldest manuscript in the library and was written by Abu Hamid Muhammed al-Gazali (d. 1111) in Arabic. * The Diwan of Hafiz Shirazi (d. 1389), written in Persian, is illuminated with beautiful Islamic miniatures. * The Tuhfat al-ahrar is a didactic poem written by the Persian writer Nur al-Din ‚ÄòAbd al-Rahman Jami (d. 1486), and is one of the most representative pieces of Islamic calligraphy found in the collection.

The \\"sensitive\\" of SSE referred to the possibility that sites searched might have contained chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) materials inherent in WMDs. Later, an effort was made to refer to the practice as \\"SE\\" (site exploitation) instead of \\"SSE\\" because sites were still being searched and exploited, but more generally for intelligence gathering and not with the intent of locating WMDs. The main intent of site exploitation is to extract as much potential intelligence as possible from the site of a raid or point of interest in hopes that the data collected will lead to further enemy targets or answer priority intelligence requirements (PIR). A secondary benefit is that this data can be used to help prosecute criminals, if done correctly in accordance with local law. Site exploitation consists of the following phases: securing the site (usually through a raid), documenting the site, searching the site, prioritizing exfiltration, and exploiting materials found. Appearances in media The term SSE was used in the 2012 film Zero Dark Thirty, when Navy SEALs attempt to retrieve as much data as possible from the computers and paper files of Osama Bin Laden once they've secured his compound in Abottabad. It was also used in the 2018 series Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan, when CIA Special Activities agents are discussing the plan to infiltrate Mousa Bin Suleiman's compound in season 1 episode 7.

He remained a prominent member of the Chinese community and went on to lead a distinguished career in banking and diplomacy. Early life Chang was born in 1860, in what is now Xiangshan, Guandgong Province, China (though records from Yale list his birth date as December 20, 1859). Chang's father died when he was 10 years old.Lani Ah Tye Farkas, Bury My Bones in America (1998), p.87. =Chinese Educational Mission= In 1872, Chang was selected to travel to the United States as part of the Chinese Educational Mission. He arrived in the United States at thirteen years old and lived with American families.Thomas E. LaFargue, China's First Hundred: Educational Mission Students in the United States, 1872-1881 (1987), p. 173. Chang attended Hartford Public High School in Connecticut from 1876 to 1878. Beginning in 1878, Chang studied in a college preparatory program at the Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. Chang graduated from the Phillips Academy in 1879, giving an English oration at his commencement ceremony titled \\"The Influence of Greece beyond Greece.\\"Lani Ah Tye Farkas, Bury My Bones in America (1998), p. 87-88. In 1879, Chang began studies at Yale College (now Yale University). In 1881, however, the Chinese government recalled the Chinese Educational Mission students back to China.Lani Ah Tye Farkas, Bury My Bones in America (1998), p. 89. Legal Studies and Legal Career Hong Yen Chang did not remain in China for long, though. He returned to the United States on his own accord and began studies at Columbia Law School in 1883.Lani Ah Tye Farkas, Bury My Bones in America (1998), p. 90. He graduated with honors from Columbia Law School in 1886. He received \\"high markings from the examiners\\" and had unanimous recommendation for bar admission.Naturalizing a Chinaman: Hong Yen Chang's Struggles to be Admitted to the Bar, New York Times (Nov. 19, 1887), available at https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1887/11/19/106187659.pdf. At the time of Hong Yen Chang's graduation, the New York State Bar required applicants to be United States citizens. But the Chinese Exclusion Act barred Hong Yen Chang from citizenship. The New York Supreme Court, General Term, initially opposed Hong Yen Chang's admission to the New York State Bar. (Prior to their decision, Hong Yen Chang was already naturalized by Judge Van Hossen on November 11, 1887, in New York.A Full Citizen: Hong Yen Chang Applies for Admission to the Bar, San Francisco Call (May 17, 1890), p. 3, available at http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d;=SFC18900517.2.50#.) However, the New York State Legislature passed an act that allowed Hong Yen Chang to apply again to the bar.Ch. 249, \\"An Act for the relief of Hong Yen Chang\\" in N.Y. State, Laws of the State of New York (1887), p. 312. The act, \\"An Act for the relief of Hong Yen Chang,\\" reads: :Section 1. The General Term of the first department of the supreme court of this State is hereby authorized to waive the alienage of Hong Yen Chang, a native of China, but now a resident of the city, county and State of New York, and to regularly admit and license him to the practice as an attorney and counselor at law in all the courts of this State, on his passing in a satisfactory manner the usual examination for the admission of attorneys and counselors. The New York Supreme Court, General Term admitted Chang to the New York State Bar on May 17, 1888. The New York Times hailed him as the first admitted Chinese lawyer in the United States. In re Hong Yen Chang Soon after Chang's admission to the New York State Bar, Chang moved West to California and sought admission to the California State Bar. His motion to practice law in California reached the California Supreme Court in 1890. Under the California Code of Civil Procedure at the time, \\"Every citizen of the United States . . . who has been admitted to practice law in the highest court of a sister state . . . may be admitted to practice in the courts of this State upon the production of his license and satisfactory evidence of good character; but the court may examine the applicant as to his character.\\"Cal. Civ. Proc. ¬ß 279 (Deering 1890) (italics added). In support of his eligibility to practice law in California, Chang submitted his license to practice law in New York and \\"a certificate of naturalization, issued by the court of common pleas of the city of New York, November 11, 1887.\\" The state Supreme Court denied his motion to practice law in California, finding the naturalization certificate issued by New York invalid under the Chinese Exclusion Act. The court held: :We are, therefore, of opinion that the certificate of naturalization presented in this case was issued without authority of law, and is void, it being conceded that the holder of it is a person of Mongolian [sic] nativity. In 2011 members of the U.C. Davis Asian Pacific American Law Students Association, with the assistance and supervision of Prof. Gabriel Chin, petitioned the Supreme Court of California to grant Chang posthumous admission to the State Bar of California. On March 16, 2015 the Court granted that petition. :[I]t is past time to acknowledge that the discriminatory exclusion of Chang from the State Bar of California was a grievous wrong. It denied Chang equal protection of the laws; apart from his citizenship, he was by all accounts qualified for admission to the bar. It was also a blow to countless others who, like Chang, aspired to become a lawyer only to have their dream deferred on account of their race, alienage, or nationality. And it was a loss to our communities and to society as a whole, which denied itself the full talents of its people and the important benefits of a diverse legal profession. More than a century later, Chang's descendants and the Asian Pacific American Law Students Association at the University of California, Davis School of Law have sought to right this wrong. Even if we cannot undo history, we can acknowledge it and, in so doing, accord a full measure of recognition to Chang's pathbreaking efforts to become the first lawyer of Chinese descent in the United States. The people and the courts of California were denied Chang's services as a lawyer. But we need not be denied his example as a pioneer for a more inclusive legal profession. In granting Chang posthumous admission to the California Bar, we affirm his rightful place among the ranks of persons deemed qualified to serve as an attorney and counselor at law in the courts of California.In re: HONG YEN CHANG on admission, S223736 (2015). Later life Chang married Charlotte Ah Tye on March 14, 1897, in San Francisco. Between 1888 and 1895, Chang worked for the Chinese Consulate in San Francisco as an advisor.Lani Ah Tye Farkas, Bury My Bones in America (1998), p. 91. He then worked for the Yokohama Specie Bank of Japan in San Francisco. In 1907, Chang left San Francisco and returned to China. Chang became the Accountant-General to the Treasury's Shanghai branch. Around the same time, he was appointed to a chair at Nanjing Government University (alternate spelling: Nanking Government University) to teach international law and banking.Lani Ah Tye Farkas, Bury My Bones in America (1998), p. 91-92. (Another source, however, notes that Hong Yen Chang taught at Tien-tsin University.) In 1908, Chang became a diplomat, participating first in a Special Mission to the United States, and then serving the Chinese Legation in Washington, D.C. Between 1910 and 1913, he served as the Chinese Consul in Vancouver, British Columbia.Lani Ah Tye Farkas, Bury My Bones in America (1998), p. 92. The Chinese government awarded him a doctorate of law for his services. Hong Yen Chang held other prestigious positions, including Director of Chinese naval students at Berkeley, California, until his retirement in 1920. Chang died on August 4, 1926, in Berkeley, California.

Biography Following the death of his father in 1578, who was buried in almost monarchical fashion, the new Captain-Donat√°rio departed for Lisbon, where he hoped to join King Sebastian of Portugal on his adventure into North Africa. But, upon arriving the Corte received notice of the disaster at Alc√°cer Quibir, occurring on 4 August 1578, and the death of their King. =Donat√°rio= The events of his death threw Portugal into a dynastic crisis, and the young noble decided to remain at Corte. Yet, he received orders by King Henry to part for his captaincy, in order to maintain political stability within the Kingdom: he departed in September 1579. But, a few leagues into the Atlantic, he resolved to return to Lisbon, alleging health problems with his wife and obtained royal permission to postpone his voyage until the following April. King Henry's death on 31 January 1580 permitted Rui to postpone his return to the Azores, indefinitely. During the dynastic crisis that developed, Rui Gon√ßalves da C√¢mara aligned his family with the faction supporting Phillip II of Spain (Philip I of Portugal), while on the island of Terceira and other islands of the Azores, Ant√≥nio, Prior of Crato was enthusiastically acclaimed. Yet, on S√£o Miguel, where his family influenced politics, there was tepid support for Ant√≥nio, with many of the nobles supporting the Castilian pretendent to the throne.Carlos Melo Bento (2008), p.47 With his arrival in the Azores (in 1582), King Ant√≥nio temporarily altered this situation. But, quickly, the defeat of Luso-French forces, commanded by Filippo Strozzi on 26 June 1582 (at the Battle of Vila Franca), put S√£o Miguel definitively in the hands of the faction supporting Phillip II. By royal decree, the donatary captain, Rui Gon√ßalves da C√¢mara, departed with a squadron of Castilian forces ordered to proceed to occupy the Azores, launching on 23 June 1583. This was not before, by regal charter (dated 17 June 1583) he was named Count of Vila Franca, owing to his collaboration and support for the Philippine cause. Following five years of absence, on 7 June 1583, Rui disembarked in Vila Franca do Campo, and was received in full honours. But, his Spanish connections and recent elevation to Count did not make him popular with the local populous: the municipal council in Vila Franca imposed embargoes after the granting of the title, alleging that it violated its historical privileges. The embargoes were rejected, but demonstrated the people's resistance to the new regime. Resuming his functions, Rui installed himself in Ponta Delgada, dedicating himself to the defence of the island. This was important, since his allegiance to Phillip II made him an indirect enemy of France and England: the island was, therefore, threatened with increased attacks from English and French forces, including Francis Drake. The Count distributed his forces throughout the island, creating a company of \\"adventurers\\" (aventureiros as they were locally known) under the command of his son Gaspar. Meanwhile, the Count of Cumberland attacked and sacked Graciosa and S√£o Jorge, while his compatriot, the Duke of Essex, did this same on the island of Faial. Regardless, the Castilians were reviled by the local populous, favouring their supporters rather than the local nobility of the time.Carlos Melo Bento (2008), p.48 =Later life= On 12 August 1590 he departed for Lisbon, leaving behind his ouvidor Gon√ßalo Vaz Coutinho to handle his supervisory duties. During Coutinho's stewardship, the island was attacked by 150 troops loyal to Count of Essex, who launched various attacks and caused a lot of damage. But, his efforts were for not, and he returned to England along with the potential English governor (whom Elizabeth had dispatched anticipating an easy conquest of the islands). On 1598, Rui C√¢mara returned to the islands, where he continued to exercise his functions until his death in 1601.

A former private, he was promoted to command an infantry regiment after the Battle of Jemappes. He became a general of brigade in late August 1793 and a general of division less than three weeks later. Soon afterwards, he led a division in Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's victory at Wattignies. In the spring of 1794, he led his troops at Le Cateau, Beaumont and Landrecies. By this time it was obvious that he did not have the talent to command a combat division and he was replaced by Jean Baptiste Kl√©ber. He was not employed after June 1795 and died at Guise in 1821. Early career Balland was born at Pont-de-Beauvoisin on 27 August 1751. He enlisted in the Beauvoisis Regiment on 17 April 1769, which later became the 57th Line Infantry Regiment. He was promoted corporal on 17 February 1771, sergeant on 24 February 1773, sergeant major on 11 August 1781 and adjutant on 4 September 1784. He was discharged from the Beauvoisis Regiment on 1 November 1790. French Revolution =Jemappes and Wattignies= Balland fought at the Battle of Jemappes. Balland joined the 1st National Guard Battalion of Paris as a captain on 21 July 1791. He became the second lieutenant colonel on 16 January 1792 and first lieutenant colonel on 27 August 1792. At the Battle of Jemappes on 6 November 1792, the Right Wing Advance Guard under Auguste Marie Henri Picot de Dampierre included the 1st Paris Battalion. Balland fought at Jemappes and earned promotion to colonel of the 83rd Infantry Regiment on 8 March 1793. He assumed the rank of general of brigade on 27 August 1793 and general of division seventeen days later on 13 September 1793. The writer Paul Thi√©bault was enraged that Balland, a man \\"without form and without foundation\\", was named to command a division. Balland took √âdouard Mortier on his staff. After the Coalition army began the Siege of Maubeuge, Army of the North commander Jean-Baptiste Jourdan began shifting his main army from the Camp of Gavrelle south-east to Guise. He sent the first division under Jacques Fromentin on 3 October and the second division under Balland at dawn on 6 October. Balland's 13,424-man division reached Bapaume that evening, P√©ronne on 7 October, Saint-Quentin on 8 October and Guise the next day. Jourdan massed a total of 44,276 soldiers at Guise. Jourdan attacked the Coalition army of Prince Josias of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld in the Battle of Wattignies from 15‚Äì16 October 1793. Balland's division consisted of 11,884 infantry in eight battalions of regulars and 13 of volunteers (21 battalions), ranging in strength from 218 to 895 men. The 1,410 mounted troops included the 16th and 17th Heavy Cavalry and the 4th Hussar and 6th Chasseurs √† Cheval Regiments. On the first day, the French planned to have the left and right wings attack first. After progress was made on the flanks, Balland's division in the center would attack. Initially Fromentin's soldiers on the left flank and Florent Joseph Duquesnoy's troops on the right gained ground. Though Jourdan believed it was not yet time, the powerful politician Lazare Carnot of the Committee of Public Safety insisted that Balland's men immediately assault the village of Dourlers. The attack was launched and was beaten back with losses of about 1,500 men. At the same time Fromentin was repulsed and Duquesnoy was stopped at Wattignies, with a loss of 12 guns. During the night, Jourdan took 6,000 troops from Balland to help Duquesnoy's men capture Wattignies and Coburg assembled 16,400 foot and 6,000 horse to oppose the French. On 16 October, the French moved into position in a fog but their first two attacks were defeated; the third assault succeeded and the battle was won. =Le Cateau and Landrecies= The new Army of the North commander Jean-Charles Pichegru, ordered an attack on Le Cateau-Cambr√©sis on 29 March 1794. The divisions of Balland and Jacques Gilles Henri Goguet advanced from Guise, while Fromentin moved from Avesnes-sur-Helpe. In the Battle of Le Cateau, the French were beaten with the loss of 1,200 casualties and four guns, while the Austrians only lost 293 men. On 17 and 18 April, Coburg's army drove back Balland, Goguet and Fromentin to open the Siege of Landrecies. In the operation, the 60,000-man Coalition army sustained 1,000 casualties including 627 Austrians, while the French lost over 2,000 killed, wounded and missing as well as 24 field guns. Since Pichegru was far away at Lille, Balland as the senior general on the spot ordered a counter-stroke. The attack on 21 April was repulsed with the loss of 500 killed and four guns. One of the dead was Goguet, shot down by mutinous group of his own men. On 26 April, the French divisions launched simultaneous attacks on the Coalition positions in the Battle of Beaumont. Coalition cavalry rode down the division of Ren√©-Bernard Chapuy, capturing thousands of French soldiers and their commanding general. Balland's division was routed in a separate action on 26 April. Landrecies fell to the Coalition on 30 April. New commanders were being promoted to division command; Paul-Alexis Dubois replaced Goguet and Jacques Philippe Bonnaud replaced Chapuy. By this time there were protests that Balland's troops fought poorly and that he did not support his fellow commanders. Fromentin wrote that, \\"everyone complains about him\\". On 11 May, Balland was removed from command of his division and replaced by Jean Baptiste Kl√©ber. Later career Balland was not in the list of active generals on 13 June 1795 and was discharged on 13 March 1798. He was awarded the L√©gion d'Honneur in 1805. One source stated that he received the knight's cross of the L√©gion d'Honneur (again) on 28 August 1817. That year he became mayor of Guise and was granted a patent of nobility as a chevalier on 28 March 1818. He died at Guise on 3 November 1821.

Career  While Taiwanese directors are often associated with slower-paced, personal art films, Chen decided early on when he entered the film industry that he wanted to produce high quality, entertainment-oriented movies. \\"The performing arts shouldn‚Äôt be inhibited by theory.\\" Chen has established a solid foundation with a career that includes screenwriting, directing, as well as theatre, instilling his films with a unique and distinguished style. Chen's first short film, Scenes of Violence, cost NT$3,000 to produce and earned NT$600,000 in returns from television sales in Taiwan and Japan. This success gave him the confidence to devote himself to the film industry. Chen was even interviewed by Wealth Magazine for an in-depth report on the success of his short film for its high ROI (return on investment). In 1998, a Japanese corporation invested in Chen's first feature film JAM. The film set a record of continuously running for over three months in theatres. After the success of JAM, Chen completed a gangster film, A Chance to Die, once again getting financing from Japan. He asked Miki Mizuno, a well-known Japanese actress, and Takashi Kashiwabara, a famous Japanese idol who is also popular in Taiwan, to play the main characters. This was his second feature film. For his third feature film, The Cabbie, Chen was able to get Rie Miyazawa, an accomplished Japanese actress, to play the leading role of the movie. The Cabbie was a fresh and inventive take on the Taiwanese comedy. Chen's creativity and skills are on full display in the work of these three films. In being vivid and confident in the shooting, drawing on a strong foundation of the visual arts, the dramatics of storytelling, and with a focus on the shaping each characters‚Äô unique inner lives, Chen has always been able to effectively create entertaining and audience-friendly films while still maintaining his a strong vision. Chen has continued to search for new and innovative storytelling methods. He returned from a short-term sabbatical in New York, with a renewed focus on producing high quality films. In 2006, Chen finished a 35mm feature film, Tripping, also known as Time Tripper, which combined the road movie with a martial arts film. In 2013, he produced and directed As the Winds Blow. After 2015, Chen worked as an actor in many feature films, Godspeed, The Great Buddha+, Xiao Mei, High Flash, A Sun... and so on, and he also acted on Netflix programs, Wake Up 2, On Children, and Monstrous Me. In 2019, Chen got the Best Leading Actor Award by the feature film A Sun in the 56th Golden Horse Awards and he also got the nominee of the Best Leading Actors by a short film A Taxi Driver in the 54th Golden Bell Awards.

Each association member's primary mission is to provide education and training in conservation through the awarding of an accredited degree. Since 1974, the conservation graduate programs have held an annual meeting at one of the member programs in order to give current students the opportunity to present current research to their peers. History The Corning Museum of Glass, site of the first conference held by the North American graduate programs in conservationThe first conference of North American graduate programs in the conservation of art and other cultural property was held in 1974 at the Corning Museum of Glass in response to a flood that damaged the museum's artifact and library collection on June 23, 1972. While only three percent of the museum's glass collection sustained damage, over half of the museum's library holdings were lost or severely devastated. This five-day conference entitled, \\"Conservation Seminar on Glass and Library Materials,\\" was organized by Dr. Robert H. Brill, the Corning Museum's research scientist. For the first time, this conference brought together students, faculty, conservators, curators, and other museum specialists for several days of lectures and discussions on the field of conservation. Five American programs and a contingent from the Canadian Conservation Institute were in attendance; Cooperstown Graduate Program, Winterthur/University of Delaware, Intermuseum Conservation Association, New York University, Canadian Conservation Institute, and the Fogg Art Museum. Since the Corning Museum conference, annual meetings have become an integral part of ANAGPIC as a way to provide insight into the quality of the education provided by each program represented. Notable conservation professionals also present lectures during the conferences that address a specific area of interest in conservation, such as \\"Extreme Conservation\\" at the 2014 ANAGPIC conference. These lectures provide students with powerful insight on important issues for their future careers. The Association of North American Graduate Programs in the Conservation of Cultural Property (ANAGPIC) was founded in May, 1984 by the following organizations: Buffalo State College, State University of New York, Art Conservation Department; Harvard University Art Museums, Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies; New York University, Conservation Center, Institute of Fine Arts; Queen's University, Art Conservation Program; Winterthur/University of Delaware Program in Art Conservation; The University of Texas at Austin, School of Information, Kilgarlin Center for Preservation of the Cultural Record. Mission The general purpose of the Association of North American Graduate Programs in the Conservation of Cultural Property (ANAGPIC) is to ‚Äúhelp serve the need of the conservation field for well-trained professional conservators by aiding its member training programs to attain their educational objectives.‚Äù In order for organizations to be eligible for membership, they must have provided conservation training for at least three consecutive years, and they must award a diploma, degree, or certificate formally acknowledged by their parent academic association. Within that parent institution, the member organization must be a distinct program, whose primary mission is conservation education and training. The program's curriculum must have substantial components of problem-solving in conservation and conservation science, and should conform to the AIC Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice. The student to faculty ratio must also be no greater than ten students per faculty member, and these faculty members must have professional qualifications to teach conservation at a graduate level. This can be demonstrated through substantial professional recognition through the International Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (IIC), the American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC), or the Canadian Association of Professional Conservators (CAPC). At least one meeting of the ANAGPIC is held annually, normally concurrent with the annual Conference of the Conservation Training Programs, at present held in late spring. Typically, each institution is represented by two student presenters. Other meetings can be called as necessary if agreed to by at least two-thirds of the membership. Each member organization is normally represented by the training program director/chairperson. Current members =Buffalo State College, SUNY, Art Conservation Department= Rockwell Hall at Buffalo State College, where graduate courses in art conservation are held. Buffalo State College's Art Conservation Department was founded in 1970 as the Cooperstown Graduate Program in the Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works, affiliated with the State University of New York College at Oneonta and with the New York State Historical Association in Cooperstown. In 1983, the program transferred to Buffalo State College, and then relocated to its campus in 1987. Since its founding, Buffalo State offers a master of arts degree and certificate of advanced study in art conservation upon the completion of a three-year graduate program which trains conservators of fine art and material cultural heritage. This program accepts only 10 students per academic year. Buffalo State is the largest four-year college of arts and sciences in the State University of New York (SUNY) system. Buffalo State's campus also hosts the Burchfield Penney Art Center and located across the street from the Albright- Knox Art Gallery. Program Overview Art Conservation, M.A., C.A.S. *First Year - Students take courses in conservation imaging, documentation and examination, conservation science, and in the specialties of paper, paintings, and objects. *Second Year - Students continue to take conservation imaging, examination and documentation as well as conservation science, but they focus primarily on their chosen area of specialization (objects, paintings, or paper). Students may also choose a subspecialty, such as ethnographic or archaeological objects, photographs, or books. *Third Year - Students complete a 12-month internship at a museum or similar institution selected by the student and faculty advisor. Admission Requirements The following admission requirements represent the minimum qualifications a potential student must meet in order to be considered for a graduate program in art conservation at Buffalo State. # Bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university with a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.8 (4.0 scale). # Acceptable scores on the Graduate Record Examination (GRE), e.g. at least a score of 500 each in verbal and quantitative. # Completion of the following coursework, at minimum: ## Art History (21 credits) - Courses should include broad surveys of art history, as well as more focused studies of particular art movements. Acceptable courses can also include up to 12 semester hours outside of an art history department, such as classics, archaeology or anthropology courses that focus on artifacts, history of the book, history of photography, history of furniture and other material culture courses. ## Chemistry (16 credits) - Courses should be a two- semester general chemistry course with accompanying laboratory sections and a two-semester organic chemistry course with accompanying laboratory sections. ## Studio Arts (9 credits) - Courses should include a broad range of studio art classes, such as drawing, printmaking, painting, ceramics, or fibers. # While the Admissions Committee at Buffalo State does not require a minimum number of internship hours to be completed before applying to the program, all applicants must have hands-on experience working with a professional conservator. Applicants must be able to demonstrate experience with completing supervised conservation treatments, as well as a basic understanding of treatment methods and techniques, conservation problem solving, and related issues. Selected applicants are invited to Buffalo for an hour-long interview, scheduled for late March or early April of each year. Interviewees are asked to present a portfolio of artwork and a summary of their conservation experience, usually through a power point presentation. A color perception test is also administered. =Harvard University Art Museums, Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies= Overview The Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies provides analysis and treatments for the Harvard Art Museums‚Äô collection, consisting of more than 250,000 objects in all media, ranging in date from antiquity to the present. The Department of Technical Studies became the first institution in the United States to use scientific methods to study artists‚Äô materials and techniques when it was founded in 1928 by Edward W. Forbes, director of Harvard University's Fogg Museum. In 1994, the center was renamed the Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies in honor of Philip A. and Lynn Straus, who were longtime benefactors of the Harvard Art Museums. In 1972, with the support from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Straus Center began their Advanced-Level Training Program which provides formal hands-on training in the conservation of works on paper, paintings, and objects and sculpture, as well as in conservation science. They offer three 10-month fellowships each year in which fellows can refine their practical and analytical skills through the examination and treatment of works of art from the Harvard Art Museums' collections. Fellows also have the chance to publish their original research. =New York University, Conservation Center, Institute of Fine Arts= The Conservation Center of the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University (NYU) was founded in 1960 with support from the Rockefeller Foundation. Since that time, the program has called for equal measures of art historical study, scientific training, and practical conservation experience. The goal was to produce a professional who would approach each object as an individual entity. The solution to an object's condition issues would be determined through research and study, unlike the tradesman restorer's approach, which applied standard treatments to objects and problems. Unlike other conservation graduate programs, NYU awards a four-year, dual-degree graduate program where students earn both their Masters in art history and in conservation. The Conservation Center is also the oldest degree-granting conservation program in North America. Program Overview Art History, M.A. with Advanced Certificate in Conservation *First Year - Students gain an understanding of materials and technology, with a heavy emphasis on direct observation. No treatment is carried out during the first year, apart from simple treatment methodologies carried out in Principles of Conservation. Students must also successfully pass a language translation exam within their first year of study, in the language of their choosing - French, German or Italian. *Second Year - Students complete core classes and begin training in their specialized area of study at the Conservation Center, as well as museums and private laboratories in NYC. Students also have the ability to pursue independent research projects in areas of particular interest to them. *Third Year - Students continue upper-level conservation treatment coursework in their area of concentration and complete any remaining requirements for the MA degree in art history, including the completion of the Master's Thesis. *Fourth Year - Students complete a nine-month internship in their area of specialization at an established conservation institution. Students can complete this internship in the United States or abroad. Admission Requirements The following admission requirements represent the minimum qualifications a potential student must meet in order to be considered for the conservation graduate program at the Institute of Fine Arts, NYU. # Bachelor's degree (B.A., B.F.A. or B.S.) from an accredited institution. # Completion of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE), and, if applicable, the TOEFL exam. A TOEFL score of 100+ is required. # A reading knowledge of French, German or Italian, or the clear intent to obtain such ability. # Completion of the following coursework, at minimum: ## Art History - Four courses in upper-level art history courses, beyond the survey level ## Chemistry - Four laboratory science courses at the college level, of which organic chemistry I is required. Ideally, a full chemistry track (‚Äúgeneral chemistry I and II‚Äù and organic chemistry I and II) is preferred. # A displayed competency in studio work, which will be determined through a portfolio review if the applicant is selected for an interview. Selected applicants are invited to NYU for an interview, during which they present evidence of their familiarity with as wide a range of artists‚Äô materials and techniques through a portfolio of relevant studio arts and, if applicable, prior conservation work. The portfolio comprises a maximum of five studio pieces and no more than one treatment. Artist portfolios can contain examples of both traditional and non-traditional artists' techniques. =Queen‚Äôs University, Art Conservation Program= Grant Hall at Queen's University at Kingston; one of the most recognizable landmarks at the university. Since its founding in 1974, the Master of Art Conservation Program (MAC) at Queen's University in Kingston has offered the only full-time graduate-level training program in the field of art conservation in Canada. The MAC program's treatment stream is completed in two years and allows students to specialize in one of the following: treatment of artifacts, paintings, or paper. Each student chooses a specialization upon acceptance into the program. Students in the treatment streams have the opportunity to work with the humanities, science, and engineering departments at Queen's to undertake projects with museums, galleries, archives, the Canadian Conservation Institute, and industrial partners. Along with the treatment stream, the MAC program also offers a two-year research stream to science and engineering graduates, which would ultimately lead to a career in conservation science. Students in the research stream complete original research and a thesis surrounding topics such as the history of technology or other conservation-related areas. Program Overview Master of Art Conservation, M.A.C. *First Year - Students in the treatment stream complete courses in theoretical and practical study on campus, advanced lecture courses, lab work in conservation of heritage objects, and a research project in their area of specialization.

Students are drawn from multi-disciplinary backgrounds such as architecture, art history, history, urban planning, engineering, science, art, urban design, archeology, anthropology, sociology, philosophy and jurisprudence. Students bring to bear their respective interests on preservation. By focusing on historical, aesthetic, technological, environmental, social and political questions, the program cultivates deep engagement with the ideas and practices that constitute preservation, and the broad multi-disciplinary skill sets that it draws upon. Program Overview Students are required to complete a minimum of 60 points for the M.S. in Historic Preservation, of which 37 points are from required courses. In the first year, students must complete the Studio I and II sequence, and six required courses: Theory and Practice of Preservation, Preservation Planning, & Policy, Traditional American Architecture, Traditional Building Technology, Modern American Architecture and Modern Building Technology. In the second year, students take Preservation Colloquium in the Fall in preparation for their required thesis project in the Spring. During their second year, students can take one of three advanced studios to specialize in preservation design (joint studio with M. Arch), preservation planning (joint studio with UP), or preservation technology. Advanced studios travel domestically and internationally and offer opportunities for research and hands-on experience. To further their practical training, students are encouraged to complete an internship between their first and second years in the program. The program offers a wealth of elective courses ranging in topics and formats: lectures and seminars examine historical, theoretical and practical facets of the profession, laboratory courses engage in experimental object-centric learning about architectural materials and methods of conservation, workshops extend the hands-on practicum, and mini courses offer deep dives into burning contemporary issues in preservation. =University of Pennsylvania, Architectural Conservation= The Graduate Program in Historic Preservation provides an integrated approach for architects, landscape architects, planners, historians, archaeologists, conservators, managers, and other professionals to understand, sustain, and transform the existing environment. The identification and analysis of cultural places and their historic fabric, the determination of significance and value, and the design of appropriate conservation and management measures require special preparation in history, theory, documentation, technology, and planning. These subjects form the core of the program, which students build upon to define an area of emphasis including building conservation, site management, landscape preservation, preservation planning, and preservation design for those with a previous design degree. Through coursework and dedicated studios and laboratories at the University of Pennsylvania Stuart Weitzman School of Design as well as through partnerships with other national and international institutions and agencies, students have unparalleled opportunities for study, internships, and sponsored research. Graduates can look toward careers focused on the design and preservation of the world's cultural heritage including buildings, engineering works, cultural landscapes, archaeological sites, and historic towns and cities. Annual Meetings The annual meetings held by the current member organizations of ANAGPIC have become an eagerly anticipated event among students, faculty, and speakers.

The film's plot centers on Goofy trying to get a job as a wildlife photographer but ending up causing trouble in a grizzly bear's pen at a zoo. This is Humphrey the Bear's debut appearance. Plot The narrator explains that when you get bored or constantly have unsatisfying days, you need a hobby - in Goofy's case, photography. Goofy goes to a store to get some cameras and in his basement goes to unload them and insert the film. The narrator explains that there are two types of film: roll film and cut film. When Goofy gets the film all loaded in, the narrator says that he should pick a task such as wildlife watching. Goofy goes to the grizzly bear habitat at a zoo to photograph Humphrey the Bear. Slight gags show Goofy to be an inept photographer, waking Humphrey up, putting a cape over Humphrey's head, taking pictures right in his face, and creating a small volcano that blows up on Humphrey. The last straw comes when Goofy takes a picture of Humphrey's dinner with his family. The angered bear chases Goofy out of the zoo, across town, through a stage and back to Goofy's apartment via a taxi (with Humphrey as the driver). The bear chases Goofy up the stairs, and finally into Goofy's apartment and closet where Goofy is mauled. However, Humphrey calms down after Goofy shows him his pictures, and when Humphrey goes on vacation he takes them with himself to show them to tourists.

Early life Sylvain Tesson is the son of Marie-Claude Tesson and the journalist Philippe Tesson who founded the French newspaper Le Quotidien de Paris. His sisters are the actress Stephanie Tesson and the art journalist Daphne Tesson. He is a geographer by background and holds a degree in geopolitics.Sylvain Tesson , pr√©sentation de l'auteur sur le site des √âditions Arthaud : G√©ographe de formation [‚Ä¶].

Travels and writing  In 1991, he crossed central Iceland on a motorcycle,Sylvain Tesson en bref, in Les Chemins de la libert√©, Retour d'exp√©, page 47. and then took part in a cave exploration in Borneo.Sylvain Tesson. √âcrivain fran√ßais, sur le site evene.fr. In 1993 and 1994, he toured the world by bicycle with Alexandre Poussin, whom he had known since secondary school.Sylvain Tesson 40 ans ‚Äì √âcrivain, sur le site franceinter.fr. The two friends then completed their studies in geography. He wrote about the trip in 1996, in the book On a roul√© sur la terre, for which he received the youth IGN prize. Again with Poussin, in 1997 he crossed the Himalaya by foot, a five- month journey of 5000 kilometers from Bhutan to Tajikistan. He and Poussin then collaborated on the book La Marche dans le ciel: 5000 km √† pied √† travers l'Himalaya in 1998. In 1999 and 2000, he and photographer Priscilla Telmon crossed the steppes of central Asia from Kazakhstan to Uzbekistan on horseback. That trip led to two books: La Chevauch√©e des steppes in 2001, and Carnets de Steppes: √† cheval √† travers l'Asie centrale in 2002. In 2001 and 2002, he participated in archeological expeditions in Pakistan and Afghanistan. From May 2003 to January 2004, he followed the route allegedly used by S≈Çawomir Rawicz to escape the gulag as Rawicz described in his book, The Long Walk (1955).En fran√ßais, √Ä marche forc√©e, paru aux √âditions Ph√©bus, Libretto, 2011. Rawicz travelled from Yakutsk in Siberia to Calcutta in India on foot. Tesson concluded the journey was plausible, though there are inconsistencies, such as Rawicz's claim of ten days without water in the Gobi. Tesson wrote a book with photographer Thomas Goisque based on this experience, Sous l'√©toile de la libert√©. Six mille kilom√®tres √† travers l'Eurasie sauvage (\\"Under the star of liberty. Six thousand kilometers across the Eurasian wild.\\") In 2010, Tesson undertook a project to live alone for six months on the shores of Lake Baikal in a rustic cabin during winter, about 50 km south of Irkutsk. In his own words, \\"the recipe for happiness: a window on Baikal, a table by the window.\\" He recounted his time in Siberia in a book, The Consolations of the Forest: Alone in a Cabin on the Siberian Taiga. It won the 2014 Dolman Best Travel Book Award. He also released a film titled Alone, 180 days on Lake Baikal (2011), directed by Tesson and Florence Tran. In 2015 he won the Prix de la Page 112.

Lan Kwai Fong 3 is a sequel to 2011's Lan Kwai Fong and 2012's Lan Kwai Fong 2 as part of the Lan Kwai Fong theatrical series. Originally intended for a late December 2013 release it was pushed back to an early 2014 release due to production issues. The film was finally released in Hong Kong and Singapore on January 2, 2014. The film stars Whitney Hui, Ava Yu, Jeana He, Jason Chan, Alex Lam, Christine Ng, Celia Kwok, and Charles Ying. The movie is much darker than the previous two by depicting drugs and rape in club scenes. Plot The story follows four women who hit the Hong Kong night-life district of Lan Kwai Fong, looking for excitement and love. Jeana (from the first movie) is now a model in an open, non-committed relationship with Jacky (also from the first movie), and continues with her party-hard night lifestyle. Her friend Sara, feeling neglected by her fiance, looks for excitement by hitting the clubs again. Papa is an ugly duckling who works as an infants' school teacher by day and rushes home to go clubbing at night, hoping to find a guy who will love her. Jolie is a rich orphan who is looking to have fun, having just come back from England during her university holidays. Jeana and Papa take Sara out to the hottest club at Lan Kwai Fong, Club Magnum, to help her forget about her boyfriend Shin, who would rather hang out with his ex-girlfriend then celebrate his birthday with her. At Club Magnum they meet up with Jeana's boyfriend Jacky, who has managed Club Magnum since Ah Gong's club went out of business. Jacky introduces them to May, the owner of the club, who then introduces them to her partying younger cousin Jolie. Jolie immediately reminds Jacky of his ex-girlfriend Mavis, about whom he still feels guilty. May, knowing Jolie likes to party hard, gives Jacky the task of looking after Jolie. She hopes the two can start a relationship, since his current girlfriend Jeana will soon be leaving for Taiwan for work. Jacky hesitantly agrees to babysit Jolie only because she reminds him of Mavis. Meanwhile, Jeana pushes Sara to forget about her boyfriend Shin by telling her to party harder and introduces her to her Korean friend Kim. Sara is instantly attracted to Kim but because she is engaged to Shin she stops the two from going past a platonic friendship. During a yacht party thrown by May, Jeana, knowing of the rough patch in Sara and Shin's relationship, tries to seduce Shin and suggest Sara, Jolie and she go on a get away to Seoul, South Korea, to have fun with Kim. On the day they are to depart to Seoul Jeana backs out of the trip with only Sara and Jolie going. While Sara is in Korea, Jeana uses images of Sara having fun with Kim to coax Shin into having sex with her. Coincidentally, while in Korea, Kim is able to convince Sara to give in to her sexual desires and have sex with him. With Kim and Sara leaving Jolie behind at the club, Jolie gets gang raped by two Korean men she just met. At the police station to find out what happened to Jolie, Sara finds out Kim has a wife and was only using her for a no strings attached fling. Papa, who has the body but not the face, is often called pork chop (ugly girl) by all the men at the club. Being ignored by guys, she sits by herself cutting paper patterns while waiting for a guy too drunk to notice her looks to come along and have a one-night stand with her. She is introduced to one of Shin's friends, Parker, who takes an interest in her. The two eventually have sex one night, with Papa leaving early in the morning thinking Parker will think of it as a one-night stand the next day. Parker waits outside Papa's workplace the next day to tell her he is truly serious about their relationship. May sends Jacky to Korea to take care of Jolie until she recovers from her horrific incident. In Korea Jolie tells Jacky she knows that she reminds him of his ex-girlfriend Mavis and that he's not obliged to take care of her. Once back in Hong Kong Jacky shows Jolie that he wants to take care of her, not because he has to but because he wants to. With Jeana leaving, Jacky and Jolie eventually become a couple and manage Club Magnum together. lovehkfilm review.

Whitney Hui, who was only to have a guest role, became the film's new female lead. Since Hui is a TVB contract artiste and former Miss Hong Kong runner up she was not given any explicit sex scenes in the movie to protect her image. Instead, most of the explicit scenes originally intended for Dada's character were rewritten for Ava Yu and Jeana Ho's characters. With Chan no longer part of the movie some of the cast were reshuffled and scripts rewritten. Yu was originally to play party girl Jolie while Chan was to reprise her role as Cat.

Family loyalty has been destroyed and everyone engages in dark and disturbing games. The mother Ruby, a faded opera diva, is egotistical and manipulative. Thirteen-year-old daughter Lakme engages in malicious sibling rivalry with her brother Sigfrid, charming but unfeeling. The father Fa spends most of his time sleeping in his chair ignoring the chaos around him. Into this mix a friend named Clarence visits for the evening. Since Clarence is hopeful and idealistic, the family feels compelled to destroy him. Clarence fights a losing battle against the culture of fear surrounding him aided sometimes by crotchety Grandfa who remembers when the family was not ruled by fear.\\" 'Bump in the Night' at the Bug Theatre shows effect of culture of fear\\" North Denver Tribune, February 28, 2012 References Further reading * External links * Plays by Terrence McNally 1964 plays ","title":"And Things That Go Bump in the Night"},{"id":"42485260","text":"Lion Down is a 1951 Goofy cartoon featuring Goofy and Louie the Mountain Lion.

It has been observed that as economies continue to grow, the demand for labor is at an all-time high in the industrial sector and the sex tourism sector. A mix of impoverished individuals and the desire for more wealth creates an environment for human traffickers to benefit in the Southeast Asia region. Many nations within the region have taken preventive measures to end human trafficking within their borders and punish traffickers operating there. Nature of the problem Human trafficking, is defined by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in their Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons document as ‚Äúthe recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation.‚Äù This definition applies to harvesting of organs, slavery or forced labor, and sexual exploitation. According to an International Labour Organization (ILO) a report using a methodology based on national surveys reported, as recently as 2012, 20.9 million people were being held against their will in various forms of forced labor around the world. The majority of these laborers were women at 55% and males at 45%.ILO Special Action Programme to combat forced labor. (2012) \\"ILO 2012 Global estimate of forced labor: Executive summary\\" Retrieved from http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_norm/---declaration/documents/publication/wcms_181953.pdf According to Besler, annual profits from industries specializing in forced labor have averaged 44.3 billion dollars in 2005.Besler, P. \\"All Forms of Forced Labor\\" Forced Labor and Human Trafficking: Estimating the Profits. (2005) 16. Retrieved from http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&context;=forcedlabor Beyond the scope Southeast Asia, the Asia-Pacific region contains the largest number of forced laborers anywhere in the world but only has a prevalence rate of 3.3 per 1000, which is one of the lower prevalence rates when compared by region. This is due to the fact that the Asia-Pacific region has a much larger population when compared to the rest of the world's regions. In Southeast Asia human trafficking is widely regarded as interregional with laborers being collected from countries within the region and ultimately working within the region. Victims from Southeast Asia have also been found in many other countries around the globe. In Southeast Asia human trafficking consists of forced sexual labor and forced labor which, in many countries in Southeast Asia, can lead to mixed forms of human trafficking. In Thailand and Malaysia trafficking mainly takes the form of sexual exploitation, while in Indonesia forced labor is observed is more prevalent, but both forms of sexual and forced labor can be found.UNODC, \\"Global Report on Trafficking in Persons\\" 2012. Retrieved from http://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and- analysis/glotip/Trafficking_in_Persons_2012_web.pdf It is estimated that 10,000 laborers are deceived or captured into forced labor annually in the region. Causes The main causes of human trafficking in Southeast Asia are universal factors such as poverty and globalization. According to Betz, poverty is not the root of human trafficking and that there are other factors such as the desire to have access to upward mobility and knowledge on the wealth that can be gained from working in urban cities, that ultimately attracts impoverished individuals to human traffickers. Betz claims the industrialization of the region in the mid 20th century led to a clear division between growing economies and stagnant ones. This industrialization of booming economies, like that of Thailand and Singapore created a draw for poor migrants seeking upward mobility and individuals wanting to leave war torn countries. These migrants were an untapped resource in growing economies that had already exhausted the cheap labor from within its borders. A high supply of migrant workers seeking employment and high demand from an economy seeking cheap labor creates a perfect combination for human traffickers to thrive. Still in the new millennium the market for forced labor is profitable; class-divisions and the economies' need for unskilled labor keep traffickers in the market. The sex industry emerged in Southeast Asia in the mid 20th century as a way for women to generate more income for struggling migrants and locals trying to support families or themselves. Nicola Piper claims the industry's growth throughout the region can be attributed to growing tourism and military bases that dotted the region during times of major wars. Sex industries first catered to military personnel on leave from bases but as military installations began to recede the industry turned its attention to growing tourism. With little intervention from governments due to potential harm to the tourism market, the sex industry's growth was uninhibited.Michael Hitchcock, Victor King, Michael Parnwell, eds., Tourism in Southeast Asia: Challenges and New Directions (Copenhagen, Denmark: NIAS Press, 2008), 227. Even as the industry is looked down upon today there is still a large underground market that is demanding from traffickers.Lim, The Sex Sector, 15 Source countries Philippines is a source country and transit country when it comes to forced labor and sexual exploitation. Thailand is one of the biggest suppliers of forced labor in the Southeast Asia region and around the globe. Most of the forced laborers are brought in from nearby Southeast Asian countries like Myanmar, Malaysia, Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia. Migrants voluntarily migrate into Thailand where they can end up in forced labor or sold into its own sex industry. Laos is labeled as a source country of men, women, and children for the sex slave industry and the forced labor industry. Many of the Lao migrants move to countries like Thailand or are sent to China from a transit country. Lao migrants are mainly flowed into sectors of intensive labor with little pay. 70 percent of migrants from Laos are female and many of them are sought for the use of domestic labor. In Thailand there are no labor protection for domestic workers, which can lead to risks for the migrant Lao females. Cambodia is a source country for migrants due to high levels of unemployment and poverty. This leaves natives with little opportunity and high levels of risk for human trafficking. Many Cambodian women are trafficked into sexual or labor industries, while men are trafficked into the fishing, agricultural and construction sectors in many countries within the Southeast Asian region. Myanmar's history of rule under a military regime is one of the reasons the country is considered a source country. The regime's poor management of the economy and human rights abuse put the countries citizens at risk for human trafficking. Men, women and children are subject to labor exploitation in Thailand, China, Pakistan, South Korea and Macau. Children are trafficked in Thailand to be forced into begging, while young girls are trafficked into China to work in the sex slave industry. Destination countries Philippines is a destination country in addition to being source country. Migrants from several countries looking for work are attracted to Thailand's promising economy. Thailand's economy also heavily relies on migrant workers due to the fact that it is strongly labor-intensive, with major sectors being construction, fishing and commercial agriculture. Cambodia is a destination country for females being trafficked into the sex trade industry. Cambodia has one of the largest sources of demand for child prostitution and sex tourism in the region. Females are brought from rural regions of Cambodia and Vietnam to major cities where they are sold or sexually exploited. Vietnam is a destination country for children who are subjected to forced sexual labor and labor trafficking. Children from rural areas of the country are brought into major cities where through threats and debt-bondage are forced into the sex trade, begging industry, and industrial sectors. With Vietnam being a destination for child sex tourism, the large demand gives traffickers incentives to recruit children into the trade. Victims Most of the victims that are currently working under forced labor conditions are doing so because they were either mislead about job opportunities or were enslaved or forced to against their will. According to a policy brief on human trafficking in Southeast Asia, although victims include girls, women, boys, and men the majority are women. Women tend to be more highly targeted by traffickers due to the fact that they are seeking opportunity in an area of the world where limited economic opportunities are available for them. Unskilled and poorly educated women are commonly led into human trafficking. According to the UNODC report, the numbers for women and men in forced labor may be skewed due to the fact that only a few countries released the numbers for adult men. The forced labor market in this region also is dominated by male adults and females while the trade of children is evident it is considered small in comparison to the total. Most of these workers are undocumented and from different countries of origin than the country they work in. Countries like Thailand and Laos attract migrants of similar cultural backgrounds and language. Ethnic majority migrants from Laos are attracted to the similarities between the two countries and migrate to Thailand where they can assimilate easily. The combination of undocumented workers and similar cultures can cause problems for authorities to properly document and estimate the number of trafficked persons without confusing them for illegal immigrants and locals. Traffickers Three countries provided data showing that in Southeast Asia more women are prosecuted than men for crimes in human trafficking. The data also show that the participation rates among females in the trafficking business is trending equal to or higher than males. Traffickers in Southeast Asia are of both genders but in this region female proportions are higher than that of ones in the Americas or in Africa. Japan reported that traffickers of foreign nationalities have been increasing over the past several years. In 2006 up until 2009, 7 percent of persons convicted were foreign nationals while in 2009 that number had risen to 23 percent. Prevention policies The United Nations (UN) has released guidelines on how human trafficking can be prevented on an international scale. According to the guidelines nations should identify demand as a major cause for trafficking to exist. It is also recommended that poverty, inequality and discrimination be examined as these factors, depending on prevalence, can lead to trafficking. According to a report on human trafficking prevention, it is recommended that it is the government's job to improve the options that are available to its citizens and migrants through various programs that will lead to an overall improved life. Education on various opportunities and the many dangers of migrating through the help of human traffickers. Governments can also help by increasing law enforcement against traffickers to meet legal obligations and by providing proper identification to all citizens. The Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children ( sometimes referred to as the Trafficking Protocol) is a protocol created by the UN in order to help nations with human trafficking issues. The main purposes of the protocol are to create a guideline to initiate measures to prevent and combat human trafficking within the countries borders. The protocol is also used for the assistance and protection of the victims associated with human trafficking, while also creating cooperation between the parties of the state. All nations within Southeast Asia have signed and ratified this protocol. The most recent country to ratify the protocol is Thailand, in 2013. The United Nations International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families is an agreement that aims to make connections between human rights and migrant workers as well as their families. The agreement stresses the importance of migrant labor and the recognition that should be rewarded to the migrant worker, also arguing that the migrant worker is subject to equality and protection. This agreement has yet to be signed by many nations in Southeast Asia but there are a few that have signed and ratified the agreement like Indonesia and the Philippines and Cambodia which is yet to ratify. Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act are laws passed by many countries in Southeast Asia to prevent traffickers from using abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power and giving or receiving money to obtain consent from the individual for control over them as a means for the recruitment, transportation, harboring of individuals by means of force or threats, sale, lending and hiring of an individual with or without their consent. Countries such as Thailand, Myanmar, Malaysia, Philippines, Cambodia and Indonesia all have their own Anti-Trafficking in Person Acts that are used to prevent human trafficking and prosecute those who violate this act.

The single-track, non- electrified branch line runs from G√∂ttingen to Bodenfelde through the Weser Uplands. It is used mainly by local traffic, but it is also used by through traffic. The route was once used, for example, by D√ºsseldorf‚ÄìG√∂ttingen traffic. The only freight is from a basalt quarry in Adelebsen. Route The route runs approximately from the southeast to the northwest, with important intermediate stations at Lenglern and Adelebsen. It now branches about 3 kilometres north of G√∂ttingen station at the former Weende station from the Hanoverian Southern Railway (part of the old North‚ÄìSouth railway). Until the construction of the Hanover‚ÄìW√ºrzburg high-speed railway, it had its own track to G√∂ttingen station. It successively crosses the high-speed railway, federal highway 3 and the Leine. On the western edge of the Leine valley it passes under Autobahn 7 and rises briefly to L√∂dingsen. Between Emmenhausen and Offensen it runs through the M√ºnden Nature Park. From Adelebsen to Bodenfelde the line follows the Schw√ºlme river to the Weser river. This section is sometimes referred to as the Schw√ºlmetalbahn (Schw√ºlme Valley Railway). Vernawahlshausen station is located in the state of Hesse. From there it runs parallel to the Solling Railway, which it joins at Bodenfelde station. History During the planning of the Hanover‚ÄìHann. M√ºnden‚ÄìKassel railway (opened from Hanover to G√∂ttingen in 1854 and to Hann. M√ºnden in 1856) options to the west of the town were discussed. In the mid-1860s, a connection between G√∂ttingen and the Frederick William Northern Railway (Friedrich-Wilhelms- Nordbahn) at Bad Karlshafen via Adelebsen was discussed. This was demanded repeatedly especially in Adelebsen as its quarries had already become important. This line would have been useful for long-distance traffic, as the Halle‚ÄìKassel railway was extended via Arenshausen to G√∂ttingen in 1867, but an extension to Kassel was very controversial. Nevertheless, the Arenshausen‚ÄìM√ºnden link (connecting to Kassel) was completed in 1872. The Solling Railway via Uslar and Hardegsen was opened further north in 1878. This meant that east-west traffic skirted G√∂ttingen and Adelebsen. The construction of another mainline railway in the same general direction was not expected. Demands and discussions followed for three decades. Among other things, the western extension of the narrow-gauge Garte Valley Railway (Gartetalbahn, connecting Duderstadt and G√∂ttingen) via Adelebsen and Uslar to Sch√∂nhagen was planned from 1897 (the last section of this route was similar to the later Uslar‚ÄìSch√∂nhagen (Han) railway. From about 1901, the Prussian state railways became interested in this region. On 25 June 1904, the Prussian parliament approved a package of several secondary and light railways, including one from G√∂ttingen to Bodenfelde. In 1906 the route was surveyed and construction began in the spring of 1908. It was briefly interrupted by a flood on the line, but the terrain was unproblematic. The branch line with a maximum slope of 1:109 was less steep than the adjacent Solling Railway and the Dransfeld ramp of the Hanoverian Southern Railway. The G√∂ttingen‚ÄìBodenfelde railway was opened on 15 August 1910. =Operation until 1945 = The branch line was one of the most profitable in the country in the 1920s. 2,000 tonnes were loaded daily from three basalt quarries in Adelebsen. In addition, through traffic developed. The stations in Lenglern, Adelebsen and Verliehausen were upgraded from 1926 to 1928. During the Second World War, a munitions plant was connected to the line near Lenglern. During fighting in April 1945, this line, among other things, was also damaged by the bombardment of an ammunition train. Supposedly damage in Emmenhausen arose when the U.S. troops participated in the making of a film about the war and they set alight wagons carrying ammunition. The railway was restored to operation in mid-June. An Uerdingen railbus on the G√∂ttingen side of Vernawahlshausen station in about 1970. Behind (higher) is the Solling Railway =1950s to the 1980s = In the 1950s and early 1960s, traffic increased again, but did not reach the level of the pre-war period. The basalt quarry in Adelebsen was reopened and today it is the only quarry in operation. In contrast, a sawmill closed. From the mid-1960s passenger numbers declined. Eberhausen station was closed In 1973, Weende followed in 1976 and Lenglern, Emmenhausen and Verliehausen in 1988. Since 1976, only the services from G√∂ttingen route have stopped in Vernawahlshausen (see picture), those on the Solling Railway have since run through without stopping at the former junction station, the station building was demolished in the same year. Deutsche Bundesbahn several times favoured decommissioning the line in the medium-term or using the line only for long distance traffic between the Ruhr and G√∂ttingen. Neither of these options have been implemented to date. Until the opening of the new Egge Tunnel on the line between Kassel and Paderborn, many trains between Kassel and the Ruhr region were diverted via Adelebsen if the direct route through the Egge range was blocked by landslides, as in 1988. During the construction of the Hannover‚ÄìW√ºrzburg high-speed line a long bridge was built for the railway line to Bodenfelde, which later also crossed Federal highway 3. For the construction of the Hanover‚ÄìW√ºrzburg high-speed railway, the former access route to G√∂ttingen station was demolished. The traffic of the branch line was first diverted from Weende temporarily via the new line until the former railway embankment was extended by a bridge over the high- speed line and the new Federal highway 3 and connected to the railway at the former Weende station to the Hanover‚ÄìKassel railway. Thus, the trains to Bodenfelde were the first to run on the new line in G√∂ttingen. =Today = In December 2005, after prolonged pressure on Deutsche Bahn and the Lower Saxony state transport company (Landesnahverkehrsgesellschaft Niedersachsen), they reopened the station in Lenglern, which had been closed in 1988. The line, which was still working with mechanical signalboxes in Adelebsen and Bodenfelde, has been controlled by an electronic interlocking in G√∂ttingen since October 2008. The maximum speed on most of the line remains 60 km/h for the time being, contrary to the original announcements. While two level crossings were made technically secure with half barriers in Erbsen and L√∂dingsen in October/November 2013, the technical backup at some other level crossings is still unclear. The lack of several engineering backup systems have led to speed restrictions. Since late 2009, the section between Offensen (25.6 kilometres) and Bodenfelde can be run at 80 km/h. There is no wheelchair access to trains in Lenglern and Adelebsen. Trains can only be reached by stairs in Bodenfelde. Maps and directions to buses or taxis for the onward journey are missing at the halts at Leglern, L√∂dingsen, Offensen (Kr. Northeim) and Vernawahlshausen. Operations Since 15 December 2013, services on the line have been by operated by NordWestBahn GmbH. This has run at weekdays at hourly intervals. This represented an intensification of operations as the previous operator DB Regio had operated a two-hour regular interval service with additional Regionalbahn services for students since December 2007. Due to the lack of crossing facilities (which was only possible in Adelebsen), the journey time between Bodenfelde and G√∂ttingen was lengthened by about six to eight minutes with the reintroduction of hourly services and now amounts to around 50 minutes. The trains continue from Bodenfelde on the Solling Railway to Ottbergen, where there are good connections both towards Paderborn and towards H√∂xter, Holzminden and Kreiensen. The NordWestBahn operates three-part Bombardier Talent diesel railcars. DB Regio operated two-part LINT railcars until 14 December 2013. Until 2005, most DB services were operated with class 614 and 628 diesel multiple units. A Paderborn‚ÄìKreiensen/G√∂ttingen service was established with sections uncoupling in Ottbergen (thus offering a transfer-free connection between Paderborn and G√∂ttingen) at the timetable change in December 2015 (RB 84/RB 85). In 1910, there were five pairs of passenger trains with a travel time of 82 minutes, in 1937 there were ten pairs, in the 1950s there were 13 to 16 pairs, including several long-distance express trains that stopped only in Adelebsen. Until 1989, an Eilzug (semi-fast) service ran between the Ruhr and G√∂ttingen, which was upgraded to an express (D-Z√ºge) in 1983. The carriages ran to Bodenfelde as through coaches in the last few years.

HGC is also tasked with organizing large university-wide initiatives and events, managing and providing funding for university-wide student groups (USGs), as well as representing Harvard's graduate student population during conferences with other Ivy League universities and external organizations. In addition, HGC collaborates with its undergraduate counterpart, the Harvard Undergraduate Council (UC). HGC is a steward of the \\"One Harvard\\" movement, which aims to bring all of Harvard's graduate schools together through joint advocacy, closer collaboration, and social interaction. HGC is a federal-like student government organization: it consists of representatives from all 12 graduate schools but each of the twelve schools continues to operate some type of a local student council of its own. These local student councils focus on school-specific issues, whereas HGC's mandate extends to the entire University. Governance Membership All matriculated students of Harvard's twelve graduate and professional schools are members of the HGC: # Harvard Business School (HBS) # Harvard Divinity School (HDS) # Harvard Extension School (HES) # Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (GSAS) # Harvard Graduate School of Design (GSD) # Harvard Graduate School of Education (HGSE) # Harvard Kennedy School of Government (HKS) # Harvard Law School (HLS) # Harvard Medical School (HMS) # Harvard School of Dental Medicine (HSDM) # Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) # Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH) Leadership The governing body of the HGC is made of an Executive Board, School Representatives, and Committee Representatives. As of 2014, there were approximately 100 graduate and professional students serving on 7 committees and 23 subcommittees within the Leadership Council. Leadership Council meetings are held throughout the fall and spring semesters and are open to all students from Harvard‚Äôs graduate and professional schools Presidents * Chanthia Ma, (HMS) 2020-2021 * Bryan O.

At the center is the main Harvard University seal, which itself is surrounded by the 12 smaller seals of individual graduate schools. The HGC Seal contains one notable blank crest, which represents the Harvard Law School (HLS). Historically, Harvard Law was represented by the family coat-of-arms of its benefactor Isaac Royall Jr.; however, due to the seal's association with slavery, it was discontinued from use in 2016 and subsequently removed from all official Harvard documents and insignia, including the HGC Seal. Since HLS has not identified a replacement crest, the school continues to be represented by a blank crest on the HGC insignia.

It was written by Steven Moffat and directed by Douglas Mackinnon. In the episode, alien time traveller the Doctor (Peter Capaldi) attempts to track down a creature with the perfected ability to hide, while his companion Clara (Jenna Coleman) struggles with a date with former soldier Danny Pink (Samuel Anderson). \\"Listen\\" was watched by 7.01 million viewers in the UK and received critical acclaim for its script, direction and performances. Plot Clara, on a dinner date with Danny, gets into an argument on Danny's army career. She leaves him not wishing to aggravate the situation. At her flat, she finds the Twelfth Doctor, who wants her help to explore the idea of an entity with the perfect ability to hide, and how it may be tied to a childhood fear everyone has of a hand grabbing them from under one's bed. Young Danny's costume, and the figure under the bed, on display at the Doctor Who Experience. Clara uses the TARDIS' telepathic circuits to take her to her childhood, but her thoughts wander, and she lands the TARDIS at the children's home where Danny, then known as Rupert, grew up. Rupert is frightened by something under his bed spread. The Doctor suggests he use his fear to empower him, and Clara suggests he protect himself with his toy soldiers. Rupert is comforted and falls back asleep, and the Doctor scrambles his memory, giving Rupert dreams of being \\"Dan the soldier man\\", one of the toy soldiers. In the present, Clara returns to apologise to Danny, but her familiarity with his past troubles him, and he leaves. She is beckoned back to the TARDIS by a space-suited figure called Orson Pink, who has Dan the soldier man as an heirloom. While using the telepathic circuits, the Doctor had found Orson, one of humanity's first time travel pilots, stranded in his ship at the end of the universe. The Doctor returns to the ship in an attempt to observe the entity, while Clara and Orson wait in the TARDIS. An air seal ruptures and the Doctor falls unconscious. Orson rescues him, and Clara uses the telepathic circuits to try to return home. The TARDIS ends up in a barn, with a boy fitfully sleeping inside. Clara goes to investigate, but hides under the boy's bed when two adults enter, speaking of the child being unfit to be a Time Lord. She realises the boy is the Doctor. When the adults leave, the boy tries to leave the bed, but Clara grabs his ankle, recognising she created this fear in the Doctor. She repeats the Doctor's advice on fear to the boy and sees him to sleep. Back in the TARDIS, the Doctor recovers. Clara makes him promise not to learn where they are. The Doctor drops Orson and Clara off to their respective times. Clara and Danny mutually apologise for their behaviour before sharing a kiss. =Continuity= The reason for the War Doctor choosing an abandoned barn for his activation of 'The Moment' in 2013's \\"The Day of the Doctor\\" is revealed, as the barn is shown to be the Doctor's childhood home on Gallifrey. The Twelfth Doctor, upon awaking in the TARDIS, mentions \\"Sontarans perverting the course of human history\\" to Orson Pink, repeating his first words as the Fourth Doctor in Robot (1974‚Äì75). The line itself is a nod to the Third Doctor serial The Time Warrior (1973‚Äì74). There are similar nods to previous stories within the dialogue. The Twelfth Doctor states there is nothing to hear, \\"not a click or a tick\\" ‚Äì a Third Doctor line from Death to the Daleks (1974). The episode's final line, whispered by Clara to the young Doctor, is \\"Fear makes companions of us all\\" ‚Äì a line originally spoken by the First Doctor in the third episode of the very first Doctor Who serial, An Unearthly Child (1963). Douglas Mackinnon found a photo of First Doctor actor William Hartnell as a child, and had the hair team style the actor playing the young Doctor to resemble him. Production Steven Moffat discussed the episode in an interview, saying: \\"my impulse starting in that was just the idea, 'What does he do when he‚Äôs got nothing [to] do?' Because he‚Äôd throw himself off a building if he thought it‚Äôd be interesting on the way down ... he‚Äôs fascinated by anything. And here he‚Äôs with nothing to do, so he just goes out poking things with a stick until something bites it. And I think that‚Äôs quite interesting, isn't it? Sort of, there‚Äôs a thrill seeker aspect.\\" In a Doctor Who Magazine interview, Moffat revealed that the episode originated with the decision, \\"I'm going to do a chamber piece, with no money, in the middle [of the eighth series], because I haven't done one in ages and I'd like to prove that I can actually write.\\" The read-through for the episode took place on 11 February 2014, with filming beginning on the 17th, and taking place at The Rest in Porthcawl. Filming continued at the Mimosa restaurant in Mermaid Quay, Cardiff Bay, on 24‚Äì25 February 2014. Filming also took place in Bute Park and Whitchurch, Cardiff. The actor portraying the child Doctor is left uncredited in the episode, but was later identified in Doctor Who Magazine as Michael Jones. Leak As part of the series 8 leaks, \\"Listen\\" was one of five scripts to leak online from a BBC Worldwide server in Miami. This was followed on 23 August 2014 by the leak of the episode itself ‚Äì missing automated dialogue replacement and visual effects. The leak followed similar leaks of the preceding episodes \\"Deep Breath\\", \\"Into the Dalek\\", and \\"Robot of Sherwood\\", and the following episode \\"Time Heist\\". Broadcast and reception =Broadcast= Overnight, the episode garnered 4.81 million viewers in the UK ‚Äì a live audience share of 23.5%. Adjusted for non-live viewings, the episode was watched by a total of 7.01 million viewers, which led Doctor Who Magazine to tweet, nine days after broadcast, that in the UK, \\"Doctor Who: Listen was the seventh most watched TV show of the week, behind only Bake Off, Œß Factor (√ó2) & Corrie (√ó3).\\". In the United States, the original broadcast earned a total of 1.13 million viewers. =Critical reception= \\"Listen\\" received critical acclaim from critics, with many praising Moffat's script, Mackinnon's direction, and the performances of Capaldi, Coleman and Anderson. The episode achieved an Appreciation Index of 82 out of a possible 100. Labeling the episode as \\"possibly Steven Moffat's most terrifying episode to date\\", Neela Debnath of The Independent praised Coleman's performance, stating that \\"Clara was back on the top of her game\\". They called it \\"the most powerful episode of Doctor Who from Moffat to date ... a moving piece of drama as well as a terrifying piece of Saturday night television\\". Digital Spy praised the episode, awarding it a perfect 5 out of 5 and summing it up as \\"smart, scary [and] superb\\". They praised Moffat's script and the development of Clara's character, and closed their review by stating, \\"Intelligent, romantic and just scary enough, 'Listen' is either a moody tale of the supernatural or it's a clever reflection on the mind's own ability to fool and govern itself, but either way it's brilliant\\". Radio Times labelled the episode as \\"the most conceptual episode in the entire history of Doctor Who\\", and stated, \\"You're blowing our minds, Moffat\\". Writing for The Guardian, Dan Martin called the episode \\"phenomenally good\\", and suggested its script was one of Moffat's best ever. The A.V. Club awarded the episode an \\"A\\" grade, calling it \\"the best episode in years\\" and saying that \\"[they] might run out of superlatives for this one\\". They stated that \\"it is the best story Steven Moffat has written for the show since \\"The Eleventh Hour\\", and [that they] might be willing to go still further back than that in search of an episode of his that outdoes tonight's entry\\". They praised the analysis and development of the Doctor's character, and closed their review, saying, \\"'Listen' is just about the most honest exploration of the Doctor we've seen in 51 years. That it does all this without judgment, but rather with love and understanding, is what makes it special. It's what makes it Doctor Who.\\" Daily Mirror awarded the episode a 4 out of 5, stating, \\"Doctor Who should be about tapping into your fears, making you hide behind the cushion on the sofa. And 'Listen' delivers this in spades.\\" Mac Rogers of Slate praised \\"Listen\\" as \\"the best Doctor Who episode in years\\", arguing that it \\"proves that, deployed cleverly enough, Doctor Who can do anything.\\" Similarly, writer Paul Cornell praised the episode's interrogation of the Doctor's character and inversion of series clich√©s, suggesting that it \\"might be the best Doctor Who story ever.\\" In 2015 the episode was nominated for a Bram Stoker Award, becoming the first Doctor Who episode to be nominated for the award. \\"Listen\\" was also nominated for the 2015 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation (Short Form).

It was first broadcast on BBC One on 20 September 2014. The episode was written by Stephen Thompson and Steven Moffat, and directed by Douglas Mackinnon. In the episode, the alien time traveller the Doctor (Peter Capaldi), along with human companion Clara Oswald (Jenna Coleman), mutant human Saibra (Pippa Bennett-Warner), and augmented human Psi (Jonathan Bailey), get recruited to break into and rob the secure Bank of Karabraxos, which is protected by a telepathic alien called the Teller (Ross Mullan). The episode was watched by 6.99 million viewers in the UK, receiving generally positive reviews from television critics. Plot In Clara's flat, the Twelfth Doctor answers the TARDIS's phone; both are surprised to find themselves in a room with two others: Psi, a hacker with an augmented brain, and Saibra, a mutant shapeshifter. A recording includes messages from each agreeing to a short-term memory wipe, before getting instructions from the Architect to break into the Bank of Karabraxos and steal three items from its vault. The Teller and its guards, shown here at the Doctor Who Symphonic Spectacular. The head of bank security Ms. Delphox uses a telepathic alien called the Teller to detect those with criminal intent and destroy their brains; the Doctor believes the memory wipes were needed to avoid being caught. Within, the Doctor, Clara, Saibra, and Psi find six devices left by the Architect that appear to be atomic shredders, to be used if they are caught to die quickly and painlessly. Both Saibra and Psi sacrifice themselves with shredders when they encounter the Teller, allowing the Doctor and Clara to reach the vault door. The door appears impossible to open, but then a solar storm strikes the planet's surface, triggering an automatic unlocking sequence; the Doctor realises this was a \\"time travel heist\\". They recover two items: a serum to stabilise Saibra's DNA, and a circuit to restore Psi's long-term memories. The Doctor and Clara are captured and brought to Delphox's office. The guards reveal themselves as Saibra and Psi; the shredders are actually short-range teleports to an escape ship in orbit. The storm threatens to destroy the Bank, but the Doctor wants to uncover the third item. They meet the Bank's director Madame Karabraxos in her private vault. Karabraxos directs Ms. Delphox to have the Teller brought to the vault, before having Delphox incinerated for letting Karabraxos down. Before Karabraxos departs, the Doctor gives her the TARDIS phone number to use when she has a moment of regret. When the Teller arrives, the Doctor lets it restore his short-term memory. The call to the TARDIS was from a dying Karabraxos, regretting something she left in the vault. The Doctor became the Architect of the time heist to assemble Saibra and Psi and plant the teleports to get them to this point. The Doctor shows them why they had six teleports: Karabraxos wanted him to rescue the Teller's mate that she had locked up to force the Teller's cooperation. The Teller frees its mate. The two are evacuated to an unpopulated planet to live out in peace. = Continuity = Memory worms were first introduced in the 2012 Christmas special, \\"The Snowmen\\". When Psi tries to lure the Teller away from Clara by visualising some of the galaxy's most notorious criminals, the mugshots he is seen accessing include a Sensorite (from the 1964 serial The Sensorites), a Terileptil (from the 1982 serial The Visitation), a Slitheen, an Ice Warrior, the Gunslinger from \\"A Town Called Mercy\\", Captain John Hart from Torchwood, Androvax and the Trickster from The Sarah Jane Adventures, and Abslom Daak from Doctor Who Magazine. Production Speaking about the premise for the episode, director Douglas Mackinnon said ‚ÄúWhat we wanted to do was a heist movie for Doctor Who. I've watched virtually every heist movie there's ever been, and it incorporates things into it, but because it's Doctor Who, time travel is involved.\\" The read-through for the episode took place on 11 February 2014. Filming began on 3 March 2014. Filming took place at George Street in Bridgend on 5 March 2014, and in Roald Dahl Plass, Cardiff Bay on 13 March. Filming continued at the Hadyn Ellis Building, part of Cardiff University, on 18 March 2014, and at the nearby Bute Park the next day. Media coverage of filming made note of a new monster that was spotted on set, with some calling it Doctor Who's \\"strangest monster yet.\\" Scenes were also filmed at the Uskmouth Power Station, previously a location for \\"The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe\\" and \\"Into the Dalek\\".

The episode achieved an Appreciation Index of 84. =Critical reception= The episode received generally positive reviews. Digital Spy said the episode \\"should have been 15 minutes longer\\" and \\"crammed too many ideas into 45 minutes.\\" Ben Lawrence, writing in The Daily Telegraph noted that \\"in a show that is sometimes rather burdened by the need to maintain clever story arcs, Time Heist was a standalone episode that allowed some breathing space.\\" Den of Geek stated that it was \\"A solid, fun episode of Who... Not the best, but enjoyable. It came together well\\" and that it \\"had enough in the tank to keep us happily entertained for 45 minutes\\".. Writing for SFX, Nick Setchfield praised director Douglas Mackinnon's \\"visual flair\\", but felt the episode as a whole was \\"solid, mid-tier Who but... not the smooth criminal it could have been.\\" In a review for the Radio Times, Patrick Mulkern said the episode was \\"singularly unengaging\\" despite being based on an interesting concept. Mulkern did, however, praise the performances of Jenna Coleman and Peter Capaldi, described as \\"the right man for the job but doesn‚Äôt always get the material he deserves.\\" References External links  * Twelfth Doctor episodes 2014 British television episodes Television episodes written by Steven Moffat Television episodes written by Stephen Thompson (writer) Television episodes about bank robbery ","title":"Time Heist"},{"id":"42485687","text":"\\"Mummy on the Orient Express\\" is the eighth episode of the eighth series of the British science fiction television programme Doctor Who. It was first broadcast on BBC One on 11 October 2014. The episode was written by Jamie Mathieson, and directed by Paul Wilmshurst. In the episode, the alien time traveller the Doctor (Peter Capaldi) investigates the deaths of passengers on board a space-bound train, who claim to have seen a mummy that is not visible to others prior to their deaths. The episode received positive reviews from television critics. Plot In the luxury dining car of a train, elderly Mrs. Pitt sees a man dressed as a \\"mummy monster thing\\", and a 66 second clock starts at the bottom of the screen. She asks her granddaughter Maisie if there's some sort of fancy dress going on, but Maisie can't see him. Mrs. Pitt tries to get help, but the guard can't see him either! As the clock reaches 5, Mrs. Pitt is sitting helpless in her chair. 4, the mummy is approaching closer. 3, the mummy has its face in Mrs. Pitt's. 2, the mummy now has its hands on her head. 1, she tries and fails to get it away. 0, Mrs. Pitt collapses and dies... Clara is ready to go on one \\"last hurrah\\". She allows the Twelfth Doctor to take her aboard a space-bound train modelled after the Orient Express. Unknown to Clara, the train's computer Gus has enticed the Doctor along with many other scientists there. They learn of the death of Mrs. Pitt after witnessing a mummy that no other passenger could see attack her, which makes the Doctor curious. The Doctor discovers the death of Mrs. Pitt and similar deaths on the train occurred exactly 66 seconds after lights flickered nearby; this follows the legend of a supernatural being called the Foretold. The Foretold, as shown at the Doctor Who Experience. When the Doctor expresses suspicion at the number of scientists gathered, the facade of the Orient Express disappears, revealing a laboratory; Gus informs the passengers they are now to study the Foretold to reverse engineer whatever technology it uses. The Doctor also realises the sarcophagus Clara and Mrs. Pitt's granddaughter Maisie had found in the storage car is for capturing the Foretold. Professor Moorhouse and Captain Quell are the next targets killed by the Foretold. The Doctor and chief engineer Perkins identify that the Foretold is draining energy from its victims using phase-shifting technology. Perkins also identifies that the victims were the medically weakest on the train. When Perkins identifies that Maisie is likely next due to her trauma, Clara lies to Maisie to bring her to the laboratory. Maisie sees the Foretold; the Doctor quickly draws on her memories to trick the Foretold into targeting him instead. In the 66 seconds, the Doctor successfully identifies the Foretold as a modified stealth soldier of a long-ago war and offers surrender to tell the Foretold that the war is over. The Foretold, finally released from its duty, offers the Doctor a salute before it disappears into a pile of dust, leaving behind its phase-shifting device. The Doctor evacuates Clara and the passengers to the TARDIS using the Foretold's device, and drops off the passengers to a nearby planet. He tells Clara that he tried hacking Gus to find who brought everyone to the train but Gus activated a self-destruct to keep the truth hidden. The Doctor explains that sometimes the only choices are bad choices and that he would move on to the next of the Foretold's victims until he beat it. Danny phones Clara to ask if she has said her final goodbyes to the Doctor. As she hangs up, she lies to the Doctor that Danny accepts her continuing to travel with the Doctor. =Continuity= The question \\"Are you my mummy?\\" is a reference to the Ninth Doctor episodes \\"The Empty Child\\"/\\"The Doctor Dances\\" (2005).

It was first broadcast on BBC One on 18 October 2014. The episode was written by Jamie Mathieson and directed by Douglas Mackinnon. In the episode, the alien time traveller the Doctor (Peter Capaldi) is trapped inside his time machine and spaceship the TARDIS after the TARDIS's external dimensions get shrunk by two-dimensional extraterrestrial creatures, which he ultimately dubs the Boneless, in present-day Bristol. Assisted by local graffiti artist Rigsy (Joivan Wade), the Doctor's companion Clara (Jenna Coleman) carries the miniature TARDIS with her and temporarily takes over the Doctor's role of trying to protect humanity from alien incursions. The episode received positive reviews, with particular praise for Coleman's performance. Plot The Twelfth Doctor discovers something draining energy from the TARDIS and materialises in Bristol. Clara befriends Rigsy, a graffiti artist assigned to community service on a council estate. He tells Clara that several people have gone missing. When Clara returns to the Doctor, the exterior dimensions of the TARDIS have shrunk too small for the Doctor to leave. The Doctor passes Clara his sonic screwdriver, psychic paper, and an earpiece to let him communicate with her, and she carries the TARDIS in her bag, acting as the Doctor. Clara convinces PC Forrest to let her and Rigsy into the flat of the first disappearance. They hear Forrest scream from the next room. They see no sign of her, but find a strange mural on the wall. The Doctor recognises it as a human nervous system, and suspects it is Forrest's. He warns Clara and Rigsy that there are two-dimensional creatures, the Boneless, which are flattening the missing persons into two dimensions. Clara and Rigsy escape before they are attacked. The 2dis, the device that restores dimensions, as shown at the Doctor Who Experience. They race back to the other community service crewmen to warn them the murals in a pedestrian subway are additional Boneless. Some crewmen are killed while Clara leads the rest through a train yard into tunnels. They are followed by the Boneless, which take the form of the people they killed to use the third dimension. The Boneless surround the others by flattening the doors into two dimensions. The Doctor jury-rigs a device to undo this flattening to give the group time to escape. In their haste, Clara drops the TARDIS in the path of an oncoming train. The Doctor turns on Siege Mode, preventing any physical damage but leaving him without enough power to deactivate Siege Mode. Clara has Rigsy paint a realistic door on a large poster. The poster is hung over an access tunnel to lure the Boneless to it. The Boneless, thinking it is a flattened door, funnel their energy into it to restore it, but instead they power the TARDIS that Clara placed behind the poster. The TARDIS reverts to its normal size and form, and the Doctor erects a barrier to hold the Boneless in place. Realising the Boneless have no peaceful intentions, he returns them to their dimension. The Doctor asks Clara how she enjoyed being the Doctor for the day. Elsewhere, Missy watches Clara, muttering to herself that she has \\"chosen well\\". =Continuity= The TARDIS exterior was also shrunk to the size of a dollhouse in the serial Logopolis (1981), with the Fourth Doctor trapped inside.

Overview There are tools related to each organization's department which can be classified for each aspect of management. For example: planning tools, process tools, records tools, employee related tools, decision making tools, control tools, etc. A classification by function would consider these general aspects: * Tools used for data input and validation in any department. * Tools used for controlling and improving business processes. * Tools used for data consolidation and decision making. Nowadays, management tools have evolve dramatically in last decade thanks to fast technology advances, so fast that it is difficult to select the best business tools for any situation in any company. This is caused by a never ending fight for lower costs and increase sales, the willing for understanding the customers' needs and the fight for delivering the products that meets their need in the way they require. Under this scenario managers should take a strategic attitude to business management tools instead of going for latest tool. Usually managers rely on the tools without any adaptation which leads to an unstable situation. Business management tools should be selected carefully, and then adapted to the organization needs and not the other way around.  Most used  In 2013, a survey conducted by Bain & Company showed how business tools are used around the globe. These tools reflect how their outcomes contribute to each region's needs, considering the downfall and companies' market situation. The top ten includes: *Strategic planning *Customer relationship management *Employee engagement surveys *Benchmarking *Balanced scorecard *Core competency *Outsourcing *Change management programs *Supply chain management *Mission statement and vision statement *Market segmentation *Total quality management  Software application for businesses  Application software focused on businesses is implementations IT departments use to enhance business productivity, searching for superior performance and devoted to create value and therefore competitive advantage. It started with Management Information Systems and extended into enterprise resource planning systems. Then customer relationship management was added to the solution and finally the whole package moved into the cloud business management space. Although there is an actual correlation between IT efforts and the organizations' performance, two elements are key to add value to the sum; these are the implementation's effectiveness and the proper tools selections and adaptation process.  Tools for SMEs  The tools focused on SMEs are important because they are a way to save money and make entrepreneur's businesses more profitable. These tools have different functionalities such as project management, track finances, manage projects, share documents, connect and network, manage social media and marketing, also everyday use such as word processing or spreadsheets. Their main objective is help entrepreneurs to achieve everyday duties in a much simple way and mostly free. The downside to take in consideration is that some of the apps may be unreliable or will require organizations to advertise them.

The conflict came to an end after a military and diplomatic intervention by the United States resulted in the Pact of Espino Negro, which began the Peace of Tipitapa. Although the civil war came to an end, one Liberal general, Augusto C√©sar Sandino, refused to lay down his arms and waged the Sandino Rebellion against the Nicaraguan government and the US Marine Corps until 1933. Background Nicaragua had been occupied by one hundred American Marines since the former country's civil war of 1912. The Nicaraguan presidential election of 1924 brought a coalition government to power, with Conservative Carlos Sol√≥rzano being president and Liberal Dr. Juan B. Sacasa being vice president. On 27 January 1925, Emiliano Chamorro, former president of Nicaragua and member of the Conservative Party, launched a coup d'√©tat when his \\"ultra-conservative partisans\\" seized Loma Fortress, the military building \\"dominating Managua\\" (the Nicaraguan capital), forcing Sol√≥rzano and Sacasa to flee the country. He also removed all liberals from the Nicaraguan Congress. The United States refused to recognize Chamorro's regime, since it had come to power through \\"unconstitutional means\\". War breaks out The situation deteriorated into civil war on the 2 May 1926 when a group of Liberal exiles landed at Bluefields. Soon, the east coast of Nicaragua was ablaze with rebellion. Liberal forces wore red hatbands, while the Conservatives donned blue ones. However, many soldiers carried both colors in case they were wounded and required medical attention from the enemy's side. The primary commander of the Liberals on this coast was Jos√© Mar√≠a Moncada, who fought to make the exiled Dr. Sacasa president. Another Liberal general was Anastasio Somoza Garc√≠a, who led an army in the southwestern part of Nicaragua. American Marines and sailors were sent to occupy the country's ports to establish \\"neutral zones\\", which would prevent fighting in these areas and push the Liberal rebels inland. The United States was deeply concerned with matters in Nicaragua, since the left-wing government of Mexico was supplying the rebels with arms. To try to put an end to the conflict, the United States arranged a truce and had Lawrence Dennis oversee Conservative and Liberal representatives at a meeting aboard the USS Denver on the 1 October 1926. Nothing came out of the conference and fighting resumed shortly afterwards. On the 11 November 1926, Chamorro resigned from the presidency, leaving Sebasti√°n Uriza holding the reins of power. On 14 November Adolfo D√≠az, who was referred to as \\"our Nicaraguan\\" by the United States, became president and was recognized by the U.S. Dr. Sacasa returned to Nicaragua on the 1 December 1926, arriving at the port of Puerto Cabezas and proclaiming a rival government, which was only recognized by Mexico. In January 1927, U.S. president Calvin Coolidge lifted the arms embargo on the Nicaraguan government, allowing his country to legally provide military aid to the Conservatives. Moncada's forces began marching westwards towards Managua, defeating Conservative forces along the way. Meanwhile, Liberals led by Francisco Paraj√≥n struck at the city of Chinandega, causing one of the most destructive battles of the war. The battle raged from 6 to 9 February 1927, and saw 500 Conservative defenders face off against between 600 and 2,000 Liberal attackers, with \\"hundreds [being] killed on each side.\\" During the fighting, much of the city was destroyed by fire. The blaze was \\"probably\\" caused by Liberal soldiers or \\"civilian looters\\", but many blamed two American airmen flying for the Conservative government. Eventually, the rebels were driven from the city after some bitter house-to-house fighting. With the Liberals advancing on Managua, the United States found itself on the verge of war. It couldn't afford to let a left-wing Mexican-backed regime rise to power in the region. D√≠az appealed to American fears of communism by saying the rebels were Bolshevist in nature. Marine reconnaissance aircraft flying for the Conservatives were already occasionally receiving fire from Liberal forces, although the more \\"[r]esponsible\\" rebel officers tried to prevent a clash with the Americans. Peace of Tipitapa To put an end to the civil war without using the Marines to actively fight the Liberals, Coolidge sent Henry L. Stimson to negotiate an end to hostilities. Traveling across the war- scarred Central American nation, Stimson met Moncada at the town of Tipitapa, which sits along the river of the same name, on the 4 May 1927. Here, Moncada agreed to the Peace of Tipitapa, ending the conflict. The conditions of the peace were that Adolfo D√≠az would remain president until a new, American- supervised election in 1928, both sides would disarm, and a new National Guard would be established. Any soldier who turned in a rifle or machine gun would be given the equivalent of ten U.S. dollars. In all, the Liberals turned in 31 machine guns and 3,704 rifles, while the Conservatives turned in 308 machine guns and 10,445 rifles. Sandino's role Augusto C√©sar Sandino played a notable role in the civil war as a general on the Liberal side. His first battle saw him and twenty-nine of his followers try to take the town of El J√≠caro, which was held by a force of two hundred Conservatives, on the 2 November 1926. Sandino's men managed to kill \\"some\\" of the defenders (while suffering no fatalities), but failed to capture the village. Later, in early March 1927, he and one hundred men managed to repulse a government attack on their position on Mount Yucapuca in a seven-hour battle. The Conservatives numbered four hundred and were armed with six machine guns. Sandino scored another victory when he and two hundred followers attacked the city of Jinotega on the 28 March 1927 and captured it \\"[a]fter a day of fierce fighting,\\" while serving on Jos√© Mar√≠a Moncada's right flank. However, Moncada had no love for Sandino and ordered him to take the city of Boaco, apparently neglecting to warn him about the strong government garrison there. After observing Boaco's defenses for himself, Sandino decided not to attack and to tag along with Moncada instead. Sandino would consider the latter a traitor after he agreed to the Peace of Tipitapa. Aftermath Despite an end to the fighting, American Marines would face renegade Liberals, possibly led by Francisco Sequeira (\\"General Cabulla\\"), in combat at the Battle of La Paz Centro on the 16 May 1927. Two Americans were fatally wounded and at least fourteen Nicaraguans perished in the firefight. Augusto C√©sar Sandino viewed the peace settlement as treasonous and would fight a guerrilla war against the Marines and Nicaraguan National Guard until 1933. The first battle of his rebellion took place at Ocotal on the 16 July 1927.

He was the brother of Albert Parsons, a pioneer American socialist/anarchist and newspaper editor who also served in the Confederate Army, and the brother-in-law of Lucy Parsons, American labor organizer and socialist/communist. Biography Although born in New Jersey, Parsons grew up in Montgomery, Alabama. He attended Emory College in Oxford, Georgia, but he left college to fight in Mexico under Zachary Taylor. Parsons later worked in the newspaper business in Texas. When the Civil War began, he received a commission as a colonel from Governor Edward Clark. His Fourth Regiment Texas Volunteer Cavalry became the Twelfth Texas Cavalry when the unit was mustered into the Confederate States Army on October 28, 1861. Parsons helped defend Little Rock, Arkansas against a Union army led by Brigadier General Samuel Curtis and Louisiana from Major General Nathaniel Banks. He was recommended for the rank of brigadier general several times. After the war, he left Texas to investigate the possibility of establishing a Confederate colony in British Honduras. He returned to be elected to the Texas State Senate. In 1871, President Grant appointed him a centennial commissioner, and he moved to New York. In 1907, he died at the home of his son in Chicago and was buried in Mount Hope Cemetery, Hastings-on-Hudson, New York.

February 8, 1975, Ossining, New York, United States) was a structural and electrical engineer known as a maker of bamboo fly rods and co-author of A Master's Guide To Building A Bamboo Fly Rod. Everett Garrison's methods and designs have been utilized by generations of bamboo fly rod makers. His rods fetch high prices from collectors.  Early life  Everett Garrison was born in Yonkers in the winter of 1893. He was of Dutch ancestry. His father was an engineer who held two degrees from Columbia University. His family owned and operated a steam driven barge business along the Hudson River.Garrison, Everett and Carmichael, Hoagy B. (1997). A Master's Guide to Building a Bamboo Fly Rod. Far Hills, New Jersey: Meadow Run Press. Garrison grew up in Yonkers and went on to study electrical engineering at Union College, where he earned a degree in 1916. He tested steel for Curtiss-Wright aircraft engines, and later became involved in railroad construction.Schwiebert, Ernest (1984). Trout. New York, New York: E.P. Dutton. He also lived in Staten Island and Ossining, New York. He was married to Charlotte Goff.  Innovator of bamboo rod building  In 1922, Garrison met George Parker Holden, author of The Idyll of the Split- Bamboo.Holden, George Parker (1998). Idyll of the Split Bamboo. Bedford, Massachusetts: Applewood Books. Initially, Garrison was interested in bamboo construction as a way to improve the shafts on his golf clubs and began to visit Holden at his house in Yonkers. Both men were avid golfers, both also shared a love of fly fishing. It was there that Garrison made his first bamboo fly rods. In 1927, when expecting his second child, Garrison suffered from a neurological malady coupled with a debilitating depression, during which time he turned to designing a new type of bamboo fly rod. Whereas other rod designers had been using empirical methods, Garrison used engineering principles to create the foundations for his revolutionary taper designs. From a hospital bed, Garrison used an understanding of casting mechanics and the physical properties of bamboo to derive a stress analysis formula to use as a basis for plotting the final dimensions of a fly rod. Everett Garrison had many other credits to his name in the world of fly fishing. He coined the term \\"Parabolic Fly Rod\\" to describe an early prototype belonging to Charles Ritz. He also designed the tools needed to hand-split and hand-plane the bamboo used in his rods, including an adjustable planing form and a glue binding machine that were capable of holding tolerances to .001\\" which are in common usage to this day. Garrison first reached acclaim when he made rods for author John Alden Knight and members of the Anglers' Club of New York, for whom Garrison gave a lecture on rodmaking in 1933. John Alden Knight described Garrison in the book The Modern Angler as a meticulous craftsman capable of unique precision.Knight, John Alden (1936). The Modern Angler. New York/London: Charles Scribner's Sons. The appearance of Everett Garrison's rods reflect his ethos of design and construction. The relatively small number of rods he made during his career are a tribute to quality craftsmanship and a philosophy of performance through simplicity of design. The aesthetics of his fishing rods were not concerned with artifice or embellishment and were never altered. He worked at his craft nights and weekends until he retired from a structural engineering firm in 1972, after which he built rods and perfected his equipment full-time until his health began to fail in 1974. He died on February 8, 1975. It is estimated he made approximately 650 rods in his lifetime. Hoagy B. Carmichael was making the documentary film Creating the Garrison Fly RodCreating the Garrison Fly Rod. Hoagy B. Carmichael. Lazy Bones. 2006 DVD when he became an apprentice to Garrison. They were collaborating on a book when Garrison died. Carmichael completed the manuscript using notebooks, recordings and photographs. When published in 1977, A Master's Guide to Building a Bamboo Fly Rod made accessible to hobbyists and enthusiasts the methods of a craft that had previously been shrouded in secrecy.Maurer, George E. and Elser, Bernard P.
