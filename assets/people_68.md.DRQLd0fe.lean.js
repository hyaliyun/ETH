Algae may be cultivated for the purposes of biomass production (as in a seaweed cultivator), wastewater treatment, CO2 fixation, or aquarium/pond filtration in the form of an algae scrubber. Algae bioreactors vary widely in design, falling broadly into two categories: open reactors and enclosed reactors. Open reactors are exposed to the atmosphere while enclosed reactors, also commonly called photobioreactors, are isolated to varying extent from the atmosphere. Specifically, algae bioreactors can be used to produce fuels such as biodiesel and bioethanol, to generate animal feed, or to reduce pollutants such as NOx and CO2 in flue gases of power plants. Fundamentally, this kind of bioreactor is based on the photosynthetic reaction which is performed by the chlorophyll- containing algae itself using dissolved carbon dioxide and sunlight energy. The carbon dioxide is dispersed into the reactor fluid to make it accessible for the algae. The bioreactor has to be made out of transparent material. The algae are photoautotroph organisms which perform oxygenic photosynthesis. The equation for photosynthesis: :\\\\begin{matrix}\\\\mathrm{6\\\\; CO_2 + 6\\\\; H_2O \\\\quad \\\\longrightarrow \\\\;C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6\\\\; O_2} \\\\qquad \\\\Delta H^0 = + 2 870\\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{kJ}}{\\\\mathrm{mol}}\\\\end{matrix}  Historical background  Some of the first experiments with the aim of cultivating algae were conducted in 1957 by the \\"Carnegie Institution\\" in Washington. In these experiments, monocellular Chlorella were cultivated by adding CO2 and some minerals. In the early days, bioreactors were used which were made of glass and later changed to a kind of plastic bag. The goal of all this research has been the cultivation of algae to produce a cheap animal feed.  Frequently used photo reactor types  Nowadays 3 basic types of algae photobioreactors have to be differentiated, but the determining factor is the unifying parameter ‚Äì the available intensity of sunlight energy.  Plate photobioreactor  A plate reactor simply consists of vertically arranged or inclined rectangular boxes which are often divided in two parts to effect an agitation of the reactor fluid. Generally these boxes are arranged into a system by linking them. Those connections are also used for making the process of filling/emptying, introduction of gas and transport of nutritive substances, easier. The introduction of the flue gas mostly occurs at the bottom of the box to ensure that the carbon dioxide has enough time to interact with algae in the reactor fluid.  Tubular photobioreactor  A tubular reactor consists of vertical or horizontal arranged tubes, connected together to a pipe system. The algae- suspended fluid is able to circulate in this tubing. The tubes are generally made out of transparent plastics or borosilicate glass and the constant circulation is kept up by a pump at the end of the system. The introduction of gas takes place at the end/beginning of the tube system. This way of introducing gas causes the problem of deficiency of carbon dioxide, high concentration of oxygen at the end of the unit during the circulation, and bad efficiency.  Bubble column photobioreactor  A bubble column photo reactor consists of vertical arranged cylindrical column, made out of transparent material. The introduction of gas takes place at the bottom of the column and causes a turbulent stream to enable an optimum gas exchange. At present these types of reactors are built with a maximum diameter of 20 cm to 30 cm in order to ensure the required supply of sunlight energy. The biggest problem with the sunlight determined construction is the limited size of the diameter. Feuermann et al. invented a method to collect sunlight with a cone shaped collector and transfer it with some fiberglass cables which are adapted to the reactor in order to enable constructions of a column reactor with wider diameters. - on this scale the energy consumption due to pumps etc. and the CO2 cost of manufacture may outweigh the CO2 captured by the reactor.  Industrial usage  The cultivation of algae in a photobioreactor creates a narrow range of industrial application possibilities. Some power companies already established research facilities with algae photobioreactors to find out how efficient they could be in reducing CO2 emissions, which are contained in flue gas, and how much biomass will be produced. Algae biomass has many uses and can be sold to generate additional income. The saved emission volume can bring an income too, by selling emission credits to other power companies.Umweltbundesamt The utilisation of algae as food is very common in East Asian regions. Most of the species contain only a fraction of usable proteins and carbohydrates, and a lot of minerals and trace elements. Generally, the consumption of algae should be minimal because of the high iodine content, particularly problematic for those with hyperthyroidism. Likewise, many species of diatomaceous algae produce compounds unsafe for humans. The algae, especially some species which contain over 50 percent oil and a lot of carbohydrates, can be used for producing biodiesel and bioethanol by extracting and refining the fractions. This point is very interesting, because the algae biomass is generated 30 times faster than some agricultural biomass, which is commonly used for producing biodiesel.

Their concerts are famous for their intensity and spectacle, and they're able to make tens of thousands of people to frantically support them during their shows. Some of the biggest metal and hard rock bands have asked them to be their special guests. Deep Purple, Mot√∂rhead, Soulfly, Slayer, Anthrax, Helloween, HammerFall are just some of the bands Rising Dream have supported during the years. Iron Maiden has hand-picked Rising Dream to be their special guest at the stadium show in Split, Croatia on August 10, 2008, in front of over 20,000 fans.Rirock.com Accessed 17 Apr 2010. Rising Dream was the only band on the entire Maiden tour that got the chance to play their full 70-minute show. The debut album's producer Denis Mujad≈æiƒá Denyken is the most famous and most awarded Croatian rock and metal producer, and Visions of Atlantis and Aesma Daeva singer Melissa Ferlaak appears as a special guest. In October 2008, Rising Dream have recorded their live performance in front of the Croatian national television's cameras, thus becoming the first metal performers to get significant treatment from that particular broadcasting company. Beginning the April 23rd, Rising Dream, together with German thrash metal band Destruction began a special leg of the Destruction world tour D.E.V.O.L.U.T.I.O.N., which is also first leg of their Failed Tour 2009, showcasing their album Failed Apocalypse all around Europe. This leg will occupy 12 shows in 8 countries (Switzerland, Italy, Austria, Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Greece and Serbia).

The ceremony may be arranged by a government organization, a society, a school, a trade association or even a company that specializes in running awards ceremonies. Typically a master of ceremonies presents award winners, speaks to the audience, entertains people, and generally keeps the ceremony moving. Ancient Greece The Ancient Greeks held annual competitions for tragedy and comedy, financed by the wealthiest citizens. Awards were given out for best play, best producer and best actor. In the early Olympic Games there were two awards ceremonies. After each event the judges gave palm branches to the winners. On the last day of the games all the event winners were announced, and were crowned with olive garlands. No medals were given, and only the winner was announced, since the runners-up were not considered significant. It was not unusual for the athletes to risk heavy fines and to bribe the judges to be declared winners. Modern ceremonies Components of a modern awards ceremony typically include: *A defined and equitable method of choosing the winners *A venue, which may be a hotel, theatre or other facility. Dinner and entertainment may also be provided to attendees. *A master of ceremonies *Technical equipment such as microphones, speakers and video projectors *Invitations to selected attendees *Arrangements for journalists to cover the ceremony *Certificates or trophies for the winners American media awards The major American media awards have evolved into major prime-time television ceremonies, but had small beginnings. The first awards by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences were held in 1929 at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel three months after the winners had been announced. The Oscar statuettes for best movie, best actress and best actor were given out in a 15-minute ceremony. The Golden Globe Awards were founded in 1944 by eight journalists who had formed the Hollywood Foreign Correspondents Association. They arranged for a luncheon at 20th Century Fox where scrolls were given for best picture, best actress and best actor. The Tony Awards for theatrical plays and musicals were first presented at the Waldorf Astoria New York in 1947. The Academy of Television Arts & Sciences presented the first Emmy Awards at the Hollywood Athletic Club in 1949. The first Grammy Awards were given by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences in 1958, with Volare winning the Best Single award. The first Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards presented the Award show in 1988. Major English-language entertainment awards ceremonies in January /February/March of each year now include: New York Film Critics Circle, Critics Choice, American Cinema Editors, Producers Guild of America, Screen Actors Guild, Directors Guild of America, American Society of Cinematographers, Grammy Awards, Costume Designers Guild, Art Directors Guild Writers Guild of America, British Academy of Film and Television Arts, Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards, Independent Spirit Awards and the Academy Awards.

Kvittingen (20 February 1906 ‚Äì 13 January 1996) was a Norwegian bacteriologist and chief physician in Trondheim, and resistance member during World War II. He was a microbacteriologist, and worked at the Bacteriological Laboratory of the Norwegian Armed Forces before World War II. When Germany invaded and occupied Norway in 1940, the laboratory was closed. Kvittingen fled the country to conduct resistance work abroad. In London he worked with medicinal services for Norwegians in exile. Among others, he contributed to drastically improve the treatment of venereal diseases in seamen, reducing the convalescence from months to weeks. Kvittingen had become known among the British when securing the retreat of four British troops gone astray in Norwegian mountains in May 1940. He had experience from 1935 in Italian-occupied Ethiopia, where he led the retreat of a failed Norwegian \\"expedition\\". Thus, in the autumn of 1940 he was asked to be head recruiter of Norwegian agents for the Special Operations Executive. He has been credited with recruiting Martin Linge as an SOE agent, but that particular suggestion really came from Olav Rytter in correspondence with Kvittingen. After the war, Kvittingen returned to microbiology, and also expanded his interest to other medical fields. In 1952 he became chief physician at Trondheim Central Hospital. He was decorated with the HM The King's Medal of Merit and the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav as well as foreign orders of merit, and died in January 1996.

The canal is 118 km long and part of the Danube-Tisa-Danube Canal system. The excavation works of Great Baƒçka Canal began in 1794 and went on until 1801 in B√°cs-Bodrog County, Kingdom of Hungary. The Bed of the canal is 17 m wide and 25 m wide at the top. The average depth is 3 m. The water of the canal is very polluted because it runs through industrial towns, such as Vrbas, Kula and Crvenka. Because of the long-lasting pollution problem, the canal not only is too small for navigation, but is also dangerous to bathe in. The ministry of protection of environment of Serbia included it in the list of the country's ¬´three black points¬ª. The pollution of the canal began in the second half of the 20th century with plumes of waste in its waters. According to a number of researchers, the canal is considered one of the most polluted reservoirs in Europe and poses a threat to human health among the people living in nearby settlements. At the bottom of the canal there is up to 400,000 tons of silt which contains heavy metals and oil waste which also reach the rivers connected by the channel ‚Äî the Danube and the Tisa. In 2008 the minister of environmental protection signed the Memorandum of canal cleaning.

It is one of the top twenty Italian ports and top forty European ports. Overview The port of Ravenna is the main port of Emilia-Romagna. The European Commission has appointed the Ravenna seaport \\"Core port\\" of the TEN-T Networks. The docks are mainly on a canal that connects the town centre of Ravenna (which is inland) to the sea which is 12 km away. The offshore breakwaters are in the little towns of Porto Corsini and Marina di Ravenna. It hosts shipyards, multipurpose terminals, bulk cargo terminals and a containerized cargo terminal. There are also a big passenger and cruise lines terminal and the biggest marinas of the Adriatic Sea. There are regular ferry lines to Catania, Brindisi, Igoumenitsa. History It was established thousands of years ago. In fact the Ravenna military and trade seaports are pictured in the opposite walls of S. Apollinare Nuovo, a church built in Ravenna by Theodoric the Great. In 31 BC, Emperor Augustus founded near Ravenna the military harbor of Classe.From classis, Latin \\"fleet\\". It hosted the second imperial fleet of the Roman Empire (according to Vegetius, Epitome of Military Science fourth book - the first one was located in Portus Julius near Capo Miseno near the Port of Naples) Even after the Empire's decline in the 5th century, the port kept active and entered a further golden age during the Byzantine dominion as the mosaics bear witness. It underwent decline after being flooded by the mud of the rivers and conquered by Venice in the 15th century. In 1738, the Corsini Canal (named after Pope Clement XII), connecting Ravenna to the sea, started up its activity. The United States Navy established a naval air station at Porto Corsini on 24 July 1918 to operate seaplanes during World War I. The base closed shortly after the First Armistice at Compi√®gne. After World War II a huge petrochemical plant was established, but the oil crisis of 1973 enhanced its multipurpose trade facilities.

Its purpose is to offer an easy to use interface for creating certification authorities and all related elements including X.509 digital certificates, certificate signing requests (CSRs) and certificate revocation lists (CRLs). Features gnoMint has the following features:gnoMint features * All the infrastructure needed to keep and run a certification authority is saved in only one file. * It's able to create certificate signing requests, allowing to export them to PKCS#8 files, so they can be sent to other CAs. * Allows the creation of X.509 certificates, with a usual set of subject- parameters. * Can export certificates and private keys to PEM files, so they can be used by external applications. It also allows to export PKCS#12 structures, so the certificates can be imported easily by web and mail clients. * The user can establish a set of policies for certificate generation in each one of the existing CAs. * gnoMint can import CSRs made by other applications. * The certificates can be revoked, with generation of the corresponding CRLs * It allows the possibility of keeping the CA private key, or other private keys, in external files or devices (as USB drives) * gnoMint is able to manage of a whole hierarchy of CAs, simultaneously, with their respectives certificates. * Pre-existing Certification Authorities made by other applications, as OpenSSL or TinyCA, can be imported with all their data. * It has a CLI intended for batch certificate creation, or integration with other utilities. Licence and motivation gnoMint is licensed under the GNU General Public License. gnoMint is intended to help all systems and network administrators to deploy a Certification Authority very easily. Its development was started due to the lack of a 'just-works' CA software. According to gnoMint's author, \\"creating a CA from zero, through open-source command-line utilities, was possible, but was uncomfortable to remember all the necessary parameters.

Today, the cadastral commune Inzersdorf has got an area of 854,06 hectare and is so on the biggest part of the district. But in the 19th century, independent Inzersdorf had also got place in the today 10th Viennese district, and bordered on the villages V√∂sendorf, Leopoldsdorf, Ober‚Äë and Unterlaa, and (in the west) on Erlaa.  Geography  The Liesing River in Inzersdorf between Steinsee (\\"Stone Lake\\") and Schlo√üsee (\\"Palace Lake\\") The village is located in a flat marsh, thus a lot of clay was deposited in the area by the Liesing River. That was the basis for 19th-century brickworks, whose mining holes remain until today as lakes. Geologically spoken, most parts of Inzersdorf are built on rubble from Pleistocene. In the southeast and west of the village, quaternary loam exists. The north is counted among the geological era of Holocene.  History  In 1120 and 1125, Inzersdorf's first mention occurred as Imicinesdorf respectively Ymizinisdorf thus meaning \\"village of Imizi(n)\\". It is supposed that the founder of the village was a man named Imizi, Imizo or Imizin.Austria Lexikon: Inzersdorf Until the beginning of the 16th century, the commune involved two villages: Inzersdorf and Willendorf. But after the Siege of Vienna in 1529, when both villages were destroyed, only Inzersdorf was rebuilt. But peace did not least long, and in the Battle of Vienna in 1683, Inzersdorf was destroyed again. This time, Maria Katharina von Kinsky brought foreign settlers to the place. When the brothers Geyer von Osterburg ruled the village in the 16th century, Inzersdorf became the hub of evangelic church. Many Protestants settled down nearby. Years passed by and the lordship of Inzersdorf changed very often. In 1857, Ziegelbaron (\\"Brick Baron\\") Heinrich von Drasche-Wartinberg inherit the holding. The now aborning industrial location specialized on brickproduction and in 1872, the factories already produced 100 million bricks (by comparison: in 1848, they only produced 16 million). Because of that, the Viennese administration decided to integrate the northern part of Inzersdorf, where the factories were located, into the 10th Viennese district Favoriten. After the integration of that northern part which was called now Inzersdorf-Stadt(Inzersdorf-City), the rest of the village was economical degraded. In the next few years, Inzersdorf orientated onto the nearby city Liesing. After the \\"Anschluss\\" (annexation of Austria into Greater Germany by the Nazi regime), Inzersdorf was merged together with Liesing and 13 other villages into \\"Great-Vienna\\". Together, these villages built the new 25th district of Vienna. After the end of the Second World War, Inzersdorf stayed inside of Vienna, while other villages came independent again. In 1954, Inzersdorf became part of the 23rd Viennese district Liesing. This district had had much industrie before Second World War, and because of this, was bombed much by the Allies. But re-building proceeded fast, and in the end of the 20th century, new housing estates were built. In the years of 1988 until 1993, the estates \\"Traviatagasse\\" and \\"Othellogasse\\" were formed. This had big bearings on the number of inheritants of Inzersdorf: While in 1951, the cadastral commune had had about 6.000 inheritants,Ferdinand Opll: Liesing: Geschichte des 23. Wiener Gemeindebezirks and seiner alten Orte. Jugend and Volk, Wien 1982, . S. 198 today there are about 14.500 people living in Inzersdorf.An exact number can not be delivered because the registration districts don't match with the cadastral communes. The registration districts Blumental, Draschegr√ºnde, Inzersdorf, Neu-Erlaa- Neustift and Schwarze Haide altogether had 14.694 inheritants in 2001. ‚Äì Source: Ortsverzeichnis 2001 Wien, published by Statistik Austria, Vienna 2005, p. 101-102  Culture  St. Nicholas' Church Maria Theresien-Schl√∂ssl Originally both a baroque ch√¢teau from the 17th century and a second younger one were situated in Inzersdorf. The castles were damaged by bombings in the Second World War and knocked down in 1965 when the motorway A 23 \\"S√ºdosttangente\\" was built. The former palace garden is used today as a public park. The classicistic St. Nicholas' Church in the town center was built between 1818 and 1820. There had been a gothic building before that was destroyed in a fire on 8 June 1817.Franz R.

History The castle from the 16th century is part of the village. The castle was built in the Renaissance style by Jan Rafael Chroustensk√Ω of Malovary. Chrousten≈°t√≠ lost his property in 1624 when the chateau was handed over to the Collalto family. The chateau underwent a Baroque reconstruction in the 18th century which mainly concerned interiors. Collaltos owned the castle until 1918, when the property was confiscated by the government. After 1948 the chateau was owned by the municipality, and social and cultural events were held there. At the beginning of the 1990s the building underwent restitution but after a short time the castle was sold to the new owner. Since 1997 the chateau and adjacent grounds secured by a wall have been held as a place for sadomasochistic femdom games under the name Other World Kingdom. There is no access to the castle for public. The castle was offered for sale in 2008, but no sale took place.

It is known by the common name coastal bird's-foot trefoil. It grows in many types of mountain, desert, and scrub habitat, not necessarily near the coast. It is an annual herb quite variable in morphology, from petite to bushy, hairless to roughly hairy, and prostrate to erect in form. The slender stems are lined with leaves each made up of pairs of leaflets variable in shape and size. The inflorescence is a small array of 1 to 4 yellow flowers, each up to a centimeter long or so. The elongated flower corolla emerges from a tubular calyx of sepals. The fruit is a legume pod up to 3 centimeters long. Laboratory studies have shown this species, which occurs in wildfire-prone habitat such as chaparral, to have an increased rate of seed germination after exposure to heat.Keeley, J. E. & S. C.

A specialist in Oriental and Romance studies, as well as a Germanist, he was primarily known for his contribution to Yiddish and Romanian philology, his work in evolutionary linguistics, and his activity as a literary and philological comparatist. »òƒÉineanu also had innovative contributions to the investigation and anthologizing of Romanian folklore, placed in relation to Balkan and East Central European traditions, as well as to the historical evolution of Romanian in a larger Balkan context, and was a celebrated early contributor to Romanian lexicography. His main initiatives in these fields are a large corpus of collected fairy tales and the 1896 Dic»õionarul universal al limbii rom√¢ne (\\"The Universal Dictionary of the Romanian Language\\"), which have endured among the most popular Romanian scientific works. A member of the non-emancipated Jewish-Romanian community, LazƒÉr »òƒÉineanu stood for the Haskalah (Jewish Enlightenment) ideas, and opted in favour of Jewish assimilation into the Romanian mainstream. His repeated requests for naturalisation were eventually unsuccessful, but propelled him to the center of a political conflict which opposed the antisemitic current to the advocates of tolerance. In 1901, »òƒÉineanu and his family quit the Kingdom of Romania and resettled in France, where the scholar lived until his death. Becoming known for his pioneering work to the study of Middle French and his investigations into the origins of argot, as well as for his critical essays on 16th-century writer Fran√ßois Rabelais, he was a recipient of the Institut de France's Volney Prize for 1908. The son in law of publisher Ralian Samitca, »òƒÉineanu was survived by his brother Constantin, a noted lexicographer, journalist and polemicist. Biography Early life Eliezer Schein (whose name was originally rendered in Romanian as LazƒÉr »òain Iordan Datcu, \\"LazƒÉr »òƒÉineanu\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 15/2009 Laszlo Alexandru, \\"Un savant cƒÉlcat √Æn picioare (I)\\", in Tribuna, Nr. 151, December 2008 or Shain) A. Zimbler, LazƒÉr »òƒÉineanu , profile at the Bucharest Jewish Community Center; retrieved August 27, 2009 was born in the city of Ploie»ôti to impoverished Jewish-Romanian residents. His father, Moisi, was a house painter and amateur artist, who, by the time his son was sixteen, had left to work in the United States. Eliezer studied with private tutors from the age of 5, and was admitted into regular school at the age of 10, when he entered second grade. Moisi Schein died shortly after returning to Romania, leaving Eliezer the sole provider for his mother and six siblings.Sain√©an (1901), p.9 He was however able to pass his Baccalaureate, with a thesis on writer and theorist Ion Heliade RƒÉdulescu: Ioan Eliad RƒÉdulescu ca grƒÉmƒÉtic »ôi filolog (\\"Ioan Eliad RƒÉdulescu as a Grammarian and Philologist\\"). By 1881, having been exempted from his compulsory term in the Romanian Land Forces as the eldest son of a widow, the young man went on to study at the University of Bucharest's Faculty of Letters.Leopold, p.383; NastasƒÉ, p.105 Taught and regarded with admiration by academic Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu,Sain√©an (1901), passim »òƒÉineanu was primarily a student of etymology, stylistics and semantics (which formed the basis of his first three studies, published in 1882 and 1887). He published his first study, the 1883 C√¢teva specimene de etimologie popularƒÉ rom√¢nƒÉ (\\"A Few Samples of Romanian Folk Etymology\\"), in Hasdeu's magazine Columna lui Traian. By then, »òƒÉineanu had begun contributing to Anuar pentru Israeli»õi (\\"The Yearbook for Israelites\\"), the Hebraist magazine edited by his friends and fellow scholars Moses Gaster and Moses Schwartzfeld, which mainly published articles on Jewish history and espoused a moderate assimilationist agenda (Haskalah).MƒÉriuca Stanciu, \\"A Promoter of the Haskala in Romania‚ÄìMoses Gaster\\" , in the University of Bucharest's Studia Hebraica I , 2003 Gaster also sent »òƒÉineanu's various studies on folklore and linguistics also published in Revista pentru Istorie, Arheologie »ôi Filologie, a review founded and led by Romanian historian Grigore Tocilescu. The direct contacts between the two scholars ended in 1885, when Gaster was expelled from Romania for protesting against the antisemitic measures condoned by the National Liberal Party cabinet of Ion BrƒÉtianu. Laszlo Alexandru, \\"Un savant cƒÉlcat √Æn picioare (II)\\", in Tribuna, Nr. 152, January 2009Sain√©an (1901), p.1-2 The 1887 √éncercare asupra semasiologiei rom√¢ne (\\"Essay on Romanian Semasiology\\"), presented by Schein as his graduation paper,Sain√©an (1901), p.1 was retrospectively commended by ethnologist Iordan Datcu for its innovative value, and argued by the same commentator to have attracted universally positive reactions from \\"objective critics\\". According to »òƒÉineanu's account, it followed closely after semasiology itself had been established as an independent branch by the French academic Michel Br√©al. It reportedly earned him the praise of a future adversary the Education Minister and National Liberal politician Dimitrie Sturdza, who allegedly recommended him to study abroad, reassuring him that, unlike in Gaster's case, \\"we will receive you back with open arms.\\" Printed by the Romanian Academy's press and prefaced by Hasdeu, √éncercare earned »òƒÉineanu the Manoah Hillel scholarship, amounting to 5,000 lei in gold. Using this grant, he furthered his studies in France, at the University of Paris, under Br√©al, Gaston Paris and Wilhelm Meyer-L√ºbke, and later at the √âcole Sp√©ciale des Langues Orientales, where he specialized in the study of Oriental languages. He received his Ph.D. at the University of Leipzig, in the German Empire,NastasƒÉ, p.105, 203; Sain√©an (1901), p.2, 9, 30 his dissertation receiving an award from the Institut de France. According to historian Lucian NastasƒÉ, the scholar's choice was confirming a common practice of Romanians, who opted to bridge the gap between Francophilia and Germanophilia by frequenting venues in both countries.NastasƒÉ, p.105, 203 As »òƒÉineanu wrote to Gaster, he had decided in favor of the \\"intellectual center\\" Leipzig because Karl Brugmann, \\"the leading representative of present-day linguistics\\", worked and taught there.NastasƒÉ, p.203 He studied with both Brugmann and August Leskien, earning much praise for his work and the right to take his diploma under special circumstances (which took into consideration his previous works, and did not require him to research a full-sized new thesis). »òƒÉineanu was pleased with the scientific rigor of his German teachers, but believed the system to suffer greatly in the matter of pedagogy, and considered French academics much more talented in this respect. The young scholar published two works during the interval: Legenda Me»ôterului Manole la grecii moderni (\\"The Me»ôterul Manole Legend among the Modern Greeks\\") and his Ph.D. thesis on Romanian folklore, Les Jours d'emprunt ou les jours de la vieille (\\"The Borrowed Days or The Old Woman's Days\\").Sain√©an (1901), p.2 The latter was hosted by Gaston Paris' journal Romania. Beginnings as a teacher He returned to Romania as a teacher of Latin and Romanian, pursuing a career path which eventually earned him a position at Bucharest University.Sain√©an (1901), p.2sqq He was given employment as a high school teacher, and obtained an unpaid university position as assistant to Hasdeu, head of the Department of Letters.NastasƒÉ, p.105, 203; Sain√©an (1901), p.2-3, 7, 17, 38 NastasƒÉ, who notes »òƒÉineanu's enthusiasm for his work, writes: \\"His opening lecture for the Comparative Philology course‚Äîlike all of his work‚Äîis a proof of erudition more or less unparalleled within the areas of Romania.\\"NastasƒÉ, p.105 Despite his qualifications, »òƒÉineanu was unable to advance professionally because of his non-citizen status.Sain√©an (1901), p.3-4 The young researcher was also appointed substitute teacher of Latin in Bucharest Gheorghe LazƒÉr High School by an administrative decision of the Education Ministry, taken despite the antisemitic protestations of Undersecretary »òtefan MichƒÉilescu.Sain√©an (1901), p.3-5 His assignment to the post followed the intercession of his friend and former teacher, the writer and archeologist Alexandru Odobescu,NastasƒÉ, p.105; Sain√©an (1901), p.3 and inaugurated a short period during which »òƒÉineanu focused on writing textbooks.Sain√©an (1901), p.3 Shortly afterward, Conservative Minister Titu Maiorescu, leader of the influential literary club Junimea and himself one of LazƒÉr »òƒÉineanu's former professors, appointed him to a position at the University, within the History and Literature Department of V. A. Urechia.NastasƒÉ, p.106, 203; Sain√©an (1901), p.4-7 The latter, an outspoken antisemite and prominent member of the opposition National Liberal group, reacted strongly against the measure, launching that claim that, unlike an ethnic Romanian, a Jew \\"could never awaken in the mind and heart of the young generation the image of our past laden with lessons for the future\\". According to »òƒÉineanu's own recollection, he had not himself asked for the university appointment, and suspected that it was offered to him in the first place so that the Gheorghe LazƒÉr position would be assigned to \\"a favorite of the day, the former tutor of Prince Ferdinand.\\"Sain√©an (1901), p.5 He nevertheless noted that Urechia had a conflict of interest when opposing his appointment, given that he had designed the department around his own chairmanship, and that, with the aid of University of Ia»ôi academic Alexandru D. Xenopol, he had set in motion a set of \\"miserable intrigues\\" to maintain his hold on the faculty.Sain√©an (1901), p.6-7 »òƒÉineanu also commented on the alleged oscillations of Tocilescu, who, after agreeing to lead the History section upon its recommended division, and supporting his Jewish colleague for chairmanship of the Letters section, threw his support behind Urechia.Sain√©an (1901), p.7 NastasƒÉ, who mentions the scheming on the part of Urechia and Tocilescu, cites Moses Gaster's letter to »òƒÉineanu, which defined Tocilescu as a double-crosser, \\"a filthy twicer and a bloodsucker\\".NastasƒÉ, p.106 The complications eventually led »òƒÉineanu to present his resignation, and Maiorescu to accept it. He recalled: \\"Every reasonable man would doubtlessly assume that [...] the resentment Mr. Urechia held against this unfortunate nomination would have been appeased. To assume thus would mean not to know the person or the Romanian social environment well enough, for barely two months had passed before grandiose patriotism again displayed the effects of its hatred.\\" The young linguist also contributed to Convorbiri Literare, a magazine edited by Junimea. It was there that, in 1887, he published his study on the Khazars' possible presence in Romanian folklore: Jidovii sau TƒÉtarii sau Uria»ôii (\\"The Jews or the Tatars or the Uria»ôi\\").Adrian Majuru, \\"Khazar Jews. Romanian History and Ethnography\\" (excerpts), in Plural Magazine, Nr. 27/2006Sain√©an (1901), p.18-21 Produced on the basis of folkloric surveys in Muntenian and Oltenian localities such as Dragoslavele, Schitu Gole»ôti and Radomir, the study was later used against him by his political adversaries, who resented the implications it seemed to carry for the traditional relations between Jews and Romanians. Scholarly prominence and early naturalization efforts First page of Elemente turce»ôti √Æn limba rom√¢nƒÉ, 1885 By that moment in his career, »òƒÉineanu was also publishing several books on comparative linguistics. Initially, he focused on assessing the impact of Turkish and Ottoman Turkish on the mainly Romance Aromanian language, producing the 1885 study (\\"Turkish Elements in the Aromanian Language\\").Daniel Gunar, Contact des langues et bilinguisme en Europe orientale: bibliographie analytique, Presses Universit√© Laval, Quebec, 1979, p.356. In 1889, he published his innovative work on the links between German and Yiddish, (\\"A Dialectologic Study on Judeo-German Speech\\").Neil G. Jacobs, Dagmar C. G. Lorenz, \\"If I Were King of the Jews: Germanistik and the Judaistikfrage\\", in Dagmar C. G. Lorenz, Renate S. Posthofen (eds.), Transforming the Center, Eroding the Margins: Essays on Ethnic and Cultural Boundaries in German- speaking Countries, Camden House (Boydell & Brewer), Columbia, 1998, p.192. His recognized field of expertise, NastasƒÉ notes, was by then the widest in Romania, comprising not just Yiddish and Romance linguistics, but also the study Proto-Indo-European, Proto-Slavic and various other languages and dialects.NastasƒÉ, p.105-106 Also in 1889, »òƒÉineanu applied for naturalization, which, according to the 1866 Constitution, a Jew could only receive by special act of the Romanian Parliament and in exchange for exceptional merits.Sain√©an (1901), p.8sqq The effort, which consumed some 12 years of his life, pitted him against the antisemitic current in politics and the scientific community: among the most vocal adversaries of his naturalization were two prominent National Liberals, Urechia and Sturdza, both of whom had a following among nationalist sections of the electorate. As head of the parliamentary commission on legal integration, Sturdza signed a recommendation to reject the proposed law, which had been previously approved by Justice Minister George D. Vernescu, on grounds that »òƒÉineanu lacked qualifications.Sain√©an (1901), p.9-15 Their campaign, which depicted »òƒÉineanu as an adversary of Romania, culminated when Senate voted 79 to 2 against the naturalization request.Sain√©an (1901), p.15-16 The resistance to his application was a surprise for »òƒÉineanu, who wrote: \\"I was not aware that this path [...] is the more thorny as the [person's] merits are more real.\\"Sain√©an (1901), p.4 He also accused the political establishment of endemic corruption, writing: \\"any banker who demanded naturalization received it without the least of difficulties\\".Sain√©an (1901), p.24-25 During the following interval, »òƒÉineanu's cause reportedly won the support of King Carol I, Conservative Premier LascƒÉr CatargiuSain√©an (1901), p.16-18 and moderate National Liberal politico Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu.Sain√©an (1901), p.16 Reviewing the situation, »òƒÉineanu cited an unusual incident in neighboring Austria‚ÄìHungary, where local Romanians were demanding increased group rights as part of the Memorandum movement. Their arguments about cultural repression were met with the reply of Hungarian intellectuals, who cited the »òƒÉineanu issue as proof that Austria‚ÄìHungary had more to offer than Romania: \\"He had all of Romania on his case, but he had rendered [the country] as many services as most Romanian demigods.\\" In 1893, the naturalization request came before the lower chamber, resulting in a vote of 76 in favor to 20 against. According to the scholar's recollections, his only adversary in this forum was his former Convorbiri Literare colleague, writer Iacob Negruzzi, who reportedly stated the unsupported claim that »òƒÉineanu had campaigned against Romania \\"in English\\" (»òƒÉineanu believed that this was \\"doubtlessly\\" stated \\"because [English] was completely unfamiliar to the majority of Chamber members\\").Sain√©an (1901), p.18 Parallel controversies and 1895 Senate vote Despite his involvement in a political scandal, LazƒÉr »òƒÉineanu did not interrupt his work in linguistics. His 1891 book, (\\"The Relations between Grammar and Logic\\"), written on the basis of his university lectures, comprised his thoughts on the origin of language and was among volumes pioneering the study of logical aspects within natural language.Sorin Stati, \\"Discourse Correspondence between Argumentative and Grammatical Sequences\\", in Frans H. van Eemeren, J. Anthony Blair, Charles Arthur Willard, A. Francisca Snoeck Henkemans (eds.), Anyone Who Has a View: Theoretical Contributions to the Study of Argumentation, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, 2003, p.189. Datcu notes this contribution, alongside the 1892 Istoria filologiei rom√¢ne (\\"History of Romanian Philology\\"), for the \\"up to date information\\" provided. The latter was explained by the author as \\"destined to encourage the new generation to work, and come to its aid through useful advice.\\"Sain√©an (1901), p.17 The two volumes were accompanied by a printed expansion of his earliest thesis on Heliade RƒÉdulescu. In 1895, »òƒÉineanu completed work on one of his major contributions to folkloristics in general and the study of Romania folklore in particular: Basmele rom√¢ne √Æn compara»õiune cu legendele antice clasice »ôi √Æn legƒÉturƒÉ cu basmele popoarelor √Ænvecinate »ôi ale tuturor popoarelor romanice (\\"Romanian Fairy Tales as Compared to the Legends of Classical Antiquity and Those of All Romance Peoples\\"). An exhaustive monograph, it comprised some 1,000 pages of main text and 100 pages of index. The volume was presented anonymously to the Romanian Academy (in accordance with its regulations), and received its Heliade RƒÉdulescu Award. Consternation ensued once the author revealed his name, prompting Sturdza and Negruzzi to ask, unsuccessfully, for the Academy's decision to be overturned.Sain√©an (1901), p.27-28 On the occasion, Urechia (himself an Academy member) publicly stated that his adversary had purchased the award, but, »òƒÉineanu noted, never presented proof for this assertion.Sain√©an (1901), p.28 That same year, the matter of his citizenship was returned to the Senate. By then, »òƒÉineanu's file had been further enriched with the award certificate, a guarantee of good conduct from Bucharest City Hall, and several favorable reports from Hasdeu (an exception to the latter's own antisemitic discourse). Hasdeu also arranged him interviews with Romanian Orthodox Metropolitan Ghenadie (who was also president of the commission on naturalization), while Alexandru Odobescu brought the case to the attention of Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino, the Conservative President of the Senate.Sain√©an (1901), p.28-29 There followed a major Senate debate, during which Urechia stood out for his repeated criticism of his former competitor, likening him to a Trojan Horse and demanding from fellow parliamentarians not to let \\"a foreigner\\" slide into \\"the Romanian citadel\\" (statements to which many responded with applause). Listing his various claims alongside his and Hasdeu's replies, the Jewish scholar himself recounted that Urechia eventually came to state, at the Senate tribune, that \\"Mr. »òƒÉineanu did not publish anything against the country, but neither did he write in favor of the national question\\".Sain√©an (1901), p.36 The early vote gave 33 to 26 against »òƒÉineanu's naturalization, short of the supermajority required, but a second take resulted in 61 against to 12 in favor.Sain√©an (1901), p.30-32 The antisemitic segment of the board celebrated this victory with loud cheers, as witnessed by Odobescu, who recorded feeling himself confronted with the image of \\"cannibals who rejoiced like beasts over having slashed and devoured a civilized man\\".CƒÉlinescu, p.353 Another voice from academia to speak unfavorably of the opposition met by »òƒÉineanu was Alexandru Philippide, who wrote: \\"I am not philosemitic, but if there ever was a kike deserving of naturalization, that would be »òƒÉineanu.\\" Shortly after this incident, the new National Liberal Minister Spiru Haret reshuffled the teaching posts, and »òƒÉineanu, who was holding a new teacher's position at Bucharest's »òcoala NormalƒÉ SuperioarƒÉ, found himself unemployed, and opted to seek employment outside Romania, in Paris and Berlin.Sain√©an (1901), p.38-39 Late 1890s works and ramifications of the scandal Without ceasing to publish works for the Junimea periodical Convorbiri Literare, »òƒÉineanu continued to frequent its adversary Hasdeu, and contributed some of his other essays to Hasdeu's magazine Revista NouƒÉ.Tudor Vianu, Scriitori rom√¢ni, Vol. II, Editura Minerva, Bucharest, 1970, p.240-241. Basmele rom√¢ne was followed in 1896 by Studii folclorice (\\"Studies in Folklore\\"), a collection of short writings on comparative mythology. That same year, he completed his fundamental work in lexicography, Dic»õionarul universal al limbii rom√¢ne, which codified the Romanian lexis from archaisms and dialectical varieties to neologisms and modern jargon, comprising around 30,000 entries and 80,000 definitions. The first extensive project of its kind in the history of the local philological school, it was to prove his most popular contribution from its first edition, circumstances themselves described by writer Ion Luca Caragiale as a phenomenon in Romanian culture. Caragiale, who deemed LazƒÉr »òƒÉineanu \\"a genuine talent in popularization\\", opined on the book's originality: \\"[»òƒÉineanu] sought to embrace the entire manifestations in the life of a modern people [...]. Therefore, this universal dictionary provides a reduced, but precise image of our present-day culture, as it is reflected in the language.\\" In contrast to this positive appraisal, nationalists such as Urechia's son Alceu publicly mocked the book and claimed that it lacked merit. In parallel, the volume consecrated »òƒÉineanu's collaboration with the Craiova- based printing house of Jewish entrepreneur Iosif Samitca (Institutul Samitca), where the scholar also published Mitologia clasicƒÉ (\\"Classical Mythology\\"), the 1895 Romanian literature anthology Autori rom√¢ni moderni. BucƒÉ»õi alese √Æn versuri »ôi prozƒÉ din principalii scriitori ai sec. al XIX-lea (\\"Modern Romanian Authors. Verse and Prose Samples Collected from the Main Writers of the 19th Century\\"), and an 1897 biographical essay on English author William Shakespeare. The business connection turned into family relations, after »òƒÉineanu married the daughter of Ralian Samitca, Iosif's son, associate and eventual successor. They had a daughter, Elisabeth.Dedication page, in Sain√©an (1901) »òƒÉineanu followed up with a comprehensive study regarding Levantine presences in the vocabulary and society alike, published by Editura Socec in 1900 (as , \\"The Oriental Influence on Romanian Language and Culture\\") and being made into a French-language edition in 1901.Leopold, p.89, 383 It received attention from the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles- Lettres, and consequently a nomination for the Institut de France's Volney Prize. However, in what has been seen as proof of the author's isolation in Romania, it was ignored by the Romanian Academy, which presented its prize for that year to a volume on the history of horses. The book was also a cause for conflict between »òƒÉineanu and Nicolae Iorga, an established historian and nationalist politician. The heated debate, carried out in Constantin RƒÉdulescu-Motru's periodical Noua RevistƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ, was sparked by Iorga's review, which claimed to provide some necessary amends. »òƒÉineanu found the objections outlined by Iorga frivolous, and the overall text, in which his opponent had cited himself some 15 times, egocentric. This reaction was met with a virulent reply by Iorga, whose renewed accusations borrowed from antisemitic discourse: \\"[»òƒÉineanu wrote] about many things that he does not comprehend. He was crafting with his clumsy hands manuals, grammars, anthologies, dictionaries for speculative profit. I however had an explanation for such defects. We all know that Mr. »òƒÉineanu is not a Romanian, and we know that which he is. His people has many traits that are very elevated and noble, but also many defects that are low and ungainly. These, I had been telling myself, are in his blood; he could never get rid of them. I wish to talk about the passion for high praise and multiple earnings, without much investment\\". In 1907, Iorga and his Neamul Rom√¢nesc journal also retorted against Caragiale's praise for »òƒÉineanu, calling Caragiale one who \\"deals with the Jews\\", and prompting Caragiale to satirize Iorga's own scholarly ambitions.George Voicu, \\"The 'Judaisation' of the Enemy in the Romanian Political Culture at the Beginning of the 20th Century\\" , in the Babe»ô-Bolyai University's Studia Judaica , 2007, p.148-149 1899 parliamentary vote and self-exile In order to facilitate the naturalization procedures, LazƒÉr »òƒÉineanu eventually renounced Judaism and accepted baptism in the Romanian Orthodox Church.Leopold, p.383-384 His godfather was Take Ionescu, at the time a rising figure within the Conservative Party ranks. Ionescu himself served as Minister of Education, appreciating the scholar's insight and enjoying his company before taking his distance from him for reasons unknown.Sain√©an (1901), p.39-40, 43-47 »òƒÉineanu's case was again presented for Senate approval in December 1899, this time with a favorable review from the special parliamentary commission, and the motion for his naturalization was carried with 37 to 2 votes (or, according to »òƒÉineanu, a 39-vote unanimity).Sain√©an (1901), p.40 Although the result was positive, the scientist was informed that a new procedure had just been passed with support from across the floor, specifying that naturalization could only be enforced by vote in a common session of the two chambers.Sain√©an (1901), p.41-43, 47-48 The dossier was therefore submitted to another vote, on the last session of 1899, which again enlisted attacks from the antisemitic groups, before being canceled due to lack of quorum.Sain√©an (1901), p.47-49 Reflecting on the early result, which had left him \\"submerged into complete happiness\\", and on the new vote, which he believed was a mere technicality introduced on purpose by Justice Minister Constantin Dissescu, he recalled: \\"for 24 hours I was politically [»òƒÉineanu's italics] within the Romanian nationhood!\\"Sain√©an (1901), p.41 He recalled having been received by King Carol, who reportedly agreed with his belief that the action was abusive.Sain√©an (1901), p.43, 46 By then, »òƒÉineanu also lost the support of Hasdeu, who, like Take Ionescu, gave his approval to a restructuring of the University, which stripped the Jewish scholar of his honorary position.Sain√©an (1901), p.44-45 He sought instead backing from Petre P. Carp, the Conservative doyen, who reportedly answered his request with the ambiguous Latin adage Gutta cavat lapidem (\\"The water drop will drill through stone\\").Sain√©an (1901), p.46-47 On the other side of the divide, the attacks on »òƒÉineanu had come to be led by the antisemitic paper ApƒÉrarea Na»õionalƒÉ, whose articles, the scholar argued, \\"reached the summit of stupidity and ridiculousness\\".Sain√©an (1901), p.47 On December 14, 1900, the issue of LazƒÉr »òƒÉineanu's naturalization was also revisited by the lower chamber, and the proposal defeated with 44 votes to 31 (from an insufficient quorum of 75), followed by a definitive vote on December 15, at which 48 out of 95 deputies voted against. This outcome was celebrated by ApƒÉrarea Na»õionalƒÉ, which published editorial comments such as \\"All Romanian hearts have jumped up with immense glee\\" and \\"Our ancestors have shuddered with joy in their graves\\".Sain√©an (1901), p.56 Among those who expressed condemnation of the decision were La Roumanie journal and aristocrat Alexandru Bibescu.Sain√©an (1901), p.55-56 In 1901, frustrated by the political reaction and feeling uncomfortable in Romania, the scholar and his family resettled in Paris, where he primarily used a Francization of his Romanian name, signing as Lazare Sain√©an.Leopold, p.384 French career and final years Title page of L'Argot ancien in its 1907 edition His main interest for the following period were the theories of evolutionary linguistics, with focus on the Neogrammarian approach, ethnolinguistics and psycholinguistics. He also added to his interests the groundbreaking investigation of French argot, and published a short memoir (Une carri√®re philologique en Roumanie, \\"A Philologist's Career in Romania\\"). »òƒÉineanu's studies also focused on a comparative research of building rituals as found in Balkan literature, and notably the Romanian Me»ôterul Manole myth (the book saw print in French, as the 1902 Les rites de la construction d'apr√®s la po√©sie populaire de l'Europe Orientale).John Neubauer, Marcel Cornis-Pope, \\"Introduction: Folklore and National Awakening\\", in Marcel Cornis-Pope, John Neubauer (eds.), History of the Literary Cultures of East-Central Europe, Vol. 3, John Benjamins, Amsterdam & Philadelphia, 2004, p.273. By then, he was in correspondence with fellow linguist Alfred Landau, with whom he discussed the history of Yiddish.Frankes, p.223 »òƒÉineanu's parallel investigations into the history of French included his 1905-1907 La Cr√©ation m√©taphorique en fran√ßais et en roman: images tir√©es du monde des animaux domestiques (\\"The Metaphoric Creation in French and Romance Languages: Images from the World of Domestic Animals\\"), which was structured into several tomes, respectively dedicated to the principal household companions. He also began work on major syntheses on French vocabulary, L'Argot ancien (\\"Ancient Argot\\") and its companion Les Sources de l'argot ancien (\\"The Sources of Ancient Argot\\", 1907). The former earned him the Volney Prize for 1908. Writing in 1999, historian Joan Leopold argued that this was a significant achievement, since the Volney Commission \\"seemed to fear direct competition by foreigners\\"‚Äîother exceptions to this rule being Liu Bannong, Wilhelm Schmidt and Marie-Louise Sjoestedt.Leopold, p.123 According to Leopold, »òƒÉineanu was among the Volney prizewinners, \\"particularly foreigners\\", who \\"were never elected to an affiliation with the French Acad√©mies.\\"Leopold, p.138 However, she also notes that \\"there were no titles honored [during 1900-1909] which are now remembered as significant in the history of linguistics\\".Leopold, p.97 She places the fact that »òƒÉineanu \\"did not achieve major university positions in France\\" in connection with a tendency of awarding the prize to scholars who mainly did field work (Schmidt, Adolphe de Calassanti-Motylinski, George Abraham Grierson, Leo Reinisch and others). Literary critic Laszlo Alexandru passed a similar judgment: \\"LazƒÉr »òƒÉineanu's disappearance from the Romanian cultural space was received with an almost unanimous silence; but the emergence of Lazare Sain√©an in Parisian scientific research would not itself result, for the rest of his days, in the much coveted and entirely deserved university chair.\\" Between 1912 and 1922, »òƒÉineanu worked with the Soci√©t√© des √âtudes rabelaisiennes on publishing the annotated edition of Rabelais' complete works. His career was not interrupted by World War I, and, in 1915, he published a report on the special language of French soldiers entrenched on the Western Front (L'Argot des tranch√©s, \\"Trench Argot\\"). His 1920 volume on the evolution of argot in Parisian French (, \\"Parisian Language in the 19th Century\\"), was again nominated for a Volney Prize.Leopold, p.96, 99 In 1922, »òƒÉineanu published Manuel de phon√©tique latin (\\"Manual of Latin Phonetics\\"), the last of his contributions to be shortlisted for a Volney.Leopold, p.99 By then, he had also become interested in researching the work of French Renaissance author Fran√ßois Rabelais, primarily focusing on his use of Middle French‚Äîan account published between 1920 and 1923 as La Langue de Rabelais (\\"Rabelais' Language\\").Bakhtin, p.185 Between 1925 and 1930, he published the volumes of a large-scale project, Les Sources indig√®nes de l'√©tymologie fran√ßaise (\\"The Indigenous Sources of French Etymology\\"), which was reputedly the result of three decades in specialized research. In 1930, »òƒÉineanu followed up with another book on Rabelais, mainly dedicated to his critical reception and cultural legacy (L'Influence et la r√©putation de Rabelais, \\"Rabelais' Influence and Reputation\\").Bakhtin, p.60, 61 He died four years later at a hospital in Paris, after complications from surgery. Work Background and tenets »òƒÉineanu's letter to fellow folklorist Simion Florea Marian (November 1886) The diverse cultural background on which LazƒÉr »òƒÉineanu relied and his early familiarity with several traditions are occasionally credited as sources for his scholarly achievements. Joan Leopold noted that the Romanian-born scholar was among the fourteen or fifteen Jews of various nationalities whose work was taken into consideration by the Volney Committee during the 19th century, pointing to the legacy of \\"Talmudic and [Jewish] philological traditions\\" within modern science.Leopold, p.122 His Jewish identity, literary historian George CƒÉlinescu noted in 1933, went in tandem with an exceptional familiarity with Romanian language and culture; like other of his fellow Jewish Romanian intellectuals (among whom CƒÉlinescu cited philologists Gaster and Barbu LƒÉzƒÉreanu, Marxist theorist Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea and dramatist Ronetti Roman), »òƒÉineanu possessed \\"an amazingly rich Romanian lexis\\". During his time in Romania, the scientist was involved in cultural debates surrounding the Romanian ethos. As a disciple of Moses Gaster and contributor to Anuar pentru Israeli»õi, »òƒÉineanu implicitly stood for a Haskalah ideology, supporting Jewish integration into the cultural mainstream, and favored the scientific approach to Jewish history akin to the Wissenschaft des Judentums methods. Laszlo Alexandru refers to his \\"fundamental program\\" as being \\"the assimilationist thesis\\", and explains that, for this reason, the scholar changed Schein to »òƒÉineanu. The same commentator notes that »òƒÉineanu disregarded Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu's publicized antisemitism when he became a \\"fervent disciple\\" of Hasdeu in scholarly matters. In reference to his own patriotic sentiment, »òƒÉineanu once defined the country as \\"twice sacred to my eyes‚Äîthe land where I was born and where my parents sleep their eternal slumber.\\" After his departure to France, he further stated that he bore \\"not even the shadow of a grudge\\" on the Romanian people as a whole. According to literary historian Eugen Lovinescu, the scholar's subsequent correspondence stands as \\"proof of sincere adherence, prolonged over decades and perils, to his country of origin\\". However, according to one account, when »òƒÉineanu happened to meet Nicolae Iorga in Paris some decades after their polemic, he made a point of addressing him in French, which was interpreted as a statement of disgust with the Romanian cultural environment. »òƒÉineanu also made himself known for the points of view which he expressed in relation to the debates over the Latin alphabet and orthography, within the context of linguistic evolution. Overall, »òƒÉineanu argued that early Romanian history as taught in his lifetime was better covered by philologists, since, before the time of Michael the Brave, it had \\"more of an ethnographic and philological character\\". He reacted against the politicization of research and accusations that his own works did not support popular views of \\"the national question\\".Sain√©an (1901), p.35-37 At a time when the Cyrillic version had been discarded but the new spelling was still largely unregulated, he joined the outspoken critics of attempts to modify the shape of words so as to suggest their Latin origins.Alexandru Niculescu, \\"Histoire de la r√©flexion sur les langues romanes: le roumain / Geschichte der Reflexion √ºber die romanischen Sprachen: Rum√§nisch\\", in Gerhard Ernst, Martin-Dietrich Gle√ügen, Christian Schmitt, Wolfgang Schweickard (eds.), Histoire linguistique de la Romania / Romanische Sprachgeschichte, Vol. 1, Walter de Gruyter, Berlin, 2003, p.192. The \\"Latinist\\" approach, experimented in the lexicographic work of I. C. Massim and August Treboniu Laurian and originating with the Transylvanian School, was favored for a while by the Romanian Academy, but had become widely ridiculed by the 1880s. According to the scholar's own words, \\"Latinomaniac tendencies\\" were nevertheless present with National Liberals such as Sturdza, and formed a background theme in the party's conflict with Moses Gaster.Sain√©an (1901), p.2, 24 While approaching the Junimea society's tenets on this matter, »òƒÉineanu also shared Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu's criticism of Junimist Germanophilia. In 1897, the two scholars published Eine Trilogie (German for \\"A Trilogy\\"), criticizing a perceived Conservative and Junimist monopoly on the Romanian literary scene in general, and, in particular, the officially condoned historical overview by Wilhelm Rudow, Gheorghe Bogdan- DuicƒÉ and Iacob Negruzzi, which seemed to omit mention of any politically inconvenient literary contribution. Work in Romanian folklore Much of LazƒÉr »òƒÉineanu earliest contributions connected his linguistic research with his interest in Romanian folklore. Aiming to be \\"a genuine corpus of Romanian oral literature\\", Basmele rom√¢ne aimed at introducing the major themes in local spoken tradition, listing and transcribing some 500 stories. LazƒÉr »òƒÉineanu took additional care in preserving the integrity of the oral level of Romanian literature in printed versions, and urged other folklorists interviewing storytellers to keep notes on the latter's special talents.D√©gh, p.46 Such preoccupations in preserving context were also found in his lexicographic work; according to Caragiale, Dic»õionarul universal was groundbreaking because its author took care \\"to support with authentic testimonies the words and the nuances of meanings.\\" A special section of »òƒÉineanu's research in the same area was dedicated to comparative mythology. His contributions have led folklorist Linda D√©gh to deem him \\"one of the pioneers in classifying folktales according to their types\\". This method was employed in Basmele rom√¢ne, whose content was structured into both types and \\"cycles\\". In Basmele rom√¢ne, arguing in favor of applying the principles introduced by Hasdeu, »òƒÉineanu analyzed Romanian folktales in their native and national content.Ene, p.XXV Nevertheless, he followed the conclusions of other folklorists on the universality of folklore, suggesting that the world's entire folkloric literature was structured into some tens of groups.Ene, p.XXIV With Studii folclorice, the researcher tested an anthropological investigation into the characteristics and supposed origins of each myth, in particular Me»ôterul Manole, Baba Dochia and the iele creatures. In Les rites de la construction, »òƒÉineanu focused on a set of ballads with a similar construction- and immurement-related subject, present throughout East Central or Eastern Europe, likening the Romanian Me»ôterul Manole legend to its counterparts in Serbian (Zidanje Skadra), Hungarian (K≈ëm≈±ves Kelemen) and other regional folkloric traditions. According to critics John Neubauer and Marcel Cornis-Pope, he was \\"the first author to attempt a synthetic treatment of the immurement motif in Eastern Europe\\". The two also note that »òƒÉineanu, who believed that the motif reached its potential significance only in Eastern Europe, stayed clear of the controversy surrounding the geographic and ethnic sources of the ballad (while specifying his belief that the Hungarian version followed a Romanian source), and discussed Zidanje Skadra and Me»ôterul Manole as the most crafted variants of the myth. One portion of »òƒÉineanu's studies in Romanian folklore bordered on his investigation of Jewish history. The scholar noticed recurring characteristic among antagonists in Romanian fairy tales, particularly the uria»ôi‚Äîoccasionally known as jidovi, \\"Jews\\", or tƒÉtari, \\"Tatars\\". He attributed such traits to a possible conflictual encounter, taking place at some point in the early medieval period, between Romanians (or Vlachs) and the Khazars, a Turkic tribe that had adopted Judaism. His interpretation, as paraphrased by the scholar himself, concluded: \\"Was there in the past a people about which one could claim with certainty that it was both Tatar and Jewish at the same time? My answer to this question is that such a people existed, and it is known in history under the name of Khazars [...]. After spreading its domination over Eastern Europe, these Jewish-Tatars suddenly disappeared from the stage of history. What became of them? A part of these Khazars will have looked early on for a shelter in Transylvania, from where they crossed to the Danubian countries, especially in Muntenia, particularly in Muscel and Romana»õi districts where the traditional memories regarding them seem to be concentrated. [...] The settlements and their dwellings left important traces that took on colossal proportions in people's imagination. People of a supernatural size seemed to have lived [...] in an ancient time, which the old can hardly remember, and our peasants call those giant people Jews or Tatars.\\"Sain√©an (1901), p.18-19 The scholar referred to various constants in folkloric accounts: peasants' testimonies which attributed large stone ruins to the Jews (whom they occasionally referred to as giants or supernaturally powerful people) and the \\"red\\" antagonists in fairy tales such as Ion CreangƒÉ's Harap Alb (the \\"Red Emperor\\", the \\"Red Man\\" and people with red-colored facial markings, all placed by »òƒÉineanu in connection to the \\"Red Jews\\" myth). »òƒÉineanu's political adversaries, including V. A. Urechia, saw in this theory evidence of a Jewish historiographical attempt at overriding the Romanian presence in the areaSain√©an (1901), p.8, 18-20‚Äîan interpretation since defined as \\"in bad faith\\" and \\"slanderous\\" by Laszlo Alexandru. Yiddish and Romanian linguistics Turkish-Romanian bragagiu, in an 1880s rendition The scholar earned much recognition for his parallel work in Yiddish linguistics. According to American researcher Jerold C. Frakes, he is one of the \\"major scholars of the late nineteenth century\\" to have studied the Yiddish language, his contribution ranking him alongside Maks Erik, Solomon Birnbaum, Chone Shmeruk, Max and Uriel Weinreich.Frakes, p.xiii-xiv According to Hebraist Robert D. King, such contributions rank »òƒÉineanu, Alfred Landau and Matisyohu Mieses \\"among the first scholars to take Yiddish seriously, to force others [King's italics] to take it seriously, to move conceptually beyond the stupid position that Yiddish was 'bad German' or 'jargon', a second-rate excuse of a language.\\"Robert D. King, \\"The Czernowitz Conference in Retrospect\\", in Dov- Ber Kerler (ed.), Politics of Yiddish: Studies in Language, Literature, and Society, Altamira Press, Walnut Creek etc., 1998, p.42. His inquiry into medieval structures connecting Yiddish and German is seen by Germanists Dagmar C. G. Lorenz and Neil G. Jacobs as a substantial discovery, »òƒÉineanu being the first to indicate \\"that the German component of Yiddish traces back to Middle High German sources\\" (meaning that \\"Yiddish was no longer to be evaluated in terms of New High German\\"). The scholar was also reportedly the discoverer of a direct link between Yiddish and Aramaic; this allowed the conclusion that the Jewish German dialect originated among Aramaic-speaking and pre-Ashkenazi Jews, who originally settled further east than the Askhenazi home in the Rhineland.Dovid Katz, \\"Hebrew, Aramaic and the Rise of Yiddish\\", in Joshua Fishman (ed.), Readings in the Sociology of Jewish Languages, Brill Publishers, Leiden, 1985, p.99-100. In his studies of Turkish and Turkic borrowings into the Romanian lexis, LazƒÉr »òƒÉineanu looked back on historical events leading back to the Age of Migrations, such as in highlighting the possible Pecheneg origin of relatively common Romanian words such as buzdugan (\\"mace\\"), duium (\\"multitude\\"), du»ôman (\\"enemy\\"), caia (\\"horseshoe nail\\"), colibƒÉ (\\"hut\\") and fotƒÉ (\\"skirt\\").

Series Historica, Vol. I, 2004, p.71 However, one of his primary focuses was on Ottoman Turkish as a mediator between Romanian and other languages: the Romanian word giuvaier (\\"jewel\\"), borrowed from the Turkish cevahir, but originating with a Persian source; trampƒÉ (\\"barter\\"), taken from the Turkish trampa, but sourced to the Italian tramutare (\\"to transform\\"); talaz (\\"high wave\\"), identical to the Turkish intermediary, and through it borrowed from the Greek ŒòŒ¨ŒªŒ±œÉœÉŒ± (thalassa, \\"sea\\").Suciu, p.1674 Additionally, the scholar documented the distant impression of Levantine territories, as first introduced through Ottoman culture‚Äîas illustrated by the original references to Egypt as Misir, from the Arabic ŸÖÿµÿ± (Mi·π£r), as opposed to the more modern . Radu Ardelean, \\"Banatul, Ardealul »ôi restul lumii sau geografie »ôi etnografie la Mihail Halici-tatƒÉl\\", in the Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu's Studia Universitatis Cibiniensis. Series Historica, Vol. II, 2005, p.177, 180 He also discussed the professional suffixes -giu and -angiu, both of Turkish origin and present in words borrowed during the early modern and Phanariote eras. Rodica Zafiu, \\"Clipangiu\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 42/2004 Main examples include barcagiu (\\"boater\\" or \\"ferryman\\"), bragagiu (\\"boza maker\\"), geamgiu (\\"window fitter\\"), toptangiu (\\"wholesale vendor\\") etc., but the suffix is also applied ironically in various other contexts‚Äîfor example, mahalagiu (\\"inhabitant of the mahala\\", \\"suburbanite\\" or \\"uncouth person\\") and duelgiu (\\"dueler\\"). »òƒÉineanu's texts followed the evolutions of similar words ending in -liu (such as hazliu, \\"funny\\", from haz, \\"laughter\\"), of popular figures of speech directly translated from their Turkish original (a bea tutun, \\"to drink tobacco\\", or the question √Æn ce ape te scalzi?, \\"what waters do you bathe in?\\", figurative for \\"how are you feeling?\\"), and of strong obscenities reflecting Oriental sources. In general, »òƒÉineanu concluded, such appropriation from an area mediated by Islam and Islamic culture was not present in areas directed related to Christian practice and intellectual life.Suciu, p.1673 Especially in his , »òƒÉineanu evidenced the spread of Turkish borrowings throughout the Balkans, and concluded that they had a more significant presence in Aromanian than in Romanian.Suciu, p.1675 His contemporary, philologist Vasile Bogrea, referred to the volume as a \\"Bible of Oriental elements in Romanian\\", while the author himself deemed it a \\"supreme testimony of my love for the Romanian language and people\\".Sain√©an (1901), p.49 According to writer and critic Alexandru Mu»ôina, »òƒÉineanu was foremost among the linguists who challenged a linear take on the origin of the Romanians, evidencing, like Alexandru Philippide and Alexandru Cihac, the \\"heterogeneous, plurilingual and multicultural character of our Romanity\\", with the underlying \\"processes of acculturation\\". In particular, Mu»ôina notes, it was »òƒÉineanu's study of Turkish words and expressions settled in the everyday language that uncovered \\"a forma mentis, common Oriental, Turco-Romanian mentality.\\" Studies of French language and civilization cri de Paris, as depicted in a hand- colored engraving (ca. 1500) With La Cr√©ation m√©taphorique, the researcher inventoried the representations of animals in the late medieval imaginary: lions and cocks as representations of courage, hunting dogs as icons of arrogance, pigs as symbols of gluttony etc.Esther Cohen, \\"Animals in Medieval Perceptions: The Image of the Ubiquitous Other\\", in Aubrey Manning, James Serpell (eds.), Animals and Human Society: Changing Perspectives, Routledge, London, 1994, p.63. The books notably showed the traditional semantic parallelisms between cats, monkeys and apes, as codified in several Romance languages, and investigated the animals' respective roles within popular demonology and metaphors of drunkenness.Michel Masson, \\"Cats and Bugs: Some Remarks about Semantic Parallelisms\\", in Martine Vanhove (ed.), From Polysemy to Semantic Change: Towards a Typology of Lexical Semantic Associations, John Benjamins, Amsterdam & Philadelphia, 2008, p.372-376, 382. With Les Sources indig√®nes de l'√©tymologie fran√ßaise, »òƒÉineanu offered clues on the obscure origin of various French words. »òƒÉineanu thus sourced the French and English harlequin beyond the Italian-language arlechino in Commedia dell'arte, and back to a medieval legend in Middle French.Pierre Louis Duchartre, The Italian Comedy: The Improvisation, Scenarios, Lives, Attributes, Portraits, and Masks of the Illustrious Characters of the Commedia dell'arte, Dover Publications, New York City, 1966, p.138-139. A number of »òƒÉineanu's texts focused on the language patterns covered by \\"argot\\" and the original meaning of \\"jargon\\", in relation to French and Parisian social history, discussing the language of the gueux (marginalized and destitute migrants), the obscene nature of some medieval performances, the linguistic codes used by brigands during the Hundred Years' War, and the impact of argot in the work of poet Fran√ßois Villon or other French Renaissance writers.R. Anthony Lodge, A Sociolinguistic History of Parisian French, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2004, p.111, 238, 240-243. discussed in part the emergence of what »òƒÉineanu himself defined as (\\"the lowly Parisian language\\"), a mix of argots emerging from 19th century urbanization.H. G. Lay, \\"R√©flecs d'un gniaff: On Emile Pouget and Le P√®re Peinard\\", in Dean De la Motte, Jeannene M. Przyblyski (eds.), Making the News: Modernity & the Mass Press in Nineteenth-century France, University of Massachusetts Press, Amherst, 1999, p.129. His studies in the area were part of a phenomenon in French linguistics: at roughly the same time as »òƒÉineanu, argot studies were becoming the main subject of works by researchers such as Arnold van Gennep and Raoul De La Grasserie.Calvet, p.56 A disagreement occurred between »òƒÉineanu and Gennep over the origins and age of argot: Gennep criticized his colleague's claim that \\"no European argot has sources beyond the 15th century\\", arguing that such statements were not verifiable, and that they presumed \\"some kind of spontaneous generation\\".Calvet, p.60 Also according to Gennep, »òƒÉineanu was among those Eurocentric scholars who offered a \\"teratological\\" view of argot as an \\"aberrant creation\\". As part of his efforts to advance the study of Middle French, »òƒÉineanu dedicated himself to an applied study of Fran√ßois Rabelais and his role in French literature. Called \\"remarkable and abundantly documented\\" by Russian semiotician Mikhail Bakhtin, La Langue de Rabelais outlines the use, context and origin of some 3,770 individual words in Rabelaisian vocabulary.Urban T. Holmes Jr., Alexander H. Schutz, A History of the French Language, Biblio and Tannen, New York City, n.d., p.75. It was especially noted for its details on various contributions to Rabelais' means of expression, including staples of French folklore such as the so-called Cris de Paris (chants traditionally produced by Parisian street vendors). Some of his other contributions to the study of Rabelais' work, as described by Bakhtin, include the inventory of culinary metaphors found throughout Gargantua and Pantagruel, and evidence that Rabelais had an unmitigated familiarity with the maritime trade.Bakhtin, p.185, 193, 455 La Langue de Rabelais also offered clues into 16th-century views of homosexuality, discussing the origin of archaisms such as bardachiser (\\"to sodomize\\") or the link between Rabelais' maritime terminology and medieval reactions to homoeroticism.Randy Conner, \\"Les Molles et Les Chausses. Mapping the Isle of Hermaphrodites in Premodern France\\", in Anna Livia, Kira Hall (eds.), Queerly Phrased: Language, Gender, and Sexuality, Oxford University Press, Oxford etc., 1997, p.134, 137-140. In his work on the subject, »òƒÉineanu also stood out as one of those rejecting the notion that Rabelais' writings have a special anticlerical meaning, arguing instead that his mockery of clerical society was merely a rendition of common and folkloric attitudes‚Äîa conclusion quoted in agreement by Annales School historian Lucien Febvre in his own The Problem of Unbelief in the Sixteenth Century.Febvre, p.8-9 Also cited by Febvre are »òƒÉineanu's views on Islamic and \\"Saracen\\" echos in Gargantua and Pantagruel (such as the depiction of Fierabras), as well as on Rabelais' references to miraculous cures as being borrowed from earlier romance fiction.Febvre, p.4-5 In a parallel series of articles, the Romanian scholar also discussed the link between Ancient Roman thinker Pliny the Elder and the Renaissance writer, commenting on the similarity between Rabelais' description of medical practices and statements found in Natural History.Arthur Fred Chappell, The Enigma of Rabelais: An Essay in Interpretation, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1924, p.114. Legacy Despite the antisemitic campaigns and the voluntary expatriation, »òƒÉineanu's reputation with the Romanian public was largely unharmed, and his works went through new Romanian-language editions: Dic»õionarul universal alone was reissued a total of nine times before 2009, and was allegedly a primary target for plagiarism from the moment of its publication. In tandem, »òƒÉineanu's request that his peers publish details on the individual storytellers providing the folkloric accounts was respected by some, including Alexandru Vasiliu, collector of Pove»ôti »ôi legende (\\"Stories and Legends\\", 1928).D√©gh, p.46, 369 Two years after »òƒÉineanu's death, his brother Constantin collected and edited his correspondence, publishing it in Bucharest. Much interest in »òƒÉineanu's work was sparked during the interwar period, shortly before and after the scholar's death, when new generations of critics came to reclaim his work as an important contribution to the field of science. Outside of Romania and France, »òƒÉineanu's contribution of Rabelais left an observable trace in Finnegans Wake, a 1939 modernist novel by Irish novelist James Joyce: while Joyce's text holds transparent allusions to Rabelais' writings, the writer himself claimed to have never read the originals, and to have instead relied solely on a scientific study (in turn identified by research Claude Jacquet as La Langue de Rabelais).Sam Slote, \\"Apr√®s mot, le d√©luge 1: Critical Response to Joyce in France\\", in Geert Lernout, Wim Van Mierlo (eds.), The Reception of James Joyce in Europe, Continuum International Publishing Group, London, p.375-376. Interwar Romanian intellectuals, primarily George CƒÉlinescu and Eugen Lovinescu, played a part in reevaluating and bringing to attention »òƒÉineanu's contribution within its Romanian and international context. »òƒÉineanu's correspondence was itself a topic of controversy between the two rival critics: after Lovinescu showed himself impressed by a letter in which »òƒÉineanu stated E. Lovinescu m'impose (\\"E. Lovinescu impresses me\\"), CƒÉlinescu noted that his competitor had a tendency to quote \\"all things flattering him, no matter how cheap.\\" During the same decade, the maverick writer Panait Istrati, himself a voluntary exile to France, explained that Dic»õionarul universal was \\"the holy book\\" of his Romanian adolescence. However, Lucian NastasƒÉ notes, the antisemitic background beyond »òƒÉineanu's rejection (as well as the similar affair involving Solomon Schechter) continued to make itself felt throughout those years, with other Jewish scholars (Leon Feraru or Alexandru Graur) being actively prevented from seeking employment in their field.NastasƒÉ, p.449-450 Braving the violently antisemitic and authoritarian regime of ConducƒÉtor Ion Antonescu, in place during most of World War II, CƒÉlinescu commented favorably on the contributions of Jewish figures to Romanian cultural life in his main synthesis, the 1941 History of Romanian Literature.Lucian Boia, Istorie »ôi mit √Æn con»ôtiin»õa rom√¢neascƒÉ, Humanitas, Bucharest, 1997, p.259. It included a reference to Jewish linguists »òƒÉineanu, Gaster, Ion Aurel Candrea, as scholars whose merits would be \\"regrettable to deny\\".CƒÉlinescu, p.976 In contrast, the Romanian far right and fascist groups continued to regard »òƒÉineanu's marginalization as justified. The 1930s witnessed a controversy which, according to Laszlo Alexandru, recalled the confrontation between Hasdeu and LazƒÉr »òƒÉineanu: Hasdeu's place was held by academic Nae Ionescu, who moved toward fascism and antisemitism, while »òƒÉineanu's position was assumed by Ionescu's Jewish disciple, writer Mihail Sebastian. Writing for Azi during the Sebastian scandal of 1934, journalist N. Ro»ôu, an affiliate of the fascist Iron Guard, claimed that \\"Romanian culture will go on living\\" irrespective of Jewish absences such as »òƒÉineanu and Gaster, that one's creativity depended on one's \\"Romanianness\\", and that philology studies reflected one's \\"sensitivity\\".Ornea, p.410 In 1936, a Guardist named Vasile G√¢rcineanu called Dic»õionarul universal \\"a characteristically Jewish work, superficially and poorly crafted\\".Ornea, p.411 While cultivating an ambiguous relationship with fascism, which eventually brought him into the ranks of the Iron Guard, philosopher Mircea Eliade, one of Ionescu's other known disciples, publicly deplored »òƒÉineanu's social relegation and Gaster's expulsion.Ornea, p.135, 410-411 The communist period witnessed a long hiatus in respect to the critical assessment of »òƒÉineanu's work: in 1962, linguist Dumitru Macrea referred to his predecessor as an \\"all but forgotten\\" figure, and none of »òƒÉineanu's volumes were printed between the 1947 edition of his dictionary and the 1978 version of Basmele rom√¢ne. This reticence was however contrasted by the appreciation of various academics: Iorgu Iordan commented on his \\"extraordinary erudition\\", recommended his disciples to study his work, and referred to his repudiation by the Romanian state as \\"a real stain on our public life of the late [19th] century\\". During that time, Iordan and his colleagues Perpessicius and Alexandru Rosetti published renewed commentary on »òƒÉineanu's work, being later joined by philosopher Constantin Noica, folklorist Ovidiu B√¢rlea and various other intellectuals. A new edition of Dic»õionarul universal saw print after the 1989 Revolution and the end of communism. According to writer and researcher Rodica Marian, this reissue \\"without interventions\\" constitutes proof of a return to the \\"past parameters\\" of lexicography, at the end of a deterioration of standards. \\"Ancheta: »òtiin»õa dic»õionarului la rom√¢ni\\" , in Tribuna, Nr. 104, January 2007, p.15 It was followed by several other initiatives, which notably resulted in reprints of Studii folclorice and √éncercare asupra semasiologiei rom√¢ne. Writing in 2003, Alexandru Mu»ôina referred to »òƒÉineanu as a \\"great\\", \\"mistreated\\" and \\"unrecognized\\" linguist, defining as \\"his valuable work, as yet unchallenged and still relevant\\". In 2008, the case surrounding »òƒÉineanu's naturalization bid was the subject of a biographical study, written by historian George Voicu and published by the Elie Wiesel National Institute for Studying the Holocaust in Romania. »òƒÉineanu's works have also been the subject of reprints in France, and have continued to be recommended secondary sources by academic institutions in the United States more than a century after they were first published. His posthumously published writings include a 1991 edition of Une carri√®re philologique en Roumanie.

Known as The Scottish League, the organisation advances the programme of the nineteenth- century American social reformer Henry George. The League publishes books and other material, and is a participant in the ongoing public debate over the future of Scotland‚Äôs land and tax system. The Scottish League was constituted in 1890, emerging out of the complex reorganisation that year of the Scottish Land Restoration League. It campaigned vigorously during the public and parliamentary debate surrounding the Land Values (Scotland) Bill at the turn of the twentieth century. That Bill was initiated at the League‚Äôs request, and intended to be prototype UK legislation. Viscount Ridley, speaking in the House of Lords in 1908 (before the reforming 1911 Parliament Act), at the second reading of the ill-starred Bill, claimed that: > Behind this Bill is the Scottish League for the Taxation of Land Values, and > the real support that the Bill gets is from gentlemen who think it would be > to the advantage of this country to tax all land values out of existence.... > I ask your Lordships to reject the Bill because I believe it to be unfair, > incomplete, and impracticable, and that no amount of amendment or > modification could affect the principle of the Bill.... It is begotten by > fanatical societies out of an ignorant Government; it stands...unsound and > vicious. The Bill was \\"passed by the House of Commons by a great majority in 1907, but was rejected by the Lords\\".Edwards 1909, p. 85 The Scottish League was also firmly engaged in the legislative process surrounding the 1931 Finance Bill, which it came to repudiate. Sir John Simon, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and future Chancellor of the Exchequer, addressed the Commons: > Let us consider whether after three weeks of existence this Bill is in a > very happy condition‚Ä¶. We must not suppose that the cursing comes only from > the critics, who might be thought to be naturally opposed to this system of > taxation. I hold in my hand a communication from the Scottish League for the > Taxation of Land Values. I read it with interest, because we know that if > one could look anywhere for the pure milk of the word on this subject it > would be to the Scottish League for the Taxation of Land Values. This is > what it says: \\"The present proposals of the Chancellor of the Exchequer will > penalise the landowners who are putting their land to the best possible use > just as much as it punishes the owners who are holding land idle, or making > a partial use of it. This in itself condemns the present proposals, and > marks the scheme as a political stunt ‚Äú. The Scottish League has been actively involved in Glasgow City Council‚Äôs 2009 initiative to reform local taxation on the basis of land values. The Scottish League was one-time proprietor (1904‚Äì1907) of the modern periodical Land&Liberty;, published then under the title Land Values.

He is best known for his time in Florida Championship Wrestling, WWE's developmental territory. He is a former FCW Florida Tag Team Champion with Joe Hennig as The Fortunate Sons. DiBiase is a third generation professional wrestler. His grandmother Helen Hild and adoptive grandfather \\"Iron\\" Mike DiBiase were professional wrestlers, as was his father, \\"The Million Dollar Man\\" Ted DiBiase. DiBiase's older brothers, Mike and Ted Jr., are also professional wrestlers.  Professional wrestling career   World Wrestling Entertainment / WWE (2008‚Äì2011)  DiBiase made his debut for World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE)'s developmental territory, Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW), in mid-2008. On August 19, DiBiase defeated Sheamus O'Shaunessy, but was defeated by Stu Sanders the following week. Throughout the end of the year, he continued wrestling in FCW, competing against wrestlers including Gavin Spears, Dolph Ziggler, and Sinn Bowdee. 250px In early 2009, DiBiase competed sporadically for FCW, although he teamed regularly with fellow multi-generation wrestler, Maverick Darsow, in February. He also competed in both tag team and singles matches, and defeated Byron Saxton in late March. DiBiase made his FCW television debut on the May 17, 2009 episode, defeating Dylan Klein. A few weeks later, DiBiase competed in a battle royal to become the number one contender for the FCW Florida Heavyweight Championship, but was eliminated. On the June 7 episode of FCW, DiBiase lost to Klein, starting a scripted rivalry between the two. They competed against each other on numerous occasions throughout June, July and August. At WWE's SummerSlam pay-per-view in August 2009, DiBiase made an appearance as a planted fan in the audience, interfering in the WWE Championship match between Randy Orton and John Cena.

He was the son of Norman MacLeod of MacLeod (1812‚Äì1898), 25th chief of Clan MacLeod and his wife Louisa Barbara St. John (1818‚Äì1880), only daughter of the 14th Baron St John of Bletso. He was educated at Harrow and Cambridge. On 17 April 1877, MacLeod of MacLeod married Lady Agnes Mary Cecilia Northcote ( ‚Äì 26 October 1921), the daughter of Sir Stafford Northcote, later 1st Earl of Iddesleigh, and Cecilia Frances Farrer. They had two daughters. In the 1885 General Election he stood unsuccessfully for the Conservatives in Inverness-shire losing the seat to an Independent Liberal. In 1889 he became the Queen's and Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer, an office of the Court of the Exchequer which was originally concerned with the recovery of dues, penalties and debts owed to the Crown. In February 1900 he was appointed the fourth Registrar General, and in this role he presided over the 1901 census. Two years later, he was in August 1902 appointed Permanent Under Secretary for Scotland. He was knighted in 1905. After a further unsuccessful attempt to be elected to Parliament in 1911 he retired from public life and became a director of Shell, the first of several directorships he held. Sir Reginald became 27th chief of Clan MacLeod in 1929 on the death of his elder brother Norman Magnus and died six years later in 1935. His daughter Olive was noted for her journey of 3,700 miles into the heart of Africa to visit her fianc√©'s grave. The MacLeod waterfalls on the Moa Kabi river are named after her. The famous Fairy Flag of the MacLeod's was mounted by Sir Reginald. An expert from the Victoria and Albert Museum discussed with Sir Reginald the possible origins of the flag, avoiding reference to the supernatural. The chief listened and said, \\"You may believe that, but I know that it was given to my ancestor by the fairies.\\" Sir Reginald was the laird of the islands of St Kilda in 1930, when the last inhabitants left the islands. In 1931 he sold the islands to Lord Dumfries, later Marquess of Bute.

Overview The outmoded headquarters of what was then Argentina's second- largest newspaper, La Prensa, led its influential proprietor in 1894, Jos√© Clemente Paz, to purchase a 1300 m¬≤ (14,000 ft¬≤) lot on the newly opened Avenida de Mayo, and he commissioned local architects Carlos Agote and Alberto Gainza to design a new headquarters at the site. Agote and Gainza, both graduates of the √âcole Centrale des Arts et Manufactures, drew from their training in Paris to create a Beaux-Arts design, beginning with a fa√ßade inspired by French architect Charles Garnier. Completed in 1898, the new La Prensa offices was inaugurated in a ceremony attended by around 20,000. The Beaux-Arts exterior is notable also for its spire, which is topped by a gilt bronze monument to freedom of the press represented by Pallas Athena and created by French sculptor Maurice Bouval (of Thibaut Fr√®res). Bouval's Athena stands 50 m (164 ft) above the ground and holds an electric lamp representing Prometheus' sacred fire.Casa de la Cultura: Historia y arquitectura The spire also contains a siren, installed in 1900 to symbolically herald news La Prensa considered singular milestones. The siren has been rung five times over the decades: on news of the assassination of Umberto I, the King of Italy, in 1900; on the landing of the Apollo 11 spacecraft on the moon; on the Argentine National Football Team's first FIFA World Cup, in 1978; on the invasion of the Falkland Islands by the last dictatorship, in 1982; and on the return of democracy with the inaugural of President Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n, in 1983. View of the House of Culture and City Hall from the Avenida de Mayo The building's interior was completed with mostly imported materials, including Spargne elevators from the United States, as well as French fixtures such as Boulanger mosaic tiles, clocks by Paul Garnier and wrought-iron work from Val d'Osne. The first floor is centered on the Golden Salon, where Paz opened the Popular Conference Institute, celebrated during the twentieth century for its weekly literary readings and lectures (notably those of Jorge Luis Borges). The salon was decorated with frescoes by Reynaldo Giudici and Nazareno Orlandi, both Italian-born painters. Paz also opened an extensive library in the building, which grew to over 80,000 volumes and at one time maintained several local branches, as well as one in Paris. The conservative La Prensa was expropriated by the administration of Juan Per√≥n in 1951, by which the building became property of the CGT labor union. The bronze Minerva was removed by the CGT in 1952, allegedly on fears that it could collapse (that this was a removal of a monument representing freedom of the press has not been lost on historians). The statue was reinstalled in 1956, and while press freedom restrictions otherwise worsened following Per√≥n's overthrow, La Prensa was restored to the Paz family. The newsdaily's decline in readership helped lead to the company sale of the landmark building in 1988, however, and it became the Ministry of Culture of Buenos Aires. Known since then as the Casa de la Cultura (House of Culture), the building was declared a National Historic Monument in 1995. A passageway built to connect it to the adjacent Buenos Aires City Hall was converted into the Ana D√≠az Salon, where art exhibits are hosted.

It was formed by the merger of the separate communes of Troubky () and Zdislavice (Zdislawitz) in 1960. Geography Bell tower in Troubky Troubky-Zdislavice is situated in a rural region of historic Moravia, northeast of the Litenƒçice Hills (Litenƒçick√° pahorkatina) and the Ch≈ôiby nature park, part of the Central Moravian Carpathians. It lies approximately south-west of the district capital Kromƒõ≈ô√≠≈æ, west of Zl√≠n, and south-east of Prague. A through road leads to Morkovice-Sl√≠≈æany in the northwest and to Zdounky in the east. History Troubky in the Margraviate of Moravia was first mentioned in a 1281 deed. For centuries, the estates were held by the local Lords of Zdounky Castle and the Bishops of Olomouc, from about 1549 by the House of Z√°st≈ôizl. The nearby fortress of Zdislavice was documented in 1349. The castle was rebuilt as a Baroque palace in the late 17th century. Later a possession of the Czech baronial Dubsk√Ω of T≈ôebomyslice family, it was the birthplace of the famous Austrian writer Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach on 13 September 1830. She spent her childhood and youth here, before she left Zdislavice in 1848 to live with her husband at Louka near Znojmo. After her death in 1916, she was buried in the Dubsk√Ω family tomb in the castle park. After World War II, the furnishings of Zdislavice Castle were auctioned and its library was destroyed.

Retrieved : 22 February 2015. and NorGer was cancelled. Description NorGer interconnector will start in Tonstad in Norway. From Tonstad overhead powerline runs to the Flekkefjord area. From Flekkefjord a long high voltage direct current submarine cable will run through the North Sea to Mooriem in Lower Saxony, Germany. It will be laid on the Norwegian, German and Danish Continental Shelf. The precise cable route is decided from a thorough mapping of the sea-bed along the prospective cable route. The sea route is consulted by Offshore Marine Management. NorGer will have a transmission capacity of 1,400 MW and an operating voltage of 450‚Äì500 kV. The price per kWh could rise by 0.8 √∏re in Norway.Hovland, Kjetil Malkenes. \\"S√∏ker om Tysklandskabel\\" Teknisk Ukeblad, 9 November 2009. Accessed: 12 January 2015. The sea cable is planned as a bipolar system with earthing through the return cable. This way, the disadvantages of a ground- return electrode with earthing in the sea, such as production of chlorine compounds and metal corrosion, are avoided. Anticipated life span of the cable would be about 40 years. Since the power supply in both Germany and Norway is based on alternating current, converter stations must be built in both countries. Project company The project is developed by NorGer KS, a company that is owned by the Norwegian transmission system operator Statnett, energy utilities Agder Energi and Lyse Produksjon, and the Swiss company Elektrizit√§ts-Gesellschaft Laufenburg. NorGer is registered in Norway. Statnett owns 50% of the projects while all other partners own stake of 16.67% each. Environment NorGer will use the best available technology to limit the cable‚Äôs impact on the environment. Previous investigations show that underwater HVDC cables have no known impact on sea life.Andrulewics, E.D., D. Napierska, Z. Otremba, 2003: The environmental effects of the installation and functioning of the submarine SwePol link HVDC transmission line: a case study of the Polish Marine Area of the Baltic Sea. J. Sea Res. 49:337‚Äì345. Climate gain In periods of overproduction, German wind power can be transported to Norway while water in Norwegian reservoirs can be stored for later use. Without access to hydroelectric power it is difficult to use the increase in wind power in the German power supply system. The cable connection will also be important for Norway‚Äôs plans to use more wind power. Power supply from wind power can vary from hour to hour according to wind strength and access to reserve power is needed to even out the variations. Hydroelectric power, with its unique regulatory capacity is a cheap and reliable balancing power source for wind power.

History  Name of the village is derived from the landscape of Birch trees, which was previously typical of this region. The first mention of the village dates back to 1492.The settlement of this area began with the establishment of the Cistercians monastery Smilheim, which was built in the 1261.The village was also visited by Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek, who is a famous composer of the Czech republic. He visited B≈ôezov√° for several times to be inspired here by a variety of regional folk songs.  Monuments and attractions   The Kyselka  On 1576 a doctor of Tom√°≈° Jord√°n of Klausenburk mentioned B≈ôezova‚Äôs spring in his medical book about healing water. The spring is considered to be healing and is generally known under the name of Kyselka.  The Lookout tower Lopen√≠k  On 16 July 2005 the new lookout tower Lopen√≠k was built. It was constructed as a symbol of friendship between the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The tower is 20 meters high, it is built of oak timber on stone foundations. It offers a beautiful view of the Moravian and Slovakian surroundings.  The church of Saints Cyril and Methodius  Initially, there was a small chapel in B≈ôezov√°. Afterwards, a little church was established there instead of the chapel. Finally, thanks to the initiative of the priest Franti≈°ek ƒåerno≈°ka, the contemporary church was constructed. The foundation stone of the new church was laid on 19 July 1865. Work on the church was very difficult due to unfavorable conditions, such as hail, frost, a fire that destroyed nineteen houses. The church was dedicated to Saints Cyril and Methodius. It became the biggest dominant of the village and valuable architectural evidence of the 19th century. Since 1987, it has been considered as a cultural monument.  References   Literature  LAPƒå√çK, Vladim√≠r. Uherskohradi≈°≈•sko. In Vlastivƒõda moravsk√° sv. 63.

The species epithet palustris is Latin for \\"of the marsh\\" and indicates its common habitat.Archibald William Smith Description The stem is up to half a meter (20 in) long and spreads to form mats on the mud, rooting at nodes in contact with the substrate, or floats ascending in the water. The leaves are oppositely arranged and green to red or purple in color. Solitary flowers appear in leaf axils. They are made up of tiny green sepals and no petals. They yield small capsular fruits containing many minute seeds. Distribution Its native distribution is unclear, but includes parts of the Americas; it can be found on most continents and spreads easily to become naturalized. It is also cultivated as an aquarium plant. It was identified in England in 1827.

It raised the silver-to-gold weight ratio from its 1792 level of 15:1 (established by the Coinage Act of 1792) to 16:1 thus setting the mint price for silver at a level below its international market price. The Act redefined the U.S. Eagle coin (ten U.S. Dollars) as containing 232 grains of fine gold, compared to 247.5 grains in the prior Act. This fixed the official basis of the dollar as $20.69 per troy ounce.480 grains per troy ounce; $10 * (480 grains/troy oz) / 232 grains = $20.69/troy oz This standard prevailed until 1933, when the official price rose to $35 as a consequence of the Great Depression. The silver content of the silver dollar was left unchanged at 371.25 grains.http://cowles.econ.yale.edu/P/cm/m04/  Historical context  On June 28, 1834 the Coinage Act of 1834 was signed by Andrew Jackson. It defined the coin weights and allowed the Treasury Department to pay 5 days after deposit at the mint the full amount of the gold. This sped up the process of getting minted coins for gold. The coinage legislation of 1834 was passed during a contentious political battle between President Andrew Jackson and a contingent of elected officials and bureaucrats led by Nicholas Biddle and Senators John C. Calhoun, Henry Clay and Daniel Webster over the fate of the United States Bank. Biddle, the Bank‚Äôs president, believed that it served to facilitate the exchange of goods and payments by providing a national currency; however, Jackson feared that an institution as large as the U.S. national bank would be manipulated by powerful financiers to exploit the nation‚Äôs volatile financial system. Furthermore, he argued that the Constitution did not give Congress the power to charter a corporation which could operate outside the District of Columbia . Therefore, in the summer of 1832, he vetoed a bill that sought to renew the corporate charter for the Bank placing the heated debate over the fate of the national bank squarely in the political spotlight during his re-election campaign. After handily winning re- election, Jackson appointed his Attorney General, Roger B. Taney, as Secretary of the Treasury in 1833. Taney sympathized with Jackson‚Äôs hostility towards the national bank and mandated that all federal deposits be withdrawn from BUS as quickly as possible severely curtailing the amount of loans the Bank could issue thereby precipitating a national credit shortage. When Congress convened in December 1833 (known as the ‚ÄúPanic Session‚Äù), the credit shortage had managed to intensify the already bitter dispute over the fate of the Bank. While the president‚Äôs opponents controlled the Senate, his supporters in the House of Representatives managed to push his agenda in the form of coinage legislation that sought to undermine the circulation of U.S. Banknotes in favor of gold currency. The proposed bill was intended to devalue the overvalued silver (revalue the undervalued gold) from which the bank notes derived their monetary worth. After months of drafting and revision, The Coinage Act of 1834 was passed in the House by a vote of 145 to 36 and the Senate passed its version of the bill soon after.  Economic and historical significance  In the first half of the nineteenth century, U.S. money was circulated in both metallic and paper currency. As established by the Coinage Act of 1792, silver coins were authorized in denominations of $0.05, $0.10, $0.25, $0.50 and $1.00. After the Coinage Act of 1834, silver (which was previously overvalued with respect to gold) became significantly undervalued and was exported to European markets where it was traded at a higher price. This led to its near disappearance from par-circulation after 1834. Despite the attempts by Jackson, Taney and members of Congress to supplant paper currency in favor of ‚Äúhard-money,‚Äù there were over a thousand banks issuing their own notes in small denominations (between $0.01 and $2.50).

It has about 3,500 inhabitants. It is located directly on the border with Slovakia. Administrative parts Village of Kvƒõtn√° is administrative part of Str√°n√≠. Etymology The Czech word str√°n√≠ translates into English as \\"slopes\\", and the moniker is indicative of the fact that the municipality (418 meters above sea level) is nestled in a valley of the White Carpathian Mountains. History Str√°n√≠ is located in an ancient mining area and an apparent settlement area of the Stone Age Corded Ware Culture (2900‚Äì2350 B.C.). In the 11th and 12th centuries the area Str√°n√≠ was on the so-called Hungarian Way. This road was used by Bohemian troops as they marched to attack the Turks and Tatars in Hungary. After the mid-13th century it became an important commercial link between Hungary and Czech lands. The first written mention of Str√°n√≠ is from 1318. By 1359, Str√°n√≠ was referred as a market town for the first time. In 1483, tolls were collected in Str√°n√≠ for the upkeep of the commercial road, and by 1492 Str√°n√≠ included 44 houses and 2 mills. In 1502, John Bernard of Kunovice conquered the area, including Str√°n√≠, and his family maintained dominion over Str√°n√≠ until the Battle of White Mountain in 1618, when the Bernards lands were confiscated by the Emperor because the family supported the failed rebellion against him. In 1625, the Bernardi land holdings were sold to the Lichtenstein family, which maintained ownership of Str√°n√≠ until 1945. Until 1943, there was a thriving Jewish community in Str√°n√≠, but in that year the Nazis deported all known Jewish Str√°naci to the Theresienstadt concentration camp. Even so, several buildings in Str√°n√≠ are still architecturally ornamented with the Star of David. One such example can be found on the rear fa√ßade of Skl√≠pek, a local bar. Infrastructure The municipality of Str√°n√≠ is home to two post offices, one in the Str√°n√≠ village and one in the village of Kvƒõtn√°. There are two kindergartens and a primary school in the municipality. Economy Kvƒõtn√° Glass Works Central to the stability and future growth of Str√°n√≠ are the two largest employers in the municipality, the Kvƒõtn√° Glass Works and the manufacturing company Santra. In 1794, the Lichtensteins, thanks to beech forests, high-quality glass sand and the close proximity of an important trade route to Hungary, chose Str√°n√≠ as the location of a glass works. Glass production began in the summer of 1795 and has been continuous since that time. In 1897 Kvƒõtn√° was only the second glass factory in Europe to introduce etched glass production. Today, Kvƒõtn√° produces only sodium potassium glass using traditional blowing and hand-shaping methods and ladle furnaces. It employs about 180 people. Santra, headquartered adjacent to Z√°meƒçek, manufactures a wide variety of park furnishings and storage solutions and employs about 50 locals. Sights Church of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross The Catholic Church of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross is in the centre of Str√°n√≠. The parish church was first commissioned by Prince Wenceslas von Lichtenstein in 1748 and was built with material taken from the ruins of a fortress. But the original church was too small and the church belfry damaged by lightning, so the Lichtenstein church was ultimately demolished and replaced with a new, larger church, constructed in the Neo-Gothic style and consecrated in 1911. Nearby the church is ≈†trb√°kovec, a 19th-century house that is home to a small cultural museum, which is a national historic landmark. Also near the church is Z√°meƒçek, a two-story ch√¢teau with vaulted ceilings throughout that was constructed in the late-16th century, expanded upon in the mid-17th century, renovated in the mid-19th century and renovated again in 2011. The Lichtensteins owned Z√°meƒçek from the 17th century until 1948 when the building was nationalized.
