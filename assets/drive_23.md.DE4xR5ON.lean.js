He was the first to create interdisciplinary masters and doctoral programs in engineering management, with curricula built explicitly on concepts drawn from systems theory and cybernetics. He served as President for both the American Society for Cybernetics (1986‚Äì88) and the American Society for Engineering Management (1998‚Äì99) and was elected an Academician in the International Academy for Systems and Cybernetic Sciences in 2010.  Biography  Richards was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan and grew up in Orono, Maine. He received his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from the University of Maine (1968). While serving as a pilot in the U.S. Marine Corps, he earned master's degrees in aeronautical systems from the University of West Florida (1970) and business administration from Mississippi State University (1974). He received his Ph.D. in operations research from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania (1980). Notable accomplishments included: Founding Chair of the Department of Engineering Management at Old Dominion University (1984‚Äì97); founding Executive Director of the Center for Commercial Space Infrastructure (1992‚Äì95), which subsequently morphed into the Virginia Space Flight Center and commercial spaceport on Wallops Island; Founding Dean of the School of Management and Aviation Science (1997-2004) at Bridgewater State University; inaugural Executive Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs (2004‚Äì15) and Interim Chancellor (2012‚Äì13) at Indiana University East; and, Interim Vice Chancellor & Dean for the Indiana University ‚Äì Purdue University Columbus campus (2015‚Äì16). He retired from Indiana University in 2016 as Professor Emeritus of Management and Informatics.  Work  Richards' contributions can be sorted into three areas: (1) his development of constraint theory as an approach to the formulation of policy and technology strategy; (2) his advancement of the concepts associated with cybernetics as representing a new and powerful way of thinking; and (3) his application of cybernetic ideas to the design of a participative-dialogic society. = Constraint theory = In his book, Constraint Theory, Richards proposed that, in addressing problems and issues in complex systems involving many participants, desires be treated as constraints rather than as goals or objectives (as they are in traditional operations research problem formulation). In research for NASA, he applied constraint theory to the development of an approach for formulating policy on the selection of new space transportation systems, given the extreme uncertainty in the technologies that will be available by the time a new system becomes operational. = Cybernetics = Richards recognized a unique potential in the cybernetic version of systems thinking for addressing complex behavioral and social phenomena. He focused on the ideas of hierarchy, purpose and belief to highlight differences between the process-oriented thinking of cybernetics and, for example, whole systems thinking, teleological or purposeful systems thinking, and ideological systems thinking. He proposed that: (1) cybernetics be treated as a way of thinking about ways of thinking (of which it ‚Äì cybernetics ‚Äì is one), making the way of thinking a choice; and, (2) the cybernetician be treated as a craftsperson in and with time, merging art, science and design.[4] = Designing (a) society = Since its inception in 1992, Richards was a guest at the School for Designing a Society in Urbana, Illinois. A premise of the school was that social change can be realized in a transformation from the current to a new society (a change of system), not only in improvements to the current society (changes in a system). Richards saw in the cybernetic concept of conversation a particular dialogic with special relevance to processes of design and participation; from this, he created an idea for a participative-dialogic society, a society without violence or at least one where violence is the alternative of last resort. This idea, he argued, would require a change of thinking.  Awards and honors  In 2002, Richards was elected a Fellow of the American Society for Engineering Management (#33) and was awarded the Norbert Wiener Medal of the American Society for Cybernetics in 2007.  Publications  Richards published over 100 books, monographs, journal/magazine articles, and conference papers.

It was founded by Frank (Francis) Karslake in 1898, and disbanded in 1904. It helped sell bindings produced by women binders already practicing, and instituted training programs to teach other women. An edition of The Pilgrim's Progress produced by the Guild of Women Binders, held at the British Library. Likely bound by Gwladys Edwards. Frank Karslake was a London bookseller, and a founder and financial backer of the Hampstead Bindery. At the 1897 Victorian Era Exhibition at Earl's Court, he encountered several bindings by women, including Annie S. Macdonald, on display, and his interest was piqued. Soon after, he invited several women binders to exhibit their work in his London shop; this \\"Exhibition of Artistic Bookbinding by Women,\\" which ran from November 1897 to February 1898, garnered a substantial amount of interest from the public, and convinced him that promoting women's bookbindings could be a profitable venture, if perhaps partially for the novelty. Whatever his motivations, Karslake soon began acting as an agent to women binders already practicing, such as Annie MacDonald and Edith and Florence de Rheims. By May 1898, the Guild of Women Binders was open as a business venture, headquartered at Karslake's bookstore at 61 Charing Cross Road. Karslake \\"saw that more money could be made by teaching to bind than by only binding and selling books. He maintained that women were well-suited to be bookbinders, due to their \\"inborn reverence for the beautiful\\" and their deftness of hand. He focused on both promoting the work of women already engaged in bookbinding, and training additional women to create bindings. Every member of the Guild received training in hand-bookbinding, and were offered employment after they completed this training. An edition of \\"Poems descriptive of rural life and scenery\\" by John Clare, produced by the Guild of Women Binders, held at the British Library. Members and associates of the Guild of Women Binders carved out a niche for themselves at the end of the 19th century by producing fine, artistic bindings by hand in an era when bookbinding was becoming increasingly mechanized. As part of its training efforts, the Guild set up a workshop, headed by Karslake's daughter Constance, near the Hampstead Bindery in 1899. The Guild accepted for training only women with an art school background, likely limiting them to a small pool of middle-class women; by 1903, they had an estimated 25-30 students. In keeping with the artistic styles of the time, many of the bindings featured Art Nouveau patterns, with sweeping lines and elegantly curved shapes. Karslake's advertising claimed that each binding was decorated with a unique pattern, though several patterns seem to have been variations of others. The Guild promoted and sold not only its own bindings, but also those of other groups such as the Chiswick Art Guild. Consequently, the presence of a stamp of the Guild of Women Binders on a book may not necessarily mean that it was created by the Guild unless the individual binder can be identified, and may mean \\"little more than a bookseller's stamp.\\" Ultimately, the Guild was not a successful business venture, possibly due to Karslake's inexperience in the professional bookbinding world (despite his associations with several binding operations, he had never worked as a binder himself). Karslake had tried to grow the Guild too far and too fast, taking on more students than teachers, and expecting too much out of his teaching staff. Some professional bookbinders suspected that the bindings were too sophisticated to have been produced by women, especially recently trained ones; a few even accused Karslake of passing off the work of the Hampstead Bindery as Guild work. Potential buyers began to mistrust Karslake and the guild's products (with some justification, as Karslake and his workshops had little knowledge of sound bookbinding techniques such as those practiced by other Arts and Crafts binders of the time), and many bindings went unsold. The Guild was shuttered in 1904, leaving Karslake bankrupt and many of the women who had worked with him tainted by the controversy (though some did go on to continue independent careers as bookbinders).

The monastery was built above a natural spring from where it gets its name Sourp Aghperig (Holy Spring).

The youth wing of the Justice and Development Party (AK Gen√ßlik) is presumed responsible for heading the web brigade. In 2020 Twitter Safety suspended and archived 7,340 accounts pushing Justice and Development Party (AKP) which consists of fake and compromised accounts that are tied to the group which pushed pro-AKP narratives that aim to increase domestic support for Turkish invention in Syria as well as narratives critical of opposition parties CHP and HDP. Background AK Trolls came to existence in 2013 after the Gezi Park protests where protesters used social media to organize and publicize protests against the government and the authoritarian tendencies of Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan. As a reaction, the AKP recruited 6,000 people to a new social media team, known as the New Turkey Digital Office, to promote state propaganda and orchestrate campaigns against individuals identified as being opponents of AKP. Internet bots are extensively used by government as well to assist paid individuals. AK Trolls mainly target anyone who opposes the policies of incumbent President Erdoƒüan, which can range from Kurdish leftists to Kemalists. AK Trolls favored a 'Yes' vote for the constitutional changes sought by Erdoƒüan. 2020 Twitter Take-down Twitter Safety statement: \\"Based on our analysis of the network‚Äôs technical indicators and account behaviors, the collection of fake and compromised accounts was being used to amplify political narratives favorable to the AK Parti, and demonstrated strong support for President Erdogan. We‚Äôre disclosing 7,340 accounts to the archive today.\\" According to Stanford Internet Observatory's report, the accounts: * consisted of \\"batches of fabricated personalities, all created on the same day, with similar usernames...\\" * \\"included centrally managed compromised accounts that were used for AKP cheerleading...\\" * \\"some were linked to organizations that were critical of the government. According to Twitter, they are included in the takedown because their accounts were compromised by this network.\\" * \\"Tweets were critical of the Peoples‚Äô Democratic Party (HDP), and accused it of terrorism and social media ploys. Tweets were also critical of the Republican People's Party (CHP).\\" * \\"Tweets promoted the 2017 Turkish constitutional referendum, which consolidated power in Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan.\\" * \\"Tweets worked to increase domestic support for Turkish intervention in Syria. There were also English-language tweets that attempted to increase the external legitimacy of Turkey‚Äôs offensive in northeastern Syria in October 2019.\\" Methods AK Trolls use social media networks (i.e. Facebook, Twitter) in an organized way to promote the AKP, discredit opposition, and attack individuals by spreading false information about them on the Internet. MPs from CHP and HDP asked to start an investigation on AK Trolls as the group is extensively employed to silence individuals by character assassination, insulting, and threatening.

He played domestically for Inverness Caledonian and in English non-league football for Hull City, Darlington and Hurst. Life and career McLeod was born in Inverness in 1888. He played football for his hometown team, Inverness Caledonian of the Highland League, before moving to England in April 1910 to join Football League First Division club Bury. He made his first appearance for their reserve team in a Lancashire Combination defeat to Manchester City's reserves on 11 April, and made his first-team debut on the last day of the 1909‚Äì10 Football League season, at home to Blackburn Rovers in the First Division. A \\"tall, muscular and heavy\\" man whose \\"methods were crude\\", the contrast between his lack of technique and the \\"intense seriousness\\" with which he pursued his task caused the crowd considerable amusement. On the other hand, \\"his unflagging energy and his desire to render good service were very apparent\\", he produced a headed clearance with his goalkeeper beaten that prevented the visitors from equalising, and his dribble from the full-back position to within of goal was instrumental in Bury going 2‚Äì0 ahead. The match ended as a 2‚Äì1 win. He appeared only once more for Bury's first team, in the visit to Blackburn Rovers in January 1911. Standing in for the unfit Tom Millington, McLeod scored with a penalty kick, but Blackburn won 6‚Äì2. McLeod was transfer-listed at the end of the season, and moved on to Darlington. He played twice during their run to the second round (last 32) of the1911‚Äì12 FA CupDick Jackson was preferred in the other matchesand scored three goals as Darlington finished third in the North-Eastern League.

It is comparable to the slang term, 'deathtrap'. The term 'Milo tin' originated in the 1950s as a result of shoddy workmanship and cost-cutting measures, in which damaged vehicles were often repaired with recycled Milo tins as opposed to genuine parts. The workshops would repaint the tin panels, painting over the word 'Milo'. When the repaired vehicles became involved in subsequent accidents, the paint surface would scratch off and the word 'Milo' became visible again. Thus, the term 'Milo tin' was created. In the 1960s, the 'Milo tin' term gained further popularity as a means of criticism towards the light and flimsy construction of early Japanese cars. The Malaysian market had historically been a stronghold for Western car companies, and Japanese cars were initially perceived as inferior and cheaply made. However, the Japanese cars continued to improve and gained a reputation for quality, reliability, high fuel efficiency and value for money. By the 1970s, the Malaysian market was dominated by Japanese cars, and the usage of the 'Milo tin' term against Japanese cars gradually faded. In the 1980s and 1990s, 'Milo tin' regained popularity as a discriminatory term towards Proton and Perodua cars. The early Proton and Perodua vehicles lacked modern safety features such as airbags and ABS. The thin construction also drew criticism, and the door closing action produced an unpleasant tinny sound. Newer models have remedied the old problems, and Proton scored its first 5-star ANCAP safety rating in 2013. However, the negative stigma persists and the term 'Milo tin' is still widely used on Proton and Perodua cars today.

Luftwaffe SIS). Life During World War I he served as a volunteer. Later he studied oriental languages at various German universities, finally specializing in Philology. Using his language skills, he started work in an export business. Eventually moving abroad for several years, but returned in the summer of 1935, when he was offered a position as an interpreter with the German Air Ministry. Military Work Between July and September 1935, he undertook training near Kladow, near Berlin in Morse Telegraphy (Wireless telegraphy), German cryptographic procedures and radio communications. In October 1935, he posted to a fixed intercept station of the Army at Stuttgart until January 1936. During his time there, he translated plain-language radio messages from French Army and Air Force. In addition, he was employed on evaluation and traffic analysis. Between March and April 1936, he was ordered to a two month maneuver employed as an airborne radio operators with KG254 in Kitzingen. His grade during this time was Officer candidate. =First Success= From May to October 15 he succeeded in breaking the recipherment used in conjunction with a French 3 digit code, the basis of which had already been largely reconstructed. The was one with a number-letter cipher table. After the start of the Spanish Civil War he solved many 4-alphabetic Substitution cipher. On 15 October, Voegele was transferred to a new Luftwaffe Intercept Station (Codename:W-15) (Stadelheim Transmitter) close to Munich, where he translated French, Italian and Yugoslavia. =Chi-Stelle= On 1 January 1937, he was assigned to the newly created cipher bureau (German: Chi-Stelle) within Referat K and made Chief of all cryptanalytic work (Cryptanalysis). He was assigned as an assistant, Edward Von Lingen who had learned Russian Army cryptanalysis while at the German Army intercept station in Treuenbrietzen. When Voegele joined Chi-Stelle it consisted of 12 people. During the remainder of the year, Voegele worked on Spanish cyphers as part of monitoring the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War. He also worked on several Czechoslovakian bigraphic procedures (Polygraphic substitution), and on breaking the Czechoslovakian Air Force double-transposition, where the message count only amounted to 10-25 messages per day. Voegele was known to have worked on a number of cyphers during the course of the war. These included the Government Telegraph Code, India Code, Syko, the RAF 4-digit code, Aircraft Movement Code in Autumn 1942, Bomber Code in Winter 1942, January 1943, Slidex in May 1943, Aircraft Reporting Code from July 1943, UCO Weather Code from May 1944 and Weather Codes throughout the war.

Installations  Along with the growing number of exhibitions Amber Cowan has been a part of, she has also been given opportunities to install some of her sculpture pieces in public spaces. In 2014, Cowan was invited on two separate occasions to install her sculpture work in The Philadelphia International Airport.  Technique  Amber Cowan mainly works with discarded glass pieces, repurposing the glass left behind from multiple 20th century American Glass Factories who shut their doors and left many remnants of production behind. A technique that is essential to her is flame working, which is the manipulation of various rods and tubes of glass that will become malleable when heated to high temperatures. Cowan also participates in glass blowing, and hot-sculpting. She will usually re-melt the scraps that are collected, and this technique is a lot more wallet-friendly and is a lot more beneficial to the environment.

Among the geographers of aging is S. Harper, who identified the phenomenon of aging associated with the social construction of old age and the processes of residential mobility of this group to the urban periphery, mainly nursing homes and sheltered housing. The contribution of geographers of aging, such as Graham D. Rowles, SM. Golant, S. Harper, G. Laws, are contributing to environmental gerontology by understanding the environmental aspects of gerontology in developed and developing countries. Also in Spain, some geographers, such as Gloria Fern√°ndez-Mayoralas, Fermina Rojo-P√©rez and Vicente Rodr√≠guez-Rodr√≠guez, have made outstanding contributions to the study of residential strategies, access to health services, and, in general, quality of Life of the elderly, as well as the impacts of Northern European retirees on the Costa del Sol (Spain). In Latin America and Spain, Diego S√°nchez-Gonz√°lez has shed light on the deepening of issues such as the physical-built and social environment and the quality of life of the elderly; the importance of the natural environment (therapeutic natural landscape) on active and healthy aging in the place; residential strategies for the maintenance of the elderly in the communities; the socio- environmental vulnerability of the elderly in the face of climate change; as well as issues related to the attachment to the place (identity and public space); elderly people with disabilities and social exclusion; leisure and tourism of elderly; and the planning of gerontological and geriatric services.

After winning two national championships in full-contact martial arts, Mart√≠nez decided to embark on a career in professional wrestling. When he returned to the states, Spanish was still his first language and he underwent a period of adaptation. Professional wrestling career =Early career= Mart√≠nez trained at the Monster Factory and went on to win several titles in Monster Factory Pro Wrestling. In 2014, Mart√≠nez attended a Ring of Honor (ROH) training camp and went on to train at the ROH dojo. =Ring of Honor (2015‚Äì2018)= His first appearance at a ROH show was in 2015 under his real name, Luis Mart√≠nez, where he competed in two dark matches, losing the first to The Romantic Touch and winning the second alongside Shaheem Ali against Hellcat and Mattick. Mart√≠nez made his return in Ring of Honor, billed as \\"Punisher Martinez\\", at the ROH Top Prospect Tournament where he defeated Colby Corino in the first round. Martinez lost to Lio Rush in the semifinals; however, in spite of the loss, Martinez was signed to a contract by Ring of Honor. He subsequently aligned with BJ Whitmer and Kevin Sullivan, entering a rivalry with their adversary Steve Corino. On September 16, 2016, Martinez took part in the 2016 Honor Rumble, where he had an impressive showing before ultimately being eliminated. In early November he participated in the 2016 Survival of the Fittest, where he ended up being eliminated in the final Six Man Mayhem match. Martinez and Whitmer went on to briefly feud with the former ROH World Tag Team Champions War Machine (Hanson and Raymond Rowe), first wrestling them to a no contest and then defeating them in an anything goes match. Through ROH's working relationship with New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW), Martinez appeared at the two-day Honor Rising: Japan 2017 event. On the first night, Martinez teamed up with Los Ingobernables de Japon members Hiromu Takahashi and Tetsuya Naito to defeat Dalton Castle, Hiroshi Tanahashi and Ryusuke Taguchi, with Martinez picking up the win for his team. On the second night, Martinez unsuccessfully challenged Hirooki Goto for the NEVER Openweight Championship. Using the name Damian Martinez, he returned to ROH to unsuccessfully compete in a Manhattan Mayhem Battle Royal for the #1 Contendership to the ROH World Championship. Martinez also entered a Battle Royal for the #1 Contendership to the ROH World Television Championship, which he also lost. On February 11, Martinez and B.J. Whitmer defeated War Machine, but after the match Martinez turned on Whitmer by hitting him with his South of Heaven finishing maneuver. Martinez won his first championship in ROH on June 16, 2018, defeating Silas Young for the World Television Championship at night two of the Promotion's \\"State of the Art\\" event in Dallas, Texas. Martinez had qualified for an opportunity at said championship earlier that same evening by pinning Cheeseburger in a six-way Proving Ground match. At Death Before Dishonor XVI, he successfully defended the title against Chris Sabin. After the match, he attacked Sabin, until Jeff Cobb made the save. On September 29, his contract with Ring of Honor expired and he opted out of a contract offer. In his final appearance for the promotion, Martinez dropped the Television Championship against Cobb. =WWE = NXT (2018‚Äìpresent) On October 12, 2018, it was reported that Martinez had signed a contract with WWE, six days later he was formally introduced, among other new members to the NXT brand. On November 28, at an NXT TV taping in Winter Park, Florida, Martinez made his debut as a heel, losing to Matt Riddle. On April 15, 2019, it was reported that Martinez would be repackaged and go by the new ring name \\"Damian Priest\\". However, throughout April and May he was still wrestling under the \\"Punishment Martinez\\" name on NXT house shows. Vignettes began airing starting at NXT TakeOver: XXV in June, reintroducing Martinez under this new character of Damian Priest. Debuting as Damian Priest, he defeated Raul Mendoza. His next match was against Keith Lee, which he also won. (Supporting Citation) On the October 2 episode of NXT, Priest would start a feud with former WWE UK Champion Pete Dunne when he attacked Dunne after his match. This led to a match between both of them on October 16th episode of NXT, which was won by Priest. A rematch was held between Dunne and Priest where Dunne defeated Priest, however after the match, Killian Dain attacked both men. On the November 13th episode of NXT, a match between Dunne and Dain was scheduled on the night. However, Priest attacked Dain and subsequently, a brawl occurred between the three. This eventually led to a triple threat match at NXT TakeOver: War Games (2019) for #1 contendership for the NXT Championship. Priest and Dain were both defeated by Dunne in that match. Priest would also become a part of 5-on-5-on-5 Survivor Series pay-per-view match, representing Team NXT in a losing effort to Team SmackDown also involving Team Raw, where he was eliminated when Randy Orton pinned him after countering Priest's finishing move \\"The Reckoning\\" and then executing an RKO on him. Priest was nominated for NXT Year-End Awards 2019 under the category \\"Breakout Star of the Year Award\\" which was won by Keith Lee. On January 8th, Damian Priest competed in a Fatal 4-Way match to determine the number one contender for NXT North American Championship, with Keith Lee, Dominik Dijakovic and Cameron Grimes as the other 3 competitors, which was won by Lee. On 29th January episode of NXT, Damian Priest interrupted the then NXT North American Champion Keith Lee, saying that \\"he liked taking things\\", and expressed his wish to take the NXT North American Championship from Lee. However, Dominik Dijakovic also interrupted and subsequently a match was held between the two, where Priest lost to Dijakovic. Priest then attacked Dijakovic using a nightstick during his match against Cameron Grimes, continuing their rivalry. On 11th March, 2020, Priest attacked Keith Lee after his match against Grimes using the same nightstick and then got away through the crowd the same way he got away when he attacked Dijakovic previously. This led to a triple threat match for the North American Championship, where Priest lost. Priest once again attacked Keith Lee between his match with Velveteen Dream vs The Undisputed Era with a nightstick and challenged Keith Lee for a singles match for the NXT North American Championship one more time. A match was held between the two for the title, where Priest lost. On 22nd April, 2020 episode of NXT, Finn B√°lor got attacked backstage by an unknown attacker, which resulted in his removal from his scheduled match against Velveteen Dream. The next week, a video footage was shown of B√°lor‚Äôs locker room looking disheveled and he was gone. After he issued a warning to the attacker, B√°lor was scheduled to be in a match against Cameron Grimes on 13th May, 2020. During their match, Damian Priest distracted and attacked Finn B√°lor using a nightstick, resulting in Grimes defeating B√°lor. After this match, Priest revealed that he was the unknown attacker. Priest then challenged B√°lor for a match at NXT TakeOver: In Your House, which B√°lor accepted. In that match, Priest was defeated by B√°lor. Despite the loss, Priest's in-ring performance in this match was highly appreciated by Triple H and also by the fans. After that match, Priest praised Finn B√°lor in a backstage interview and accepted that he was humiliated, no excuses, and also said that it was just the next step for Priest's name to live forever, turning face for the first time his WWE career. On 10th June, 2020 episode of NXT, Cameron Grimes flaunted his previous victory over Finn B√°lor and deemed Priest as a \\"loser\\" in a backstage interview, leading Priest to attack him, confirming Priest's face turn. This ignited a small rivalry between Grimes and Priest, which concluded just before the tournament held for the vacated NXT North American Championship. NXT North American Champion (2020-Present) Damian Priest then again started to pursue the vacant NXT North American Championship and he was scheduled to be in a triple threat match involving himself, Oney Lorcan and the returning Ridge Holland, the winner of which would be given a spot to win the title in a ladder match at NXT TakeOver: XXX. Priest won the qualifier match the next week and he was added to the ladder match at NXT TakeOver XXX, as one of the 5 competitors. During this time, Priest also started a small rivalry with Bronson Reed. At NXT TakeOver: XXX, Damian Priest won the ladder match for the North American Title, thus earning his first championship in WWE. Priest then had a successful title defense against Timothy Thatcher and then another successful defense against Johnny Gargano at NXT: TakeOver 31. On October 14th episode of NXT, Priest then successfully defended his title against Dexter Lumis, but after the match, he got attacked by Gargano by a steel chair, leading to a rematch for the title between the two at NXT: Halloween Havoc.  Professional wrestling style and persona  Martinez is known to have a deep voice, which has helped him in his promos to maintain a menacing, dark character in ROH. His wrestling style involves various power moves as well as high flying moves, and his striking is heavily influenced by his background in martial arts. He uses the Razor's Edge (a crucifix drop powerbomb which was inherited from Razor Ramon, his childhood wrestling idol), and his finisher, a inverted swinging cutter, called The Reckoning. He also used a sit-out chokeslam called the South of Heaven as his finisher, when he was working with ROH, which he still uses in the WWE as one of his signature moves, but not as a finisher.

She was best known for her depictions of natural landscapes, wildflowers, and First Nations communities in Canada. Much of her work thematically explored Albertan identity, though she remains relatively obscure in discussions of Canadian art. Life Mary Annora Brown was born near Red Deer, Alberta, Canada in 1899, the daughter of Edmund Forster Brown of the North West Mounted Police and Elizabeth Ethel Cody. Forster Brown had ridden with Sam Steele and Kootenay Brown, while Cody, who was related to Buffalo Bill Cody, had traveled west from Ontario and was a schoolteacher. Annora Brown grew up in Fort Macleod, Alberta. Her introduction to art came from her mother, who had in turn been taught to paint by Florence Carlyle. Brown went on to study at the Ontario College of Art from 1925-1929. Two of her instructors were notable Group of Seven members Arthur Lismer and J. E. H. MacDonald. These artists were interested in developing a modernist strand of Canadian art that could contribute to the construction of a Canadian identity, but she was encouraged to develop her own style. At the OCA she met and became friends with other notable western artists, which included Euphemia McNaught and Illingworth Kerr. Brown then taught at Mount Royal College in Calgary, Alberta from 1929 to 1931. Upon her return to Fort Macleod in 1931, she completed work for the University of Alberta Faculty of Extension on handicrafts. She continued producing artwork in her studio, while also working as an illustrator and designer, caring for her parents, and engaging in amateur naturalism. She became committed to the introduction of art schools in the region and was one of several artists committed to expanding Albertan art education in the 1930s and 1940s. From 1945-1950 she taught at the Banff School of Fine Arts. She displayed with and became a member of various artistic organisations throughout her career, and she was the first female member of the Alberta Society of Artists. In 1965, Brown moved to British Columbia, initially to Sidney, and then to Deep Cove, where she continued to make art. In 1971, she was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Lethbridge. Brown died in Deep Cove in 1987. Publications During the 1930s Brown began to gather information relating to the history and lore of southern Alberta wildflowers, which would later become her first major publication: Old Man's Garden. It was published in 1954 by J.M. Dent & Sons, the publisher for whom she had previously completed book illustrations for. The book integrates practical knowledge and lore from southern Alberta First Nations communities the Piikani and Kainai nations, with scientific and historical information derived from the accounts of European botanical explorers. In particular, Old Man's Garden describes the spiritual creator of the prairies in Blackfoot culture, named Napi. Brown also completed scratchboard illustrations for the book. It was republished in 1970 by Evergreen Press. After she retired to Deep Cove, Brown began work on her autobiography, which was published as Sketches from Life, in 1981. The book features an introduction by Frank Lynch-Staunton, the 11th Lieutenant Governor of Alberta, who was a family friend of Brown's. Art Evening Star, by Annora Brown Brown was a versatile artist and worked in various mediums, including oil painting, watercolour, graphic design and print making. She was best known for her paintings of natural landscapes, wildflowers and Canadian First Nations communities, focusing her work on western Canadian imagery and themes.Hunt, J. Doris (1944‚Äì45). \\"The art of Annora Brown A.O.C.A.\\". Canadian Review of Music and Art 3 11‚Äì12: 27‚Äì29, 31. Brown's work, which depicted objects and landscapes that were considered mundane at the time (such as grain elevators and prairie landscapes), was viewed as radical by patrons of the local art market. She was one of the first artists to depict regional subject matter in an attempt to define Albertan identity.Mary-Beth Laviolette, A Delicate Art: Artists, Wildflowers and Native Plants of the West, (Victoria: Rocky Mountain Books, 2012), 88. She rejected the conservatism of early 20th century Albertan art, instead taking influence from local communities, native plants and the regional landscape. Her work and philosophies contributed to the exploration and formation of local identity, the themes of which are still relevant to provincial identity today. Though well-known in the Fort Macleod region, she has become obscure in wider discussions of the history of Canadian art. Brown had an extensive knowledge of Albertan plant life and cultivated wildflowers in her garden in Fort Macleod. During the Great Depression she began to paint small \\"portraits\\" of flowers which she sold for $1.Annora Brown, Sketches from Life (Edmonton, Alberta: Hurting), 170; Patricia Alderson, Annora Brown: Forming a Regionalist Sensibility (Calgary, Alberta: University of Calgary), 44. She was later hired, in 1958, by the Glenbow Foundation to create 200 paintings of Alberta wildflowers. In order to find specimens to paint, Brown travelled to various natural areas in the province such as Waterton Lakes National Park and Banff National Park. She completed the commission in 1960. Some of the flowers she painted are now extinct, and the paintings, done in watercolour and casein, are now housed in the Glenbow art collection. Brown displays modernist tendencies in her use of bold colours, and takes influence from her instructor Lawren Harris in portraying natural spaces using abstract and geometric shapes. Her works have a decorative character, which reflects her experience in design, embroidery, and production of batik textile arts.

When Gordon mentioned the name to his wife, she thought he had said Chucking Beans, which gave him the idea to name the characters Chuck and Beans, and the name was set. Gordon started drawing Chuck & Beans, a comic strip about a rabbit and a dog in their 20s who were obsessed with pop culture and dating. The characters appeared on many Hallmark greeting cards. Fowl Language Amidst Hallmark Cards' financial troubles, Gordon's friends urged him to create a new comic that he owned. Gordon was also finding it increasingly difficult to write comic strips for characters who were single and in their 20s while he was in a different stage of life.

It is approximately long and flows through Lower Saucon Township and Hellertown. The watershed of the stream has an area of . A reach of the stream is designated as an impaired waterbody due to siltation from agriculture. However, wild trout and other wildlife are present in and around it. Most of the watershed is forested. Course Polk Valley Run begins in a valley between Kohlberg and Swoveberg in Lower Saucon Township. It flows west-southwest for several tenths of a mile, passing through an unnamed pond, and eventually exiting the valley. The stream then turns west-northwest for several tenths of a mile before turning west and entering Hellertown. After a few tenths of a mile, it turns southwest, crossing Pennsylvania Route 412 and reaching its confluence with Saucon Creek. Polk Valley Run joins Saucon Creek upstream of its mouth. Hydrology In 14 measurements between 1962 and 1978, the discharge of Polk Valley Run at Hellertown ranged from . All but three measurements were under . Between the early 1960s and the early 1980s, the peak annual discharge of the stream ranged from just over to nearly one year in the mid-1970s. A reach of Polk Valley Run is designated as an impaired waterbody due to siltation from agricultural activity. During a 24-day study period in August and September 2011, the turbidity of the stream was usually below 100 Nephelometric Turbidity Units, but spiked to over 200 during Hurricane Irene. A total of of suspended sediment was observed in the stream during the study period, including during the 48-hour Hurricane Irene. The sediment in the stream had finer sediments than those in some other nearby streams, such as Silver Creek. Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Polk Valley Run is above sea level. The elevation near the source of the stream is above sea level. Polk Valley Run has a shallow stream corridor in Hellertown. It often overruns its banks, adversely impacting nearby properties. Channelization and rebuilding a culvert carrying the stream under Main Street have been proposed as flood control measures. The Hardyston Formation and felsic to mafic gneiss is present in the watershed of Polk Valley Run. The stream's valley is also home to some quartzite that is slightly atypical for the region: brittle and gray with pebbles up to three eighths of an inch in diameter. Watershed The watershed of Polk Valley Run has an area of . The stream is entirely within the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Hellertown. The watershed of Polk Valley Run is mostly in Lower Saucon Township, but a small part of it is in Hellertown. The watershed is on the southern edge of the Saucon Creek watershed and borders the watershed of Silver Creek. Upstream of the gauging station in the lower reaches of Polk Valley Run, more than three quarters of the stream's watershed is forested. The remainder is agricultural and suburban land, with the former being more common. A tract of land known as the Saucon Valley Environmental Education Center is in the vicinity of Polk Valley Run. The tract also contains scrub meadow and floodplain woodlands. The Hellertown Borough Authority draws water from springs in the stream's watershed. History Polk Valley Run was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1184211. The stream is also known as Poke Valley Run. This variant name appears in the 1939 Northampton County, Pennsylvania geological survey by Benjamin L. Miller and others. It has also been historically known as Snipe Valley Creek. Numerous explanations have been given for the stream's various names. The name \\"Poke Valley Run\\" may come from the \\"shite pokes\\" (small green herons) that once were common in the area, or from an abundance of pokeberry plants in the area. A very early name for the stream's valley, \\"Schnippe Thai\\" also comes from snipes. The name \\"Polk Valley Run\\" comes from James Polk, the 11th president of the United States. Springs in the valley of Polk Valley Run have supplied Hellertown with water since at least the 1930s. Properties along Polk Valley Run were damaged during flooding from Hurricane Irene in 2011. The Polk Valley Road Connector Trail, a paved asphalt trail between Polk Valley Park and the Saucon Valley School District campus, crosses Polk Valley Run via a pedestrian bridge. The trail was completed in April 2012. Biology Wild trout naturally reproduce in Polk Valley Run from its headwaters downstream to its mouth.

Marjorie Pigott was born to an English father and a Japanese mother, who, recognizing Pigott's artistic talent, sent her to study under master artists at the Nanga School, founded in the 15th century. Her mother was of noble birth and their home was filled with ancient Japanese treasures, which were mostly destroyed during the 1923 Great Kant≈ç earthquake. After twelve years of study Pigott was designated a Nanga master herself. With World War II looming, Pigott left Japan together with her sister Edith, arriving in Vancouver in 1940 and settling in Toronto. From 1955 to 1965 she taught the Nanga technique to Japanese in Canada. She started painting Canadian scenes, such as the landscapes around Muskoka, using the Nanga technique and gradually developed her own style of semi-abstract wet-into-wet watercolour painting. Her work was exhibited in several solo exhibitions and group shows in Canada. Her work is represented in collections of the National Gallery of Canada among others. She was a member of and exhibited her work with the Canadian Sociery of Painters in Water Colour and the Ontario Society of Artists. She was elected to the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts in 1973.

Oscar \\"Battling\\" Nelson) and herself. Fay King in 1913. Fay Barbara King (March 1889 ‚Äì presumed dead [after 1954]) was an American illustrator, journalist, and cartoonist. Some of her work represents an early example of autobiographical comics. King worked for newspapers and magazines in the early twentieth century (at least from 1912 to 1937), moving to New York City in 1918. She was one of the popular Jazz Age cartoonists appearing in the 1924 comedy The Great White Way.  Biography  King was born in Seattle, Washington in March 1889, to John and Ella King. She was raised in Portland, Oregon, and went to college at Seattle University. The young King was adventurous, being one of the first women in the Portland area to own an automobile, and in 1912 had announced plans for a balloon ascension with noted early parachutist Georgia \\"Tiny\\" Broadwick, before the plan was rejected by her parents, according to an article in The Oregonian. King's father had been an employee at a Turkish bath, as well a trainer of athletes, and she seems to have had a deep affinity for sport. King married boxer Oscar \\"Battling\\" Nelson in 1913, in the Hegewisch neighborhood of Chicago. Their divorce in 1916 was widely covered by the press. The Veteran Boxing Association paid for part of the cost of Nelson's 1954 funeral; King paid the remainder, in addition to purchasing \\"beautiful arrangements\\" for the ceremony. King worked for The Denver Post from April 1912 to 1918, leaving for The San Francisco Examiner. She later became feature writer and cartoonist for the New York Evening Journal. In 1924, she appeared as herself in the comedy The Great White Way (alongside other cartoonists, such as Winsor McCay and George McManus). Work King's cartoons are recalled as an early example of autobiographical comics within the genre of newspaper cartooning. She frequently depicted herself in her comics, using a spindly, gangly caricature that bore a strong resemblance to the character of Olive Oyl, who would later be created by E.C. Segar for his Thimble Theater strip. In addition to her autobiographical reporting, she is known to have created two strips, both of which ran in the New-York Mirror: \\"Mazie\\" (which ran briefly in 1924) and \\"Girls Will Be Girls\\" (which ran between 1924 and 1925).

The site was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1981 by the Japanese government. Overview During the initial J≈çmon period (approximately 7000 years ago), sea levels were some three meters higher than at present, and the ambient temperature was also 2 deg C higher. During this period, the T≈çhoku region was inhabited by the J≈çmon people, many of whom lived in coastal settlements. The middens associated with such settlements contain bone, botanical material, mollusc shells, sherds, lithics, and other artifacts and ecofacts associated with the now-vanished inhabitants, and these features, provide a useful source into the diets and habits of J≈çmon society. Most of these middens are found along the Pacific coast of Japan. The location of the shell midden is on a river terrace on the right bank of the Gonohe River in northern Hachinohe, at an altitude of approximately 10 to 20 meters. The area was first surveyed by the Aomori Prefectural Cultural Heritage Expert Committee in 1958, and excavated extensively from 1977-1979 when the site became endangered by the construction on the nearby Kurono Industrial Park. The site dates from the initial J≈çmon period (7000 BC) and the shell midden consisted of four separate middens with an average thickness of 40-50 centimeters, increasing to 1.1 meter near the remains of dwellings, indicating that the site had been occupied for many centuries, however no remains of pit dwellings have been discovered. The midden contained the remnants of some 30 varieties of shellfish, bones of nine types of animals, three types of birds, birds and at least 20 different varieties of fish and an extremely large number of Hamaguri shells, indicating the importance of these clams in the early J≈çmon period diet. Some of the shellfish in the midden are no longer found in the area, indicating that the ocean temperatures during this period were warmer than at present. The midden also contained shards of J≈çmon pottery marked with cord-patterns, as well as stone tools and implements and objects fashioned from bone (fishing hooks, needles, hairpins, etc.). Some of the fish bones were oceanic species (such as bonito and sea bass), and the presence of combination fish hooks and open socketed harpoon heads indicates that the local inhabitants had the capability of offshore fishing as well as gathering of marine resources from inner bay areas. Many of the artifacts recovered from the site are on display at the Hachinohe City Museum. There are no public facilities at the site, which has been backfilled and is now located under rice paddies. There is only a billboard with some explanatory text and photographs. It is approximately a 30 minute walk from the Aoimori Railway Mutsu-Ichikawa Station. The site has been submitted for inscription on the UNESCO World Heritage List as one of the J≈çmon Archaeological Sites in Hokkaid≈ç, Northern T≈çhoku, and other regions See also *List of Historic Sites of Japan (Aomori) References External links *Jomon Archaeological Sites *Ch≈çshichiyachi Shell Mound Agency for Cultural Affairs *Hachinohe City Museum site *Aomori Prefectural site Archaeological sites in Japan J≈çmon period Hachinohe Shell middens in Japan History of Aomori Prefecture Historic Sites of Japan ","title":"Ch≈çshichiyachi Shell Mound"},{"id":"53452849","text":"An Ofo bicycle in Hangzhou, China Ofo (), stylised as ofo, is a Beijing-based bicycle sharing company founded in 2014. The dockless system uses its smartphone app to unlock and locate nearby bicycles, charging an hourly rate for use. In 2017, it had deployed over 10 million bicycles in 250 cities and 20 countries. The company was valued at up to $2 billion and has over 62.7 million monthly active users. In 2018, Ofo announced massive reduction in operations, including withdrawing from most US cities and from several entire countries. History = 2014‚Äì2016: Founding in China = The company was founded in 2014 by five members of the Peking University cycling club as a project that initially focused on bicycle tourism before deciding on bicycle sharing. It was named \\"Ofo\\" due to the word's resemblance to a cyclist on a bicycle. Ofo was launched in June 2015 in Beijing, gaining 20,000 users and 2,000 bicycles by October with investment funding from a Peking University alumnus. In 2016, Ofo expanded to other cities in China, and had a fleet of 85,000 bicycles by the end of the year. The company raised $130 million in funding from tech firms Xiaomi and Didi Chuxing in September 2016, allowing it to expand outside China. A Series D funding round in February 2017, led by Didi Chuxing and Russian investor Digital Sky Technologies, raised $450 million for Ofo and valued the company at $1 billion. = 2016‚Äì2018: International expansion = Ofo began expanding outside China in 2017, with launches in Singapore in February 2017; Cambridge, United Kingdom in April; Seattle, United States in August; and Sydney, Australia in October. In April 2017, it was announced that the United Nations Development Programme has started a partnership to raise public awareness on climate changes. The partnership project, 1 KM Action, lead to another collaboration with the Clara Lionel Foundation, an organisation founded by Rihanna, which aims to provide bikes and scholarships to girls in Malawi. The same month, Ofo announced an undisclosed amount of funding from Ant Financial, an Alibaba affiliate. In July 2017, Ofo announced $700 million of additional funding in a round led by Alibaba, Hony Capital and Citic PE. In December 2017, Ofo launched its service in Paris, France, and progressively deployed 2,500 bikes over the city of Paris and neighbouring Neuilly-sur-Seine, Boulogne-Billancourt and Levallois- Perret. According to figures communicated by the company in July 2018, the bikes are rented up to four times a day, representing 5,000 to 10,000 daily trips. Ofo says the financial accounts for its Paris operations are balanced. In February 2018, Texas A&M; University partnered with Ofo and rolled out a bike sharing platform on campus. Ofo raised an additional $866 million led by Alibaba in March 2018. For the US market, Ofo hired Uber spokesperson and Mandarin speaker Chris Taylor to run US operations. =From 2018: Crisis, focusing on \\"priority\\" markets, withdrawal= After missing the opportunity to merge with Mobike and failing to reach an acquisition deal with Didi, Ofo now suffers from consistently high operational costs and lack of additional funding to expand its business. Amidst a cash crunch, Ofo only ordered 80,000 of its expected 5 million annual bicycles. After Mobike received a US$2.7 billion investment from Meituan-Dianping, Ofo began an international and domestic contraction to stay alive. In an internal meeting, Ofo's CEO Dai Wei compared the company's situation to wartime Britain, as portrayed in the film Darkest Hour. He told his staff that they could leave the company then if they didn't want to fight until the end. In July 2018, Ofo announced that it will entirely leave several countries and significantly reduce the number of cities served in others in order to focus on \\"priority\\" markets. Operations ceased completely in Australia, Austria, Germany (where Ofo was present with 3,000 bikes in Berlin for only three months), India (5,000 bikes in Bangalore, Delhi, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Coimbatore, Indore and Pune), Israel, Spain (Granada, Madrid) and Thailand...... . In the United Kingdom, the company left Cambridge, Norwich, Oxford and Sheffield and cancelled its planned launch in Leeds in order to focus on London only,.. but withdrew from London in January 2019. In the United States (over 40,000 bikes in 30 locations in June 2018), Ofo announced the layoff of 70 % of its employees to focus on an unspecified ‚Ä≥handful of cities‚Ä≥. In August, Ofo left Dallas, leaving hundreds of bikes at the recycling center and exited Seattle, where it donated some 800 bikes to three nonprofits. In August 2018, China's Didi and Ant Financial weighed a joint $2 billion buyout of Ofo, but Dai Wei said he would even turn down an offer of US$10 billion. In October 2018 a flood of requests for Ofo user deposit refunds started. In December 2018, Ofo considered declaring bankruptcy several times over cash flow issues. It was reported in January 2019 that Ofo had dissolved its international division and offered its 50 remaining employees the option to leave immediately or take a 50% pay cut and transfer to the Chinese business. Ofo's former employees in Singapore also said in January 2019 that the firm's operations in the country have \\"practically ceased\\" as there were no personnel left. As of February 3, 2019, Ofo's website has become defunct and shows a plain white page. The Ofo app still works and bicycle's location are still shown in the app. On January 14, 2019, Singapore's Land Transport Authority suspended Ofo's operating license due to its failure to meet regulatory requirements such as implementation of QR code for parking of bike and decreasing its fleet size. Ofo was required to remove all its bicycles within a month. Usage The lock installed on Ofo bicycles. Customers use the company's mobile app on their smartphones to locate nearby bicycles. Each bike has a QR code on the frame, which the customer scans to unlock the bike. Ofo bike unlocking is also available on other collaborative apps such as WeChat and Alipay in Mainland China. Each yellow bicycle reports its location via satellite positioning, allowing users to see which bikes are available nearby. Users pay within the app with their credit cards. After customers are finished, they can leave the bike anywhere and lock it. The bicycles use NarrowBand IOT to power the locks, developed by Huawei and China Telecom. Controversy Like many other dockless bike sharing companies, including ReddyBike and oBike, Ofo's bikes have raised the ire of several cities, including Melbourne in Australia; Dallas, Texas; Chicago, Illinois; and San Diego, California. Because these bike companies do not ensure the bikes are parked properly, they can clutter sidewalks, blocking pedestrian and handicapped access. Bike clutter has been so extreme that some cities in China have reached \\"peak bike\\" capacity, and have begun regulating the number of bikes that may be deployed. Ofo was also nicknamed awful by those who had a bad experience with the service. The terms of service for Ofo also require injury claims to be settled by a private arbitrator and waive the user's right to appeal or join in a class-action lawsuit.

She uses photography to explore issues of identity and the diversity of African cultures. Her 2014 series, H√¢√¢br√©, The Last Generation, documents the last generation of scarified Africans. In 2019 she was awarded the Prix Pictet for her series √áa va aller (It will be OK). Life and work Choumali was born and raised in Abidjan. After attending local international schools, she studied Graphic Arts in Casablanca and worked as an art director in an advertising agency before starting her photography career. Her style includes conceptual portraiture, mixed media and documentary. Much of her work focuses on Africa, her assumptions about the diversity of cultures around her, and her expanding conceptions of the world. As a child, Choumali would travel to Adaou, a small town in the southeast, to visit her grandmother, a farmer and trader. She often felt a cultural disconnect as they did not speak the same language or share life experiences. After her grandmother died in 2001, Choumali lamented losing part of her family history and questioned her identity as an African. This experience inspired her 2014 portrait series, \\"Resilients\\", which documents young, professional African women who also struggled with connecting to their family's traditional past. The only requirement was that the women had to wear traditional clothing already worn by their grandmother or an older female relative, emphasizing the link between past and present. Choumali used to be fascinated seeing people of different social origins proudly displaying their facial scarification across the Ivory Coast, but the practice is dying out. Choumali's 2014 work, H√¢√¢br√©, the Last Generation, documents the last generation of scarified Africans. ‚ÄúH√¢√¢br√©‚Äù means ‚Äúwriting‚Äù, ‚Äúsign‚Äù and ‚Äúscarification‚Äù; this one word signifies all three notions in K√µ, a language from Burkina Faso.

In 1966, Cling graduated from the Intermountain Indian School in Brigham City, Utah.  Career  Cling learned the craft of pottery from her mother, Rose Williams, and her great aunt, Grace Barlow. The pots are created from clay found near the Black Mesa area in Apache-Navajo Counties in Arizona, and are then fired outdoors using juniper wood, with the firing process enhancing the clay's natural pigments. Cling and her mother and aunt were responsible for revitalizing traditional Navajo pottery. Cling is a coil potter, and was the first Navajo potter to use a smooth river stone to polish her pots instead of the traditional corncob. Her pottery is considered non- utilitarian, which represented a huge shift from function to art. In 1978, Cling's work was selected by Joan Mondale and featured in the vice- presidential mansion in Washington, D.C. and she was honored with the Arizona Indian Living Treasures Award in 2006. Cling's work is in the collection of the Smithsonian.  Personal life  Cling learned her pottery skills from her mother, master potter Rose Williams.

They were then interpreted by male priests. Well known is the prediction to the people of Athens to use wooden walls as a means to defeat the Persians. This was taken as advice to build triremes. The Persian fleet was defeated in the Battle of Salamis. On display is one of many castings of this main work of Marcello. The male pseudonym was used by the countess Ad√©la√Øde Nathalie Marie Hedwige Philippine d‚ÄôAffry, who could not benefit from an education at the PAFA where Eakins allowed women to study the nude. Therefore, she used castings of her own body in creating the sculpture.

The company's headquarters are located in the eastern Westphalian town of Kirchlengern. In 2015, 5900 employees worldwide worked for Hettich, of which more than 3,000 are in Germany. The company has 38 subsidiaries worldwide. Hettich is family-owned.  History  Karl Hettich founded a metal industry in the Black Forest in 1888 and developed the so-called \\"Buckmaschine\\" for bending anchor hooks for pendulum clocks. After the death of the founder of the company in 1894, his widow and later the eldest son Franz Hettich continued the operation with six employees. Franz Hettich later recognized market opportunities for hinges for small watch cases and developed products for this segment. In 1921 Franz Hettich took his four brothers Paul, August, Ferdinand and Josef Hettich into the company. In 1928 August Hettich developed the first fully automatic bar hinge machine for the production of piano bands.http://www.fpb.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Welcome-to- Hettich-New-2013-edit.pdf In 1930, Paul Hettich GmbH was founded in Herford, a center of the furniture industry. Bar hinges for the furniture industry were produced with seven employees. In 1933 the production of wood screws was taken and in 1936 the product range was extended by the production of cabinet pipes. The 50th anniversary of the headquarters in the Black Forest was celebrated in 1936. The workforce in Herford had grown to 50 employees. By bombs, on 24 November 1944, about 80 percent of the buildings and a large proportion of the machines were destroyed in Herford. In the last days of the war the company lost its boss Paul Hettich. The authorized signatory Alfred G√ºnter continued the operation. After the war production in 1945 was resumed with 25 employees. 1992 saw the turnaround in the growth of the company, and a focus on core competency took place. The Heinze injection molding company and the company Koralle were sold. In 1994, a part of the production to the Czech Republic was relocated to a subsidiary founded there. In 1995 the company was restructured and became a holding company with independent, decentralized companies. In 15 countries over 4,000 employees worked for Hettich. It was followed by the founding of subsidiaries in Poland and Italy as well as the start of production in Russia. In 1996 the Brazilian company Plastipar Industria, now Hettich do Brazil, was purchased and integrated into the Hettich Group. In addition, a production facility was set up in China. In 2005 the logistics center in Kirchlengern was put into operation. After 17 years 55% of the shares were in foreign hands, Anton Hettich together with his two sons Rainer and Andreas Hettich led the company back completely into the family possession in 2005.

Biography  Born in Kiev, she came to the United States in 1911 and was raised and educated in Newark, New Jersey. Following a career in modeling and later in the rare book departments of Bamberger's department store in Newark and Brentano's Bookstore in New York, she met and married (May 20, 1919 ‚Äì June 23, 1983), an American sculptor, in 1942. The couple moved to Port-au-Prince, Haiti, in January 1946, where Jason would teach under a U. S. Government grant and have three solo exhibitions at the Centre d'Art (in 1946, 1948, and 1949), along with several commissions. Clara, a self-taught artist, taught dance while in Haiti and began sculpting during this period. Working primarily in wood, mainly Haitian mahogany, as well as bronze and aluminum, her sculptures mostly took the forms of abstract torsos and heads. Following their years in Haiti, the couple lived in Paris and Germany. Clara was first represented in the United States by Kraushaar Galleries in New York, although her paintings and drawings were shown by the Schainen Stern Gallery in 1960. Jason taught at Hofstra University from 1953 to 1965. Clara would later work in various media, including pastel and watercolor, in the 1940s and 1950s. She received artist's fellowships to Yaddo in 1987 and 1990. Jason, who received his BA in sculpture at Cornell University in 1940, began teaching sculpture there in 1966, becoming chair of the Department of Art (1968‚Äì73) and dean of the College of Architecture, Art and Planning (1980‚Äì83). Clara would give several of her artworks to Cornell's Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art. Among their other gifts to the Johnson Museum were portraits of the couple by Waldo Peirce and Lotte Jacobi. The long-planned Jason and Clara Seley Sculpture Court, featuring three sculptures by Jason, was completed at Cornell in December 2017.

A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. A partial solar eclipse occurs in the polar regions of the Earth when the center of the Moon's shadow misses the Earth. It was one of four partial eclipses that took place that year, each two in two months, the last one was on September 19 and covered a part of the Northern Hemisphere. Description The eclipse was visible in much of the southwestern portion of the Indian Ocean which included several island such as Kergueren and New Amsterdam and a small part of the Atlantic, it was also visible in much of Antarctica (at the time parts had a 24-hour daylight) and left the northeast corner, much of the peninsula and edges within the Trans-Antarctic Mountains in the west not visible, the eclipse was nearly close to the island of Madagascar. The eclipse close to Madagascar and then into the Indian Ocean and finished in the west of the Trans-Antarctic Mountains close to Ross Sea. It showed about up to 10% obscurity in Northern Antarctica, about 20% within the South Pole and 40% in northcentral part of Antarctica.. The greatest eclipse was in the Pacific Ocean around the area separating the Indian and the Atlantic Oceans offshore from Antarctica at 61.5 S and 16.4 E at 3:27:17 UTC (4:27:17 local time) at the furthermost area of the Southwestern Hemisphere (sometimes as the Southwestern Tetrasphere).

She lives in New York and Paris.  Life  Born in Paris in 1953, Vicky Colombet grew up in Paris in a family that was artistic and intellectual on her father‚Äôs side and nomadic on her mother‚Äôs side. Her mother‚Äôs search for her ancestry led the family to travel often to Asia. The exposure to Asian Culture at an early age, has been a major influence. An avid reader of poetry and philosophy Colombet began as a writer and wrote two essays in Les Temps Modernes ‚ÄúLes Femmes s‚Äôent√™tent\\" Involved in the Feminist movement in Paris, she met Simone de Beauvoir in 1974 and co-founded with her, and Anne Zelensky, Annie Sugier and Annie Cohen ‚ÄúLa Ligue du Droit des Femmes‚Äù. Vicky Colombet started a newspaper ‚ÄúLes Nouvelles F√©ministes‚Äù (1974 to 1977) with Simone de Beauvoir as the Editor-in-chief. The writer Christiane Rochefort (1917-1998) who became a close friend encouraged her to pursue an artistic career. The painter Henri Dimier (1899-1986) who was an iconoclast with an Asian approach to the practice of art became her mentor. And later, having the opportunity to meet with Agnes Martin in the last years of her life, Colombet was influenced by Martin‚Äôs rigor and her withdrawal from the world.  Work  In 2001, Colombet moved to America and became a U.S. citizen in 2013. In many of her paintings and drawings, as well as in her major architectural work the sandblasted curved glass wall of Villa Nurbs, several elements (air, water, earth) merge to manifest the dynamic flux of the universe. \\"Breathing\\" is the character Colombet looks for in a work. Colombet never stopped drawing, as a vital exercise of hand and mind and as a record like notes for the fiction she would unfold on canvas. Each of Colombet's paintings is the result of a long process that starts with the choice of the linen she handpicks in Spain or France. Colombet makes her own primer and grinds her own pigments. \\"Her paintings‚Ä¶ work both as pure abstraction and as studies of nature. They can manage to seem resolutely nonobjective while conveying the weight of a study of mountains or stone. In fact, her philosophy of form can be said to occupy a point where abstraction and nature meet. Colombet‚Äôs singular vision juggles the opposition of representation and abstraction. The notable intelligence of her art is, indeed, based upon an objective, nearly scholarly research into the relations between the two. Vicky Colombet extends our knowledge of art‚Äôs ability to communicate effects that are inherently mysterious but truly compelling as things to see.‚Äù  Biography  Recipient of the Adolph & Esther Gottlieb Foundation award in 2001, the Pollok-Krasner Foundation grant in 2014. Vicky Colombet is a member of the Elizabeth Foundation for the Arts studio program since 2004. Her work has been exhibited extensively on both sides of the Atlantic and is in a number of important private collections in the US and in Europe. Notably, her two first solo shows in the United States were at Haim Chanin Fine Arts in New York and Evo Gallery in Santa Fe, both reviewed in Art in America. From 2005 to 2012, she collaborated with the Spanish architect to create a monumental glass work (150x 12 feet) inside the Villa Nurbs. From 2012 to 2015 she had several group shows at Bernard Jacobson gallery. In 2016 she was in a three-person show at the Museum of Fine Arts at St Petersburg, FL. The Albright-Knox Art Gallery purchased one of her large painting \\"Antarctica\\" series the same year.

In 1974, Henry was a recipient of a Rockefeller Fellowship in Museum Education at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  Career and Artistic Contributions  Janet Henry's artistic work spans multiple mediums: collage and text-based work, jewelry, and sculpture/installations using multimedia materials. Her work often comments on American culture, including white male patriarchy, by making use of toys, dolls, and miniatures in her art installations.Dyer, Susan Y. \\"'... she is talking unruly curls not peppercorns ...': Susan Y.

In the 1980s, she was known for creating and photographing necklaces and bracelets that featured sequences of materials. In partnership with filmmaker Linda Goode Bryant, Henry produced Black Currant, a magazine which highlighted the experimental work of artists who were showcased by Just Above Midtown Gallery (JAM). The magazine was later known as B Culture and featured early works of Greg Tate. In the 1970s, Henry also worked in the Education Department at the Studio Museum in Harlem, where she collaborated with artist Carrie Mae Weems. Janet is a funder and educator contributing at the New York State Council on the Arts, Jamaica Center for Arts and Learning, Lower Eastside Girls Club, and currently works at the Brooklyn Heights Montessori School.  Activism  Janet Henry was vocally opposed to the exhibition The Nigger Drawings by Donald Newman at Artists Space and refused to show her own work in that gallery because of this show title. The exhibition was widely protested for the racism of this exhibition name by artists including Carl Andre, Howardena Pindell, May Stevens, and Lucy Lippard who saw this incident as a key indicator of the systemic racism within the art world. Henry was also outspoken about the implicit racism of Women's Action Committee.

From 1925 through 1946 she was the third president of Sweet Briar College. She was also president of the Association of American Colleges and the American Association of University Women for several years.  Early life  Meta Glass was born in 1880 in Petersburg, Virginia to newspaperman and former Confederate Major Robert Henry Glass and his second wife, Meta Sanford Glass.  Education  Glass received an MA from Randolph-Macon Woman's College in Lynchburg, Virginia in 1899. She also studied at Cornell University in 1903. She earned a PhD degree in classics from Columbia University in 1913, although she had known no Greek before beginning that program. Between 1929 and 1946 she received eight honorary doctorates as well. Career =Teaching career= Upon graduating from Randolph-Macon Woman's College, Glass taught for a year at the Wytheville female seminary, then taught a year at a similar institution in Mt. Sterling, Kentucky, and then taught German for a year at her alma mater Randolph-Macon Woman's College.Stohlman p. 157. She also taught Latin for four years at Roanoke High School. She was then an instructor at Randolph-Macon Women's College for three years. She knew about the newly formed Sweet Briar College, but was told in 1906 that no positions were open. Shortly before completing her PhD at Columbia she gained a position as adjunct professor of Latin at Randolph-Macon Women's College in 1912. As the U.S. entered World War I in 1917, Glass traveled to France on behalf of the Lynchburg Y.W.C.A. as its secretary, and then trained nurses and assisted with the war effort. She remained in France after the war's end and in Paris she trained European women in social work. For her work in France, she was awarded the Medal of French Gratitude. Upon returning to the U.S., she assisted the director of Columbia University's adult-education University Extension, and taught Latin and Greek as an assistant professor at the university itself. While at Columbia, she declined an invitation from Sweet Briar's second president, Emilie McVea, to become that college's dean, although she ultimately succeeded McVea as president when ill health forced McVea to retire. =Sweet Briar College president= Glass became the third President of Sweet Briar College on November 13, 1925, in a ceremony at which Bryn Mawr's Marion Park gave the principal address and Randolph-Macon Women's College president D. R. Anderson delivered greetings from Virginia's colleges. During her 21-year presidency, Glass introduced interdepartmental majors and established the honors program. The library grew from 11,000 volumes to 62,000 volumes. In 1958, 12 years after her retirement, the college's board noted that during her tenure, among many other things, \\"Sweet Briar College became nationally recognized for academic excellence. ... The faculty was increased from 38 to 55 members ‚Äì scholarly men and women drawn from the best colleges and universities in this country and abroad. [She instituted] comprehensive examinations, and the Junior Year at St. Andrews and in Paris, [and] such new major offerings as Music, Art, and Religion. The Daisy Williams Gymnasium [and] the Book Shop ... were also added to the campus. ...\\"\\"Meta Glass 1880‚Äì1967\\". Sweet Briar College Alumnae Magazine. Sweet Briar College. Spring 1967. As her term started, Sweet Briar had small endowment of $132,947 (and building indebtedness which exceeded it by $97,000), so she began a fundraising drive. While the Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools of the Southern States had accredited Sweet Briar under her predecessor, it was on a conditional list because its endowment did not reach the $500,000 minimum (excluding real estate), even before the stock market crash of 1929. Despite limiting some building projects, in her first five years as President, she secured funds for a new library from private benefactors as well as the Carnegie Foundation, secured alumni support to build a gymnasium, and rebuilt the original manor, Sweet Briar House, after a fire. As the Great Depression began, Sweet Briar received the most applications in its history, which some attributed to its tuition being lower than older and larger women's colleges.Stohlman p. 171 However, that required additional dormitory space and scholarships, and ultimately increased fees. Also, 1932 became the only year during her presidency in which the budget ran a (slight) deficit. Glass had been elected to Sweet Briar's Board of Overseers in 1929, and in 1934 also secured alumnae representation on the board. Although the college's debt appeared near retirement by 1932, that took several additional years. Glass was president of the Association of American Colleges for many years. From 1933 through 1937, she was also president of the American Association of University Women. She achieved international recognition for speaking out against Nazi suppression of intellectual freedom.Stohlman p. 176. In 1940, Sweet Briar received an endowment for the Carter Glass Chair of Government (named after her half- brother, a U.S. Senators who had secured the college's original charter and served on its board), in part through the work of Dabney S. Lancaster, executive secretary to the Board of Overseers, who left to become Virginia's Superintendent of Public Instruction shortly before America entered World War II. Glass also assisted in that war effort, as did many Sweet Briar students. During her tenure she managed to build not only the college's reputation and student body, but also increased its endowment to nearly $1 million by her retirement in 1946.Stohlman p. 193 Glass had announced her pending retirement at age 65 in 1944, but agreed to stay on until her successor was selected. Martha Lucas Pate was inaugurated Sweet Briar's fourth president on November 1, 1946. =After Sweet Briar= Despite her retirement, she then served on the federal Loyalty Review Board, based in Washington, D.C., and traveled to hearings throughout the country until 1953. She was an active Democrat, and also was an actress in local theater productions in Charlottesville. At age 74, she interrupted her retirement to serve as temporary principal of Stuart Hall School in Staunton, Virginia after Nan Powell Hodges broke her hip and asked for emergency assistance.Stohlman pp. 196-7  Personal life  Glass spent her final years in a nursing home in Charlottesville, Virginia. In 1967, Glass died in Charlottesville, Virginia at the age of 86. Glass is buried with other family members in Lynchburg's Spring Hill Cemetery. = Legacy = Sweet Briar College named a residence hall, Meta Hall Resident Hall, in her honor. It is located in Virginia.

She frequently works on large wood panels covered in multiple layers of plaster which are manipulated and completed with fresco paintings.  Work  As a multidisciplinary artist, Olivia works across various media including printmaking, painting, fresco, digital and graphic design, and audiovisual and sculptural installation. Olivia's work revolves around a number of interrelated issues important for a number underrepresented communities that all connect back to her own identity and life experience under the labeled categories of: \\"Female, Black, Gay, etc.\\" The press release for Olivia's 2010 solo exhibition Thrice Removed at Spacetaker ARC Gallery in Houston, Texas, characterizes the show as: > A play on the phrase ‚Äútwice removed‚Äù denoting familial relations through a > system of ‚Äúremovals,‚Äù Olivia re-contextualizes this terminology to imply > separation from African traditions and customs, male authority, and > heterosexual privilege in this new solo show.

Her exhibition, influenced by recorded conversations, video > footage, folklore, and ancestral documents, redefines these selves outside > conventional depictions in a celebration of identity. In these four sentences alone, readers are made away of a number of hinge- points for Olivia's work: the ways in which privilege, power, and tradition are shaped and overwritten by monolithic discourses of race, sex, and class. In Thrice Removed, working against the potential to flatten or reduce underrepresented identities, Olivia complicates and expands identity through numerous media and \\"documents\\" that emphasize the \\"truth\\" of such identity, and yet she also allows space for the discomfort, tensions, and contradictions inherent to such a kind of \\"hybridized presence.\\" Painting and carving into plaster and pigment, Olivia's \\"contemporary frescoes\\" for this exhibition marked a departure in her work to that point.

Both teams compete in the Eastern Conference, but Boston plays in the Atlantic Division and Philadelphia plays in the Metropolitan Division. The two teams have been rivals since the Flyers inception in the 1967 expansion, but was most intense in the 1970s when the two teams met in four playoff series, including the 1974 Stanley Cup Finals, with the Flyers beating the heavily favored Bruins. The rivalry was renewed in the 2010s with both teams meeting in the playoffs for two consecutive years, including a 2010 series, with the Flyers overcoming a 3 games to none deficit to win the series. Historically, both franchises are renowned for their toughness and brawling ways, with the Bruins famously nicknamed the Big Bad Bruins, and the Flyers also famously nicknamed the Broad Street Bullies. As of November 2018, Boston is one of only five franchises with a winning overall record against Philadelphia (the Anaheim Ducks, Columbus Blue Jackets, Montreal Canadiens, and San Jose Sharks are the other four). 1970s: Big Bad Bruins Vs. Broad Street Bullies The rivalry took off when the two teams met in the 1974 Stanley Cup Final. Both the Bruins and Flyers were the class of the league, with Boston finish first overall with 113 points while Philadelphia finish second with 112 points, one point behind the Bruins. The Flyers, however, played a more grittier, defensive minded style. The Flyers also led the NHL by amassing 1,750 penalty minutes, which was 603 more minutes than the second most penalized club. The Bruins dominated the rivalry early, amassing a 20‚Äì4‚Äì4 record against the Flyers since they entered the league, thus making the Flyers huge underdogs entering the final. The Bruins won game 1 at Boston Garden with Bobby Orr scoring a goal with 22 seconds left in the third period of a tie game. In game 2, the Bruins took an early lead, but the Flyers forced overtime late, and Bobby Clarke won it in overtime, sending the series back to Philadelphia tied 1‚Äì1. Clarke's overtime goal proved to be the turning point in the series. The Flyers won the next two games at The Spectrum to take a 3‚Äì1 series lead and put Boston on the brink. However, the Bruins soundedly beat the Flyers 5‚Äì1 back in Boston Garden. Bruins coach Bep Guidolin described the Flyers as \\"out-muscled, out-skated, and out-hustled\\" by the Bruins. The game was a battle as there were a combined 43 penalties, a playoff record, with Flyers legendary enforcer Dave \\"The Hammer\\" Schultz averaging a fight per period. With game 6 back in Philadelphia, the Flyers brought out their good luck charm in Kate Smith, as she sang \\"God Bless America\\" to a raucous Spectrum crowd. Smith was considered the Flyers good luck charm, as the Flyers were 36‚Äì3‚Äì1 when she sang. Flyers center Rick MacLeish deflected a power play goal to take a 1‚Äì0 lead, and that was all that Flyers goalie (and eventual Conn Smythe Trophy winner) Bernie Parent needed, as he stopped all 30 shots the Bruins threw at him. The Flyers completed the upset by winning the Stanley Cup in six games. The Bruins and Flyers played in three consecutive semifinals in 1976, 1977, and 1978. The Flyers defeated the Bruins 4‚Äì1 in 1976, but the Bruins took the next two semifinal series. The Flyers and Bruins during these years lost the Stanley Cup to the Montreal Canadiens. In the 1979‚Äì80 season, the Flyers were on a mission to set sports' all-time unbeaten streak, and must to beat the Bruins in the Garden to break the record held by the Montreal Canadiens at 28 games. Despite the Bruins being geared up, the Flyers dominated the Bruins to win 5‚Äì2 and break the record. The Flyers went unbeaten for 35 games, a record that has yet to be broken. 21st century Legends Bobby Orr and Bobby Clarke at the ceremonial puck drop prior to the 2010 NHL Winter Classic. Although both teams remained competitive during the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, the Bruins and Flyers did not meet again in the playoffs until 2010 Eastern Conference Semi Finals. Prior to the playoff match-up, the two teams squared off in the 2010 Winter Classic at Fenway Park in Boston. The Bruins won 2‚Äì1 in overtime on a goal by Bruins forward Marco Sturm. In Game 1 in the series, the Flyers gave up the first goal less than three minutes into the game and left the first period down 2‚Äì0. However, the Flyers would rally and tie the game at 4‚Äì4 in the second half of the third period on goals by Mike Richards and Daniel Briere. However, this would only set up the heroics of Bruins forward Marc Savard, who had returned from missing several weeks with a concussion. Savard's overtime goal gave the Bruins a 1‚Äì0 series lead. Game 2 was eerily similar to game one, as the Bruins caught the early lead 5:12 into the game and while the Flyers were able to catch up twice, they could not take the lead and a goal by Milan Lucic with less than three minutes to go in the game spelled victory for the Bruins. In game three, the Flyers were finally able to take an early lead themselves, with forward Arron Asham scoring only 2:32 into the game. The lead did not last long though, as Bruins forwards Blake Wheeler and Miroslav Satan answered in quick succession, 1:34 apart and less than two minutes after Asham's goal, to take the lead. The Flyers were unable to score again and with a lackluster third period by Philadelphia, the game ended in a 4‚Äì1 Bruins victory. During the game Mike Richards broke the arm of Bruins center David Krejci in a large open ice hit, knocking Krejci out for the rest of the series. On the brink of a quick elimination, Flyers star Simon Gagne returned for Game 4, which turned into a bizarre mirror version of the first game of the series. After the Flyers took a big 3‚Äì1 lead, they saw it melt away on a few bizarre goals. With the Flyers leading late, Bruins forward (and former Flyers superstar) Mark Recchi tied it with 20 seconds left in the game. However, Gagne put an end to it scoring at 14:40 in overtime to keep the Flyers alive and send the series back to Boston. In game five, the Flyers stunned the Bruins by dominating and shutting out the Bruins for a 4‚Äì0 victory to climb back into the series. However, the shutout was not held by a single goalie, as Brian Boucher went down with injuries in both of his knees after Flyers defenseman Ryan Parent and Bruins forward Miroslav Satan fell on top of him. This called Michael Leighton back into action, who had only just returned at that very game from a high-ankle sprain that had sidelined him since mid- March. Leighton stayed sharp in game 6, as the Flyers held on for a 2‚Äì1 win, almost improbably sending the series back to Boston for a game 7. Game 7 played out very much like the series itself. The Bruins jumped to a 3‚Äì0 lead in the first period. Two of the goals came on the power play due to infractions for high-sticking on Scott Hartnell and Daniel Briere, respectively. This prompted head coach Peter Laviolette to use up his timeout to rally the team. Shortly after, James van Riemsdyk, who had not registered a goal in the playoffs until that point, scored to make it 3‚Äì1. The second period was all Flyers, as Hartnell and Briere redeemed themselves by scoring a goal each to tie the game up at 3‚Äì3. Overall, the game was relatively low on penalties, with only six minors being called total, but the last one of those, a bench penalty for Too Many Men, came to haunt Boston, as Simon Gagne put the puck in the net for a 4‚Äì3 Flyers lead. The Flyers was able to hold on to it and become only the third team in NHL history, the fourth team in the big four American professional sports leagues, to comeback from an 0‚Äì3 deficit of games to win that playoff series. The Flyers played in the 2010 Stanley Cup Finals, falling to the Chicago Blackhawks 4 games to 2. The two teams met again in the 2011 Stanley Cup playoffs. The Bruins had revenge on their mind and delivered it with force by sweeping the Flyers to advance to their first Eastern Conference Final since 1992. The Bruins then defeated the Tampa Bay Lightning in seven games to advance to the 2011 Stanley Cup Final, where they won their first Stanley Cup since 1972.

During this period the persecution of Bangla population by Pakistan army led by General A.K. Niazi was notable. It is believed this was on account of the contempt the dominant Punjabi Pakistanis had for of Bengalis, there was mounting evidence that among the Bengalis, the Hindu minority was doubly marked out for persecution. In a post war enquiry several senior Pakistani officers admitted to systematic targeting of the community on the orders from a brigadier which General Niazi had denied. \\"Bangladesh will reach out to UN seeking recognition of 1971 genocide while the government declared March 25 as genocide day\\", according to Liberation War Affairs Minister AKM Mozammel Huq.

Byzantine silver was prized in both the secular and domestic realms. Aristocratic homes had silver dining ware, and in churches silver was used for crosses, liturgical vessels such as the patens and chalices required for every Eucharist. Silver was also used as a medium in pagan mythological scenes and objects such as the Sevso Treasure. Silver pieces, especially silverware, continued to be rendered in the classical style into the seventh century. The frameSilver items were also controlled stamped, sometimes up to five times on a single piece, many such pieces are dated between the fourth and eighth centuries. During the reign of Heraclius (r. 610-41 AD), the production of silverware halts, which coincides with the State confiscating valuable metals to help replenish the treasury during the Persian War. Silver items began to regularly buried, such as the Stuma Treasure of 56 objects found in Syria during 1908, dated between 540 and 640 and attributed to the village church of St Sergios at Kaper Koraon. The Sion Treasure from Lycia consists of 71 pieces with 30 pieces stamped between 550 and 565 AD See Byzantine Coins for currency and monetary information.  Bowls  This bowl, which could have been used for hand washing or baptism. Walters Art Museum, Baltimore, Maryland. During the nineteenth century two silver bowls were discovered in Estonia that date to the late fifth or early sixth century period of which the Byzantine Emperor Anastasius I reigned 491-518 AD. The silver bowl deemed the ‚ÄúKriimani‚Äù bowl, for the location in which it was found, has a rim of 15.5 cm with a height of 9 cm. Two beaded bands border the rim of the bowl. Silver analysis shows 93-95% Silver, 3.5-5% Copper, and traces of Gold and Platinum. The second bowl, referred to as the ‚ÄúVarnja Bowl,‚Äù was discovered in 1895 near the village of Varnja. The Varnja bowl also has two beaded bands that circle the rim, and it is also stamped similar to the Kriimani bowl.  Crosses  Crosses were also lavishly adorned with precious materials and biblical scenes during the Byzantine period. Scholars refer to a cross called ‚ÄúThe Work of Mark,‚Äù due to the monks inscriptions on the cross. The cross is dated at late tenth or early eleventh century. This cross is 47 cm high, 26 cm wide, and very ornamented meaning it was probably used in processions. The iron core of the cross is encased in silver. Points projecting from the four arms of the cross would all have had small silver- gilt balls, which can be seen on other such crosses. Traces of gilding where the balls would have been provide further evidence. On one side across the central arm are three roundels forming a deesis, which shows Christ as a central figure holding a book of gospels in his left hand and blessing with his right. The Virgin Mary is shown bowing on Christ's left while St John the Baptist bows on his right The roundel on the top arm portrays the Archangel Michael, while the bottom roundel portrays a figure titled St Theodore. This side is heavily embossed with silver-gilt, and has a vine scroll and beaded border. The reverse side does not have such borders. The reverse has a black medium used in conjunction with the partial gilding of niello, which is an enamel type substance, in this case mixed with sulphur and silver. The roundels portray saints with the top of the cross showing the evangelist St John Theologos. The arm roundels show St Peter on the left and St Paul on the right. The fourth roundel shows St Basil in bishops robes. The middle of the scene has Virgin Mary and her child with a standing portrait of St Constantine above them decorated in his robe. The Virgin Mary has St Demetrius on the left, St Procopius on her right, and the last saint shown is St Nikitas. All saints are identified by the engraving of their names above them. An inscription of a semicircular area just 3 cm wide and embedded into the front of the cross, before the tang projects, reads ‚Äú‚ÄòThe work of the Faithful Mark‚Äô‚Äù Similar crosses are known of such as the cross of Adrianople. This cross has frontal images of Christ and the Virgin Mary, along with archangels Michael and Gabriel on the cross arms. The reverse side shows church fathers, and the donor‚Äôs name is inscribed as Sisinnios, which dates the cross to the final years of the tenth century. Another cross, in the Cleveland Museum of Art, is dated to the eleventh century due to its comparison of portraits with imperial portraits on coins and seal of that time. Distribution of silver-gilt relief decoration and niello are the same on both sides. Example of a plain silver cross that may at one time had images. Walters Art Museum.

Plates  Silver pieces, and especially plates, such as the Missorium of Theodosius I of 338 AD are engraved and styled similarly to the set of nine plates showing the Life of David stamped between 613 and 630 AD. The Kaiseraugst Achilles Plate has the closest similarity to the David Plates in regards to late antique silver. The Achilles Plate was buried with a large hoard of domestic silver during the fourth century inside the walls of the Rhine frontier fort of Agusta Rarica, which was discovered in the early 1960s. The Achiles Plate has the signature of Pausylyps of Thessalanike which places its manufacturing in the eastern Byzantine empire. This is reinforced with the similar control stamps on the David Plates. The large octagonal plate has decoration around its rim, and in the center a medallion shows a series of scenes of Achilles‚Äô life before the Trojan War. The Achilles Plate shows a narrative of eleven scenes on one plate. The David Plates and the Achilles Plate show a tradition of late antique silver working that produced many objects between the fourth and seventh centuries with scenes from traditional Grecco-Roman mythology. The David Plates and Achilles Plate are very decorative, and would have been used as show pieces. The silver plate of the David Plates collection that shows the meeting with Saul.

Avicularia urticans was brought into synonymy in 2017. It has been given the English name Amazonian pink toe spider. Under the synonym Avicularia urticans, it is also known as the Peruvian pinktoe tarantula. It is a large mygalomorph spider, with a maximum body length over and the longest fully extended leg about . Like other species in the genus Avicularia, specimens under this name are sold as pets, although their identity has not been confirmed by taxonomic studies. Description The adult female Avicularia juruensis has a carapace about 19 mm long and 17 wide, and an abdomen about 24 mm long and 17 mm wide. The adult male has a smaller body, with a carapace about 15 mm long and wide, and notably shorter and narrower abdomen, about 17 mm long and 12 mm wide. The fourth leg is slightly longer than the first, both being longer than the middle two. The first leg was measured as 53 mm in a female and 56 mm in a male, the fourth leg as 58 mm in a female and 60 mm in a male. The eyes are arranged in two rows of four, the front (anterior) row being slightly curved forwards and the back (posterior) row slightly curved backwards. The abdomen carries type II urticating hairs (setae), up to about 1 mm long in males and 0.7 mm long in females. The mature female has two long, well separated spermathecae, expanded in the middle to about 1.5 times the width of the end portions. The mature male has a globous palpal bulb with a small subtegulum and a well developed protrusion on the tegulum. The embolus forming the tip of the palpal bulb is about 5 mm long. The forward facing side (prolateral) of the first leg has an unbranched protrusion (apophysis) on the tibia. As with other species of Avicularia, juveniles have distinctively different colour patterns to adults. Juveniles of A. juruensis lack any kind of metallic sheen, have black tarsi contrasting with the rest of the leg which is lighter, and also have a reddish upper surface to the abdomen with a central longitudinal black stripe and separated transverse black stripes. Adults lose the stripes on the abdomen and gain a metallic sheen. There are two colour forms or \\"morphotypes\\". Morphotype 1 has a golden and pink sheen, a whitish carapace and whitish leg rings and longer light brown hairs evenly distributed over shorter darker hairs. Males appear to lack whitish tips to the hairs on the upper surface of the abdomen. Morphotype 2 has an intense purple sheen and yellower leg rings. Females have long reddish brown hairs on the front and sides of the upper abdomen over shorter darker hairs. Males have white-tipped hairs evenly distributed on the upper abdomen. Morphotype 1 is more commonly found in Brazil, morphotype 2 in Ecuador and Peru, but this is not an absolute difference. Morphotype 1 is the form previously known as A. urticans. Avicularia juruensis female morphotype 1 ZK122.jpgFemale, morphotype 1 Avicularia juruensis juvenile morphotype 2 ZK118.jpgJuvenile, morphotype 2 Avicularia juruensis immature morphotype 2 ZK117.jpgImmature, mophotype 2 Taxonomy Avicularia juruensis was first described by C√¢ndido Firmino de Mello-Leit√£o in 1923, based on specimens from Juru√° in Brazil. The specific name is based on the location in which the species was found. In 1994, Gunter Schmidt separately described Avicularia urticans, based on specimens from Peru. In 2017, Caroline Fukushima and Rog√©rio Bertani synonymized the two, saying that A. urticans was indistinguishable from A. juruensis, although there were some differences in colour. The name A. juruensis has been misapplied to specimens of Avicularia rufa from the Brazilian states of Mato Grosso and Rond√¥nia, south of the area in which A. jurensis is considered to occur. Apart from differences in the male and female genitalia, A. juruensis has paler leg rings, more uniformly coloured hairs (setae) on the legs, and legs I and IV more-or-less equal in length, whereas A. rufa has bright yellow leg rings, leg hairs with a whitish apex, and leg I shorter than leg IV. Behaviour Detailed studies of the life-cycle and habits of most Avicularia species have been described as \\"practically nonexistent\\". An adult female Avicularia juruensis was seen on the side of a palm tree feeding on a greater sac-winged bat (Saccopteryx bilineata). In Peru, the species has been known to swim across large rivers. Distribution and habitat Avicularia juruensis is found in central South America, in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Brazil, where it is found in the states of states of Amazonas, Acre and Par√°. Like other members of the genus, it is arboreal, building silken retreats.

Goodloe has contended that participation in these spaces represents a form of activism. Goodloe created the website repository Lesbian.org between 1994-1995 to both provide a platform for lesbians and to demonstrate their increasing presence online.

According to the Independent, he is considered to have been at \\"the vanguard of the influx of Indian artists to Britain.\\" Early life  Lancelot Ribeiro was born in 1933 in Bombay, India to accountant Joao Jos√© Fernando Flores Ribeiro and his mother Lilia. He was the half-brother of artist F.N. Souza. Ribeiro moved to London in 1950, living with his brother and studying accountancy. He abandoned this career when attending life classes at St Martin's School of Art between 1951 and 1953. He served in the RAF in Scotland, then returned to Bombay. After working with Life Insurance Corporation, he began working professionally as a painter in 1958. Career Ribeiro's creative life spanned half a century, during which time he became known for a \\"huge body\\" of figurative and abstract work. From 1951 until 1953, he joined art classes at Saint Martin's School of Art, London. In 1958, he began painting professionally. 1960 saw him organize his first solo exhibition, Bombay Art Society Salon. It was soon sold out. Five other exhibitions followed this in Bombay (Mumbai), New Delhi and Calcutta (Kolkata). 1961 saw his first solo art exhibition at the Bombay Artist Aid Centre. It was included among the Ten Indian Painters exhibition., and was given an extensive tour of India, Europe, US and Canada. He also received a commission for a 12-foot mural for the Tata Iron and Steel Company. He returned to London with his wife in 1962. There he received a grant from the Congress for Cultural Freedom in Paris. He held mixed shows at Piccadilly, Rawinsky, John Whibley and Crane Kalman galleries in London and Galerie Lambert, Paris. He received an All India Gold Medal nomination. 1963 saw him co-found the Indian Painters‚Äô Collective. In the 1960s and 1970s he held both solo and group shows. Ribeiro lectured on Indian art and culture at Commonwealth Institute. A retrospective covering his 1960s work was held in 1986 at Leicestershire Museum and Art Gallery. In 1987 his work was displayed at Camden Arts Centre. In 1998, his work was displayed at LTG Gallery, New Delhi. He displayed one painting at British Art Fair, 2010 after a long absence. Ribeiro died in 2010 in London. In 2013 there was a retrospective exhibition at Asia House, London in May‚ÄìJune. An exhibition was scheduled for New Delhi in November. In November 2016, as part of the 2017 UK-India Year of Culture, the exhibition Ribeiro: A Celebration of Life, Love and Passion was held in association with the British Museum and other institutions. Style of art Ribeiro's creative life spanned half a century, during which time he became known for a \\"huge body\\" of figurative and abstract work. Among his artistic productions were portrait heads, still lifes, landscapes, and pigment experiments dating back to the early 1960s which \\"lead to works of peculiar brilliance and transparency.\\" It is suggested that Ribeiro had a hand in completing some of his brother Souza's art works. Ellen Von Weigand wrote that \\"Souza's success and resulting social life meant that he frequently left works unfinished. Ribeiro would complete them, using the painter's harsh, aggressive strokes to form his church spires, iconographic heads and anti-naturalistic still-lives. His brother would then return to add his hasty signature to the finished piece.\\" =Role of acrylics= In a longish obituary, The Times of London acknowledges Ribeiro's role as an \\"[a]cclaimed Indian artist who pioneered the use of acrylics in the 1960s, producing a brilliancy of colour in his expressionistic works\\". The paper talks of Ribeiro's \\"increasing impatience\\" by the 1960s over the time it took for oils to dry, as also its \\"lack of brilliance in its colour potential.\\" He took to the new synthetic plastic bases that commercial paints were beginning to use, and soon got help from manufacturers like ICI, Courtaulds and Geigy. The companies supplied him samples of their latest paints in quantities that he was using three decades later, according to the paper. Initially, the firms thought the PVA compounds would not be needed in commercially viable quantities. But they quickly recognised the potential demand and \\"so Ribeiro became the godfather of generations of artists using acrylics as an alternative to oils.\\" =Reception= The British mainstream media has said: See also *List of alumni of Saint Martin's School of Art References Further reading *Lance Ribeiro, in The Times of London *Lancelot Ribeiro: Vanguard Indian Painter of Post War Britain *Grosvenor Gallery: Lancelot Ribeiro *The British Museum:Special event.

The history of the identification of the Indo-Pacific sweepers is complex and this species has been identified as the \\"Pempheris vanicolensis\\" which has colonised the Mediterranean Sea from the Red Sea via the Suez Canal by Lessepsian migration but this identification is not universally accepted. Description Pempheris mangula has a lateral line consisting of 49-60 pored scales with 4.5-5.5 scale rows above lateral line; 14-18, normally 16, scales around the caudal peduncle. Only the tip of the dorsal fin is blackish. The very large eye has a diameter which is equal to 13.0-15.3% of the standard length and 43.6-51.5% of the head length. The deep body is 44.6-49.1% of the standard length in depth. The flans are usually marked with irregular faint longitudinal light stripes. It also has 6 spines and 9-10 soft rays in the dorsal fin while the anal fin has 3 spines and 34-42 soft rays. It has a count of 25 vertebrae. Distribution Pempheris mangula has been said to have a wide Indo-Pacific distribution from the eastern coast of Africa and Madagascar to the north western coast of Australia as far south as New South Wales, but being absent from the South China Sea and the Malay Archipelago. It is also been claimed to be the species of sweeper which has colonised the eastern Mediterranean from the Red Sea via the Suez Canal but see Taxonomy section below. In the Mediterranean it was first recorded in 1979 off Lebanon. It has reached as far as the coast of Libya and the Aegean Sea. Biology Pempheris mangula is normally a solitary species which spends the day in caves or under overhangs in coral reefs. It is a nocturnal species which feeds on zooplankton in open waters at night. The spawning season of this species is shorter in the Mediterranean, where it lasts from April to September, whereas spawning is year round in the Red Sea. They prey mainly on the larval and adult stages of planktonic crustaceans. They depart from their daytime shelters at dusk and congregate nearby before moving inshore where they disperse into small groups to feed. Prior to sunrise, they reassemble near the entrance to their shelter, so they can go in it at first light, once the school has sufficient numbers. Taxonomy There is some debate around the true limits of Pempheris mangula and originally the sweepers which were identified as Lessepsian migrants in the Mediterranean Sea were identified as P. vanicolensis but then it was proposed that that species does not occur in the Red Sea, P. mangula was then stated to be the Red Sea species which had colonised the Mediterranean. Other workers have stated that P. mangula is an eastern Indian Ocean species, found no further west than the east coast of India and that the Red Sea members of the genus Permpheris are P. flavicycla, P. rhomboidea and P. tominagai, and that the Mediterranean invader is P. rhomboidea. Fishbase still treats P. rhomboidea as a synonym of P. mangula.

Macdonald (1849-1924) was an artistic bookbinder from Scotland, active in the 1890s and the early 20th century. She was known for her study of old binding techniques, determining how book bindings were created in the medieval era and duplicating the methods used. She was born Ann Smith Johnston in Lanark, on 20 November 1849, to Lucy Leitch and Fred Johnston. She was raised in Lanark and Glasgow, and in 1880 married William Rae Macdonald, an Edinburgh actuary. The Macdonalds' circle of friends in Edinburgh included art critic John Miller Gray and Phoebe Anna Traquair. Macdonald and Gray began \\"searching out and enjoying old bindings in libraries,\\" and this pastime led to an interest in trying the art of bookbinding for themselves. Walter Biggar Blaikie, another friend of the Macdonalds, allowed Annie Macdonald to practice in the workroom of the A. & T. Constable printing firm. There, she honed her skills and worked with the Edinburgh Social Union, of which she was a member, to institute a series of bookbinding classes led by employees of the Constable firm. Out of her practice in the Constable workroom, Annie Macdonald developed a method of embossing a leather binding which she would use throughout her career. Working on a goatskin binding that had already been attached to a book, she would dampen the leather, trace a design on to the surface, and work the design in relief using a Dresden tool. She became a leading member in a group of Edinburgh women binders (including Jessie MacGibbon, Mrs. Douglas MacLagan, Jean Pagin, and Phoebe Anna Traquair). Her medievalist bindings began to gain attention, and were selected along with others from her Edinburgh group for display in the Victorian Era Exhibition at Earl's Court in 1897. There, they attracted attention of Frank Karslake, a bookseller, who was inspired to host an exhibition of women's bookbindings at his London bookstore. Karslake offered to act as a sales agent for several women binders, including Macdonald, who was excited to have an outlet for her bindings in London. Macdonald was later loosely associated with Karslake's venture, the Guild of Women Binders, until its dissolution in 1904, although she only sold a few of her bindings through it. Annie S. Macdonald died in Edinburgh on 21 October 1924. References Bookbinders 1849 births 1924 deaths ","title":"Annie S.

Williams initially planned it to be \\"a synth pop record without any nostalgia,\\" and this plan turned into an ambient album about the feeling of being able to go to limitless places due to technology. In achieving this feel, Williams used the visual programming language Max for Live to create a virtual instrument that scrolled through 100 patches at random; when a note was inputed, the instrument froze at a patch. The record's overall sound palette is a combination of organic and non-organic elements; when using software instruments that replicated real-life instruments, such as clarinets and marimbas, Williams wanted to take advantage of the ‚Äúquirks and glitches within them\\" that lead to the instruments making sounds that they could not possibly make if performed acoustically. Motion Graphics was released by the Domino Recording Company on August 26, 2016. Three singles and music videos were released from Motion Graphics: \\"Lenses\\", \\"Anyware\\", and \\"Houzzfunction\\". Culture Sport, a digital visual artist, was responsible for creating the album artwork and videos. Motion Graphics garnered generally favorable reviews from music journalists, with common praises including the album's unique sound design. Concept According to Joe Williams, the final concept of Motion Graphics was realized rather than first planned out. His initial plan was \\"to make a synth pop record without any nostalgia\\" influenced by the works of Japanese technopop acts such as Yellow Magic Orchestra. In fact, Motion Graphics is similar to Yellow Magic Orchestra's music, as well as the works of Ryuichi Sakamoto or Kraftwerk, in that it is a response to modern commercial technology by \\"turning it into pop music\\" as Angus Finlayson described.Finlayson, Angus (August 30, 2016). \\"Motion Graphics ‚Äì Motion Graphics\\".

It wasn't until Williams made \\"Anyware\\" while riding on an Amtrak to Grand Central Terminal that he figured out the overall concept of Motion Graphics, where he made a marimba MIDI sequence for the song that sounded like a ringtone.D. Mcdermott, Patrick (August 5, 2016). \\"Motion Graphics's \\"Anyware\\" Video Is Probably From The Future\\" . The Fader. Retrieved March 11, 2017. The more experimental songs on the album are instrumental, while cuts with vocals from Williams are more on the pop music side. Described by Max Pearl as \\"both eerily familiar and totally otherworldly,\\" Motion Graphics regards the free feeling of accessing unlimited places due to technology, which is symbolized by the record's use of virtual instruments. Finlayson called Motion Graphics a happier version of the works he co-produced with producer Matthew Papich, known by his stage name as Co La, which was also a response to modern internet culture; the album's happy mood is showcased in the Sakamoto-inspired chord structures of tracks like \\"Lense\\", \\"Houzzfunction\\" and \\"Mezzotint Gliss\\" as well as the calm tenor vocals sung by Williams.

Pitchfork. Conde Nast.

In labeling the overall style of Motion Graphics, Joe Muggs of Bandcamp Daily wrote that it has hi-hat sounds similar to modern hip hop music, a \\"smash-and-grab attitude to sound-sources\\" common in grime, the tension of most movie soundtracks, and indie rock vocals, as well as elements of the works of Timbaland.Muggs, Joe (September 8, 2016). \\"Motion Graphics‚Äô Debut Points to a Bright Future for American Electronic Music\\". Bandcamp Daily. Retrieved March 8, 2017. Reviewer Chris Ingalls compared the album's combination of organic and non-human elements into the overall sound structure to the works of Icelandic artist Bj√∂rk and the use of the sounds to that of the Fairlight CMI music of Peter Gabriel. Journalist Paul Simpson called it a more pop-influenced version of the works of James Ferraro and Oneohtrix Point Never, acts which have also used virtual MIDI instruments to create post-modern recordings. He also compared the album to the works of CFCF, dubstep producer Slava and R&B; artist Autre Ne Veut. Sherburne characterized the sounds on Motion Graphics as \\"often an avatar for something else.\\" Examples include hi-hats that signify modern hip-hop music andclarinets and Claude Debussy-influenced MIDI riffs that remind the listener of classical music. Its combination of minimalist classical music and hip-hop elements serve as a symbol for the album's notion of going through limitless internet places.Sherburne, Phillip (December 8, 2016). \\"The 20 Best Electronic Albums of 2016\\". Pitchfork. Conde Nast. Retrieved March 7, 2017. Sherburne compared ‚ÄúAnyware‚Äù to the album Music for 18 Musicians (1978) by Steve Reich, while he compared ‚ÄúForecast‚Äù to the works of Astor Piazzolla. Elements of footwork and jazz music are also present.\\"Motion Graphics' debut album channels the information overload of 2016\\". Hyponik. Retrieved March 8, 2017. Sound design Similar to the works of John Cage, algorithms were used to create sped-up MIDI arpeggios as \\"random data\\" on Motion Graphics. The rhythmic structures of each song borrow from popular music genres; \\"Anyware\\" consists of rhythms influenced by juke music, and \\"City Links\\" features elements of 1980s synthpop works. However, as journalist Colin Joyce wrote, \\"the movements are fast and flickering‚Äîa shuttering collision of sounds and styles that feels like it was generated from the disembodied guts of a rogue central processing unit.\\" Motion Graphics was produced with the digital audio workstation Ableton Live.Joyce, Colin (August 24, 2016). \\"Motion Graphics Explores the Ecstasy and Agony of Our Relationship to Technology\\".

In the application, Williams programmed a plug-in in the visual programming language Max for Live that went through 100 instrument sounds at random, and when a note is played, the plug-in freezes at an instrument it is choosing at that time the note is being pushed; this leads to very different sounds being played at a rapid rate that represent the speed of garnering articles and data most news aggregators have. As Williams explained the random aspect of the record's structure: One way of inputting MIDI data into the Max for Live plug- in was through actual recorded audio. For example, the closing track of Motion Graphics, \\"SoftBank Arcade (Swiftcode Version)\\", plays MIDI notes that are inputted by hits from a free jazz drum recording.Durston, Tom (September 5, 2016). \\"Motion Graphics: Avoiding Sentimentality and Nostalgia\\". Inverted Audio. Retrieved March 11, 2017. Categorized by Pearl as an \\"uncanny pop hybrid of human and computer music,\\" Motion Graphics has a sound that is very clear and high-quality.Pearl, Max (September 13, 2016). \\"Breaking Through: Motion Graphics\\". Resident Advisor. Retrieved March 6, 2017. Driven by wild drum rhythms, all of the songs have lead melodies that are performed by hyperreal computer program replications of acoustic sounds such as clarinets, choirs, accordions, tympanis, harps and marimbas; crystal-like synthesizer sounds similar to alert messaging sounds, sound effects of birds singing and water, and Williams' downplayed vocals are also present. A sound module was also used to create guitar strumming sounds similar to error message sound effects. In using hyper-real computer programs that try to reproduce real-life instruments, he noticed \\"quirks and glitches within them,\\" such as samples that go out of the range an actual instrument can handle, and Williams took advantage of those quirks in order to make the instrument sounds more unique to listen to. In \\"Airdrop\\", vox, saxophone and kantele sounds are played together and sped-up to create a pitch wheel'd sound similar to dolphin noises. Vocals and lyrics In regards to vocals, Williams explained, \\"I'll start a track and it will get to a point where there's a heavy implication that some kind of vocal would complete the track.\\" Journalist Aurora Mitchell wrote that Motion Graphics was unique from most synthpop records in that it had calm singing that actually complimented otherwise very loud sounds. As Sherburne described the lyrical content Williams sings on Motion Graphics, they \\"weave sticky semantic webs that join the natural world with its digital analog.\\" The lyrics are about how someone provides new electric wiring in order to connect together real-life objects and visioning such as leaves, windows and bird vision screens. On \\"Minecraft Mosaic\\", he sings \\"Heaven sent the GUI\\", while on \\"City Links\\", he sings \\"Links accelerate/Rendering a time zone/Moving in a mobile home.\\" As Sherburne analyzed, \\"it seems likely those arenn't double-wides he‚Äôs talking about, but rather our own peripatetic second homes, as we scuttle about like hyperconnected hermit crabs living out of our phones.\\"  Singles and music videos  On July 13, 2016, it was announced Motion Graphics was to be released on August 26, 2016 by British indie label Domino Recording Company,Minsker, Evan (July 13, 2016). \\"Motion Graphics (White Williams) Announces New Album, Shares New Video: Watch\\".

Career  Fewer was elected to the San Francisco Board of Education in 2008, and served there for eight years. She was elected president of the school board in 2014. From 2001 to 2009, Fewer served as a director for Coleman Advocates for Children and Youth. Fewer was elected as the District 1 representative of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in November 2016, replacing supervisor Eric Mar who had reached his term limit. She was sworn in on January 8, 2017, becoming the first female supervisor of the Richmond district. Her election created a female majority on the Board of Supervisors for the first time in 20 years. On November 5, 2019, at an election night party for then-candidate for district attorney Chesa Boudin, Fewer led the crowd in a chant of \\"fuck the POA\\", referring to the San Francisco Police Officers Association. SFPOA president Tony Montoya called for Fewer to apologize, calling her words \\"worrisome and completely unacceptable and unbecoming of someone elected to represent all San Franciscans.\\"Sernoffsky, Evan (October 6, 2019) \\"SF supervisor leads anti-police union ‚ÄòF‚Äî the POA‚Äô chant at DA election party.\\" San Francisco Chronicle. (Retrieved November 6, 2019.) In an open letter, Fewer apologized to SFPD officers but not the SFPOA, whose leadership she described as having \\"a long and sordid history of opposing police reforms, publishing explicitly racist and anti-immigrant rhetoric, and directly threatening their critics, including my colleagues on the Board of Supervisors, myself and my husband, and its own members.\\" Fewer's claim that the SFPOA leadership threatened her were later substantiated when Mission Local published an email in which former POA President Gary Delagnes threatened to release the disciplinary records of Fewer's husband, a retired SFPD officer. Delagnes doubled down on his threat in the article, telling Mission Local editor Joe Eskenazi that \\"you can tell Sandra the next time she opens her mouth, I'm going to release John's record.\\" Fewer authored the People Over Profits ordinance, which prohibits the city from profiting off of communication services such as phone calls and price markups within the jail commissary. The measure is built off of London Breed and Vicki Hennessy's efforts in June 2019 calling for similar reduction in fines. It was unanimously passed by the Board in July 2020.

Early life  True was born in 1900 in St. Louis. Although both parents were classical musicians, True herself exhibited her innate talent in the visual arts rather than the musical field. She began her college education at Butler University's College of Education, but chose to complete her studies at the John Herron Art Institute, now known as the Herron School of Art and Design, in Indianapolis, Indiana. At the time, Indianapolis had an active arts community, which included noted artists, such as William Merritt Chase, Frank Duveneck and the renowned New Mexico printmaker, Gustave Baumann. True's education at the Herron was followed by a one-year scholarship to the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. True first visited the Southwest in 1928, when she and several friends from the Herron Institute took a road trip through Northern New Mexico. They traveled down the High Road from Taos into the Rio Grande Valley and Santa Fe. Her response to the culture and landscape of New Mexico was intense: \\"Might I preserve on canvas my thrill and deep feeling of the grand things of nature I have beheld today.\\" Reception In 1929, True accepted a position in the Fine Arts Department of the University of Colorado in Boulder. In 1931, she exhibited for the first time at the New Mexico Museum of Art. The Santa Fe New Mexican published positive reviews that same year of her work in a group exhibition for \\"non-Modernists\\", and again in 1932 for a solo show: \\"paints with a boldness and strength of purpose that leads one to think of a man's work.\\" Building on her success, True joined with fellow artists to embrace Regionalism, an artistic school of thought that placed great value on a sense of place and community. Calling themselves The Prospectors, the group of five participated in exhibitions around the country, where True was judged to be the most accomplished artist. Often featuring manmade structures in the landscape, True's watercolors and oil paintings demonstrate her keen powers of observation and artistic ability, and her appreciation for the natural environment is evident. Later life In 1935, True recognized that she could go no further at the University of Colorado with a simple Bachelor of Arts, so she began a Master of Arts program at Cornell University. By the time she completed her studies, however, the University of Colorado had no position for her, so she stayed in the East and began teaching at Cornell. There she was commissioned to paint a mural \\"The History of Home Economics\\" in 1937 and eventually became the chairman of the Department of Housing and Design. She spent the rest of her life in the East, retiring to Cape Cod where she taught art for several years and continued to paint and exhibit. Virginia True's perception of the artist's life is amply demonstrated by her comment that \\"to be an artist is a very upsetting thing, because you must come to grips with what you really think and what is really basic and what is truly you.\\" References 1900 births 1989 deaths Cornell University alumni Cornell University faculty University of Colorado Boulder faculty Herron School of Art and Design alumni 20th-century American painters American women painters 20th-century American women artists ","title":"Virginia True"},{"id":"53454352","text":"Mykola Kniazhytskyi (born June 2, 1968 in Lviv) is a Ukrainian journalist, People's Deputy of Ukraine of the VII and VIII and current IV convocations, Head of the Committee on Culture and Spirituality, Co-Head of group for interparliamentary relations with the Republic of Poland, Head of EU-Ukraine Parliamentary Association Committee.

PUA believes that the lack of an airport in Gaza infringes on the human right of Gaza citizens to move freely, as well as negatively impacts the economic development and safety of citizens of the region, and that a UN-operated airport can alleviate these issues while ensuring the security of Israel. Background =Organization= PUA was founded in 2015 by Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib, an American humanitarian activist who left Gaza in 2005 as a U.S. State Department-sponsored exchange student and was not able to return due to border closure and political instability. =Rationale for the cause= According to a United Nations Conference on Trade and Development report, restrictions on the movement of people and goods in Gaza have dampened the economic potential of the region and endanger the lives of people in need of medical services abroad. The UN estimates that by 2020, the Gaza strip may become uninhabitable unless trade and travel restrictions in the region are lifted. Alkhatib founded PUA because he believes that the lack of an airport in Gaza violates the human rights of Gaza citizens to travel freely, and that a UN-operated airport could improve the economy of the area and help Gaza citizens travel more safely, while continuing to maintain the security of Israel and Egypt. United Nations C-130 delivering food to Sudan History of air travel in Gaza Gaza's first and only international airport, Yasser Arafat International Airport, began operating in 1998. It hosted Palestinian Airlines and served up to half a million Palestinians a year. During the Second Intifada, restrictions were placed on Palestinians traveling into and out of the area. Between 2000 and 2002, the airport was shut down, bombed in a series of Israeli air attacks, and then bulldozed. The Israeli government claimed the destruction of the airport was justified due to concerns over its use to smuggle arms into the area. It also considered the airport's operations to have violated the terms of the Interim Agreement, which stipulated that Israeli and Palestinian forces were to cooperate on airport operations and maintaining safety. Precedent for UN airport operations PUA believes there is historical precedent for a UN-operated airport in Gaza. An airport in Gaza was operated and managed by the UN Emergency Force (UNEF) during the 1950s and 60s. Currently, the United Nations Humanitarian Air Service provides passenger and cargo air services to remote locations that are hazardous or lack local transportation infrastructure. UNHAS serves the World Food Programme and other non- governmental organizations. PUA objectives United Nations Antonov AN-74 operating in Sudan The objective of PUA is to identify a proposal for, encourage implementation of, and provide ongoing support for a humanitarian airport in Gaza. =Proposed airport implementation= PUA sees the proposed airport being implemented in one of two ways: either by expanding UNHAS or by establishing a new UN agency, along with support from private aviation and security firms, to operate and manage the airport. Location PUA believes that due to various factors, the location of Yasser Arafat International Airport was not ideal. PUA's plan calls for considering a new location away from Egyptian and Israeli borders. It has identified a site on the southwestern coast of Gaza, near the Mediterranean Sea, that it believes to be a suitable location for an airport. This location also takes into account the political and geographic changes in the area since the creation of Yasser Arafat International Airport. Construction and operation PUA proposes for the new airport to be established in phases, with the first phase consisting of constructing the essential facilities needed to operate an airport. PUA estimates that this would cost anywhere from $200 to $500 million, and with adequate political, material, and technical support, could be accomplished in 12 to 18 months. PUA believes that the Palestinian Authority could assist with passport and visa control, and that the United Nations could guarantee Israel‚Äôs security, ensuring that the facility is used only by civilians and preventing smuggling. Reception United Nations DC-9 In 2016, Israel's Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman expressed Israel‚Äôs willingness to approve the establishment of an airport and a seaport, if Gaza halted aggressive actions. Nickolay Mladenov, the U.N.‚Äôs Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, responded that while the creation of an airport was important, it was less of a concern than other, more pressing issues faced by Palestinians. In response, Alkhatib noted that ‚Äúthe airport is actually a core component of the reconstruction process‚Äù that will bring medical supplies, provide economic opportunity, and address other critical issues in the region. According to PUA, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has provided preliminary approval of the concept and plan for the airport, and employees of relevant UN agencies operating in Gaza have also expressed approval, albeit privately due to the sensitivity of the issue. Hamas has also indicated approval of the airport, canceling plans to build a housing settlement on the area of land where PUA has proposed to build the airport.

Two versions exist, in Swedish and German. The opera is based on the story, \\"Aladdin's Magic Lamp\\" from One Thousand and One Nights. It was first performed on 18 March 1941 at the Royal Swedish Opera, Stockholm.  Original idea  The idea for the composition was born in August 1936 when the composer met the librettists in Garmisch. The libretto was largely finished when Atterberg began composing the piano score on 15 July 1937. On 24 August 1940 the piano score was finalized and Atterberg started with the orchestration, which he completed on 28 January 1941. However, the overture was only written later for the German premiere. Together with his wife, Atterberg translated the German original of the libretto into Swedish. As Welleminsky was Jewish, it was not possible for him to be named by the publisher as a librettist. The composing took so long because Atterberg had a heavy workload, involving conducting and other tasks, but also because of the outbreak of the Second World War.Christian Steinbock und Stieg Jacobson: ... dass alle H√∂rer gefesselt werden, in: Programmheft, Staatstheater Braunschweig, 2017, S. 14‚Äì20.  History of performances  Ruth Moberg as princess Laila in the original 1941 production. The premiere of Aladdin took place in 1941 at the Royal Swedish Opera of Stockholm in Swedish and was conducted by S. A. Axelson.Aladdin, review at musirony.de, accessed 29 January 2017. Several members of the Swedish royal house were attending the performance, including the king Gustaf V of Sweden. Atterberg was satisfied with the production, except for the dances. However, the opera was not the success they hoped for and was put on only eleven times. The first act of the world premiere was broadcast by the Swedish Broadcasting Service, and was recorded on an acetate disk.Fr√•n urpremi√§ren p√• Kurt Atterbergs sagoopera Aladdin, Svensk Mediedatabas, accessed 4 Augusti 2018 Together with a 1968 recording of the overture, this remained the only recording of the opera until 2017 (see below). Einar Andersson (Aladdin), Ruth Moberg (Laila), Jo√´l Berglund (Muluk), Bj√∂rn Forsell, Arne Wir√©n, Leon Bj√∂rker and Folke Johnson performed in the world premiere. The German premiere took place on 18 October 1941 at the Theater Chemnitz.Karl-Josef Kutsch, Leo Riemens: Gro√ües S√§ngerlexikon, vol. 4, 4. edition, de Gruyter, 2004 Although the artistic director ecstatically stated: \\"Applause broke out right after the overture and increased from scene to scene, culminating in a standing ovation. I believe in the lasting success of this work.\\",Aladin, Staatstheater Braunschweig, accessed 11 March 2017 the success was modest and there were no performances ever since.Erik Levi: \\"Opera in the Nazi period\\" in: John London (ed.): Theatre under the Nazis. Manchester University Press, 2000, pp. 136‚Äì186.Norddeutscher Rundfunk: \\"Aladin: Premiere f√ºr eine vergessene Oper\\", accessed 11 March 2017 On 11 March 2017, only the third performance worldwide was staged at the Staatstheater Braunschweig under the musical supervision of Jonas Alber, which was broadcast via Deutschlandfunk KulturDeutschlandradio Kultur: \\"Schleierhaft sch√∂n\\", accessed 11 March 2017 and was received with excitement by the critics.Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung: \\"Der Staat endet, und das Gl√ºck f√§ngt an\\", 13 March 2017. The leading roles were performed by Michael Ha (Aladdin), Solen Mainguene (Laila), Frank Blees (Nazzreddin), Selcuk Hakan Tirasoglu (beggar/Dschababirah) and Oleksandr Pushniak (Muluk). Due to political correctness the libretto differs from the original one in 1941 and places the plot in the presence, into a former central Asian Soviet Union.  Music  Since his first composition, Op. 1 from 1913, Atterberg had repeatedly tried to incorporate oriental motifs into his works, without lasting success. He adopted numerous ideas from those compositions for Aladdin.Christian Biskup: \\"Eine Welt voller kleiner Wunder\\" in: program booklet, Staatstheater Braunschweig, 2017, pp. 34‚Äì35. The opera employs a late-romantic-dramatic sound language. \\"The opera is dominated by a bright timbre, large melodic lines and sprinklings of oriental folklore\\". Some critics regard the opera as a \\"musical cross of the Orientalism in Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's operas together with string-movements and background choirs from American pop-songs\\". While Atterberg's symphonies are still performed, his operas, including Aladin, fell into oblivion.  Instruments  The opera's orchestra consisted of the following instruments: * Woodwind instruments: two flutes (with piccolo), two oboes (with cor anglais), two clarinets (with Eb clarinet and bass clarinet), two bassoons * Brass instruments: four French horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba * Timpani, drum kit (three players): oriental timpani, two triangles, tambourin, snare drum, bass drum, cymbal, tam-tam * Harp * Piano, celesta * Brass band: two oboes, two clarinets, three trumpets * Bowed strings: six violins 1, four violins 2, three violas, three celli, two double basses References Compositions by Kurt Atterberg Operas 1941 operas Swedish-language operas German-language operas Works based on Aladdin Music based on One Thousand and One Nights Operas based on fairy tales ","title":"Aladdin (opera)"},{"id":"53454471","text":"Mlemli Mosque Melmli Mosque (), is a Tunisian mosque located in the north of the medina of Tunis.

Her work has been exhibited in museums and galleries around the world, including the Studio Museum in Harlem and the California African American Museum in Los Angeles. Since the late 1960s, Jackson has dedicated her life to studio art with additional participation in theatre, teaching, arts administration, community life, and social activism. Jackson's oeuvre includes poetry, dance, theater, costume design, paintings (both two- and three-dimensional), prints, and drawings. Jackson has spent time throughout her career teaching students and influencing future generations of artists and culture creators, as well as building and participating in close-knit art communities with peer artists and thinkers. She worked in San Francisco through San Francisco State University with Bay Area artists and teachers including Charles White. She worked in Los Angeles during the 1960s-80s, founding Gallery 32, and exhibiting additional work at the Ankrum Gallery. During the 1980s she lived in Idyllwild, California teaching and creating art. She also worked at Yale University, and in New York and Philadelphia in the 1990s. She has worked in the Savannah, Georgia art community since 1996. Biography = Early life = Jackson was born in Saint Louis, Missouri and her family moved to San Francisco, California when she was nine months old. Jackson lived in San Francisco until she was eight years old, after which she was raised in the city of Fairbanks, Alaska from 1952 to 1961, graduating from Monroe High School in 1961. As a teenager in Alaska, she became a member of the National Audubon Society which influenced some of the content of her work from a young age. She was also the first African American to attend the National 4-H Congress in Chicago in 1960, which helped her receive scholarships and allowed her to attend college. She received the World Peace, Humane Society, and Kindness to Animals scholarship from The International Latham Foundation, the Banff School of Fine Arts Scholarship, the Standard Oil Scholarship, and National Home Study Art Course. = Education = Jackson moved to the Bay Area in 1961 to attend San Francisco State University, where she studied both art and ballet, eventually receiving a BA in painting. She later completed an MFA from the School of Drama, Yale University, in 1990, specializing in theater design. While at SFSU, Jackson installed exhibitions at the campus art gallery and taught art at Saint Stephen's School. = 1960s-1970s = After college Jackson toured South America with a modern dance company and later returned to California to settle in Echo Park. In 1968, she opened Gallery 32, which operated for two years and which Jackson funded herself. Jackson held several solo exhibitions during the 1970s at Ankrum Gallery, which was run by actress-turned-gallerist Joan Wheeler Ankrum and actor William Challee. Jackson produced artists books of poetry and painting, \\"What I Love\\" (1972) and \\"Animals\\" (1978). (see Poetry) > ‚ÄúWhen Bernie [Casey] brought to the gallery several of Suzanne‚Äôs paintings, > I was immediately struck with the freshness and originality of her work. It > is most unusual to find so young an artist with a valid philosophical > statement (and to communicate it successfully). Her feelings about her > blackness are expressed in somewhat symbolic terms, and her world of > fantasy, love and hope is revealed to the viewer in a very refreshing style‚Ä¶ > She very well may be the first Black woman in America to make a truly > important contribution to art.‚Äù -- Joan Ankrum (1/5/1974) = 1980s-1990s = In 1981, Jackson was first introduced to Savannah, Georgia, through an invitation to be a visiting artist with Savannah College of Art and Design through the recommendation of Bernie Casey. Additionally, in 1981, Jackson's work was included in the exhibition ‚ÄúForever Free: African American Women‚Äù which traveled to the Gibbes Museum of Art in Charleston, South Carolina. Jackson lived in Idyllwild, California, from 1981 to 1985 and was on faculty as a Visiting Artist at the Idyllwild School of Music and Arts (1981‚Äì82), and chair of the Fine and Performing Arts at the Elliott-Pope Preparatory School (formerly Desert Sun School) (1982‚Äì85). In 1987, Jackson relocated to New Haven, Connecticut to attend Yale University, pursuing a master's degree under the tutelage of Ming Cho Lee for scenography. She worked as a freelance scenic and costume designer moving throughout the region until taking a post at St. Mary's College of Maryland as a scenographer and assistant professor from 1994 to 1996. In 1996, Jackson moved full-time to Savannah, Georgia, to teach at Savannah College of Art and Design as professor of painting, where she taught full-time until 2009. = 2000s‚Äìpresent = Jackson officially retired from SCAD in 2009, but Jackson remained as a part- time and adjunct professor until 2013. Additionally, Jackson taught introductory art history courses, including African American Art History at Savannah State University in 2013‚Äì2014 school year. Jackson has remained an active member of the Savannah artistic community and continues to create and exhibit her work. Jackson co-hosts a weekly radio show featuring jazz and conversation, called Listen Hear on WHCJ 90.3 Savannah State University Radio, alongside Ike Carter, Jerome Meadows, Tom Van de Ven, Lisa Jackson and Carla Curran, PhD. In 2019 Jackson was the recipient of a Joan Mitchell Painters & Sculptors Grant. Artistic practice Suzanne Jackson has had an extensive career an emphasized the importance of living the lifestyle of an artist, in her words, to be an artist is to solve problems as opposed to create images. She states, ‚ÄúI'm not an artist yet. I'm a painter. And I draw, and I work in theater as an \\"artist person,\\" in quotes. But to become an artist takes a whole lifetime.‚Äù Throughout her career, Jackson has looked to nature for inspiration, she has consistently related blackness to nature. Her work has celebrated blackness through the representation of black bodies without an overtly political message. = Visual arts = Jackson has worked in a variety of visual media including works on paper, works on canvas, and Monoprints. Her works on paper include both watercolors and drawings from throughout her career. Jackson has worked mostly with acrylic paint, her earliest paintings on canvas were with acrylic paint layered, the way one would layer oils paints. She stated, ‚Äúthe imagery that everybody has sort of become familiar with, with the really strong white background and the sort of washy layers and layers of paint‚Äîthat basically is kind of an old masters technique of layering the color for translucency. It's like the layers and layers of color build a depth in the painting. And some of the paintings, as thin as the color looks, there could be a hundred and fifty layers of color on each of my paintings.‚Äù The 1990s marked a shift in her work as she began to experiment with different combinations of media. As her style progressed, Jackson began to forego the canvas in favor of netting as a substrate. She uses Novacolor's acrylic gels to create 3-dimensional hanging works held together by fabric, papers, found objects, leaves, and or various netting. (For images of Jackson's work, please visit her website http://www.suzannefjackson.net/) = Theater and costume design = Jackson graduated from Yale in 1990 and traveled the Northeast region (Connecticut, New York, and Philadelphia) as well as parts of California (Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay Area) working as a freelance Scenic and Costume Designer. Her costume designs were included in the exhibition Onstage: A Century of African American Stage Design, at the Library for the Performing Arts, Lincoln Center, New York. Among other regional theatre credits, Jackson's work includes: *BLUES ROOM, Realto Theatre, National Black Arts Festival, Atlanta, Georgia, originating from the Theatre of the First Amendment, George Mason University, Fairfax Virginia, 1997 *THE SNOW QUEEN, origin, The John F.

Following graduation from college, Jackson participated in a State Department musical theatre tour of South America with Music Theatre U.S.A., and upon returning, Jackson was an instructor of dance and art at Watts Towers Art Center in Los Angeles from 1968 to 1969. From 1982 to 1985, Jackson was the chair of the fine arts department of the Elliot‚ÄëPope Preparatory School, Idyllwild, California where she choreographed performances including Oliver!, Grease, and the Cosmic Festival. = Poetry = Jackson's poetry has been mentored by the Cave Canem Foundation, Lucille Clifton, St Mary's Women's Writing Group, and the International Women's Writing Guild. Jackson's published artist books featuring her poetry and paintings are ‚ÄúAnimal,‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat I Love.‚Äù Jackson's poetry and drawings are included in Cave Canem Anthologies; ‚Äúthe ringing ear: Black Poets Lean South,‚Äù 2007, I, II, and IV, 1996‚Äì99; Avatar 25, 1996; Potomac Review, Winter 1996; In the Valley of the Moon, International Women's Writing Guild, 1994. Several of her Artist Statements are written in verse: > MY ART DEALS WITH REALITY VERSUS FANTASY--- ALONENESS VERSUS LONLINESS‚Ä¶ WHAT > I PAINT ATTEMPTS TO EXPRESS THE CONFLICTS WITHIN THE MIND, CONFLICTS OF > CHOICES--- OF LOVES, ---OF SENSITIVITIES SEARCHING, ORDERING, ‚ÄúFREEING‚Äù > ONESELF TOWARD SOME CONTINUOUS CYCLE OF REDISCOVERING WHO, IN FACT, I MIGHT > REALLY BE. --Statement from Suzanne Jackson‚Äôs book, What I Love (1970)  Gallery 32  Many associate Jackson's name with Gallery 32, an art gallery she ran in MacArthur Park, Los Angeles from 1968 to 1970, dedicated to fostering a supportive artist community. Gallery 32 was inspired by artist Charles White's philosophy that art could be an effective vehicle for community activism and social change. Seeking to replicate Jackson's previous experiences of San Francisco bohemianism, Gallery 32 functioned less as a business than as a place for the exchange of ideas and philosophies. Jackson funded the gallery herself, largely with money she earned from teaching. The gallery became an important venue, hosting discussions, poetry readings, and fund-raisers for social causes, and exhibiting work that demonstrated strong political and civic engagement. She aimed to make art from black artists with black themes accessible for all members of the community. It quickly became one of the few art spaces in Los Angeles to exhibit emerging African American artists such as Gloria Bohanon, Emory Douglas, David Hammons, Betye Saar, and Timothy Washington. Among the organizations for which the gallery hosted fundraisers were the Black Arts Council, the Black Panther Party, and the Watts Towers Arts Center children's arts program. One of the gallery's important exhibitions was the 1970 Sapphire Show, the first Los Angeles survey of African American women artists. Gallery 32 played a vital role in the progressive struggles of the period while contributing to the diverse art scene of Los Angeles. The remaining artworks and ephemera have been promised to the Smithsonian Institution per the artist's request.

During this period, the occupation government retained Japan's rationing system, which was implemented during the war to preserve resources. The U.S. and Japanese officials were unable to allocate the food supply efficiently, which led to an extreme hunger crisis. This issue impacted U.S. foreign policy in East Asia, as American officials attempted to mediate the problem. Background Japanese internal food production declined by approximately 26% in the last two years of the Pacific War when the government prioritized resources, such as fertilizers and tools, towards the war effort. Consequently, farmers had fewer materials with which to produce food. In many cases, these commodities were destroyed through warfare, further depleting these already limited resources. Okumura Ayao, a Japanese food scholar, recalls the food crisis' impact in rural areas. He said: > From 1944 on, even in the countryside, the athletic grounds of local schools > were converted into sweet potato fields. And we ate every part of the sweet > potato plant, from the leaf to the tip of the root‚Ä¶For protein, we ate > beetles, beetle larvae, and other insects that we found at the roots of the > plants we picked, which we roasted or mashed. Even in the countryside, food > was scarce. This issue was compounded by the fact that Korea and Taiwan, Japan's former rice-producing colonies, were liberated at the end of the war. As a result, Japan had to depend entirely on its own yields. Poor weather led to mediocre harvests in 1944 and 1945. To make matters worse, the return of eight million expatriates from Japan's recently freed colonies added to the high demand for food. In 1940, the Japanese government established a food rationing system for items such as vegetables, sugar, seafood, dairy goods, and rice. Rations for adults included only 1.3 to 1.8 ounces of meat and 1.8 ounces of fish a day. By 1945, this amount was reduced to 1,793 calories daily due to further restrictions. These limited rations were especially problematic in cities that relied entirely on government rations, such as Tokyo, Nagoya, Kobe, Osaka, and Yokohama. People in provincial towns and cities who were not as dependent on the rationing system were relatively less affected, until the Allies bombed Japanese home islands in 1944. Farming families were mostly spared from hunger, since they produced their own food. However, most Japanese citizens bought food from the markets, which were contingent on the rationing system. In response, the Japanese government encouraged families to vacate cities for better conditions in the countryside. Parents sent their children to live with relatives. About 1,303,200 children were evacuated, 857,000 of which went to live with family, while the other 446,200 were taken in by Buddhist temples, inns, and local families. Nonetheless, relocation was minimally effective, since the children still received inadequate rations in the countryside. Since these rations were continuously reduced, the food shortage persisted. From 1943 to 1945, a child's total daily rations declined from 19.2 ounces to 14.4 ounces. A girl named Hashimoto Kumiko, who was relocated to a farm during the Pacific War, describes her experience of hunger in the book Food and War in Mid-Twentieth Century East Asia: > Day after day we ate watery gruel in the cottage of the farmhouse to which > we had been evacuated. Things got even worse, and our daily chore was to > gather field grasses. One day, I came across a book of Western cooking among > the few remaining items on the bookshelf. I turned the pages to shiny > photographs of roast beef, Spanish omelets, Scotch eggs. It became my secret > pastime to stare at the beautifully taken photos and read the book over and > over. I didn't care what the outcome of the war might be. I swore in my > heart that when the war was over, I would eat all these dishes. Looking back > on that time now, I smile ruefully that I was a hungry maiden with a big > appetite. The Japanese faced a power vacuum subsequent to their defeat in the Pacific War, which was further confounded by the U.S.' occupation. The U.S. originally sought to democratize Japan and progressively decrease the intervention of American troops over time. However, they instead chose to engage in the Reverse Course, which made the Japanese pliable to American headship in foreign trade and other affairs. The U.S. eventually hoped to convert Japan into a subsidiary, capitalist nation. The U.S. authorities upheld sanctions against outdoor food vending and preserved Japan's wartime food rationing system. Unfortunately, the Japanese and U.S. authorities were unable to properly regulate the trade, production, and allocation of food nationwide. A general decrease in global food production in 1945 and 1946 further added to this problem. The rations limited the average adult to 1,042 calories per day, which only constituted about 65% of the minimum caloric intake weighed necessary for basic survival. Rations were rarely delivered regularly, contributing to this problem. In some places, including Tokyo and Yokohama, rations were even cancelled. The average Tokyoite acquired only 70% of their allocated rations, which provided them with about 775 calories per day for a full six months in 1946. Responses =U.S. wheat donations= During the Occupation, the Communist Party took advantage of the hunger crisis by blaming the famine on the U.S.' maladministration in Japan. To subvert this propaganda and prevent the formation of a Communist Asia, the U.S. sent grain and troops to foil pro-communist protests. The Koreans, in the midst of famine themselves, raised similar complaints against their government. To avoid the expansion of Asian communism, the U.S. engaged in the Reverse course by dividing foodstuffs between these two countries, sometimes limiting aid in Japan to provide for a more restive Korea. In 1946, U.S. General Douglas MacArthur (who dictated matters in all other American-occupied areas in East Asia) sent a cable to General Dwight D. Eisenhower discussing this problem. In the cable, MacArthur said: > I am considering authorizing an immediate diversion from allocation of wheat > to Japan of a token shipment of twenty-five thousand tons to Korea to > alleviate a serious psychological and political crisis wherein adverse > leftist elements are capitalizing on the present food shortage. I am > convinced that failure to provide this token shipment at once will > constitute a serious threat to the United States Army Military Government in > Korea. =School lunches= In 1947, U.S. authorities established school lunch programs in Japan to provide nutrition for children in the larger cities affected by the food crisis. As a result, American charities and religious organizations developed the Licensed Agencies for Relief in Asia (LARA) to dispense food, clothing, and other aid to Japan. The school lunch programs were extended nationwide in Japan in 1951, with the intention of allotting 600 kilocalories and 25 grams of protein for each student. The lunches included a main course (usually warm) with a bread roll and a glass of milk. The bread was not donated because of its health benefits, but because Americans wanted to divest excess wheat to foreign markets to increase their profits. The milk meanwhile was chosen for its ability to quickly bolster underfed children. =Black market system= People took advantage of the hunger crisis by selling goods that were limited under the rationing system. Criminal gang members were especially known for engaging in the black market system. Many bartered ramen, which they made from the U.S.' increased wheat exports. (Ironically, ramen was inspired by the Chinese noodle soup chuka soba.) This food was crucial during the famine, since its noodles were filling and high in calories. The U.S. authorities tacitly overlooked the black market system by discounting the activity of large suppliers. Instead, George Solt, the author of The Untold History of Ramen, asserts that the government gave the appearance of opposing the black market by cracking down on individual vendors and consumers. Historian John Dower claims that 1.22 million average men and women were jailed for acquiring goods from the black market in 1946. This number escalated to 1.36 million in 1947, and again to 1.5 million in 1948. Solt raises the possibility that the police and government elites received a portion of the profits from the illegal food trade, which explains their motives for quietly accepting the black market. This point supports evidence that corrupt officials contributed goods to this trade. Food culture after the Occupation period A food amusement park, the Shin-Yokohama RƒÅmen Museum, was established in the Shin-Yokohama district of K≈çhoku-ku, Yokohama, Japan in 1994 and is largely dedicated to ramen. However, George Solt conveys that this monument has overstated the Japanese returnees' part in commercializing chuka soba, ignoring the Korean and Chinese laborers in Japan that vended chuka soba on the black market. More significantly, the museum disregards chuka soba as a Chinese creation, treating it as a Japanese specialty. Ramen was mentioned widely in films, radio, music, and television shows post-occupation. In the 1954 film Bangiku (which later became known as Late Chrysanthemums) a plot line features a woman who takes her mother to a ramen restaurant to celebrate the former's wedding engagement. While the daughter happily eats the ramen, the mother is horrified, as she thinks back to the days when ramen was eaten exclusively to ward off hunger. The idea of eating it in prosperous times mortifies the mother, a theme that is found in poems and music from this period, which were recited on the radio. One such poem (translated from Japanese) went: \\"Eating nothing but ramen on a date. With an empty wallet, yesterday and today. The tryst was most disappointing.\\" References Occupied Japan Japanese cuisine ","title":"Food in the Occupation of Japan"},{"id":"53454622","text":"Sidi Amor Mosque Sidi Amor Mosque (), also known as the Sidi Amor small mosque is a Tunisian mosque located in the south of the medina of Tunis.It is an official historical monument since November 16, 1928.http://www.docartis.com/Tunisia_Decreti/DECRETS/Pagine/1928_16novembre.html  Localization The mosque is located in 24 the Sidi Ali Azzouz Street.http://www.commune-tunis.gov.tn/publish/content/article.asp?ID=450  Etymology The mosque got its name from the saint Sidi Amor Al Batach who was born in La Marsa.

Found on his old footprint the current Szabads√°g t√©r.  History  For the order Emperor's Joseph II it designed by Isidore Canevale an architect Viennese. The construction of the building surrounded an immense rectangular courtyard in 1786 began under direction J√°nos Hild. His son J√≥zsef Hild, the future renowned architect won here his first professional experiences. The intended use of the building fortress was not known to the public in that way the subject was object of speculations. Large parts of the building made gradually; in 1789 the pavilion 3 was already in use. The construction was adjacent to the ground floor, had two floors with four smaller angles, but on the higher level rectangular buildings were built that were linked to the short side of the main building structures associated with it, rectangular so that life were towers; on its four corners of the wall of the building. The high-end 100 fathoms (cca. 183 m) over the main wall occupied almost 10,000 square-fathoms (3.35 ha). There was no particular architectural value of the building. The mysterious building was built in the middle of the desert, because also a large area spread between the houses and the former wing of the city began the building, which has not been cured with sand. After the death of Joseph II the work was not yet completed, and the outbreak of the Napoleonic wars in the meantime hindered the continuous construction. It was used as a prison between 1793 and 1796, with the captured French officers being held here. In 1802, the building was almost made to sell for Jews of Prague who had made an offer. Count Ferenc Sz√©chenyi the former spokesman of the Court has done against the planned sale, since the construction of the money received from Joseph II (assets of the Hungarian priesthood confiscated). The sale was not the case, however, the continuation of construction were captured in 1814, and when the building is finished, the barracks became to the newly organized Fifth Artillery Regiment.

Biography Schuster got her education at the Art Institute of Chicago, then later attended Boston Museum School along with Edmund C. Tarbell and Frank W. Benson. =Career= In 1914 she was a student at the William Merritt Chase Summer School of Art in Carmel-by-the- Sea, California. Despite the brutal murder of her fellow student Helena Wood Smith, she returned to Carmel in 1916 and sent her paintings to the Woman‚Äôs Exhibition at the Oakland Art Gallery. In 1923, Schuster built a studio-home in the hills of Griffith Park and joined the faculty of Otis Art Institute. She also had a second home and studio in Laguna Beach where she spent her summers. She returned as an exhibitor to the Oakland Art Gallery in 1924 when Director William Clapp organized a show of regional ‚ÄúImpressionists,‚Äù which was so successful that it was sent to the Los Angeles Museum. An online facsimile of the entire text of Vol. 1 is posted on the Traditional Fine Arts Organization website. Schuster expanded her horizons when she was able to join a painting tour through Belgium. She co-founded the California Art Club and Women Painters of the West She was a member of the Group of Eight, who considered themselves modernist in their use of rich color, expressive techniques, and an emphasis on the figure. She also was a great admirer of Claude Monet and, in fact, built a lily pond in her backyard that she used for a series of lily pond studies, not unlike those of Monet.

Qaunak Mikkigak (born November 15, 1932, also known as Qaunaq Mikkigak or Haunak Mikkigak) is an Inuk throat singer, storyteller, drawer, sculptor, jeweler and writer from Cape Dorset, Nunavut, Canada. She co-authored the children's books The Legend of the Fog and Grandmother Ptarmigan based on traditional Inuit stories. She was featured in the book Inuit women artists: voices from Cape Dorset for her artwork and in Cape Dorset Sculpture. She currently lives in Cape Dorset, Nunavut, Canada.  Family  Qaunak Mikkigak is the daughter of Mary Kudjuakjuk, a graphic artist, and Pitseolak. She has a younger brother and ties to four formerly adoptive siblings. She is the wife of Oqutaq Mikkigak (also transliterated as Ohotaq Mikkigak or Ohuqtaq Mikkigak), fellow drawer and sculptor. She has eight children, one of her own and seven adoptive children.  Early life  Born November 15, 1932 in the camp, Nuvujuak (also known as Nunavut). She has lived her entire life in the area of and around Cape Dorset. When Qaunak was a very young child (about 3 or 4) she was temporarily adopted by a family in another camp (reasons for this adoption are unknown). During this time she was mistreated and beaten by her adoptive parents. She found refuge with her eldest adopted brother and his wife, who would feed her when they were alone. After a visit from her father, she was later returned to her family in the spring. After being returned home Qaunak enjoyed learning the traditional Inuit ways of life from her mother Mary Kudjuakjuk. Mary couldn't move around a lot due to a heart condition and so Qaunak did most of the work, such as collecting firewood, fetching water, preparing seal blubber, emptying the qurvik, cleaning the igloo floor, and chewing and sewing skins to make the family's clothing. Qaunak's father died when she was about eight or ten years old. Later her mother remarried a man named Quppapik and moved to Churchill, Manitoba for employment. Qaunak remained behind to continue living in Nuvujuak.  Marriage  Qaunak married Ohotaq Mikkigak, and they lived the traditional Inuit lifestyle in Nuvujuak together. When Qaunak's mother and stepfather returned to Cape Dorset for Quppapik to become a custodian at the school, the Mikkigak family also moved into the settlement to enroll their two young children into the school. Later both she and her husband followed in Quppapik's footsteps and became employed as custodians. Both Qaunak and her husband produce their work for their own enjoyment, and Qaunak takes pride in helping to support her family.  Artistic biography  Before her father's death, Qaunak remembers watching him and the other men of Nuvujuak carving ivory and stone into small figures to sell to the Hudson's Bay Company. During this time she also began creating carvings of her own, but kept them hidden because only men were carving at the time. As such, she is considered one of the first Inuit women carvers. After her father's death she began to carve more openly. Qaunak started with making soapstone heads for dolls, later creating qulliit and then geese. She makes her carvings using an axe and file, never electric tools. Qaunak has created work in several mediums, including; jewelry, drawing, and sewing. She is best known for her naturalistic sculptures and carving. The themes and imagery present in her work include traditional folk tales, animals, angakuit (shamans), and other figures. Qaunak is quoted saying, Qaunak Mikkigak's work has been in many collections, shows, and galleries. These include: Prints in the annual Cape Dorset print collections, 1980, 1981, and 1986.

Education  Artist Porter Lara moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico as a young child in 1980, and later attended the University of Johannesburg, where she earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 2013. Porter Lara also learned pottery techniques from Graciela and Hector Gallegos in the village of Mata Ortiz in the northern state of Chihuahua, Mexico.  Work  Porter Lara uses techniques based on those that Mata Ortiz potters have used to create vessels in the region over 2,000 years ago. She harvests raw clay from the earth in central New Mexico, then processes it, by slaking, filtering, and drying it to a workable state. She builds the vessels with clay coils, burnishes the pieces with a polishing stone, then uses the reduction firing process in a backyard pit. Her inspiration for the black burnished vessels appeared on a trip with the Land Arts of the American West program to southeastern Arizona and northern Mexico. While hiking in the high desert, she recognized many discarded articles of immigrants who had crossed the border, including 2-liter plastic bottles, sometimes in burlap slings. Her work reflects on the necessity of water for human life and a concept that Porter Lara calls \\"reverse archeology.\\"  Selected exhibitions  Porter Lara's work was exhibited at the New Mexico Museum of Art in Santa Fe, New Mexico, as part of Alcoves 16/17. Peters Projects, a major gallery in Santa Fe, NM, presented a solo exhibition, In Situ, in 2017. She is represented by Peter Projects. Porter Lara also had a solo exhibition in 2017 at the National Museum of Women in the Arts called Border Crossing. Twenty-five pieces of Porter Lara's work were featured in the show with much of the work inspired by the plastic bottles and ancient pottery remnants (shards). The show explores questions about what classifies relics as well as the human tendency to catalog and classify. Each of the work's titles includes a series of numbers and letters that further identifies where Porter Lara sourced the clay and when she fired each piece. In 2019, Porter Lara was commissioned by Art in Embassies (AIE), a U.S. Department of State program, to create an installation of her sculptures for the Matamoros Consulate.

It had two comfortable side-by side seats in a glazed cabin. Though it had competition successes in 1924 and 1925, it did not go into production. Design and development The limousine, not an official name but that used by contemporaries who described it as a limousine de tourisme, was designed and built by Mathieu Demonty and Paul Poncelet of the Soci√©t√© Anonyme Belge de Constructions A√©ronautiques. Demonty did the overall design and calculations and Poncelet the detailed design and all the construction. It was an all-wood aircraft with a high, two-part, braced wing. The leading edge of each half- wing was straight and unswept over the inner half of the span where the chord increased outwards from the root, but the outer section was straight-tapered to squared tips. Each was built around two spars, with the leading edge plywood-covered to form a box girder with the forward spar. Aft, the wing was fabric covered. The outer wing sections carried ailerons, hinged obliquely so their chord increased strongly outwards. The wings were attached to the top of the fuselage and braced to the lower fuselage with streamlined, inverted V-struts to the spars from the fuselage sides. Folding the wings around a joint at the forward spar root for transport or storage reduced the width to and took less than five minutes. The limousine was originally powered by a four-cylinder, inverted, water-cooled engine, produced in 1913 by Gr√©goire, which drove a three-bladed propeller; both the propeller and the inverted engine were unusual at the time, though Gr√©goire had used this engine arrangement in his 1910 monoplane. The engine was cooled with a cylindrical Lamblin radiator mounted above the central wing, where the fuel tank was located. Behind the engine, its upper parts under a narrow cowling, the mahogany plywood-covered, elm-framed fuselage was rectangular in section but tadpole-shaped in profile, deep below the wing but slender aft. It also slimmed aft in plan, though not so strongly. Its enclosed, spacious cabin, which seated pilot and passenger side-by-side, was below the wing with Cellon windows angled to the line of flight on each side of the cowling, aided by side and roof windows. It also provided a space for baggage and for tools. There was a port side door for access. The limousine had a conventionally laid out empennage. It had no fixed tailplane but its balanced elevator, with a slightly swept leading edge and almost semi-circular, fabric-covered rear, was hinged at the extreme tail. The fin, built integral to the fuselage, was triangular and the fabric-covered rudder was rhomboidal, leaving a space below for elevator movement. Its landing gear was conventional, with its mainwheels on steel half-axles centrally hinged within the fuselage at its deepest part and with rubber shock absorbers on the fuselage underside, giving a track of . A sprung tailskid was mounted on an extension of the rear fuselage. Operational history The date of the limousine's first flight is not known but it was active by mid-June 1924, when it stood out at a Belgian event for touring aircraft. Piloted by V. Simonet, it gained second place overall. At the beginning of July it was one of thirteen small aircraft entered for the Tour de France des avionettes. Piloted by van Opstal, it was forced to withdraw on the Belgian leg when part of the cowling came away and destroyed the propeller. By the summer of 1925 the limousine had been re-engined with a Anzani six-cylinder air-cooled radial engine. It flew with this at the Vauville meeting for gliders and small aircraft and won first place overall in the latter category. It remained active at meetings until at least 1928, when it was a contestant at Reims. The name Cyrano, sometimes added to the makers name, was specific to the first aircraft, registered O-BAFL, which remained on the Belgian register until 1930. There may have been a second example; O-BAFV appeared in the register in 1926 as a SABCA Demonty-Poncelet 1 but, in the absence of photographs or definite contemporary comments on a second limousine, its type remains uncertain. Its registration was cancelled in 1933.

Tremble's work has been exhibited across Canada and internationally, and she is the 2013 recipient of Conseil des arts et des lettres du Qu√©bec (CALQ) award for best work in art and experimentation presented as part of the Rendez-vous du cin√©ma qu√©b√©cois. In 2014, her work was part of an exhibition at L‚ÄôOccurrence Gallery, with the exhibition themed around friendship. She had a 2015 show called La colonne bleue. Tremble was also one of several artists featured in the Push and Pull exhibition, which ran in October and November 2016. Another one of her works was La capacit√© du t√©lescope √† choisir parmi les mod√®les de l'univers. The work was on display at the Galerie B-312 during a one night event featuring contemporary art in Belgo. Her work was featured in the show Dead Web, which ran until early 2017. Her short 3D film titled BMP 37093 was part of the show. The filmed showed the death of a star and its subsequent transformation. At the Magog River, one of her video works was also displayed. This work was created with Philippe Hamelin for Espace [IM]M√©dia. The installation came about as a result of her work at the La colonne bleue show, where people inquired if she would be interested in doing outdoor installations.  Professional activities  Tremble has held coordinating positions in a variety of cultural organisations in Quebec and Ontario. In 2009, she was the director at Le Laboratoire D'art. Since 2015, she has headed Vid√©ographe, the Montreal-based artist-run centre focused on moving images. Vid√©ographe is an artist run non-profit.

With Vid√©ographe serving as the film's distributor, Tremble apologized for the offense caused by the film and said it had been removed from their archives. According to Tremble, this was done at the request of the artist and was not a form of censorship as a result. La Revue HB, a Quebec-based, internationally circulated, print magazine specializing in drawing, was co-founded by Tremble and Jonathan Demers in 2013. The magazine is co-published by six Canadian artist-run centres. The magazine publishes original illustrations by international artists.

The drink is primarily sold in the Middle East and North Africa. Due to the popularity of Barbican in the GCC, it has become a genericized trademark for non-alcoholic malt drinks. Due to the fruit and malt flavour of Barbican, it is sometimes used in the preparation of food, mocktails, desserts and as an accompaniment to cheese or chocolate. History Barbican was originally manufactured by U.K.-based Bass Brewery. Aujan Industries began importing the drink for sale in the Middle East in 1983. Alongside the Swiss-made Moussy, Barbican was the first non-alcoholic malt drink to be sold in the region. Manufacturing changes at Bass disrupted supplies of Barbican to Aujan, and in 1999, Aujan purchased the Barbican brand in select markets. Aujan acquired complete control of Barbican in 2010, and began manufacturing it at the company's factory in Dubai. Barbican accounted for 5% of Aujan's total sales in 2013. Barbican is sold in Malaysia. It is imported from Saudi Arabia and distributed by Coca-Cola Refreshments Malaysia. On 26 July 2011, Malaysia's National Fatwa Council declared that Barbican was \\"not processed to make it alcoholic, and contains low alcohol content which is not intoxicating.\\" The ruling declared Barbican to be halaal for consumption by Muslims. Production Barbican is manufactured at ACCBC's manufacturing plants in Dammam and Dubai. It is brewed using a three-stage process involving mashing, lautering and wort boiling. During mashing, the coarsely ground barley malt is subjected to hydration with water at different temperature-time regimes, which helps in a slow break down of starch molecules into simple carbohydrates, bringing in the balanced combination of carbohydrates and proteins. In the lautering stage, all the soluble solids from the barley malt are extracted avoiding harsh and astringent components from the barley malt husk, leaving behind wort. The extracted wort is boiled along with hops which adds a hoppy aroma and bitter taste to the malt extract. The malt extract is stabilized and sterilised during boiling.  Flavours  A bottle of pineapple-flavoured Barbican at a restaurant in Helsinki, Finland. Apart from the original malt beverage, Barbican is sold in 8 fruit flavoured variants. Barbican is sold in 330 ml glass bottles and cans. The Mango & Passion Fruit, and Pomegranate are only sold in glass bottles. * Malt * Peach * Raspberry * Strawberry * Grape * Pineapple * Mango & Passion Fruit * Apple * Pomegranate * Lemon Health effects A 2015 study conducted by the Hawler Medical University in Erbil, Iraq found that there was \\"no statistically significant increase in urinary uric acid before and after consumption of Barbican\\", but \\"urinary calcium significantly decreased after consumption.\\" Researchers noted that the decrease in calciuria only occurred among normal males who were habitual consumers of Barbican. The decrease is caused by the presence of barley.

She graduated magna cum laude from Barnard College with a BA degree in English in 1992. In 1994, she received her M.F.A. from Columbia University School of the Arts. Elsayed's mother is Armenian and her father is Egyptian. For three generations, her family had to move from continent to continent due to political and religious persecution. Career Elsayed uses the process of writing and image-making to create visual narratives through installation and painting. She draws inspiration from conceptual art, comics, cartography and landscape painting. In her work, Elsayed often overlaps maps from the past and the present with people and events, serving as records of internal and external geographies. Her interest in mapping stems from her family's history of migration. \\"Writing and painting are close processes for me and language is central to my work, both as formal element and subject matter. For over a decade, I have been making text and image based work that synthesizes an internal and external experience of place, connecting the ephemeral to the concrete.\\" ‚Äì Dahlia Elsayed Elsayed's psychological maps on paper read like ironic, self-deprecating versions of 19th-century phrenology busts.

He married Lana Starner on August 10, 1946. During World War II, Doyle served in the Army, working on the SIGSALY voice encryption system. Doyle's career began in 1949 as a cryptanalyst studying electronic key generators. He used mathematical notation to describe the motion of key generators and applied mathematical techniques to analyze them. In 1956, Doyle joined COMSEC Research and Development as a cryptomathematician. By 1961, he had risen to Chief of his division, a position he held until 1977, when he was named Senior Cryptographer. The division was responsible for designing the cryptographic algorithms used by the U.S. and its Allies to protect classified information and the U.S. Nuclear Command and Control System. Doyle designed the cryptologics for major COMSEC systems used by the United States government for four decades. From the 1960s onward, most U.S. government COMSEC equipment used cryptologics that were either designed by Doyle or designed by others based on his research. He designed key management schemes that caused a huge decrease in the amount and cost of physically distributing key material. Personal life and death Doyle's personal life was marked by tragedy. He wed Lana Starner on August 10, 1946. She died on February 2, 2012. The couple had two daughters, Dr. Laurie Doyle and Mrs. Nancy Shields, both of whom predeceased their father. Mahlon E.

They combine elements of metal (death/metalcore) and traditional folk music.  History  = Formation and early years (2005‚Äì2012) = Ithilien was formed in 2005 by Pierre Ithilien in Brussels. The name of the band means \\"Country of the Moon\\" in Sindarin, language constructed by the writer J. R. R. Tolkien. However, none of the contents of the songs, concepts and themes of the albums are related to the universe of The Lord of the Rings. It was in 2011 that the band recorded its first official EP Tribute to the Fallen and the single \\"Endless Horizons\\". At that time, the style of the band was mainly melodic-death metal, although some folk aspects in the melodies were emerging. Thereafter other members joined the guitarist/singer Pierre (the only remaining original member) : Benjamin Delbar in 2011, Jerry Winkelmans, Olivier Bogaert and finally Geoffroy Dell'Aria in 2012 (which through its instruments brought the folk sounds that are characteristic to Ithilien today). At that moment, they had a solid team ready to compose their first album. = From Ashes to the Frozen Land (2012‚Äì2016) = It is in 2012 that Ithilien established a stable line-up allowing the band to start from scratch and keep only its original name. On December 9, 2013, they released their first album From Ashes to the Frozen Land, signed with the Danish label Mighty Music and distributed throw Europe with Target Group. The album is composed of songs that, one after the other, follows a storyline. The band describes this new opus as \\"One hour of a musical atmospheric journey of black, death and pagan metal describing all together a fantastic and epic story\\". This album evokes above all the strong emotions that men can feel during difficult moments, hereby addressing subjects such as loss, rebirth or perseverance. Ithilien distinguishes itself from other metal bands by the presence of real folk instruments on stage as well as their albums recordings, but also by what the musicians wear live, resolutely of Viking inspiration (armor of leather, skins of beasts, make-up warriors ...). Over time, other members were added such as Hugo Bailly to the bagpipes and Sabrina Gelin to the hurdy-gurdy, both in 2014. An even more privileged place is then made to the folkloric instruments within the band. After being selected as one of the winners of the Loud Circuit contest, the band had the opportunity to play at the Botanique in Brussels in 2013. Ithilien played more than 80 concerts worldwide, including tours with the Swiss folk metal band Eluveitie, in Europe and Japan, and the Icelandic Viking/folk metal band Sk√°lm√∂ld in Europe. = Shaping the Soul (2016‚Äìpresent) = Ithilien in July 2016 In March 2016, the band released the song \\"Edelweiss\\" and announced their next album, Shaping the Soul. This new release is accompanied with a new collaboration with the Italian label WormHoleDeath. In 2016, Olivier Bogaert and Geoffroy Dell'Aria left the band. The first official music video from the album, \\"Blindfolded\\", appeared on January 9, 2017, showing the new line-up, completed with violinist Myrna Mens and guitarist Tuur Soete. On February 17, 2017, Shaping the Soul was released in Europe followed by the other continents. Tour dates were then planned in various Belgian cities and abroad with the dutch folk metal act Heidevolk, but also with Ensiferum, Skyclad and many others. The concept of this new opus is about the grief process. \\"It is through loss and pain that our soul is being shaped.\\" According to Elisabeth K√ºbler-Ross, the mourning process is usually theorized in 5 stages: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. It is these steps that form the red line of Ithilien's album. Visually speaking, in 2016 the band abandoned the stage fantasy costumes to return to more conventional modern clothing.  Musical style  At the beginning, Ithilien offers an epic mix between black and death, all influenced by traditional folk Celtic, Nordic and Viking music. This combination led to melodic folk metal. It is in 2017, with the album Shaping the Soul, that the band evolves towards a style called \\"folkcore\\". It is a close combination of traditional folk music (played by Flemish bagpipes, hurdy-gurdy, tin and low whistles, violin, nykelharpa and bouzouki), and a more modern touch of metal using distorted vocals and heavy electric guitars riffs (death metal, metalcore).

Their practice involves various media including video, sound art, installations, and performance that are informed by autoethnography, an investigation of archival materials, and social intervention. In addition to being a practicing artist, Williams is a cultural writer. They have contributed to publications such as the Huffington Post and The Feminist Wire. Williams lives and works in New York City, New York.  Early life and education  Kiyan Williams was born in 1991 in Newark, New Jersey. Williams moved to California to attend Stanford University. Williams has focused on comparative studies in Race and Ethnicity, which they also focused on as a Gates Millennium Scholar recipient in 2009. In 2014, Williams moved to New York City to develop their performance Unearthing.  Performance work  Kiyan Williams works across multiple disciplines, including performance art. In addition to creating their own performance based works, they have collaborated with and participated in other artists performances pieces that deal with similar issues of Queerness. William's longest ongoing project is Unearthing, which began in 2014. In an interview in Paper magazine, Williams said that for them, \\"performance is a very useful way to understand power and identity.\\" = Unearthing = Unearthing: \\"Unearthing an ancient, genderqueer griot sits in a waist-high mound of dirt sourced from an unrecognized burial ground of enslaved Africans in New York City. The griot is both human and spirit; neither man or woman; of the past, present, and future. The audience witnesses the griot transform their body into an alter of protection for Black people ‚Äì living, deceased, and yet-to-be born. During this ritual performance, the griot covers themselves in dirt, glitter, paint, and rum while unearthing stories of Black queer resistance and liberation.\\" - Dixon Place Unearthing Performance Description. The performance begins with Williams entering into the performance space in a procession. Once at the stage area, which holds a large mound, they cover themselves in dirt and decorate the mound with flowers. Williams then begins to shout \\"why you always so dirty?\\" to the audience while covering their arms and legs in dirt, and then eating it. Williams covers their own body with paint and glitter, and comes out of the mound dancing in a style that is reminiscent of the Vogue style of dancing. = Additional works = In addition to Unearthing, Williams has created other performances such as Where Do The Poor Go (2016), The Pretty Nigga Bitch (Work in Progress), and Growing Pains. Where Do The Poor Go is a site-specific, public performance that investigates gentrification in the Bushwick and Harlem neighborhoods of New York City. They have also worked collaboratively with other artists such as Rashaad Newsome, Nia Witherspoon, and Ann Carlson. = Notes On Digging = A performative piece created in 2020 that encapsulates the uprisings against anti-Black and anti-Black trans violence and how connecting with the Earth helps them recover from racialized and gendered violence.  Writing  Kiyan Williams is a cultural writer and commentator who explores issues of reframing narratives around Black female sexuality. They have contributed pieces to the Huffington Post and The Feminist Wire. Additionally, Williams has spoken about the experience of being Black, Queer, and growing up poor.

Lewis was born Joan Angela Lewis in Oakland, California, to John Henry Lewis and Florence (Reid) Lewis.  Early life  Lewis grew up in Oakland, California during the 1950s and 1960s Civil Rights Movement. Oakland was a hub for civil unrest due to the high prevalence of police brutality, and the continued segregation of the city due to white flight out of the ‚ÄúFlatlands‚Äù and into the Foothills. Lewis studied at Oakland Tech, following in the steps of other Black Panther Party leaders such as Bobby Hutton and Reginald Forte. Before becoming involved in racial politics, her parents wanted her to pursue a Jazz career, as she was an accomplished violinist in high school. During high school she co-founded the Black Student Union and staged sit-ins to demand the implementation of a Black Studies course as well as black history club. Lewis drew her inspiration for these demands from student activists at Merritt College who were also demanding black studies courses. Lewis began visiting Merritt College with her cousins when she was 16 to attend forums on black history and culture. Here she came into contact with the founding members of the Black Panther Party, Bobby Seale and Huey Newton, and was inspired by their visions of black nationalism and radical cultural and community preservation. Lewis also came to be interested in the black panther party because of their Community Survival Programs they set up in high schools and community centers around Oakland. The community survival projects included programs like Free Breakfast for Children, Free Food Program, and Child Development Center.  Black Panther Party  In the spring of 1967, Lewis became the first woman to join the Black Panther Party, at the age of 16. She dropped out of high school and made the decision to put her jazz career on hold in order to help the movement. She quickly rose in the ranks of the party, completing political education classes mandated by the party, and training in weaponry. When male panthers questioned her abilities as a marksman because of her gender, Lewis challenged them to come to the range and see if they could match her straight shot. Lewis was later appointed as a local Lieutenant, and helped train new recruits and teach drill classes. Lewis continued her involvement in the Black Panther Party as one of the party's first revolutionary graphic artists, through her drawings and other artwork in The Black Panther (newspaper). Lewis contributed over forty images to the newspaper between 1967 and 1969 under the pen name \\"Matilaba\\". Most of the artwork that came out of the newspaper and the party itself is attributed to Emory Douglas, yet Lewis' drawings were prominently featured alongside his. Lewis worked as his assistant during her time spent in the part. Her work was easily identified by its thin pen strokes, and the light shading that outlined her usually militant female caricatures. Lewis' art usually represented common themes of the newspaper, including demonizations of the police as \\"pigs\\", as well as depictions of armed panthers, which reinforced Black Americans struggles against police brutality. What made her art stand out was its depictions of armed black women panthers rather than black men, a shift from the very masculine representation of militant self-defense usually pictured in the newspaper. Through both her artwork, as well as her involvement in training camps and police patrols, Lewis created a space for black women to embody the image of radical defenders of the community and culture. Lewis left the Black Panther Party in January 1969.  Art career  After leaving the party Lewis became a graphic artist and Jazz violinist, yet she continued to engage with issues of community development heralded by the Black panther Party. She toured internationally with saxophonist John Handy and went on to teach visual arts as well as Jazz to inner city youth. She also is the founder of the Oakland Black String Ensemble. When working with her visual art skills, Lewis acts as an Art Instructor/Counselor at the Healthy Babies Project, where she helps women use visual art to represent and understand trauma due to substance abuse. Lewis is also the author of Panther: A Pictorial History of the Black Panthers and the Story Behind the Film and also worked on the 1995 Panther movie with Mario Van Peebles. In the film she acted as a consultant, and even had a minor acting role. In 2001 she was awarded the Congressional Recognition Award for \\"Performing Artist and Recognition of Community Work\\".

The attack on Plered followed a series of rebel victory, notably in the Battle of Gegodog and the fall of most of Mataram's northern coast. The aged and sick King Amangkurat I and his sons offered an ineffective defense, and the rebel overran the capital on or around 28 June. The capital was plundered and its wealth taken to the rebel capital in Kediri. The loss of the capital led to the collapse of the Mataram government and the flight of the royal family. The king fled with his son the crown prince and a small retinue to Tegal and died there, passing the kingship to the crown prince, now titled Amangkurat II, without any army or treasury.  Background  = Progress of the Trunajaya rebellion = The Trunajaya rebellion began in 1674 as raids by the rebel forces against the cities of the Mataram Sultanate. In 1676, a rebel army of 9,000 invaded Java from their base in Madura. They routed a much larger royal army in the Battle of Gegodog in northeast Java (October 1676), took most of Java's north coast and campaigned successfully in the interior central and east Java. In the same year, the rebels arrived at Taji, the eastern entrance to the capital district, and was joined by the men of Raden Kajoran, Trunajaya's powerful father-in-law. The combined forces was defeated by loyalist forces led by Mataram's royal princes, but Kajoran escaped and joined Trunajaya. Despite the defeat, Kajoran continued to cause trouble for Mataram in districts east of the capital. In early 1677, the Dutch East India Company (VOC) in Batavia decided to ally itself with Mataram. A fleet led by Cornelis Speelman sailed to Trunajaya's capital in Surabaya in April, northeastern coast of Java, and took the city after hard fighting in May. Following the defeat, Trunajaya retreated inland, establishing a new capital in Kediri. = The court at Plered = Amangkurat I's father and predecessor Sultan Agung built an artificial lake in an area which became known as Plered, east of his court at Karta. In 1647, shortly after taking the throne, Amangkurat built his royal residence near the lake and moved the court there. In contrast to Karta, which was made of wood, the royal compound at Plered was built of brick. Amangkurat continued to expand this complex up to 1666.  Opposing forces  According to Jacob Couper, a VOC envoy to Mataram, in March 1677 the rule of King Amangkurat I was visibly collapsing. The king was ill and his four eldest sons, the crown prince (later Amangkurat II), Pangeran Puger (later Pakubuwana I), Pangeran Martasana and Pangeran Singasari were manoeuvring for power. The royal guards, as well as the guards of the princes were available for defending of the capital, but disunity among the four princes prevented an effective defense. Rebel forces in this sector consisted of Madurese troops, as well as Javanese forces from East Java and central northern coast. They were led by Raden Kajoran, the head of the important and powerful family in the area (Kajoran is in today's Magelang Regency). The Kajoran family was interrelated by marriage to the royal family, but he was alarmed at the king's brutality which had resulted in the death of many noblemen at court. Raden Kajoran was also the father-in-law of Trunajaya. The forces of Pangeran Purbaya, the king's cousin, also joined the rebels. The crown prince later identified the forces who overran Mataram to be from Madiun, Pati, Kudus and Grobogan and the men of Kajoran and Purbaya.  Capture of Plered  Kajoran renewed military operations in the capital district in April 1677. The accounts of the military operations are unclear, but in June royal forces, under command of King Amangkurat I's four eldest sons (the crown prince as well as Pangeran Puger, Pangeran Martasana and Pangeran Singasari) were defeated in battle after heavy fighting. The king himself was aged and grievously ill and unable to lead his troops. Superior rebel operations, and the lack of unity among the princes contributed to the rebel victory. In addition, the king's cousin Pangeran Purbaya, defected to the rebel side along with his followers, and the loyal princes were unable to rally their people to fight. The capital was now \\"beyond defending\\". Conflict arose between the crown prince and his brother Pangeran Puger. The king put Puger in charge of the defense of the capital, awarding him the title Susuhunan Ingalaga (\\"king on the field of battle\\"). Amid anarchy and panic, the king fled the court, in the middle of the night, possibly on or around 28 June, with a small retinue. Soon afterwards, rebel forces entered and sacked the court. The demoralized defenders under Puger soon fled. Rebels entered and plundered the compound of the king, and those of the absent princes, accompanied by much fire-raising. The royal treasury of at least 300,000 Spanish reals were taken by rebels. Flight and death of Amangkurat I Sources disagree on the details of the royal family's flight. According to the Dutch historian H. J. de Graaf, the king and his sons fled separately. Among his sons, the king encountered Puger and Singasari, who refused to come with him and later the crown prince, who did. According to Javanese accounts, the king instructed Puger, Singasari and Martasana to form a new defence to the west of the capital, while he took the crown prince and a younger son Pangeran Arya Mataram travelling northwest. The king travelled through areas not yet under rebel control: west through Bagelen, then the mountainous region of Banyumas, and then north towards Tegal on the coast. He travelled in a palanquin due to his illness, and was unmolested save for (according to Javanese accounts), an attempted robbery by villagers of Karanganyar who were unaware of his identity. The grave of Amangkurat I in Tegal Arum Complex, Tegal Regency, Central Java. He retreated there after the fall of Plered. According to de Graaf, he went to Tegal in order to meet with a VOC official on a ship but died on the way. According to the Javanese accounts, the aged and ill king, certain of his imminent death, went to Tegal because he wished to be buried there. Tegal was in his mother's country and he sent his officials ahead to built a grave for him in Tegalwangi, few kilometers south of the coast. As he laid dying, he ceremonially handed over the regalia to the crown prince, and instructed him to recapture the court with the Dutch's help. He then died, and his body was washed, prayed over and taken to the burial site in Tegalwangi. He was buried on 13 July and thirteen VOC soldiers from the ship off Tegal attended the burial. He was given the posthumous name Seda-ing-Tegalwangi (\\"He who died in Tegalwangi\\").  Aftermath  Remains of Kartasura, a new capital built by AmangkuratII after Plered's fall. After his father's death, the crown prince became King Amangkurat II, but he had no court, no army and no treasury. He was accepted by the Javanese gentry and by VOC officials in Tegal, but could not establish his authority elsewhere in Java. The governor of Cirebon, a vassal of Mataram since 1660 refused to pay homage. His brother Pangeran Puger occupied the capital after the rebels left, and made a rival claim to the kingdom. Aware of his difficult position, the new king sailed to Jepara to meet with the VOC commander Speelman and renewed the Mataram-VOC alliance. In exchange for VOC assistance, he was obliged to promise a large sum of money and geopolitical concessions. The Trunajaya rebellion would continue until 1680 and Puger's pretension to the throne until 1681. Unable to take Plered from his brother, in 1680 Amangkurat II built a new capital in the district of Pajang, and called it Kartasura.

Early life  Erika DeFreitas was born in Toronto, Canada, with ancestry in Guyana. Her grandmother taught baking and cake decorating classes at home in Guyana, which later influenced DeFreitas' work The Impossible Speech Act (2007). DeFreitas' mother has featured heavily in her work as both collaborator and subject, beginning in 2007 as DeFreitas was researching loss and mourning, with a focus on relationships and her own fear of losing her mother. Her relationship with her mother has been a large part of her work. Says DeFreitas, \\"Some of the major themes in my practice are mourning and loss, matrilineal narratives, post memory, and cultural identity\\".  Education  DeFreitas earned a Master of Visual Studies from the University of Toronto (2008); a Bachelor of Education from York University (2004) and a Bachelor of Art and Art History from the University of Toronto (2003).  Career  Through a postcolonial lens, Erika DeFreitas explores language, cultural loss and identity politics and places emphasis on process, the gesture and documentation. She has been awarded the 2016 Finalist Artist Prize from the Toronto Friends of Visual Arts and the 2016 John Hartman Award from the MacLaren Art Centre in Barrie, ON. DeFreitas was artist-in-residence at Alice Yard, Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago (2017; Also As Well Too, Winnipeg, MB (2015); and Mentoring Artists for Women's Art (MAWA), Winnipeg, MB (2010). DeFeitas created a series aptly named Pass-port where she manipulated her passport to explore the ambiguities of her own identity and nationality. In 2003 DeFreitas completed a project called Something Pretty Cozy, literally covering street fixtures with yarn cozies. She created the tatting tradition by exhibiting doilies but in the contemporary format of digital prints depicting the artist manipulating the objects with her body. DeFreitas continued the manipulation and examination of her body versus objects in a series of photographs called I Am Not Tragically Colored (after Zora Neale Hurston) where she distorted her face against a piece of glass that separated the viewer and herself. DeFreitas' work can be found in many permanent collections, including Wedge Curatorial Projects; Hart House Permanent Collection; Feminist Art Gallery (F.A.G.); Canada Council Art Bank; and TD Canada Trust Art Collection. DeFreitas is the recipient of several municipal, provincial and federal awards and grants from the Toronto Friends of Visual Arts, the Toronto Arts Council, the Ontario Arts Council, and the Canada Council for the Arts. Erika DeFreitas' work has been exhibited in Canada and the United States of America. Solo exhibitions explore ideas of absence, loss, memorialization and ritual, including the 2015 exhibition The Work of Mourning, Art Gallery of Mississauga, Mississauga, ON and Deaths/Memorials/Births, presented in 2013 at the Centre for Print and Media Arts, Hamilton, ON. and 2008 at Platform Centre for Photographic + Digital Arts, Winnipeg, MB. DeFreitas was inspired by her mother's obsession with reading newspaper obituaries and created her work, Deaths/Memorials/Births, where she unpacked the concept of memorialization in newspapers and manipulated these ideas through intuitively cutting and not cutting text from the obituaries to create works evoking found poetry. She continued to be inspired by and sometimes work in collaboration with her mother, such as in the work presented in the 2016 exhibition ; it was in the air, as they say and the 2009 exhibition In The Bedroom, both at Gallery 44, Toronto ON. Their collaborative textile work entitled Sometimes the Metonymic Object Is an Absence, a crochet blanket mimicking those in their family home, that visitors are invited to unravel, was included in The One and the Many: A Self-Portrait in Seven Parts, a 2015 group exhibition at Project Row Houses (Houston, TX). Her work has also been presented in many group exhibitions, including at the Art Gallery of Windsor (Windsor, ON); Aljira, a Center of Contemporary Art (Newark, NJ); Justina M. Barnicke Gallery (Toronto, ON), and Houston Museum of African American Culture (Houston, TX) Her work was featured alongside artists Sheila Pree Bright, Kwesi Abbensetts and Hew Locke in an issue of Transitions Magazine themed around Black childhood.

The land first acquired protected area status on 25 January 1990 as the Pureba Conservation Park constituted under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972. Crown land which had been previously dedicated as a conservation reserve known as the Pureba Conservation Reserve under the Crown Lands Act 1929 in 1993 was added to the conservation park on 29 June 2006 along with other land. Its name is derived from Pureba Hill which is located within its boundaries. As of 2013, the conservation park is managed as part of a larger group of protected areas known as the Yellabinna Reserves which also includes Boondina Conservation Park, the Yellabinna Regional Reserve, the Yellabinna Wilderness Protection Area and the Yumbarra Conservation Park. The management approach is described by the managing authority as being ‚Äúan integrated and collaborative approach to the conservation of over three million hectares of mallee woodland.‚Äù No visitors facilities are provided within the conservation park nor is there access for public vehicles. Mineral exploration and mining is permitted in the conservation park. A co-management agreement signed by the Far West Coast Aboriginal Corporation and the Government of South Australia in 2013 in respect to the Yumbarra Conservation Park also provides for the corporation to give advice on the management of the conservation park and other reserves in the west of the state.

A scholar of Hispano music, she is credited with helping to preserve New Mexican folk music. Vincent was born in Minnesota and raised in Chicago. In 1936, following her graduation from Vassar College, she and her husband, Dan Wells, visited the San Crist√≥bal, New Mexico, ranch of Freida Lawrence, the widow of D. H. Lawrence. In 1937 they bought a ranch in San Crist√≥bal and moved to New Mexico. Soon after, they founded a school on the property for grades 5‚Äì12 for boarders and daytime students. A classically trained musician,Vincent visited Taos-area schools where she played Mexican folk songs, although school administrators, pushing for assimilation, forbade speaking Spanish in classrooms. She also traveled from town to town, recording local musicians singing and playing old folk songs, frequently in Spanish. In 1943, Vincent became the Taos County representative for the Rocky Mountain Farmers Union, which, according to a biography, was \\"a milestone for her personal and political maturation. In this work she found meaningful expression and practical application for her growing political convictions.‚Äù That same year, Vincent joined the Communist Party. Vincent and Wells were divorced in the early 1940s. In 1949, she married Craig Vincent. They remained at the San Crist√≥bal property, converting the school to a guest ranch. Its mission was \\"not to raise livestock\\" but to \\"foster a community among progressives looking for a refuge from the battles of the Cold War\\". Among other political and social causes, the Vincents supported the Chicano Movement and the 1951 Salt of the Earth Strike. Believing that music was a vehicle for social advocacy, Vincent played with like-minded musicians including Pete Seeger, Paul Robeson, Woody Guthrie, Malvina Reynolds and Earl Robinson.

Sampson makes sculptures from discarded found objects that act as memorials for various people who have died. Sampson still has a studio based out of Newark.  Early life and education  Sampson was born in 1954 in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Following high school and a few years of college, Sampson became a police officer and then a detective with the Scotch Plains Police Department in New Jersey. During his career as a police officer, Sampson worked as a composite sketch artist for the Scotch Plains Police Department. Sampson is the first African American Uniformed Police Composite sketch artist in the country. Sampson considers himself to be a civil rights baby. His father, Stephen Sampson, was a civil rights leader for more than 50 years in and around New Jersey. Sampson grew up in a household where many of New Jersey's civil rights and civil unrest marches were planned. Many civil rights leaders visited Sampson's House, including Dick Gregory, Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, Robert Ferris Thompson and William Kunsler. Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm was one of Sampson's father's mentors, and was a frequent dinner guest in his home. Sampson moved to Newark in 1993. He attended the Newark School of Fine and Industrial Arts. Sampson began focusing on his artistic practice full-time following the deaths of close family members and his retirement from the Scotch Plains Police Department.  Career  Sampson has been a gallery artist with Cavin-Morris Gallery in New York since 1992. Sampson makes sculptures from found objects, such as glass cabinet knobs, sticks, strings, screws, and wood chips. These sculptures act as altars, memorials, and spiritual objects. Sampson began making art as a means to heal after the death of several family members and as a new way to give back to his community. In the early 1990s, Sampson's wife, Pamela, was diagnosed with a terminal illness and their son, Kyle, was born prematurely and died. Sampson's work has been influenced by other New York artists who honor the dead through vernacular memorials. His work differs from these artists, as most create murals in Latin American neighborhoods, street-side, altar-like assemblages of objects meant to last through only a brief public- display period of remembrance and grief. Sampson's work references and incorporates African spiritual traditions, including Yoruba, and follows the traditions of the Griot or storyteller. Much of Sampson's work offers commentary on issues of race, racism, and various forms of systemic injustice in the United States. Alongside other Newark-based artists, Sampson has spoken out against the recent, ongoing gentrification taking place in Newark, NJ. Sampson has completed a number of residencies throughout the United States, including The Marie Walsh Sharp Space program in New York City; a teaching residency at the John Michael Kohler Art Center in Sheboygan, Wisconsin; the Joan Mitchell Center's Residency in New Orleans; the Art and Industry Residency at the Kohler in Wisconsin; and most recently, the Inaugural Residency at the Mystic Seaport Museum in Connecticut. Sampson was selected to appear on the long running PBS Cartoon, Arthur. A cartoon version of himself was created, to which he voice-acted, and will appear as himself, an artist and teacher in a segment which will be released some time in the beginning of 2020. Sampson and Newark photographer Cesar Melgar were invited to exhibit and teach at the 2019 International Society of Biourbanism Design Summer School, which took place in Artena, Italy.

Nederland (an abbreviation of Fortuynistische Organisatie voor een Realistische Zakelijke Aanpak) is a Dutch right-wing populist political organisation active in the Netherlands. Despite the name the party has no connection nor is part of Forza Italia. Forza! is active in several municipalities in the Netherlands and was represented in the States-Provincial of North Holland until 2015. Forza! is known to be the successor of the former Pim Fortuyn List and very outspoken against Islam, refugees and for referendums and can be considered as a local counterpart of the Party for Freedom and Forum voor Democratie although Forza! denies this. History = Foundation = The party's history began in 2004 when Paul Meijer and Fleur Agema were disbarred from the States-Provincial Pim Fortuyn List. Meijer and Agema founded the party to participate in the 2006 elections, but failed to raise the money needed to participate. In 2006 Agema left the party and joined the Party for Freedom of Geert Wilders. Forza! participated in the 2006 Dutch municipal elections but won no seats in any municipalities. Forza! tried to cooperate with Rita Verdonk's Trots op Nederland but the differences between the two could not be resolved. In the Dutch municipal elections of 2010, Forza! only participated in two municipalities: Haarlemmermeer and Haarlem. In Haarlem the party won no seats, but in Haarlemmermeer the party won 3 seats in the town council. Forza! chairman Paul Meijer became the house leader. In late 2012, Forza! Netherlands also had a seat in the States-Provincial of Noord- Holland. Monica Nunes switched from the Party for Freedom to Forza! and represented the political organisation. In 2015 she was disbarred after not showing up in the state-provincial for almost a year. Forza! didn't return in the States-Provincial to give the PVV a change to grew. The party later official declared that they were against the form of a States-Provincial and wanted to abolish this. = 2014 - Present = In 2014 Forza! announced that the organisation didn't want to participate in national elections anymore and only will be active in various municipalities in the Netherlands. At the Municipal elections of 2014 the party grew from 3 to 4 seats in Haarlemmermeer, but lost two of them six months later after a conflict between Paul Meijer and two councillors. The party also participated in Velsen as Forza! IJmond and won 2 seats. In 2015 a councillor of a local party in Spijkenisse joined Forza! and also in 2016 a councillor in Castricum joined the party, making Forza! represented in four different municipalities. In 2017 Forza! chairman Paul Meijer announced that the party would also participate in the municipalities Maassluis and Enschede at the municipal elections in 2018. But the local leaders of the two cities stopped their campaigns just before the elections. In 2018 Forza! won one seat in the city of Castricum and went from two to three seats in the city of Velsen. In the city of Spijkenisse, Forza! lost all her seats. The elections in Haarlemmermeer are held in November 2018. Organization Till 2014 Forza! was a party with members and people could be a member.

John Rook  Little is known of the author, beyond his name and home village. Two John Rooks, aged 35 and 50, were registered in the census the following year living near Wigton, but it is not known which of these was the author, or whether they were related.  The manuscript  The location of the original manuscript is unknown, however a scanned photocopy, lacking one page, is online. The title reads MULTUM IN PARVO, or a Collection of old English, Scottish, Irish and Welsh tunes, for the... (there is then an illustration of various musical instruments, a fiddle, Northumbrian pipes, a trumpet, an accordion, a flute and a piccolo) ... containing upwards of 1260 airs, selected by John Rook, Waverton. Written by the selecter for his amusement on the above instruments, 1840. A note at the bottom of the illustration reads 'not to be lent on any account'. The selection of tunes is both wide and varied, and gives a detailed picture of the repertoire of a knowledgeable musician, who seems to have had access to an extensive collection of sources. While many of the tunes are common in printed and manuscript collections of the time, a significant number are, as the title page says, 'old'. They include a significant number of long variation sets, many dateable to the previous century. Northumbrian tunes It is clear from the title page that Rook played the Northumbrian pipes. Many of his Northumbrian pipe tunes are close to the versions in Peacock's Collection from about 1800, but often differing in details. One, The Bonny Pit Lad, is identical to, and probably derives from, a version published by Abraham Mackintosh early in the 19th century. Two tunes, Paddy O'Rafferty and Horse and away to Newmarket correspond to parts of the versions in the Lionel Winship manuscript, from Wark, in North Tynedale, suggesting that both compilers learned them from the same source. Other tunes, including Dorrington Lads, and Cut and Dry Dolly, are in versions not found in print. Dorrington Lads, in 5 strains, is similar to the larger version in the William Dixon manuscript, of 1733, and identical to a version found in the later 19th century Fenwick manuscript, where it is stated to be the version from the Reid family. Cut and Dry Dolly, while broadly similar to Peacock's version, has a range going higher than the single octave compass of the unkeyed smallpipe chanter, and an extra strain not found in Peacock; two very similar versions are found in a manuscript compiled by the Ancient Melodies Committee of the Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne it is known that James Reid and his sister Elizabeth Oliver were two of the informants when the Committee was collecting the music. It is thus very likely that Rook had direct contact with the Reids. While he lived some 80 miles from their home in North Shields, communication would have got much easier after 1837, when the Newcastle & Carlisle Railway opened between Gateshead and Carlisle. Another tune, called Captain Fenwick here, Sir John Fenwick's the Flower amang them in Northumberland, and Mary Scott, the Flower of Yarrow in Scotland, appears in a 7-strain version, again with notes beyond the single octave compass of the unkeyed pipes; the same version also appears in the Antiquaries' manuscript, as well as a manuscript of tunes compiled in 1872 by the Northumbrian artist Joseph Crawhall II, while its first 4 strains appear in the somewhat earlier Robert Bewick manuscript. It thus seems that an older single octave 4-strain version which was known to Bewick, was elaborated before 1840 by some other piper, possibly one of the Reid family, to use the extra compass of the keyed chanter. As Robert Reid was the principal developer of the modern keyed instrument, it would have made sense for him or his children, pipers themselves, to compose extra strains to existing pipe music exploiting the instrument's increased range. An alternative reading is that this version is older, originally to be played on Border pipes - it would require two notes above the instrument's normal range, but on some instruments, these could be played by overblowing. Cumbrian and West Border tunes Some tunes are local to Cumberland and the West Border region, indeed the first tune in the book is Canny Cummerlin. The slow 6/8 march Squire Dacre's, often called Noble Squire Dacre elsewhere, commemorates a local noble family; having 4 strains, rather than the two found in the Northumbrian Minstrelsy, it is the most elaborate version known, though similar to a three-strain version in Riddell's Scotch, Galwegian and Border Tunes, from Moffat, a little north of the Border. There is also an early version of John Peel, marked, unlike most tunes in the book, 'from memory'. As it is close in date to the tune's composition - Peel was still alive in 1840 - and somewhat different from the substantially reworked version published in 1866, this version is of interest. Rook also includes a Scottish tune, from which the song air was adapted: Where wad Bonnie Annie lie? Rook evidently regarded the tunes as distinct enough to include both. The fact that John Peel is marked \\"from memory\\", suggests that the other tunes were taken predominantly from printed or manuscript copies, which is corroborated by the closeness of some of them to known earlier versions. Scottish tunes Besides many dance tunes found in collections from the end of the 18th century, such as those of Niel Gow, and Aird, the manuscript also includes a significant number of earlier 18th-century tunes. Among these are a variation set on Lasses likes nae Brandy, deriving indirectly from a composition by David Young, in the Macfarlane manuscript, probably via a later printed collection by McLean - the following tune, a minuet, is attributed to McLean; a variation set on Further Benn the Welcomer, deriving from a version in Flores Musicae, or The Scots Musician, published in 1773, of which a copy is in the Wighton Collection at the University of Dundee; and a tune here called Nea Good Luck, but generally known as Up and war them all Willie, a version deriving from Oswald's Caledonian Pocket Companion of about 1750. Rook's title may derive from the fact that this tune, and the song in 6/8 time, Nae Good Luck, use the same passamezzo moderno ground bass. Versions of Alloway House, The Deukes dang ower my Daddie are also taken from Oswald,. as well as Love is the Cause of my Mourning. It thus seems that Rook had access to either a printed copy of the Caledonian Pocket Companion, or good manuscript copies of tunes from it.

Early life Born Gina Schnaufer to an affluent Marietta, Ohio family for whom art was not considered a serious activity, she studied at Smith College and eventually left an unhappy first marriage. On seeing a group of John Marin's New Mexico watercolors in a 1930 New York gallery exhibition, she was inspired to move to the state by his depictions of Native American Pueblo life. Arriving in New Mexico in 1931, Gina Schnaufer spent her first year in the region attending Native American ceremonials and dances, paying close attention to the colors and patterns in the scenes she witnessed. New Mexico On her visits to various Pueblos, Schnaufer was accompanied by a young Canadian artist, Ernest Knee, a photographer whose landscape images are a record of New Mexico's photographic history. Although there was a nine-year age difference, Schnaufer married the younger artist in 1933, and is best known by his surname despite a subsequent 1945 marriage to the painter Alexander Brook. The two made a home in the vacant house of Walter Mruk, one of Santa Fe's Los Cinco Pintores, and were welcomed into the burgeoning but largely male Santa Fe arts community. Brought up to defer to men and their interest, she knew that \\"...it was one thing to call oneself an artist in a town of artists and quite another to rearrange her life priorities into a list headed by 'ART'.\\" Moving north to the Tesuque Valley, the Knees built a home using local materials that welcomed the outside in, with portals and patios aplenty. Once the house was complete, Knee concentrated on her painting. Aware that she would always be an outsider to the local Pueblo culture, she turned to the New Mexico landscape for inspiration. Her early landscapes were traditional and often imitative of her mentors, but she progressed rapidly, and in 1933, she joined a new group of artists who named themselves the Rio Grande Painters, regionalists whose work \\"is composed of painters bound together mainly by a preference for the Southwest, both as a place of residence and a perpetual mine of paintable material.\\" Knee was attuned not only to the landscape itself but also to the spiritual connection to the land that she had witnessed in the New Mexico Pueblos. As the 1930s drew to a close, Knee began to move away from formalist figure-ground painting traditions and to more abstracted work, often a meandering mix of color and forms, with calligraphic lines and agile brushwork. In the 1940s her husband left for California to work in the war effort and she remained in New Mexico. After meeting dealer Marian Willard, she was invited to mount her first solo exhibition at Willard's Gallery in New York. Willard introduced her to the work of Paul Klee, and the fantasy element so prominent in Klee's oeuvre began to appear in Knee's work. She began to incorporate mixed media, adding gouache and tempera to her preferred medium of watercolor and adopting more modernist conventions. Her work was both praised for \\"restraint [and] lovely color\\" and demeaned by gender-specific comments that likened her work to \\"samplers\\" that were \\"replete with little things\\" but overall the results were encouraging. California In late 1942, Knee decided to join her husband in Los Angeles, where they explored the city and delved into the West Coast art scene, meeting luminaries like Man Ray and Thomas Mann. Ernest Knee became the personal photographer to the reclusive Howard Hughes. The change in their lifestyle, he going off to work daily and she faced with household chores in a wartime era, led to a dark period which lifted when she began to create work for a California gallery owned by Dalzell Hatfield. The innovative California watercolor movement was inspirational, and Knee began to visit the beaches for inspiration, resulting in work that was sometimes obvious and at other times, more subtle. Her work was praised by Walter Arensberg, much of whose collection now resides at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. As her art career progressed, however, her marriage disintegrated, and Ernest Knee struck up a relationship with another woman. In 1943, convinced that her marriage was over, after fulfilling her commitment to provide a body of work for a New York exhibit at Marian Willard's Gallery, Knee returned to New Mexico. Later career Knee spent much of the autumn of 1943 in New York, where she began a new life with the painter Alexander Brook. They settled in Savannah, Georgia, where Brook had lived previously with his former wife, renovating an old warehouse into a living space with two separate studios. An exhibit at the E. B. Crocker Gallery Sacramento partnered Knee with modernist painters Lionel Feininger, Mark Tobey and Morris Graves, and her subtle and contemplative works contributed to a harmonious exhibition. In a c.1950 letter to a friend (Gina Knee to Spud Johnson, the Johnson Papers), she noted that \\"Maybe its easiest to say that in adjusting to a new life, I had to cut the lovely strands of the past,\\" and she sold her New Mexico home. While she was used to the differences in the lives of the Anglo, Hispanic and Native American residents of New Mexico, the South was new and different, and she tried to evoke in her work the live of southern blacks. For the first time, she began to paint with oils. With the knowledge that she could scrape away and re-do allowed her new ways to explore texture, color and brushstrokes, telling gallery owner Willard in a letter that she no longer felt \\"in tune with watercolor painting at all when I attempt it.\\" (Gina Knee to Marian Willard, 27 Jan. 1947, WGP) Long Island, New York Knee and Brook divided their time between Savannah and New York, interspersing it with road- trips to locations where Brook had portrait commissions. After a few years, however, they were ready to settle down in one spot, and they chose a meadowland property outside of Sag Harbor, New York. After renovating the old house on the property, they again set up separate studios in an old barn. Knee prepared for a 1949 solo show, but the reviews were mixed, with the watercolors receiving higher marks than the oils. The emergence of Abstract Expressionism and Knee worked to establish a sense of community to with the artists who were coming to the forefront of the American art scene, but she remained on the periphery of the movement, never truly integrating with the likes of Jackson Pollock and Willem DeKooning. Despite the abstract qualities of her work, she maintained ties to recognizable imagery, secure in her own style. During the 1950s and 1960s, she continued to exhibit with the Long Island group or Abstract Expressionists, and New Mexico artist friends like Barbara Latham and Howard Cook came to visit, bringing with them the memories of New Mexico's impact on her life's work. Travels made both with and without her husband continued to offer new material for watercolors, oils and etchings. In 1965, she was selected for an early survey of American female artists entitled \\"Women Artists of America 1707-1964\\" which was exhibited at the Newark Museum and she was gratified to be one of the 129 artists chosen to represent women's palace in American art history. In that same year, she had her only true retrospective, composed of paintings created between the 1930s and the 1960s, and co-sponsored by Skidmore College and New York's Larcada Gallery. Knee continued to exhibit sporadically throughout the 1960s and 1970s, and as she approached her 80s, she remained active and involved. In her last exhibition, which took place in Santa Fe, NM, twenty-five watercolors from her years in the Southwest were displayed, and after the exhibit closed her family donated the works to the New Mexico Museum of Art. Knee died on her eighty-fourth birthday, on October 31, 1982. In her seventies, she would remark, \\"I never got over New Mexico‚Äì‚Äìthe landscape, the mesaas, mountains, the green and tan.\\" References 1898 births 1982 deaths 20th-century American women artists Artists from Ohio Smith College alumni ","title":"Gina Knee Brook"},{"id":"53455887","text":"Kathy Temin (born 1968) is an Australian artist who uses synthetic fur to create sculptural objects and installations.

Forty-one girls, aged between 14 and 17 years old, were killed when a fire broke out at the orphanage. The girls had been locked in a schoolroom following protests, riots and an escape attempt which occurred the day before. In the aftermath of the fire, three government officials‚Äîincluding the country's Secretary of Social Welfare‚Äîwere arrested and charged with crimes such as wrongful death and negligence. Background Virgen de la Asunci√≥n Safe Home is a state-run children's home located in San Jose Pinula, about away from the capital Guatemala City. The institution was built in 2010 and accommodates abandoned or orphaned children, as well as children with disabilities, drug addictions, or who are pregnant. Some have been institutionalized by the state after being abused by family members, forced into prostitution, or being homeless. Although the home does not house criminals, it does take in minors with legal histories who have completed their sentences, but have no relatives to take care of them. The home has a capacity of around 350 to 500 youths, but was housing 700 to 800 at the time of the fire. Children were separated into different areas of the building based on age and gender. =Reports of abuse= Virgen de la Asunci√≥n has a long history of abuse allegations. In 2014, a contractor hired by the home was convicted of raping a mentally disabled 17-year-old girl. Two teachers have been arrested on charges of sexual assault. Guatemala's Human Rights Ombudsman's Office (PDH for its initials in Spanish) received 45 reports of abuse between 2012 and 2016. On 2 November 2016, the PDH requested the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to issue precautionary measures, citing evidence of mistreatment by staff and of a human trafficking network which recruited children from the home. Incident =7 March= On 7 March, rioting broke out at the safe home, followed by a mass escape. The day began with protests against abuse, rape, and overcrowding. According to the Social Welfare Secretariat, the riot started at 2:00pm when a group of adolescents climbed on to the roof and threatened guards and staff with metal objects. During the confusion, about 85 residents escaped and fled into the surrounding woods. Most were captured by police and returned to the home. At around 10:00pm, an officer of Guatemala's National Civil Police called president Jimmy Morales to inform him of the situation. Upon returning to the home, the adolescents were not immediately allowed to enter the building. President Morales had directed the staff to keep the escapees separate because they had broken the law and represented a risk to the other residents. At 1:00am, the escapees were let back into the building. The boys were returned to their dormitories, while the girls were sent to a schoolroom. =8 March= Fifty-one girls were confined to a schoolroom of . They were provided with mattresses, but not blankets. The National Police guarded the room over the night. In the morning, the girls were not allowed to leave to use the bathroom. At around 9:00am, a fire broke out in the schoolroom. The cause of the fire is undetermined, but witnesses claim the fire was set by adolescents in an act of protest. Two survivors recounted hearing girls shouting that they were going to \\"sacrifice so that everyone would know what they were living in there.\\" (quote translated from Spanish) Police who were guarding the room did not allow the girls to escape. Nineteen girls died on the scene. Victims were transferred to hospitals in Guatemala City and the Shriners Hospital for Children in Texas. In total, 41 girls were killed by the fire. All were between the ages of 14 and 17. Aftermath crime scene tape Human rights advocates condemned various officials‚Äîincluding president Morales, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Social Welfare‚Äîfor failing to address the complaints about abuse of all kinds at the orphanage. A spokesman for the president instead placed blame on the court system. Several members of the Congress of Guatemala called for the dismissal of Carlos Rodas, the Secretary of Social Welfare. Meanwhile, the Public Prosecutor began a criminal investigation of the events, collecting evidence including video from surveillance cameras at the home. On 11 March, hundreds of people protested in Guatemala City against the perceived negligence, corruption and ineptitude of the Guatemalan government. Protestors walked through the streets of the city reading the names and ages of the girls who died. Chants included \\"it was the state,\\" and \\"it wasn't an accident, it was an execution.\\" On the same day as the protests, Rodas resigned as Secretary of Social Welfare. President Morales announced he would \\"remove the line of command\\" at the safe home, and the Deputy Secretary of Social Welfare and the director of the home were both dismissed shortly after the fire. =Arrests= On 13 March, Guatemalan authorities announced the arrests of former secretary Carlos Rodas, former deputy secretary Anah√≠ Keller, and former director of the safe home Santos Torres. Criminal charges against them included wrongful death, mistreatment of minors, and negligence. In June, two police officers, were also charged for crimes related to the fire.

History Abdulla Aujan & Brothers was founded in Bahrain in 1905 by Abdulla Aujan and three of his brothers. The company traded commodities such as tobacco and rice. Aujan entered the beverages industry in 1928, when it secured the exclusive license to distribute Vimto in the Middle East. Abdulla Aujan's nephew, Adel Abdul Rahman Aujan, joined the company in 1968, after graduating from Fort Lewis College in Colorado, US Adel expanded the company's beverage sales and distribution networks beyond Saudi Arabia. He also played a role in developing Vimto Carbonated, a fizzy version of the original drink. Adel Aujan died in January 2017.  Beverages  Aujan entered the beverages industry in 1928, when it secured the exclusive license to distribute Vimto in the Middle East. The company established its first beverage manufacturing plant in 1979 at Dammam, Saudi Arabia.http://www.facetofaceuae.com/dev/Aujan/AGH/en/about-us/our-history/ The company introduced Rani Orange Float, its first homegrown beverage, in 1982. Aujan Industries began importing Barbican from U.K.-based Bass Beers for sale in the Middle East in 1983. Alongside the Swiss-made beverage Moussy, Barbican was the first non-alcoholic malt beverage to be sold in the region. Manufacturing changes at Bass Beers disrupted supplies of Barbican to Aujan, and in 1999, Aujan purchased the Barbican brand in select markets. Aujan acquired complete control of Barbican in 2010, and began manufacturing the beverage at the company's factory in Dubai. Aujan established a second beverage manufacturing plant in 2005 at Dubai, UAE. On 14 December 2011, the Coca-Cola acquired a 50% stake in Aujan's beverages business for $980 million. Coca-Cola acquired a 50% stake in Aujan's brands, and a 49% stake in its bottling and distribution company. Aujan retains control of the Vimto license, and also its manufacturing and distribution operations in Iran. The deal was completed on 24 September 2012. Following the deal, the two companies established Aujan Coca-Cola Beverages Company (ACCBC) and Rani Refreshments in 2012. Rani Refreshments holds the global brand rights for Aujan's original brands such as Rani and Barbican. Both companies are headquartered in Dubai. ACCBC will serve as the manufacturer and distributor of the brands owned by Rani Refreshments and the Coca-Cola Company, as well as Vimto under license. Mirroring the system used by Coca-Cola and its global bottling partners, Rani Refreshments will supply ACCBC with proprietary concentrate and the latter will produce and distribute the beverages. Coca-Cola and Aujan held a ceremony in Dubai in March 2013 to mark the one billionth can of Rani produced by ACCBC. In July 2014, ACCBC announced that it had completed a deal to acquire an 80% stake in the National Beverage Company, the manufacturer and distributor of Coca-Cola and Pampa products in Lebanon, for an undisclosed sum. As a result, the National Beverage Company's manufacturing plant in Beirut, Lebanon became Aujan's fourth beverage manufacturing plant. =Rani juice= Rani is a brand of fruit-based juice beverages manufactured by ACCBC and primarily sold in the Middle East. The company introduced Rani Orange Float in 1982. The beverage was inspired by a mandarin drink that Aujan Industries Chairman Adel Aujan had tasted during a trip to Japan.

Biography  Emma Bormann was born in 1887 in Vienna. Her father, Eugen Bormann (1842‚Äì1917), was an archaeologist and a professor of ancient Roman history and epigraphy at the University of Vienna. She received a doctorate in prehistory at the same university in 1917 (with a dissertation on the Neolithic period in Lower Austria). While a student at the university, she also took classes at the Institute for Teaching and Experimentation in Graphic Arts with Ludwig Michalek. Emma Bormann pursued interests in athletics and drama as well, but art was to be her true calling. She went to Munich in 1917 and enrolled in art classes for one semester before becoming an art teacher herself. It was in Munich at this time that she began making woodcuts. She quickly mastered this medium and developed a unique style that blended expressionism and impressionism and combined respect for traditional woodcut craft with a more modern sensibility. Emma Bormann traveled widely during her lifetime. Before her departure for China in 1939, she visited many cities in Europe and made her first visit to the United States in 1936. Cityscapes and crowded public squares, often viewed from above, were among her favorite subjects, as well as the interiors of theaters, concert halls, and opera houses. When she arrived in a new city, she looked for a tower, tall building, or hill that would provide this perspective. Her works from these years are a record of her travels, showing many cities in Germany, the Netherlands, Croatia, Italy, Sweden, London, Istanbul, Paris, Prague, and Budapest. Her 1936 visit to the United States resulted in memorable views of New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., and Niagara Falls. Her works include many images of her native country as well, views of Vienna and other places in Austria, such as Salzburg and the countryside of Salzburg province. In 1927, the centennial of the composer Beethoven's death, she completed and published an album of woodblock prints showing the houses where Beethoven had lived in Vienna and the surrounding towns. In 1924, she married Eugen Milch (1889‚Äì1958), a physician and a talented painter and etcher in his own right. She taught courses in drawing, figure drawing, and linocut techniques as a lecturer at the University of Vienna from 1926 to 1939. Eugen Milch went to China in December 1937 with an Austrian medical mission by invitation of the Chinese government. When the Austrian physicians arrived, their contracts were not honored by the Chinese national health administration, but Dr. Milch remained in China. By March 1938 he managed to secure a position with the Church Missionary Society as superintendent of the Puren Hospital in Pakhoi (Beihai). Emma Bormann and their two daughters went to China and joined Dr. Milch in late 1939. A Japanese military invasion of the South China coast in spring 1941 forced the Bormann-Milch family to leave Pakhoi and move to Shanghai, where Emma Bormann would remain until 1950. In spite of the hardships of this time and place, she was able to continue her artistic activity. Woodcuts and linocuts from this time show the Huangpu River and the busy streets of Shanghai, as well as her impressions of Hangzhou and Beijing, which she visited during the 1940s. In June‚ÄìJuly 1947 a solo exhibition of her work was shown at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. The Smithsonian's graphic arts curator, Jacob Kainen, wrote that \\"Dr. Bormann-Milch is unquestionably one of the outstanding woodcutters of our time. Aside from her phenomenal skill in suggesting tone and atmosphere in this intractable medium, the artist possesses a certain heroic and monumental quality of design.\\" In 1950 Emma Bormann left Shanghai, traveling across Japan, Hawaii, and the United States back to Europe. In April 1953 a solo exhibition of her work was held at the Austrian State Printing House in Vienna. She would make further visits to Europe, but did not live there again. Beginning in 1953, she resided in Tokyo with her daughter Uta. She made her last woodcuts some time in the late 1950s or 1960s; after this point she no longer had the strength in her arms for carving. She continued to sketch, paint, cut paper silhouettes and took up other media, such as stencil printing and mosaics. She studied and adapted a Japanese stencil printing technique. She made a series of stencil prints showing the dancers and musicians of the Japanese imperial court (performances of gagaku and bugaku). A significant exhibition of her work took place in January 1957 in Tokyo, organized by the Asahi Press Company. In fall 1957 she exhibited in Tokyo at the Japan Art Academy annual exhibition (Nitten) and received an award, significant recognition for a foreign artist living in Japan. From 1958 until her death, Emma Bormann traveled back and forth regularly between Japan and Riverside, California, where her second daughter Jorun had settled. Her travels in the late 1950s and 1960s took her to Southeast Asia and Mexico. She died in Riverside in December 1974.  Style and artistic subjects  Observers have often remarked on the dynamism and energy of her work. Writing in 1922, the art historian and curator Arpad Weixlg√§rtner found that Emma Bormann's work reflected a characteristically Austrian response to modern art. The Austrian artist, he wrote \\"does not like to have an art fashion forced on him at once; first he tests it, selects what suits him, and alters what has been adopted according to his own judgment. So too Dr. Bormann is by no means to be found in the advance guard of modern art, but her works, rightly considered, could belong to no other period than the present. Even the choice of many of her subjects is characteristic of our time: a teeming square or hall in a terrifying contemporary metropolis.\\" Bormann's frequent subjects included panoramic city views, scenes of city streets and squares, and other public spaces like performance venues (e.g., theaters, opera houses, concert halls, and circuses). Her 1931 linocut \\"Dolma Bagtsch√©, Constantinople\\" (using what was then a new medium, linoleum) features the great Dolmabah√ße Mosque silhouetted against a deep blue sea. This work won an Honorable Mention by the Art Institute of Chicago.  Exhibits  Bormann's work was exhibited frequently during her lifetime.

Preparation  The synthesis of 2,2-diethoxytetrahydrofuran via Œ≥-butyrolactone and the Meerwein salt (triethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate) in diethyl ether was first described by Hans Meerwein and co-workers. In the reaction the electrophilic ethyl cation attackes the carbonyl oxygen and forms the stable but extraordinarily hygroscopic O-ethyl-Œ≥-butyrolactonium tetrafluoroborate (melting point 42 ¬∞C). The compound dissolves in dichloromethane, chloroform and 1,2-dichloroethane but is insoluble in diethyl ether, benzene and tetrachloromethane. The onium salt reacts practically quantitatively with an ethanolate anion from sodium ethoxide in ethanol forming 2,2-diethoxytetrahydrofuran. :Synthese von 2,2-Diethoxytetrahydrofuran nach Meerwein 2,2-Diethoxytetrahydrofuran can also be produced in a solvent-free one-pot reaction using Œ≥-butyrolactone, orthoformic triethyl ester and gaseous boron trifluoride.

First diethoxymethylium tetrafluoroborate is formed from the triethyl orthoformate and boron trifluoride at -30 ¬∞C.

As of 2014, the five operators had a total of 89 betting parlors and 5 tele-theaters around the state. They accepted a total of $558 million of bets in 2016. Operations Off-track betting is offered by five regional corporations. A sixth OTB corporation, serving New York City, closed down in 2010. Each corporation is a public benefit corporation, run by a board of directors who are appointed by the governments of the participating counties and cities. In addition to New York City, thirteen other counties (Allegany, Delaware, Hamilton, Jefferson, Lewis, Onondaga, Ontario, Otsego, Saratoga, Schoharie, Tompkins, Westchester, and Yates) do not have any OTB parlors. Each of the OTB corporations accepts wagers at a number of full-service branch locations, at self-service terminals located in restaurants and bars, and by telephone and Internet. Out of each wager placed through OTB, approximately 77 percent goes into the parimutuel pools for distribution to winning bettors. The remaining amount, known as the \\"takeout\\", is retained by the OTB operator. In addition, a surcharge of 5 or 6 percent is deducted from most payouts to winning OTB bettors. From these revenues, payments are made to the state, participating counties and cities, racetracks, and funds to support the racing industry. After the OTB's operating expenses are paid, any remaining profits are disbursed to the state and the participating counties and cities. History The New York State Legislature enacted its first off-track betting law in 1970, creating the New York City Off-Track Betting Corporation and allowing other municipalities to establish their own OTB operations. The law was meant to curb illegal bookmakers and provide a revenue source for state and local governments. NYC OTB began taking bets in 1971. The City of Schenectady followed in 1972 with its own OTB operation. The current system of regional OTB corporations was enacted in 1973. OTB parlors began showing live video feeds of races (referred to as simulcasting) in 1984. NYC OTB An OTB parlor in Ditmars, Queens, as seen in June 2010 The New York City Off-Track Betting Corporation covered the five boroughs of New York City.

The primary focus of her work is the relationship between innovation and equity, particularly focusing on the intersection of race, justice and technology. Benjamin is the author of numerous publications, including the books People's Science: Bodies and Rights on the Stem Cell Frontier (2013) and Race After Technology: Abolitionist Tools for the New Jim Code (2019). Benjamin is also a prominent public intellectual, having spoken at TEDxBaltimore, blogged at The Huffington Post, and co- organized Black to the Future: An Imagination Incubator.  Early life  Benjamin describes her interest in the relationship between science, technology and medicine as being prompted by her early life. She was born in a clinic in Wai, Maharashtra, India. Hearing her parents' stories about the interaction of human bodies with medical technology in the clinic sparked her interest. She has lived and spent time in many different places, including \\"many Souths\\": South Central Los Angeles; Conway, South Carolina; Majuro, South Pacific, and Swaziland, Southern Africa, and cites these different experiences and cultures as being influential in her way of looking at the world.  Career  Benjamin received her Bachelor of Arts in sociology and anthropology from Spelman College, before going on to complete her PhD in sociology at the University of California Berkeley in 2008. She completed a postdoctoral fellowships at UCLA‚Äôs Institute for Society and Genetics in 2010, before taking a faculty fellowship at the Harvard Kennedy School's Science, Technology, and Society Program. In 2013, Benjamin's first book, People's Science: Bodies and Rights on the Stem Cell Frontier was published by Stanford University Press. In it, she critically investigates how innovation and design often builds upon or reinforces inequalities. In particular, Benjamin investigates how and why scientific, commercial, and popular discourses and practices around genomics have incorporated racial-ethnic and gendered categories. In People's Science, Benjamin also argues for a more inclusive, responsible, and public scientific community. In 2019, her book, Race After Technology: Abolitionist Tools for the New Jim Code was published by Polity. In it, Benjamin expands upon her previous research and analysis by focusing on a range of ways in which social hierarchies, particularly racism, are embedded in the logical layer of internet-based technologies. She develops her concept of the \\"New Jim Code,\\" which references Michelle Alexander's work The New Jim Crow, to analyze how seemingly \\"neutral\\" algorithms and applications can replicate or worsen racial bias. In 2019, a book she edited, Captivating Technology: Reimagining Race, Carceral Technoscience, and Liberatory Imagination in Everyday Life was released by Duke University Press, examining how carceral logics shape social life well beyond prisons and police. Currently, Benjamin is Associate Professor in the Department of African American Studies at Princeton University where her work focuses on dimensions of science, technology, and medicine, race and citizenship, knowledge and power. In 2018, she founded the JUST DATA Lab, a space for activists, technologists and artists to reassess how data can be used for justice. She also serves on the Executive Committees for the Program in Global Health and Health Policy and Center for Digital Humanities at the University of Princeton.

She has served as founder, chair, adviser, or member of several organizations, such as the Caribbean Association for Feminist Research and Action (CAFRA), the Global Fund for Women, and the Regional Advisory Committee of the Global Coalition on Women and AIDS established by UNAIDS. In 2002 she received the Seventh CARICOM Triennial Award for Women, was Trinidad and Tobago's nominee for the International Women of Courage Award in 2008, and was honoured in her country's National Honour Awards ceremony in 2012 with the Gold Medal for the Development of Women. Early life Rhoda Elizabeth Reddock was born on 7 June 1953 in Kingstown, on Saint Vincent, the largest island of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to Rosa and Bertram Reddock. Her mother was a teacher and her father served as an agricultural officer and adviser to local farmers. She attended primary school at Kingstown Preparatory School on Saint Vincent, before her family relocated in 1960 to Trinidad. Completing her primary education at Eastern Girls Primary School in Port of Spain, Reddock furthered her education at Bishop Anstey High School. Enrolling at the University of the West Indies (UWI) in 1971, she went on to earn a Bachelor of Science in social administration in 1975, after completing studies at both the St. Augustine and Mona campuses. Furthering her education, Reddock moved to the Netherlands and earned a master's degree from the International Institute of Social Studies in The Hague in 1980. She then enrolled in applied sociology at the University of Amsterdam and completed her PhD in 1985, before returning to Trinidad. While she was working on her graduate studies, Reddock compiled the work of Clotil Walcott, a Trinidadian labour leader, into a booklet Fight Back Say a Woman and secured publishing for it in The Hague. Inviting Walcott to participate in the International Wages for Housework (IWFH) Campaign in 1980, Reddock facilitated the international ties that would spur Walcott into her work with the United Nations. Career In 1985, Reddock began working as a research fellow at UWI in the Institute for Social and Economic Research and pressed for the development of a gender studies program for UWI. She became a lecturer in the sociology department in 1990 and continued her research until 1993. The following year, she became the head of a new program, the Centre for Gender and Development Studies in St. Augustine. That same year, Reddock published Women, Labour and Politics in Trinidad and Tobago, which was followed two years later by Ethnic Minorities in Caribbean Society. She has served on the Executive Council and Advisory Board of the Caribbean Studies Association and as a member of the Latin American Studies Association. She is an international member of the American Sociological Association. As a researcher, her work has focused on gender and sexuality in the Caribbean, the history of the Caribbean women‚Äôs movement, labour and work, and the effects of gender and race on citizenship. She has studied Indo- Caribbean populations and the manner in which colonialism, traditional class structures and the struggle for economic survival effected men and women differently. Her work on the history of activism in the Caribbean has shed light on how women initiated the move toward democratization from both political and labour perspectives, linking feminist goals and nationalist movements. In addition to her academic pursuits, Reddock has maintained a presence in the fight for social parity and justice. She attended both the Fourth World Conference on Women in 1985 held in Nairobi, Kenya, and the Fifth World Conference on Women in 1995 in Beijing, China. She was one of the founders, and served as first chair of the Caribbean Association for Feminist Research and Action (CAFRA), as well as a founder of the Caribbean Network on Studies of Masculinity. Reddock led research on a national initiative on child abuse which has been expanded into a region-wide program and is supported by UNICEF. She spent two years working on a National Gender Policy with Camille Antoine and Patricia Mohammed, that was not adopted, but which Reddock still hopes will gain traction. Reddock's activism and dedication to academics has been recognized on a national and international level. She was a recipient of the Rockefeller Residency Fellowship at Hunter College in 1992. In 2001, she received UWI's Vice-Chancellor‚Äôs Award for Excellence in Teaching and Administration, Research and Public Service. Reddock was the 2002 recipient of the Seventh CARICOM Triennial Award for Women\\"Citation In Honour Of Professor Rhoda Reddock On The Occasion Of The Presentation Of The Seventh Caricom Triennial Award For Women\\", CARICOM Press Release, 6 July 2002. and in 2008 was Trinidad's nominee for the International Women of Courage Award.

The Convento de Santo Domingo is a convent established from the 16th century in the city of Cartagena de Indias, in Colombia. Its canonical name was \\"Convento de San Daniel\\". Until 19th century maintained a community of friars of the Dominican Order. The building was then expropriated and handed over to the diocese of Cartagena, serving as a seminary, college and then institute of fine arts. It was recently restored. It is one of the most important tourist sites in the city.  Origin of the convent  In 1531, two years after the first arrival of the Dominican friars to the shores of the so-called \\"New Kingdom of Granada\\" and following the method used of evangelization attached to the Conquest, a small group of them accompanied the conqueror Pedro of Heredia in its task of exploration of the region of Calamar√≠. In June 1533, the city of Cartagena de Indias was founded, thought from the beginning as a city-port of great relevance for the colonizing task. That is why, three months later, the creation of a diocese was organized in this place, the second of these lands, after Santa Marta. As first bishop, the Dominican Salamancan Fr. Tom√°s de Toro y Cabero was chosen on April 24, 1534. His government was brief, for he died two years later, after facing serious struggles with the encomenderos, at the head of Pedro de Heredia himself, due to its excesses with the natives. From the very origin of the city, the friars dedicated themselves to the teaching of Christian doctrine to the natives entrusted, in towns and villages of the region. As the new population prospered, it was thought to create a convent, which would serve as a basis for evangelization tasks, and contribute to intellectual formation and observance. Thus, while the bulls were issued for the second bishop of the diocese, the also Dominican Fr. Jer√≥nimo de Loaisa, the order was sent to organize a regular convent in the city, which began to be built that year, under the invocation of \\"Saint Joseph\\", although everyone knew him as \\"Sant Dominic\\" because this was the saint founder of the religious order of the Dominicans. Its first prior was Fr. Juan de √Åvila. Cristo de la Expiraci√≥n\\" (\\"Christ of Expiration\\") The first seat of the convent was located in the square \\"Plaza de la Yerba\\" (Plaza de los Coches) and it was no more than a temporary shed of straw and mud, which was not very strong. And although there was the essential, community life, the building still lingered on being erected. After an agitated crosses of letters, reports, petitions and certificates, towards 1549, thanks to the initiative of Fr. Jos√© de Robles, the construction of the Convent headquarters was begun. In February 1552 a fire destroyed the city and a better place had to be found for the Dominican convent, on a lot donated by Francisco L√≠pari. As is usual, the work was totally in charge of the indigenous of the encomiendas, who also had to hand over part of their own property. The contribution of the Spanish encomenderos in a beginning was minimal. For this reason, the initial construction was not a big thing: a rustic house of straw and mud, with a chapel, in which, because of its fragility, \\"the Blessed Sacrament could not be had, especially because of the danger of fires\\" according to the documents. Then came the years of stagnation, where, in spite of the efforts of the friars, the Spaniards of the city were reluctant to collaborate in the construction of the conventual seat. Meanwhile, through its doors entered and left numerous Dominican missions coming from Spain, destined to diverse regions of the New World. At last, about 1565, the prior Fr. Pedro M√°rtir Palomino, seeing the house threatening to ruin, entrusted to the friars doctrine, to take advantage of the preaching of Lent \\"to see if they could make some fruit with their sermons and get some alms to start the sumptuous building of our church and convent.\\" Church of the Convento de Santo Domingo of Cartagena de Indias, before its restoration. Convento de Santo Domingo (interior view) And although there was an effort to build, the funds appeared very slowly, so the construction process took approximately 150 years. Thus, at the time of building, it was necessary to repair what was already built and deteriorating rapidly in the warm atmosphere of Cartagena. The works only began in 1578. Two years later, the new convent only had the bases and religious offices continued to be held in temporary places; Meanwhile, the numerous friars managed to live in only seven table cells. And although in 1596 the King ordered an aid of 5,000 pesos for the convent of Santo Domingo and the one of San Agust√≠n, in 1623 the ceiling of the conventual church barely covered half of enclosure. Finally, in 1630 the temple was finished, but by the end of the 17th century the first convent cloister remained unfinished, and we still find in 1730 references to donations made by the King for the construction and repair of the Convent. The large investment and long work produced a building not very attractive on the outside, as the chronicler Friar Alonso de Zamora, who described it at the beginning of the 18th century as a convent of \\"yellow facade; Those grate-like lattice-like windows, that massive church, whose rounded ceilings resemble a gigantic turtle, that crumpled dome, that rough quadrangular bell tower, that unfinished tower whose crumbling ruined walls are covered with vegetables and shelter owls, All that causes a deep sadness,\\" nothing to do with the exterior grandeur of the other great Dominican convent in New Granada, the \\"convento de Santo Domingo, of Santa Fe de Bogot√°. However, the chronicler continues, \\"all that is changed in admiration when one crosses the threshold and contemplates the grand quadrilateral of the cloisters, ten meters high and proportionally wide, on two floors\\"; A spacious and airy building, simple, large, eloquent. To say of own and strangers, the convent of Santo Domingo was the most beautiful construction that existed in the city.  Center of evangelization in doctrines  The Convento de Santo Domingo, raised curiously on an old indigenous center, was born and had its being put in place of formation of missionary friars and center of doctrinal diffusion in the bordering regions. For this reason, many of the Dominicans assigned to this convent worked, especially during the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries in doctrines of natives, returning periodically to make regular life. It was important the work that during the 16th century, several of them did in defense of the Natives, against the exploitation of which they were object by the encomenderos. By 1763 the Convent was still in charge of the doctrines of San Andr√©s, Morroa, Piojo, Malambo, Ci√©nega, Gaira, Sitionuevo y Sima√±a.  Formation and study place  This place also became center of studies for the friars. It had its own noviciate and it imparted the philosophical-theological formation required by the constitutions of the Order. Its conventual study was erected canonically and was the third in importance, after those of Santa Fe de Bogot√° and Tunja. Also, the convent of Santo Domingo, or \\"San Jos√©\\" of Cartagena, had the right to send annually two outstanding friars to carry out doctoral studies in the University of Santo Tom√°s of Santa Fe de Bogot√°. It even went on to teach theology, of compulsory attendance, to secular priests and clerics of higher orders residing in the city.  Economic center  Stained glass in the convent Cartagena was a port city and merchant by nature and the Dominican convent could not escape this business atmosphere. For that reason, the community soon acquired many movable and immovable property and became an important lender, thanks to the system of censuses, chaplains and pious works, favoring the call by the historians \\"economy of salvation\\".  Collaborator of the court of the Inquisition  It is known that in 1610 the Inquisition was inaugurated in Cartagena de Indias, and although the Dominicans were not in front of the court (except in one opportunity), yes they collaborated, like the other religious communities in the city, in the role of qualifiers, charged with theological study of propositions considered heretical, and to seek the repentance of the accused. On the other hand, in this Cartagenian convent were celebrated at least two auto de f√©s, in 1648 and 1654.  Cemetery  The Dominican Convent of Cartagena, as was usual in the sacred sites at that time, was a very desirable place for the personalities of the city to bury their dead, acts that became massive in times of epidemics. During excavations carried out for the process of restoration of the Convent, a significant number of tombs of children in courtyards and corridors of the Convent were found, which gives clues for a study on infant mortality during the period.

Overview =Functional Additive Model= In these models, functional predictors ( X ) are paired with responses ( Y ) that can be either scalar or functional. The response can follow a continuous or discrete distribution and this distribution may be in the exponential family. In the latter case, there would be a canonical link that connects predictors and responses. Functional predictors (or responses) can be viewed as random trajectories generated by a square-integrable stochastic process. Using functional principal component analysis and the Karhunen-Lo√®ve expansion, these processes can be equivalently expressed as a countable sequence of their functional principal component scores (FPCs) and eigenfunctions. In the FAM the responses (scalar or functional) conditional on the predictor functions are modeled as function of the functional principal component scores of the predictor function in an additive structure. This model can be categorized as a Frequency Additive Model since it is additive in the predictor FPC scores. =Continuously Additive Model= The Continuously Additive Model (CAM) assumes additivity in the time domain. The functional predictors are assumed to be smooth across the time domain since the times contained in an interval domain are an uncountable set, an unrestricted time- additive model is not feasible. This motivates to approximate sums of additive functions by integrals so that the traditional vector additive model be replaced by a smooth additive surface. CAM can handle generalized responses paired with multiple functional predictors. =Functional Generalized Additive Model= The Functional Generalized Additive Model (FGAM) is an extension of generalized additive model with a scalar response and a functional predictor. This model can also deal with multiple functional predictors. The CAM and the FGAM are essentially equivalent apart from implementation details and therefore can be covered under one description. They can be categorized as Time-Additive Models. Functional Additive Model =Model= Functional Additive Model for scalar and functional responses respectively, are given by : E(Ymid X) = mu_Y + sum_{k=1}^infty f_k(xi_k) : E(Y(t)mid X) = mu_Y(t) + sum_{k=1}^infty sum_{m=1}^infty f_{km}(xi_k)psi_m(t), where xi_k and zeta_m are FPC scores of the processes X and Y respectively, phi_k and psi_m are the eigenfunctions of processes X and Y respectively, and f_k and f_{km} are arbitrary smooth functions. To ensure identifiability one may require, Ef_k(xi_k) = 0,quad k=1,2,ldots Ef_{km}(xi_k) = 0, k=1,2,ldots m=1,2,ldots =Implementation= The above model is considered under the assumption that the true FPC scores xi_k for predictor processes are known. In general, estimation in the generalized additive model requires backfitting algorithm or smooth backfitting to account for the dependencies between predictors. Now FPCs are always uncorrelated and if the predictor processes are assumed to be gaussian then the FPCs are independent. Then : E(Y-mu_Yxi_k)=E{E(Y-mu_YX)xi_k}=E{sum_{j=1}^{infty}f_j(xi_j)xi_k}=f_k(xi_k), similarly for functional responses : E(zeta_mxi_k)=f_{km}(xi_k), This simplifies the estimation and requires only one-dimensional smoothing of responses against individual predictor scores and will yield consistent estimates of f_j. In data analysis one needs to estimate xi_k before proceeding to infer the functions f_k and f_{km} , so there are errors in the predictors. functional principal component analysis generates estimates hat{xi_k} of xi_k for individual predictor trajectories along with estimates for eigenfunctions, eigenvalues, mean functions and covariance functions. Different smoothing methods can be applied to the data {hat{xi}_{ik},Y_i}_{i=1,...,n} and {hat{xi}_{ik},hat{zeta}_{im}}_{i=1,...,n} to estimate f_k and f_{km} respectively. The fitted Functional Additive Model for scalar response is given by : hat{E}(YX)=bar{Y}+sum_{k=1}^{K}hat{f_k}(xi_k), and the fitted Functional Additive Model for functional responses is by : hat{E}(Y(t)X)=hat{mu}_Y(t)+sum_{m=1}^{M}sum_{k=1}^{K}hat{f}_{km}(xi_k)hat{psi}_m(t), tin{T} Note: The truncation points K and M need to be chosen data- adaptively. Possible methods include pseudo-AIC, fraction of variance explained or minimization of prediction error or cross-validation. =Extensions= For the case of multiple functional predictors with a scalar response, the Functional Additive Model can be extended by fitting a functional regression which is additive in the FPCs of each of the predictor processes X_j,j=1,...,d . The model considered here is Additive Functional Score Model (AFSM) given by : E(YX_1,X_2,...,X_d)=sum_{j=1}^{d}sum_{k}f_{jk}(xi_{jk}) In case of multiple predictors the FPCs of different predictors are in general correlated and a smooth backfitting technique has been developed to obtain consistent estimates of the component functions f_{jk} when the predictors are observed with errors having unknown distribution. Continuously Additive Model =Model= Since the number of time points on an interval domain is uncountable, an unrestricted time-additive model E(YX)=sum_{{tin[0,T]}}f_t(X(t)) is not feasible. Thus a sequence of time-additive models is considered on an increasingly dense finite time grid t_1,t_2,...,t_m in T leading to : E(YX(t_1 ),...,X(t_m))= E(Y)+sum_{j=1}^mf_j(X_{t_j}) where f_j(cdot)=g(t_j,cdot) for a smooth bivariate function g with E({g(t_j,X(t_j)})=0 (to ensure identifiability). In the limit mrightarrowinfty this becomes the continuously additive model : E(YX)=E(Y)+lim_{mtoinfty}frac{1}{m}sum_{j=1}^mg{t_j,X(t_j)}=E(Y)+int_{T}g{t,X(t)}dt. =Special Cases= Generalized Functional Linear Model For g{t,X(t)}=beta(t){X(t)-EX(t)} the model reduces to generalized functional linear model Functional Transformation Model For non- Gaussian predictor process, g{t,X(t)}=beta(t)[zeta{X(t)}-Ezeta{X(t)}, where zeta is a smooth transformation of X(t) reduces CAM to a Functional Transformation model. =Extensions= This model has also been introduced with a different notation under the name Functional Generalized Additive Model (FGAM). Adding a link function h to the mean-response and applying a probability transformation G_t to X(t) yields the FGAM given by : h(E(YX)=theta_0+int_{T}F[G_t{X_i(t)},t]dt, where theta_0 is the intercept.

Jones was born in Upton-upon-Severn in Worcestershire and developed a considerable reputation as a fine printer, printing among other work elegant stationery. He operated a press at \\"The Sign of The Dolphin next to Dr Johnson's House in Gough Square\\", London and designed the custom typeface \\"Venezia\\", one of many fine printing types of the period based on the work of fifteenth-century engraver Nicolas Jenson. At his home in Monkbarns, Northwood, Middlesex, he built up a notable library, which he printed an anthology of; it was sold at auction in 1936. In 1921, he was hired by the British branch of the Mergenthaler Linotype Company to develop new and more elegant typefaces that would enhance their reputation; at the time hot metal typesetting machines were not fully accepted by fine printers who generally used hand-set foundry type. His projects included Granjon and Estienne, two families based on the typefaces of the French renaissance, a Baskerville revival, and Georgian. Later Linotype employee Walter Tracy praised these designs, noting his partnership with Linotype draughtsman Harry Smith, who drew production drawings for the typefaces at Linotype's Altrincham factory, as a major partner in their success. Jones married Eliza Sophia Ann Durham, who predeceased him in 1912. He retired in 1938 and died at Droitwich Spa in his home county of Worcestershire on 14 May 1942.

He was an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court from 2017 to 2018. Early life Samuel Reyes Martires was born on January 2, 1949 in Palapag, Samar (now in Northern Samar). His father died when he was five years old. When he was in high school, he wanted to become a priest; he sought permission from his mother to become a missionary but was denied. Some of his relatives were Catholic priests: two of his father's cousins were Benedictines while Cardinal Julio Rosales, the Archbishop of Cebu, was a relative of his grandfather. According to Martires, he continued to dream of priesthood until he met his would-be wife Cecilia. Martires attended Manuel L. Quezon University in Quezon City and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1971. He then earned his Bachelor of Laws from San Beda College in 1975 and passed the bar exam the following year, becoming the first lawyer in his family. At San Beda, he became a brother of the Lex Talionis Fraternitas. =Early legal career= After qualifying as a lawyer, he worked as a legal officer for the Department of Public Works, Transportation and Communication until 1979. He then became an assistant department manager at the Ministry of Human Settlements until 1984. Martires was also involved in some small business ventures. After the 1986 People Power Revolution, he received an offer to become a judge, which he declined, citing the low salary and their ill reputation of being corrupt. His mother, however, wanted him to join the judiciary. Beginning in 1987, he went into private practice as a litigator handling mostly civil cases. Martires enrolled in the Master of Laws program of the University of Santo Tomas but only earned 27 units. =Agoo RTC judge= In June 1998, a month after his mother's death, he submitted his application to become a trial court judge. In July 2000, he became the presiding judge of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 32 of Agoo, La Union. In 2002, Judge Caroline Pangan of the Rosario, La Union Municipal Trial Court filed an administrative complaint to the Supreme Court against Martires and fellow Agoo RTC judge Clifton U. Ganay. She accused the two judges of \\"gross ignorance of the law, incompetence, abuse of authority and dereliction of duty\\". Martires allegedly refused to issue a warrant of arrest for a murder suspect despite the presence of evidence and the urgings of the prosecution. The complaint was dismissed for lack of merit. Supreme Court associate justice President Rodrigo Duterte appointed him on March 2, 2017. Prior to his appointment, he had served as Associate Justice of Sandiganbayan from 2005 to 2017. On May 11, 2018, Samuel Martires was one of the eight justices who voted in favor of the quo warranto petition filed by Solicitor General Jose Calida against then-Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno. Ombudsman of the Philippines On July 26, 2018, he was appointed as the 6th Ombudsman by President Rodrigo Duterte, replacing then-outgoing Ombudsman Conchita Carpio- Morales. In September 2020, Martires issued a memorandum circular regarding the releasing of copies of the Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Net Worth (SALN) of public officials. The said guidelines were criticized for adding more restrictions on who can acquire copies of the documents. Under the new guidelines, the people who can request copies of SALNs are the public officials who filed them or their representatives, a court as part of a case, and the Ombudsman's field investigators. The public, especially the media, are now required to present a notarized letter from the public official whose SALN they intend to see. The memorandum cited \\"The Code of Conduct for Public Officials\\" (Republic Act No. 6713), however, the aforementioned law allows journalists to obtain copies of officials' SALNs and report on them. He also announced that his office will stop conducting lifestyle checks on public officials, reasoning that having a luxurious lifestyle does not prove that an official is corrupt. He also criticized lifestyle checks as \\"illogical\\" and \\"purely\\" based on estimates. He also claimed that the SALNs and lifestyle checks are used by the media and political rivals to \\"extort\\" government officials. In frustration, Martires suggested that the Office of the Ombudsman should be abolished, citing the lack of witnesses and their refusal to testify or file affidavits makes investigations more difficult and thus renders the office unnecessary. His predecessor, Conchita Carpio-Morales, criticized his proposal, arguing that it will \\"open floodgates to the commission of more corrupt activities.\\" References - 1949 births Living people Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of the Philippines Filipino lawyers Filipino judges San Beda University alumni Ombudsmen in the Philippines University of Santo Tomas alumni Duterte Administration personnel ","title":"Samuel Martires"},{"id":"53456733","text":"Montreux '77 is an album by pianist Tommy Flanagan.

He studied piano and violin before switching to drums. As a teenager, he became passionate about jazz and formed a small ensemble with his friends. This troupe toured France and based itself in Paris in 1931, where it scored silent short films by Charlie Chaplin and others. Alongside the orchestras of Ray Ventura and Jacques H√©lian, Adison's band (often billed as Fred Adison and His Collegians) was one of the principal French backing groups for singers and films in the 1930s. Adison also recorded copiously, and released many 78rpm commercial recordings during this time. After the onset of World War II, he toured with Django Reinhardt in September‚ÄìOctober 1940, and continued writing music for film. He was imprisoned in a Nazi war camp in 1943. Following the war, he led a new big band. In 1952, Charles Spiessert, owner of Cirque Pinder, hired Fred Adison to conduct the circus orchestra, a position he held until 1962. He accompanied Luis Mariano and Gloria Lasso during this time and recorded several albums of circus music. Following this Adison went into semi-retirement, occasionally playing with small ensembles and dance orchestras on television.

In this wild nature, waterfalls more and more attract the attention of hikers, tourists and fishermen.

She was renowned for a number of major public commissions and for her landscaping and interior design for the family home at Emu Plains. Her early compositions explored colour and formal geometric abstraction; her work became more fluid and expressionist by the early 1960s. She showed extensively in Australia and in several international travelling exhibitions. She won at least fourteen awards and prizes. The Penrith Regional Gallery and Lewers Bequest now stands on her property at Emu Plains. Early life and education Margo Lewers, n√©e Plate, was born in Mosman, Sydney, to Adolph Gustav Plate (1874‚Äì1913), a German-born grazier, seaman, writer and artist,A Restless Life: Journeys through the Pacific, Asia and Australasia, Cassi Plate (ed.), Lewers Bequest & Penrith Regional Gallery, 1997 and his English-born wife Elsie Gill, n√©e Burton. She was the older sister of artist Carl Plate. In the late 1920s she attended Antonio Dattilo-Rubbo's evening art classes where she met her future husband, Gerald Lewers. Travelling to Europe with Gerald, Lewers studied at the Central School of Arts and Crafts, London in 1934 and 1935. In Sydney, between 1940 and 1945, she completed further evening classes with Desiderius Orban. Career Early in her career, Margo Lewers opened the interior design shop Notanda Galleries. The shop was based on Bauhaus principles, operating as a design consultancy, and stocked pottery, furniture, handprinted objects and timber objects. During this period, Lewers worked on linen and ceramics toward a solo show at Argosy Gallery. She also worked on creating complementary interior design pieces for the family home, designing wooden furniture to match a cream base in ceramics and linen. Notanda Galleries operated from 1935 to 1939, closing due to wartime restrictions. In the 1940s, Lewers became a member of the Sydney branch of the Contemporary Art Society and exhibited in their annual exhibitions. The Art Gallery of New South Wales' first art purchase from the Contemporary Art Society was Margo Lewers' work Composition in Blue. In 1951, Margo Lewers and Gerald Lewers, with their two children Tanya and Darani, moved to Emu Plains. In 1952, Lewers and Gerald held a two-person exhibition at the David Jones Art Gallery, exhibiting painting and sculpture respectively. James Gleeson reviewed Lewers' painting as ambitious but requiring better development of technique. Following the initiative in landscape design and outdoor sculpture that the pair made in their new home, in 1957, Lewers and Gerald were commissioned to create a garden of pebbles, cacti and sandstone for the MLC Building in North Sydney. In 1960, Lewers held a solo exhibition at Gallery A, an important contemporary art space in Sydney. Two years later, Gerald passed away, and in 1965 Lewers completed his major public commission, \\"Expansion\\", for the Reserve Bank in Canberra. In 1966, Lewers held a solo show of paintings at Macquarie Galleries, and in 1968 she received a further major commission from the Reserve Bank of Australia for a tapestry for their boardroom. =Reception and Legacy= Margo Lewers exhibited frequently throughout her lifetime in both group and solo shows and her work was collected by major state galleries. In 1967, she was the subject of the winning portrait for the annual Archibald Prize, painted by Judy Cassab. While still alive, Lewers began the process of bequeathing her home and the couple's collection of artworks to the local community. In 1981, the Penrith Regional Gallery and Lewers Bequest opened. The site houses Lewers House, Anchers House, a purpose-built gallery, cafe and landscaped gardens. Since her death, Lewers has received one major retrospective in the form of the Margo Lewers Retrospective at SH Ervin Gallery, curated by Pamela Bell, 2002. The exhibition toured to six regional galleries. She has also been included in a small number of group shows. These include Women of Influence, Ivan Dougherty Gallery, Sydney, 2005 and Sydney 6, Newcastle Art Gallery, Newcastle, 2015.

He is perhaps best known for being placed on life support two days before he was executed by lethal injection in Texas. A native of Texas, Long grew up mostly in California. He began getting into legal trouble early in life; while still a preteen, he was admitted to a California reformatory, and he spent many years addicted to drugs. In 1986, Long killed three women after an argument in Lancaster, Texas. He was never tried for any other murders, but he also confessed to killing a gas station attendant in a 1978 beating in San Bernardino, California, and to killing a former boss in a 1983 fire in Bay City, Texas. While on death row in Texas, Long confessed to setting a fire that killed two West Texas women in 1986. Ernest Willis was already on death row for the crime. Long's confession was ultimately found to lack credibility, but it sparked new interest in the validity of Willis's conviction. When arson investigators reopened the investigation, they felt that an electrical issue most likely caused the fire. Willis was released from prison in 2004, having spent 17 years on death row. On December 6, 1999, two days before Long was scheduled to be executed, he took an overdose of prescription drugs and was hospitalized in Galveston, Texas. Officials in Texas refused to delay the execution. Long had been placed on a ventilator after the overdose, but his condition improved significantly by the next day. He was placed on a medically supervised flight back to Huntsville on December 8 and was executed as scheduled. Early life Long was born in Tom Green County, Texas. He lived in California as a child and began to get in trouble with the law at an early age. Long's brother and sister said that their father was an abusive alcoholic who often neglected them. They said that their mother died when Long was ten years old and that Long's behavior became more problematic at that point. Long was sent to foster homes, and he was enrolled in a reformatory by the age of 12. He began regularly drinking alcohol around that time and he subsequently used illicit drugs, including heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine, for many years. He worked as a cable television technician. Triple murder In 1986, after being expelled from an alcohol rehabilitation program in Little Rock, Arkansas, Long was hitchhiking when 37-year-old Donna Sue Jester gave him a ride and allowed him to stay at her home in Lancaster, Texas. They lived with Jester's 64-year-old blind and bedridden adoptive mother named Dalpha Lorene Jester, and with a third woman, 20-year-old Laura Lee Owens. Long and Owens began a romantic relationship. The women were killed with a hatchet about a week after Long arrived. Not long after the murders, Long was arrested for drunken driving in Leon County, Texas, and he told jailers about killing the three women in Lancaster. The women's bodies had not been discovered at that point, so Long's story was not taken seriously and he was released from jail. A Leon County jailer said that before Long's release, he woke up Sheriff Royce Wilson; the jailer said he was told to forget about Long's murder claims. Wilson said that he did not hear anything about a possible murder. When police discovered the bodies in Lancaster, they found the weapon, which had been wiped off and wrapped in a towel. Police focused on Long as a suspect because Jester's diary entries described how she had met Long and allowed him to move in with her. A warrant was issued for Long's arrest based on Jester's diary entries, and Long was apprehended in Austin for public intoxication on October 24. He had hitchhiked, and the driver called police when Long passed out in the vehicle. Long gave an alias upon his arrest, but officers in Austin had already been warned to be on the lookout for him. Fingerprints after the arrest confirmed Long's identity. Long admitted to killing the three women because they criticized him for his drinking. While he was in police custody, Long also confessed to two unsolved murders. He admitted that he fatally beat gas station attendant James Carnell with a tire iron in 1978 in San Bernardino, California, because Carnell had overcharged him for the repair of a tire. He said that he started a fire that killed his former boss, Bob Neal Rogers, in 1983 in Bay City, Texas. Long indicated that he thought his criminal tendencies would get better with time, but he said that they were getting worse. He said that Texas seemed to fairly dispense the death penalty, and he indicated that he was \\"pretty much ready to call it a day with [his] demented personality.\\" Trial At his trial in the Jester case, Long's defense was that he had psychiatric problems, including schizophrenia. He said that he had sustained multiple head injuries, and he believed that some of his actions were related to being possessed by Satan. Long told a psychiatrist that Donna Jester's home had a foul smell and that he became agitated around foul odors because he associated them with his mother's death. Long suspected that dead bodies were buried behind Jester's home. He said that he retrieved the hatchet on the day of the murders because he thought the three women in the Jester home were conspiring against him. The women were trying to jeopardize his relationship with Owens, he said. Psychologist William Hester testified for the defense, opining that Long was likely psychotic ‚Äì and may have been hallucinating from alcohol withdrawal ‚Äì at the time of the crime. The prosecution pointed to inconsistencies between two of Hester's interviews with Long, and they highlighted one of Hester's earlier written notes, which said Hester found no evidence that Long was insane. Testifying for the state, psychiatrist James Grigson said that Long had antisocial personality disorder, which he said was not considered a mental disease or defect. Grigson said that Long \\"understood the difference between right and wrong\\" at the time of the crime. At one point during the trial, Long stood up and yelled to the jury that he was guilty, saying that he had never wanted to advance the insanity defense in the first place. Long was convicted of murder, and a jury sentenced him to the death penalty on February 10, 1987. Time on death row Three years after arriving on death row, Long gave investigators a three-hour confession in which he admitted to starting a 1986 house fire that killed two women in the West Texas town of Iraan. Ernest Willis had been found guilty of that crime, and he had been sentenced to the death penalty in 1987. The prosecutor in the case had described the evidence against Willis as circumstantial. Long refused to testify before an appeals court in the Willis case. The videotape of Long's confession was thought to be admissible in court, but it would only be effective if evidence could be located to corroborate Long's story.White, pp. 59‚Äì60. Long's confession helped the Willis case to attract more attention from attorneys. Appeals lawyers spent several years looking for evidence to support Long's version of the events. Witnesses and arson experts said that several details in the case were consistent with Long's confession, including his admission to the prior arson in Bay City and an analysis that showed the Iraan fire could have been accelerated with a mixture of Everclear and Wild Turkey as Long claimed.White, p. 60. In 2004, Willis was released from prison because new fire investigators looked at the case and determined that the fire was more likely caused by an electrical problem than by arson. According to author Welsh White, Long's confession was probably untrue but it was \\"the catalyst that precipitated the massive investigation that resulted in Willis's exoneration.\\"White, pp. 65‚Äì66. In Long's own death penalty case, he lost a 1991 appeal to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. The next year, the U.S. Supreme Court denied his request for writ of certiorari. His execution was scheduled for September 1992, but two days before he was set to die, he received a stay of execution to pursue further appeals. Overdose Long exhausted his appeals and was scheduled for execution on December 8, 1999. Two days before the scheduled execution, Long was found unresponsive after taking an overdose of antipsychotic medication. He was placed on life support and admitted to an intensive care unit in Galveston, Texas. On December 7, Long improved enough that his breathing tube was able to be removed, and his condition was upgraded from critical to serious on December 8. He remained on oxygen. State officials asked intensive care physician Alexander Duarte to sign an affidavit stating that it would be safe to transport Long to Huntsville. Duarte refused, saying that under normal circumstances Long would have stayed in intensive care for another day or two. The doctor warned that Long still required continual medical care. State officials arranged a medically supervised transport from Galveston to Huntsville via airplane. Execution Long's attorneys appealed to Governor George W. Bush for a 30-day stay of execution because of Long's hospitalization. Bush was out of state campaigning for the Republican presidential nomination, so Lt. Governor Rick Perry was left with the decision. Perry refused to grant a stay, and a spokesperson for Bush said that the governor agreed with Perry's decision. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected Long's final appeal, and he was taken to the execution chamber. He was executed, as originally scheduled, on December 8, 1999. Long gave a last statement, saying: > Ah, just ah sorry y'all. I think of tried everything I could to get in touch > with y'all to express how sorry I am. I, I never was right after that > incident happened. I sent a letter to somebody, you know a letter outlining > what I feel about everything. But anyway I just wanted, right after that > apologize to you. I'm real sorry for it. I was raised by the California > Youth Authority, I can't really pin point where it started, what happened > but really believe that's just the bottom line, what happened to me was in > California.

It covers a region of sedimentary islands and floodplains at the mouth of the Amazon that is flooded twice daily as the ocean tides push the river waters onto the land. The flooded forests provide food for a wide variety of fruit-eating fish, aquatic mammals, birds and other fauna. It has no protected areas and is threatened by cattle and water-buffalo ranching, logging and fruit plantations. Location The Maraj√≥ v√°rzea is at the mouth of the Amazon River. It covers coastal areas of the states of Par√° and Amap√°, with an area of . Water levels are affected by freshwater flowing down the river and by tidal flows from the Atlantic Ocean. The v√°rzea forest in the ecoregion starts where the Xingu River joins the Amazon, which begins to broaden out. It covers the west of Maraj√≥ Island and many smaller islands in the Amazon channel, as well as parts of the mainland to the north and south of the river mouth including a small area of French Guiana. The nutrient-rich sediments from the river are deposited on the islands. The Maraj√≥ v√°rzea ecoregion adjoins the Xingu-Tocantins-Araguaia moist forests and the Tocantins/Pindare moist forests to the south, and the Uatuma-Trombetas moist forests and an area of Guianan savanna to the north. The Gurupa v√°rzea is upstream along the Amazon. There are strips of Amazon-Orinoco-Southern Caribbean mangroves along the coast. The Amap√° mangroves are found to the north of the Amazon's mouth and the Par√° mangroves to the south. Physical The Maraj√≥ v√°rzea covers flooded land at the mouth of the Amazon River. There are many islands including the Maraj√≥ island and the smaller Porcos, Par√°, Mutut√≠ and Uituquara islands. The estuary is a recent lowland that has been forming during the present Holocene epoch, and is surrounded by Tertiary deposits. The constant action of tides and river flow form a maze of channels. Twice daily the tides push river discharge onto the low-lying land to a depth of . Soils in the many islands formed from the Amazon sediments are typically mottled clay with poor drainage. The ecoregion also includes slightly higher ground that is usually not flooded. The east of Maraj√≥ island is made of older Tertiary sediments. It is covered by flooded savanna and humid terra firme forest. Climate The K√∂ppen climate classification is \\"Am\\": equatorial with monsoon rainfall. Average annual temperatures are about , ranging from about Average annual precipitation is about . Monthly rainfall varies from in October to over in March. Ecology The ecoregion is in the Neotropical realm and the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome. =Flora= River traffic in the fluvial zone Vegetation is dominated by palms, and is shorter and less diverse than in surrounding areas. The most common palm species are murumuru (Astrocaryum murumuru), raffia (Raphia taedigera), a√ßa√≠ (Euterpe oleracea), maripa (Attalea maripa), bacaba (Oenocarpus bacaba), patau√° (Oenocarpus bataua), buriti (Mauritia flexuosa), ubu√ßu (Manicaria saccifera), cashapona (Socratea exorrhiza) and several species of Geonoma palms. There are large stands of the commercially valuable buriti and acai palms. Among other common trees in the tidal v√°rzea are the timber species Virola surinamensis, Cedrelinga castanaeformis, Ceiba pentandra, Calycophyllum brasiliensis and other large trees such as Ficus species, Macrolobium acaciifolium, Pachira aquatica, Symphonia globulifera, Triplaris surinamensis and Mora paraensis. The shrub Machaerium lanatum forms dense thickets along the banks of the rivers. There are large lianas in the flooded areas such as Strychnos blackii, Landolphia paraensis and Guatteria scandens. The ecoregion also includes seasonally flooded forest and permanently flooded igap√≥ swamp forest. =Fauna= The v√°rzea forest provides a mechanism for rapid capture and release of nutrients, and hosts many species of freshwater fish and aquatic mammals. There is greater diversity of fauna than in surrounding areas. 99 species of mammals have been reported. Big cats include jaguar (Panthera onca) and cougar (Puma concolor). Fruiting trees such as the buriti palm are sources of food for grazing animals such as gray brocket (Mazama gouazoubira), red brocket (Mazama americana), and capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris). The estuary is home to large fish that swim through the flooded forest where they eat and spread fruit from the trees. Fish include pacus (Metynnis and Mylossoma genera), tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum), pirarucus (Arapaima gigas), and sardinhas (Triportheus angulatus). Endangered species include the white-cheeked spider monkey (Ateles marginatus), black bearded saki (Chiropotes satanas), giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis), green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) and hawksbill sea turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata). The endemic short-tailed opossum (Monodelphis maraxina) is endangered. Other endemic mammals are the seven-banded armadillo (Dasypus septemcinctus), Recife broad-nosed bat (Platyrrhinus recifinus), Brazilian funnel-eared bat (Natalus espiritosantensis), Greenhall's dog-faced bat (Cynomops greenhalli), silvery marmoset (Mico argentatus), red-handed tamarin (Saguinus midas), Azara's night monkey (Aotus azarae) and crab-eating fox (Cerdocyon thous). The ecoregion is home to the endangered West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus). thumb There are at least 540 species of birds. Aquatic bird species include heron and egret of the Egretta and Ardea genera, whistling duck (Dendrocygna species), sharp-tailed ibis (Cercibis oxycerca), Theristicus species and roseate spoonbill (Platalea ajaja). Endemic birds include white-bellied seedeater (Sporophila leucoptera), grassland yellow finch (Sicalis luteola), chalk-browed mockingbird (Mimus saturninus), tropical pewee (Contopus cinereus), rufous-throated antbird (Gymnopithys rufigula), black-breasted puffbird (Notharchus pectoralis) and plain-bellied emerald (Amazilia leucogaster). Endangered birds include the scaled spinetail (Cranioleuca muelleri) and yellow-bellied seedeater (Sporophila nigricollis). Conservation status The ecoregion is in a region of the Amazon at the mouth of the great waterway that has long been heavily used by humans. It is vulnerable, and has no protected areas. Cattle and water buffalo ranches have degraded natural grasslands and forests and caused loss of food sources for capybaras, manatees and fruteating fish. Commercial logging on Maraj√≥ island has almost eliminated some valuable native tree species. Stands of A√ßa√≠ palm planted for their commercially valuable fruit have replaced stands of native buriti palm. Global warming will force tropical species to migrate uphill to find areas with suitable temperature and rainfall. Low, flat ecoregions such as the Maraj√≥ v√°rzea are extremely vulnerable.

History Frognall was designed by the architect James Gall in 1888 in the Italianate style that was popular during the boom period of 1880s Melbourne. It was built between the years of 1889-91 for the prominent timber merchant Clarence Hicks, although he did not stay long as he was forced to sell during the financial collapse of 1893. In 1901 the building was purchased by the Laycock family who stayed there until 1942 when they offered the building to the Commonwealth Government to help with the war effort. The house became part of the RAAF communications network during the war and was occupied by the RAAF for more than 40 years afterwards.  Architecture  Frognall is an example of the Italianate style mansion which is commonly associated with the boom period of Melbourne architecture in the 1880s, although it is unusual in the extent of its ornamentation. It has a particularly rich level of cement render detailing, including arcaded and balustraded loggia. The grandeur of the building is enhanced by its pedimented entrance and deep bracketed eaves. The tower is capped at each side by projecting broken pediments. Frognall is typical of the wave of large mansions which were built in Melbourne's eastern suburbs during the 1880s (other examples include Raheen, Kew and Stonington mansion. However it is a rare example that has retained almost its entire original sub-division lot of 1859 and the core of the decorative garden that was created when the building was completed. It is also one of the rare boom period mansions which have retained their service wing, and stable and coach house block in original condition.

Her work often examines Indigenous Australian histories and she has received a number of high profile commissions for public spaces. Early life and education Judy Watson was born in Mundubbera, Queensland in 1959. She is a Brisbane-based, Waanyi artist. She was educated at the Darling Downs Institute of Advanced Education Toowoomba, where she received a Diploma of Creative Arts in 1979; at the University of Tasmania where she received a bachelor's degree (1980‚Äì82); and at Monash University where she completed a graduate diploma in 1986. At Tasmania she learned many techniques, among them lithography which has influenced her entire body of work. Career Watson trained as a print-maker and her work in painting, video and installation often relies upon the use of layers to create a sense of different realities co-existing. As an Indigenous artist, the depiction of the land has an ongoing significance in her practice. She won the Mo√´t & Chandon Fellowship in 1995, allowing her to travel to France and later exhibit there. She represented Australia at the Venice Biennale in 1997, along with Yvonne Koolmatrie and Emily Kame Kngwarreye. In 2005, for French architect Jean Nouvel's Mus√©e du quai Branly she constructed a site-specific work for the building along with a number of other key Aboriginal artists. A film was made about the project, titled The French Connection. Her work is often highly political, however it is rarely didactic. She describes her attitude to political art as follows: \\"Art as a vehicle for invention and social change can be many things, it can be soft, hard, in-your- face confrontational, or subtle and discreet. I try and choose the latter approach for much of my work, a seductive beautiful exterior with a strong message like a deadly poison dart that insinuates itself into the consciousness of the viewer without them being aware of the package until it implodes and leaks its contents.\\" She has been commissioned by the City of Sydney to create a major public work of art for their Eora Journey arts program. The sculpture, titled bara and expected to be in place by 2020, will be located at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney. The installation consists of a representation of bara, or fish hooks made for thousands of years by women from the local Eora nation. =Themes= In the book on Watson's work, blood language (2009) her practice is divided into a number of themes: water, skin, poison, dust and blood, ochre, bones, driftnet. The list indicates the range of natural and cultural forms that underpin her practice. Watson's recent work can be understood as part of the archival turn in contemporary art. She examines Indigenous Australian histories. For example, a preponderance of aboriginal blood (2005) was commissioned by the State Library of Queensland to celebrate the Queensland centenary of women‚Äôs suffrage and forty years of Aboriginal suffrage. The work uses documents from the Queensland State Archives about the way Aboriginal people were precluded from voting. Before suffrage was granted in 1965, eligibility to vote was based on the percentage of Aboriginal blood, hence Watson‚Äôs title her series. The series was recently acquired by Tate Modern in London. Other series that examine history and the archive include the holes in the land (2015). This series of six engravings is about the loss of Aboriginal cultural patrimony. In four of the six images Aboriginal cultural objects held in the British Museum are depicted.

Sardis (modern Sart in the Manisa Province of Turkey) gained reputation and fame as one of the Seven Churches of Asia (or Seven Churches of the Apocalypse) when it was addressed by John in the Book of Revelation. Under pressure from curious archaeology enthusiasts, the Turkish government allowed for excavations to commence in 1910, during which the first of several Byzantine style churches were discovered.

Church M: Urban expansion through ecclesiastical architecture  \\"Church M\\" was a small, fourth-century mortuary chapel and the earliest extant Christian church at Sardis built on the abandoned grounds of the Hellenistic Greek Temple of Artemis on the Acropolis. It was discovered in the early 1900s by renowned professor of Art and Archaeology at Princeton, Howard Crosby Butler (1872-1922) on the First Sardis Expedition. Its close proximity to Church EA suggests an attempt at urban expansion through the creation of a ‚ÄòChristian quarter‚Äô outside the walls of Sardis.  Church EA: the Original Basilica  Church EA was a simple aisled basilica located in the Pactolus valley just beyond the southwest walls of Sardis. Although there are no known historical records of its initial construction, identification of coinage found during excavation suggests that Church EA may have been built in the middle of the fourth century AD, nearly a century before the first Christian building of its kind was erected in Constantinople (Church of St. John of the Stoudios, 453AD). Extant ornamental and architectural fragments include double-engaged support columns, ornately carved revetment door-frames, and modeled plaster decor styled with lozenge and scale patterned borders and crosses, some of which may be attributed to renovations conducted in later centuries. An expansive and vividly colored mosaic floor was uncovered in the buildings north aisle, featuring interwoven geometric shapes composed of irregularly cut tesserae, and evidence for painted walls of rich blues and black exists in over 400 fragments of brick and plaster. Although little is known about the original functioning of Church EA, evidence of its careful craftsmanship both suggest that it was a substantial place of worship in Asia Minor and that the Christian community had already reached a point of prominence in Sardis by the mid-fourth-century. Church EA underwent numerous renovations and expansions including the addition of an east building and west wing, a large square atrium, a north courtyard, and numerous architectural carvings, all of which date prior to the early seventh-century. Based on subsequent additions and repairs to the site throughout the medieval period, it is thought that the building remained in active use until as late as the thirteenth century.  Building D  Building D was a massive imperial monument built in the sixth-century. Although there is no extant textual or historical evidence that Building D functioned as a place of worship, careful excavation and illustrated reconstruction of the site reveals characteristics indicative of Byzantine ecclesiastic architecture of the period. Remains of brick and cut-stone piers are thought to have once supported colossal vaulted domes, and the compartmentalized base structure suggests a central hall, or nave, and lateral corridors of a church similar to those of the Urban Basilica of Hierapolis at Frigia. While Building D can be counted among the rare examples of Christian architecture at Sardis, it is unique in that it is located in what was a densely populated area within the city walls, and its craftsmanship was of a lesser quality than that of Churches EA and M. Moreover, its construction illustrates the shift in style that occurred in Asia Minor from the simple basilica of the fourth-century to the massive vaulted domes preferred merely two centuries later.  Church E  Church E was a compact, quintuple domed building of brick and marble constructed directly over the leveled ruins of Church EA around the thirteenth-century. The mismatched, collage-like use of such materials as damaged ashlar blocks and Attic style column bases indicates that Church E was made entirely of repurposed components. Traces of thin glass and gold tesserae are evidentiary of windows and limited mosaics, although much of the walls surface seems to have been decorated with murals. A small pit in the church‚Äôs south aisle (known as the ‚ÄúPseudocrypt‚Äù) was excavated in 1963, revealing two graves thought to be the reburied remains of men who were lauded as saints. It is believed that when Sardis was taken under Turkish rule in the fourteenth- century, Church E was repurposed for industrial use until it was destroyed by an earthquake that leveled much of the area in 1595.

It was released on iOS on March 1, 2017.  Gameplay  The goal of each level of Incidence is to get a ball into a hole in a set number of shots (4 shots to be precise). The player launches the ball by dragging back (which sets the power and angle of the shot). Once the ball is launched will bounce against the level's walls six times. On the sixth bounce the ball stops ready for the player to hit again. If the player runs out of shots (goes over par), the ball explodes and the player has to start the level over. If the player gets the ball into the hole, the player advances to the next level. As the player progresses the levels get increasingly more difficult to play as new elements such as spikes and bouncy walls are introduced.  Reception  Incidence received mixed reviews. Gamezebo gave the game 3.5 stars calling it a \\"beautiful and challenging minimalist action-puzzle game\\". They praised the game's simplicity and that the puzzles are \\"frustratingly challenging but nothing feels impossible\\" while criticizing the fact the game is sluggish on older devices and that \\"100 levels is impressive, but still doesn't quite feel like enough\\".

She served as Associate Principal of Mount Holyoke Seminary, 1872-1888; and as Professor of Theism and Christian Evidences, 1888-1890. Early years and education Anna Cheney Edwards was born in Northampton, Massachusetts, 31 July 1835. Her father, Charles, was sixth in descent from Alexander Edwards, one of the early settlers of the town. Her mother, Ruth White, of Spencer, Massachusetts, was also of Puritan ancestry. Granddaughter of Nathaniel Edwards and Rachel Clapp, his wife; great-granddaughter of Benjamin Clapp and Phebe Boynton, his wife; and great-great-granddaughter of Jonathan Clapp and Submit Strong, his wife. Edwards outlived all eight of her siblings. There was an early fondness for books and a predilection for teaching. Edwards remembers making up her mind, on her first day of her attending school, at the age of four years, that she was to be a teacher. This was an inherited fondness, as her father and grandfather had successively taught the district school near the old Edwards homestead. Her great-grandfather, Nathaniel Edwards, was worthy of mention in the days of higher education for women, for his labors in the instruction of the girls of his neighborhood during vacation periods, because in his time, they were not allowed to attend school with the boys during the regular terms. The teaching career began at the age of 16, after Edwards had passed through the public schools of Northampton, in an outer district of the town. After two years of experience, she entered Mount Holyoke Seminary (now Mount Holyoke College), South Hadley, Massachusetts, in September, 1853. At the end of one year, her studies were interrupted by three years more of teaching, after which she returned to the seminary and was graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in July, 1859. In 1888, the degree of Master of Arts was conferred upon her by Burlington University (now University of Vermont. Career Edwards was recalled as assistant teacher in the following year and was a member of the Holyoke faculty most of her career thereafter. She was absent at one period for about two years, her health being somewhat impaired, and from 1866 to 1868, she was principal of Lake Erie Seminary, Plainville, Ohio. She spent 18 months in travel in Europe, and in vacations, she took separate trips to New Orleans, California, Alaska and various parts of the United States and Canada. She was appointed second associate principal of Mount Holyoke Seminary in 1872, and first associate in 1883. A college charter having been obtained for that institution in 1888, she was made professor of theism and Christian evidences, and instructor of ancient literature. In scientific studies, she shared the enthusiasm and the wide reading of Lydia White Shattuck, the botanist, and became herself an earnest student and teacher of geology. She was identified with her alma mater in its religious character and work. For the use of her classes she printed in 1877 a volume of \\"Notes on Ancient Literature.\\" She gave lectures to classes and to ladies' literary societies on a variety of topics. Her more public activities were in the way of papers and addresses before the different associations of Holyoke alumnae and in connection with women's missionary meetings. From 1876, served as vice- president of the Hampshire County Branch of the Woman's Board of Missions. She died in 1930.

It has been protected by the central government as a National Historic Site since 1999. Overview The Tangotai site is located on a sloping hill between the Mabechi and Dobashi Rivers, near the Pacific Ocean seacoast. The surrounding area has a high concentration of ruins from the J≈çmon through Kofun periods, including the remnants of settlements, graveyards and smaller clusters of kofun as well as a ceremonial burial site for horses. An estimated 100 tombs were uncovered at the Tangotai site during construction of the ‚ÄúHachinohe New Town‚Äù urban development project in 1987. The tombs are estimated to date from the late 7th century to the mid-9th century, and each consists of a circular mound between four and nine meters in diameter, covering a stone burial chamber consisting of a central pit with a wooden coffin. Numerous grave goods were uncovered from the 29 tombs which were full excavated in 1987-1988, including shards of Haji and Sue pottery, fragments of swords and metal agricultural implements, and thousands of spherical, magatama and tubular beads. Of particular interest was a decorated sword hilt discovered in Tomb 15, with a design similar to those made in Baekje on the Korean Peninsula in the late 6th century. Within Tomb 25 a Wad≈çkaichin coin minted in 708 AD was discovered. The relics are on display at the Hachinohe City Museum. The Tagotai Kofun cluster dates from a time when the area was still populated by the Emishi people and was beyond the control of the central Yamato government, yet it indicates the penetration and survival of late Kofun period culture beyond the political bounds of the central government, and hints at possible direct contact between the northern T≈çhoku region of Japan and the Korean peninsula in prehistoric times. In 1999, approximately 7000 hectares of the site received protection by the Japanese government as a National Historic Site. It is located approximately 10 minutes by car from Hachinohe Station.

She was an expert on the history of San Francisco and the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Early life and education Hansen was born in 1925 in Berkeley, California. She moved to San Francisco as a child, and lived there for the rest of her life. She graduated from Lowell High School and attended San Francisco State College briefly, but did not earn a degree. Career At age 17, Hansen began working part-time at the Presidio branch of the San Francisco Public Library. She then moved to the main branch, and by 1963 she was in charge of the California collection of the library. In 1972, she was named city archivist by Mayor Joseph Alioto. In 1963, Hansen began to research the identities of those killed in 1906 earthquake. In 1989, Hansen co-authored the book Denial of Disaster, claiming that the number of casualties from the earthquake was dramatically and deliberately understated. The official death toll stated in 1907 was 478, but she estimated that over 3,000 were killed. Hansen retired from the San Francisco Main Library in 1992, but continued her work on identifying earthquake victims. In 2005, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors unanimously passed a resolution, co-authored by Hansen, that set aside the official 1907 death count. In 1991, Hansen founded the Museum of the City of San Francisco. She also created a virtual museum website. Aside from her library work, Hansen established San Francisco City Guides, a volunteer organization that gives walking tours of the city. In 1997, Hansen received the Ron Ross Founder's Award from the San Francisco History Association. Personal life Hansen married William Hansen, who was an Air Corps pilot in World War II.

Limelight magazine described it as \\"A crushingly powerful work of musical history ‚Ä¶ A towering piece.\\" Grammy, Oscar and Pulitzer-winning American composer John Corigliano wrote that it is \\"a very ambitious work born out of a seemingly endless plague.

Chan is especially highly regarded for his chamber music, which has been performed by pianists Simon Tedeschi and Benjamin Martin, Australia Piano Quartet, Australian Art Quartet, Seraphim Trio, New Sydney Wind Quintet and Acacia Quartet. He has acknowledged John Cage and Morton Feldman among his primary musical influences and is himself acknowledged as an authority on Cage.

Timed to last 43 minutes and 30 seconds, the lecture was called 'probing' by Limelight magazine. \\"It took four years for Cage to write the piece, to master the courage and rationale behind it\\", he said. Lyle Chan received a Bachelor of Physics from the University of Wisconsin, Madison. He studied music with Conrad Pope, J. Peter Burkholder and the Pro Arte String Quartet. He was Artists & Repertoire Manager for the Australian record label ABC Classics for over ten years.  Works  His most autobiographical works are Solo Piano and String Quartet. = Solo Piano = Very few sections of Solo Piano have been publicly released, the major exception being Forever #1, a one-minute piece written for the second anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the USA. It is purposely similar to the one minute of silence observed at commemoration ceremonies. His website contains memoir essays on several other sections of Solo Piano, such as Untitled (for Steve), Wisconsin Cowboy Lullaby and Nachtst√ºck, none of which he has allowed to be publicly performed so far. = String Quartet = Several sections of String Quartet have been publicly released, notably the sections covering the years 1991 to 1996, known as the AIDS Memoir Quartet. Other sections include Liberty and the Pursuit, a tribute to his teachers the Pro Arte Quartet, and Farwell My Good I Forever, and Untitled (Thomas Brand gewidmet).  AIDS Memoir Quartet  The work chronicles Chan's 6 years as an AIDS activist at the height of the epidemic in Australia, including importing experimental medications from Los Angeles to Sydney. The work has been exclusively performed by the Acacia Quartet. = Voices and Instruments = Voices and Instruments is a diverse work employing any combination of voices (solo or choral) and instruments (chamber, orchestral or electronic). Though less obviously autobiographical than String Quartet or Solo Piano, it does contain sections inspired by events within his direct experience, such as the Lindt Cafe hostage crisis of 2014, or discovering that Benjamin Britten's first love Wulff Scherchen was alive and living in Australia. Several sections have been released: ‚ÄúWachsein ist andersvo‚Äù (Awakening is elsewhere), Rendezvous With Destiny, \\"Dass ich dich schau ewiglich\\" (That I may see you eternally),, Love Is Always Born (December) and Serenade for Tenor, Saxophone and Orchestra (\\"My Dear Benjamin\\").

She worked in a variety of media, including carved ironwood sculptures, tunga (bark baskets), painting on paper, canvas and prints. Her work is held in collections around Australia. Early life Kantilla was born on at Piripumawu on the eastern coast of Melville Island. She grew up on Yimpinari country on Melville Island. She grew up traditionally, eating the abundant bush foods local to the area, living under paperbark shelters and speaking ‚Äòold‚Äô Tiwi. She lived at Paru on Melville Island, moving temporarily to the mission on Bathurst Island after the Japanese bombings of the Tiwi Islands in 1941. She later returned to Paru, where a number of artists were based. Those artists travelled by canoe or swam to Nguiu (Wurrumiyanga) to sell their work. During the 1970s she moved to nearby Bathurst Island to live in her mother‚Äôs country where she began work as an artist, mostly carving tutini (grave poles) and figures. Artwork Kantilla‚Äôs artistic work appears to have begun with her creation of figurative carvings of ironwood while living in Paru on Melville Island after the death of her husband in 1968. In describing her work from this period Kantilla said: > ‚ÄúThe jilamara that I do, it's my father‚Äôs design. I watched him as young > girl and I‚Äôve still got design in my head. As a young girl, when my sister > passed away, I watched him. When he died, I did the same design, right > through Nguiu [Paru], I kept painting.

Right through all the way, working > everyday! When we gathered logs for carving, there was no transport! We > carried them on our shoulder, walking, having a rest, walking a long way, > heavy work. We worked at home [Paru], with no chainsaws, just tomahawk, > carving, hard work. Then we would take the carvings by canoe, paddling > across to Nguiu to sell them\\". In the late-1980s Kantilla moved back to Melville Island, living at Milikapiti where she began to produce her more contemporary work. She produced most of her work through the new Jilamara Arts and Craft Association which was established in 1989. She quickly became one of its leading artists, where she was known as \\"Dot Dot\\" or the \\"Queen of Jilamara\\". She had her first solo show at Aboriginal and South Pacific Gallery, Surry Hills, Sydney in 1994. Before her death in 2003 her work had been exhibited in major exhibitions such as Pumpuni Jilamara: Tiwi Art at the Art Gallery of New South Wales in 2002, Beyond the Pale at the Adelaide Biennial of Australian Art at the Art Gallery of South Australia in 2000 and at the National Gallery of Victoria. Her works are held widely in the collections of major art galleries around Australia, including the National Gallery of Australia, National Gallery of Victoria and Art Gallery of New South Wales, Museum Victoria and the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory.

History The religious complex dates back to 1607, when the original wooden chapel and palm of the Popa was erected, thanks to the preaching of the Discalced Augustinian friar Vicente Mallol. A year later, the convent was built, initially called Santa Cruz, and afterwards it was given the name of la Popa, to have the shape of a galley, whose stern is the extremity where the church currently stands. A wealthy Neapolitan, Don Fabricio S√°nchez, paid the expenses, and once the ecclesiastical and civil procedures of rigor were fulfilled, Fray Alonso de la Cruz Paredes, of the order of the Augustinian Recollects, was named as superior of the convent of La Popa. The chronicle says that while Friar Alonso de la Cruz Paredes in the convent of the Candelaria of R√°quira (a town of the Colombian Andean area), the Blessed Virgin appeared to him and ordered him to build a church on the hill closest to Cartagena, in order to return the Christian faith to this land, in which the legend says, inhabited an evil spirit, in the form of a goat, to which the mulattoes worshiped under the direction of the native Luis Andrea, who ended his days in a cell of the Inquisition. The friar fulfilled his mission and threw the animal from the top of the hill. Since then the Cartagena people call to the precipice, the Salto del Cabr√≥n, in allusion to the goat. By 1612 the convent was almost finished and 15,000 ducats had been invested in it, a very respectable sum at the time. The construction took about 6 or 7 years to finish. Unfortunately, there are few precise data on the convent, since the historical archives have completely disappeared because of the invasions it has undergone. From its beginnings Popa has been the target of all eyes, including that of the pirates, who considered it as a fortified castle that had to be taken somehow. In 1585 the famous English pirate Francis Drake assaulted the Heroic City with a fleet of 23 ships and a force of 2,500 men. The attacks continued, this time affecting the convent of the Stern. By the time the convent was attacked, Cartagena had already built its famous and imposing walls, which were its salvation; La Popa, on the other hand, had only the advantage of being withdrawn and raised above sea level; Something of this served her not to be totally devastated, although after each attack she was left to invest in it large sums of money in reparations. In the course of the War of Independence, the convent of La Popa was a theater of heroic feats, such as the one carried out on the night of November 11, 1815, when the surprise assault of the Spanish besieging troops of Pablo Morillo was rejected. During the Republic, the Augustinians were forced to leave the convent and it was abandoned until it was used as a barracks. In fact, when the liberating troops entered Cartagena, Sim√≥n Bol√≠var settled there with his regiment. Tradition tells that a cannonball, fired from the Castle of San Felipe de Barajas, passed a few centimeters from the head of the Liberator, who was leaning in a window of the high floor of the convent. Then, in 1961 the convent and the hermitage were returned to the Augustinians. At the moment the convent houses the Religious Museum, that can be visited along with the formidable cloister. In February the feast of the Virgen de la Candelaria de La Popa is celebrated. From the dawn of February 2, crowds of devotees make a pilgrimage on foot to the top of the hill of Popa.

The remains were designated a National Historic Site in 1957 by the Japanese government. It is also referred to as the \\"Korekawa Stone Age site\\", although the remains discovered are from the J≈çmon period, rather than the Japanese Paleolithic period. Overview The site consists of three locations: the (Middle J≈çmon period), (Early to Middle J≈çmon period) and (Final J≈çmon period), collectively called the Korekawa Site. The location is on a river terrace on the left bank of the Niida River, at an altitude of approximately 10 to 30 meters. The area was first excavated in the 1920s, and then much more extensively in 1962 and again from 1999 to 2004. The size of the settlement during the middle to late J≈çmon period (3000-1000 BC) was relatively small, but the site included the residential area, graveyard, work area, garbage midden and ritual place. The garbage midden contained the remnants of various shellfish, bones of animals and fish and an extremely large number of Japanese horse chestnuts and walnuts, indicating the importance of these nuts in the J≈çmon period diet. Of especial note were lacquerware items, both of decoration and for strengthening and preserving tools, which suggest systematic lacquer tool production activities. The Nakai Site is also one of the type sites representing the Kamegaoka culture of the final phase of the J≈çmon period (1000-300 BC). Many of the artifacts recovered from the site are on display at the , a museum built at the site, which has been preserved as an archaeological park with several reconstructed pit dwellings. In 2011, 330 items recovered from the site were designated as Important Cultural Properties by the Japanese government. One of the objects, a clay figurine depicting a seated man in a pose of prayer, has been designated a National Treasure of Japan.

He is Professor of Architecture at the Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation at Columbia University in the City of New York and the Founder and Director of the Urban Design Lab, a research unit of Columbia's Earth Institute, where he also serves as professor.  Education and career  Plunz studied architecture at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York, where he earned B.S. in engineering, B.Arch, and M.Arch degrees. There, and at Pennsylvania State University, he researched urban history and development and began developing field techniques related to the anthropology of building and people's relationship to the built environment. He has been at Columbia since 1973, and served as Chair of the Division of Architecture and Director of the post-professional Urban Design Program from 1992 to 2015. Plunz has also held visiting professor positions at the Catholic University of Leuven, in Flanders, and Polytechnic University of Turin, in Italy.  Research and publications  Plunz has pursued research related to housing, urban history, anthropology, urban parametrics, and design. During the 1970s, he undertook anthropological field research in a series of major studies using digitized environmental modeling to help understand the divergent urban contexts of Mantua, in West Philadelphia, the frazione of San Leucio in Southern Italy, and in the Adirondack High Peaks region in New York State. Other significant work includes a 40-year study in Turgutreis, Turkey, which documented the transformation of small villages into a modern city through the experiences of 15 families, and a Millennium Cities Initiative-developed strategic analysis of Accra, Ghana's Ga Mashie and Nima neighborhoods. His A History of Housing in New York City tracks the city's housing developments from 1850 and was published in 1992, and republished in 2016 with new research and an introduction by urban historian Kenneth T. Jackson. Urban planner Peter Marcuse wrote of the book in a 1992 review, ‚ÄúFor its wealth of information and description, for its humane perspective, and for the illumination it provides on the role of architecture in the shaping of housing in New York City over the decades, this is a most valuable book.‚Äù  Awards  Plunz received the Andrew J Thomas Award from the American Institute of Architects for his pioneering work in housing.

The Museum collects, preserves and displays pieces that represent the history of the Village and Island. Through programs and exhibits, the museum encourages an appreciation for the community heritage, culture and physical environment. The Museum houses more than 18 permanent exhibits, including the notable Allan Moses Bird Gallery which has over 300 taxidermy birds. The Museum has a tax-free gift shop which contains many handmade and interesting items that have a connection with the island such as prints, wood carvings and a vast selection of postcards by local artists and photographers.  History  L. Keith Ingersoll and other residents of Grand Manan formed the Gerrish House Society in 1961 with the goal of building a museum that would preserve local history and ensure a permanent home for the taxidermy bird collection which Allan Moses had donated to the community in 1951. Gerrish House Society Inc. was incorporated as a non-profit charitable organization on 5 June 1962, with the purpose of \\"building and operating a museum and science centre\\". The project was accepted as a Centennial project by Canada's Centennial Commission and received capital funding from the federal government. Funding was also received from the provincial government and donations from the public. The Grand Manan Museum opened on 23 June 1967. The Gerrish House Society was renamed Grand Manan Museum Inc. in June 1974.  Archives  The Grand Manan Archives is a project associated with the Museum and the Grand Manan Historical Society. It has numerous records, maps, textual documents, artwork and photography.  Permanent collections and exhibits  = Allan Moses Bird Collection = This is the largest collection in the Museum with over 300 stuffed birds of the Grand Manan archipelago displayed in 18 cases. The naturalist and conservationist Allan Moses of Grand Manan was a skilled taxidermist, as were his father and grandfather, who had settled on Grand Manan in 1872. All three generations contributed to this collection of the birds of Grand Manan and the surrounding area. The gallery also contains material relating to the Grand Manan Museum's founder, the writer and educator L.K. Ingersoll. =Walter B. McLaughlin Marine Gallery= This two-story gallery was built around the second order Fresnel lens from Gannet Rock Lighthouse. Its exhibits explore the history of ship building, lighthouses and their keepers, island ferries and the island's earliest settlers. Displays in the gallery explain the processes of weir fishing, scallop and ground fish dragging, and lobster fishing. The Marine Gallery contains a shipwreck exhibit, which commemorates the hundreds of vessels wrecked on and near Grand Manan. Among the wrecks described in this exhibit are those of the Lord Ashburton (1857), Queen (1841), Turkish Empire (1879), Gypsum King (1906) and Hestia (1909). The Gallery's lower level houses a reconstructed fishermen's shed and an exhibit of lobster trap buoys, including historic wooden buoys. =L. Keith Ingersoll Wing= Ingersoll was one of the first directors of the Grand Manan Museum as well as an historian, fisherman, and newspaper correspondent. This wing of the Museum has a resource library, lecture hall, meeting room and the L.K Ingersoll Memorial Gallery intended primarily for temporary exhibits. ;The Dark Harbour Hermits and Dulsing on Grand Manan :The Ingersoll Memorial Gallery houses a permanent exhibit on \\"The Dark Harbour Hermits and Dulsing on Grand Manan\\". The \\"hermits\\", Lucy and Darby Greene, were two brothers who spent the summers in the 1920s and 1930s harvesting dulse in Dark Harbour, and whose talents for entertaining visitors made them a \\"major Grand Manan tourist attraction\\" at the time. ;Geology of Grand Manan : The Museum's permanent \\"Geology of Grand Manan\\" exhibit is housed in the Ingersoll Wing.

In 2018, Ronen fought to prevent the construction of a 75-unit building on the site of a laundromat. She argued that an environmental review of the building did not consider the impact of a shadow on a nearby schoolyard, even though an environmental review conducted by officials at the San Francisco Planning Department showed that the new construction, including its shadow, would not have an adverse impact on children at the schoolyard. In October of that same year, Ronen dropped her opposition, stating that the appeal process seeking to halt the project had been exhausted, thus allowing the project to proceed.

History Initially established as a mobile squadron of the Royal Navy operating mainly off the coast of Portugal but also Spain during the late 18th century and 19th century, the station was involved in a number of engagements during the Anglo- Spanish War including the Action of 11 November 1779. It was particularity known for its involvement in Battle of Porto Praya, in April 1781 as part of the Anglo-French Wars (1778‚Äì1783). Later that same year, the squadron was ordered to capture the Dutch Colony of the Cape of Good Hope, eventually known as the Battle of Saldanha Bay, however, it failed to re-take the cape. Because of this, the squadron was disbanded in 1782 when Commodore Johnstone sought election as an MP. The Station was re-established in 1795 under the command of Vice-Admiral Sir George Vandeput to undertake convoy duties between England the Mediterranean and Lisbon. In 1808, Admiral Vandeput was succeeded by Vice- Admiral Sir Charles Cotton who was charged with preparation of Lisbon harbor for the planned invasion the Iberian Peninsula later in the year. The fleet was also involved with the evacuation of Sir John Moore's army stuck in Galicia following the Battle of Corunna. In 1810, Admiral Cotton was relieved of command by Admiral Sir George Cranfield Berkeley when it was next involved in improving coastal defences until 1812, when Admiral Berkeley retired his command. He was then replaced by Vice-Admiral Sir George Martin who commanded the station until 1814. He was followed by Rear-Admiral Sir George H. Parker from 1815 until 1834. In early 1837, the station was under the temporary command of Rear-Admiral John Ommanney, until he was relieved as commander in chief by Vice-Admiral Sir William Hall Gage. Gage was ordered, by the Admiralty, to undertake protection duties of Queen Maria II during the period known as the Liberal Wars, fought between progressive constitutionalists and authoritarian absolutists in Portugal over royal succession. The station ceased to be a command in 1841.

Early life and education Born in Melbourne, Australia in 1929 Hallandal was the daughter of an amateur painter and architect. She studied sculpture and ceramics and RMIT c.1950 and at the Central School of Art in London from 1956 - 1957. From the 1960s Pam's practice shifted to focus on drawing. She had originally enrolled in the sculpture department of RMIT, but was discouraged from attending because of her small stature and minimal limp, a result of childhood polio. Career Hallandal's initial work was focused on small scale modernist sculpture. However, from the early the 1970s to the present day she became well known for drawing and printmaking. Hallandal taught at the George Bell School, was the Head of drawing at Prahran Technical College, which later became Victoria College Prahran, finishing her long and dedicated career in education at Victorian College of the Arts, Melbourne. Hallandel championed observational drawing, draftsmanship and drawing education keeping the practice alive within the tertiary syllabus in Victoria. Work Hallandal's drawings are figurative charcoal, pastel and ink works on paper. Using dramatic effects through contrasting light and shadow Hallandel's works are dark and expressive. She recorded her distinctive vision of the world and the life that takes place around her from prosaic details of suburban life to tragic and cataclysmic world events. Portraits, self-portraits, global and daily scenes like the triptych To the tune of the cash register, 1991, Hallandels's works are bold, gestural and often foreboding. =Public collections= * Art Gallery of New South Wales * National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne, Australia * The Kedumba Collection of Australian Drawing * National Library of Australia =Awards and nominations= Pam Hallandal was awarded the Australian Dobell Drawing Prize for excellence in drawing in 1996 and 2009.

He purchased a property which he named \\"Clapham\\", now part of the suburbs Clapham and Torrens Park. They moved to Hawthorn, Victoria around 1870. Their children included: :*Charles Nicholas Collison (1845 ‚Äì 7 May 1929) :*Herbert William Collison (c. 1847 ‚Äì 21 November 1878) married Rhoda Marion Chartier on 16 January 1872 ::*Clement Stanley Collison (1875‚Äì1927) married Ethel Tidmarsh in 1905. She married again, to cousin John Cleeve Collison in 1928. Ethel was a granddaughter of soap and candle manufacturer J. F. Tidmarsh. :*Clement Collison (1850 ‚Äì 27 July 1938), whose name appears on C. N. Collison's headstone. ::Rev. Francis William Cox (c. 1816 ‚Äì 29 March 1904) of the Hindmarsh Square Congregational Church, was a brother-in-law. He was educated at J. L. Young's Adelaide Educational Institution and apprenticed to J. T. Fitch (c. 1825‚Äì1902), father of a schoolmate, who had a draper's shop at the corner of Rundle and Pulteney streets. Around 1866 he joined the literary staff of South Australian Register, a position he held until 1876. He spent a few years farming and store keeping at Stansbury on Yorke's Peninsula, then around 1880 joined with J. Fairfax Conigrave, another old school chum, and fellow member of the North Adelaide Young Men's Society as Conigrave & Collison, patent and real estate agents, with rooms in the newly erected Santo's Buildings on Waymouth Street. Collison handled the patent work, and both were involved with land development in the Adelaide Hills, particularly Belair and Aldgate, following the development in 1882 of passenger rail services that extended as far as Bridgewater. He was one of the promoters of the Hills Land and Investment Company, Ltd., and a foundation member of the District Council of Stirling. The partnership was dissolved in April, 1889, and Collison concentrated on patent law, taking into partnership his son, A. G. Collison, who had served an apprenticeship in the locomotive workshop at Islington, then qualified as a patent agent. When the Federal patents legislation came into force, Mr. Collison removed to Melbourne, and there conducted the Australian and overseas business of the firm until within a few months of his death, while his son handled the Adelaide office. For many years Collison was an active member of the North Adelaide Congregational Church and the North Adelaide Young Men's Society. Both Collison and Conigrave were members of the Australian Natives' Association, once a large friendly society. He served as Hon. Secretary of the Aborigines' Friends' Association from 1879 to 1890 succeeding C. J. Holder, and followed by W. E. Dalton. He was buried in the Wesleyan cemetery, Walkerville.

Since 2005, She has worked at The New York Botanical Garden in the Institute of Economic Botany. She has seventeen years of experience working on ethnobotanical projects in North America (including the Caribbean) and South America. She has conducted research and international cooperation projects in Bolivia, the Caribbean and New York City. Currently she conducts fieldwork in New York City and Jamaica. She has been interviewed about her work on PBS, WNBC, The Wall Street Journal, The Smithsonian Magazine, National Geographic's The Plate and The New York Times. Education In 1991, Vandebroek received a BSc. in biology from Ghent University in Belgium with research in the fields of morphology and systematics. Her undergraduate dissertation was on the effects of naloxon and apomorphine on captivity-induced stereotyped behavior in the bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus). In 1998, she received a Ph.D. in Medical Sciences from Ghent University with a graduate dissertation titled \\"Research into the neurobiochemical background of captivity-induced stereotyped behavior in the bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus): ethopharmacology and intra-cerebral microdialysis\\". Career =Ghent University= From 2000 until 2002, Vandebroek worked as a Post Doc and was the lead researcher on a project funded by the Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology of the Belgian government through Ghent University. The project was based in Bolivia and known as \\"Medicinal Plant Explorations in the Andes and Amazon Regions of Bolivia Ethnographic and ethnobotanical research was conducted in a traditional farming community in the Andes and in indigenous communities in the Amazon in Bolivia.\\" She summarized the results as follows. \\"The results demonstrated that knowledge held by traditional healers about medicinal plants can also be high in an environment such as the Andes that is significantly affected by human activity and is less diverse as compared to the tropical rainforest. In the Amazon, knowledge about medicinal plants was inversely related to the use of pharmaceutical products and to distance from Western primary healthcare services.\\" Outreach activities associated with this research project included two community guidebooks in Spanish that were developed to return research results to the communities to help preserve their cultural heritage. = The New York Botanical Garden = In 2005, Vandebroek joined The New York Botanical Garden as a postdoctoral research associate in the Institute of Economic Botany. From 2005 until 2010 she worked on projects related to the Dominican Republic. Most notably, she directed \\"Dominican Ethnomedicine and Culturally Effective Health Care in New York City\\" (principal investigator: Michael Balick) and \\"Dominican Traditional Medicine for Urban Community Health\\". These projects focused on the question of what happens to the medicinal plant knowledge that people from the Dominican Republic have once they move to New York City. The research found that medicinal plant knowledge was not lost by this community after migration; in fact, the importance of food as medicine became even greater within this relocated population. Vandebroek drew upon her research during this time for her 2007 book, Traveling Cultures and Plants: The Ethnobiology and Ethnopharmacy of Human Migrations, which she co-edited with Andrea Pieroni and authored chapters with others. From 2010 until 2014 Vandebroek worked as an Ethnomedical Research Specialist at the New York Botanical Garden. She directed \\"Improving Healthcare for Underserved Immigrant Latino Communities in New York City,\\" \\"Cultural Competency Training for Health Care Professionals in Latino Ethnomedical Systems in New York City,\\" \\"Dominican Ethnomedicine and Culturally Effective Health Care in New York City,\\" and \\"Dominican Traditional Medicine for Urban Community Health.\\" From 2014 until the present day, Vandebroek has been the Matthew Calbraith Perry Assistant Curator of Economic Botany and Caribbean Program Director at the New York Botanical Garden. In this capacity, she directs the Caribbean and Latino Ethnomedicine Program, which investigates and compares the use of medicinal plants for healthcare by Latino and Caribbean communities living in New York City and their countries of origin. Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, Jamaicans are the central populations involved in these research studies. She and her team study wild and cultivated plants that are used culturally as medicines and foods, as well as \\"folk illnesses,\\" and how they are related to mainstream biomedicine, in terms of the biological efficacy and safety of these plants, and the gap in biomedical knowledge about illnesses with a strong cultural component. The project aims to use research results in order to develop materials used for medical education.

The game is about guiding a group of astronauts to safety. It was released on Steam and later on the iOS App Store.  Gameplay  The challenge for the player is to guide a group of astronauts to safety, and so complete a level. This is done by using directional cues, portals and time manipulation. The player has to guide the astronauts (which move automatically) to colored end spaces in a variety of environments (such as crystal caves and hazy forests). The player has to complete the level in a certain time frame. As the player advances through a level they can go back in time to find a better solution. There is also a restart button which allows the player to start the level from the beginning.  Reception  The game received mostly positive reviews. Gamezebo gave the game 4 stars out of 5 praising the fact it was \\"very challenging and will satisfy hardcore puzzle fans\\" and that the game had \\"nice visuals and soundtrack\\" while criticizing the fact it is \\"very challenging and may frustrate casual puzzle fans\\" and has no instructions. GameGrin gave the game a rating of 4.5 out of 10 saying the game \\"bludgeons freedom into a pulp and annihilates any semblance of player choice, denying any puzzle experimentation and making for one extremely unappealing game\\".

The work has been exclusively performed by the Acacia Quartet. The work chronicles Chan's 6 years as an HIV/AIDS activist at the height of the epidemic in Australia, including importing experimental medications from Los Angeles to Sydney. It is the longest string quartet ever written in Australia About The 90-minute work was sketched in the during the years 1991-1996, but only completed some 20 years later. It contains reflections of historic events, portraits of famous activist friends now dead, and unusual effects like the use of police whistles to recall street demonstrations by ACT UP, the direct action protest group of which Lyle Chan was a core member. In those crisis years, he and fellow activists couriered AIDS treatments from the US that were unavailable in Australia, fiercely lobbied federal government to approve experimental treatments more quickly, and collaborated with drug companies to design clinical trials of promising new treatments. The Melbourne Recital Centre, one of the first presenters of the work, states, \\"This work tells the story of how activists transformed a stigmatized, fatal disease. Like the autobiographical quartets of Steve Reich or Shostakovich, Lyle Chan's AIDS memoir is in turn harrowing and touching but ultimately an intensely uplifting story of a community that fought against all odds for their lives and won.\\" \\"Activism is an attempt to reach some kind of normality\\", he reflected in a 2014 interview, \\"that you feel is being denied for some reason. Once it became clear, between 1994 and 1996, that we were no longer fighting against a constant backdrop of death, it became possible to imagine a future where every day was not a state of emergency.\\" Asked about the message of the work, he replied, \\"I don't have an overt 'message', aside from the message that we all should bring beauty into the world, in our deeds and in our relationships. Sometimes, there are obstacles to be overcome in order to do that. For two decades, AIDS was one such obstacle to beauty and love.\\" A typical complete performance lasts 2 hours, without interval. In performance, Lyle Chan speaks onstage between sections of the music ‚Äì a narrative entirely from memory, telling vivid stories about the events and people of this era.  Structure  The work is made up of 17 sections played continuously, lasting approximately 90 minutes. In performances where the composer narrates between sets of music, the entire show lasts 2 hours without any breaks. It is the longest string quartet ever written in Australia. # In September The Light Changes # ACT UP, Part 1 # ACT UP, Part 2 # Dextran Man, Part 1 # Mark and Adrian Are Her Sons, Part 1 # Mark and Adrian Are Her Sons, Part 2 # Mark and Adrian Are Her Sons, Part 3 # Dextran Man, Part 2 # Et tu Bruce # Night Vigil # After Night Vigil # Dextran Man, Part 3 # Tony-ony Macaroni, Part 1 # Tony-ony Macaroni, Part 2 # Don't Leave Me This Way # Towards Elysium # Fairy Tale Ending  Notable performances  Organised by the presenter Music By The Sea, the world premiere performance of the entire work took place on 5 July 2014 at the Sandgate Town Hall in Brisbane, Australia. The Sydney premiere occurred on 18 July of the same year, organised by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation as a live broadcast concert from its Eugene Goossens Hall in Ultimo. Preceding the performance, ABC Classic FM's presenter Julian Day interviewed the composer on air amid breaking news that Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 had been shot down over the Ukraine while carrying passengers destined for the 20th International AIDS Conference that was to be held in Melbourne only a few days later. The performance was dedicated to those killed on Flight MH17 and their loved ones. At the time of the broadcast, a large number of international media reports claimed that over 100 of the passengers were conference delegates. It was subsequently confirmed that the true number of conference delegates on the flight was 6, but it included the scientist Dr Joep Lange, known for his pioneering research on combination therapy to treat HIV infection. Melbourne Recital Centre organised a complete performance in conjunction with the 20th International AIDS Conference on 23 July 2014. The North American premiere took place on 22 June 2016 in Vancouver, Canada, at the invitation of Pride In Art Society for its annual Queer Arts Festival. Other notable performances Along with Dextran Man, Part 1, the 14-minute section Don't Leave Me This Way was performed at the National Gallery of Victoria's exhibition When This You See Remember Me, a retrospective of the work of artist David McDiarmid. This section relates to the underground drug trials that Chan helped organise and in particular tells the story of how the experimental lipid amphotericin was obtained to treat McDiarmid's lymphoma. Chan was one of McDiarmid's medical carers in the year leading to the artist's death from AIDS-related complications in May 1995. The performance was preceded by a 40-minute conversation between the composer and Justice Michael Kirby on stage. Several excerpts were performed by Acacia Quartet on the Global Village stage of the 2014 International AIDS conference.  Reception  The Quartet has met with widespread critical and audience acclaim. In its review, The Age described the work as \\"triumphantly articulating a story of humanity amid the gloom of disaster ‚Ä¶ sometimes words can fail to adequately describe what one witnesses.\\" Limelight Magazine called it \\"A crushingly powerful work of musical history ‚Ä¶ A towering piece.\\" SBS newscaster Anton Enus wrote in his personal Twitter account: \\"Impressive, admirable, so very moving.\\" Renowned American composer John Corigliano said, \\"Lyle Chan's string quartet is a very ambitious work born out of a seemingly endless plague. Its composer has taken his experiences of living through the enormous tragedy of AIDS and from them has molded a serious and deeply felt work of art.\\" The work was the subject of a half-page feature article in The Australian. In December 2015, LA Weekly contacted Lyle Chan to obtain permission to quote the AIDS Memoir Quartet's program notes about Jim Corti (the real identity of 'Dextran Man' referred to in the music), stating \\"Chan's post is a fascinating chronicle of what people were willing to do to be of service to a cause, including manufacturing caplets of ddC (\\"the most illegal thing Jim had ever done\\") when the FDA refused to approve it and the pharmaceutical companies refused to expand clinical trials. In a second post, Chan recalls when the supply of ddC was interrupted by the '92 L.A. riots ‚Äî Corti, who was white, lived in South Central.\\"  References  Compositions for string quartet HIV/AIDS activists HIV/AIDS in Australia Classical music in Australia ","title":"AIDS Memoir Quartet"},{"id":"53458433","text":"Tayla Thorn (born 31 May 1998) is an Australian rules footballer who played for Adelaide and Gold Coast in the AFL Women's (AFLW).

Amir Mir M. and Daniel Lanehttp://www.telfer.uottawa.ca/en/directory/professors/lane-daniel from 2005 to 2008 at the University of Ottawa, Canada. While Mir was working at the Harvard University, School of Public Health department of Health Policy and Management as a research associate, an opportunity arrived for studying the Axiomatic Design of Complex Systems at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Boston (2009) USA. This opportunity provided Mir an idea to start a new research based on using the tools and concept of the Axiomatic design on Surveillance of a Complex System, specifically in Surveillance of Partially Observable Systems. A partially observable system, unlike a system that clearly displays a full state of its components at any given time, attends to display the invisibility of one or more of its external or internal components at any given time. As technology expends, reliability, performance and safety becomes more and more important. Surveillance of system behavior helps to track hazards and performance. Surveillance is a method used as a tool to help understanding or control the impact of new products or technology. Surveillance is the monitoring of responses and adverse effects. System surveillance is the process of monitoring the performance of objects, a population, or process within a system to understand or to achieve a desired standard of performance. The simplest components of surveillance are observation, examination, analysis and supervision. The conventional method of Surveillance does not apply for a partially visible system. Therefore, a new method is required to observe such complex system at any time given. The Surveillance of a partially observable system offers a mathematical model that uses Markov chains, paired with a Bayesian updating function. The method estimates the statistical impacts of surveillance observations and modified surveillance policies.  Surveillance of Partially Observable Systems on Genetically Modified (GM) Foods  There are many systems that can be considered as partially observable due to their unknown or partially known structures or the nature of their unknown products and/or partially known results. The impacts of the consumption of genetically modified food (GM) are an example of a system that is only partially observable. The safety of genetically modified foods (GM) products has caused much controversy. Absence of sufficient and reliable information prevents neither certain confidence about the harmlessness of product consumption, nor any certain conclusion to merit a ban for fear of harm. The lack of any reliable or conclusive post- market observation and consumption effects information, make it difficult to establish a global protocol for such products. This paper introduces a model for the analysis of partially observable information from the surveillance of post-market consumption of systems such as genetically modified foods (GM) products. This model uses Markov Chains, paired with a Bayesian updating function to estimate the statistical impacts of surveillance observations and modified surveillance policies. A case study on population health status is used as an illustrative example, which is modeled to demonstrate the impact of policy interventions on simulated data. A cost decision analysis model is also applied to illustrate the impact of policy intervention costs. The model uses a first order Markov chain to estimate the period-over-period change in health status and a Bayesian updating procedure to estimate the population health status based on observations from post-market surveillance. The results show how observation samples can be used to provide information on system changes and improvements.  Axiomatic Design for Complex Systems  Axiomatic design is an alternative designing method that has a new perspective and different look into methodology of a system design.[3] Designing a complex system, interacting with a large number of components with some nonlinear behaviors. It requires a surgical mechanism with a critical care to investigate the relationships between all sub-systems of each part interacting with a larger component. This method looks into each sub-system to view a larger picture of the main system. It interacts and forming relationships with its environment. The method applies some principles to a number of case studies and industrial examples ranging from large scale systems to nano-scale systems. It could be also used for the designs of the health-care systems.  Fundamental of design process  # Understanding the system's requirements, components, and needs # Identifying the input/output of the system, the \\"problem\\" needed to be solved for the absolute satisfaction of the system's needs # Identifying the functions requirements # Mapping of the solutions conception, and the synthesis # A task of identifying a method to satisfy different part of system functional requirements # Assigning set of inputs for the product design parameters within given constrains # Optimization of the proposed solution using the perform analysis # Analyzing the output and checking the final design solution to verify if this solution meets the original system's requirements, components, and needs  References  Research methods ","title":"Surveillance of Partially Observable Systems"},{"id":"53458556","text":"Richard L.

It is made from translucent enamel, gilt-silver and paint, and dated to c 1325‚Äì50. Although first mentioned in a convent in Budapest, its style and influences betrays French craftsmanship. It has been proposed to be attributed by the Met to Jean de Toul written Jehan de Touyl in one French source from 1328, a French goldsmith about whom little is known, but who is associated with a small number of works with similar stylistic characteristics.Parker, 350 The centerpiece shows the enthronedHer position is indicated by the fact that she is seated, in what seems to be a church, surrounded by attendant angels and saints.

Note her unnaturally large hands The shrine is one of four extant silver-gilt and enamel examples from the early 14th century.Wixom, 62 The central panel shows the Virgin and Child surrounded by angels, placed in an elaborate Gothic architectural shrine. The Virgin is enthroned and suckles the child Jesus at her breast. It is made from gilt-silver, translucent enamel, with painted surfaces. The work seems to imitate the space of a church. The arches and vaults are described in gilded silver, the wing panels are in enamel and in their colourisation, figuration and perspective, seem intended to evoke stained-glass windows. Created in the International Gothic style. Detail of the right-hand angel in the central panel, with biblical figures in niches, horizontally along the right border The Virgin and Christ child are situated in an arched canopy, flanked by two angels. The complex and minutely described architectural space seems to emulate an early 14th-century church. The edges of the central panel are lined with a series of statuesque saints in niches. Each of the two outer wings contains three foldable panels, showing scenes from the Life of the Virgin and Christ Child. Each of the six wing panels is crowned by a triangular panel containing a musical angel.\\"Reliquary Shrine\\". Metropolitan Museum of Art. Retrieved 11 March 2017 The setting contains a number of elements reflective of contemporary Gothic architectural design, including ribbed vaults, buttress with figures of saints, and trefoil arches. Given its small scale, it was probably intended as a household object, for private prayer. Provenance Its elaborate structure and supreme craftsmanship indicates that it was commissioned by members of the upper echelon of contemporary society. The shrine is first recorded in 17th- and 18th-century inventories of the convent of the Poor Clares nunnery at Buda, in today's Budapest. It was likely purchased in the 14th century by Elizabeth of Poland, Queen of Hungary, who founded the convent.Barnet, 99 It was in the collection of the baroness Clarice de Rothschild, before it was acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1962.

Wells' 1898 classic The War of the Worlds, authorised by the Wells estate. It is set in 1920, 13 years after the events of the original novel, as a second Martian invasion is chronicled by Miss Elphinstone, the ex-sister-in-law of the narrator of War of the Worlds. Baxter also wrote an authorised sequel to Wells' novel The Time Machine, The Time Ships.The Guardian The Massacre of MankindTor.com The Massacre of MankindIrish Times The Massacre of MankindOxford Culture Review The Massacre of Mankind Plot summary =Book I: The Return of the Martians= The Jovians are a race even more ancient than the Martians, who watched the Earth- Mars war with disapproval. 1920, New York City: Julie Elphinstone meets Major Eric Eden, a POW in the Martian war of 1907. He has come from Britain to try and get her to take a call from her ex-husband's brother Walter Jenkins, the author of the \\"Narrative\\" (i.e. The War of the Worlds). Her husband was Frank Jenkins. Since the war, telescopes are only permitted to be operated by the government, so as to prevent panic. There is also a war between the Germans and the Russians called the Schlieffen War. While waiting for Walter's call, Julie and Eric meet with Albert Cook, the artillery man that Walter made infamous in his memoir. When the call finally comes, it's Walter's doctor; he is being treated for neurasthenia, a sort of \\"heat stroke\\" caused by his interactions with the Martians. Dr. Meyers believes that it's actually shell shock, and points out many instances from Walter's book that account for it: Walter doesn't name himself or his wife, the murder of the curate, etc. He recommends therapy, mandated by the prime minister. Walter tells Julie he wants to meet her in London; he has grave news from the sky. Julie, Eric Eden, Philip Paris, and Albert Cook take passage on a steamer to England. They arrive to see German soldiers everywhere (the British sided with the Kaiser in the war against France, Russia, and Belgium, and they may attack America next). Philip takes them to the site where one of the cylinders fell. Here, men have reverse-engineered the crab-like Martian machine and are using it to make aluminium. Men also figured out how the heat ray and some other machines work; Einstein believes the power source is battery packs that use atomic energy. The black smoke and red weed left the land toxic. Julie is taken aback by how totalitarian London has become. The leader, Brian Marvin, has statues and pictures of himself everywhere, and the whole country is 100% dedicated to gearing up for the next Martian attack. Julie visits a Martian monument and passes out when she thinks she sees it turn its head. The next morning, Julie et. al. meet at Ogilvy's former observatory, along with Carolyne (Walter's ex) and Frank (Walter's brother). Walter calls from Germany to say that they saw sigils on Jupiter like they saw on Mars and Venus--though they're of a different design. They believe that the Martians may use the sigils to signal possession of the planets to the Jovians. Observers also saw the Martian cannons firing again, but instead of just one, there were ten cannons that each fired ten shots. He thinks they'll return to England to gather their fallen comrades and technology. Frank is drafted the next day and London fills with soldiers and guns to prepare for war. He meets a VAD named Verity Bliss, who tells him he's the one in charge of their group. They board a train for Uxbridge. Upon arrival, he's told that the cylinder will be dropping at 19:00, and that there will be 50+ landing around the country. These Martian tubes did not slow their descent as the previous ones had, acting as kinetic missiles instead of transport vessels. Anything and anyone within a mile of the impact craters is destroyed instantly. Nearly half of Britain's military is wiped out. Frank and Verity help the survivors, though there are few. The nearest cylinder drops 13 miles from London, so Julie doesn't find out that half the army was destroyed until she reads it in the paper the next day. The shops close and rationing starts. Frank and his group help wherever they can. The next round of cylinders will hit again at midnight. Albert Cook finds Frank on the frontline right before 12. The cylinder hits right on time, but instead of taking 19 hours for the Martians to surface like last time, the Martians pop out right away and start blasting their heat ray. Within minutes, 4 tripods emerge from the hole and take out the guns and artillery. Bert tells them to lie on the ground; anyone who submits is safe, because the Martians have already won and are saving people to be harvested. The next day, Julie spots a Martian flying machine over London--though this time it is flanked by human planes. Prime Minister Marvin calls for all able-bodied men to come to the King's Line (a makeshift defense line built around the Martians' landing site) to start digging trenches. Frank, Verity, et al are rescued by a farm woman named Mildred, who arrives with a horse-drawn buggy to take them back to her farm; it seems the Martians only fire on machines. The Martians deploy their crab-like machine to start building a cordon of their own. Mildred takes Frank to the Manor of Lady Bonneville where Lt. Fairfield is waiting on him. The Martians sent out 200 tripods and took out all the military bases in southern England in mere hours--not to mention all the roads and telephone wires they destroyed. That night, the tripods from all over start to converge on London. German bombers light them up, but they are no match for the heat ray. Julie and her sister-in-law Alice flee London and make for France. Winston Churchill, the Secretary of State for War, remains in the city to oversee its defense. Eric Eden waits in the trenches, ready to fight the straggling tripods that survive the shelling barrage. Unfortunately, their heat rays explode most of the shells in mid-air (though a handful of tripods do go down), and the Martians begin systematically torching the trenches as well. The call for retreat is issued right before the Martians reach Eric. Churchill's secret plan is to use heat rays augmented with human tech, rolled out on the backs of trucks. Unfortunately, the guns won't fire on Martian targets. In a last ditch effort, Eric Eden turns one of the guns onto another gun and blasts it, creating a nuclear explosion that takes out a handful of tripods--but the remaining 40 press on towards London. Julie and Alice travel to Rotherhithe, where Alice has an in with the union leader there. The Martians systematically destroy London, encountering little resistance along the way. Many Londoners escape or take shelter though, thanks to the advanced planning by Marvin's regime. =Book II: England under the Martians= Two years later: the Martians control England, though they mostly remain in their cordon. Julie, in Paris, gets a letter from Walter asking her to come to Berlin; she reluctantly decides to go. In Germany the citizens live their lives normally, despite the Martian incursion only 100 miles away, and despite the ongoing Russian-German war. Walter asks Julie (per General Eden and Minister of War Churchill) to go into the Martian cordon to try and communicate with them using abstract symbols, like the sigils displayed by the Martians and the Jovians. Julie takes a boat from Germany to England, part of a larger convoy that includes Eric Eden. About halfway to England, the fleet encounters Martian war machines at Dogger Bank. The Martians seem to have no trouble spotting vessels through the clouds or the water (u-boats). A naval battle ensues, and the Martians take out about 30% of the fleet, but the Martians are ultimately defeated by a shelling barrage. Julie makes it past without incident in her much smaller boat. Julie arrives in England. She takes a train through a \\"Winstonville\\", one of the small pop-up towns formed by people on the run from the Martians, and named after Winston Churchill, the governor of London ever since General Marvin died during the Martian invasion. At Portsmouth, Julie is taken to a hospital and inoculated against diseases that have been running rampant, like cholera, etc., and is also given some experimental drugs as well. Afterwards, Eden reveals to her that she's actually been infected with a virus that should kill the Martians. She is to find their feeding vat of human blood and \\"poison the well.\\" She is not happy to have been deceived. Julie makes her way down the Thames, which has flooded many of the London streets. Her escorts take her to an open manhole and explain that they will be traveling via sewer to escape the Martian's view while they head into Martian territory. They arrive the next day in Hampsted, where Eden is waiting for them. They take a bus to the Trench: a series of three 50 ft trenches built around the Martian Cordon. A network of caves has been built into the side where the troops are housed. It has been fairly effective at dealing with the tripods, if not the flying machines. Early the next morning, the Martians attack. Julie, escorted by Ben Gray, Ted Lane, et. al., escape into the tunnels, heading into Martian territory. A Martian handling machine burrows into the tunnel ahead of them and kills a handful of the soldiers with its heat ray. Gray detonates a grenade, killing himself and the Martian, allowing the surviving few to escape into Martian territory. When they surface, Julie's ex Frank picks everyone up in a car and takes them to the farmed fields. Julie does not reveal her true mission to Frank. In the riverbeds, the red weed is choking out all other vegetation and life, and changing the air composition to be more Mars-like. The group encounters German soldiers who have taken to potato farming; the Martians ignore them as long as they don't attack. They show Julie the other 2 species that are working nearby: tall, translucent, skinny, humanoid Martians bred by the other Martians as cattle; and more squat, brown beings from Venus. Frank gets Julie set up in Abottsdale and they have dinner with the local dignitaries. Everyone is quite insistent that she donate blood, so the next day she visits Verity Bliss to do so. Verity explains that the Martians pick people off at random, so to try and curb the abductions, they leave blood offerings. Julie is aghast and decides not to donate, but she tells Verity of her mission and asks Verity to arrange a meeting with Albert Cook. Verity takes her to an inn to meet a man named Marriott, who leads an underground resistance. He agrees to help her find Cook if she will help them dynamite a Martian dam. Julie, Verity, and 2 of Marriott's associates attempt to transport the dynamite to the dam, but they're intercepted by a fighting machine. The dynamite detonates when the Martian fires its heat ray, and Julie is thrown into the water. The red weed nearly strangles her, but she is saved by a nude, hair-covered \\"man\\" with webbed digits and gills. Julie awakens 24 hours later. Verity tells her that she was saved by a Cytherean, a man from Venus. They're not as bright as humans, but can swim very well, and \\"Charlie\\" even helped Verity put her arm in a sling. Charlie wears a cross that he got from a priest that was trying to covert the Cythereans. After a couple days convalescing, they are attacked by a fighting machine that is harvesting people. As it's about to grab them, Julie notices that Albert Cook seems to be a symbiotic passenger and calls to him. He remembers her from the first war, though he still holds a grudge against Walter. He tells her that helping the Martians harvest their prey is how he's adapted to the apocalypse. She explains that she's been sent to communicate with the Martians and he says to meet him at the Wycombe caves later. Julie and Verity go to the caves and meet Bert, his wife Mary, and their baby. They tell him they're going into the Martian Redoubt to try and communicate with the Martians using Walter's sigil pictures, but need to know how Bert gets in without being attacked. He says that he sold out some other human's hiding place to endear himself to the Martians, and now he does it for them every day--though one day he plans to turn on them. He wears a wig and gaudy costume so the Martians can easily recognize him, as they have trouble differentiating humans. He saved Mary from a fighting machine and that's why she stays with him. Bert agrees to take them to the Redoubt if they'll take his daughter Belle away from the caves; the Martians are selectively breeding people to get rid of the strongest and he thinks they'll take his baby. At the Redoubt, a Martian gives them a quick once-over and they're left to their own devices once it recognizes Bert. The Martians are digging ever further into the Earth, as well as creating more machines. Bert takes them to the holding tanks where they keep Cythereans and humans for \\"the drips\\". He throws arrow heads into the human tank (Martians don't recognize them as weapons) so they can commit suicide, a slight reprieve against being drained alive. Albert next shows them the experiments the Martians perform on adults and children; they're trying to selectively breed people that will sacrifice their children to save themselves. They also see experiments where they are trying to grow/fuse Martians out of/with humans. Eventually they come to the feeding hole, where the Martians have humans hung upside-down from scaffolding while they inject the human's blood directly into their Martian bodies--presumably to flush out waste in a kind out transfusion. Julie has a revelation on how to stop all the Martians instead of just poisoning these ones. She sees more Martian cylinders falling to Earth, this time over America. =Book III: Worlds at War= Walter observes another tenfold increase in the firing of the Martian canons: a thousand ships are launched at Earth, heading for America. Harry Kane, a journalist, is at an end of the world party in Long Island when the next round of cylinders drop. He meets an injured military captain named Bill Woodward and a woman named Marigold Rafferty, an assistant to Thomas Edison, who is creating super weapons to fight off the Martians. Rafferty leaves to find Edison, and Harry and Bill wait for her to return. She shows up the next morning and says Edison has been evacuated to Manhattan. The Martians start moving toward Manhattan themselves, and another round off cylinders crashes down in LA. In England, Julie asks Bert to take her to see Eric Eden. When they meet him, Eric is about to launch an attack using his \\"landships\\" , but Julie says a better plan is to try and change the Martians sigils carved into the earth instead. He agrees to let her attempt it, and she and Verity come with him on his ship \\"Bodicea.\\" The Martians destroy L.A. The Bodicea landship is like a giant land submarine covered with turrets. It rests on three, forty-foot diameter wheels, and is crafted from Martian cylinders to resist their heat ray. A fleet of the ships attack the Martian cordon, and even manage to take out multiple fighting machines--but not without casualties. Eden tells Julie to go on foot to Marriott, while he takes the fleet to Amersham to attack the Martian control center. Verity stays behind, though Julie says she ultimately won't survive the battle. Harry, Marigold, and Bill head to Central Park. Bill decides to hang back with the army they to assist Major Patton, and tells Harry and Marigold to head south, away from the direction the Martians are headed. Just then, the Martians cross the river into Manhattan and the battle begins. The Martians destroy Melbourne, Peking, Manhattan, Constantinople, and Africa. The Germans and the Russians unite against the Martians. In Germany, Walter decides to head to Berlin, directly into the heart of the oncoming Martian attack. A German bomber outfitted with fire bombs made from Martian technology manages to fell a few fighting machines, but the Martians ultimately prevail. Walter flees the city. In NY, Bill Woodward returns with flux bombs created by Thomas Edison using Martian technology. They detonate a couple near a Martian pit and they are extremely effective in crippling the fighting machines. In retaliation, the Martian flying machines begin dispensing their deadly black smoke. Abruptly, they stop. Julie's plan was successful: they detonated numerous explosives to change the Martian sigils into the circular Jovian symbols. Within 2 hours, the Martians have withdrawn; the Jovians leave their circular sigil on the moon. =Book IV: Mars on Earth= 14 years later, the Martians are still on Earth but no one knows where. Carolyne, Walter's ex, comes to Julie and asks her to look after him. Julie heads to the Amersham pits to visit him. At the Redoubt, Walter takes Julie a half mile into the earth to the underground Martian city. He speculates that this is how they live on Mars, that they have no secrets because of their telepathy, and that they are all treated as equals. The British Martians built a canon and shot themselves back to Mars; reports say that other Martians moved to the Earth's poles where the climate is more Mars-like. Julie, Walter, Eric Eden, and some others take a German flying machine to the arctic. There, Walter shows them the active Martian pit and explains what all the red weed is there for: it's removing the air, which is why the Earth's climate has been changing. He thinks with the Jovians watching, they are forced to merely colonize, and that humans should work with them instead of against. When Earth-Mars opposition comes around again, the Martians do not launch any cylinders. The war of the worlds is over.

Hill (1928-2012) was a biochemist who spent most of his career on the faculty at Duke University School of Medicine, from which he retired as the James B. Duke Professor Emeritus. Hill's research focused on the chemistry of enzymes, with particular specialization in glycosyltransferases and glycobiology. Hill was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1974, the National Academy of Sciences in 1975, the Institute of Medicine in 1978. He served on the editorial board of the scientific journal Journal of Biological Chemistry beginning in 1965 and as associate editor from 1988 to 2012, where he initiated a regular feature series called \\"Classics\\" in which the journal reprinted selected papers of high historical significance. Hill died on November 29, 2012. Early life and education Hill was born in Kansas City, Missouri in 1928. He was an undergraduate at the University of Kansas and received a B.S. in chemistry in 1949. He remained there for graduate work under the supervision of Russell Mills, and received his Ph.D. in 1954. He then worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Utah with Emil L. Smith. Academic career Hill joined the faculty at the University of Utah in 1956. Philip Handler, then chair of the biochemistry department at Duke University School of Medicine, recruited Hill to move to Duke. Hill moved in 1961 and remained at Duke for the rest of his career. He was named to the James B. Duke professorship in 1965 and served as department chair from 1969 to 1993, succeeding Handler after the latter assumed the presidency of the National Academy of Sciences. Hill was active in service and leadership roles in scientific societies, particularly the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, of which he was president in 1976. He served on the editorial boards of several journals and had a particularly long association with the Journal of Biological Chemistry. He joined the editorial board in 1965 and became associate editor in 1988, a role he kept after his retirement from Duke and until shortly before his death in 2012. At JBC he initiated and co-curated the JBC Classics series, which reprinted papers from the journal archives of particularly high scientific impact. Along with Smith and Handler, Hill co-edited a foundational textbook in biochemistry from 1968 to 1978. Research Hill developed an interest in protein chemistry during his postdoctoral work and became known for his studies of hemoglobin while at Utah. He made major contributions to the study of immunoglobulin structure and was particularly influential in the field of glycobiology, which became a major focus of his work after he and collaborating scientists discovered that lactose synthetase contains a glycosyltransferase enzyme.

The team is led by Malaysia, and followed by Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Japan, Libya, Norway and subsequently the European Union.  History  The IMT was launched in October 2004 by Malaysia together with Brunei and Libya to oversee the situation after GPH and MILF signing their ceasefire agreement in 2003. In October 2006, Japan began to participate into the monitoring team. Armed conflict however still resumed and security situation deteriorated until August 2008 when the national co- ordination surrounding resolutions of pending land problems failed. During the period, the lead was taken by Libya which then raise sceptism from the MILF over the slowing process. Malaysia then decide to withdrew its contingent in November 2008 and the IMT temporarily suspend its activities in 2009.
