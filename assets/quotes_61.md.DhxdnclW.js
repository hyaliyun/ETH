It lasted for three days, and ended with a bloody Parthian victory, with both sides suffering large casualties. As a result of the battle, Macrinus was forced to seek peace, paying the Parthians a huge sum and abandoning the invasion of Mesopotamia that Caracalla had begun a year before. Background For centuries, Rome and Parthia had dominated the Middle East and antagonized each other. During that period, several invasions of Parthian territory were led by Roman leaders, most notably the failed campaign of Crassus and the conquest of Mesopotamia by Trajan. In the early 210s, a civil war broke out in the Parthian Empire, where Artabanus IV rose up against his brother Vologases VI. Artabanus quickly established control of most of the western territories, bringing him into contact with the Roman Empire.Rawlinson, Ch. XXI At this point, the Roman emperor Caracalla, who considered himself a second Alexander, decided to take advantage from the Parthian conflict. He proposed an alliance to Artabanus, and even asked to marry his daughter.Herodian, IV.10.1-2 When the alliance was agreed upon, Caracalla with his army entered Mesopotamia unopposed, ostensibly to meet his ally and future father-in-law.Herodian, IV.11.1-2 But when he came upon Artabanus and his court, Caracalla treacherously attacked and slew many of them.Herodian, IV.11.5-7 Artabanus escaped, but the Romans were free to plunder the lands east of the Tigris before returning to Edessa for the winter. However, on 8 April 217, Caracalla fell victim to a plot by his praetorian prefect, Marcus Opellius Macrinus and was murdered.Herodian, IV.13 Macrinus became emperor, but already Artabanus was approaching, having gathered a large army in order to avenge himself for the Romans' treacherous attack. The situation was summed up well by Macrinus himself in the speech he delivered to his army, as delivered by Herodian: At first Macrinus, having no military experience and wishing to avoid a battle, tried to placate and reach an accommodation with Artabanus, offering to return all prisoners. Artabanus rejected this, demanding financial compensation, the rebuilding of the destroyed towns and the cession of the Roman provinces of northern Mesopotamia, only recently conquered by Septimius Severus. These terms were unacceptable to the Romans, and so Macrinus rejected them. The battle The two enemies exemplified two different approaches to warfare: the Roman army was traditionally infantry-based, relying on its excellent legions, while the Parthians were excellent horsemen, employing the heavy shock \\"cataphract\\" cavalry (grivpanvar), mounted on horses or camels, in combination with large numbers of horse-archers. The two armies met near the Roman city of Nisibis (the exact date is unclear). According to Cassius Dio, the first skirmish occurred over the possession of a watering-place.Cassius Dio, Roman History, Book LXXIX.26 On the first day of battle, the Romans deployed in a typical formation, with their infantry in the centre and their cavalry and light troops (Moorish javelin throwers) on the wings to protect their flanks. At the same time, between the gaps left by the heavy infantry cohorts, they placed light infantry. These could skirmish forward and then withdraw to the safety of the heavier formations if necessary.Herodian, IV.15.1 The Parthians attacked at sunrise, shooting volleys of arrows, while the cataphracts, supported by lancers on dromedaries, charged the Roman front. The light infantry covering it suffered casualties, but as the Parthians drew near they withdrew, leaving large numbers of caltrops behind them, with deadly results. The Parthians' horses and camels stepped on them and fell, taking their riders with them and breaking the momentum of the advance. In the resulting close- quarter fighting, the Romans had the advantage.Herodian, IV.15.2-3 The Parthians launched several assaults with little result until night fell, when both sides withdrew to their camps. The second day was a repeat of the first, but on the third day the Parthians, using their greater numbers and superior mobility, tried to outflank the Roman line. The Romans responded by abandoning their customary \\"deep\\" formation in several lines (the triplex acies)Herodian refers only to a deep formation, but it is possible that the Romans were formed up in some sort of triple line.

Cowan, Roman Battle Tactics, p. 20 By this time, casualties on both sides were so great that \\"the entire plain was covered with the dead; bodies were piled up in huge mounds, and the dromedaries especially fell in heaps\\".Herodian, IV.15.5 At this point, Macrinus, with his army on the verge of breaking, sent another embassy to Artabanus, informing him of Caracalla's demise and offering a substantial compensation. The Parthian army had also suffered large casualties, and moreover, since it was not a professional but a feudal militia force, it had started to become restive at the prolonged campaign.Cassius Dio, Roman History, Book LXXIX.27 Thus Artabanus agreed to a peace, after receiving 200 million sesterces.Herodian, IV.15.7-8 Aftermath In June 218, Macrinus was defeated by the forces supporting Elagabalus outside Antioch, while Artabanus faced the uprising of the Persian Sassanid clan under Ardashir I. Nisibis was thus the last major battle between Rome and Parthia, as the Parthian dynasty was a few years later overthrown by Ardashir. However, warfare between Rome and Persia soon resumed, as Ardashir and Macrinus' successor Alexander Severus fought over Mesopotamia, and hostilities continued intermittently until the Muslim conquests.

Don't Wake Dad! outside of North America) is a children's board game originally released by Parker Brothers (later Milton Bradley, currently Hasbro) in North America, and Tomy in Europe (currently released by Drumond Park in the United Kingdom). It is intended for two to four players. Players take the role of children sneaking to the refrigerator late at night, trying not to wake their sleeping father (who lies in the middle of the board on a large bed). Movement is determined by using a spinner and moving accordingly. If the color of a noise space does not match the color of an assigned card that a player holds, they make one of several \\"noises\\" (such as rollerblades, a baseball, a television, a barking dog, a tricycle, a broken vase, a cuckoo clock, a screaming parrot, a falling picture frame, a toy piano, a bowl of fruit being knocked over, a cat whose tail has been stepped on, a falling dish with a slice of cake on it, a radio, falling pots and pans, and a crying baby). They must then press the button on the alarm clock next to the father a certain number of times; after enough pushes, the clock will go off and the father will suddenly jerk upright from his bed (as if just having awakened from a nightmare), at which point the player claims the corresponding color card from a player that has it, then returns to the beginning of the board.

IGNITE artsdepot Creative Services, March 2007. Accessed 26 September 2009 What emerged from Barnet 2000 was a need for more professional arts facilities to supplement the facilities at the existing Bull Arts Centre in High Barnet, which was at that time the only professional, if small, arts centre in the borough. Barnet Council officers worked on the feasibility of using the Tally Ho site and brought together partners including Old Bull Arts Centre, Barnet College and Community Focus. After a capital lottery bid failed, The London Borough of Barnet sought a commercial developer to work with. They also contracted ACT theatre consultants to design the theatre spaces. The developers contracted architects Ruddle Wilkinson. The design was a result of close working with the main partners and the artistic vision was developed largely by The Bull Arts Centre's director, Alison Duthie. The developers Taylor Woodrow then developed plans for the Tally Ho regeneration in which artsdepot is located. The people of North London gained a state-of-the-art arts centre with most of the construction costs coming from the commercial development.

It is near the northern edge of Salisbury Plain in central southern England. History The first recorded mention of Worton was in a document of 1173. Worton (and neighbouring Marston) were tithings of Potterne parish. In 1852, after Christ Church at Worton was consecrated, the tithings became a chapelry of Potterne. Worton and Marston later became separate civil parishes, formalised in 1894. Geography The Bulkington Brook forms the southwestern boundary of the parish. The village is elongated, set around its High Street. The hamlet of Cuckold's Green is at the east end of Worton village. Marston lies just to the south, and Potterne to the east, where the A360 road passes. Religious sites Christ Church, Worton Christ Church, the Church of England parish church, was built in 1841 to designs of T.H. Wyatt to serve both Worton and Marston. The building is Grade II listed. The benefice was united with Poulshot in 1931 and today the parish is part of the Wellsprings Benefice, which also covers Potterne, Bulkington and Seend. There is a small Methodist chapel at Marston. Worton had a larger chapel, built in 1849 to replace an earlier chapel; it closed in the 1990s.  Amenities  The village hall serves Worton and Marston. Worton has a pub, the Rose and Crown, which is a Grade II listed 17th-century building. Five Lanes Primary School has two sites, with younger children at Potterne and older children at Worton.

As signage advertising formats changed, less durable signs appeared in the later 20th century, and ghost signs from that era are less common. Ghost signs were originally painted with oil-based house paints. The paint that has survived the test of time most likely contains lead, which keeps it strongly adhered to the masonry surface. Ghost signs were often preserved through repainting the entire sign since the colors often fade over time. When ownership changed, a new sign would be painted over the old one. In 2013, conservators undertook an effort to preserve ghost signs in Philadelphia. In the city of Detroit, well-preserved ghost signs have been uncovered when an adjoining building is demolished as part of the city's blight-fighting efforts. Other countries File:Glasgow.

With an open span of , it had the second longest span of any surviving single-span covered bridge in the world. The 1862 Bridgeport Covered Bridge in Nevada County, California, currently undergoing repairs due to 1986 flooding (rebuild started in 2019) is longer overall at but is argued to have a clear span. The bridge, opened in 1855, was also one of the oldest of its type in the United States. It was destroyed by flooding resulting from Tropical Storm Irene in 2011. Rebuilding of the bridge commenced in 2017 and was completed in 2018. History Nicholas Montgomery Powers was brought in from Vermont to build the bridge by a group of local business men who formed the Blenheim Bridge Company for the purpose of constructing this bridge. The bridge opened in 1855, and remained in use for vehicles until 1932, when a steel truss bridge was constructed near-by. Since then, the bridge was maintained as a historic site open to pedestrians. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1964. and On August 28, 2011, record flooding along the Schoharie Creek, due to Tropical Storm Irene, resulted in the bridge being washed away and completely destroyed. Longest bridge Many sources simply claimed the Old Blenheim Bridge was the longest surviving single-span covered bridge, without getting into span-length vs. total-length. There are also sources that claim the Bridgeport Covered Bridge in California is longer. The New York Covered Bridge Society states that Blenheim bridge was longer than \\"a bridge in California\\" (presumably Bridgeport), in terms of clear span. Blenheim's clear span was originally , according to this website. A report by the U.S. Department of the Interior states that the Bridgeport Covered Bridge ( No. CA-41) has clear spans of on one side and on the other, while Blenheim Bridge ( No. NY-331) had a documented clear span of in the middle (1936 drawings). In August 2003, measurements of post-repair Blenheim Bridge abutments were on the upstream side, and on the downstream side. Historically, the longest single-span covered bridge on record was Pennsylvania's McCall's Ferry Bridge with a claimed clear span of (built 1814‚Äì15, destroyed by ice jam 1817). Destruction The bridge was destroyed on August 28, 2011, as a result of flooding from Tropical Storm Irene. A witness saw its roof deposited onto a modern bridge just downstream, when the bridge was swept away at about 1 p.m. Over subsequent months, the Schoharie County Highway Department collected pieces of the bridge up to about downstream.http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/Piece-by-piece-old-bridge- coming-home-3361382.php |title=Piece by piece, old bridge coming home |author=Bob Gardinier |date=February 25, 2012 |publisher=Albany Times Union On July 21, 2015, National Historic Landmark designation for the bridge was withdrawn and the property was delisted from the National Register of Historic Places. Replacement A replacement for the bridge was built in 2017, exactly reproducing the design of the original. It was built to stand higher to avoid future floods. Plans were for the bridge to \\"look and feel like it's the old bridge\\". Plans for replacement of the bridge took much time and effort; funding for reconstruction was at first opposed by FEMA, and the chair of a local committee characterized it as \\"a battle\\" to get approval. The construction cost $6.7 million, funded 75 percent by FEMA and 25 percent by New York State; it was started in early 2017. Preserved pieces of the original bridge were included as a memorial. The construction contract was advertised with bids due in October 2016 by the New York State's Governor's Office on Storm Recovery.Old Blenheim with Old Blenheim Bridge Replacement In 2018, PBS broadcast an episode of the Nova documentary TV series about the reconstruction.

Sequel gameplay Cobra has taken a number of innocent citizens hostage and it is up to Action Force to rescue them. They are being held in separate groups atop various urban buildings. Each block must be scaled by Quick Kick while Airtight covers him from the helicopter. As with Action Force, the player must shepherd a character across a dangerous environment, however the game is otherwise completely different. The player controls the crosshairs of Airtight's weapon, and must shoot enemies that appear before they injure Quick Kick as he ascends the side of the building. Quick Kick also loses energy as the level progresses; it can be replenished by shooting the U.S. flags on the walls of some screens. When Quick Kick reaches the roof the hostages are released and make their way to the rescue helicopter. At the end of each level Airtight may switch weapons; he can choose between a machine-gun, bazooka or bio-gun, each of which has different advantages and drawbacks.

It opened in 1979 and closed in 2001. History Early years The Nalbone family of Trenton and Lawrence, New Jersey, owned the building several years before it became a legendary rock club . The \\"City Gardens\\" moniker was first used strictly as a blues club in early 1978. Before its life as a blues club, it was an afterhours club called Chocolate City (after the 1975 Parliament-Funkadelic song of the same name) circa 1976-1978. (Coincidentally, that same band would perform at City Gardens with P-Funk leader George Clinton nearly two decades later.) Kurtis Blow had performed at Chocolate City before his release \\"The Breaks\\", which is recognized as the first rap song to be certified as a gold record. The building had also been written up in local newspaper accounts as a Bible warehouse, and also known for many years in the 1960s as a car dealership called US 1 Motors. 90 Cent Dance Night The popular 90 Cent Dance Night,No Slam Dancing, No Stage Diving, No Spikes: An Oral History of New Jersey's Legendary City Gardens by Amy Yates Wuelfing, Steven DiLodovico on Thursdays, began with DJ Randy Now (Randy Ellis) in 1979 featured music not only from the late 70's UK & USA Punk scene but Randy Now incorporating the newest emerging \\"new wave\\" music scene along with Ska, Reggae music; inter-speared with an occasional 60's garage rock classic. (Kind of on the order of Little Steven's Underground Garage format, over twenty years before The Underground Garage). 90 Cent Dance Nights went to 95 cents in 1983 and was taken over by DJ Carlos (Carlos Santos) in early 1983. DJ Carlos was the main Thursday night and house DJ until late 1994, playing a combination of new wave, alternative, industrial rock and cutting-edge dance music for the time period. At the height of its popularity, which started in 1979 and until the mid to late1990s, the \\"90 Cent Dance Night\\" party regularly drew 700-1000 people weekly and often broke over 1,000 customers on the door count during the holiday seasons. By 1992, the admission price was raised 4% and renamed \\"99 Cent Dance Night\\". Randy Now tells the story where he remembers Greg Hetson (Bad Religion / The Circle Jerks) visiting him in NJ and Randy bringing Greg to a Thursday Night Dance Party. Randy was the DJ that evening. Greg at first didn't believe 1000 people would come out to hear and dance to a DJ. At the end of the evening, Hetson is quoted as saying \\"Brilliant idea of having a 90 cent dance night cover charge; someone in Los Angeles like Gary Tovar should get on board\\" Aftermath Randy Now was let go from City Gardens in 1996 and the club closed in 2001. DJ Rich O'Brien was the last regular club DJ employed by City Gardens. In April 2013, Lawrence Campbell of Exodus Entertainment LLC purchased the building with hopes of turning the site into both a community center and a hall for private functions. In April 2016, the city of Trenton took possession of the property. In August 2019, it was reported that Trenton would be auctioning off 89 city-owned properties in September 2019, in an effort to encourage the development of vacant properties to be used for future homes and businesses. Among the properties listed was the lot City Gardens sits on. Notable bookings and staff A Flock of Seagulls, Thompson Twins and Sin√©ad O'Connor all made their American debuts at City Gardens. Danzig performed their first show ever at the venue. The venue also hosted a performance by comedian Henny Youngman and speaking engagements by counter-culture personalities Timothy Leary. Jon Stewart, famed for his work with MTV and Comedy Central's The Daily Show, was a bartender at City Gardens from 1984-1987, before his stand-up comedy career and later television career took off. Stewart never performed at City Gardens, and there is only one known photo that exists of him inside the club. James Murphy, leader of LCD Soundsystem, was an underage bouncer for City Gardens during the hardcore Sunday matinee shows in the 1980s. Ween called City Gardens their home base. Their first \\"club\\" show was opening for the Butthole Surfers as teenagers, and one of their early live shows at City Gardens was released on the live album The Live Brain Wedgie/WAD. The Ramones performed at City Gardens 25 times, including one of only two performances by the band to feature drummer Clem Burke of Blondie (billed as \\"Elvis Ramone\\"). R.E.M.'s Peter Buck was quoted, in the Tony Fletcher book Remarks, as saying that sitting in the band's van outside of City Gardens watching children play football was part of the feeling that inspired their song \\"Perfect Circle\\". Over 4,000 bands performed at City Gardens, with Randy \\"Now\\" Ellis booking probably 98% of the artists who performed at the club. Tim Hinely notes in a 2004 issue of Go Metric! \\"every punk band who is a punk band played there,\\" naming his favorite performances as The Descendents, Circle Jerks, Agnostic Front, Murphys Law, Butthole Surfers, Sonic Youth, Mod Fun, Gwar and Ween, among others.* Book and film In 2014, authors Amy Yates Wuelfing and Steven DiLodovico published a book on the City Gardens scene, No Slam Dancing, No Stage Diving, No Spikes: An Oral History of New Jersey's Legendary City Gardens.

History In 2003, the German Army Aviation Corps and the French General Delegation for Ordnance (DGA) issued the basic conditions for a new, heavy transport helicopter. This helicopter is to serve as successor to the German CH-53G/GSs, and the CH-47s of other European countries. In the spring of 2004 it became clear that there would be no funds for development until 2015. In February 2006, the German Federal Office for Military Technology and Procurement began discussing the FTH with Eurocopter. In March 2006, Eurocopter announced that the FTH would be available at the earliest in the year 2018, if they could co-operate with another company and start the development by 2010. At the moment, it seems like the second partner is Sikorsky Aircraft, who already developed the CH-53K for the United States Navy. Germany would like to procure between 60 and 120 helicopters, and another prospective customer is France, which would give the French Army a capability which it currently lacks. However the concept could also be suitable for other European countries. The European Defence Agency (EDA) will make recommendations on a future heavy transport helicopter in 2011, with a 24-month study process having been launched on 18 May 2009 with the approval of its member states.Flightglobal France and Germany initiated the heavy transport helicopter initiative, and have already agreed common staff requirements. However, the first year of the study will seek an agreement on requirements -and also the missions, quantities of helicopters to procure- with other EDA member states. Requirements The European Heavy Lift Helicopter Program has issued a number of requirements to be met, including: * Seven blade rotor with elastomeric head and high-performance composite blades * Glass cockpit with four-axis autopilot and sensors for all-weather capability * Fly-by-wire or fly-by-light * Modular ballistic protection * Full composite fuselage * Reduced signature The helicopter will be expected to carry the Dingo or Fennek armed personnel carrier, the French VBL and VAB (13,000 kg) vehicles, as well as Wolf and Wiesel (4,500 kg) or Bv 206. Another desire is that the helicopter could use the same training equipment as the Tiger and NH90 helicopters.

Murray. (1963) The art of the renaissance. London: Thames & Hudson (World of Art), p. 8. The title is often abridged to just the Vite or the Lives. It was first published in two editions with substantial differences between them; the first in 1550 and the second in 1568 (which is the one usually translated and referred to). One important change was the increased attention paid to Venetian art in the second edition, even though Vasari still was, and has ever since been, criticised for an excessive emphasis on the art of his native Florence. Background The writer Paolo Giovio expressed his desire to compose a treatise on contemporary artists at a party in the house of Cardinal Farnese, who asked Vasari to provide Giovio with as much relevant information as possible. Giovio instead yielded the project to Vasari. As the first Italian art historian, Vasari initiated the genre of an encyclopedia of artistic biographies that continues today. Vasari's work was first published in 1550 by Lorenzo Torrentino in Florence, and dedicated to Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. It included a valuable treatise on the technical methods employed in the arts. It was partly rewritten and enlarged in 1568 and provided with woodcut portraits of artists (some conjectural). The work has a consistent and notorious favour of Florentines and tends to attribute to them all the new developments in Renaissance art ‚Äì for example, the invention of engraving. Venetian art in particular, let alone other parts of Europe, is systematically ignored. Between his first and second editions, Vasari visited Venice and the second edition gave more attention to Venetian art (finally including Titian) without achieving a neutral point of view. John Symonds claimed in 1899 that, \\"It is clear that Vasari often wrote with carelessness, confusing dates and places, and taking no pains to verify the truth of his assertions\\" (in regards to Vasari's life of Nicola Pisano), while acknowledging that, despite these shortcomings, it is one of the basic sources for information on the Renaissance in Italy. Vasari's biographies are interspersed with amusing gossip. Many of his anecdotes have the ring of truth, although likely inventions. Others are generic fictions, such as the tale of young Giotto painting a fly on the surface of a painting by Cimabue that the older master repeatedly tried to brush away, a genre tale that echoes anecdotes told of the Greek painter Apelles. He did not research archives for exact dates, as modern art historians do, and naturally his biographies are most dependable for the painters of his own generation and the immediately preceding one. Modern criticism‚Äîwith all the new materials opened up by research‚Äîhas corrected many of his traditional dates and attributions. The work is widely considered a classic even today, though it is widely agreed that it must be supplemented by modern scientific research. Vasari includes a forty-two-page sketch of his own biography at the end of his Vite, and adds further details about himself and his family in his lives of Lazzaro Vasari and Francesco de' Rossi. Influence Vasari's Vite has been described as \\"by far the most influential single text for the history of Renaissance art\\"Professor Hope, The Warburg Institute, course synopsis, 2007 and \\"the most important work of Renaissance biography of artists\\". Its influence is situated mainly in three domains: as an example for contemporary and later biographers and art historians, as a defining factor in the view on the Renaissance and the role of Florence and Rome in it, and as a major source of information on the lives and works of early Renaissance artists from Italy. The Vite has been translated wholly or partially into many languages, including Dutch, English, French, German, Polish, Russian and Spanish. Early translations became a model for others The Vite formed a model for encyclopedias of artist biographies. Different 17th century translators became artist biographers in their own country of origin and were often called the Vasari of their country. Karel Van Mander was probably the first Vasarian author with his Painting book (Het Schilderboeck, 1604), which encompassed not only the first Dutch translation of Vasari, but also the first Dutch translation of Ovid and was accompanied by a list of Italian painters who appeared on the scene after Vasari, and the first comprehensive list of biographies of painters from the Low Countries. Similarly, Joachim von Sandrart, author of Deutsche Akademie (1675), became known as the \\"German Vasari\\" and Antonio Palomino, author of An account of the lives and works of the most eminent Spanish painters, sculptors and architects (1724), became the \\"Spanish Vasari\\". In England, Aglionby's Painting Illustrated from 1685 was largely based on Vasari as well. In Florence the biographies of artists were revised and implemented in the late 17th century by Filippo Baldinucci. View of the Renaissance The Vite is also important as the basis for discussions about the development of style.Elinor Richter, reviewing Philip Sohms study of style in the art theory :\\"Giorgio Vasari's Vite, the first edition of which was published in 1550, provides the foundation for any discussion of the development of style.\\" It influenced the view art historians had of the Early Renaissance for a long time, placing too much emphasis on the achievements of Florentine and Roman artists while ignoring those of the rest of Italy and certainly the artists from the rest of Europe.Stephanie Leone, The Renaissance Society of America, 2007: \\"[...] the traditional definition of Renaissance art as the humanistic innovations of Florentine and Roman artists, to which Giorgio Vasari's Vite (1550, 1568) gave rise.\\" Source of information For centuries, it has been the most important source of information on Early Renaissance Italian (and especially Tuscan) painters and the attribution of their paintings. In 1899, John Addington Symonds used the Vite as one of his basic sources for the description of artists in his seven books on the Renaissance in Italy, and nowadays it is still, despite its obvious biases and shortcomings, the basis for the biographies of many artists like Leonardo da Vinci.  Contents  The Vite contains the biographies of many important Italian artists, and is also adopted as a sort of classical reference guide for their names, which are sometimes used in different ways. The following list respects the order of the book, as divided into its three parts. The book starts with a dedication to Cosimo I de' Medici and a preface, and then starts with technical and background texts about architecture, sculpture, and painting.Vasari, Giorgio.

Cordones were established in Chile by the working class during the Salvador Allende Popular Unity government (1970-1973). Historical context The cordones were established by the independent activity of working class people and were initially established to pressure the government to socialize a number of companies that refused to accept workers rights. Their formation were extended and their creation-pace accelerated in response to sabotage and strikes organized by employers' organizations and the capitalist class that aimed to destabilize the Salvador Allende democratically elected socialist government and derail the implementation of a socialist programme. Initially created as organs to exert social pressure on the ruling government, they ultimately became a base for working-class political power itself. The first cord√≥n was established on June 19, 1972, when workers from 30 different factories join to formulate the Cordon Cerrillos. Los cordones industriales y el socialismo desde abajo - Miguel Silva (Biblioteca Obrera) Structure Each Cord√≥n was a group of factories and companies, which coordinated the tasks of workers in the same zone. By the time the Salvador Allende government was overthrown on September 11, 1973 military coup 31 cordones had been established and were operational. Of the 31 cordones 8 of them were within the Chilean capital of Santiago. Cordones and the State The independent nature of these organs of poder popular from the bureaucracies of the official trade union body (C.U.T.), the state (the National Congress of Chile) and the leadership of the parties forming the governing Popular Unity coalition (viz. Socialist Party, Communist Party, etc.) created a complex situations for those attempting to implement socialism within the framework of existing democratic institutions. Some political organisations such as the Revolutionary Left Movement (which was not part of the popular unity coalition) and the Marxist‚ÄìLeninist faction of Popular Unitary Action Movement saw these organs of popular power as embryonic social organs for a new more democratic form of (worker) state.

He became the Tyne, Thames, English and World Sculling Champion. He was one of three great Tyneside oarsmen, the other two being Harry Clasper and James Renforth. Early history Robert Chambers was born at St Anthony's, a riverside area, east of Newcastle. His father worked as an iron moulder at the Losh, Wilson and Bell ironworks in nearby Walker and young Bob also began work there as an iron puddler, a job that involves stirring molten pig iron with a ladle to release the impurities. Although the work was hot and dirty, it developed his arm and chest muscles. Chambers first appeared in a rowing contest at the age of 21, when he was beaten in a sculling race by a competitor named Hicks. However his performances improved until he was drawn against the veteran oarsman Harry Clasper in the second heat of the Tyne sculling championship, in 1855. Clasper, who at that time was 43, won the race, but he recognised that Chambers had great potential. He therefore invited him to join his Derwenthaugh crew. The new crew consisted of Harry Clasper (at stroke), his brother Robert, his eldest son John Hawks and Robert Chambers. The crew took part in the Durham Regatta of 1856 and won the main prize, the Patron's Plate. Chambers took part in the sculling competition and lost in the final to teammate John Hawkes Clasper. Early rowing career Chambers continued to be coached by Clasper, who was a very astute rowing coach, and his rowing improved immensely. In the Thames Regatta of 1856, Clasper and Chambers formed a crew with two Thames watermen and won the fours race. The following year, in the sculling competition, Chambers won the championship, beating the best of the Thames scullers. The Thames watermen were sensitive about outsiders winning races on their river. They therefore looked for a local sculler who could restore local pride by beating the Tyneside man. Tom White of Bermondsey was chosen. A race between the two men took place on the Tyne on 19 April 1859 from the High Level Bridge to the Scotswood Suspension Bridge for a stake of ¬£200 a-side. Chambers won the race in amazing fashion. After 400 yards he collided with a moored boat and found himself 100 yards behind White, a seemingly impossible deficit to make up. However, he refused to give up and by the finish he had turned a 100 yards deficit into a 60 yards lead. His perseverance in this and other races earned him the nickname \\"Honest Bob\\", showing how people admired a competitor who gave a brave, whole-hearted performance. Championship of the Thames and World Champion Chambers continued to win sculling races until he was considered an eligible challenger for the Championship of the Thames. The champion at that time was Harry Kelley and a race was arranged for 29 September 1859 from Putney to Mortlake. The stake was ¬£200 a-side. The race was close for the first mile, but then Chambers began to pull away from Kelley and finally won by 200 yards. He was the first oarsman from the provinces to win this prestigious title and his backers rewarded him with a purse of 100 gold sovereigns. Chambers was now undisputed champion of the Tyne and Thames. Before 1876, the English Sculling Championship was considered to be the premier event in professional sculling. In 1876, the English Title gained the World status and earlier winners were retrospectively given the title of World Champion. \\"Honest Bob's\\" success against the Thames scullers was recorded for posterity in verse by Geordie Ridley, the music hall poet: > :O, ye Cockneys all, :Ye mun think't very funny, :For Bob he gans and licks > ye all, :An collars all yer money Another match was arranged with Tom White, this time on White's home water, the Thames. This took place in September 1860 for a stake of ¬£200 a side. Chambers won an easy victory. In April 1863 Chambers sculled against another challenger from the Thames, named George Everson, and won by 100 yards. In 1863 the Australian sculling champion, Richard A.W. Green, travelled to England for a match with Chambers, to be rowed on the Thames, from Putney to Mortlake i.e. the Championship Course. The race was the first overseas challenge for the English Championship Title and the stake was ¬£400. Chambers won easily. Chambers subsequently lost the Championship to Harry Kelley, the Thames sculler, in 1865, in a race held on the Thames. Kelley retired but Chambers then won the title back in an open race with Joseph Sadler in 1866. Chambers was defeated by Harry Kelley, (who had come out of retirement) in 1868, in a race held on the Tyne. For further details of the seven World Title races that Chambers was involved in see World Sculling Championship. Ill health By this time his health was in serious decline. In his youth he had worked in an iron foundry, in hot, dirty conditions that may have damaged his lungs. In any case, he had developed tuberculosis. At the time, he was the landlord of the King's Head pub, St Anthony's in Newcastle and, in an attempt to improve his health, he briefly moved to Croft Spa near Darlington. However this was to no avail and he moved back to St Anthony's, where he died on 4 June 1868, at the age of 37. He was buried in Walker Churchyard and a magnificent memorial was erected over his grave, showing him in repose, with sculling oar lying alongside him. The memorial, somewhat vandalised, can be seen there today. At his funeral, one of the mourners was a young sculler called James Renforth. He would soon take over where Robert Chambers had left off and become equally famous. Bibliography * Whitehead, Ian. The Sporting Tyne, A History of Professional Rowing, Portcullis, 2002. .

The seat is set at an angle to provide the maximum possible flow when unseated. Angle seat piston valves are particularly suited to applications where high temperatures and large flow rates are required, such as steam or water. When used in reverse some models of angle seat piston valve will eliminate water hammer when operated. Operation Pneumatic valves are operated by a pilot medium under pressure, usually compressed air but also oil or water. The valve is equipped with a pneumatic actuator supplied by a three-way solenoid valve. The pressure of the pilot medium enters the actuator cylinder and acts on the piston, which allows the seal to open or to close through the stem. The return of the seal into its rest position is usually achieved by a return spring that can be found in the pneumatic actuator. In the double-acting configuration, there is no return spring and the pilot medium is used both for opening and for closing the valve. A red indicator becomes visible through the sight dome that is found on the top of the actuator when the valve is in the open position. The pressure range depends on the pressure of the pilot medium and the controlled medium and on the direction of the flow, but also on construction parameters of the valve, such as the diameter of the orifice, the diameter of the actuator cylinder and the spring force.

In eighteenth-century Italy, a burletta was the comic intermezzo between the acts of an opera seria. The extended work Pergolesi's La serva padrona was also designated a \\"burletta\\" at its London premiere in 1758.A Biographical Dictionary of Actors, Actresses, Musicians, Dancers, Managers & Other Stage Personnel in London, 1660-1800: Tibbett to M. West, Philip H. Highfill, Kalman A. Burnim, Edward A. Langhans, SIU Press, 1973, p51 In England, the term began to be used, in contrast to burlesque, for works that satirized opera but did not employ musical parody. Burlettas in English began to appear in the 1760s, the earliest identified as such being Midas by Kane O'Hara, first performed privately in 1760 near Belfast, and produced at Covent Garden in 1764. The form became debased when the term burletta began to be used for English comic or ballad operas, as a way of evading the monopoly on \\"legitimate drama\\"Meaning spoken plays, rather than opera, dance, concerts, or plays with music () in London belonging to Covent Garden and Drury Lane. After the passage of the Theatres Act of 1843, which repealed crucial regulations of the Licensing Act of 1737, use of the term declined.

Sargon laid the city of Kazalla to waste so effectively that \\"the birds could not find a place to perch away from the ground.\\"Oppenheim 266. According to a tablet from the reign of Gudea of Lagash, Kazalla was located somewhere to the west of Mesopotamia, in the land of Martu. Scholars today believe it was only about 15 km from the city of Babylon, and just west of the Euphrates. Kazallu briefly became a city-state in its own right, conquering a number of its immediate neighbors, including Babylon. It was from Kazallu that Babylon first won its independence c. 1900 BC, soon growing to eclipse its fame and establish a regional empire.

This defeat on the banks on the Panaro River, just south of Modena forced the Austrians to retreat behind the Po River.  Background  When Naples declared war on Austria, Austrian troops were still gathering in Lombardy. Only a small force of about 6,600 men commanded by General Bianchi, who was stationed in the Duchy of Modena, were in position to check the Neapolitan advance. Murat with his main army of around 40,000 men had already established a main headquarters in Ancona and were marching north. Following a minor skirmish on 30 March near Cesena, the Austrians under Bianchi fell back to a new defensive line behind the Panaro River. This allowed the Neapolitans to capture Bologna on 2 April, from where they prepared another assault on the Austrians.  Battle  On 3 April, one day after capturing Bologna, a Neapolitan division under the command of Michele Carrascosa attempted to cross the Panaro. After being driven back from two other bridges, the Neapolitans finally crossed the Panaro at Castelfranco Emilia and made a sweeping charge on Bianchi's position. As heavy fighting continued in the center of the Austrian position, Murat ordered a column under General Colletta to sweep left and push on the Austrian fight flank. Outnumbered, the Austrian right flank was turned and Bianchi was compelled to sound the retreat. With more Neapolitan troops arriving from Bologna, the Austrian retreated back to their lands behind the Po River. Following the battle, Carascosa and his troops immediately occupied the major towns of the Duchy of Modena: Modena, Reggio Emilia and Carpi.  References  *Capt.

In 1896 he was elected a member of the British Ornithologists' Union. Ettore Arrigoni degli Oddi was also a \\"Tring\\" correspondent. In 1911 he founded the Rivista Italiana di Ornitologia, (RIO) a scientific journal on ornithology, together with Filippo Cavazza (1886‚Äì1953), Francesco Chigi (1881‚Äì1953), Alessandro Ghigi (1875‚Äì1970), Giacinto Martorelli (1855‚Äì1917) and Tommaso Salvadori (1835‚Äì1923). The journal still exists today. The contents of volume 1-5 (1911-1920) are online available at BHL. Publications Display Case in Museo Civico di Zoologia In 1898 his first article in an English journal was published: 'Notes on some specimens of Anatidae in the late Count Ninni's collection,' in The Ibis. In 1926 following the introduction of a national game law in for Italy in 1923 Oddi wrote a report on bird protection.

The scientific nomenclature was up to date and vernacular names in Italian, French, German and English are provided for each species. A large number of local names was added for the common birds. There is a detailed and differential description of each species, and notes on distribution, breeding, eggs, habitat, song, and food. There are diagnoses of genera and a bibliography of nearly 1000 titles (articles and books on Italian ornithology; general accounts of the structure of birds, bird migration, song, eggs, nidification and taxonomy. There is also a systematic list, a list of species erroneously recorded species and a table of migration dates.

Description and systematics This family is sometimes massively expanded, with the closely related Bistonini, Bupalini, Erannini, Gnophini, Melanolophini, Phaseliini and Theriini all merged into it. The eggs of all these geometer moths have the chorion cells characteristically arranged in longitudinal rows. The eggs of the Boarmiini in the narrow sense usually have a typical slender and narrow shape, with a soft chorion consisting of heavy-walled but unridged polygonal cells. However, in Cleora for example, the eggs approach the wide-walled shape found in many Bistonini. Adding further to the uncertainty is the fact that the Alsophilinae, usually treated as a small subfamily in their own right, might be a specialized lineage of Boarmiini; though their caterpillars are quite different, their pupae have a peculiar T-shaped cremaster which very much resembles that of the Boarmiini.Holloway (1994), Young (2008) Boarmiini in the narrow sense are typically slender geometer moths that rest with the wings spread out flatly and do not tuck the hindwings under the forewings while at rest. Typically, they are cryptically colored and rather dark, with brownish-grey hues predominating; in many, there are two or three weak wavy bands extending across the wings and forming a rough semicircle when the moths are at rest. Though they all look quite similar in habitus, there are few unequivocal characters that can be easily used to recognize adult members of this tribe. The females of many species have a conspicuously long ovipositor for hiding away the typical soft-shelled eggs. The valva and harpe (or \\"clasper\\") of the male genitalia are highly complex in almost all species and often bear various extensions. The juxta is typically well-developed, large and extended. Their caterpillars are rarely plump, and apparently at least some mimic twigs or thin leaves. Selected genera Adult male Neoalcis californiaria, one of the many species only tentatively placed in the Boarmiini As numerous ennominae genera have not yet been unequivocally assigned to a tribe, the genus list is preliminary.See references in Savela (2008) In addition, the genera Acrodontis and Xerodes (usually placed in Ennomini), as well as Monocerotesa (usually in Macariini) are placed in the Boarmiini by some authors. \\"Boarmia\\" penthearia however appears to belong to the Macariini.Young (2008) The fossil Lithopsyche was long assigned to the Boarmiini, but more recently a restudy indicated that it is a misidentified true butterfly (Papilionoidea). In 2019, the first geometrid caterpillar in Baltic amber was discovered by German scientists. Described under Eogeometer vadens, it measured about , and was estimated to be 44 million years old, dating back to Eocene epoch. It was described as the earliest evidence for the subfamily of Ennominae, particularly the tribe of Boarmiini. References * (2008): Family group names in Geometridae.

History and organization The Wehrmacht security divisions were set up at the beginning of 1941 and were intended to perform policing, security and counter- insurgency duties in the rear of the main German field armies, under the direction of the respective army rear area command, or Kor√ºck. They were organised from divisions initially raised in the 3rd wave of mobilisation, these being former Landwehr divisions largely manned by second-line reservists. As Rear Security Divisions they were not well equipped like front line troops, some of the divisions started out as infantry divisions but once they were assigned to rear security, their heavy weapons were sent off to be used by front line troops. Often made up of Soldiers from the reserve and in 1942 Landesch√ºtzen (territorial guard) troops. Police battalions were also part of the divisions, they were supposed to be provided with one standard regiment of troops, plus an artillery detachment, as a 'strike force', though in practice this was often used for frontline duty as local conditions demanded. In many cases, the Security Divisions also included battalions of Ukrainian, Russian or French soldiers as well as a unit of captured foreign tanks. Their exact organisation varied widely between individual formations and during the course of the war (see the 286th Security Division for example). Many of the Security Divisions were thrown into frontline service during the major Soviet offensives of 1944, such as Operation Bagration, and destroyed in the process. Some were rebuilt as standard infantry divisions due to the chronic manpower shortages of the Wehrmacht in this period.  Wehrmacht criminality  The Security Divisions of the Wehrmacht were responsible for a large number of war crimes and in many cases for systematic programmes of repression against the civilian population. This occurred most notably on the Eastern Front, particularly in the rear areas of Army Group Centre, where they acted with extreme brutality.In addition to evidence given in accounts of individual actions, Gerlach (in Kalkulierte Morde) and others have shown that the number of people reported killed in supposed \\"anti- partisan operations\\" consistently exceeded the number of weapons actually recovered by a factor of up to ten (Gerlach, pp.957-8), suggesting that the majority of those killed were, in fact, unarmed civilians. The British historian Ian Kershaw concludes that the Wehrmacht's duty was to ensure that the people who met Hitler's requirements of being part of the Aryan Herrenvolk (\\"Aryan master race\\") had living space. He wrote that: The Nazi revolution was broader than just the Holocaust. Its second goal was to eliminate Slavs from central and eastern Europe and to create a Lebensraum for Aryans. ... As Bartov (The Eastern Front; Hitler's Army) shows, it barbarised the German armies on the eastern front. Most of their three million men, from generals to ordinary soldiers, helped exterminate captured Slav soldiers and civilians. This was sometimes cold and deliberate murder of individuals (mostly Jews), sometimes generalised brutality and neglect. German soldiers' letters and memoirs reveal their terrible reasoning: Slavs were 'the Asiatic-Bolshevik' horde, an inferior but threatening race Several high-ranking Wehrmacht officers, including Hermann Hoth, Georg von K√ºchler, Georg-Hans Reinhardt, Karl von Roques, Walter Warlimont and others, were convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity at the High Command Trial given sentences ranging from time served to life. During World War II, the German military helped fulfill Nazism's racial, political, and territorial ambitions. Long after the war, a myth persisted claiming the German military (or Wehrmacht) was not involved in the Holocaust and other crimes associated with Nazi genocidal policy. This belief is untrue. The German military participated in many aspects of the Holocaust: in supporting Hitler, in the use of forced labor, and in the mass murder of Jews and other groups targeted by the Nazis. The military‚Äôs complicity extended not only to the generals and upper leadership but also to the rank and file. In addition, the war and genocidal policy were inextricably linked. The German army (or Heer) was the most complicit as a result of being on the ground in Germany‚Äôs eastern campaigns, but all branches participated.https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/the-german- military-and-the-holocaust  List of Security divisions  *52nd Security Division *201st Security Division *203rd Security Division *207th Security Division *213th Security Division *221st Security Division *281st Security Division *285th Security Division *286th Security Division *325th Security Division *390th Security Division *391st Security Division *403rd Security Division *444th Security Division *454th Security Division *707th Infantry Division All the Security Divisions with the exemption of the 325th were on the Eastern front.

It is owned by Saga Communications. It broadcasts at 101.9 MHz. History WPOR has had the same format since it signed on as an FM simulcast of 1490 WPOR, now WBAE, on October 31, 1967. WPOR was owned by Hildreth Broadcasting Corporation at that time. On March 2, 1971 WPOR and WPOR-FM were sold to Ocean Coast Properties. 25 years later in March 1996 WPOR and WPOR-FM were sold again, this time to current owner Saga Communications for $10 million. Through most of its history, the AM and the FM stations either simulcast, or for some years, the AM station used a satellite-delivered country music service, while live local announcers continued on the FM station. In March 1999, 1490 AM changed its call letters to WBAE. The reason for the new call letters was made clear on May 24, 1999 when it changed its format to adult standards and became known on air as The Bay. WPOR's Jon Shannon has hosted the POR Morning Crew since March 2001. WPOR-FM had the greatest market share of any Maine radio station into the early 2000s, at which time it was still Portland's only country music station.

C.B.S. was founded in 1962 by the Christian Brothers, a religious order founded by Edmund Ignatius Rice in the early 19th century. Education Educating the children of Belfast has always been the school's main aim, however before 2004 the school could only provide 5 years of secondary education. This was a result of the school's structure as it could not hold more than 750 pupils. The maximum year that a pupil could reach at the school was Year 12 (5th year). While in 5th year, the pupils would complete their GCSEs and await their results. After each pupil had received their GCSE results, they would then have to go in search of another school (secondary or grammar) that would accommodate their need for further education in the form of AS- Levels and A-Levels. The main choice, of course, was St Mary's Grammar School. In 2004 however, under the direction of Gerry Scannell (former Vice Principal and temporary Principal until the arrival of Tom Armstrong), the option to stay at the school to study AS-levels and A-Levels was granted. The school was gradually changed to accommodate the Sixth form's educational needs and has continued to change to the present day. As of 2007, 96 Lower Sixth pupils have been accepted into the school, a record breaking number for the school. Most of the 96 pupils are returning students. However, a small minority of the 96 students come from different schools. In 2008 CBS accepted over 117 pupils into lower sixth, and for the first time in the school's history, female students were allowed to enroll in the school. Aisling Award In November 2007, CBS was nominated for an Aisling Award (Part of the Aisling Awards Ceremony) in the category for Outstanding Education Endeavour. According to BelfastMedia.com, CBS was \\"nominated for their radical transformation in the school's delivery of a broadened curriculum which now included vocational qualifications and A-Level subjects.\\" It was announced by the Belfast Media Group that CBS had won the award for Outstanding Education Endeavour. Science in conjunction with University of Ulster In 2006, C.B.S. was one of the first schools in Northern Ireland to participate in a new applied GCE science course known as Step-Up to Science, or simply Step-Up. This new course was brought to Belfast as a pilot test for the North and is currently in its 8th year in Derry; where it originated, and as of 2007, is currently in its second year in Belfast. Step-Up is a science course provided by the University of Ulster and all the modules in the course are provided and examined by AQA. If students successfully complete the course with either AA, BB, CC, DD or EE, they will be awarded with UCAS points, just like the current regular A-Level courses. The course is currently accepted at the University of Ulster and other universities accept the course as a double GCE applied course. Taken from the University of Ulster's summary of the Step-Up programme, from their official website. > The programme operates successfully in the North-West of the province and > actively involves the University, schools, local industry, the local > hospital and government agencies in a collaborative partnership.

Location The municipality is located in the Torrijos region and adjoins the populations of Santo Domingo-Caudilla, Carmena and Santa Olalla, all of which are in Toledo. History There is data which indicates Alcab√≥n's existence since 1095.

The event was opposed by groups such as the National Alliance who counter demonstrated with placards reading \\"You are Entering a White Guilt Zone\\" and \\"White Pride\\". In May 2006, the Lifeline Expedition team made an apology at the opening ceremony of the International Roots Festival in The Gambia. Apologies were given by English, French, German and American representatives as those nations were prominent in the slave trade in that region. The Vice- President of The Gambia, Dr Isatou Njie Saidy, accepted the apology and released the team from the yokes and chains. One of those giving the apology was Andrew Hawkins, a direct descendant of England's first slave trader, Sir John Hawkins. The March of the Abolitionists in 2007 began in Hull, the birthplace of William Wilberforce, on 1 March. The walkers then walked 250 miles in yokes and chains, recalling the gruelling journeys of enslaved Africans, during the period of the Atlantic Slave Trade. Their penitential action took place in the season of Lent and, as well as expressing apology, also drew attention to the estimated 12 million people still in slavery today. The journey ended in Westminster on 24 March, when the team joined the Walk of Witness led by the Archbishops of Canterbury, York and the West Indies. The walkers were released from the yoke and chains by the Archbishop of the West Indies. The second part of the March of the Abolitionists (the Sankofa Reconciliation Walk) took place in June and July and visited all the major former slave ports.

Overview SCIM would collect air and dust samples by flying through the atmosphere of Mars without landing or orbiting.Wadhwa, et al. - SCIM (2012) The design utilizes heritage from the successful Stardust and Genesis sample return missions. A pass through the atmosphere about above Mars' surface at a speed of 6 km/s would result in millions of particles being encountered.Leshin, et al. - Sample Collection for Investigation of Mars The particles would be collected in an aerogel and returned to Earth inside a small sealed capsule. Analysis of the dust could confirm the origin of the suspected meteorites on Earth from Mars. SCIM was studied in 2002 for the 2007 Mars Scout Program mission as a relatively low- cost, low-risk Mars sample return.

In 2009 the municipality had a population of 10,932 inhabitants. It is 80 km from Ciudad Real and 60 km from Toledo. Consuegra is located in La Mancha region, famous for its extensive dry plains, vineyards and historical constructions such as windmills. The principal economy sector is agriculture. The industry is predominated by textile and wood. Tourism has become a new economical source in the 21st century. The castle and the windmills are Consuegra's most important monuments. Most Spanish windmills, like those described in Miguel de Cervantes' early 17th century novel Don Quixote, can be found in the community of Castilla-La Mancha, in central Spain. The best examples of restored Spanish windmills may be found in Consuegra where several mills spike the hill just outside town, giving a view of the 12th-century castle and of the town. Windmills are also located in Mota del Cuervo, Tomelloso, and Campo de Criptana. History The settlement dates back to pre-Roman times. The Romans dammed the river Amarguillo upstream from Consuegra to regulate the water supply. The castle was once a stronghold of the Knights of San Juan, the Spanish branch of the Knights Hospitaller of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem. Main sights  Windmills  Windmills of Consuegra Consuegra is famous due to its windmills. They became famous in the 17th century, when Don Quixote was first published. The introduction of the windmills was made by \\"Caballeros Sanjuanistas\\", who brought these machines that helped millers. These machines used the wind to grind grain (the most common grain is wheat). The windmills were transmitted from fathers to sons. They usually consisted of two rooms or levels. Millers had to carry sacks of grains that could weigh 60 or 70 kilos to the top floor, they rotated the sails of the windmill as the top part of the windmill or dome was movable. They stopped being used at the beginning of the 1980s. Some of the most important parts of the windmill are: *Tunnel or canal: through it the grain goes down. *Container: where the grain is stored *Piece of wood: for moving the sails All of them had names to differentiate one from another: ; Names in 1963 * La zorra * La tuerta * Mochilas * Vista alegre * Panza * Bolero * Santo domingo * Chispas * Rastrero * Por si pega * Bateria * Espartero * Blanco ; Names today * Sin nombre * Clavile√±o * Chispas * Espartero * Rucio * Carde√±o * Caballero del verde gab√°n * Alcancia * Ruinas * Sancho * Mambrino * Bolero There were 13 windmills originally, but 12 have been reconstructed.  Castle of Consuegra  Castle of La Muela The original fortress at the site was perhaps built by emperor Trajan, but historical records only recall that a fortress here was initially built by Almanzor. During the Reconquest, in times of Alfonso VIII to the Knights Hospitaller. In 1813 it was destroyed during the Peninsular War. In 1962 the castle was ceded to the town hall and underwent a period of reconstruction. This received an impulse in 1985 with the creation of the School Workshop, whose activity continue today.  Town hall and major square  The town hall is in Renaissance style and it is located at the major square, called \\"Plaza de Espa√±a\\". It was built on 1670. Joined to the townhall it is the \\"La torre del reloj\\". In this square is the building called \\"Los Corredores\\" (17th century), which is a typical structure of La Mancha and which was an old townhall. Crafts The crafts are a tradition of \\"consuegra\\" noted for its quality and variety. The raw materials with these products are created normally are autochthonous, and are mainly from that region. In the city can be found workshops of classically designed items, in which there are elaborate doors, iems, and furniture for domestic use, such as chairs or bedrooms and two great workshops in stone.  Festivals  The last October weekend includes the Rose of Saffron. This festival started in 1963. It is divided into several sections: the grain of wheat in Sancho's windmill, the choosing of a \\"Dulcinea\\" by the townsfolk, and a gastronomic competition. It was created in 1962 by D. Oscar Dignoes. Some of its important celebrations are \\"San Ant√≥n\\", Easter or its own celebrations from 20‚Äì25 September, its more distinguish celebrations are \\"La Fiesta de La Rosa del Azafr√°n\\" and \\"Consuegra Medieval\\".

It was first published in his short story collection Life Along the Passaic River (1938); it is also available in The Doctor Stories (1984), a collection of Williams' fiction that is still in print. Summary The story is narrated in the first person by a physician, who is making a house call to tend to a sick girl. Fearing she may have diphtheria, the doctor decides to check her throat. However, the girl refuses to open her mouth, and the doctor uses force to restrain her and examine her throat with a spoon, which angers the girl. The doctor finds that, against her own self-interest, the girl has hidden the symptoms of diphtheria from her parents and the doctor. Analysis The story is written without the use of quotation marks, and the dialogue is not distinguished from the narrator's comments. The story is rendered from the subjective point of view of the doctor and explores both his admiration for the child and disgust with the parents,\\"After all, I had already fallen in love with the savage brat, the parents were contemptible to me.\\" and his guilty enjoyment of forcefully subduing the stubborn child in an attempt to acquire the throat sample.\\"But the worst of it was that I too had got beyond reason. I could have torn the child apart in my own fury and enjoyed it. It was a pleasure to attack her.\\" The overall theme of the story revolves around power and submission, and the doctor's unnerved feeling during the forceful encounter.

According to the 2008 census (INE), the municipality has a population of 1819 inhabitants. On June 4, 2007 signed a twinning agreement with the towns of Vouill√© (department of Deux-S√®vres, Poitou-Charentes, France) and Tournai (Wallonia region, Belgium), to promote cultural exchanges and develop a cultural tour of Europe, on the occasion of the fifteenth centenary of the Battle of Vouill√©. In that town near Poitiers, Clovis I, king of the Franks, defeated the Visigoths of Alaric II in 507. Tournai was the first capital of the Franks under kings Clovis and Childericus. The name The name \\"Guadamur\\" () is believed by some scholars to come from an Arabic term meaning 'the river of the waves'. Others suggest that the word derives from wadi al-mur 'river of the wall', referring to a Roman Visigothic hydraulic engineering construction here: the resulting name under this hypothesis is a hybrid of Arabic word wadi, \\"river valley\\" and the Latin word murus, \\"wall\\". Wadi, (), is a word of Arabic origin used to describe river valleys for much of the year dried up, but subject to dangerously sudden water surges.) History  Origins Castle of Guadamur (photo by Paolo Monti). Detail of the towers of the castle Archaeological remains before our era are rare, but there are a few lithic finds (a Neolithic scraper, a hatchet) difficult to date. Guadamur is too far from Paleolithic settlements nearby (in the province of Madrid). The residents of the area before the arrival of the Roman receive the designation of Carpetani by geographer Strabo. Near Guadamur are Celtic place names as Alpu√©brega, La Brega or Castrej√≥n. Archaeological findings, although limited, demonstrate the Roman presence in the town and its surroundings: coins, a cameo, a stele of limestone and a brake horse dated in the 2nd century. It is necessary to add pieces reused by the Visigoths, and remains of columns, plates and statues of Carrara marble. There wasn‚Äôt a Roman settlement in Guadamur in particular, but it seems secure the existence of a Roman road of the second order and the likely existence of a villa in the area of the old road to Toledo. The local name Portusa, a ford of the Tagus to 8 km northwest of Guadamur, points to the area as a place of transit. Middle Ages The Visigothic period (409-711) left Guadamur the most interesting chapter in its history. In August 1858, heavy storms over Guadamur uncovered a series of tombs at the site of the gardens of Guarrazar. Neighbours Francisco Morales and Mar√≠a P√©rez discovered the Treasure of Guarrazar by chance; it is the most important of those found in the Peninsula on the Visigoth era. These findings, other of some neighbors and the archaeological excavation of the Ministry of Public Works and the Royal Academy of History (April 1859), they formed a group consisting of: six crowns, five crosses, a pendant and remnants of foil and channels (almost all of gold, now at the National Archaeological Museum of Madrid), a crown and a gold cross and a stone engraved with the Annunciation (now in the Royal Palace of Madrid), three crowns, two crosses, links and gold pendants (now at the Musee de Cluny, Paris), a crown, and other fragments of a tiller with a crystal ball (stolen from the Royal Palace of Madrid in 1921 and still whereabouts unknown). The most valuable of all is the crown of king Recesvinto (which today names the main square of the town): blue sapphire parts come from the former Ceylon, now Sri Lanka. There were also many fragments of sculptures and the remains of a building, perhaps a Roman delubrum (sanctuary or place of purification); in the following centuries it was dedicated to Christian worship as a church or oratory, which housed a number of graves: in the most important was found a skeleton lying on a bed of lime and sand, and preserved the stone slate, whose Latin inscription mentions a priest named Crisp√≠n, dating from 693 (51st year of the reign of √âgica, year of the 16th Council of Toledo. This plaque is now in the National Archeological Museum in Madrid. According to some hypothesis, Guarrazar was a monastery that served as a hideout for the real treasure of the court, Toledo churches and monasteries to prevent their capture by the Muslims: the monastery of Sancta Maria in Sorbaces, according to the inscription of the S√≥nnica cross, a piece of the treasure of Guarrazar preserved in Paris. Castillete of Mina de graffito de Guadamur Hermitage of the Virgin of the Nativity Besides its own name, there are in the vicinity of Guadamur more Moorish remains in the form of name: Daramaz√°n \\"fortified home\\"; Daramezas, \\"home of table or plateau\\"; Guajaraz\\", river of thorns \\"; Guarrazar\\", valley of lead\\"; Zuarraz, \\"little canal\\"; Aguanel \\"water of the well\\"; Aceituno, \\"the olive grove\\". The capitulation of Toledo in 1085 made Almohades and Almoravids attempt to unseat Christians as strategic position. The region, in the next one hundred years, was devastated by attacks and counterattacks by both sides. Initiated recruitment in times of Alfonso VII, Guadamur appears as the village council of Toledo, who pay taxes and which jurisdiction depends. There is documentation which provides proof of the existence of traditional private property of citizens from Toledo around Guadamur and this can be traced to the reign taifa by the Arabic names of the farms. Since the late 12th century these properties were passed into the hands of the clergy, especially the regular. During the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries, this land was in a progression towards the noble scheme, and it begins to feel the shame of servitude in a monarchical decomposition, strengthened nobility, peasant resistance, religious conflict, plague and livelihood crisis. Guadamur entered medieval history under the hand of Pedro L√≥pez Ayala, son of the royal chancellor and mayor of Toledo, whose family disputes control to the Silva. He intervened in the war that pitted Juan II and favorite √Ålvaro with infants of Aragon, Don Enrique and Don Juan, and ended up giving Toledo in 1440. Lost ground, Juan II forgave Pedro in 1444; in 1446 won Guadamur, among other possessions, as a royal granting. This date marks the beginning of four centuries of manorial system in the town: the town became a possession of an absolute landlord that judges, punishes, fines, legislates, chooses the authorities and subjects the villains to taxes and benefits. The son of Don Pedro was the first Count of Fuensalida (1470); two years before he had obtained permission from the king to build a castle in Guadamur, probably on a previous moose Arabic watchtower. It holds the shields of the Ayala and the Silva families, rivals in medieval Toledo. The 15th century also dates the nearby shrine of Our Lady of the Nativity, influenced by the Toledo Mud√©jar style. Modern Age In 1471 Guadamur obtained the title of town. In these years is also built a pillory on the square of the village, insignia of jurisdiction and execution, which replaced the old gallows of wood (still a hill not far from the castle retains the name of \\"Cerro de la Horca\\"). Guadamur's City Hall The III Count of Fuensalida (1489‚Äì1537) hosted Prince Don Felipe and Do√±a Juana in Guadamur on July 11, 1502, who had just been appointed heir and heiress to the Crown of the Kingdom of Castile. In 1590, during the reign of Philip II, the castle serves as a secret prison of the Inquisition. The Vi Count participated in the expulsion of the Moors (1609) recruiting 126 young men and weapons in Guadamur. The IX Count was appointed by Charles II Captain General of the Kingdom of Sardinia and Captain General of Milan. In the 17th century Fuensalida County reaches its maximum expansion: 10,000 inhabitants and 40,000 ha, the second state of the kingdom of Toledo. In the Cadastre of Ensenada, which collects data at the villa from 1752, mention is made of \\"tithes and first fruits of which are caught in it\\" and go, inter alia, to the parish of Guadamur, to the coffers of the King, to the Cardinal Archbishop of Toledo, to the canons of the Cathedral of Toledo and the parishes of Santo Tom√©, Santa Leocadia, San Mart√≠n, San Rom√°n, San Gin√©s, San Antol√≠n, San Nicol√°s, La Magdalena, San Andr√©s, San Justo, San Vicente, the Mozarabic, Santa Eulalia and Santa Justa. The history of the county ended in 1843 just when the Government granted the noble properties of Guadamur to the neighbours of the town. In the 16th century there were two local pastures (dehesas): in the Old one grazed herds of Segovian Mesta. In the New one were seventy hives in the 18th century, which produced abundant honey and beeswax. The Toledan archbishop Sil√≠ceo (1546) built a bridge over the Guajaraz. Dating from this period is also the parish church of St. Mary Magdalene and the hermitage of San Antonio Abad, San Ant√≥n popularly (though the saint who was venerated in it until the mid-19th century was San Sebasti√°n). The chapel now houses the Museum of Popular Arts and Customs of the Montes de Toledo. Contemporary Age At the end of 1808 Guadamur receives a detachment of French cavalry which was part of Napoleon's troops entered Toledo on December 13. Are installed in the castle, then abandoned but in good use (as the pastor of the town, Juan Jos√© de Funes, wrote in 1788). According to documents from 1811, the village contributes towards supplying the infantry and artillery troops quartered in Mazarambroz with daily rations of bread, meat, wine, pulses, salt, oil, coal, wood, barley straw and bran. The resistance of the population has led some young people to integrate into the line of guerrilla of Ambrosio Carmena, \\"El Pellejero\\". In September 1812 the population vowed solemnly the Constitution of Cadiz. The confiscation of church property in the 19th century affected Guadamur to the extent that many neighbours, who had leased land in the municipality owned by the Catholic Church, saw how they were sold at auction. In some cases, the new owner terminated the contract, in others it increased. For example, one of the largest estates, Daramezas, passed from the hands of the nuns of the Monastery of Santo Domingo el Real de Toledo to private hands, and the estate of Aceituno, which belonged since 1221 to the Toledan convent of San Clemente, came to lay hands. In some cases the lands were purchased by tenants of the villa. In 1834 established the Banda Municipal de M√∫sica, which is still active. The Constitution of 1837 gave the go-ahead to the creation of the militia, military companies in most of the municipalities comprising the neighbors. The Guadamur militia were mobilized on several occasions at the end of this decade to try to neutralize Carlists that were sheltered in the Montes de Toledo. The farmers suffered continual theft of cattle, and ended up signing a mutual aid agreement for such an eventuality. The exploitation of the subsoil, which dates back at least 1612, when an exploding mine of lead and other of khol (used in cosmetics), gaining momentum with graphite mine in the last third of the 19th century . These mines have reached 110 workers, drawing up to 400 metric tons annually in 1963 and closed without depleting the grain graphite by German competition. In 1887 the town sold the castle to the sixth count of Asalto, a distant relative of Ayala, who inherits from his son, the Marquis de Arg√ºeso, Member of Parliament for Tarragona. For his personal interest is obtained the grant of the phone in 1922. The castle will not reach the category of historical-artistic monument to 1964. In the late 19th century, being mayor Lorenzo Navas, former colonial governor of Tarlac (Philippines), the old well of the council is replaced by a four-pipe now defunct (in Recesvinto Square) and a trough-pillar that gave name to the Plaza del Pilar. The water will not reach the houses of Guadamur until 1928, after the lighting (1907). Second Republic With the advent of the Second Spanish Republic Guadamur called the creation of the first labor union, the General Union of Workers (UGT), whose local Society (Casa del Pueblo) was located on the street of San Ant√≥n. Then began the construction of the Public Schools (1935), which today houses the Center of Treasury of Guarrazar. The democratic regime also built Nueva street, populated by day laborers and small farmers and by then the only street-level and straight people; it presented a harmonious arrangement of facades, patios and height that has not survived to this day. After the coup of July 18, 1936, Guadamur remained under the government of the Second Spanish Republic until the final days of the Spanish Civil War. In November 1936 a battalion of the Regiment of Militia led by Manuel Castro Iglesias in conscript socialists peasants. In December of that year the City Council resumed their regular sessions, after a first moment that the Defense Committee relegated it to the secondary. It is politically unitary because the seven councilors belong to the Spanish Federation of Workers of the Earth (FETT-UGT). At this time Guadamur presents an example of integral collectivism: only two farms occupied by then 52.2% of the municipality, and after the military uprising was the seizure of these and others, as well as small shops and homes of considered enemies of the Republic. On August 25, 1936 establishes the community \\"Pablo Iglesias\\" and the entire municipality integrated into it, breaking the boundaries of private property and dividing the land into plots. The Committee took the responsibility of supplies, trade and the only tavern. The parish church and chapels of the Nativity and San Ant√≥n became barns, warehouses. The castle suffered looting of several rooms, including the library. The Municipal Council, like many other peoples of Republican Spain, issued its own currency. On May 7, 1937 the Nationalist army broke the front to the south of the city of Toledo and penetrates to the north of the municipality of Guadamur; in such action captured the neighbouring population of Arg√©s, recovered by Republican forces a few days later. Between 12 and May 25 the 11th Division of the Republican People's Army under the command of the communist Enrique L√≠ster, held rallies (with concert and cinema) in the area: in Guadamur was in front of City Hall and the street the Nativity, and took representatives of the town, delegates of workers from factories in Madrid and representatives of the Division. In October 1937 the district was integrated gradually losing its originality, as in many other places, under pressure from its communist partners, who advocated a cooperative basis to small farmers, industry and services arising from the fragmentation. In October 1938, this pressure led to a plot to give the day labourers who wanted to secede from the commune. This initiative, already converted into agricultural cooperative market, was dissolved at the end of that year. On March 27, 1939 Nationalist troops took the town. Francoist Spain The \\"General Cause\\" recorded 45 victims due to the revolutionary suppression, number of outstanding research by-case basis, because for sure there will be victims who were entered in their villages. As regards to the repression carried out by Francoist Spain, apart from the 26 fatalities recorded natural Guadamur, many residents went to the new state prison and suffered humiliation, exile, banishment and condemnation to death, sometimes switched with the customary charge of \\"assisting the rebellion.\\" In Francoist Spain councilmen were chosen by at least two thirds coming out of three groups formed by the heads of households in the municipality (men for the most part, except for widows and women aged over 25 living alone); the members of the unions based in the Borough (just one in fact, the Franco's one) and the group that made up the so-called \\"prestigious neighbors.\\" Of course, it was always personal applications, because political parties were illegal. In small towns, as Guadamur, the mayor got his position by appointment of the Provincial Governor and Head of the ‚ÄòMovimiento‚Äô, the single-party. Restoration of democracy On April 3, 1979 democratic elections are held again, after the general election June 1977. Since then, Guadamur mayors had contested the elections under the acronym of UCD (Uni√≥n de Centro Democr√°tico), PSOE (Partido Socialista Obrero Espa√±ol) and PP (Partido Popular).

UC is not necessarily a single product, but a set of products that provides a consistent unified user interface and user experience across multiple devices and media types. In its broadest sense, the UC can encompass all forms of communications that are exchanged via a network to include other forms of communications such as Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) and digital signage Communications as they become an integrated part of the network communications deployment and may be directed as one-to-one communications or broadcast communications from one to many. UC allows an individual to send a message on one medium and receive the same communication on another medium. For example, one can receive a voicemail message and choose to access it through e-mail or a cell phone. If the sender is online according to the presence information and currently accepts calls, the response can be sent immediately through text chat or a video call. Otherwise, it may be sent as a non-real-time message that can be accessed through a variety of media. Definition There are varying definitions for unified communications. A basic definition is \\"communications integrated to optimize business processes and increase user productivity,\\" but such integration can take many forms, such as: users simply adjusting their habits, manual integration as defined by procedures and training, integration of communications into off-the-shelf tools such as Thunderbird, Outlook, Lotus Notes, BlackBerry, Salesforce.com, etc., or purpose-specific integration into customized applications in specific operating departments or in vertical markets such as healthcare. Unified communications is an evolving set of technologies that automates and unifies human and device communications in a common context and experience. It optimizes business processes and enhances human communications by reducing latency, managing flows, and eliminating device and media dependencies. History The history of unified communications is tied to the evolution of the supporting technology. Originally, business telephone systems were a private branch exchange (PBX) or key telephone system provided and managed by the local phone company. These systems used the phone company's analog or digital circuits to deliver phone calls from a central office (CO) to the customer. The system --PBX or key telephone system-- accepted the call and routed the call to the appropriate extension or line appearance on the phones at the customer's office. In the 1980s, voice mail systems with IVR-like features were recognized as an access mechanism to corporate information for mobile employees, before the explosion of cell phones and the proliferation of PCs. E-mail also began to grow in popularity, and as early as 1985, e-mail reading features were made available for certain voicemail. The term unified communications arose in the mid-1990s, when messaging and real-time communications began to combine. In 1993, ThinkRite (VoiceRite) developed the unified messaging system, POET, for IBM's internal use. It was installed in 55 IBM US Branch Offices for 54,000 employees and integrated with IBM OfficeVision/VM (PROFS) and provided IBMers with one phone number for voicemail, fax, alphanumeric paging and follow-me. POET was in use until 2000. In the late 1990s, a New Zealand-based organization called IPFX developed a commercially available presence product, which let users see the location of colleagues, make decisions on how to contact them, and define how their messages were handled based on their own presence. The first full-featured converged telephony/UC offering was the Nortel Succession MX (Multimedia eXchange) product, which later became known as Nortel Multimedia Communications Server (MCS 5100). The major drawback to this service was the reliance on the phone company or vendor partner to manage (in most cases) the PBX or key telephone system. This resulted in a residual, recurring cost to customers. Over time, the PBX became more privatized, and internal staff members were hired to manage these systems. This was typically done by companies that could afford to bring this skill in-house and thereby reduce the requirement to notify the phone company or their local PBX vendor each time a change was required in the system. This increasing privatization triggered the development of more powerful software that increased the usability and manageability of the system. As companies began to deploy IP networks in their environment, companies began to use these networks to transmit voice instead of relying on traditional telephone network circuits. Some vendors such as Avaya and Nortel created circuit packs or cards for their PBX systems that could interconnect their communications systems to the IP network. Other vendors such as Cisco created equipment that could be placed in routers to transport voice calls across a company network from site to site. The termination of PBX circuits to be transported across a network and delivered to another phone system is traditionally referred to as Voice over IP (Voice over Internet Protocol or VoIP). This design required special hardware on both ends of the network equipment to provide the termination and delivery at each site. As time went by, Siemens, Alcatel-Lucent, Cisco, Nortel, Avaya, Wildix and Mitel realized the potential for eliminating the traditional PBX or key system and replacing it with a solution based on IP. This IP solution is software driven only, and thereby does away with the need for \\"switching\\" equipment at a customer site (save the equipment necessary to connect to the outside world). This created a new technology, now called IP telephony. A system that uses IP-based telephony services only, rather than a legacy PBX or key system, is called an IP telephony solution. With the advent of IP telephony the handset was no longer a digital device hanging off a copper loop from a PBX. Instead, the handset lived on the network as another computer device. The transport of audio was therefore no longer a variation in voltages or modulation of frequency such as with the handsets from before, but rather encoding the conversation using a CODEC (G.711 originally) and transporting it with a protocol such as the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP). When the handset is just another computer connected to the network, advanced features can be provided by letting computer applications communicate with server computers elsewhere in any number of ways; applications can even be upgraded or freshly installed on the handset. When considering the efforts of Unified Communications solutions providers, the overall goal is to no longer focus strictly on the telephony portion of daily communications. The unification of all communication devices inside a single platform provides the mobility, presence, and contact capabilities that extend beyond the phone to all devices a person may use or have at their disposal.History - Courtesy of Mark H. Turpin, Senior Consultant - Unified Communications, Calence, LLC Given the wide scope of unified communications, there has been a lack of community definition as most solutions are from proprietary vendors. Since March 2008, there are several open source projects with a UC focus such as Druid and Elastix, which are based on Asterisk, a leading open source telephony project. The aim of these open source UC projects is to allow the open source community of developers and users to have a say in unified communications and what it means. IBM entered the unified communications marketplace with several products, beginning in 2006 with the updated release of a unified communications middleware platform, IBM Lotus Sametime 7.5, as well as related products and services such as IBM WebSphere Unified Messaging, IBM Global Technology Services - Converged Communications Services, and more. In October 2007, Microsoft entered the UC market with the launch of Office Communications Server, a software-based application running on Windows. In March 2008, Unison Technologies launched Unison, a software-based unified communications solution that runs on Linux and Windows. In May 2010, the Unified Communications Interoperability Forum (UCIF) was announced. UCIF is an independent, non- profit alliance between technology companies that creates and tests interoperability profiles, implementation guidelines, and best practices for interoperability between UC products and existing communications and business applications. The original founding members were HP, Juniper Networks, Logitech / LifeSize, Microsoft, and Polycom. There is some debate about whether unified communications hosted on an enterprise's premises is the same thing as unified communications solutions that are hosted by a service provider, or UCaaS (UC as a Service). While both offer their respective advantages, all of these approaches can be grouped under the single umbrella category of unified communications. Technology Contrasting unified messaging Unified communications is sometimes confused with unified messaging, but it is distinct. Unified communications refers to both real-time and non-real-time delivery of communications based on the preferred method and location of the recipient; unified messaging culls messages from several sources (such as e-mail, voice mail and faxes), but holds those messages only for retrieval at a later time. Unified communications allows for an individual to check and retrieve an e-mail or voice mail from any communication device at any time. It expands beyond voice mail services to data communications and video services. Components  With unified communications, multiple modes of business communications are integrated. Unified communications is not a single product but a collection of elements that includes: * Call control and multimodal communications * Presence * Instant messaging * Unified messaging * Speech access and personal assistant * Conferencing (audio, Web and video) * Collaboration tools * Mobility * Business process integration (BPI) * Software to enable business process integration Presence--knowing where intended recipients are, and if they are available, in real time--is a key component of unified communications. Unified communications integrates all systems a user might already use, and helps those systems work together in real time. For example, unified communications technology could allow a user to seamlessly collaborate with another person on a project, even if the two users are in separate locations. The user could quickly locate the necessary person by accessing an interactive directory, engage in a text messaging session, and then escalate the session to a voice call, or even a video call. In another example, an employee receives a call from a customer who wants answers. Unified communications enables that employee to call an expert colleague from a real-time list. This way, the employee can answer the customer faster by eliminating rounds of back-and-forth e-mails and phone-tag. The examples in the previous paragraph primarily describe \\"personal productivity\\" enhancements that tend to benefit the individual user. While such benefits can be important, enterprises are finding that they can achieve even greater impact by using unified communications capabilities to transform business processes. This is achieved by integrating UC functionality directly into the business applications using development tools provided by many of the suppliers. Instead of the individual user invoking the UC functionality to, say, find an appropriate resource, the workflow or process application automatically identifies the resource at the point in the business activity where one is needed. When used in this manner, the concept of presence often changes. Most people associate presence with instant messaging (IM \\"buddy lists\\") the status of individuals is identified. But, in many business process applications, what is important is finding someone with a certain skill. In these environments, presence identifies available skills or capabilities. This \\"business process\\" approach to integrating UC functionality can result in bottom line benefits that are an order of magnitude greater than those achievable by personal productivity methods alone.  Related concepts  Unified communications & collaboration (UCC) is the integration of various communications methods with collaboration tools such as virtual white boards, real-time audio and video conferencing, and enhanced call control capabilities. Before this fusion of communications and collaboration tools into a single platform, enterprise collaboration service vendors and enterprise communications service vendors offered distinctly different solutions. Now, collaboration service vendors also offer communications services, and communications service providers have developed collaboration tools. Unified communications & collaboration as a service (UCCaaS) is cloud- based UCC platforms. Compared to premises-based UCC solutions, UCCaaS platforms offer enhanced flexibility and scalability due to the SaaS subscription model.

Creation The photograph was taken by then-30-year-old Martin Elliott in September 1976 and features 18-year-old Fiona Butler (now Walker), his girlfriend at the time. The photo was taken at the University of Birmingham's tennis courts (formerly Edgbaston Lawn Tennis Club) in Edgbaston Park Road, Birmingham, England. The site is occupied now by the university's Tennis Court halls of residence. The dress was hand-made by Butler's friend Carol Knotts, from a Simplicity Pattern with added lace trim. Knotts also supplied the tennis racquet, with all of the borrowed items later returned by Butler to Knotts after the shoot with a box of chocolates. Butler borrowed the plimsolls from her father, whilst the tennis balls were those used as playthings by her family's pet dog. History The image was first published as part of a calendar by Athena for the 1977 Silver Jubilee, the same year Virginia Wade achieved the Wimbledon ladies' singles title. Athena then negotiated a licence to distribute the image as a poster, where from 1978 it achieved widespread distribution, selling over 2 million copies at ¬£2 per poster. Although Athena went into administration in 1995, the picture remains a popular print to buy and can be found at other retailers like Amazon, AllPosters & King and McGaw. Butler, who broke up with Elliot three years later, said in retrospect that she was not embarrassed about posing, nor bitter that she did not receive any royalties from the photo. Butler (now Walker) is a mother of three, who works as a freelance illustrator in Droitwich Spa, Worcestershire. Elliott died on 24 March 2010. Knotts, now a barrister living in Gloucestershire, put the dress and racquet up for sale at an auction on 5 July 2014, the day of the 2014 Wimbledon Championships ‚Äì Women's Singles final. The dress was sold for ¬£15,000, while the racquet went for between ¬£1000-¬£2000. Athena Tennis Girl poster dress is now part of the Wimbledon Museum collection. Subject doubts In February 2015, Peter Atkinson from Marsh Gate, Cornwall, came forward to insist the photo was actually of his ex-wife, producing in evidence two items, one showing the same image and the other a close variant (seemingly taken on the same occasion), both of which were dated 1974, two years before Fiona Butler's photo shoot. Parody Over the years, the picture has been parodied by various people as diverse as former tennis star Pat Cash, singer and actress Kylie Minogue and comedian Alan Carr with actor Keith Lemon featuring his parody in his 2012 calendar. It was also imitated in an advertisement for a tennis video game called Davis Cup World Tour for the Sega. As an election promise for the 2012 Belgian elections, a 22-year-old Belgian woman from Sint-Truiden promised to publish a nude photo shoot when receiving 1,000 votes. She released a picture of herself in the Tennis Girl pose prior to the elections. In 2009, it was also parodied in the exit scene from episode 12 from the sixth series of Shameless when Lillian Tyler, a character played by Alice Barry, gets up and walks towards the door after winning a game console version of tennis. On 9 May 2016, it was displayed by Mark Hamill on Twitter from his @HamillHimself account as Princess Leia walking toward Tatooine buildings with a blaster in her hand instead of a tennis racquet. The background of Martin Rowson's cartoon, \\"Don't feed the Trolls\\", appears to show a poster of Donald Trump as Tennis Girl.

The aqueduct was built in the middle of the 18th century to bring fresh water from the Carioca River to the population of the city. It is a typical example of colonial architecture and engineering. The Carioca Aqueduct is located in the centre of the city, in the Lapa neighbourhood, and is frequently called Arcos da Lapa (Lapa Arches) by Brazilian people. Since the end of the 19th century the aqueduct serves as a bridge for a popular tram that connects the city centre with the Santa Teresa neighbourhood uphill, the Santa Teresa Tramway. History In the early history of Rio de Janeiro, the nucleus of the city was surrounded by swamps with water of bad quality, and fresh water had to be carried manually from streams located relatively far from the city. Since at least 1602 there had been plans to build a system of canals to bring water from the source of the Carioca river, located on Santa Teresa hill, to Rio de Janeiro. Colonial authorities attempted to build canals, but the construction was always hampered by technical and financial difficulties. By the end of the 17th century there were only a few hundred metres of canalisation completed. thumb|left|250px|The Carioca Aqueduct by famous painter Leandro Joaquim (c. 1790). Santa Teresa hill and its convent are seen to the left. The lagoon in the foreground was landfilled to build the Passeio P√∫blico. After 1706, construction of the aqueduct was given a fresh impulse by authorities. During the rule of governor Aires de Saldanha (1719‚Äì1725) it was decided that the canals, which at the time reached the Campo da Ajuda (today's Cinel√¢ndia square), should reach the Santo Ant√¥nio square (today's Largo da Carioca), which was closer to the centre of the city. Construction of the first aqueduct was finished in 1723, and clean water flowed directly to a decorative Baroque fountain in Santo Ant√¥nio Square, to the relief of the people of Rio de Janeiro. This first aqueduct was already in bad shape by 1744, when governor Gomes Freire de Andrade (1733‚Äì1763) ordered the building of a new, larger structure. The works were encharged to Portuguese military engineer Jos√© Fernandes Pinto Alpoim, who was inspired by similar structures in Portugal, like the √Åguas Livres Aqueduct in Lisbon. The aqueduct was inaugurated in 1750. Santa Teresa tram over the aqueduct arches The most impressive feature of the aqueduct is the course that connects the hills of Santa Teresa and Santo Ant√¥nio, in today's Lapa neighbourhood. This segment of the aqueduct spans 270 metres and consists of two storeys of monumental arches - 42 in total - with a maximum height of 17.6 metres. In colonial times, water from the Carioca Aqueduct reached several fountains scattered through Rio de Janeiro, including those in Santo Ant√¥nio Square, Ajuda Square (Cinel√¢ndia) and the Terreiro do Pa√ßo (today's Pra√ßa XV). At the end of the 18th century, as the waters of the Carioca river were insufficient to feed the aqueduct, water from other streams were also diverted to its canals. Tramway The aqueduct was deactivated at the end of the 19th century, as new alternatives to supply water to Rio were developed. The structure was adapted in 1896 to serve as a viaduct for a tram linethe Bonde de Santa Teresa (Santa Teresa Tramway)that transports passengers between the centre of Rio and the hilly Santa Teresa neighbourhood. The picturesque ride is popular among locals and tourists alike. The Santa Teresa bonde (or bondinho, meaning \\"little tram\\") is the only tram still in operation in Rio de Janeiro, although the 2016-opened Rio de Janeiro Light Rail system is similar to a tramway on some sections. In the 1960s, several houses which had been built near the aqueduct were demolished, improving the visual impact of the monument. In August 2011, an accident occurred when brakes apparently failed and left five people dead. In response, all service was indefinitely suspended, but plans to rebuild the line and replace the old tramcars (with faux-vintage replicas) were subsequently approved. Limited service on a portion of the lineincluding across the former aqueductbegan operating again in July 2015. Panoramic view References *Jos√© de Souza Reis. Os Arcos da Carioca.

He has taught as a visiting professor in Japan and Israel and has worked as a consultant with the United States government, the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank and UNESCO. In 2000, Rosovsky chaired the Task Force on Higher Education and Society with Mamphela Ramphele. The Task Force was convened by the World Bank and UNESCO to explore the future of higher education in developing countries. Its report, Peril and Promise, argued that higher education systems in poor countries are in crisis and made a case for renewed investment, curricular reform and improved standards of governance. Rosovsky is the author of Capital Formation in Japan (1961), Quantitative Japanese Economic History (1961), Japanese Economic Growth (with K.

Olupona is a Nigerian American professor at the Harvard Divinity School with a joint appointment as Professor of African and African American Studies in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard University.  Biography  Jacob K. Olupona is a scholar of indigenous African religions who came to Harvard after serving as a professor at the University of California, Davis. He is working on a study of the religious practices of the estimated one million Africans who have emigrated to the United States over the last 40 years, examining in particular several populations that remain relatively invisible in the American religious landscape: \\"reverse missionaries\\" who have come to the U.S. to establish churches, African Pentecostals in American congregations, American branches of independent African churches, and indigenous African religious communities in the U.S. His earlier research includes African spirituality and ritual practices, spirit possession, Pentecostalism, Yoruba festivals, animal symbolism, icons, phenomenology, and religious pluralism in Africa and the Americas. In his forthcoming book Ile- Ife: The City of 201 Gods, he examines the modern urban mixing of ritual, royalty, gender, class, and power, and how the structure, content, and meaning of religious beliefs and practices permeate daily life. He has authored or edited seven other books, including Kingship, Religion, and Rituals in a Nigerian Community: A Phenomenological Study of Ondo Yoruba Festivals, which has been used for ethnographic research among Yoruba-speaking communities. Olupona has received grants from the Guggenheim Foundation, the American Philosophical Society, the Ford Foundation, the Davis Humanities Institute, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Wenner-Gren Foundation, and the Getty Foundation. He has served on the editorial boards of three journals and as president of the African Association for the Study of Religion. In 2000, Olupona received an honorary doctorate in divinity from the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. Jacob K. Olupona received his BA from the University of Nigeria and his MA and Ph.D. from Boston University.  Early Life and Education  Jacob K. Olupona was born into a family where the lineages of both parents were well known Anglican and non-Anglican priests. The many religious activities and denominations he experienced in the villages, towns and cities he grew up in interested him, greatly. He watched as people mix traditions. As he grew older, the perception of multi-religious traditions of Islam, Christianity and indigenous religion opened spaces for the drive for his early scholarship on the ideology and rituals of Yoruba sacred kingship. He graduated from the University in 1975 and did his National Youth Service Corp (NYSC) in Ilorin. During his service year in Ilorin, the host Governor of Kwara state, Colonel Ibrahim Taiwo was killed in a military coup as well as General Murtala Muhammed which filled the nation with unease in 1976. The memorial church service held for the general and the preaching of an Anglican Priest in the event heightened his scholarly imagination. Jacob K. Olupona began to think deeply of the connection of religious pluralism and civil religion in Nigeria. These events made him appreciate his own religious background and the freedom of worship in southwestern Nigeria.

It was written by David Robey, a former drama professor at Cedarville University, and produced by Lillenas Drama in 1988. Bridge of Blood is based on Through Gates of Splendor and Shadow of the Almighty, two books written by Elisabeth Elliot. Consequently, the character of Elisabeth in the play is also the narrator. All of the characters' monologues were taken directly from their own letters, diaries and journals. The play was originally published in the 1988 book Two for Missions, which also included For This Cause, a drama about John and Betty Stam. In December 1996, the play was republished in the book Three with a Mission, which added to the original two plays, The World Is My Parish, a drama about John Wesley. The 1996 version of the play added an introductory scene. Synopsis The first act of the play focuses on the background of the five missionaries, especially Jim Elliot and Nate Saint. All the men and their wives eventually move to Ecuador as missionaries, and as the act is about to close, Saint discovers the \\"Aucas\\" from his plane. This leads the men to begin making plans for Operation Auca. The second act describes the efforts of Operation Auca itself. The men make aerial gift drops to the Aucas and learn helpful Auca phrases. The play then focuses for some time on the night of January 2, 1956, the day before the men left for Auca territory. As they are busy making preparations, Pete comforts Olive who is worried about the safety of the expedition. All the missionaries then have prayer together and sing \\"We Rest on Thee\\". The men are killed five days later by the Aucas, and the play ends with Elisabeth telling about the eventual redemption of the Auca tribe through continued missionary efforts. Cast The cast includes 10 members - 5 men and 5 women. The main characters also double as minor characters during certain scenes, creating a virtual cast of 18. :(The 1996 publication added the \\"Host\\", an MC or the director of the play, who is not part of the cast. He or she only reads an introductory monologue after the first scene.)

It is native to central and western North America, from the Prairie Provinces of Canada (Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba) southwards in the United States as far as Ventura County in California, as well as northern Arizona, and northwestern New Mexico.Biota of North America Program 2014 county distribution map Description Shepherdia argentea is a deciduous shrub growing from tall. The leaves are arranged in opposite pairs (rarely alternately arranged), 2‚Äì6 cm long, oval with a rounded apex, green with a covering of fine silvery, silky hairs, more thickly silvery below than above. The flowers are pale yellow, with four sepals but no petals. The fruit is a bright red fleshy drupe 5 mm in diameter; it is edible but with a rather bitter taste.Jepson Flora: Shepherdia argentea Two cultivars, 'Xanthocarpa' and 'Goldeneye', form yellow fruit. Ecology The berry is one of the mainstays of the diet of the sharp-tailed grouse, the provincial bird of Saskatchewan. The foliage provides important forage for mule deer and white- tailed deer. The shrub's thorny branches and thicket forming habit provide a shelter for many small animal species and an ideal nesting site for songbirds. Over the extent of its range, the buffaloberry is an important species in a variety of ecological communities. For example, in the shrub-grassland communities of North Dakota it is found growing with many native grasses, while in riparian woodlands of Montana and Western North Dakota it can be found in plant communities dominated by green ash. Uses Like the Canada buffaloberry, Sheperdia argentea has been used historically as a food, medicine, and dye. Its various uses including the treatment of stomach troubles and in coming-of-age ceremonies for girls. In the Great Basin, the berries were eaten raw and dried for winter use, but more often cooked into a flavoring sauce for bison meat. The buffaloberry has been a staple food to some American Indians, who ate the berries in puddings, jellies, and in raw or dried form. The Gosiute Shoshone name for the plant is a√±-ka-mo-do-n√ªp.

It confers the same rank as an Ambassador of a foreign state. The resident coordinator is the designated representative of the UN secretary general and leader of United Nations Country Team of agencies such as UNICEF, WHO, WFP or UNFPA. The function was previously most often performed by the Resident Representative of the United Nations Development Programme.. However, following reforms of the UN development system that came into effect in 2019, the UN Resident Coordinators are employed by the United Nations Secretariat and report directly to the Secretary-General of the United Nations. The Resident Coordinator (RC) system encompasses all organizations of the United Nations system dealing with operational activities for development, regardless of their formal presence in the country. The RC system aims to bring together the different UN agencies to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of operational activities at the country level. Resident Coordinators, who are funded and managed by UNDP, lead UN country teams in more than 130 countries and are the designated representatives of the Secretary-General for development operations. Working closely with national governments, Resident Coordinators and country teams advocate the interests and mandates of the UN system while drawing on the support and guidance of the entire UN family. Coordinating development operations promotes more strategic support for national plans and priorities, makes operations more efficient and reduces transaction costs for governments. This helps the UN to be a more relevant and reliable partner for governments.  Further Details  The RC's role in the country is multifaceted, and his or her responsibilities include:UN RESIDENT COORDINATOR GENERIC JOB DESCRIPTION: see www.undg.org Ensuring the coordination of all UN operational activities; Assuming leadership within the UN system; Assuming the UN Humanitarian Coordinator (HC) role in case of an emergency and coordinating country-level response to humanitarian crises; Encouraging and facilitating stronger coordination and coherence for UN activities, and promoting the UN global agenda, including the UN reform agenda, at country level; Responsible for all common UN projects and initiatives designed to reflect corporate UN priorities, and are jointly implemented by all UN agencies represented in the country; Reporting on an annual basis to the Secretary General. The Resident Coordinator system (RCS) encompasses all organisations of the United Nations system (UNS) dealing with operational activities for development at country level regardless of their formal presence. The RCS facilitates the alignment of the UNS operational activities for development with national plans and priorities, to improve the effectiveness of the UNS overall contribution and coordination with other sources of development assistance. Within the RCS, the Resident Coordinator (RC) is the leader of the United Nations country team (UNCT) and as such plays a central role at the country level in making possible the coordination of UN operational activities for development. The RC is the designated representative of ‚Äì and reports to ‚Äì the Secretary-General (as chairman of the Chief Executives Board/CEB) through the UNDP Administrator in her/his capacity as chair of the United Nations Development Group (UNDG). The management of the RCS is anchored in UNDP; however, it is owned by the UNS as a whole and its proper functioning is participatory, collegial, and based on consensus and mutual accountability. The RCS has agreed (through the ‚ÄòManagement and Accountability System of the UN development and RC System, including the ‚Äúfunctional firewall‚Äù for the RC System‚Äô, and relevant implementation plan) to a long-term vision for a Resident Coordinator who: ‚Äúhas an equal relationship with, and responsibility to, all UNCT member agencies‚Äù; ‚Äúhas all the leadership qualities required to be an excellent team leader who can represent the whole UN development system effectively‚Äù; ‚Äúis empowered by clear recognition from each agency of his/her role in strategically positioning the UN in each country‚Äù; and ‚Äúbe supported, as required, with access to agencies‚Äô technical resources as agreed with the agencies Representatives balancing available resources with tasks to be performed‚Äù. However, the RC is also the UNDP Resident Representative (RC/RR), and as such s/he remains accountable for UNDP business in accordance with the Management and Accountability System . In addition, the RC ensures that the interests of non-resident agencies are adequately represented, especially when s/he is leading the UNCT in developing their corresponding United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF). The RC is accredited by letter of the Secretary-General, usually to the Head of State or Government. The RC acts on behalf of the UNS in an impartial way, strategically positioning the UN in each country. S/he leads and coordinates all operational activities for development in the country in support of national priorities and capacity-building in the context of internationally agreed treaty obligations and development goals, including the MDGs, and places the UN centrally in development and international cooperation in the country. All representatives of UNS organisations at the country level report to the RC on matters related to the working of the UNCT and implementation of the jointly agreed UNCT work programme derived from the UNDAF and/or the equivalent post-crisis development plan. The RC is accountable to the UNS at the global level, with inputs from the regional directors teams and designated managers from headquarters ‚Äì including to the RC‚Äôs performance appraisal ‚Äì through the UNDG Chair, to the CEB. The RC is also accountable for ensuring that the UNCT are kept fully informed on interactions s/he has on behalf of the UNS with the Government, donor community and other development partners. While the primary responsibility for coordinating humanitarian assistance rests with national authorities, the RCS is responsible for supporting national efforts. If international humanitarian assistance is required and a separate Humanitarian Coordinator (HC) position is not established, the RC is accountable to the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator (ERC) for the strategic and operational coordination of the response efforts of UNCT member agencies and relevant humanitarian actors (national and international humanitarian organisations, bilateral actors), in support of national efforts. The UN ERC may choose to designate the RC as HC, in consultation with the Inter-Agency Standing Committee, if the situation so requires. If a Special Representative of the Secretary-General is appointed, the RC/HC will normally function as Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General under his/her overall authority, with responsibility for the coordination of development and humanitarian assistance, including early and longer-term recovery, in the context of RC/UNCT consultative arrangements (as per the SG Guidance Note on Integration). In locations where there is no resident SRSG or Special Envoy, and in the event of a significant deterioration or evolution of the political situation in the country, the RC liaises with the Department of Political Affairs for support. The RC will normally be appointed as the Designated Official (DO) for UN Security by the SG, unless the SG appoints a more senior UN official who is resident in the country, on the advice of UN Department of Safety and Security (DSS). In implementing this function the RC/DO reports to the Secretary-General through the Under-Secretary-General of DSS. In locations where the UN Department of Public Information (DPI) has a UN Information Centre (UNIC) but no DPI Director, the RC will usually assume the functions of the Director of the Centre, in accordance with DPI terms of reference for RCs serving as UNIC Directors. This RC job description is derived from the UNDG terms of reference for the RC, the UNDG guidance note on RC and UNCT working relations, the UNDG dispute resolution mechanism for UNCTs, and the ‚ÄòManagement and Accountability System of the UN development and RC System, including the ‚Äúfunctional firewall‚Äù for the RC System‚Äô (and its corresponding implementation plan) - which all provide guidance and appropriate information. This job description acknowledges and incorporates where possible the best practices and experiences emerging from the Delivering as One pilot countries, in which local arrangements for the role of the RC may apply. It is envisaged that over time lessons will be drawn upon and incorporated into this job description from mutually agreed mechanisms (for example, the recent General Assembly Resolution A/RES/62/277 ‚ÄòSystem-wide coherence‚Äô).

His name has been said to have occurred for the first time in a papal letter datable to 25 November 1390,Dowden, Bishops, p. 366; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 363; letter can be found at Burns (ed.), Papal Letters, p. 158. but this letter is simply a repetition of another addressed to him, dated 2 August that year; both letters address him as the rector of the parish church of Kirkmahoe, and authorise him to take up the position of provost of the Collegiate Church of Lincluden providing he resigned Kirkmahoe within a period of two years.Burns (ed.), Papal Letters, p. 153. This Collegiate Church, previously a Benedictine nunnery, was erected only on 7 May 1389, after a petition of Archibald Douglas (\\"the Grim\\"), Lord of Galloway, to Avignon Pope Clement VII.Burns (ed.), Papal Letters, p. 145; Dowden, Bishops, pp. 366-7; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 363. Papal authorisation came in a letter to the Bishop of Glasgow, inside whose diocese Lincluden lay, which stated: > ...as is contained in the petition of Archibald, Lord of Galloway, his > predecessors founded and built the monastery of Lincluden, O. CLUN., ... and > endowed it for the maintenance of eight or nine nuns, to be ruled by a > prioress, while right of patronage remained with the lords of Galloway > ...Burns (ed.), Papal Letters, p. 145. The letter goes into the details of the monastery's problems and decline, details provided to the papacy by the Lord of Galloway, and asks Bishop Walter Wardlaw: > to ascertain that these facts be true and having transferred the nuns to a > house of the Cluniac or Benedictine order, to erect the collegiate church > and hospice ... He still held both Lincluden and Kirkmahoe on 17 May 1391, when the Pope wrote to him providing him to a canonry and prebend of Glasgow Cathedral.Burns (ed.), Papal Letters, p. 161. Elisaeus retained his position as provost of Lincluden until 1406. In that year he was elected and received papal provision to the vacant diocese of Galloway.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, pp. 131, 363. This election was ascribed by historian Michael Brown to the influence of the Lord of Galloway, now Archibald Douglas II.Brown, Black Douglases, p. 195. In a lost MacDowall charter, witnessed by Robert Keith and datable to 1412, he was said to have been in his seventh year of consecration.Dowden, Bishops, p. 367; Keith, Historical Catalogue, p. 274; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 131. Nothing more is known about Elisaeus's career as Bishop of Galloway; the time of his death is not known either, but he died sometime before 14 June 1415, when there occurs the earliest evidence that a successor for Galloway was needed.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 131.

A left-handed pitcher, he spent all or parts of 13 seasons (1960‚Äì72) in Major League Baseball as a member of the Pittsburgh Pirates, San Francisco Giants, Cincinnati Reds and Houston Astros. Gibbon was born in Hickory, Mississippi; he was listed as tall and . Career in sports  An alumnus of the University of Mississippi, where he was a standout in both baseball and basketball, Gibbon signed with the Pirates in 1957. In 1959, his third minor league season, he won 16 of 25 decisions for the Triple-A Columbus Jets, posted a strong 3.22 earned run average, and hurled 11 complete games and four shutouts in 28 starting pitcher assignments. He led the International League in strikeouts with 152. His performance helped Gibbon win a spot on the roster of the 1960 Pirates, for whom he pitched in 27 games (including nine starts). He was the winning pitcher in his first two big- league games (as a relief pitcher) and during the year posted a 4‚Äì2 record for a Pirate team that captured the 1960 National League pennant by seven games. In the 1960 World Series, Gibbon worked in Games 2 and 3 (both lopsided losses to the New York Yankees) and surrendered three earned runs (on a three-run home run by Mickey Mantle in Game 2) in three full innings pitched. However, the Pirates won the Series in seven games, on Bill Mazeroski's famous walk-off Game 7 home run. Apart from three games pitched for the 1962 Kinston Eagles of the Class B Carolina League, Gibbon spent the remainder of his pro career in the big leagues. In his sophomore season, 1961 with Pittsburgh, he set personal bests in wins (13), games started (29), complete games (seven), shutouts (three), strikeouts (145) and innings pitched (195). As his career progressed (and especially after his December 1965 trade to the Giants), Gibbon became more of a relief specialist. He started his last game on August 29, 1967, hurling a complete-game, three-hit 11‚Äì1 triumph for the Giants over the Los Angeles Dodgers. When he returned to the Pirates in June 1969, he pitched out of the Pittsburgh bullpen through 1970, appearing in two games of the 1970 National League Championship Series against Cincinnati and working a total of one-third of an inning. Released at the end of October, Gibbon joined the Reds in 1971 and enjoyed one more season of effective relief work, posting a 2.94 ERA and tying his career-best mark for saves with 11. During his MLB career, Gibbon compiled a 61‚Äì65 record with a 3.52 earned run average and 743 strikeouts in 1,119 innings pitched; he allowed 1,053 hits and 414 bases on balls. He made 419 total appearances, 127 as a starting pitcher, and logged 20 complete games, four shutouts and 32 career saves. Gibbon had good speed as a base runner and was frequently called upon as a pinch runner by the Pirates after Joe Christopher departed for the expansion New York Mets in 1962. Death and legacy Gibbon died on February 20, 2019, at his home south of Newton, Mississippi after a short illness. References External links *Thomas Van Hyning, Joe Gibbon.

MacDonald (November 23, 1922 - December 4, 1990) was a former Deputy Chief Historian for the United States Army. He wrote several of the Army's official histories of World War II.  War service  After graduating from Presbyterian College, MacDonald was commissioned as a US Army officer through ROTC and deployed to Europe. By September 1944, as a 21-year-old captain, he commanded a rifle company in the 23rd Infantry Regiment. His company was intended to be part of the effort to capture the Huertgen Forest. They had been transferred north from the area which was, soon after, overrun by the Germans in the first moves of the Battle of the Bulge. They were redeployed to defend a crossroads against the German advance. After delaying the Germans long enough to allow the rest of MacDonald's division to deploy, they withdrew. He received the Silver Star for the action. While leading his company in a counterattack, MacDonald was wounded on January 17, 1945. After two months' convalescence, he was given command of another company in his old regiment, which he led until the end of the war. He also received the Purple Heart.  Historian  His first book, Company Commander, was published in 1947, while his wartime experiences were fresh in his mind. Charles B. MacDonald was the author of The Siegfried Line Campaign and co-author of Three Battles: Arnaville, Altuzzo, and Schmidt, both in the official series United States Army in World War II. He supervised the preparation of other volumes in the European and Mediterranean theater military history subseries and contributed to Command Decisions and American Military History. He authored Company Commander (Washington: 1947), The Battle of the Huertgen Forest (Philadelphia: 1963), The Mighty Endeavor (New York: 1969), and Airborne (New York: 1970). In 1957 he received a Secretary of the Army Research and Study Fellowship and spent a year studying the interrelationship of terrain, weapons, and tactics on European battlefields. He wrote the final volume of the Green Series on the European Theatre, The Last Offensive. He retired as Deputy Chief Historian, United States Army Center of Military History in 1979. After his retirement, MacDonald wrote A Time for Trumpets, his last book, a personal history of the Ardennes Offensive which concentrates on the first two weeks of the battle, which he spent five years researching. MacDonald became ill with cancer and lung disease, and died on December 4, 1990 at his home in Arlington, Virginia, at the age of 68.

It‚Äôs a beautiful turn by Hatch in the classic biopic form: confidence, talent, and drive lead to success, but the ego needed to climb to the top proves to be an Achilles heel, leading to abuse of friends, loved ones, and self, and then to the inexorable downfall, before a painful but enlightening personal redemption.\\"https://drunktv.net/2017/06/18/deadmans-curve-the-story-of-jan- and-dean-a-true-rock-tragedy/ Ratings The movie was the 40th highest rating show of the week.Boxful of Ratings for ABC Anniversary Present Los Angeles Times 8 Feb 1978: f7.

The left-handed pitcher appeared in 88 games in Major League Baseball, all but one in relief, over all or parts of five seasons (1959‚Äì62; 1964) for the Pittsburgh Pirates and Washington Senators. A native and longtime resident of the Titusville section of Hopewell Township, Mercer County, New Jersey, he was listed as tall and . His son Gary was a shortstop for three MLB teams between 1986 and 1992, and is a former longtime minor league manager. Fred Green signed with the Pirates in 1952 and advanced through their farm system, missing 1957 to perform military service in the United States Army. After beginning for the Pirate varsity, then making one appearance in July, Pittsburgh called him up from Triple-A Columbus in August 1959 for an extended stay in the majors. He was largely effective in 13 late- season relief assignments, and made his only MLB start on September 11 against the eventual 1959 world champion Los Angeles Dodgers, dropping a 4‚Äì0 decision at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.Retrosheet box score: 1959-09-11 (2) The following season, , saw Green spend the entire campaign on the Pirates' big- league roster and set career bests in games pitched (45), innings pitched (70), wins (eight), winning percentage (.667), and saves (three), as Pittsburgh won the National League pennant. He also posted a strong 3.21 earned run average. But he was treated harshly by the New York Yankees in the 1960 World Series. In three appearances, all lopsided Pirate losses, Green surrendered 11 hits and ten earned runs in only four full innings of work‚Äîan ERA of 22.50. Two of the hits he allowed were home runs to Mickey Mantle. Nonetheless, Pittsburgh won the remaining four games by tight margins to become world champions. When Green's struggles continued in , he was sent back to Columbus for part of the season, then released on waivers to the Washington Senators. The 1962 Senators used him in five games, then sent him to the minor leagues, where the following season he ended up back in the Pirate organization. In , Pittsburgh recalled Green from Triple-A in midyear and he was effective in eight relief assignments, allowing only one run in 7 innings pitched for a 1.23 earned run average. But he was sent back to Columbus after June 14 and finished his professional career there in 1965. As a major leaguer, he compiled a 9‚Äì7 record and four saves, with a 3.48 earned run average and 77 strikeouts in 142 innings pitched. He allowed 142 hits and 63 bases on balls. As a hitter, Green batted .176 (3-for-17) but 2 of his major league hits were home runs, both hit during the 1960 season.

MP3+G was created from the combination of the MP3 audio file (the CD audio is converted and compressed to MP3) and a raw CDG file which contains the RW subchannels from the CD+G track.  History  MP3+G was first called MM+G in combination of various audio formats synchronized to a CDG file. MP3 and WMA became the most popular audio format used for karaoke and therefore MP3+G and WMA+G became the most popular formats used. Microsoft first unofficially adopted the WMA+G for use on the Xbox for the Xbox karaoke product. MP3+G was named in 1998 as the media format for WinCDG which was the first MP3+G player. The technology was intended as the new standard for PC karaoke without the need for a disc. Other products have found a new way to transport the MP3+G pair of files by \\"zipping\\" them. A zip file is a data compression format used to compress and contain files together. Containing the MP3+G file pair in the ZIP became known as an \\"MP3+G Zipped\\". Since the creation of the format the technology of MP3+G was first licensed as the Breeze engine by Tricerasoft. It was later released as a codec engine technology to various computer software companies, including TouchPoint, PCDJ, DJPower, Alcatech, Hercules, and AVA Systems.  Design  MP3+G is derived from the CD+G format and the CD+G disc format invented by Philips. MP3+G is created by extracting the CD-Audio packets from the CD+G disc with a CD-ROM that is capable of also extracting the RW channels from the disc. The digital audio portion is compressed to MP3 and the RW Channels (CD+G graphics) are stored to a CDG file. The player products read each file and synchronize the information to display the interpreted graphics along with the music.

Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford: Oxford University Press, May 2010) accessed 1 July 2010. Life and works Evans was born Peggy Whistler in Uxbridge, Middlesex, the daughter of Godfrey James Whistler (1866-1936), an insurance clerk. Her affection for the Herefordshire countryside grew from visits she began to pay in 1918 to an aunt in Ross-on-Wye. The family moved to nearby Bridstow in 1921. She was educated in Ross and at Hereford School of Art. She took her pen name from her father's mother, whose name was Evans. Her two most famous works are Country Dance (1932) and her Autobiography (1943, 2nd e., 1952). Country Dance (serialized on BBC radio in 2006) was followed by three further novels, The Wooden Doctor (1933), Turf or Stone (1934), and Creed (1936), all set in the countryside of the Welsh Marches. Some of her books were self-illustrated. Whistler married a Welshman, George Michael Mendus Williams, on 28 October 1940, and they went to live on a farm at Llangarron, near Ross, where her husband worked. There a fifth novel was abandoned in favour of her autobiography. She also published Poems from Obscurity (1947) and a volume of stories, The Old and the Young (1948), written while her husband was serving in the army. They moved in 1950 to Elkstone near Gloucester, where her husband was training to be a teacher. Her discovery that she was epileptic led to another autobiographical account, A Ray of Darkness (1952). The couple moved in 1953 with their daughter Cassandra (born 1951) to Hartfield in Sussex, where her husband began teaching. However, Evans's health declined and she suffered from homesickness for the Welsh marches. The Nightingale Silenced (1954) is a moving account of her life after she was diagnosed with a brain tumour. A second volume of poetry, A Candle Ahead (1956), won a prize from the Welsh committee of the Arts Council a few weeks before she died on 17 March 1958 in Tunbridge Wells, Kent. Interest in Margiad Evans' work has revived, especially in Wales. There were new editions of The Old and the Young in 1998, of Country Dance and The Wooden Doctor in 2005, and of Turf or Stone in 2010.

The method is named after Paul Job and is also used in instrumental analysis and advanced chemical equilibrium texts and research articles. Job first published his method in 1928, while studying the associations of ions in solution. By plotting the UV absorbance of a solution of against the mole fraction of , he produced a graph which provided information about the equilibrium complexes present in solution.  Theory  A simple Job Plot showing how a physical property (P) changes upon changing the mole fraction of compound A (ŒßA). In solutions where two species are present (i.e. species A and species B), one species (A) may bind to the other species (B). In some cases, more than one A will bind with a single B. One way to determine the amount of A binding to B is by using a Job plot. In this method, the sum of the molar concentrations of the two binding partners (e.g. a protein and ligand or a metal and a ligand) is held constant, but their mole fractions are varied. An observable that is proportional to complex formation (such as absorption signal or enzymatic activity) is plotted against the mole fractions of these two components. œáA is the mole fraction of compound A and P is the physical property being measured to understand complex formation. This property is most oftentimes UV absorbance. The maximum (or minimum) on the plot corresponds to the stoichiometry of the two species if sufficiently high concentrations are used. The plot also provides insight to understand the equilibrium constant (Keq) of complex formation. A greater curvature leads to a more evenly distributed equilibrium, while a more triangle-shaped plot signifies a large Keq. Further, after determining the equilibrium constant, we can determine what complexes (ratio of A and B) are present in solution. In addition, the peak of the Job Plot corresponds to the mole fraction of ligands bound to a molecule, which is important for studying ligand field theory. An early work of I. Ostromisslensky describes essentially this approach.  Requirements  There are several conditions that must be met in order for Job's method to be applicable. Firstly, the property being studied must vary in direct proportion to the concentration of the species. In the case of UV- visible spectroscopy, for example, this means that the system must conform to the Beer-Lambert law. In addition, the total concentration of the two binding partners, the pH and ionic strength of the solution must all be maintained at fixed values throughout the experiment. Finally, there must only be only one complex in solution which predominates over all others under the conditions of the experiment. This requirement means that only systems with high association constants, or systems in which only one stoichiometry can form, are suitable for analysis by Job plot. As such, the use of the Job plot in supramolecular chemistry has been advised against.

The sources of water which produce floods include: * Groundwater (saturated groundwater) * Vadose (water flowing the ground in an unsaturated state) * Surface water * Artificial water (burst water mains, canals or reservoirs) * Rivers, streams or watercourses * Sewers and drains *Flooding of low-lying coastal regions due to sea level rise For each of the sources of water, different hydraulic intensities occur. Floods can occur because of a combination of sources of flooding, such as high groundwater and an inadequate surface water drainage system. The topography, hydrogeology and physical attributes of the existing or proposed development need to be considered. A flood risk assessment should be an evaluation of the flood risk and the consequences and impact and vulnerability. Non-professional flood risk assessments can be produced by members of the public, Architects, environment assessors, or others who are not specifically professionally qualified in this field. However, it is a complex evaluation and such assessments they can be rejected by Authorities as inadequate, or could be considered as negligent in the event of a flooding event, damage and a claim to insurers being made. In the UK, the writing of professional flood risk assessments is undertaken by Civil Engineering Consultants. They will have membership of the Institution of Civil Engineers and are bound by their rules of professional conduct. A key requirement is to ensure such professional flood risk assessments are independent to all parties by carrying out their professional duties with complete objectivity and impartiality. Their professional advice should be supported by professional indemnity insurance for such specific professional advice ultimately held with a Lloyd's of London underwriter. Professional flood risk assessments can cover single buildings, or whole regions. They can part of a due-diligence process for existing householders or businesses, or can be required in England and Wales to provide independent evidence to a planning application on the flood risk. England and Wales In England and Wales, the Environment Agency requires a professional Flood Risk Assessment (FRA) to be submitted alongside planning applications in areas that are known to be at risk of flooding (within flood zones 2 or 3) and/ or are greater than 1ha in area, planning permission is not usually granted until the FRA has been accepted by the Environment Agency. PPS 25 ‚Äì England only Flood Risk Assessments are required to be completed according to the National Planning Policy Framework,National Planning Policy Framework (https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/6077/2116950.pdf) \\"National Planning Policy Framework\\" which replaces Planning Policy Statement PPS 25: Development and Flood Risk. The initial legislation (PPG25) was introduced in 2001 and subsequently revised.HMSO (2006, Revised 2010) Planning Policy Statement 25: Development and Flood Risk , TSO, London. PPS 25 was designed to \\"strengthen and clarify the key role of the planning system in managing flood risk and contributing to adapting to the impacts of climate change.\\"Angela Smith MP (7 December 2006) Planning Policy Statement (PPS) 25: Flooding, Written Parliamentary Statement and sets out policies for local authorities to ensure flood risk is taken into account during the planning process to prevent inappropriate development in high risk areas and to direct development away from areas at highest risk. In its introduction, PPS25 states \\"flooding threatens life and causes substantial damage to property [and that] although [it] cannot be wholly prevented, its impacts can be avoided and reduced through good planning and management\\".Communities and Local Government (2006) Planning Policy Statement 25: Development and Flood Risk: Full Regulatory Impact Assessment Composition of an FRA For a flood risk assessment to be written, information is needed concerning the existing and proposed developments, the Environment Agency modeled flood levels and topographic levels on site. At its most simple (and cheapest) level an FRA can provide an indication of whether a development will be allowed to take place at a site. An initial idea of the risk of fluvial flooding to a local area can be found on the Environment Agency flood map website. FRAs consist of a detailed analysis of available data to inform the Environment Agency of flood risk at an individual site and also recommend to the developer any mitigation measures. More costly analysis of flood risk can be achieved through detailed flood modelling to challenge the agency's modelled levels and corresponding flood zones. The FRA takes into account the risk and impact of flooding on the site, and takes into consideration how the development may affect flooding in the local area. It also includes provides recommendations as to how the risk of flooding to the development can be mitigated. FRAs should also consider flooding from all sources including fluvial, groundwater, surface water runoff and sewer flooding. Northern Ireland In 2006, the Planning Service, part of The Department of the Environment, published Planning Policy Statement 15 (PPS15): Planning and flood risk.Department of the Environment (2006) Planning Policy Statement 15 (PPS 15): Planning and Flood Risk, The Planning Service, Belfast The guidelines are precautionary and advise against development in flood plains and areas subject to historical flooding. In exceptional cases a FRA can be completed to justify development in flood risk areas. Advice on flood risk assessment is provided to the Planning Service by the Rivers Agency, which is the statutory drainage and flood defence authority for Northern Ireland. Republic of Ireland In 2009, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Office of Public Works published planning guidelines requiring local authorities to apply a sequential approach to flood risk management.Government of Ireland (2009) The Planning System and Flood Risk Management, The Stationery Office, Dublin The guidelines require that proposed development in flood risk areas must undergo a justification test, consisting of a flood risk assessment.

The route has two connecting segments, extending nearly the entire length of the nation's eastern margin. The northern section of the route features historic New England coastal villages and towns, rural countrysides, and Amish farmlands. The route's southern section begins after the Mason‚ÄìDixon Line (the boundary between Pennsylvania and Maryland) and is notable for the Civil War battlefields in Fredericksburg, Virginia, and the city of Richmond, Virginia. The northern section of the route can be ridden between late spring and late fall, and the southern section can be ridden year-round. Northern section The route begins in Bar Harbor, Maine, on Mount Desert Island, and proceeds through Acadia National Park. After crossing the Penobscot River, there is a side trip to well-preserved, nineteenth century Fort Knox. The route occasionally follows back roads situated near the Maine coast, but only a small portion of the route is along the Atlantic coastline. The route continues through charming, picturesque New England towns of New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Connecticut with an optional detour into Boston. Riders pass through scenic farmland as they bike through New York along the historic Hudson River. The route through New Jersey follows the Delaware River and picturesque Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area. An optional spur extends eastward to New York City from Lambertville. The route heads west into Pennsylvania through hilly farmland. A bike trail along the Schuylkill River provides an optional spur to downtown Philadelphia. After riding through Valley Forge National Historic Park, riders enter Amish country. The route swings south into Maryland though the western outskirts of Baltimore with an alternate route through the city. Northern Maryland farmland transitions into the suburban sprawl of the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area. Bike paths through Rock Creek Park take riders to the Lincoln Memorial and the Potomac River. After crossing the Potomac, there is another bike path to Mount Vernon, George Washington's residence from 1754 until his death in 1799. There are more urban areas in expanding northern Virginia, some quiet country roads, and an increase in urbanization on the approach to Richmond, Virginia. Terrain The route consists of many hilly areas with steep grades, including northwestern Connecticut, the Susquehanna River area in Pennsylvania, and the country roads north of Richmond. Cycling enthusiasts have identified areas, such as along the Potomac River in Virginia, as flatter compared to other regions. Logistics Services are generally plentiful along the route. People who like to camp won't find any campgrounds in Maryland, unless they take the alternate route through Baltimore. Some cyclists may want to do the northern portions of this route during the colors of autumn. If so, call ahead to verify campground availability, as many close after Labor Day. If staying indoors, make advance reservations. Southern section This segment provides the opportunity to bike through the Deep South and travel through back-road farmlands and swamps and near Baptist churches. The route leaving Richmond heads south through the farmlands of Virginia and encounters swamps while crossing into North Carolina. On an Outer Banks alternate route, riders bike along the sandy beaches of the Atlantic Ocean. The winds can be strong and sand may blow onto the road. The winds are thought to have encouraged the Wright Brothers to fly their first plane here. Riders may see tools utilized by the famous Wright brothers in their bicycle shop. The Outer Banks alternate route requires two ferry rides, one of which is 2.25 hours long. Heading southward, the route passes through the busy city of Wilmington, North Carolina, and takes another ferry ride into Southport, North Carolina. Next come farmlands, swamps and the Francis Marion National Forest. There is an optional spur into historic Charleston, South Carolina. There are more farms and swamps in Georgia. Another optional spur takes riders into Savannah, Georgia, with one of the largest national historic landmark districts in the United States. Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge is four miles off route. It is one of the largest and most primitive swamps remaining in the United States. Riders can see numerous alligators of all sizes, stroll on boardwalks over the marshes, or take a boat ride through the swamp. Heading south, the route skirts around the northeast corner of Jacksonville, Florida, into highly developed areas of Florida popular with tourists and retirees. It then turns into beach riding along the Atlantic Ocean to the distinctive Spanish architecture of St. Augustine, the oldest European settlement in the United States. From St. Augustine, the route alternates between urban and suburban conditions most of the way down the coast through Miami. Cyclists who don't wish to reverse their route back across the Keys may take a ferry from Key West to Fort Myers Beach, and return to Fort Lauderdale via the Florida Connector Bicycle Route. Terrain While there is some hill climbing upon leaving Richmond, Virginia, generally the terrain is either rolling or flat. Logistics This route can be ridden year-round; however, the northern part can be quite cool in the winter. Expect high temperatures and humid conditions in the summer, though beach riding will be tempered by ocean breezes. Changing local conditions make it difficult to predict any major wind patterns. Hurricanes can occur from July through November along the Atlantic Seaboard and can close roads along the Outer Banks alternate route. Space is limited on the ferries, so when making reservations, riders need to let them know in advance that they have a bike. Services are readily available throughout most of the ride, although camping opportunities can be scarce in the suburban and residential areas of Florida. Camping on the Outer Banks can be blustery at night. There are no bike shops between Southport, North Carolina, and Statesboro, Georgia, unless taking the spur into Charleston, South Carolina. Almost everything available for purchase, including food, will be more expensive due to the tourist nature of the beach communities In Florida. Reservations for camping and hotel accommodations are highly recommended year-round. Riders wishing to stay at one of the Bahia Honda State Park campsites should make reservations early. Riders can take advantage of the opportunities to enjoy the numerous beach accesses. County parks often include amenities, such as picnic tables, cold water, showers, and toilets, which are inexpensive or free to cyclists. State Highway A1A changes names many times on its journey along the coast. This is especially true as it nears Miami. Often it is located adjacent to an aquatic preserve or wildlife refuge that offers bird watching. Florida has an extensive, though sometimes confusing, network of bicycling facilities ranging from two-foot bike lanes or shoulders to separated bike paths and sidewalks. For some stretches it may be better to use the sidewalk rather than the road, but in highly trafficked beach areas the sidewalks will be for pedestrian use only. Approaches to nearly invisible short bridges are usually marked with \\"frogs\\", \\"buttons\\", \\"turtles\\", \\"slugs\\", or rumble strips. Campgrounds are almost nonexistent from Jupiter until south of Miami. After Florida City, there is a ride with no services, potentially heavy traffic, and abundant alligators. Gators should always be given a wide berth, and riders must be ready to sprint if necessary. Alligators can reach speeds of 35 miles per hour for very short distances. On the way to Key West, the roadways have generous shoulders, though the bike paths are recommended. Riders should take plenty of time to enjoy this section and have a camera ready. Multiple occasions to stop and take in the scenery are present when crossing the many old bridges. Information centers containing local knowledge of available activities are offered at each of the Keys.

Biography Born in Rhode Island's capital city, Providence, Roberts graduated La Salle Academy in 1923. He was a graduate of Fordham University in 1927 and Boston University Law School in 1930, following which he practiced law in Providence. His political career began in 1935 when he was elected to the State Senate, where he served until 1939. He became chairman of the State Democratic Party in 1938. He was a delegate to the 1936, 1940, 1948 and 1960 Democratic National Conventions (first time as an alternate delegate). Roberts was elected Mayor of Providence in 1940, and served until 1951, except when he served in the United States Navy during World War II. He rose to rank of lieutenant commander. He is mentioned by title in Arthur Miller's 1949 play Death of a Salesman, as the Mayor of Providence. Governor He was elected Governor of Rhode Island in 1950 and was re-elected three times, serving four two-year terms, holding the office from January 2, 1951 to January 6, 1959. While governor, he established a Department of Administration as a housekeeping agency for finance and other problems, as well as a Development Council to promote economic development in Rhode Island. He also reorganized the Department of Social Welfare to improve its administration. During the 1956 Gubernatorial election he lost in plurality votes to Republican Christopher Del Sesto, but the Rhode Island Supreme Court invalidated 5,000 civilian absentee and shut-in ballots cast prior to election day on the ground that a constitutional amendment required such votes to be cast on, rather than prior to, election day. This left Roberts the winner. He was defeated by Del Sesto two years later. In 1960, former Governor Roberts sought the Democratic nomination for a U.S. Senate seat but was defeated by Claiborne Pell, who won and served in the Senate until 1997. He later went on to chair the Rhode Island Constitutional Convention, where he recommended a unicameral state legislature. Roberts died while in surgery for a ruptured aneurysm in Rhode Island Hospital in Providence. He was a Catholic.

General information The Thomas- Institut was founded in 1950 by Josef Koch, then Professor for medieval philosophy at the University of Cologne. Forming part of the Faculty of Humanities and, more particularly, the Philosophy Department, the Thomas- Institut is a research Institute whose function it is to serve the study of medieval philosophy by preparing critical editions and historical and systematic studies of medieval authors. The director of the Institute is the professor holding the chair in medieval philosophy at the university. Since communicating the results of this work is an essential part of the task of the Institute, the staff gives various courses in medieval philosophy at the University of Cologne. Jointly with twenty other departments - from History and Philology to Byzantine, Jewish and Islamic Studies - the Thomas-Institute organizes an extensive programme for medieval studies, the Zentrum f√ºr Mittelalterstudien (ZfMs). Since its beginnings the Thomas-Institut has attached importance to international cooperation and exchange, and many of the projects pursued at the Thomas-Institut are international collaborations. The Mediaevistentagung, taking place every two years, has become one of the foremost conferences on medieval studies in Europe, furthering international and interdisciplinary research. The proceedings are published in the Miscellanea Mediaevalia series, edited by the Institute and published by de Gruyter. In addition to its own projects the Thomas-Institut sponsors several ongoing editions which are funded and organized by other institutions. The most important at present are the Averroes Latinus project of the International Union of Academies, funded by the Nordrhein-Westf√§ische Akademie der Wissenschaften, and the critical edition of the works of Nicolaus Cusanus with the Heidelberger Akademie der Wissenschaften. The Thomas-Institut likewise participates in the Aristoteles Latinus project organized by the International Union of Academies, it hosts the Meister Eckhart Archiv and has recently started the critical edition of Durandus of St. Pour√ßain. Since its beginnings the Thomas-Institut has edited the Studien und Texte zur Geistesgeschichte des Mittelalters (STGMA) published by Brill, one of the most renowned series in medieval philosophy and medieval studies. In 1997, together with the De Wulf-Mansion Centre in Leuven, the Thomas-Institut took over the journal Recherches de Th√©ologie et Philosophie m√©di√©vales. For further information about the publications of the Thomas-Institut, see  Research   Main areas of expertise  * Conditions of Scientific Discourse in Medieval Arabic, Hebrew, Byzantine and Latin Culture Scientific discourse in the Middle Ages has its common ground in the reception of Greek learning from late Antiquity. It is diversified, however, according to the sociological and institutional as well as religious and theological framework in which Greek science is integrated. Besides that, the processes of rationalisation taking place in various fields of knowledge exercise a considerable influence. Key- words like \\"Reception of Dionysius\\", \\"Reception of Aristotle\\", and \\"Averroism\\" refer us to a complex structure of medieval bodies of knowledge. This structure has to be understood as the result of far-reaching processes of reception and transformation, transmission and translation. Inquiries in this area demand a combination of philosophical, philological, and historiographical competences. Research at the Thomas-Institut focuses on the contexts of transmission, on the attempts to define the meaning of \\"philosophy\\" (for example in the relationship of \\"Philosophy and Wisdom\\"), and on the formation of epistemological and institutional canons. * Intellect, Mind and Soul: Concepts, Stratifications and Boundaries. A Critical Evaluation of the Medieval Debates The debate on intellect, mind and soul is currently one of those philosophical topics generating the most innovative questions. Medieval philosophy is of central importance in this respect, since it furnishes a rich tradition of investigation in this area. The problem was dealt with in all the medieval philosophical and theological cultures and languages. While differences abounded in every milieu, some solutions were adopted across boundaries. The medieval contribution is interesting from the point of view of the history of ideas, but the reception of traditions from Antiquity also engendered new theories. The confrontation of these theories in epistemological debates from the 13th century to the Renaissance lead to the development of new models. One may think for instance of \\"augustinisme avicennisant\\", the Averroistic theory of intellect, and the combination of Aristotelian and pseudo-Dionysian noetics. When one examines the modern debate on the background just sketched, it becomes clear that medieval philosophy provides models and perspectives both richer in arguments and truly interdisciplinary. This topic has already been made the object of research by an international network of institutions working on medieval philosophy (the EGSAMP members Leuven, Amsterdam, Pisa, Lecce, Bari, Sofia) in which the Thomas-Institut participates.  Ongoing research projects  * The Relationship between Philosophy and Wisdom ** Philosophy and Wisdom in the Middle Ages A Contribution to the Development of the Western Concept of Philosophy Behind the terminological opposition of philosophy and wisdom, into whose reasons this project enquires, emerges another problem: the origin of philosophy. Thus the medieval debate is representative of a basic discourse, which always anew attempts to determine the essence of philosophy. The Middle Ages, and especially the 13th century are of prime importance for the reconstruction of the affaire de c≈ìur of philosophy and wisdom. In the second half of this century the reception of an Aristotelian idea of philosophical wisdom sparks a major controversy about the identity of philosophy, a controversy that presages many of the questions asked in the modern era. The results which have been reached in a number of case-studies will be assembled and assessed in context. ** \\"Rhizomatics\\": the Art of Living and Wisdom as Bridges for a Transcultural Philosophy In this project \\"rhizomatics\\" and nomadism as developed by the French philosophers Gilles Deleuze and F√©lix Guattari are employed to address transcultural issues. At the heart of this project are the concept of philosophy, its relation to wisdom, methodology and ethics and possible forms and constructions of philosophy. Besides the French and German Literature on Deleuze the project will take into account the reception and resonance of his ideas in Spanish-American thought. ** New Perspectives in the Historiography of Medieval Philosophy What is medieval philosophy? This question has been answered in a variety of ways even before Gilson's influential attempts to give a definitive reply. Such answers are always bound up with a certain idea of philosophy and its resulting mechanisms of inclusion and exclusion. But if one takes into account the dynamics proper to different cultural frameworks which transferred the philosophical inheritance from late Antiquity into modernity, one must try to describe its interactions more closely, disregarding the classical narratives of medieval philosophy. In order to realise this, new methodological approaches will be attempted. This project forms part of the InterLink-project (Bari-K√∂ln-Sofia- Leuven-Paris) \\"Soggetto e statuto della filosofia nel Medioevo. Nuove prospettive di ricerca nell'edizione critica dei testi e nelle metodologie di indagine storiografica\\". * Thomas Aquinas in Philosophical Context ** Thomas Aquinas, In librum Beati Dionysii De divinis nominibus expositione, Book IV, Lectiones 1-10 Thomas Aquinas's commentary on Dionysius is an exemplary case for the study of the encounter of the Latin and the Byzantine Middle Ages. Of special interest are Thomas's first ten \\"Lectiones\\" on the fourth book of his model. Here, central themes of Neoplatonism are treated: the Good, light, beauty, and love. A translation and commentary on the basis of a revised Latin text is in preparation. ** Edith Stein's Translations of Aquinas's Works De veritate and De ente et essentia Edith Stein's translations of Aquinas are not only an important document for the intellectual development of Husserl's former assistant but also show in an exemplary case the encounter of Neoscholasticism and modern philosophy at the beginning of the 20th century. In the framework of the new edition of the works of Edith Stein her translation of the Quaestiones disputatae de veritate and her yet unpublished translation of De ente et essential will be edited alongside a number of further \\"Thomistica\\" (ESGA 24). ** Thomas Aquinas, Quaestio disputata \\"De libero arbitrio\\" (De malo VI) This text is a key to understanding Aquinas's teaching on free choice as foundation of truly human, that is to say responsible and autonomous action. A German translation of this text on the basis of the Editio Leonina is currently in preparation and will be published, together with an extensive introduction, by Reclam. * The Medieval Theory of Transcendentals The project is dedicated to the historical development of the theory of transcendentals from its formation in the thirteenth century (Philip the Chancellor) up to its treatment in the Disputationes metaphysicae by Francesco Su√°rez. It likewise deals with the significance of the theory of transcendentals for medieval philosophy in general. * The \\"Super\\"-Transcendental and the Splitting of Metaphysics In search of the origins and motives of the splitting of metaphysics in the 17th and 18th century into a metaphysica generalis and metaphysica specialis, conceived for the first time by Francis of Marchia at the beginning of the 14th century, this project enquires into the relationship between the first object of the human intellect and the proper object of metaphysics as they present themselves in conceptions of metaphysics after the time of Duns Scotus. Especially the attempt to define the primum obiectum intellectus as \\"super- transcendental\\" has a constitutive function for the legitimating of a twofold metaphysics. * Radicalisation in lieu of Abolition of the Science of Being. On the Development of First Philosophy from the Late Middle Ages to the 18th Century According to the account of the development of first philosophy predominant today, this discipline underwent a transformation since the late Middle Ages, in the course of which the Aristotelian theory of being was dissolved and reformed as an onto-logic of that which can be thought, thus immediately preparing Kant's transcendental philosophy. This interpretation needs to be revised in order to show that the said transformation did not exceed the boundaries of the traditional concept of science. On the contrary, in the teachings of the main representatives of the discipline up to Wolff and Baumgarten one finds a new concept of the theory of being as a theory of the universal and necessary structure of reality which is common to God and every possible world. Thus we do not encounter abolition but rather a radicalisation of tendencies which have shaped the development of first philosophy since the medieval reception of Aristotle and his Arabic interpreters. These tendencies are: the turn from a theological to an ontological concept of first philosophy, from its conception as practical wisdom to the idea of a universal theoretical science, from transcendent being as the starting point of thought to the transcategorical and thus transcendental content of being as such. * Master Eckhart: Historical and Systematical Perspectives As part of the research on the medieval theory of transcendentia, this project examines the peculiar form which the theory of transcendentals takes in Meister Eckhart. The project attempts at the same time to reconstruct Eckhart's Opus propositionum, especially the 9th tractate: \\"De natura superioris, et inferioris eius oppositi\\". * A Mystical Treatise between Convention and Provocation - Possibilities and Limits of Expression in the \\"Theologia deutsch\\" (\\"The Francfurt\\") The treatise written in the 14th century which became popular in the 16th under the title Theologia deutsch, has been considered in scholarship mainly from two perspectives: on the one hand as a key text of the Reformation - it was first edited by Martin Luther - on the other hand as a document of timeless Christian spirituality that can inspire and direct even the life of modern readers. Both approaches have invested the Theologia deutsch with an aura which obfuscates its specific theologico- philosophical profile. Originally it was an anonymous treatise from the context of the so-called \\"German Mysticism\\" of the 14th century, transmitted in only a few manuscripts. This is where the planned investigation begins: Disregarding its reception during the Reformation, the Theologia deutsch is examined it its original formative context and thus as a mystical treatise of a special type, which does not at all transmit a timeless spirituality but rather - like other Latin and colloquial texts - sounds out possibilities of expression. The study centres on the Christology and the doctrine of God of the Theologia deutsch. Besides that it discusses - since according to the prologue the author was an anonymous Knight of the German Order from Francfurt - the problems of authorship, authority, and authenticity. * William of Auxerre, Summa de officiis ecclesiasticis, *First Critical Edition in Digital Format In the beginnings of the University of Paris around the year 1200 the Magister William of Auxerre wrote his explanation of liturgy which attempts to elucidate all the cultic-ritual actions and objects of Christian liturgy and to suggest their hidden meaning. The edition of the yet unpublished Summa de officiis ecclesiasticis makes use of the possibilities of digital data processing and further develops in this medium the methodological standards and formats of presentation established for printed editions. The edition is accompanied by a study on the concept of time which forms the basis of William's interpretation of the liturgy and according to which several levels of time and meaning become intertwined during the ritual. * Ibn B√¢jja's Kit√¢b al-nafs: The First Western Commentary on the De anima Ibn B√¢jja (ob. 1139), known to the Latin scholastics as \\"Avempace\\", was - as the predecessor of Averroes - the first Spanish-Arabic philosopher to comment in a systematical manner upon the writings of Aristotle. Thus he prepared the work of \\"the Commentator\\" with respect to both method and content. This is true especially in the field of psychology and the doctrine of intellect where Ibn B√¢jja, as a follower of Alexander of Aphrodisias and Alfarabi, formed an Aristotelian counterbalance to the psychology of Avicenna, which was more strongly influenced by Neoplatonism and by the medical tradition. With the preparation of the critical edition and German translation of the Kit√¢b al-nafs Ibn B√¢jja's most central writing on psychology shall be rendered accessible in a reliable form supplemented with guides to its sources. The edition will be accompanied by a study which - for the first time - examines in detail the philosophical questions and solutions of this early period of the reception of De anima. It enquires into the conceptual and historical background of problems like the concept of intention (ma'n√¢) or the so-called \\"conjunction with the Active Intellect\\" - ideas which came to exercise a longstanding and varied influence. * \\"The Birth of a World\\". Investigations into Themes in the Thought of Michel Foucault Starting from an analysis of the opposition of truth and fiction dictated by the traditional idea of philosophy and science, and an examination of the concomitant confrontation of philosophy and science on the one hand and literature on the other hand this study investigates the peculiar status which Michel Foucault gives to the concept of knowledge. This concept of knowledge corresponds in Foucault's writings to a specific concept of fiction in a way that has yet to be clearly defined. To this end Foucault's early texts (apparently dismissed by him later), the long Binswanger- introduction (1954), and the Arch√©ologie du savoir are all searched for a motif which can be called - employing an expression by Foucault himself - the \\"Birth of a World\\". The investigation into this theme renders visible elements of \\"structure\\" and \\"history\\". In the course of this reading the evolution of the foundational thought-structures leading to Foucault's specific concept of knowledge will be examined.  Edition projects  * The Commentary on the Sentences by Durandus of St. Pour√ßain (a S. Porciano) As J. Koch has shown, the commentary on the Sentences by Durandus of St. Pour√ßain (1275‚Äì1334) is preserved in three recensions. While the last redaction was printed in the 16th century, the first two versions remain unpublished. Of particular interest is the first, because it contains the sharpest polemic against Thomas Aquinas and because it engendered the most critical response by his contemporaries (such as Petrus de Palude and Petrus Aureoli). In the first place a computerised copy of the third version will be made, which can serve as an effective research instrument. The project centres, nevertheless, on the critical edition of the first version which will be made on the basis of a complete collation of all manuscripts. * Critical Edition of the Commentaries on Book V and VI of the Nicomachean Ethics in the Latin Translation by Robert Grosseteste The project consists in the study of the Latin reception of the commentaries on Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics composed and assembled in twelfth century Constantinople at the initiative of Princess Anna Comnena. The critical edition of the texts of the commentaries on book V (Anonymous and Michael of Ephesus) and book VI (Eustratius of Nicaea) will complete Mercken's edition of the commentaries on books I-IV (CLCAG 6.1) and VII-X (CLCAG 6.3). The edition of the text will be introduced by a study of the sources of the Greek original text and its Latin reception in the thirteenth and fourteenth century. * Averroes: Collected Works The Latin translation of three of the most important works of Averroes, the Long Commentaries on De caelo, Physica, and Metaphysica, will be edited and published in the series \\"Bibliotheca\\" affiliated with the Recherches de Th√©ologie et Philosophie m√©di√©vales. This \\"editio minor\\" is based on the early printings and some few manuscripts. It is further intended to make these commentaries eventually available on CD-Rom. The edition of the Long Commentary on De caelo on the basis of F. Carmody's edition, revised by R. Arnzen, has already been published. At the moment the edition of the Long Commentary on the Metaphysica (by Dag N. Hasse, W√ºrzburg) and of the Long Commentary on the Physica are in preparation.  Collaborations  * Historical-Critical Edition of the Arabic-Latin Translations of Averroes's (Ibn Rushd's) Commentaries on Aristotle This project forms part of the edition of the Opera omnia, supervised by the International Union of Academies (Director: Gerhard Endress; responsible for the Averroes Latinus: Andreas Speer). It is funded by the Nordrhein- Westf√§lische Akademie der Wissenschaften. ** Middle Commentary on the Categoriae This Middle Commentary on the Categoriae forms part of the group of Middle Commentaries which Averroes devoted to the Organon and whose Latin translation is attributed to William of Luna. Prepared by a large number of publications, the work currently in progress continues the edition of the Middle Commentary on Peri Hermeneias which has already been published. At the moment the text is prepared for printing, the apparatus and the Latin-Arabic glossary are being adapted to the definite text. At the same time some parts of the introduction are developed further; for example, the question whether there were any double translations is examined, as is the Hebrew-Latin translation from the Renaissance. Did its author, Jacob Mantino, make use of the medieval Arabic-Latin translation or its editio princeps? ** Long Commentary on the Physica Averroes completed his Long Commentary on the Physics around the year 1186. Like a number of other works by Averroes, it was translated from Arabic to Latin at the beginning of the 13th century, most probably by Michael Scot. More than sixty medieval manuscripts, complete and fragmentary, preserve the versio vulgata of the text. The detailed documentation of its textual history evolves continually. With the exception of a few manuscripts the dependences and interrelations in the manuscript tradition have been established on the basis of a comparison of approximately 1100 positions. The results concerning the filiation of the manuscripts can thus be established. ** Long Commentary on the Physica, Book VII, according to Ms. Vienna, Austrian National Library, Lat. 2334 In the manuscript of the Austrian National Library, Vienna lat. 2334, the seventh and part of the eight book of the Long Commentary are preserved in a translation which differs considerably from the one by Michel Scot, both in vocabulary and in syntax. This text will be edited separately. In order to prove that the translator was not Michel Scot, but probably Hermannus Alemannus, this edition will be accompanied by a detailed comparison of technical terms and of important portions of the text. The study has been approved by the Nordrhein- Westf√§lische Akademie and will be published by F. Sch√∂ningh, Paderborn () ** Arabic Concepts of Metaphysics, Considering in particular Averroes's Epitome on Aristotle's Metaphysics The project comprises two parts: First, a historical-critical edition of the Arabic text of Averroes's Epitome on the Metaphysics which is based on all available Arabic manuscripts and which takes into account the Hebrew translation from the 13th century, as well as the Latin translation from the 16th based on the latter. The edition will be introduced by a philological study and accompanied by an English translation, in order to render the text available for a larger group of scholars in medieval philosophy. The second part consists in a historical and philosophical analysis of Arabic concepts of metaphysics, its foundations, objects, parts, and methods. Averroes's concept of metaphysics will be investigated in the historical and philosophical context of competing ideas. Of special interest is the question whether in the post-Avicennian tradition metaphysics was conceived as ontology and/or universal science in contradistinction from theology. ** Averroes-Database The bibliography of secondary literature on Averroes published since 1980 contains at present 1043 titles. It is constantly updated and accessible via internet. The bibliography of Averroes's works provides information on the relevant manuscripts, editions, and translations. It is still in preparation, but the sections on Logic, Philosophy of Nature, Psychology and the Doctrine of Intellect are already [online http://www.thomasinst.uni-koeln.de/averroes]. * Historical- Critical Edition of the Opera omnia of Nicolaus Cusanus # Reformatio generalis (Bd.

The Latin text of the Meteorology has already been published on the CD-ROM version of the Aristoteles Latinus (√âdition CD-ROM des traductions gr√©co-latines d'Aristote) in 2003. * Historical-Critical Edition of Book I and II of the Commentary on the Physics by Aegidius Romanus The Augustinian monk Aegidius Romanus (ca. 1243/7-1316) was a prominent figure at the University of Paris in the late 13th century. His philosophical works consist mainly in commentaries on Aristotle. In the late 13th and during the 14th century Aegidius's commentaries were well known; their impact can be compared with the paraphrases by Albert the Great and the commentaries by Thomas Aquinas. This project centres on the edition of book I and II of his commentary on the Physics (ca. 1274/75). They are devoted to some central issues in Aristotle's philosophy of nature, namely the problems of the principles of change, the concept of nature, and the concepts of necessity and chance. Aegidius's commentary is extant in thirty manuscripts. The manuscript tradition is complex because it is partly a University tradition, dependent on one exemplar from the university milieu, and partly independent. The text of books I and II has been established on the basis of eight manuscripts, and the sources have been traced. At present the historical and philological introduction is in preparation. The edition will be part of Aegidii Romani Opera omnia, edited by the Unione Accademica Nazionale, directed by Francesco Del Punta.  History  The foundation of the Thomas-Institut on October 10, 1950, grew out of efforts to reinstall a centre for the study of medieval philosophy in Germany after World War II, one that would be able to inspire research into a philosophical tradition representing positive ideas and humanistic values. It was hoped that the discussion of the problems of our time would benefit from the results of such studies. Nevertheless, the Thomas-Institut was not conceived as part of the movement of Neo-Scholasticism, but rather as an institution which would conduct research in medieval philosophy much in the same way that elsewhere research in ancient and modern philosophy was done - never as a narrowly historical enterprise, but always in touch with contemporary questions and perspectives. Josef Koch (1885‚Äì1967), then one of the rare German scholars internationally renowned in the field of medieval philosophy, had been chosen in 1948 to become a professor at the University of Cologne with a view to the Institute's founding. In close connection with the founding of the Institute stood the creation of the Mediaevistentagung, and the series Studien und Texte zur Geistesgeschichte des Mittelalters, both of which were devised by Koch and are still carried on today. The development of the Institute was boosted by a grant from the American High Commissioner for Germany, arranged by Professor John O. Riedl of the Educational and Cultural Relation Division, and later of Marquette University in Milwaukee - a personal friend of founder Josef Koch. The Institute was able to move into three rooms in Universit√§tsstra√üe 22, where later it was allowed to expand considerably, and where it is still housed today. Since 1952 the Thomas-Institut has been maintained by the University of Cologne and has become an integral part of the Philosophy Department. The first tasks of the newly created Institute consisted in building up a research library and in procuring the necessary microfilm copies of medieval manuscripts in order to render critical editions possible. The collection concentrated at first on Meister Eckhart and Nicolaus Cusanus, who were then studied by Koch and editions of whose works were prepared at the Institute in continuation of projects begun before the war. The fund of manuscript copies grew steadily and was enriched by every new project. The library was designed to include not only primary texts from the Middle Ages and bibliographical material but a historical section spanning from Antiquity to contemporary philosophy that permits the systematic studies intended by the aims described in 1950. In 1954 Koch was succeeded in the director's office by Paul Wilpert (1906‚Äì1967), an expert in Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas and already affiliated with the Cusanus edition since the 1940s. It was Wilpert who created the Miscellanea Mediaevalia series in 1962, thus providing an organ for the publications of the Institute, first and foremost the proceedings of the Mediaevistentagungen. In 1961 Wilpert organized in Cologne the 2nd International Congress of Medieval Philosophy of the Soci√©t√© internationale pour l'√âtude de la Philosophie M√©di√©vale (S.I.E.P.M), whose vice chairman he had become in the founding year of the organization, 1958. With the activities of Wilpert's collaborator, Gudrun Vuillemin-Diem, the Thomas-Institut took part in the Aristoteles Latinus project of the International Union of Academies. Ms. Vuillemin-Diem has continued working with the Thomas-Institut under its subsequent directors, and has published to date the four medieval recensions of the Metaphysics. After Wilpert's sudden death, Albert Zimmermann (1928‚Äì2017), a pupil of Josef Koch's, became the third director of the Thomas-Institut. His fields of research are especially the Aristotelian philosophy of nature in the Middle Ages and Latin Averroism. When the International Union of Academies took over the Averrois Opera project from the Medieval Academy of America, Zimmermann became its general editor in 1974 (until 1996) and the Thomas-Institut took the responsibility for the edition of the Latin translations of Averroes's commentaries. The project currently employs two editors, Roland Hissette and Horst Schmieja, and is funded by the Nordrhein-Westf√§lische Akademie der Wissenschaften. In 1992 Zimmermann was elected president of the S.I.E.P.M. Zimmermann retired in 1993 and was followed in office in 1994 by Jan Adrianus Aertsen, formerly a professor at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (since 1984). His main area of research is the history of the Doctrine of Transcendentals. In 1997 Aertsen was elected vice chairman of the S.I.E.P.M. The 4th Symposium Averroicum, combined with the sixth conference of the editors of Averroes's works, was held in Cologne in 1996 in collaboration with Gerhard Endre√ü (Bochum). In 1997 the Thomas-Institut under the lead of Jan A. Aertsen and Andreas Speer organized the 10th International Congress of Medieval Philosophy in Erfurt. Following a suggestion by Jan A. Aertsen and a conference in Cologne co-organized by the Thomas-Institut, a Gesellschaft f√ºr Philosophie des Mittelalters und der Renaissance (GPMR) was set up in 2003, for which the Thomas-Institut currently provides the office. The present director of the Thomas-Institut, Andreas Speer, formerly professor at W√ºrzburg (2000), was appointed in 2004.  Activities   Mediaevistentagung  Already on October 11, 1950, one day after the foundation of the Thomas- Institut, the first Mediaevistentagung took place. Josef Koch had invited scholars from Germany and from the Institut sup√©rieur de philosophie of Louvain with the declared aim to assemble - not for a \\"congress\\" but in \\"friendly discussion\\" - all those interested in medieval studies: philosophers, theologians, historians, philologists, art- and music- historians. This interdisciplinary approach has since determined the programmes of the Mediaevistentagungen, which until 1960 were held every year. Since 1960 the Thomas-Institut organizes those conferences every two years in the second week of September. Beginning with the second conference in 1951, which was devoted to medieval symbolism, every Mediaevistentagung has been centred on a global topic that stood in relation with the work done at the Institute or with current interests in the field of medieval studies. Since 1952, the results have been documented; the first proceedings were published in the series Studien und Texte zur Geistesgeschichte des Mittelalters (vols. 3 and 5), since 1956 they are published in the Miscellanea Mediaevalia series created especially for that purpose. While remaining true to its original concept, the Mediaevistentagung has become more fully international, bigger - the record was set with circa 300 participants in 1994 - and, not to mention, longer - it now lasts a week. In 2004 a workshop was introduced to precede the main conference. It provides a forum for younger scholars to present their works in progress or, alternatively, presents an opportunity to share different approaches and projects in open discussion.  Forschungskolloquium  The \\"Forschungskolloquium\\" is a series of loosely connected lectures by our collaborators, guests, or invitees. It affords an opportunity to present a particular field of research to the colleagues and at the same time to the wider public.  K√∂ln-Bonner Philosophisches Kolloquium  The \\"K√∂ln-Bonner Philosophisches Kolloquium\\", organized together with the Philosophy Department of Bonn University, is a semester long reading course for graduate and older undergraduate students (taking place every two weeks). The course examines a systematic topic (e.g. Aristotelian psychology, concepts of metaphysics) throughout ancient and medieval philosophy. Further reading * Meuthen, Erich. \\"Das Thomas-Institut.

Early life Bertie was a younger son of Montagu Bertie, 2nd Earl of Lindsey by his second wife, Lady Norreys, daughter of Edward Wray, of Rycote, Oxfordshire and widow of Hon. Edward Sackville. His mother, who died shortly after his birth, seems to have let him enough of an inheritance to be comfortably provided for, including the manor of Nutley in Long Crendon. Bertie was one of the commissioners of assessment for Oxfordshire from 1677 to 1680. When Lord Gerard raised a troop of horse in 1678 in anticipation of a war with France, Bertie was commissioned a captain; the troop was disbanded in the following year. In 1678, after Thomas Wancklyn was expelled from the House of Commons, he was nominated for the vacant Parliamentary seat at Westbury on the interest of his elder brother, Lord Norreys, whose wife was a part owner of the manor of Westbury. The Berties, representing the court party, were opposed by a local squire, William Trenchard, a Presbyterian. Henry was returned by 21 votes to 13; two election petitions by Trenchard and the opposition to overturn the result were defeated. It is not clear that he was active in the Cavalier Parliament, and in December, he was sent for in custody for non-attendance. In the general election of March 1679, he was defeated by Trenchard and Richard Lewis, the other sitting member. Appointed a commissioner of assessment for Buckinghamshire and a justice of the peace for Oxfordshire in 1679, he and Lewis defeated the two exclusionist candidates, Trenchard and Edward Norton at Westbury in the general election of October 1679. He was not appointed to any committees in the subsequent Exclusion Bill Parliament; during 1680, he was taken off both commissions of assessment, although he was made a deputy lieutenant of Oxfordshire, and in November, an election petition by Trenchard and Norton was accepted by Parliament. Bertie and Lewis were turned out and the returning officer, the mayor of Westbury, was confined for two weeks for \\"great misdemeanours\\" in making the return. At the 1681 election, he stood instead as an uncontested court candidate for Woodstock, where his brother had built up an interest through the Norreys estates and his office as Lord Lieutenant of Oxfordshire. No Parliamentary activity by Henry can be traced in the Third Exclusion Bill Parliament. Henry and Norreys were both admitted as freemen of Oxford on 14 June 1681; later that year, Henry served on the foreman of the grand jury of Oxfordshire during Norreys' successful proceedings against Stephen College on the court's behalf. He was commissioned a captain of Oxfordshire militia horse before 1681, and after the discovery of the Rye House Plot in 1683, he was employed in searching for arms secreted by the conspirators. In March 1685, Bertie was returned as Member of Parliament for Oxford on the interest of his brother, now Lord Abingdon. All the candidates were Tories; one of the sitting members, Whigs, had died and the other retired from politics. Bertie topped the poll with 657 votes, the recorder of the borough, Sir George Pudsey received 611, while Sir Edward Norreys, who had represented the county and whose daughter Bertie would soon marry, polled only 53. Abingdon celebrated the event with a splendid celebration for the members of the corporation at his seat in Rycote, from which most returned \\"drunk and fell off their horses\\", according to Anthony Wood. He showed more activity in this Parliament, serving on the elections committee and the committee for taking accounts of the commissioners for disbanding the army. Monmouth Rebellion and disaffection After the outbreak of the Monmouth Rebellion, Bertie and his half-brother Richard were commissioned captains on 18 June to raise independent troops of horse. On 21 June, Henry led the troop of Oxfordshire militia horse out of Oxford toward Dorchester and Abingdon to act against the rebels in Somerset, while Abingdon raised his troop on his behalf. The troop was disbanded in December; the independent troops that were not incorporated into existing regiments were disbanded after the collapse of the rebellion, Wood records that Henry and Richard were among the officers deprived of their commissions for voting in the House of Commons in favor of the address to James II against employing Roman Catholic officers. Sometime after 1685, he was appointed a justice of the peace for Buckinghamshire. Like his brothers, Bertie belonged to the High Tories who were alienated from the court by the pro-Catholic policies of King James. In 1687, he lost his militia commission, his deputy lieutenancy, and was removed from the commission of the peace in Oxfordshire. In February 1688, Bertie was removed from the Buckinghamshire bench as well. He was admitted a freeman of Devizes in March, but was removed from the Oxford corporation in June when it was purged and remodelled. In September 1688, his nephew Lord Norreys treated some of the country gentlemen of Oxfordshire to solicit support for Henry in the anticipated elections. He was reinstated at Oxford in October when the King began to reverse the program of remodelling the corporations. By this time, the Glorious Revolution was already in train. Early in November, Abingdon was the first of the peers to openly take arms for William of Orange. On 22 November, Bertie and his father-in-law Sir Edward Norreys held a dinner with the corporation of Oxford, and agreed to bring Oxford over to William as well. On 25 November, he led a company of men out of Oxford to Witney, who met reinforcements there and proceeded toward Banbury. Bertie and his militia joined Sir Ralph Dutton in rescuing Lord Lovelace from jail in Gloucester; Lovelace, a zealous Whig and political rival of the Berties before the Revolution, had been captured at Cirencester trying to break through a force loyal to James. Bertie returned to Oxford on 5 December with the troops under Lord Lovelace, who came to hold Oxford for the Prince. He and Norreys were returned for Oxford in the abortive December elections. Under King William in 1689, Bertie was restored as a deputy lieutenant of Oxfordshire, which he held until 1701, to the commission of the peace and as a militia captain there, and as a commissioner for the assessment of both Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire. He and Norreys were returned again for Oxford to the Convention Parliament. He was not active as a committeeman, and his time there was principally distinguished by a violent quarrel with Sir William Harbord over some remarks by the latter aimed at Bertie, about (royal) pensioners and the Westbury election. The matter ran close to a duel, and Bertie had to be secured by the serjeant-at-arms until Speaker Trevor extracted pledges from them not to renew the quarrel. Family Before May 1687, Bertie married Philadelphia Norreys (d. bef. 1715), daughter and heiress of Sir Edward Norreys of Weston-on-the-Green. They had five children: *James Bertie (died 7 May 1728), married Elizabeth Harris (d. 1720) and had a son, Norreys Bertie, and a daughter, Philadelphia (d. 1720) *Rev. Charles Montagu Bertie (died 17 October 1744), rector of Uffington, died unmarried *Eleanora Bertie, died unmarried *Anne Bertie, died unmarried *Catherine Bertie, married Francis Carr Clerke After Philadelphia's death, Bertie married Catherine Fetherston (d. 8 February 1736), daughter of Sir Heneage Fetherston, 1st Baronet, but had no children by her. His brother-in-law James Norreys died in 1718 and left the Norreys estates to Bertie's eldest son James. Bertie died at Chesterton, Oxfordshire in 1734.

St Mary's Church, Fordingbridge is a 12th‚Äì13th-century church in Hampshire, England. It was restored in the 19th century. History A church is mentioned in the Domesday Book in 1086. It was rebuilt by the Normans around 1150 and would then have been an open space internally. The North Chapel and north and south aisles were added around 1230. Within another 100 years the clerestory had been added, the tower raised (in modern times housing 8 bells plus a Sanctus bell) and the North Chapel extended. The Chapel has a straight tie beam truss roof of chestnut that masquerades as a hammerbeam roof. Lands in Fordingbridge and the advowson of the church were granted to King's College, Cambridge in 1447 by Henry VI, after being given to the Crown by Humphrey, Duke of Buckingham. The font, thought to be early 14th-century Externally the Church has changed little since the 16th century although originally the exterior flint work would have been plastered like one of its neighbours, St Mary, Breamore. Internally the Church looks much as it did after the 1840 renovation except for the addition of the organ in 1887 and the reredos in 1820. The Church once had a \\"three- decker\\" pulpit but this has been removed. In very recent years the Victorian pews were replaced by chairs to facilitate using the space much more flexibly. In 2000 a new window was commissioned in the south aisle to commemorate the millennium. Also two of the bells were sent to the Whitechapel Bell Foundry to be recast and re-tuned. Vicarages There are two surviving vicarages in Fordingbridge, the imposing residence opposite the West Front built in 1817 and now converted to apartments and the current, more modern building opposite the South side. Churchyard The churchyard has a monument to the safe building family \\"Chubb\\", and also a memorial to the last British man killed in a duel in England, James Alexander Seton. Along with all the town burial sites (except the new Catholic burial ground) St Mary's Churchyard was closed in 1896 and replaced by the new cemetery at Stuckton Road. In modern times the Churchyard has been cleared to allow easier maintenance and many of the gravestones now form the path from the lichgate to the North Porch. The original locations of some of the stones and the owners of some of worn stones can be deduced from the Fordingbridge Sexton's register which covers the period from 1730. Services The church choir can usually be heard every Sunday supporting services such as the Family Communion, with traditional Evensong on the third and fourth Sunday evenings each month There is an annual Patronal Festival on the 1st weekend in July.

The resulting maneuver is a more efficient way to gain kinetic energy than applying the same impulse outside of a gravitational well. The gain in efficiency is explained by the Oberth effect, wherein the use of an engine at higher speeds generates greater mechanical energy than use at lower speeds. In practical terms, this means that the most energy-efficient method for a spacecraft to burn its engine is at the lowest possible orbital periapsis, when its orbital velocity (and so, its kinetic energy) is greatest. In some cases, it is even worth spending fuel on slowing the spacecraft into a gravity well to take advantage of the efficiencies of the Oberth effect. The maneuver and effect are named after the person who first described them in 1927, Hermann Oberth, an Austro-Hungarian-born German physicist and a founder of modern rocketry. The Oberth effect is strongest at a point in orbit known as the periapsis, where the gravitational potential is lowest, and the speed is highest. This is because firing a rocket engine at high speed causes a greater change in kinetic energy than when fired at lower speed. Because the vehicle remains near periapsis only for a short time, for the Oberth maneuver to be most effective the vehicle must be able to generate as much impulse as possible in the shortest possible time. As a result the Oberth maneuver is much more useful for high-thrust rocket engines like liquid-propellant rockets, and less useful for low-thrust reaction engines such as ion drives, which take a long time to gain speed. The Oberth effect also can be used to understand the behavior of multi-stage rockets: the upper stage can generate much more usable kinetic energy than the total chemical energy of the propellants it carries. The Oberth effect occurs because the propellant has more usable energy due to its kinetic energy in addition to its chemical potential energy. The vehicle is able to employ this kinetic energy to generate more mechanical power. Description in terms of work Rocket engines produce the same force regardless of their velocity. A rocket acting on a fixed object, as in a static firing, does no useful work at all; the rocket's stored energy is entirely expended on accelerating its propellant in the form of exhaust. But when the rocket moves, its thrust acts through the distance it moves. Force multiplied by distance is the definition of mechanical energy or work. So the farther the rocket and payload move during the burn (i.e. the faster they move), the greater the kinetic energy imparted to the rocket and its payload and the less to its exhaust. This is shown as follows. The mechanical work done on the rocket (W) is defined as the dot product of the force of the engine's thrust (\\\\vec{F}) and the displacement it travels during the burn (\\\\vec{s}): : W = \\\\vec{F} \\\\cdot \\\\vec{s}. If the burn is made in the prograde direction, \\\\vec{F} \\\\cdot \\\\vec{s} = \\\\|F\\\\\\\\cdot \\\\|s\\\\= F \\\\cdot s. The work results in a change in kinetic energy : \\\\Delta E_k = F \\\\cdot s. Differentiating with respect to time, we obtain : \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}E_k}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} = F \\\\cdot \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}s}{\\\\mathrm{d}t}, or : \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}E_k}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} = F \\\\cdot v, where v is the velocity. Dividing by the instantaneous mass m to express this in terms of specific energy (e_k), we get : \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}e_k}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} = \\\\frac F m \\\\cdot v = a \\\\cdot v, where a is the acceleration vector. Thus it can be readily seen that the rate of gain of specific energy of every part of the rocket is proportional to speed and, given this, the equation can be integrated (numerically or otherwise) to calculate the overall increase in specific energy of the rocket. Impulsive burn Integrating the above energy equation is often unnecessary if the burn duration is short. Short burns of chemical rocket engines close to periapsis or elsewhere are usually mathematically modelled as impulsive burns, where the force of the engine dominates any other forces that might change the vehicle's energy over the burn. For example, as a vehicle falls towards periapsis in any orbit (closed or escape orbits) the velocity relative to the central body increases. Briefly burning the engine (an ‚Äúimpulsive burn‚Äù) prograde at periapsis increases the velocity by the same increment as at any other time (\\\\Delta v). However, since the vehicle's kinetic energy is related to the square of its velocity, this increase in velocity has a non-linear effect on the vehicle's kinetic energy, leaving it with higher energy than if the burn were achieved at any other time.Atomic Rockets web site: nyrath@projectrho.com. Oberth calculation for a parabolic orbit If an impulsive burn of Œîv is performed at periapsis in a parabolic orbit, then the velocity at periapsis before the burn is equal to the escape velocity (Vesc), and the specific kinetic energy after the burn isFollowing the calculation on rec.arts.sf.science. : \\\\begin{align} e_k &= \\\\tfrac{1}{2} V^2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\tfrac{1}{2} (V_\\\\text{esc} + \\\\Delta v )^2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\tfrac{1}{2} V_\\\\text{esc} ^ 2 + \\\\Delta v V_\\\\text{esc} + \\\\tfrac{1}{2} \\\\Delta v^2, \\\\end{align} where V = V_\\\\text{esc} + \\\\Delta v. When the vehicle leaves the gravity field, the loss of specific kinetic energy is : \\\\tfrac{1}{2} V_\\\\text{esc}^2, so it retains the energy : \\\\Delta v V_\\\\text{esc} + \\\\tfrac{1}{2} \\\\Delta v^2, which is larger than the energy from a burn outside the gravitational field (\\\\tfrac{1}{2} \\\\Delta v^2) by : \\\\Delta v V_\\\\text{esc}. When the vehicle has left the gravity well, it is travelling at a speed : V = \\\\Delta v \\\\sqrt{1 + \\\\frac{2 V_\\\\text{esc}}{\\\\Delta v}}. For the case where the added impulse Œîv is small compared to escape velocity, the 1 can be ignored, and the effective Œîv of the impulsive burn can be seen to be multiplied by a factor of simply : \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2 V_\\\\text{esc}}{\\\\Delta v}}. Similar effects happen in closed and hyperbolic orbits. Parabolic example If the vehicle travels at velocity v at the start of a burn that changes the velocity by Œîv, then the change in specific orbital energy (SOE) due to the new orbit is : v \\\\,\\\\Delta v + \\\\tfrac{1}{2}(\\\\Delta v)^2. Once the spacecraft is far from the planet again, the SOE is entirely kinetic, since gravitational potential energy approaches zero. Therefore, the larger the v at the time of the burn, the greater the final kinetic energy, and the higher the final velocity. The effect becomes more pronounced the closer to the central body, or more generally, the deeper in the gravitational field potential in which the burn occurs, since the velocity is higher there. So if a spacecraft is on a parabolic flyby of Jupiter with a periapsis velocity of 50 km/s and performs a 5 km/s burn, it turns out that the final velocity change at great distance is 22.9 km/s, giving a multiplication of the burn by 4.58 times. Paradox It may seem that the rocket is getting energy for free, which would violate conservation of energy. However, any gain to the rocket's kinetic energy is balanced by a relative decrease in the kinetic energy the exhaust is left with (the kinetic energy of the exhaust may still increase, but it does not increase as much). Contrast this to the situation of static firing, where the speed of the engine is fixed at zero. This means that its kinetic energy does not increase at all, and all the chemical energy released by the fuel is converted to the exhaust's kinetic energy (and heat). At very high speeds the mechanical power imparted to the rocket can exceed the total power liberated in the combustion of the propellant; this may also seem to violate conservation of energy. But the propellants in a fast-moving rocket carry energy not only chemically, but also in their own kinetic energy, which at speeds above a few kilometres per second exceed the chemical component. When these propellants are burned, some of this kinetic energy is transferred to the rocket along with the chemical energy released by burning. The Oberth effect can therefore partly make up for what is extremely low efficiency early in the rocket's flight when it is moving only slowly. Most of the work done by a rocket early in flight is \\"invested\\" in the kinetic energy of the propellant not yet burned, part of which they will release later when they are burned.

Early history  The station was originally opened as Tenterden but was renamed Rolvenden in 1903 when the current Tenterden Town station opened. The name Rolvenden is not really appropriate, the station is 2 miles from the village and is closer to Tenterden. When Colonel Stephens first opened the railway Rolvenden served as his locomotive workshop in a similar capacity to today. However the limited machinery and space meant during the 1930s it became harder to overhaul the line's ageing fleet. Most engines were sent to Ashford works to be overhauled. The locomotive shed and passenger station closed in 1954 and both were subsequently demolished. Freight services continued until 1961. After British Railways closed the railway the site of the original locomotive shed was sold for light industrial buildings.  Heritage Railway Society history  The Kent and East Sussex Railway built a new locomotive shed on the other side of the line from the original. Currently the station is home to the Kent and East Sussex Railway's loco department who are responsible for the restoration and maintenance of steam engines owned by the railway. The loco department is one of the most crucial contributors to the railway's success. The site consists of a two track shed which has enough space for around 4 locomotives. The railway also owns the field next to it and has plans to use at least part of it as a car park. Rolvenden is also the coaling depot and this is where all the locomotives are prepared for a day's work. It now has a signal box, water tower and passing loop. The station was rebuilt when the line reopened in 1974.  Services   Locomotives in residence  * Number 3 LB&SCR; A1 Class 0-6-0T (Terrier) 'Bodiam'.

As a Major Leaguer, he appeared in 135 games as a second- or third-string receiver over all or parts of seven seasons (1953‚Äì55; 1960‚Äì63) with the Washington Senators, Pittsburgh Pirates and Philadelphia Phillies.

The Pirates won both contests, however, and went on to a seven-game upset on Bill Mazeroski's walk-off home run. Oldis' greatest number of games played was 47, in his final major league season.

In the book, Klein argues that neoliberal free market policies (as advocated by the economist Milton Friedman) have risen to prominence in some developed countries because of a deliberate strategy of \\"shock therapy\\". This centers on the exploitation of national crises (disasters or upheavals) to establish controversial and questionable policies, while citizens are too distracted (emotionally and physically) to engage and develop an adequate response, and resist effectively. The book suggests that some man-made events, such as the Iraq War, were undertaken with the intention of pushing through such unpopular policies in their wake. Some reviewers criticized the book for making what they viewed as simplifications of political phenomena, while others lauded it as a compelling and important work. The book served as the main source of a 2009 documentary feature film with the same title directed by Michael Winterbottom.  Synopsis  The book is divided into seven parts with a total of 21 chapters. Part 1 begins with a chapter on psychiatric shock therapy and the covert experiments conducted by the psychiatrist Ewen Cameron in collusion with the Central Intelligence Agency. The second chapter introduces Milton Friedman and his Chicago school of economics, whom Klein describes as leading a laissez-faire capitalist movement committed to creating free markets that are even less regulated than those that existed before the Great Depression. Part 2 discusses the use of \\"shock doctrine\\" to transform South American economies in the 1970s, focusing on the 1973 coup in Chile led by General Augusto Pinochet and influenced by a prominent group of Chilean economists who had been trained at the University of Chicago in the Economics department, funded by the CIA, and advised by Milton Friedman. Klein connects torture with economic shock therapy. Part 3 covers attempts to apply the shock doctrine without the need for extreme violence against sections of the population. Klein says that Margaret Thatcher applied mild shock \\"therapy\\" facilitated by the Falklands War, while free market reform in Bolivia was possible due to a combination of pre-existing economic crises and the charisma of Jeffrey Sachs. Part 4 reports on how Klein thinks the shock doctrine was applied in Poland, Russia, South Africa and to the tiger economies during the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Part 5 introduces the \\"Disaster Capitalism Complex,‚Äù where the author claims that companies have learnt to profit from disasters. Part 6 discusses the use of \\"Shock and awe\\" in the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the subsequent occupation of Iraq, which Klein describes as the most comprehensive and full-scale implementation of the shock doctrine ever attempted. Part 7 is about winners and losers of economic shock therapy ‚Äì how small groups will often do very well by moving into luxurious gated communities while large sections of the population are left with decaying public infrastructure, declining incomes and increased unemployment. The Conclusion details the backlash against the \\"shock doctrine\\" and economic institutions which, in Klein's view, encourage it ‚Äì like the World Bank and IMF. South America and Lebanon post-2006 are shown in a positive light, where politicians are already rolling back free-market policies, with some mention of the increased campaigning by community-minded activists in South Africa and China. Reactions Favourable Paul B. Farrell from the Dow Jones Business News argued that The Shock Doctrine \\"may be the most important book on economics in the 21st century.‚ÄùPaul Farrell, Marketwatch, October 2007 In The Guardian, John Gray hailed it as one of the \\"very few books that really help us understand the present\\", describing the work as \\"both timely and devastating.‚Äú William S. Kowinski of the San Francisco Chronicle praised Klein's prose and wrote that the author \\"may well have revealed the master narrative of our time.‚Äú In The Irish Times, Tom Clonan reported that she \\"systematically and calmly demonstrates to the reader\\" the way in which neoconservative figures were intimately linked to seismic events that \\"resulted in the loss of millions of lives.‚Äù In the Los Angeles Times, Richard Rayner opined, \\"Not everybody's going to agree with her, but this is reporting and history-writing in the tradition of Izzy Stone and Upton Sinclair. Klein upends assumptions and demands that we think ‚Äì her book is thrilling, troubling and very dark.\\" Stephen Amidon of the New York Observer affirmed the applicability of Klein's thesis to the Iraq War and argued, \\"Seen through the lens of Naomi Klein‚Äôs analysis, [it] makes horrifying sense, right down to Mr. Rumsfeld‚Äôs decision to allow the looting of the nation‚Äôs cultural identity.\\" Shashi Tharoor noted the work's \\"meticulous endnotes\\" and stated, referring to globalization, that Klein \\"has established herself as its principal naysayer.‚Äù Katy Guest of The Independent praised the book as \\"a compelling account of the way big business and politics use global disasters for their own ends.‚Äù Juan Santos, winner of the 2016 Nobel Peace Prize, called the book \\"as gripping as the best murder mystery, as well researched as the best investigative journalism ‚Äì on a par with the work of a Seymour Hersh.\\" The Shock Doctrine was named one of the best books of 2007 by the Village Voice,village voice > books > The Best of 2007 Publishers Weekly,PW's Best Books of the Year ‚Äì 11/5/2007 ‚Äì Publishers Weekly The Observer, and the Seattle Times. In 2019, The Guardian ranked it the 18th greatest book since 2000. Mixed The Nobel Laureate and former Chief Economist of the World Bank Joseph Stiglitz wrote a review of The Shock Doctrine for The New York Times calling the parallel between economic shock therapy and the psychological experiments conducted by Ewen Cameron \\"overdramatic and unconvincing\\" and claiming that \\"Klein is not an academic and cannot be judged as one. There are many places in her book where she oversimplifies.\\" He also said \\"the case against these policies is even stronger than the one Klein makes\\" and that the book contains \\"a rich description of the political machinations required to force unsavory economic policies on resisting countries.\\" Shashi Tharoor in The Washington Post says that The Shock Doctrine takes Klein's criticism of capitalism an important step further. He also said Klein \\"is too ready to see conspiracies where others might discern little more than the all-too-human pattern of chaos and confusion, good intentions and greed.‚Äù Sociologists as Ulrich Beck envisioned the society of risk as a new cultural value which posed risk as a commodity to be exchanged in globalized economies. As Klein observed, this suggested that disasters and capitalist economy was inevitably entwined.Beck, U. (1992). Risk society: Towards a new modernity (Vol. 17). Sage. Some voices have praised the contributions of Klein to the study of the \\"spectacle of disasters.‚Äù Unfavourable In the London Review of Books, Stephen Holmes criticizes The Shock Doctrine as na√Øve, and opines that it conflates \\"'free market orthodoxy' with predatory corporate behaviour.\\" John Willman of the Financial Times describes it as \\"a deeply flawed work that blends together disparate phenomena to create a beguiling ‚Äì but ultimately dishonest ‚Äì argument.\\"The profits of doom ‚Äì John Willman, Financial Times, October 20, 2007 Tom Redburn in The New York Times states that \\"what she is most blind to is the necessary role of entrepreneurial capitalism in overcoming the inherent tendency of any established social system to lapse into stagnation.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs All a Grand Capitalist Conspiracy ‚Äì Tom Redburn, The New York Times, September 29, 2007 Jonathan Chait wrote in The New Republic that Klein \\"pays shockingly (but, given her premises, unsurprisingly) little attention to right-wing ideas. She recognizes that neoconservatism sits at the heart of the Iraq war project, but she does not seem to know what neoconservatism is; and she makes no effort to find out.\\" Robert Cole from The Times said, \\"Klein derides the 'disaster capitalism complex' and the profits and privatisations that go with it but she does not supply a cogently argued critique of free market principles, and without this The Shock Doctrine descends into a muddle of stories that are often worrying, sometimes interesting, and occasionally bizarre.\\"The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism by Naomi Klein, The Times, October 12, 2007. Economist Tyler Cowen, who called Klein's arguments \\"ridiculous\\" and the book a \\"true economics disaster,‚Äù says that the book contains \\"a series of fabricated claims, such as the suggestion that Margaret Thatcher created the Falkland Islands crisis to crush the unions and foist unfettered capitalism upon an unwilling British public.\\" Johan Norberg of the libertarian Cato Institute criticizes the book, saying that \\"Klein's analysis is hopelessly flawed at virtually every level.‚Äù Norberg finds fault with specifics of the analysis, such as with the Chinese government crackdown on the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. He argues that, rather than crushing opposition to pro-market reforms (as Klein would have it), the crackdown itself caused liberalization to stall for years. Klein responded on her website to both Norberg and Chait, stating that both had misrepresented her positions. Klein wrote that Norberg had erected a straw man by claiming that her book is about one man, Friedman, but that it is in fact about a \\"multifaceted ideological trend.‚Äù Norberg again responded that Klein \\"actually defends only one of her central claims that I criticized. Instead she gives the impression that I have just tried to find small mistakes here and there in her book.\\" He went on to say that the numbers Klein supplied in her reply reveal the statistics in her central argument to be \\"rubbish.\\" Awards * Winner of the Warwick Prize for Writing (2008/2009) See also * Chicago school of economics * Criticism of capitalism * Political economy * Shock therapy (economics) References External links  Articles from theguardian.com  * ; Reviews and interviews * \\"Awe, shocks!\\" ‚Äì review from Left Business Observer * Positive commentary by Arianna Huffington * News from Within Podcast: \\"Naomi Klein's The Shock Doctrine in the Israeli Context\\", an audio interview with Naomi Klein. * \\"Dead Left\\" by Jonathan Chait: A review by The New Republic * After Words interview with Klein on The Shock Doctrine, September 19, 2007 Category:2007 non-fiction books Category:Books about globalization Category:Books adapted into films Category:Books critical of capitalism Category:Canadian political books Category:Criticism of neoconservatism Category:Books by Naomi Klein ","title":"The Shock Doctrine"},{"id":"13127514","text":"Earl Dewey Kunz (December 25, 1898 - April 14, 1963 in Sacramento, California), nicknamed \\"Pinches\\", was a professional baseball pitcher who spent one season in Major League Baseball.

Advice (also called exhortation) is a form of relating personal or institutional opinions, belief systems, values, recommendations or guidance about certain situations relayed in some context to another person, group or party often offered as a guide to action and/or conduct. Put a little more simply, an advice message is a recommendation about what might be thought, said, or otherwise done to address a problem, make a decision, or manage a situation. Kinds of advice Advice is believed to be theoretical, and is often considered taboo as well as helpful. The kinds of advice can range from systems of instructional and practical toward more esoteric and spiritual, and is often attributable toward problem solving, strategy seeking, and solution finding, either from a social standpoint or a personal one. Advice may pertain to relationships, lifestyle changes, legal choices, business goals, personal goals, career goals, education goals, religious beliefs, personal growth, motivation, inspiration and so on. Advice is not pertinent to any solid criteria, and may be given freely, or only given when asked upon. In some cultures advice is socially unacceptable to be released unless requested. In other cultures advice is given more openly. It may, especially if it is expert advice such as legal advice or methodological advice also be given only in exchange for payment. Many expressions and quotations have been used to describe the status of advice, whether given, or received. One such expression is \\"Advice is what we ask for when we already know the answer but wish we didn't.\\" (Erica Jong, How to Save Your Own Life, 1977). Advice is like water, you drink it to replenish your soul. This particular quotation pertains the belief system that states that the answers to one's questions are within themselves, and do not come from any external stimuli. The accuracy of this particular belief is often disputed among theologians, philosophers, etc. However, a person who would hold such a belief, would \\"advise\\" another person to seek the answers out from within one's own esoteric and inner spiritual natures. Advice when adhered to and followed may be beneficial, non- beneficial, damaging, non-damaging, partially beneficial and partially damaging, in reference to personal or social paradigms. In other words, not all advice is either \\"all good\\" or \\"all bad\\". Many people consider unrequested advice to be paternalistic and patronizing and are thus offended. Therefore, some people may come to the conclusion that advice is morally better to be left out of the equation altogether, and this theory is included within the following quote (author unknown): \\"The best advice is this: Don't take advice and don't give advice.\\" Yet, often in society advice has been helpful. A more day to day example would be \\"eat your vegetables\\" or \\"don't drink and drive.\\" If this advice is adhered to we can see that the benefits would outweigh the consequences. Grammatically speaking, advice is an uncountable noun, like rice or milk. Clicheing or using a cliche, refers to mainstream advice that is overused.Constant, David, Lee Sproull, and Sara Kiesler. \\"The kindness of strangers: The usefulness of electronic weak ties for technical advice.\\" Organization science 7.2 (1996): 119-135. Advice-giving and advice-taking in the social sciences Background information Advice-taking and advice- giving are of interest to researchers in the disciplines of psychology, economics, judgment and decision-making, organizational behavior and human resources, and human communication, among others.Bonaccio, S., & Dalal, R. S. (2006). Advice taking and decision-making: An integrative literature review, and implications for the organizational sciences. Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 101, 127-151. In psychology, seminal articles include Brehmer and Hagafors (1986), Hollenbeck et al. (1995), and Sniezek and Buckley (1995).Brehmer, B., & Hagafors, R. (1986). The use of experts in complex decision-making: a paradigm for the study of staff work. Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 38, 181‚Äì195.Hollenbeck, J. R., Ilgen, D. R., Sego, D.

Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 62, 159‚Äì174. The Sniezek and Buckley (1995) and Hollenbeck et al. (1995) articles, in particular, introduced researchers to standardized ways of studying advice in the laboratory. The psychological literature on advice- giving and advice-taking was reviewed by Bonaccio and Dalal (2006), and a portion of this literature was also reviewed by Humphrey et al. (2002).Humphrey, S. E., Hollenbeck, J. R., Meyer, C. J., & Ilgen, D. R.(2002). Hierarchical team decision making. In G. R. Ferris & J. J. Martocchio (Eds.). Research in personnel and human resources management (Vol. 21, pp. 175‚Äì213). Stamford, CT: JAI Press. Communication researchers have tended to study advice as part of their research on supportive communication.Burleson, B. R., & MacGeorge, E. L. (2002). Supportive communication. In M. L. Knapp & J. A. Daly (Eds.), Handbook of interpersonal communication (3rd ed., pp. 374-424). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.MacGeorge, E. L., Feng, B., & Thompson, E. R. (2008). \\"Good\\" and \\"bad\\" advice: How to advise more effectively. In M. T. Motley (Ed.), Studies in applied interpersonal communication (pp. 145-164). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. Much research has focused on gender differences (and similarities) in the provision and receipt of supportive communication.MacGeorge, E. L., Graves, A. R., Feng, B., Gillihan, S. J., & Burleson, B. R. (2004). The myth of gender cultures: Similarities outweigh differences in men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs provision of and responses to supportive communication. Sex Roles, 50, 144-175. In economics, the willingness of entrepreneurs to take advice from early investors and other partners (i.e., entrepreneurial coachability) has long been considered a critical factor in entrepreneurial success. At the same time, some economists have argued that entrepreneurs should not simply act on all advice given to them, even when that advice comes from well-informed sources, because the entrepreneurs themselves possess far deeper and richer local knowledge about their own firm than any outsider. Indeed, measures of advice-taking are not actually predictive of subsequent entrepreneurial success (e.g., measured as success in subsequent funding rounds, acquisitions, pivots, and firm survival). Social science definitions of \\"advice\\" In the social sciences in general, and in psychological research in particular, advice has typically been defined as a recommendation to do something. For example, in response to a client's question regarding whether to invest in stocks, bonds, or T-notes, a financial planner (the advisor) might say: \\"I recommend going with bonds at this time.\\" However, Dalal and Bonaccio (2010) have argued, based on a review of the research literature, that such a definition is incomplete and leaves out several important types of adviceDalal, R. S., & Bonaccio, S. (2010). What types of advice do decision-makers prefer? Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 112, 11-23. These authors have provided the following taxonomy of advice: * Recommending a particular course of action (this is the usual form of advice that is studied) * Recommending against a particular course of action * Providing additional information about a particular course of action without explicitly prescribing or proscribing that course of action * Recommending how to go about making the decision (here, too, no courses of action are explicitly prescribed or proscribed) Of these four types of advice (and socio-emotional support, which is a related form of interpersonal assistance that often accompanies advice), Dalal and Bonaccio (2010) found that decision-makers reacted most favorably to the provision of information, because this form of advice not only increased decision accuracy but also allowed the decision-maker to maintain autonomy. Methodological advice Methodological advice concerns expert advice on research methodology. This kind of advice is, as opposed to some forms of advising mentioned above, usually initiated by the person who receives the advice, thus not unrequested. The goal of the advisor (see statistical consultant) is to guarantee the quality of research undertaken by his client, a researcher, by providing sound methodological advice.Ad√®r, H. J., Mellenbergh G. J., & Hand, D. J. (2008). Advising on research methods: A consultants companion. Huizen, The Netherlands: Johannes van Kessel Publishing. The advice may take different forms. In some cases the advisor collaborates with a researcher in a more long-term process, and guides him through the more technical parts of the research (this type of advising is called longitudinal consultancy). In complex, longterm projects it is not uncommon for the advisor to help by doing part of the work him or herself (interactive consultancy). In other cases a researcher may have a specific question that can be answered in a brief conversation with a consultant (cross-sectional consultancy, or advisory consulting).Van Belle, G. (2008). Statistical rules of thumb (2nd ed.). New York: Wiley: Chapter 10 (pp. 217-235). The advisors role can also take a didactic form, when the client is not familiar with suggested (statistical) methods. Sometimes the best advice is not statistically ideal, but is comprehensible for the client. Depending on the function of the methodological advisor, the advice that is given may not be free. If a student conducts research commissioned by a professor, this professor will probably help this student for free, if needed. However, if a researcher contacts an independent advisor, this probably costs him/her. In this case the methodological advisor is basically being hired by the researcher. In other cases the advisor may be incorporated into research team, leading to co-authorship. It is advisable to make clear agreements about the advisors compensation on fore hand. Researchers may seek advice on a wide range of subjects concerning their research. One of the major tasks of the methodological advisor is to help his clients think about what they really want to accomplish. This may involve helping them to formulate the research question and relatedly, the research hypothesis (see scientific hypothesis). Clients may also seek advice on the construction of a measurement instrument (for instance a psychological test). Or, they may want to know how to implement an appropriate research design. Often questions arise on how to analyze the data (see data analysis), and how to interpret and report the results (see scientific publishing). A researcher will usually know more about the field in which the study is conducted than the methodological advisor. The advisor on the other hand will know more about the method. By combining their expertise and, through dialog and cooperation, researcher and consultant may achieve better, more reliable results.Derr, J. (2008). Having an impact in a multi-disciplinary setting. In H. J. Ad√®r & G. J. Mellenbergh (Eds.), Proceedings of the 2007 KNAW colloquium Advising on research methods: pp. 11-20.

He was born in Winchester, Indiana, and was known as a tireless advocate for the local stage and theatrical scene in the many places he lived during his long career. From 1970 to 1987, he was a film and arts critic for WUSA-TV (formerly WTOP and WDVM), the CBS affiliate in Washington, DC. During much of that time, he also performed the same duties for WDIV-TV in Detroit. He was known for his eccentric on-air style in reviewing films and theatre and cultural events. One example of his style was the use of index cards when he reviewed films, and he would keep or throw away the card depending on whether he liked or hated the film. He enunciated with theatrical bravura and often wore large black-rimmed glasses and sometimes sported an Alpine hat. After John and Hazel Wentworth, founders of the Washington Theater Club, divorced in the 1960s, he and Hazel Wentworth continued the Club's operations. He directed many of its performances. He was awarded the Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee (Robert Edwin Lee) Theatre Research Margo Jones Award in 1968. Prior to his death, Marlin-Jones was a Professor of Theater and Playwriting for fifteen years at UNLV.

Built circa 1840, the stone house is one of the oldest in Wisconsin. It was once thought to be built in 1808 by early settler and fur trader Michael Brisbois, but in the early 1920s, historians learned that it was built by his son after his death. The house is a National Historic Landmark and is now owned by the Wisconsin Historical Society. Appearance The house in 1975 The Brisbois House is two-and-a-half stories tall and built from locally extracted gray limestone. The front facade has five bays, with a central entrance and two pairs of windows on either side. Fluted Doric columns flank the front entrance, and molded trim forms the rest of the doorway; the lightness of these features reflects a Federal influence. A front porch, a later addition, covers the entrance with a pediment supported by columns, which match the doorway. A gable roof with chimneys at either end tops the house. A wooden addition was placed on the south side of the house in 1905, replacing a platform which wrapped around that side. . History The Brisbois House was traditionally thought to have been built in 1808 by Michael(Michel) Brisbois, an early settler and fur trader of Prairie du Chien and one of the city's first prominent businessmen. Brisbois owned the plot of land the house is built on. In the 1950s the Wisconsin Historical Society determined that the house was built after Bisbois's death in 1833. According to the investigation, Michael's son Bernard Walter Brisbois most likely built the house for himself and his widowed mother circa 1840. While a building of the house's style and permanence would have been uncommon in the early 1800s, it fits the 1840s pattern of more elaborate homes being built for wealthy Prairie du Chien residents. It is one of the most well-crafted extant homes in the city which dates from before 1850, and it is one of the oldest standing stone houses in Wisconsin. The house was documented by the Historic American Buildings Survey in 1934, purchased by the Wisconsin Historical Society circa 1955, and designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1960.

Adams, Jr., USNR, in command. Mattabesset completed her U.S. Gulf Coast shakedown and departed for the Pacific Ocean area 14 July 1945, having filled her cargo tanks at Baytown, Texas. She arrived at Pearl Harbor a week before the end of hostilities in the Pacific and continued on to Midway Island. On 27 August, having completed delivery of diesel fuel, she sailed for Saipan, where she spent five weeks as a station tanker. She next steamed for Japan, arriving at Yokohama 24 October. For the next month she transferred gasoline from merchant tankers to shore installations. On 9 December, she began shuttling gasoline between shore installations in Japan and Korea, continuing this duty until 7 December 1946, when she got underway for San Pedro, California. Her scheduled overhaul completed in May 1947, Mattabesset sailed for Norfolk, Virginia, and duty with Service Force, Atlantic Fleet. Arriving 13 June, Mattabesset began a four-year assignment carrying petroleum products to ports along the Atlantic coast, from Greenland and Labrador to the Caribbean, and occasionally across the Atlantic to Casablanca. Mattabesset departed the U.S. East Coast for her first U.S. 6th Fleet deployment 12 September 1951. Since that time, she has served at least four months a year fueling units engaged in operations and exercises in the Mediterranean. From 1951 until 1955, she returned to the United States only for overhaul. In October 1956, Naples, Italy, became the home port from which she operated until April 1961. On several occasions, including the Lebanon crisis of July 1958, Mattabesset provided direct support for peacekeeping operations. Mattabesset was assigned a stateside home port, Norfolk, Virginia, in April 1961. Her three Mediterranean deployments between then and 1965 involved her primarily in operations with the 6th Fleet's Amphibious Force, including Operation Steel Pike of 1964, and NATO landing exercises with British, French, and Italian units. Secondary duties were to keep the advanced airbases supplied with aviation gasoline and provide support for units of the 6th Fleet, other than amphibious, whenever called upon. During July 1965, Mattabesset made a cruise to the North Sea and the Norwegian Sea; and all hands were initiated into the \\"Order of the Polar Bear\\" when the ship crossed the Arctic Circle on that cruise. She returned to the Mediterranean three more times between March 1966 and August 1968, again participating in various NATO and 6th Fleet operations. The most notable part of the last deployment was her involvement in the USS Liberty incident.  Decommissioning and fate  Mattabesset returned to her home port in August 1968. She decommissioned at Norfolk and her name was struck from the Navy list 1 October 1968. She was then transferred to the Maritime Administration on 26 June 1969 and was sold on the same day to the Peck Iron & Metal Co of Norfolk, Va for $26,863.42.https://pmars.marad.dot.gov/DisposalCard/All/6076_AF.jpg Mattabesset was scrapped a short time later.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the diocese of Chester, the archdeaconry of Chester and the deanery of Malpas. Its benefice is combined with that of St Mary, Coddington. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. History A church was present on the site at the time of the survey for the Domesday Book and it is likely that Saxon churches had previously been there. The base of the tower and the plan of the church date from the 14th century although around 1622 the historian Webb described it as \\"a fair new church\\". During the civil war the church was badly damaged. In 1643 it was being used as a barracks for the Parliamentarians under Sir William Brereton when it was attacked by Royalists. During the battle the church was set on fire. It continued to be used by the Parliamentarians until 1645 when it was abandoned and left derelict. Apart from the tower the church was completely rebuilt in 1658 by William Barnston. Further restorations were carried out in the 19th and 20th centuries. The 19th-century restoration was carried out by Kelly and Edwards, other than the southeast chapel which was by John Douglas. Architecture Exterior The church is built in red sandstone with grey slate roofs. The lower three stages of the tower date from the 14th century and the top section dates from the 17th century. The plan of the church consists of a nave with clerestory, north and south aisles, a chancel and a north porch. Protruding from the east end of the south wall are a vestry and the Barnston chapel. The tower is at the west end. Interior The furniture includes a 17th-century holy table, and a parish chest dated 1729. Three benefaction boards are dated 1672, 1786 and 1838. In the Barnston chapel is the Civil War window which depicts some of the Cheshire Royalists, among them Richard Grosvenor, Sir William Mainwaring, William Barnston and Sir Francis Gamull of Buerton. The chapel also contains wall memorials to the members of the Barnston family, including two Randle Holme memorial boards. There is a ring of eight bells, all cast in 1841 by John Taylor and Company. The parish registers begin in 1603 and the churchwardens' accounts in 1744. External features A pair of table tombs in the churchyard are listed at Grade II. They are of yellow sandstone and date from the early 18th century. On one is an image of an hourglass, on the other a skull and crossbones. A sundial in the churchyard is dated 1793.

It used to be on M. G. Road in the Bangalore Cantonment area. It was built in 1936 and mostly screened Hollywood movies. History Arcot Narrain Swamy Mudaliar was a contractor who built many buildings in Bengaluru including the Attara Kacheri (the present premises of the Karnataka High Court).Now it's curtains on Plaza theatre, Print edition of The Times of India, Bangalore edition, Page 3, dated 2005-03-11 From the money he earned out of it, he purchased a number of properties on M. G. Road including a . property over which the Plaza theatre was eventually built. His grandsons, A S Krishnamoorthy and Rajamanickam Velu wanted to construct a film theatre on this property, where they were formerly running a furniture business and went to Great Britain to understand how a great film theatre should look like. They came back and constructed Plaza theatre in the year 1936 modeling it after the Piccadilly Circus in London. The first film to be screened here was The Broadway Melody in April 1936. The theatre also had a wooden dance floor which was used by British soldiers for ball dancing. Initial ticket prices ranged from eight annas for the front seats to 1 rupee and 12 annas for the balcony's highest seat, called The Dress Circle. The theatre also had a bar which served drinks to patrons who came to watch movies. Movies Movies that have been screened here include Hans Christian Andersen, The Court Jester, Artists and Models and The Ten Commandments. The latter ran for 44 straight weeks making it the longest running movie in the theatre. Loads of school children were brought to the theatre to watch this movie and a special personal screening of the movie was arranged in the year 1959 for the Maharaja of Mysore, Jayachamarajendra Wodeyar and his entourage. Initially, the theatre was associated with MGM Studios screening movies like Gone with the Wind before moving on to Paramount pictures to screen movies like Roman Holiday, An Officer and a Gentleman and the James Bond movies. Closure View from projection room on closing dayThe last film that was screened here was Meet the Fockers on 17 March 2005. The Narrain family sold the theatre since their children, all professionals,did not wish to carry on the family business. A mining investor from Bellary purchased this property and wanted to build a shopping mall in its place. However, the Bangalore City Corporation refused permission to build a shopping mall. The land has since been acquired for the Bangalore Metro project and will house the Plaza theatre station on the East-West Corridor route.

He is the founder of the troupe, Idagunji Mahaganapathi Yakshagana Mandali which has given performances all over India and abroad. He is the first Yakshagana artist to receive the Rashtrapati Award (President's Award). He was given the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award for 1970.List of Sangeet Natak Akademi awardees He was born in a remote place called \\"Keremane\\" of Gunavante, in the Honnavar Taluk of Uttara Kannada District. Owing to the difficult times he fully embraced the art, grew with it and helped to flourish. Late Annuhittalu Sadananda Hegde and the Yakshaganic aura in the locality induced the intricacies of the art form into him.  Foundation of the Yakshagana Troupe - Sri Idagunji Mahaganapati Yakshagana Mandali, Keremane (R)  In 1934,though there was severe financial crisis in his family, he founded ‚ÄúSri Idagunji Mahaganapati Yakshagana Mandali Keremane‚Äù out of the money that he had saved from doing other works. The Troupe was named after the family deity Lord Ganapati of Idagunji in whom he had a strong devotion. His passion towards the art and the establishment of a troupe of like minded people contributed a lot to the development of Yakshagana.  Contributions  His contributions include search and encouragement of best talents, performing of traditional episodes, a very effective and multidimensional depiction of a character of the Prasanga(the ‚Äòact‚Äô) and extension of Yakshagana to wider geographical area. He was famous for the wits in his dialogues and also for slow and vivid revealing of the character in a Prasanga('Act' or story) which is scarce in now a day performances. It is significant to note that he had also used Yakshagana as a medium in the propagation of India‚Äôs freedom movement. The Yakshagana Mandali, founded by him, has proved its dynamic existence, by giving performances in various parts of the state, country and abroad. His life and contributions became a subject of research in Yakshagana. Beside stage direction and delineation of characters, Keremane Shivarama Hegde had showed his skills in organisational abilities too. When he realised that the Yakshagana art will not survive solely on the support of the temple precincts, he established the idea of a professional troupe to promote the Yakshagana. He was awarded by Central Sangeeth Nataka Academi, New Delhi (1970) and Karnataka State Award (1965) for his outstanding achievements in Yakshagana. He had to sacrifice lots of things and saw ups and downs in life at the cost of his passion, his organisation and his cultural journey.His life is an inspiration behind journey of our Institution.

Jonathan shooting three arrows to warn David Jonathan (Hebrew: Y…ôh≈çnƒÅ·πØƒÅn or Yonatan) is a heroic figure in 1 Samuel in the Hebrew Bible. A prince of the United Kingdom of Israel, he was the eldest son of King Saul as well as a close friend of David, who eventually succeeded Saul as king. Like his father, he was a man of great strength and swiftness (2 Samuel 1:23), and he excelled in archery (, 2 Samuel 1:22) and slinging (1 Chronicles 12:2). Conflicts with Saul Jonathan first appears in the biblical narrative as the victor of Geba, a Philistine stronghold (1 Samuel 13), while in the following chapter he carries out a lone and secret attack on another Philistine garrison, demonstrating his \\"prowess and courage as a warrior.\\"T. H. Jones, \\"Jonathan,\\" in J. D. Douglas, (ed.), New Bible Dictionary (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1965), 654. However, he eats honey without knowing that his father had said, \\"Cursed be any man who eats food before evening comes\\" (1 Samuel 14:24). When he learns of his father's oath, Jonathan disagrees with the wisdom of it, as it requires the soldiers to pursue the enemy although weak from fasting.Bar, Shaul. \\"Saul and Jonathan\\". Jewish Bible Quarterly, Vol. 47, No. 2, 2019, p. 95 Saul decides to put Jonathan to death for breaking the ban, but relents when the soldiers protest (). The story of David and Jonathan is introduced in chapter 18, where it says that \\"Jonathan became one in spirit with David, and he loved him as himself\\" (verse 1). The feeling is expressed before the men exchanged a single word, and some scholars have proposed that what Jonathan felt can be described love at first sight, provoked perhaps by David's beauty. Jonathan helps David escape from Saul, and asks him to show kindness to his family (1 Samuel 20:14‚Äì15); biblical scholar Joyce Baldwin suggests that this indicates that Jonathan recognised David as the future king.Baldwin, J., 1 and 2 Samuel (TOCT; Leicester: Inter-Varsity Press, 1988), p. 135. Saul suspects that Jonathan is colluding with David, who he believes is conspiring to overthrow him. Saul insults Jonathan calling him the \\"...son of a perverse and rebellious woman!\\" in 1 Samuel 20:30. While this is an \\"idiom of insult directed at Jonathan\\",David Toshio Tsumura, The First Book of Samuel (NICOT; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2007), 520. some scholars see in this verse support for the theory that Ahinoam, the wife of Saul was also the wife of David. Jon Levenson and Baruch Halpern suggest that the phrase \\"to the shame of your mother's nakedness\\" suggests \\"David's theft of Saul's wife\\",Jon D. Levenson and Baruch Halpern, \\"The Political Import of David's Marriages\\", JBL 99 [1980] 515. but such an event is never described in the Bible and one Bible scholar, Diana V. Edelman, has ruled it as unlikely.Edelman, Diana. \\"Ahinoam (Person)\\", The Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary. (David Noel Freedman. ed.) New York: Doubleday, 1992, 1:118: ‚ÄúSuch a presumption would require David to have run off with the queen mother while Saul was still on the throne, which seems unlikely. In view of the possession of the royal harem as a claim to royal legitimacy, Nathan‚Äôs comment can be related to David‚Äôs eventual possession of Saul‚Äôs wives after he ascended the throne in the wake of Eshbaal‚Äôs death...‚Äù Saul even goes so far as to attempt to kill Jonathan by throwing a javelin at him during a fit of paranoid rage. But, before this event happened all Jonathan did was ask his father what did David do to him so that he would be put to death? (1 Sam. 20:32-33), which suggests David had never wronged Saul. The last meeting between Jonathan and David would take place in a forest of Ziph at Horesh, during Saul's pursuit of David. There, the two would make a covenant before the Lord before going their separate ways (1 Samuel 23:15 ‚Äì 18). Death \\"David and Jonathan,\\" by Rembrandt. Jonathan is the figure in the turban.Hermitage News Jonathan died at the battle of Mount Gilboa along with his father and brothers() (1 Samuel 31). His bones were buried first at Jabesh-gilead, (1 Samuel 31:13) but were later removed with those of his father and moved to Zelah. G.

Jonathan was the father of Mephibosheth, to whom David showed special kindness for Jonathan's sake (2 Samuel 9), which memorably included describing the love between the two men as superior to the love that David experienced from women.

It operates by taking the output of two LFSRs through an adder with carry. The operation's strength is that it is nonlinear. However, through the early 1990s various attacks against the summation generator eventually led to its fall to a correlation attack. In 1995 Klapper and Goresky were able to determine the summation generator's sequence in only 219 bits. An improved summation generator with 2-bit memory was then proposed by cryptographers Lee and Moon. In the new generator scheme an extra bit of memory is added to the nonlinear combining function. The objective in the modification was to make the summation generator immune to correlation attack. An attack against the improved summation generator was reported by Mex-Perera and Shepherd in 2002 by exploiting linear relations. Besides, in June 2005 an algebraic attack was developed. Using this attack a PC can calculate the initial state of the summation generator within 3 minutes even with 256 bit LFSRs. References * R. A.

The highway serves as the southern end for Interstate 27 on the south side of the city. The highway passes about a mile south of Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport on the north side near the intersection with I-27. History Lubbock is among the smallest U.S. cities to be encircled by a beltway or loop highway. Loop 289 is a grade-separated controlled-access freeway. Built from 1960 to 1972, it is 26 miles (42 kilometers) long. When first constructed, Loop 289 passed through entirely rural areas. Today, urban sprawl extends beyond the beltway, especially in southwestern Lubbock. Loop 289 was designated on September 20, 1955. I-27, completed through Lubbock in 1992, serves as the city's north-south freeway. In 2004, construction began on the Marsha Sharp Freeway, the east-west freeway. Cosigned as US 62 / US 82 at its interchange with the East Leg of Loop 289, the Marsha Sharp Freeway begins northeast of Downtown Lubbock and extends to a mile west of the West Leg of Loop 289. From there, it is under construction and is to be extended west to the nearby suburb of Wolfforth. Lane configuration Loop 289 is a complete loop freeway with four to six mainline lanes. The freeways have frontage roads for nearly the entire route. It is one of only three complete controlled- access loops in Texas, the other two being Interstate 610 and Beltway 8 (Sam Houston Parkway, and Sam Houston Tollway), both of which encircle Houston. At certain junctions, the freeway widens using auxiliary (exit only) lanes. At most interchanges with other highways, there are partial to full access ramps, that directly serve the mainline lanes and/or frontage roads.

El Peri√≥dico (Guatemala) (in Spanish) is a Guatemalan politician and retired military officer, who was President of Guatemala from 2012 to 2015. Standing as the Patriotic Party (Partido Patriota) candidate, he lost the 2007 presidential election but prevailed in the 2011 presidential election. During the 1990s, before entering politics, he served as Director of Military Intelligence, Presidential Chief of Staff under President Ramiro de Le√≥n Carpio, and as chief representative of the military for the Guatemalan Peace Accords. On being elected President, he called for the legalization of drugs. On 2 September 2015, beset by corruption allegations and having been stripped of his immunity by Congress the day earlier, P√©rez presented his resignation. He was arrested on 3 September 2015. Perez has remained in custody since his 2015 arrest.https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-41786239 Military career P√©rez is a graduate of Guatemala's National Military Academy (Escuela Polit√©cnica),. partidopatriota.com.gt the School of the Americas and of the Inter-American Defense College. He has served as Guatemala's Director of Military Intelligence and as inspector-general of the army. In 1983 he was a member of the group of army officers who backed Defence Minister √ìscar Mej√≠a's coup d'√©tat against de facto president Efra√≠n R√≠os Montt. While serving as chief of military intelligence in 1993, he was instrumental in forcing the departure of President Jorge Serrano. The president had attempted a \\"self- coup\\" by dissolving Congress and appointing new members to the Supreme Court (Corte Suprema de Justicia). (See 1993 Guatemalan constitutional crisis.) In the wake of that event, Guatemala's human rights ombudsman, Ramiro de Le√≥n Carpio, succeeded as president, according to the constitution. He appointed P√©rez as his presidential chief of staff, a position he held until 1995. Considered a leader of the Guatemalan Army faction that favored a negotiated resolution of the 30-year-long Guatemalan Civil War,CERIGUA Weekly Briefs, Feb. 21, 1994 P√©rez represented the military in the negotiations with guerrilla forces. They achieved the 1996 Peace Accords. Between 1998 and 2000, P√©rez represented Guatemala on the Inter-American Defense Board. Political career In February 2001, he founded the Patriotic Party. In the general election of 9 November 2003, P√©rez was elected to Congress. He was the candidate of the Patriotic Party in the 2007 presidential election, campaigning under the slogan \\"Mano dura, cabeza y coraz√≥n\\" (\\"Firm hand, head and heart\\"), advocating a hard-line approach to rising crime in the country. After receiving the second-largest number of votes in the initial contest on 9 September, he lost the election to √Ålvaro Colom of the National Unity of Hope in the second round on 4 November 2007. During the 2007 presidential campaign, several members of the Patriotic Party were killed by armed assailants. Victims included Aura Marina Salazar Cutzal, an indigenous woman who was secretary to the party's congressional delegation and an assistant to P√©rez.Matan a secretaria de P√©rez Molina y a guardia de la SAAS elPeri√≥dico de Guatemala .

Presidency P√©rez was finally elected in the November 2011 presidential election with 54% of the vote, and took office on 14 January 2012. P√©rez was the first former military official to be elected to the presidency since Guatemala's return to democratic elections in 1986. He proposed the legalisation of drugs when he first became president while attending the United Nations General Assembly, as he said that the War on Drugs has proven to be a failure. Corruption charges and arrest In April 2015, international prosecutors, with help from the UN, presented evidence of a customs corruption ring (\\"La L√≠nea\\") in which discounted tariffs were exchanged for bribes from importers; prosecutors learned of the ring through wiretaps and financial statements. Vice President Roxana Baldetti resigned on 8 May, and was arrested for her involvement on 21 August. On 21 August, Guatemalan prosecutors presented evidence of P√©rez's involvement in the corruption ring. Congress, in a 132‚Äì0 vote, stripped P√©rez Molina of prosecutorial immunity on 1 September 2015, and, on 2 September, he presented his resignation from the Presidency. On 3 September, after a court hearing in which charges and evidence against him were presented, he was arrested and sent to the Matamoros prison in Guatemala City. Vice President Alejandro Maldonado Aguirre was appointed to serve the remainder of P√©rez's 4-year term in office (due to end on 14 January 2016). On 27 October 2017,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/guatemala-judge-orders- president-corruption-50773667 Judge Miguel √Ångel G√°lvez of Guatemala City ordered Perez, Baldetti, and another 26 people, including former senior officials from Guatemala's customs duty system, were ordered to stand trial on charges related to bribes channeled to officials helping businesses evade customs duties and Perez has remained in custody since his 2015 arrest. Accusations of human rights abuses Civil war atrocities In 2011 reports were made, based on United States' National Security Archives, that P√©rez was involved in the scorched earth campaigns of the 1980s under the military dictator Efra√≠n R√≠os Montt. P√©rez commanded a counterinsurgency team in the Ixil Community in 1982-3 and is accused of ordering the mass murder of civilians, destruction of villages and resettlement of the remaining population in army-controlled areas. Investigative journalist Allan Nairn interviewed P√©rez Molina in Ixil in 1982, and reported that P√©rez Molina had been involved in the torture and murder of four suspected guerrillas. In July 2011, the indigenous organization Waqib Kej presented a letter to the United Nations accusing P√©rez of involvement in genocide and torture committed in Quich√© during the civil war. Among other evidence, they cited a 1982 documentary in which a military officer whom they claim is P√©rez is seen near four dead bodies. In the following scene, a subordinate says that those four were captured alive and taken \\"to the Major\\" (allegedly P√©rez) and that \\"they wouldn't talk, not when we asked nicely and not when we were mean [ni por las buenas ni por las malas].\\" Although it is clear that P√©rez Molina actively participated in a particularly dirty counterinsurgency campaign, he has denied any involvement in atrocities. Declassified US documents present him as one of the more progressive Guatemalan military officers, who had a hand in the downfall of General R√≠os Montt. Allegations of involvement in the killing of Efra√≠n B√°maca In 1992, the guerrilla leader Efra√≠n B√°maca Vel√°squez disappeared. His wife, American lawyer Jennifer Harbury, has presented evidence that P√©rez, who was Director of Military Intelligence at the time, probably issued the orders to detain and torture the commandante. In 2011, he became the subject of a new investigation into the disappearance of B√°maca. Allegations of involvement in the murder of Catholic bishop Gerardi In his book The Art of Political Murder: Who Killed the Bishop?, American journalist Francisco Goldman argues that P√©rez Molina may have been present, along with two other high officials, a few blocks from the April 1998 murder of Juan Jos√© Gerardi Conedera, a Roman Catholic bishop. Prosecutors in the subsequent trial said that P√©rez and the other two men were there to supervise the assassination. Gerardi was murdered two days after the release of a human rights report he helped prepare for the United Nations' Historical Clarification Commission. Personal life P√©rez is married to Rosa Mar√≠a Leal. On 21 February 2000, shortly before P√©rez planned to launch his new political party, his daughter Lissette was attacked by a gunman. The same day, a woman named Patricia Castellanos Fuentes de Aguilar was shot and killed after meeting with P√©rez's wife, Rosa Mar√≠a Leal. On 11 November 2000, P√©rez's son, Otto P√©rez Leal, was attacked while driving; P√©rez Leal's wife and infant daughter were also in the vehicle. Human rights groups said that the attacks were politically motivated.U.S. Department of State, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, 4 March 2002 Guatemala. State.gov (4 March 2002).

US-60E goes up the Canyon (right), and the Resolution exploration shaft and facilities are at the canyon's south rim, at right center (white). Oak Flat campground is beyond the Resolution facilities. Resolution Copper (RCM) is a joint venture owned by Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton formed to develop and operate an underground copper mine near Superior, Arizona, U.S. The project targets a deep-seated porphyry copper deposit located under the now inactive Magma Mine. Rio Tinto has reported an inferred resource of 1.624 billion tonnes containing 1.47 percent copper and 0.037 percent molybdenum at depths exceeding . The proposed mine is one of the largest copper resources in North America. Following the passage of the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act, many Native American and conservation groups fear the copper mine will destroy sacred and environmentally sensitive land. Overview Resolution Copper estimates the $64 billion mining project would run over 60 years. Investment Through 2012 Resolution Copper had invested almost a billion dollars in the Superior project, and planned a $6 billion investment to develop the mine, if the Federal land exchange is approved. Pending approval, the project budget was cut from about $200 million in 2012 to $50 million in 2013.Resolution Copper Mining \\"Letter to the community\\", November 30, 2012 Resolution Copper also owns the mineral rights acquired from ASARCO to the Superior East deposit which is another deep seated porphyry deposit within a mile to the east.BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT lead file AMC60069Sell, James D. \\"Porphyry Copper Deposits of the American Cordillera\\". \\"Arizona Geological Society Digest 20\\" 1995. p.373-395.

In an undated report, the company splits subsidence into three categories collectively called \\"surface impact zones\\". These are intact zone, fracture zone and cave zone. The cave zone would be 1 miles long and over 850 feet deep. The company has been exploring solutions for the 1.599 billion tonnes or 19.9 billion cubic feet tailings which will be produced. One possibility is using existing mined out open pits as tailing deposits, a brownfield known as the Pinto Valley mine in Gila County, Arizona or a greenfield site on 12 sections of land on the far northern end of what's known as Superstition Vistas.Resolution Copper Resolution Copper: FAQs undated, retrieved 17 September 2015 The company hopes to have the new mine in production by 2020.Resolution Copper Mining LLC reports an Inferred Resource, 29 May 2008 news release The proposed mine might be capable of producing 25 percent of projected future US copper demand for several decades.

Resolution Copper has proposed to give the federal government of environmentally sensitive land in Arizona in exchange for the proposed mine site, which includes the popular Oak Flat Campground, a protected area since 1955.LAND SWAP THREATENS OUR PUBLIC LANDS, OAK FLAT CAMPGROUND ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK, Arizona Sierra Club In May 2009, Arizona Democratic representative Ann Kirkpatrick introduced legislation in Congress to complete the land swap. The swap then had the support of Arizona's two Republican senators.Kelly, Erin, and Dan Nowicki, Arizona Republic (21 May 2009): Bill revives land swap for Arizona copper mine, accessed 29 May 2009. The swap also has had considerable opposition and may have cost Ann Kirkpatrick her congressional seat in her 2010 loss to Paul Gosar; however, she regained the seat in 2012 and won again in 2014. In 2013, the proposed land swap was readdressed when Rep. Paul A. Gosar (R, AZ-4) introduced the Southeast Arizona Land Exchange and Conservation Act of 2013 (H.R. 687; 113th Congress). The bill provided that the Apache Leap Cliffs, which rise prominently just east of the town of Superior, remain in federal ownership, and directed the Secretary of the Interior to manage Apache Leap so as to preserve its natural character. The bill required Resolution Copper to surrender any mining rights it has over the Apache Leap cliffs, and deeding 110 acres of private land in the area of cliffs to the federal government.US Congress, Senate Bill 339 20 Nov, 2013. In December 2014, the United States Congress passed, and President Obama signed the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act, which included the provisions of the stalled Southeast Arizona Land Exchange and Conservation Act. The Act cleared the way for the land swap in which Resolution would receive 2,422 acres of National Forest land in exchange for deeding to the federal government 5,344 acres of private land.Arizona Geology, \\"Resolution copper land swap bill signed into law,\\" 23 Dec. 2014. The mine would destroy an area set aside in 1955 by President Dwight D. Eisenhower which is sacred to the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation. Both the Oak Flat Campground, an area dotted with petroglyphs and historic and prehistoric sites, and the steep cliffs at Apache Leap would be affected. In July 2015, a march protesting the land swap arrived in Washington DC. Native American and environmental groups respond The San Carlos Apache Tribe, the National Audubon Society in Tucson, the Grand Canyon Chapter of the Sierra Club as well as the National Congress of American Indians have joined in the fight against the Resolution Copper land swap. Native American groups and conservationists worry about the impact to surrounding areas and have led a strong opposition to the land exchange. James Anaya, former United Nations special rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples, said that without community and tribal support, Rio Tinto should abandon its Resolution Copper mining project. In 2014, Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell said she was \\"profoundly disappointed with the Resolution Copper land-swap provision, which has no regard for lands considered sacred by nearby Indian tribes\\". By January 2015, 104,646 people had signed the petition, \\"We the People|Stop Apache Land Grab\\". Jodi Gillette, Special Assistant to the President for Native American Affairs, quickly gave an official White House response, vowing that the Obama Administration will work with Resolution Copper's parent company Rio Tinto to determine how to work with the tribes to preserve their sacred areas. In response, Resolution Copper has pledged its commitment to respectful cooperation with the Tribes. The Company has funded a new Tribal Monitor Training hosted by the US Forest Service, a program designed to train and employ tribal members in survey work identifying and recording traditional cultural locations alongside archaeologists.Protecting cultural heritage at Resolution Copper.

History The railway station was opened on 31 May 1847 but in a remote location, and was little used. The western platform was accessed by a pathway down from Ringley Road, the east platform was accessed by a subway at the southern end of the station. In 1879 the railway station was the location of the apparent suicide of a collier who had been in the custody of a police officer for assaulting his wife. The collier had jumped in front of an approaching train and was crushed to death, almost dragging the officer along with him. A later inquest in Salford returned an open verdict. The railway station closed on 5 January 1953. The railway station now forms part of the route of the Irwell Sculpture Trail.

He is best known as the founder and leader of the electronic music group Earthstar during the 1970s and 1980s. Earthstar was only American band who participated in Germany's Kosmische Musik/electronic music scene while still at its height. Early career Wuest is originally from Utica, New York. According to former Earthstar guitarist Dennis Rea in the early 1970s Wuest was among the first musicians in Utica who owned a synthesizer. Wuest was heavily influenced by the German electronic music scene of the 1970s, including Klaus Schulze, Popol Vuh, Harmonia, Tangerine Dream, and Kraftwerk. Around the same time Rea had founded what he describes as an \\"eccentric progressive rock band,\\" Zuir. According to Rea, \\"...being the only two adventurous music acts in town, collaboration between Craig and the members of Zuir was inevitable.\\" Earthstar was born out of the partnership of Wuest, Rea, and other Utica-area musicians. In 1977 Earthstar was signed by Nashville- based Moontower Records, who released the group's first album, Salterbarty Tales, the following year. Earthstar in Germany Craig Wuest was an admirer of electronic music pioneer Klaus Schulze, with whom he struck up a correspondence. Schulze encouraged Wuest and Earthstar to come to Germany, intending to sign them to his Innovative Communications record label. Wuest sold his grand piano, which had played a prominent part on Salterbarty Tales, to finance the move. Other Earthstar musicians joined Wuest in Germany to work on French Skyline, the group's second album, While much of French Skyline was recorded at Klaus Schulze studios in Hamb√ºhren, West Germany, Schulze's label never signed Earthstar. The group was instead signed by Hamburg-based Sky Records. The group recorded four albums primarily in Germany and France for Sky: French Skyline (1989), Atomkraft? Nein, Danke! (1981), Humans Only (1982), and Sleeper, the Nightlifer, which was never released. The New Gibraltar Encyclopedia of Progressive Rock credits Wuest as being the mastermind behind Earthstar's sound and comments on French Skyline and Atomkraft? Nein, Danke!: \\"Wuest's vision propels these two albums, his desire apparently is to create music that doesn't necessarily suggest a particular instrument, rather creates a new texture.\\" Wuest co-produced French Skyline with Klaus Schulze and served as producer for the other Earthstar albums recorded during this period. Wuest is also notable for his heavy use of the mellotron and the Birotron, a very rare tape loop instrument which could sustain notes beyond eight seconds. Wuest was the only keyboardist at the time other than Rick Wakeman who recorded albums on which he played the Birotron. Later works After returning to the United States Wuest continued to compose, play, and record electronic music. A now defunct earthstarmusic.com Web site listed later releases; one in particular, Axiom, which was listed as following Humans Only, had clearly been recorded and MP3 samples of the music were included on the Web site. They revealed a conventional, melodic, controlled electronic music sound. It is likely that by this point Earthstar had become Wuest's solo project. However, no record of the release of Axiom or any other later works can be found. Discography In Earthstar *1978 Salterbarty Tales (studio album) *1979 French Skyline (studio album) *1981 Atomkraft?

It is used for Humboldt State Lumberjacks football games and track and field meets, as well as local high school contests. Construction began in the late 1930s as part of a Work Projects Administration grant. The first game in Redwood Bowl was played on Sunday, October 8, 1946, with the Stanford University JV defeating Humboldt State, 20‚Äì0. Two weeks later, when Stanford's varsity played its first game of the season against UCLA, eight of the \\"JV\\" starters against the Lumberjacks were varsity starters. Stanford had been secured for the dedication game in Redwood Bowl to ensure a large crowd. Complaints from merchants whose Saturday afternoon trade was being drawn away by football games encouraged administrators to begin a campaign geared toward funding lights for Redwood Bowl. In the spring of 1947, lights were purchased from a firm in Iowa for $2,000, with another $1,000 for switches and wiring. Alumnus Bunny Hadley donated the labor to wire the field, and poles were donated by a local lumber operator. Payment for the remainder of the work, including leasing a crane and operator, was through a $4,000 loan secured through Bank of America and paid off out of student fees over the next several years. The bowl‚Äôs turf was resurfaced during the summer of 2011, and the track was resurfaced during the summer of 2017. According to HSU Facilities Management, Redwood Bowl is the most heavily-used field on campus, employed by recreational sports programs, including intramurals, kinesiology and other department classes, football and track and field team practices and games, commencement, special events and general student use. The track in Redwood Bowl is 6 lanes on the curves and 9 lanes on the west side straight. The track and field facility inside the bowl includes an all-weather long jump/ triple jump runway and sand pit, with takeoff boards at 8‚Äô, 24‚Äô, 36‚Äô, and 40‚Äô, a high jump apron and landing pad, and a pole vault runway and landing pad. Adjacent to west side of the Redwood Bowl and HSU softball field are the track and field throwing facilities, which feature a 40 meter all-surface javelin runway, a shot put ring, and caged hammer and discus rings. Redwood Bowl has a max seating capacity of 8,000 people. References * William R. Tanner, PhD. A View from the Hill: A History of Humboldt State University.

The stadium with twelve 70 metre high masts and a capacity of just over 55,000 has become a landmark on the Manchester skyline. The stadium is leased to the football club.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester- city/8257210/How-Manchester-City-won-the-stadium-lottery.html The stadium lease was renegotiated in October 2010 and Manchester City will pay Manchester City Council ¬£3 million a year rather than paying half the revenue over 35,000 ticket sales which amounted to approximately ¬£2 million. The club plans to increase the stadium's capacity to 60,000 by adding a third tier to the north and south stands. National Cycling Centre The National Cycling Centre is a multipurpose cycling venue including the Manchester Velodrome, National Indoor BMX Arena, and mountain bike trials. Manchester Velodrome Manchester Velodrome Manchester Velodrome was built for Manchester Olympic bids in the 1990s and used for the 2002 Commonwealth Games. The velodrome had a lasting legacy and in the Beijing Olympics in 2008, the British cycling team‚Äîbased at the velodrome‚Äîdominated the cycling events. The track has garnered a reputation for speed and by 30 March 2008, more than 15 world records had been set there, including Chris Boardman's 1996 and 2000 hour records and the 4000 metre team pursuit record set by the Great Britain men's team at the 2008 World Championships. National BMX Arena British Cycling and Manchester City Council, in partnership with New East Manchester worked together to deliver the National Indoor BMX Centre which opened in 2011. It was designed by Ellis Williams Architects, and built by contractors Sir Robert McAlpine. Alongside the velodrome, the ¬£24 million complex will form the National Cycling Centre. It has 2,000 seats, a BMX area and offices for the headquarters of the British Cycling Federation.

During the War of the Spanish Succession the most historic achievement of the Marines was the capture of the mole during the assault on Gibraltar (sailors of the Royal Navy captured the Rock itself) in 1704. On 5 April 1755, His Majesty's Marine Forces, fifty Companies in three Divisions, headquartered at Portsmouth, Chatham and Plymouth, were formed by Order of Council under Admiralty control. The Royal Marine Artillery was formed as an establishment within the British Royal Marines in 1804 to man the artillery in bomb vessels. As their coats were the blue of the Royal Regiment of Artillery, this group was nicknamed the \\"Blue Marines\\" and the Infantry element, who wore the scarlet coats of the British infantry, became known as the \\"Red Marines\\". During the Napoleonic Wars the Royal Marines participated in every notable naval battle on board the Royal Navy's ships and also took part in multiple amphibious actions. Marines had a dual function aboard ships of the Royal Navy; routinely, they ensured the security of the ship's officers and supported their maintenance of discipline in the ship's crew, and in battle, they engaged the enemy's crews, whether firing from positions on their own ship, or fighting in boarding actions. During the First World War, in addition to their usual stations aboard ship, Royal Marines were part of the Royal Naval Division which landed in Belgium in 1914 to help defend Antwerp and later took part in the amphibious landing at Gallipoli in 1915. The Royal Marines also took part in the Zeebrugge Raid in 1918. During the Second World War the Infantry Battalions of the Royal Marine Division were re-organised as Commandos, joining the British Army Commandos. The Division command structure became a Special Service Brigade command. The support troops became landing craft crew and saw extensive action on D-Day in June 1944. The Falklands War provided the backdrop to the next action of the Royal Marines. Argentina invaded the islands in April 1982. A British task force was immediately despatched to recapture them, and given that an amphibious assault would be necessary, the Royal Marines were heavily involved. The troops were landed at San Carlos Water at the western end of East Falkland, and proceeded to \\"yomp\\" across the entire island to the capital, Stanley, which fell on 14 June 1982. Origin The 'first official' unit of English naval infantry, originally called the Duke of York and Albany's Maritime Regiment of Foot and soon becoming known as the Admiral's Regiment, was formed on 28 October 1664, with an initial strength of 1,200 infantrymen recruited from the Trained Bands of London as part of the mobilisation for the Second Anglo-Dutch War. James (later King James VII & II), the Duke of York and Albany, Lord High Admiral and brother of King Charles II, was Captain-General of the Artillery Company, now the Honourable Artillery Company, the unit that trained the Trained Bands. It was the fifth European Marine unit formed, being preceded by the Spain's Infanter√≠a de Marina (1537), the Fanti da Mar of the Republic of Venice (1550), the Portuguese Marine Corps (1610) and France's Troupes de marine (1622). It consisted of six 200-man companies and was initially commanded by Colonel Sir William Killigrew with Sir Charles Lyttleton as lieutenant- colonel. Killigrew had commanded an English regiment in Dutch service, and many of the regiment's initial complement of officers had served there as well. The Holland Regiment (later The Buffs) was also raised to serve at sea and both of these \\"Naval\\" regiments were paid for by the Treasurer of the Navy by Order of Council of 11 July 1665. John Churchill, later the 1st Duke of Marlborough, was a famous member of this regiment. A Company of Foot Guards served as Marines to augment the Marines of the Admiral's Regiment during the key sea battle the Battle of Solebay in 1672. The regiment was disbanded in 1689 shortly after James II was deposed in the Glorious Revolution. Portrait of a Maritime officer, by William Dobson, 17th century Lawrence Washington Two marine regiments of the army were raised in 1690. They were the Earl of Pembroke's and Torrington's, later Lord Berkeley's. These two regiments participated in an opposed landing during the Williamite War in Ireland at Cork, Ireland on 21 September 1690 under the command of John Churchill, later Duke of Marlborough.Lenihan, p. 184 In 1698, the Marine establishment was reformed: the two existing regiments were reformed into a single one under the command of Thomas Brudenell, while the foot regiments of William Seymour, Edward Dutton Colt, and Harry Mordaunt were converted into Marine regiments.Edye, p. 521‚Äì522 These regiments were disbanded in 1699.Edye, p. 577-578 In 1702, six Regiments of Marines and six Sea Service Regiments of Foot were formed for the War of the Spanish Succession. When on land, the Marines were commanded by Brigadier-General Seymour, also Colonel of the 4th Foot. Their most significant achievement was the capture of the mole during the assault on Gibraltar (sailors of the Royal Navy captured the Rock itself) and the subsequent defence of the fortress alongside the Dutch Marines in 1704.Francis, p. 110 After the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, three of these were redesignated as line infantry, becoming the 30th, 31st and 32nd Foot. Eighteenth Century Six Marine Regiments (1st to 6th Marines, 44th to 49th Foot) were raised on 17‚Äì22 November 1739 for the War of Jenkins' Ear, with four more being raised later. One large Marine Regiment (Spotswood's Regiment, later Gooch's American Regiment) was formed of American colonists and served alongside British Marines at the Battle of Cartagena de Indias, Colombia and Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba in the War of Jenkins' Ear (1741). Among its officers was Lawrence Washington, the half-brother of George Washington.Chartrand, pp. 18‚Äì19 In 1747, the remaining regiments were transferred to the Admiralty and then disbanded in 1748. Many of the disbanded men were offered transportation to Nova Scotia and helped form the city of Halifax, Nova Scotia.Akins, p. 7 On 5 April 1755, His Majesty's Marine Forces, fifty Companies in three Divisions, headquartered at Portsmouth, Chatham and Plymouth, were formed by Order of Council under Admiralty control. Initially, all field officers were Royal Navy officers as the Royal Navy felt that the ranks of Marine field officers were largely honorary. This meant that the farthest a Marine officer could advance was to lieutenant colonel. It was not until 1771 that the first Marine was promoted to colonel. This situation persisted well into the 1800s. During the rest of the 18th century, they served in numerous landings all over the world, the most famous being the landing at Bellisle on the Brittany coast in 1761. They also served in the American War of Independence. A company of Marines under the command of Major John Pitcairn broke the rebel resistance in the Battle of Bunker Hill and took possession of the enemy redoubt. These Marines also often took to the ship's boats to repel attackers in small boats when RN ships were becalmed on close blockade. Captain James Cook took with him four marines on the day he was killed in Hawaii, 14 February 1779, Corporal James Thomas, Private Theophilus Hinks, Private Thomas Fatchett and Private John Allen. New South Wales From May 1787, a detachment of four companies of marines, under Major Robert Ross, accompanied the First Fleet to protect a new colony at Botany Bay (New South Wales). Due to an administrative error the Fleet left Portsmouth without its main supply of ammunition, cartridge paper and tools to repair their flintlocks. The omission was noted early during the voyage and, in July 1787, a request was sent back to the British Home Office from Santa Cruz that the missing supplies be sent out in William Bligh's ship HMS Bounty. Ten thousand rounds of ammunition were also obtained when the Fleet called into Rio de Janeiro en route to Botany Bay.Moore, p. 41 However, despite the Home Office receiving the request, the full resupply was never sent and consequently, after 12 months, the marines ended up in difficult circumstances. The First Fleet detachment had a strength of 212 including 160 privates. This relatively small force was arranged on the advice of Joseph Banks who advised the British government that local Aborigines were few and retiring. On arrival in New South Wales in January 1788 the Governor of the new colony, naval Captain Arthur Phillip, found that the natives were vastly more numerous than expected and also that they soon started resisting the settlers. Within 12 months, natives killed 5 or 6 First Fleeters and wounded others. Finally, in October 1788, the marines were tasked to expand the initial settlement at Sydney Cove to commence farming more fertile land at Parramatta. One author has claimed that the Marines deliberately spread smallpox among Australia's indigenous population in order to reduce its military effectiveness, but this is not corroborated by contemporaneous records of the settlement and most researchers attribute the indigenous smallpox outbreak to other causes. Nineteenth century In 1802, largely at the instigation of Admiral John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent, they were titled the Royal Marines by King George III. The Royal Marine Artillery (RMA) was formed as an establishment within the British Royal Marines in 1804 to man the artillery in bomb vessels. This had been done by the Royal Regiment of Artillery, but a lawsuit by a Royal Artillery officer resulted in a court decision that army officers were not subject to naval orders. As their coats were the blue of the Royal Regiment of Artillery, this group was nicknamed the \\"Blue Marines\\" and the infantry element, who wore the scarlet coats of the British infantry, became known as the \\"Red Marines\\", often given the derogatory nickname \\"Lobsters\\" by sailors. Major General John Tupper His Majesty's Marine Forces. French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars During the Napoleonic Wars the Royal Marines participated in every notable naval battle on board the Royal Navy's ships and also took part in multiple amphibious actions. Marines had a dual function aboard ships of the Royal Navy in this period; routinely, they ensured the security of the ship's officers and supported their maintenance of discipline in the ship's crew, and in battle, they engaged the enemy's crews, whether firing from positions on their own ship, or fighting in boarding actions. The number of marines on board Royal Naval ships depended on the size of the ship and was generally kept at a ratio of one marine per ship gun, plus officers. For example: a First Rate Ship of the Line contained 104 marines while a 28 gun Frigate had 29. Between 1807 and 1814, the total marine establishment number was 31,400 men. Manpower (recruitment and retention) problems saw regular infantry units from the British Army being used as shipboard replacements on numerous occasions. One result of the Royal Navy's dominance of the seas in Europe, and the blockading of the French Navy's ports, was that manpower constraints became less of an issue at the end of the Napoleonic Wars. From 1812, such maritime supremacy meant the Mediterranean and Channel Fleets were assigned additional marines for use 'in destroying signal communications and other petty harassing modes of warfare'.Brooks & Little, p. 86 In the Caribbean theatre volunteers from freed French slaves on Marie-Galante were used to form the 1st Corps of Colonial Marines. These men bolstered the ranks, helping the British to hold the island until reinforcements arrived. This practice was repeated during the War of 1812, where escaped American slaves were formed into the 2nd Corps of Colonial Marines. These men were commanded by Royal Marines officers and fought alongside their regular Royal Marines counterparts at the Battle of Bladensburg in August 1814. During the battle a detachment of Royal Marine Artillery commanded by Lieutenant John Lawrence deployed Congreve rockets resulting in the rout of the US militiamen.Heidler & Heidler, p. 24,56 The Royal Marines battalion and the 21st Regiment of Foot also took part in the Burning of Washington later that day.Gleig,p. 95, 131 Also present on shore during the Chesapeake campaign was a composite battalion of Marines, formed from ships' Marine detachments, frequently led by Captain John Robyns. A smaller composite battalion of about 100 men (23 officers,Nicolas, p. 232 two of whom (John Wilson 1787-1850 and John Alexander Phillips 1790-1865) were Trafalgar veterans, and 80 other ranks) also took part in the Battle of New Orleans, under the command of Brevet Major Thomas Adair, in January 1815. The only British success at New Orleans was an attack on the west bank of the Mississippi River by a 700-man force, consisting of the 100 Royal Marines, 100 sailors under Captain Rowland Money, and 3 companies of the 85th Foot. Throughout the war Royal Marines units raided up and down the east coast of America including up the Penobscot River and in the Chesapeake Bay. They later helped capture Fort Bowyer in Mobile Bay in what was the last action of the war.  Crimean War and beyond  Royal Marines parade in the streets of Chania in Crete following the occupation of the island by the Great Powers (Britain, France, Italy, Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Russia) in spring 1897 In 1855, the marine Infantry forces were renamed the Royal Marines Light Infantry (RMLI) and in 1862 the name was slightly altered to Royal Marine Light Infantry. The Royal Navy only saw limited active service at sea after 1850 (until 1914) and became interested in developing the concept of landings by Naval Brigades. In these Naval Brigades, the function of the Royal Marines was to land first and act as skirmishers ahead of sailors trained as conventional infantry and artillery. This skirmishing was the traditional function of light infantry.Chappell, pp. 14‚Äì15 During the Crimean War in 1854 and 1855, three Royal Marines earned the Victoria Cross, two in the Crimea and one in the Baltic. For most of their history, British Marines had been organised as fusiliers. In the rest of the 19th Century the Royal Marines served in many landings especially in the First and Second Opium Wars (1839‚Äì1842 and 1856‚Äì1860) against the Chinese. These were all successful except for the landing at the Mouth of the Peiho in 1859, where Admiral Sir James Hope ordered a landing across extensive mud flats. Early 20th Century The Royal Marines also played a prominent role in the Boxer Rebellion in China (1900), where a Royal Marine earned a further Corps Victoria Cross. Pursuing a career in the Marines had been considered social suicide through much of the 18th and 19th centuries since Marine officers had a lower standing than their counterparts in the Royal Navy. An effort was made in 1907 through the common entry or \\"Selborne scheme\\" to reduce the professional differences between RN and RM officers through a system of common entry that provided for an initial period of service where both groups performed the same roles and underwent the same training. For the first part of the 20th century, the Royal Marines' role was the traditional one of providing shipboard infantry for security, boarding parties and small-scale landings. The Marines' other traditional position on a Royal Navy ship was manning 'X' and 'Y' (the aftermost) gun turrets on a battleship or cruiser. First World War During the First World War, in addition to their usual stations aboard ship, Royal Marines were part of the Royal Naval Division which landed in Belgium in 1914 to help defend Antwerp and later took part in the amphibious landing at Gallipoli in 1915. It also served on the Western Front. The division's first two commanders were Royal Marine Artillery Generals. Other Royal Marines acted as landing parties in the naval campaign against the Turkish fortifications in the Dardanelles before the Gallipoli landing. They were sent ashore to assess damage to Turkish fortifications after bombardment by British and French ships and, if necessary, to complete their destruction. The Royal Marines were the last to leave Gallipoli, replacing both British and French troops in a neatly planned and executed withdrawal from the beaches. The Royal Marines also took part in the Zeebrugge Raid in 1918. Five Royal Marines earned the Victoria Cross in the First World War, two at Zeebrugge, one at Gallipoli, one at Jutland and one on the Western Front. Between the World Wars After the war Royal Marines took part in the allied intervention in Russia. In 1919, the 6th Battalion RMLI mutinied and was disbanded at Murmansk. The Royal Marine Artillery (RMA) and Royal Marine Light Infantry (RMLI) were amalgamated on 22 June 1923. Post-war demobilisation had seen the Royal Marines reduced from 55,000 (1918) to 15,000 in 1922 and there was Treasury pressure for a further reduction to 6,000 or even the entire disbandment of the Corps. As a compromise an establishment of 9,500 was settled upon but this meant that two separate branches could no longer be maintained. The abandonment of the Marine's artillery role meant that the Corps would subsequently have to rely on Royal Artillery support when ashore, that the title of Royal Marines would apply to the entire Corps and that only a few specialists would now receive gunnery training. As a form of consolation the dark blue and red uniform of the Royal Marine Artillery now became the full dress of the entire Corps. Royal Marine officers and SNCO's however continue to wear the historic scarlet in mess dress to the present day. The ranks of Private, used by the RMLI, and Gunner, used by the RMA, were abolished and replaced by the rank of Marine. A Centaur IV tank belonging to the Royal Marines Armoured Support Group, which supported the D-Day landings at \\"La br√®che d'Hermanville\\" on 6 June 1944. Second World War During the Second World War, a small party of Royal Marines were first ashore at Namsos in April 1940, seizing the approaches to the Norwegian town preparatory to a landing by the British Army two days later. The Royal Marines formed the Royal Marines Division as an amphibiously trained division, parts of which served at Dakar and in the capture of Madagascar. After the assault on the French naval base at Antsirane in Madagascar was held up, fifty Sea Service Royal Marines from HMS Ramilles commanded by Captain Martin Price were landed on the quay of the base by the British destroyer HMS Anthony after it ran the gauntlet of French shore batteries defending Diego Suarez Bay. They then captured two of the batteries, which led to a quick surrender by the French.Mountbatten, p. 107 In addition the Royal Marines formed Mobile Naval Base Defence Organisations (MNBDOs) similar to the United States Marine Corps Defense Battalions. One of these took part in the defence of Crete. Royal Marines also served in Malaya and in Singapore, where due to losses they were joined with remnants of the 2nd Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders to form the \\"Plymouth Argylls\\". The Royal Marines formed one commando (A Commando) which served at Dieppe. One month after Dieppe, most of the 11th Royal Marine Battalion was killed or captured in an ill staged amphibious landing at Tobruk in Operation Agreement, again the Marines were involved with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, this time the 1st Battalion. In 1942 the Infantry Battalions of the Royal Marine Division were re-organised as Commandos, joining the British Army Commandos. The Division command structure became a Special Service Brigade command. The support troops became landing craft crew and saw extensive action on D-Day in June 1944. A total of four Special Service Brigades (later Commando brigade) were raised during the war, and Royal Marines were represented in all of them. A total of nine RM Commandos (Battalions) were raised during the war, numbered from 40 to 48. 1 Commando Brigade had just one RM Battalion, No 45 Commando. 2 Commando Brigade had two RM battalions, Nos 40 and 43 Commandos. 3 Commando Brigade also had two, Nos 42 and 44 Commandos. 4 Commando Brigade was entirely Royal Marine after March 1944, comprising Nos 41, 46, 47 and 48 Commandos. 1 Commando Brigade took part in first in the Tunisia Campaign and then assaults on Sicily and Normandy, campaigns in the Rhineland and crossing the Rhine. 2 Commando Brigade was involved in the Salerno landings, Anzio, Comacchio, and operations in the Argenta Gap. 3 Commando Brigade served in Sicily and Burma. 4 Commando Brigade served in the Battle of Normandy and in the Battle of the Scheldt on the island of Walcheren during the clearing of Antwerp. In January 1945, two further RM brigades were formed, 116th Brigade and 117th Brigade. Both were conventional infantry, rather than in the commando role. 116th Brigade saw some action in the Netherlands, but 117th Brigade was hardly used operationally. A number of Royal Marines served as pilots during the Second World War. It was a Royal Marines officer who led the attack by a formation of Blackburn Skuas that sank the K√∂nigsberg. Eighteen Royal Marines commanded Fleet Air Arm squadrons during the course of the war, and with the formation of the British Pacific Fleet were well-represented in the final drive on Japan. Captains and majors generally commanded squadrons, whilst in one case Lt. Colonel R.C. Hay on HMS Indefatigable was Air Group Co-ordinator from HMS Victorious of the entire British Pacific Fleet. Throughout the war Royal Marines continued in their traditional roles of providing ships detachments and manning a proportion of the guns on cruisers and capital ships. They also provided the crews for the UK's minor landing craft, and the Royal Marines Armoured Support Group manned Centaur IV tanks on D Day; one of these is still on display at Pegasus Bridge. Only one Marine (Corporal Thomas Peck Hunter of 43 Commando) was awarded the Victoria Cross in the Second World War for action at Lake Comacchio in Italy. Hunter was the most recent RM commando to be awarded the medal. The Royal Marines Boom Patrol Detachment under Blondie Haslar carried out Operation Frankton and provided the basis for the post-war continuation of the SBS. After 1945 Royal Marines in 1972 In 1946 the Army Commandos were disbanded, leaving the Royal Marines to continue the commando role (with supporting army elements). Royal Marines were involved in the Korean War. 41 (Independent) Commando was reformed in 1950, and was originally envisaged as a raiding force for use against North Korea. It performed this role in partnership with the United States Navy until after the landing of United States Army X Corps at Wonsan. It then joined the US's 1st Marine Division at Koto-Ri. As Task Force Drysdale with Lt. Col. D.B. Drysdale RM in command, 41 Commando, a USMC company, a US Army company and part of the divisional train fought their way from Koto-Ri to Hagaru after the Chinese had blocked the road to the North. It then took part in the famous withdrawal from Chosin Reservoir. After that, a small amount of raiding followed, before the Marines were withdrawn from the conflict in 1951. It received the Presidential Citation after the USMC got the regulations modified to allow foreign units to receive the award. After playing a part in the long-running Malayan Emergency, the next action came in 1956, during the Suez Crisis. Headquarters 3 Commando Brigade, and Nos 40, 42 and 45 Commandos took part in the operation. It marked the first time that a helicopter assault was used operationally to land troops in an amphibious attack. British and French forces defeated the Egyptians, but after pressure from the United States, and French domestic pressure, they backed down. In September 1955 45 Commando was deployed to Cyprus to undertake anti-terrorist operations against the EOKA guerrillas during tensions between the Greek and Turkish inhabitants of the island. The EOKA were a small, but powerful organisation of Greek Cypriots, who had great local support from the Greek community. The unit, based in Malta at the time travelled to the Kyrenia mountain area of the island and in December 1955 launched Operation Foxhunter, an operation to destroy EOKA's main base.French, p. 134 Further action in the Far East was seen during the Indonesia‚ÄìMalaysia confrontation. Nos 40 and 42 Commando went to Borneo at various times to help keep Indonesian forces from worsening situations in the neighbouring region, in what was an already heated part of the world, with conflicts in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. During the campaign there was a company-strength amphibious assault by Lima Company of 42 Commando at the town of Limbang to rescue hostages. The Limbang raid saw three of the 150 marines involved decorated, L company 42 commando are still referred to today as Limbang Company in memory of this archetypal commando raid. In January 1964, part of the Tanzanian Army mutinied. Within 24 hours elements of 41 Commando had left Bickleigh Camp, Plymouth, Devon, and were travelling by air to Nairobi, Kenya, continuing by road into Tanzania. At the same time, Commandos aboard HMS Bulwark sailed to East Africa and anchored off-shore from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The revolt was put down and the next six months were spent in touring Tanzanian military out-posts disarming military personnel. From 1969 onwards, Royal Marine units regularly deployed to Northern Ireland during The Troubles, during the course of which 13 were killed in action.Britain's Small Wars, Northern Ireland Roll of Honour , Retrieved 29 January 2007 A further eleven died in the Deal barracks bombing of the Royal Marines School of Music in 1989. Between 1974 and 1984, the Royal Marines undertook three United Nations tours of duty in Cyprus. The first was in November 1974, when 41 Commando took over the Limassol District from the 2nd Battalion of the Guards Brigade, following the Turkish invasion, and became the first commando to wear the light blue berets of the UN when they began the Corps' first six-month tour with the UN forces in Cyprus (UNIFCYP).Henn, p. 237 The Falklands War provided the backdrop to the next action of the Royal Marines. Argentina invaded the islands in April 1982. A British task force was immediately despatched to recapture them, and given that an amphibious assault would be necessary, the Royal Marines were heavily involved. 3 Commando Brigade was brought to full combat strength, with not only 40, 42 and 45 Commandos, but also the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the Parachute Regiment attached. The troops were landed at San Carlos Water at the western end of East Falkland, and proceeded to \\"yomp\\" across the entire island to the capital, Stanley, which fell on 14 June 1982 to 2nd Battalion The Parachute Regiment. A Royal Marines divisional headquarters was deployed, under Major-General Jeremy Moore, who was commander of British land forces during the war. Boarding procedures demonstrated by Royal Marines on the frigate HMS Somerset in the Persian Gulf, in 2004 The main element of 3 Commando Brigade was not deployed in the 1991 Gulf War. However, 24 men from K Company, 42 Commando Royal Marines were deployed as six man teams aboard two Royal Navy destroyers and frigates. They were used as ship boarding parties and took part in numerous boardings of suspect shipping. There were also further elements deployed to provide protection of shipping whilst in ports throughout the Gulf. The main element of 3 Commando Brigade was deployed to northern Iraq in the aftermath to provide aid to the Iraqi Kurds as part of Operation Safe Haven.Ballantyne, p. 134 From 2000 onwards, the Royal Marines began converting from their traditional light infantry role towards an expanded force protection type role, with the introduction of the Commando 21 concept, leading to the introduction of the Viking, the first armoured vehicle to be operated by the Royal Marines for half a century. In November 2001, after the seizure of Bagram Air Base by the Special Boat Service, Charlie Company of 40 Commando became the first British regular forces into Afghanistan, using Bagram Air base to support British and US Special Forces Operations. 2002 saw the deployment of 45 Commando Royal Marines to Afghanistan, where contact with enemy forces was expected to be heavy. However little action was seen, with no Al-Qaeda or Taliban forces being found or engaged. RMBS personnel are behind. 3 Commando Brigade deployed on Operation TELIC, the British involvement in the Iraq war, in early 2003 with the USMC's 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit under its command. The Brigade conducted an amphibious assault on the Al-Faw Peninsula in Iraq in support of US Navy SEALs. The 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit and 42 Commando securing the port of Umm Qasr and 40 Commando conducting a helicopter assault in order to secure the oil installations to assure continued operability of Iraq's export capability. The attack proceeded well, with light casualties. 3 Commando Brigade served as part of the US 1st Marine Division and received the US Presidential Unit Citation, in fact the 2nd time in 50 years the Royal Marines received this. Royal Marines in Afghanistan in January 2009 In 2004, Iranian armed forces took Royal Navy personnel prisoner, including six Royal Marines, on the Shatt al-Arab (Arvand Rud in Persian) river, between Iran and Iraq. They were released three days later following diplomatic discussions between the UK and Iran. In November 2006, 3 Commando Brigade relieved 16 Air Assault Brigade of the British Army in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, as part of Operation Herrick. In 2007, Iranian armed forces also took prisoner Royal Navy personnel, including seven Royal Marines, when a boarding party from HMS Cornwall was seized in the waters between Iran and Iraq, in the Persian Gulf. In 2008, Lance-Corporal Matthew Croucher of 40 Commando was awarded the George Cross (GC) after throwing himself on a grenade to save the lives of the other marines in his patrol, in Afghanistan. Remarkably, he managed to keep his rucksack between himself and the grenade, and that, together with his body armour, meant he suffered only very minor injuries. In 2018, women became eligible to apply for all roles in the British forces, including the Royal Marines. Shore bases When first permanently established (1755), the Marines were formed into three Divisions based in the three principal Royal Navy Dockyards: Portsmouth, Chatham and Plymouth. 18th century The Royal Marines was the first complete British corps to be provided with its own barracks - one for each Division:Douet, James, British Barracks 1600-1914, English Heritage, London 1998. *The Royal Marine Barracks, Portsmouth were established in 1768 but the premises did not prove altogether satisfactory, and in 1848 the Portsmouth Division was relocated to Forton Barracks in nearby Gosport. *The Royal Marine Barracks, Chatham was opened in 1779 and remained in use until 1950 (when Chatham ceased to operate as a naval base). *The Royal Marine Barracks, Plymouth were established in 1756 and, as Stonehouse Barracks still form the headquarters of 3 Commando Brigade. 19th and 20th centuries In 1805 a fourth division was established, based at Woolwich (site of another Royal Dockyard). The Royal Marine Barracks, Woolwich and Infirmary were built there (in Frances Street) between 1842 and 1848; both were progressive designs for their time. After the closure of the dockyard, the division was disbanded (1869). The buildings were handed over to the army and were renamed Cambridge Barracks: they were largely demolished in 1975 but the gatehouse remains. In 1861 the Royal Marine Depot, Deal was established alongside the important naval anchorage known as the Downs. It was initially served by Marines from the Chatham, Portsmouth and Woolwich Divisions. The Depot remained in service until 1991 although the Royal Marines School of Music remained on site until 1996. The Royal Marine Artillery was initially based at Chatham, but in 1824 was moved to its own dedicated barracks, Gunwharf Barracks, in Portsmouth. In 1858 the Royal Marine Artillery moved from there to Fort Cumberland (which continued to be used for gunnery training into the 20th century). The establishment of the Royal Marine Artillery as a separate unit in 1859 led to Eastney Barracks being built to accommodate them; the barracks were opened at Eastney in 1867. Following the amalgamation of the RM Artillery and Light Infantry in 1923, Forton Barracks was closed and Eastney became the Corps' main base in Portsmouth. Eastney Barracks remained the Corps Headquarters until 1995, when it was sold and converted to private housing.

Life Ferreolus was the son of Tonantius Ferreolus of Nimes and his wife Industria of Narbo. He was evidently the senator and relative, Ferreolus, who was reported by Apollinaris of Valence in a letter to Avitus of Vienne to have visited him in around 520.Heinzelmann, 1982, p. 609. \\"Ferreolus 4\\" Ferreolus experienced the change in rule from the Visigoths to the Ostrogoths after the Battle of Vouille and from the Ostrogoths to the Franks after the cession of Provence to Theodoric of Austrasia after 534. He was a relative of Parthenius who had served the Ostrogoths and was to become one of Theodoric of Austrasia's key civil officials. The estates of the Ferreoli in the valley of the Gardon (Prusianum) were near the new borderline between the Franks and Visigoths after the Ostrogoths had ceased to administer Visigothic lands in southern Gaul and Ferreolus and his family ended up with the Franks as masters since the better part of their properties fell within the lands of the new Austrasian kingdom. Much of Prusianum was under the jurisdiction of the See of Uzes which was effectively a family controlled bishopric throughout the 6th century and was then held by Ferreolus' brother Bishop Firminus of Uzes. Part of the properties were apparently in the See of Nimes the Frankish part of which was smaller than the Visigothic controlled part. A new diocese, Arisitum, was created out of the Frankish parishes of the See of Nimes by Sigibert of Austrasia about 570 and the bishopric was given to Ferreolus' son, Deotarius. The eastern estates thus disposed, Ferreolus then apparently associated with the properties at Segodunum or other properties near Rodez. One of his children, Tarsicia became a nun at Rodez. Others of his children appear to have associated with and even relocated to the Austrasian court at Metz and it appears (certainly from his marriage to Dode) that he was there on occasion as well. Moreover, he and his family do not appear to have occupied the Episcopal See of Rodez though it is arguable some of these estates (Trevidos) may have been part of the diocese of Arisitum. He married, after about 520, Dode.

Kamala Harris citizenship op-ed  In August 2020, Newsweek published an op-ed by Eastman questioning 2020 vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris's eligibility for the office. He asserted she could not be a U.S. citizen by birth despite being born in Oakland, California, if neither of her parents was a permanent resident at the time of her birth. Eastman said that she could have subsequently obtained citizenship derived from the naturalization of her parents if one of them had become a citizen prior to her 16th birthday in 1980, which would have allowed Harris to fulfill the nine-year citizenship requirement required to become a senator. Many prominent legal scholars disagreed with Eastman's position, and many compared it to the birther-ism theory against President Barack Obama. Newsweek defended the column. It stated there was no connection between the op-ed and the birther movement. Rather, the op-ed focused on the \\"long-standing, somewhat arcane legal debate about the precise meaning of the phrase 'subject to the jurisdiction thereof' and the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment\\", also known as the jus sanguinis or jus soli debate. However, Axios noted that most constitutional scholars do not accept Eastman's view, labeling it \\"baseless.\\" Axios also criticized him for brushing off the eligibility concerns of 2016 presidential candidate Ted Cruz, born in Calgary, Canada, in a 2016 National Review op-ed, claiming they were \\"silly\\". Many academics dismissed Eastman‚Äôs legal argument. For instance, Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of Berkeley Law School, told BBC: \\"Under section 1 of the 14th Amendment, anyone born in the United States is a United States citizen. The Supreme Court has held this since the 1890s. Kamala Harris was born in the United States.\\" Harvard Professor Laurence Tribe was similarly dismissive, telling The New York Times ‚ÄúI hadn‚Äôt wanted to comment on [Eastman‚Äôs idea] because it‚Äôs such an idiotic theory.

(died 1378) was a 14th-century Scottish Dominican friar and prelate. Possibly from a Lanark burgess family, he was a Dominican and a priest by 1356, and by 1364 was styled Magister, indicating the completion of a long university education.Watt, Biographical Dictionary, p. 325. He first appears in the sources, c. 1355/6 as a confessor of King David II of Scotland; he retained this royal position through the 1350s and into the 1360s; Adam received a number of English safe-conducts (between May 1356 and August 1357) to visit King David, who for a time was a prisoner in England. Adam spent a great deal of time at the papal court in Avignon, France. He was there on 29 January 1359, as a proctor for Patrick Leuchars, Bishop of Brechin. He was sent there again at some point by the crown, receiving payment for this trip sometime between August 1362 and November 1364; he is not styled \\"bishop elect\\", meaning that this trip must have occurred before 1363.Watt, Biographical Dictionary, pp. 325-6. In 1363, Adam de Lanark was elected Bishop of Galloway and received papal provision to the vacant bishopric on 17 November 1363.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 130. He was consecrated by 2 January 1364. While seeking confirmation at the papal court, he probably presented a roll of petitions on behalf of King David II and did receive a number of faculties in order to grant dispensations in the bishopric of Galloway.Watt, Biographical Dictionary, p. 326. Bishop Adam's return to Scotland is signalled by the grant of safe-conduct through England issued to him on 20 February. Sometime before 25 January 1365, he was in Galloway witnessing a charter of Thomas Fleming, Earl of Wigtown. He was a frequent attender of royal councils and parliaments until 1371, when his patron David II died and was replaced on the throne by David II's long-time rival, Robert Stewart, Earl of Strathearn, who became Robert II of Scotland. Bishop Adam is thereafter a harder figure to trace, and little more is known about his activities besides the fact that he is said to have died at the papal court in Avignon during the vacancy of the papacy; that is, Bishop Adam died between the death of Pope Gregory XI on 27 March 1378 and the consecration of Avignon Pope Clement VII on the following 31 October.Dowden, Bishops, p. 363; Watt, Biographical Dictionary, p. 326; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, pp. 130-1.

The jet disintegrated mid-air during an aerobatic manoeuvre, causing the death of pilot John Derry and onboard flight test observer Anthony Richards. Debris from the aircraft fell onto a crowd of spectators, killing 29 people and injuring 60. The cause of the break-up was later determined to be structural failure due to a design flaw in the wing's leading edge. All DH.110s were initially grounded, but after modification to its design, the type entered service with the Royal Navy as the Sea Vixen. Stricter safety procedures were subsequently enacted for UK air shows and there were no further spectator fatalities until the 2015 Shoreham Airshow crash in which 11 people died. Breakup The planned demonstration of the DH.110 on that day was nearly cancelled when the aircraft at Farnborough, WG 240, an all-black night fighter prototype, became unserviceable. It was de Havilland's second DH.110 prototype, and had been taken supersonic over the show on the opening day. Derry and Richards then collected WG 236, the first DH.110 prototype, from de Havilland's factory in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, and flew it to Farnborough with just enough time to start their slot. Following a supersonic dive and flypast from and during a left bank at about toward the air show's 120,000 spectators, the pilot pulled up into a climb. In less than a second, the aircraft disintegrated: the outer sections of the wing, both engines and the cockpit separated from the airframe. The cockpit, with the two crew members still inside, fell right in front of the spectators nearest the runway, injuring several people. The engines travelled much further on a ballistic trajectory; one engine crashed harmlessly, but the second one ploughed into the so-called Observation Hill, causing most of the fatalities. The rest of the airframe fluttered down and crashed on the opposite side of the runway. One eyewitness was Richard Gardner, then five years old. He recalled in adulthood:Jet! When Britain Ruled the Skies. 1. Military Marvels. First broadcast BBC Four 22 August 2012 Sixty-three years later, speaking on the BBC Today radio programme in the wake of the Shoreham Airshow disaster, author Moyra Bremner recalled her own traumatic experience. A huge bang silenced the crowd and was followed by \\"My God, look out\\" from the commentator. Bremner, standing on the roof of her parents' car, realised that an engine was heading straight towards her. It passed a few feet over her head, a \\"massive shining cylinder\\", and then plunged into the crowd on the hill behind. Following the accident the air display programme continued once the debris was cleared from the runway, with Neville Duke exhibiting the prototype Hawker Hunter and taking it supersonic over the show later that day. Aftermath Queen Elizabeth II and Duncan Sandys, the Minister of Supply, both sent messages of condolence. The coroner's jury recorded that Derry and Richards had \\"died accidentally in the normal course of their duty\\", and that \\"the deaths [of the spectators] were accidental\\", adding that \\"no blame is attached to Mr. John Derry\\". The investigation concluded that the manoeuvring had caused an airframe instability because of a faulty D-nose leading edge arrangement (which had successfully been used in the lighter subsonic de Havilland Vampire). The redesigned DH.110 resumed flights in June 1953 and was eventually developed into the de Havilland Sea Vixen naval fighter. More stringent airshow safety measures were subsequently introduced: jets were obliged to keep at least from crowds if flying straight and when performing manoeuvres, and always at an altitude of at least .

The cathedral is dedicated to Saint Papulus (), an early Christian bishop and martyr, from whom the settlement also took its name. It was the seat of the Bishop of Saint-Papoul. This diocese, along with a number of others in the region, was created in 1317 in the aftermath of the suppression of the Albigensians. The Abbey of Saint-Papoul had been founded here in the 8th century, and in 1317 the abbot was elevated to the status of bishop, and the abbey church to that of cathedral. The diocese and the abbey were suppressed during the French Revolution and the diocese was abolished under the Concordat of 1801, its territory being transferred almost entirely to the Diocese of Carcassonne. The abbey buildings remain and the cathedral / abbey church has become the parish church of the village of Saint-Papoul.  History  The abbey was founded in the eighth century. Its name comes from Saint Papoul, a hermit from the 5th or 6th century. He was martyred and shaken at the place called \\"L'Ermitage\\". According to legend, he bent down and picked up the top of his skull. The monk Saint Berenger lived there in the 11th century and his tomb became a place of pilgrimage. In 1317, Pope John XXII created the bishopric of Saint-Papoul, and the abbey church became the cathedral. 34 bishops succeeded one another until the Revolution occurred in year 1361, as a result, the cathedral was plundered by the Routiers and in 1595 by the Protestants. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the abbey underwent important restorations and the episcopal palace was rebuilt. In 1790, the cathedral maintained a small body of music for the service of worship, formed by an organist, a cantor who also played the serpent and a choirboy. During the Revolution, the bishopric was suppressed and the cathedral became a parish church. Sources * Catholic Encyclopedia: Carcassonne, incl.

The solution must be as efficient as possible while respecting crew member preferences, honoring seniority, conforming regulations, and operation coverage requirements.  Pairings  Work schedules in the airlines industry must cover not just a shift or a day, as workers in other industries might. Airlines work schedules consist of assignments called \\"crew pairings\\" or simply \\"pairings\\", which is a sequence of flights or legs that starts and then ends at the same domicile. Pairings are usually created by another computer program called pairing optimizer.  Bidding and line  The process of requesting a certain schedule is called \\"bidding\\". Generally this is done on a monthly basis. The monthly schedule called \\"line\\" which a crew member gets will consist of a series of \\"pairings\\". Each month the airlines crew planning sets the new pairings due to new locations being added or removed, new times, or changes in aircraft. These new pairings are then made available for assignment or bidding. In the United States, crew members are often working under a union's collective bargaining agreement, and sometimes including non-union workplaces, seniority is used to give senior crew member the right to override junior crew member requests. A line itself must also satisfy legal and contractual constraints. Ideally it should also satisfy the crew members choices and preferences.  Constraints  Each month, airlines crew planning must generate legal crewing solutions. These crewing solutions strive to achieve a minimum-cost of operation by matching specific aircraft, the routes they fly and crew pairings in a manner that each leg is covered by one crew that is capable of flying that aircraft at that time and in that place. The factors that must be respected when assigning a crew member line are called \\"constraints\\" which include: * Government Regulations - FAR 117, FAR 121, FAR 135, CAP 371, CASA, DGAC etc. dependent upon the type of operation and the civil authority overseeing that particular airline. * Collective Bargaining Agreements (CBA) - ALPA, AFA, IBT * Airline Policies - FRMP, Fairness These include: * Flight Time Limitations (FTL) - Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly and Yearly * Flight Duty Period Limitations (FDP) - Daily, Weekly, Monthly * Duty Period Limitations - Daily, Weekly, Monthly * Rest and Day(s) off Requirements - Daily, Weekly, Monthly * Acclimatization - mitigation for travel across several time zones * Diurnal components - Time of day and impingement upon the Window of Circadian Low (WOCL) * Augmentation (operations with additional active crew members) * Credit/Pay Limitations * Pre-assigned absences and duties. * Scheduling Continuity - time between flights, Overlapping activities, Separation of assignments, base allocation of crew members, Reserve limitations, Crew Training Requirements.  Crew scheduling methods  There are three general approaches to solving this complex crewing challenge: Assigned Lines, Bid lines and PBS.  Assigned Lines  In the Assigned Lines approach, the properties of the line, and days off are simply managed via the use of constraints to build \\"legal\\" lines. The optimizer finds the most efficient use of the pairings and reserve assignments. A crew member will have no bidding or preferences.  Bid lines  In the bid lines approach, pairings are placed within pre-built lines by line optimizer, a computer program that puts the pairings into \\"legal\\" lines, and does not take into account the individual crew members' preferences, nor the constraints imposed by crew members. The generic set of lines are then published for bidding. A crew member is free to choose any line and it will be awarded as long as no other senior crew member who also wants this same line. Unless the most senior in the bid package, crew member needs to submit multiple preferred lines in order to guarantee a preferred line; otherwise, a leftover line will be awarded. By the bidding process, the preferred line may not be awarded completely, because the line was created without reference to specific crew member constraints, it may conflict with crew members' predetermined activities. The conflicting pairings must then be reassigned to other crew members resulting in a wide range of inefficiencies. Clearly this post-award reallocation is costly to the airlines. These inefficiencies also force airlines to hire more crew members. However, bid line does offer a transparent and easy process to bid and to award, and in many cases the conflict itself actually benefits the crew members that being paid without the work according to the contracts. Though management is eager to streamline operations, crew members may still prefer the bid lines.  PBS  In the PBS approach, the lines have not been created at the bidding, and the crew members have the ability to designate what kind of pairings, the properties of the line, and days off they prefer, thereby building a line themselves. PBS also allows crew members to bid reserve duties mixed with the pairings biddings. PBS provides a one-step process from the pairings to the lines that each crew member prefers and can legally cover. The real challenge for PBS is that it tries to solve two innately conflicted goals, honoring preferences without violating seniority and awarding all pairings.  Conventional PBS  In a conventional PBS, crew members make their bids and chooses their preferences based upon their own best interests. Once all the bids are made and the bid period ends, the program attempts to create the solution by an \\"optimization\\" process. Each crew member will be awarded the best line of his own definitions from available pairings at his seniority. For each crew member, when there are many best lines, the one with the least interest conflict to the junior crew members will be awarded, which is an advantage that interactive PBS cannot achieve. By the optimization, system finds a way to satisfy both senior and junior crew members while still honoring seniority and operation coverage requirement. The optimization process itself is complicated which may take many hours and multiple runs to achieve the optimal solution. A rejected preference happens when the pairing is awarded to senior, or overall coverage issue, or legality violation, and the reason for rejection will be provided.  Interactive PBS  Computerized Bidding was first First introduced in 1986 by SBS. The application was developed by SBS founder Christian Boegner who later founded Crewing Solutions, and was in use on powerful internal computers at TWA among other airlines. By 1992 using such services as CompuServe and the newly introduced home PCs, SBS allowed Pilots to Bid using the internet to connect to the SBS bidding and scheduling programs running within the airlines networks. With the advent of increasingly more powerful airline and home computers as well as high speed internet connectivity having become ubiquitous and mainstream, those original computerized programs have evolved into today's web-based, with crew members using laptop computers or even mobile devices to bid. The conventional PBS process can now be fully interactive, affording the possibility that more crew members get a schedule that fulfills their wishes. In this scheme, bidding can be a continuous process lasting several days or weeks, and can offer interactivity, where crew members can see the status of other crew member bids reflected as they bid. A crew member can change preferences in the midst of the process after seeing how others are bidding. It is this live awareness which some PBS applications can provide which allows crew members to bid realistically because they see and can bid only for trips and days off that are available to them at their seniority at any given time throughout the remaining bidding window. Without a live, interactive PBS's interactive recalculation during the bid period, if crew members bid for certain pairings and/or days off heavily over others, at the end of the bid period either a secondary, time-consuming algorithm needs to be implemented to solve the resultant conflicts, or manual manipulation is used to fill the \\"open time\\" (unassigned pairings).  Implement PBS  PBS is not a new concept and the products have been available in the market and used in many airlines for many years. The algorithms used may be very different and usually lead to very different results and satisfactions. In addition, the user interfaces that provided for crew members to enter the preferences are also very different from vendor to vendor. The evaluation of the PBS products and the negotiation between the management and crew members are the most important and critical steps of a successful implementation of the PBS.

Originally thought of as a potential replacement for either Jack Charlton or Norman Hunter as the Don Revie Leeds team started to break up. Stevenson had to wait until April 1976 before he got anything like a run of games when he made six successive league appearances replacing Paul Reaney at right back. He had a good run at centre half in 1979 and in midfield in 1981 making a total of 95 appearances. In 1981 a swap deal saw him move to Birmingham City where he played over 100 times. He joined Bristol Rovers in 1985, but decided to retire the following summer aged 29, after struggling with injuries. Following his retirement from football, Byron became the landlord of the New Inn public house on Elland Road, Churwell, Leeds, which had been managed by another Leeds United and Wales international legend John Charles years earlier.

From 1991 to 1999, he was the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts. From 1979 to 1987, he was a member of both houses of the Texas State Legislature. From 1987 to 1991, he was one of the three members of the Texas Railroad Commission. In 1998 and 2002, he was the Democratic Party's nominee for Lieutenant Governor of Texas. Sharp is also a principal in the Austin office of the Dallas-based Ryan & Company, a tax consulting firm. In 2005, he was appointed to serve as chairman of the Texas Tax Reform Commission. In December 2008, Sharp announced that he would run in 2012 for the United States Senate seat held by the then retiring Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison. However, Sharp never sought the position, having instead been named the Texas A&M; System chancellor. Background The son of an oil field worker and a school teacher, Sharp grew up in the small farming community of Placedo in Victoria County along the Texas Gulf Coast. In 1972, Sharp earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Texas A&M; University in College Station, where he was a member of the Corps of Cadets and was elected Student Body President. Upon graduation, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Army Reserves. He belongs to American Legion Post 76 in Austin. In 1976, Sharp received a master's degree in Public Administration from Texas State University in San Marcos while working full-time in Austin with the Legislative Budget Board. In 1978, Sharp returned to Victoria, Texas, where he opened a real estate firm with partner and former County Commissioner Gene Martin and became a successful small business owner. That same year, he married Charlotte Sharp. The couple has a son, Spencer, and a daughter, Victoria. The Sharps are involved in many community and humanitarian efforts, including airlifts of Jewish families to Israel from Ukraine and Russia. In 1978, Sharp was elected to the Texas House of Representatives from the 40th District in Victoria and was later named \\"Outstanding Freshman\\" by Texas Monthly. Just a few weeks after his re-election for a third full two-year term in the general election of 1982, he ran and won a special election runoff and served a full four-year term in the Texas Senate. He was appointed to the powerful Senate Finance Committee. In 1986, he was elected to the Texas Railroad Commission. In that position, he worked to reform the state's trucking regulations, improve railroad safety, and develop new markets for Texas' abundant supply of clean-burning and efficient natural gas. Sharp has received numerous awards, including the only \\"Texas Quality Award\\" ever presented to a governmental agency. Texas State University presented Sharp with the \\"Distinguished Alumnus Award\\" in 1996, where he also taught a course on Texas state government for several semesters in the early 2000s. On August 9, 2012, Sharp was selected as \\"Mr. South Texas\\" for 2013 by the Washington's Birthday Celebration in Laredo. In conferring the honor, the birthday association cited Sharp's long record of public service to his state.Ricardo R. Villarreal, \\"A&M; university system's chancellolr joins elite group\\", Laredo Morning Times, August 10, 2012, pp. 1, 7A Texas politics In 1990, Sharp was elected as the 35th State Comptroller of Public Accounts for the State of Texas. He was re-elected in 1994. In 1998, he did not seek a third term as comptroller but instead lost the race for lieutenant governor to Rick Perry, 50-48 percent. Sharp ran for lieutenant governor again in 2002, but was defeated 52-46 percent by David Dewhurst, then the Land Commissioner. Upon taking office as Comptroller, Sharp began working to fulfill his pledge to \\"make government work more like our most successful businesses.\\" During his eight years as Comptroller, Sharp established the Texas Performance Review (TPR), an ongoing audit on state government. During Sharp's two 4-year terms as Comptroller, the TPR identified more than $8.5 billion in taxpayer savings and changed the way government does business through such innovations as the Council on Competitive Government. Other innovative programs created and implemented by Sharp during these eight years included: * Texas School Performance Review: An outgrowth of TPR, this program has shown public school districts how to save more than $350 million, while keeping scarce education funds in the classroom where they belong and easing the burden on local taxpayers. * Texas Window on State Government: The official website for the Texas State Comptroller's Agency was a Sharp innovation during his time as Comptroller. This website ‚Äì whose stated purpose was to maximize the ability of citizens to engage with the Comptroller's Agency and to access public information more easily ‚Äì was the first of its kind in the United States, and has served as a model for other state agencies across the country. * The Texas Tomorrow Fund: A pre-paid college tuition plan that allows over 80,000 Texas families to lock in the future costs of their children's college at about what they would pay today. *Family Pathfinders: Sharp's 1995 welfare reform plan formed the heart of some of the most sweeping changes to public assistance in Texas history. It also led to another of Sharp's innovations‚ÄîFamily Pathfinders, which links welfare families with local civic clubs, congregations and businesses to help get jobs and leave the public assistance rolls behind. The Family Pathfinders website for Tarrant County, Texas (as an example) is here: *The Lone Star Card: First recommended by Sharp in 1991. This program spearheaded the nationwide switch from paper food stamp coupons to computerized bank-type cards and dramatically reduced fraud and abuse in the federal program. As Comptroller, Sharp also commanded the most successful state lottery start-up in U.S. history. With only 189 employees (compared to California's 1,000 and Florida's 750), Sharp's team put their first tickets on sale seven weeks early and set first-day, first-week, and first-year world sales records. By the time he turned the games over to the new Texas Lottery Commission, the state was $1 billion richer ‚Äì and Sharp had returned $81 million in unspent administrative funds. Sharp's blueprint for the Texas Lottery was later used by several American states as well as Mexico. In 2005, Sharp was asked to head an education task force ‚Äì called the Texas Tax Reform Commission ‚Äì charged with preparing a bi-partisan education plan for the state. The special session convened on April 17, 2006. Sharp accepted the offer and removed himself as a potential candidate for governor in 2006. The task force issued its final plan several months later, and the legislature adopted it. For his successful efforts, Sharp was later nominated by the Dallas Morning News for \\"Texan of the Year\\". Texas Proposition 15 In 2007, Sharp helped spearhead Texas Proposition 15, a proposed amendment to the Texas Constitution that sought to establish grants for cancer research, grants for cancer prevention and control programs in Texas to mitigate the incidence of cancer, and the purchase of laboratory facilities. Sharp acted as Treasurer for the supporting political action committee, Texans to Cure Cancer. Proposition 15 passed both houses of the Texas Legislature in May 2007 and was approved by the voters in November 2007 by a wide margin. Senate campaign On December 4, 2008, Republican U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison announced the creation of an exploratory committee for the Texas governor's race in 2010. Had she won the governorship, Hutchison would have been required to vacate her Senate seat by January 2011. If she were to stay in the Senate and not run for governor, she would have been up for re-election to the Senate in 2012. On December 8, 2008, Sharp became the first Democrat to announce his intention to run for this Senate seat, regardless of Hutchison's decision. Unlike several other candidates for the office, Sharp did not create an exploratory committee but immediately began raising funds and campaigning in 2009. On March 2, 2010, Hutchison lost the Republican gubernatorial nomination to incumbent Rick Perry, who subsequently won his third consecutive four-year term in the position. On January 7, 2011, Hutchison announced her retirement from the Senate, effective January 3, 2013. Because Sharp accepted the TAMU chancellor's position in 2011, he never ran for the Senate. The Democrats instead nominated former State Representative Paul Sadler, an attorney from Henderson, to contest the Hutchison seat. In a runoff election, the Republicans chose conservative lawyer Ted Cruz over Sharp's former interparty rival, Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst. Cruz then handily defeated Sadler in the November 6 general election. Had Sharp and Dewhurst been their respective party nominees, Texans would have seen a rematch between the two exactly ten years after Dewhurst defeated Sharp for lieutenant governor. The Texas A&M; University System On August 15, 2011, John Sharp was chosen as chancellor of the Texas A&M; University System, the second largest system of higher education in Texas, with a statewide network of 11 universities, seven state agencies, two service units and a comprehensive health science center. A&M; System members educate more than 131,000 students and reach another 22 million people through service each year. With more than 28,000 faculty and staff, the A&M; System has a physical presence in 250 of the state's 254 counties and a programmatic presence in every one. In 2012, externally funded research expenditures exceeded $783 million to help drive the state's economy. Leadership As chancellor of The Texas A&M; University System, Sharp has led multiple initiatives to improve efficiency, expand the presence of the A&M; System, and serve the needs of the state of Texas. Some of these initiatives are detailed below: * New Partnership Puts Texas A&M; on Top, Chancellor Says * Texas A&M; System and GlaxoSmithKline receive U.S. Government approval to establish influenza vaccine facility in Texas * Texas A&M; Deal to Outsource Campus Services Formalized * Texas A&M; System Awarded National Center for Innovation * Texas A&M; University officially acquires Texas Wesleyan University law school * Texas A&M; System Launches EmpowerU Website * Texas A&M; lays accountability path for graduation rates, cost effectiveness * Texas A&M; System implementing outsourcing at other campuses * Texas A&M; University System Saving $10 Million of Healthcare * Adding ‚ÄúTexas A&M;‚Äù To More A&M; System Agencies References External links *Chancellor John Sharp profile *John Sharp's curriculum vitae on the Ryan & Co website *\\"John Sharp Makes Campaign Visit\\" (Daily Tribune ‚Äì Mount Pleasant, TX, 09/04/09) *\\"Country Revival: How the straight-talking, coyote-shooting, tobacco-chewing John Sharp has led a bonanza at Texas A&M.;\\" (July 2017) *\\"McReynolds Endorses Sharp for U.S. Senate\\" (KTRE Lufkin/Nacogdoches (includes video feed), August 20, 2009) *\\"Sharp Argues for 'Bubbas' in Bid for Senate\\" (Cherokeean Herald, August 19, 2009) *\\"Senate Hopeful to Visit Longview\\" (East Texas Review, 07/08/09) *John Sharp interviewed by Evan Smith on \\"Texas Monthly Talks\\" (01/09) *\\"Working on a Dream: Let's Mark Dr. King's Birthday by Rekindling His Spirit of Public Service\\" (Written by John Sharp, Burnt Orange Report, 01-19-09) *\\"Sharp: Stop bailing out Wall Street, start giving Main Street mortgage relief\\" (Written by John Sharp, Rio Grande Guardian, December 30, 2008) *\\"Sharp: Don't play the educational blame game\\" (Written by John Sharp, Austin American-Statesman, December 20, 2008) *\\"East & South Texas State Legislators Back Sharp in Senate Race\\" (Capitol Annex, December 12, 2008) *\\"John Sharp: Let marketplace govern energy industry\\" (Written by John Sharp, San Antonio Express-News, June 28, 2008) *John Sharp is interviewed about the Texas Tax Reform Commission by Austin's KLRU-TV *\\"More Welfare Waste ‚Äì And A Lesson for Manufacturers\\" (John Sharp and creation of the Lone Star Card) (Evolving Excellence, November 13, 2006) *Text of Governor's Appointment of John Sharp To Lead Tax Reform Panel (November 22, 2005) *\\"State Comptroller elaborates on \`Lone Star Scholars' idea\\" (Amarillo Global News, January 23, 1998) *\\"The U.S. Reform Experience: The National Performance Review\\" (as inspired by John Sharp) (University of North Texas Libraries, 04/06/1997) *\\"Sharp Drops Smart Bomb\\" (Austin Chronicle, 02/09/1996) *\\"Texas Official Is Model for Gore's Public Parsimony\\" (New York Times, 09/12/1993) *\\"The Big Audit\\" (detailed story of John Sharp's creation of the Texas Performance Review) (State Legislatures, 06/03/1993) Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:People from Victoria County, Texas Category:Texas A&M; University alumni Category:Businesspeople from Texas Category:Texas Democrats Category:Politicians from Austin, Texas Category:Chancellors of Texas A&M; University System Category:Members of the Texas House of Representatives Category:Texas state senators Category:Members of the Railroad Commission of Texas Category:United States Army officers Category:American army personnel of the Vietnam War Category:Comptrollers of Texas ","title":"John Sharp (Texas politician)"},{"id":"13128547","text":"November 13, 1970: Cyclone kills over 300,000 people in Bangladesh; no survivors left on 13 islands south of the \\"X\\" November 16, 1970: Lockheed L-1011 TriStar makes first flightattribution: Jon Proctor November 17, 1970: The unmanned Soviet \\"bathtub-on-wheels\\" Lunokhod 1 becomes first rolling vehicle on the Moon November 13, 1970: Hafez al-Assad begins three decade rule of Syria; his son Bashar al-Assad (lower left) has ruled since 2000 The following events occurred in November 1970: November 1, 1970 (Sunday) *A fire killed 146 people at a dance hall outside of Saint-Laurent-du-Pont in France.\\"Dance Hall Fire Kills 142 Youths\\", Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, November 2, 1970, p1 Firefighters discovered upon arrival that the management of Club Cinq Sept had kept the emergency exits padlocked in order to keep people from entering the building without paying.

The configuration is like the neutron probe where an access tube made of PVC is installed in the soil; probes can also be modular (comb-like) and connected to a logger. The sensing head consists of an oscillator circuit, the frequency is determined by an annular electrode, fringe-effect capacitor, and the dielectric constant of the soil. Each capacitor sensor consists of two metal rings mounted on the circuit board at some distance from the top of the access tube. These rings are a pair of electrodes, which form the plates of the capacitor with the soil acting as the dielectric in between. The plates are connected to an oscillator, consisting of an inductor and a capacitor. The oscillating electrical field is generated between the two rings and extends into the soil medium through the wall of the access tube. The capacitor and the oscillator form a circuit, and changes in dielectric constant of surrounding media are detected by changes in the operating frequency. The capacitance sensors are designed to oscillate in excess of 100 MHz inside the access tube in free air. The output of the sensor is the frequency response of the soil‚Äôs capacitance due to its soil moisture level. Applications * One application for such a device is measuring the water content of soil, where the volume of water in the total volume of soil most heavily influences the dielectric permittivity of the soil because the dielectric of water (80) is much greater than the other constituents of the soil (mineral soil: 4, organic matter: 4, air: 1). When the amount of water changes in the soil, a probe will measure a change in capacitance due to the change in dielectric permittivity that can be directly correlated with a change in water content. Capacitance sensors are now widely used in irrigation scheduling in agriculture around the world. * Cure monitoring of Composite materials: Dielectric or capacitance sensors are used to measure the electrical response of thermoset resins and matrices of composite materials at specified depth over the sensor surface. The key model involved in the use of these sensors is the electric field model. The correspondence between electrical properties of the material within the field and the measurement (i.e. capacitance) is fundamental in interpreting the readings from the dielectric sensor. * Tip clearance measurement in turbomachinery testing. * The capacitance-sensors also can be used for the measuring of level of some solid materials in structures such as hoppers or silos.

She was shipwrecked on Fair Isle, Shetland, Scotland, on 27 September 1588. The 650-ton 38-gun ship sailed under the command and section flag of Juan G√≥mez de Medina and not ‚Äì as often quoted ‚Äì under the command of Don Alonso P√©rez de Guzm√°n el Bueno, 7th Duke of Medina Sidonia, Admiral of Spain and commanding officer of the Armada. She had been attacked by the Revenge and badly damaged right in the first meeting in the Channel, but managed somehow to escape into the open North Sea where she later met the rest of the beaten Armada. Because of leaks she had to run before the wind up the east coast of Britain. However, an unusually strong storm and the tides forced the ships to cross between Norway and the Northern Isles for about a week before they reached the Atlantic. Having the coast of Ireland nearly in sight, many ships were thrown back north by another storm. El Gran Grif√≥n, the Barca de Amburgo (a hulk, chartered from the City of Hamburg) and the Trinidad Valencera (1,100-tons, one of the biggest ships of the Armada) were separated from the remaining fleet. The Barca de Amburgo foundered south west of the Fair Isle, but was able to split her crew between El Gran Grifon and the Trinidad Valencera (later wrecked in Irish waters). Thus El Gran Grif√≥n carried 43 crew and 234 soldiers ‚Äì far more sailors and armed forces than standard. When El Gran Grif√≥n arrived at Fair Isle on 27 September 1588 trying to find a haven to effect repairs, she anchored in Swartz Geo, but the tide drove the ship ashore so that she wrecked on the rocks of Stroms Hellier. The crew and soldiers scrambled ashore, and were stranded on the isle for about two months before Andrew Umphray, the owner of Fair Isle, heard about the shipwrecked sailors and took Gomez de Medina to Quendale on the Shetland mainland where he stayed with Malcolm Sinclair of Quendale. Most of the Spanish sailors departed first for Orkney (where they are still remembered as the \\"Westray Dons\\"), and then to St Andrews and then to Edinburgh. 50 of the men died on Fair Isle either of their wounds or starvation or exposure and were buried in the \\"Spaniards' Grave\\". Half of the survivors were killed when their ship en route to Spain was attacked and sent aground by Dutch gunboats alerted by the English Navy (Queen Elizabeth had only promised that they would not be molested by English ships). The wreck of El Gran Grif√≥n was excavated by Colin Martin and Sydney Wignall in 1970. In 1984 a delegation from Spain planted an iron cross in the island's cemetery in remembrance of the sailors who had died there.

A line of business will often examine its position within an industry using a Porter five forces analysis (or other industry-analysis method) and other relevant industry information.  Computer applications  In the context of computing, a \\"line-of-business application\\" is one of the set of critical computer applications perceived as vital to running an enterprise. For example: > \\"Governance has become the hot topic in SOA over the past year. As > companies' SOA usage becomes real, widespread and line-of-business, the > requirement to ensure that the systems are properly governed has emerged as > the number one concern for SOA adopters.\\"  Mobile LOB  Mobile LOB refers to LOB applications running on mobile computers or PDAs - usually rugged for use in the field to process transaction at the site of the customer with minimum usage of paper.

Notable Hurlers *Henry Patton - Part of Derry's 1903 Ulster Senior Hurling Championship winning team (played for St. Patrick's) History Wolfhounds GAC Limavady was officially established in 1980. However, there had a been a history of Gaelic games in the area before the founding of the current club. In 1903 St Patrick's Limavady hurling club was set up; its star player Henry Patton won an Ulster medal as part of the Derry team that defeated Antrim in the 1903 Ulster Senior Hurling Championship final. Football was also played in Limavady, in the form of O'Connor's Limavady. They won the 1936 and 1941 Dr. Kerlin Cups beating Park (forerunner to the modern-day Banagher team) and Magilligan in the respective finals. The club also contested the Derry Senior Football Championship final in 1937??. Having won the 1938 North Derry Senior Football Championship, they were defeated by Lavey in the 1938 All-Derry Senior Championship semi-final. They reached the All-Derry final in 1941, but were defeated by Ballinascreen. In the late 1960s the St. Michaels GAC club was formed on the banks of the River Roe, from an amalgamation of players from the Limavady, Magilligan, and Glack areas, but later folded. Success came relatively soon for the Wolfhounds club, when in 1985 five years after their formation they won the Derry Junior Football Championship, Derry Junior League and Neil Carlin Cup. After moving up to Intermediate grade, the club won the 1989 Derry Intermediate Football Championship. The club were relegated to Junior level again in the 1990s and won the Derry Junior Championship twice more, in 1999 and 2003. Following on from this success the club are currently trying to maintain their position amongst the Intermediate ranks. The Wolfhounds enjoyed a prosperous 2018: winning the Derry Junior Treble of League, Championship and Neil Carlin Cup; winning a play-off game for promotion into Intermediate football and reaching the final of the Ulster Junior Championship. Dominic Woods and Noel McFeely assumed managerial roles at the beginning of the season, with Neil McCloy appointed in a coaching role. In particular, the season was marked by the introduction of Callum Brown into the senior side. Callum had previously represented Derry minors in an All- Ireland Final defeat to Kerry and his growing reputation across Ireland injected much excitement into the season's build-up. The anticipation was well-founded, with Callum often displaying feats of spectacular athletic ability and, in particular, putting forth a dominant display against a tough Ballerin side in an intermediate play-off game.

Homes of British Speedway. Brief history The team was initially nicknamed the Bears in 1939 by the club's general manager Vic Wieland. The track at Cleveland Park, which operated in the pioneer days of the late 1920s, was promoted by Albion Auto Racers of Stockport, Cheshire, ran sporadically throughout the 1930s and for a short spell in 1939, staged a couple of open meetings in 1945, then saw competitive league speedway from 1946 until 1948. The Bears won the Northern League in 1946 and Division Two in 1947 before the promotion moved to Newcastle in 1949. The Bears nickname was again used when the track re-opened in 1961 under the guidance of former rider turned promoter Reg Fearman, who was a multi track promoter and one of the brains behind setting up the Provincial League. At the end of the 1964 season the Bears team moved to Halifax and the track staged challenge matches in 1965 and under former captain Eric Boothroyd's promotion in 1966 before folding. The track was used in the 1950s for amateur / club events and midget car racing. The track opened again in 1968 but were renamed the Teesside Teessiders by promoter Ron Wilson who also ran Leicester although the record books incorrectly called them Middlesbrough Teessiders. They competed in the newly formed British League Division 2. In 1973 they were again renamed, this time as the Teesside Tigers and then Middlesbrough Tigers in 1979, which after 12 years turned out to be Wilson's final season as he had opened up a new track at Milton Keynes in 1978. In 1980 Mark Courtney became British Junior Champion at Canterbury's Kingsmead Stadium whilst he and Steve Wilcock won the British League Division 2 Riders Pairs Championship at Halifax the same season. During this period they became National League Champions in 1981 and losing Knockout Cup finalists to the homeless Berwick Bandits in a controversial last heat decider at Newcastle's Brough Park with the match result dependent on the aggregate score. They won back to back National League Fours Championship in 1985/6. Individual success occurred for Gary Havelock when he became British Junior Champion at Stoke in 1985 and Grand Slam Champion at Arena Essex in 1986. However a major arson attack on the club's main stand in June 1985 at their Cleveland Park Stadium was a catastrophe. Initially crowds were healthy but as the years went by and the club's fortunes on track dwindled the stand was never replaced by the greyhound owners and there were yearly rumours that the land on which it stood was to be sold for redevelopment. In 1989, the club reverted once again to the Middlesbrough Bears under a consortium until their permanent closure in 1996 when Cleveland Park was sold for re-development. The club had reached the final of the Knockout Cup in 1990 but were beaten by league champions Poole Pirates but were the only team to beat them twice that season. The promoter in 1968 Ron Wilson had changed the name to Teesside because he wanted it to be a new beginning and to take in the whole area not just Middlesbrough. Other promoters included Ken Knott, Wally Martin, Tim Swales & Malcolm Wright. Three riders enjoyed testimonials with the club for their long service: Pete Reading in 1977; Steve Wilcock in 1985 and Geoff Pusey in 1988. Individual successes were achieved in the league's championship with Graham Plant at Hackney in 1968 and Paul Bentley at Coventry in 1994. Andy Howe also won the inaugural Academy League Riders Championship at Long Eaton that same season. In 2003 the Bears came back at Hull's Craven Park albeit racing in junior events against two teams from Hull and one from Scunthorpe. They competed in the Humber League and East Riding Cup and also raced at various 'away' tracks including Belle Vue (Manchester), Buxton, Edinburgh, Glasgow, King's Lynn, Newcastle, Oxford, Scunthorpe, Sheffield & Workington. After two years using Hull as a 'home' track they then relocated to Newcastle's Brough Park when the Newcastle Gems folded. In 2006 a new track opened at South Tees Motorsport Park South Bank, Middlesbrough on the site of an old steelworks and entered the Premier League under the name Redcar Bears. A crowd of almost 5,000 turned up. A junior team known as the Cleveland Bays - named after a horse, competed in the Conference Shield against teams from Plymouth, Scunthorpe, Sittingbourne, Stoke & Weymouth. Promoters include Chris Van Straaten, Glyn Taylor, Brian Havelock, former junior riders Kevin Keay and Jitendra Duffill. Former rider and team manager Brian Havelock's eight year reign was tainted by three wooden spoon finishes and eighties junior Kevin Keay, whom had retired from the police force, was asked to take over. Team manager Jitendra Duffill was officially accepted as a co-promoter in September 2017. The club signed a 15-year lease with landowners Redcar & Cleveland Council at the back end of 2016 and competed in the renamed Championship in 2017 just failing to make the end of season play-offs. Keay stood down after just two seasons but still plays an active role in the club's training schools. Both Jade Mudgway and Jamie Swales were former junior riders who were added to the promotion. In 2019 the team reached the play - offs and were narrowly defeated by eventual champions Leicester at the semi final stages. However there was some consolation as the club were Knockout Cup Champions achieved against arch rivals Newcastle the first major team trophy in their existence. Individual successes also were also prevalent as Charles Wright became British Champion at Belle Vue whilst Erik Riss won the Championship Riders Championship at Sheffield's Owlerton Stadium. In 2020 the club like every other speedway team in the UK were unable to race due tom the Coronavirus Pandemic.

art throughout Germany and the Low Countries, especially during the late 15th and early 16th centuries. The Holy Kin were the extended family of Jesus descended from his maternal grandmother Saint Anne. According to this tradition, St. Anne, the mother of the Virgin Mary, was grandmother not just to Jesus but also to five of the twelve apostles: John the Evangelist, James the Greater, James the Less, Simon and Jude. These apostles, together with John the Baptist, were all cousins of Jesus. The genealogy holds that Anne‚Äôs sister, Hismeria (or Esmeria), was the mother of John the Baptist‚Äôs mother Elizabeth and of a second child, Eliud, who was in turn the grandfather of Servatius of Tongeren. The basis for this family tree rests upon the trinubium,Beda Kleinschmidt, Die heilige Anna. Ihre Verehrung in Geschichte, Kunst und Volkstum. 1930. the tradition that Anne had married three times. The exact lineage, as laid out in Jacobus da Varagine‚Äôs Golden Legend (Latin: Legenda Aurea), runs thus: :Anna solet dici tres concepisse Marias, :Quas genuere viri Joachim, Cleophas, Salomeque. :Has duxere viri Joseph, Alpheus, Zebedeus. :Prima parit Christum, Jacobum secunda minorem, :Et Joseph justum peperit cum Simone Judam, :Tertia majorem Jacobum volucremque Johannem.Jacobus de Voragine‚Äôs Golden Legend.

Details  The drivers of two vehicles reportedly wore federal military uniforms and carried official passes which allowed them through three successive military checkpoints on their way to the headquarters building. A guard at the fourth and final checkpoint attempted to inspect the vehicles, and began firing on the vehicles as they drove through the checkpoint towards the building. The explosion by the equivalent of a ton of dynamite brought down the roof and floors of the four- story building. The first reports said of as few as two dead. Ultimately, Chechen officials said 83 people were killed (48 on the spot) and 210 were injured. Several Chechen administration officials were injured in the attack, including Deputy Prime Minister Zina Batyzheva (seriously wounded) and Chechen Security Council Secretary Rudnik Dudayev. The head of the pro-Russian administration in Chechnya, Akhmad Kadyrov, and his Prime Minister, Mikhail Babich, were not in the building at the time.  Responsibility  Colonel Ilya Shabalkin, spokesman for the joint federal forces in Chechnya, said the bombing was organized by Chechen rebel field commanders Abu al-Walid and Shamil Basayev. Basayev claimed responsibility for the planning and execution of the attack, saying that he personally detonated the bomb by remote control. Some news reports called the attack an act of terrorism, which with 83 confirmed fatalities, would have been the deadliest terrorist attack in Chechnya. Others described the attackers as militants and rebels and not terrorists.

Burt (c. 1820 ‚Äì October 26, 1861) was an American physician, politician, and soldier. He served as the State Auditor of Mississippi, and was then a member of the Mississippi House of Representatives. During the American Civil War, he was a colonel in the Confederate States Army and was killed in action at the Battle of Ball's Bluff in Northern Virginia. He was known as ‚Äúthe Father of the Deaf and Dumb Institute of Mississippi‚Äù. Early life and career Erasmus Burt was born around 1820 in Edgefield County, South Carolina. He was one of ten children of Francis Burt, a member of South Carolina House of Representatives from 1798 to 1800, and Catherine Miles. His brothers included Armistead Burt (November 16, 1802 ‚Äì October 30, 1883), who was elected to Congress in 1843 for South Carolina and served until 1853 and who was married to the niece of John C. Calhoun, and Francis Burt (January 13, 1807 - October 18, 1854), who served in Washington, D.C. as the Third Auditor of the Treasury, and in 1854 was appointed the first Territorial Governor of Nebraska. Erasmus and two other brothers, Matthew and Oswell, studied medicine in Alabama. Dr. Matthew Burt practiced medicine in Jacksonville, Alabama, where he died in 1839. Oswell E. Burt moved to Alabama where he founded the town of Alexandria, and then moved to Texas. Erasmus Burt first practiced medicine in Calhoun county, Alabama and then moved to Mississippi. On September 16, 1840, in Jacksonville, Alabama, Erasmus married Lucy Ann Morgan (October 22, 1821 ‚Äì c. 1887), the daughter of George Washington Morgan and Mary Frances Irby. By 1845 he was practicing medicine in Oktibbeha County, Mississippi, and became a member of the House of Representatives representing Oktibbeha County, and State Auditor. While chairman of the Committee on Claims and a member of the Committee of Education he was instrumental in founding the Mississippi Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb in 1854. Civil War service When the war broke out, Burt raised a regiment for the Confederate side known as the \\"Burt Rifles,\\" which became Company K of the 18th Mississippi Infantry on April 22, 1861, starting with the rank of captain. He was made a colonel on June 7, 1861. They first saw action at the First Battle of Manassas on July 21, 1861. At the Battle of Ball's Bluff near Leesburg, Virginia, he led his men in an attack on a Union artillery battery, but his regiment was caught in a crossfire by nearby enemy infantry. Burt was shot through his hip by a bullet which entered his stomach. His men were so enraged by his loss that they helped drive the Federals into the Potomac River where a number of them drowned. He was taken into Harrison Hall in Leesburg, Virginia. Burt was promoted to general for his bravery, but died before the promotion was received. His body was taken back to Jackson, Mississippi, where he was buried. He had eight children, and after his death his wife and younger children were moved back to Alabama by his widow‚Äôs family.

Geography The municipality comprises the villages of Bartenshagen, Parkentin, Huetten, Neuhof and Bollbruecke. Bartenshagen-Parkentin lies between Bad Doberan and the Hanseatic city of Rostock. The municipality has two parts: Bartenshagen lies on the slightly raised area of basal moraine of Haegerort approximately 7 km from the Baltic See. Parkentin lies approximately 3 km south from the centre of Bartenshagen. The municipality is characterised by farmland, predominantly used for arable farming. South of Parkentin near Neuhof and north of Bollbruecke there are some areas of meadowland. The southwest of the municipality is dominated by the Huetter Wohld, containing many artificial fish-ponds, of which approx. 180 Hectares lie within the municipality. The highest point of the municipality (80m above mean sea level) lies in Huetter Wohld, on the boundary to Ivendorf. The terrain falls northeast from this point over Huetten (35m) to the mouth of the Waidbach at 22m. The largest tarn in the municipality, resulting from peat extraction is to be found here. The terrain then rises to Parkentin (26m) and then falls in a northerly direction. The lowest point (6m) is to be found on the northeast municipality boundary to Bargeshagen on the B105. The Rotbach also traverses the municipality at this point. At the western edge, on the boundary to Bad Doberan there is a 78 Hectare part of the Walkmueller Holz. The Stege, which is formed by the Waidbach south of Parkentin, flows in a northerly direction through the 3.3 km-long linear village of Bartenhagen. In the south of the municipality lies the former landfill site belonging to the city of Rostock, which was closed in 2000 and presents a noticeable hill covering around 26 Hectares. History Parkentin was first recorded in 1177 and until 1552 belonged to the monastery at Bad Doberan. The church was built in multiple stages, beginning in the 13th Century. The oldest part is the Choir. Frescos from the 15th Century were discovered in 1899 and have been restored. A late addition is the tower with four gables. The pulpit is from 1615. Parkentin parish church Around 1300 Rabenhorst (Rethwisch) also belonged for a time to the parish. In 1333 Duke Albrecht the 2nd gave the control over Parkentin to the cloister. After the secularisation and the disbandment of the monastery control over the parish returned to the dukedom. The first evangelical pastor appointed by the duke and not the monastery was Brand Meseke in 1557. The hamlet of Huetten was first recorded in 1268. In Huetter Wohld, an extensive beech wood, the monks from Bad Doberan found ideal conditions for fish ponds and created a string of many reservoirs, which are still in use today. Due to the local availability of quartz sand and the forest for fuel, a glassworks (Glashuette in German, leading to the name Huetten) was operated by the monks from 1268. The hamlet of Neuhof was first recorded in 1383 and added to the parish of Parkentin in 1927. Transport The northern end of Bartenshagen adjoins the Bundesstrasse 105 between Rostock and Bad Doberan. Parkentin lies on the railway line from Tessin/Rostock to Wismar. Bus routes link the municipality to Bad Doberan and Rostock.

In early 1998 it was announced that the stadium was to be sold for housing development and the club would have to vacate immediately. The proposed development never took place, and there was an unsuccessful attempt to reopen the site for speedway racing in 2005.

Geography  The municipality runs from the Baltic Sea coast for almost 5 km southeast into the interior. Within its territory is the Conventer See, an old bay whose outlet to the Baltic has silted up turning it into a lake. The lake is a nature reserve which is known for its variety of waders and water fowl. To the west of B√∂rgerende is Germany's oldest seaside resort, Heiligendamm. As well as B√∂rgerende and Rethwisch, the villages of Bahrenhorst and Neu Rethwisch are also part of the municipality.  History  The Old Barn (Alte Scheune) in Rethwisch The village of Rethwisch was first documented in 1297. In 1299, a clergyman from Doberan Abbey was installed in Rabenhorst. In the war damage assessment of 1312 of the damage caused by the conflict between Rostock's townsfolk under Nicholas and the troops of Henry the Lion an administrator (magister curie) of Doberan Abbey, a cemetery and a sexton were mentioned in connexion with the place. In addition to the administrator, there were at that time about twenty households in the village, all of which had German names. In 1353 comes the first record of a capella Redwisch (Rethwisch Chapel) and, one year later a ecclesia Redewisch (Rethwisch Church). Reference is made to the fact that the church was previously located in Rabenhorst, but had moved its seat to Rethwisch. After the Reformation the abbey's estate was transferred in 1552 to the Domanialverband (territorial union) of the local lords. The independent municipalities of B√∂rgerende and Rethwisch were merged on 20 June 1957 and, at the same time, transferred from the district of Rostock Land to the newly formed Bad Doberan. The largest hotel in GDR times was the FDGB holiday home, the Hotel Waterkant. It was opened on 11 August 1976 and had 462 beds, a restaurant with 240 seats, a swimming pool and several medical facilities. The building soon stood empty after the Wende and the ruins were demolished in 2008. On its site is a new residential area with detached and terraced houses. A relict from the East German era is the listed Baltic Sea watchtower, one of the two surviving coastal watchtowers on the Baltic Sea. Artists working with ceramics, graphics and pictorial art display their works for tourists in the Art Barn or Kunst-Scheune.  Rethwisch Church  The church dates to the early 14th century. It is triple-aisled and made of granite and fieldstone, the west tower is wooden. The oldest parts of the carved altar date to the 15th century. The ambry is in the shape of a pinnacle turret.

History For the first half-century of its existence, the United Nations felt protected by its flag and the reality that it was a neutral, benevolent actor in world events. If United Nations personnel were directly targeted, it was generally viewed as an isolated event. In the early 1990s, the security environment for the United Nations changed and became more threatening. There was a rise in the number of deaths and injuries to personnel as a result of malicious acts. The mandate of the United Nations also evolved, resulting in a larger number of United Nations personnel, notably from the humanitarian agencies, being deployed on potentially hazardous missions. At the same time, peacekeeping missions were being established in areas at war or in situations of high risk. Increasingly, humanitarian personnel were being deployed alongside peacekeeping military units in integrated multidisciplinary missions. An evolving security management system : The UN's security management system was designed for the operational requirements which existed in the UN's early days. By the 1990s, the system was no longer able to fulfill its responsibilities adequately, despite the best efforts and dedication of all those involved. To allow the United Nations to meet new demands in a changing environment, the General Assembly authorized an increase in the staff of the Office of the United Nations Security Coordinator (UNSECOORD), primarily in the field. In 2001, the General Assembly authorized the creation of a full- time United Nations Security Coordinator at the level of Assistant Secretary- General. By 2002, the number of professional security officer posts in the field numbered 100 Professional and 200 locally recruited posts. The United Nations Security Coordinator oversaw the activities of the UN field security management system and was a senior official appointed by the Secretary- General. The Office was responsible for all policy and procedural matters related to security; ensuring a coherent response by the United Nations to any emergency situation; coordinating, planning and implementing inter-agency security programmes and acting as the focal point for inter-agency cooperation concerning all security matters and, on behalf of the Secretary-General, taking all decisions related to the relocation/evacuation of personnel and their eligible dependents from very insecure areas. In addition to UNSECOORD, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) had in place its own separate security structure for civilian personnel in UN peacekeeping operations. Political missions of the Department of Political Affairs that were administratively backstopped by DPKO remained under the UN field security management system. Each of the major UN locations around the world had their own Security and Safety Services which operated independently from the UN security management system and from any central direction. The Security and Safety Service (SSS) was first established at UN Headquarters in 1948. For decades, SSS in New York and at seven other Secretariat headquarters locations around the world (Geneva, Vienna, Nairobi, Bangkok, Beirut, Addis Ababa and Santiago), operated independently of each other and had no common governance structure. Their role was to provide security and safety for headquarters personnel, premises and operations at those locations, as well to protect delegates and visitors to the premises and provide personal security details for senior United Nations officials and visiting dignitaries. Between 2002 and 2003, efforts were made by the United Nations Security Coordinator to professionalize the Organization's security for its personnel through improved recruitment and training, and to institutionalize security coordination among United Nations agencies, Funds, and Programmes through the establishment of an Inter-Agency Security Management Network (IASMN). However, security structures in PKOs and SPMs, as well as in SSS locationscontinued to function as separate entities to the structure in place for the field. In early August 2003, independent security experts carried out an analysis of the UN security management system and concluded that the development and implementation of an overall security governance and accountability framework, including Headquarters, humanitarian and development personnel and civilian personnel in peacekeeping missions would lead to a strengthened and unified security management system. The Ahtisaari panel : Despite the growing security concerns and the efforts to address them the UN Headquarters at the Canal Hotel in Baghdad was attacked on 19 August 2003, which came as a devastating shock. The attack, carried out by a suicide bomber driving a truck filled with explosives, killed 22 United Nations personnel and visitors, including SRSGT De Mello,and injured more than 150 people. The attack was the first significant and targeted attack against the United Nations calling to attention the limited coordination and cohesion of security provisions for UN staff and premises globally. The attacks led to an urgent second review of the security system by the Independent Panel on the Safety and Security of United Nations Personnel, known as the Ahtisaari panel. ‚ÄúThe United Nations could, in theory, be the target of attacks anywhere at any time, from Baghdad to Kabul, Nairobi, Jakarta, Geneva or New York. There are no indications that the perpetrators of the attacks in Baghdad would refrain from attacking other UN targets worldwide.‚Äù ‚Äì Ahtisaari Panel report. The Ahtisaari panel called for a new, drastically revised security strategy for the United Nations. The panel recommended that the core elements of the new strategy include clear articulation of the responsibilities of the United Nations to ensure the security of its personnel; the establishment of professional assessment tools for the analysis of threat and risks for United Nations operations worldwide; a robust security management system with adequate disciplinary measures to counter non-compliance; accountability at all managerial levels for the implementation of security regulations; and significant increases in resources to develop and maintain the necessary security infrastructure. UNDSS is born A concerted effort was subsequently made across the United Nations system to overhaul and improve staff security arrangements. In 2004, a radical proposal for strengthening and unifying the United Nations security management system was presented to the 59th session of the General Assembly in Report A/59/365 of 11 October 2004. This resulted in the adoption of General Assembly Resolution (A/RES/59/276 December 2004) that created the Department of Safety and Security which merged the security management component of the Office of the United Nations Security Coordinator (UNSECOORD) and the Security and Safety Services (SSS) at Headquarters and at Offices away from Headquarters, (including the regional commissions),. Furthermore, the Resolution mandated that the new Department be headed by a senior UN official at the rank of Under-Secretary-General for a non-renewable term of five years. The General Assembly also adopted measures to reinforce security operations in all locations and decided to establish a unified capacity for policy, standards, coordination, communications, compliance and threat and risk assessment. The United Nations Department of Safety and Security (UNDSS) was formally established on 1 January 2005.

Geography Elmenhorst/Lichtenhagen is located in the \\"H√§gerortes\\" district, between the lower reaches of the little Warnow River and Bad Doberan, close to the Baltic Sea (known in German as the East Sea) coast. The municipality includes nearly a kilometer of protected nature reserve along the Stoltera cliffs. History A settlement round a green called Lichtenhagen is recorded from 1264 in connection with a church appointment, and the church itself has a surviving mention from 1319, by which time the church had already been built. At the start of the fourteenth century Lichtenhagen was held by the von Gummern family. A branch of the von Schnakenburg family, which had been based in nearby Diedrichshagen till 1359 was also here. By the second half of the fifteenth century Lichtenhagen was at least in part the property of a man called Nikolaus Hasenkop and of his sons Hermann and Nikolaus. However, in a document dated 3 January 1505 the widow of Klaus, the last of the von Gummern land owners here, transferred several fiefs including Lichtenhagen to Duke Balthasar of Mecklenburg and his nephew, Duke Henry of Mecklenburg. A generation later, in 1531, Hans von Gummern who was a nephew of Klaus undertook a litigation to recover the lands transferred by his uncle's widow, but his case failed. Lichtenhagen therefore remained within a ducal domain. The first surviving record of \\"Elmenhorst\\" dates from 1320 at which time it was a village settlement strung along a single street. In 1960 Elmenhorst and Lichtenhagen were formally merged for administrative purposes, and in January 1992 the name of the combined municipality was changed to Elmenhorst/Lichtenhagen. Church Economy The economy of the place is defined by the proximity of the Baltic Sea, which supports tourism, and of Rostock which is where many of the citizens work. The name \\"Elmenhorst\\" is also known in the region for the \\"Elmenhorster Fruchtsaftgetr√§nke GmbH\\", a company involved in the extraction, bottling and distribution of fruit juice.

Ishige was drafted by the Lotte Orions in the third round of the 1974 NPB draft, but went to college instead. He won a Tokyo Metropolitan University League batting title and made six Best Nines in college. He was then picked in the first round of the 1980 NPB draft by the Seibu Lions. Ishige made the All-Star team as a rookie with Seibu and would make it all 14 seasons he was with them. He hit .311/.380/.531 that first year with 21 homers and 25 steals (in 34 tries). He won a Gold Glove, made his first Best Nine and won Rookie of the Year honors. Ishige's production slipped to a .259/.337/.401 line in 1982 though he stole 22 in 26 tries and won a Gold Glove and Best Nine. He hit .296/.321/.370 in his first Japan Series, to help Seibu take the 1982 Series but was thrown out in two of three steal attempts. In 1983, Ishige hit .303/.593/.503 with 29 steals in 34 tries, hit 16 homers, scored 86 runs, won another Gold Glove, earned a third Best Nine spot and tied Yutaka Fukumoto and Hiromi Matsunaga for the PL lead with 7 triples. He hit .276/.276/.379 as Seibu won another Japan Series, but was 0 for 1 in steals. The next year, Ishige batted .259/.338/.498 with 91 runs, 26 homers and 26 steals (in 36 tries); Keijiro Yumioka beat him out for the Best Nine that time. While he only stole 11 bases (in 14 tries) in 1985, Ishige remained a potent offensive force, chipping in at a .280/.386/.508 clip with 96 runs, 27 homers and 88 walks. His 26 doubles led the league and he won another Gold Glove and Best Nine. In the 1985 Japan Series, Hiromichi hit .208/.296/.583 with 3 home runs in a losing effort. Ishige won his MVP in 1986, when he batted .329/.386/.531, won another Gold Glove at short, scored 91 runs, drove in 89, smacked 27 home runs and stole 19 bases. He set a Nippon Pro Baseball record by leading off eight games with home runs and set a Seibu club record with a 23-game hitting streak. He hit .297/.297/.405 as Seibu won a hard- fought 1986 Japan Series over the Hiroshima Carp. In '87, Hiromichi hit .269/.331/.370 in an off-year but still won a Gold Glove and made the Best Nine. He batted .348/.423/.652 in the 1987 Japan Series to win his fourth ring. That winter, he assumed chairmanship of the board of directors of the Japan Professional Baseball Players Association, replacing Hiromitsu Ochiai; two years later, Akinobu Okada would take the role. The 31-year-old had his third and last 20-20 year in 1988 (21 HR, 22 SB in 26 tries; he would never hit 20 homers again) and batted .283/.364/.441 and won his 7th Gold Glove. He had his best Series, the 1989 Japan Series, hitting .389/.389/.944 with 3 HR, 5 runs and 6 RBI in five games to win the Series MVP award. In '89, Ishige stole 28 in 33 tries for his final 20-steal season and batted .270/.395/.428. He drew 98 walks, a career-best and led the PL in that category. Ishige hit .298/.364/.429 in 1990 and was 7 for 8 in steals. Now a third baseman, he fielded .991, a Pacific League record for the position. He went 1 for 12 in the 1990 Japan Series but drew four walks as his club won a sixth Series. At one point, he had hit in 17 straight games in a Japan Series, a record. In '91, the veteran still produced at a .269/.331/.424 rate and he hit .280/.333/.440 in the 1991 Japan Series, Seibu's seventh victory in his time with the club. He won his first Gold Glove in three years. In 1992, Ishige batted .297/.359/.413, won a Gold Glove and made his seventh Best Nine, the first in five years. He hit .240/.286/.440 as Seibu took the 1992 Japan Series for their eighth Series win in his 12 seasons, marking it as the greatest Pacific League dynasty ever ‚Äî other key contributors in the run had included Koji Akiyama, Kimiyasu Kudoh, Hisanobu Watanabe, Orestes Destrade, Kazuhiro Kiyohara, Taigen Kaku, Osamu Higashio, and Tetsuya Shiozaki. Ishige was the captain of the team during the last stretch of Series victories at least. Destrade recalls that Ishige was the team's motivator. Ishige continued to produce as the 36-year-old put up a .306/.389/.479 batting line in 1993, won his last Gold Glove and made his final Best Nine. He hit .304/.385/.304 in the 1993 Japan Series as Seibu fell in 7 games to the Yakult Swallows to end their dynastic run. In '94, Hiromichi hit .266/.335/.397 and made his last All-Star appearance. He went 1 for 12 with three walks in the 1994 Japan Series. Leaving Seibu after 14 All-Star seasons and 8 titles in 14 years, Ishige moved on to the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks, where the 38-year-old hit .200/.260/.275 to signal that his glory days were definitely gone. Fellow faded star Matsunaga was the primary third baseman that year. In 1996, Ishige concluded his playing career by going 3 for 23 for Daiei. Overall, Ishige hit .283/.362/.450 in 7,570 plate appearances, cracked 236 homers and stole 243 in 314 tries. Through 2006, Hiromichi ranks 25th all-time in NPB in runs (1,049, 10 behind Matsunaga), 18th in sacrifice bunts (218; manager Masahiko Mori often had him bunt as he felt Ishige hit into too many double plays in the clutch. Destrade, on the other hand, described him as a timely player who drove in key runs, showing how different perceptions of \\"clutch play\\" can be) and 22nd in strikeouts (1,127). With one more year as a regular, he likely would have been in the top 30 in walks as well. After retiring as a player, Ishige was a minor league manager for Seibu for two years then spent a year as a commentator for NHK in 1999. When manager Akira Ohgi was let go after the 2001 season, the Orix BlueWave hired Ishige to replace him as manager. The club fell from above-.500 in '01 to 50-87-3 and last place. The next year, they started poorly and Ishige lambasted high-strikeout sluggers Fernando Seguignol and Scott Sheldon. After a 7-12-1 start, Ishige was let go and they brought in Leon Lee as the new manager, the first African-American manager in NPB history. Lee fared no better with the sorry lot and they finished last again. In 2005, Ishige founded the independent Shikoku Island League (now known as Shikoku Island League Plus).

The Church Reform of Peter I introduced what some believe was a period of Caesaropapism in the history of the Russian Orthodox Church, when the church apparatus effectively became a department of state. Background Previously, the Russian Tsars had exerted some influence on church operations; however, until Peter's reforms the church had been relatively free in its internal governance. Following the model of the Byzantine Empire, the Tsar was considered to be the \\"Defender of Orthodoxy\\". In this capacity he had the right of veto over the election of new bishops, and upon the consecration of new bishops he would often be the one to present the crozier to them. The Tsar would also be involved in major ecclesiastical decisions. In 1551, Tsar Ivan IV summoned the Synod of a Hundred Chapters (–°—Ç–æ–≥–ª–∞–≤—ã–π –°–æ–±–æ—Ä), which confirmed the inviolability of church properties and the exclusive jurisdiction of ecclesiastical courts over clergy, and the norms of church life were regulated. The Great Synod of Moscow in 1666-1667 was also presided over by the Tsar. Peter the Great ended up losing the support of the Russian clergy over his reforms. Local hierarchs became very suspicious of Peter's friendship with foreigners, the shaving of his beard, and his alleged Protestant propensities. The Tsar did not abandon Orthodoxy as the main ideological core of the state, but attempted to start a process of westernization of the clergy, relying on those with a Western theological education, although Peter at the same time remained faithful to the canons of the Eastern Orthodox Church. Peter unintentionally caused \\"Ukrainization\\" of the Russian Church, inviting Ukrainian and Belorussian clergy (mostly graduates of the Kiev-Mohyla Academy) from the buffer regions of the Empire into Russia. As a result of this, by the middle of the 18th century the majority of the Russian Orthodox Church was headed by people from Ukraine (Little Russia or Galicia). Between 1700 and 1762, out of the 127 hierarchs who headed cathedrals in Russia 70 were from Ukraine and only 47 from other regions of Russia. Reforms Patriarch Adrian. Peter I, known as \\"Peter the Great\\" (ruled 1682‚Äì1725), ushered in an era in which the church government was fundamentally transformed: instead of being governed by a patriarch or metropolitan, the government of the church came under the control of a committee known as the Most Holy Governing Synod, which was composed both of bishops and lay bureaucrats appointed by the Emperor. Tsar Peter inflicted numerous reforms on his country that were designed to create and pay for a new government and a military and naval system that would enable Russia to trade with, compete with, and, as necessary defend Russia's European interests by force of arms. The ruthlessness with which he implemented his governmental and tax collection reforms, and the forced buildup of his new capital city, St. Petersburg, augured poorly for the independence of the church. Archbishop Theophan Prokopovich, Peter's ally in his reform of the Russian Orthodox Church. When Patriarch Adrian (in office 1690‚Äì1700) died in October 1700, Peter prevented the election of a new patriarch, and instead appointed Stephen Yavorsky as patriarchal \\"exarch\\", locum tenens, or, literally, the custodian of the patriarchal throne (–º—ñ—Å—Ü–µ–±–ª—é—Å—Ç–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å –ø–∞—Ç—Ä—ñ–∞—Ä—à–æ–≥–æ –ø—Ä–µ—Å—Ç–æ–ª—É).–£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Ü—ñ, —è–∫—ñ —Å—Ç–≤–æ—Ä–∏–ª–∏ —ñ–º–ø–µ—Ä—ñ—é. –ß–∞—Å—Ç–∏–Ω–∞ 1 - —ñ–¥–µ–æ–ª–æ–≥ –ü—Ä–æ–∫–æ–ø–æ–≤–∏—á Yavorskii was a young professor from the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy of a breakaway region of the Polish- Lithuanian Commonwealth also known as Cossack Hetmanate, who had trained at a Jesuit academy in Poland, and who argued in favor of a strong patriarchate and the independence of the church. He headed the church together with a bishop council, however his powers were very limited, as for example all church property was under administration of Monastical prikaz (see prikaz) which was out of the church jurisdiction. As a result, monasteries became the main nests of opposition and in order to fight them the government prohibited monks to keep in their cells pen and paper. Yavorsky who might have been thinking of becoming a patriarch himself was not fully supportive of Peters ideas to \\"bureaucritise\\" by introducing a system of collegiate. Yavorsky publicly declared his opposition to introduce civil procurators-fiscal (as in Scotland) in church courts. After Yavorsky became close with supporters of Alexei Petrovich, Tsarevich of Russia who was in opposition to his father Peter the Great dismissed Yavorsky. Metropolitan Stephen Yavorsky Gradually, Peter came to favor another professor from the Kiev's Academy, Theofan Prokopovich, whose 1721 Spiritual Regulation supported the concept of a Russian national church under the authority of the Tsar as the \\"supreme bishop\\", and argued that an ecclesiastical council would be more appropriate to govern the church than a single patriarch. It seemed dubious to Prokopovich to have a dual power in the Russian Empire and was supportive of the idea of a single and an ultimate autocrat. Among the Russian clergy, however, Prokopovich was perceived as a Lutheranist and a Calvinist as person who studied protestantism and who did not mature in the culture of the Eastern Orthodoxy. Against him energetically protested the rector of the Moscow Academy Theophilakt Lopatinsky when Prokopovich was appointed the Metropolitan of Pskov. In 1721, Peter established the Ecclesiastical College to govern the church (\\"college\\", or kollegia, a word borrowed from the Swedish governmental system, was the term Peter used for his government ministries, each one headed by a committee instead of a single minister). The Ecclesiastical College was soon renamed the Holy Governing Synod, and was administered by a lay director, or Ober- Procurator. The Synod changed in composition over time, but basically it remained a committee of churchmen headed by a lay appointee of the Emperor. Legacy Monasteries lost territory and were more closely regulated, resulting in a reduction in the number of monks and nuns in Russia from roughly 25,000 in 1734 to around 14,000 in 1738. The Church ‚Äî particularly monasteries ‚Äî lost land and wealth gradually during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but under Empress Catherine II (\\"Catherine the Great\\", ruled 1762‚Äì1796) monastic lands were effectively nationalised, with some one million peasants on monastery land becoming state serfs practically overnight. A new ecclesiastic educational system was begun under Peter the Great and expanded to the point that by the end of the century there was a seminary in each eparchy (diocese). However, the curriculum for the clergy heavily emphasised Latin language and subjects, closer to the curriculum of Jesuit academies in Poland, focusing lightly on the Greek language and the Eastern Church Fathers, and lighter still on the Russian and Slavonic church languages. This resulted in more monks and priests being formally educated than before, but receiving poor training in preparation for a ministry to a Russian-speaking population steeped in the traditions of Eastern Orthodoxy. Catherine even made sure that the salaries of all ranks of the clergy were paid by the state instead of the Church, resulting in the clergy effectively becoming employees of the state. The Russian patriarchate was not restored until 1917, when the All-Russian Council (Sobor) elected St. Tikhon as Patriarch of Moscow. Although several commissions of the Synod had planned for a church council since 1905, Tsar Nicholas II believed a council would be destabilizing. After the February Revolution and the abdication of the Tsar on 15 March, the Synodal higher church authority under the provisional government convened the council, which opened on 15 August (28 August NS), the Dormition of the Virgin. The assembly continued meeting despite the onset of the October Revolution, electing Patriarch St. Tikhon on 5 November 1917. Many other issues were deliberated and decided at the council, including decentralizing the church administration, allowing women to participate in church governance, and determining that priests and laity would have a voice in church councils alongside bishops. The Petrine Synodal higher church authority and the Ober- Procurator were abolished forever.

Military career Towle joined the United States Army from his birth city of Cleveland, Ohio in March 1943, during World War II,WWII Army Enlistment Records He volunteered for the paratroopers, part of the U.S. Army's fledgling airborne forces, and was assigned to Company 'C' of the 1st Battalion, 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment (504th PIR), part of the 82nd \\"All American\\" Airborne Division. On September 21, 1944, during Operation Market Garden, near Oosterhout in the Netherlands during the operation, Towle engaged a German force with his rocket launcher in an attempt to disable two enemy tanks and a half-track. He was killed during the battle. He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor six months later, on March 15, 1945. Towle, aged 19 at his death, was buried at Calvary Cemetery in his hometown of Cleveland, Ohio. Legacy Private Towle's official Medal of Honor citation reads: > For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of life above and > beyond the call of duty on 21 September 1944, near Oosterhout, Holland. The > rifle company in which Pvt. Towle served as rocket launcher gunner was > occupying a defensive position in the west sector of the recently > established Nijmegen bridgehead when a strong enemy force of approximately > 100 infantry supported by 2 tanks and a half-track formed for a > counterattack. With full knowledge of the disastrous consequences resulting > not only to his company but to the entire bridgehead by an enemy > breakthrough, Pvt. Towle immediately and without orders left his foxhole and > moved 200 yards in the face of intense small-arms fire to a position on an > exposed dike roadbed. From this precarious position Pvt. Towle fired his > rocket launcher at and hit both tanks to his immediate front. Armored > skirting on both tanks prevented penetration by the projectiles, but both > vehicles withdrew slightly damaged. Still under intense fire and fully > exposed to the enemy, Pvt. Towle then engaged a nearby house which 9 Germans > had entered and were using as a strongpoint and with 1 round killed all 9. > Hurriedly replenishing his supply of ammunition, Pvt. Towle, motivated only > by his high conception of duty which called for the destruction of the enemy > at any cost, then rushed approximately 125 yards through grazing enemy fire > to an exposed position from which he could engage the enemy half-track with > his rocket launcher. While in a kneeling position preparatory to firing on > the enemy vehicle, Pvt. Towle was mortally wounded by a mortar shell. By his > heroic tenacity, at the price of his life, Pvt. Towle saved the lives of > many of his comrades and was directly instrumental in breaking up the enemy > counterattack. The USNS Private John R. Towle (T-AK-240) was named in his honor. Towle Fitness Center in Fort Bragg, North Carolina was named in his honor. The citizens of Oosterhout marched in a parade in Private Towle's honor and renamed a street in the village after him on the morning of Sept. 21, 2019, on the 75th anniversary of his heroism and their liberation. thumb See also *List of Medal of Honor recipients *List of Medal of Honor recipients for World War II References  Category:1924 births Category:1944 deaths Category:American army personnel killed in World War II Category:United States Army Medal of Honor recipients Category:Military personnel from Cleveland Category:United States Army soldiers Category:Burials in Calvary Cemetery (Cleveland, Ohio) Category:World War II recipients of the Medal of Honor ","title":"John R.

It was the Guinness Book of World Records record holder for the world's largest rotating globe until 1999, when it was succeeded by Eartha. It was built over a period of six years by Orfeo Bartolucci, with the stated goal of diffusing a message of peace and liberty to all people. It measures 10 metres in diameter and is reported to weigh 170 quintals, or 17,000 kilograms. Reportedly 250 quintals of putty, 30 cubic metres of wood, and a ton (unclear whether English or Metric) of nails were used in its construction. The globe is located outdoors and has a fibreglass skin. It can hold approximately 600 people and internally contains descriptive tables listing every country of the world and their flag. Bartolucci, formerly a mason and later a building contractor by trade, reports that he had the inspiration for the globe during a visit to the Ducal Palace in Venice during the 1970s. The palace contained ‚Äì among other exhibits ‚Äì a globe 2 metres in diameter, and Bartolucci became interested in building a larger one. Upon inquiring of the large publishing house Mondadori in Verona, he was informed that the Guinness Book of World Records reported a globe of 8 metres in diameter at Babson College in Massachusetts. Wanting to take the record, Bartolucci decided on a diameter of ten metres. Bartolucci solicited information about the Babson globe, and found out that it had issues with weather resistance that had led to deterioration over time, and that the methods used for its construction would cost Bartolucci approximately 500 million lire. This information influenced his design decisions. For six years, Bartolucci worked from 5 A.M. until dusk, using his pension income and accumulated savings but not borrowing any funds. The inauguration ceremony for the globe drew an official representative of the state and an audience of about seven thousand people. Bartolucci also constructed several other interesting artifacts, including a globe 5 mm in diameter.

The UNLP is issued to UN and ILO staff as well as staff members of international organizations such as the WHO, the IAEA, the World Tourism Organization, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization Preparatory Commission, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the World Trade Organization, the International Monetary Fund, the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and the World Bank. The document is written in English and French, working languages of United Nations. The UNLP is a valid travel document, which can be used like a national passport (in connection with travel on official missions only). However, UNLP holders often encounter immigration officials who are unfamiliar with the document and require them to show a national passport in addition. As with national passports, some countries/regions accept it for entry without the need for a visa (e.g., Kenya, the United Kingdom, Schengen Area, Lebanon, etc.), while other countries may require a visa before it can be accepted for entry to the country (depending on the nationality of the UNLP holder). Most officials hold a blue UNLP (up to D-1 level), which is similar in legal status to a service passport. A red UNLP is issued to particularly high officials (D-2 and above), and confers similar status to a diplomatic passport holder. Name and signature page A data page has a visual zone and a machine-readable zone. The visual zone has a photograph of the holder, data about the passport, and data about the LP holder much similar to a normal passport. The nationality and place of birth of the passport holder is not mentioned in a UNLP, but the UN is used in fields similar to issuing country. * Photograph * Type [of document, which is \\"LP\\" for \\"laissez-passer\\"] * Code [of the issuing organization, which is \\"UNO/UNA\\" for \\"United Nations Organization/Agency\\"] * Laissez-passer Number * Surname * Given Name(s) * Title [Job Title] * Date of Birth * Sex * Official of [UNO/UNA for United Nations Organization/Agency] * Date of Issue * Date of Expiry * Authority [United Nations/Nations Unies followed by the code of the issuing city, e.g. GVA for Geneva] * Signature (on the opposite page) The first line of a machine-readable zone (which is at the bottom of the page) of the passport contains a letter to denote the type of travel document (which is despite the laissez-passer status, it is \\"P\\" for passport), followed by the code normally used for the citizenship of the passport holder (but here: \\"UNO/UNA\\" for \\"United Nations Organization/Agency\\"), and the name (surname first, then given name or names) of the passport holder. When visa are placed in a UNLP, the same practice should be followed, and in the nationality field, UNO/UNA should be placed. This guideline however is often not observed. e-UNLP Effective 3 September 2012, all applicants for new LPs received by the UN Office in Geneva (UNOG) will be issued the new \\"e-UNLPs\\" and there will be no renewal of current UNLPs. The new \\"e-UNLP\\" is fully compliant with international standards established by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). These include the use of bio-chip technology, facial recognition identification and employs strict photographic standards for passport documents. All \\"e-UNLPS\\" will be issued with a five-year fixed duration, regardless of contract expiration and will not contain dependents. The validity period of the new e-UNLP cannot be extended and additional visa pages cannot be added. Existing LPs retain the validity date stipulated in the document.  Limitations of a laissez-passer compared to a passport  The UN laissez-passer is not treated as a valid passport for the purposes of obtaining an Electronic Travel Authorization to visit Canada. Persons not entitled to a laissez-passer  Some categories of persons employed by or affiliated with the United Nations are not normally entitled to receive a laissez-passer, e.g.: goodwill ambassadors, Messengers of Peace, consultants of United Nations organizations and funds and programmes, experts on missions for the United Nations, and individual and institutional contractors. However, in accordance with section 22 of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities, individuals who are designated as experts on missions for the UN may be issued a United Nations Certificate, which is not a legal travel document but serves to certify that the holder is travelling on official business on behalf of the UN or specialized agency or related organization.Guide to the Issuance of United Nations Travel Documents.

The history of collegiate wrestling can be traced to the many indigenous styles of folk wrestling found in Europe, particularly in Great Britain. Those folk wrestling styles soon gained popularity in what would become the United States, and by the end of the Civil War those styles, especially freestyle wrestling, emerged in gymnasiums and athletic clubs throughout the country. From then on, tournaments were sponsored and a professional circuit of wrestlers helped promote wrestling in the United States and throughout the world. By the end of the 19th century, the Amateur Athletic Union was sponsoring competitions in freestyle wrestling, and by the start of the 20th century, colleges and universities were competing in dual meets and tournaments, and such events spread to high schools and lower age levels. During the 20th century, collegiate wrestling evolved into a distinctly American sport which was soon regulated by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).  Wrestling in the American early colonial era  A 1913 publication by Farmer Burns illustrated basic wrestling techniques around the time that collegiate wrestling in the United States was becoming widespread. The half nelson is pictured here. The roots of collegiate wrestling can be traced back almost as far as the earliest moments in United States history. There were already wrestling styles among Native Americans varying from tribe and nation by the 15th and 16th centuries, when the first Europeans settled. The English and French who settled on the North American continent sought out wrestling as a popular pastime. Soon, there were local champions in every settlement, with contests between them on a regional level. The colonists in what would become the United States started out with something more akin to Greco-Roman wrestling, but soon found that style too restrictive in favor of a style which a greater allowance of holds. In the backcountry of Virginia and the Carolinas, wrestling contests were among the favorite athletic events of Scots-Irish colonists. The brutality of the matches was so great that the Assembly of Virginia had to legislate against illegal holds by prohibiting \\"maiming 'by gouging, plunking or putting out an eye, biting, kicking or stomping upon'\\" an opponent. In the backcountry, these rules and laws were largely ignored.Sports in the Western World by William J. Baker, p. 96 (Totowa, NJ: Rowman and Littlefield, 1982). The Irish were known for their \\"collar-and-elbow\\" style, in which wrestlers at the start of the match would grasp each other by the collar with one hand and by the elbow with the other. From this position, wrestlers sought to achieve a fall. If no fall occurred, the wrestlers would continue grappling both standing on their feet and on the ground until a fall was made. Irish immigrants later brought this style to the United States where it soon became widespread. There was also what became known as \\"catch-as-catch-can\\" wrestling, which had a particular following in Great Britain and the variant developed in Lancashire had a particular effect on future freestyle wrestling in particular.\\"Wrestling, Freestyle\\" by Michael B. Poliakoff from Encyclopedia of World Sport: From Ancient Times to the Present, Vol. 3, p. 1190, eds. David Levinson and Karen Christensen (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, Inc., 1996). In catch-as-catch-can wrestling, both contestants started out standing and then a wrestler sought to hold his opponent's shoulder to the ground (known as a fall). If no fall was scored, both wrestlers continued grappling on the ground, and almost all holds and techniques were allowable. A Scottish variant of Lancashire wrestling also became popular, that began with both wrestlers standing chest to chest, grasping each other with locked arms around the body, and if no fall was made, with a match continuing on the ground.  Wrestling in the 18th- and 19th- century United States  By the 18th century, wrestling soon became recognized as a legitimate spectator sport, despite its roughness. It was the major physical contact sport among men of all classes, as boxing did not catch on until the 19th century. Among those who were well known for their wrestling techniques were several U.S. Presidents. George Washington was known to have had a wrestling championship in Virginia in the collar-and-elbow style that was county-wide and possibly colony-wide. At the age of 47, before he became President, Washington was still able to defeat seven challengers from the Massachusetts Volunteers. Andrew Jackson and Zachary Taylor, who favored wrestling as an army sport during his days in the Illinois Volunteers, were also well known for their wrestling. Abraham Lincoln, as a 21-year-old in 1830, was the wrestling champion of his county in Illinois. At this time, while working at a store in New Salem, Illinois, Lincoln had a famous bout with Jack Armstrong, also a county wrestling champion. Lincoln won decisively when, after losing his temper when Armstrong began fouling him, he slammed Armstrong to the ground and knocked him out. Two years later, while serving as a captain in the Illinois Volunteers during the Black Hawk War, Lincoln lost his only recorded match to a soldier in another unit by fall. Wrestling was also practiced by Andrew Johnson, Ulysses S. Grant, Chester A. Arthur, and Theodore Roosevelt (who always had an inclination to anything that involved physical exercise and did regular wrestling workouts throughout his service as Governor of New York). William Howard Taft who was the heaviest of the Presidents at his \\"best weight\\" of 225 lb wrestled collar-and-elbow and was also the intramural heavyweight wrestling champion at Yale University. Calvin Coolidge was described as a \\"tolerable good\\" wrestler by his father until around age 14 when he took to \\"duding around and daydreaming about being a big-city lawyer.\\" Wrestlers such as Abraham Lincoln did not settle for the collar-and-elbow as much as in a free-for-all style of wrestling that was widespread on the frontier. Since \\"catch-as-catch-can\\" wrestling was very similar, it gained great popularity in fairs and festivals in the United States during the 19th century. The collar-and-elbow style was also refined by later Irish immigrants, and gained great ground because of the success of George William Flagg from Vermont, the wrestling champion of the Army of the Potomac. After the Civil War, freestyle wrestling began to emerge as a distinct sport, and soon spread rapidly in the United States. Professional wrestling also emerged in the late 19th century (not like the \\"sports- entertainment\\" seen today). At the time of the first New York Athletic Club tournament in 1878 professional championship wrestling matches \\"offered purses of up to $1,000.\\" By the 1880s, American wrestling became organized, with matches often being conducted alongside gymnastic meets and boxing tournaments in athletic clubs. The first national competition took place in 1887, with L. Chenowith of the Pastime Athletic Club winning the only weight class at 134 lb. The next year the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) sanctioned its first national tournament, and soon became recognized as the governing body of American wrestling. The first college student-athlete to win a national championship was Winchester Osgood, a football player at the University of Pennsylvania, who won the 1895 National AAU Championship at the heavyweight division (then for wrestlers over 158 lb). Wrestling before the 20th century was dominated largely by independent athletic clubs and not by educational institutions. Prominent athletic clubs with wrestling teams included the National Turnverein of Newark, New Jersey, the Schuylkill Navy Athletic Club, St. George's Athletic Club, the Chicago Central YMCA, the Olympic Club of San Francisco, as well as various athletic clubs associated with ethnic groups such as the Chicago Hebrew Association. The National Turnverein produced George Nicholas Mehnert, who won six national AAU championships between 1902 and 1908 and lost only one of more than 100 matches to George Dole, then a student at Yale University. Mehnert was also a gold medalist at the Olympics of 1904 and 1908. Despite wrestling not yet being regulated by colleges and universities, hundreds of participants attended wrestling tournaments. The growth of cities, industrialization, and the closing of the frontier provided the necessary avenue for sports such as wrestling to increase in popularity. The 20th Century: American wrestling becomes \\"Collegiate\\" A high school wrestling match from around the 1993‚Äì94 school year. In 1903, the first intercollegiate dual meet took place between Yale University and Columbia University.\\"1903-1927\\" by Jairus K. Hammond The History of Collegiate Wrestling, p. 1,(Stillwater OK: National Wrestling Hall of Fame, 2006).Yale News February 27, 1903, p. 3 (New Haven CT: 1903). Under the leadership of wrestling coaches Charles Mayser at Iowa State University, William \\"Billy\\" Sheridan from Lehigh University, Dr. Raymond G. Clapp from the University of Nebraska, and Hugo M. Otopalik at Iowa State University, collegiate wrestling began to gain ground in varsity athletics. The Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association held its first tournament in 1905, which soon sparked many more wrestling tournaments for both college and university students and high school students. The Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association remained under student leadership for over 30 years.\\"Wrestling, Freestyle\\" by Michael B. Poliakoff from Encyclopedia of World Sport: From Ancient Times to the Present, Vol. 3, p. 1191, eds. David Levinson and Karen Christensen (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, Inc., 1996). Edward Clark Gallagher, a football and track and field athlete at Oklahoma A&M; College (now Oklahoma State University‚ÄìStillwater), launched wrestling as an official varsity sport just before World War I and with his team launched a dynasty, with undefeated matches from 1921‚Äì1931. When Oklahoma A&M; hosted the national AAU championship in 1925, Gallagher's varsity team won the team championship. Also, his junior varsity teams and unattached entries placed second. The two groups won almost all of the medals at that championship. In 1927, Clapp published the rules for collegiate wrestling, and the next year, the first NCAA Wrestling Team Championship took place on March 30 to March 31 on the campus of Iowa State College. 40 wrestlers from 16 colleges participated, and it was among the first national championships sponsored by the NCAA, the second national championship after outdoor track and field in 1921 (and the third postseason NCAA meet after both outdoor track and field and swimming in 1924).NCAA: The Voice of College Sports: A Diamond Anniversary History, 1906-1981 by Jack Falla, pp. 171, 179, 180, 194-195, 199-200 (Mission, KS: National Collegiate Athletic Association, 1981). Oklahoma State University won that first championship, which was an unofficial one, and later won the first official championship in 1929. Oklahoma State would win 27 of the first 45 Wrestling Team Championships in the Division I category, including seven straight between 1937 and 1946. In 1953, Penn State University became the first team outside of the Midwest to be awarded the national championship. One of the prominent champions during that period was Myron Roderick who won three straight individual championship as a wrestler at Oklahoma State (from 1954 to 1956. Later as a coach, Roderick would lead his teams to seven championships between 1958 and 1968.NCAA: The Voice of College Sports: A Diamond Anniversary History, 1906-1981 by Jack Falla, p. 195 (Mission, KS: National Collegiate Athletic Association, 1981). The rules of collegiate wrestling developed by Raymond G. Clapp, which were eventually adopted by the Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association, marked a sharp contrast to the freestyle wrestling rules of the International Amateur Wrestling Federation (IAWF; now known as United World Wrestling) and the AAU. From then on, collegiate wrestling emerged as a distinctly American sport. Yet American collegiate wrestlers made smooth transitions in the international styles, being able to win Olympic medals in freestyle wrestling at various games. College and high school wrestling grew especially after the standardization of the NCAA wrestling rules, which applied early on to both collegiate and scholastic wrestling (with high school modifications). More colleges, universities, and junior colleges began offering dual meets and tournaments, including championships and having organized wrestling seasons. There were breaks in wrestling seasons because of World War I and World War II, but in the high schools especially, state association wrestling championships sprung up in different regions throughout the 1930s and 1940s. As amateur wrestling grew after World War II, various collegiate athletic conferences also increased the number and quality of their wrestling competition. The pattern soon developed in which more wrestlers would make the progression of wrestling in high school, being recruited by college coaches, and then entering collegiate competition. For most of the 20th century, collegiate wrestling was the most popular form of amateur wrestling in the country, especially in the Midwest and the Southwest. Wrestling matches in the United States were early on particularly long, particularly among those in the Greco-Roman style. The matches most often took place in rings that were 20 feet square and set apart by three ropes. Some schools, such as Oklahoma State University, even had the wrestling rings raised on a platform, much like that of a boxing ring. Although the rules of the AAU called for the referee to determine a winner after 15 minutes of wrestling if no fall occurred, the matches of the Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association were finished by falls, even if it meant an hour or more of wrestling. By 1911, collegiate wrestling rules allowed the referee to determine a win in the absence of a fall after 15 minutes. The time limits have steadily decreased over the years of the 20th century. Yet for more than forty years into the 20th century, freestyle and its American counterpart collegiate wrestling did not have a scoring system. The introduction of a point system by Oklahoma A&M; wrestling coach Art Griffith that gained acceptance in 1941 influenced the international styles as well. The following year, collegiate wrestling would mandatorily take place on open mats laid flat on the gymnasium floor; the rings and ropes were now illegal. This further made collegiate wrestling distinct from its professional counterpart, which would soon become more entertainment than sport. The 1960s and 1970s saw major developments in collegiate wrestling, with the emergence of the United States Wrestling Federation (USWF) (later called the United States Wrestling Association (USWA) and now known as USA Wrestling (USAW)). The USWF, with its membership of coaches, educators, and officials, became recognized eventually as the official governing body of American wrestling and as the official representative to the United States Olympic Committee, in place of the Amateur Athletic Union. Soon, the Division II wrestling team championship was established in 1963. Western State (Colorado) won the first team championship in that division. The Division III wrestling team championship was established in 1974 with Wilkes University winning the first team championship.In the 20th century, collegiate wrestling became the most popular form of amateur wrestling in the United States. Collegiate wrestlers in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s as usual made strides in the international styles, but were more well known for their scholastic and collegiate wrestling achievements. These wrestlers include Dan Gable, who won the Olympic gold medal in 1972 and was the Olympic freestyle coach in 1984, but was more famous for his 15 team championships as coach at the University of Iowa. John Smith also won gold medals at the Goodwill Games against a Soviet in Moscow and at the Olympic Games in 1988 and 1992. He is best known however for his two NCAA championships and his 90 straight victories for Oklahoma State University, where he later became a championship-winning coach. Ed and Lou Banach together won five individual NCAA championships for Iowa and were able to win gold medals at the 1984 Olympics. Wade Schalles of Clarion University earned a record of 821 victories, with 530 falls, which earned him a place in the Guinness Book of World Records as amateur wrestling's \\"all-time winning and pinning leader.\\" Other high-achieving collegiate wrestlers who have had national, international, and Olympic wrestling championship careers include Robin Reed, Kenny Monday, Cael Sanderson, Temoer Terry, Bruce Baumgartner, and Kurt Angle (who would also become a major star in professional wrestling). Today, on the collegiate level, several universities are known for regularly having competitive wrestling teams. The Iowa Hawkeyes (University of Iowa) wrestling team, the Oklahoma State Cowboys (Oklahoma State University) wrestling team, the Iowa State Cyclones (Iowa State University) wrestling team, and the Oklahoma Sooners (University of Oklahoma) wrestling team are four of the most storied and honored programs in the country and have won the majority of NCAA wrestling team championships. Other wrestling programs that were or are at the top include the wrestling teams of the Minnesota Golden Gophers (University of Minnesota), Ohio State Buckeyes (Ohio State University), the Oregon State Beavers (Oregon State University), the Lehigh Mountain Hawks (Lehigh University), the Penn State Nittany Lions (Pennsylvania State University), the Pittsburgh Panthers (University of Pittsburgh), the now-defunct Omaha Mavericks (University of Nebraska Omaha), the Northwestern Wildcats (Northwestern University), the Northern Iowa Panthers (University of Northern Iowa), Augsburg College, and Wartburg College. Collegiate wrestling teams compete for the NCAA wrestling championship each year. The NCAA awards individual championships in the 10 weight classes, as well as a team title. The Dan Gable International Wrestling Institute and Museum is located in Waterloo, Iowa. The Oklahoma State campus in Stillwater, Oklahoma is host to the National Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum. Today, the various state high school associations also host annual wrestling championships for individuals and for teams.

Network Resource Planning is an enhanced process of network planning that incorporates the disciplines of business planning, marketing, and engineering to develop integrated, dynamic master plans for all domains of communications networks. Next generation services Many communications service providers - from wireline, wireless, broadband to next generation carriers - are introducing next-generation services such as interactive video over cell phones and multi- user conference calling. These new services are straining the capacity of existing networks. In a 2006 Reuters interview, John Roese, CTO of Nortel, pointed out that YouTube almost destroyed the Internet, and in a keynote speech at Cisco‚Äôs C-Scape analyst conference in December 2006, John Chambers, CEO of Cisco Networks said, ‚ÄúThings like YouTube are just the baby steps of the impact video will have on networks.‚Äù Since every video transmission requires roughly 150 times the bandwidth of a voice transmission, it is estimated that a one percent adoption of the Verizon Wireless V CAST service required a 400 percent increase in Verizon‚Äôs corresponding network capacity. The bandwidth-intense nature of next generation services has required traditional network planning to evolve. Subscriber growth of legacy services like voice and data had an incremental impact on networks. New subscriptions and their corresponding bandwidth demand followed a relatively linear growth curve. As such, planning methods such as link- and node-specific forecasting or ‚Äútrending‚Äù were sufficient to ensure networks could support current and planned subscribers. The dramatic swings in bandwidth demand that slight variances in subscription rates bring to bear on networks carrying services such as video can no longer be adequately planned for with these traditional methods. Network Resource Planning addresses the weaknesses of trending by incorporating business planning and marketing insight in the planning process. The addition of market analysis adds an additional layer of context and provides a feedback loop that enables more accurate planning. Furthermore, the importance of coordinating infrastructure investment activities across organizations is addressed to ensure that network capacity is provided when and where it is needed, and that human and operational support system resources are appropriately included in the planning process. Next generation networks The bandwidth needs of next generation services has placed added pressure on carriers to migrate from traditional networks like PSTN and TDMA to new Internet Protocol (IP)-based, or next generation networks, that can more adequately support the new services. Planning the transition to IP-based networks is a difficult endeavor in many respects. The capital expenditure (CAPEX) challenge of these new networks is that while it is remains expensive to make a mistake and deploy too much equipment (i.e., over-building their network and wasting assets), the non-linear relationship between bandwidth and network requirements means there are also significant costs from deploying too little (i.e., under-building the network and putting themselves at a higher chance of delivering poor quality of service and losing market share). From a technical perspective, the new IP-based networks are also far more difficult to plan. The self-routing nature of IP networks requires planners to determine how the network will behave under normal, overloaded, and failure scenarios. The fact that IP can drop or delay packets during overload conditions introduces new complexity to the system. Interactive services such as voice, two-way video, and gaming are particularly susceptible to the resultant digital jitter and delay. Under these circumstances, the network planners need to know how these services will be affected under varying conditions. In addition, they need to know how the network can be configured to provide the best quality of service at the least cost. The issue is further compounded by the fact that the simplicity of IP network operations comes from a more uniform, layered approach to network architecture. It‚Äôs the interaction between the layers of the network that creates significant complexity. For example, routine services can run on an IP (and/or Ethernet) network, while high-QoS services are assigned to special routes. These services ride on the underlying logical transport network (ring or mesh), which in turn rides on the underlying optical infrastructure. For planning teams, the effect of traffic on each layer must be taken into account in the other layers. This situation is made even more complex when reliability and disaster scenarios come into play, as backup resources must be made available at each layer in the hierarchy. Traditionally, network planning was performed on a domain-by-domain (i.e., transport, access, etc.) and isolated basis. Network Resource Planning has adapted to address the shared-fabric nature of IP networks by integrating planning across domains. Network planners have a much more powerful tool in Network Resource Planning for leveraging all of the strengths of the various domains in comprehensive master plans. Over the next five years, the vast majority of tier-1 and -2 service providers are expected to shift to convergent network planning systems to handle the complexity of these networks, as well as reduce CAPEX and operational costs.

Education  Boher National School is located beside Saint Manchan's Church in Boher, outside Ballycumber. It was reputedly founded by Saint Manchan and Saint Ciaran, hence its name. As of 2017, the school had more than about 120 pupils. The old schoolhouse, to the west of the church, was turned into living quarters as the new school was built to the east of the church in 1989.  Sports  Ballycumber GAA pitch is located outside of the village with an adjoining community centre. Ballycumber have many titles to their name. Their colours are blue and saffron. There is a senior team, consisting of just Ballycumber players. However, the minor, Under-21, U-16, U-14, U-10 and U-8's team are joined with Tubber GAA to form Ballycumber/Tubber. Brosna Gaels is the local hurling team, made up of the parish of Leamonaghan, which includes Ballycumber, Doon and Pullough with permission players from Tubber. Brosna Gaels field teams at all levels from Senior to Under-6. They gained senior status following a 2009 Intermediate Championship win. Ballycumber also have an association football team, Ballycumber Rovers, which has won county cups and other titles.

Distances: Vienna-Prague, 251 km; Prague-Dresden, 118 km; Dresden-Leipzig, 102 km; Leipzig-Berlin, 153 km. One of the longest adulthood journeys of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was a visit, beginning in Spring 1789, to a series of cities lying northward of his adopted home in Vienna: Prague, Leipzig, Dresden, and Berlin. Departure The journey took place during a difficult period of Mozart's career when he was no longer earning much money from concerts, and his income from the composition of operas had not made up the difference. He was borrowing money, for example from his friend Michael Puchberg, and the financial situation was very worrisome. Mozart's passage to Berlin was free of charge: he accompanied his aristocratic patron and fellow Mason Prince Karl Lichnowsky, (a patron of both Mozart and Beethoven) who had his own reasons for visiting Berlin and had offered Mozart a ride. Mozart and Lichnowsky departed Vienna on the morning of 8 April 1789. They reached Prague on 10 April. In a letter written that day to Constanze, Mozart reported the good news that oboist Friedrich Ramm, traveling from Berlin, told him that Friedrich Wilhelm II, King of Prussia, was eagerly awaiting him in Potsdam. The King was a great potential source of concert income and commissions for new works. Mozart also reported to Constanze that he had worked out an agreement with Domenico Guardasoni, the director of the Italian opera in Prague, for a new opera for a fee of 250 ducats (ca. 1,000 florins). Itinerary cities Dresden Mozart as portrayed by Dora Stock during his visit to Dresden They arrived in Dresden on 12 April, and lodged at the \\"H√¥tel de Pologne\\". This hotel was the scene of a concert performed the next day; according to Deutsch, \\"Mozart performed quartets with the organist Anton Teyber and the cellist Anton Kraft; they also played the String trio, K. 563.\\" At the same concert, Mozart accompanied his friend Josepha Duschek who also travelled to Dresden from her home in Prague. Duschek sang arias from The Marriage of Figaro and Don Giovanni. In a letter to his wife, Mozart writes that they arranged a quartet at the hotel, which they performed in the chapel. \\"Wir hatten bei uns a l'hotel de Boulogne ein quartett arrangirt. - wir machten es in der Kappelle mit Antoine Tayber...\\" The following day, Mozart performed for Elector Friedrich August III of Saxony and his wife Amalie; his collaborators included the nine-year-old cellist Nikolaus Kraft and Duschek. Mozart played the newly written Coronation Concerto K. 537, and was on the next day awarded a snuff-box with 100 ducats. The following day (15 April), Mozart had lunch with the Russian ambassador, Prince Alexander Belovselsky- Beloserky, and then conducted a trial of skill, first on organ, then on the piano, against organist Johann Wilhelm H√§ssler. On either 16 or 17 April Mozart paid a visit to the consistorial councillor Christian Gottfried K√∂rner, a friend of Friedrich Schiller. K√∂rner's sister-in-law Dora Stock was a talented artist and took the occasion to sketch a portrait of Mozart, shown here, in silverpoint on ivory board. This may have been the last portrait of the composer to be produced. Leipzig Thomaskirche in Leipzig On 18 April Lichnowsky and Mozart departed for Leipzig, where they arrived two days later. Mozart spent three days here. He visited the famous Thomaskirche, where Johann Sebastian Bach had served as music director several decades earlier. Mozart had become a great admirer of Bach's music during his early years in Vienna, thanks to the influence of Gottfried van Swieten. Mozart improvised on the organ of the Thomaskirche. Cantor Friedrich Doles, who had been a pupil of Bach, and organist Karl Friedrich G√∂rner, the son of Johann Gottlieb G√∂rner, manipulated the stops of the organ for him. Probably on this occasion, the choir of the Thomasschule performed Bach's motet 'Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied, BWV 225, and Mozart took advantage of the occasion to copy the composition out of all choirparts. Berlin On 23 April, Mozart traveled from Leipzig to Potsdam, near Berlin, where King Friedrich Wilhelm of Prussia maintained his principal residence and arrived on 25 April. As noted above, Mozart had told his wife that the King was anxiously awaiting him; if so, the arrival was a disappointment as the following court document indicated: :One named Mozart (who at his ingress declared himself to be a Capellmeister from Vienna) reports here that he was brought hither in the company of Prince Lichnowsky, that he desired to lay his talents before Your Sovereign Majesty's feet and awaited the command whether he may hope that Your Sovereign Majesty will receive him. Reading this, the King scribbled in the margin \\"Directeur du Port\\", meaning that Mozart should be referred to Jean-Pierre Duport, the director of the royal chamber music. According to Deutsch, Mozart was \\"not on good terms\\" with Duport. Attempting (in Solomon's view) to \\"curry favor\\", he composed (29 April) a set of nine piano variations on a minuet by Duport, K. 573. No royal audience was granted at this time, and indeed, there is no solid evidence that Mozart even remained in Potsdam. Leipzig again On 8 May, Mozart briefly returned to Leipzig, where on 12 May he gave a concert at the Gewandhaus. The concert program consisted entirely of Mozart's music: the piano concerti K. 456 and K. 503, two scenas for soprano (K. 505, K. 528) performed by Josepha Duschek, the fantasy for piano solo K. 475, and two unidentified symphonies. Following a custom of the time, the first of the symphonies was split, the first two movements being played at the opening of the concert and the second two before the intermission. The concert, organized on short notice, apparently was not well attended. Mozart writes back home, that \\"from the point of view of applause and glory this concert was absolutely magnificent but the profits were wretchedly meager\\" (letter, 16 May 1789). Prince Lichnowsky, who had been traveling with Mozart up to this time, left Leipzig in mid-May, and Mozart's subsequent travels were on his own. It may have been during the journey that Mozart incurred a financial debt to Lichnowsky. The amount of the debt was 1415 florins, for which the Prince successfully sued him in October 1791, not long before the composer's death. Mozart lingered in Leipzig until 17 May, partly due to his wish (reported in a letter to Constanze) to remain in the company of a group of friends also visiting the city (Johann Leopold Neumann, Frau Neumann, and Josepha Duschek). His departure was also delayed, he told Constanze, by a dearth of horses available for traveling. Return to Berlin and home Mozart then returned to Berlin, arriving on 19 May. In his letters to Constanze, on this second stay in Berlin he performed before the King and Queen at the royal palace (26 May), reporting his receipt of an award of 100 friedrichs d'or (around 800 florins) and commissions from the King for six string quartets and a set of six easy piano sonatas for Princess Friederieke. The night Mozart arrived in Berlin, he apparently attended a performance of his own opera Die Entf√ºhrung aus dem Serail. Local newspapers apparently did not report his presence, but it was recorded much later (1856) in the posthumously published memoirs of a distinguished figure of German literature, Ludwig Tieck (1773-1853). Tieck was not quite 16 at the time; he refers to himself in the third person. :Ludwig's regard for Mozart was to be rewarded in a surprising way. One evening in 1789, entering the dimly-lit and still empty theatre long before the beginning of the performance, as was his wont, he caught sight of a man in the orchestra pit whom he did not know. He was small, rapid of movement, restless, and with a stupid expression on his face: an unprepossessing figure in a grey overcoat. He was going from one music-desk to the next and seemed to be looking carefully through the music on them. Ludwig at once entered on a conversation. They spoke of the orchestra, the theatre, the opera, the public's taste. He expressed his views openly, but spoke of Mozart's operas with the deepest admiration. \\"So you often hear Mozart's operas and are fond of them?\\" the stranger asked, \\"that is very good of you, young man.\\" They continued their conversation for some time, the auditorium slowly filled, and finally the stranger was called away by someone on the stage. His words had strangely moved Ludwig; he made enquiries. It was Mozart himself, the great master, who had spoken with him and expressed his appreciation to him. Mozart left Berlin on 28 May, traveled via Dresden to Prague, where he stayed from 31 May to 2 June, and finally arrived home in Vienna at midday on 4 June. Mozart's fidelity The trip was the first that Mozart took, following his marriage to Constanze in 1782, on which his wife did not accompany him. Mozart wrote frequently to Constanze in the early stages of the trip, but the loss of many letters makes it uncertain whether he continued this regular correspondence. Maynard Solomon, in his Mozart biography, alleges that during the journey Mozart was unfaithful, pursuing an affair with Duschek, whose own itinerary through Germany (she lived in Prague) frequently intersected Mozart's.Solomon's discussion of the trip, and the possible affair, appears in Chapter 28 of Solomon (1995). However, this hypothesis is generally rejected and has been disproven by American musicologist Bruce Alan Brown.Bruce Alan Brown, ‚ÄúIn defense of Josepha Duschek (and Mozart): Patronage, friendship, and evidence.‚Äù Mozart Society of America Conference, Prague, 12 June 2009.

Background The Minster is the only surviving medieval building in Cheltenham. It has been in continuous use for 850 years, though between 1859 and 1877 it was closed intermittently for repairs. It is believed to have replaced a Saxon church erected on this site in the 8th century. In the Domesday Book the church and its land (the rectory) were recorded as belonging to William the Conqueror's chancellor, Regenbald also known as Reinbald, who then bequeathed it to Cirencester Abbey. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries by Henry VIII it became crown property during the English Reformation. The crown property was sold by James I & VI and went through a succession of different owners (lay rectors) until 1863 when Edward Walker took possession of the chancel and the title of rector. A view showing the Rose Window Parts of the church represent the Early English style of architecture, but thanks to later extensions it is the decorated style which predominates. The former north porch is Early Perpendicular and boasts a good example of lierne vaulting. The tracery of the windows is reflects architectural developments between 1250 and 1350. The stained glass of the windows is late Victorian and regarded as of particularly high quality. The woodwork is Victorian or later, and the south porch is a late Victorian addition. A feature of the church is the spire and bell tower. The upper part of the tower dates from 1200 and the broach spire was added early in the fourteenth century. The tracery of most of the windows is varied and dates from around 1250 to 1350. The bell tower currently contains a peal of twelve bells which were cast by John Taylor & Co in 2018 as part of a major restoration project. The original change ringing peal was probably installed around 1680, and contained six bells. The peal was augmented to eight in 1697 and to ten in 1833. Several record peals were rung on the ten bells, including a record length of 15,227 Grandsire Caters, taking in nine hours and 43 minutes, in 1889. Two new bells were added in 1912 to form the original ring of twelve. The church has a number of interesting memorials, including one to Captain Henry Skillicorne, the developer of Cheltenham's first spa. It also commemorates King George III's visit to Cheltenham in 1788 when he attended a number of services in St Mary's. There is also a touching memorial to a former priest, John English, who was imprisoned by the Puritans. The church is a Grade I listed building. Its most famous incumbent (perpetual curate) was Francis Close, a keen Evangelical, who was a follower of Charles Simeon. Close was the perpetual curate of the church for thirty years and a founder of two teacher training colleges which later became the University of Gloucestershire. He moved on to become Dean of Carlisle in 1856. A view including the tower. The surrounding buildings make it awkward to get a fuller picture of the church. For most of its history St Mary's Church served a population of less than 1,500 and was a prominent feature of the landscape. But extensive building occurred during the Regency period in the early 19th century and as a result the church is now hidden behind shops and offices. In Victorian times a number of new churches were built to cope with Cheltenham's rapidly expanding population. Two Churches? St Mary's was condemned as unsafe and closed in July 1859. During the closure the congregation worshipped first in the Town Hall (the predecessor of Cheltenham's current Town Hall) and then in a temporary church built of timber encased with corrugated iron in Clarence Street. In 1863 Edward Walker proposed the enlargement or replacement of St Mary's. Thirty-four plans were submitted, but because of opposition the proposal was abandoned and instead between 1851 and 1877 the church was restored by architects Dangerfield, Humphris, and Christian, and equipped with gas lighting and a new heating system.RIBA British architectural catalogue: Album of views of Gloucestershire churches: Tewkesbury deanery Retrieved 24 November 2013. The temporary building in Clarence Street was eventually replaced by a permanent stone building which was consecrated in 1879 as St Matthew's. The then rector, Charles Bell, applied to make St Matthew's the parish church, but the proposal was rejected by the parishioners. In 1890 an entrance porch was built on the south side of the church and in 1911 the peal of bells was increased to twelve. Various minor changes were made to the layout of the church in the 20th century, notably a prayer chapel in the south transept. A further reordering took place in 2012 when the prayer chapel was moved to the north transept, the font was moved to the south entrance from the old north porch, toilets and other facilities were installed in the south transept, and some pews were removed to create space for the new prayer chapel, exhibitions and hospitality. On Sunday 3 February 2013 St Mary's was designated Cheltenham Minster by Michael Perham, Bishop of Gloucester.\\"St Mary's Church becomes Cheltenham Minster\\", BBC News, 3 February 2013 A group known as The Friends of St Mary's, Cheltenham raises funds for the upkeep of the church and has an informative website.

Early life and career Croxton was born near Paris, Kentucky, in rural Bourbon County. He was the oldest son among the twelve children of a Virginia-born wealthy planter and slave owner. In 1857, he graduated with honors from Yale University, where he was a member of the Skull and Bones secret society. He subsequently studied law under prominent attorney James Robinson and eventually joined the Freemasonry movement. Croxton was admitted to the bar and taught law courses at a school in Mississippi in 1858. He returned to Kentucky the following year and established a profitable law practice in Paris, as well as owning a small farm outside of town. He married Catherine Rogers (1833‚Äì1882) and raised three daughters. His ardent support for the emancipation of slaves alienated him from much of his family. Civil War In October 1861, as the Civil War escalated, President Abraham Lincoln appointed Croxton as the lieutenant colonel of the 4th Kentucky Mounted Infantry. He saw his first significant fighting in the Battle of Mill Springs. He later rose to its colonel in early 1862, and fought at Perryville. On September 19, 1863, his infantry brigade tangled with Confederate cavalry under Nathan Bedford Forrest, touching off the Battle of Chickamauga. Croxton was wounded during the fighting. He suffered a leg wound at the Battle of Nashville. In 1864, he was promoted to brigadier general at the age of 27, leading a cavalry brigade in the Army of the Cumberland during the Atlanta Campaign. His brigade was located in Florence, Alabama on November 1, when Confederate General John Bell Hood crossed the Tennessee River there to start Hood‚Äôs Franklin-Nashville Campaign. From that point to Nashville and back to the Tennessee River, his brigade was engaged almost every day with the enemy. His cavalry was active in Alabama during the final months of the war. On April 4, 1865, his force of 1,500 men seized Tuscaloosa, strengthening the Union army's grip on central Alabama and eliminating one of the Confederacy's last major supply and munitions centers. In the process, they burned most of the University of Alabama's buildings, as well as much of the town's industry and warehouses. On April 23, 1865, Croxton's troops fought the Battle of Munford near Talladega, Alabama, defeating several hundred Confederate troops under General Benjamin Jefferson Hill. This is said to have been the last battle of the Civil War, east of the Mississippi. Postbellum career In the omnibus promotions following the cessation of hostilities, Croxton was brevetted as a major general. He was then appointed to command the District of Southwest Georgia as provincial governor until he resigned on December 26, 1865. After his resignation from the army, Croxton returned to his Kentucky law practice and became a staunch supporter of the Republican Party. In 1872, he was appointed by President Ulysses S. Grant as the U.S. Minister to Bolivia and moved his family to La Paz. He died there in April 1874, suffering from consumption. His remains were shipped home; he is buried at Paris Cemetery, Paris, Kentucky.

The rebuilding was being led by Jeshua, son of Jozadak, and Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, and had been issued by King Cyrus I. Tattenai wrote a letter to King Darius to ask of these statements were true, and then King Darius wrote a letter confirming that the statements were true.The Bible, Book of Ezra 5:3.6Bible, Book of Ezra 6:6, 13. In the letter, Darius asked that the people do everything they can to support this rebuilding financially, and that they do nothing to impede it lest they suffer harsh punishment.

It lies southeast of the R436 regional road between the village of Ballycumber and the town of Clara, in County Offaly. Much of the bog is state- owned and managed as a nature reserve covering some 460 ha. A Special Area of Conservation covers 836 ha. History The bog was formed in a depression, originally a shallow lake, at the end of the last ice age. An esker left by retreating glaciers cut off drainage to the north (the river Brosna catchment). Although usually classed as a relatively intact bog, it has been negatively affected by peat extraction and by the construction of the Clara to Rahan road in the late 18th century.Clara Bog Visitor Information National Parks and Wildlife Service (Ireland) The bog subsided up to six meters following bisection by the road and associated drainage. The dome structure of the bog was also changed by the road, leaving two domes, a western one and an eastern one. In the early 1980s, Clara Bog East was drained for potential industrial peat extraction, but public requests were made to the Irish Government to preserve the area by a number of international naturalists, David Bellamy among them. In 1987, both the Dutch and Irish Governments signed a technical agreement for co-operation in the area of peatland management and restoration. Clara Bog was chosen as one of the study sites and partly converted into a nature reserve. The industrial development was stopped and existing drains were blocked.Restoration of Lakes, Streams, Floodplains, and Bogs in Europe. Martina Eiseltov√° (Ed.), Springer Wetlands: Ecology, Conservation and Management Series, 2010. DOI: 10.1007/978-90-481-9265-6 Its status and development since the last ice age concerning flora and hydrology has since been extensively studied. In 1988 it was designated a Ramsar Site.http://www.ramsar.org/clara-bog Clara Bog and Raheenmore Bog (also in County Offaly) have been twinned with Bargerveen Nature Reserve, a Dutch Ramsar Site, under the European Natural Sites Twinning Programme (Eurosite).Bog Twinning Ireland and the Netherlands RT√â News 1992 In 1992 Ireland considered putting forward Clara Bog as a World Heritage Site, but after some years on UNESCO's \\"tentative list\\" it was decided that the bog's integrity had been damaged by peat extraction and its candidature was withdrawn in 2009. Peat extraction for domestic use For centuries the Irish have taken turf (peat) from bogs as fuel for their fires, and there has been resistance to the requirements of the Habitats Directive for a ban on the tradition in protected areas. After a number of raised bogs, including Clara Bog, were designated Special Areas of Conservation in the 1990s, the Irish government granted itself a derogation to allow \\"domestic turf-cutting\\" on SACs for a period of ten years from 1999. Turf-cutting continued on the margins of Clara Bog, although this had a negative impact on its condition.Tracey Logan (June 2011), Turf-cutters battle over Irish peat bog ban, synopsis of radio broadcast (From Our Own Correspondent), BBC. Negotiations took place to relocate turf-cutters to alternative sites of less ecological value. In 2012 it was reported that a number of Clara turf-cutters had relocated to a bog at Rahan. Access and facilities for the public In 2011 Brian Cowen completed his last official public engagement as Taoiseach in his hometown of Clara, when he opened the ‚Ç¨2.1 million Clara bog visitor centre and library. He commented that the siting of the visitor centre avoided unnecessary intrusion on the tranquillity of the nature reserve.Taoiseach's speech: 7 March 2011. Department of the Taoiseach Public access to the bog is via a trackway from a car park on its eastern edge. Visitors are advised not to leave the boardwalk for safety reasons.

In triage, each paper is read through at least two times, and as many as five times, before being eliminated or passed on to the second round. The triage round of judging eliminates two-thirds or more of the submitted papers. In the second round of judging, papers are read up to an additional twelve times each, and the top papers emerge. The top six will go on to the presentation round of judging. Judging is blind until the presentation round, with teams known only by a unique team ID number. The presentation round is held in April where the teams present their papers to a panel of judges. Following the presentations, judges rank the teams and a formal award ceremony takes place. Prizes All students who submit a viable solution paper receive certificates of participation, which are mailed to their teacher- coach. Coaches also receive certificates. Judges have the option of awarding up to $37,000 in additional semi-finalist and honorable mention team awards in amounts of $1,500 and $1,000 per team, respectively. Semi-finalist prizes are awarded to teams whose papers were highly ranked and underwent in-depth, specific discussion by judges, but missed making it into the top six. The top six teams' schools are awarded trophies.

Produced by the BBC in association with Danish Radio, it was shown in the U.S. on NET. Winning wide acclaim both for its performances and for being shot entirely at Helsing√∏r (Elsinore in English), in the castle in which the play is set, it is the only version (with sound) of the play to have actually been shot at Elsinore Castle. This programme was recorded and edited on video tape (2\\" quadruplex) and not 'filmed'. The director was Philip Saville. It was the longest version of the play telecast in one evening up to that time, running nearly three hours.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058176/combined A 1947 telecast of the play had split it up into two ninety-minute halves over two weeks.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039445/combined The Canadian actor Christopher Plummer took the lead role as Hamlet and earned an Emmy Award nomination for his performance. In supporting roles were Robert Shaw as Claudius, Donald Sutherland as Fortinbras, Roy Kinnear as the Gravedigger and Michael Caine, in his only Shakespearean performance, as Horatio. Sutherland, Caine and Shaw were, at the time, almost completely unknown to American audiences, and just before the presentation's first U.S. telecast, Plummer began to gain popularity in the U.S. because of his appearance in the 1965 musical film The Sound of Music. Clips of the programme are very rarely shown on television, and Plummer himself expressed a wish for it to be commercially available. It was released on Region 1 DVD by the BBC and Warner on 25 October 2011.  Cast  * Christopher Plummer as Hamlet * Robert Shaw as Claudius, King of Denmark * Alec Clunes as Polonius * Michael Caine as Horatio * June Tobin as Gertrude, Queen of Denmark * Jo Maxwell Muller as Ophelia * Dyson Lovell as Laertes * Donald Sutherland as Fortinbras * Roy Kinnear as the Gravedigger  Production  The production was originated by Danish television, which lacked the financial resources to realize the project and turned to the BBC for help. Videotaped at Kronborg Castle in Elsinore, Denmark, in September 1963 by a Danish crew with the director and actors supplied by the BBC, it represents a technical milestone for the BBC as a full-length play had never been videotaped on-location before. The producer, Peter Luke, deliberately cast lesser-known actors as it was felt using major stars would prove a distraction. Plummer, Shaw and particularly Caine would become stars within a year to two of the original broadcast, and Sutherland would become a star in 1970 after the release of the film MASH. Jo Maxwell Muller, who was only 18 years old, was cast as Ophelia on the insistence of Plummer. Hamlet at Elsinore was broadcast in Canada on April 15, 1964, and in the United Kingdom on April 19, exactly one week before Shakespeare's 400th birthday. It was intended by the BBC to be its major commemoration of the Shakespeare quatercentenary. It was broadcast in the United States on November 15, 1964.  Michael Caine  Horatio is, so far, the only classical role played by Michael Caine, who had never received dramatic training. According to his 2011 autobiography The Elephant to Hollywood, Caine had been released from his contract with producer Joseph E. Levine after the making of Zulu as Levine has told him, \\"I know you're not, but you gotta face the fact that you look like a queer on screen.\\" Caine wrote, \\"I decided that if my on-screen appearance was going to be an issue, then I would use it to bring out all Horatio's ambiguous sexuality.\\"Caine 2011, p. 63  Awards  At the 18th Emmy Awards (1966), Christopher Plummer was nominated in the category of Outstanding Single Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Drama for his performance as Hamlet.

Originally named Major Elisha K. Henson (LT-5), in 1946 she was renamed John F. Nash and by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Since retirement from the Corps of Engineers, LT-5 has been renamed Major Elisha K. Henson. As of the 1992 date of its listing as a National Historic Landmark, LT-5 was believed to be the last functional U.S. Army vessel that participated in Normandy landings, but at least one other survives. LT-5 sailed to Great Britain in February 1944 in anticipation of Operation Overlord, the planned allied invasion Europe. On June 6, 1944, LT-5 sailed for Normandy with two barges as part of Operation Mulberry, in support of Overlord. Under fire, the tug ferried supplies to the landing beaches for the next month, in the process shooting down a German fighter aircraft on June 9. After the war, LT-5 returned to the United States. Assigned to the Buffalo District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in May 1946, LT-5 was renamed John F. Nash. Nash was the Buffalo District's Senior Engineer and Chief Civilian Assistant for the period 1932 to 1941. From 1946 to 1989, Nash served the lower Great Lakes region by assisting in the maintenance of harbors, and construction projects that included the St. Lawrence Seaway in the 1950s. Renamed Major Elisha K. Henson, she has been largely restored to her original configuration by the H. Lee White Marine Museum in Oswego, New York where she is currently on display. Tours are available Mid-May through the end of September. LT-5 was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1992. A sister ship located at Kewaunee, Wisconsin, the Major Wilbur Fr.

It was formerly known as the \\"War Office Seal\\". The Department of the Army Emblem U.S. Board of War and Ordnance. \\"Military service mark\\" approved by the U.S. Department of Defense for usage by third parties to represent the U.S. Army in unofficial contexts. The Department of the Army Seal and the Department of the Army Emblem are, respectively, the official seal and emblem of the United States Department of the Army (formerly, of the War Department). The \\"War Office Seal\\" was created in 1778 and the Emblem was developed out of the seal and approved in 1947. History The Army Seal was used originally during the American Revolution to authenticate documents. It displayed the designation \\"War Office\\", which was synonymous with Headquarters of the Army, and the Roman date MDCCLXXVIII (1778) the first time it was used. It remained unchanged until 1947, when the War Office banner was replaced with \\"Department of the Army\\" and the date was changed to 1775, the year in which the Army was established. The seal embodies the Army's ideals of loyalty, vigilance, perseverance, truth, courage, zeal, fortitude, remembrance, determination, constancy, achievement, dignity, and honor. The changes were legislated by the National Security Act of 1947, and authorized by Section 3011, Title 10, United States Code. Prior to the establishment of the \\"Department of the Army Emblem\\", there was no official display item to identify the Army. The Seal had traditionally been used to authenticate documents only and was not authorized for public display. In recognizing the need to provide a display item, the Secretary of the Army approved the emblem design as the official emblem to represent the Army on January 29, 1947. Description The Army Institute of Heraldry describes the War Office Seal as follows: :In the center is a Roman cuirass below a vertical unsheathed sword, point up, the pommel resting on the neck opening of the cuirass and a Phrygian cap supported on the sword point, all between on the left an espontoon and on the right a musket with fixed bayonet crossed in saltire behind the cuirass and passing under the sword guard. To the left of the cuirass and esponton is a national color of the Revolutionary War period with cords and tassels, on a flagstaff with spearhead, above a cannon barrel, the muzzle end slanting upward behind the cuirass, in front of the drum, with two drumsticks and the fly end of the flag draped over the drumhead; below, but partly in front of the cannon barrel, is a pile of three cannon balls. To the right of the cuirass and musket is the flag of the Department of the Army, with cords and tassels, on a flagstaff with spearhead, similarly arranged above a mortar on a carriage, the mortar facing inward and in front of the lower portion of the color and obscuring the lower part of it; below the mortar are two bomb shells placed side by side. Centered above the Phrygian cap is a rattlesnake holding in its mouth a scroll inscribed \\"This We'll Defend\\". Centered below the cuirass are the Roman numerals \\"MDCCLXXVIII\\". Although the U.S. Department of the Army's emblem is derived from the Seal of the U.S. Department of the Army, it differs from the seal in several respects. The emblem is displayed in color while the seal is not, the emblem includes the inscription \\"Department of the Army\\" instead of the seal inscription \\"War Office\\", and on the emblem, the U.S. flag is on its own right (observer's left) to reflect the current custom for display of flags. The flag of the United States Army pattern has been added in place of the opposing flag displayed on the seal. The Roman numerals \\"MDCCLXXVIII\\" which indicate the date the Seal was adopted, were replaced with the date \\"1775\\" to reflect the date the Continental Army was established. Symbolism The central element of the seal and emblem, the Roman cuirass, is a symbol of strength and defense. The sword, esponton (a type of half-pike formerly used by subordinate officers), musket, bayonet, cannon, cannonballs, mortar, and mortar bombs are representative of Army implements. The drum and drumsticks are symbols of public notification of the Army's purpose and intent to serve the Nation and its people. The Phrygian cap (often called the \\"Cap of Liberty\\") supported on the point of an unsheathed sword and the motto \\"This We'll Defend\\" on a scroll held by the rattlesnake is a symbol depicted on some American colonial flags and signifies the Army's constant readiness to defend and preserve the United States. The symbolism for the elements of the emblem is the same as for the seal with the deviations and additions noted under ‚ÄúDescription‚Äù above: The colors of the design elements are those traditionally associated with the ideals of the United States and of the U.S. Army. The flags are depicted in their approved colors. Blue is symbolic of loyalty, vigilance, perseverance, and truth. Red denotes courage, zeal, and fortitude. White alludes to deeds worthy of remembrance. Black is indicative of determination and constancy. Gold represents achievement, dignity, and honor. Current usage This \\"War Office Seal\\" continues to be used to this day when legal certification is necessary to authenticate as \\"official\\" documents and records of the Department of the Army. Reproduction of the emblem is authorized in publications and other printed matter of an official or quasi-official nature in U.S. Army approved films and in official U.S. Army motion pictures or television programs. The design may not be modified in any manner. It may be reproduced in its proper colors, through the use of a one-color line process, or as a line drawing. The use of the emblem for any other purposes, including its incorporation in other items for commercial sale, will be only as authorized by the Institute of Heraldry.

() is a Boston, Massachusetts‚Äìbased software company that produces an online video platform.  History  Brightcove was founded in 2004 by Jeremy Allaire, who served as Executive Chairman until April 2016, and Bob Mason. The company was named after a harbor where the founder liked to kayak named Bright Cove Harbor in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. In March 2006, Brightcove acquired Seattle-based Metastories, makers of StoryMaker, a publishing tool for video, audio, images, and text. In May of that year, it established a distribution partnership with TiVo and a content delivery partnership with Limelight Networks. Coinciding with a series of deals with UK media companies, Brightcove opened an office in London in July 2007. In November 2009, Brightcove was named as one of the top two U.S. video platform vendors. In April 2010, it was reported that Brightcove raised $12 million in fourth-round funding, nearing a total of $100 million, but still barely breaking even with the projected $50 million in annual revenue. In August 2010, Brightcove announced a content delivery partnership with Akamai Technologies. Along with Akamai Technologies, its other partnerships include the ones with Sitecore, Cleeng, FreeWheel, YuMe, Conviva, Oracle, DoubleClick, and other organizations. As a public company Brightcove went public in February 2012 with their stock priced at $11 per share. The price of the stock during the summer of 2017 was $7 per share, with the stock down 38 percent in the past year. In July 2017, the company announced that CEO David Mendels agreed to step down as of July 31, 2017. Andrew Feinberg, previously Brightcove's president and chief operating officer was named acting CEO until April 2018 when Jeff Ray was appointed as the new CEO.  Internet TV partnerships  In December 2005 Brightcove partnered with Reuters to create a program to syndicate customized news video players. In 2006, Brightcove completed Internet TV partnership deals with a number of large media companies including The New York Times Company (NYTimes.com and About.com), Discovery Communications (Discovery Channel, Travel Channel), and Sony BMG among others. In 2007, Brightcove capitalized on a trend of magazine and newspaper publishers expanding into online video by signing deals with print media companies including Time Inc., TV Guide, and Washingtonpost.Newsweek Interactive. Since then, a number of television and cable media companies have begun to use Brightcove as an alternate, non-exclusive distribution channel for their video content.  Brightcove Studio  The Brightcove Studio was home to the Brightcove Internet TV platform. Geared toward professional video publishers, the studio was used to create, customize, distribute, and monetize video player widgets. Videos, lineups, players, and online channels were all created and managed through a content management system called the Brightcove Console, an Adobe Flex-based internet application. Monetization was achieved through video sales and advertising. Former services  Brightcove.tv  Brightcove.tv was a video website dedicated to promoting Brightcove content. Every publisher who created a Brightcove account was assigned a channel, their own page on Brightcove.tv. Publishers could customize their channel through the Brightcove Console. Simple details like the channel's name, logo, and description could be updated in the user's profile. The content of a channel was defined by changing the settings of individual titles, lineups, and players to allow distribution and promotion on Brightcove.tv. On December 17, 2008, Brightcove shut down Brightcove Network accounts that had not been upgraded to paid Brightcove platform accounts. At the same time, they shut down the Brightcove.TV website (which is separate from the corporate Brightcove website).GigaOM NewTeeVee.com (11/03/2008)  App Cloud  In May 2011, Brightcove announced its App Cloud online product that was targeted at the development of mobile applications.Devindra Hardawar, VentureBeat. \\"Brightcove steps into app creation biz with App Cloud.\\" May 24, 2011.

It is found in the western Amazon basin in eastern Peru, far south-eastern Ecuador, north-western Bolivia and far western Brazil. It includes the wavy-breasted parakeet (P. roseifrons peruviana), also known as the wavy-breasted conure, which sometimes is considered a separate species (see Taxonomy). Description Total length c. . As other members of the Pyrrhura picta complex, it is a long-tailed mainly green parakeet with a dark red belly, rump and tail-tip (tail all dark red from below), a grey- scaled chest, a whitish or dull yellow patch on the auriculars and bluish remiges. The forehead, ocular region and carpal edge are red in the nominate race (P. r. roseifrons). Its bare eye-ring is typically dark greyish (sometimes indistinct) bordered by yellowish-white. The remaining subspecies, P. r. peruviana and P. r. dilutissima, lack any bright red in their plumage, but most of their crown and ocular region are very dark brownish-maroon (often appear blackish), while the forecrown is blue. Their eye-ring is grey. All races have dark grey legs. Habitat and behavior It occurs in tropical humid lowland forest and adjacent habitats. It is social and typically seen in pairs or groups. It feeds on fruits, seeds and flowers. The nest is placed in a tree cavity. It is fairly common in most of its range and occurs in several protected areas, e.g. Man√∫ National Park. Taxonomy It has typically been considered a subspecies of the painted parakeet. While reviewing this group, Joseph (2002) discovered that an undescribed population existed in northern Peru (later also found in far south-eastern Ecuador). It was described as Pyrrhura peruviana (Hocking, Blake and Joseph, 2002). It was further recommended that P. roseifrons should be considered a monotypic species instead of a subspecies of P. picta. Ribas et al. (2006) confirmed by mtDNA that P. roseifrons should be considered a species separate from P. picta (otherwise P. picta would be paraphyletic), but also showed that peruviana was very close to, and therefore arguably better considered a subspecies of, P. roseifrons. Consequently, SACC voted to recognize P. roseifrons as a species with peruviana as a subspecies. Arndt (2008) recently described another taxon from this complex, dilutissima, as a subspecies of P. peruviana, but under the here used taxonomy, it becomes a subspecies of P. roseifrons. The taxonomic status in relations to Bonaparte's parakeet and the so-called \\"group 6\\" (per Joseph, 2002) remains unclear. Arndt (2008) recently described the latter as a distinct species, P. parvifrons, but this has yet to receive widespread recognition (e.g. by SACC). References * Arndt, T. (2008).

Located south of the Mohawk River, it includes the Indian Castle Church, built in 1769 by Sir William Johnson, British Superintendent of Indian Affairs, as a missionary church for the Mohawk in the western part of their territory; the Brant Family Barn, a rare surviving example of Dutch colonial barns in the Mohawk Valley; as well as important archaeological site areas revealing life in Nowadaga, as the western part of the Mohawk village of Canajoharie was known.Dean R. Snow and David B. Guldenzopf, \\"Indian Castle Church, the Mohawk Upper Castle Historic District National Historic Landmark\\" , 1998-2001, Indian Castle Church Website, accessed 10 October 2011 The fortified village was called the Upper Castle by European colonists. Its name differentiates it from Lower Castle to the east, another fortified Mohawk village, known as Tionondoroge, near the confluence of Schoharie Creek and the Mohawk River. Fort Hunter was built here in 1712. The Schoharie Crossing State Historic Site, containing remains of a navigable aqueduct, is near the former village location. History and resources The Mohawk concentrated their town life in the villages known as \\"castles\\" following the destructive raids by French Canadians and their Indian allies during King William's War of 1693. They reestablished their settlements in both areas, which were located south of the Mohawk River. Indian Castle Church was built in 1769 as a missionary church to the Mohawk in this western settlement known as Canajoharie, by Sir William Johnson, British Superintendent of Indian Affairs, on land donated by Mary (Molly) Brant, his consort, and her younger brother Joseph Brant, both Mohawk leaders allied with Johnson. It has a nearby Mohawk cemetery, a contributing site. Following the Revolutionary War and the exodus of most Mohawk from New York to Canada, under pressure as allies of the defeated British, the church was used by a variety of Protestant congregations in the area. Dutch Reformed (1800‚Äì1820), an interdenominational Union Congregation, a \\"short-lived\\" Presbyterian congregation, and Lutherans from 1838-1855. A new Union Church Society took over the church and accomplished some renovations beginning in 1855. It changed the orientation of the building, so that the short ends face north and south. The Society used the church until 1925. To save the property, local residents formed the Indian Castle Church Restoration and Preservation Society, and have raised funds for it during the years. Due to their efforts, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. The Society operates the property as a public historic site. The Brant Family Barn is believed to have been constructed about 1754, at the time the family established the homestead. The houses later occupied by Mary Brant and her brother Joseph were both burned down during the revolutionary war, as were most structures existing in the valley before the war. They migrated to Ontario, where they settled on the Six Nations Reserve. This 49.6-acre tract was privately held and used primarily for agriculture. In 1940 Ralph Welden bought the property from the Green family, and it is still held by his descendants. They allowed archaeological assessments in the 1970s and 1980s, and have worked to preserve the land where substantial resources were found. References External links * Dean R. Snow and David B.

It weaves the tale of Anne's life told in first person. The book was published in the US as The Reluctant Queen: The Story of Anne of York Plot summary The novel begins in with a prologue, in the year 1485. Anne, the narrator, knows she is dying and has decided to write her memoirs before death slowly takes her. She worries about the fate of her family including that of her husband Richard, the King of England. Richard is severely maligned by his people, and Anne fears that his power and position would be greatly jeopardized after her death. This leads to her reminiscing on happier days. She recalls growing up in the English countryside with her noble family: her father Richard, her mother Anne, and sister Isabel. At the age of five she meets her future husband, eight-year-old Richard Plantagenet who is studying under the tutelage of her father. Richard's brother Edward has recently been proclaimed King by the English people, usurping the throne from mentally unstable King Henry VI and his aloof consort, Margaret of Anjou. Richard enthralls young Anne with tales of his brother and the Wars of the Roses. Anne's father as the Earl of Warwick has played a crucial part in placing Edward on the English Throne, and plans to marry him to French noblewoman, Bona of Savoy, much to his daughter Isabel's chagrin as she secretly wants to be Queen Consort. Soon all of England is shocked to discover that Edward has secretly married a young widowed mother, Elizabeth Woodville Grey who is five years older than he is, and is considered by many to be a \\"commoner\\". The Earl is disgusted with Edward's choice of a bride, as is Edward's mother Cecily Neville, Duchess of York, who out of spite informs her son that she had him illegitimately. He does not believe her and refuses to have the marriage annulled, something which will have calamitous results in the future. Isabel, dismayed that the King did not choose her for a bride, sets her sights on his younger brother George, Duke of Clarence. George and Isabel marry just as Warwick severs ties with King Edward and joins the Lancastrian side of the War of the Roses. A pregnant Isabel is so distressed by the sudden move that she gives birth to a stillborn daughter. Warwick proposes that Anne marry Edward, Prince of Wales Henry and Margaret's son. Anne is terrified that Queen Margaret will be her mother-in-law until she gets to know her better. Anne's parents, along with Isabel and George, head back to England, while Anne remains with her future in-laws. Soon Anne marries and travels back to England with her husband and mother-in-law as Princess of Wales. She is horrified to discover that her father has died in the dreaded Battle of Barnet. Prince Edward also dies in battle, much to the grief of Queen Margaret. Soon she and Anne are taken prisoner by the Yorkist soldiers. The King releases Anne, believing her the victim of her father's ambition. Queen Margaret is imprisoned and Anne is sent under the watchful eye of George and Isabel, as her mother in fear of her life is living in sanctuary in an abbey. Anne and Richard meet again after a long years absence and soon fall in love. Richard proposes marriage to her and she accepts, much to George's horror. George, wanting the inheritance of Warwick only for himself, drugs Anne and arranges for her to be spirited away to be taken in by servants and force her to believe that she is a disillusioned scullery maid. Anne manages to see through the facade and asks for one of the deposed servant girls for help. The girl alerts Richard who rescues Anne. The entire court as well as Isabel believed Anne to have run away after her marriage was refused by her guardian's. Despite several setbacks, Anne marries Richard and becomes Duchess of Gloucester. With her relatives restored to favour, Anne's mother is reunited with her children, and is delighted to learn that Isabel is pregnant again. Isabel gives birth to a daughter Margaret Plantagenet. Anne wants to give Richard a child and is dismayed to learn that he had had a mistress before the marriage, and shares two children with her. Anne is shocked and hurt but soon forgives Richard, and they eventually have a son christened Edward after the King. Isabel becomes pregnant again twice, but dies along with her last infant son. Richard's one-time mistress also dies leaving Anne as stepmother to her two young children. George, distraught over his wife's death, confronts the King and dies mysteriously. After several years, King Edward dies suddenly, leaving his young son as heir. It is soon discovered that the late King had betrothed marriage to another, making his marriage to Queen Elizabeth invalid, and barring her children from the throne. Richard, and a reluctant Anne assume rule as King and Queen. Anne worries about the health of her young son, and her own imbalances of illness which leads her to believe that Richard is attracted to his niece Elizabeth of York. When Edward dies, Anne's health takes a turn for the worse. Rumours envelop the countryside after Richard's nephews vanish without a trace. Richard invites his widowed sister-in-law and her daughter's back to court, despite Anne's paranoia about Elizabeth. Anne realizes her mistake too late. With the last ounce of her strength she writes her memoirs, then silently dies on the night of an eclipse. Unmentioned in the novel are Richard's eventual downfall and death at the battle of Bosworth and Elizabeth's rise as consort of the new king, and mother of a new dynasty, and the fate of Isabel's children Edward and Margaret who were executed in 1499 and 1541 respectively.

Raymond Zussman's story and Medal of Honor are on permanent display at the Michigan Heroes Museum in Frankenmuth, Michigan. Medal of Honor citation Second Lieutenant Zussman's official Medal of Honor citation reads: > On 12 September 1944, 2d Lt. Zussman was in command of 2 tanks operating > with an infantry company in the attack on enemy forces occupying the town of > Noroy le Bourg, France. At 7 p.m., his command tank bogged down. Throughout > the ensuing action, armed only with a carbine, he reconnoitered alone on > foot far in advance of his remaining tank and the infantry. Returning only > from time to time to designate targets, he directed the action of the tank > and turned over to the infantry the numerous German soldiers he had caused > to surrender. He located a road block and directed his tanks to destroy it. > Fully exposed to fire from enemy positions only 50 yards distant, he stood > by his tank directing its fire. Three Germans were killed and 8 surrendered. > Again he walked before his tank, leading it against an enemy-held group of > houses, machine gun and small arms fire kicking up dust at his feet.

Built in 1811 and significantly altered in 1839 and 1849, it is an important early example of the Hudson River Bracketed style by Alexander Jackson Davis. The house was declared a National Historic Landmark in 2003.William E. Krattinger (August, 2001) , National Park Service and Description and history The Plumb-Bronson House is located in southeastern Hudson, on the west side of Worth Avenue (US 9) just north of the town line. The estate consists of about of open grass and woodlands, with most of the buildings set well back from the road. A gated drive with a small gatehouse on the south side provides access to the property. In addition to the main house, there are three outbuildings set in a cluster around it. The house was originally built for Samuel Plumb, who purchased the site in 1811. The construction of the house has been attributed to local builder Barnabas Waterman (1776-1839), but the identity of its architect, if there was one, remains unknown. Alterations and additions to the house were designed by architect Alexander Jackson Davis and constructed in 1839 and 1849 for Dr. Oliver Bronson, who purchased the property in 1838. Davis' work converted the house into an early example of the Hudson River Bracketed style, and his influence is also evident in the adjacent outbuildings. Dr Bronson was the heir to an affluent banking family and was probably introduced to Davis by his brother in law, Robert Donaldson Jr. The grounds may be an early example of the work of landscape architect Andrew Jackson Downing. Bronson sold the house in 1853. In the twentieth century portions of the property became the site of a girls' school, now used as a prison.2003 Press Release The house and its immediate grounds are now leased by Historic Hudson, Inc., who have begun a restoration program. In popular culture The house was a setting of the 2012 film Bourne Legacy.

Career Soro was employed in Venice in 1506 by the Council of Ten as cipher breaker-in-chief.Anzovin, item 3401 They were the first secret service specializing in codebreaking.Anzovin, p. 202 item 3401. The first secret service to specialize in codebreaking was the Council of Ten, the state security committee that oversaw the government of Venice (in modern Italy) from 1310 through 1797. In 1506 it hired as its cipher secretary the cryptanalyst Giovanni Soro, author of a book on solving ciphers in Italian, French, Spanish, and Latin, who was known throughout Europe for his ability to read encrypted messages. Soro ran the cryptanalysis operation in secret as the cipher secretary. Soro's tasks included deciphering secret messages captured from the messenger spies of Venice's rivals. At the time, Venice was plagued by espionage and subterfuge. The Council of Ten had its own ciphers changed often so as to impede competitors such as Fran√ßois Vi√®te, a French mathematician (father of modern algebraic notation). Successful diplomacy depended on knowing the adjacent principalities' thoughts and ideas.Lloyd, p. 14 Soro was able to decipher the ciphers of most other courts. By 1510, he had forced most of them to develop their ciphers to a much higher degree of sophistication. As a result, the Papal Curia hired him to break codes their own cipher analysts in Rome could not. Pope Clement VII often sent messages to Soro for cryptanalysis to test their impenetrability.Singh, p. 28 Soro's work in Venice continued to take priority over his work at the Vatican. He was Venice's principal cryptanalyst for almost 40 years. His work is among the earliest successful cryptanalysis which has been preserved.Britannica (1983), p. 333 Soro's reputation was great throughout the leaders of other Italian city-states and Europe. He was so successful that he was given two assistants and a secret office in the Doge's Palace above the Sala di Segret by 1542.Molin, p. 6 He made Venice a Renaissance bastion of diplomatic cryptology. Soro wrote a treatise in Italian, French, Spanish, and Latin in the early 16th century on cryptography and solving ciphers which has since been lost. Notes References *Kahn, David (1996).

He was a medical doctor by profession, and fought for the French Resistance during the Second World War. He had very well succeeded in his medical studies in Paris starting as an intern (1929), to become chief of clinical surgery, then a laureate of the Acad√©mie Nationale de M√©decine and finally a member of the Committee of the French Association of Surgery (1935). He founded his own hospital, of 50 beds, in Ettelbruck, in north-western Luxembourg. There, in 1940, he helped two interned French airmen to escape to France. Charles Marx escaped himself, with his family, just before the German invasion. He briefly directed four French hospitals, in Nevers and Quillan. In July, he founded the first resistance group of the Arm√©e secr√®te, which, in May 1943, was followed by a first maquis in the western Pyrenees. In June 1943, he was condemned to death in absentia in Montpellier by the Nazis. In February 1944, Charles Marx was appointed medical commander of the FFI and chief health manager of the Resistance in the oriental Pyrenees. In September 1944, he took part in the liberation of Lyon. In October, being the delegate of the medical resistance council, he was named attach√© to the Health Minister and was charged to organise French-American military surgical structures. At the end of July, he took up the management of the Ettelbruck hospital. In November 1945, he was nominated Minister for Public Health in Luxembourg. Marx participated in the National Union Government under Prime Minister Pierre Dupong, representing the Communist Party in the all-party administration.

Louverture and Rigaud fought over de facto control of the French colony of Saint-Domingue during the war. Their conflict followed their successful expulsion of British forces from the colony as part of the Haitian Revolution. The war resulted in Toussaint taking control of the entirety of Saint-Domingue, and Rigaud fleeing into exile. Background Andr√© Rigaud Early revolution The Haitian Revolution had begun in 1791, when black slaves on the Caribbean colony of Saint-Domingue rose up against their French owners amidst the French Revolution. Toussaint came to prominence as a leader of rebel slaves in the North of Saint-Domingue, operating in territories surrounding the port of Le Cap-Fran√ßais. Simultaneously, Rigaud emerged as a rebel leader among the gens de couleur libres (free people of color), who were based in the south of Saint-Domingue, where they had a significant presence around the port of Les Cayes. In May 1792, Saint-Domingue's French Republican commissioners formed an alliance with Rigaud, allowing him to march his forces into the capital of Port-au-Prince and dissolve the city's restive government of white planters. In August 1793, the new commissioner Sonthonax proclaimed freedom for all slaves in Saint-Domingue, in an effort to counteract a counterrevolutionary white planters' revolt in Le Cap, a British invasion, and a Spanish invasion from neighboring Santo Domingo, as part of the War of the First Coalition. After they abolished slavery, Sonthonax and his fellow commissioner Polverel successfully convinced Toussaint to join the French Republican side of the conflict. Toussaint and Rigaud had become allies by 1794. In early 1795, the French National Convention promoted both men to the rank of brigadier general. Toussaint consolidates power By 1798, Toussaint and Rigaud had jointly contained both the external and internal threats to the colony. In April 1798, the British commander Thomas Maitland approached Toussaint to negotiate a British withdrawal, which was concluded in August. In early 1799, Toussaint also independently negotiated \\"Toussaint's Clause\\" with the U.S., allowing American merchants to trade with Saint-Domingue despite the ongoing Quasi War between the U.S. and France. These developments significantly augmented Toussaint's power and demonstrated his emergence as a de facto independent ruler. Going forward, Toussaint and Rigaud effectively controlled all of the troops and territory within Saint-Domingue, although the colony was still nominally under French oversight. Toussaint ruled the colony's northern region around Le Cap and the western region around the capital of Port-au-Prince. Meanwhile, Rigaud independently ruled the southern region around Les Cayes, although Toussaint was technically his superior. H√©douville sows tension In July 1798, Toussaint and Rigaud traveled in a carriage together from Port- au-Prince to Le Cap to meet the recently arrived representative Th√©odore- Joseph d'H√©douville, sent by France's new Directory regime. Oral tradition asserts that during this carriage ride, Toussaint and Rigaud made a pact to collaborate against H√©douville's meddling. However, those efforts soon came undone, as H√©douville intentionally treated Rigaud with more favor than Toussaint, in an effort to sow tension between the two leaders. In a letter to Rigaud, H√©douville criticized \\"the perfidy of General Toussaint Louverture\\" and absolved Rigaud of Toussaint's authority as general-in-chief. He invited Rigaud to \\"take command of the Department of the South.\\" H√©douville eventually fled Saint-Domingue, sailing from Le Cap in October 1798 due to threats by Toussaint. The War Alexandre P√©tion  Outbreak  The conflict took place mainly within Rigaud's domains in the southern part of Saint-Domingue. Rigaud struck first; after slaughtering many whites in South Province to secure his rear, on June 16-18, 1799, Rigaud sent 4,000 troops to seize the southern border towns of Petit-Go√¢ve and Grand-Go√¢ve, routing the smaller forces of Louverture's officer Laplume. Laplume narrowly escaped capture as his army collapsed in a flurry of confusion and desertions. Taking no prisoners, the mulattoes put blacks and whites to the sword. Following this decisive strike, Alexandre P√©tion, a free colored officer (and future Haitian president) defected to Rigaud's side, bringing with him a large contingent of veteran troops. Outside of the South, Rigaud instigated smaller revolts in the northern regions around Le Cap, Port-de-Paix, and M√¥le-Saint-Nicolas, as well as the west-central Artibonite plain. Many of these regions had repeatedly revolted against Toussaint in the past, in response to his strict labor policies and attempt to accommodate remaining white planters. He tried to establish labor regimes in order to produce enough sugar cane and other commodities for export.  Suppression  Toussaint responded rapidly to crush the uprisings in the North. Under the leadership of his officers Henri Christophe and Jean-Jacques Dessalines, Toussaint's troops orchestrated widespread executions of suspected conspirators. Meanwhile, in August 1799, Toussaint wrote to U.S. president John Adams, convincing the U.S. navy to blockade ports controlled by Rigaud. To the United States, Rigaud's ties to France represented a threat to American commerce, which had been harassed by French privateers for the last two years as part of the Quasi-War. After consolidating his rule in the north by late October, preparations were being made by Toussaint to attack Rigaud in every part of the South. For this invasion, Toussaint possessed a stark numerical advantage; he had 45,000-50,000 troops in his army, compared with Rigaud's 15,000. Early in November, Christophe led one wing of the army against Jacmel, and Dessalines led another one to recapture Grand and Petit Go√¢ve. No small part in the black offensive was played by an American fleet, which destroyed Rigaud's marauding barges, transported blacks to the southern front, and bombarded mulatto positions. For instance, the frigate USS General Greene, commanded by Captain Christopher Perry, providing fire support to the blacks as Toussaint laid siege to Jacmel. By mid-November, Toussaint's southern offensive was stalled at Jacmel, symbol of mulatto resistance. Led by P√©tion, the defenders refused to succumb to fierce attacks by Toussaint's forces. Early 1800 found the city almost without food but still repulsing the slashing assaults of Dessalines' army; one time the blacks even broke inside the beleaguered city, only to be cut off and slaughtered by the defenders. On the night of March 11, 1800, P√©tion hacked his way out of Jacmel, but Toussaint's forces fell on his retreating army and killed or captured hundreds of soldiers. In June, an emissary of France sent by the newly empowered First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte (who had recently overthrown the Directory) reaffirmed Toussaint's position as general-in-chief. This undermined Rigaud's claims that H√©douville had voided Toussaint's authority. By late July, Rigaud had fled the colony with his family to France, and Toussaint entered Rigaud's former base of Les Cayes shortly afterward. By August, 1800, Toussaint was ruler of all Saint-Domingue. Aftermath Massacres Following his victory over Rigaud, Toussaint declared a general amnesty in July 1800. But Toussaint's general Jean-Jacques Dessalines became infamous during this period for carrying out brutal reprisals and massacres against Rigaud's supporters. Some historians have asserted that Toussaint himself ordered massacres, but delegated the killing to his generals to avoid culpability. The number of victims in these massacres remains disputed: the contemporary French general Fran√ßois Joseph Pamphile de Lacroix suggested 10,000 deaths, while C.L.R. James, a 20th-century historian from Trinidad, later claimed only a few hundred persons had been killed in contravention of the amnesty. Invasion of Santo Domingo Five months after the war, in December 1800, Toussaint ordered an invasion of the Spanish colony of Santo Domingo, which occupied the eastern half of the island of Hispanola. Although Spain had technically ceded Santo Domingo to France in the 1795 Peace of Basel, the colony was still controlled by a Spanish administration at the time. The invasion was virtually unopposed, and the Spanish governor capitulated a month later. Toussaint's reasons for invading Santo Domingo remain multifaceted and murky. Throughout the war, the Spanish authorities in Santo Domingo had generally supported Rigaud, fearing Toussaint's own designs on the eastern portion of Hispaniola. Toussaint suspected that the Spanish had also been offering direct military aid to Rigaud; for instance, the gens de couleur officer Antoine Chanlatte had traveled to Santo Domingo in 1800 to acquire munitions for Rigaud's cause. The American consul Edward Stevens claimed that Toussaint had launched the invasion in response to a rumor that France was sending 15,000 troops to Santo Domingo in support of Riguad. Toussaint also claimed that black \\"French citizens\\" were being kidnapped and sold as slaves in Santo Domingo. Additionally, Toussaint may have wished to emancipate Santo Domingo's remaining enslaved population, although he made no mention of slavery in his declaration of war. Charles Leclerc Toussaint's fall from power With his victory over Rigaud and conquest of Santo Domingo, Toussaint controlled the entire island of Hispaniola by 1801. However, Rigaud returned less than two years later, when he and his fellow exile P√©tion joined Charles Leclerc's unsuccessful 1802 campaign to reassert French control over the colony. During the campaign, Leclerc would deport both Rigaud and Toussaint from Saint Domingue; Toussaint died in a French prison in 1803. Ethnicity and the conflict In presenting the war, historians often point to the ethnic divide between Saint-Domingue's black and mulatto populations. Rigaud, a free mulatto, is seen as being favored by the whites and other mulattoes, who were part of the gens de couleur. In contrast, Toussaint was held in high regard by the colony's black population. Under Rigaud's regime, gens de couleur had filled many officer posts in his army and acquired many abandoned plantation properties in the south. Meanwhile, most of the officers in Toussaint's army were predominately former slaves of African ancestry. That said, there was still substantial diversity on both sides. Many ex-slaves supported Rigaud's faction, such as the former maroon Lamour Desrances, who was among those who thought that Toussaint was excessively conciliatory to white planters and the British. Both sides claimed that the other intended to betray the Rights of Man propagated by the French Revolution and reinstate slavery. As a result, historians such as Laurent Dubois argue that the conflict \\"was not driven by differences in racial identity... it was a conflict over territorial and political power.\\" Both Toussaint and Rigaud had an economic interest in maintaining the colony's plantation system and cultivating economic ties with British and American merchants. The question that remained was whether it would be Toussaint or Rigaud who controlled this renewed system.

It was first characterized as a distinct algal species in 1965,M.D. Guiry in Guiry, M.D. & Guiry, G.M. 2013. AlgaeBase. World-wide electronic publication, National University of Ireland, Galway. http://www.algaebase.org; searched on 19 April 2013. and has since been regarded as a separate genus from Chlorella due its need for thiamine (not to be confused with thymine) for growth.Gao, Chunfang; Zhai, Yan; Ding, Yi and Wu, Qingyu \\"Application of sweet sorghum for biodiesel production by heterotrophic microalga Chlorella protothecoides.\\" Applied Energy 87.3 (2010): 756-761. Auxenochlorella has been found in a wide variety of environments from acidic volcanic soil in Italy to the sap of poplar trees in the forests of Germany. Its use in industrial processes has been studied, as the high lipid content of the alga during heterotrophic growth is promising for biodiesel; its use in wastewater treatment has been investigated, as well.Pittman, Jon K., Andrew P. Dean, and Olumayowa Osundeko. \\"The potential of sustainable algal biofuel production using wastewater resources.\\" Bioresource Technology 102.1 (2011): 17-25.

A recent phylogenetic analysis has clarified its position with respect to related strains.Darienko, T., Pr√∂schold, T.

Journal of Phycology, 51: 394‚Äì400. doi: 10.1111/jpy.12279 Industrial applications Biofuels Auxenochlorella has potential in biofuel production, as it can accumulate high lipid content under heterotrophic conditions. The A. protothecoides genome has been sequenced and compared to two other species (C. variabilis and Coccomyxa subellipsoidea).Gao C., Wang Y., Shen Y., Yan D., He X., Dai J., et al. (2014). Oil accumulation mechanisms of the oleaginous microalga Chlorella protothecoides revealed-through its genome, transcriptomes and proteomes. BMC Genomics (2014) 15:582‚Äì595. It was found to have a smaller genome size that encodes fewer genes, fewer multi-copy genes, fewer unique genes, and fewer genome rearrangements than its close relatives. Furthermore, three genes were identified that enable the consumption of glucose and, thus, heterotrophic growth. These three Chlorella-specific hexose-proton symporter (HUP)-like genes, in addition to rapid pyruvate synthesis, fatty acid synthesis enzyme upregulation, and fatty acid degradation enzyme downregulation, contribute to the high lipid content. The algae have also been shown to grow on plethora of media, including glycerol, glucose, and acetate.Gill,Saba Shahid; Mehmood, Muhammad Aamer; Rashid, Umer; Ibrahim, Muhammad; Saqib, Anam and Rizwan, Muhammad \\"Waste-water treatment coupled with biodiesel production using microalgae: a bio-refinery approach.\\" Pakistan Journal of Life and Social Sciences 11.3 (2013): 179-189. One study showed that the Auxenochlorella heterotrophically synthesized a maximum crude lipid content of 55.2% dry weight.Heredia-Arroyo, Tamarys, Wei Wei, and Bo Hu. \\"Oil accumulation via heterotrophic/mixotrophic Chlorella protothecoides.\\" Applied biochemistry and biotechnology 162.7 (2010): 1978-1995. Separate studies have confirmed that large amounts of lutein, a type of carotenoid that can be used as a drop-in fuel source, are also produced.Xu, Han, Xiaoling Miao, and Qingyu Wu. \\"High quality biodiesel production from a microalga Chlorella protothecoides by heterotrophic growth in fermenters.\\" Journal of Biotechnology 126.4 (2006): 499-507.Shi, Xian-Ming; Liu, Hui-Jun; Zhang, Xue- Wu and Feng Chen \\"Production of biomass and lutein by Chlorella protothecoides at various glucose concentrations in heterotrophic cultures.\\" Process biochemistry 34.4 (1999): 341-347.Shi, X.

Chen. \\"Production and rapid extraction of lutein and the other lipid‚Äêsoluble pigments from Chlorella protothecoides grown under heterotrophic and mixotrophic conditions.\\" Food/Nahrung 43.2 (1999): 109-113. Auxenochlorella biofuel production poses similar efficiency problems as other algal species, as the pyrolysis and drying process are expensive and time- consuming. In addition, the biofuel studies were generally done with fed batch culture in order for the algae to maintain log phase growth and maximize yields, a process that may be expensive on a larger scale. Wastewater treatment The sludge produced in wastewater treatment plants may provide a potential nutrient source for algae in the production of biodiesel while simultaneously creating an ecofriendly recycling process for the byproducts of sewage plants. Over a 6-day period, Auxenochlorella was able to remove 59% of the total nitrogen, 81% of the total phosphorus, and 96% of the total organic carbon from the waste while maintaining a high lipid productivity rate.Shi, Xian-Ming; Liu, Hui-Jun; Zhang, Xue-Wu and Chen, Feng \\"Heterotrophic production of lutein by selected Chlorella strains.\\" Journal of Applied Phycology 9.5 (1997): 445-450. Higher biomass production can be accomplished with a heterotrophic/mixotrophic growth mix using wastewater and biodiesel-derived glycerol.Zhou, Wenguang; Li, Yecong; Min, Min; Hu, Bing; Zhang, Hong; Ma, Xiaochen; Li, Liang; Cheng, Yanling; Chen, Paul and Ruan, Roger \\"Growing wastewater-born microalga Auxenochlorella protothecoides UMN280 on concentrated municipal wastewater for simultaneous nutrient removal and energy feedstock production.\\" Applied Energy 98 (2012): 433-440. The lipid content can be lower in wastewater than in a synthetic medium, however. Thus, cost-benefit analyses are needed to determine when nutrient addition may be required and beneficial to foster algal growth. The lipid-extracted biomass can be used for a multitude of functions: biogas production, a biofertilizer carrier, biofertilizer itself, biochar production, and an ingredient in animal feed. Microalgal-treated wastewater may not be flawless drinking water, but it could be more suitable for irrigation purposes. Additionally, if the wastewater after the microalga harvest is subjected to water-treatment protocols, it reportedly reduces the operational cost of the water-treatment process.

History Unid√° started as an asturian nationalist coalition, of Left-wing and ecologist groups, for the autonomous and municipal elections of May 2007 which formed a coalition with another party, The Greens- Green Group that would leave the alliance months later. The coalition was constituted completely in April 2007. In the same month they officially presented their candidacy to Asturian Parliament, the recognized writer and doctor psychiatrist Ignaciu Llope. Their manifesto supported the defense of the asturian language, culture and Asturian identity; measures to tackle the economic and labour crisis that they claim Asturias faces, as well as ecological corruption in certain levels and attacks that they think that the present government causes; and, in general, the implementation of a new model of territorial development, from a new Statute of Autonomy that supposes an important extension in comparison with the present one, and which they consider essential, in addition to one bets by an option that of continuity to a unit which they think that the Asturian nationalism of left needed years ago. Their results in elections of 2007 were modest, although it was highest in the history of the left nationalism in Asturias, with 4,119 votes (0.7%).Results of the autonomic elections of 2007 in Asturias. While, in the municipal elections, the coalition, thanks to its local groupings, obtained four councillors: two in Nava (Asturianistes por Nava), one in Carre√±o (Andecha por Carre√±o) and another one in Pilo√±a (IAS-Asturianistes), where a pact of government granted in addition to the formation three councils and the possession to mayorship.
