The music of Veneto. Venice The city of Venice in Italy has played an important role in the development of the music of Italy. The Venetian state‚Äîi.e. the medieval Maritime Republic of Venice‚Äîwas often popularly called the \\"Republic of Music\\", and an anonymous Frenchman of the 17th century is said to have remarked that \\"In every home, someone is playing a musical instrument or singing. There is music everywhere.\\" Touring Club p. 79 Venues In Padua, musical ensembles such as the Amici della Musica di Padova, the Solisti Veneti and the Padova-Veneto Symphony are found. Concerts are often held in the historic Loggia Comaro, built in 1524. As well, the city is the site of the Teatro delle Maddalene, the Teatro delle Grazie, the Giuseppe Verdi Theater, and the Cesare Pollini music conservatory. Rovigo is well known for its love of opera and is the site of the famous Teatro Sociale, built in 1819. In the 20th century it was the venue for the career beginnings of Tullio Serafin, Beniamino Gigli and Renata Tebaldi. The town of Rovigo is also the site of the Francesco Vanezza music conservatory. The city of Treviso is currently embarked on a music/multimedia facility building project under the umbrella term \\"Eurobottega\\". The Teatro Mario Del Monaco is its main theatre and opera house. The town of Asolo in the province has annual chamber music festivals. The Arena of Verona. The city of Verona is world-famous for the Roman amphitheater known as the \\"Arena\\", a site that has been hosting musical events since the 16th century, but which is more recently known for the spectacular outdoor staging of Verdi's Aida, an event staged for the first time in 1913. The city also has the Felice Evaristo Dall'Abaco music conservatory; Vicenza is the site of the Teatro Olimpico and an annual series of symphony concerts, \\"Il Suono dell'Olimpico\\" as well as of an interesting project entitled Costruiamo un'opera\\" aimed at promoting musical education among school children. The town of Bassano del Grappa in the province of Vicenza is the site of OperaEstate Festival Veneto, involving performances at many different locations in the town, virtually turning the entire town into one large operatic venue. Folk Music of Veneto Veneto has a rich culture of folk music. Most of the songs that are known today were born between the 18th Century and the first half of 20th Century. The majority of them don't have an author. Venetian chants were mainly choral and they were sung in aggregative moments. After a day of work on the mountain or in the fields (people who used to work in vineyards were forced to sing so the lord or later, the employer, could be sure that they weren't eating the grapes while working); after weddings, at night in an osteria or during fil√≤ (country vigils common in the winter). It was during sagre (country festivals) that folk songs flourished the most: the ecclesiastic censorship wasn't respected there, which reflected in more vulgar lyrics with a more liberating effect. Sagre are also the occasions where it's more frequent to hear folk music nowadays. Like in every oral tradition, a Venetian song can have various versions that can differ in content and in the dialect, which can vary drastically within 30 miles or less. It's also interesting noticing how this repertoire shares similarities and themes with the music of Istria; the song \\"La mula di Parenzo\\" (‚ÄúParenzo‚Äôs mule‚Äù), which refers to a Croatian city, is a famous example. Despite being often sung a cappella, Venetian folk music featured in the past some typical instrument which has felt into disuse before the 20th Century. Between them, the \\"baga\\" (a small bagpipe with two pipes) and the piva (bagpipe) (a recorder made of chestnut wood). Nowadays Venetian songs are often accompanied by an accordion or by guitars. The music is generally really simple, diatonic and strophic, often based on tonic to dominant progressions. Venetian songs often presents a love theme, usually situated in a rustic setting. Sexual themes presented in an irreverent way are common; one example is \\"L'oselin de la comare\\".(‚ÄúThe godmather‚Äôs little bird‚Äù). It's not rare to find dark theme linked in love songs: in \\"Donna Lombarda\\" (‚ÄúLombard woman‚Äù), a man convinces a woman (after getting her drunk) to cheat on her husband and even kill him. In the capital of Venice and nearby, canzoni da battello (boat songs) were a popular sub-genre. The love theme here is often presented on a gondola, the typical Venetian boat. Famous examples include ‚ÄúLa biondina in gondoleta‚Äù (‚ÄúThe blonde girl in the gondola‚Äù) (Lamberti) and ‚ÄúMonta in gondola‚Äù (‚ÄúGet on the gondola‚Äù) (Latilla, Boni); the second one, from the ‚Äò50s, represent a more modern approach which was influenced by the pop music of the days. Lullabies are really common, the most famous of one would be ‚ÄúTot√≤ tot√≤ museta‚Äù; they would often include religious thematics. During World War 1, the repertoire often overlapped with those of the Alpini, the mountain warfare of the Italian Army. Most of these songs were written in the area of Mount Ortigara and they include ‚ÄúTa pum‚Äù, ‚ÄúSul cappello‚Äù (‚ÄúOn our hat‚Äù), ‚ÄúQuel mazzolin di fiori‚Äù (‚ÄúThat little bunch of flowers‚Äù).

Unlike many large metropolises, Vancouver has no freeways into or through the downtown area. A proposed freeway through the downtown was rejected in the 1960s by a coalition of citizens, community leaders and planners. This event \\"signalled the emergence of a new concept of the urban landscape\\" and has been a consistent element of the city's planning ever since. As the city is surrounded by water on three sides, it has several bridges to the north and south. Although similar to most other cities in that the automobile serves as the primary mode of transportation, it has alternatives such as the SkyTrain system, which is the longest fully automated light metro system in the world, and an extensive network of bicycle paths. Until 2020, Vancouver was one of only a few major cities in North America without ridesharing company services (such as Uber), due to a provincial law banning their operation. Legislation was amended to allow such services in 2018. The first ridesharing companies, Uber and Lyft, were approved to operate in the region on January 23, 2020, but services had yet to commence as providers had to undergo administrative approval, business licensing, and insurance procedures. On January 24, 2020, Uber and Lyft began operations in Vancouver. Public transportation The Metro Vancouver operates a regional rapid mass transit network, under the auspices of the South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority (formerly Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority). Known as TransLink, it is responsible for all aspects of municipal transportation. In addition to public transport, TransLink is also responsible for maintaining some roads and providing ferry service within the Lower Mainland. TransLink introduced a smart card based electronic payment system called Compass Card to replace existing monthly and daily passes, tickets and cash. Translink has been slowly phasing in use of the Compass Card. Summer 2015 saw most post-secondary school students begin using the fare cards. Translink rolled out the card to the general population in November 2015. The Compass Card has a [C$]6 refundable deposit. It is a NXP Mifare DESFire EV1 card. Bus service A TransLink- operated electric trolley bus in Vancouver Bus service operates throughout most the region under a subsidiary of Translink, known as Coast Mountain Bus Company. TransLink was established by the provincial government as a way to divorce itself from the responsibilities of roads, bridges and transit service. Ultimately the provincial government retains responsibility for funding of all projects under the aegis of Translink. Service in West Vancouver and Lions Bay is contracted through West Vancouver Blue Bus. All buses are wheelchair-accessible and carry cycle racks; they can carry two wheelchairs and bicycles. Vancouver is actively maintaining and upgrading its trolleybus fleet. With purchases of 188 E40LFRs and 74 E60LFRs from New Flyer Industries (in 2005‚Äì2009), the trolley network serves the downtown core and much of the city of Vancouver proper with fully wheelchair-accessible and bicycle-friendly zero-emission buses. Certain diesel commuter buses which travel to the suburbs as RapidBus have bicycle racks, wheelchair lifts, reading lights and high back reclining seats. Frequency in Greater Vancouver ranges from every couple of minutes within downtown Vancouver to two to three trips a day in far-flung suburbs such as Maple Ridge, Langley, and Aldergrove. SkyTrain SkyTrain's Bombardier ART Mk III at Stadium‚ÄìChinatown station The SkyTrain is an advanced rapid metro system operating fully automated trains on three lines. Built for the Expo 86 World's Fair, it has since become the world's longest automated light rapid transit system utilizing the world's longest transit-only bridge, the SkyBridge. The Expo and Millennium Lines link downtown to the suburbs of Burnaby, New Westminster, Surrey, and Coquitlam. A third rapid transit line connecting downtown Vancouver to central Richmond and the Vancouver International Airport, known as the Canada Line, started operation on August 17, 2009. It utilizes Hyundai Rotem instead of the linear induction Bombardier technology used on the first two lines. Future expansion Plans from the 2000s to expand the Expo Line to the southeast, increasing its capacity and extending its route further into the city of Surrey, were superseded in the mid-2010s by a proposed light rail line. , planning is underway for a $2-billion extension of the Millennium Line west towards Kitsilano and Point Grey. The phase 1 extension would start at the current VCC‚ÄìClark SkyTrain station terminus, then run under the Broadway Corridor to terminate at Arbutus Street. At a future date, a phase 2 extension would be built to the University of British Columbia. Downtown streetcar The city was planning the first phase of a downtown streetcar from Granville Island around False Creek to Waterfront Station and then to Stanley Park using a combination of modern low-floor trams and heritage streetcars. The Vancouver Downtown Historic Railway was running the phase-zero route, Granville Island- Main Street SkyTrain station, in the summer months, as a demonstration. From January 21 to March 21, 2010, a free demonstration service called the \\"Olympic Line\\" (named after the 2010 Winter Olympics) ran along 1.8 km of the Downtown Historic Railway, from Granville Island to Olympic Village Station, using two Bombardier Flexity Outlook streetcars borrowed from the Brussels tramway. Plans were being developed that would have extended the streetcar network into Yaletown making a ring around the downtown peninsula as phase two. Longer range plans were being discussed that may have extended the streetcar from Granville Island west onto the Arbutus corridor, east along Hastings Street and/or south along Main Street. However, there are no current plans for a streetcar network in Vancouver, and the Olympic Line demonstration line was decommissioned. TransLink operates a commuter railway, the West Coast Express. West Coast Express The West Coast Express, a heavy commuter rail train, serves Port Moody, Coquitlam, Port Coquitlam, Pitt Meadows, Maple Ridge, and Mission. These services have an integrated ticketing system. SeaBus The SeaBus is a passenger-only ferry connecting downtown Vancouver and the City of North Vancouver across Burrard Inlet. There are three ferries in the fleet, which is owned and operated by the Coast Mountain Bus Company. The newest vessel was put into service in 2014. Cycling Canadian census data shows that cycling mode share for the city is 3.7% as compared to 1.7% for the Metro Vancouver area. In neighbourhoods such as Point Grey, Kitsilano, Mount Pleasant and Grandview Woodlands the cycling mode share can be over 10%. Within the downtown core, the combined walking and cycling mode is as high as 50%. Cycling infrastructure Vancouver is served by a network of over 300 lane-km of on- and off-road bicycle routes. Most of these routes are local street bikeways (also known as bike boulevards), streets that have extensive traffic calming measures such as traffic circles, and signal control to facilitate crossing of major roads. Neighbourhoods are encouraged to plant and care for the circles and boulevards and add public art along bike routes. Map of bike lanes in Downtown Vancouver and the surrounding area Since 2004, with the implementation of the Downtown Transportation Plan the City has been adding more bicycle lanes on roads in the densely populated downtown core, signalling its desire to encourage greater commuter use of bicycles. A lack of separated facilities in the downtown core and poor bridge crossings remain as an obstacle to provide facilities that serve the needs of novice and advanced cyclists. The City of Vancouver is continuing to provide additional racks and other types of bike parking. The Central Valley Greenway, a 25-kilometre green bicycle corridor, was officially opened on June 27, 2009. This route forms a regional connection linking downtown Vancouver to Burnaby and New Westminster. Within the City of Vancouver, the Central Valley Greenway is almost entirely separated from traffic; counts completed by the City of Vancouver show that almost 2,000 cyclists per day were using this route within one month of the opening. On May 7, 2009, Vancouver City Council approved a bicycle lane trial on the Burrard Bridge which began on July 13. It saw the southbound motor- vehicle curb lane and the northbound-side sidewalk allocated to bicycles, with the southbound-side sidewalk allocated to pedestrians. The reassigned lane was separated from motor vehicles by a physical barrier. As part of the trial, traffic pattern changes to accommodate feeder bicycle traffic were also completed on Pacific St. next to the North bridgehead over complaints from local merchants that cited lack of consultation and a negative impact on their businesses. Two weeks into the trial, the City of Vancouver released a data report showing daily bicycle travel across the bridge had increased by an average of 30%. The same report indicated little change in pedestrian trips, a slight drop in motor vehicle trips, but no change in motor vehicle travel times between 12th Avenue and Georgia Street along Burrard via the bridge. Proposed cycling infrastructure upgrades have often been met with concerns about impacts to the business community. Three days into the Burrard Bridge Bike Lane trial, a local merchant reported a 46% drop in sales compared to the same days the year before. Six weeks into the trial another local merchant reported a 25% drop in sales, and a local restaurant reported a 30% drop in sales. In July 2011 Stantec was commissioned by the city to survey businesses in areas around recently installed downtown bike lanes in order to prepare a report summarizing impacts to businesses of the bike lanes; 32% of business responded to the survey. The study concluded that there was a total loss of $2.4 million in sales for nearby businesses amounting to $480,000 in lost profits a year, which was categorized as \\"moderate economic impacts.\\" However, in 2017, the upgrades were welcomed by the Downtown Vancouver Business Improvement Association as a \\"competitive edge\\" for local employers. Translink, the regional transportation authority, permits two bicycles aboard each SkyTrain car at all times except in the peak direction at morning and afternoon rush periods. The Canada Line Skytrain permits one bicycle per car with no limitations on time of day or direction. All buses are equipped with bicycle racks. The Seabus, which connects Vancouver to North Vancouver, allows up to six bicycles per sailing during all hours of operation. Mobi bike sharing program since 2016. Bike share On July 20, 2016, a bicycle sharing system known as Mobi launched in the City of Vancouver. In September 2018, Uber announced plans to launch its dockless electric bicycle sharing system, Jump Bikes in Vancouver. Bicycle theft On August 24, 2009, the Vancouver Police Department announced a sharp increase in bicycle theft, with the first 3 weeks of August experiencing a 53 percent increase in thefts over 2008. Constable Jana McGuinness, Vancouver Police spokeswoman was quoted as saying, \\"there is no link between the increase in bike thefts and the recent dedicated bike lanes on Burrard Bridge.\\" Freeways Map of provincial highways and freeways in Metro Vancouver Municipal bylaws and geography have protected Vancouver from the spread of urban freeways, and the only freeway within city limits is Highway 1, which passes through the eastern edge of the city. All other limited-access routes entering the city (Highway 99, Knight Street, Grant McConachie Way), cease being freeways before they enter Vancouver's city limits. From Highway 1, Hastings Street is the primary route to Downtown. Other freeways in the region include Highways 1A, 7, 10, 15, 17, and 91. The lack of freeways in the City of Vancouver is primarily due to the protests of concerned citizens as the city was being developed. During the late 1950s, proposals were made by the City to put a freeway through the heart of Chinatown. The Chinese community joined together with non-Chinese supporters to prevent the freeway from being implemented, and by 1971 Chinatown was declared a historical area. The only sections built were the Dunsmuir and Georgia viaducts, which became low-speed streets. Airport Vancouver is served by Vancouver International Airport (YVR), located on Sea Island in the City of Richmond, immediately south of Vancouver. YVR is the second busiest airport in Canada and one of the busiest international airports on the west coast of North America. Vancouver Harbour Water Aerodrome on Burrard Inlet and a heliport near Waterfront Station link downtown directly to Victoria, Nanaimo and YVR.  Rail  Pacific Central Station is the western terminus for several Via Rail inter-city routes. Rail service is operated from the following stations: * Waterfront Station (Vancouver) ‚Äì Regional rail service operated by West Coast Express to Mission. * Pacific Central Station ‚Äì Inter-city passenger rail service is operated by Via Rail to the interior and Eastern Canada, Toronto, and intermediate points aboard The Canadian. Inter- city passenger rail service operated by Amtrak Cascades to Seattle, Washington and Portland, Oregon. * Rocky Mountaineer Station ‚Äì Tour passenger train services operated by the Rocky Mountaineer to the interior, Rocky Mountains en route to Banff and Jasper. * North Vancouver Station ‚Äì used for Rocky Mountaineer services to Jasper via Whistler  Ferries  False Creek Ferry is a private company that operates a passenger and bicycle ferry service around Downtown Vancouver. Two BC Ferry terminals serve the Greater Vancouver area. One is to the northwest at Horseshoe Bay in West Vancouver, and the other is to the south, at Tsawwassen in Delta. Routes link the mainland to Vancouver Island, the Sunshine Coast, and the Gulf Islands. Mini-Ferry Aquabus and False Creek Ferries are private companies that operate passenger and bicycle ferries connecting the downtown peninsula with Granville Island and the False Creek neighbourhoods. English Bay Launch operates daily scheduled foot- passenger water taxi service between Granville Island, Coal Harbour and Bowen Island. Coastal Link Ferries operates daily scheduled foot-passenger water taxi service between Coal Harbour, West Vancouver, and Bowen Island.  Taxicabs  Several private taxicab companies operate 24-hour service in Vancouver, including Yellow Cabs, Vancouver Taxi, Black Top Cabs, and MacLure's Cabs. Taxis and drivers are regulated by the city and, , 477 licensed cabs operated in the city, including 59 wheelchair-accessible vehicles. , a taxi ride to or from Vancouver International Airport costs approximately $30‚Äì$32. Cabs in Vancouver are powered by gasoline, natural gas, and electricity. There is also a pedicab company operating in downtown Vancouver called Tikki Tikki pedicabs, usually operating on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights.

Keating was replaced with Charles Keating, Jr, by President Richard Nixon. Studies undertaken The Commission commissioned Berl Kutchinsky to perform a scientific study on the subject. His report, titled Studies on Pornography and Sex Crimes in Denmark (1970), found that legalizing pornography in Denmark had not (as had been expected) resulted in an increase of sex crimes.Studies on Pornography and Sex Crimes in Denmark (1970) by Berl Kutchinsky.Pornography, Sex Crime, and Public Policy by Berl Kutchinsky.

On balance the report found that obscenity and pornography were not important social problems, that there was no evidence that exposure to such material was harmful to individuals, and that current legal and policy initiatives were more likely to create problems than solve them. The report was widely criticized and rejected by Congress. The Senate rejected the Commission's findings and recommendations by a 60‚Äì5 vote, with 34 abstentions.Raymond Tatalovich, Byron W. Daynes, Moral controversies in American politics: cases in social regulatory policy. 2nd edition, M.E.

Plot Infected puts players in the role of a police officer in New York City, 3 weeks before Christmas while the entire city is rapidly being infected with a virus that turns people into ravaging, bloodthirsty zombies. The player's blood contains the cure, which less than 1% of the population possesses. The objective is to destroy the infected while trying to reach someone who can make a cure from the blood. Gameplay Gameplay is a frantic over-the-shoulders blaster which revolves around the player's two weapons; A primary weapon and a Viral gun. Players must damage an enemy until their energy level drops to zero. This allows the player to use the Viral gun on them, killing the enemy. Missions include clearing areas and rescuing civilians. There is a gauge called the \\"Infected\\" bar. This has 3 sections to it; one for zombie level, one for area threat and one for the civilian level. If the civilian level drops down very low then the Zombie threat will increase and cause a rush of enemies to the player's vicinity. The enemies in this rush will be a lot more difficult to dispatch. In the game the player can use different avatars which also include band members from Slipknot, as well as Rayne from Bloodrayne, and Mark Hunter from Chimaira. Whenever a player starts a mission, they begin with the lowest weapon available. As more kills are performed, a gauge on the right of the player's display fills up and when the gauge passes certain levels, the next weapon is offered to the player. Players have to maintain their kill rate however, as this gauge does slowly trickle back down if no kills are maintained (i.e. the player will only be able to use lower based weapons again). Weapons are upgradable up to a maximum of level 3. At the same time sub-weapons can become available for purchase, which once bought appear as random drops during missions rather than being equipped from the start. Reception The game received \\"average\\" reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. In his December 11, 2004 review, Jim Schaefer of Detroit Free Press initially gave the game three stars out of four, stating that \\"In these days of bird flu and fears of a real-world pandemic, a game called \\"Infected\\" leaves me a wee bit leery. The big deal about this game is that you can make your mark in it across the world - and I'm not talking about the usual route of racking up points to sit atop some leader board.\\" A week later, however, he raised the grade to all four stars, stating that, \\"The online ability to spread an infection to another player is so innovative that this game gets my top award, even if it's not perfect in other areas.\\" References External links *Official Infected website * Category:2005 video games Category:Majesco Entertainment games Category:PlayStation Portable games Category:Third-person shooters Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games about police officers Category:Video games about viral outbreaks Category:Video games featuring protagonists of selectable gender Category:Zombie video games Category:PlayStation Portable- only games ","title":"Infected (video game)"},{"id":"4489696","text":"The upper (superior) subscapular nerve is the first branch of the posterior cord of the brachial plexus.

Stedeford was chairman and managing director of Tube Investments (T.I.) and one of Britain's leading 20th-century industrialists.  Education  Stedeford was the son of the Reverend Charles Stedeford, who served as President of the United Methodist Conference in 1928. Stedeford began his education at Shebbear College in North Devon. The family frequently moved as Charles Stedeford's ministry took him to different parts of the country and Stedeford finished his education at the King Edward VI Aston in Birmingham.  Early career  Stedeford left school in 1913 to become an engineering apprentice at Wolseley Motors Ltd. In 1917, he decided to play a more active role in the First World War and was commissioned in the Royal Naval Air Service, tasked as a balloon forward air observer, a somewhat static and highly dangerous assignment, even by the standards of other First World War military duties. At the end of the war, he returned to Birmingham and went into partnership to form a motor dealership called Reeve and Stedeford. It had premises in Broad Street, which was then the main route to Edgbaston, where the wealthiest citizens had their homes. It specialised in limousines and sports cars, rapidly becoming successful.  Industrialist  In 1928, Stedeford was persuaded to join Tubes Ltd, the precursor of the small Midlands company Tube Investments Ltd, as sales director. His progress in T.I. was rapid. In three years he became joint managing director of Tubes Ltd., and two years later (1933) was elected to the T.I. board. He was elected Group managing director of T.I. in 1935 and in 1944 added the Chairmanship. He held the combined posts for the next 19 years, during which time T.I. developed from a small local engineering company into one of the biggest companies in the world. He was invited to sit on the boards of the National Provincial Bank (subsequently National Westminster Bank), as Deputy chairman; the Atlas Assurance Company; the Rank Organisation; and the District Bank. During his time running T.I., the company diversified from its reliance on steel tubes into the manufacture of bicycles (Raleigh), domestic products and appliances, aluminium products, precision engineering equipment, motor control equipment and electrical switchgear (Simplex-GE), gas cookers and water heaters, among many other products. One interesting but short-lived operation was the development of the Swallow Doretti sports car. Only about 275 vehicles were made before complaints were received from T.I. clients in the car manufacturing business. Although it was a superior product to its competition, T.I. felt it might be politic not to aggravate some of the larger clients of its steel and aluminium business. Despite recognising the Doretti's qualities, Stedeford showed his legendary toughness and shut the operation down, transferring the employees to other parts of the T.I. group. Internationally, operations were started in Asia, the Americas and Europe. One of these, TI of India Ltd ‚Äì a joint venture with the Murugappa Group ‚Äì led to a highly successful partnership and to one of the largest industrial groups in India. He donated around ¬£5,000 as a contribution to built a hospital to serve the people, and it is named as Sir Ivan Stedeford Hospital in his honour. He inaugurated the hospital in 1966, now it is a major hospital serving the Ambattur region near Madras now called as Chennai in southern India, The Sir Ivan Stedeford Hospital, was a direct result of this close partnership. In 1954, he was created a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE).  The Aluminium War  By 1958, Tube Investments had become a huge company with interests worldwide ‚Äì in 1960 it had profits of ¬£27 million. In 1958 Stedeford conducted the first hostile takeover of a public company in the United Kingdom, in the Aluminium War, when Tube Investments, allied with Reynolds Metals of the United States and advised by Siegmund George Warburg, won the battle for British Aluminium, headed by Lord Portal. Ranged against Stedeford were the vast majority of the blue chip investment houses of the City of London. The battle for British Aluminium was won in the end by Tube Investments/Reynolds Metals' superior bid; the totally inept way Portal and his backers (Hambros Bank, Cazenove's among nearly 30 others) handled the press, and Portal's high-handedness with his own investors (secretly trying to sell British Aluminium at a fraction of the price Stedeford had offered), made this a defining moment in the City's history. At one critical meeting between T.I. and British Aluminium late on a Friday, Portal stood up and declared, \\"My bankers will take over from here\\". Stedeford shot back, \\"If you leave, Lord Portal, I leave!\\" Portal sat back down. On another occasion, while rebuffing the T.I. bid, Portal bizarrely referred to \\"people unaware of the mysteries of negotiations between great companies...\\" Harold Macmillan's Government was encouraged to become involved on British Aluminium's side (he knew both Portal and Stedeford well), but declined, realising that change was needed and that any intervention on the side of British Aluminium would be politically disastrous, in light of Portal's total disregard of his investors' best interests. The Aluminium War rewrote the way the City conducted its business in relation to shareholders and investors, resulting in a more open and competitive landscape. It was the first stage in a process that led to the Big Bang reform of 1986, allowing the City to dominate the international finance markets.  Public service  He was a Governor of the BBC, having been a member of the Beveridge Committee on its structure. He was also a member of the boards of the Bank of England and the UK Atomic Energy Authority. He was on the council of the Department of Scientific Research and a member of the board of the Commonwealth Development Finance Company. He was invited in 1960 by the Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan, to become the Chairman of an Advisory Group on the state of British transport, which became known as the Stedeford Committee. Also on the Committee was Dr Richard Beeching, and the two men clashed on a number of issues connected with Beeching's proposals to reduce drastically the rail infrastructure of Great Britain. In spite of questions being asked in Parliament, Sir Ivan's report was not published at the time. A set of proposals for the future of the railways that came to be known as the \\"Beeching Plan\\" (more usually known as the \\"Beeching Cuts\\" or \\"Beeching Axe\\") was adopted by the Government, resulting in the closure of a third of the rail network and the scrapping of a third of a million freight wagons, much as Stedeford had foreseen and fought against. Stedeford's knighthood was advanced to Knight Grand Cross (GBE) in 1961 for public service.  Character  \\"Sir Ivan always carried his responsibility with a lack of fuss and drama. A tall, slim man, with a rich sense of humour and a scholarly turn of mind he possessed remarkable reserves of energy. He was an engaging conversationalist and writer and a doughty debater. Though he always looked upon the welfare of all employees as a major charge there was no paternalism in his attitude. He expected every employee to make his or her own effort. When this was done, they were given every encouragement to develop to the full extent of their ability. This encouragement took the form of many schemes sponsored by him, such as comprehensive training up to free university for the outstandingly talented. T.I.'s residential training centre was the first of its kind in the country. He also sponsored pensions and free life assurance for all employees, at a time when such benefits were rare.\\" (The Times obituary ‚Äì 11 February 1975)  Retirement  He retired from active management of T.I. in 1963, assuming the title of Life President, having run the company for over 25 years, and having built it into a global industrial powerhouse. Stedeford married Gwendoline Aston in 1923, and they had three daughters. He enjoyed country pursuits, especially fox hunting. He was an Honorable Kentucky Colonel. He died near Stratford-upon-Avon, aged 78. Post Script Sir Ivan was the architect of the sale of Hercules Cycle and Motor Company Ltd to TI in the forties. He was a close neighbour of Sir Edmund Crane at Lapworth and it is said that the deal was done over the garden fence! Sir Edmund later claimed his company had been 'given away'.

Their small numbers are principally concentrated in the islands of Boracay, Panay and Negros. They are genetically related to other Negrito ethnic groups in the Philippines such as the Aeta of Luzon, the Batak of Palawan, the Agta of the Sierra Madres, and the Mamanwa of Mindanao. History A woman at the Kalibo Ati-Atihan Festival. The Negritos were the aboriginal (or first) inhabitants of the Philippine archipelago. They most probably arrived from Borneo 20,000 to 30,000 years ago, through what is thought to be an isthmus (remnants of which today comprise the island of Palawan) that in the prehistoric epoch connected the archipelago to Borneo via a land bridge.. According to some oral traditions, they also predate the Bisaya, who now inhabit most of the Visayas. Legends, such as those involving the Ten Bornean Datus and the Binirayan Festival, tell tales about how, at the beginning of the 12th century when Indonesia and the Philippines were under the rule of Indianized native kingdoms, the ancestors of the Bisaya escaped from Borneo and from the persecution of Rajah Makatunaw. Led by Datu Puti and Datu Sumakwel and sailing with boats called balangays, they landed near a river called Suaragan, on the southwest coast of Panay, (the place then known as Aninipay), and bartered the land from an Ati headman named Polpolan and his son Marikudo for the price of a necklace and one golden salakot. The hills were left to the Atis while the plains and rivers to the Malays. This meeting is commemorated through the Ati-atihan festival. This legend, though, is challenged by some historians. During Spanish colonization, the tribe made contact with the conquistador Legazpi and were made useful in his colonization of Panay. Demographics Language An Ati family in Kalibo, Aklan The Ati speak a Visayan language known as Inati. As of 1980, the speakers of Inati number about 1,500. Hiligaynon and Kinaray-a are also commonly used. Religion The Ati practice a form of animism that involves good and evil spirits. These spirits are nature spirits that often guard rivers, the sea, the sky, as well as the mountains. Sometimes, they may cause disease or comfort. The Ati from Negros refer to them as taglugar or tagapuyo, which literally means \\"inhabiting a place.\\" Christianity has also been adopted due to less isolation and more contact with \\"outsiders.\\"  Ancestral lands  The National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP) granted to the Ati community on Boracay a certificate of ancestral domain title (CADT) in 2010. Atis were harassed and threatened in 2012 on two separate occasions by men identified with resort owners and local officials. Ati youth leader Dexter Condez was killed on February 22, 2013. The killing has not yet been resolved. The Supreme Court upheld the CADT in 2019 after legal challenges were mounted by private claimants. Culture Ati woman in Panay Clothing Not too long ago, like other Negritos in the country, their clothing was simple, with women wearing wraparound skirts, sometimes made out of bark cloth, and men wearing loincloths. However today T-shirts, pants, and rubber sandals are common as daily clothes. Jewelry is simple in nature. Some jewelry objects involve plants such as flowers, while others use animal bones; particularly the teeth of pigs. Medicine Ati are known in Panay as practitioners of herbal medicine. Locals often seek their help in removing leeches from a person's body. Mobility The Negritos traditionally were nomadic people, with the Ati of Panay being known as the most mobile. Now they live in more permanent settlements like Barotac Viejo, island of Guimaras, Igkaputol (Dao), Tina (Hamtic) and Badiang (San Jose de Buenavista). The famous island of Boracay is still regarded as their ancestral land as the area known as Takbuyan, between the municipalities of Tobias Fournier (Dao) and San Joaquin, on the southwestern coast of Panay. Very few of them are now nomadic (mostly women with small children). Ati men traditionally join 'sacadas' workers on time of harvest of sugar plants in places such as Negros or Batangas. Festivals The Ati are the central attraction in the Ati-atihan festival, a festival named in their honor. It is said that the festival is held to commemorate the first appearance of the Roman Catholic Church and the Spaniards in the province of Aklan. According to oral tradition, the Ati helped the Spaniards conquer the native Visayans and, as a reward, the tribe was given a statue of the Santo Ni√±o. In the Dinagyang festival of Iloilo City, also on Panay, performers are also painted to look supposedly like Ati and are organized into \\"tribes\\", called \\"tribus\\", to perform dances with drums, as the Atis are supposed to have done when the Malay arrived and bought Panay from the Ati. Dinagyang is held to celebrate this purchase as well as the arrival in Iloilo of the Santo Ni√±o statue. When the statue first arrived in 1967, a tribe from the Ati-atihan festival was invited to Iloilo to mark the occasion. Atis of Boracay Ati tribe members cultivate the warm sand in Barangay Manoc-manoc in Malay, Aklan. Ati people receiving agricultural tools from the Philippine government during the 2018 Boracay closure and redevelopment. Atis are the original inhabitants of Boracay island. As the island gained fame, Atis were pushed away. They lost their lands and many were rendered homeless. Consequently, many migrated to the Caticlan mainland. However, President Duterte took the initiative of land reforms. In November 2018, land titles of 3.2 hectares were handed over to Atis. Although, this is very small piece from the 1000 hectare area of the whole island. Lack of education, fear of discrimination and being bullied is visible among Atis of Boracay.Productive Employment for Indigenous People The Philippine government through the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) has made efforts to increase Ati employability through scholarships for culinary and aesthetics training programs. Upon completion of these programs, they will graduate with a nationally recognized certificate. The government is also making an effort to create employment opportunities; in 2019, the Aklan provincial government hired two full-time employees from the Ati community to oversee the crop production in the Ati Greenhouse which was set up as a source of income for the Ati community.

This service later (after WW II) became the LAMID (Army Intelligence Service). In 1986, the Government of the Netherlands started a reform of all (Navy, Army and Air Force) military intelligence and security services. The MID (Military Intelligence Service) was formed. In 1989 and 1990 the existing branches (Navy, Army, Air Force, General Intelligence) of the MID were united to make the service stronger.

Published by Tong Li, the literal translation of is 'Rock Fever' or 'Raging Tide', though the comic's official English language title is Youth Gone Wild. The story, dated only by its frequent references to music talents such as Guns N' Roses, Bon Jovi, Garbage and of course Skid Row, follows the lives of a group of young rock musicians hoping to make the big time. Overview Lan YaTing wishes to be the manager of the greatest band in Asia, or maybe even the world. The problem is she keeps getting in trouble with the bands that she manages for a large firm. Eventually she is fired due to her strong willed spirit. Of course it is only then that she meets up with a bunch of characters who, amazingly enough, can play music. Characters *Lan Ya-Ting: Manager: A headstrong woman whose dream is to become the number one manager of a rock band that will change rock and roll forever. She realized that her dream might come true after finding the present members of Death. Currently she is in a romantic relationship with Wang Xiang. *Wang Xiang: Lead Vocalist : A normally cheerful guy who at first was just working odd jobs. After Lan Ya-Ting scouted him he joined Death rather reluctantly and had to train very hard in order to satisfy Shang Guan-Fei. Although he is Lan Ya-Ting's boyfriend he still admires other women and as a result receives evil glares from Ya-Ting. *Shang Guan-Fei: Guitar, is dating Xiao Fie. He is a self-proclaimed guitar god who joined reluctantly after deciding Ya-Ting was his girlfriend. He is verbally abusive to anyone around him especially Wang Xiang and extremely hot-headed and temperamental. He occasionally gets along with the others. He came from a wealthy background, but his narcissistic personality is due to his unhappy childhood where he was an unwanted middle child. His relationship with this elder brother who is also the band's producer is quite explosive. *Luo Kai: Drums, is dating WenLi Vivien. Kai is more beautiful than most girls in terms of looks. He is the most \\"normal\\" member of the group and is level headed, sarcastic and downright blunt at times. He is caring towards his best friend from high school, Zhi-Gao, convincing the latter to leave behind his misery and join the band after Zhi- Gao ran away from him on meeting after several years. Many fans think they are a couple although Kai has a girlfriend. He comes from a rich family as well causing his friends to question why he is a drummer. He was best friends with Zhi in high school and is the only person who can touch him physically. *Ji Zhi-Gao: Bass Guitar. Zhi is the quiet \\"mysterious\\" member of the group. Once passionate about music he was raped by his music mentor several years before the series when he was in high school.

A guard, he played nine seasons (1983‚Äì1992) in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Hansen is currently a commentator for Iowa Hawkeyes basketball broadcasts. Early years Hansen attended Christ The King Elementary school and was a four-year starter at West Des Moines Dowling High School in the late 1970s. As a senior, he averaged 26 points and eleven rebounds per game to lead his team to an Iowa Class 4-A boys' basketball championship in 1979. University of Iowa His success in high school made him a prized recruit for head coach Lute Olson and the Iowa Hawkeyes, where Hansen played a key role on the team that reached the 1980 Final Four. Hanson averaged 5.6 ppg as a freshmen in 1979-1980 as Iowa reached the Final Four. He averaged 8.4 in 1980-1981 as Iowa finished 21-7. He led the 21-8 Hawkeyes with 12.0 ppg in 1981-1982. As a senior in 1982-1983, he helped lead Iowa to the NCAA Sweet 16, averaging 15.4 points and 5.7 rebounds.https://www.sports- reference.com/cbb/schools/iowa/1980.htmllhttps://www.sports- https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/iowa/1981.html As a senior in 1983, he was named as the Hawkeyes' Most Valuable Player. Professional career Hansen was selected by the Utah Jazz in the third round of the 1983 NBA draft, the 54th overall pick. Hansen appeared in 55 games during his rookie season with the Jazz, averaging 2.7 points per game and 7.6 minutes per game. By the 1985‚Äì86 season, Hansen was a regular starter for the Jazz. He was also one of three Jazz players named NBA Player of the Week (March 6, 1986) during the season, joining teammates John Stockton and Karl Malone. Hansen's highest scoring average, 9.7 points per game, came during the 1986‚Äì87 season. During the 1990 All-Star weekend, Hansen participated in the three-point challenge, finishing fourth. Hansen never missed the playoffs in his tenure with the Jazz, while reaching the Western Conference semifinals in both 1984 and 1988. On June 25, 1990, Hansen was involved in a three-team deal in which the Jazz acquired Jeff Malone from the Washington Bullets for Hansen, Eric Leckner and two draft picks. To begin the 1990‚Äì91 season, Hansen suited up for the Sacramento Kings, where he would play for chiefly one season, appearing in just two games for the 1991‚Äì92 Kings before Hansen and the Kings' 1992 second- round pick were traded for Dennis Hopson of the Chicago Bulls. In his final NBA season, and perhaps his best known, Hansen appeared in 66 regular season games and, along with Craig Hodges, served as back-up guard to Michael Jordan. Hansen, who averaged 2.5 points per contest heading into the 1992 NBA Playoffs, would have arguably his most memorable professional contribution during the 1992 NBA Finals. During Game 6, the Bulls, who held a 3-2 series lead over the Portland Trail Blazers, were trailing by 15 points after three quarters. Head coach Phil Jackson decided to pull Jordan from the game in favor of Hansen, hoping for an extra jolt to start what looked to be the final corner of a Finals looking to require seven games to determine a champion. According to longtime Bulls writer Sam Smith, Jackson may have wanted to rest his starters considering no team had ever come back from a 15-point deficit to win an NBA championship, and Hansen started the fourth quarter with a three- pointer, his only field goal of the game, and a steal off Jerome Kersey. Hansen confirmed with the defending Finals MVP Jordan whether he wanted to re- enter the game, but Jordan declined. Scottie Pippen led a 14-2 Bulls rally, and, along with Hansen and fellow reserve big man Stacey King, helped the Bulls get within three points by the time Jordan was put back in the game to replace Hansen. The Bulls completed the comeback, eventually rallying for a 97‚Äì93 victory and winning their second consecutive NBA championship. Hansen was the only player on the roster who had not won a ring with the Bulls during the 1991 Finals and after the Game 6 win, Jordan repeatedly stated, \\"I'm glad for Bobby Hansen.\\" When Hansen gave Jordan the game ball, Jordan replied, \\"I told you I'd get you that ring.\\" Hansen had logged 5 minutes of game time, while Jordan played in 43 minutes. After retirement Having won his championship ring, Hansen retired from the NBA in 1992. Hansen is a color- commentator for Iowa Hawkeyes' basketball broadcasts. He calls games with Gary Dolphin. He has also run many summer basketball camps for Chicago-area children. Former joins Iowa teammates Kevin Boyle and Steve Carfino as basketball analysts. Mark Gannon is also a former analyst.

It is set in a small town where a new psychologist (Loren Dean) gives offbeat advice to the neurotic residents. Both the psychologist and the town are named Mumford, a coincidence that eventually figures in the plot. The film co-stars Hope Davis, Jason Lee, Alfre Woodard, Mary McDonnell, Martin Short, David Paymer, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Ted Danson, and Zooey Deschanel in her film debut. Plot As a relative newcomer to an Oregon town that bears his name, Dr. Mumford (Loren Dean) seems charming and skillful to his neighbors and patients. His unique, frank approach to psychotherapy soon attracts patients away from the two therapists (David Paymer and Jane Adams) already working in the area. Soon he is treating a variety of conditions, ranging from the obsession of one man (Pruitt Taylor Vince) with erotic novels to an unhappily married woman (Mary McDonnell) and her compulsive shopping. Mumford befriends a billionaire computer mogul (Jason Lee) and a cafe waitress (Alfre Woodard) and attempts to play matchmaker. He also begins to fall for a patient (Hope Davis) who suffers from chronic fatigue syndrome. Together with an attorney (Martin Short) who Mumford had rejected as a patient because of his narcissism, the rival therapists conspire to find skeletons in Mumford's closet, hoping to destroy his reputation. Meanwhile, Mumford's inherent likability causes his life to become intertwined with much of the rest of the town.

Reception Mumford was met with mixed reviews. Many critics expressed a general approval, but questioned the unpleasant back story (which contrasted with the overall tone of the film). The film has a 57% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 81 reviews, with an average rating of 5.92/10. The website's critical consensus states: \\"Memorable moments are few and far between.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 62 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Roger Ebert gave a favorable review: \\"There are no earth-shaking payoffs here. No dramatic astonishments, vile betrayals or sexual surprises. Just the careful and loving creation of some characters it is mostly a pleasure to meet. And at its deepest level, profoundly down there below the surface, it is something more, I think: an expression of Kasdan's humanist longings, his wish that people would listen better and value one another more. It is the strangest thing, how this movie sneaks up and makes you feel a little better about yourself.\\" The film, based on a $28 million budget, was a commercial failure, earning only $4,555,459 in the US.

It has mainly been studied for discriminating between tractable and intractable classes of constraint satisfaction problems on finite domains. Solving a constraint satisfaction problem on a finite domain is an NP-complete problem in general. Research has shown a number of polynomial-time subcases, mostly obtained by restricting either the allowed domains or constraints or the way constraints can be placed over the variables. Research has also established a relationship between the constraint satisfaction problem and problems in other areas such as finite model theory and databases. Overview Establishing whether a constraint satisfaction problem on a finite domain has solutions is an NP complete problem in general. This is an easy consequence of a number of other NP complete problems being expressible as constraint satisfaction problems. Such other problems include propositional satisfiability and three-colorability. Tractability can be obtained by considering specific classes of constraint satisfaction problems. As an example, if the domain is binary and all constraints are binary, establishing satisfiability is a polynomial-time problem because this problem is equivalent to 2-SAT, which is tractable. Research has shown a number of tractable subcases. Some of these classes are based on restricting the allowed domains or relations, some on restricting the way constraints are placed over variables, and some on both kinds of restrictions. One line of research used a correspondence between constraint satisfaction problem and the problem of establishing the existence of a homomorphism between two relational structures. This correspondence has been used to link constraint satisfaction with topics traditionally related to database theory. A considered research problem is about the existence of dichotomies among sets of restrictions. This is the question of whether a set of restrictions contains only polynomial-time restrictions and NP-complete restrictions. This question is settled for some sets of restrictions, but still open for the set of all restrictions based on a fixed domain and set of relations, . This is considered by some authors the most important open question about the complexity of constraint satisfaction. Restrictions Tractable subcases of the general constraint satisfaction problems can be obtained by placing suitable restrictions on the problems. Various kinds of restrictions have been considered. Structural and relational restrictions Tractability can be obtained by restricting the possible domains or constraints. In particular, two kinds of restrictions have been considered: * relational restrictions bounds the domain and the values satisfying the constraints; * structural restrictions bounds the way constraints are distributed over the variables. More precisely, a relational restriction specifies a constraint language, which is a domain and a set of relations over this domain. A constraint satisfaction problem meets this restriction if it has exactly this domain and the relation of each constraint is in the given set of relations. In other words, a relational restriction bounds the domain and the set of satisfying values of each constraints, but not how the constraints are placed over variables. This is instead done by structural restrictions. Structural restriction can be checked by looking only at the scopes of constraints (their variables), ignoring their relations (their set of satisfying values). A constraint language is tractable if there exists a polynomial algorithm solving all problems based on the language, that is, using the domain and relations specified in the domain. An example of a tractable constraint language is that of binary domains and binary constraints. Formally, this restriction corresponds to allowing only domains of size 2 and only constraints whose relation is a binary relation. While the second fact implies that the scopes of the constraints are binary, this is not a structural restriction because it does not forbid any constraint to be placed on an arbitrary pair of variables. Incidentally, the problem becomes NP complete if either restriction is lifted: binary constraints and ternary domains can express the graph coloring problem, while ternary constraints and binary domains can express 3-SAT; these two problems are both NP-complete. An example of a tractable class defined in terms of a structural restriction is that of binary acyclic problems. Given a constraint satisfaction problem with only binary constraints, its associated graph has a vertex for every variable and an edge for every constraint; two vertices are joined if they are in a constraint. If the graph of a problem is acyclic, the problem is called acyclic as well. The problem of satisfiability on the class of binary acyclic problem is tractable. This is a structural restriction because it does not place any limit to the domain or to the specific values that satisfy a constraints; rather, it restricts the way constraints are placed over variables. While relational and structural restrictions are the ones mostly used to derive tractable classes of constraint satisfaction, there are some tractable classes that cannot be defined by relational restrictions only or structural restrictions only. The tractable class defined in terms of row convexity cannot be defined only in terms of the relations or only in terms of the structure, as row convexity depends both on the relations and on the order of variables (and therefore cannot be checked by looking only at each constraint in turn). Uniform and non-uniform restrictions The subcase obtained by restricting to a finite constraint language is called a non- uniform problem. These problems are mostly considered when expressing constraint satisfaction in terms of the homomorphism problem, as explained below. Uniform problems were also defined in the settings of homomorphism problems; a uniform problem can be defined as the union of a (possibly infinite) collection of non-uniform problems. A uniform problem made of an infinite set of non-uniform problems can be intractable even if all these non- uniform problems are tractable. Tree-based restrictions Some considered restrictions are based on the tractability of the constraint satisfaction problem where the constraints are all binary and form a tree over the variables. This is a structural restriction, as it can be checked by looking only at the scopes of the constraints, ignoring domains and relations. This restriction is based on primal graph of the problem, which is a graph whose vertices are the variables of the problem and the edges represent the presence of a constraint between two variables. Tractability can however also be obtained by placing the condition of being a tree to the primal graph of problems that are reformulations of the original one. Equivalence conditions Constraint satisfaction problems can be reformulated in terms of other problems, leading to equivalent conditions to tractability. The most used reformulation is that in terms of the homomorphism problem. Constraint satisfaction and the homomorphism problem A link between constraint satisfaction and database theory has been provided in the form of a correspondence between the problem of constraint satisfiability to the problem of checking whether there exists a homomorphism between two relational structures. A relational structure is a mathematical representation of a database: it is a set of values and a set of relations over these values. Formally, A=(V,R^A_1,\\\\ldots,R^A_n), where each R^A_i is a relation over V, that is, a set of tuples of values of V. A relational structure is different from a constraint satisfaction problem because a constraint is a relation and a tuple of variables. Also different is the way in which they are used: for a constraint satisfaction problem, finding a satisfying assignment is the main problem; for a relation structure, the main problem is finding the answer to a query. The constraint satisfaction problem is however related to the problem of establishing the existence of a homomorphism between two relational structures. A homomorphism is a function from the values of the first relation to the values of the second that, when applied to all values of a relation of the first structure, turns it into a subset of the corresponding relation of the second structure. Formally, h is a homomorphism from A=(V,R^A_1,\\\\ldots,R^A_n) to B=(D,R^B_1,\\\\ldots,R^B_n) if it is a function from V to D such that, if (x_1,\\\\ldots,x_k) \\\\in R^A_i then (h(x_1),\\\\ldots,h(x_k)) \\\\in R^B_i. A direct correspondence between the constraint satisfaction problem and the homomorphism problem can be established. For a given constraint satisfaction problem, one can build a pair of relational structures, the first encoding the variables and the signatures of constraints, the second encoding the domains and the relations of the constraints. Satisfiability of the constraint satisfaction problem corresponds to finding a value for every variable such that replacing a value in a signature makes it a tuple in the relation of the constraint. This is possible exactly if this evaluation is a homomorphism between the two relational structures. The inverse correspondence is the opposite one: given two relational structures, one encodes the values of the first in the variables of a constraint satisfaction problem, and the values of the second in the domain of the same problem. For every tuple of every relation of the first structure, there is a constraint having as values the correspondent relation of the second structure. This way, a homomorphism corresponds to mapping every scope of every constraint (every tuple of every relation of the first structure) into a tuple in the relation of the constraint (a tuple in the corresponding relation of the second structure). A non-uniform constraint satisfaction problem is a restriction where the second structure of the homomorphism problem is fixed. In other words, every relational structure defines a non-uniform problem, that of telling whether a relation structure is homomorphic to it. A similar restriction can be placed on the first structure; for any fixed first structure, the homomorphism problem is tractable. A uniform constraint satisfaction problem is an arbitrary restriction to the sets of structures for the first and second structure of the homomorphism problem. Conjunctive query evaluation and containment Since the homomorphism problem is equivalent to conjunctive query evaluation and conjunctive query containment, these two problems are equivalent to constraint satisfaction as well. Join evaluation Every constraint can be viewed as a table in a database, where the variables are interpreted as attributes names and the relation is the set of records in the table. The solutions of a constraint satisfaction problem are the result of an inner join of the tables representing its constraints; therefore, the problem of existence of solutions can be reformulated as the problem of checking whether the result of an inner join of a number of tables is empty. Dichotomy theorems Some constraint languages (or non-uniform problems) are known to correspond to problems solvable in polynomial time, and some others are known to express NP-complete problems. However, it is possible that some constraint languages are neither. It is known by Ladner's theorem that if P is not equal to NP, then there exist problems in NP that are neither polynomial- time nor NP-hard. , it is not known if such problems can be expressed as constraint satisfaction problems with a fixed constraint language. If Ladner languages were not expressible in this way, the set of all constraint languages could be divided exactly into those defining polynomial-time and those defining NP-complete problems; that is, this set would exhibit a dichotomy. Partial results are known for some sets of constraint languages. The best known such result is Schaefer's dichotomy theorem, which proves the existence of a dichotomy in the set of constraint languages on a binary domain. More precisely, it proves that a relation restriction on a binary domain is tractable if all its relations belong to one of six classes, and is NP-complete otherwise. Bulatov proved a dichotomy theorem for domains of three elements. Another dichotomy theorem for constraint languages is the Hell- Nesetril theorem, which shows a dichotomy for problems on binary constraints with a single fixed symmetric relation. In terms of the homomorphism problem, every such problem is equivalent to the existence of a homomorphism from a relational structure to a given fixed undirected graph (an undirected graph can be regarded as a relational structure with a single binary symmetric relation). The Hell-Nesetril theorem proves that every such problem is either polynomial-time or NP-complete. More precisely, the problem is polynomial-time if the graph is 2-colorable, that is, it is bipartite, and is NP-complete otherwise. Sufficient conditions for tractability Some complexity results prove that some restrictions are polynomial without proving that all other possible restrictions of the same kind are NP-hard. Datalog A sufficient condition for tractability is related to expressibility in Datalog. A Boolean Datalog query gives a truth value to a set of literals over a given alphabet, each literal being an expression of the form L(a_1,\\\\ldots,a_n); as a result, a Boolean Datalog query expresses a set of sets of literals, as it can be considered semantically equivalent to the set of all sets of literals that it evaluates to true. On the other hand, a non-uniform problem can be seen as a way for expressing a similar set. For a given non-uniform problem, the set of relations that can be used in constraints is fixed; as a result, one can give unique names R_1,\\\\ldots,R_n to them. An instance of this non-uniform problem can be then written as a set of literals of the form R_i(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n). Among these instances/sets of literals, some are satisfiable and some are not; whether a set of literals is satisfiable depends on the relations, which are specified by the non-uniform problem. In the other way around, a non-uniform problem tells which sets of literals represent satisfiable instances and which ones represent unsatisfiable instances. Once relations are named, a non- uniform problem expresses a set of sets of literals: those associated to satisfiable (or unsatisfiable) instances. A sufficient condition of tractability is that a non-uniform problem is tractable if the set of its unsatisfiable instances can be expressed by a Boolean Datalog query. In other words, if the set of sets of literals that represent unsatisfiable instances of the non-uniform problem is also the set of sets of literals that satisfy a Boolean Datalog query, then the non-uniform problem is tractable. Local consistency Satisfiability can sometimes be established by enforcing a form of local consistency and then checking the existence of an empty domain or constraint relation. This is in general a correct but incomplete unsatisfiability algorithm: a problem may be unsatisfiable even if no empty domain or constraint relation is produced. For some forms of local consistency, this algorithm may also require exponential time. However, for some problems and for some kinds of local consistency, it is correct and polynomial-time. The following conditions exploit the primal graph of the problem, which has a vertex for each variable and an edge between two nodes if the corresponding variables are in a constraint. The following are conditions on binary constraint satisfaction problems where enforcing local consistency is tractable and allows establishing satisfiability: # enforcing arc consistency, if the primal graph is acyclic; # enforcing directional arc consistency for an ordering of the variables that makes the ordered graph of constraint having width 1 (such an ordering exists if and only if the primal graph is a tree, but not all orderings of a tree generate width 1); # enforcing strong directional path consistency for an ordering of the variables that makes the primal graph having induced width 2. A condition that extends the last one holds for non-binary constraint satisfaction problems. Namely, for all problems for which there exists an ordering that makes the primal graph having induced width bounded by a constant i, enforcing strong directional i-consistency is tractable and allows establishing satisfiability. Tree-based conditions Constraint satisfaction problems composed of binary constraints only can be viewed as graphs, where the vertices are variables and the edges represent the presence of a constraint between two variables. This graph is called the Gaifman graph or primal constraint graph (or simply primal graph) of the problem. If the primal graph of a problem is acyclic, establishing satisfiability of the problem is a tractable problem. This is a structural restriction, as it can be checked by looking only at the scopes of the constraints, disregarding their relations and the domain. An acyclic graph is a forest, but connectedness is usually assumed; as a result, the condition that is usually considered is that primal graphs are trees. This property of tree-like constraint satisfaction problems is exploited by decomposition methods, which convert problems into equivalent ones that only contain binary constraints arranged as a tree. The variables of these problems correspond to sets of variables of the original problem; the domain of such a variable is obtained by considering some of the constraints of the original problem whose scope is contained in the corresponding original set of variables; constraints of these new problems represent equality of variables that are contained in two sets. If the graph of one such equivalent problem is a tree, the problem can be solved efficiently. On the other hand, producing one such equivalent problem may be not be efficient because of two factors: the need to determine the combined effects of a group of constraints over a set of variables, and the need to store all tuples of values that satisfy a given group of constraints. Necessary condition for tractability A necessary condition for the tractability of a constraint language based on the universal gadget has been proved. The universal gadget is a particular constraint satisfaction problem that was initially defined for the sake of expressing new relations by projection. The universal gadget A relation that is not present in a constraint language may be \\"simulated\\" by constraints using the relations in the language. In particular, a new relation can be created by placing a set of constraints and using only some of their variables. If all other constraints use only these variables, this set of constraints forces these variable to only assume specific values, practically simulating a new relation. Every constraint satisfaction problem and subset of its variables defines a relation, which is composed by all tuples of values of the variables that can be extended to the other variables to form a solution. Technically, this relation is obtained by projecting the relation having the solutions as rows over the considered variables. The universal gadget is based on the observation that every relation that contains k-tuples can be defined by projecting a relation that contains all possible columns of k elements from the domain. As an example, the following tables shows such a projection: a b c d e f g h b d \\\\--------------- --- 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 -> 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 If the table on the left is the set of solutions of a constraint satisfaction problem, its variables b and d are constrained to the values of the table to the right. As a result, the constraint satisfaction problem can be used to set a constraint whose relation is the table on the right, which may not be in the constraint language. As a result, if a constraint satisfaction problem has the table on the left as its set of solutions, every relation can be expressed by projecting over a suitable set of variables. A way for trying to obtain this table as the set of solution is to place every possible constraint that is not violated by the required solutions. As an example, if the language contains the binary relation representing the Boolean disjunction (a relation containing all tuples of two elements that contains at least a 1), this relation is placed as a constraint on a and b, because their values in the table above are (1,1), (1,1) again, and (1,0). Since all these values satisfy the constraint, the constraint is placed. On the other hand, a constraint with this relation is not placed on b and d, since the restriction of the table above to these two variables contains (0,0) as a third row, and this evaluation violates that constraint. The universal gadget of order k is the constraint satisfaction problem containing all constraints that can be placed in order to obtain the table above. The solutions of the universal gadget include the rows of this table, but can contain other rows. If the solutions are exactly the rows of the table, every relation can be expressed by projecting on a subset of the variables. However, even if the solutions include other rows, some relations can still be expressed. A property of the universal gadget is that it is able to express, by projection, every relation that can be expressed by projection from an arbitrary constraint satisfaction problem based on the same language. More precisely, the universal gadget of order k expresses all relations of k rows that can be expressed in the constraint language. Given a specific relation, its expressibility in the language can be checked by considering an arbitrary list of variables whose columns in the table above (the \\"ideal\\" solutions to the universal gadget) form that relation. The relation can be expressed in the language if and only if the solutions of the universal gadget coincides with the relation when projected over such a list of variables. In other words, one can check expressibility by selecting variables \\"as if\\" the solutions of the universal gadget were like in the table, and then check whether the restriction of the \\"real\\" solutions is actually the same as the relation. In the example above, the expressibility of the relation in the table on the right can be checked by looking whether the solutions of the universal gadget, when restricted to the variables b and d, are exactly the rows of this table. Solutions as functions in the universal gadget A necessary condition for tractability can be expressed in terms of the universal gadget. The solutions of such a gadget can be tabulated as follows: a b c d e f g h \\\\--------------- 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 (solutions that exist by definition) 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 \\\\--------------- .... 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 (other solutions are possible) .... This table is made of two parts. The first part contains the solutions that exist by definition of this problem; the second part (that may be empty) contains all other solutions. Since the columns of the table are by definition associated to the possible k-tuples of values of the domain, every solution can be viewed as a function from a k-tuple of elements to a single element. The function corresponding to a solution can be calculated from the first part of the table above and the solution. As an example, for the last solution marked in the table, this function can be determined for arguments 1,0,1 as follows: first, these three values are the first part of the row \\"c\\" in the table; the value of the function is the value of the solution in the same column, that is, 0. A necessary condition for tractability is the existence of a solution for a universal gadget of some order that is part of some classes of functions. This result however only holds for reduced languages, which are defined below. Squashing functions and reduced domains Squashing functions are functions used to reduce the size of domain of constraint languages. A squashing function is defined in terms of a partition of the domain and a representative element for each set in the partition. The squashing function maps all elements of a set in the partition to the representative element of that set. For such a function being a squashing function it is also necessary that applying the function to all elements of a tuple of a relation in the language produces another tuple in the relation. The partition is assumed to contain at least a set of size greater than one. Formally, given a partition D_1,\\\\ldots,D_n of the domain D containing at least a set of size greater than one, a squashing function is a function s:D \\\\rightarrow D such that s(x)=s(y) for every x,y in the same partition, and for every tuple \\\\langle x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n \\\\rangle \\\\in R, it holds \\\\langle s(x_1),\\\\ldots,s(x_n) \\\\rangle \\\\in R. For constraint problems on a constraint language has a squashing function, the domain can be reduced via the squashing function. Indeed, every element in a set in the partition can be replaced with the result of applying the squashing function to it, as this result is guaranteed to satisfy at least all constraints that were satisfied by the element. As a result, all non- representative elements can be removed from the constraint language. Constraint languages for which no squashing function exist are called reduced languages; equivalently, these are languages on which all reductions via squashing functions have been applied. The necessary condition for tractability The necessary condition for tractability based on the universal gadget holds for reduced languages. Such a language is tractable if the universal gadget has a solution that, when viewed as a function in the way specified above, is either a constant function, a majority function, an idempotent binary function, an affine function, or a semi-projection.

Cat suits are a type of costumed character or creature suit resembling a cat, or any member of the Felidae. They are one of the most popular choices of mascot, and both stylized and realistic cat suits are commonly used in film and on stage, due to the cat's prominence in human culture. They are also used for advertising, entertainment and educational purposes.  In theatre  An elaborate costume of the Cowardly Lion was created for the 1902 musical version of The Wizard of Oz, where it was played by Arthur Hill, a popular animal impersonator. In the musical The Wiz, an African-American retelling of the classic children's novel and musical The Wizard of Oz, costume designer Tony Walton created a cat suit for the Cowardly Lion played by actor Ted Ross. When creating the costumes for the musical Cats, designer John Napier followed the hints in T. S. Eliot's text, blending together the cat and human elements, while ensuring that the costumes were naturally flexible and easy to move in. In 2015, Napier was quoted as saying \\"A bit of a titter went around the theatre community that we were doing a show about pussycats, but I was determined to make it as rough as possible and not like a Puss in Boots pantomime\\". In a review of a production of Cats in Los Angeles, UCLA's student newspaper, the Daily Bruin, described the show's cat costumes as \\"frighteningly realistic\\".  In film  The character of Aslan was portrayed with a realistic two-person puppet suit for the BBC production of The Chronicles of Narnia, where it was worn by Alisa Berk and William Todd-Jones, and voiced by Ronald Pickup.  In sports  Cat suits are widely used as the mascots of sports teams in schools. , the second most popular animal used as high school sports mascot, after the eagle, was the tiger, which is picked because it symbolizes strength. Panthers and wildcats were also fourth and fifth, respectively, symbolizing speed and fierceness, respectively. Other well-known cat mascot suits in sports include the Nittany Lion, which was inducted to the Mascot Hall of Fame. They are also used in professional sports, such as the mascot DJ Kitty, which serves as a secondary mascot for the Tampa Bay Rays. Additionally, cats are commonly used as Olympic mascots. One of the mascots of the 2014 Winter Olympics was a leopard, and one of the two mascots of the 2018 Winter Olympics is Soohorang, a white tiger that is represented by a \\"cute\\" mascot suit.  In advertising  The character Tony the Tiger often makes promotional appearances as a mascot, and an animatronic suit of the character was created in 2016 by Jim Henson's Creature Shop. They are also made by the Olympus Group and serve the purpose of having people relate to the brand. Costumes of the feline characters Puss in Boots and Kitty Softpaws were commissioned by DreamWorks to promote the film Puss in Boots and appeared at its premiere alongside the characters' voice actors.  In education  Suits of the character The Cat in the Hat are sold to schools and communities by the National Education Association to help teach children literacy, by relating it to the books of Dr. Seuss.  In popular culture  The character Hello Kitty is often represented by mascot costumes, although she only bears the appearance of a cat and is not described as one by Sanrio. One of the main characters of the video game 428: Shibuya Scramble is an unknown woman named Tama who wears a cat suit to promote a store.

It is now a living museum listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is located on the bank of the Rio Pueblo de Taos. Name According to Miriam Webster, Hacienda meant a \\"large landed estate\\" in Spanish during the Spanish colonization of the Americas. Its origin is the Old Spanish word facienda, which came from a Latin word that meant to do or things to be done.Hacienda. Merriam Webster Dictionary. Retrieved July 26, 2014. Often, Native Americans were brought on as \\"free wage\\" laborers. File:Mapa del Virreinato de la Nueva Espa√±a (1819).svg|Spanish colonialization in 1819 History Don Antonio Severino Martinez, also known as Severino Martinez, bought the property about 2 miles southwest of the Taos Plaza in 1804, after relocating his family from Abiquiu to Taos that year. At first the building was a four-room dwelling and then it grew as Martinez became more successful. It was made of thick adobe walls, without exterior windows. The hacienda had 2 inner courtyards, or placitas, around which a total of 21 rooms were built. It was constructed as a fortress for protection against attacks by Plains tribes, such as Comanche and Apache raiders. When there was a threat of violence, the livestock were brought into the courtyards of the hacienda for safety. Martinez married Maria del Carmel Santistevan or Maria del Carmen Santisteban in Abiquiu in 1787. They had six children together, all of whom lived after the death of their parents. He was alcalde (mayor) of Taos, a trader and merchant. Owning five square miles of land, it was the largest Taos Valley hacienda and was a working ranch and farm. Severino raised pigs, goats, oxen, mules, burros, horses and sheep. Crops included corn, squash, wheat, peas and chilis. Severino had acquired Navajo and Ute workers for ranch and agricultural work. Maria managed 30 Native American servants on the hacienda, including women who made finished woven or knitted goods from raw wool and tanned leather. The men, women and children who served on the farm were acquired from Native American or Mexican traders. During the Spanish colonial period, goods were either made locally or transported from Mexico City to Taos along the Spanish El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro trade route, of which the hacienda was the final northerly stop. El Camino Real trade is depicted in the hacienda museum's exhibits. He also traded goods along the Santa Fe Trail after it opened up in 1821. Severino Martinez built a flourishing mercantile business trading goods from Northern New Mexico, allowing him to send his son Antonio Jos√© Mart√≠nez to study for the priesthood in Durango, Mexico. Antonio Jos√© was a spiritual leader in Taos from 1826 to 1867. Severino lived at the hacienda until his death in 1827. In his will, Severino left his \\"vast\\" fortune, most of which was made through trade through Chihuahua, Mexico, to his six children, a nephew and 2 emancipated female servants. One of the emancipated women was his half-sister by his father. The Martinez family held on to the property when Mexico took control of New Mexico from Spain, and again when it became a United States territory and state. It was sold in 1931 outside of the family and over the years fell into disrepair. It was purchased and reconstruction began in 1961 by Jerome Milord and his family. In 1969 or 1972 it was sold to the Kit Carson Memorial Foundation who restored the property. The hacienda was fully restored by 1982 to its state in 1820.

Biography Early years Keith was born in Hillsboro Bridge, New Hampshire. He joined the circus (as a \\"candy butcher\\"Laurie, Jr., Joe; Vaudeville: From the Honky-tonks to the Palace, New York: Henry Holt & Co., 1953) after attending Van Amburg's Circus and then worked at Bunnell's Museum in New York City in the early 1860s. He later joined P.T. Barnum and then joined the Forepaugh Circus, before he opened a curio museum in Boston, in 1883, with Colonel William Austin. In 1885 he joined Edward Franklin Albee II, who was selling circus tickets and operating the Boston Bijou Theatre. Their opening show was on July 6, 1885. The theatre was one of the early adopters of the continuous variety show which ran from 10:00 in the morning until 11:00 at night, every day. Previously, shows ran at fixed intervals with several hours of downtime between shows. With the continuous show, you could enter the theatre at any time, and stay until you reached the point in the show where you arrived. Moving pictures Albee and Keith opened the Union Square Theatre in New York City, and it was the site of the first American exhibition of the Lumi√®re Cin√©matographe. They had obtained the exclusive American rights to the Lumi√®re apparatus and their film output, and the first showing was on June 29, 1896. They then opened theatres in Philadelphia, and Boston, and then smaller theatres in the East and Midwest of the United States, buying out rival smaller chains. They signed a contract with Biograph Studios in 1896 which lasted until July 1905 when they switched to Edison Studios as their supplier of motion pictures. Keith and Albee merged their theatre circuit with Frederick Freeman Proctor in June 1906. Death Keith withdrew from business in 1909 and married for a second time on October 29, 1913, to Ethel Bird Chase (1887-1971). She was 26 years old and Keith was 67. Her father was P. B. Chase. Keith died at the Breakers Hotel in Palm Beach, Florida in 1914. After his son, Andrew Keith, died in 1918, control of the company went to Albee. Legacy In 1928, the B. F. Keith Circuit merged with the Orpheum Circuit to form the Keith-Albee-Orpheum (KAO) corporation in Marysville, Washington. In a few months, this organization became the major motion picture studio Radio-Keith-Orpheum (RKO). Also in 1928 the B.F. Keith Memorial Theatre opened in Boston. Keith Academy and Keith Hall in Lowell, Massachusetts were named for his family in 1926. His son A. Paul Keith had donated family money to Cardinal William O'Connell.

The name is identical with the word berg meaning 'rocky hill; mountain'. Berg Church Berg stone church (Berg steinkirke) dates from ca. 1100. The edifice is in Romanesque style and built of brick with natural stone in the corners. The medieval era building has an oblong nave and a smaller square choir. The pulpit is from 1592. In the nave hangs a painting of the Crucifixion and a copy of an epitaph on a plaque from 1601. The original is located at the Norwegian Museum of Cultural History. To the right of the choir hangs a tablet with figures of the twelve apostles dating from the 1600s. After a new church was built on the site in 1878, the old medieval church was partially demolished in 1882. The church was rebuilt in 1970.

Harkness (born May 7, 1940) is an American former professional basketball player. He played for the New York Knicks of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the Indiana Pacers of the American Basketball Association (ABA). Harkness attended Loyola of Chicago, where he was captain of the 1962‚Äì1963 team that won the 1963 NCAA Title. He is a civil rights activist. Early life and career Harkness was born in Harlem. Before playing in the professional leagues, the 6'3\\" Harkness was a star at DeWitt Clinton High School and Loyola University Chicago. Harkness angling for a lay- up against Mississippi State in the 1963 NCAA Tournament At Loyola, he served as captain of the team that made a run through the 1963 NCAA Tournament to win the national championship. In the first round of the tournament, Loyola defeated Tennessee Tech by 111‚Äì42, which remains the largest margin of victory (69 points) in an NCAA Tournament game. In the second round, Loyola faced Mississippi State in a historic match now known as the Game of Change. Facing Loyola's lineup with four black starters, Mississippi State defied segregationists by participating, breaking an unwritten law against Mississippi teams competing against teams with black players. Harkness was enshrined in history as he shook hands Joe Dan Gold, the white captain of Mississippi State, prior to tip-off. In a 2013 interview, Harkness told NPR of the handshake: \\"The flashbulbs just went off unbelievably, and at that time, boy, I knew that this was more than just a game. This was history being made.\\" Loyola beat Mississippi State, then sailed past Illinois and Duke to reach the tournament final. Loyola then upset the Cincinnati Bearcats in overtime to win the 1963 NCAA Basketball Championship. Harkness and the other four Loyola starters played the entire game, without substitution. He then advanced to the pros after being drafted by the New York Knicks in the 2nd round (10th pick overall) of the 1963 NBA draft. Harkness played one season (1963‚Äì64) with the NBA's New York Knicks. He then played two seasons (1967‚Äì1969) with the ABA's Indiana Pacers. Though his professional career was relatively short, he left his mark in the record books on November 13, 1967, when he hit a game-winning buzzer beater to lead the Pacers past the Dallas Chaparrals. This is still the longest shot ever made in any American professional basketball game. Life after basketball Harkness became the first African-American salesman for Quaker Oats. In 1970, Harkness became the first African-American fundraiser in Indianapolis, working for the United Way of Greater Indianapolis. He was Indianapolis' first African-American sportscaster at WTHR (formerly WLWI) in the mid to late 1970s. He has also devoted much of his time to civil rights issues. He worked with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in the early 1970s, and he currently serves as executive director of the Indianapolis chapter of 100 Black Men, a national organization dedicated to supporting and training young African American males. Awards and honors President Obama meets Harkness (second from left) and others from the 1963 Ramblers team in 2013. On July 11, 2013, in the Oval Office of the White House, Harkness and former Loyola teammates John Egan, Les Hunter and Ron Miller met with President Barack Obama to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the school's 1963 national championship. To date it remains the only NCAA Division I basketball championship won by a university from the state of Illinois. In September 2013, Harkness and the entire 1963 Loyola Ramblers NCAA Championship basketball team was inducted into the Chicagoland Sports Hall of Fame. The 1963 Loyola Ramblers were inducted in the College Basketball Hall of Fame in November 2013., making it the first team inducted into the Hall of Fame.

It received its charter in 1865, but the origins date back to the autumn of 1861 when a group of college friends, principally Yale alumni, founded the club hoping to extend their collegial ties. The club is not affiliated with any other University Club or college alumni clubs. The club is considered one of the most prestigious in New York City History The first meeting was held in the rooms of the Columbia College Law School (now the Columbia University Law School), where Theodore Dwight, the Club's first president and a Hamilton College alumnus, was a professor. After several moves, the club took over an existing townhouse at 26th Street and Madison Avenue, in 1883. Founded to celebrate the union of social duty and intellectual life, the Club states in its charter that the purpose of the organization shall be the \\"promotion of Literature and Art by establishing and maintaining a Library, Reading Room and Gallery of Art, and by such other means as shall be expedient and proper for such purposes.\\" In addition to its many grand architectural features, the University Club hosts one of New York's great private art collections, with a particularly strong group of works by great American painters such as Gilbert Stuart and Childe Hassam, who featured the Club's facade in his work Allies Day, May 1917. The club was all-male until 1987. Building By the 1890s, with its membership limited by the size of its building to 1,500 resident members and 900 who lived elsewhere, the Club was looking for a larger space, because it had nearly 600 people on a waiting list to join. It acquired the St. Luke's Hospital site and proceeded to seek an architecture firm. The firm of Charles Follen McKim, William Mead and Stanford White, who were all members, got the architectural commission and went on to design what remains one of the grandest clubhouses of the city's prominent social clubs. Erected in 1899, in a Mediterranean Revival Italian Renaissance palazzo-style, the building is particularly noted for its reading room (with ceiling murals by H. Siddons Mowbray modeled after the Vatican Apartments), dining room, and the attempt made by the architects to disguise a nine-story building behind what seems to be a three-story facade. McKim, Mead and White commissioned Edward F. Caldwell & Co. to provide light fixtures for the University Club among other architectural commissions for the company. Notable areas Reading Room The Reading Room is located on the first floor adjacent to the lobby. It has several large arched windows overlooking the streets, flat pilasters along the walls and a high, flat gilded ceiling with a large fresco at the center. Library The Library is located on the fourth floor and is not open to the public. It was originally called the Club Library and was located on the Library Floor (second floor).Alexander, James Waddle.

It has a gilded vaulted ceiling, dark wood paneling, sculpture busts and large arched windows. It is finely decorated with an overall decor reminiscent of the Borgia Apartments at the Vatican. There are approximately 100,000 books and periodicals. The bookcases are parallel arranged in rows having two levels with catwalks to access the second level.

The word Manmukh consists of two parts: Man and Mukh. Man means \\"one's own mind or one's own desires\\" and Mukh literally means \\"face\\", so the full word conveys the message \\"One who follows whichever way his or her mind leads or goes\\"; \\"one who follows his or her desires\\"; \\"one who does as his or her mind dictates\\". The Manmukh is attached to worldly desires, material wealth, worldly allurements and sensual enjoyments. His desires and his needs are unlimited. To be a Manmukh is to follow one's own mind or desires without regards for anyone else. A person who is self-centred is called a Manmukh. The opposite of Manmukh is Gurmukh, which means a person who follows the teaching and life- code as narrated by the guru. A Manmukh is the opposite of a Gurmukh. Hence, a Manmukh is a material being (egoistic or attached to worldly things) as opposed to a spiritual being. The people with materialistic attachment believe that everlasting happiness is attainable only in acquisition (i.e. ownership) and the use of these material objects. In other words, a Manmukh is ruled by and is conditioned by pleasure of his five senses and his mind. Simply stated, a Manmukh is an ego-centric person whose actions are controlled by the following urges and desires: lust, anger, greed, material attachment, self- conceit, envy and stubborn mindedness, with their numerous variations. As a result, he has no belief no understanding of the Naam (God's existence), Shabad (word of the guru), Hukam (will of the Almighty), Atma (Soul), or God (Spirit or Sat Guru). Consequently, he has no understanding of the ultimate purpose of life, his relationship with God, and the way of God (Gurmat). In this madness and illusion and \\"I-am-ness\\", he cultivates the life of a faithless cynic called \\"Saakat\\" ‚Äî an unwise and an untrue being. Thus, according to the Gurbani, anyone who has not realized the Self within (God, Truth, Shabad or Naam, etc.) alone is a Manmukh. Everyone in the world can be categorised as either a servant of Maya or a servant of the Akal. Those who serve Maya are called Manmukhs, and those who serve the Truth (God) are called Gurmukhs or Divine. Thus, a Manmukh regardless of how advanced he may be in his or her material qualifications by education or cultural status, lacks in Divine qualities; consequently, is not aware of the Cosmic Reality that is contained within him/her. Such individuals fail to attain Spiritual Perfection or Intuitive Understanding of the \\"ultimate reality\\"; for their intellect is dimmed by material contamination. They hate holiness. They chase after Maya, and wander in this dense forest of material existence like a beast in human garb. A Manmukh lifestyle is void of humility, contentment, compassion, love and spiritual wisdom. Such lifestyle exhibits nothing but undesirable qualities in a person. To make us aware of Manmukhs and their conduct, Gurbani has provided us with numerous symptoms of such material beings caught in the vertex of unenlightened existence. Some of these symptoms include: egoism, ignorance, selfishness, duality, bondage, evil-mindedness, falsehood, violence, untruthfulness, doubts, superstitions, uncontrolled senses, identification with the feeling of \\"I, me, mine, your\\", lust, anger, greed, attachment, self pride, self-conceit; superstitious, jealousy and enviousness, stubborn mindedness, hatred, fanaticism, conflicts, lack of contentment, material hankering and lamentation, lack of mental control and inner peace, self-centredness, are full of quarrel and contentions, lack of faith, ritualistic, unhappy, always interested in taking instead of giving, affinity for bad association, lack of self-discipline, mental agitation, unceasing wandering (rat-race), begging material things from God, complaining, finding faults in others, unable to bear pains and sorrows of life, love for material world instead of the Self within, corruption, fraud, larceny and swindling, bribery, cheating, lying, plundering, stealing, fond of mental speculations and material logic, attachment to material world, deceitful nature, fearful, unceasing desire for sense objects, cynicism, hypocrisy, always wanting to control the world, always wanting to be appreciated, unceasing hunger for name and fame, love for titles and honor, divisiveness, prejudices, cruelty, bigotry, unnatural diet, indulgence in worldly pleasures, illusion, delusion, wrong identity, stupor, obstinate error, love of Maya or worldliness, crookedness, animosity, and so on. Opposite to these are the attributes of Gurmukhs (Spiritual Beings) According to the Gurbani, a Manmukh is not a question of heredity, family of birth, ancestry, race, region, social status, caste, creed, education, titles, religion or any peculiar external appearance of a person; it is a question of lack of Naam Simran, self-evaluation, unenlightened existence, cynicism, egoism, ignorance, hypocrisy, bondage, mental delusion, body-consciousness, mistaken identity, and so on. The Sikh scriptures have some very harsh word to say to the Manmukh. Below are several quotations from the Holy Text: * See www.srigranth.org for the full text of all these Shabads.

It was his only work of fiction. It was largely autobiographical, including details about the title character's friendship and love for a violinist, and his attachment to his native Trieste. As one critic says: \\"he revisited not only the scenes but also the moods of his puberty\\". A screenplay freely adapted from the novel served as the basis for an Italian-language film of the same name in 1979. Plot summary The events in the novel take place in the course of a month in 1898 in Trieste. Ernesto, a 16-year-old apprentice clerk to a flour merchant named Wilder, lives with his mother and aunt. He and his mother rely on the charity of relatives, whose control Ernesto resents. When he was thirteen, he spent a perfect summer reading the Arabian Nights. He adopts leftist political views, partly out of conviction and partly to needle Wilder. He has his first sexual experiences on several occasions with a 28-year-old laborer identified as \\"the man\\". Their roles reflect classical models, with the older man insisting that since he has a beard he must be the active partner in intercourse. Ernesto also has one experience with a female prostitute. He imagines a different life for himself, perhaps as an adored concert violinist, though he lacks talent. His tentative approach to manhood is reflected in a visit to the barber where he has his first shave, though he hardly seems to need it. He becomes resentful about being overworked, though he refuses to share tasks with a younger assistant. He resents his employer and resigns his post with an insulting letter. Ending his employment will also end his casual encounters with \\"the man\\" at work. His mother succeeds in arranging for his employer to rehire Ernesto, who then reveals his sexual history to his mother to avoid taking up his clerk's post again. That night Ernesto attends a violin recital and at intermission sees a beautiful boy a bit younger than himself but fails to locate him at the end of the concert. They meet by chance the next day, discovering they have the same violin teacher. \\"They could have been two puppies, who instead of wagging their tails were smiling at each other.\\" Ernesto says he has just turned 17 and the other boy, Emilio called \\"Ilio\\", is 15 and a half and a more talented violin student than Ernesto. They decide to be friends. Composition and publication Mindful of how his treatment of same-sex relations would offend most readers in Italy in the 1950s, Saba did not plan to publish this work. He wrote: \\"I knew as soon as I'd written the first sentence that this wouldn't be for publication.\\" He allowed only a select few to read his manuscript. He read selections to other residents of the Roman asylum where he was living when he started writing in 1953. Still struggling against depression, he moved home to Trieste. When he shared a few pages by mail with his daughter Linuccia, he included ‚Äúparanoid instructions‚Äù for protecting and returning the draft. He planned to continue the story through Ernesto's adolescence to his discovery of poetry, which would be his life's work, and his first experience of love. When Saba completed four episodes, concluding with Ernesto's confession to his mother, he wrote a one- page explanation for the reader that interrupts the narrative. He titled it \\"Almost a Conclusion\\". He described his inability to continue writing: \\"Add to those pages, Ernesto's breakthrough to his true calling, and you would in fact, have the complete story of his adolescence. Unfortunately, the author is too old, too weary and embittered to summon up the strength to write all that.\\" He wrote only a fifth episode that recounts the violin recital and the beginning of Ernesto's friendship with Ilio. In August 1953 he ordered the destruction of his manuscript and the novel was left unfinished at his death in 1957. His daughter Linuccia arranged for its publication by Einaudi in 1975. Carcanet Press published an English translation by Mark Thompson in 1987, with a cover image in saturated colors of a woman walking along the seacoast taken from a painting by a Trieste artist. It received wider distribution in 1989 in editions by Paladin in London and HarperCollins in New York. A New York Times critic noted that Saba's \\"forthrightness ... would certainly have raised eyebrows\\" in the 1950s but that \\"Anyone reading these scenes today, however, will probably find their sexually explicit content redeemed by the unfailingly affectionate tone.\\" New York Review Books published a translation by Estelle Gilson in 2017. The Irish writer Aidan Higgins classed its treatment of adolescent sexuality with the work of an earlier generation of writers, E. M. Forster's Maurice and Thomas Mann's Death in Venice. He wrote: \\"The love that dare not speak its name here hardly bring itself to utter words above a whisper.\\" Originally published in the Financial Times. Elsa Morante praised its handling of \\"innocent sensuality\\" in \\"this ideal boy\\". Saba wrote in dialect and paid close attention to language and register as his characters navigate social relations using formal and informal terms of address between employer and clerk, clerk and laborer, senior and junior clerk, and even new teenage friends. Ernesto's mother speaks to him in proper Italian rather than local dialect, while Wilder prefers German and relies on Ernesto principally for his Italian-language correspondence.

The presence of Heinz bodies represents damage to hemoglobin and is classically observed in G6PD deficiency, a genetic disorder that causes hemolytic anemia. In veterinary medicine, Heinz bodies may be seen following the consumption of foods containing thiosulfate compounds by cats, dogs and certain primates. History They are named after Robert Heinz (1865‚Äì1924), a German physician who in 1890 described these inclusions in connection with cases of hemolytic anemia.R. Heinz. Morphologische Ver√§nderungen des roten Blutk√∂rperchens durch Gifte. [Virchows] Archiv f√ºr pathologische Anatomie und Physiologie und f√ºr klinische Medicin, Berlin, 1890, 122: 112-116. Form and appearance Heinz body stain of feline blood, showing three distinct Heinz bodies.Heinz bodies appear as small round inclusions within the red cell body, though they are not visible when stained with Romanowsky dyes. They are visualized more clearly with supravital stainingThe Morphology of Human Blood Cells Ann Bell; Sabath Sallah. Abbot Co. 2005. (e.g., with new methylene blue, crystal violet or bromocresol green). Causes Heinz bodies are formed by damage to the hemoglobin component molecules, usually through oxidant damage by administered drugs, or from an inherited mutation (i.e. change of an internal amino acid residue). As a result, an electron from the hemoglobin is transferred to an oxygen molecule, which creates a reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can cause severe cell damage leading to premature cell lysis.Voet&Voet; Biochemistry p340 Damaged cells are cleared by macrophages in the spleen, where the precipitate and damaged membrane are removed, leading to characteristic \\"bite cells\\". The denaturing process is irreversible and the continual elimination of damaged cells leads to Heinz body anemia. There are several pathways leading to the hemoglobin damage. * NADPH deficiency can cause a dysfunction in glutathione peroxidase which is an enzyme that converts hydrogen peroxide (a reactive oxygen species) into water. * G6PD (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) deficiency exacerbated by administration of oxidant drugs (e.g., primaquine, dapsone, quinidine) can also result in Heinz bodies. G6PD deficient red cells in combination with high levels of oxidants causes a cross-linking of sulfhydryl groups on globin chains which causes a denaturing and formation of Heinz body precipitates.Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson; Aster, Jon (2009-05-28). Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, Professional Edition: Expert Consult - Online (Robbins Pathology) (Kindle Locations 33368-33370). Elsevier Health. Kindle Edition. * Heinz bodies can also be found in chronic liver disease. * Alpha-thalassemia. Normal adult hemoglobin is composed of two alpha and two beta chains. Alpha thalassemia patients have partial or complete defects in alpha globin production, leading to a relative abundance of beta globin chains in the cell. These excess beta globin chains aggregate to form HbH, which has decreased solubility and precipitates in the red blood cell cytoplasm. This is not direct damage to hemoglobin per se, but rather a perturbation in the quaternary structure of hemoglobin. The presence of Heinz bodies may also be a feature of hyposplenism or asplenia, when a damaged or absent spleen cannot remove these damaged cells from circulation. Veterinary In veterinary medicine, Heinz bodies are associated with the consumption of paracetamol (acetaminophen), garlic, and onions by cats,Anemia caused by onions Wissman, Margaret A., Simian, date unknown dogs, and various primates. Thiosulfate compounds in the flesh of onions have been identified as the cause. Propylene glycol was once a common ingredient in soft moist cat food. According to the FDA \\"It was known for some time that propylene glycol caused Heinz Body formation in the red blood cells of cats (small clumps of proteins seen in the cells when viewed under the microscope), but it could not be shown to cause overt anemia or other clinical effects. However, recent reports in the veterinary literature of scientifically sound studies have shown that propylene glycol reduces the red blood cell survival time, renders red blood cells more susceptible to oxidative damage, and has other adverse effects in cats consuming the substance at levels found in soft-moist food.\\"Heinz Body Anemia in Cats\\" Tarigo-Martinie, Jaime and Krimer, Paula (accessed Sept. 2006) In light of this new data, CVM amended the regulations to expressly prohibit the use of propylene glycol in cat foods.\\" Treatment There is no specific treatment for Heinz bodies; however, they are important as a diagnostic indicator for the causative conditions listed above.

It had a population of 4,717 in 2001,Office for National Statistics : Census 2001 : Parish Headcounts : Braintree Retrieved 2009-11-24 reducing to 3,587 at the 2011 Census. It is now home to several businesses including Knight Group and Lysanda. Brockwell Meadows Local Nature Reserve is south-east of the village between a housing estate and the River Blackwater. Origins The existing village of Kelvedon has been a settlement since the Early Middle Ages, though it stands near (and partly on) the site of a Roman settlement, probably Canonium. The earliest surviving part of its parish church, St Mary the Virgin Church probably dates to the early 12th century.http://www.british- history.ac.uk/rchme/essex/vol3/pp140-146 The village's first school, Ayletts Foundation School, was founded by Thomas Aylett in Maldon Road, Kelvedon, in 1632 when he bequeathed the property along with ¬£10 per annum to provide a salary for a master. The village is bounded to the north by the River Blackwater where the adjacent village of Feering starts. The River Blackwater was spanned by a packhorse bridge, built around 1750, which was an essential part of the main road carrying traffic from Norfolk and Suffolk to London and this feature was significant in making Kelvedon an important staging post on the main route to London, as could be seen from the numerous inns and hostelries which served the area. Kelvedon expanded significantly in the Victorian era. The reason was the Norwich to London railway making it a place to live yet get to work as rail was the only fast method of transport. Victorian Kelvedon was set along one street, High Street. In the late 19th century, Kelvedon became famous for seed growing, and the firm of Kings Seeds, now part of Associated British Foods, became famous for the production of flower and vegetable seeds. Another large seed merchant, based nearby in the hamlet of Inworth, and trading worldwide was E W Deal & Sons (a founder member of Asmer Seeds based in Leicester) who were famous for developing the Kelvedon Wonder Pea and other varieties of flowers and vegetables. In the 1930s, with the advent of the automobile, High Street became the A12, the main road through Essex. Ribbon development saw houses sprawl along the road for miles. Ayletts Foundation School closed in 1944, though its building still stands and now houses the Kelvedon Library and Museum. It was replaced by the Kelvedon St Mary's School, a Church of England primary school located on the corner of High Street and Easterford Road (now the Kelvedon and Feering Health Centre and a private residence). It was in turn replaced in 1977 by a new school located in Docwra Road, also called Kelvedon St Marys. This school converted to academy status in March 2013. The village suffered major congestion until a bypass was built in the 1960s diverting the A12 past the village. Suburbanization started to take place in the 1980s when a large development, called Riverside Park, was constructed adding hundreds of homes to the village envelope. Transport Kelvedon railway station is on the London Liverpool St. line with trains approximately every 20 minutes. With a minimum journey time of 55 minutes to Liverpool Street Kelvedon is a desirable location for commuters working in the city of London. Bus services are provided by the 71 First Bus service Chelmsford‚ÄìColchester route and the Hedingham & District 91 service from Tollesbury‚ÄìWitham. Kelvedon runs alongside the A12 dual carriageway and therefore has automotive links with the rest of East Anglia south through Essex or Norfolk & Suffolk to the north. Notable residents * Susanna Corder (1787‚Äì1864), educationist and Quaker biographer was born here. * C.H. Spurgeon, known as the \\"Prince of Preachers\\", was born in Kelvedon on 19 June 1834. Charles Spurgeon was a powerful preacher of the Victorian era and boasted the largest congregation in London, to the extent that his weekly sermon was printed and sold by the thousands. The Metropolitan Tabernacle was built for him. Charles Spurgeon never returned to Kelvedon to preach although he was invited in 1853 to do so in the new Independent Chapel built in the village, an invitation which he refused. There is a blue plaque on a building in Kelvedon High Street commemorating the place of his birth. * Actress Juliet Stevenson was born in Kelvedon. * Actor Jeremy Sheffield, spent part of his childhood living in Kelvedon. * Actor John Dagleish was born and raised in Kelvedon.

A type of sulfate-reducing bacteria, Desulfotomaculum can cause food spoilage in poorly processed canned foods. Their presence can be identified by the release of hydrogen sulfide gas with its rotten egg smell when the can is first opened. They are endospore-forming bacteria. A new strain of Desulfotomaculum, called Desulforudis audaxviator, was discovered in 2005 during drilling 2.8 km deep in the Mponeng gold mine in South Africa. The strain, found in water which has been isolated for tens of millions of years, exists completely independent of photosynthesis. The bacteria uses radiolytically-produced H2, which is generated in that environment by the energy released by radioisotopes, as well as SO42‚àí which may be generated both by the energy released by radioisotopes as well as by other chemical reactions, to form hydrogen sulfide, H2S, which replaces the hydrogen bonds produced by normal photosynthesis. This discovery holds great promise, as it proves that organisms can obtain energy from sources other than from the sun or other stars, which means similar life-forms may be found on other planets in the Solar System and elsewhere. Desulfotomaculum are straight or curved rods, are highly heat resistant and a free-living fixer of atmospheric nitrogen.

It is one of two public university systems, the other being the University of Tennessee system. It was authorized by an act of the Tennessee General Assembly passed in 1972. The TBR supervises all public community colleges and technical colleges in the state, dealing with over 100,000 students annually. It was founded as the State University and Community College System of Tennessee. The TBR comprises 40 institutions: 13 community colleges and 27 Tennessee Colleges of Applied Technology, which are listed below. The Colleges of Applied Technology were added to TBR control in 1982. Unlike the situation in most states, TBR component institutions do not have their own board of directors, board of trustees, or similar bodies at the campus level; the TBR hires institution presidents and directors and approves the promotions of senior faculty and staff. In 2015 Tennessee governor Bill Haslam announced a plan for the six universities of the TBR system to gain their own governing boards, while noting that \\"TBR would continue to provide key administrative support to the six state universities.\\" The professional head of the TBR system is referred to as its Chancellor. The chancellor is responsible for guiding the TBR system in accordance with the board's direction and for managing the TBR central office in a manner consistent with the central office's mission and vision. Operational responsibilities and processes include day-to-day management of the system and the central office; board coordination, communication and logistics; presidential searches; and dealing with the media and the general public, including handling complaints and general information requests. The leaders of TBR universities, community colleges, and TCATs are referred to as Presidents.

Debbie is Walford's first upwardly mobile character. She has an on/off relationship with her ill-fated boyfriend Andy O'Brien (Ross Davidson) and she tends to be a bit too pretentious for the working class locals of Albert Square. Storylines Debbie moves to Albert Square with her boyfriend, nurse Andy O'Brien (Ross Davidson) in March 1985. At the time of their arrival, they are the only upwardly mobile residents. They throw cocktail parties, get involved in campaigns and protests, and jog in matching track suits, much to the bemusement of the locals. Many of Debbie‚Äôs working class neighbours find her stuck-up; none of them know that Debbie had actually been raised in a Walford council estate, not far from Albert Square. Debbie and Andy have a rocky relationship. Ambitious and determined, Debbie's interests focus upon success, whilst Andy wants to settle down and start a family. When Debbie leaves a steady job as a bank clerk in order to start her own business and make fast money, Andy is furious as they then have insufficient funds to repay their mortgage. Various rows erupt, and Debbie soon discovers that starting her own business is not as easy as she had expected. Without regular work, Debbie begins to struggle financially. Andy asks Debbie to marry him and for Christmas 1985, he buys her an engagement ring; however, she is mugged on New Year's Eve and it is stolen. Andy subsequently becomes over-protective, which infuriates Debbie as it goes against her ideals of female equality. The situation between Debbie and Andy is complicated further by local policeman Roy Quick (Douglas Fielding), who begins wooing Debbie early in 1986. This leads to Debbie and Andy having an open relationship; dating other people, but living together. The situation is not ideal however, as Andy gets jealous seeing Debbie pursued. Roy is infatuated with Debbie and asks her to marry him several times, but Debbie declines when she realises she wants to marry Andy after all. Debbie and Andy's happiness does not to last as in August 1986 Andy runs in front of a truck to save a toddler from being hit and is killed. Debbie‚Äôs grief is compounded with guilt as her last words to Andy during a row are \\"drop dead\\". Debbie is unable to pay her mortgage after Andy dies so she moves in with her friend Naima Jeffery (Shreela Ghosh). In 1987 the women of Walford are targeted by a man known as the \\"Walford attacker\\". Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean), Sue Osman (Sandy Ratcliff) and Pat Wicks (Pam St. Clement) all have encounters with the attacker and in April that year, Debbie is attacked too. While she is alone in the launderette, the \\"Walford attacker\\" (Colum Gallivan) attempts to assault her. Debbie manages to ward him off using self- defence, which leads to his eventual capture. Debbie's heroic act leads to her meeting Detective Terry Rich (Gary Whelan), who is investigating the case. He asks Debbie to act as his girlfriend in an under-cover stake-out being held in a restaurant, and after getting to know each other they begin dating. When Terry is transferred to another division in Crawley, Debbie decides to leave with him. They get engaged and throw a celebratory leaving party in The Queen Vic, departing in May 1987. Debbie's last words to her friends and neighbours are a paraphrasing of Rhett Butler's famous line in the 1939 film Gone With The Wind, when she says \\"You know love, quite frankly I don't give a damn\\"! Two months after leaving Walford, Debbie writes to Naima to tell her that she is pregnant; Debbie and Terry marry off-screen.  Character creation and development  Debbie Wilkins was one of the original twenty-three characters invented by the creators of EastEnders, Tony Holland and Julia Smith. The character of Debbie along with her boyfriend Andy O'Brien (Ross Davidson) were an attempt by Holland and Smith to represent the influx of upwardly mobile people that were opting to move to the usually working-class areas of the East End of London. Gentrification of the East End was on the increase in the 1980s, and in Holland's experience, the new, wealthier residents were never welcomed or truly accepted within the community, and this was what he hoped to convey on-screen with these two characters. Debbie's original character outline as written by Smith and Holland appeared in an abridged form in their book, EastEnders: The Inside Story. :\\"Debbie and Andy are living together, they're not married ‚Äî but it's a serious relationship. The mortgage is in her name... Debbie is bossy and a planner... She and her mother decided at an early stage to beat the East-end at its own game, and get Debbie into a different environment... She wanted to work in a bank and do well... She became part of a household of six: three women, three men in a huge shared flat in Wandsworth... Andy used to come over and visit her... A strange stilted courtship began... They moved to the Square, so Debbie's back in the area that she came from... Partners, in love, and determined to make it the best home ever ‚Äî they are not so much acquisitive, as lovers of their comfort... Her interfering manner upsets other occupants of the Square... Andy knows she has an unfortunate manner and tries to cover for her when he can. Debbie isn't a snob in the social sense, but as she's skilled labour ‚Äî a professional woman ‚Äî she's bound to feel sometimes slightly a cut above the others... Actually, not being accepted by others, being made to feel that they're \\"outsiders\\" will frequently prompt Andy and Debbie to consider moving out... Unlike Debbie, who's an ambitious woman working in a traditionally male world, Andy is a very unambitious man working in a traditionally female world... They became in love with the idea that everyone thought they were the perfect couple... The decision to attempt the experiment of living together: A \\"domestic\\" relationship, was a difficult one, and they agonised over it for months. Wouldn't they get bored? Would they feel imprisoned? How would they fill the hours, with only the two of them?... They want to knock down walls, put in double-glazing, and all the rest of it.... Forced to move into a different class... They're not habitat/Guardian East-end, and they're certainly not nouveau-riche, but they are, to a lot of people, a possible sign of a shape of things to come in the Borough...\\" (page 62) Holland and Smith required the character of Debbie to be bossy, interfering and a definite outsider. They had both worked with the actress Shirley Cheriton on their previous television series about nurses, entitled Angels. Cheriton had proved an extremely popular addition to the cast of Angels and had secured herself a large number of fans. Both Holland and Smith perceived Cheriton to be a \\"rung or two up from her working-class origins\\", but she was not posh either, which was perfect for the part of Debbie. They initially worried that Cheriton would have reservations about playing a person who was not immediately liked by everyone, but Cheriton liked the role so she was instantly hired. The characters of Andy and Debbie were created to represent a young couple with upwardly mobile pretensions, but it was decided that the formula did not work and both characters were eventually written out of the show. Andy ended up being the first main character to be killed off in 1986, just over a year after the show began. During this time, rumours began to circulate in the British press that Ross Davidson (Andy) was axed because Julia Smith disapproved of the off-screen relationship he was having with Shirley Cheriton. This was subsequently denied in EastEnders: The Inside Story. Debbie remained in the show for another year as the writers tried unsuccessfully to reintegrate the character after Andy's departure. Debbie eventually departed after being married off to a policeman played by Gary Whelan, which coincidentally happened to her character Katy in Angels years earlier; marrying a policeman also played by Gary Whelan.

Wright was best known for his virtuoso performances on the huge Wurlitzer theater pipe organs at the famed Fox Theater on Market Street in San Francisco and the ornate Paramount Theaters in both New York City and Oakland. He was in constant demand during the 1940s, 1950s, and early 1960s, playing at concerts and recitals around the world. Early years George Wright learned to play the piano at an early age from his aunt who was a private music teacher. His mother was a movie accompanist on the piano for silent movies played at the Orland Theatre. He grew up in Stockton and Sacramento, where he graduated from Grant Union High School in 1938. One of his first projects was installing a theater organ there, where it still remains and plays. Career In 1938, he had his first playing job at a Chinese night club in Oakland, called the New Shanghai Cafe and Terrace Bowl, which boasted a 2-manual, 6-rank Wurlitzer; the show was broadcast nightly by an Oakland radio station. In 1941, he joined San Francisco radio station KFRC and on the Blue Network by 1942. In December, 1942 he started performing at the San Francisco Fox Theater on Saturday nights. In late 1944, he relocated to New York City to work as organist for NBC radio. He began recording at this time, first cutting 78 RPM records for Syd Nathan's King Records and Regent Records, in addition to securing contracts for transcription disks on the Thesaurus, Associated, and Muzak labels. In New York, he was a guest on the Paul Whiteman\\"Stairway to the Stars\\" radio program (May 21, 1946) and Percy Faith, as well as on the network shows of Bing Crosby and Perry Como. He also conducted his own orchestra on the Robert Q. Lewis show and began a seven-year stint playing in a trio with Charles Magnante, accordionist, and Tony Mottola, guitarist, for Jack Berch's NBC show sponsored by the Prudential Insurance Company. The trio, with added bassist Bobby Haggart, recorded five \\"Soundies,\\" as well. In 1948, he signed on as house organist for the Paramount Theater in New York. There, he played with many of the great jazz and pop artists of the time, including Frank Sinatra, Frankie Laine and Ella Fitzgerald. He moved to Los Angeles in 1951 and in 1963 became ABC's musical director for the West Coast. During his early years at ABC, Wright continued to perform live theater organ concerts. By the late 1950s, Wright developed an avid, if cult-sized, following for his solo organ concerts during this time and was able to fill big variety-era theaters long after their main audiences had shriveled. Wright became renowned among theater organists for his pyrotechnic virtuosity, devising novel effects and pulling off lightning fast stop changes. In 1963, Wright became the studio organist (and eventual musical director) for the soap opera General Hospital. Wright remained with the show even after it switched from live broadcasts to video tape in the 1970s, and as musical cues modernized, he even began composing piano arrangements for GH's underscore. In his next-to-last year with the soap, Wright was asked to compose new theme music for GH, a piano- dominated tune which debuted on the program in April 1975. Over a year later, in July 1976, then-executive producer Tom Donovan chose to replace Wright's music with the style of another director. Wright, his scores, and his GH theme song were history (with the latter being replaced by the piece that will forever be the closest association of GH in history, \\"Autumn Breeze\\" by Jack Urbont). During his long career, George Wright played a key role in reviving interest in theater organ music. He recorded more than 60 albums. Wright was the first act signed to Richard Vaughn's HIFI Records and recorded 20 albums as their featured organist in the late 1950s before switching to Dot Records in 1963. Vaughn claimed that Wright's first seven albums for HIFI Records sold 1,000,000 copies in their first two years of release. \\"Fete Wright on Mil Mark,\\"The Billboard, August 12, 1957, p. 51 On his HIFI albums, Wright is a perfect complement to the label's star, Arthur Lyman. His Dot albums are somewhat less showy, though he continues to work with a considerable range of material, from old standards to Dave Brubeck's \\"It's a Raggy Waltz.\\" In August 1970, however, the studio/warehouse (owned by organ speaker inventory Don Leslie) where he kept his personal pipe organ burned and he stopped recording for over 10 years. Wright bought a house in the Hollywood Hills less for its location than for its capacity to accommodate his own mighty Wurlitzer pipe organ. He worked on it constantly, swapping out pieces he collected in his travels around the U.S. In 1980, his friend Bob Power founded BANDA Records for the purpose of recording Wright, and many of his albums were available from BANDA. In 1995, he was presented with the first Lifetime Achievement Award by the American Theatre Organ Society. He continued to play at concerts and make recordings to the end, and many unreleased tapes have been digitized after the acquisition of BANDA. He finished his last album, Salon, just 60 days before his death. BANDA has released almost nothing since the early 2000s however, but the new owner of BANDA has issued two new offerings, Back to School and an all-piano offering Gin & Tonic. Wright's organ recordings were distributed on the Associated Program Service Transcriptions, Muzak, Thesaurus Transcription Service, Armed Forces Radio Service, RCA Custom (under the pseudonym Jocelyn McNeil), RCA Camden (under the pseudonym Guy Melendy), Malar, King, Regent, Lurite, Doric, Century, Hamilton, Reader's Digest, Essential, BANDA, HiFi, SOLO, and DOT labels. Wright died of heart failure on May 10, 1998, in Los Angeles. His remains were cremated by the Neptune Society and scattered in the organization's Rose Garden.

First quantization is appropriate for studying a single quantum-mechanical system being controlled by a laboratory apparatus that is itself large enough that classical mechanics is applicable to most of the apparatus. One-particle systems In general, the one-particle state could be described by a complete set of quantum numbers denoted by u. For example, the three quantum numbers n,l,m associated to an electron in a coulomb potential, like the hydrogen atom, form a complete set (ignoring spin). Hence, the state is called u\\\\rangle and is an eigenvector of the Hamiltonian operator. One can obtain a state function representation of the state using \\\\psi_ u(\\\\mathbf{r})= \\\\langle \\\\mathbf{r}u\\\\rangle. All eigenvectors of a Hermitian operator form a complete basis, so one can construct any state |\\\\psi\\\\rangle=\\\\sum_ uu\\\\rangle\\\\langle u|\\\\psi\\\\rangle obtaining the completeness relation: \\\\sum_ uu\\\\rangle\\\\langle u|=\\\\mathbf{I} All the properties of the particle could be known using this vector basis. Many- particle systems When turning to N-particle systems, i.e., systems containing N identical particles i.e. particles characterized by the same physical parameters such as mass, charge and spin, an extension of the single- particle state function \\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r}) to the N-particle state function \\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r}_1,\\\\mathbf{r}_2,...,\\\\mathbf{r}_N) is necessary. A fundamental difference between classical and quantum mechanics concerns the concept of indistinguishability of identical particles. Only two species of particles are thus possible in quantum physics, the so-called bosons and fermions which obey the rules: \\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r}_1,...,\\\\mathbf{r}_j,...,\\\\mathbf{r}_k,...,\\\\mathbf{r_N})=+\\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r}_1,...,\\\\mathbf{r}_k,...,\\\\mathbf{r}_j,...,\\\\mathbf{r}_N) (bosons), \\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r}_1,...,\\\\mathbf{r}_j,...,\\\\mathbf{r}_k,...,\\\\mathbf{r_N})=-\\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r}_1,...,\\\\mathbf{r}_k,...,\\\\mathbf{r}_j,...,\\\\mathbf{r}_N) (fermions). Where we have interchanged two coordinates (\\\\mathbf{r}_j, \\\\mathbf{r}_k) of the state function. The usual wave function is obtained using the Slater determinant and the identical particles theory. Using this basis, it is possible to solve any many-particle problem.

In 1854, Gurley accepted a call from the F Street Church in Washington, D. C., which in 1859 was united with the Second Presbyterian Church, to become the New York Avenue Presbyterian Church. Gurley continued to be the pastor of the merged congregation until his death. In 1859 he was chosen Chaplain of the United States Senate; one of fourteen Presbyterians to hold that office, to date. Gurley numbered among his worshiping congregation President Abraham Lincoln and Mary Todd Lincoln. Lincoln was a pew holder and regular attender but not a member of the church. Gurley and his wife were frequent guests at the White House. Gurley was at Lincoln's deathbed and accompanied Mrs. Lincoln when she informed her son, Tad, of Lincoln's death. Gurley later compared the experience of the assassination with a major battle: I \\"felt as though I had been engaged all night in a terrible Battle and had just strength enough to drag myself off the field.\\" He preached his funeral sermon on April 19, 1865 at the White House, lauding Lincoln for his commitment to American ideals: Gurley had a beautiful singing voice (his mother was a professional singer) and was a powerful speaker.New York Avenue Presbyterian Church Historian, Elaine M.

Early life Pope was born on January 13, 1927. His father, Generoso Pope, was a New York political powerbroker and quarry magnate whose Italian-American newspaper interests included the Corriere d'America and the daily Il Progresso Italo-Americano. Generoso Pope Sr. is said to have had ties to New York crime boss Frank Costello, and at the birth of his son asked Costello to be the godfather. Pope was educated at the Horace Mann School. He graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he earned a bachelor's degree in general engineering in 1946. Career Pope took over the daily operations of the Il Progresso Italo-Americano at the age of 21. He worked for the CIA's psychological warfare unit in 1950. Pope acquired the New York Enquirer in 1952 for $75,000. The Enquirer purchase was supposedly made, in part, with a loan from Costello. In 1954, Pope revamped the format from a broadsheet to a tabloid, and renamed it The National Enquirer. Pope worked tirelessly throughout the 1950s and 1960s to increase the circulation of the Enquirer. In the late 50s and through to 1967, it was known for its gory and unsettling headlines and stories such as \\"I Cut Out Her Heart and Stomped On It\\" (Sept. 8, 1963, the true story of the April 1963 mutilation murder of former Olympic Skier Sonja McCaskie) & \\"Mom Boiled Her Baby And Ate Her\\" (1962). At this time the paper was sold on newsstands and drugstores only ‚Äî as the gory headlines would not have been allowed in family supermarkets, etc. Pope stated he got the idea for the format and these gory stories from seeing people congregate around auto accidents. After 1967, Pope tempered the use of gory headlines so the tabloid could be sold in more family-friendly environments such as at supermarket check-out lines, which Henry Dormann paved the way for by visiting with supermarket executives. This new sales strategy proved to be a huge boon for sales; single-copy sales of some issues (e.g. Elvis in his coffin) peaked above six million in the 1970s. Pope moved the Enquirer from New York to Lantana, Florida in 1971. By the time of Pope's death, his GP Group, in addition to The National Enquirer, included Weekly World News and a magazine distributor, Distribution Services Inc. It was sold in 1989 by his heirs to the company that would become American Media. From 1971 to 1988 during the holiday season, Pope put up a large decorated Christmas tree, which towered over the corporate headquarters of the National Enquirer in Lantana and at times was considered the largest such tree in the world. This tradition was discontinued after Pope died in 1988. Personal life Pope married his first wife, Patricia McManus, in 1951. After the birth of their son, Generoso Pope III, she fell into a deep postpartum depression and was ultimately diagnosed as schizophrenic. In 1961, Pope divorced McManus and married Edith Moore, a former model; when McManus heard the news, she committed suicide. Pope and Moore had a daughter, Gina, and divorced in 1965. That same year, he married his third wife, Lois Berrodin, and had two children, Paul (b. 1967) and Lorraine (b. 1972); he also adopted Lois' two daughters, Michele and Maria. Rumors of Mafia connections dogged him his whole life. Pope lived in a self- designed beachfront home in Manalapan, Florida. Death Pope suffered a heart attack at the age of 61 at his Manalapan mansion and died en route to the hospital -- in an ambulance that he had donated to the town. He was interred at Our Lady Queen of Peace Catholic Cemetery in Royal Palm Beach, Florida. His widow Lois remains a well-known South Florida philanthropist, specializing in medical research, humanitarian relief, and the performing arts.

Early life Albee was born on October 8, 1857 in Machias, Maine to Nathaniel Smith Albee and Amanda Higgins Crocker. Career Edward F. Albee in 1908 He toured with P. T. Barnum as a roustabout, then in 1885 he partnered with Benjamin Franklin Keith in operating the Bijou Theatre in Boston, Massachusetts. With the success of their business, it grew into the Keith-Albee theatre circuit of vaudeville theatres. Albee gradually took managerial control of Keith's theatrical circuit. They were the first to introduce moving pictures in the United States. In 1900, Pat Shea of Buffalo proposed to Keith and Albee that they should set up a shared booking arrangement for vaudeville similar to the Theatrical Syndicate. They called a meeting in May 1900 in Boston of most of the major vaudeville managers, including Weber & Fields, Tony Pastor, Hyde & Behman of Brooklyn, Kohl & Castle, Colonel J.D. Hopkins, and Meyerfield & Beck of the Orpheum Circuit of the western United States. They did not invite Frederick Freeman Proctor, Keith's main competitor, but the other managers objected to this and insisted on a meeting in New York where Proctor was invited. The Vaudeville Managers Association (VMA) was founded at the New York meeting. Keith and Albee dominated the new organization. Albee was president of the VMA's United Bookings Office from its formation in 1906. Albee had most of the major vaudeville circuits give him control of their theatrical bookings where he charged acts a 5% commission. When performers tried to form a union, he set up National Vaudeville Artists and made membership in it a requirement for booking through his company. His partner Keith died in Palm Beach, Florida in 1914. He formed the Keith-Albee-Orpheum corporation on January 28, 1928 with Joseph P. Kennedy. Radio Corporation of America bought his company and formed RKO Pictures (\\"Radio-Keith-Orpheum\\") and turned the Orpheum vaudeville circuit into a chain of movie theaters. Anecdotes Many entertainers considered Albee's tactics tyrannical. Groucho Marx referred to the United Bookings Office as \\"Albee's Gestapo\\". Joe Frisco summed up the impression of power Albee made; exiting Albee's office into a street under construction, his agent wondered why the street was being torn up and Frisco quipped, \\"Albee's kid lost his ball.\\" Albee appears as a minor character in the film Yankee Doodle Dandy and in the 1968 Broadway musical, George M!.

United States Geological Survey, 1921. Image courtesy of the National Museum of American History from Powering a Generation of Change  * Graphs by hour of California's total electric load, the total load less solar and wind power (known as the duck curve) and solar power output. Data is for October 22, 2016, a day when the wind power output was low and steady throughout the day. In electrical engineering, a load profile is a graph of the variation in the electrical load versus time. A load profile will vary according to customer type (typical examples include residential, commercial and industrial), temperature and holiday seasons. Power producers use this information to plan how much electricity they will need to make available at any given time. Teletraffic engineering uses a similar load curve.  Power generation  In a power system, a load curve or load profile is a chart illustrating the variation in demand/electrical load over a specific time. Generation companies use this information to plan how much power they will need to generate at any given time. A load duration curve is similar to a load curve. The information is the same but is presented in a different form. These curves are useful in the selection of generator units for supplying electricity. Electricity distribution In an electricity distribution grid, the load profile of electricity usage is important to the efficiency and reliability of power transmission. The power transformer or battery-to-grid are critical aspects of power distribution and sizing and modelling of batteries or transformers depends on the load profile. The factory specification of transformers for the optimization of load losses versus no- load losses is dependent directly on the characteristics of the load profile that the transformer is expected to be subjected to. This includes such characteristics as average load factor, diversity factor, utilization factor, and demand factor, which can all be calculated based on a given load profile. On the power market so-called EFA blocks are used to specify the traded forward contract on the delivery of a certain amount of electrical energy at a certain time. Retail energy markets In retail energy markets, supplier obligations are settled on an hourly or subhourly basis. For most customers, consumption is measured on a monthly basis, based on meter reading schedules. Load profiles are used to convert the monthly consumption data into estimates of hourly or subhourly consumption in order to determine the supplier obligation. For each hour, these estimates are aggregated for all customers of an energy supplier, and the aggregate amount is used in market settlement calculations as the total demand that must be covered by the supplier.  Calculating and recording load profiles  Load profiles can be determined by direct metering but on smaller devices such as distribution network transformers this is not routinely done. Instead a load profile can be inferred from customer billing or other data. An example of a practical calculation used by utilities is using a transformer's maximum demand reading and taking into account the known number of each customer type supplied by these transformers. This process is called load research. Actual demand can be collected at strategic locations to perform more detailed load analysis; this is beneficial to both distribution and end-user customers looking for peak consumption. Smart grid meters, utility meter load profilers, data logging sub-meters and portable data loggers are designed to accomplish this task by recording readings at a set interval.

In 2012, to coincide with the release of the remake Sniper Elite V2, it was re-issued through Steam by Rebellion itself. The main character of Sniper Elite is Karl Fairburne, a German-born American OSS secret agent disguised as a German sniper. He is inserted into the Battle of Berlin in 1945, during the final days of World War II, with the critical objective of obtaining German nuclear technology before the Soviet Union.  Gameplay  Sniper Elite is a third-person shooter that involves stealth and first-person shooter game elements. To reinforce the stealth aspect, there is a camouflage index measured in percentage that displays the visibility of the player character Fairburne. Fairburne uses several World War II-era weapons, including sniper rifles, a silenced pistol, submachine guns, light machine guns, an anti-tank weapon, and hand grenades that can be also used to set up tripwire booby traps. One of the main features of the game is the option of realistic ballistics, involving factors such as bullet drop, wind strength, and breathing when attempting a shot. Sniping gameplay is performed in first person scope view, whereas movement and use of all other weapons is in third person view. When the player successfully takes a particularly well-placed sniper shot (such as a head shot or a shot on a moving target), the view follows the path of the bullet in slow motion, while the camera rotates around the bullet. Features include an ability to wound an enemy so that their comrades expose their position by coming to their rescue, detonating grenades and fuel tanks with well-aimed rifle fire, and timing shots so that loud noises such as thunder or artillery blasts mask the sound.  Plot  The game follows protagonist Karl Fairburne as he attempts to prevent the Soviet Union taking control of Germany's nuclear secrets in and around Berlin in April 1945. Very little information is known about his background, other than he was raised in Berlin before the war broke out, that he studied at West Point shortly after America's entrance into the war, and the fact that he was chosen for this mission because the city was his childhood home. There are several factions active in the city, including the German resistance, who wish to aid Karl, the Soviet NKVD, and the Nazi forces. The historical Nazi official Martin Bormann, an extremely powerful figure within the Third Reich, is one of Karl's targets for assassination as he plans to meet up with an NKVD contact at the Brandenburg Gate to defect to the Soviet Union. The rest of the characters (such as Dr. Max Lohmann, a key German scientist who Fairburne is assigned to help capture and escort out of Berlin to America in order to prevent him from falling into the hands of the NKVD) are fictional with the exception of General Patton who has sent Fairburne on his mission.  Wii version  The Wii version of the game was released by Reef Entertainment in North America in September 2010. It is compatible with the Wii Remote and Wii Zapper and contains a bonus new level. The game was also released in Europe later the same year.  Reception  Sniper Elite was awarded \\"Best PC/Console Game\\" in the TIGA Awards of 2005. As of 2010, the game holds GameRankings scores of 73% for the PC version, 77% for the PlayStation 2, and 77% for the Xbox.  Novel  Rebellion Developments' book imprint Abaddon Books released a novel inspired by the game, Sniper Elite: The Spear of Destiny written by Jasper Bark.Jasper Bark, Abaddon Books, August 2006, In this book, Karl Fairburne's mission is to stop Nazi SS general Helmstadt from selling a working atomic bomb to the Soviets.

It is located near Arkhangelsk, on an island in the Northern Dvina river, 9 kilometres from the sea at Dvina Bay. Operation Paravane The airfield was used by the Royal Air Force as a temporary base in September 1944 to launch Operation Paravane, a bombing raid against the German battleship Tirpitz in K√•fjord in northern Norway. Thirty-eight Avro Lancasters of 617 and 9 Squadrons, two Liberator transports and a weather reconnaissance Mosquito set off for Yagodnik on the night of 10 September 1944. Once there, poor visibility prevented many aircraft from finding Yagodnik airfield. Now short of fuel, some aircraft emergency landed at a small airfield on Kergostrov Island where several of the bombers crash-landed: other aircraft were scattered across the region. On 15 September, after repairs, 27 Avro Lancasters flew with Barnes Wallis' 5-tonne Tallboy bombs and experimental 500-pound \\"Johnny Walker\\" underwater \\"walking\\" mines. The raid caused sufficient damage to result in the Tirpitz being moved south to Troms√∏ for repairs and into range for subsequent British based raids.

When Q and Not U disbanded in 2005 after releasing three albums, the band split into three different projects: Ris Paul Ric, a folk/electronic solo effort from Chris Richards; Harris Klahr commenced work on his new project, President; and finally, Georgie James, featuring Q And Not U's drummer Davis. Having met through the D.C. music scene, vocalist/multi-instrumentalist Davis and vocalist/pianist Burhenn (who had released two solo albums on her own Laboratory Records prior to this project) discovered that they had similar tastes in classic pop music from the 1950s to the 1970s. They decided to start working together as a band, Davis writing the guitars, bass and drums, Burhenn on the Rhodes electric piano. A few hours later they had written a few songs, and decided it was a worthy project to pursue. Later in 2005, the duo recorded demos at Silver Sonya Studio in Arlington, VA. with producers Chad Clark and TJ Lipple and also at their practice space in NE D.C. By November 2005, they produced a 7-song demo, showcasing a mix of cool pop production, dancey riffs reminiscent of Power-era Q and Not U and unexplored territory for the both of them. The resulting demo was entitled Demos at Dance Place (named after the arts center adjacent to their practice space) and was self-released in 2006. In February 2007, they released their first single, \\"Need Your Needs,\\" on Burhenn's label, Laboratory Records. That spring, Georgie James signed a record contract with indie label Saddle Creek Records. They toured North America and Europe extensively to promote their debut full length, 'Places,' which was released in September 2007. The final touring version of the band included Davis on guitar/vocals, Burhenn on keyboard/vocals, Michael Cotterman (formerly of The Loved Ones and Kid Dynamite) on bass and Andrew Black (formerly of The Explosion) on drums. Other musicians that played in the live version of the band included Cale Parks, James Canty, Adam Robinson and Paul Michel. It was announced on August 4, 2008 that the duo had broken up with hopes of focusing more on respective solo projects. Davis formed a solo project called Title Tracks. The debut Title Tracks album, It Was Easy, was released by The Ernest Jenning Record Co. in February 2010. Burhenn formed a solo project called The Mynabirds. The debut Mynabirds album, What We Lose In The Fire We Gain In The Flood, was released by Saddle Creek in April 2010.

The film was released by Universal Pictures on October 27, 1989, and grossed $16.6 million. Plot A news report shows a victim being pulled away on a stretcher. It is revealed that a serial killer, having murdered over thirty people, is on the loose in a Los Angeles suburb. A television repairman with a pronounced limp, named Horace Pinker, becomes the prime suspect. When the investigating detective, Lt. Don Parker, gets too close, Pinker murders Parker's wife, foster daughter, and foster son. However, his other foster son, a college football star named Jonathan, develops a strange connection to Pinker through his dreams and leads Parker to Pinker's run-down shop. In a shootout in which several officers are killed, Pinker escapes and targets Jonathan's girlfriend Alison in retribution. Another dream leads Lt. Parker and the police to Pinker, whom they catch in the act of a kidnapping. This time, just as Pinker is about to kill Jonathan, he is arrested. Pinker is quickly convicted and sentenced to die in the electric chair. Prior to his execution, Pinker reveals that Jonathan is, in fact, his son, and that as a boy, Jonathan had shot him in the knee while trying to stop the murder of his mother. But what they do not realize is that Pinker has made a deal with the Devil. When executed, he does not die but instead becomes pure electricity. He is able to possess others to continue his murderous ways. Some of the people who are killed are prison staff and Jonathan's friends. He soon possesses Lt. Parker, who uses his strength to fight off Pinker, and Pinker escapes into a TV dish. Jonathan and his friends try to find a way to fight him. Jonathan's friends, including Rhino, head to the power station to disable the power. Jonathan, with the aid of Alison's \\"spirit\\", devises a scheme to bring Pinker back into the real world and accidentally discovers that Pinker, as with all energy sources, is bound by the laws of the real world; Jonathan uses this limitation to defeat Pinker, and traps him inside a television. Pinker threatens Jonathan that he will find a way out of his \\"prison\\". Alison's voice tells Jonathan to take care of himself, while Jonathan's neighborhood suffers a blackout, caused by his friends blowing out the power main, trapping Pinker in the television. Jonathan goes outside amid all his neighbors and looks up at the sky, agreeing with Alison that they are beautiful. Cast * Michael Murphy as Lt. Don Parker * Peter Berg as Jonathan Parker * Mitch Pileggi as Horace Pinker * Camille Cooper as Alison Clemens * Sam Scarber as Sidney Cooper * Richard Brooks as Rhino * Ted Raimi as Pac Man * Heather Langenkamp as Victim: Langenkamp previously portrayed the heroine Nancy Thompson in Craven's landmark films, A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) and A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (1987). In this film, she portrays Horace Pinker's first victim. * Wes Craven as Man Neighbor * Jessica Craven as Counterperson: Jessica is the daughter of Craven. * Jonathan Craven as Jogger: Jonathon is the son of Craven and worked as the film's visual effects coordinator. * Dr. Timothy Leary as the television evangelist * John Tesh as the TV newscaster * Michael Matthews as Evil Mouth * Kane Roberts as Road Worker: The guitarist from Alice Cooper's band. * Eugene Chadbourne as Man in Bar * Vincent Guasteferro as Pastori Release Rating According to Craven, the film was severely cut for an \\"R\\" rating. It took around thirteen submissions to the Motion Picture Association of America to receive an \\"R\\" instead of an \\"X\\". Some scenes that were cut included Pinker spitting out fingers that he bit off of a prison guard, a longer and more graphic electrocution of Pinker, and a longer scene of a possessed coach stabbing his own hand. Despite fan interest, an uncut version has never been released. Box office Shocker was released on October 27, 1989 in 1,783 venues. It earned $4,510,990 in its opening weekend, ranking second behind the third weekend of Look Who's Talking. The film ultimately grossed $16.6 million in the United States. Critical response The film received a split vote from Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert on their weekly television show, with Siskel giving it \\"a marginal thumbs up\\" but Ebert voting \\"thumbs down\\" and explaining \\"I felt it would have been a better movie if it had played with more rules.\\"Siskel & Ebert. Buena Vista Television. November 4, 1989. Stephen Holden of The New York Times wrote, \\"If the movie's metaphors are as obvious and as portentous as the heavy metal music that punctuates the action, 'Shocker' at least has the feel of a movie that was fun to make. Just when you think that every trick has been thrown in but the kitchen sink, it goes in too, along with stove and the refrigerator.\\"Holden, Stephen (October 28, 1989). \\"A Mix of Gore and Freud\\". The New York Times. 16. Variety wrote, \\"At first glance (or at least for the first 40 minutes) 'Shocker' seems a potential winner, an almost unbearably suspenseful, stylish and blood-drenched ride courtesy of writer-director Craven's flair for action and sick humor. As it continues, however, the camp aspects simply give way to the ridiculous while failing to establish any rules to govern the mayhem. The result is plenty of unintentional laughs that undermine the few legitimate chuckles and most of the remaining action.\\"\\"Film Reviews: Shocker\\". Variety. November 1, 1989. 34. Michael Wilmington of the Los Angeles Times stated that the film \\"is crammed with dazzling bursts of macabre technique\\" but \\"is so diffusely organized it's almost three separate movies.\\"Wilmington, Michael (October 27, 1989). \\"A TV Freak You Can't Escape in 'Shocker'\\". Los Angeles Times. F6. Johanna Steinmetz of the Chicago Tribune gave the film one-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, \\"A gory thrill show for underdeveloped sensibilities, it is sloppily organized and jarringly paced. Its single conceit, that a barrage of television programs has weakened both our values and our grasp of realities, while an excuse for a climax of ingenious special effects, can't sustain an entire movie.\\"Steinmetz, Johanna (October 31, 1989). \\"'Shocker' slogs through babble on the way to a smart finale\\". Chicago Tribune. Section 5, p. 5. Richard Harrington of The Washington Post said, \\"For the longest time, 'Shocker' is low voltage, just another gathering of slasher cliches. Toward the end, though, it comes to life thanks to an extended special effects package that is only hinted at earlier.\\"Harrington, Richard (November 2, 1989). \\"Electrified Revenge\\". The Washington Post. B15. Kim Newman wrote in The Monthly Film Bulletin that \\"all the characters, especially the dumb-hunk hero and his dead but chatty girlfriend, are cardboard, and none of the connective tissue makes any sense. Asked to turn out 'another Nightmare on Elm Street, Craven has sadly resorted to facile self-imitation rather than coming up with something as fiercely original as his biggest hit movie.\\" In Wes Craven: The Art of Horror, John Kenneth Muir described Shocker as \\"Craven's response to the Freddy Krueger film series\\" for Universal. Muir describes several similarities between the series, though he says Shocker is more comedic. Of the film's conclusion, Muir wrote, Shocker's final 20 minutes are a stylistic special effects tour de force and well worth the price of admission.\\" As of July 2019, the film holds a 24% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 21 reviews. Metacritic scored Shocker 51 out of 100, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Home media The film was released on DVD by Universal Studios in 1999. It was subsequently re-released by the studio in 2007 as a double feature, alongside Craven's The People Under the Stairs. The film's first Blu-ray edition was released by Shout! Factory on September 8, 2015.  Literature  Shocker received a novelization. Music Original musical contributions included songs by Alice Cooper (who would later play Freddy Krueger's abusive foster father, Mr. Underwood, in Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare) and Megadeth, who covered Alice Cooper's 1973 hit \\"No More Mr. Nice Guy\\", among others. The movie's title song was written by Jean Beauvoir and Desmond Child and recorded by The Dudes of Wrath, a supergroup composed of Paul Stanley of Kiss and Desmond Child, both on vocals, Vivian Campbell and Guy Mann-Dude on guitars, Whitesnake's Rudy Sarzo on bass guitar, and M√∂tley Cr√ºe's Tommy Lee on drums. The band also included backing vocals by Van Halen bassist Michael Anthony and Kane Roberts. The soundtrack was released on Capitol/SBK Records in 1989.

Telerehabilitation (or e-rehabilitation is the delivery of rehabilitation services over telecommunication networks and the internet. Telerehabilitation allows patients to interact with providers remotely and can be used both to assess patients and to deliver therapy. Fields of medicine that utilize telerehabilitation include: physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology, audiology, and psychology. Therapy sessions can be individual or community-based. Types of therapy available include motor training exercises, speech therapy, virtual reality, robotic therapy, goal setting, and group exercise. Commonly used modalities include webcams, videoconferencing, phone lines, videophones and webpages containing rich Internet applications. The visual nature of telerehabilitation technology limits the types of rehabilitation services that can be provided. Telerehabilitation is therefore often combined with other modalities such as in-person therapy. Important areas of telerehabilitation research include the investigation of new and emerging rehabilitation modalities as well as comparisons between telerehabilitation and in-person therapy in terms of patient functional outcomes, cost, patient satisfaction, and compliance. As of 2006, only a few health insurers in the United States will reimburse for telerehabilitation services. If the research shows that tele-assessments and tele-therapy are equivalent to clinical encounters, it is more likely that insurers and Medicare will cover telerehabilitation services. History In 1999, D.M. Angaran published \\"Telemedicine and Telepharmacy: Current Status and Future Implications\\" in the American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy. He provided a comprehensive history of telecommunications, the internet and telemedicine since the 1950s. The Department of Defense (DoD) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) spearheaded the technology in the United States during the Vietnam War and the space program; both agencies continue to fund advances in telemedicine. Three early adopters of telemedicine were state penitentiary systems, rural health care systems, and the radiology profession. Telemedicine makes business sense for the states because they do not have to pay for security escorts to have a prisoner receive care outside the prison. Rural telemedicine in the United States is heavily subsidized through federal agency grants for telecommunications operations. Most of this funding comes through the Health Services Research Administration and the Department of Commerce. Some state universities have obtained state funding to operate tele-clinics in rural areas. As of 2006, few (if any) of these programs are known to financially break-even, mostly because the Medicare program for people over age 65 (the largest payer) is very restrictive about paying for telehealth. In contrast, the Veterans Administration is relatively active in using telemedicine for people with disabilities. There are several programs that provide annual physical exams or monitoring and consultation for veterans with spinal cord injuries. Similarly, some state Medicaid programs (for poor people and people with disabilities) have pilot programs using telecommunications to connect rural practitioners with subspecialty therapists. A few school districts in Oklahoma and Hawaii offer school-based rehabilitation therapy using therapy assistants who are directed by a remote therapist. The National Rehabilitation Hospital in Washington DC and Sister Kenny Rehabilitation Institute in Minneapolis provided assessment and evaluations to patients living in Guam and American Samoa. Cases included post-stroke, post-polio, autism, and wheel-chair fitting. An argument can be made that \\"telerehabilitation\\" began in 1998 when NIDRR funded the first RERC on tele-rehabilitation. It was awarded to a consortium of biomedical engineering departments at the National Rehabilitation Hospital and The Catholic University of America, both located in Washington, DC; the Sister Kenny Rehabilitation Institute in Minnesota; and the East Carolina University in North Carolina. Some of this early research work, and its motivation, is reviewed in Winters (2002). The State of Science Conference held in 2002 convened most of military and civilian clinicians, engineers, and government officials interested in using telecommunications as a modality for rehabilitation assessment and therapy; a summary is provided in Rosen, Winters & Lauderdale (2002). The conference was attended by the incoming president of the American Telemedicine Association (ATA). This led to an invitation by ATA to the conference attendees to form a special interest group on telerehabilitation. NIDRR funded the second 5-year RERC on telerehabilitation in 2004, awarding it to the University of Pittsburgh. This RERC was renewed in 2010. In 2001, O. Bracy, a neuropsychologist, introduced the first web based, rich internet application, for the telerehabilitation presentation of cognitive rehabilitation therapy. This system first provides the subscriber clinician with an economical means of treating their own patients over the internet. Secondly, the system then provides, directly to the patient, the therapy prescription set up and controlled by the member clinician. All applications and response data are transported via the internet in real time. The patient can login to do their therapy from home, the library or anywhere they have access to an internet computer. In 2006, this system formed the basis of a new system designed as a cognitive skills enhancement program for school children. Individual children or whole classrooms can participate in this program over the internet. In 2006, M.J. McCue and S.E. Palsbo published an article in the Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare that explored how telemedicine can become a profitable business for hospitals. They argue that telerehabilitation should be expanded so that people with disabilities and people in pain (perhaps after hip-replacement surgery or people with arthritis) can get the rehabilitative therapy they need. It is unethical to limit payments for telerehabilitation services only to patients in rural areas. Research in telerehabilitation is in its infancy, with only a handful of equivalence trials. As of 2006, most peer-reviewed research in telemedicine are case reports of pilot programs or new equipment. Rehabilitation researchers need to conduct many more controlled experiments and present the evidence to clinicians (and payers) that telerehabilitation is clinically effective. The discipline of speech-language pathology is far head of occupational therapy and physical therapy in demonstrating equivalence over various types of telecommunications equipment.  Technologies  # Plain old telephone service (POTS) with videophones/phones in telerehabilitation #: There are several types of connections used with real time exchanges. Plain old telephone service (POTS) uses standard analog telephone lines. Videophones are used with POTS lines and include a camera, display screen, and telephone. Videophones use telephone lines that are available in most homes, so are easy to set up; however small display screens make them problematic for individuals with vision problems. This can be solved by using a large screen or television as a screen. # Videotelephony/Videotelephony in telerehabilitation #:The use of improved quality video-assisted telecommunication devices, such as videoconferencing, webcams and telepresence to assist in treatments. # Virtual reality/Virtual reality in telerehabilitation #: Virtual reality in telerehabilitation is one of the newest tools available in that area. This computer technology allows the development of three-dimensional virtual environments. # Motion technology/Motion technology in telerehabilitation # Web-based approaches/Web-based approaches in telerehabilitation #: Applications that run over the internet, just as if they were installed in your computer (called Rich Internet Applications), represent a new direction in software development. A person subscribes to the website rather than purchase the software. Any updates or changes to the software system are instantly available to all subscribers. The applications can be accessed from any location where one has access to an internet connected computer. Likewise, a patient's data is accessible from where ever the therapist is located. Neither the application nor the patient's data is tied to one computer. # Sensors and body monitoring/Sensors and body monitoring in telerehabilitation # Haptic technology/Haptic technology in telerehabilitation # Artificial intelligence/Artificial intelligence in telerehabilitation # Wireless technology/Wireless technology in telerehabilitation # PDAs/PDA in telerehabilitation # Mobile telephony/Mobile telephony in telerehabilitation # Electronic medical records/Electronic medical record telerehabilitation # Mobile apps/Mobile apps telerehabilitation Clinical applications Speech-language pathology The clinical services provided by speech- language pathology readily lend themselves to telerehabilitation applications due to the emphasis on auditory and visual communicative interaction between the client and the clinician. As a result, the number of telerehabilitation applications in speech-language pathology tend to outnumber those in other allied health professions. To date, applications have been developed to assess and/or treat acquired adult speech and language disorders, stuttering, voice disorders, speech disorders in children, and swallowing dysfunction. The technology involved in these applications has ranged from the simple telephone (Plain Old Telephone System ‚Äì POTS) to the use of dedicated Internet-based videoconferencing systems. Early applications to assess and treat acquired adult speech and language disorders involved the use of the telephone to treat patients with aphasia and motor speech disorders (Vaughan, 1976, Wertz, et al., 1987), a computer controlled video laserdisc over the telephone and a closed-circuit television system to assess speech and language disorders (Wertz et al., 1987), and a satellite-based videoconferencing system to assess patients in rural areas (Duffy, Werven & Aronson, 1997). More recent applications have involved the use of sophisticated Internet-based videoconferencing systems with dedicated software which enable the assessment of language disorders (Georgeadis, Brennan, Barker, & Baron, 2004, Brennan, Georgeadis, Baron & Barker, 2004), the treatment of language disorders and the assessment and treatment of motor speech disorders (Hill, Theodoros, Russell, Cahill, Ward, Clark, 2006; Theodoros, Constantinescu, Russell, Ward, Wilson & Wootton, in press) following brain impairment and Parkinson's disease. Collectively, these studies have revealed positive treatment outcomes, while assessment and diagnoses have been found to be comparable to face-to-face evaluations. The treatment of stuttering has been adapted to a telerehabilitation environment with notable success. Two Australian studies (Harrison, Wilson & Onslow, 1999; Wilson, Onslow & Lincoln, 2004) involving the distance delivery of the Lidcombe program to children who stutter have utilized the telephone in conjunction with offline video recordings to successfully treat several children. Overall, the parents and children responded positively to the program delivered at a distant. Using a high speed videoconferencing system link, Sicotte, Lehoux, Fortier-Blanc and Leblanc (2003) assessed and treated six children and adolescents with a positive reduction in the frequency of dysfluency that was maintained six months later. In addition, a videoconferencing platform has been used successfully to provide follow-up treatment to an adult who had previously received intensive therapy (Kully, 200). Reports of telerehabilitation applications in paediatric speech and language disorders are sparse. A recent Australian pilot study has investigated the feasibility of an Internet-based assessment of speech disorder in six children (Waite, Cahill, Theodoros, Russell, Busuttin, in press). High levels of agreement between the online and face-to-face clinicians for single-word articulation, speech intelligibility, and oro-motor tasks were obtained suggesting that the Internet-based protocol had the potential to be a reliable method for assessing paediatric speech disorders. Voice therapy across a variety of types of voice disorders has been shown to be effectively delivered via a telerehabilitation application. Mashima et al. (2003) using PC based videoconferencing and speech analysis software compared 23 patients treated online with 28 persons treated face-to-face. The authors reported positive post treatment results with no significant difference in measures between the traditional and videoconferencing group, suggesting that the majority of traditional voice therapy techniques can be applied to distance treatment. Although obvious limitations exist, telerehabilitation applications for the assessment of swallowing function have also been used with success. Lalor, Brown and Cranfield (2000) were able to obtain an initial assessment of the nature and extent of swallowing dysfunction in an adult via a videoconferencing link although a more complete evaluation was restricted due to the inability to physically determine the degree of laryngeal movement. A more sophisticated telerehabilitation application for the assessment of swallowing was developed by Perlman and Witthawaskul (2002) who described the use of real-time videofluoroscopic examination via the Internet. This system enabled the capture and display of images in real-time with only a three to five second delay.There has been considerable research into the assessment and treatment of dysphagia via telerehabilitation, including cost analyses, leading to the establishment of sustainable telerehabilitation services. There continues to be a need for ongoing research to develop and validate the use of telerehabilitation applications in speech-language pathology in a greater number and variety of adult and paediatric communication and swallowing disorders. Physical and occupational therapy Types of physical and occupational therapy delivered through telerehabilitation include motor training exercises, goal setting, virtual reality, robotic therapy, and community-therapy. Motor training exercises are the most commonly implemented modality. In motor training exercises, a provider guides a patient through performing different motions and activities in order to regain strength and function. Motor training through telerehabilitation has consistently been shown to produce equivalent functional outcomes compared with in-person therapy. However, many patients require in-person therapy initially before transitioning to telerehabilitation. Goal setting has been used in remote areas where cost and provider availability prohibit access to physical therapy. Patients work with a therapist to set personal goals and track their progress through sessions. Goal setting telerehabilitation has been shown to produce increased patient satisfaction and improvement in activities of daily living compared with a control group receiving no therapy. Virtual reality therapy involves the use of a sensor to detect movement and a virtual environment displayed on either a screen or headset. Patients perform therapeutic movements that correspond to tasks within the virtual environment. This provides an immersive environment for the patient and allows computerized monitoring of patient progress. Studies that compared virtual reality with motor training exercises have shown equal or better outcomes with virtual reality. Robotic therapy typically involves the use of hand and foot strengthening robots which provide resistance training and assist the patient with performing movements. Robotic devices can also obtain precise data on patient movements and usage statistics and transmit them to providers for evaluation. Robotic therapy has even been combined with virtual reality telerehabilitation to create a virtual environment which responds to robotic movements. Robotic telerehabilitation studies have shown patient improvement from baseline but equivalent functional outcomes compared with motor training exercises. Community therapy is used to deliver education and therapy to patients remotely, either through group exercise sessions or through kiosks. Community therapy tends to have lower patient compliance than individualized therapy, but can deliver similar results if appropriately utilized.

The Stratstone brand was acquired in 1992, establishing a relationship for Pendragon with Jaguar and Land Rover. In August 1997, an acquisition of Lex Service PLC and their seventeen volume car dealerships took place. In August 1998, Pinewood computers was acquired by Pendragon, expanding the company's portfolio into the specialist areas of dealer management systems, telecommunications and remote security monitoring systems for the retail motor industry. Pendragon went on to acquire the whole shared capital of Evans Halshaw in February 1999. After this, a further thirty two franchised dealerships were bought from Lex Service PLC in March 2000. In July 2000, Pendragon expanded into America, with their acquisition of Bauer Jaguar, the third largest Jaguar dealership in America. Throughout the remainder of 2000 to 2001, various other dealerships based in California were acquired, including Hornburg in April 2001, which held the Jaguar and Land Rover dealership in Los Angeles.

Logan was a WAMPAS Baby Star of 1922. Early life Logan was born in Corsicana, Texas, on November 30, 1904. Some sources give her birthdate as November 30, 1902, or November 30, 1901. Her father, Charles A. Logan, was an architect and her mother, Marian Logan, was briefly an opera singer and later gave vocal lessons. Her childhood was spent in Scottsbluff, Nebraska where she briefly worked as a journalist for the Scottsbluff Republican. Stage career and Broadway Logan traveled to Colorado Springs, Colorado, for her health and acted in stock theater there. While there she took a course in journalism from Ford Frick, who later became commissioner of Major League Baseball. Setting out to Chicago, Logan found employment dancing in a stage production of a theater. Her family believed she intended to visit an uncle in the windy city and also attend college. To get the job she lied about her age, and when her uncle found out, he was irate. She was let go from the stage job as a result. She left Chicago and set out for New York City. Again Logan was untruthful regarding her intentions. With her on her trip to New York was a theatrical troupe. She secured a small role in Florodora, a musical on Broadway in 1920. At this time, Flo Ziegfeld noticed her and hired her for a job dancing on his Ziegfeld Roof. She replaced Billie Donovan who was leaving to act in films in Hollywood. Together with the Ziegfeld venture, Logan modeled as a Dobbs Girl in Alfred Cheney Johnston photographs. She also had a part in a Johnny Hines' comedy short. Her other Broadway credits included Two Strange Women (1933) and Merrily We Roll Along (1934). Motion pictures Logan was awarded a screen test with the then unknown actor Ben Lyon. Lyon was the husband of Hollywood actress Bebe Daniels and became a prominent figure in the movies. Later he furthered the careers of such stars as Marilyn Monroe. Working for Associated Producers, Logan was featured opposite Jane Peters, the future Carole Lombard in the film The Perfect Crime (1921). Peters was only a youth, appearing as a pretty blonde child actress. The same year she played with Mabel Normand in Molly O' (1921). Publicity photo of Logan from The Blue Book of the Screen by Ruth Wing (1923) Other features she starred in during the early 1920s include Burning Sands (1922), A Blind Bargain (1922), Sixty Cents an Hour (1923), Java Head (1923), and A Man Must Live (1924). Among her co-stars were Thomas Meighan, Milton Sills, Ricardo Cortez, Leatrice Joy, Richard Dix, Lon Chaney Sr., and William Powell. The House of Youth (1924) is described as her \\"first starring vehicle.\\" In 1926, Logan made Footloose Widows with Louise Fazenda and Blood Ship in 1927 with Richard Arlen. Other prominent leading men whom the actress worked with were Lionel Barrymore, John Barrymore, and Antonio Moreno. The King of Kings Logan was selected by Cecil B. De Mille for the role of Mary Magdalene in the classic The King of Kings (1927). The part was much sought after by actresses of the era. The movie broke records for audience attendance. It was shown somewhere in the world each day for decades after its release. When talking pictures began, Logan's voice was recorded to accompany her acting part in the original silent film. The actress of silent films was largely unsuccessful in the new medium of talkies. In an early musical, Show of Shows (1929), Logan was a member of an all-star cast. This followed her work in some early and profitable sound films for Columbia Pictures. Writer and director of films Logan was in England for a time to do stage work such as Smoky Cell. This gained for her some good reviews. After completing the English film Middle Watch, she was awarded a Command Performance. British International Pictures signed her to write and direct. She wrote Knock-Out (1931) and wrote and directed Strictly Business (1931). Both were successful movies. The new writer/director found herself less in demand behind the camera when she returned to Hollywood. Columbia Pictures production chief Harry Cohn was complimentary of her work but unwilling to sign a female director. Logan retired from films entirely after her marriage in 1934. Just prior to this she was part of several Broadway plays like Merrily We Roll Along and Two Strange Women. Later years Jacqueline Logan was married three times. Her first marriage was to Ralph James Gillespie, also referred to as Robert Gillespie, in 1925. Logan filed for divorce in 1927, claiming that Gillespie kicked her and called her dumb. Five months later, Logan eloped to Tijuana with Los Angeles broker Larry Winston. Upon learning she could face a bigamy charge if she returned to the United States, the couple lived separately until the interlocutory decree expired. Logan's divorce from Gillespie became final in March 1928, and she married Winston in June of that year. After divorcing Winston in 1947, Logan resided in Westchester County, New York into the late 1960s. She spent her winters in Florida where she visited friends such as Lila Lee and Dorothy Dalton, both former actresses. The remainder of the year she resided in Bedford Hills, New York with her prize Great Dane from the Lina Basquette Kennels. Death Logan, at age 78, died in Melbourne, Florida in 1983. Her gravesite is in Greenwood Cemetery in Decatur, Illinois.

Carlo simulation of the coupled transport of electrons and photons in an arbitrary geometry for particles with energies from a few keV up to several hundreds of GeV. It originated at SLAC but National Research Council of Canada and KEK have been involved in its development since the early 80s. Development of the original EGS code ended with version EGS4. Since then two groups have re-written the code with new physics: * EGSnrc, maintained by the Ionizing Radiation Standards Group, Measurement Science and Standards, National Research Council of Canada * EGS5, maintained by KEK, the Japanese particle physics research facility. EGSnrc EGSnrc is a general-purpose software toolkit that can be applied to build Monte Carlo simulations of coupled electron-photon transport, for particle energies ranging from 1 keV to 10 GeV. It is widely used internationally in a variety of radiation-related fields. The EGSnrc implementation improves the accuracy and precision of the charged particle transport mechanics and the atomic scattering cross-section data. The charged particle multiple scattering algorithm allows for large step sizes without sacrificing accuracy - a key feature of the toolkit that leads to fast simulation speeds. EGSnrc also includes a C++ class library called egs++ that can be used to model elaborate geometries and particle sources. EGSnrc is open source and distributed on GitHub under the GNU Affero General Public License. Download EGSnrc for free, submit bug reports, and contribute pull requests on a group Github page. The documentation for EGSnrc is also available online. EGSnrc is distributed with a wide range of applications that utilize the radiation transport physics to calculate specific quantities. These codes have been developed by numerous authors over the lifetime of EGSnrc to support the large user community. It is possible to calculate quantities such as absorbed dose, kerma, particle fluence, and much more, with complex geometrical conditions. One of the most well-known EGSnrc applications is BEAMnrc, which was developed as part of the OMEGA project. This was a collaboration between the National Research Council of Canada and a research group at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. All types of medical linear accelerators can be modelled using the BEAMnrc's component module system.

It is the capital of Radziej√≥w County. Its population is 5,804 (2004). History Gothic Church of the Feast of the Cross, founded by King W≈Çadys≈Çaw I ≈Åokietek Gothic Church of the Assumption of Mary The earliest known mention of Radziej√≥w is found in a document from 1142, which states that it was given by the High Duchess consort of Poland Salomea of Berg to the monastery in Mogilno. Later it passed to the Diocese of P≈Çock. In the second half of the 13th century it grew into a significant center of local administration. It was granted town rights in 1252 by Duke Casimir I of Kuyavia, confirmed in 1298 by future Polish King W≈Çadys≈Çaw I ≈Åokietek, who granted it Magdeburg Law. Kings W≈Çadys≈Çaw I ≈Åokietek and W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço vested it with new trade privileges and Sigismund I the Old established a weekly fair. W≈Çadys≈Çaw I ≈Åokietek founded the Franciscan monastery with the Gothic Church of the Feast of the Cross, one of the landmarks of the town. It was a royal town, located in the Brze≈õƒá Kujawski Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province of the Polish Crown. The sejmiks for entire Kuyavia were held in Radziej√≥w. The local royal castle was demolished by the Swedes in 1702, during the Great Northern War. In 1720 the first Piarist college of Poland was founded in Radziej√≥w. It was moved to W≈Çoc≈Çawek in 1819. In 1793 the town found itself in Prussia following the Second Partition of Poland. In 1807 it passed to the short lived Polish Duchy of Warsaw, and then in 1815 it became a part of the Congress Poland in the Russian Empire. In the course of the 19th century the town declined. As part of Russian reprisals after the failed Polish January Uprising, the Franciscan monastery was closed down in 1864, and in 1867 Radziej√≥w lost its city charter. In 1918 it became a part of reconstituted, independent Poland, was again granted city rights in 1919 and developed again afterwards. In 1931 it had 4,025 inhabitants. The town had a Jewish community since the 18th century, with 15 Jews (5% of the population) recorded in 1793. Restrictions on Jewish settlement were in force from 1822 to 1862. According to the 1921 census the town had a Jewish community consisting of 599 people, or 19.0 percent of its total population.Jewish Historical Institute community database In 1933 Radziej√≥w obtained a railway connection as the newly built Polish Coal Trunk-Line passed just 3 km west of the town. Though no dedicated Radziej√≥w station was built, the inhabitants of the town could board trains in nearby Che≈Çmce. During World War II, the German army entered the town on September 9, 1939. During the German occupation, the town was part of Reichsgau Wartheland, a portion of Poland directly annexed by Germany. In 1940 hundreds of Poles were expelled, and their houses, shops and workshops were handed over to German colonists as part of the Lebensraum policy.Maria Wardzy≈Ñska, Wysiedlenia ludno≈õci polskiej z okupowanych ziem polskich w≈ÇƒÖczonych do III Rzeszy w latach 1939-1945, IPN, Warszawa, 2017, p. 234 (in Polish) Local catechist, priest Jan Wieczorek was among Polish teachers murdered by the Germans in the Dachau concentration camp during the Intelligenzaktion.Maria Wardzy≈Ñska, By≈Ç rok 1939.

After the war, some Jewish survivors returned to Radziej√≥w in the summer of 1945, where they found their houses and businesses taken over by Poles. After the murder on the night of 29/30 September 1945 of two Jews in nearby village Osiƒôciny, Radziej√≥w's Jews fled the town, but returned a few weeks later. In 1946 they organized a local branch of the Central Committee of Polish Jews (Centralny Komitet ≈ªyd√≥w Polskich), which functioned until 1948 by which time most of its members left Radziej√≥w. After 1949 no organised Jewish community existed and only a few individual Jews remained in the town during the subsequent decades. In 1979 a new hospital opened in Radziej√≥w designed to accommodate 272 patient beds (today functioning as Samodzielny Publiczny Zak≈Çad Opieki Zdrowotnej w Radziejowie). In 2018, \\"The Nazi, the Princess, and the Shoemaker\\" was published, describing the relationship of Poles and Jews in Radziejow prior to World War II as well as the Nazi occupation of the town and what happened to its Jewish population.

Upon construction, it would include the Burj Mubarak al-Kabir, a nature reservation of 2 square kilometres, a duty-free area which will be beside a new airport, in addition to a large business center, conference areas, environmental areas, athletic areas, and areas that concentrate on media, health, education, and industry. The City of Silk will also include numerous tourist attractions, hotels, spas, and public gardens. The city will be built in individual phases with total completion within twenty-five years. The development will cost an estimated 25 billion Kuwaiti Dinars (132 billion USD).

If the Silk City is completed it will also include Olympic Stadium, residences, hotels and retail facilities. Up to 700,000 people could be housed in the city complex and 450,000 new jobs. The complex is planned to be built across Kuwait Bay and will be linked to Kuwait City by a bridge named Jaber Bridge (Arabic: ÿ¨ÿ≥ÿ± ÿ¨ÿßÿ®ÿ±). The bridge should decrease driving times from Kuwait City to Madinat al-Hareer to 15 minutes rather than the usual one-and-a-half-hour drive around Kuwait Bay. Images of the proposed design were made public on March 30, 2006. Burj Mubarak al- Kabir The skyscraper is planned to top out at , in order to reflect the Arabian folk tale collection One Thousand and One Arabian Nights. Skyscrapers do not normally exceed 80 floors due to the amount of space that would be taken up by elevators. However, the Mubarak al-Kabir Tower would consist of a far greater number of floors. This would necessitate double or triple-decker elevators. Another challenge would be posed by the immense height of the building, which makes it vulnerable to high winds. In order to cope with these winds, the tower is designed as three interlocking towers, each twisting 45 degrees to help stabilize it. In addition, vertical ailerons will run the full length of the building on each edge. Adjustments to the positions of these ailerons will redirect the winds in order to minimize structural vibrations. The building will include seven vertically stacked 30-story 'neighborhoods\\", including apartments, offices, and hotels. Linking the neighborhoods will be several four-story \\"town squares.\\" The planned height of the building is taller than the current tallest building in the world, the 828 m Burj Khalifa, but shorter than the planned heights of the Tokyo Sky Mile Tower (in planning, 1,700 m) and Jeddah Tower (under construction, 1,008 m). The tower is estimated to be completed after the Jeddah Tower but before the Tokyo Sky Mile Tower. Bubiyan Port Madinat al-Hareer is also built on the dream of building a huge port in the biggest island in Kuwait, Bubiyan Island. Bubiyan Port, as it will be called, will serve the interests of major countries in the Middle East and Asia including Kuwait, Iraq, and Iran. In addition, the port will be one of the closest seaports to Central Asia.

It passes across the axillary artery and vein, pierces the clavipectoral (coracoclavicular) fascia, and enters the deep surface of the pectoralis major to innervate it. Function The lateral pectoral nerve provides motor innervation to the pectoralis major. Although this nerve is described as mostly motor, it also has been considered to carry proprioceptive and nociceptive fibers. It arises either from the lateral cord or directly from the anterior divisions of the upper and middle trunks of the brachial plexus, unlike the medial pectoral nerve, which derives from the medial cord (or directly from the anterior division of the lower trunk). It splits into four to seven branches that pierce the clavipectoral fascia to innervate the entire pectoralis major or its superior portion. The medial and lateral pectoral nerves form a connection, around the axillary artery, called the ansa pectoralis. The lateral pectoral nerve has been described as double, while the medial pectoral nerve has been described as single. Clinical significance The lateral pectoral nerve is important in the pain response after breast augmentation and mastectomy, and especially in breast implant surgery, when the implant is inserted by the subpectoral route. The pectoral nerves can be anesthetized (blocked) intraoperatively by the surgeon under direct vision by three injections - one to block the medial pectoral nerve, the second to block the perforating branches of the medial pectoral nerve, and the third to block the lateral pectoral nerve. An ultrasound-guided pectoral nerve block can also be performed preventively before the operation by an anesthesiologist, experienced in regional anesthesia. It is safe and relies on ultrasound imaging to localize the pectoralis major and minor muscles, the presumed course of the pectoral nerves and the optimal spread of the local anesthetic. Blockade of the lateral pectoral nerve is helpful in cases such as shoulder dislocation and other orthopedic procedures, involving the shoulder. Spasms of the pectoralis major muscle and resulting severe pain (acute or chronic) may be reduced by pectoral nerve block or neuromuscular relaxation. Decreasing the pectoral muscle tone intraoperatively by neuromuscular relaxation (paralytic agents) or by a nerve block (local anesthetic injection), can facilitate better cosmetic results during breast augmentation or post-mastectomy breast implantation. ‚ÄúThe skin projection point of the neurovascular bundle (NVB) represents the denervation point (DP).‚Äù The NVB (thoracoacromial artery and vein, plus the lateral pectoral nerve) may be the guide for local anesthetic applications in order to achieve pectoral muscle denervation. ‚ÄúRoutine botulinum toxin infiltration of the chest wall musculature at the time of mastectomy and immediate reconstruction‚Ä¶would paralyze the muscles and reduce the postoperative pain caused by muscle spasm.‚Äù See also * Medial pectoral nerve References Additional images Image:Gray807.png|Plan of brachial plexus.

It was built in 1979 to replace the Buffalo Central Terminal as Buffalo's main Amtrak station. (Buffalo‚ÄìExchange Street station, located near downtown Buffalo, has limited parking space and is located on a line that is not easily accessible by the Lake Shore Limited.) It is located 10 miles east of downtown Buffalo. The station was built to a standard design common for most Amtrak stations that were built from the 1970s to the early 1990s. Standard featured present at Depew include concrete block walls, floor-to- ceiling windows and a cantilevered black roof. The station is served by eight trains per day: two Empire Service round trips, one Lake Shore Limited round trip, and one Maple Leaf round trip. It has a single side platform adjacent to the southernmost of the four tracks of the Rochester Subdivision. The Lake Shore Subdivision, used by the Lake Shore Limited, diverges to the south between Buffalo‚ÄìDepew and downtown Buffalo. History Front of station By the late 1970s, the once-thriving Central Terminal had been cut back to only four daily trains, nowhere near enough to justify such a large station. Believing it would be prohibitive to rehabilitate the 50-year-old terminal, Amtrak decided to build a new station. Service to Depew began on October 28, 1979; hours after the last train pulled out of Central Terminal. The Empire State Express (now part of the Empire Service) and Niagara Rainbow were routed through the new station on the day it opened; previously, the only Buffalo stop for both trains had been Buffalo-Exchange Street. They were joined in 1981 by the Maple Leaf, which offered a one-seat ride from New York to Toronto. Previously, one train per day that connected with Via Rail Canada/Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway service to Toronto stopped at Exchange Street. The original building was a trailer which had previously served as the temporary station building in Dearborn, Michigan (Dearborn opened on October 1, 1979). The permanent building, which opened in 1980, was financed by the New York Department of Transportation. The station is near the site where in 1893, Empire State Express Locomotive #999 attained its alleged top speed of , making it the fastest locomotive of its time. On September 23, 2014, a bison statue was dedicated on the lawn in front of the depot. It recalls two similar pieces that once occupied prominent spots inside Buffalo Central Terminal. Funding for the fiberglass statue was raised by railroad heritage and advocacy groups within the state. A new bison statue has also been placed in Buffalo Central Terminal by the Buffalo Central Terminal Restoration Corporation.

He has won the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors Award twice as 'Songwriter of the Year' (1970 and 1977). He is a nine time Ivor Novello Awards winning songwriter. In 2007, he became the only British person to win the Edwin Forrest Award for outstanding contribution to the American theatre. Macaulay's best-known songs include \\"Baby Now That I've Found You\\" and \\"Build Me Up Buttercup\\" with The Foundations, \\"(Last Night) I Didn't Get to Sleep at All,\\" as well as \\"Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes)\\" and \\"Don't Give Up on Us\\". Career Macaulay was born in Fulham, London, England. In the early 1960s he worked as a song plugger for Essex Publishing, then moved to Pye Records as a record producer. It was here that he had his first major success with The Foundations, when they recorded, \\"Baby Now That I've Found You\\", a song he had co-written with John Macleod, and it topped the UK Singles Chart in November 1967. Further hits came with songs such as Marmalade's \\"Baby Make It Soon\\" and \\"Falling Apart at the Seams\\"; The 5th Dimension's \\"(Last Night) I Didn't Get to Sleep at All\\", David Soul's \\"Don't Give Up on Us\\", plus Donna Summer's 1977 single \\"Can't We Just Sit Down (And Talk It Over)\\", each of which he wrote on his own. Many others came in collaboration with other songwriters, amongst them were Long John Baldry's \\"Let the Heartaches Begin\\", Paper Dolls' \\"Something Here in My Heart (Keeps A Tellin' Me No)\\" and Pickettywitch's \\"That Same Old Feeling\\", all co-written with John Macleod. Another success for The Foundations was \\"Build Me Up Buttercup\\", written by Macaulay and Mike D'Abo. Scott Walker's \\"Lights of Cincinnati\\", The Hollies' \\"Sorry Suzanne\\", The New Seekers' \\"You Won't Find Another Fool Like Me\\" were penned with Geoff Stephens; whilst Edison Lighthouse's \\"Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes)\\", was written with Sylvan Whittingham and Barry Mason. In addition, he co-wrote Johnny Johnson and the Bandwagon's \\"Blame It On The Pony Express\\" and Andy Williams' \\"Home Lovin' Man\\", with Roger Cook and Roger Greenaway. Much of his attention in the early 1970s was diverted by a protracted legal dispute with his publishers. He won his case on appeal in 1974, in a landmark decision which encouraged other artists to challenge the terms of their contracts. By this time he had begun to turn his back on writing pop songs and started to write for musical theatre. His first collaborations for the stage were with the playwright Ken Hill on Is Your Doctor Really Necessary? in 1973, and on Gentlemen Prefer Anything the following year. He composed the scores to the films The Beast in the Cellar (1970) and Percy's Progress (1974), and was the music co-ordinator for the film Never Too Young to Rock (1975). He also wrote the music for Windy City, a musical in two acts based on The Front Page by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur, with book and lyrics by Dick Vosburgh, which was premiered on stage in 1982. Later Macaulay turned to writing thrillers.

Athena Co. Ltd. ported it to the Game Boy on August 29, 1997, and the PlayStation on November 5, 1998. The Japanese PlayStation version was made available by MonkeyPaw Games on the PlayStation Network's import store on November 16, 2010. It was later re-released as part of the Arcade Archives Neo Geo series for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch on June 28, 2018.  Gameplay  Arcade version screenshot. Money Puzzle Exchanger is a stacking game similar to the Magical Drop, Astro Pop, and Puzzle Bobble series whereby players race to prevent a perpetually falling array of coins in different values from filling up the screen. Coins are combined (vertically and/or horizontally) to form higher valued coins; for example, five '1' coins will form a '5' coin, and two '5' coins will form a '10' coin, and so on, until two '500' coins are put together, at which point both disappear. Coins are arranged and colored to match denominations of the yen coins. Two bonus tiles allow for changes in gameplay. A green RU tile will rank up all coins of the same denomination; for example, all '10' coins will become '50' coins. A blue ER title will erase all coins of the same value. The game is won when any coin reaches the bottom of the opponent's screen. In the single player mode, one of two characters can be selected who attempt to beat up to seven idiosyncratically named characters with names like Debtmiser, Mightdealer, Eldylabor, and Cherrybeiter. In the two player mode, both players fight each other until victory. The quicker and more efficiently each player clears out their screen, the quicker the other player's screen will fill up. Since filled screens offer the most opportunity for chaining together large combos, the tide can turn very quickly. There is also another single player mode called Solo Mode. Any character can be played in this mode. The aim in Solo Mode is to continually clear the screen from coins and try to keep the game going for as long as possible. Trivia * Most of the characters names are portmanteaus of English words involving money or love. The character names (in game stage order) are: Exchanger, Coquetry, Cherrybeiter, Everyworker, Debtmiser, Eldylabor, Macker, and Mightdealer. * The game has extensive use of Engrish. Examples of phrases used include \\"Let's fight to computer!\\" and \\"You put the same kind of items. That's OK.\\" * A soundtrack for the game was released featuring the talents of voice actresses Sakura Tange, Yukana Nogami and Machiko Toyoshima. * In the Korean arcade version the coins are made to look generic, while in the Japanese version of the game the coins are localized to look closer to their yen equivalents. * The character designs for the game were done by Atsuko Ishida (Magic Knight Rayearth, The Brave Express Might Gaine).

His compositions have included \\"You've Got Your Troubles\\" and the transatlantic million selling songs \\"I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing (in Perfect Harmony)\\" and \\"Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress\\". They were the first UK songwriting partnership to be granted an Ivor Novello Award as 'Songwriters of the Year' in two successive years. In 2009, Greenaway was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Life and career Roger Greenaway was born in Fishponds, Bristol, England. Both Greenaway and Roger Cook were members of the close harmony group the Kestrels. While on tour they decided to begin writing songs together. Their first was \\"You've Got Your Troubles\\", a No. 2 UK hit single for the Fortunes (1965), which also made No. 7 on the US Billboard Hot 100. It was the first of several successes they enjoyed during the next few years. Later that year, they began recording together as David and Jonathan. Their first single \\"Laughing Fit To Cry\\" did not chart, but they scored hits in 1966 with their cover version of the Beatles' \\"Michelle\\" and their own \\"Lovers of the World Unite\\". Their penultimate single, \\"Softly Whispering I Love You\\", in 1967, was not a success at the time, but became a No. 4 UK hit in 1971 for a subsequent Cook-Greenaway collaboration, the Congregation. In 1968 Cook and Greenaway announced that they would no longer be recording as a duo but would continue as songwriters. Their hits as writers for other acts, sometimes with other collaborators, include: \\"Home Lovin' Man\\" (Andy Williams); \\"Blame it on the Pony Express\\" (Johnny Johnson and the Bandwagon); \\"Hallejuah\\" (Deep Purple); \\"Doctor's Orders\\" (Sunny (UK) and Carol Douglas (US)); \\"It Makes No Difference\\" (Joe Dolan); \\"Something Tells Me (Something Is Gonna Happen Tonight)\\" (Cilla Black); \\"I've Got You On My Mind\\", \\"When You Are a King\\", \\"My Baby Loves Lovin'\\" (White Plains); \\"Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress\\", \\"Gasoline Alley Bred\\", (The Hollies); \\"You've Got Your Troubles\\", \\"Freedom Come, Freedom Go\\" (The Fortunes); \\"Banner Man\\", \\"Melting Pot\\", \\"Good Morning Freedom\\" (Blue Mink); \\"Green Grass\\" (Gary Lewis & the Playboys); \\"New Orleans\\" (Harley Quinne); \\"A Way of Life\\" (The Family Dogg) and \\"Something's Gotten Hold of My Heart\\" (Gene Pitney). They also wrote \\"High 'N' Dry\\" (Cliff Richard), which was the B-side of \\"Congratulations\\",‚Äù the runner-up song for the UK Eurovision Song Contest in 1968. When Blue Mink were formed in 1969, Greenaway was asked to be lead vocalist alongside Madeline Bell; he declined the offer and recommended Cook, who accepted. The following year Greenaway teamed up for a while with singer Tony Burrows to form the Pipkins, a duo who had a Top 10 novelty hit in 1970 with \\"Gimme Dat Ding\\". Also in 1970, he was briefly a member of Brotherhood of Man, who scored a UK and US top 20 hit with \\"United We Stand\\". The New Seekers' \\"I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing (in Perfect Harmony)\\" began life as a Cook‚ÄìGreenaway collaboration called \\"True Love and Apple Pie\\", recorded by Susan Shirley. The song was then rewritten by Cook, Greenaway, Coca-Cola advertising executive Bill Backer, and Billy Davis, and recorded as a Coca-Cola radio commercial, with the lyric \\"I'd like to buy the world a Coke and keep it company.\\" First aired on American radio in 1970, it was also used as a TV commercial a year later, sparking public demand for its release as a single. Reworked, again, to remove the references to the brand name, the single climbed to No. 1 in the UK and No. 7 in the US in 1972. The song has sold over a million copies in the UK. After Cook moved to the US in 1975, Greenaway worked with other partners, notably Geoff Stephens, both being jointly responsible for Dana's 1975 UK No. 4 song, \\"It's Gonna be a Cold Cold Christmas\\", and Crystal Gayle's 1980 US No. 1 country song, \\"It's Like We Never Said Goodbye\\". With Barry Mason he penned \\"Say You'll Stay Until Tomorrow\\" for Tom Jones, which spent ten weeks within the Top 40 of the Billboard Hot Country Singles (now Hot Country Songs) chart, and went to No. 1 for one week on 26 February 1977. Greenaway took an increasing role in business administration, becoming Chairman of the Performing Right Society in 1983 and, in 1995, taking charge of the European ASCAP office. He also wrote advertising jingles for Allied Carpets, Asda and British Gas. In 1998, he was awarded the Order of the British Empire for services to the music industry. He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in New York in 2009.

In 1817, he developed a progressive cipher system based on a 1790 design by Thomas Jefferson, establishing a method that was continuously improved upon and used until the end of World War II. Wadsworth's system involved a set of two disks, one inside the other, where the outer disk had the 26 letters of the alphabet and the numbers 2-8, and the inner disk had only the 26 letters. The disks were geared together at a ratio of 26:33. To encipher a message, the inner disk was turned until the desired letter was at the top position, with the number of turns required for the result transmitted as ciphertext. Due to the gearing, a ciphertext substitution for a character did not repeat until all 33 characters for the plaintext letter had been used. A similar device was invented by Charles Wheatstone several years after Wadsworth.

Originally named M.T. Graves and played by announcer Dick Dyszel, the character first appeared on the WDCA version of the Bozo the Clown program. When the character got a positive reaction, he was given his own program, called Creature Feature. The choice of Gore de Vol as the character's name was either a pun involving the name of acerbic author Gore Vidal or the name of a prominent Washington, D.C. funeral home, \\"de Vol.\\" Gore de Vol became the Washington/Baltimore area's longest-running horror host, broadcast every Saturday night on WDCA from March 1973 to May 1987. He returned to the D.C. airwaves for a one-time special, Countdown with the Count, on New Year's Eve 1999/2000. Count Gore de Vol's contribution to the American horror host tradition is significant in a number of ways. As Washington D.C.'s horror host throughout most of the 1970s and 1980s, Gore used the platform to satirize national politics from a local perspective. In the era of the Watergate scandal and Iran‚ÄìContra affair, Count Gore took frequent shots at the political folly with an ad lib, shoot-from-the-hip style that led local audiences to feel they were part of an Inside the Beltway private joke even when the subject was high profile. Count Gore's Creature Feature also embraced the sexual revolution of the 1970s, and his guests for the show included several Penthouse Pets. Though he never had an official sidekick, he frequently employed the talents of writer and actress Eleanor Herman in the role of Countess von Stauffenberger. The two played off each other with a series of romantic near misses and sexual innuendos that made the show a success even when many horror hosts were losing their shows in the wake of the original Saturday Night Live. Gore's iconoclastic style surfaced in a number of other ways. He was the first host in America to broadcast an unedited version of Night of the Living Dead. He also began transmitting his own show in stereophonic sound a week before his station officially made the announcement, making Creature Feature Washington's first stereo broadcast. After a five-year hiatus from the air, Count Gore returned to WDCA 20 in 1984 and a second wave of popularity kept the show a local fixture until new owners canceled all local programing in 1987. During this time, Gore made numerous public appearances with live shows and Halloween events and received thousands of fan correspondences, making Count Gore one of the most popular figures in the history of D.C. media. In 1998, Count Gore de Vol became the first horror host to present a weekly show on the Internet, featuring streaming video of movies and shorts hosted by the Count, and interviews with celebrities.Dan Zak, Scared Silly With Count Gore de Vol, Washington Post, October 12, 2008 Other hosts from around the country also contribute to the program, providing reviews, contests, and other \\"strange and evil creations.\\" There are also several regular features on the site, from movie and book reviews to monster model building and horror inspired music and video games. Count Gore remains busy, as he approaches his 35th year. He is a regular convention guest at Baltimore, Maryland and the Horrorfind Weekend in Baltimore and Cinema Wasteland in Cleveland, Ohio. In 2004 he wrote the introduction to the Steve Niles' graphic novel Aleister Arcane. In 2006, 2007, and 2008, the Count made appearances in Northern Virginia on the new live television and Internet program Monster Madhouse Live, starring \\"Karlos Borloff\\", a.k.a. Jerry Moore. In October 2006 and 2007 he hosted the opening nights for the horror film fest The Spooky Movie Film Festival in Silver Spring, Maryland. He is featured alongside fellow horror hosts in the documentary, American Scary (2006), which screened at the 2007 San Diego Comic-Con. Count Gore also hosted the costume contests at the horror/sci-fi convention Pensacon (Pensacola, Florida) in 2014 and 2015.

Often scenes are shot quickly in real locations without any warning, and without obtaining filming permits. Guerrilla filmmaking is usually done by independent filmmakers because they don't have the budget or time to obtain permits, rent out locations, or build expensive sets. Larger and more \\"mainstream\\" film studios tend to avoid guerrilla filmmaking tactics because of the risk of being sued, fined or having their reputation damaged due to negative PR publicity. According to Yukon Film Commission Manager Mark Hill, \\"Guerrilla filmmaking is driven by passion with whatever means at hand\\". Guerrilla films Janet Maslin of The New York Times characterized Ed Wood as a guerrilla filmmaker. As depicted in the biopic Ed Wood, Wood stole a fake octopus for one of the scenes in his low budget films. Film critic Roger Ebert described Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song, directed by Melvin Van Peebles, as \\"a textbook on guerrilla filmmaking\\" in his review of Baadasssss!, a biopic about the making of Sweet Sweetback. Ben Sisario of The New York Times called Van Peebles \\"a hero of guerrilla filmmaking\\" who has suffered for his uncompromising vision. Spike Lee's She's Gotta Have It was a guerrilla film on a budget of $175,000 which made $7,137,502 at the box office. It was Spike Lee's first feature-length film and inspired him to write the book Spike Lee's Gotta Have It: Inside Guerrilla Filmmaking. New Queer Cinema director Gregg Araki shot his first two films, Three Bewildered People in the Night (1987) and The Long Weekend (O' Despair) (1989) using a spring-wound Bolex camera and scrap film stock, on a budget of $5,000 each. Robert Rodriguez shot the action film El Mariachi in Spanish. El Mariachi, which was shot for around $7,000 with money partially raised by volunteering in medical research studies, won the Audience Award at the Sundance Film Festival in 1992. The film, originally intended for the Spanish-language low-budget home-video market, was distributed by Columbia Pictures in the United States. Rodriguez described his experiences making the film in his book Rebel Without a Crew. The book and film would inspire other filmmakers to pick up cameras and make no-budget movies. Pi, directed by Darren Aronofsky, was made on a budget of $68,000. It proved to be a financial success at the box office ($4.6 million gross worldwide). Aronofsky raised money for the project by selling $100 shares in the film to family and friends, and was able to pay them all back with a $50 profit per-share when the film was sold to Artisan. Troma Entertainment is a film production and distribution company founded by Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz in 1974. The company produces low-budget independent films, many of which have developed cult followings. Kaufman has been outspoken about their use of guerrilla marketing and tolerance of piracy, and he has written the books All I Need to Know about Filmmaking I Learned from the Toxic Avenger and Make Your Own Damn Movie!, which outline his philosophy of quick and inexpensive independent film. Paranormal Activity, directed by first time director Oren Peli, was shot for approximately $10,000. Michael Cieply of The New York Times described the production and release as \\"guerrilla style\\". After being well received at film festivals, Paramount put the film on a tour where fans could request a screening. Escape From Tomorrow, made for $650,000, was \\"shot in a guerrilla-style manner at Walt Disney World and Disneyland without the permission of the parks,\\" according to Jason Guerrasio of Indiewire. The film was originally expected to not be released due to fears of a lawsuit from Disney, but it was released on video on demand in October 2013. \\"Clark: A Gonzomentary' was a 2012 gonzo journalism-styled mockumentary about an amateur filmmaker documenting a Philadelphian eccentric artist and his creative process. The guerrilla-style techniques implemented were used as part of the story itself, to represent the amateur production within the story. It was shot with a budget of less than $3,000 with a Canon XL2 and a Panasonic AG- DVX100. The director opted out of using a steadicam purposefully to achieve more shakiness. It was awarded Outstanding Lead Actor in a comedy or mockumentary by The 2013 LA Web Series Festival and deemed \\"a gonzomentary truly realized\\" by Mark Bell of Film Threat. \\"Midnight Rider\\", a biopic of Gregg Allman, attempted to use guerrilla filmmaking methods to illegally film a sequence on a railroad bridge in active use. A train coming shattered a metal bed placed on the tracks, killing camera operator Sarah Jones. Director Randall Miller was sentenced to two years imprisonment for involuntary manslaughter while producer Jay Sedrish received a suspended sentence of ten years' probation. Both were prohibited from working in any directorial or safety-related role for a decade. Super Demetrios (2011), the first Greek superhero film, made on a budget of ‚Ç¨2,000, won the audience award at the 52nd Thessaloniki International Film Festival with the highest number of votes in the history of the festival and became an instant cult classic, \\"proving that Greek guerrilla cinema can survive without state funding injections\\" according to Giannis Zoumboulakis of To Vima newspaper. Technology The advent of digital cameras and home computer editing systems such as Final Cut Pro, Avid Media Composer and Premiere Pro are a contributing factor to the increase in guerrilla filmmaking. Digital editing is a cheap and easy form of editing that allows the filmmaker to edit anywhere and at a low budget. Many guerrilla filmmakers are now using professional quality digital cameras because of their cheap cost, and the ability to set up shots quickly.

It covers 342 km¬≤. History Gaua was first sighted by Europeans during the Spanish expedition of Pedro Fern√°ndez de Quir√≥s, from 25 to 29 April 1606. The island‚Äôs name was then charted as Santa Mar√≠a.Kelly, Celsus, O.F.M. La Austrialia del Esp√≠ritu Santo.

Physical geography  Location of the Banks Islands in the north of Vanuatu It has rugged terrain, reaching up to Mount Gharat (797 m), the peak of the active stratovolcano at the center of the island. The most recent eruption was in 2013. The volcano has a 6 √ó 9 km caldera, within which lies a crater lake known as Lake Letas, the largest lake in Vanuatu. To the east of the lake is Siri Waterfall (120 m drop). The climate on the island is humid tropical. The average annual rainfall exceeds 3500 mm. Gaua is subject to frequent earthquakes and cyclones.  Population and languages  The island has a population of 2,491 (in 2009), with an annual growth rate of 2.0 percent. This population is scattered in various coastal villages on the western, southern and northeastern sides of the island. The eastern side has a few hamlets with an immigrant population coming mainly from the two smaller islands Merig and Merelava, southeast of Gaua. The largest village is Jolap, on the west coast.Satellite photo of Jolap village . Besides the language of this immigrant population (Mwerlap), there are five languages traditionally spoken on Gaua: Lakon or Vur√©; Olrat; Koro; Dorig and Nume.  Economy  The population of Gaua lives off the traditional agricultural economy of Melanesia, combining fishing and horticulture. The principal exports are copra and cacao. Transportation The island is served by Gaua Airport at the northeast corner of the island.

In mathematics, the logarithmic mean is a function of two non-negative numbers which is equal to their difference divided by the logarithm of their quotient. This calculation is applicable in engineering problems involving heat and mass transfer. Definition The logarithmic mean is defined as: :\\\\begin{align} M_\\\\text{lm}(x, y) &= \\\\lim_{(\\\\xi, \\\\eta) \\\\to (x, y)} \\\\frac{\\\\eta - \\\\xi}{\\\\ln(\\\\eta) - \\\\ln(\\\\xi)} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= \\\\begin{cases} x & \\\\text{if }x = y ,\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{y - x}{\\\\ln(y) - \\\\ln(x)} & \\\\text{otherwise,} \\\\end{cases} \\\\end{align} for the positive numbers x, y.  Inequalities  The logarithmic mean of two numbers is smaller than the arithmetic mean and the generalized mean with exponent one third but larger than the geometric mean, unless the numbers are the same, in which case all three means are equal to the numbers. : \\\\sqrt{x y} \\\\leq M_\\\\text{lm}(x, y) \\\\leq \\\\left(\\\\frac{x^{1/3}+y^{1/3}}2\\\\right)^3 \\\\leq \\\\frac{x + y}{2} \\\\qquad \\\\text{ for all } x > 0 \\\\text{ and } y > 0.  Derivation   Mean value theorem of differential calculus  From the mean value theorem, there exists a value \\\\xi in the interval between x and y where the derivative f' equals the slope of the secant line: :\\\\exists \\\\xi \\\\in (x, y): \\\\ f'(\\\\xi) = \\\\frac{f(x) - f(y)}{x - y} The logarithmic mean is obtained as the value of \\\\xi by substituting \\\\ln for f and similarly for its corresponding derivative: :\\\\frac{1}{\\\\xi} = \\\\frac{\\\\ln(x) - \\\\ln(y)}{x - y} and solving for \\\\xi: :\\\\xi = \\\\frac{x - y}{\\\\ln(x) - \\\\ln(y)}  Integration  The logarithmic mean can also be interpreted as the area under an exponential curve. : \\\\begin{align} L(x, y) ={} & \\\\int_0^1 x^{1-t} y^t\\\\ \\\\mathrm{d}t ={} \\\\int_0^1 \\\\left(\\\\frac{y}{x}\\\\right)^t x\\\\ \\\\mathrm{d}t ={} x \\\\int_0^1 \\\\left(\\\\frac{y}{x}\\\\right)^t \\\\mathrm{d}t \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[3pt] ={} & \\\\left.\\\\frac{x}{\\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\frac{y}{x}\\\\right)} \\\\left(\\\\frac{y}{x}\\\\right)^t\\\\right|_{t=0}^1 ={} \\\\frac{x}{\\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\frac{y}{x}\\\\right)} \\\\left(\\\\frac{y}{x} - 1\\\\right) ={} \\\\frac{y - x}{\\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\frac{y}{x}\\\\right)} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[3pt] ={} & \\\\frac{y - x}{\\\\ln\\\\left(y\\\\right) - \\\\ln\\\\left(x\\\\right)} \\\\end{align} The area interpretation allows the easy derivation of some basic properties of the logarithmic mean. Since the exponential function is monotonic, the integral over an interval of length 1 is bounded by x and y. The homogeneity of the integral operator is transferred to the mean operator, that is L(cx, cy) = cL(x, y). Two other useful integral representations are{1 \\\\over L(x,y)} = \\\\int_0^1 {\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\\\\\!t \\\\over t x + (1-t)y}and{1 \\\\over L(x,y)} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty {\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\\\\\!t \\\\over (t+x)\\\\,(t+y)}.  Generalization   Mean value theorem of differential calculus  One can generalize the mean to n + 1 variables by considering the mean value theorem for divided differences for the nth derivative of the logarithm. We obtain :L_\\\\text{MV}(x_0,\\\\, \\\\dots,\\\\, x_n) = \\\\sqrt[-n]{(-1)^{(n+1)} n \\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\left[x_0,\\\\, \\\\dots,\\\\, x_n\\\\right]\\\\right)} where \\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\left[x_0,\\\\, \\\\dots,\\\\, x_n\\\\right]\\\\right) denotes a divided difference of the logarithm. For n = 2 this leads to :L_\\\\text{MV}(x, y, z) = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{(x - y) \\\\left(y - z\\\\right)\\\\left(z - x\\\\right)}{2 \\\\left(\\\\left(y - z\\\\right) \\\\ln\\\\left(x\\\\right) + \\\\left(z - x\\\\right) \\\\ln\\\\left(y\\\\right) + \\\\left(x - y\\\\right) \\\\ln\\\\left(z\\\\right)\\\\right)}}.  Integral  The integral interpretation can also be generalized to more variables, but it leads to a different result. Given the simplex S with S = \\\\\\\\{\\\\left(\\\\alpha_0,\\\\, \\\\dots,\\\\, \\\\alpha_n\\\\right) : \\\\left(\\\\alpha_0 + \\\\dots + \\\\alpha_n = 1\\\\right) \\\\land \\\\left(\\\\alpha_0 \\\\ge 0\\\\right) \\\\land \\\\dots \\\\land \\\\left(\\\\alpha_n \\\\ge 0\\\\right)\\\\\\\\} and an appropriate measure \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\alpha which assigns the simplex a volume of 1, we obtain :L_\\\\text{I}\\\\left(x_0,\\\\, \\\\dots,\\\\, x_n\\\\right) = \\\\int_S x_0^{\\\\alpha_0} \\\\cdot \\\\,\\\\cdots\\\\, \\\\cdot x_n^{\\\\alpha_n}\\\\ \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\alpha This can be simplified using divided differences of the exponential function to :L_\\\\text{I}\\\\left(x_0,\\\\, \\\\dots,\\\\, x_n\\\\right) = n! \\\\exp\\\\left[\\\\ln\\\\left(x_0\\\\right),\\\\, \\\\dots,\\\\, \\\\ln\\\\left(x_n\\\\right)\\\\right].

Connection to other means  * Arithmetic mean: \\\\frac{L\\\\left(x^2, y^2\\\\right)}{L(x, y)} = \\\\frac{x + y}{2} * Geometric mean: \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{L\\\\left(x, y\\\\right)}{L\\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{x}, \\\\frac{1}{y} \\\\right)}} = \\\\sqrt{x y} * Harmonic mean: \\\\frac{ L\\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{x}, \\\\frac{1}{y} \\\\right) }{L\\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{x^2}, \\\\frac{1}{y^2} \\\\right)} = \\\\frac{2}{\\\\frac{1}{x}+\\\\frac{1}{y}}  See also  * A different mean which is related to logarithms is the geometric mean. * The logarithmic mean is a special case of the Stolarsky mean. * Logarithmic mean temperature difference * Log semiring  References  ;Citations ;Bibliography *Oilfield Glossary: Term 'logarithmic mean'  Stolarsky, Kenneth B.: Generalizations of the logarithmic mean, Mathematics Magazine, Vol. 48, No. 2, Mar., 1975, pp 87‚Äì92 Mean Category:Means ","title":"Logarithmic mean"},{"id":"4490772","text":"Bernd Herbert Schmitt is a professor of international business in the marketing department at Columbia Business School, Columbia University in New York.

She was the companion of Metrodorus of Lampsacus.Diogenes Laertius, x. 23 The information we have about her is scant. She was said to have been a hetaera ‚Äì a courtesan or prostitute.Athenaeus, Deipnosophistae, xiii. 588, 593 This might be misogynistic or anti-Epicurean slander ‚Äì though there is no evidence for such a claim. On the other hand, hetaerae often enjoyed an independence denied to most other women in the male-dominated society of ancient Greece. Epicurus' school was unusual in that it allowed women and even slaves to attend. Diogenes La√´rtius has preserved a line from a letter that Epicurus evidently wrote to Leontion, in which Epicurus praises her for her well-written arguments against certain philosophical views (which aren't mentioned in Diogenes' quote).Diogenes Laertius, x. 5 According to Pliny, she was painted by Aristides of Thebes in a work entitled \\"Leontion thinking of Epicurus.\\"Pliny, Nat. Hist., 35.99 According to Cicero, Leontion is said to have published arguments criticizing the famous philosopher Theophrastus: > Leontium, that mere courtesan, who had the effrontery to write a riposte to > Theophrastus ‚Äì mind you, she wrote elegantly in good Attic, but still, this > was the licence which prevailed in the Garden of Epicurus.Cicero, De Natura > Deorum i. 33/93.

It improved access to the next section of water during low tide conditions, and is the first lock. It is sometimes known as \\"Top Hill Low\\", which is the name of the large pumping station located there. Location Near the small hamlet of Hempholme, the lock is about south of Bethells Bridge. Access can be made by a footpath from Hempholme, or via the waterworks at Top Hill Low which is also a nature reserve. ;Situated on the Driffield Navigation *Next Place Upstream: Bethells Bridge *Next Place Downstream: Wilfholme Landing History During the navigation improvements of 1803‚Äì1811, a new lock cut was made to bypass a large meandering loop of the River Hull around Struncheon Hill. William Chapman, who looked after the works, built the lock to the standard dimensions of the rest of the navigation ‚Äì to take vessels long, by wide. This is a standard known for Yorkshire Keels, however on further investigation it seems the lock was built to longer dimensions and in 2009 Michael Askin took a Royalty Class Narrow Boat Victoria of in length through the lock ‚Äì though the boat would only fit pointing upstream due to low water levels not allowing enough depth over the top cill. Lower chamber sluice, and behind, the pumping station The lock was originally built as a single lock, but like Snakeholme lock, it was found that at low tides there was not enough depth to get over the bottom cill, so a second chamber was added. To empty the chamber a large hole through one lock wall, and a wooden sluice was used. The lower lock was filled by emptying the upper lock. Originally made with oak gates, with handspike paddlegear, the top gates were replaced with unusual steel gates by Yorkshire Water, who looked after the navigation for drainage, and water supply. The gates instead of having balance beams to open them, had a complicated rack system which pulled them open with a windlass. The paddles were designed like weir sluices, and take many turns to open them. A weir was built at the lock to control the river level. Around the same time the top gates were replaced the weir was replaced by an automatically controlled structure. There is a small building next to the weir which houses water level meter, and control systems for the weir. Originally it had a glass window, and it was possible to look in and see a paper roll on which the level was recorded. It has now been bricked up due to vandalism. The weir is a noted fishing area, with a resident population of perch, gudgeon and pike. The bottom gates were replaced in 1982 by the Driffield Navigation Amenities Association with steel ones, but these had balance beams. As a concession to cost, screw style paddles were used. Just below the lock a steam powered pumping station was built to lift drain water to the river. The steam engine was replaced by diesels at some point, but the boilers were left in the structure.

It happened on Babrra ground in Charsadda District on the order of the chief minister of the NWFP, Abdul Qayyum Khan Kashmiri (not to be confused with Sahibzada Abdul Qayyum Khan, NWFP's first chief minister during the British Raj).M. Rafique Afzal (April 1, 2002). Pakistan: History and Politics, 1947‚Äì1971. p. 38 OUP Pakistan. . Background The Khudai Khidmatgar was a movement which was led by Abdul Ghaffar Khan (Bacha Khan). The movement was initially focused on reform to the status of the Pashtuns in the British Raj and later focused on independence of India from the British rule. The movement's leader, Abdul Ghaffar Khan, was a staunch supporter of United India and wanted North-West Frontier Province (present-day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) to join United India. Until 1930, the Pashtuns were not very involved in politics. In 1937, the movement won the elections for the North- West Frontier Province in alliance with the Congress Party, as Bacha Khan's brother, Khan Abdul Jabbar Khan (Dr. Khan Sahib), became the provincial chief minister. The movement also won an absolute majority in the 1946 elections. Despite the Bannu Resolution in which the Khudai Khidmatgars demanded that the province should become independent or join Afghanistan, the NWFP joined the Dominion of Pakistan as a result of the 1947 NWFP referendum which had been boycotted by the movement. Before the Babrra incident, the elected provincial government of Dr. Khan Sahib in the North-West Frontier Province was terminated by Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the Governor-General of Pakistan. A Muslim League leader, Abdul Qayyum Khan Kashmiri, was appointed as the new chief minister of the NWFP on 23 August 1947. The new provincial government imprisoned the Khudai Khidmatgar‚Äôs anti-Pakistan movement's leader Bacha Khan, as well as the deposed chief minister Dr. Khan Sahib, and some other notable figures of the region. In July 1948, the British governor of the NWFP Ambrose Flux Dundas promulgated an ordinance, authorizing the provincial government to detain anyone and confiscate their property without giving a reason. On 12 August 1948, supporters of the Khudai Khidmatgar movement protested against the arrest of their leaders and the new ordinance enforced by the government. The protesters marched from Charsadda to Babrra ground. However, when they reached Babrra ground, Abdul Qayyum Khan ordered the police to open fire on protesters. According to official figures, around 15 protestors were killed while around 40 were injured. However, Khudai Khidmatgar sources maintained that around 699 were killed and 400 were injured. Aftermath In mid- September 1948, the central government of Pakistan banned the Khudai Khidmatgar movement and many of its supporters were arrested. The provincial government destroyed the centre of the Khudai Khidmatgar movement at Sardaryab, Charsadda District.August 12, 1948: Remembering Pakistan's forgotten massacre at Babrra. The Nation.

Tour Through the Whole Island of Great Britain. Department of Geography. University of Portsmouth. Other than Robinson Crusoe, Tour was Defoe's most popular and financially successful work during the eighteenth century. Pat Rogers notes that in Defoe‚Äôs use of the ‚Äúliterary vehicle (the ‚Äòtour‚Äô or ‚Äòcircuit‚Äô) that could straddle the literal and the imaginative,‚Äù ‚ÄúNothing...anticipated Defoe‚Äôs Tour‚Äù. Thanks in part to his extensive travels and colourful background as a soldier, businessman, and spy, Defoe had ‚Äúhit on the best blend of objective fact and personal commentary‚Äù in his descriptions of locations and trips around Britain.  Composition and structure  The Tour is roughly divided into several tours, or circuits, around Britain. Volume 1 contains three letters. The first two, Through Essex, Colchester, Harwich, Suffolk, Norfolk, and Cambridgeshire, and through Kent Coast, Maidstone, Canterbury, Sussex, Hampshire, and Surrey, are complete circuits, both beginning and ending in London. Letter 3 describes a journey out to Land's End, while Letter 4 starts Volume 2 with the journey back. Letter 5 focuses on London and the Court. Volume 2 ends with Letters 6 and 7 describing a path out to Anglesey and back. Finally, in Volume 3, the narrator begins at the Trent or the Mersey and slowly travels northwards from the Midlands, taking up Letters 8 through 10. Finally, Scotland is divided into three convenient units for Letters 11 through 13. Defoe did not necessarily travel to all of these locations, and certainly did not travel them as or just before he was writing the work; rather, he relied on his past journeys, likely during his time as a merchant or while working for politician Robert Harley in the early 18th century, and, at times, relied on or was inspired by other travel literature such as William Camden's Britannia and John Strype's new version of John Stow's Survey of London.  Publication history  Following the first edition, printed between 1724 and 1727, the Tour was published several more times. A decade after the original printing, printer and future novelist Samuel Richardson secured the rights and printed the second edition of the Tour, releasing an edition with substantial revisions on 13 October 1738. He was responsible for at least some of the revisions in this edition, as well as in the subsequent editions of 1742, 1748, 1753, and 1761‚Äì62. Richardson's biographers comment that a ‚Äútravel book seems an odd thing for Richardson to have worked on, since few men were less travelled,‚Äù and note that, ‚Äúas it is revised [by Richardson], the Tour becomes less and less like a travel book‚Äù.

It flows into the Cocahuayco River. Although the waterfall had been well known to locals for centuries (it is in full view of a nearby village), its existence was not made known to the world until after an expedition made in 2002 by a German, Stefan Ziemendorff, with a group of Peruvian explorers. The waterfall, which can be seen from several kilometers away, has been christened Gocta Falls, after the name of the nearest settlement. Gocta Waterfall upper section At the time of the discovery, Ziemendorff successfully persuaded the Peruvian government to map the falls and to measure their height. On 11 March 2006, following his third expedition to the falls, he held a press conference, the contents of which were published by several of the world's wire services. He stated that the total height was measured at , which ranked Gocta as the third-tallest free-leaping waterfall in the world after Angel Falls in Venezuela and Tugela Falls in South Africa. However, this was apparently based on outdated and incomplete information gleaned from the National Geographic Society, and Ziemendorff's comments as to the waterfalls' ranking have since been widely disputed. Citing various encyclopedias, reference books, and webpages accessible through Google, Gocta Cataracts are unofficially listed as the world's fifth-tallest, after adding Ramnefjellsfossen (Norway) and Mongefossen (Norway). Furthermore, The World Waterfall Database ranks Gocta as the 16th tallest. The waterfall, which can be seen from several kilometers away, has been christened Gocta Falls, after the name of the nearest settlement. Clouds in front of waterfall The daily El Comercio said that the impressive waterfall had remained unknown to outsiders until now, because local people feared the curse of a beautiful blond mermaid who lived in its waters, if they revealed its whereabouts. \\"The falls are supposed to be protected by a white-haired mermaid like spirit whose hair can be seen flowing down the massive U-shaped walls at the bottom of the falls.\\" On 13 March 2006, the Peruvian government announced to the press that the area surrounding the falls would be developed as a tourist attraction, with a target date for sometime in mid-2007. A small hotel was built from the base of the waterfall, with all rooms having views of the waterfall. Tourists can now hike the trails by foot or horse to the misty base of the waterfall.

The challenges faced during Denmark's absolute monarchy in 1660 are chronicled in Jammersminde (Remembered Woes) by Leonora Christina of the Blue Tower. Ludvig Holberg (1684‚Äì1754), influenced by the ideas of the Enlightenment and Humanism, is considered the founder of modern Danish and Norwegian literature. Neoclassical poetry, drama, and the essay flourished during the 18th century influenced by French and English trends. German influence is seen in the verse of the leading poets of the late 18th century such as Johannes Ewald and Jens Baggesen. Other 18th century writers include the hymn writer Hans Adolph Brorson and the satirical poet Johan Herman Wessel. During Denmark's Golden Age (1800‚Äì1850), literature centred on Romantic thinking, with authors such as philosopher Henrik Steffens and the poet Bernhard Severin Ingemann (1789‚Äì1862). One of the most important figures in Danish literary culture was Nikolaj Grundtvig (1783‚Äì1872). Hans Christian Andersen (1805‚Äì1875) is remembered first and foremost for his fairy tales, written between 1835 and 1872. S√∏ren Kierkegaard (1813‚Äì1855) was an existentialist philosopher and a theologian. Jens Peter Jacobsen (1847‚Äì1885) began the naturalist movement in Denmark with his romantic, melancholic poems. The Modern Breakthrough was a Scandinavian movement influenced by naturalism towards the end of the 19th century (1870‚Äì1890), led by Georg Brandes (1842‚Äì1927). Other writers include Holger Drachmann (1846‚Äì1908), Herman Bang (1857‚Äì1912), and Sophus Schandorph. Henrik Pontoppidan (1857‚Äì1943) became a Nobel prize winner in 1917 for his \\"authentic descriptions of present-day life in Denmark\\". The 20th century began with reactions against the naturalist movement, moving instead towards nationalism. A national conservative trend was embodied in the works of Kaj Munk and Valdemar R√∏rdam. Modern realism was practiced by Bang and J.P. Jacobsen. Social realism was practiced by Hans Kirk and Martin Andersen Nex√∏. Jeppe Aakj√¶r (1866‚Äì1930), Johannes J√∏rgensen (1866‚Äì1956) and Nobel prize-winner Johannes V. Jensen (1873‚Äì1950) brought a new dimension to Danish literature. Karen Blixen (1885‚Äì1962), who also used the pen name \\"Isak Dinesen\\" is notable for her memoir Out of Africa (1937). Important post-WW II authors include Tove Ditlevsen (1917‚Äì1976), Klaus Rifbjerg (born 1931), Dan Tur√®ll (1946‚Äì1993), Leif Davidsen (born 1950), Bjarne Reuter (born 1950), Peter H√∏eg (born 1957), Jens Christian Gr√∏ndahl (born 1959), Benny Andersen (born 1929), Anders Bodelsen (born 1937), Elsebeth Egholm (born 1960), Christian Kampmann (1939‚Äì1988), Dea Trier M√∏rch (1941‚Äì2001), Jakob Ejersbo (1968‚Äì2008), Jussi Adler-Olsen (born 1950), and Birgithe Kosovic (born 1972). Among today's most successful authors are Leif Davidsen who writes gripping spy stories with a political extension, Bjarne Reuter with his intriguing novels for younger readers and Jens Christian Gr√∏ndahl whose love stories with a psychological twist include \\"Silence in October\\" and \\"An Altered Light\\". Middle Ages runestones at Jelling The earliest preserved texts from Denmark are runic inscriptions on memorial stones and other objects. Some of them contain short poems in alliterative verse. The advent of Christianity in the 10th century brought Denmark into contact with European learning, including the Latin language and alphabet, but it was not until the late 12th century that this was to bear significant literary fruit in Gesta Danorum, an ambitious historical work by Saxo Grammaticus. Saxo's work is an important primary source for the study of Scandinavian myths and legends as well as a lively account of Danish history up to the author's own time. Other medieval literary works include the Danish ballads, recorded since the 16th century by aristocratic ladies in their manuscript albums. These led to the \\"Book of a Hundred Ballads (1591) published by Anders S√∏rensen Vedel, \\"Collection Tragica\\" (1695) by Metter G√∏ya and the \\"Book of a Hundred Ballads\\" by Peter Syv in 1695.\\"Literature\\" , Danish foreign ministry.

Major authors of the time include the humanist Christiern Pedersen, who translated the New Testament into Danish, and Poul Helgesen who vigorously opposed the Reformation. The 16th century also saw Denmark's earliest plays, including the works of Hieronymus Justesen Ranch. The 17th century was an era of renewed interest in Scandinavian antiquities with scholars like Ole Worm at the forefront. Though religious dogmatism was on the rise the passionate hymns of Thomas Kingo transcended the genre with personal expression.

In addition to a huge stream of articles and poems, he wrote a number of books, including two histories of the world (1814 and 1817), the long historical poem Roskilde-Riim (Rhyme of Roskilde) (1813), and a book- sized commentary, Roskilde Saga. Grundtvig's hymn book effected a great change in Danish church services, substituting the hymns of the national poets for the slow measures of the orthodox Lutherans.

A national conservative trend was embodied in the works priest, novelist and playwright Kaj Munk, and in the neo-romanticist national poetry of Valdemar R√∏rdam. A more influential trajectory took its cue from the modern realism of Bang and J.P. Jacobsen, and developed an influential brand of social realism.

The period also saw the introduction of a regional approach to literature by writers such as Jeppe Aakj√¶r (1866‚Äì1930) from Jutland and his wife Marie Bregendahl. Focusing more on personal concerns, Johannes J√∏rgensen (1866‚Äì1956) and Nobel prize-winner Johannes V.

Hamilton, the third book in her Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter series. Within the novel, the \\"Circus of the Damned\\" is the name of a supernatural circus that operated by Jean-Claude and serves as one of the main locations within the book. Hamilton employed the practice of titling the novels after a location within each novel for most of the books in the series. Plot introduction Circus of the Damned continues the adventures of Anita Blake. Anita simultaneously attempts to solve a series of murders by an unknown vampire pack, fend off the advances of her would be vampire master, Jean-Claude and deal with various people and creatures who wish her to reveal Jean-Claude's identity and location. As with its predecessors, Circus of the Damned blends elements of supernatural, hardboiled detective, and police procedural fiction. Characters  Major characters Circus of the Damned features the following major characters. * Anita Blake: Anita continues her progression, as she initially is willing to kill Jean-Claude rather than be marked as his human servant, but ultimately continues to accept her role as a bridge between the worlds of humans and monsters in order to save the city. At the end of Circus of the Damned, Anita sees Jean-Claude as something more of a person and is willing to continue dating Richard, even though he is one of \\"the monsters.\\" * Jean-Claude: Hamilton reveals a little more of Jean-Claude's character in this novel. Jean-Claude's control over the city is apparently precarious, and, true to form, he attempts to use this very weakness to force Anita to surrender to him, showing his previously established manipulative, seductive, and somewhat ruthless nature. In addition, Jean-Claude proves himself quite brave in his vastly overmatched battle against Mr. Oliver, and quite deeply attached to Anita when he does not attempt to kill her in revenge for her almost killing him, nor does he surrender his romantic pursuit. * Richard Zeeman: A \\"nice guy\\" alternative to Jean-Claude's manipulative seduction, Richard's good looks and brown hair remind Anita of Phillip, the doomed stripper from Guilty Pleasures. Richard's good looks, charm, and emotional vulnerability contributed to the love/hate relationship Anita developed with him over the next several novels. * Mr Oliver: Mr Oliver is the most threatening opponent Anita had faced to date, and possibly the most threatening ever. By personifying her previous attitude that vampires were irredeemable monsters, Mr Oliver helped move Anita to some middle ground. * Alejandro: An ancient vampire who is the first vampire to share all four marks with her, and thus the first to make her his full human servant, though she is by no means servant-like towards him. Because of his actions in this novel she is freed of Jean Claudes marks that she had gained in Guilty Pleasures. Other characters * Circus of the Damned featured reappearances from Anita's coworkers, Bert, and Ronnie, police officers Dolph and Zerbrowski, and recurring character John Burke * The novel introduced recurring characters Larry Kirkland and Stephen. * Non-recurring characters include: Jeremy Rubens, the leader of Humans Against Vampires, Karl Inger, the human servant of Mr Oliver, The first vampire to make her their full human servant Alejandro, Rashida, Melanie, and Marguerite, a beautiful but unstable blue eyed blonde who is Yasmeen's human servant and lover. After Yasmeen was killed, Marguerite clawed her eyes out in grief. * The death toll in Circus of the Damned includes: Calvin Rupert and Reba Baker, Humans Against Vampires members killed by Alejandro's pack; hospital guard Jimmy Dugan, an unnamed guard, an unnamed nurse and an unnamed vampire counsellor, killed by Rupert in an animalistic vampire state; Calvin Rupert, killed again as a vampire by Anita and John Burke; Raju, Ronald, and two unnamed men, all men ensorcelled by Melanie and killed by Anita; two unnamed snake creatures killed by Anita and Edward during the final battle; an unnamed child vampire and two unnamed women vampires, all members of Alejandro's pack and killed (probably by Edward) during the final battle; Yasmeen, killed by Alejandro, and Oliver and Alejandro both killed by Anita.

Williams, Jr. (1921 - 1994) was a Tennessee State Senator from 1972 to 1992. Biography Avon Nyanza Williams, Jr. was born in Knoxville, Tennessee. He was a 1940 graduate of Johnson C. Smith University, an historically black university located in Charlotte, North Carolina. He subsequently studied law at the Boston University School of Law and was admitted to the Tennessee and Massachusetts bars in 1948. He practiced law in Knoxville from 1949 to 1953, then he moved to Nashville. In 1956, he married Joan Bontemps, the daughter of Fisk University Librarian and author, Arna Bontemps The couple had two children, Avon Williams III and Wendy Janette Williams. Williams‚Äô first cousin, Thurgood Marshall, was the chief lawyer for the Legal Defense and Educational Fund of the NAACP. In Nashville, Williams was an active member of the NAACP, long serving on its executive board, and active as a civil rights attorney and a key figure in the Nashville-area Civil Rights Movement. Through these efforts he met Z. Alexander Looby, a fellow African American lawyer focused on civil rights. He joined Looby‚Äôs practice and together they helped defend African Americans participating in the movement. Additionally, he was an active alumnus of the Omega Psi Phi fraternity and served as a Reserve lieutenant colonel in the United States Army Judge Advocate General's Corps. He also was an instructor in \\"dental jurisprudence\\" in the dental department of Nashville's Meharry Medical College, one of the few historically black medical schools. Williams was extremely active in school desegregation, long serving as a plaintiff's counsel in Nashville's long-running (40 year plus) school desegregation lawsuit which resulted in forced busing, making him extremely unpopular with elements of Nashville's white community and even the subject of death threats by white supremacists. In 1955, Williams and Looby filed suit against the Nashville school system. Kelley v. Board of Education of Nashville followed the Brown v. Board of Education ruling and pushed for school desegregation. The case highlighted the busing controversy and lasted for thirty years. In 1960, Williams other civil rights lawyers represented the students arrested for the Nashville sit-ins, an event he discussed in relation to other civil rights issues in a 1964 interview with Robert Penn Warren for the book Who Speaks for the Negro?. In 1969 Williams was elected as a Democrat to the Tennessee State Senate from a newly configured district centering on the historically black section of North Nashville. He was the first African American senator elected in the state of Tennessee. From this base, he became highly influential in the Nashville black community and perhaps for a period its most high-profile leader. He was unrelenting in his pursuit of the liberal Democratic agenda of the era in general and the civil rights agenda in particular. As a high-profile African American legislator, he was, perhaps even more than most of his peers, a lightning rod for both criticism and praise, depending upon the observer's point of view. In the 1970s Williams won a significant legal victory that allowed the merging of the University of Tennessee-Nashville with the historically black Tennessee State University (TSU). This expedited the process of integration in the state‚Äôs system of higher education. In the late 1980s Williams began to be debilitated by the progressive effects of ALS (\\"Lou Gehrig's disease\\") and began to require the services of a chauffeur/attendant. Speculation was rife that he would not seek another Senate term in 1988; however he did so and was easily re-elected. However, this was to prove to be his final term, as he came to realize that he was no longer capable of the physical rigors that Senate service occasionally entailed and did not seek another term in 1992. He died shortly thereafter, in 1994. In honor of his unfailing devotion to the Civil Rights cause, the downtown campus of Tennessee State University (formerly the University of Tennessee at Nashville) has been named for him. Williams' son Avon N. Williams III, was an attorney like his father, but unlike him a Republican. Avon Williams III died suddenly on July 9, 2005.

Biography He served time in Attica prison during the early 1960s, where he embraced doctrines as diverse as Black Muslimism, Black nationalism, Internationalism, and finally anarchism. In 1966 Sostre opened the firstHUAC There were three, according to Police Commissioner Frank Felicetta Afro-Asian Bookstore at 1412 JeffersonFrame Up, at 10:30. The first was at 1412 and a half Jefferson Ave. A second was at 289 High in Buffalo, New York.The Alternative Community in Buffalo, 1965-76 B. Martin Sostre Bookseller Turned Black Revolutionary (1967). The Buffalonian, 2001. Retrieved July 7, 2011. For its somewhat short existence, Sostre's bookstore was a center for radical thought and education in the Buffalo ghetto. As Sostre details: Sostre was arrested at his bookstore on July 14, 1967, for \\"narcotics, riot, arson, and assault\\", charges later proven to be fabricated, part of a COINTELPRO program. He was convicted and sentenced to serve forty-one years and thirty days. Sostre became a jailhouse lawyer, regularly acting as legal counsel to other inmates and winning two landmark legal cases involving prisoner rights: Sostre v. Rockefeller and Sostre v. Otis. According to Sostre, these decisions constituted \\"a resounding defeat for the establishment who will now find it exceedingly difficult to torture with impunity the thousands of captive black (and white) political prisoners illegally held in their concentration camps.\\" In earlier legal activity, Sostre secured religious rights for Black Muslim prisoners and also eliminated (in the words of Federal Judge Constance Motley) some of the more \\"outrageously inhuman aspects of solitary confinement in some of the state prisons.\\" He was responsible for de-legitimatizing censorship of inmates' mail, invasive bodily exams, and penal solitary confinement. In December 1973 Amnesty International put Sostre on its \\"prisoner of conscience\\" list, stating: \\"We became convinced that Martin Sostre has been the victim of an international miscarriage of justice because of his political beliefs ... not for his crimes .\\" In addition to numerous defense committees in New York State, a Committee to Free Martin Sostre, made up of prominent citizens, joined in an effort to publicize Sostre's case and petition the New York Governor Hugh Carey for his release. On December 7, 1975, Russian Nobel Peace Laureate Andrei Sakharov added his name to the clemency appeal. Governor Carey granted Sostre clemency on Christmas Eve of 1975; Sostre was released from prison in February 1976. Lorenzo Kom'boa Ervin attributes his initial interest in anarchism to Sostre. In 1974 Pacific Street Films debuted a documentary film on Sostre called Frame-up! The Imprisonment of Martin Sostre. It detailed Sostre's case with extensive interviews from prison. In later life Sostre lived in Manhattan with his wife Lizabeth Sostre, his son Mark who died in his 20s and his other son Vincent.http://www.broadwaydemocrats.org/newsletters/September2015.pdf Sostre died on August 12, 2015. In November 2017, the Frank E. Merriweather Jr. Library hosted To and From 1967: A Rebellion with Martin Sostre, an event commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Black rebellion on Buffalo's eastside. The event included an installation created by local eastside artist called Reviving Sostre. The installation consisted of three bookshelves painted by the artists and placed in the lobby of the Merriweather Library, which was built on the same location one of Sostre's bookstore used to stand.

Accessed 20 March 2013 His own poetry was mostly written in English and Modernist in style but was very much influenced by Welsh poetic tradition, Welsh culture and history. To some extent there are parallels in Conran's writing with that of R. S. Thomas, but Conran can also be seen in the line of Pound, Bunting and MacDairmid. He was born in Kharghpur, Bengal, India but, because he suffered from cerebral palsy, he was brought to the UK in 1933 and largely brought up by his grandparents in Colwyn Bay, being separated from his parents by the Second War. He was educated at Colwyn Bay High School, took his degree at Bangor and other than a brief spell working at a factory in Essex, Conran spent most of his working life in Bangor, North Wales. Until 1983, he taught at the Bangor University, where he was tutor in the English Department. Academically, he took a particular interest in Welsh poetry, both in Welsh and English; also in traditional folksong and ballads. After retiring from academic life, Conran continued to develop his own poetic art, often combining dramatic presentation of his work in conjunction with visual and performance artists. Conran's first collection of original poetry was Formal Poems (1958). His numerous other collections include Stelae and Other Poems (1965), Spirit Level (1974), and Life Fund (1979). He has also written many critiques of Welsh literature, including a collection of essays entitled The Cost of Strangeness (Gomer Press, 1982). In 1967, he produced a celebrated collection of Welsh language poetry in translation, Welsh Verse (Penguin). This collection was re-published in 1982 by Poetry Wales Press with an extensive and influential introductory essay by Conran. He has also edited a collection of poetry by South Wales poet Idris Davies. He was married to Lesley Conran. His daughters are the visual artist Maia Conran and the novelist Alys Conran.

Sofaer's strong features and resonant voice complemented his many exotic character roles. Sofaer began his acting career on the London stage in 1921, but soon he was alternating between theatre productions in London and New York. In 1935 he gained widespread attention on Broadway portraying Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli in Victoria Regina.\\"Abraham Sofaer\\", Internet Broadway Database (IBDB), The Broadway League, New York, N.Y.

Among his more prominent performances were his dual role as the Judge and Surgeon in Powell and Pressburger's A Matter of Life and Death (1946) and as Saint Paul in Quo Vadis (1951). He also appeared on television from its earliest days in the late 1930s and on radio, including a small part in Dorothy L. Sayers' The Man Born to Be King. Although his film appearances diminished after the 1950s, he continued to have guest roles on dozens of major U.S. television series throughout the 1960s. He made three appearances on Perry Mason including as Sylvester Robey in the 1960 episode \\"The Case of the Crying Cherub\\" and his voice was featured in two episodes of Star Trek. Other guest appearances were in Wagon Train, Gunsmoke, The Twilight Zone, The Investigators, Daniel Boone, The Time Tunnel, Lost in Space, and The Outer Limits. He may be best remembered for his recurring role as Haji, the master of all genies, on I Dream of Jeannie and as The Swami who advises Peter Tork in the \\"Sauna\\" scene in The Monkees' 1968 film Head.

The JP1 interface allows the remote to be reprogrammed, adding new code lists and functions. Home theater hobbyists use JP1 to avoid obsolescence. Most JP1 remotes are capable of advanced functions like remapping keys and macros. Some models can be updated over the telephone to add new code lists.  JP1 Remote controls  All JP1 remotes are made by Universal Electronics, Inc. UEI sells various models under their One For All brand name, and supplies remotes to consumer electronic manufacturers such as Radio Shack, Sony, and Sky, as well as North American cable TV providers such as Comcast, Rogers, Cox, Shaw, Charter and Time Warner. On printed circuit boards the marking \\"JP1\\" is a common abbreviation of \\"Jumper 1\\", i.e. the first (and for most remotes, the only) jumper on the board. Later models are labeled \\"JP1.x\\", where \\"x\\" is 1, 2, or 3, depending on the type of processor used. Earlier JP1 circuit board designs employ an EEPROM memory chip. Later designs employ processors with flash memory.  Hardware interface  A JP1 interface cable connects a JP1 remote to a PC, enabling the PC to read and write to the remote's user memory. Schematics for cabling parallel port, serial port or USB connectors to various JP1 remote controls are freely available, and several vendors offer pre-built interface cables.  Updating JP1 Remotes via an interface  The data and software in many JP1 remote controls can be updated and extended using an interface cable connected to a PC running software such as IR, RemoteMaster, or KeyMap Master. Updates and extensions include new device code data, new IR protocols, advanced keymapping, and macros. Nicola Salmoria discovered how to add new functions by writing software \\"Extenders\\" (protocols which replace a JP1 remote's main processing loop). Extenders may depend on a particular JP1 remote's hardware capabilities. Typical extender features include longer macro length; fast command execution; nested macros; and the long key press (LKP) -- in which a key performs different actions depending on how long it is pressed.  Software  There are various software packages available. The core package at its simplest allows for the basic remote functionality to be updated via the PC. It also allows for installing new devices, protocols and extenders, though these are created separately and copied into the core package. It also permits the entire remote control's configuration to be saved as files on the PC for backup purposes or \\"cloning\\" remote controls. Programs complementary to the core package cover such functionality as creating new devices, creating new protocols, assembling the assembly languages of the processors in the remote control, and analysis of signals learned on the remote control to enable proper protocol support to be built to control new devices. In October, 2000, at remotecentral.com‚Äôs \\"General Consumer Remotes\\" forum, electronics hobbyists Dan \\"HW Hackr\\" Nelson and Rob Crowe worked out how a JP1 connector could be used to examine and modify that portion of a remote control's memory containing user configuration data and user-updated devices. The hobbyists were able to reverse engineer the layout of this memory area, then discovered how to apply updates directly. The JP1 Remotes Forum expanded on that work, and remains the foremost locus of discovery for exploiting new JP1 functionality.  Extended Function Codes (EFC)  Earlier universal remote controls used a device code/protocol number and three-digit extended function codes for programming via the remote itself, or through the JP1 interface. These sometimes enable a universal remote control to be programmed to use some extra functions which may not have been made available even on the original equipment manufacturer's remote control. In later controls, these function codes were extended to a length of five digits. There is a tool which assists in the lookup of these code sets at the JP1 group site, and additional codes can also generally be obtained from the remote control manufacturer or supplier. Older UEI Remote controls Universal Electronics Inc. also supplied a previous series of universal remote controls, typified by the European control called the 'Big Easy'. This control can operate up to four consumer devices, with protocols and code sets normally limited to TV, analogue satellite and VCR. However, some terrestrial digital receivers and DVD players are using old protocols and code sets, typically those previously used by analogue satellite receivers. This means that these old controls can still be useful. Remote controls in this product range can normally be identified by the presence of three programming eyelets in the battery compartment. The codes to reprogram these remotes can be set down in the form of an algorithm, which can be freely downloaded and used to find extended control sets. Press JP1 has been reported on by the Detroit Free Press and Nuts and Volts magazine.

His father Abraham was the chief landscape architect of Tel Aviv from the 1940s to the 1960s.Pixel-Delight Dani Karavan website; accessed 4 January 2007. At the age of 13, he began studying painting. In 1943, he studied with Marcel Janco in Tel Aviv and from 1943-49 at the Bezalel School of Art in Jerusalem. After living on a kibbutz from 1948‚Äì55, he returned to art. From 1956-57, he studied fresco technique at the Accademia delle Belle Arti in Florence and drawing at the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re in Paris. Art career Karavan made permanent installations in the form of wall reliefs in Israeli courts and research institutions. Examples of his artwork for courts are the 1966 Jerusalem City of Peace wall relief in the Knesset assembly hall and the environmental sculptures comprising 35 wall reliefs & iron sculpture made between 1962 and 1967 at the Court of Justice in Tel Aviv. For the Weizmann Institute of Science he made the From the Tree of Knowledge to the Tree of Life wall relief in 1964 and the Memorial to the Holocaust in 1972. \\"Way of Peace\\" constructed 1996-2000 between Israel and Egypt For performance groups he designed stage sets throughout the 1960s and 1970s. These included the Martha Graham Dance Company,Moving force, Haaretz; accessed 18 November 2015. the Batsheva Dance Company, and the Israel Chamber Orchestra among others. After representing Israel with his Jerusalem City of Peace sculpture at the 1976 Venice Biennale, he obtained more international commissions - including sculptures in France, Germany, Japan, South Korea, Spain, and Switzerland. One such project was a memorial entitled Passages for Walter Benjamin constructed between 1990 and 1994 in Portbou at the Spanish-French border in Catalonia where Walter Benjamin died in September 1940. Karavan's advocacy of Tel Aviv's modern international style buildings encouraged their restoration and the inscription of The White City as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Along with an exhibition about the city's architecture at the Tel Aviv Museum of Art in the mid-1980s, Karavan convinced mayor Shlomo Lahat to form a jury of international architecture and art critics to review these buildings. The value they placed on the city's town planning and design led to conservation in the 1990s and acceptance by UNESCO in 2003.Yadin Roman. ERETZ: The Book (pg. 259), ERETZ Group. January 2005. In February 2016 Karavan got commissioned by Sigmund Rolat, the founder the organization Remembrance and Future Foundation, to design the controversial monument From Those You Saved in Warsaw to commemorate Polish righteous gentiles who saved Jews during the Holocaust. Prior to commissioning Karavan, Rolat had denounced the design by Austrian architect Gabu Heindl and artist Eduard Freudmann which had won the preceding controversial monument competition. Karavan initially declined the commission after he had read an article written by Freudmann and Heindl, in which they criticize the foundation and their course of action. In April 2016 Karavan announced that he accepted the commission to build the monument, thereby sparking another furor. To this day the monument for the Polish righteous gentiles has not been built.

It is within the Armagh City and District Council area. The village is set on a hill, with St Mark‚Äôs Church of Ireland, built in 1832, at its summit. The village lies to the west of County Armagh, and is close to the neighbouring counties of County Tyrone and County Monaghan which is in the Republic of Ireland. It had a population of 253 people in the 2011 Census.  Spelling  Many people have difficulty spelling Killylea, often confusing it with the County Down village of Killyleagh. An easy way to remember is the acronym K I L L Y L E A, standing for Kathryn Is Lovely Like Yellow Leaves Every Autumn. History In 1858 Killylea railway station opened, situated on the Elm Park Road. It was opened by the Ulster Railway and became part of the Great Northern Railway in 1876, offering people the chance to travel to Belfast and Dublin. Like most rural railways in Northern Ireland, it was not to last and eventually closed in 1957. The station platforms can still be seen today from the railway bridge on the Elm Park Road. In September 1887 events on the platform of Killylea railway station made it into the British House of Commons as Alexander Blane, Nationalist MP for South Armagh asked a question relating to an attack on a train by what he described as an \\"Orange mob\\". Edward King-Harman, then Under-Secretary for Ireland, stated \\"that a party of Nationalists returning by train from a meeting at Middle- town, County Armagh, while passing Killylea Station, which is essentially an Orange district, made use of party cries\\" and that the only shot fired was from the train, concluding that \\"Nationalists appear to have been altogether responsible\\" for the events. He goes on to say that a \\"boy\\" was injured by the shot fired from the train but that he escaped with only minor injuries to his foot. From 1920 to 1954 Killylea was home to an elite private school, Elm Park Preparatory School. This was set up by Seth Smith and Willoughby Weaving to educate boys up to the age of 14. Following the outbreak of World War II, the school's population expanded dramatically because parents believed that it was safer than sending their children to England. This expansion, however, was not to last and due to a decline in numbers in the years following World War II, the school was forced to close in 1954. One of the most famous pupils to attend Elm Park school was Brian Faulkner who was to become the sixth and final Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, presiding over the prorogation of the Stormont Parliament in 1972 following the outbreak of the Troubles only a few years earlier. Faulkner attended the school from 1933 to 1935. There is still a pew in St. Mark's Church which bears the name of the school as it is where the boys sat when they attended church each Sunday. As is illustrated by the name of the pub at the top of Main Street, Killylea has always been closely associated with hunting, with the traditional Boxing Day hunt taking place in December each year. This tradition stretches back to 1838 when the Tynan and Armagh Harriers were established by Sir James Stronge. Demography 2011 Census In the 2011 Census Killylea had a population of 253 people (107 households). 2001 Census In the 2001 Census the village and some of the surrounding area including, Fellow's Hall, Aughrafin and Elm Park, had a population of 351 people. Of these, 9.1% said that they were from the Catholic community and 89.5% of the population declared that they had a 'Protestant or other' community background. Railways The Ulster Railway opened Killylea railway station on 25 May 1858. In 1876 the Ulster Railway was merged with other railway companies to form the Great Northern Railway (Ireland). The line and station were closed on 14 October 1957. Transport Killylea is situated just off the A28, Aughnacloy to Newry road. Five miles to the east, this leads to the city of Armagh, and beyond to the south-west towards Newry. To the west, the A28 leads towards Aughnacloy and, beyond, towards Omagh and Enniskillen. Further afield, Killylea is also served by the M1 motorway which can be accessed twelve miles to the north, near Dungannon or, alternatively, near Portadown which is fifteen miles to the north-east. Education Killylea Primary School caters for around 80 children between the ages of 4 and 11 from the village of Killylea and the surrounding area. An award winning Eco school it serves the local and wider community. Breakfast Club at 8am, Stay Late 2-3pm and Chatterbox 3-4pm support working parents. Check out school website www.killyleaps.com or Killylea Primary on Facebook. Nightlife Killylea is locally known as the 'village that never sleeps' and is a hive of constant activity, mainly centred on The Huntsman Inn. Other hotspots include Digby's Bar and Restaurant and Jimmy's Shebeen. Killylea proverbs \\"Once you break the head off your Orange Lily, you can't put it back on again\\". This proverb means that people should be careful not to do things that they may later regret because, very often, they cannot be undone. \\"When the crows are flying backwards, its time to bring your washing in\\" Being at the top of a hill Killylea is a windy place with large gusts being very common. Religion There are two places of worship in Killylea. At the summit of Killylea's hill is the oldest of the two churches, St. Mark's Church of Ireland. At the bottom of the hill is Killylea Methodist Church. Sport Killylea is home to a lawn bowls club who regularly compete in leagues in Armagh. Although football is a popular sport in Killylea, the village does not have its own team. A team representing the village used to compete in local leagues under the name of Killylea Swifts Football Club. Culture The Orange Order has a strong presence in the village and district with 11 lodges in the surrounding area and two in the village itself. Numerous marching bands also exist in the area. Most notable amongst these would be Cormeen Rising Sons of William Flute Band, Killylea Silver Band, the Crozier Memorial Pipe Band and Ballyrea Boyne Defenders Flute Band. Two of the largest band parades in Northern Ireland's parading calendar are hosted in Killylea. Cormeen host their parade on St. Patrick's Day every year and Ballyrea hold a Battle of the Somme commemoration parade every year on 1 July. In 2012 Cormeen's parade was, for the first time, held in Armagh City. People Although born in Belfast, one of Killylea's most famous residents was John Luke. Luke is, perhaps, most famous for painting the dome of Belfast City Hall. He moved to Killylea in 1941 in order to escape the dangers of living in Belfast during World War II and lived there until his death in 1975. Barry Close, officer in the East India Company army, was born at Elm Park, near Killylea.

When the points are interpreted as probability distributions ‚Äì notably as either values of the parameter of a parametric model or as a data set of observed values ‚Äì the resulting distance is a statistical distance. The most basic Bregman divergence is the squared Euclidean distance. Bregman divergences are similar to metrics, but satisfy neither the triangle inequality (ever) nor symmetry (in general). However, they satisfy a generalization of the Pythagorean theorem, and in information geometry the corresponding statistical manifold is interpreted as a (dually) flat manifold. This allows many techniques of optimization theory to be generalized to Bregman divergences, geometrically as generalizations of least squares. Bregman divergences are named after Lev M. Bregman, who introduced the concept in 1967.  Definition  Let F: \\\\Omega \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} be a continuously- differentiable, strictly convex function defined on a closed convex set \\\\Omega. The Bregman distance associated with F for points p, q \\\\in \\\\Omega is the difference between the value of F at point p and the value of the first- order Taylor expansion of F around point q evaluated at point p: :D_F(p, q) = F(p)-F(q)-\\\\langle abla F(q), p-q\\\\rangle.  Properties  * Non-negativity: D_F(p, q) \\\\ge 0 for all p, q. This is a consequence of the convexity of F. * Convexity:D_F(p, q) is convex in its first argument, but not necessarily in the second argument (see \\"Joint and separate convexity of the Bregman Distance\\", by H. Bauschke and J. Borwein, in D. Butnariu, Y. Censor, and S. Reich, editors, Inherently Parallel Algorithms in Feasibility and Optimization and their Applications, Elsevier 2001) * Linearity: If we think of the Bregman distance as an operator on the function F, then it is linear with respect to non-negative coefficients. In other words, for F_1, F_2 strictly convex and differentiable, and \\\\lambda \\\\ge 0, ::D_{F_1 + \\\\lambda F_2}(p, q) = D_{F_1}(p, q) + \\\\lambda D_{F_2}(p, q) * Duality: The function F has a convex conjugate F^*. The Bregman distance defined with respect to F^* has an interesting relationship to D_F(p, q) ::D_{F^*}(p^*, q^*) = D_F(q, p) :Here, p^* = abla F(p) and q^* = abla F(q) are the dual points corresponding to p and q. * Mean as minimizer: A key result about Bregman divergences is that, given a random vector, the mean vector minimizes the expected Bregman divergence from the random vector. This result generalizes the textbook result that the mean of a set minimizes total squared error to elements in the set. This result was proved for the vector case by (Banerjee et al. 2005), and extended to the case of functions/distributions by (Frigyik et al. 2008). This result is important because it further justifies using a mean as a representative of a random set, particularly in Bayesian estimation.  Examples  * Squared Euclidean distance D_F(x,y) = \\\\|x - y\\\\|^2 is the canonical example of a Bregman distance, generated by the convex function F(x) = \\\\|x\\\\|^2 * The squared Mahalanobis distance, D_F(x,y)=\\\\tfrac{1}{2}(x-y)^T Q (x-y) which is generated by the convex function F(x) = \\\\tfrac{1}{2} x^T Q x. This can be thought of as a generalization of the above squared Euclidean distance. * The generalized Kullback‚ÄìLeibler divergence ::D_F(p, q) = \\\\sum_i p(i) \\\\log \\\\frac{p(i)}{q(i)} - \\\\sum p(i) + \\\\sum q(i) :is generated by the negative entropy function ::F(p) = \\\\sum_i p(i)\\\\log p(i) * The Itakura‚ÄìSaito distance, ::D_F(p, q) = \\\\sum_i \\\\left(\\\\frac {p(i)}{q(i)} - \\\\log \\\\frac{p(i)}{q(i)} - 1 \\\\right) :is generated by the convex function ::F(p) = - \\\\sum_i \\\\log p(i)  Generalizing projective duality  A key tool in computational geometry is the idea of projective duality, which maps points to hyperplanes and vice versa, while preserving incidence and above-below relationships. There are numerous analytical forms of the projective dual: one common form maps the point p = (p_1, \\\\ldots p_d) to the hyperplane x_{d+1} = \\\\sum_1^d 2p_i x_i. This mapping can be interpreted (identifying the hyperplane with its normal) as the convex conjugate mapping that takes the point p to its dual point p^* = abla F(p), where F defines the d-dimensional paraboloid x_{d+1} = \\\\sum x_i^2. If we now replace the paraboloid by an arbitrary convex function, we obtain a different dual mapping that retains the incidence and above-below properties of the standard projective dual. This implies that natural dual concepts in computational geometry like Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations retain their meaning in distance spaces defined by an arbitrary Bregman divergence. Thus, algorithms from \\"normal\\" geometry extend directly to these spaces (Boissonnat, Nielsen and Nock, 2010)  Generalization of Bregman divergences  Bregman divergences can be interpreted as limit cases of skewed Jensen divergences (see Nielsen and Boltz, 2011). Jensen divergences can be generalized using comparative convexity, and limit cases of these skewed Jensen divergences generalizations yields generalized Bregman divergence (see Nielsen and Nock, 2017). The Bregman chord divergence is obtained by taking a chord instead of a tangent line.  Bregman divergence on other objects  Bregman divergences can also be defined between matrices, between functions, and between measures (distributions). Bregman divergences between matrices include the Stein's loss and von Neumann entropy. Bregman divergences between functions include total squared error, relative entropy, and squared bias; see the references by Frigyik et al. below for definitions and properties. Similarly Bregman divergences have also been defined over sets, through a submodular set function which is known as the discrete analog of a convex function. The submodular Bregman divergences subsume a number of discrete distance measures, like the Hamming distance, precision and recall, mutual information and some other set based distance measures (see Iyer & Bilmes, 2012) for more details and properties of the submodular Bregman.) For a list of common matrix Bregman divergences, see Table 15.1 in.\\"Matrix Information Geometry\\", R. Nock, B. Magdalou, E. Briys and F. Nielsen, pdf, from this book  Applications  In machine learning, Bregman divergences are used to calculate the bi-tempered logistic loss, performing better than the softmax function with noisy datasets.Ehsan Amid, Manfred K.

Pictured: S√£o Paulo, Brazil. Roadway noise is the collective sound energy emanating from motor vehicles. It consists chiefly of road surface, tire, engine/transmission, aerodynamic, and braking elements. Noise of rolling tires driving on pavement is found to be the biggest contributor of highway noise which increases with higher vehicle speeds. In developed and developing countries, roadway noise contributes a proportionately large share of the total societal noise pollution. In the U.S., it contributes more to environmental noise exposureSenate Public Works Committee, Noise Pollution and Abatement Act of 1972, S. Rep. No. 1160, 92nd Cong. 2nd session than any other noise source.  History  Hong Kong roadway generating noise to adjacent land uses. Roadway noise began to be measured in a widespread manner in the 1960s, as computer modeling of this phenomenon began to become meaningful. After passage of the National Environmental Policy Act and Noise Control Act,Public Law No. 92-574, 86 Stat. 1234 (1972) Noise Pollution and Abatement Act of 1972, codification amended at 42 U.S.C. 4901-4918 (1988) the demand for detailed analysis soared, and decision makers began to look to acoustical scientists for answers regarding the planning of new roadways and the design of noise mitigation. Partial bans on motor vehicles from urban areas have been shown to have minimal impacts upon reducing sound levels (as would become clear from later modeling studies); for example, the partial ban in Gothenburg, Sweden resulted in minuscule reduction of sound levels. Regulation in the EU and Japan of tire and power-train noise has only sought to reduce noise by approx 3 dB, and will only slowly take effect because a few older noisier vehicles can dominate the soundscape. Causes Speed Traffic operations noise is affected significantly by vehicle speeds, since sound energy roughly doubles for each increment of ten miles an hour in vehicle velocity; an exception to this rule occurs at very low speeds where braking and acceleration noise dominate over aerodynamic noise. Small reductions in vehicle noise occurred in the 1970s as states and provinces enforced unmuffled vehicle ordinances. The vehicle fleet noise has not changed very much over the last three decades; however, if the trend in hybrid vehicle use continues, substantial noise reduction will occur, especially in the regime of traffic flow below 35 miles per hour. Hybrid vehicles are so quiet at low speeds that they create a pedestrian safety issue when reversing or maneuvering when parking etc. (but not when travelling forward), Technical Report DOT HS 811 204 and so are typically fitted with electric vehicle warning sounds. Vehicles Trucks contribute a disproportionate amount of noise not only because of their large engines, but also the height of the diesel stack and the aerodynamic drag. Significant interior noise is usually present inside moving motor vehicles; in fact, passengers are generally not aware that these levels are high, because experience has led motorists to expect levels commonly exceeding 65 dBA. A sound level meter used in measuring noise levels. Surfaces Roadway surface types contribute to different noise levels. Of the common types of surfaces in modern cities, there is a 4 dB difference between the loudest and the softest: chip seal type and grooved roads being the loudest, and concrete surfaces without spacers being the quietest, and asphaltic surfaces being about average. Rubberized asphalt (which uses recycled old tires) is much quieter and is already widely used. Experimental Porous Elastic Road Surfaces (PERS) might cut road noise in half. PERS is made by adding ground up tires to asphalt paving material. Studies have shown that cutting longitudinal grooves in the pavement reduces noise. Tires Tire types can cause 10 dB(A) variations in noise, based on a 2001 sample of 100 commercially available tires. As of 2001, there was no correlation between grip and noise. Quieter tires may have slightly lower rolling resistance. Tire labeling for noise, grip, and rolling resistance has been widely introduced in Europe, with noisy tires being taxed. Geometry Roadway geometrics and surrounding terrain are interrelated, since the propagation of sound is sensitive to the overall geometry and must consider diffraction (bending of sound waves around obstacles), reflection, ground wave attenuation, spreading loss and refraction. A simple discussion indicates that sound will be diminished when the path of sound is blocked by terrain, or will be enhanced if the roadway is elevated so as to broadcast; however, the complexities of variable interaction are so great, that there are many exceptions to this simple argument. Wind Micrometeorology is significant in that sound waves can be refracted by wind gradients or thermoclines, effectively dismissing the effect of some noise barriers or terrain intervention. Obstacles Geometry of area structures is an important input, since the presence of buildings or walls can block sound under certain circumstances, but reflective properties can augment sound energy at other locations. Computer models At a macro level, ongoing research is required for national and worldwide responses to road noise pollution - issues include road surface choices, the regulation and taxing of noisy designs, and the ongoing inspecting of individual vehicles. At the micro level of managing particular roads, because of the complexity of the variables discussed above, it is necessary to create a computer model that can analyze sound levels in the vicinity of roadways. The first meaningful models arose in the late 1960s and early 1970s addressing the noise line source (e.g. roadway). Two of the leading research teams were BBN in Boston and ESL of Sunnyvale, California. Both of these groups developed complex mathematical models to allow the study of alternate roadway designs, traffic operations and noise mitigation strategies in an arbitrary setting. Later model alterations have come into widespread use among state departments of transportation and city planners, but the accuracy of early models has had little change in 40 years. Generally the models trace sound ray bundles and calculate spreading loss along with ray bundle divergence (or convergence) from refractive phenomena. Diffraction is usually addressed by establishing secondary emitters at any points of topographic or anthropomorphic ‚Äúsharpness‚Äù (such as noise barriers or building surfaces). Meteorology can be addressed in a statistical manner allowing for actual wind rose and wind speed statistics (along with thermocline data). Recent models have also attempted to predict levels of local air pollution based on an analysis of specific frequencies that are related to tire and engine noise. Case studies of road design An interesting early case where two of the leading models were pitted against each other involved a proposed widening of the New Jersey Turnpike from six to twelve lanes. The BBNJohn Shadely, Acoustical analysis of the New Jersey Turnpike widening project between Raritan and East Brunswick, Bolt Beranek and Newman, 1973 and ESLC. M. Hogan and Harry Seidman, Acoustics Impacts of the proposed New Jersey Turnpike Authority widening project through East Brunswick ESL Inc. 1973 models were on opposing sides of a matter decided in New Jersey Superior Court. This case in the early 1970s was one of the first U.S. examples of acoustical scientists playing a role in the design of a major highway. The models allowed the court to understand the effects of roadway geometry (width in this case), vehicle speeds, proposed noise barriers, residential setback and pavement types. The outcome was a compromise that involved substantial mitigation of noise pollution impacts. Another early case involved the proposed extension of Interstate 66 through Arlington, Virginia. The plaintiff, Arlington Coalition on Transportation sued the Virginia Department of Transportation on the grounds of air quality, noise and neighborhood disruption. To analyze roadway noise, the ESL model was used by the plaintiff, who won this case partially due to the credibility of the computer model. The matter was revisited a decade later and a greatly reduced highway design with transit element and extensive noise mitigation was agreed to. Later cases have occurred in every state, both in contentious actions and in routine highway planning and design. The public as well as governmental agencies have become aware of the value of acoustical science to provide useful insights to the roadway design process. Worldwide perspective A noise barrier in Melbourne, AustraliaEven without regulation, there are strong individual economic pressures for quieter vehicles, because owners and employers see quieter vehicles as more luxurious and less stressful. The tighter regulatory requirements of the EU and Japan encourage quieter design even in unregulated countries, because most car manufacturers aspire to international sales. On the other hand, individual owners of motorbikes, 'boom-box' cars (with very loud music systems), and 'muscle-cars' may prefer their vehicle to be louder (at least at idling or low speeds), and such noise (often from modified exhaust systems) can only be controlled by on-going inspection and sanctions. Several studies have concluded that reducing traffic noise pollution is low-cost or cost-effective. Such studies include consideration of the reduced value of noise-affected real-estate, the costs of supporting a dispersed population 'trying to get away from all the noise', and the increased healthcare costs statistically attributable to a noisier environment. European technology began to emulate the United States treatment of roadway noise by the 1980s, although the national requirements of noise studies generally remain less stringent than the U.S. In developing countries, noise pollution from motor vehicles represents a significant impact, but technologies are not as advanced as in Western nations. For example, a recent paper from Iran illustrates a level of technology that the United States encountered in the 1960s. The European Union has recently proposed a set of vehicle tire requirements, similar to those introduced in the U.S. in the 1970s. In Mumbai, India, excessive honking and road noise is seen as a significant nuisance. The local police launched an experimental program in 2020 to link the time-length of red lights to an ambient noise sensor, increasing red light times if ambient noise from traffic exceeds limits. This acts as a deterrent to use of the horn.

He is also the co-promoter of the Houston, Texas-based promotion Latino Wrestling Entertainment (LWE). Professional wrestling career Early career Following the end of his Arena Football career, Hernandez trained under Tugboat Taylor and later under Rudy Boy Gonzalez in the Texas Wrestling Academy. He debuted in Texas All-Star Wrestling in November 1996. In 2000 and 2001 Hernandez worked for the World Wrestling Federation as a jobber, appearing on episodes of WWF Jakked and in dark matches. He also wrestled dark matches for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, and competed for Texas All Star Wrestling, Extreme Texas Wrestling and NWA Southwest. He also toured Japan on numerous occasions and worked for Ring of Honor in 2003, joining Team Texas (Texas Wrestling Academy) Don Juan, Fast Eddie led by TWA head trainer Rudy Boy Gonzalez facing the Carnage Crew of Devito, LC Loc and Masada in a violent feud that lasted several months. In 2001, Hernandez began wrestling for the National Wrestling Alliance. At the October 13, 2001 NWA Anniversary Show in St. Petersburg, Florida he defeated Kevin Northcutt to win the NWA National Heavyweight Championship.

The Elite Guard remained with TNA until September 2004, when all three wrestlers were released. Return to TNA  The Latin American Xchange (2006‚Äì2009) Hernandez (left) and Homicide after a TNA event In March 2006, he re-signed a new contract with TNA. He returned on the March 31, 2006 episode of TNA Xplosion as the newest member of the heel stable The Latin American Xchange (LAX), teaming with Homicide and being managed by Konnan. On the August 24, 2006 episode of TNA Impact!, Hernandez and Homicide defeated A.J. Styles and Christopher Daniels in a Border Brawl for the NWA World Tag Team Championship. Styles and Daniels regained the title from Hernandez and Homicide in an Ultimate X match on September 24, 2006 at No Surrender, but Hernandez and Homicide won the title back on October 22, 2006 at Bound for Glory inside the Six Sides of Steel. After winning the title back, they engaged in a feud with America's Most Wanted, defeating them in a match at Genesis and then a flag match at Turning Point. Their next rivalry involved Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray), and, after winning three consecutive matches at Final Resolution (by disqualification), Against All Odds (in a Little Italy Street fight) and Destination X (in a Ghetto Brawl), lost the NWA tag-team championships to Team 3D at Lockdown in an Electrified Cage match, when Homicide was pinned. When Konnan left TNA in the summer of 2007, both Hernandez and Homicide turned face and at Bound for Glory defeated Senshi and Elix Skipper of Triple X in an Ultimate X match to get back in the tag team title picture. They would receive their shot at the TNA World Tag Team Championship on the November 1 episode of Impact!, but were defeated by the defending champions A.J. Styles and Tomko. Bound for Glory in 2008 In 2008 LAX got another title shot by beating The Rock 'n Rave Infection (Jimmy Rave and Lance Rock) and The Motor City Machine Guns (Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin) at Destination X and cashed it in during a three-way match on the April 17 episode of Impact! against the Tag Team Champions A.J. Styles and Tomko and the team that ended up winning the match, Eric Young/Super Eric and Kaz. The controversial ending of this match led to the title being vacated and being put up for grabs in a tournament. At Sacrifice, LAX, with their new manager Hector Guerrero in their corner, won the vacant TNA World Tag Team Championship, after defeating Team 3D in the finals of the \\"Deuces Wild Tournament\\". LAX lost the title at Hard Justice to Beer Money, Inc. (James Storm and Robert Roode). At the second Final Resolution pay-per-view of 2008, both Hernandez and Homicide each captured a briefcase from the \\"Feast or Fired\\" match which contained a shot at the TNA World Heavyweight Championship for Hernandez and a shot at the TNA X Division Championship for Homicide. On a January 15 episode of TNA Impact, Hernandez cashed in his \\"Feast or Fired\\" World Title shot against Sting, and won by disqualification when The Main Event Mafia interfered, which meant that he did not win the title. However, executive shareholder Mick Foley ruled that because of the interference Hernandez would receive another TNA Title Shot in the future. On the April 30, episode of Impact!, Hernandez was attacked by the debuting British Invasion faction of Brutus Magnus, Doug Williams and Rob Terry, to allow him time off to recover from a legitimate neck surgery. On the July 23 episode of Impact! Hernandez returned to aid Homicide, who was being attacked by Samoa Joe and Taz. A week later, on July 30, he defeated Joe in his return match with a top rope splash. At Hard Justice Hernandez regained his \\"Feast or Fired\\" briefcase from the British Invasion by defeating Rob Terry in nine seconds. On the September 10 episode of Impact!, Homicide turned heel by betraying Hernandez and joining World Elite, thus signaling the official end of the Latin American Xchange. At No Surrender Hernandez cashed in his \\"Feast or Fired\\" briefcase, but was unable to win the World Heavyweight Championship in the 5-way main event match after World Elite leader Eric Young interfered and took him out of the match. At Bound for Glory, Hernandez was unsuccessful in capturing the TNA Legends Championship in a three-way match, involving champion Kevin Nash and Eric Young, after Young turned on Nash and captured the title. Teaming and feuding with Matt Morgan (2010‚Äì2011) Hernandez posing in 2010 Since then Hernandez teamed up with Matt Morgan and D'Angelo Dinero and moved on to feuding with Rhino and Team 3D, who accused TNA of favoring the younger talent of the company. At Turning Point Rhino and Team 3D defeated Morgan, Hernandez and Dinero in a street fight. At Final Resolution Morgan, Hernandez, Dinero and Suicide defeated Neal, Team 3D and Rhino in an eight-man elimination tag team match. On the January 4, 2010, live, three-hour, Monday night episode of Impact! Hernandez and Morgan defeated Dr. Stevie and Raven to become the number one contenders to the TNA World Tag Team Champions British Invasion. At Genesis Hernandez and Morgan defeated the British Invasion to win the TNA World Tag Team Championship. At Against All Odds as part of the 8 Card Stud Tournament Hernandez and Morgan were forced to face each other in the first round. Morgan defeated Hernandez by taking advantage of his injured shoulder and pinning him, while grabbing a hold of his trunks. At Destination X Hernandez and Morgan retained the Tag Team Title in a match against Beer Money despite plenty of miscommunication between the two champions. After the match Morgan nailed Hernandez with the Carbon Footprint. The following day on Impact! Morgan defeated Hernandez via referee stoppage after sandwiching his head between his boot and the ring post. After the match Homicide came out to check on his former partner, who was being helped by medics. TNA later reported on Hernandez's kayfabe injuries, claiming that he had suffered a herniated disc and cervical damage to his neck in the assault and will be out of action indefinitely. The neck injury storyline was created so Hernandez could work in Mexico for three months. With Hernandez scheduled to miss months of action, Morgan declared himself the sole World Tag Team Champion on the April 5 episode of Impact! and TNA went along with this and no longer recognized Hernandez as a champion. Hernandez's return to TNA was hinted at on the June 3 episode of Impact!, when Matt Morgan was distracted by somebody in the crowd which cost him a four-way match with Samoa Joe, Sting and the winner of the match, TNA World Heavyweight Champion Rob Van Dam. The camera's immediately showed what was distracting Morgan, but nobody could clearly see who it was, although Taz and Mike Tenay believed it to be Hernandez. The following week, Hernandez made his official return by attacking Morgan, leading to a match between the two at Slammiversary VIII. The match at Slammiversary VIII ended in Hernandez being disqualified for assaulting the referee, when he was being reprimanded for going too violently after Morgan. The following month at Victory Road Hernandez defeated Morgan in a Steel Cage match to end the feud. In November it was reported that Hernandez had turned down TNA's request for him to return to the promotion from his stint in Mexico. Mexican America (2011‚Äì2012) Mexican America making their entrance in June 2011 Hernandez returned to TNA from his stint in Mexico at the February 1, 2011, tapings of the February 10 episode of Impact!. He made his return as a heel, when he was hired by Eric Bischoff to \\"hurt a few people\\" for his Immortal stable. Hernandez then re‚Äìignited his feud with the now‚Äìface Matt Morgan by costing him the TNA World Heavyweight Championship in a match against Mr. Anderson. On February 13 at Against All Odds Hernandez explained the change in his attitude by claiming that in the United States he was treated like a second class citizen, while in Mexico he was treated like a star. On the following episode of Impact!, Hernandez aligned himself with Sarita and Rosita. On the March 3 episode of Impact! Hernandez was defeated by Morgan via disqualification. On March 13 at Victory Road, Hernandez defeated Morgan in a First Blood match, after using fake blood on him, following a run‚Äìin from a planted fan. On the following episode of Impact!, the alliance of Hernandez, Sarita and Rosita was named Mexican America. The three of them were then defeated in a six-person street fight by Morgan, Angelina Love and Winter. After the match, the \\"fan\\", who had interfered in the match at Victory Road, once again entered the ring and attacked Morgan. On the March 24 episode of Impact!, he was officially presented as the newest member of Mexican America and named Anarquia. According to Hernandez, the original plan was to find a partner in Mexico, but TNA decided to include Anarquia as his tag team partner. On April 17 at Lockdown, Morgan defeated Hernandez in a steel cage match to win the feud. After defeating Ink Inc. (Jesse Neal and Shannon Moore) at Sacrifice and the team of Alex Shelley and TNA World Tag Team Champion James Storm on the June 9 episode of Impact Wrestling, Hernandez and Anarquia began demanding a tag team title shot, claiming that they were held back because of their race. On the July 14 episode of Impact Wrestling, Hernandez and Anarquia defeated The British Invasion (Douglas Williams and Magnus), with help from Rosita, to become the number one contenders to the TNA World Tag Team Championship. Hernandez and Anarquia received their shot at the TNA World Tag Team Championship on August 7 at Hardcore Justice, but were defeated by the defending champions, Beer Money, Inc. Two days later, at the tapings of the August 18 episode of Impact Wrestling, Hernandez and Anarquia defeated Beer Money, Inc. in a rematch, following interference from the \\"Mexican Heavyweight Champion\\" Jeff Jarrett, to win the TNA World Tag Team Championship. On September 11 at No Surrender, Hernandez and Anarquia successfully defended the title against D'Angelo Dinero and Devon, following interference from Rosita and Sarita. Later that month, Mexican America began feuding with Ink Inc., stemming from their match at Sacrifice in May, where Hernandez had legitimately injured Jesse Neal. On October 16, during the Bound for Glory Preshow, Mexican America successfully defended the TNA World Tag Team Championship against Ink Inc. The following month at Turning Point, Anarquia, Hernandez and Sarita defeated Ink Inc.'s Jesse Neal, Shannon Moore and Toxxin in a six-person tag team match to retain the TNA World Tag Team Championship. On the following episode of Impact Wrestling, Hernandez and Anarquia lost the TNA World Tag Team Championship to Crimson and Matt Morgan. On the following episode of Impact Wrestling, Hernandez and Arnaquia failed to regain the title in a rematch. After spending three months off television, Hernandez returned on the March 22, 2012, episode of Impact Wrestling, when he and Anarquia unsuccessfully challenged Magnus and Samoa Joe for the TNA World Tag Team Championship. In April, Anarquia was released from his TNA contract, thus ending his partnership with Hernandez. According to Hernandez, TNA wanted to create a more stereotypical stable, but Hernandez refused to use Mexican jargon, so TNA gave the promos to Anarquia. Hernandez said Mexican America was the worst part of his career and the stable was doomed from the beginning. Teaming with Chavo Guerrero (2012‚Äì2014) Chavo Guerrero as TNA World Tag Team Champions Following Anarquia's departure, Hernandez remained inactive, before returning on June 10 at Slammiversary, which took place in his home state of Texas, defeating Kid Kash in a singles match. On the following episode of Impact Wrestling, Hernandez unsuccessfully challenged Devon for the TNA Television Championship. On June 28, Hernandez confirmed that he had signed a one-year contract extension with TNA. On the July 26 episode of Impact Wrestling, Hernandez aligned himself with the debuting Chavo Guerrero by saving him from Gunner and Kid Kash. On August 12 at Hardcore Justice, Hernandez and Guerrero defeated Gunner and Kash in a tag team match. On the September 6 episode of Impact Wrestling, Hernandez and Guerrero, after being hand-picked by Hulk Hogan as the number one contenders, unsuccessfully challenged Christopher Daniels and Kazarian for the TNA World Tag Team Championship. On October 14 at Bound for Glory, Hernandez and Guerrero defeated Daniels and Kazarian, and A.J. Styles and Kurt Angle in a three-way match to become the new TNA World Tag Team Champions. Hernandez and Guerrero made their first title defense on November 11 at Turning Point, defeating Daniels and Kazarian in rematch to retain their titles. On December 9 at Final Resolution, Hernandez and Guerrero retained the World Tag Team Championship against Joey Ryan and Matt Morgan via disqualification. Hernandez and Guerrero then defeated Ryan and Morgan again on January 13, 2013, at Genesis, to retain their titles. On January 25, at the tapings of the January 31 episode of Impact Wrestling in Manchester, England, Hernandez and Guerrero lost the TNA World Tag Team Championship to Austin Aries and Bobby Roode, ending their reign at 103 days. Hernandez and Guerrero received their rematch for the titles on March 10 at Lockdown, but were again defeated by Aries and Roode in a three-way match, also involving Bad Influence (Christopher Daniels and Kazarian). On following episode of Impact Wrestling, Hernandez and Guerrero were set for another shot at the titles, but the two were ambushed by the Aces & Eights before the match could start. The title match took place the following week, where Hernandez and Guerrero failed again to regain the TNA World Tag Team Championship, following interference from Daniels and Kazarian. On the next episode of Impact Wrestling, Hernandez and Guerrero defeated Daniels and Kazarian to earn another shot at the TNA World Tag Team Championship. Hernandez and Guerrero received their title shot on the April 11 episode of Impact Wrestling, where they defeated Aries and Roode in a Two-out- of-Three Falls match, with the added stipulation that they would have to break up if they lost, to regain the TNA World Tag Team Championship. On the April 25 episode of Impact Wrestling, Hernandez and Guerrero successfully defended their titles against Aries and Roode in rematch after an inadvertent interference from Christopher Daniels and Kazarian. On June 2 at Slammiversary XI, Hernandez and Guerrero lost the TNA World Tag Team Championship to Gunner and James Storm in a fatal four-way elimination match, also involving Austin Aries and Bobby Roode and Bad Influence. On the following episode of Impact Wrestling, Hernandez defeated Guerrero to qualify for the 2013 Bound for Glory Series. On the July 4 episode of Impact Wrestling, Hernandez defeated Jay Bradley after an interference from Guerrero via pinfall to earn seven points in the tournament. Their alliance ended on December 19, when Guerrero was fired, and he has been inactive since. On May 12, 2014, Hernandez was fired from TNA. According to Hernandez, TNA never notified him of his release and he noticed it via internet. Lucha Libre AAA World Wide (2006; 2010) Debut (2006) Hernandez made his debut for Mexican promotion Lucha Libre AAA World Wide (AAA) on August 12, 2006, at Guerra de Titanes, appearing as a member of the rudo (heel) stable La Legi√≥n Extranjera (The Foreign Legion) in a six-man tag team match, where he, Elix Skipper and Headhunter A were defeated by El Alebrije, La Parka and Octag√≥n via disqualification. Return; La Legi√≥n Extranjera (2010) In early 2010 TNA restarted their working relationship with AAA in order to send Hernandez to the company for an extended stay to gain exposure in front of the Mexican audience and make him a bigger star. Hernandez returned to the company on March 12, 2010, at Rey de Reyes, entering the Rey de Reyes tournament as a surprise competitor and defeating El Elegido, Crazy Boy and Kenzo Suzuki in the semifinal four-way elimination match to make his way to the finals.

In the Rey de Reyes final three-way elimination match Hernandez was the first man eliminated at the hands of Marco Corleone. Despite his elimination, Hernandez stayed at ringside and in the end cost Corleone the match against Legi√≥n member Chessman. Hernandez then began portraying an anti-Mexican character, refusing to speak or even acknowledge he could understand Spanish and doing his interviews through an interpreter. On June 6 at Tripleman√≠a XVIII Hernandez and fellow Legi√≥n members Alex Koslov and Chessman represented referee Hijo del Tirantes in a six-man tag team steel cage match, where they defeated Heavy Metal, Octag√≥n and Pimpinela Escarlata, representing referee Pierro, with the hair of the referees on the line.

Skybus Airlines. February 7, 2006. Retrieved on May 20, 2009. It operated as an ultra low-cost carrier modeled after the European airline Ryanair, and aimed to be the least expensive airline in the United States. The business model was heavily reliant on flying routes where other airlines did not have direct flights, as Ryanair did in Europe, thus keeping competition to a minimum, and on flying into secondary airports, rather than heavily trafficked ones. The airline also sold advertising space on the interior and exterior of its aircraft, as well as selling merchandise on board. Skybus applied for operating approval on January 1, 2005, received approval to operate on March 15, 2006, and FAA certification on May 10, 2007. It had been granted a waiver to begin ticket sales on April 24, 2007; Skybus' first passenger flights out of Columbus began on May 22, 2007. Less than a year later, Skybus announced on April 4, 2008, that it would cease operations as of April 5, citing the lagging economy and rising fuel costs as causes. History A Skybus Airlines Airbus A319 jet at Port Columbus International Airport Taking advantage of America West Airlines pulling down its Columbus, Ohio, hub, its founder, John Weikle, started raising capital to start the airline in that city. Two years later, the Skybus board hired Bill Diffenderffer as its CEO. Diffenderffer's prior airline experience was as in- house counsel for Eastern Airlines and CEO of Continental Airlines System One Reservations. At the time Skybus began operations it was the most heavily capitalized (funded) airline in US history. Its founder, John Weikle, resigned one day after Skybus began its first passenger flights. On April 24, 2007, Skybus Airlines announced their initial set of eight destinations, all of which originated from their hub at Port Columbus International Airport in Columbus. At first, Skybus operated a strict point-to-point service, not booking flights between destination cities that were not Columbus, but the company later announced it would begin flying direct flights from its Portsmouth, NH, destination to two locations in Florida. In addition, prices of tickets and details on extra fees were announced the same day. Service between Port Columbus and the other eight destinations began on May 22, and the airline also announced its intention to expand rapidly. The expansion plans were not envisioned in the original business plan, and, in some instances, it expanded to cities that management did not choose on the basis of computer models used with its initial destination cities (Chattanooga, TN, for example). As part of its business model, Skybus favored smaller, cheaper airports near major markets. To serve Boston, for example, Skybus chose Portsmouth (New Hampshire) International Airport. Skybus marketed itself as an ultra-low-cost carrier, selling ten seats on each flight for $10. The low fares came with a reduction of frills. There were charges for virtually everything else (see Skybus business model), including checked baggage charges, which were later implemented by other carriers such as Delta, Northwest and United. On July 24, 2007, the U.S. Department of Transportation granted Skybus the right to fly international flights to Canc√∫n, Mexico and Nassau, Bahamas. Two months later, the airline announced that it would begin daily service from Portsmouth to St. Augustine and Fort Myers, Florida, served by the Charlotte County Airport in Punta Gorda in December 2007. The airline made news during the Christmas 2007 travel season, when it encountered problems with two of its seven planes, resulting in the cancellation of about 25% of its scheduled service over a two-day period. As a result of not having de-icing contracts in place in advance of winter 2007‚Äì08, Skybus was forced to take significant delays and incurred thousands of dollars in additional de- icing costs. On March 24, 2008, Skybus announced that chief executive Bill Diffenderffer had resigned to return to his previous occupation as an author. Destinations As of Friday, April 4, 2008, its last day of operation, Skybus provided service to 17 destinations throughout the continental United States: From Columbus (Port Columbus International Airport): * Burbank (Bob Hope Airport) * Chattanooga (Chattanooga Metropolitan Airport) * Chicago (Gary/Chicago International Airport) * Springfield (Westover Metropolitan Airport) * Fort Lauderdale (Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport) * Gulfport/Biloxi (Gulfport-Biloxi International Airport) * Kansas City (Kansas City International Airport) * Milwaukee (General Mitchell International Airport) * Newburgh (Stewart International Airport) * Oakland (Oakland International Airport) * Greensboro/High Point (Piedmont Triad International Airport) * Portsmouth (Pease International Airport) * Punta Gorda (Charlotte County Airport) * Richmond (Richmond International Airport) * St. Augustine (Northeast Florida Regional Airport) * Wilmington (Wilmington-Philadelphia Regional Airport) From Greensboro/High Point (Piedmont Triad International Airport): * Burbank (Bob Hope Airport) * Chicago (Gary/Chicago International Airport) * Chicopee (Westover Metropolitan Airport) * Columbus (Port Columbus International Airport) * Fort Lauderdale (Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport) * Gulfport/Biloxi (Gulfport-Biloxi International Airport) * Newburgh (Stewart International Airport) * Portsmouth (Pease International Airport) * Punta Gorda (Charlotte County Airport) * St. Augustine (Northeast Florida Regional Airport) * Wilmington (Wilmington- Philadelphia Regional Airport) Timeline Skybus conducted its inaugural flight on May 22, 2007, when the airline began flights from the Port Columbus, OH base. The first service that did not have a Columbus end point began December 17, 2007, when Skybus began flights between Portsmouth and St. Augustine as well as Punta Gorda, Florida. On October 16, 2007, Skybus announced it was eliminating service to San Diego and Bellingham, and cutting one flight a day to Burbank. The cuts were made due to rising fuel costs as it was more cost effective to use the current fleet on shorter and more profitable runs. At the same time, Skybus said it would add a second daily flight to Greensboro, North Carolina, which was now its second focus city, and a third seasonal daily flight to Punta Gorda, Florida. On October 22, 2007, Skybus announced the opening of a new hub at Piedmont Triad International Airport in Greensboro, North Carolina. On January 8. 2008, Service began in New York (Stewart International Airport/Newburgh, NY), On February 6, 2008, Skybus announced that it would end service to the West Coast effective in June, except for a single daily nonstop to Burbank. On March 8, 2008, Skybus landed its first flight at Wilmington-Philadelphia Regional Airport, south of Wilmington, Delaware, a less congested alternative to Philadelphia International Airport. Many travelers in the Philadelphia area preferred the smaller airport without the congestion issues of Philadelphia International Airport. Skybus announced on March 19, 2008, that \\"previously announced service between Columbus and Niagara Falls, NY, [before it even started], as well as a previously announced second daily flight between Columbus and Milwaukee, will not begin.\\" Also announced was all service to/from Chattanooga, TN, would end on April 14, 2008, along with a cut from two to one daily flight from Greensboro, NC, and Wilmington, DE, and elimination of the Greensboro, NC, and Gulfport-Biloxi, MS, flight. On April 4, 2008, Skybus announced the cessation of all flights effective with the last scheduled departure of the day. Service was set to begin on June 1, 2008, between Boston (Portsmouth, NH), Springfield, MA, (Chicopee, MA), Punta Gorda, FL, St. Augustine, FL, and Richmond, VA. Business model Chattanooga and Columbus on I-75 Attempting to emulate Ryanair's business model and Southwest's people-friendly attitude (often considered at odds in comparisons of the two airlines), Skybus had committed itself to be the least expensive airline in the industry with a projected CASM 28% lower than Southwest. To achieve this, Skybus planned to utilize multiple measures designed to increase revenue and decrease costs, many of which are now used by Spirit Airlines. Fares Advertised fares to all of the former target cities began at US$10 one-way; the price increased as more tickets were sold for that flight. Advertisements suggest that ten seats on each flight were sold at the promotional $10 fare. Other fares promoted by Skybus included a $20.08 fare sale (plus fees and taxes) to some of the airline's less popular destinations, to celebrate the New Year. Ticket prices for the remaining fares were expected to be around half the price of other airlines. These fares did not include taxes and other airport fees, however, which add about $10 to a one-way ticket. All fees included, the cheapest round-trip ticket for one adult would have cost approximately $40. Additional charges Skybus charged extra fees for almost everything other than the ticket itself. This is common among European low-cost carriers, but was almost unheard of at the time among major US carriers. Carry-on baggage (one bag plus one personal item) was free, but checked bags incurred an additional charge. The first two bags less than fifty pounds were $10 each online or $12 each at the counter, with each additional bag after two incurring a charge of $50 per bag. Overweight baggage, those weighing over fifty but under seventy-five pounds, was charged an extra $25, and all bags over seventy-five pounds were not accepted.Many other airlines in the United States have since followed the trend of charging for checked luggage, with some notable exceptions such as Southwest and jetBlue. Skybus did not through-check luggage onto connecting flights. Customers connecting on Skybus flights in Columbus were required to collect any checked luggage, then re-check it in Columbus for the second flight. Even though Skybus did not through-check luggage, delayed luggage was a continuing problem for its outsourced ground crews. Seating was first-come, first-served. Passengers paid an extra $10 per person per direction for priority seating, which allowed a passenger to board right after passengers with disabilities. On board, everything from food and drinks to pillows had an additional charge; once purchased, items did not need to be returned. In order to maximize revenue from these fees, Skybus attempted to strictly enforce its no outside food and drink policy. The airline required passengers dispose of food and drink before boarding the plane. Exceptions included baby formula or baby food, special food for those with a medical condition such as diabetes or severe food allergies, or those with dietary restrictions (Kosher, Halal, etc.). Cost reduction In an effort to keep maintenance and operating costs to a minimum, most equipment purchased was uniform. This covered the full range of equipment, from engines, to electrical components, to personnel gear. Because of this, Skybus planned on paying significantly less on employee training and for equipment service. Another major method of cost reduction was to utilize secondary airports, which are generally less congested and charge less to lease space though they may be farther from the advertised destination. To save even more money at the airport, passengers boarded directly from the apron instead of using the jetway, saving both loading/unloading time as well as operating costs. Finally, ticket sales were entirely online. This not only saved on employee costs, but completely eliminated the need for a reservations call center. Employee wages Uniform wings of Skybus Flight Attendants with the butterfly/SB logo.Flight attendants were paid $9 per flight hour, and were not paid a per diem. While this was considerably lower than competing airlines' wages, flight attendants also received 10% of all sales made during the flight, splitting all commissions evenly among all flight attendants on board. Starting pilot wages were also well below average in terms of hourly rate, starting at $65,000 annually for Captains, and $30,000 for First Officers as a minimum guarantee. The average captain's earnings were about $90,000 vs $120,000 per year for a theoretical first year Captain at airlines like United Airlines (there is no first year pay at United) but in the case of Skybus this included a significant stock options and profit share package unique in the airline industry. Additionally unusual for Skybus flight crew was that there were very few if any overnight trips thus giving the crew far fewer hours away from home (known as TAFB or time away from base) and higher crew utilization rates for more efficient work schedules. Typical Skybus pilot workdays were 8‚Äì10 hours long (FAA maximum is 16 hours), which was lower than the industry average of 12‚Äì14 hours. Typical pilot work months were 14‚Äì15 days with no overnights. The average pilot in the US has a work month of 16‚Äì17 days, and the average airline pilot wage is approximately $135,000 averaged between first officer and captain pay. Skybus was one of the few 100% non- union airlines in the United States at the time of its shutdown (among mainline airlines, only JetBlue Airways was 100% non-union at the time, but its pilots are now represented by ALPA). However, it was facing a union organizing campaign from its pilots, who had collected enough signatures to hold a union referendum. The pilots were seeking to join Local 747 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, based in Houston, Texas. Because of the number of signatures collected, it was presumed that the campaign would be successful. The election would have most likely occurred sometime in April 2008. Successful unionization could have severely undermined Skybus's below- market compensation philosophy and laid the framework for union activity among other Skybus employee groups. (Note that there is precedent for unionized pilots with most other employee groups remaining non-union, as is the case at Delta Air Lines.) Ancillary revenue While cutting costs was a high priority for Skybus, revenue was their primary focus. Skybus aircraft were outfitted as flying gift shops, selling soda, food, perfumes, handbags, jewelry, watches, clothing, and toiletries. Customers could purchase these items duty-free on board the aircraft. Seen in this photo is a flight attendant during the gift sales portion of a flight. Advertisements could also be seen throughout the cabin and exterior. This could include overhead bins, carpet, tray tables, and full-body exterior advertisements (see below). The price for interior advertisements was not released, though a company who purchased a full-body advertisement could also buy all interior advertisements for a small increase in price. A complete list of where advertisements were to be placed was not released. Shutdown and bankruptcy Soon after the departures of several top managers, on April 4, 2008, Skybus announced they were shutting down all flight operations. The airline also said it would seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. A statement on its website regarding the shutdown said that \\"Skybus struggled to overcome the combination of rising jet fuel costs and a slowing economic environment. These two issues proved to be insurmountable for a new carrier.\\" Skybus was the fourth United States-based airline to shut down or announce future plans to shut down the week of March 31, 2008, following Aloha Airlines' passenger operations, ATA Airlines and charter airline Champion Air. At the time of the shutdown, Skybus employed about 450 people, mostly in the Columbus, Ohio, area. Almost all were immediately laid off. Passengers were also left stranded before they could complete their round trip flights. Port Columbus did not face harsh losses from the airline's shutdown, because the vacant space allowed existing airlines at Port Columbus to expand and add more service. With the addition of a nonstop flight from Columbus to Los Angeles operated by Delta Air Lines, Columbus now had non-stop flights to all of the major airline hubs in the United States. Their vacancy also made room for AirTran Airways. Fleet On October 26, 2006, Skybus announced a deal with the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus to buy 65 of its Airbus A319 aircraft. The order carried an estimated retail price of $3.7 billion, though the actual price Skybus would have paid had not been announced. Additionally, the aircraft were going to come with a 12-year maintenance agreement that was new for Airbus and Skybus was the launch customer for this service plan which helped them manage maintenance costs. Additionally, the aircraft would have been equipped with the latest in EFB (electronic flight bags) and HUD (heads up display) technology, as well as TCAS II terrain and traffic avoidance technology which is integrated in with an EGPWS technology box that protects from terrain collision. Skybus planned to lease aircraft of the same type until the new aircraft were to begin delivery in late 2008. On February 14, 2007, Skybus announced they had chosen the CFM56-5B engine built by CFM International to power the 65 A319 aircraft on order from Airbus. The actual price Skybus would have paid for the engines was not disclosed, but the list price for the order is estimated at over $750 million. As of April 2008, the Skybus Airlines fleet consisted of 13 Airbus A319 aircraft (out of a total order of 63), 12 received in December 2007 and one in March 2008, two of which were leased from Virgin America.Skybus Fleet Detail The average age of the fleet was 4.3 years.Skybus Fleet Age Livery and advertising Original images of a livery design described by some as \\"psychedelic\\" emerged on the internet, but since then the all orange design displaying the butterfly logo on the tail made its appearance on the Columbus tarmac. The butterfly logo incorporates the letters \\"SB\\" for Skybus. This design was not the standard livery for all Skybus aircraft, however, as its airplanes were available as \\"branded airplanes\\" to any company that paid $500,000 per year for this. A branded airplane featured a full-body advertisement along the fuselage, with the tail and engines of the plane remaining in the Skybus paint scheme. The first sponsored aircraft, aircraft N522VA leased from Virgin America, promoted the theme \\"Nationwide is on Your Side\\" Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company. It was created by an airplane media company, SkyBrand, based in Seattle. Skybus had also had some self-advertising on the orange tails of its white planes that read, \\"Skybus. $10 Fares ... Only Birds Fly Cheaper.\\" The company's standard font was Frutiger, itself created for the travel industry in 1974 for Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, France. The first leased aircraft for Skybus that came from Virgin America, had 144 seats on board, and flew with three flight attendants. Flight attendant uniforms were also used as a means of advertising. The uniforms for both male and female flight attendants consisted of black shoes, black casual dress pants with black long sleeve T-shirts. The front and back of the T-shirts would advertise a Skybus focus city, along with an advertising slogan specific to that city or a generic Skybus ad phrase. Flight attendants purchased their own uniforms and were allowed to choose and wear the T-shirt style of their choice. Captain and First Officer uniforms did not have advertising and were of traditional airline style (olive green shirts with epaulettes and black ties). Criticisms Skybus hubs (CMH and GSO) did not provide connection opportunities for passengers. Skybus highly discouraged connections; as such, passengers wishing to interchange at hubs would have to move bags between flights (on their own) as bags could not be checked on a multi-segment itinerary.Skybus - Where We Fly Startup incentives In an effort to attract the airline to the city, as well as support its growth early on, the city of Columbus, along with the Columbus Regional Airport Authority, had offered incentives totaling over $57 million. These incentives included a twelve-year tax credit, promised airport improvements, business loans, and marketing support. Most of the incentives were performance-based, which required Skybus to create 1000 jobs and complete other milestones to receive the incentives. Incentives such as airport improvements, however, were already completed. When Skybus began operations, they took advantage of $11 million of improvements to their gates in Concourse B at Port Columbus. Financing Skybus was financed by numerous high-profile companies nationwide and locally. As of April 2, 2007, Skybus had raised an estimated $160 million in startup capital which includes $72.7 million in their second round of fund raising. That was among the largest amounts of start-up funding in the history of airlines. By comparison, JetBlue Airways, which began operations in 1999, raised $130 million prior to starting ($157 million adjusted for inflation). Investors Skybus Airlines' startup finances were provided by a number of large investors. These included Fidelity Investments (12.6% ownership), Morgan Stanley (6.4%), Nationwide Mutual Capital (5%), and Tiger Management (4.1%). Smaller investors included: Huntington Capital Investment Co., Wolfe Enterprises (former owner of The Columbus Dispatch, WBNS-TV, and WTHR-TV), and Battelle Services Co. Inc. Financial performance Skybus reported a loss of $16 million during its first three months of operation. A Skybus spokesman said that these results were \\"in line\\" with expectations for an airline startup. During that period, Skybus planes were 79% full, placing the airline sixteenth highest among 96 reporting airlines. Passenger yield for the quarter was 5.08 cents/mile, compared with Southwest's 12.50 cents/mile and the 13.00-cent/mile average among major national carriers.

It is located on a major Warsaw-Gda≈Ñsk rail line and serves as a junction, with an additional connection to Sierpc. In the past, the name of the town was spelled in different forms: Nasilzco, Nosidlsk, Nosylsk, Nosydlsk, Nosielsk, Nosselia, Nosidlsko, Nasidlsko, Nosilsko, Nasilsko, Nasylsco. The Slavic gord of Nosidlsk was first mentioned in 1065, in the so-called Mogilno Falsification of King Boles≈Çaw II the Generous for the Benedictine Abbey at Mogilno. As the document stated, the gord of Nosidlsk was an important center of defence, trade and administration. In 1155, a document issued for Duke Boleslaw Kedzierzawy confirmed the existence of the gord at Nasielsk, stating that Nowa Wies near Nasielsk was granted to the abbey of Czerwi≈Ñsk nad Wis≈ÇƒÖ. In 1257, Duke of Siemowit I of Masovia granted one-third of Nasielsk to the Czerwinsk Abbey. By the late 13th century, Nasielsk emerged as the seat of a castellany. First document that confirms this fact was issued in 1297, with the notice of ‚Äûcomes Thomas castellanus de Nosylk‚Äù. On November 11, 1386, Janusz I of Warsaw granted the remaining part of the town of Nasielsk (civitas Nostra Nosielsko) to knight Jakusz of Radzanow (Prawdzic coat of arms). Jakusz, who came to be known as Jakusz Bialy of Nasielsk, became the castellan of Nasielsk, and the town remained the property of his family until 1647. The coat of arms of Nasielsk is based on the Prawdzic symbol. The town with its wooden church of Saint Adalbert of Prague burned in 1440, and five years later, a new brick church was erected. Nasielsk for centuries remained in private hands of the Nosielski and Wessel families. In mid-18th century, first synagogue was built, and in 1795, following the third partition of Poland, Nasielsk was incorporated into the Kingdom of Prussia, where it remained until 1815, when it was incorporated into Russian-controlled Congress Poland. Until 1866, Nasielsk was a private town. In 1877, a rail line from Warsaw to Gda≈Ñsk via Nasielsk was completed. In 1918, Nasielsk returned to Poland, and during the Polish-Soviet War, in 1920, Polish forces clashed here against the advancing Red Army. In 1924, the town became a rail junction after completion of a line to Torun. The first official inventory of important buildings in Poland, A General View of the Nature of Ancient Monuments in the Kingdom of Poland, led by Kazimierz Stronczynski from 1844‚Äì55, describes the Nasielsk Synagogue as one of Poland's architecturally notable buildings.Heaven's Gates; Wooden synagogues in the Territories of the Former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, maria and Kazimierz Piechotka, Wydawnictwo Krupski i S-ka, Warsaw, 2004, p. 174 In 2009, Glenn Kurtz stumbled upon a home video shot by his family that included three minutes of footage in Nasielsk shot in 1938.

Ridley taught languages at the Australian College. Career Ridley was ordained in the Scots Church by Lang in 1850, the following year he was appointed to Dungog, New South Wales. In 1853 he began an itinerant ministry in the New England region. This was extended in 1855 to include Moreton Bay where he formed the Moreton Bay Aborigines Friends' Society in February.

The organization works with caf√©s, restaurants, bars, stores, community organizations, and individuals to provide free Internet access in public spaces. As of April 2010, the network had over 140,000 registered users (1,000+ users daily) and over 212 live hotspots.√éle Sans Fil Web site In 2016, the organization changed it operating name to Zone Access Public Montr√©al https://zapwifipublic.ca √éle Sans Fil's mission is to use technology to bring people together and foster a sense of community. In pursuit of that goal, √éle Sans Fil experimented in using hotspots to promote interaction between users, display new media art, and provide geographically and community-relevant information. The group was volunteer-based until 2010. In addition to the deployment of these hotspots, a group of developers inside √éle Sans Fil lead the development of the captive portal suite WiFiDog. This open source software was originally conceived for √éle Sans Fil's internal use, but gained international recognition. More than 30 community wireless networks outside Montreal used the WifiDog solution: New York, London, Berlin, Vancouver, Toronto, Quebec City, Sherbrooke, Paris, Brest and Marseille.  Technical projects  WiFiDog The WiFiDog project is an open source, embeddable captive portal solution. It uses the physical limitations of wi-fi as an advantage to encourage hyper-local social interactions through location-based content and location-based services. Some of the content shown to users is in the form of location-specific images via Flickr. Users can send pictures to the portal pages of specific ISF hotspots by using the appropriate tag; WiFiDog will grab them via Flickr's API and present them on the portal page to subsequent users. Another source of dynamic, interactive locative content is the use of any RSS feeds, from either the owner or other local sources.

Later definitions give other locations, all relatively near this point. It performed meteorological observations from 14 to 26 December 1958. The Pole of Inaccessibility has the world's coldest year- round average temperature of . It is from the South Pole, and approximately from Sovetskaya. The surface elevation is . It was reached on 14 December 1958 by an 18-man traversing party of the 3rd Soviet Antarctic Expedition. Its WMO ID is 89550. History Equipment and personnel were delivered by an Antarctic tractor convoy operated by the 3rd Soviet Antarctic Expedition. The station had a hut for four people, a radio shack, and an electrical hut. These buildings had been constructed on the tractors used during the traverse, serving as accommodation. Next to the hut, an airstrip was cleared and a Li-2 aircraft landed there on 18 December 1958. The outpost was equipped with a diesel power generator and a transmitter. On 26 December the outpost was vacated indefinitely. Four researchers were airlifted out, and the remaining 14 members of the party returned with the tractors. The station was deemed to be too far from other research stations to allow safe permanent operation, so it was left to be used for future short-term visits only. The 8th Soviet Antarctic Expedition visited the site on 1 February 1964 and left five days later. The American Queen Maud Land Traverse reached the Pole of Inaccessibility from Amundsen‚ÄìScott South Pole Station on 27 January 1965. The crew were flown out by a C130 on 1 February. On 15 December 1965 a new American crew arrived by C130 to make observations, refurbish the snow cats, and continue the Queen Maud Land Traverse, zig-zagging to the newly installed Plateau Station, where they arrived on 29 January 1966. The 12th Soviet Antarctic Expedition visited the site in 1967. On 19 January 2007, the British Team N2i reached the Pole of Inaccessibility using specially-designed foil kites. On 27 December 2011, during the Antarctica Legacy Crossing, Sebastian Copeland, and partner Eric McNair-Landry, reached the Pole of Inaccessibility by foot and kite ski from the Novolazarevskaya station, on their way to completing the first partial east-west transcontinental crossing of Antarctica of over . Historic site The station building is surmounted by a bust of Vladimir Lenin facing Moscow. As of 2007, it is almost entirely buried by snow, with little more than the bust visible. Following a proposal by Russia to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting, the buried building and emergent bust, along with a plaque commemorating the conquest of the Pole of Inaccessibility by Soviet Antarctic explorers in 1958, has been designated a Historic Site or Monument (HSM 4).

It is a small fish seldom exceeding in length. It is typically found in areas with moderate to swift currents and a water depth of over , in the main channels of free- flowing rivers with a rock, cobble or boulder base and aquatic plants. It has been federally listed as a threatened species since April 22, 1992, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has classified its conservation status as being \\"vulnerable\\". Description The fish is between 1.6 and 2.9 inches long with brownish red and amber dorsolateral stripes. Unlike other members of the Hadropterus subgenus, its back is a pale to dusky color. It has a white belly on which a series of square lateral and dorsal blotches can be seen. These blotches are separated by a pale or gold-colored stripe. Distribution and habitat This fish is endemic to the Cahaba River system in central Alabama and the Coosa River system in Georgia and Alabama. There are two disjunct populations of goldline darters in the Alabama River Basin in addition to the population in the Mobile Basin. One of these groups occurs in the middle Cahaba River system, while the other is found in the Coosawattee River system, which is a tributary of the Coosa River. This species prefers to live in areas with moderate to swift current and a water depth of over 2 feet in the main channels of free-flowing rivers. These areas where it is most common have a bottom of bedrock, cobble, or small boulders and contain patches of water willow or other river weed. As in other Hadropterus subgenus members, the goldline darter spawns beginning in March and continues spawning through May or June. Status The goldline darter is threatened due to water quality degradation on the Cahaba River. Strip mining activities, urbanization, and sewage pollution have exterminated populations. The building of reservoirs has also led to the fragmentation and isolation of some populations of goldline darters. Attempts to raise the population of the goldline darter will focus on habitat preservation and water quality improvement. The main decrease in population density is in the Little Cahaba River population. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has classified its conservation status as being \\"vulnerable\\" because of the relatively small population of this fish and the ongoing habitat degradation.

It is a dark satire on superhero sidekicks, influenced partly by the publicity stunt in which readers voted to kill off Batman's sidekick Jason Todd,\\"A Death in the Family,\\" Batman #426-429 (1988). but also built on other long-standing rumors and undercurrents in the history of the superhero genre, prominently commercialism, homosexuality, pedophilia, violence, and the fascist tendencies inherent in superheroes.  Publication history  Brat Pack was released as a limited series in 1990‚Äì1991.  Plot  The series opens with the villainous Dr Blasphemy calling in to a radio show where the local residents of Slumburg, Pennsylvania (the setting of the story) are venting about their dislike for the teenage super-hero sidekick, Chippy. The pink leather clad sidekick of the gay super-hero, Midnight Mink, is widely reviled, which leads to Dr. Blasphemy challenging the host of the radio program to hold a call-in radio poll. The goal being that if more people vote for Chippy and his fellow super-hero sidekicks to die, then Dr. Blasphemy will carry out the will of the people and murder them. Most of the general public call in to vote for the murder of the sidekicks, unaware of the result of their action. Once the poll closes, Dr Blasphemy thanks the callers and announces he will carry out their will that evening. While Blasphemy is holding court on the radiowaves, Chippy is meeting with a local priest with whom he talks about the cruelty of the adult heroes that he and his friends work for. Leaving the confessional chamber, a young altar boy named Cody notices the teen hero leave and realizes that his priest knows the heroes. Father Dunn ignores Cody's request to meet Chippy, stating that being a teenage sidekick is a taxing job. That evening, Chippy meets up with his fellow sidekicks (Kid Vicious, Luna, and Wild Boy); all of which take turns bullying the young hero for being a 'sissy'. However, their torment of Chippy is interrupted by the arrival of Dr. Blasphemy. As he taunts the heroes, there is a sudden explosion, killing three of the heroes and horribly disfiguring Chippy (who is protected by an accelerated healing power given to him by Midnight Mink). Horribly maimed, Chippy opts to go into hiding as he proclaims himself free from Midnight Mink and the life of a sidekick. Midnight Mink, the racist Judge Jury, the misandrist Moon Mistress, and the drug addict King Rad meet to discuss the deaths of their sidekicks. The four heroes (known collectively as Black October) have merchandised themselves out to various corporations for profit; however their contracts state that they must have teen sidekicks. They confront Father Dunn, ordering him to procure four youths from the local community for the four to take on as the new Chippy, Luna, Kid Vicious, and Wild Boy. After they leave, Cody appears having heard everything and offers himself up to become the new Chippy. The series then focuses on the new Luna, Wild Boy, and Kid Vicious as well as Cody's transition into becoming a super-hero: Luna II is a spoiled, sweet, teenage girl named Shannon who refuses to have sex with her fellow male classmates, is heavily involved in her local church group, and dotes on her single father. Moon Maiden murders her father and arranges to have her adopted by Moon Maiden. Kid Vicious II is a lonely rich kid named Beau raised by a widow, who spends her time traveling the globe with her much younger boyfriend. Beau spends his time alone, with only his family's Asian housekeeper and her daughter, to keep him company. Judge Jury murders Beau's mother and frames her boyfriend for the crime, then forces Kid Vicious (who he tortures in order to break him mentally, while pumping him full of steroids and other drugs that cause him to become violent and aggressive 24-7) to murder his housekeeper's daughter when he realizes that he has feelings for the girl. Wild Boy II is a Hispanic skateboarder named Karlo, whose parents run a successful local grocery store. Unlike the other members of Black October, King Rad simply allows a fire caused by arsonists to go unchecked, killing Wild Boy II's parents and siblings. Karlo is then made to indulge in harsh drugs against his will by King Rad, but ultimately starts using them willingly after a search and rescue mission goes wrong and Karlo is unable to save a young boy from being torn in two. Cody is raised by a single father, who spends most of his days drunk and forcing Cody to fend for himself for food and basic needs. Midnight Mink murders Cody's father in a staged robbery, then \\"adopts\\" Cody. As the series progress, the four heroes systematically break their young charges mentally and physically through extensive physical abuse (Judge Jury), drug addiction (King Rad), and psychological manipulation (Midnight Mink and Moon Mistress). While they do so, they discuss the missing fifth member of the group: True-Man. A being of pure energy, True-Man personally trained Moon Maiden as a hero, was best friends and lovers with Midnight Mink, and who brought the wildcards Judge Jury and King Rad into his orbit to stop a war between the two and True-Man and his friends, allowing them to become the sole protectors of Slumburg. True-Man eventually became jaded with humans and ultimately left the Earth. However, before he left, True-Man discovered that Midnight Mink had contracted AIDS and performed a blood transfusion. The transfusion cured Midnight Mink of AIDS, but also granted him (and anyone who is exposed to his blood in transfusion form) super-human endurance to pain and injury, along with the ability (over time) to heal from any wounds inflicted upon them. Cody proves himself a worthy replacement as Chippy after several battles, allowing Midnight Mink performs a blood transfusion granting him the same power. By the end, all four teen heroes are irrevocably broken mentally, just like their predecessors: Beau is now a steroid addicted bully, Karlo a drug addict, Shannon has completely jaded and promiscuous; meanwhile Cody finds himself repeatedly visiting Father Dunn. He reveals that all three of his fellow sidekicks hate and despise him due to the fact that Midnight Mink does not overtly abuse and mock Cody like the other heroes do. He further states that he has become irrevocably disaffected with the life of a hero and the sociopathic tendencies of Midnight Mink and the other members of Black October. Midnight Mink interrupts the confession, as he reveals the full control he has over Cody by having him leave the priest to return home with him. Midnight Mink then tells Father Dunn that the only reason he doesn't kill him/allows his various sidekicks to vent their anguish and suffering to him, is that Midnight Mink gets off on knowing that the priest can do nothing to save his sidekicks or any of the sidekicks, from the hell that is their lives as super-heroes. Original Ending The original five issue mini-series had the following ending that is only available in Brat Pack #5. After leaving Father Dunn's confessional, the opening scene from the first issue plays out again with the other sidekicks attacking Cody. However, there is a loud scream from the church as the heroes storm in and find Dr Blasphemy waiting for them with a large coffin: he orders the heroes to open it (after flinging the dying remains of the original Chippy at Cody) and reveals it full of contracts and legal documents for merchandise, comics, tv shows, and movies. Dr Blasphemy reveals that the kids are pawns of corporate America: they require the psychopathic heroes have teen sidekicks to make them appear wholesome and fatherly/motherly to the masses and then reveals that their partners murdered their parents so they could ensure that they did not have to split the money from the merchandise deals. Chippy inspects one document and discovers a clause in it: when the sidekicks becomes of legal age (18), the heroes must then start splitting the proceeds from their lucrative merchandise/media deals with their sidekicks. Chippy then realizes that Midnight Mink, Judge Jury, King Rad, and Moon Mistress were responsible for the bomb blast that killed their sidekicks, all of whom were on the verge of turning 18 years old. However, before they can do anything a bomb is dropped on the church by a plane flown by Black October. Storming the bombed out remains the church, Father Dunn (about to hang himself in the bell tower), finds a bag and a note telling him to open it. Inside, he finds Dr Blasphemy's hood which he puts on as he hangs himself. The Black October go to the bell tower and find him hanging, but quickly realize that he's doesn't have the full costume of their enemy. Suddenly the electrical storm reaches its peak as True-Man returns at long last. The hero murders his former friends and teammates by trapping them under the church bell which he melts on top of them, as King Rad tries desperately to reach out to his faithful butler (who also served as a servant for Black October) for help. Final shot shows the church in ruins as the radio station from the start of the story, declaring a state of emergency and everyone to stay indoors until the lightning storm is over. Trade Paperback Ending When the series was released as a trade paperback, Veitch redid the entire ending from scratch for the series. After Midnight Mink's confrontation with Father Dunn, Cody encounters the original Chippy outside the church; his injuries too severe for his healing factor to fix, he finally dies but gives Chippy his mask before he passes. Meanwhile, after being told that Midnight Mink allows his sidekicks to confess the abuse they endure at the hands of the heroes because he knows the priest can do nothing to save the young teens from the abuse, Father Dunn pulls out a gun and shoots Mink. Chippy responds by rescuing the hero and overseeing his recovery; going so far as to perform a blood transfusion, so his own healing factor can help speed up Mink's healing process. Afterwards, the sidekicks are forced to attend a convention where they sign autographs and meet their fans. An overtly angry fan of the original Chippy mortally wounds Cody, revealing his healing factor power to the other teen sidekicks. Once he has healed up, they lure him to the alley behind the church where, like their predecessors, they take turns tormenting and brutalizing Chippy to force him to give up the secret of his healing powers. The torture is interrupted when Dr Blasphemy appears and lures the teens inside. A coffin is then presented to them, claiming to hold death and a secret. While Beau, Shannon, and Karlo all proclaim that they hope it is their mentors, Cody realizes the truth. He reveals that the coffin is a bomb and quickly disarms it before opening it up to show the explosives inside. Shannon, Karlo, and Beau realize they know their heroes have access to bomb- making equipment and realize that their mentors want to kill them, just like they killed the previous sidekicks they replaced. Bleeding from the beating, Cody grabs a nearby sacrament cup and fills it with his blood, so they can share in his healing factor. He then states the truth: the original sidekicks were murdered simply because Black October and its members could do it. Pointing out how utterly corrupt and evil they were, Cody warns that they need to either flee town or prepare for a final showdown with their mentors. At which point, from his plane, Midnight Mink drops a bomb on the church. The rest of the ending plays out as it did in the original book: Black October go into the church, where they find Father Dunn having hung himself while wearing a Dr Blasphemy mask. True-Man then appears to kill his former teammates, but due to the blood they consumed, the teen sidekicks watch with glee as they reveal that True-Man is upset with the utter corruption and evil of his former friends as he executes them for their crimes. However, before the comic ends with the shot of the ruined church and the radio calling for citizens to stay indoors, it is revealed that Dr Blasphemy was Fredo, the butler for King Rad.

Early life  Merle Hay was born on a Carroll County, Iowa farm to Harvey and Carrie Hay. He was the oldest of 3 children. In 1909, the family moved to another farm near Glidden. Before his service with the United States Army, he was a farm implement mechanic.  World War I service  Cartoon published in the November 8, 1917, issue of the Des Moines Register; Uncle Sam brings home the body. A copy of the cartoon would be placed on a monument to Hay in Glidden. When the United States entered the First World War, Hay was young enough to avoid being drafted. With his father's blessing, he voluntarily enlisted on May 9, 1917. He was among 8 men from Glidden who enlisted that day. They were first shipped to Fort Logan, Colorado, then to Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas. He was assigned to the 16th Infantry Regiment. On 26 June 1917, the regiment disembarked the troop ships in St. Nazaire, France, as part of the 1st Infantry Division. By November 1917, he was assigned to Company F along with Corporal James Bethel Gresham and Private Thomas Enright. They were posted in the trenches near the French village of Artois. In the early morning of 3 November 1917, the Imperial German Army attacked. After an hour of fighting, Hay, along with Corporal Gresham, and Private Enright were the first three casualties of the American Expeditionary Force. Two days later, on 5 Nov 1917, Enright, Gresham, and Hay were buried near the battlefield where they had died. An inscription marked their graves: \\"Here lie the first soldiers of the illustrious Republic of the United States who fell on French soil for justice and liberty.\\" Their bodies were eventually returned to their families and reburied in the United States. Hay was then re-interred in July 1921 in West Lawn Cemetery in his home town of Glidden, Iowa. The West Lawn Cemetery was later renamed the Merle Hay Memorial Cemetery. An 8-foot monument commissioned by the Iowa Legislature marks his gravesite. Shortly after Hay's death, the highway running from the west edge of Des Moines to Camp Dodge was renamed Merle Hay Road. A memorial boulder was placed along Merle Hay Road in 1923 and remains up today amidst the commercial development along the road. Merle Hay Mall in Des Moines was also named for Hay; the local Kiwanis club placed a memorial plaque near the entrance to the mall's Sears store in 1979. The first American military casualty in World War II was also an Iowa native. Andrew, Iowa, native Robert M. Losey, a military attache, was killed on April 21, 1940 during a German bombardment of Domb√•s, Norway. Captain Losey had been attempting to complete the evacuation of the American diplomatic delegation from Norway to Sweden in the wake of the German invasion. Family Hay's mother collapsed upon hearing of his death but in an interview two days after Hay's father, D. Hay, said that \\"I am proud of my boy if he has given up his life for his country.\\" He was survived by a younger brother Basil, eighteen, and a fourteen-year-old sister Opel.

The paradox arises when one considers what would happen if one attached a piece of buttered toast (butter side up) to the back of a cat, then dropped the cat from a large height. The buttered cat paradox, submitted by artist John Frazee of Kingston, New York, won a 1993 OMNI magazine competition about paradoxes. The basic premise, stating the conditions of the cat and bread and posed as a question, was presented in a routine by comic and juggler Michael Davis, appearing on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, July 22, 1988.  Thought experiments  Some people jokingly maintain that the experiment will produce an anti-gravity effect. They propose that as the cat falls towards the ground, it will slow down and start to rotate, eventually reaching a steady state of hovering a short distance from the ground while rotating at high speed as both the buttered side of the toast and the cat's feet attempt to land on the ground. In June 2003, Kimberly Miner won a Student Academy Award for her film Perpetual Motion.Available at http://www.kminer.net/2011/07/perpetual-motion/ Miner based her film on a paper written by a high-school friend that explored the potential implications of the cat and buttered toast idea.  In humor  The faux paradox has captured the imagination of science-oriented humorists. In May 1992, the Usenet Oracle Digest #441 included a question from a supplicant asking about the paradox. Testing the theory is the main theme in an episode of the comic book strip Jack B. Quick. The title character seeks to test this theory, leading to the cat hovering above the ground and the cat's wagging tail providing propulsion. The March 31, 2005, strip of the webcomic Bunny also explored the idea in the guise of a plan for a \\"Perpetual Motion MoggieToast 5k Power Generator\\", based on Sod's law. In Science Askew, Donald E. Simanek comments on this phenomenon. The idea appeared on the British panel game QI, where the idea was discussed. As well as talking about the idea, they also brought up other questions regarding the paradox. These included: *\\"Would it still work if you used margarine?\\", *\\"Would it still work if you used I Can't Believe It's Not Butter?\\", and *\\"What if the toast was covered in something that was not butter, but the cat thought it was butter?\\" (the idea being that it would act like a placebo). The paradox also appeared in the episode \\"Gravitational Anarchy\\" of the scientific podcast Radiolab. Alternate link via iTunes. Later, a humoristic explainer animation was put together by the animated production company Barq, based on an extracted audio clip from the Radiolab episode. Brazilian energy drink brand Flying Horse has released an award-winning commercial that simulates the recreation of this phenomenon, which is then used to create perpetual energy. It also appeared in a Belgian comics series called Kid Paddle where Kid tells the story to his gullible friend Horace while at the dinner table.  In reality  Cats possess the ability to turn themselves right side up in mid-air if they should fall upside-down, known as the cat righting reflex. This enables them to land on their feet if dropped from sufficient height. Toast, being an inanimate object, lacks both the ability and the desire to right itself. A study at Manchester Metropolitan University involving dropping 100 slices under laboratory conditions established that toast typically lands on the floor butter-side-down as a result of the manner in which it is typically dropped from a table, and the aerodynamic drag caused by the air pockets within the bread. The toast is typically butter-side-up when dropped. As it falls, it rotates; given the typical speed of rotation and the typical height of a table, a slice of toast that began butter-side-up on the table will land butter-side-down on the floor in 81% of cases.

A two-part episode, the first part constitutes the sixth episode of the series and the second part constitutes the seventh. They were aired separately in the United States on September 26, 2005 and October 3, 2005 consecutively. The first part of \\"Riots, Drills and the Devil\\" was written by Nick Santora and directed by Robert Mandel with the second part being written by Karyn Usher and directed by Vern Gillum. In this two-part episode, in order to keep his escape plan on schedule, protagonist Michael Scofield deliberately attempts to get his wing locked down which results in a riot in the prison, giving him supposedly enough time to drill through a wall without any worries on cell counts. Also two people who aren't meant to know about the escape plan, know about the escape plan, an inmate is ordered to kill Lincoln Burrows, Veronica and Savrinn find a lead in the case, and Dr. Sara Tancredi is trapped by some of the rioting prisoners. Plot Part 1 Since Scofield's transfer was cancelled, the woman in Montana tells Kellerman to take care of Burrows quickly. He has an informant call an inmate in Fox River to kill Lincoln. The only form of identification of the inmate is an elastic bracelet. Veronica (Robin Tunney) avoids Nick Savrinn, until she realises that he is trying to help her all along, when he hears that the anonymous phone call to arrest Lincoln came from Washington D.C. Meanwhile, Michael (Wentworth Miller) realizes that to complete a digging job inside the walls to some pipes, he needs to spend a good block of time there, which has been proving difficult as he has to keep coming back to his cell to make count. After explaining this to Sucre (Amaury Nolasco), he is told that the only time count doesn't take place is during a lockdown. Michael manages to disable the prison's air conditioning. T-Bag (Robert Knepper) returns from the infirmary, where he is given a new cell mate, Seth. Since the A/C is off, the inmates suffer in the heat, leading T-Bag to start a fight with Geary, who then initiates a lockdown while some of the prisoners are out of their cells. The prisoners riot and break into the prison cell control room, in which T-Bag opens all the cells and then finds a set of keys, giving him and the rioters access to the entire prison. When news of the riot reaches the sick bay, the prisoners there also riot. After taking out the guard, they trap Dr. Tancredi (Sarah Wayne Callies) in the adjacent room. Michael uses a tracing of a devil from his tattoo to provide the coordinates (calculated using Hooke's law, also referred in this episode as hooker's law) needed to collapse part of the wall. This is vital to his escape plan as the wall prevents the team from entering a pipe that will take them to the infirmary. Meanwhile, after Lincoln is ambushed by T-Bag and his men, he holds new CO Bob Hudson hostage, who tries to escape, but T-Bag takes him to Michael's cell, where he learns of the escape plan, and blackmails Abruzzi (Peter Stormare) into getting in on the plan. Outside, the COs plan on stopping the riot, where Pope receives a call from Governor Tancredi, who is coming to Fox River. Michael soon notices Dr. Tancredi's plight on CCTV and goes to rescue her through an air duct. Meanwhile, Charles Westmoreland stumbles upon a battered Lincoln and alerts him of the situation. A distraught Lincoln demands to know where Michael is. When Westmoreland is unable to answer, another prisoner named Turk steps forth to lead Lincoln to Michael, but it is revealed he is the inmate ordered to kill him. Part 2 Turk misleads Lincoln, by sending him into a secluded area, where he attempts to kill him. However, after the two men struggle, Lincoln pushes Turk over the edge, where he soon dies. Back in Michael's and Sucre's cell, T-Bag is keeping an eye on CO Hudson, who knows of the escape plan. Abruzzi enters the hole and helps Sucre with breaking down the wall. Sucre, a devout Roman Catholic, struggles with drilling through a depiction of the devil. Also adding to the dilemma is the fact that gas pipes lie behind the wall, and that drilling in the wrong place may cause a fatal explosion. However, together they are eventually both able to drill strategically placed holes and manages to break it down to see the pipe on the other side. Sara is still trapped in the room, where the rioters almost break through, and try to set fire to it, where Michael manages to arrive through the vents and rescues her from them. However, the rioters follow her and Michael, who try to evade them. Sara asks how Michael knows about the pipes and he replies by saying that he has had PI duties to clean up toxic mold in the pipes. Soon, Michael is able to knock out one of the leading inmates and rush to an exit. However, when they arrive, a sniper, sent by Govorner Tancredi, who is adamant to do what it takes to rescue his daughter, aims at him. Michael quickly ducks as the pursuing inmates are fired at and Sara reunites with her father. Veronica and Nick arrive in Washington D. C. and receive the address from the placed phone call, a payphone. The payphone is next to the building of the company the Vice President uses. The phone rings and Veronica answers it. The caller tells them that they are dead. In a panic, Veronica and Nick run away from the payphone. Michael returns to gen-pop and reunites with Lincoln before heavily armed SORT teams invade the prison and force the inmates back to their cells. In Michael's cell, the team discuss what to do with Hudson. Michael, Lincoln and Sucre want to keep him alive. However, as he leaves, T-Bag kills him anyway, stabbing him in the stomach and throwing him down from the second level. Later, Sara asks a colleague why PI was ordered to clean up the toxic mold. The colleague replies that PI has never done such a job, which tells Sara that Michael's story was a lie. In the end, the prison is returned to normal and Michael can continue with his escape plan. Production This episode was filmed in Chicago, Illinois and Joliet, Illinois in August 2005 where it was summer.\\"Riots, Drills and the Devil\\" commentary, Prison Break Season 1 DVD, Paul Scheuring and cast. The weather condition was reflected in the dialogue \\"hottest April on record\\", and the make-up and wardrobe of the characters. The song \\"Nine Thou\\" by Styles Of Beyond begins at the end of \\"Riots, Drills and the Devil (Part 1)\\" when Lincoln attacks T-Bag and is also used in the opening of the episode \\"Riots, Drills and the Devil (Part 2)\\". The fictional Fox News broadcast in the episode describes Fox River State Penitentiary as a \\"Level 5\\" institution. On the other hand, in the series pilot, the judge, who convicted Michael Scofield, states that Fox River is a \\"Level 1\\" facility. In the state of Illinois, \\"Level 1\\" is the highest, while levels 6-8 have the lowest level of security in terms of federal prisons.Security designation: Corrections Security Levels. Illinois Department of Corrections. However, it is more likely for the Fox River State Penitentiary be of a higher security level; this is because high security prisons in the USA are described as having, \\"highly-secured perimeters (featuring walls or reinforced fences), multiple- and single-occupant cell housing, the highest staff-to-inmate ratio, and close control of inmate movement\\", (features found in Fox River State Penitentiary), whilst low security prisons are described as having, \\"dormitory housing, a relatively low staff-to-inmate ratio, and limited or no perimeter fencing\\".. Department of Prisons: Types and General Information Cast notes In the first part of the episode, Marshall Allman (L. J. Burrows) does not make an appearance. Robert Knepper (T-Bag) returns after a two episode gap, in which his character recovers from his brutal beating in \\"Cell Test\\". The second part of this episode is the first episode in the series in which regular cast member Paul Adelstein (Agent Kellerman) does not appear. John Turk guests stars as Turk, the inmate ordered to kill Burrows. Also, making their first appearances are Matt DeCaro as CO Roy Geary, and John Heard as Frank Tancredi. Reception Reviewstream.com reviewed the second part of the episode as \\"an absolutely fantastic episode\\", calling it \\"really nerve wrecking, romantic\\", praising Michael's role in risking his plan to save Dr. Tancredi, as well as the prediction that \\"things are going to get uglier from now on, and their plan would not work\\". They also called the second part, \\"one of the best writing in television so far\\".Prison Break Season 1 Episode 7- Riots, Drills and the Devil part 2 review Both the second, and first parts were rated 10 out of 10.Prison Break Season 1 Episode 6- Riots, Drills and the Devil part 1 review As far as US ratings go, the two episodes performed better than the previous two.

It was designed as a preaching place for councilors of Jewish town hall. In the center there were bimah, surrounded by seats. Mordechai Maisel gave pieces of Torah and silver tools to the synagogue. The stucco ceiling was gothic ribbed vaulting. In 1689 it was destroyed by the Great Fire. The synagogue was reconstructed. In 1883 the synagogue was rebuilt by J. M. Wertm√ºller.

Layne & Bowler Co., 241 U.S. 257 (1916), was a United States Supreme Court case governing the scope of federal question jurisdiction.  Background  Plaintiff American Well Works Co. manufactured, sold, and held the patent to a particular type of pump, which was known to be the best on the market. The plaintiff sued defendant Layne & Bowler Co. on the grounds that defendant had maliciously libeled and slandered plaintiff's title to the pump by stating that the pump, and certain of its component parts, were infringements upon defendant's pump. Layne & Bowler had also filed lawsuits against others who used plaintiff's pump, and were threatening to sue all who used it. American Well Works filed suit in the Arkansas state court, claiming actual damages of $50,000 as well as punitive damages. Layne & Bowler removed the suit to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas on the grounds that the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over matters of patent law. The district court then dismissed the action. Plaintiff appealed directly to the United States Supreme Court. Issue Did the district court properly dismiss the matter; i.e. was federal question jurisdiction present here?  Decision  In a brief opinion, Justice Holmes wrote that this claim was based upon the allegedly defamatory actions and statements of the defendant, not any violation of the federal patent laws. The plaintiff alleged that defendant's conduct had damaged its business, and was not bringing suit to prove who had proper title to the patent. Holmes held that a suit for damages to a business caused by the defendant's allegations of patent infringement and threat to sue under the patent law was a matter of state law, and therefore the state courts had jurisdiction to hear the case. Whether or not defendant's statements about the patent were true was simply a piece of evidence to be examine by the state trial court. Thus, under the rule stated by this case, whether a suit arises under state or federal law determines whether or not federal question jurisdiction exists. It is therefore consistent with the \\"well-pleaded complaint rule\\" set forth in Louisville & Nashville Railroad Company v. Mottley, 211 U.S. 149 (1908), just eight years earlier. Justice McKenna dissented without opinion, on the grounds that he felt the case involved a direct and substantial controversy under the patent laws.

Trolleys serving this station go eastbound to Center City Philadelphia and westbound to the neighborhoods of Eastwick and Angora, as well as the Delaware County suburbs of Yeadon and Darby. The station is located adjacent to the Institute of Contemporary Art and is two blocks away from the 36th Street Portal station, which serves the Route 10 trolley. History 220px The station was opened in November 1955 by the Philadelphia Transportation Company (PTC) as part of a larger project to move portions of the elevated Market Street Line and surface trolleys underground.Puckett, John L. and Mark Frazier Lloyd. , accessed May 31, 2020. The original project to bury the elevated tracks between 23rd to 46th streets was announced by the PTC's predecessor, the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company (PRT), in the 1920s, but was delayed due to the Great Depression and World War II. The PTC's revised project also included a new tunnel for trolleys underneath the campus of the University of Pennsylvania, continuing from the original western portal at 23rd and Market streets to new portals at 36th and Ludlow streets and 40th Street and Baltimore Avenue. The station is also sometimes known as Sansom Common station, referring to a former name used by the University of Pennsylvania to market retail in the area. Station layout The station has two low-level side platforms, each capable of platforming two trolleys at a time. Fares are collected manually on board the trolley cars.

The group consists of Nancy Garcia, Carlos Giffoni and Roger Rimada. Alberto Laburu recently joined the group in 2008. Early years The group began as an improvisational performance group in 1998, but over the years has worked on creating music with greater complexity and more song-oriented composition. The first self-released 7\\", Traffican't, contained musical selections assembled from the groups very first informal improvisational session in early 1998. A subsequent 2000 CD release - entitled Blaggout - on Animal World Recordings consisted of 30 tracks and 74 minutes of assembled song ideas, sonic experimentations, fully fleshed out compositions, individual member recordings, and a mish-mash of those elements together. The original release of this was notable for the shards of broken glass that covered the cardboard CD sleeve. A full-length LP, Pagu, was released in 2002 on Public Eyesore Records and featured the group's change of direction towards a more electronic sound. Using a mixture of hardware programming gear, distorted vocals and altered keyboard sounds the group focused on a more song- oriented approach for the first time and much of this was flexed during the band's 2002 tour of Japan and its 2003 tour of the US Midwest. Both tours featured track selections from Pagu re-created onstage with great difficulty. New Monotract releases were planned for 2006 with a release entitled XPRMNTL LVRS slated for June 2006 and a Load Records release entitled Trueno Oscuro for an April 2007 release. Both records are said to be more instrument- oriented, darker sounding and percussive while still maintaining their electronic leanings. Of note is that all the Monotract members are of Hispanic origin (Giffoni is Venezuelan while Garcia and Rimada are born of Cuban parents) and it is an influence in both their lyrical and musical expressions - something of a rarity in the \\"noise\\" music community they are currently a part of.

Background Rooster Booster was a gelding whose grey coat (inherited from his dam Came Cottage) and racing style made him easily recognisable. He was the only horse of any consequence produced by the unsuccessful racehorse Riverwise. He was originally trained by his owner Norman Richard Mitchell in Dorset but had his biggest successes after he was bought by Terry Warner in 2000 and sent to the stable of Philip Hobbs at Withycombe in Somerset. Early career Rooster Booster began his racing career in a National Hunt Flat Race at Wincanton in February 1999, where he finished seventh of eighteen runners. He had six more runs for Richard Mitchell, winning just one of those in the form, a maiden hurdle at Taunton. He was then switched to the yard of Philip Hobbs and made his debut for him in April 2000, finishing 2nd behind Valiramix in a Novices' Hurdle at Chepstow. He had one more run that season, finishing third in a competitive Novice Hurdle at Punchestown. He began the 2000/01 season with little success, being pulled up at Chepstow at the beginning of November, before falling at Newbury later that month. He then improved to be placed in his next four races, including Pierse Hurdle at Leopardstown and the Imperial Cup at Sandown. His season ended when he was pulled up at Aintree in April in a Handicap Hurdle. Rooster Booster reappeared in the 2001/02 season, in a Listed Handicap Hurdle at Cheltenham, finishing fifth. He followed up that effort by finishing fifth and fourth in Handicap Hurdles at Sandown and Ascot. In his next two races, he finished second to the Martin Pipe-trained Copeland in valuable handicaps at Cheltenham and Newbury. He then gained his first victory for Philip Hobbs when coming from well off the pace to lead at the last hurdle and win the County Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival, with Copeland back in fifteenth. His trainer stepped him up to Grade I class, where he finished fourth in the Aintree Hurdle, behind Ilnamar. Champion Hurdler The following season (2002/03) proved to the most successful of Rooster Booster's career. He began with victories in Listed Hurdles at Kempton and Cheltenham, before he won the Grade 1 Bula Hurdle at odds of 11/8, coming home 2 lengths in front of Landing Light. That was followed by another victory in the Agfa Hurdle before going to Cheltenham undefeated in four races. He was sent off the 9/2 second favourite for the Champion Hurdle behind the 5/2 favourite, Rhinestone Cowboy. Rooster Booster moved up to challenge two hurdles from home, quickened into a clear lead approaching the last, and stayed on strongly up the Cheltenham hill, coming home eleven lengths clear of the second, Westender. His rider, Richard Johnson, said of the gelding, \\"he's a bit wooden-headed, but it's hard to complain when he keeps going like that. He's a jockey's dream.\\" Rooster Booster was then sent to Liverpool to contest the Aintree Hurdle in April, where he was sent off the 5/4 favourite. He led over the last but was caught in the closing stages and beaten a head by the Edward O'Grady-trained Sacundai after Johnson dropped his whip on the run to the finish. In the course of the season, the nine-year-old improved his rating from 144 to 170. The 2003/04 season saw Rooster Booster win just one race, the Champion Hurdle Trial, but he ran consistently well in top races, finishing second in four Grade I races: the Christmas Hurdle, Champion Hurdle, Aintree Hurdle, and Punchestown Champion Hurdle. Later career Rooster Booster ran in many of the same races in the following season, 2004/5, but with little success. After finishing second in the Christmas Hurdle, he finished down the field in both the Champion Hurdle and the Aintree Hurdle. He did win the Concept Hurdle at Sandown in April, before ending the season finishing fourth in the Swinton Hurdle. Rooster Booster began the 2005/06 season with victory at Huntingdon and followed that up with a run in the Greatwood Hurdle, where he finished fourteenth. Death On 20 December 2005, Rooster Booster collapsed during a routine training session in preparation for a run in the Christmas Hurdle and died from heart failure. The Independent described him as one of racing's \\"most cherished champions\\", while his regular jockey Richard Johnson said, \\"He gave great pleasure not only to myself but to the owner and to everyone connected with him\\".http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/horse_racing/4545338.stm References Category:1994 racehorse births Category:2005 racehorse deaths Category:Cheltenham Festival winners Category:Champion Hurdle winners Category:National Hunt racehorses Category:Thoroughbred family 16-c Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom ","title":"Rooster Booster (horse)"},{"id":"4491799","text":"Millionaire is a Belgian indie rock band led by Tim Vanhamel, drawing on influences from stoner rock, indie and industrial rock music.

Dallek (born May 16, 1934)www.encyclopedia.org is an American historian specializing in the presidents of the United States, including Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, and Richard Nixon. He retired as a history professor at Boston University in 2004 and previously taught at Columbia University, the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and Oxford University. He won the Bancroft Prize for his 1979 book Franklin D. Roosevelt and American Foreign Policy, 1932‚Äì1945 as well as other awards for scholarship and teaching. Personal life Born in Brooklyn, New York, Dallek is the son of Rubin (a business-machine dealer) and Esther (Fisher) Dallek. Dallek attended the University of Illinois, graduating with a B.A. in history in June 1955. He did graduate work at Columbia University, earning an M.A. in February 1957, and a Ph.D. in June 1964. While working on his Ph.D., he was a history instructor at Columbia. He married Geraldine Kronmal (a policy health analyst) on August 22, 1965. Academic career In 1964-1994 Dallek advanced from assistant to full professor of history at the Department of History at University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA). From 1966 to 1968 he was a graduate adviser. From 1972 to 1974 he served as vice chair of the department. From 1981 to 1985 he was a research associate at the Southern California Psychoanalytic Institute. In 1993 he was a visiting professor at the California Institute of Technology, and from 1994 to 1995 he was the Harold Vyvyan Harmsworth Professor of American History at Oxford University, which in 1995 awarded him an honorary M.A. Since 1996 Dallek has been a visiting professor at the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, and a professor of history at Boston University. From 2004 to 2005 he was Montgomery Fellow and a visiting professor in the history and government departments at Dartmouth College. Dallek is a member of the Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations. An Unfinished Life: John F. Kennedy, 1917-1963 In 2003, Dallek published the New York Times Bestseller An Unfinished Life: John F. Kennedy, 1917-1963, the first major biography of John F. Kennedy in almost 40 years. Based on archival resources and unprecedented access to his medical records, it revealed his secret struggle with major health problems as well as his love affairs, the backstage role of his father, his appointment of his brother Robert F. Kennedy to the office of United States Attorney General, and speculations about what the President would have done about the Vietnam War if he had lived. Nixon and Kissinger: Partners in Power In 2007 Dallek published Nixon and Kissinger: Partners in Power, which claims that they were visionaries and cynics at the same time, in an attempt to explain the ups and down of their diplomatic careers. \\"The careers of both Nixon and Kissinger reflect the extent to which great accomplishments and public wrongdoing can spring from inner lives.\\" The book was a finalist for the 2008 Pulitzer Prize in History.

It also released the compilation series The Emo Diaries. History Deep Elm Records started in New York City by John Szuch. Deep Elm's first release was the single \\"Anthemic Tune\\" by Curdlefur in 1995. Its first album was by Camber in March 1997. In 2006, Deep Elm Records signed its first UK act, Free Diamonds. By 2008, Deep Elm stopped pressing physical CDs and vinyl, effectively becoming a digital only label. The label has refused to be bought out by a larger company, and is currently located in Maui, Hawaii. Vice described Deep Elm as \\"a seminal label for the 90s/early 2000s emo scene\\".(Almost) Every Single Deep Elm Release, Ranked. Vice, February 26, 2014.  Compilation albums  Between 1997 and 2007, the label released a series of twelve compilation albums titled The Emo Diaries. The series had an open submissions policy and featured mostly acts that were unsigned at the time of the albums' releases. The Emo Diaries featured then- new and unreleased music by such acts as The Appleseed Cast, Brandtson, Further Seems Forever, Jimmy Eat World, Planes Mistaken for Stars and Samiam. It also released a compilation series called This Is Indie Rock. Deep Elm's founder, John Szuch, claims that the original name for the series was intended to be The Indie Rock Diaries, but this was ruled out when the first volume included Jimmy Eat World and Samiam, who were both signed to major record labels. The Emo Diaries was chosen because The Emotional Diaries was too long for the album cover. Despite the title, the bands featured in the series have a diversity of sounds that do not all necessarily fit into the emo style of rock music. Andy Greenwald, in his book Nothing Feels Good: Punk Rock, Teenagers, and Emo, claims that the series \\"stake[s] a claim for emo as more a shared aesthetic than a genre.\\" The label is now famous as a home for alternative post-rock bands, with acts such as Lights & Motion, Moonlit Sailor, Athletics and Dorena.

The company was founded in 1870, and is one of the oldest companies of its kind in the United States. Simmons' flagship brand is Beautyrest. In addition to operating 18 manufacturing facilities in the United States and Puerto Rico, the company licenses its products internationally. According to a Simmons press release, net sales for 2005 were $855 million, and its revenue was $1.13 billion in 2007 and $1.228 billion in 2013.Simmons Company - Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2005 Results , Official release As of 2011, Simmons ranked in third place among U.S. mattress manufacturers, with a 15.7 percent market share. In 2012, Simmons and its sister company Serta International were acquired by American private equity company Advent International.  History  Early history In 1870, Zalmon G. Simmons opened his first factory in Kenosha, Wisconsin. He started out by manufacturing wooden telegraph insulators and cheese boxes. He branched into making bedsprings after receiving a patent for a woven-wire bedspring in payment of a debt. In 1876, Simmons became the first manufacturer to mass-produce woven wire mattresses. This process helped the company produce beds faster and cheaper, and by 1889, with the introduction of spiral coil springs into woven mattresses, Simmons‚Äô mattress prices dropped from $12 to 95 cents, making mattresses more widely affordable. The business was incorporated in 1884 as the Northwestern Wire Mattress Company, adopting Simmons Manufacturing Company as its name in 1889. According to company records, by 1891 it was the largest company \\"of its kind in the world\\". National business Zalmon Simmons, Jr., who took charge of the business after his father's death in 1910, was to oversee additional growth. In 1916 Simmons began advertising nationally, initiating its first national advertising campaign with a double-spread ad in the Saturday Evening Post. By 1919 growth was fast. In response, Simmons acquired manufacturing plants in San Francisco, California; Los Angeles, California; Montreal, Quebec; Toronto, Ontario; Winnipeg, Manitoba; Vancouver, British Columbia; Elizabeth, New Jersey; Seattle, Washington; and Atlanta, Georgia. The following year, Simmons started a new sales arrangement. Instead of purchasing a mattress directly off the retail floor, customers could test the product on in-store samples, order a mattress through the retailer, and receive direct delivery within the next 24 hours from one of Simmons' 64 warehouses. This arrangement reduced the need for retailers to own and store their own product inventories. In 1923, Simmons moved its corporate headquarters to New York City. Equipment developed by Simmons in 1925 automated the process of coiling wire and inserting it into fabric sleeves, called encasements. This allowed mass production of pocketed coils, a type of coil that had been available only in very high-priced luxury mattresses. The pocketed coil is the basis for the Simmons Beautyrest mattress brand, which was introduced in 1925. Although the new manufacturing technology greatly reduced its cost, at the time of its introduction a Beautyrest mattress sold for $39.50, three to four times more than the typical price for a standard wire mattress. Simmons promoted its products aggressively with ads that included testimonials from famous people such as Eleanor Roosevelt in 1927 and Henry Ford, H.G. Wells, Thomas Edison, Guglielmo Marconi and George Bernard Shaw in 1929. Eleanor Roosevelt continued to promote the brand into the 1930s, through her radio show. Cole Porter mentioned the Beautyrest brand in the lyrics of his 1934 song \\"Anything Goes\\".Julie Creswell, Buyout Firms Profited as a Company‚Äôs Debt Soared, The New York Times, October 4, 2009 In 1940, Simmons introduced the Hide-A-Bed, a sofa that incorporates a fold-out spring and mattress that pull out to form a bed. This was to become one of the company's best known products and was manufactured until the 1980s. During World War II, Simmons' facilities were diverted to military production, making cots, parachutes, bazooka rockets and other products. By the post-war year of 1947, the company was back in the mattress business and started using advertising to associate its products with the Hollywood glamor of actresses including Dorothy Lamour and Maureen O'Hara. A research and development facility was established in Munster, Indiana, in 1957, building upon pioneering studies on human sleep behavior that Simmons had sponsored in the 1930s. In 1958, the company became the first U.S. mattress maker to produce mattresses in king and queen sizes, an innovation that was promoted as solving the \\"space battle in the bedroom\\". Era of corporate change In 1975, the Simmons corporate headquarters moved to Atlanta, Georgia. Shortly thereafter, the company research and development team also relocated to Georgia, to a building in what is today Peachtree Corners but was then an unincorporated part of Gwinnett County, near Norcross. In 1995, the company's R&D; division moved into a new home, the Simmons Institute for Technology and Education (SITE). Simmons underwent the first in a series of corporate mergers and acquisitions in 1979, when the company was acquired by Gulf+Western. Six years later, Gulf+Western sold Simmons to Wickes Corporation. Wesray Capital bought the business in 1986, and sold it to the Simmons employee stock ownership plan in 1989. Merrill Lynch Capital Partners obtained a majority interest in Simmons in 1991, and sold to Investcorp in about 1996. Fenway Partners bought the company about two years later, then sold to Thomas H. Lee Partners in 2003. In the 1990s a commercial for the Simmons Beautyrest featured a bowling ball being dropped on a Beautyrest mattress and a standard open-coil mattress to illustrate the company's claim that a person's nighttime movements are less likely to disturb a sleep partner if their mattress is a Beautyrest. The bowling ball demonstration, which was popular with Simmons dealers, consumers, and industry experts, was revived in 2006. In 2003, Fenway Partners made the Sleep Country USA chain of retail stores a part of Simmons; in 2006 Simmons sold the chain to The Sleep Train of Citrus Heights, California. The following year, the company added memory foam products to its offerings by acquiring the Comfor‚ÄìPedic line of memory foam mattresses and pillows from Comfor Products of Kent, Washington. The company suffered financially under the successive ownership of multiple private equity firms and other private investors. The private equity owners extracted $750 million in profits out of Simmons, while the company's debt increased from $164 million in 1991 to $1.3 billion in 2009. On September 25, 2009, Simmons announced a Chapter 11 restructuring plan and signed a purchase agreement with an investor group led by Ares Management and Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan. The bankruptcy court approved the deal, reducing the company's total debt from about $1 billion to $450 million. The bankruptcy did not include subsidiaries in Canada and Puerto Rico, but those units were included in the deal with Ares Management and the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan. Ares and the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan were also the owners of the Serta brand name under National Bedding Company LLC. They operated Serta and Simmons Bedding as independent entities that continued to compete with one another. On October 2, 2012, private equity firm Advent International acquired a majority interest in AOT Bedding Super Holdings (now Serta Simmons Holdings, LLC), the parent company of Simmons and Serta. Ares Management and the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan continued to own a \\"significant\\" share of company equity. At the time of the Advent acquisition, Simmons and Serta together held a 34 percent share of the U.S. mattress market. Simmons and Serta retained separate sales, marketing, research and development, and merchandising departments, and continue to remain separate. In August 2018 Simmons Bedding's parent company Serta Simmons Holdings LLC announced a merger with online retailer Tuft & Needle to increase their online presence.

Working near Amiens, he was initially critical of the claims of Jacques Boucher de Perthes who believed he had found artefacts that dated back hundreds of thousands of years to what is now called the Lower Paleolithic. In 1855 however he began to find examples of stone tools himself whilst studying the river gravels of the Somme in an effort to disprove his opponents. The tools' position within the gravel attested to their age geologically and following visits to the site of Abbeville and Saint-Acheul by the paleontologist Hugh Falconer and the geologist Joseph Prestwich the great age of the tools was accepted by the wider archaeological community.

He has composed the scores for several feature-length films, including 2014's The Fault in Our Stars. He is a member of the band Bright Eyes, and has played in Conor Oberst's Mystic Valley Band and with singer-songwriter M. Ward. Between 2016 and 2019, Walcott was the touring pianist and keyboard player for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, during their The Getaway World Tour. Walcott has also toured with the likes of the James Mercer and Danger Mouse-led group Broken Bells, Rilo Kiley, and the Glenn Miller Orchestra. In the studio, he has performed on the albums of such artists as Phoebe Bridgers, She & Him, U2, Beck, Jason Mraz, Maroon 5, and the Shins and has contributed arrangements to artists such as Mavis Staples, Angel Olsen, First Aid Kit, Jenny Lewis, Rilo Kiley, Pete Yorn, Cursive, and The Faint. Life and career Walcott was born on March 6, 1978 in Albany, New York. While he was a young child, his family moved to the Central New York village of East Homer. When Walcott was eight, his family moved to Lincoln, Nebraska. While a high school student in Lincoln, Walcott played in several Lincoln-based bands, including Kid Quarkstar, with longtime friend and future Maroon 5 guitarist James Valentine. He also met musicians Mike Mogis, A.J. Mogis, and Ted Stevens of Lincoln-based band Lullaby for the Working Class, with whom he recorded and toured. After graduating from high school in 1996, Walcott went on to attend DePaul University in Chicago. He took time off from his studies to tour both with The Glenn Miller Orchestra and Lullaby for the Working Class. After university, Walcott engaged in freelance recording, arranging, and performing work with a very wide variety of artists including the Chicago-based groups Las Guitarras de Espana, the Mighty Blue Kings, and Pinetop Seven. He was also active in the improvisational and ‚Äúexperimental‚Äù music scene, performing with the likes of David Boykin, Mike Reed, and Keefe Jackson at such places as Fred Anderson‚Äôs Velvet Lounge, the Hungry Brain, and the Green Mill, and also led his own group, the Nate Walcott Octet. While living in Chicago, both in college and after, Walcott remained connected to Nebraska, working as an arranger and player on records being produced by Mike Mogis for artists such as The Faint, Rilo Kiley, and Johnathan Rice. While still a student and collaborating with musicians in the vibrant Lincoln and Omaha music scenes, Walcott met singer-songwriter Conor Oberst of the bands Bright Eyes, Commander Venus, and Desaparecidos. Walcott joined Bright Eyes on its tour in support of 2002's album Lifted or The Story is in the Soil, Keep Your Ear to the Ground and also on most subsequent tours after the ‚ÄúLifted‚Äù tour. Walcott played on 2005's studio recordings I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning and Digital Ash in a Digital Urn and the live album Motion Sickness. In 2006, in preparation for writing and recording Bright Eyes' next album, Walcott, along with producer and guitarist Mike Mogis, was named a permanent member of the group. Cassadaga was released on April 10, 2007. Walcott co-wrote \\"Coat Check Dream Song.\\" Following a five-month tour of the United States, Walcott wrote the arrangements for the band's appearance at the Hollywood Bowl with the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra. Walcott followed up the Cassadaga tour by collaborating with Oberst (along with Nik Freitas, Taylor Hollingsworth, Macey Taylor, and Jason Boesel) on his solo efforts, 2008's Conor Oberst and 2009's Outer South. The group came to be known as the Mystic Valley Band as a nod to the location of the 2008 recording, a villa named Valle Mistico in Tepoztl√°n, Morelos, Mexico. In 2010, Walcott toured as music director and multi-instrumentalist for Broken Bells, an innovative collaboration between James Mercer and Danger Mouse. Later that year, he returned to the studio with Oberst and Mogis to record the next Bright Eyes album. The People's Key was released on February 15, 2011. Walcott co-wrote the song \\"Approximate Sunlight.\\" Highlights of his time with Bright Eyes over the years include numerous tours of North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia, and performances at such venues as New York City's Radio City Music Hall and London‚Äôs Royal Albert Hall. In recent years, Walcott has done extensive freelance recording and arranging work, including with She & Him, U2, Beck, Jenny Lewis, First Aid Kit, Rilo Kiley, the Shins, and Maroon 5. He has also maintained a busy freelance performing schedule with the likes of M. Ward, Eleni Mandell, The Living Sisters, Jonathan Wilson, Harper Simon, and Zavalaz, a new band led by Cedric Bixler-Zavala of The Mars Volta. Walcott has continued to occasionally join Conor Oberst during his recent solo performances, including his November 2013 performance at Carnegie Hall. As of 2016, Walcott is touring with the Red Hot Chili Peppers on their The Getaway World Tour, playing piano, keyboards, and trumpet. He is featured on their 2016 Live In Paris EP.

At the time of his death in 2006, Adwaita was believed to be amongst the longest-living animals in the world. He may have been from Aldabra, an atoll in the Seychelles. This anecdotal report has not been confirmed. The animal was one of four tortoises that lived at Robert Clive's estate at Barrackpore, in the northern suburbs of Kolkata. Clive was said to have received the tortoises following his victory at the Battle of Plassey in 1757, in which the British East India Company defeated the Nawab of Bengal and his French allies, thereby securing India for Britain in the long run. Adwaita was transferred to the Alipore Zoo in Calcutta in 1875 or 1876 by Carl Louis Schwendler, the founder of the zoo. Adwaita lived in his enclosure in the zoo until his death on 22 March 2006 at an estimated age of 255. Description Weighing 250 kg (551 lb), Adwaita was a solitary animal with no records of his progeny. He lived on a diet of wheat bran, carrots, lettuce, soaked gram (chickpea), bread, grass and salt. Age His shell cracked in late 2005, and a wound developed in the flesh underneath the crack. The wound became infected and eventually led to his death from liver failure on 22 March 2006. Adwaita is estimated to have been at least 150 years old at the time of his death, and some estimates suggest he may have reached 255 years. If this latter estimate can be confirmed, Adwaita will have been the oldest known tortoise of modern times, living longer than Harriet by 80 years and Tu'i Malila by 67 years.

Lat. 4922, fol. 28v.). The script down the side reads: Te redimat Soth√©r Bonifaci marchio duxque (May the Saviour redeem you Boniface, duke and margrave). Boniface III (also Boniface IV or Boniface of Canossa) (c. 985 ‚Äì 6 May 1052), son of Tedald of Canossa and the father of Matilda of Canossa, was the most powerful north Italian prince of his age. By inheritance he was count (or lord) of Brescia, Canossa, Ferrara, Florence, Lucca, Mantua, Modena, Pisa, Pistoia, Parma, Reggio, and Verona from 1007 and, by appointment, margrave of TuscanyBoniface's title (dux et marchio) has been given as duke of Lucca, or marquis of Mantua and Ferrara. from 1027 until his assassination in 1052. Early life He was the son of the Margrave Tedald and Willa of Bologna. The Lombard family's ancestral castle was Canossa and they had held Modena for several generations. They possessed a great many allodial titles and their power lay chiefly in Emilia. Boniface was probably associated with his father before the latter's death. In 1004, with the title marchio, he donated land to the abbey of Polirone, and he appears in two documents of the same year as gloriosus marchio. He kept his court at Mantua, which he transformed into a city of culture: \\"With so many magnificent spectacles and feasts that all posterity and all their contemporaries marvelled thereat.\\"Duff, 17, quoting Giacomo Ottali. Imperial politics In 1014, Boniface aided the Emperor Henry II in putting down Margrave Arduin of Ivrea, who claimed the Kingdom of Italy in opposition to Henry. His father nominated him as heir over his brothers and, in 1016, he was again fighting alongside the emperor, this time against the margrave of Turin, Ulric Manfred II. In 1020, Boniface defeated a rebellion of his brother Conrad, but the two reconciled and both were later recorded as dukes. In 1027, he supported the candidacy of Conrad II of Germany for the thrones of Italy and the Holy Roman Empire against the other claimants: William V of Aquitaine, Robert II of France, or Hugh Magnus. When Boniface's Lombard enemies tried to incite his brother against him, the two offered battle to them at Coviolo, near Reggio, and emerged victorious, though Conrad was killed. When Conrad II finally succeeded in entering Italy, he was met with defiance at Lucca and he deposed the reigning margrave of Tuscany, Rainier, and gave his lands and titles to Boniface. This seems to be the probable scenario, though the exact date of Boniface's assumption of the Tuscan lordship is uncertain.Duff, He is first so entitled in 1031: dux et marchio Tusciae. In 1032, he was serenissimus dux et marchio. Boniface subdued Pavia and Parma, in revolt against the emperor, and the emperor made a treaty with Boniface, an act which has been construed as recognition of Boniface's independence. In 1032, he was at war with the rebel Count Odo II of Blois. In early summer 1036, Boniface attended the emperor at Nijmegen.Wolfram, Herwig. Conrad II, 990-1039, Penn State Press, 2010 In 1037, he helped put down a revolt against the Emperor Conrad, and in February 1038, hosted the Emperor, while the latter journeyed to Florence. In 1043, for services rendered the Empire, he received the Duchy of Spoleto and Camerino. He also acquired more land in Parma and Piacenza, and his chief residence in this time was at Mantua. In 1039, Boniface travelled to Miroalto to aid Henry against the rebellious Odo of Blois. While he was returning, he destroyed the grain fields of the region and the enraged populace retaliated and stole some of his retainers' horses. It was during his blood reprisal that Boniface made his most famous recorded statement. Preparing to hack off the ears and nose of a young man, Boniface was confronted by the youth's mother, who begged him be spared and promised him her son's weigh in silver. Boniface replied to his offer that he \\"was no merchant, but a soldier,\\" adding: \\"Absit ut hostes ferro capti redimantur argento\\". (Far be it that what was captured by steel should be redeemed with silver.) In 1046, Henry III entered Italy to be crowned emperor. Boniface received the emperor and the empress, Agnes of Poitou, with honour and munificence on their arrival at Piacenza and his governor did so at Mantua on their return journey. The relationship between Boniface and Henry, however, soon deteriorated in 1047. Papal intrigue With the death of Pope Clement II, Pope Benedict IX, with the covert support of Boniface, was re- instated, This was a choice not universally approved, and by Christmas 1047, a delegation of Romans met with the emperor to ask him to name a successor. The following month, Henry called a council. Although the Romans wanted Halinard of Lyons, the Bavarian Bishop Poppo of Brixen was chosen, taking the name of Damasus II. On his way to Rome, Damasus met Boniface, who informed him that Benedict had already been chosen by the people; and declined to accompany Damasus. Damasus returned to Henry, who viewed Boniface's support of Benedict a challenge to imperial authority. He ordered Boniface to escort Damasus to Rome. Damasus was consecrated on July 17, 1048, but died less than a month later, at Palestrina, just outside Rome, probably poisoned.Stroll, Mary. Popes and Antipopes, Brill, 2011 In fact, his habit of cheating the church of land, especially the Diocese of Reggio, by offering some small farm land and an annual rent in turn for it was legendary. He rarely paid the promised rents. However, Boniface eventually joined the reform party of Leo IX and was present at the Synod of Pavia in 1049. In his later years, he kept the Abbey of Pomposa well-endowed for the sake of his soul and even confessed to simony and permitted Guido of Pomposa to flagellate him in punishment for it. Death Boniface' signature from a document of 1038, preserved in the state archives of Lucca He tried to restrict the rights of his valvassores, despite Conrad's imperial edict of 1037. It was this action against his undertenants which got him killed in 1052, during a hunting expedition. This version of Boniface's death is disputed. Some have alleged that Henry played a part in his assassination. It is also held by some that in 1044 there was an attempt made on the margrave's life at Brescia and that the conspirators fled to Verona, which Boniface subsequently sacked before expelling some Veronese conspirators from Mantua as well. One Scarpetta Carnevari apparently nursed a grudge for this act and years later, while Boniface was preparing a galley for a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, shot him with a poisoned arrow on the river Oglio, near Martino dall'Argine in the region of Spineta while on the hunt. Family Boniface's first marriage (before 1015) was to Richilda, daughter of Giselbert II, Count Palatine of Bergamo. Richilda took little part in Boniface's government and was dead by 1034, leaving him no children. In 1037, he married Beatrice, daughter of Frederick II, Duke of Upper Lorraine and Count of Bar, and niece and adoptive daughter of Empress Gisela, wife of Emperor Conrad II. They celebrated their marriage in high style, keeping court at Marengo for three months afterwards. Beatrice also had but a small role in the rule of Tuscany, but she did bear her husband three children. The eldest, Beatrice, died in 1053, shortly after Boniface. The only son, Frederick, succeeded his father, but died soon after. The youngest child was Matilda, who inherited the great patrimony from Frederick. Beatrice remarried in 1054 to Godfrey III, Duke of Lower Lorraine, who ruled until his death in 1069.

Description  Historically holders of allods are a type of sovereign. Allodial land is described as territory or a state where the holder asserted right to the land by the grace of god and the sun. For this reason they were historically equal to other princes regardless of what the size of their territory was or what title they used. This definition is confirmed by the acclaimed Jurist Hugo Grotius, the father of international law and the concept of sovereignty. \\"holders of allodial land are sovereign\\" because allodial land is by nature free, hereditary, inherited from their forefathers, sovereign and held by the grace of God. This form of ownership meant that the landowner owed no feudal duties to any other person. An allod could be inherited freely according to the usual law of the land. To begin with, the income from allodial estates was not even liable for taxes paid to any other sovereigns including the territorial princes (Landesf√ºrsten). In all of these ways, the allod differed from fiefs, which were mere tenures held by feudatories (Lehnsm√§nner) or their vassals (Vasallen). Overall suzerainty in a fief remained with the feudal lord, who could require of his vassals certain services which varied from vassal to vassal. Also, the ownership of a fief was split so that a lord had dominium directum and his tenant in fee had dominium utile (German nutzbares Eigentum). By contrast, an allodiary had a full freehold interest ‚Äî or dominium plenum (volles Eigentum) ‚Äî in his allod. This was also reflected in the contemporaneous synonym for an allod, Erbe und Eigen (loosely \\"inheritance and ownership\\"). Borough properties were usually allodial in nature. Likewise, ecclesiastical institutions (e.g. abbeys and cathedrals) owned allodial estates. The conversion of a fief into a freehold ‚Äî a familiar process in the 19th century ‚Äî is called enfranchisement. Ownership of enfranchised fiefs continued to be limited, however, to the rights of the former feudatories. Only the overall suzerainty of the feudal lord over the estate was repealed, while the rights of the feudatory remained unaffected. Such an enfranchised fief became analogous to entailment (Familienfideikommiss); often it was explicitly converted into a fee tail (Fideikommissgut).  Emergence and historical development  The allod as a form of ownership was established among the Germanic tribes and peoples, before it became part of the feudal system. Land that was originally held in common by the whole community was transferred to a single individual. The freemen of the Germanic peoples divided or drew lots for the land in the countries they had conquered and taken possession of. This gave rise to the essential character of the allodial estate: a freely-owned property allocated and guaranteed by the will of the whole people or by the people's law (Volksgesetz). The landowner was independent of any superiors and free of any property right restrictions. In many regions only allodiaries were counted as freemen, i.e., those who enjoyed all common, public rights and duties. They served as territorial assemblymen (Landesgemeinde). The allodiaries of the early Middle Ages are one of the groups out of which the nobility sprang over time. They saw themselves as equal partners of the territorial lords, because they participated alongside them as members of the territorial assembly and were not their vassals. The freedoms associated with allodial estates (tax exemption, hunting rights, etc.) were only exercised by the nobility in most states - even if, after 1500, they had to subordinate themselves increasingly to the territorial princes (as part of the establishment of statehood) - who remained, politically and economically, the most influential group of landowners. The term ‚Äòallod‚Äô occurs only in the Franconian region and those territories influenced legally by Frankish tribes. After the Battle of Hastings in 1066, there were no more allods in England at all (though Lundy was later deemed to not be in England) and, in France, allodial estates existed mainly in the south. In Germany, the allodial estates were mainly those owned by the nobility in the south. There were many lords who founded their powerful position on extensive allodial estates in the eastern Alpine countries and the lands of the Bohemian Crown. The king as lord paramount never exercised lordship over the whole Empire. An allodial estate could also be created when a lord renounced his rights in favour of his vassal. Deforested land was considered allodial by the princes. Conversely, free territorial lords were sometimes punished by the Emperor by converting their allodial land into fiefs. The differences between the two forms of medieval ownership - the fief and the allod - diminished over time. Firstly, vassals were no longer required to render services from the 17th century at the latest, and vassals‚Äô rights of inheritance became much stronger in the early modern period, and, secondly, the territorial princes were able to force freemen in the 16th century to make regular tax payments. In the 19th century, feudal law was finally gradually abolished in most European countries largely due to the Napoleonic wars and the influence of the Napoleonic Code. It fully integrated the ius commune system of ownership as a full right in rem. While in France the r√©gime f√©odal was ended in 1789 by the stroke of the pen under the Revolutionary legislature, in Germany it was not until the mid-20th century that feudal law was formally abolished in 1947 by Allied Control Council law. In most of Scotland, the feudal system was abolished in the early 21st century; allodial tenure still exists in Shetland and Orkney.

Roughly long, it is the primary watercourse running through Rutland County and Addison County. The mouth of the river flows into Lake Champlain. Settled by indigenous peoples at least 10-11,000 years ago, the river was an important economic region for indigenous people before European settlement. The river became an important economic region for settlers, who took advantage of the river for agriculture and industry through the 18th and 19th centuries. History Before European settlement, the river valley was settled by native peoples and was called by early settlers as the \\"Indian road\\" because of its importance to navigating Abenaki, Algonquin and Iroquois settlements in the region. Archeological evidence suggest both war parties and trading happened between communities on the river. Otter Creek (or \\"Kill\\") was known to the French as \\"La Rivi√®re aux Loutres\\", whence the English name. On April 1, 1690, Capt. Abraham Schuyler was commissioned by the city of Albany to take a party up the Otter Creek about and there to keep watch and engage any Native Americans. This would correspond today to the City of Vergennes. In 1731, the French began construction of a fort at Crown Point to be known as Fort Frederic. Before commencing, they founded a new settlement called Addison. With increase awareness of the valley's fertile land, the 18th century saw increased settlement by white settlers. Vergennes, situated on the first falls, upstream from the outlet of Otter Creek, was one of the first industrial hubs on the river, with a sawmill erected in 1764. In 1814, a fleet was hastily, but effectively, assembled here by American forces at Vergennes, to participate in the Battle of Plattsburg. During the 1800s, communities began to harness the rivers' quick waters for industrial purposes creating hydropower facilities in Rutland, Proctor, Brandon, Middlebury, Weybridge, and Vergennes. During flooding caused by Tropical Storm Irene (2011), Otter Creek flooded in downtown Rutland causing millions of dollars in damage. Geography The Otter Creek in Weybridge just north of the Lemon Fair River Otter Creek rises in the Green Mountain National Forest on the western slopes of Mt. Tabor in the town of Peru in Bennington County, and flows southwesterly into the town of Dorset towards East Dorset, thence veering northward into Emerald Lake. Thence it runs northward passing through the towns of Danby, Wallingford, Clarendon, and Rutland town, the city of Rutland, and the towns of Proctor, Pittsford, and Brandon, all in Rutland County. On entering Addison County, it generally forms the boundary between various towns. It next passes through Middlebury, Weybridge and Vergennes and eventually empties into Lake Champlain at Ferrisburgh. The stretch of water between the mouth at Fort Cassin Point, Lake Champlain (the site of the former Fort Cassin) and Vergennes is passable by boat, and is frequented by motor boats, canoes, and kayaks. Indeed, Vergennes was a shipyard of some importance in the various wars of the 18th century. Many nesting platforms have been built along the creek, so one is likely to see both osprey and bald eagles in the area. Otter Creek has a falls in the town of Middlebury, the site chosen in 1800 to be Vermont's original seat of higher education, Middlebury College. According to Around Middlebury, Otter Creek is the longest river in Vermont and was once an important \\"highway\\" through the western part of what is now the state. In Addison and Rutland counties, Otter Creek passes through significant wetlands, in particular Cornwall Marsh, Little Otter Creek Marsh and the Brandon Swamp. Because of its name, the unusual situation of a river emptying into a creek occurs several times along Otter Creek‚Äôs length. For a list of these tributaries, see Lake Champlain. The source and mouth are separated by distance‚Äîthe (approximate) additional are due to meandering.  Ecology  According to the Addison County Planning Commission, the creek has one of the \\"most intact, wide floodplains\\" in Vermont. The alder swamps, marshes and floodplains on the river absorb significant amounts of flooding from the river, and were never developed. Water quality near Lake Champlain and the mouth of the Middlebury River are consistently poor, with high E. coli counts. The river is also the second largest source of phosphorus pollution to Lake Champlain.

It is situated in the Newlands Valley 2.5 miles (4 km) south-west of Keswick. Although comparatively small in height, Barrow commands an all-round view, with the vales of Keswick and Newlands being visible. The name of the fell originates from the Anglo Saxon language meaning a hill or long ridge. Topography Barrow is a slender ridge climbing south-west from Braithwaite. At the summit it turns due west across the depression of Barrow Door, diverted by the valley of Stonycroft Gill. Beyond the col are Stile End and Outerside. The valley of Coledale lies to the north-west and Newlands Beck forms the eastern boundary. Ascents Ascents of the fell are usually started from either the Newlands Valley or Braithwaite, both providing a short ramble which can be combined with the adjoining higher fell of Outerside. The climb from Newlands starts at the hamlet of Stair and utilises an old mine road up Stonycroft Gill up to a height of 350 metres (1,148 feet) before veering back east to attain the summit. There are two paths from Braithwaite; one follows the northern ridge of the fell while the other approaches up the valley of Barrow Gill. Geology Barrow is composed of the laminated mudstone and siltstone of the Kirkstile Formation, typical of the Skiddaw group. A band of greywacke sandstone runs along the eastern flanks.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 29: BGS (1999) Like many of the fells in the Newlands Valley, Barrow has been extensively mined for lead in the past, the spoil heaps are extensive and sweep down to the road at the eastern foot of the hill. The spoil is quite light in colour and is clearly visible from afar. Barrow mine first opened in the 17th century and closed in 1888. The remaining spoil heaps are said to be in a state of continual slight movement and it is possible to hear a small rustle as the spoil slides down the hill. Another noteworthy topographical feature is the ravine of Barrow Gill, which appears on the Braithwaite side of the fell, the Gill is deep and extensive and seems out of proportion to the small stream that it accommodates. Summit The view easterly from the summit takes in Derwentwater and the vale of Keswick.A small cairn on grass marks the summit, with heather surrounding the top on all sides. The view takes in the surrounding higher North Western Fells, together with the Helvellyn range across Derwentwater and Skiddaw standing above Keswick.

He is noted as one of the pioneers of print journalism in Pakistan and was the founding editor and the first editor-in-chief of English-language newspaper, Dawn, which he edited for almost twenty years. In addition, he served as Industry Minister of Pakistan in the administration of President Ayub Khan from 1965 until resigning in 1968 due to health reasons. He is widely regarded as one of the key activists in the Pakistan Movement and penned several critically important articles in support of the case of Indian Muslims in British Indian Empire. Biography Education and government work Altaf Husain was born in Sylhet, Sylhet District, British India (now Bangladesh) into a family of Bengali Muslim zamindars, on 26 January 1900. His Sylheti father was Ahmad Ullah. After receiving his education from Murari Chand College in Sylhet, Husain moved to Calcutta to attend the University of Calcutta where he studied English language., Retrieved 2 Jan 2016 He earned a BA in English from Calcutta University and moved to Dhaka. He attended the Dhaka University where he studied English Literature and subsequently earned an MA in English language from University of Dhaka in 1923. Upon his graduation, he joined the Kolkata Municipal government where he became Director of Public Information from 1942 until 1943. He later proceeded to join the Indian Ministry of Information as press adviser. Although, he worked for the Indian government, he subsequently began to write political articles in the newspaper Statesman, Calcutta penning the fortnightly column \\"Through the Muslim Eyes\\" under the pen name, Ain-el-Mulk, which reflected the Muslim point of view. Pakistan movement and Industry ministry Shortly thereafter, he left the Indian Ministry of Information and started to write a column \\"Dar-el-Islam\\" (lit. \\"Door of Islam\\") for the Statesman but under the pen name, Shaheed (lit. Martyr). For a brief period of time, he also wrote ⁄©ÿ™ÿßns for the Calcutta-based newspaper Star of India. During this time, his incisive writing won recognition and attention from Muhammad Ali Jinnah (founder of Pakistan) who had contacted him to meet him in his residency in Mumbai. Eventually, he was asked to take a position of editor-in-chief of the newspaper Dawn, which was founded by Jinnah in 1945. He took over the office in Delhi and began printing Dawn. As an editor-in-chief of Dawn, he came to public notice and prominence, and was admitted into Jinnah's close circle of advisers. In this capacity, he played a critically important role in the success of the Pakistan Movement which led to the creation of a separate homeland for the Muslims of the South Asia. After the establishment of Pakistan, he moved his senior staff from Delhi to Karachi while he continued his editorship of Dawn in Karachi and remained so from 1947‚Äì65. His influence as the founding editor of the Dawn, his role in the Pakistan Movement and his extraordinary relationship with Jinnah meant that his was amongst the most influential voices outside the government. While defending East Pakistan's rights, he strongly assailed the idea of its separation from Pakistan. For some time, he joined the faculty of journalism at Karachi University to teach and instruct courses on journalism. In 1959, his services were recognised by the Government of Pakistan and he was conferred with the Hilal-e-Pakistan, in a public ceremony in 1959. In 1965, he was invited by President Ayub Khan to join the government, which he surprised many by accepting . Ultimately, he was appointed Industry Minister of Pakistan and oversaw the rapid industrialisation as well as the process of privatisation in Pakistan. He retained the ministry until 1968 when he resigned due to poor health. Death and legacy Altaf Husain resigned from the Industry ministry 10 days before his death. He died on 25 May 1968 and was buried with state honours in Model Colony cemetery.

Basic plot  The story focuses on Sally Floyd, a reporter for the fictional newspaper The Alternative, after the events of M-Day, when the Scarlet Witch used her powers to cause more than 90% of the world's mutants to lose their powers thus causing many mutants to die. Sally convinces her editor to let her tell the story of ex-mutants. After the column becomes a hit, Sally returns to her apartment to discover an envelope taped to her door reading \\"Not Enough Died.\\" Inside the envelope are photos of former mutants who have since been murdered. It has since been learned that the killer, called \\"The Ghoul\\", is in fact a mutant who has retained his/her powers, but is mentally insane.  Plot synopsis  Sally Floyd is a young reporter with a New York City newspaper, The Alternative. Although a good reporter, she suffers from alcoholism since the death of her young daughter, Minnie, much to the chagrin of her editor. After the majority of mutants lose their powers on M-Day, Sally decides to continue writing a column on them. She visits a hospital where Chamber has been taken. His face and chest are now just a gaping hole, a machine being the only thing keeping him alive. Her column is a resounding success and receives national acclaim. However, she soon receives photographs of mutants who have been killed, now that they can‚Äôt defend themselves.Generation M #1, January 2006 The police speak with Sally Floyd about the murders of several former mutants. Sally feels guilty, and wonders if they were killed because of her, but the police thinks the killer is probably using her to get attention. As part of her Mutant Diaries series, Sally visits Stacy X, a former mutant who now is just a prostitute with a skin condition. Sally next goes to visit her friend, Jubilation Lee, who is not much of a help. The police then confront her with a new theory, that the killer is actually a mutant himself.Generation M #2, February 2006 Sally is contacted by a man calling himself the Ghoul, who claims he is the one responsible for murdering former mutants and wants his story told. After a visit to a former mutant support group, Sally meets Fred J. Dukes, a former mutant known as the Blob. He suggests that she should visit an asylum in southern New York. Sally attends an AA meeting, but does not feel like she should be there. She returns to her apartment and has a run-in with her ex-husband about Minnie‚Äôs death and her drinking problem. The next day, she visits the asylum and witnesses how formerly powerful inmates are bullied by the still powered mutants. Sally departs, only to have the body of a dead mutant girl thrown at her car by the Ghoul.Generation M #3, March 2006 The Ghoul continues to harass Sally by sending her pictures of his victims. She then receives a visit from Barnell Bohusk, having lost his mutant appearance, with an invite to meet one of the X-Men. Before that, Sally interviews Marrow in the sewers for her Mutant Diaries. A criminal psychologist suggests that Sally try to cultivate some kind of positive relationship with the Ghoul in order to create a rounder profile on him, to which she reluctantly agrees. Later, she finally meets her contact from the Xavier Institute. It‚Äôs Warren Worthington, who reveals that he has lost his wings.Generation M #4, April 2006 After talking to Warren Worthington, Sally meets with Dani Moonstar, but her mind is on other things. She decides to do one final article that concentrates on her daughter. It explains how Minnie was a mutant who was growing smaller and younger until she died a few months before M-Day. Sally meets with Warren Worthington again and, as they chat, the Ghoul strikes. The X-Men appear to fight him, but the Ghoul teleports Sally away, angrily berating her for betraying him. Sally does her best to wind the Ghoul up, mouthing off about how crazy all of this is, and even punching him on the nose. The Ghoul is about to respond when Sally falls out of the tower they were in on purpose, only to be caught by Angel, who is revealed to having retained his wings after all. Cyclops then destroys the tower, bringing the Ghoul‚Äôs reign of terror to an end. After a couple of days in hospital, Sally returns to the office and finds her colleagues wholly approve of her decision to run the story and for catching the Ghoul. The last thing for Sally to do is to give Minnie the only gift she has to offer. She attends an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, only this time she stands before them and introduces herself in participation.Generation M #5, May 2006  References  Category:2006 comics debuts ","title":"Generation M (comics)"},{"id":"4492137","text":"Ella Bohlin.

J. L. Hudson, was the merchant who founded the Hudson's department store in Detroit, Michigan. Hudson also supplied the seed capital for the establishment, in 1909, of Roy D. Chapin's automotive venture, which Chapin named the Hudson Motor Car Company in honor of J.L. Hudson. Biography Hudson was born in Newcastle upon Tyne, England, and immigrated with his family to Hamilton, Canada when he was nine; by the age of fourteen he and members of his family were residing in Michigan. His brother William moved to Buffalo, New York in 1896, to operate a branch of the Hudson's store until his death in 1928.Rizzo, Michael F. (2007) Nine Nine Eight: The Glory Days of Buffalo Shopping Lulu Enterprises, Inc.; Morrisville, North Carolina. . While Hudson began his career in merchandising with family members and other outside partners, he founded what would provide the basis for Hudson's Department Stores in 1881 inside a shop at the Detroit Opera House. Hudson at first focused on men' and boy's wear, and succeeded through set low prices and a return policy that favored the customer. As business volume grew, Hudson added sale professionals and additional lines of goods, including women's clothing and housewares. Hudson incorporated his venture in 1891 as the J. L. Hudson Company. In addition with providing the seed capital for Hudson Motor Car Company, J.L. Hudson was also involved the American Vapor Stove Company, Dime Savings Bank, American Exchange National Bank, the Detroit City Gas Company, and the Third National Bank of Detroit. When the Third National Bank collapsed in the financial panic of 1893, Hudson felt personally liable for the failure and paid from his personal accounts an amount equal to the balances of record held by each account holder. The move cost Hudson $265,000, however the goodwill that it showed also paid Hudson dividends in the form of increasing market share for his businesses. Hudson was also active in civic causes in the greater Detroit area. Joseph never married. But towards the end of his life, he was engaged to Eida Caroline Schmidt, though he died from a lung problem while on a business trip on July 5, 1912, before they could marry. Some sources list his place of death as Worthing, England, while some newspaper accounts list the place of death as Paris, France. His remains were returned to Detroit aboard the RMS Oceanic and he was interred at Woodlawn Cemetery. According to biographer Edward L. Lack Jr., Hudson left no personal papers, and the details outside of his public life are few and mostly unknown. Hudson's niece Eleanor Lowthian Clay (1896‚Äì1976) was the wife of Edsel Ford.

Its total area is . According to the last census, 185 persons live in Ngardmau. Their 46 households are situated in three hamlets: Ngetbong, Ngerutoi and Urdmau. The hamlets have no visible boundaries, but form one settlement. The highest elevation on Palau is in Ngardmau; Mt. Ngerchelchuus, which is slightly over tall. At the south base of this mountain is a forest with giant trees that shelter many species of birds. In Ngardmau there are five retail stores, one laundromat, two gas stations, one construction enterprise, and one auto repair shop. Ngardmau has two tourist accommodations, a small apartment rental in the settlement and two bungalows in the woods above a scenic waterfall (Taki Falls), which is the main tourist attraction of Ngardmau.  Cultural history  One of the legends of Ngardmau includes \\"Ngerchokl\\" water wells. This place called \\"Ngerchokl\\" was known to be the water of youth. If a person jumped in the water well and came up, he or she would look years younger. However, the water well \\"Ngerchokl\\" lost its power in later years. A woman who was traveling with her child came upon the water well to drink water but because it was too hot, she decided to jump in not knowing the natural magic of the water. When she came up, she was younger than her age so her child cried heavily because the mother looked so different. The mother tried to console the child but didn't work. The woman eventually jumped again in the water well and she turned back to her old self again. The curse of this water well began and it has never been the same then. Today, the villagers share this story in many occasions with laughter.  Political system  Ngardmau traditional political and social system is very strong and is still being utilized today. Women association called \\"Ngaratumtum\\" and men association called \\"Ngara Okelout\\" are organizations which keep the women and men of Ngardmau active in traditional way of life and old values. \\"Bul\\" is a form of punishment of long time ago when person got into trouble stealing or walking on the road passing the curfew time. \\"Bul\\" punishment fine are paid to chiefs of Ngardmau. Today both \\"bul\\" punishment and government laws are both utilized in Ngardmau to keep the State clean and free of crime. The government of Ngardmau is also run by a governor (Akiko Sugiyama), representative (Mr. Kasolei), and senators. However Ngardmau's chiefs and their female counterparts are still in power, preserving the traditional way of life as well as values. Ngardmau is divided into three hamlets (Urdmang, Ngerutoi, and Ngetbong). These hamlets have chiefs and are presented in a hierarchy system according to clan. Beouch is a title for the highest chief and Ngirkebai is for second high chief (Aichi Kumangai), and followed by several other titles.  Chieftain  High Chief Beouch title is inherited through Ngedengoll ourrot. Omlei Demk was a ranking woman in the highest clan of Ngardmau called \\"Ngedngoll\\". Palau is still exercising traditional system which consists of matrilineal order where women hold power and heir among the clans. Women make decisions or selections on whom to be chief and so on, titles are awarded or inherited to men from their mothers clan. Ngardmau High Chief Beouch, Sakaziro Demk was married to Maylu Makaya (Known to Ngardmau villagers as \\"Dilmairong or Mairong\\". Unfortunately, Maylu died of natural causes in the early 1990s. Maylu (Mairong) Makaya survived by her four daughters and four sons and grand children. Maylu oldest daughter PVeronica Sakaziro who died in 2007, has two sons Sylvester and Daniel Rebelkuul and daughters, Leia Masami and Christina (known as Christy). Christina Sakaziro, the oldest of siblings was adapted to grandmother Maylu and grandfather Sakaziro so she became an additional sister to Maylu's and Chief Sakaziro's four daughters. Chief Sakaziro Beouch and Maylu's other daughters include Feblonia Demek (Melngois), Hilaria Demk (Iwong)), Maria Demk (Kukong), Christy Sakaziro (Itong). Sons: Joshnson Demk (Toribiong), Shinecio Demk (Orrukem), Justino Demk (Rengiil), Lerince Demk (Kueil). Today, High Chief Sakaziro Beouch is widowed living with his third oldest son Shinecio Demk (Orrukem). Chief Beouch is still working and very active in any activities or issues concerning the State of Ngardmau. Chief Beouch‚Äôs children and grandchildren all live in Palau except Christy Sakaziro.

As a facet of culture throughout most of the 20th century, Scouting has been portrayed in numerous films and artwork. It is especially prevalent in the United States, where Scouting is tied closely to the ideal of Americana. The works of painters Norman Rockwell and Joseph Csatari and the 1966 film Follow Me, Boys! are prime examples of this idealized American ethos. One of the earliest depictions of Scouting in the entertainment media is a 1908 British silent film Scouts to the Rescue, shown in nickelodeons. Produced by Williamson Kinematograph, it depicted Boy Scouts tracking a gang of kidnappers through the woods to rescue an abducted baby. Scouting is often dealt with in a humorous manner, as in the 1989 film Troop Beverly Hills, and is often fictionalized so that the audience knows the topic is Scouting without there being any mention of Scouting by name.

Bishop Timon High School, as it was originally known, was founded in 1946. History In 1946, the school officially opened its doors with a class of 76 freshmen. For three years, Bishop Timon ‚Äì St. Jude High School was temporarily housed at Our Lady of Perpetual Help in Buffalo's old First Ward. On September 6, 1949, Timon moved into its current home on McKinley Parkway with an enrollment of approximately 800 young men. In June 1950, Bishop O'Hara awarded diplomas to Bishop Timon's first graduating class. The school was named Bishop Timon after Buffalo's first bishop, John Timon. In 1993, the school added St. Jude to its name. Bishop Timon High School was founded by Roman Catholic priests of the Franciscan Order Minor, with the idea of providing a quality education at an affordable cost for the largely working-class Irish-American community within the proximity of its South Buffalo neighborhood location. The Franciscan commitment to the needs of the area was the impetus for opening this all-boys college preparatory high-school to the local neighborhood's mostly blue-collar residents. Campus The one building campus of the school is located at 601 McKinley Parkway which holds a new 6,000 square foot (540 m2) Center For Media & The Arts. This area maintains a working sound recording studio. It also is home to music and art studios, a graphic design lab, a video production lab, and a photography darkroom. In 2003, Timon High School opened the Science and Pre-Engineering Center. An Advanced Placement Conference & Technology room was also built, allowing the school to use distance learning with other schools through conferencing software. In 1963 Timon opened a Freshman Annex located on Como Ave. named after Monsignor Nash of Holy Family Parish to accommodate its growing enrollment during its peak years of the 60s and 70s. The Annex closed in 1977.

It draws its name from the city where the Sealy Corporation originally started, Sealy, Texas, United States.  History  In 1881, cotton gin builder Daniel Haynes lived in Sealy, Texas, located west of Houston. He began making cotton-filled mattresses for his friends and neighbors. In 1889, he patented an invention that compressed cotton for use in his mattresses. Eventually the mattresses became so popular he was able to sell the patents to manufacturers in other markets. The term \\"Mattress from Sealy\\" was coined to describe what was produced. During 1906, after much success as an advertising executive, Earl Edwards purchased the patents and gained manufacturing knowledge from Haynes. Edwards took the name \\"Sealy\\" for his new company and expanded it to a national market. Due to lack of funding for manufacturing, Sealy expanded using a licensing-expansion similar to that of Coca-Cola. By 1920, Sealy had 28 licensed plants and was the first mattress company to expand using a licensing program. During the Great Depression the mattress industry was hit hard. Sealy lost most of its licensees and narrowly escaped bankruptcy itself. The company consolidated with the surviving licensees and created what is now known as Sealy, Incorporated. Sealy operated as a franchisor out of its Chicago headquarters. Its licensees were, under the terms of their licensing agreement, only supposed to sell in a designated trading area that did not conflict with those of other franchisees. The largest licensee, Cleveland-based Ohio Mattress Company (founded by the Wuliger family and operated by Ernest M. Wuliger), defied these restrictions and sold into markets reserved for other franchisees. The conflict resulted in Ohio Mattress filing an antitrust suit against Sealy in 1971. The issue was decided fifteen years later with a near-total victory for Ohio Mattress. Unable to come up with the $77m award, Sealy Incorporated and all but one of the other franchisees were forced to sell to Ohio Mattress, and the company became the world's largest bedding manufacturer by sales. Merchant banking firm Gibbons Green Van Amerongen took Sealy private in an April 1989 leveraged buyout, a deal which netted Sealy shareholders US$965m. First Boston made a bridge loan to the buy-out firm just as Drexel Burnham Lambert was running into trouble and the junk bond market was drying up, and was stuck with the loan. The failed deal, known as \\"burning bed\\", led to a dramatic slow-down in leveraged buyouts. Gibbons Green dissolved and First Boston was forced into the arms of Credit Suisse.\\"Private Money\\", March 5, 2007, Fortune In 1990 Ohio Mattress assumed the Sealy name that it had acquired when it purchased Sealy Inc. In 1998 Sealy announced that it was moving from Cleveland to the High Point, North Carolina area. Bain Capital and a team of Sealy's senior executives acquired the company in 1997. In 2004, the company was acquired by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and a team of Sealy management. The deal was valued at $1.5 billion but included significant debt.\\"Sealy signs merger agreement with KKR; deal valued $1.5 billion\\". BedTimes Magazine. March 4, 2004. Retrieved 2011-9-19. The company operated as a privately held corporation until 2005. On June 30 of that year, it announced an initial public offering of common stock. The company said proceeds from the IPO would go to paying down debt, funding global operations and paying private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts to \\"terminate our future obligations under our management services agreement.\\"\\"Sealy to go public\\". BedTimes Magazine. August 2005. Retrieved 2011-9-19. In September 2012, Tempur-Pedic International (TPX) announced an agreement to purchase Sealy (NYSE:ZZ) for about US$229 million. Sealy's corporate headquarters are located in Trinity, North Carolina. Although Sealy's website claims that they are the largest manufacturer of mattresses in the world, Tempur-Pedic had greater revenue than Sealy in 2011. Sealy has 25 U.S. plants and a 17.8 per cent share of the country‚Äôs mattress sales.Richard M.

Biography  Crown Prince Hasan (centre), to the left prime minister Abdul Majid Kubar and Taher Bakeer, Governor of Tripolitania and father-in-law. Crown Prince Hasan shaking hands with Hussein Maziq, governor of Cyrenaica. Wanis al-Qaddafi and General Mahmud Buguaitin are standing behind the prince. Hasan was born in 1928 the fifth son of Muhammad ar-Ride as-Senussi (1890‚Äì1955, the brother of the then emir of Cyrenaica, Idris of Libya) and his tenth wife Imbaraika al-Fallatiyya. He was educated at Al-Taj, Kufra and Al-Azhar University in Cairo, Egypt. On 24 December 1951, Libya became independent. Following the death of his father, he was nominated Crown Prince by his uncle King Idris I on 26 October 1956.  1969 revolution  The events of September 1969, proved to be pivotal both for Crown Prince Hasan and for Libya. As Crown Prince, Hasan was first in line succeed to the Libyan throne. The ailing Idris presented a signed document on 4 August 1969 to the President of the Libyan Senate, whereby Idris was to abdicate in favour of the Crown Prince. The instrument of abdication specified 2 September, the date when the King undertook formally to stand down. Indeed, the Crown Prince was already exercising regal powers in the name of King Idris, in the run up to 2 September. However, on 1 September, while Idris was out of the country undergoing medical treatment, a group of Libyan army officers, among them Colonel Muammar al-Gaddafi, staged a rebellion and announced that King Idris was deposed. Since King Idris I was unable to complete his reign as envisaged by his instrument of abdication Hasan never actually became king. His legacy, however, was in his role of Crown Prince, exercised between 1956 and 1969, towards the end of which he was the de facto ruler of Libya. As Crown Prince, he repeatedly undertook official trips abroad, notably to negotiate the purchase of U.S.-built jet fighters from the Kennedy Administration for the Libyan Air Force.  House arrest and death  Following the revolution, Hasan was kept under house arrest in Libya, tried in the Libyan People's Court and sentenced to three years in prison in November 1971. In 1984, the Crown Prince and his family were thrown out of their house, which was then burnt down, and forced to move into cabins on one of Tripoli's public beaches. It was in these cabins that the Crown Prince suffered a stroke in 1986. In 1988, the Crown Prince was permitted by Colonel Qaddafi to travel for medical treatment to London, where he died in 1992..

He was also a founding member of the hip-hop group Gravediggaz, for which he used the alias Grym Reaper. He also used the alias Tony Titanium.  Early life  The eldest son of a minister John Berkley and Wife Ela Berkeley. With three other siblings Dawne, Edward, and Richard. Poetic was born in Trinidad and raised in the town of Wyandanch on Long Island, New York. After forming his first hip- hop group, Brothers Grym, with younger siblings Brainstorm and E Sharp in 1989, Sharp handled some of the production duties, while Poetic and Brainstorm provided vocals. The group created a buzz for itself in the underground with its first official demo, which included notable cuts such as \\"Circle-Circle- Dot-Dot\\" and \\"GRYMnastics.\\" Just when the group was close to landing a record deal, Brainstorm surprisingly decided to quit hip hop altogether and forced Too Poetic to pursue a solo career and released a solo 12-inch single, Poetical Terror/God Made Me Funky, in 1989 on Tommy Boy/Warner Bros. Records. However, his deal with Tommy Boy fell through before the release of his first album, and Too Poetic fell on hard times, which included a period of homelessness.  Gravediggaz  Poetic then joined Wu-Tang Clan's leader RZA, former De La Soul/Stetsasonic producer Prince Paul, and Frukwan from Stetsasonic in the hip-hop supergroup Gravediggaz. Concerning the origins of the supergroup, he said: Each member adopted a Gravedigga alias, and Poetic became known as the Grym Reaper (with Grym, an acronym for Ghetto-Repaired Young Mind, also referring back to his first group). It was stated this stylistic change was adapted from his brief period of homelessness as his former DJ Koas said in an interview \\"He went homeless and that took a toll on him. He hit rock bottom and that opens your eyes to go deep, and that‚Äôs when he got dark. I guess it makes you strong to want it that bad. Tommy Boy jerked a lot of people.\\" Wyandanch Week, Pt. 5: The Too Poetic Story + lost album This proved to be an impressive change, as his offbeat rhyming style quickly gained attention as the group's first album, 1994's 6 Feet Deep (also known by its original title Niggamortis outside the US), garnered positive reviews and strong sales alike. After the group's second album, The Pick, the Sickle, and the Shovel was released in 1997, The RZA and Prince Paul decided to leave Gravediggaz, leaving Frukwan and Poetic as the only remaining members. During this time, Anthony's rhyming style had matured more. He later showcased this new style in the 1998 single \\"Savior,\\" which was produced by British-born producer Baby J, The song was more different than most of his Gravediggaz related material as he rhymed about how much he detested mainstream hip-hop music in general. In April 1999, Anthony collapsed in his home studio with stomach pains and was subsequently diagnosed with colon cancer. During this period, he collaborated with The Prodigy's Maxim Reality and Last Emperor under the name of Tony Titanium. He created work under his original name as well as continuing work on the third Gravediggaz album. The subsequent release, Nightmare in A-Minor, was the group's darkest work yet. It made references to Poetic's cancer on the track \\"Burn, Baby, Burn\\" and on the Last Emperor's track \\"One Life\\". In 2010, an interview was done with Poetic's former DJ Freddie \\"Kaos\\" Cox, in which the DJ discusses the early career of the rapper, and an unreleased album of Poetic's music prior to joining the gravediggaz entitled Drop Signal (which was supposed to be his debut album on Tommy Boy, before the deal with the group fell through) has surfaced on the Internet, which includes 14 tracks.  Death  Poetic died of colon cancer on July 15, 2001, 1:45 pm EST at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, five weeks before Nightmare in A-Minor‚Äôs scheduled release. He had survived almost two and a half years beyond the doctors' initial 3-month prognosis. Tributes came quickly from across the hip-hop world, both from fellow musicians such as Chuck D of Public Enemy, who wrote an article in tribute to him on his Welcome To The Terrordome commentary section on the group's Web site, and from critics, who widely wrote of their regret at the loss of his talent. An intimate memorial service for him was held at the Riverside Church in Harlem on August 4, 2001, attended by his family and close friends including bandmates Frukwan and Prince Paul. Nightmare in A-Minor was initially released by Echo Distribution on August 23, 2001. It was re-released without the track \\"Better Wake Up\\" on Empire Musicwerks/BMG in 2002 to critical plaudits. According to Frukwan, a new album may be released using leftover material from Poetic.  Discography   Singles  * 1989 \\"Poetical Terror / God Made Me Funky\\".

Seagrasses are marine (saltwater) plants found in shallow coastal waters and in the brackish waters of estuaries. Seagrasses are flowering plants with stems and long green, grass-like leaves. They produce seeds and pollen and have roots and rhizomes which anchor them in seafloor sand. Seagrasses form dense underwater meadows which are among the most productive ecosystems in the world. They provide habitats and food for a diversity of marine life comparable to that of coral reefs. This includes invertebrates like shrimp and crabs, cod and flatfish, marine mammals and birds. They provide refuges for endangered species such as seahorses, turtles, and dulongs. They function as nursery habitats for shrimps, scallops and many commercial fish species. Seagrass meadows provide coastal storm protection by the way their leaves absorb energy from waves as they hit the coast. They keep coastal waters healthy by absorbing bacteria and nutrients, and slow the speed of climate change by sequestering carbon dioxide into the sediment of the ocean floor. Seagrasses evolved from marine algae which colonized land and became land plants, and then returned to the ocean about 100 million years ago. However, today seagrass meadows are being damaged by human activities such as pollution from land runoff, fishing boats that drag dredges or trawls across the meadows uprooting the grass, and overfishing which unbalances the ecosystem. Seagrass meadows are currently being destroyed at a rate of about two football fields every hour. Overview Seagrasses are terrestrial plants that transitioned to the marine environment. They are the only flowering plants that live in the ocean. Seagrasses are flowering plants that evolved from the land back to the sea, and now occupy the sea bottom in shallow waters along the coast all over the world. Seagrass meadows are hidden underwater grass fields that protect the coast and offer shelter to many sea creatures. Seagrasses are flowering plants (angiosperms) which grow in marine environments. There are about 60 species of fully marine seagrasses belonging to four families (Posidoniaceae, Zosteraceae, Hydrocharitaceae and Cymodoceaceae), all in the order Alismatales (in the class of monocotyledons). Seagrasses evolved from terrestrial plants which migrated back into the ocean about 75 to 100 million years ago. Like all autotrophic plants, seagrasses photosynthesize, in the submerged photic zone, and most occur in shallow and sheltered coastal waters anchored in sand or mud bottoms. Most species undergo submarine pollination and complete their life cycle underwater. Seagrasses beds/meadows can be either monospecific (made up of a single species) or in mixed beds. In temperate areas, usually one or a few species dominate (like the eelgrass Zostera marina in the North Atlantic), whereas tropical beds usually are more diverse, with up to thirteen species recorded in the Philippines. Seagrass meadows form in maximum depths of up to 50m, depending on water quality and light availability, and can include up to 12 different species in one meadow. These seagrass meadows are highly productive habitats that provide many ecosystem services, including sediment stabilization, habitat and biodiversity, better water quality, and carbon and nutrient sequestration. Seagrass beds, sometimes called prairies of the sea, are diverse and productive ecosystems which harbour species from all phyla, for example juvenile and adult fish, epiphytic and free-living macroalgae and microalgae, mollusks, bristle worms, and nematodes. Few species were originally considered to feed directly on seagrass leaves (partly because of their low nutritional content), but scientific reviews and improved working methods have shown that seagrass herbivory is an important link in the food chain, feeding hundreds of species, including green turtles, dugongs, manatees, fish, geese, swans, sea urchins and crabs. Some fish species that visit/feed on seagrasses raise their young in adjacent mangroves or coral reefs. Carbon uptake and photosynthesis in a seagrass meadow. Special cells within the seagrass, called chloroplasts, use energy from the sun to convert carbon dioxide and water into carbohydrates (or sugar) and oxygen through photosynthesis. Seagrass roots and rhizomes absorb and store nutrients and help to anchor the seagrass plants in place. holdfasts to secure then to the seafloor and internally transport nutrients by diffusion, while seagrasses are flowering plants with a rhizome and root system connecting them to the seafloor and a vascular system for internal transport.Fusi M and Daffonchio D (2019) \\"How Seagrasses Secure Our Coastlines\\".

Global distribution Seagrasses are found all over the world, in both hot and cold locations. Seagrasses live in shallow seas on the continental shelf of all continents except Antarctica. The continental shelf is the underwater area of land surrounding each continent, creating an area of relatively shallow water known as a shelf sea. It is believed that seagrasses cover 125,000 km2 around the world, but other estimates suggest that this number might be a lot bigger‚Äîseagrasses may cover up to 600,000 km2 of the shallow ocean. Seagrass meadows are found in areas with soft sediment that are either intertidal (uncovered daily by seawater, as the tide goes in and out) or subtidal (always under the water). Seagrasses prefer sheltered places, such as shallow bays, lagoons, and estuaries (sheltered areas where rivers flow in to the sea), where waves are limited and light and nutrient levels are high. Seagrasses can be found up to around 60 metres deep, but this depends on the availability of light because, like plants on the land, seagrass meadows need sunlight for photosynthesis to occur. Tides, wave action, water clarity, and low salinity (low amounts of salt in the water) control where seagrasses can live at their shallow edge nearest the shore,Hemminga, M. A., and Duarte, C. M. (2000) Seagrass Ecology, first edition, Cambridge University Press. . all of these things must be just right for seagrass to survive and grow. The current documented seagrass area is 177,000 km2, but is thought to underestimate the total area since many areas with large seagrass meadows have not been thoroughly documented. Most common estimates are 300,000 to 600,000 km2, with up to 4,320,000 km2 suitable seagrass habitat worldwide. Ecosystem services As shown on this turtle grass, many epiphytes can grow on the leaf blades of grasses, and algae, diatoms and bacterial films can cover the surface. The grass is eaten by turtles, herbivorous parrotfish, surgeonfish, and sea urchins, while the leaf surface films are a food source for many small invertebrates. Seagrass meadows are one of the more important ecosystems. Seagrasses also cleanse the water of excess nutrients and toxic pollutants. Although often overlooked, seagrasses provide coastal zones with a number of ecosystem goods and services. Seagrasses are considered ecosystem engineers. This means that the plants alter the ecosystem around them. This adjusting occurs in both physical and chemical forms. Many seagrass species produce an extensive underground network of roots and rhizome which stabilizes sediment and reduces coastal erosion. This system also assists in oxygenating the sediment, providing a hospitable environment for sediment-dwelling organisms. Seagrasses also enhance water quality by stabilizing heavy metals, pollutants, and excess nutrients. The long blades of seagrasses slow the movement of water which reduces wave energy and offers further protection against coastal erosion and storm surge. Furthermore, because seagrasses are underwater plants, they produce significant amounts of oxygen which oxygenate the water column. These meadows account for more than 10% of the ocean's total carbon storage. Per hectare, it holds twice as much carbon dioxide as rain forests and can sequester about 27.4 million tons of CO2 annually. The storage of carbon is an essential ecosystem service as we move into a period of elevated atmospheric carbon levels.

If these seagrass habitats are lost, then the fisheries are lost as well. Coastal protection Seagrasses help trap sediment particles transported by sea currents. The leaves, extending toward the sea surface, slow down the water currents. The slower current is not able to carry the particles of sediment, so the particles drop down and become part of the seafloor, eventually building it up. When seagrasses are not present, the sea current has no obstacles and carries the sediment particles away, lifting them and eroding the seafloor. \\"Seagrasses are not only affected by water in motion, they also affect the currents, waves and turbulence environment is referred to as ecosystem engineering.\\"(Jones et al., 1994, 1997; Thomas et al., 2000).Koch, E.W., Ackerman, J.D., Verduin, J. and van Keulen, M. (2007) \\"Fluid dynamics in seagrass ecology‚Äîfrom molecules to ecosystems\\". In\\" Seagrasses: biology, ecology and conservation, pages 193‚Äì225, Springer, Dordrecht. . Seagrasses prevent erosion of the seafloor to the point that their presence can raise the seafloor. Seagrasses contribute to coast protection by trapping rock debris transported by the sea. Seagrasses reduce erosion of the coast and protect houses and cities from both the force of the sea and from sea-level rise caused by global warming. Seagrasses do this by softening the force of the waves with their leaves, and helping sediment transported in the seawater to accumulate on the seafloor. Seagrass leaves act as baffles in turbulent water that slow down water movement and encourage particulate matter to settle out. Seagrass meadows are one of the most effective barriers against erosion, because they trap sediment amongst their leaves. Archaeologists have learned from seagrasses how to protect underwater archaeological sites, like a site in Denmark where dozens of ancient Roman and Viking shipwrecks have been discovered. The archaeologists use seagrass-like covers as sediment traps, to build up sediment so that it buries the ships.

Support for fisheries According to a 2019 paper by Unsworth et al,Unsworth, R.K., Nordlund, L.M. and Cullen‚ÄêUnsworth, L.C. (2019) \\"Seagrass meadows support global fisheries production\\".

They argue that: (1) Seagrass meadows provide valuable nursery habitat to over 1/5th of the world's largest 25 fisheries, including walleye pollock, the most landed species on the planet. (2) In complex small‚Äêscale fisheries from around the world (poorly represented in fisheries statistics), there is evidence that many of those in proximity to seagrass are supported to a large degree by these habitats. (3) Intertidal fishing activity in seagrass is a global phenomenon, often directly supporting human livelihoods. According to the study, seagrasses should be recognized and managed to maintain and maximize their role in global fisheries production. Seagrass meadows support global food security by (1) providing nursery habitat for fish stocks in adjacent and deep water habitats, (2) creating expansive fishery habitat rich in fauna, and (3) by providing trophic support to adjacent fisheries. They also provide support by promoting the health of fisheries associated with connected habitats, such as coral reefs. In the oceans, gleaning can be defined as fishing with basic gear, including bare hands, in shallow water not deeper than that one can stand.Nordlund, L.M., Unsworth, R.K., Gullstr√∂m, M. and Cullen‚ÄêUnsworth, L.C. (2018) \\"Global significance of seagrass fishery activity. Fish and Fisheries\\", 19(3): 399‚Äì412. .

Invertebrate gleaning (walking) fisheries are common within intertidal seagrass meadows globally, contributing to the food supply of hundreds of millions of people, but understanding of these fisheries and their ecological drivers are extremely limited. A 2019 study by Nessa et al. analysed these fisheries using a combined social and ecological approach. Catches were dominated by bivalves, sea urchins and gastropods. The catch per unit effort (CPUE) in all sites varied from 0.05 to 3 kg per gleaner per hour, with the majority of fishers being women and children. Landings were of major significance for local food supply and livelihoods at all sites. Local ecological knowledge suggests seagrass meadows are declining in line with other regional trends. Increasing seagrass density significantly and positively correlated with CPUE of the invertebrate gleaning (r = 0.830) highlighting the importance of conserving these threatened habitats.Nessa, N., Ambo-Rappe, R., Cullen-Unsworth, L.C. and Unsworth, R.K.F.

Blue carbon Blue carbon refers to carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere by the world's coastal marine ecosystems, mostly mangroves, salt marshes, seagrasses and potentially macroalgae, through plant growth and the accumulation and burial of organic matter in the soil.Nellemann, Christian et al. (2009): Blue Carbon. The Role of Healthy Oceans in Binding Carbon. A Rapid Response Assessment. Arendal, Norway: UNEP/GRID-Arendal Although seagrass makes up only 0.1% of the area of the ocean floor, it accounts for approximately 10-18% of the total oceanic carbon burial. Currently global seagrass meadows are estimated to store as much as 19.9 Pg (gigaton, or billion tons) of organic carbon. Carbon primarily accumulates in marine sediments, which are anoxic and thus continually preserve organic carbon from decadal-millennial time scales. High accumulation rates, low oxygen, low sediment conductivity and slower microbial decomposition rates all encourage carbon burial and carbon accumulation in these coastal sediments. Compared to terrestrial habitats that lose carbon stocks as CO2 during decomposition or by disturbances like fires or deforestation, marine carbon sinks can retain C for much longer time periods. Carbon sequestration rates in seagrass meadows vary depending on the species, characteristics of the sediment, and depth of the habitats, but on average the carbon burial rate is approximately 138 g C m‚àí2 yr‚àí1. Biogeochemistry It is to do with how tropical seagrasses mobilise phosphorus and iron. Tropical seagrasses are nutrient-limited owing to the strong phosphorus fixation capacity of carbonate-rich sediments, yet they form densely vegetated, multispecies meadows in oligotrophic tropical waters. Tropical seagrasses are able to mobilize the essential nutrients iron and phosphorus in their rhizosphere via multiple biogeochemical pathways. They can mobilise phosphorus and iron within their rhizosphere via plant-induced local acidification, leading to dissolution of carbonates and release of phosphate, and via local stimulation of microbial sulfide production. These mechanisms have a direct link to seagrass-derived radial oxygen loss and secretion of dissolved organic carbon from the below-ground tissue into the rhizosphere. This demonstration of seagrass-derived rhizospheric phosphorus and iron mobilization explains why seagrasses are widely distributed in oligotrophic tropical waters.Brodersen, K.E., Koren, K., Mo√ühammer, M., Ralph, P.J., K√ºhl, M. and Santner, J. (2017) \\"Seagrass-mediated phosphorus and iron solubilization in tropical sediments\\". Environmental science & technology, 51(24): 14155‚Äì14163. . 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. The primary nutrients determining seagrass growth are carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and light for photosynthesis. Nitrogen and phosphorus can be acquired from sediment pore water or from the water column, and sea grasses can uptake N in both ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3‚àí) form. A number of studies from around the world have found that there is a wide range in the concentrations of C, N, and P in seagrasses depending on their species and environmental factors. For instance, plants collected from high-nutrient environments had lower C:N and C:P ratios than plants collected from low-nutrient environments. Seagrass stoichiometry does not follow the Redfield ratio commonly used as an indicator of nutrient availability for phytoplankton growth. In fact, a number of studies from around the world have found that the proportion of C:N:P in seagrasses can vary significantly depending on their species, nutrient availability, or other environmental factors. Depending on environmental conditions, seagrasses can be either P-limited or N-limited. An early study of seagrass stoichiometry suggested that the Redfield balanced ratio between N and P for seagrasses is approximately 30:1. However, N and P concentrations are strictly not correlated, suggesting that seagrasses can adapt their nutrient uptake based on what is available in the environment. For example, seagrasses from meadows fertilized with bird excrement have shown a higher proportion of phosphate than unfertilized meadows. Alternately, seagrasses in environments with higher loading rates and organic matter diagenesis supply more P, leading to N-limitation. P availability in T. testudinum is the limiting nutrient. The nutrient distribution in T. testudinum ranges from 29.4-43.3% C, 0.88-3.96% N, and 0.048-0.243% P. This equates to a mean ratio of 24.6 C:N, 937.4 C:P, and 40.2 N:P. This information can also be used to characterize the nutrient availability of a bay or other water body (which is difficult to measure directly) by sampling the seagrasses living there. Light availability is another factor that can affect the nutrient stoichiometry of seagrasses. Nutrient limitation can only occur when photosynthetic energy causes grasses to grow faster than the influx of new nutrients. For example, low light environments tend to have a lower C:N ratio. Alternately, high-N environments can have an indirect negative effect to seagrass growth by promoting growth of algae that reduce the total amount of available light. Nutrient variability in seagrasses can have potential implications for wastewater management in coastal environments. High amounts of anthropogenic nitrogen discharge could cause eutrophication in previously N-limited environments, leading to hypoxic conditions in the seagrass meadow and affecting the carrying capacity of that ecosystem. A study of annual deposition of C, N, and P from P. oceanica seagrass meadows in northeast Spain found that the meadow sequestered 198 g C m‚àí2 yr‚àí1, 13.4 g N m‚àí2 yr‚àí1, and 2.01 g P m‚àí2 yr‚àí1 into the sediment. Subsequent remineralization of carbon from the sediments due to respiration returned approximately 8% of the sequestered carbon, or 15.6 g C m‚àí2 yr ‚àí1. Human impacts Human activities, such as fishing methods that rely on heavy nets that are dragged across the sea floor, put this important ecosystem at serious risk. Seagrass habitats are threatened by coastal eutrophication and increased seawater temperatures, as well as increased sedimentation and coastal development. Seagrass loss has accelerated over the past few decades, from 0.9% per year prior to 1940 to 7% per year in 1990. File:Chek Jawa, panorama 5, Aug 07.jpg|Seagrass lagoon, Chek Jawa, Singapore.

In 1994, the European Commission ordered the Greek government to finally restructure the ailing Olympic Airways Group of Companies. In December 2003, the government decided to split the Olympic Airways Group into two different companies. The first, renamed, Olympic Airlines, took over the Group's flight operations, starting with no debts. All Olympic Airways debts and other operations were transferred to the new company, Olympic Airways - Services S.A.. Today, the company specializes in 7 sectors of the airline industry (including ground handling at 38 Greek airports, cargo, aircraft maintenance, training center and flightacademy, Olympic Aviation helicopter charters and the information technology unit). Olympic Aviation became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company. O.A. - Services also provides VIP lounge services for Olympic Airline and other airlines, such as Luxair, in most Greek airports. The company announced its 2006 budget, showing very little profit, after many decades of rising losses and debts. The company (and the former Olympic Airways Group) has never shown any profit since it was sold to the Greek state in 1975 by its founder, Aristotle Onassis. Profit was only once announced, in 1996.

The station lies in the heart of Philadelphia's financial district, steps away from the Philadelphia Stock Exchange and two blocks north of Rittenhouse Square. History Route 13 PCC streetcar at the station in 1980 The station was built by the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company (PRT), and for the first two years formed part of a subway‚Äìsurface trolley loop operating underground between and the Schuylkill River. In 1907, the Market Street subway‚Äìelevated line was completed from 15th Street to . The original line featured a bridge ‚Äì located north of Market Street and south of Filbert Street ‚Äì that carried both the subway and subway‚Äìsurface lines over the Schuylkill River. The PRT bridge connected trolley lines in West Philadelphia to the underground subway‚Äìsurface loop in Center City. 19th Street was originally the westernmost underground trolley station, as tracks rose up to an embankment west of the station to cross the PRT bridge. The station originally served Routes 10, 11, 31, 34, 37 and 38. Route 31 was rerouted out of the tunnel in 1949 and buses replaced trolleys on routes 37 and 38 in 1955.

One of the most prominent martial artist actresses of her time, she is nicknamed \\"Lady Whirlwind\\" and \\"Lady Kung Fu\\". She was positioned as a female version of Bruce Lee. Biography Mao was born as Mao Fuching in 1950. She is the daughter of Mao Yung Kang, Peking Opera star, who moved from China to Taiwan in 1949. Her family was originally from Zhejiang province. Angela was originally a Chinese opera actress before becoming an action film actress; at a young age she attended ballet classes before joining The Fu Shing Peking Opera in 1958. Mao trained in hapkido and other martial arts at an early age. This would later help her achieve success in martial art movies. When she was 17, she was discovered by Huang Feng, an action movie director known for discovering Sammo Hung and Carter Wong. Feng was looking for a young woman who knew martial arts to be the leading lady for his upcoming sword fight film, called Angry River. With her experience in acting and martial arts, Angela quickly began taking leading roles in other action movies in Golden Harvest productions including Hapkido (Lady Kung-fu), Lady Whirlwind, and The Fate of Lee Khan (directed by King Hu). She was also successful in other movies such as The Association, The Himalayans and many others. Internationally, she found fame for her role as the doomed sister of Bruce Lee's character in 1973's Enter the Dragon. Although Bruce Lee died shortly after the production of the movie, Mao was able to train and develop a friendship with Lee. Following the incredible success to her short-lived role in 1973's Enter The Dragon, many of her films began to be released in the west. Hapkido was the first to gain this wider audience. The film also starred Carter Wong, Sammo Hung, her real life teacher Hwang In-Shik and also Ji Han Jae. Also working on Hapkido were an uncredited 'bootmaster' Leung Siu-Lung who was helping Sammo with the fight choreography and a stuntman named Jackie Chan. Mao continued with a string of successful movies through the seventies. Angela alongside with actor Carter Wong became a bit of a kung fu duo act in a series of kung fu classic movies. One of most popular movies made by them was When Taekwondo Strikes which was also the only film made by Jhoon Rhee. Mao spent time training with Rhee during the making of this movie. After her Golden Harvest contract expired, she returned to Taiwan and for the next five years she continued to make kung fu movies. Mao married Kelly Lai Chen in 1974 and gave birth to a daughter in 1976. They divorced in 1980. She later married to her second husband and had a son, George King, who was born in 1983. She retired from acting in 1992 to devote herself to her family. She moved to New York City in 1993, where she and her family run three restaurants.

The film and book describe growing up in a family with twelve children, in Montclair, New Jersey. The title comes from one of Gilbreth's favorite jokes, which played out in the movie, that when he and his family were out driving and stopped at a red light, a pedestrian would ask: \\"Hey, Mister! How come you got so many kids?\\" Gilbreth would pretend to ponder the question carefully, and then, just as the light turned green, would say: \\"Well, they come cheaper by the dozen, you know\\", and drive off. Plot The parents are the time and motion study and efficiency experts Frank Bunker Gilbreth Sr. and psychologist Lillian Moller Gilbreth. The film shows typical days in the lives of a family in the 1920s, but here with 12 children and an efficiency engineer as the parent. Frank employs his unorthodox teaching methods on his children, and there are clashes between parents and children. Frank takes every opportunity to study motion and increase efficiency, including filming his children's tonsillectomies to see if there are ways to streamline the operation. After Frank's sudden death, the family agree that Lillian will continue with her husband's work; this enables the family to remain in their house, rather than move to their grandmother's in California, although, with a widowed working mother and one income, the children will have to assume much greater responsibilities. Cast Sequel Comparison to real life The birth order in which Cheaper by the Dozen portrays some of the children is not the same order in which the real Gilbreth children were born. For example, Robert (who was born in 1920) is shown as being born in 1922, as the last child after Jane (who was born in 1922). This is reversed in the movie's sequel. In real life, Mary, who was the second child, died in 1912, aged 5. However, in the film Cheaper by the Dozen, Mary is placed as the third child after Ernestine, and has few or no lines. Both Frank and Lillian Gilbreth were important figures in real life. The voice-over at the end of the film informs the audience that Lillian went on to become the world's leading efficiency expert and the TIME magazine Woman of the Year in 1948. Additionally, in 1984, her image was put on a US postal stamp. Reception Reviews from critics were mostly positive. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote that \\"it all adds up to entertainment of a broad, brash and innocent sort.\\" Variety called it \\"a lot of fun\\" with \\"a lot of humor, and just enough clutching at the heart to please any audience.\\" Harrison's Reports called it \\"delightfully amusing\\" with comedy \\"that keeps one chuckling throughout and at times reaches hilarious proportions.\\" \\"Pleasant light entertainment,\\" reported The Monthly Film Bulletin. John McCarten of The New Yorker was less enthused, writing that \\"since nothing much happens in the way of conflict, there just isn't any drama, and the piece boils down to one of those typical fluffy comedies about home life in America.\\" References External links   * Category:1950 films Category:1950s comedy-drama films Category:20th Century Fox films Category:American films Category:American comedy-drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films about families Category:Films based on biographies Category:Films directed by Walter Lang Category:Films scored by Cyril J.

Following the idea of playing the keyboard as a synthetic organ, drummer Lasse Pelkonen also adapted his equipment and playing style. From then on, among other things, he used felt mallets instead of the drumsticks usually present in heavy metal. In another interview, he described that and how the band found an independent sacred sound as an intuitive process. Meanwhile, the daily rehearsal with the idea to set itself apart from classic metal bands was significant for the phase of the band. They channeled ideas and influences of their previous musical career and their musical socialization in the creation of the album to a creative basic structure, which after P√∂yry could be regarded as the basis of their further work. The band acted with the bass player J. Korpihete, who did not become part of the band. P√∂yry expressly described Korpihete as a \\"session member\\" whose participation included an integration into the design process of the album in addition to the playing of the instrument, but was only a temporary solution. Artwork As with some of Skepticism's later releases, the cover of the album was illustrated by the close-up of an object, which cannot be clearly identified in the picture alone, unlike the pictures of Rauch on Farmakon or a suit on Ordeal used later. The photographs of branches and water surfaces in the same color used in the interior of the booklet indicate a corresponding object. The picture shows shapes in reddish to yellow-orange coloring on a black background. The lyrics for the songs are printed inside the booklet. The back cover of the album illustrates the photo of the reflections of a water surface. The pictures were all selected by the band under the self-designation as Lihtede Group. The graphic processing was carried out by Arts Industria. Release Stromcrowfleet was first released via Red Stream in 1995, initially the album's release was limited to a CD format. The album was first released with six separate tracks and a playing time of 57:19 minutes. No changes were made to this volume of the album in later editions and bonus material was also not added. The first re-releases of the album kept the CD format. The album was first released in a vinyl version in 2018 by Svart Records. In 2017, the band bought the master tapes and was looking for a cooperation partner and a studio to release the recordings in vinyl format for the first time. For the 2018 release as a double vinyl, the tapes were remixed in Astia studios with high- quality analog technology, but the band made no changes to the original recordings of the songs. In meetings, the revision was mentioned as a significant improvement in sound quality. Further reissues have been made by various labels such as Russian label Irond Ltd. and British label Peaceville Records.

He rose to command a corps in the Army of the Potomac and fought in many of the key campaigns in the Eastern Theater. After the war, he commanded the Department of Texas during Reconstruction. He was an ardent supporter of the Congressional policies of the Radical Republicans and of freedmen's rights, and controversially disqualified a number of antebellum state officeholders in Texas, replacing them with loyal Unionists. Early life and career Griffin was born in Granville, Ohio, the son of Apollos Griffin. He attended the nearby Kenyon College in Gambier, and graduated from the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, New York, placing 23rd out of 38 in the Class of 1847.Eicher, 2001, p. 269. Commissioned as a brevet second lieutenant, he served with the 2nd U.S. Artillery during the final campaign of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. He was promoted to first lieutenant in 1849 and served in the New Mexico Territory against Navajo Indians until 1854, when he left the Southwest frontier. He then taught artillery tactics at West Point, forming an artillery battery from the academy's enlisted men shortly after the Southern states began seceding from the Union. Civil War Griffin's battery at Bull Run battlefield Captain Griffin led the \\"West Point Battery\\" (officially designated as Battery D, 5th U.S. Artillery) at the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861. He received a brief furlough from the army and married Sallie Carroll, the scion of a prominent Maryland family, on December 10, 1861. Griffin commanded his battery during the early part of the 1862 Peninsula Campaign. He was promoted to brigadier general of volunteers on June 12, 1862, to rank from June 9, 1862,Eicher, 2001, p. 722. and assigned command of a brigade of infantry. He served with distinction at Gaines's Mill and Malvern Hill. During the Second Battle of Bull Run, his brigade was held in reserve. His men were also lightly engaged at the Battle of Antietam. Griffin's irascibility frequently led to conflict with his superiors, but his leadership abilities brought steady promotion.Handbook of Texas Online General Griffin and his staff Assigned command of a division in the V Corps, he served at the Battle of Fredericksburg and during the Chancellorsville Campaign. Stricken with illness, he turned over command of the division to a subordinate and did not accompany it during the early part of the Gettysburg Campaign. Arriving as the Battle of Gettysburg was winding down, his return was widely celebrated by his men. The popular officer led the division throughout the year, including during the Mine Run Campaign. Griffin participated in most of the major battles of the Army of the Potomac in 1864, including the Overland Campaign and Siege of Petersburg. On December 12, 1864, President Abraham Lincoln nominated Griffin for appointment as a brevet major general of volunteers, to rank from August 1, 1864, and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on February 14, 1865.Eicher, 2001, p. 712. Griffin assumed command of V Corps during its final campaign and was present when Robert E. Lee surrendered at Appomattox Court House. In August, he was assigned command of the district of Maine, with his headquarters in Portland. On July 12, 1865, Griffin was appointed major general of volunteers to rank from April 2, 1865.Eicher, 2001, p. 701. On July 17, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Griffin for appointment as a brevet major general in the regular army, to rank from March 13, 1865, for his service at the Battle of Five Forks and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on July 23, 1866.Eicher, 2001, p. 707. Postbellum After the war, Griffin's rank reverted to colonel in the regular army, in command of the 35th U.S. Infantry. He briefly commanded the Department of Maine before being sent west to Galveston, Texas. He served as assistant commissioner of the Freedmen's Bureau for Texas in 1867, serving under Philip H. Sheridan. He became entangled in political issues and registered both black and white voters under the Reconstruction Acts in the spring of that year. He strictly enforced the ironclad oath of allegiance (forcing men to publicly swear that they had never served the Confederacy) as the basis for jury selection. Dissatisfied with the performance of appointed Governor James W. Throckmorton, Griffin persuaded General Sheridan to remove him from office and replace him with a Republican and loyal Unionist, Elisha M. Pease. Together, they used their power and position to remove several Democratic antebellum state officeholders who had supported the Confederacy, replacing them with other Unionists. Griffin was assigned command of the Fifth Military District, replacing Sheridan, and was ordered to report to New Orleans. However, before he could leave for Louisiana and his new headquarters, he died in an epidemic of yellow fever that swept through southeast Texas. He is buried at Oak Hill Cemetery in Washington, D.C.. Fort Griffin on the Texas frontier was later named in his honor.

Early career Worsley was the son of a clergyman, and first joined the Navy as a volunteer in 1803. He became a Midshipman in 1805. He was present at the Battle of Trafalgar, aboard HMS Swiftsure. Although he passed the examination for Lieutenant in 1810, owing to the large numbers of officers in the Royal Navy at the time he was still a midshipman when drafted from Bermuda in 1812 with several other officers (including Acting Commanders Robert Heriot Barclay and Daniel Pring) to serve in Canada. He was finally promoted Lieutenant on 12 July 1813. Early in 1814 he was appointed First Lieutenant of the frigate HMS Princess Charlotte on Lake Ontario and participated in the Raid on Fort Oswego. He was then appointed to command the Royal Naval detachment on Lake Huron, succeeding Lieutenant Newdigate Poyntz, who had quarrelled with the Army Commander, Lieutenant Colonel Robert McDouall, over the degree to which the Naval personnel should be subject to McDouall's orders. Engagements on Lake Huron Worsley made his way overland to the base at Nottawasaga Bay in July and took command of the only naval vessel on the lake, the commandeered schooner Nancy. Before he could sail to Fort Mackinac with urgently needed rations and powder, he was warned that an American force was lying in wait. He attempted to conceal Nancy by towing it some distance up the Nottawasaga River and constructed a blockhouse to defend the schooner. His detachment consisted of a Midshipman and twenty-one sailors of the Royal Navy, nine French Canadian voyageurs and twenty-three Ojibwa Natives. The Americans discovered the schooner's hiding place, and the Americans landed a superior force of infantry supported by artillery and ships firing \\"blind\\" over intervening sandy ridges. After a stiff resistance, Worlsey decided that the day was lost and made preparations to retreat. Either he or American shells set the schooner on fire. Both the schooner and blockhouse were destroyed. Worsley withdrew his small party unmolested, having lost one man killed and one wounded. After the Americans withdrew, he then loaded two batteaux and a canoe with some supplies which the Americans had missed and set out for Fort Mackinac. After rowing and paddling , during which passage he and his party ate only some game they shot and some fish from the lake, he spotted two American gunboats near St. Joseph Island. He concealed the batteaux and continued to Mackinac in the canoe, at one point passing only a few yards from one of the gunboats. At Mackinac, he obtained four large boats and reinforcements of marines from Lieutenant Colonel McDouall. In the early hours of 4 September, he led a successful boarding attack on the gunboat USS Tigress, which was captured after a sharp fight. Two days later, the unsuspecting USS Scorpion also fell into Worsley's hands. This secured British supremacy on Lake Huron for the remainder of the war. Later career Worsley fell ill in October with \\"Lake Fever\\", which affected many sailors on the Great Lakes during the war. He saw no further active service, although he was appointed half-pay Commander on 13 July 1815. After the war, he returned to his parental home on the Isle of Wight, and married in 1820. He and his wife had at least two sons and one daughter. In 1832 he became an Inspecting Commander in the Coastguard. He left in 1834 and died the next year. Worsley Street in the City of Barrie, Ontario, is named after him. This street crosses Poyntz Street at the southeast corner of the Barrie courthouse.

It lies to the north-east of the town of Southport on the Irish Sea estuary of the River Ribble. The area falls under West Lancashire Borough Council for administrative purposes, and Hesketh-with-Becconsall Parish Council for parochial matters. The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 4,041. It is in the South Ribble parliamentary constituency. Etymology Hesketh was first recorded in 1288 as Heschath. The name is derived either from Old Norse hest shei meaning \\"race course\\", or from a plural of the Welsh hesg, meaning \\"sedges\\". History Due to its geographical location, close to the cities of Preston and Liverpool, the village suffered during the Second World War. Stray bombs hit the old church in 1943, and landed along Becconsall Lane, causing extensive damage to the housing there. Landmarks Becconsall Old Church in April 2010 Becconsall Pub derelict in April 2010 The village has some architectural gems such as Becconsall Old Church which was hit by bomb shrapnel during World War II, All Saints Church on Station Road replaced the old church and is of some architectural significance as is the Becconsall Public House, which shut in June 2009. It has now been redeveloped as housing keeping the name alive as Becconsall Gardens. The West Lancashire Light Railway is a narrow gauge railway that is located in Hesketh Bank. Geography Hesketh Bank lies just to the north of the larger village of Tarleton and the village of Banks (North Meols). Economy Booths store under construction April 2010 on the railway station site Due to the village's position on the West Lancashire Coastal Plain it has a rich soil, suitable for the farming of flowers and vegetables - this is still the main economic activity in the area. A Booths supermarket opened on 11 November 2010. Transport The village is located just off the A59 Preston to Liverpool road and the A565 Southport Road has meant it has also developed as a commuter town. Hesketh Bank railway station was once a stop on the West Lancashire Railway, which ran between Preston and Southport. The railway opened in 1878 was closed almost a century later, in 1964.

Similar to 19th Street station, three blocks east of it, the station has two side platforms and a total of four tracks. The station serves only subway‚Äìsurface trolleys on the two outer tracks; the Market-Frankford Line subway uses the two inner tracks and bypasses the station as it travels between 15th Street and 30th Street station. The station was constructed by the Philadelphia Transit Company in 1955, a replacement for the nearby 24th Street station just north of Market Street at the east end of the now-removed shared train and trolley bridge over the Schuylkill River. The former station site is now the Crown Lights Building (a tall rectangular black skyscraper topped with 4 large LED message boards atop its upper sides), the headquarters of PECO Energy. History Eastbound platform entrance with the site of the 2013 Philadelphia building collapse in the background. 22nd Street station was opened October 15, 1955 by the Philadelphia Transportation Company (PTC), built to replace the elevated 24th Street station that was opened in 1905 by the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company (PRT) and for the first two years formed part of a subway‚Äìsurface trolley loop operating underground between and the Schuylkill River. In 1907, the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company (PRT) completed the Market Street subway‚Äìelevated line from to . It featured a bridge ‚Äì located north of Market Street and south of Filbert Street ‚Äì that carried both the subway and subway‚Äìsurface lines over the Schuylkill River. The PRT bridge connected surface trolley lines in West Philadelphia to the underground subway‚Äìsurface loop in Center City. The station at 24th Street was constructed of wood and built atop an embankment. It was the only subway‚Äìsurface station not physically underground and was located one block from the Philadelphia station of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, which served B&O; tracks running north-south along the east bank of the Schuylkill. The PRT announced a project to bury the elevated tracks between 23rd to 46th streets in the 1920s. The tunnel from 23rd to 32nd streets was completed by 1933, but construction on the remaining segment was put on hiatus due to the Great Depression and World War II. The PRT went bankrupt in 1939, and was reorganized as the PTC, which began building the rest of the tunnel in 1947. The tunnel opened for service on October 15 1955, marking the closure of the eastbound elevated station and the opening of the current underground station.UrbanRail.net (Philadelphia) The following month, on November 6, the westbound side elevated station closed. The PRT bridge that formerly had carried subway cars and subway‚Äìsurface trolleys over the river was torn down by June 20, 1956. Nothing remains of the 24th Street station. Instead, the PECO Building, headquarters of PECO Energy division of Exelon, now occupies the site. The station originally served Routes 10, 11, 31, 34, 37 and 38. Route 31 was rerouted out of the tunnel in 1949 and buses replaced trolleys on routes 37 and 38 in 1955. Routes 13 and 36 began serving the station (and the subway‚Äìsurface tunnel) in 1956. Modernization Turnstiles were constructed on the westbound platform for all-door boarding in the SEPTA Key fare collection system. As such, fares are paid prior to system entry and no fares are collected on trolleys outbound from Center City, but still must be paid at the trolley farebox inbound to Center City.

Format Alex Trebek hosts the reality style show where four young Canadians aged 18‚Äì25 are challenged by four political leaders of Canada. The four finalists debate questions posed to them by the politicians. An in-studio audience that represents the Canadian population votes throughout the show and for an ultimate winner of the competition. Prizes In the 2008 show, the winner of the competition received a $50,000 cash award and 6 month internship with Magna. Second, third and fourth place contestants each receive a cheque for $5,000 from Magna. History The televised contest, which debuted in February 2006, is the evolution of the As Prime Minister Awards essay contest, which provided a national forum for the innovative ideas of Canadian college and university students. The original As Prime Minister Awards essay contest was first founded in 1995 by Magna International Inc. Chairman Frank Stronach. Canadian college and university students were asked to submit a 2,500-word essay on what they would do as Prime Minister of Canada. With the old essay contest, ten entrants from across the country were selected as Regional Winners by a National Panel of Judges composed of accomplished Canadians with backgrounds in business, academia, media and government affairs. Each National Finalist received a $10,000 cash award, a $15,000 internship, and had his or her proposal published in a book. One of the ten students was declared the National Winner and received a $20,000 award and $50,000 internship. All in all, the contest gave away at least $320,000 in prizes, thanks largely to Magna's contribution. After over a decade of motivating Canadian youth to think about how they would create a stronger and more prosperous country, the organizers decided to change the contest format to video. In the new incarnation, the 2,500 word essay submission is replaced by a 3-5 minute video. In 2005, representatives of Magna International Inc., the Arthur Kroeger School of Public Affairs at Carleton University and The Dominion Institute judge the contest entrants and select the final five contestants who appear on the televised show. The 2005 winner, and the recipient of a $50,000 first-place cash prize, was determined by four former Canadian Prime Ministers: Brian Mulroney, Kim Campbell, Joe Clark, and John Turner. The first winner of the contest was the Sudbury, Ontario-born Deirdra McCracken. McCracken, at the time of the contest, was studying political science at Universit√© Laval in Quebec. In 2006, the show moved from CTVglobemedia to CBC Television where it was hosted by Rick Mercer and watched by one million Canadians. Representatives of Magna International, The Dominion Institute, CBC and the Fulbright Program selected four contestants to appear on the show after a cross-country university campus tour. The show aired March 2007 and was judged by four former Canadian Prime Ministers: Brian Mulroney, Kim Campbell, Joe Clark, and Paul Martin. The in-studio audience awarded first place to Quebec native Joseph Lavoie who received $50,000 and a 6 month internship with Magna International Inc. In 2007, recruitment for the next show began both in the cross-country campus tour and also online though YouTube. From YouTube videos, ten semi-finalists were selected. These semi- finalists were sent to Toronto to compete in boot camp where four finalists were chosen. CBC released boot camp footage to the public as podcasts. The 2007/2008 show aired March 23 on CBC Television and was judged by Kim Campbell, Paul Martin, John Turner, and Danny Williams. The winner was 25-year-old Metis physician Alika Lafontaine from Saskatchewan. Pam Hrick placed second, followed by Kevin Royal in third and Rahim Moloo in fourth.

No one else in cinema history has portrayed the same person as many times. In total he made over 130 films. He was elected in 1955 as the chairman of the Chinese Artist Association of Hong Kong. He was awarded the MBE (Member of the Order of the British Empire) in 1984. History Kwan was born in Guangzhou, China in 1905. He was the second child in the family. His father died of a disease at a young age. To supplement his family's income, as a boy, Kwan worked as a cowherd. When he was 12, he began work in construction. At the age of 13, he worked as a waiter in a restaurant in Singapore before joining a Cantonese opera troupe under Cheng Hsin-pei. In 1928 at the age of 23, he married Chan Yat-chor (), the daughter of the actor known only by his nickname of \\"Bind-Legged Champ\\" (), and they had a son David Kwan Hon-chuen (). His film debut was in The Singing Lovers (aka Romance of the Songsters), made in the US for the Grandview Studios and only the second Cantonese-language talkie ever made. His first starring roles came two years later in Song of the Yesterday (aka Yesterday's Song) and Song of Sadness (both 1935). Kwan's first martial arts film was Knight of the Whip (1936). During World War II he was in a troupe of patriotic entertainers and had a price put on his head by the Japanese.Logan, Bey (1995). Hong Kong Action Cinema Titan Books The first film in which he starred as Wong Fei-hung was the Story of Huang Feihong part 1 (1949) directed by Wu Pang and produced by the Yong Yao Film Company. The film included Shih Kien as the villain and Li Lan, the very first winner of the Miss Hong Kong Pageant, and the first of many winners who would become famous actresses in Hong Kong). This partnership was a huge success and spawned many sequels, exploring many ideas and situations used in later action films. In 1956, a total of 25 Wong Fei-hung films were released.Yang, Jeff. (2003). Once Upon a Time in China Atria Books Kwan worked on films with two of the students of Lam Sai-wing (himself a student of the real Wong Fei-hung). First, Leong Wing- hang, who worked as action director on Wong Fei-hung films as well as other Kwan vehicles including The Five Heroes' Deadly Spears (1951). Later he worked with Lau Cham, father of Lau Kar-leung and Lau Kar-wing. The Wong Fei-hung sequence of films ended in 1970 and Kwan went into semi-retirement. During this period, Kwan opened a martial arts school and a number of herbal centres, whose branded soup and an ointment for bruises were well known in Hong Kong.Logan, Bey. Commentary to the Hong Kong Legends edition of The Magnificent Butcher In 1974, Golden Harvest revived the role, pairing Kwan with Sammo Hung in The Skyhawk. Other films followed in which Kwan played his most familiar role ‚Äì Magnificent Butcher (1979), Magnificent Kick (1980), and Dreadnaught (1981). TVB also aired a 13-part television series featuring Kwan as Wong Fei-hung in 1976. By this time, he was in his 70s and although he was doubled for the more athletic scenes, he still demonstrated remarkable fitness and suppleness. Kwan received an honorary MBE for his charitable work and contribution to the entertainment industry, in 1984. On 5 November 1984, Kwan married his second wife Kwan Yut-chur in Reno, Nevada, whom he first met whilst travelling in the US, whilst raising money for the Chinese war effort. To the Chinese, Kwan embodied Confucian virtues and patriarchal authority, and he is thought to have modelled his speeches on those of Sun Yat-sen.Hunt, Leon. (2003). Kung Fu Cult Masters Wallflower Press Kwan appeared in cameo roles in The Family Strikes Back and Aces Go Places 4 (both 1986). His final film appearance was in the 1994 family comedy film It's a Wonderful Life!, at the age of 89, some 61 years after his acting career began. He died at the age of 91 of pancreatic cancer. In Bey Logan's audio commentary for the film The Magnificent Butcher, he states that though there is a grave marker to Kwan Tak-hing in Kowloon territory, his ashes were already taken to San Francisco to rest with those of his second wife. Action style Kwan was originally a practitioner of the Opera Martial Arts of Masters Sun Pak/Cheng Hsin-pei and Len Yuen Hang and the White Crane and Hung Gar martial art of Fok Hung. Throughout his life he made friends with famous martial arts exponents and cross trained extensively. Training in Wong Fei Hung's style of Hung Gar came from Leung Wing Hang and Lau Jam, both students of the famous Lam Sai Wing. His weapons speciality included the use of the bullwhip and the pole. Kwan was also known for his skills in the lion dance and Chinese calligraphy. Legacy Although modern martial arts films often feature a lot of violence, at the end of The Magnificent Butcher, Kwan's Wong Fei-hung saves the main villain (played by Lee Hoi-san) from being killed by Butcher Wing (Sammo Hung). This reflected Wong Fei-hung's portrayal in the original films, wherein he would defeat the villain but then heal him. Kwan became so associated with the mature Wong Fei-hung that other filmmakers would only portray the character as a younger person, including Jackie Chan playing Wong as a young man in Drunken Master (1978), and Yuen Woo-ping depicting Wong as a child (played by actress Angie Tsang) in Iron Monkey (1993). When Jet Li portrayed Wong in the Once Upon a Time in China series, many Chinese audiences felt he was too young.

The post office is located in the plaza.Grape vines growing along State Route 12 in Kenwood. Kenwood, California is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Sonoma County, California, United States, located on Sonoma Highway (State Route 12) between the cities of Santa Rosa and Sonoma. It lies east of Sonoma Creek in the upper part of Sonoma Valley, a region sometimes called the Valley of the Moon. Bennett Mountain lies west of the town, and Sugarloaf Ridge to the northeast. The population was 1,028 at the 2010 census. Kenwood is considered part of the Wine Country. Viticulturally, it lies in the Sonoma Valley AVA. The Kenwood area is known for vineyards and wineries, restaurants, and a European-style resort. An area landmark is the Kunde Estate Winery on Sonoma Highway, which was first planted in 1879. Parks Kenwood Plaza Park, located two blocks south of State Route 12 at 200 Warm Springs Road and Shaw Park, which is located at 100 Shaw Ave also off State Route 12. Both are managed by the Sonoma County Regional Parks Department. Annadel State Park lies to the west, Hood Mountain Regional Park lies to the north, and Sugarloaf Ridge State Park lies to the northeast. Further to the south lies Jack London State Historic Park. History Kenwood is located on the Rancho Los Guilicos Mexican land grant. In 1887, the Sonoma Land & Improvement Company, which owned the property on which the town now sits, laid out lots in anticipation of the railroad which would arrive the following year. The infant community tried on many names: Rohrerville, for one of the owners of the land company; Los Guilicos, and then South Los Guilicos, for the Mexican land grant. The First Congregational Church of Los Guilicos was built in 1888. It was relocated from the corner of Los Guilicos and Laurel to its present site in 1893. The parsonage was used for the Kenwood School until construction was completed in 1960. The original name of the church was changed first to Los Guilicos Congregational Church and then to its current name Kenwood Community Church. In 1981, the church was designated Historic Landmark 82 by the County of Sonoma. A number of townspeople were unhappy, complaining the \\"Guilicos\\" was hard to pronounce. Around 1895 a vote was taken to change the name again. One story says that Kenwood won because many of the settlers had come from Kenwood, Illinois. Another traces the choice to the fact that many landowners in the area were from old English families and so were familiar with London's Kenwood House. It is possible that both stories are true, and the name's permanence stemmed from its acceptability to different groups. Some notable people had ranches in the area including mining, railroad, newspaper and banking magnate, Thomas Kearns, who was also a U.S. Senator from Utah. It is reported that he entertained President Theodore Roosevelt there at the Kearns Ranch, also known as the William Hood House. The World Pillow Fight Championships originated in Kenwood in the 1970s. Two local community groups held charitable functions to help raise funds that would make improvements to the town. One of these charitable functions was the World Pillow Fighting Championships. A steel pole was made to span the Los Guilicos Spring Creek, which was then filled with mud and the Pillow Fights became an annual event. The last World Pillow Fight Championships in Kenwood were held in Plaza Park in 2006,http://www.kenwoodpress.com/pub/a/7537?full=1 and subsequent events have been held around the United States. A return to Sonoma County is planned for 2019.https://worldpillowfightchampionships.com/ Ray Flugger founded Flowmaster, Inc. in 1983 while working out of a small barn in Kenwood.

The uniforms of the British Army currently exist in twelve categories ranging from ceremonial uniforms to combat dress (with full dress uniform and frock coats listed in addition). Uniforms in the British Army are specific to the regiment (or corps) to which a soldier belongs. Full dress presents the most differentiation between units, and there are fewer regimental distinctions between ceremonial dress, service dress, barrack dress and combat dress, though a level of regimental distinction runs throughout. Senior officers, of full colonel rank and above, do not wear a regimental uniform (except when serving in the honorary position of a Colonel of the Regiment); rather, they wear their own 'staff uniform' (which includes a coloured cap band and matching gorget patches in several orders of dress). As a rule, the same basic design and colour of uniform is worn by all ranks of the same regiment (albeit often with increased embellishment for higher ranks). There are several significant uniform differences between infantry and cavalry regiments; furthermore, several features of cavalry uniform were (and are) extended to those corps and regiments deemed for historical reasons to have 'mounted status' (namely: the Royal Artillery, Royal Engineers, Royal Corps of Signals, Army Air Corps, Royal Logistic Corps and Royal Army Veterinary Corps). Full dress Line infantry full dress (Duke of Wellington's Regiment): scarlet full dress tunic of pre‚ÄìWorld War I pattern, Home Service helmet of 1878. Full dress is the most elaborate and traditional order worn by the British Army. It generally consists of a scarlet, dark blue or rifle green high-necked tunic (without chest pockets), elaborate headwear and other colourful items. It was withdrawn from a general issue in 1914, but is still listed in the Army Dress Regulations, which speaks of it as \\"the ultimate statement of tradition and regimental identity in uniform\\" and the \\"key\\" to all other orders of dress. Each regiment and corps has its own pattern, approved by the Army Dress Committee. They are generally a modified version of the pre-1914 uniforms. In the case of units created since the First World War, such as the Army Air Corps, the Full Dress order incorporates both traditional and modern elements. Troopers of the King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery in their blue light cavalry-style full dress uniform Full dress is still regularly worn on ceremonial occasions by the Foot Guards, the Household Cavalry and the King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery. It is issued at public expense to these units and to the various Corps of Army Music Bands for ceremonial use.\\\\--> Other units may obtain Full Dress on occasion, as it can be worn whenever a parade is attended or ordained by the monarch or a member of the British Royal Family, including ceremonial parades, state funerals, and public duties around royal residences (such as the Changing of the Guard), or participating in the Lord Mayor's Show. Lancers forming a guard of honour in full dress Most regiments maintain full dress for limited numbers of personnel, including musicians and guards of honour (in some cases). However, all of these uniforms must be purchased and maintained from non-public funds. Historically, musicians were an important means of communication on the battlefield and wore distinctive uniforms for easy identification. This is recalled in the extra uniform lace worn by infantry regiments' corps of drums, and the different coloured helmet plumes worn by trumpeters in the Household Cavalry. Shoulder 'wings', which were originally used to distinguish specialist companies in line infantry battalions (grenadiers or light infantry) are now a distinguishing feature worn by musicians of non-mounted regiments and corps in ceremonial forms of dress. Headgear, as worn with full dress, differs considerably from the peaked caps and berets worn in other orders of dress: field marshals, generals, lieutenant generals, major generals, brigadiers and colonels wear cocked hats with varying amounts of ostrich feathers according to rank; the Life Guards, Blues and Royals, 1st Queen's Royal Dragoon Guards and Royal Dragoon Guards wear metal helmets with plumes, the plumes variously coloured to distinguish them. The Kings Royal Hussars, Queen's Royal Hussars, Light Dragoons, and the Royal Horse Artillery wear a black fur busby, with different coloured plumes and bags (this is the coloured lining of the busby that is pulled out and displayed on the left-hand side of the headdress), as do the Royal Regiment of Artillery and the Royal Signals, despite not being hussar regiments. As the uniforms of Rifles regiments traditionally aped those of the hussars, a somewhat similar lambskin busby is worn by The Rifles and the Royal Gurkha Rifles, with coloured plumes to distinguish them. However, these busbies do not feature bags like in their hussar counterparts. The Royal Lancers; as well as the band of the Royal Yeomanry, feature the czapka, or 'lancer's cap'. The plumes and top of this headgear historically distinguished the various Lancer regiments. The Grenadier Guards, Coldstream Guards, Scots Guards, Irish Guards, Welsh Guards and Royal Scots Dragoon Guards wear bearskins, as do officers of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers; whose other ranks, however, wear the flat-topped fusilier cap. The Royal Regiment of Scotland wears the feathered bonnet, as do pipers in the Scots Guards and Royal Scots Dragoon Guards. The Princess of Wales' Royal Regiment, Mercian Regiment, Duke of Lancaster's Regiment, Royal Anglian Regiment, Yorkshire Regiment, and Royal Welsh, as Line infantry regiments, wear the dark blue Home Service Helmet with a spike ornament on top, as do the Royal Engineers, Adjutant General's Corps and Corps of Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. The Royal Logistic Corps, Royal Army Medical Corps, Royal Army Veterinary Corps and Royal Army Dental Corps wear the Home Service Helmet, but with a ball ornament on the top rather than a spike. The Royal Gibraltar Regiment wear a white helmet with a spike ornament on the top. The Royal Tank Regiment, Army Air Corps, Parachute Regiment, Special Air Service, Intelligence Corps and the Special Reconnaissance Regiment wear berets; as they do with all orders of dress. The Royal Irish Regiment, as well as the pipers of the Queen's Royal Hussars wear the caubeen. Not all full-dress uniforms are scarlet; light cavalry regiments (hussars, light dragoons and lancers) and the Royal Artillery have worn blue since the 18th century, while rifle regiments wear green. The seven support corps and departments in existence in 1914 all wore dark blue dress uniforms, with different coloured facings. Hussar and Rifle regiments' tunics feature cording across the chest, while that of the Royal Lancers and Army Air Corps features a plastron in the facing colours.Major R. M. Barnes, Plates XX and XXII \\"A History of the Regiments & Uniforms of the British Army\\", First Sphere Books edition 1792 Facings Each regiment and corps of the British Army has an allotted facing colour according to Part 14 Section 2 Annex F of the British Army dress regulations. Where full dress is currently not used, the notional colours can be ascertained by the colours of the mess dress; if the regiment in question has not been amalgamated with another. The Intelligence Corps, SAS and SRR have no design on record for full dress, and the Intelligence Corps mess dress colour of cypress green would make this unlikely for full dress, and the full dress facing colours of the SAS and SRR can be inferred from their beret colours (like the Parachute Regiment) according to this section of the regulations. The London Regiment and existing Yeomanry regiments have a variety of colours for their various sub-units. Blue: The Life Guards, 1st The Queen's Dragoon Guards, The Royal Dragoon Guards, The Queen's Royal Lancers, Foot Guards Regiments, The Royal Regiment of Scotland, The Royal Welsh, Adjutant General's Corps, Honourable Artillery Company (Artillery dress), Royal Monmouthshire Royal Engineers Scarlet: The Blues and Royals, Queen's Royal Hussars, Royal Horse Artillery, Royal Artillery, The Rifles, Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, Educational and Training Services (part of Adjutant General's Corps), Royal Military Police (part of Adjutant General's Corps) Royal Army Physical Training Corps, Corps of Army Music, Honourable Artillery Company (Infantry dress), The Royal Yeomanry Yellow: Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment.

They are a knee-length, dark blue, double-breasted coat with velvet collar and cuffs. It is usually worn with the peaked cap but is occasionally worn with a cocked hat by certain office- holders.http://www.army.mod.uk/documents/general/Rifles_Dress_Guidance__2012_Srl_7.pdf A different type of frock coat is worn by certain officers of the Household Division, Honourable Artillery Company and King's Troop of the Royal Horse Artillery. These are also dark blue but are single-breasted and with ornate black braiding and loops. Similar braided coats are worn on occasion by directors of music and bandmasters of bands affiliated to line cavalry regiments (in other bands they wear a plainer double-breasted frock coat similar to that of senior officers but without the velvet) in dark blue (or green for The Rifles). Numbered orders of dress A selection of uniforms mostly worn in the British Army as worn by the Yorkshire Regiment. Note: the Yorkshire regiment does not wear number 3 uniforms. Fourteen numbered 'orders' of dress (in addition to full dress) are set out in Army Dress Regulations but many of these are rarely worn or have been phased out altogether. Numbers 5 and 9 have been replaced by the new 'Personal Clothing System' Combat Uniform (or PCS-CU for short). Several orders of dress are only issued to officers (and senior non-commissioned officers in some cases); others are only issued to personnel serving in particular climates or specific roles. No.1: Temperate ceremonial No. 1 Dress, or \\"dress blues\\", is a ceremonial uniform, worn on only the most formal of occasions and by senior staff officers, aides to the Royal Family, and to the personal staff of senior officers in command. It is not generally issued to all units, with the khaki No. 2 Dress functioning as the main parade uniform. No. 1 dress originated in the \\"undress\\" uniforms ('blue Patrols') worn for semi-formal or ordinary duty occasions in the late 19th century. It was first issued in its current form for the 1937 Coronation, intended as a cheaper alternative to the full dress uniforms that had been generally withdrawn after 1914. It became known as No. 1 Dress in 1947. Army units participating in the 1953 Coronation wore the new uniform as a temporary issue. For most units, No. 1 dress consists of regimental headdress, dark blue tunic, trousers, overalls (tight-fitting trousers historically worn by mounted troops), or skirts (worn with tights). Units are distinguished by badges and the colours of the cap, tunic piping, vertical stripes (\\"welts\\") on the trousers, and the colour of the collar for certain cavalry regiments. The tunic and trousers of the Royal Gurkha Rifles are rifle green. The Rifles wear a rifle green tunic with black trousers. The Royal Dragoon Guards and the King's Royal Hussars wear dark green and crimson overalls respectively. Cavalry regiments wear shoulder chains in place of shoulder straps. The Royal Regiment of Scotland wears a short jacket called a \\"doublet\\", in Archer Green. Prior to amalgamation, Highland regiments wore the doublet with the kilt and sporran while Lowland regiments wore trews, both in the individual regiment's tartan. In the full ceremonial order of No. 1 Dress, officers wear a waist sash of crimson silk and twisted cord epaulettes; while general officers wear a waist sash of gold and crimson stripes. Light cavalry regiments wear a lace crossbelt in place of the sash, while Rifle regiments wear a polished black leather crossbelt, as do the Special Air Service Regiment and Royal Army Chaplains Department (who have a unique pattern of tunic that features an open step collar instead of a mandarin collar). Other ranks wear a white, buff or black leather belt with a regimental pattern locket, with a bayonet frog if carrying arms. The peaked forage cap is worn by most regiments; berets are worn by the Royal Tank Regiment, Army Air Corps, Parachute Regiment, Special Air Service and Intelligence Corps. Berets are also worn by officers and other ranks of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, and by other ranks of the Royal Welsh with feather hackles, recalling the plumes worn on the full dress busby. The Royal Regiment of Scotland wear a regimental glengarry with cockfeathers taken from the former ceremonial uniform of the Royal Scots and the King's Own Scottish Borderers, the Royal Irish Regiment wear the caubeen, while the Brigade of Gurkhas wear a round Kilmarnock cap. The above headdress is also worn as part of Numbers 3, 10 and 11 dress (and with Number 2 and 6 dress on formal parades).

No.2 dress consists, for most corps and regiments, of a khaki jacket, shirt and tie with trousers or a skirt. The Royal Regiment of Scotland wear a special pattern of jacket with a cut away front, worn with a regimental tartan kilt or trews. Coloured trousers are worn by some units: crimson by the King's Royal Hussars, dark green by the Royal Irish Regiment and Royal Dragoon Guards. All officers and other ranks now wear the same style and colour of Service Dress and it is issued free to all. Officers are required to purchase the caps, belts and shoes for which they are given a cash grant. The only variations of the standard jacket are the jackets worn by the Foot Guards whose buttons are grouped differently depending on their regiment, and the Royal Regiment of Scotland who wear a \\"cutaway\\" form of the jacket to be worn with kilts. Regimental distinctions worn on No.2 dress can include collar badges (sometimes with coloured cloth backings), coloured lanyards worn on the shoulder, arm badges, and unusually for the Educational and Training Services Branch blue socks are worn. Regimental buttons are worn; for most units, these are of gold colour, with black buttons worn by The Rifles, Royal Gurkha Rifles and Royal Army Chaplains Department, silver by the Special Air Service, Special Reconnaissance Regiment, Honourable Artillery Company and Small Arms School Corps and bronze by the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment. Officers and Warrant Officers Class One of some (but not all) regiments and corps wear a leather Sam Browne belt (that of 1st The Queen's Dragoon Guards is of pig skin which is not to be highly polished) or a cross belt. Infantry Warrant Officers Class Two and SNCOs wear a scarlet (for WOs) or crimson (for SNCOs) sash over the right shoulder to the hip. Soldiers wear a white or black plastic waist belt with a plate buckle displaying the regimental badge in ceremonial uniform ‚Äì a plain khaki belt in non-ceremonial. Every regular army soldier is issued with one suit of No.2 dress. In general, issue of this order of dress to units of the Army Reserves is to all officers and SNCOs with pools of khaki uniforms being held by units for use by corporals and below.The Defence Supply Chain Manual, JSP 336 (3rd Edition), Volume 12, Pamphlet 7, Clothing regulations and scales Territorial Army (all ranks) In the ceremonial form of No.2 dress, the headdress is the same as that worn with No.1 dress, with the exceptions of the Brigade of Gurkhas (who wear the slouch hat); and of officers of The Queen's Royal Hussars who wear their \\"tent hat\\" (the only headdress worn without a cap badge or other distinction). On 'informal parades' officers in Nos 2 or 6 dress may wear a peaked khaki cap (which may also be worn with Nos 4, 7, 12, 13 and 14 dress); this item is not generally issued to other ranks (who would wear the beret or equivalent on these occasions) except those in HCMR and King's Troop RHA. Another item of headwear authorized (but not provided) for optional wear on informal parades in Nos 2 or 6 dress is the side cap (Wedge); it may also optionally be worn with Nos 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13 and 14 dress.

With the introduction of No.1 Dress in temperate regions, No. 3 Dress was adopted as the tropical equivalent during the early 1950s. It comprised an all-white cotton drill high-collared tunic, cut in a similar fashion to the No. 1 dress jacket, plus white trousers. These were worn with the coloured No.1 dress cap. No. 3 dress was typically issued temporarily, being withdrawn from units on leaving the station. This order of dress dates back to white drill uniforms worn for \\"hot- weather\\" ceremonial and off-duty wear in India prior to World War I.R.M. Barnes, page 281 \\"A History of the Regiments & Uniforms of the British Army\\" First Sphere Books 1972 Since the 1970s this order has consisted of the same white tunic but is now worn with coloured No. 1 dress trousers.Paragraph 16, Dress Regulations for the Mercian Regiment, January 2009 Head-dress, footwear and badges are generally as for No. 1 dress. Widely worn during the 1950s and 1960s (when Britain still maintained significant garrisons in tropical stations) this uniform is now usually restricted to military attach√©s in tropical postings and their personal staffs;Royal Artillery Standing Orders: part 5 ‚Äì Dress units of the Royal Gibraltar Regiment and The Royal Bermuda Regiment (see below); plus a few army bands and officers of the battalion of the Royal Gurkha Rifles stationed in Brunei. The band of the Royal Gibraltar Regiment is entitled to a permanent issue of No. 3 dress. The Royal Bermuda Regiment, which has many ceremonial duties, issued No. 3 Dress as a summer uniform until the end of the millennium, wearing No. 1 Dress (with red facings) during the rest of the year due to the cold and often stormy weather. As most of its public ceremonial duties fall during the summer months, it now wears No. 3 Dress year-round, with No. 1 Dress worn only as authorized by the Commanding Officer.Royal Bermuda Regiment: Quick Reference Guide to the different Orders of Dress Image:Queens birthday.JPG|The Royal Gibraltar Regiment at the parade for the Queen's Birthday (Trooping the Colour), Grand Casemates Square, Gibraltar in No. 3 Dress Image:Royal Bermuda Regiment at St. James' Church in Somerset.jpg|Royal Bermuda Regiment at St James' Church in Somerset in No. 3 Dress No.4: Warm weather Service Dress (officers only) No.4 dress. Issued to officers on first posting to a warm-weather area: the uniform is similar to No.2 dress but in a stone-coloured polyester / woollen worsted mix. No.4 dress may be worn on formal occasions when not on parade with troops. When officers are taking part in parades and formations with other ranks in warm weather areas, they wear either No.3 or No.6 dress. There had been an Other Ranks pattern of warm weather Service Dress, but this fell out of use after the 1950s. No.6: Warm weather parade uniform (bush jacket) The \\"bush jacket\\" uniform (in Australia, this is known as the \\"safari uniform\\"). It is issued to all officers and ORs on posting to a warm- weather station. It consists of a tan bush-style four-button jacket worn with or without a shirt and tie underneath and tan trousers. It is worn by all ranks for parades (as with No. 2 Dress), unless No. 3 dress is worn, and by ORs for all other occasions. No.7: Warm weather barrack dress The tropical shirt-and-trousers uniform, consisting of a stone-coloured short- sleeve shirt worn with stone-coloured trousers (tartan kilt or trews for Scottish regiments), and regimental headgear. Regimental/Corps stable belts may be worn in this order of dress. No.8: Combat Dress The current No.8 Dress, which was introduced as part of Project PECOC in 2011, is known as Personal Clothing System ‚Äì Combat Uniform (PCS-CU); it is based around a Multi-Terrain Pattern (MTP) windproof smock, a lightweight jacket and trousers with a range of ancillaries such as thermals and waterproofs. Prior to 2011 separate designs of combat dress were provided for use in desert, temperate and tropical regions (numbered 5, 8 and 9, respectively, in the uniform regulations) all of which were replaced by PCS-CU. PCS-CU is designed to be lightweight, yet durable enough to be used throughout rigorous activities soldiers find themselves performing, and with the idea that layers of clothing are warmer and more flexible than a single thick layer. The PCS-CU jacket is always worn loose, with sleeves rolled down; however, an MTP pattern shirt was introduced in 2015 and this may be worn during the Summer months tucked into the trousers with sleeves rolled up. While the shirt may be worn during the winter months, it is always worn with the sleeves rolled down. Some Regiments and Corps wear a stable belt in No 8 dress whilst others restrict its use to Nos 13 and 14 Dress. On exercises and operations the stable belt is replaced with a plain green field belt, with nylon Personal Load Carrying Equipment and the Osprey body armour vest with pouches attached using the PALS system being worn for load-bearing purposes. In the twentieth century the British army introduced Tactical Recognition Flashes (TRFs) ‚Äì worn on the right arm of a combat uniform, this distinctive insignia denotes the wearer's regiment or corps (or subdivision thereof, these being the ALS, ETS, RMP, MPGS, and SPS, in the case of the AGC). Working headdress is normally worn, which is typically a beret. The colour of the beret usually shows what type of regiment the wearer is from. The colours are as follows: * Khaki: Mercian Regiment, Foot Guards, Honourable Artillery Company, Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment, Royal Anglian Regiment, Duke of Lancaster's Regiment, Royal Welsh, Yorkshire Regiment, Royal Gibraltar Regiment, 4/73 (Sphinx) Special Observation Post Battery RA * Light grey: Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, Scottish and North Irish Yeomanry * Dark grey: Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps * Brown: King's Royal Hussars, Royal Wessex Yeomanry * Black: Royal Tank Regiment, Westminster Dragoons Squadron, Royal Yeomanry * Dark (Rifle) green: The Royal Dragoon Guards, The Queen's Royal Hussars (with broad browband), The Rifles, Royal Gurkha Rifles, Small Arms School Corps, Essex Yeomanry * Maroon: Parachute Regiment, all ranks serving with 16 Air Assault Brigade (not restricted to Parachute qualified personnel) other than the non‚ÄìParachute Regiment Infantry Battalion or Army Air Corps and attached Arms personnel * Beige: Special Air Service including attached troops who are not SAS-qualified * Emerald grey:Royal Air Force Regiment Association, Birmingham Branch Newsletter Issue No. 267, September 2011, Page 6 Special Reconnaissance Regiment * Commando green: Commando qualified personnel serving in Commando units (including the Special Boat Service) * Cypress green: Intelligence Corps * Cambridge blue: Army Air Corps including attached personnel and REME Aircraft trades, 47 Regiment Royal Artilleryhttps://twitter.com/47regtra?lang=enhttps://www.facebook.com/47RegtRA/photos/pcb.2242219535889727/2242219099223104/?type=3&theater; * Scarlet: Royal Military Police * Green: Adjutant General's Corps (except Royal Military Police, who wear scarlet; Military Provost Staff, Educational and Training Services Branch and Army Legal Service, who wear navy blue), Military Provost Guard Service * Dark blue: all other Army units (except Scottish line infantry regiments and the Royal Irish Regiment) 24 Commando (Engineer) Regiment wear the Royal Engineer cap badge on a green Commando beret. A regiment or corps cap badge is worn on the beret or other headdress worn in No. 8 Dress. The badge is positioned above the left eye when a beret or a caubeen is worn; the badge worn on the Tam O'Shanter sits above the left ear. Uniquely D (London Irish Rifles) Company of The London Regiment wear their cap badge over the right eye, on their caubeen. Troops from other services, regiments or corps on attachment to units with distinctive coloured berets often wear the latter with their own cap badge. Colonels, brigadiers and generals usually continue to wear the beret of the regiment or corps to which they used to belong with the cap badge distinctive to their rank. The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers wears a feather hackle on the beret, they are now the only infantry regiment to wear the navy blue beret. Hackles are also worn by other regiments with Fusilier heritage: e.g. other ranks of the Royal Welsh wear white hackles on their berets (inherited from the Royal Welch Fusiliers. The Royal Regiment of Scotland and the Royal Irish Regiment, instead of the beret, wear the Tam O'Shanter and the caubeen respectively, both of which feature hackles. The Tam O'Shanter is also worn by some UOTCs and Army Reserve units in Scotland. 4th Mechanised Brigade in Afghanistan, 2013. 7th Parachute Regiment Royal Horse Artillery training in Germany in 2016 Prior to the adoption of PCS-CU, the beret was often substituted by the Mk 6 Combat Helmet with a DPM cover (or desert DPM if worn with No.5 Dress); this has since been replaced by the Mk 7 helmet with an MTP cover and some scrim netting for the insertion of additional camouflage. In jungle conditions, the helmet is usually substituted by an MTP bush hat ‚Äì or equally, in cold conditions, an MTP peaked hat (Cap, Extreme Cold Weather), a rolled woollen tube known as a cap comforter, or other specialized headgear. When the British Army finds itself in peacekeeping roles, regimental headdress is worn (where the tactical situation allows) in preference to the helmet or MTP hat, in order to appear less hostile to local civilians. When working for the United Nations, soldiers will wear the pale blue UN beret. No.10: Temperate mess dress The British Army's temperate mess dress includes a waist-length short jacket, with which men wear trousers, overalls or a kilt; and for women a long skirt. No. 10 dress is normally worn by sergeants and above for formal evening functions. Colours vary greatly from unit to unit but generally match those of the traditional full dress of the regiment or corps. Thus mess jackets can be scarlet, dark blue or green with facings and waistcoats in regimental colours. Two basic patterns of jacket are worn: the high collared \\"cavalry\\" style and the open-fronted one with lapels formerly worn by officers of infantry regiments. The version of No. 10 dress worn by officers frequently includes elaborate braiding on the waistcoats. Mess dress was derived from the shell jacket (infantry) or stable jacket (cavalry): a short, working jacket in full- dress colours, which 19th-century officers paired with a uniform waistcoat for evening wear. No.11: Warm weather mess dress A white jacket is substituted for the coloured one of temperate mess dress. Waistcoats are not worn. No.12: Protective clothing This order of dress includes various types of protective clothing ranging from the standard overalls to specialist kit worn by aircrews, chefs, medics and others. No. 12 also covers whatever day-to-day working dress may be authorised at a local or regimental level. Formerly an olive green shirt and trousers were often worn, but this has been replaced with combat dress shirt and trousers worn with beret and stable belt (identical to that of No. 7 Dress). No.13: Temperate barrack dress Royal Irish Rangers: soldiers and officers in Numbers 8, 14, 10, 1, 2 and 12 orders of dress, flanked by a bandsman, bugler, piper and drummer in versions of (rifles) full-dress. Khaki barrack dress trousers (as issued under the Future Army Dress (FAD) programme) and the standard issued shirt from No.2 dress with pullover. The stable belt is often worn: a wide belt, made of tough woven fabric. The fabric of the belt itself is in regimental colours, either a single colour or striped along its length (the origin of these combinations is often traditional, derived from historic uniform colours and facings, and may coincide with the design of a particular unit's TRF).

Obsolete No.5: Battledress (1939‚Äì1961) A British soldier of the Royal Artillery, in No 5 Dress Sergeant of the Royal Bermuda Regiment (right) in No. 9 Dress with a Jamaica Defence Force soldier Battle Dress refers to the combat utility uniform issued from 1939 to the early 1960s that replaced No.2 Service Dress. It is often incorrectly called the \\"Pattern 37 uniform\\" from the pattern of web gear and accessories introduced earlier in 1937. It consisted of a short jacket called a blouse and high-waisted trousers made of khaki wool serge worn with a beret or side-cap. It was also issued in RAF Blue-Grey for the Royal Air Force, Navy Blue for the Royal Navy / Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve and Dark Blue for the Civil Defence Corps. Officers were permitted to have the collar of the BD jacket tailored to have faced lapels, allowing the wearing of a shirt and tie underneath, inspiring the later American M44 'Ike Jacket'. Originally introduced in 1939, design modifications were made in 1940 (Austerity Pattern), 1942 (Pattern 40), and 1949 (Pattern 49). It became a barracks and walking-around dress with the introduction of the Jungle Green combat dress uniforms in the mid-1940s and is synonymous with the British soldier of the 1940s and 50s. Battledress had some drawbacks. The uniform was designed for the temperate climate of the United Kingdom or Northern Europe. It was found too heavy for wear in summer, the sunnier climate of Southern Europe (like the Mediterranean Theatre) or in tropical or jungle climates (like the Pacific Theatre). Conversely it was too lightweight for cold weather or high altitudes (like Korea). It was also very difficult to iron due to the complex series of pleats. It became obsolete in 1961 and No.2 Service Dress was reintroduced in its place in 1962 for barracks and parade use. No.5: Desert combat dress Desert combat clothing is listed as; hat, jacket and trousers DPM and were issued to soldiers and other British military personnel posted to Cyprus, the Middle East and Afghanistan. As issued in the 1991 Gulf War, this uniform was identical to the No. 9 DPM tropical uniform, except for the multi- tone desert camouflage. This was quickly replaced with a two-tone desert version of DPM camouflage (the base colour and one other). Smocks were also available in the desert DPM, including the SAS pattern windproof smock. Covers for combat helmets and body armour were also made in this camouflage prior to their replacement by Multi-Terrain Pattern (MTP) camouflage. Since 2011, No 5 Dress has no longer been issued due to the introduction of the Personal Clothing System ‚Äì Combat Uniform (PCS-CU). No.9: Tropical Combat Dress No.9 dress is no longer provided, being replaced by PCS-CU. It was made from cotton or poly-cotton DPM material of a lighter weight than pre-Combat Soldier 95 No 8 Dress. The jacket was similar in cut to a shirt and had epaulettes fitted to the shoulders. Its sleeves could be rolled above the elbow and the shirt tucked into the trousers for a smarter appearance for example in barracks. There is a large pocket on each breast, closed with a button-down flap, and a first field dressing pocket on one sleeve. This uniform was normally worn with a DPM bush hat; out of the field, regimental headdress was often worn. The trousers had button down belt loops when carrying equipment was not worn, a uniform belt was worn in these loops. History Red coats Prior to the English Civil War of 1642‚Äì51 the only significant instances of uniform dress in British military culture occurred in small bodyguard units, notably the Yeoman of the Guard. Other than these royal bodyguards, there was no standing English Army before the English Civil War, only the permanent, but part-time, Militia for home defence and temporary forces raised for expeditions abroad. Scotland, which remained independent from England until the 1707 Acts of Union created the Kingdom of Great Britain, also raised a standing Scottish Army after the English Civil War (known in Scotland and Ireland as the Wars of the Three Kingdoms), which merged with the English Army in 1707 to create the British Army. During the Civil War the Parliamentary New Model Army adopted a fairly standardized pattern of red clothing, a practice which continued with the small regular English Army of the Restoration period. The Scottish Army initially appears to have issued grey uniforms but began to imitate English Army practice by adopting red uniforms from the 1680s. By the end of the 17th century, the colour of the uniforms of the English Army was largely settled on red with few exceptions. Red tunics became the norm for line infantry, including foot guards, and certain other units. The practice of distinguishing regiments by different facings was in general use by the early 18th century. In the decades after the end of the Napoleonic Wars, British Army uniforms trended towards extravagance rather than practicality. That trend was reversed during the Crimean War with the adoption of looser fitting tunics and more practical headdresses. At the time, the Royal Artillery, Royal Engineers, Royal Sappers and Miners, and the Commissariat Department and transport organs were not part of the British Army but of the Board of Ordnance. After the Crimean War, the Board of Ordnance was abolished and these units (with the Royal Sappers and Miners having been amalgamated into the Royal Engineers) and the Commissariat, stores and transport organs (re-organized ultimately into the Army Ordnance Corps and the Army Service Corps, both since amalgamated into today's Royal Logistic Corps), were transferred to the British Army. The Royal Artillery wore dark blue tunics. Red tunics were however retained by the Royal Engineers (the pre-Crimean War, officer-only Royal Engineers and the Corps of Royal Sappers and Miners, made up of other-ranks, originally wore blue jackets, but first wore red during the Napoleonic Wars), line infantry and most other units, including cavalry, except in India where drab coloured garments were introduced in 1848\\"Khaki Uniform 1848‚Äì49: First Introduction by Lumsden and Hodson\\", Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research, JSAHR 82 (Winter 2004) pp 341‚Äì347 and worn increasingly from 1857 on. General issue of full dress uniforms ceased at the start of the First World War. The Household Division resumed wearing their scarlet and blue full dress in 1920, but for the remainder of the Army it was only worn by regimental bands, or else on certain limited social or ceremonial occasions (an example of the latter was the 1937 Coronation when mounted detachments from participating cavalry regiments were issued with full dress uniforms for the occasion). The reason for not generally reintroducing the distinctive full dress between the wars was primarily financial, as the scarlet cloth required expensive red cochineal dye.

File:The Manchester Regiment by Harry Payne.jpg|The Manchester Regiment in the last generally worn full dress uniform of 1914. Not all Full Dress uniforms were (or are) scarlet. Historically, the great bulk of the British Army wore red or scarlet (with the Royal Artillery distinctive in blue). In the early nineteenth century, the success of √©lite Hungarian Hussars and Polish Lancers inspired the creation of similar units in other European armies, which also adopted their highly-distinctive forms of dress; in the British Army, these light cavalry uniforms were mostly dark blue. At the same time, the formation of regiments of Riflemen (who had always worn dark green rather than red, for reasons of camouflage) led to the full-dress use of 'Rifle green' uniforms in Rifle regiments. Line Infantry regiments though invariably wore scarlet, as did heavy cavalry (with the exception of the Royal Horse Guards ('The Blues') and the 6th Dragoon Guards).Major R.M. Barnes, pages 295‚Äì296 \\"A History of the Regiments & Uniforms of the British Army\\", First Sphere Books 1972 Khaki In January 1902, the British army adopted a universal khaki uniform for home service wear, the Service Dress, after experience with lighter khaki drill in India and South Africa. The traditional scarlet, blue and green uniforms were retained for full dress and off duty \\"walking out dress\\" wear. Details of these colourful uniforms varied greatly between regiments and branches of the army. The early use of camouflage in the form of plain khaki reflected the exigencies of colonial war and the freedom allowed, and taken, by many of the officers who fought it. The adoption of khaki for active service resulted from the development of weapons of greater accuracy range combined with smokeless powder during the late 19th century, making low-visibility on the battlefield a matter of priority.

Battledress and camouflage In 1938, the British Army adopted a revolutionary and practical type of uniform for combat known as Battledress; it was widely copied and adapted by armies around the world.Kannik, Preben (1968), Military Uniforms of the World in Colour, Blandford Press Ltd, (p. 245) During the Second World War a handful of British units adopted camouflage-patterned clothes, for example the Airborne Forces' Denison smock and the windproof suit. In the late 1960s, the Disruptive Pattern Material (DPM) camouflage uniform was adopted across the whole of the British Army. It remained in service, with periodical updates, for the next 40 years. From 2009 it began to be replaced by a new Multi-Terrain Pattern (MTP) uniform. This \\"Personal Clothing System (Combat Uniform)\\" has been developed for use across the British Armed Services, making use of the latest in clothing technology. Unlike the different versions of DPM issued for use in different terrains, the new MTP kit is issued in just one version, designed to function effectively across a variety of terrains, meeting a need identified in recent combat experience.

Discovery and naming Cretaceous-aged dinosaur fossil localities of Mongolia; Graciliceratops fossils have been collected near Sainshand at area D (right) The holotype, ZPAL MgD-I/156, was discovered at the Bayan Shireh Formation in Mongolia, coming from the Sheeregeen Gashoon locality near Sainshand. The discoveries were made during field exploration by the Polish-Mongolian Palaeontological Expedition, in 1971. Four years later, in 1975, the specimen was described by Teresa Marya≈Ñska and Halszka Osm√≥lska and referred to the genus Microceratops. However, Paul Sereno noted that the referral for this specimen was injustified and overall, the genus lacked diagnosis, therefore, Microceratops (now named Microceratus) was considered a nomen dubium. The referred specimen was redescribed by him, creating a new genus and species: Graciliceratops mongoliensis. The holotype is fragmentary, consisting of a very fragmented skull with mandibles; vertebrae, 4 cervicals, 12 dorsals and 7 sacrals; right scapula; proximal end of left scapula; left coracoid; right humerus, radius and fragmentary ulna; proximal and distal end of left humerus; proximal fragments of both pubis; fragments of both illium and fragment of right ischium; right femur, tibia and nearly complete pes; distal part of left tibia, fragmentary left pes; tarsals and isolated ribs. The generic name, Graciliceratops, is derived from the Latin gracilis (meaning slender) and the Greek Œ∫Œ≠œÅŒ±œÑŒø (k√©rato, meaning horn) in reference to its fragile build. Lastly, the specific name, mongolienses, is to emphasize the place of its discovery: Mongolia. Description Life restoration Although very damaged, the skull measures approximately , the arches and centra of the sacral vertebrae are not fused, which indicates that this specimen was not fully grown when it died, probably a juvenile individual. Its size is estimated at long with a weight between . Genus List for Holtz 2012 Weight Information However, due to the immature nature of the specimen, the adult size is estimated around , or similar to Protoceratops. The frill has large fenestrae bounded by very slender struts. This structure is very similar to that of the later Protoceratops. Graciliceratops is recognised by the fragile frill and characteristic tibial-femoral ratio (1.2:1); the frill is also briefly elongated with well developed squamosal processes. Seven sacral vertebrae were identified and not fused. The scapula is very gracile in constitution but thicker at the glenoid, with a relatively large coracoid; the humerus is also very slender. The femur measures , it is lightly curved and has a large head; the fourth trochanter is fragile and place above the midlength of the femoral end. Being larger than the femur, the tibia measures and its proximal articulation is more developed than distally. The right pes is virtually complete, only lacking the distal end of the IV metatarsal. The pedal unguals are dorsoventrally flattened and somewhat sharply-developed. Classification During the description of Aquilops in 2014, an extensive Ceratopsia phylogenetic analysis was conducted. Graciliceratops was found to be a basal neoceratopsian. Below are the results obtained for the Neoceratopsia: Paleoecology Graciliceratops was unearthed from the Sheeregeen Gashoon beds, which are part of the Upper Bayan Shireh. The presence of caliche, fluvial and lacustrine sediments, indicate a semiarid climate with rivers and large lakes around the zone. Fossilized fruits have also been recovered from the upper and lower parts of the formation, suggesting the existence of Angiosperm plants. Magnetostratigraphic and calcite U‚ÄìPb analyses indicate that the formation lies within the Cretaceous Long Normal, which was deposited until the end of the Santonian around 95.9 ¬± 6.0 million to 89.6 ¬± 4.0 million years ago. It lived alongside other reptiles from the upper part, most notably the large dromaeosaurid Achillobator, the tyrannosauroid Alectrosaurus, therizinosaurs Erlikosaurus and Segnosaurus, the pachycephalosaur Amtocephale; ankylosaurs Talarurus and Tsagantegia, the large sauropod Erketu and the basal hadrosauroid Gobihadros. Additional paleofauna has been recovered, expanding the aquatic biodiversity: Paralligator, Lindholmemys and the shark Hybodus. The discoveries of azhdarchids pterosaurs have been reported from at least two locations, compromising mainly cervical vertebrae.

He occasionally experimented with microtonality. Life and career Taught by Henk Badings, Olivier Messiaen and others, and in his youth influenced by B√©la Bart√≥k, De Leeuw was a teacher at the University of Amsterdam and later professor of composition and electronic music at the Sweelinck Conservatory in Amsterdam from 1959 to 1986, at which institute he served as director from 1971‚Äì73. For his notable students, \\"When I was quite young I once accidentally tuned in on a radio broadcast from an Arabian station. I was thunderstruck: I became deeply aware that there were other people living on this earth, living in thoroughly different conditions, having other thoughts and feelings\\" (Ton de Leeuw, 1978). He studied ethnomusicology with Jaap Kunst between 1950 and 1954 [Author], [Title], Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Music and Musicians, seventh edition, edited by Nicolas Slonimsky (New York: Schirmer Books; London: Collier Macmillan, 1984) and the encounter with the Dagar brothers and Drupad on his first visit to India in 1961 deepened a lifelong interest in \\"transculturation\\". Since then he has travelled throughout the world: Japan, Indonesia, Australia, the Philippines, Persia, the Sovjet Union, Hungary, Bulgaria and Finland, where he hold workshops and lectures on the East-West relationship in music. In the seventies De Leeuw and Andr√© Jurres initiated the renowned Music-Cultural gatherings Musicultura at Queeckhoven House in Breukelen, the Netherlands. See: The World of Music Vol. 20, No. 2, Musicultura: Three Orient-Occident Encounters organized by the Eduard van Beinum Foundation‚ÄîFinal Report (1978), pp. 10‚Äì14. This manifested itself in his work for Western instruments by the occasional use of microtonality, as in his String Quartet No. 2 (1964),Vincent McDermott, \\"Current Chronicle: The Netherlands\\", The Musical Quarterly 52, no. 4 (October 1966): 511‚Äì20; citation on 517‚Äì18. as well as in compositional plans; Gending (1975) for Javanese gamelan is a rare foray into writing for non-western instruments. In 1956 Ton de Leeuw was awarded the Prix Italia for his radiophonic oratorio Job. He wrote three operas, all to his own libretti, including a television opera Alceste (1963, after Euripides), the one-act De Droom (\\"the Dream\\", 1963), and finally Antigone (1989‚Äì1991, after Sophocles). In 2005 his 1964 book on twentieth-century music was published in English translation as Music of the Twentieth Century: A Study of Its Elements and Structure (Amsterdam: University Press, 1995), also in Swedish and German. Olivier Messiaen wrote about his later works: 'Ton de Leeuw's music is essentially diatonic. He uses modes, melodic lines, counterpoints, chords, but it all remains diatonic. Hardly any discords. The colour white, or just a shade bluish, sometimes a golden light is added. Treatment of the 12 voices in his work about the ‚ÄúCantique des Cantiques‚Äù [Song of Songs] also remains diatonic, both in his pianissimo and forte. His work on part of ‚Äúl‚ÄôApocalypse‚Äù [The Book of Revelation] provides a new timbral element with staccato of the horn and the clarinet. Plainsong is introduced in his ‚ÄúPsaumes pour la Messe des Morts‚Äù [Psalms for the Requiem Mass], as well as dramatic effects where the beating of the tam-tam comes up against the ostinatos of the marimba, against the calls of the female voice. There are even bunches of chords with the use of modes. But the spirit always remains diatonic in a static way that is very close to the type of oriental music which penetrates the listener and gets him into a semi-oneiric state, the state of a waking dream.' Ton de Leeuw wrote about 160 compositions, spanning the whole range from solo pieces to complete operas, but it is the vocal and, more specifically, the choral works which reveal most clearly what he was striving to obtain: a conjunction of the essence of past and present, a link between Eastern and Western thought, and the result was a unique purity of expression. His last work, 'Three Shakespeare Songs', was performed on 13 June 1996 by Rosemary Hardy with the Ensemble InterContemporain.

It is currently used mostly for football matches, but sometimes also for music concerts or athletics. It is the home stadium of FK Vardar and FK Rabotniƒçki from Skopje, both of which compete in the Macedonian First League, as well as the home ground of the North Macedonia national football team on almost all occasions (the other venues rarely chosen being the Goce Delƒçev Stadium in Prilep, or SRC Biljanini Izvori in Ohrid). On 30 June 2015, the UEFA announced that the National Arena To≈°e Proeski will host in 2017 for the first time an UEFA Super Cup final. The stadium was previously known as the City Stadium Skopje (; Gradski Stadium Skopje) until 2009 and Philip II National Arena () until 2019, when it was renamed in honour of the Macedonian pop icon To≈°e Proeski. Reconstruction and expansion The project for the south stand was designed in 1977 by architects Dragan Krstev and Todorka Mavkova from Beton. Construction of the stadium in its present form began in 1978, with the building of the south stand, which took two years to finish. The reconstruction and expansion started after a long delay in project implementation in January 2008. The construction of a new north stand was finished in August 2009 and was put in use on 2 August 2009, the Macedonian national holiday \\"Ilinden\\". Ten days later, on 12 August, the Macedonia national football team played a friendly match against then European Champions Spain, as part of the 100-year anniversary of football in Macedonia. The reconstruction of the southern stand started in 2009, which was put into operation on 30 July of that year for the match between FK Rabotniƒçki and Liverpool FC. Soon after, the construction of the new western and eastern stands started. By mid July 2012, the majority of the stadium was completed with the reconstruction of the new pitch and athletic track. On 25 July 2012, FK Vardar played FC BATE Borisov in the second qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League to re-open the stadium. Construction cost Since 2008, the stadium has seen investment of about two billion denari, or ‚Ç¨32 million. The second phase, which got underway in November 2011, is the planned reconstruction of the pitch and athletic track. The athletic track around the pitch, from the original 6 will be extended to 8 running tracks and it will use Tartan track surface. Total cost for this phase is ‚Ç¨3.5 million. By 2013, it should be finished with the completion of a new illuminated outer facade. The total construction cost for all actions related to the stadium in the period 2008-2013 is estimated to reach over ‚Ç¨60 million.

'The Voice of the Time'). He earned national prominence for penning several political articles and opinionated columns in support of successful Pakistan Movement while he played a crucial role in the growing influence of the print journalism in Pakistan. Biography Hameed Nizami was born in the remote railway junction town of Sangla Hill, a few miles from the vintage city Lyallpur (now Faisalabad), Punjab, British Indian Empire, on 3 October 1915. He hailed from a Punjabi family and initially studied at the local school in Faisalabad at his own expense. He attended the Islamia College where he gained a BA degree in Journalism. Later, he attended the Punjab University where he attained the MA degree in English Literature. During his years in college, he was politically active. He founded and served as president of the 'Punjab Muslim Students Federation' wing of the All India Muslim League. His role as student leader and journalist led him to become closer to Muhammad Ali Jinnah. After attaining master's degree in journalism, he joined the press directorate of the Punjab government for a short time before joining the literary staff of the Orient Press. Nawa-i-Waqt newspaper In 1940, Nizami left the Orient Press and founded the Nawa-i-Waqt newspaper. He became the newspaper's first editor-in-chief from Lahore on 23 March 1940. The Nawa-i-Waqt was a monthly newspaper but he quickly converted the newspaper into weekly on 15 December 1942. After hiring more staff and gaining more credibility, the Nawa-i-Waqt began publishing as a daily newspaper on 19 July 1944. The first edition of the Nawa-i-Waqt came out on 22 July 1944 with a Muslim prayer and a message of Muhammad Ali Jinnah in it. Nizami's efforts made Nawa-i-Waqt, with all its resources limitations, a powerful voice of the people for the cause of All India Muslim League and he penned several articles for the support of Pakistan Movement. He was noted as a strong spokesman for democracy in the country, and wrote a harsh column against the first martial law imposed by President Iskander Mirza. Through his newspaper, he took hard stance on communism and supported capitalism during the 1950s. He began to raise his voice against the martial law despite hardship imposed by the government. He once described the martial law as a \\"dark night\\".

After his death, the newspaper founded the \\"Hameed Nizami Memorial Society\\" (HNMS) dedicated to his style of journalism, and held memorial sessions on his death anniversary every year. His journalism style was influenced by the renowned philosopher, Iqbal, and he had conveyed Iqbal's words in articles he wrote. To many conservative politicians, Nizami is noted as a crucial figure in shaping the print media in Pakistan. Hameed Nizami's son, Arif Nizami, and grandson, Babur Nizami, run the daily newspaper Pakistan Today. In 2013, The Hameed Nizami Memorial Society held an event on his 51st death anniversary in Lahore, Pakistan where noted Pakistani scholars and political leaders spoke to pay him tributes including SM Zafar, Justice Nasira Iqbal and Bushra Rahman.

History In 1999, Christian Solutions Group Inc. received Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approval to operate CFEQ-FM, an English language Christian rock station. It was a specialty low power radio station at 93.5 FM, broadcasting at 22 watts.Decision CRTC 99-467 In 2000, CFEQ moved from 93.5 to 107.1 FM.Decision CRTC 2000-385 The station branded as FREQ-FM. A year later, the station's licence was revoked by request of the owner of Christian Solutions Group.Decision CRTC 2001-35 In 2002, HIS Broadcasting (a company led by the station's previous manager Tom Hibert, and later renamed Kesitah Inc.), received CRTC approval to launch a Contemporary Christian music station, targeted towards youth and young adults, on the same frequency as the former CFEQ.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2002-226 The new station launched once again as CFEQ-FM, with the on-air branding FREQ 107, The station originally broadcast a CCM format. However, CFEQ soon began to downplay its Christian format and pivot towards a secular, modern rock-based presentation. As its CRTC license still required at least 95% of all music played by the station weekly to be \\"non-classic religious music\\", Kesitah relied on a broad interpretation of the category. The station later sought a license amendment from the CRTC to reduce this quota to 31%. The company argued that there was limited listener interest in religious music, and that being able to shift to a predominantly-secular format would allow CFEQ to be more competitive with other commercial stations in the market. It cited that the station's small youth audience, and difficulty attracting advertisers (with faith-based advertisers objecting to its \\"liberal\\" positioning, and secular advertisers not being interested in advertising on what was still technically a religious station) was affecting its profitability. Logo as Ignite 107, used from 2008-2013.The amendment was denied by the CRTC in 2006, citing that the station's original approval was on the basis that it would be a Christian music station, and that allowing it to compete directly with mainstream stations was a backdoor that would \\"undermine the integrity of the Commission's competitive licensing process\\". In early 2008, Golden West Broadcasting acquired Kesitah, making it a sister station to Winnipeg's other Christian music station, CHVN-FM.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2008-134 On September 29, 2008, CFEQ-FM flipped to Christian CHR as Ignite 107. On February 14, 2011, Golden West applied for a major increase in CFEQ-FM's effective radiated power, going from 920 watts to 100,000 watts. The CRTC granted approval on October 7, 2011.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2011-644 On April 8, 2013, the CRTC approved a request by Golden West to convert CFEQ to a specialty music format focusing on classical music. Golden West stated that the station had continued to be unprofitable, and cited Winnipeg's position as a \\"cultural centre\\" of Canada, as well as CBC Radio 2's shift away from classical music, as providing a potential audience. The CRTC approved the application, ruling that the new format would increase the diversity of the market, and that CHVN would be able to supplant CFEQ's former role as a Christian station.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2013-180, April 8, 2013.

The Indiana Pi Bill is the popular name for bill #246 of the 1897 sitting of the Indiana General Assembly, one of the most notorious attempts to establish mathematical truth by legislative fiat. Despite its name, the main result claimed by the bill is a method to square the circle, rather than to establish a certain value for the mathematical constant , the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. The bill, written by the crank Edward J. Goodwin, does imply various incorrect values of , such as 3.2. The bill never became law, due to the intervention of Professor C. A. Waldo of Purdue University, who happened to be present in the legislature on the day it went up for a vote. The impossibility of squaring the circle using only compass and straightedge constructions, suspected since ancient times, was rigorously proven in 1882 by Ferdinand von Lindemann. Better approximations of than those implied by the bill have been known since ancient times.

The text of the bill consists of a series of mathematical claims (detailed below), followed by a recitation of Goodwin's previous accomplishments: Goodwin's \\"solutions\\" were indeed published in the American Mathematical Monthly, though with a disclaimer of \\"published by request of the author\\".\\"Clearing the Misunderstanding Re My April Fool's \`Joke'\\", math.rutgers.edu. Upon its introduction in the Indiana House of Representatives, the bill's language and topic occasioned confusion among the membership; a member from Bloomington proposed that it be referred to the Finance Committee, but the Speaker accepted another member's recommendation to refer the bill to the Committee on Swamplands, where the bill could \\"find a deserved grave\\". It was transferred to the Committee on Education, which reported favorably;Indiana pi story at a Purdue server following a motion to suspend the rules, the bill passed on February 6, 1897 without a dissenting vote. The news of the bill occasioned an alarmed response from Der T√§gliche Telegraph, a German-language newspaper in Indianapolis, which viewed the event with less favor than its English-speaking competitors. As this debate concluded, Purdue University Professor C. A. Waldo arrived in Indianapolis to secure the annual appropriation for the Indiana Academy of Science. An assemblyman handed him the bill, offering to introduce him to the genius who wrote it. He declined, saying that he already met as many crazy people as he cared to. When it reached the Indiana Senate, the bill was not treated so kindly, for Waldo had coached the senators previously. The committee to which it had been assigned reported it unfavorably, and the Senate tabled it on February 12, 1897; it was nearly passed, but opinion changed when one senator observed that the General Assembly lacked the power to define mathematical truth. Influencing some of the senators was a report that major newspapers, such as the Chicago Tribune, had begun to ridicule the situation. According to the Indianapolis News article of February 13, 1897, page 11, column 3: > ... the bill was brought up and made fun of. The Senators made bad puns > about it, ridiculed it and laughed over it. The fun lasted half an hour. > Senator Hubbell said that it was not meet for the Senate, which was costing > the State $250 a day, to waste its time in such frivolity. He said that in > reading the leading newspapers of Chicago and the East, he found that the > Indiana State Legislature had laid itself open to ridicule by the action > already taken on the bill. He thought consideration of such a proposition > was not dignified or worthy of the Senate. He moved the indefinite > postponement of the bill, and the motion carried.  Mathematics   Approximation of  Although the bill has become known as the \\"Pi Bill\\", its text does not mention the name \\"pi\\" at all, and Goodwin appears to have thought of the ratio between the circumference and diameter of a circle as distinctly secondary to his main aim of squaring the circle. Towards the end of Section 2 the following passage appears: This comes close to an explicit claim that = = 3.2, and that = ‚âà 1.429. This quotation is often read as three mutually incompatible assertions, but they fit together well if the statement about is taken to be about the inscribed square (with the circle's diameter as diagonal) rather than the square on the radius (with the chord of 90¬∞ as diagonal). Together they describe the circle shown in the figure, whose diameter is 10 and circumference is 32; the chord of 90¬∞ is taken to be 7. Both of the values 7 and 32 are within a few percent of the true lengths for a diameter-10 circle (which does not justify Goodwin's presentation of them as exact). The circumference should be nearer to 31.4159 and the diagonal \\"7\\" should be the square root of 50 (=25+25), or nearer to 7.071.  Area of the circle  Goodwin's main goal was not to measure lengths in the circle but to square it, which he interpreted literally as finding a square with the same area as the circle. He knew that Archimedes' formula for the area of a circle, which calls for multiplying the diameter by one fourth of the circumference, is not considered a solution to the ancient problem of squaring the circle. This is because the problem is to construct the area using compass and straightedge only, and Archimedes did not give a method for constructing a straight line with the same length as the circumference. Apparently, Goodwin was unaware of this central requirement; he believed that the problem with the Archimedean formula is that it gives wrong numerical results, and that a solution of the ancient problem should consist of replacing it with a \\"correct\\" formula. In the bill he proposed, without argument, his own method: This appears needlessly convoluted, as an \\"equilateral rectangle\\" is, by definition, a square. In simple terms, the assertion is that the area of a circle is the same as that of a square with the same perimeter. This claim results in other mathematical contradictions to which Goodwin attempts to respond. For example, right after the above quotation, the bill goes on to say: In the model circle above, the Archimedean area (accepting Goodwin's values for the circumference and diameter) would be 80, whereas Goodwin's proposed rule leads to an area of 64. Now, 80 exceeds 64 by one fifth of 80, and Goodwin appears to confuse 64 = 80 √ó (1 ‚àí ) with 80 = 64 √ó (1 + ), an approximation that works only for fractions much smaller than . The area found by Goodwin's rule is times the true area of the circle, which in many accounts of the Pi Bill is interpreted as a claim that = 4. However, there is no internal evidence in the bill that Goodwin intended to make such a claim; on the contrary, he repeatedly denies that the area of the circle has anything to do with its diameter. The relative area error of 1 ‚àí works out to about 21 percent, which is much more grave than the approximations of the lengths in the model circle of the previous section. It is unknown what made Goodwin believe that his rule could be correct. In general, figures with identical perimeters do not have identical area (see isoperimetry); the typical demonstration of this fact is to compare a long thin shape with a small enclosed area (the area approaching zero as the width decreases) to one of the same perimeter that is approximately as tall as it is wide (the area approaching the square of the width), obviously of much greater area.

The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this. Etymology The word \\"revava\\" in Hebrew means \\"ten thousand\\". The name was chosen based on the biblical verse:Revava Website (source in Hebrew) \\"And they blessed Rebekah, and said to her: Our sister, you will be the mother of thousands of ten thousands, and let your seed possess the gate of those that hate them\\" (Genesis 24:60). In addition, the area in question was allotted to the Israelite tribe of Ephraim: \\"And they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh\\" (Deuteronomy 33:17).

In 2013, a clinic of the Maccabi Health Fund was established, with three staff physicians. Legal conflicts According to Zionist Organization of America, in 2008, the Israeli courts found Peace Now guilty of publishing false statements regarding ownership of the land. According to a Peace Now report, 71.15 percent of the land was \\"stolen from Arabs.\\" When the organization refused to abide by the court order to apologize, the fund that purchased the property sued, charging Peace Now and the authors of the false report for slander.

The water supply came from Bryan Mills Beck and Scorborough Beck, but in 1988, these were diverted to feed into Arram Beck, and most of the channel was filled in with material from the flood banks. History Aike Beck joined the River Hull above its junction with the Leven Canal. Navigable for no more than from the river, its main function was to carry coal, and it had two canal locks taking craft of 40 feet by 8 feet 10 inches (12 m x 2.7 m). One was an entrance lock where the Beck joined the River Hull, and the other was about halfway along the navigation.Ordnance Survey, 1:10,560 map, 1855 Below the middle lock, Aike Beck was enlarged, while above it, the course of the navigation was made much straighter than the original course of the beck. Coal and agricultural fertiliser was transferred from keel boats to the smaller, shallow draughted boats used on the navigation, and hauled by horse or manpower to Lockington wharf. The navigation was constructed in the late 18th century by the Hotham family who owned large amounts of land in the area. Aike Beck crossed over the Beverley and Barmston Drain with the drain culverted underneath; one of eleven similar structures required to allow the drain to cross existing waterways. In 1809 engineer William Chapman reported to the drainage commissioners that the locks on the navigation had raised water levels and caused flooding. As part of an agreement with Lord Hotham to not oppose the construction of the Hull and Selby Railway (Bridlington branch) in the 1840s, the proprietors of the line agreed not to provide coal handling facilities in the vicinity of his canal. It is thought to have ceased to be used for navigation in the 1850s, as it appears to be derelict on the 1855 Ordnance Survey map, where both the second lock and the coal basin at Lockington are marked \\"old\\". By the time the 1891 map was published, the final section from the beck to the coal wharf had disappeared altogether, and the lock gates must have been removed, as the beck is marked as tidal to beyond the coal wharf junction.Ordnance Survey, 1:2,500 map, 1891 The Beck was supplied with water by Bryan Mills Beck and Scorborough Beck. The latter was also used for navigation in the early 19th century. In 1988, Aike and Arram Beck were altered, removing Aike Beck's connection to the River Hull completely. The waters of Scorborough Beck and Bryan Mills Beck were routed southwards along a catchwater drain, which runs beside the railway line to join Arram Beck. The original course of the navigation was largely filled in, using material from the embankments on either side of the channel. All that remains is a small section containing water near Beck Lane in Aike, and a slight indentation in the bank of the Hull where Aike Beck used to enter. The former junction of Aike Beck with the river marks the point at which the Driffield Navigation, upstream from the junction, becomes the River Hull, below it.

History Foundation Benjamin Franklin Gravely (29 November 1876 ‚Äì January 1953) of Dunbar, West Virginia, manufactured in 1916 a hand-pushed plow fitted with an auxiliary Indian motorcycle engine and driven by belts.The Gravely Story Official historical document, with illustrations (date unspecified) His goal was to build a tractor which would revolutionize gardening and lawn maintenance for the homeowner. F. W. Wilcox, a friend of Gravely, owned a machine shop in Middleport, Ohio. He allowed Gravely to build more tractors at his shop. It was there that Gravely designed the engine and built six or seven of the first tractors, which weighed about 190 pounds each. He also developed several new tools for the engine and drive train. His third generation grandson, Shawn Ryder, has his grandfather's Gravely tractor collection in Warrington, Pennsylvania. Incorporation The Gravely company was incorporated in 1922. In the mid-1920s, Gravely decided to build and market the tractors commercially. He and several backers raised enough capital to purchase an old factory in the Dunbar, West Virginia, area that had previously been used for the manufacture of tires. One of the stockholders, Eustace Rose, a close friend and a mechanic, inventor and engineer, collaborated closely in the development of the tractor. Rose is also reputed to have invented the first automatic transmission used by the Chrysler Corporation. Survival and growth Strong sales assured the company's profitability through the Great Depression. Customer loyalty was an important element in this success. In the company's earliest years, Gravely would load several tractors into his Studebaker tourer car and sell them to farms as far away as Florida at $175 each. He would then drive back and pick up another load. Within a few years, sales outlets had been established from coast to coast, with international sales representatives in Germany, France and Switzerland. Ben Gravely sold his stock in Gravely Tractor in 1940 and died thirteen years later. His company was gradually acquired by the Studebaker Corporation by 1960 and later sold off by Studebaker-Worthington. Studebaker purchased Gravely to strengthen the Studebaker Corporation, but decisions that were causing Studebaker to decline also affected Gravely Tractor. With a strong work force at the Dunbar, WV, plant, wages had increased. Studebaker presumed moving the plant to North Carolina would allow them to hire farm workers at a lower wage. They asked the management team to move to the new factory. Building a large facility at Winston-Salem, they made the move. However, in the same area GE built a plant for motors and other units, and a large beer producer built a brewery for their products. They started employees at almost $3.45 per hour which was $1.45 more than Gravely paid at Dunbar and $2.00 per hour more than they had hoped to pay in the new plant. The management then tried to recruit former employees, but only a few went. Most of those returned home within a year. With a lack of workers and other problems, the tractor started to decline. To head off further problems and attempt to save money, they opted to purchase outsourced engines to retrofit on the Gravely tractor. This stopped the production of the Gravely built engine which was simple and efficient. Studebaker eventually got out of Gravely. Due to a large amount of loyal owners, Gravely survived, but did lose much of their large market share to competing companies. Current products Not much unlike Gravely's first power driven plow, Gravely today offers two kinds of all-gear \\"tractors\\" ‚àí walk-behind self-propelled units and zero-turn-radius riding mowers, which evolved out of the durable riding tractors that defined the company for much of its later years. 1959 Gravely LI walk behind tractor with Snow Dozer plow1959 Gravely LI walk behind tractor with front mounted cultivator1959 Gravely LI walk behind tractor w/original 6 HP gravely engine Walk- behind The all-gear walk-behind units are powered by a single-cylinder four-cycle engine, available in a one-wheel model D (1916‚àí195?) and the two wheel model L (1936‚àí1966) and the two wheel model C (1967-1976). variations of both models vary extensively including bodywork changes, mechanical changes and color changes throughout the production. visit the gravely tractor club of America for any further information. Earlier models had attachments such as rototillers and flail mowers. Later attachment options include snowblowers, snow blades, and a sprayer. Gravely in the 1970s had 38 attachments, but through innovations of various companies the list expanded to over 80. Sulkies and steering sulkies are available for walk-behind tractors, as well as an optional solid platform with space for carrying small amounts of cargo (trailers). While it offers walk-behind mowers, brush-cutters and other equipment, Gravely no longer produces general-purpose walk-behind tractors. Riding tractors The majority of Gravely riding tractors are, like the walk-behinds, characterized as \\"all-gear\\", that is, with a rear-mounted engine mated to a transaxle powering the tractor's rear wheels. This design thus eliminates the need for drive belts to power the tractor forward or backwards. The only belts required on Gravely equipment (with the exception of the 408) is the blade drive belt for its mower decks, which is powered by a gear box on the deck, which receives power from a PTO driveshaft connected to the tractor's drivetrain. The tractor's direction is controlled by a lever to the right of the operator for forward, neutral, or reverse operation. Because of this, this tractor is often mistaken for having a hydrostatic drive. In 1965, Kelly G. Cunningham used the Gravely 7.6 tractor to create the Terramite Model 1 compact backhoe, now known as the T1.T7 Operators Handbook, Maintenance, Service & Parts Manual, Terramite Construction Equipment, published 3/2007 In 1967, Gravely introduced its 400 series riding tractors, with the all-gear drivetrain that would come to define the company in future years. The tractor had four speeds, two in low range and two in high range, with power configurations of single-cylinder 10, 12, or 14 horsepower Kohler or Onan engines. In 1969 was the debut of the 16.5 HP Onan CCKA twin-cylinder powered Commercial 450, the most powerful tractor the company offered at the time. The commercial-grade units were painted a characteristic yellow and white, while the home-use units were painted red and white. The 400 series was produced until 1971, when Gravely introduced its replacement: the 800 series tractors, which gained popularity in the consumer market. This tractor had eight speeds, with four speeds each in low and high range, with engine options ranging from a cast-iron 10 horsepower Kohler single-cylinder, to an 18-horsepower cast- aluminum twin-cylinder Onan. The 800 series was replaced with the 8000 series by 1978, which offered more powerful engine configurations and an improved hydraulic lift option, yet retained the eight-speed transaxle. Many of the parts for the 800 and 8000 series designs, excepting the engine, are the same or compatible, and are readily available as new and used parts online, in a rather impressive after-market. The 8000 series remained in production until 1987, when it was replaced by the professional-grade \\"G\\" series. The G series ended production in 2004. The eight-speed transaxle was standard on all 800 and 8000 series tractors, with the engine being the only major difference. The design of the drive clutches was visibly changed to a simpler arrangement around the early 1980s; the two designs are generally interchangeable. The rear-engine mounting and simple construction allowed Gravely owners to service and even upgrade their engines on their own. Gravely also released an economy version of tractor in 1970, featuring a belt-driven 4-speed transmission and eight-horsepower (Kohler) engine, known as the 408. The engine was mounted at the front. This did not sell nearly as well as the popular all-gear units and was discontinued in 1977, when it was replaced with a heavy-duty professional grade of tractor known as the 900 series. Another tractor of this type, called the 9000 series was also released later that same year and replaced the 900 the following year until production ended in 1982. This tractor, much larger than the 8000 series and its predecessors, was equipped with a 27-horsepower I-4 water-cooled Continental engine. Gravely today In 2004 Gravely produced its last Gravely two-wheeled tractor. As of 2006, Gravely provided a full line of power lawn implements, including zero-turn mowers, reel mowers, and grass trimmers. In 2008, Gravely launched Gravely Turf Equipment a division geared towards golf courses and turf management nationwide. Gravely was purchased by AriensCo located in Brillion, Wisconsin in 1982. Today the Gravely brand operates as the commercial lawn division of AriensCo and its products continue to be sold exclusively through its dealer network. Gravely celebrated the 100th anniversary of Benjamin Gravely's plow patent in 2016.https://www.gravely.com/100years/timeline/ References Further reading *The Gravely Story Adaptation on official website External links *GravelyTractorClub.org Manuals, parts lists, and sales literature for Gravely garden tractors, attachments. and accessories. *Gravely official website *Ariens web-site *AriensCo web-site Category:Studebaker Category:Lawn and garden tractors ","title":"Gravely Tractor"},{"id":"4492939","text":"In computer science, the inside‚Äìoutside algorithm is a way of re-estimating production probabilities in a probabilistic context-free grammar.

Inside and outside probabilities The inside probability \\\\beta_j(p,q) is the total probability of generating words w_p \\\\cdots w_q, given the root nonterminal N^j and a grammar G: :\\\\beta_j(p,q) = P(w_{pq}|N^j_{pq}, G) The outside probability \\\\alpha_j(p,q) is the total probability of beginning with the start symbol N^1 and generating the nonterminal N^j_{pq} and all the words outside w_p \\\\cdots w_q, given a grammar G: :\\\\alpha_j(p,q) = P(w_{1(p-1)}, N^j_{pq}, w_{(q+1)m}|G) Computing inside probabilities Base Case: \\\\beta_j(p,p) = P(w_{p}|N^j, G) General case: Suppose there is a rule N_j \\\\rightarrow N_r N_s in the grammar, then the probability of generating w_p \\\\cdots w_q starting with a subtree rooted at N_j is: \\\\sum_{k=p}^{k=q-1} P(N_j \\\\rightarrow N_r N_s)\\\\beta_r(p,k) \\\\beta_s(k+1,q) The inside probability \\\\beta_j(p,q) is just the sum over all such possible rules: \\\\beta_j(p,q) = \\\\sum_{N_r,N_s} \\\\sum_{k=p}^{k=q-1} P(N_j \\\\rightarrow N_r N_s)\\\\beta_r(p,k) \\\\beta_s(k+1,q) Computing outside probabilities Base Case: \\\\alpha_j(1,n) = \\\\begin{cases} 1 & \\\\mbox{if } j=1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\mbox{otherwise} \\\\end{cases} Here the start symbol is N_1. General case: Suppose there is a rule N_r \\\\rightarrow N_j N_s in the grammar that generates N_j. Then the left contribution of that rule to the outside probability \\\\alpha_j(p,q) is: \\\\sum_{k=q+1}^{k=n} P(N_r \\\\rightarrow N_j N_s)\\\\alpha_r(p,k) \\\\beta_s(q+1,k) Now suppose there is a rule N_r \\\\rightarrow N_s N_j in the grammar. Then the right contribution of that rule to the outside probability \\\\alpha_j(p,q) is: \\\\sum_{k=1}^{k=p-1} P(N_r \\\\rightarrow N_s N_j)\\\\alpha_r(k,q) \\\\beta_s(k,p-1) The outside probability \\\\alpha_j(p,q) is the sum of the left and right contributions over all such rules: \\\\alpha_j(p,q) = \\\\sum_{N_r,N_s} \\\\sum_{k=q+1}^{k=n} P(N_r \\\\rightarrow N_j N_s)\\\\alpha_r(p,k) \\\\beta_s(q+1,k) \\\\+ \\\\sum_{N_r,N_s} \\\\sum_{k=1}^{k=p-1} P(N_r \\\\rightarrow N_s N_j)\\\\alpha_r(k,q) \\\\beta_s(k,p-1) References * J.

It is a Swedish-American joint venture produced by Columbia Pictures, Longstocking Productions, and Svensk Filmindustri. While the title suggests a continuation of previous entries, it is in fact a remake of the original story. Filmed in Fernandina Beach on Amelia Island and at soundstages in Jacksonville, Florida, the film premiered on March 8, 1988 in Tokyo, before it was released on July 29 in the United States and September 9 in Sweden. It received mixed reviews upon release and became a financial failure. It was Annakin's final completed film before his death on April 22, 2009. Plot Pippi Longstocking, who travels on the ship Hoptoad with her sailor father, Efraim, encounters a sudden storm caused by a volcanic eruption. After Efraim disappears into the sea, Pippi travels to the small coastal town of Rocksby, accompanied by her horse, Alfonso, and monkey, Mr. Nilsson. She takes up residence in her father's home, Villa Villekulla, which the neighborhood children believe is haunted. Soon Tommy and Annika Settigren venture into it after seeing lights in the windows. Looking for ghosts, they meet Pippi, Mr. Nilsson, and Alfonso instead. They become friends and get into various adventures together such as making pancakes, cleaning the floor with scrubbing shoes, serving ice cream to residents of the local orphanage, riding a motorcycle, and dodging \\"splunks\\". Pippi must also fight off Mr. Blackhart and his henchmen, Rype and Rancid, who want to demolish her house and sell the property, as well as avoid being legally taken to the orphanage by Miss Bannister. She agrees to escape and flee with Tommy and Annika in a homemade autogyro to avoid this fate. However, they are rescued after nearly going over a waterfall while riding barrels down a river. Thinking that Pippi will hurt Tommy and Annika, Mr. and Mrs. Settigren refuse to let them play with her anymore. Pippi believes that they would be better off without her and she goes to the orphanage. As a result, she is forced to leave Mr. Nilsson and Alfonso behind. She is unable to fit in with the other children due to her lack of discipline and education. However, after she rescues the orphanage from a fire inadvertently started by the janitor and is lauded by the townsfolk as a hero, she is allowed to return home and play with Tommy and Annika again. She is reunited with Efraim on Christmas Day, and he offers her the chance to become a cannibal princess of the uncharted island he had washed ashore on and was crowned king. She agrees and everyone comes out to bid her a tearful farewell. Just as they prepare to sail off, she decides to stay after seeing that the townsfolk are sad to see her go. She explains to Efraim that she cannot leave Tommy and Annika. He understands and tells her that he loves her. They say goodbye and she goes home with Tommy, Annika, Mr. Nilsson, and Alfonso.

(Reprise)\\" ‚Äì Margie Nelson and the International Children's Choir Production Development The idea of an American film adaptation of the Pippi Longstocking series by Astrid Lindgren was first developed when producer Gary Mehlman's daughters, Romy and Alexandra, convinced him to try to secure the rights from Lindgren. When he wrote a letter to her expressing interest in acquiring the rights to the film in November 1983, she declined, as she regarded the character as \\"her own daughter\\". Eventually, in August 1984, Mehlman traveled to Stockholm during pre-production of The Yellow Jersey to meet with Lindgren and Svensk Filmindustri executives Lennart Wiklund and Conny Planborg for the film rights. Although Svensk Filmindustri was willing to give non-Scandinavian rights to the film, Lindgren was hesitant. After Romy hugged her during their introduction, she gave her approval. After returning from Stockholm, Mehlman met with Walter Moshay, an investment consultant and Mehlman's best friend, and Mishaal Kamal Adham, a Saudi Arabian investor who never produced a film before. Having convinced Moshay and Adham to produce the film with a $12‚Äì15 million budget, Mehlman formed Longstocking Productions with them; Mehlman and Moshay served as producers, while Adham served as an executive producer. On August 15, it was announced that Mehlman purchased the rights to the film and that Kimi Peck would write the script for the film. On October 16, 1985, it was announced that Ken Annakin would write the screenplay and production was scheduled to start early in 1986 with an estimated budget of $10‚Äì12 million; Bavaria, Florida and North Carolina listed as filming locations. At the American Film Market on February 25, 1986, Producers Sales Organization announced that they acquired the foreign sales rights to the film, with TriStar Pictures distributing it in North America. Casting To cast the titular character, Mehlman, Moshay, and Annakin, along with casting director Garrison True, and executive vice president of marketing Gary Shapiro began an international search for potential actresses on October 7, 1985. Over 8,000 actresses from United States, Canada and the United Kingdom participated in the auditions. After going through two callbacks and a screen test, Tami Erin was eventually selected for the role on February 21, 1986. She was excited at the prospect of working on the film, saying, \\"This is it! The [hotel elevator] door opened and [...] [Annakin] said, 'You got it!' Oh, oh! I had no idea I would get so emotional after all these years, oh my God! I just jumped in his arms!\\" On Erin's casting, Annakin said, \\"I don't want [Tami] to turn into Pippi. I want Pippi to turn into [Tami]. I've never seen anyone radiate sunshine the way she does.\\" Filming The Villa Villekulla of the film at the Original Town of Fernandina Historic Site, in Fernandina Beach (picture from 2010) Principal photography began on May 17, 1987 in Fernandina Beach, Florida. During the production, Annakin allowed Erin to improvise much of the dialogue. The exterior scenes in Villa Villekulla were filmed at the Captain's House, located near Plaza San Carlos. The interior scenes were filmed at the WJCT studios in Jacksonville, Florida. Soundtrack Atlantic Records issued the film's motion picture soundtrack upon its release, in both LP and CD formats (LP: 91016-1, CD: 91016-2). It was also issued in Japan by Polydor Records (CD: P32P-20156). The Atlantic LP and CD had 22 tracks, with the score by Misha Segal, and all of the songs. Garrison True provided narration for some of the tracks. # Pippi Longstocking is Coming into Your Town # The Storm (Lyrics) # The Gulf Stream # Ghost of Villa Villekula # Pippi March # Scrubbing Day # War of the Ice Cream # Beautiful Day at the Villa # Pastorale # Runnin' Away # Runnin' Away (Reprise) # The Rescue (Lyrics) # Mama (Lyrics) # Sticky Situation # Pippi Saves the Day # Merry Christmas Tree # Father's Return # Kurre Kurre Islands # Goodbye Papa # We Live on the Seas # If You Ever Need Me # Pippi Longstocking is Coming into Your Town (Reprise) Reception Box office The film premiered on March 8, 1988 in Tokyo. It had its North American premiere on July 15, 1988 at the Florida Theatre in Jacksonville and was released nationwide on July 29, earning $933,462 on its opening weekend. It went on to gross $3.6 million in North America ‚Äì less than half its budget, and became the 136th highest-grossing film of 1988 in the U.S. Critical response Janet Maslin of The New York Times gave a mixed review of the film. She was critical of Tami Erin's acting, the screenplay, and visual effects, but praised Eileen Brennan's acting and Erin's hair design. Richard Harrington, writing for The Washington Post felt that \\"it's just as hard to imagine Lindgren sending Pippi to Hollywood again anytime in the near future\\" and criticized the film's subplots. He concluded that \\"anything that drives kids to reading can't be all bad.\\" People's Peter Travers was critical of the film's storyline, the music, and the acting, saying \\"If cute could kill, pigtailed Pippi could bring nations to their knees\\". Todd McCarthy of Variety called it \\"a picture for the pint-sized crowd only.\\" Although McCarthy praised Pippi's characterization, he found Erin's acting \\"overbearing\\" and stated \\"putting up with her charmlessness for 100 minutes is a tall order\\". However, he praised the performances of Eileen Brennan, Dianne Hull and John Schuck and later stated, \\"Despite major gaps in some of the staging, [writer/director] Ken Annakin's production is presentable enough for what's needed here.\\" Johanna Steinmetz of the Chicago Tribune also had mixed feelings. She thought that Erin \\"seems to embody the relentless good nature, physical agility and spunk necessary for the role\\", but questioned the film's plot and soundtrack, concluding that it is \\"a Pippi Longstocking museum rather than a movie, crammed with bits and pieces from a number of [Lindgren's] different books, none of them quite working together\\". In his 2015 Movie Guide, critic Leonard Maltin found Pippi a \\"tiresome troublemaker\\" and stated that the film would likely appeal to \\"...undiscriminating children; adults should avoid it at all costs...Tami Erin gives the title role her best shot, but she won't make you forget Inger Nilsson.\\" However, Candice Russell of the Sun-Sentinel gave a positive review of it. Despite her concerns about the scene where Pippi uses Efraim's pistol to ward off intruders, she praised it for its settings and Erin's acting. She gave it three stars, concluding that Ken Annakin \\"deserves to be proud of the Disney-esque The New Adventures of Pippi Longstocking\\". On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 17%, based on reviews from 6 critics, with a weighted average score of 4.4/10. The film was respectively nominated two Golden Raspberry Awards for Worst New Actor and Worst Supporting Actress for Tami Erin and Eileen Brennan, but lost to Ronald McDonald and Kristy McNichol. It was also nominated for Worst Picture at the 1988 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards but lost to Caddyshack II.https://web.archive.org/web/20070816011837/http://theenvelope.latimes.com/extras/lostmind/year/1988/1988st.htm Legacy Speaking with the Daily Herald, Tami Erin reflected on the film in 2013, saying \\"Becoming a real movie star in a studio picture gives you sort of an all-access pass to things in life, and I've been really lucky for all the doors that [The New Adventures] has opened for me.\\" In May 2014, Suzanne Broughton of The Orange County Register included the film in her list of 20 children-friendly films. She said that it \\"has some hokey moments, but it still delivers the carefree spirit of that little redhead.\\" Home media In North America, the film was first released on VHS on December 15, 1988 by RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video and again on August 13, 1996 by Columbia TriStar Home Video. An open matte, 1.33:1 aspect ratio DVD was released in the US on April 24, 2001. Only a few region 2 PAL DVDs feature transfers in the film's original widescreen, 1.85:1 theatrical aspect ratio.

The navigation is still tidal at this point, and is often considered to still be the River Hull,Ordnance Survey, 1:50,000 and 1:25,000 map although technically the Navigation starts at the point where the Aike Beck used to join the river, a little further downstream.Cumberlidge (2009), pp.114‚Äì115 It is from the hamlet of Wilfholme, and its main features are boat moorings, a farm and a pumping station. It is a popular spot for fishing, with anglers targeting resident roach, bream and perch. History Immediately to the north of the approach road, Watton Beck enters the river, which is still tidal at this point, as are the first of the Beck. The Beck crosses over the Beverley and Barmston Drain, which runs to the west of, and parallel to, the Driffield Navigation. It was authorised by the Beverley Barmston Drainage Act, which was passed by parliament in 1798. The tunnel carrying the drain under Watton Beck was one of eleven similar structures made necessary because the drain needed to cross existing waterways. The civil engineer for the project was William Chapman, who had submitted the original plans in 1796.Skempton (2002), p.126 Flood defence The operation of the pumping station has been considered as part of a consultation on the River Hull flood risk management strategy. The Environment Agency has identified that the station which pumps water from the Beverley and Barmston Drain into the river costs ¬£80,000 per year to operate. It can pump 161 million gallons per day (734 Mld (megalitres per day)), but is unable to operate when levels in the river are high, and therefore does not meet the current criteria for funding by the government. They had proposed to shut it down in a Catchment Flood Management Plan issued in 2008, even though they had identified that more land would become waterlogged, and more flooding would probably occur. East Riding of Yorkshire Council applied to the High Court for a judicial review, and the plans have been shelved for five years while an alternative solution is sought.Button (2010), pp.4‚Äì5 Location ;Situated on the Driffield Navigation *Next place upstream = Struncheon Hill Lock *Next place downstream = Aike Beck References Bibliography  * Category:Geography of the East Riding of Yorkshire ","title":"Wilfholme Landing"},{"id":"4492987","text":"Champions *National League: Boston Beaneaters National League final standings Events *April 3 - Jack Clements now with St. Louis, is the first southpaw to catch for 1,000 MLB games. *April 21 ‚Äì Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Bill Duggleby hits a grand slam in his first major league at-bat.

In modern times the name is applied to a community also known as Osney Town astride Botley Road, just west of the city's main railway station, on an island surrounded by the River Thames, Osney Ditch and another backwater connecting the Thames to Osney Ditch. Until the early 20th century the name was applied to the larger island of Oxford Castle and New Osney (between Castle Mill Stream and the main stream of the Thames) on which Osney Abbey and Osney Mill were established during the Middle Ages. The place plays a minor but significant role in The Miller's Tale in Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales.Canterbury Tales Miller's Tale, Chapter 4, line 88. History The name \\"Osney\\" is Old English, and means either \\"Osa's Island\\" or \\"island in the Ouse\\": Ouzen Ait is a base form and Ouse is an Old English word for a (large) river.Hibbert, C. (ed) (1988) Encyclopedia of Oxford Macmillan , s.v. Osney Until the early twentieth century the name was applied to the island formed by two streams of the River Thames immediately west of the centre of Oxford, Castle Mill Stream and the stream which is now the main channel of the river.VCH vol.4 Outlying parts of the liberty To the north the island is bounded by a short channel between the River Thames and the Castle Mill Stream, the Sheepwash Channel, which separates it from Fiddler's Island. Osney Abbey was founded on the south part of the island in 1129, and Rewley Abbey was founded in the north of the island in 1280. Osney Mill was established by Osney Abbey on the west side of the island. The lands of both abbeys passed to Christ Church following the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1538.VCH vol. 4 Sites and Remains of Religious Houses The island formed part of St. Thomas's parish. In 1790 the mill stream feeding Osney Mill on the west side of the island became the main navigation channel of the river, when Osney Lock was opened.VCH vol. 4 Communications:Rivers and river navigation. Until the beginning of the 19th century, only the side of the island east of St Thomas's Church was developed. In the nineteenth century the island changed significantly. The Great Western Railway built its line across the island from north to south in 1850, with new bridges across the Thames at the south end of the island, and across the Sheepwash Channel to the north. A new railway station was opened on the island two years later. In 1851 the Buckinghamshire Railway opened its line from the north across Sheepwash Channel to its Rewley Road station next to the GWR station. To house railway workers Osney Town was laid out in 1851 by George P. Hester, on an island west of Osney leased by Hester from Christ Church. In the 1860s New Osney was developed around Mill Street, south of Botley Road between the railway and the river. The Cripley estate, north of Botley Road, was laid out in 1878.VCH vol. 4 Modern Oxford: Development of the city Osney Cemetery was opened in 1848 in the south of the island. Modern Osney The name Osney is today usually applied to Osney Town. Most of Osney's two hundred-odd households live in 19th-century terraced cottages built on Hester's original grid. A minority of buildings are less than 50 years old, all on Bridge and West Streets, as well as a few significantly larger houses scattered throughout. The island presently has two public houses, The Punter and The Holly Bush. A Working Men's Club and Institute Union affiliate, the West Oxford Democrats Club has premises. Osney is part of the Oxfordshire County Council ward of Jericho and Osney (as currently named, wards being periodically redefined to avoid malapportionment). New Osney The name Osney is no longer applied to the island which historically bore the name. The part of the island east of the railway is now usually called St Thomas. The name survives on the island in New Osney, Osney Lane, Osney Cemetery, Osney Mill and Osney Marina. Osney Bridge carries the Botley Road (A420) west from the historic Osney island. Osney Lock was constructed in the river in 1790, between the island then known as Osney and the island now known as Osney. Osney Mead View along the main Osney Mead road. From 1961 an industrial estate, named Osney Mead in 1966, was developed on meadowland between Osney and Bulstake Stream, to the east of Ferry Hinksey Road. The estate was initially intended to relocate badly sited existing local businesses.Modern Oxford: Economic History after 1918, Volume 4, Victoria County History. Organisations based there include publishers Alden Mowbray, Holywell Press, and Oxford Community Church, the last occupying a building on the estate formerly used by Oxford Instruments.

It is based in Rushden, with several offices in the UK, and is a registered charity. Spurgeons currently delivers more than 81 projects reaching over 37,000 children and 78,000 parents or carers every year. It aims to find long-lasting solutions to the challenges they face ‚Äì including poverty, abuse problems, offending, and other social issues. The Christian charity works in partnership with local authorities, churches, charitable foundations and other supporters to bring about lasting change.http://www.spurgeons.org/how-we-help/ History Spurgeons was founded in 1867 by Charles Haddon Spurgeon. Charles Haddon Spurgeon was England's best known Baptist preacher. At 20 years old he became the pastor of London's famed New Park Street Church. Spurgeons charity was founded in 1867 when Anne Hillyard donated ¬£20,000 to Charles Spurgeon, to be used to open an orphanage for fatherless boys. Spurgeons was founded as a compassionate and distinctively Christian response to the plight of orphaned and vulnerable children in London. Motivated by their faith, Charles Haddon Spurgeon and his associates sought to provide shelter, education and a loving environment for the city's most vulnerable children. The original orphanage, in Stockwell, opened in 1869 for fatherless boys until ten years later when girls were welcomed to the orphanage. At this point there were 500 children living there. In 1892 Charles Spurgeon died, however his work continued to improve the lives of the children in the orphanage. In 1939, when the Second World War was announced, the children living in the Stockwell orphanage had to be evacuated. The majority of the children were moved to St David's in Reigate, Surrey. After the war the children briefly stayed at St David's as they were unable to return to Stockwell Orphanage due to the bomb damage. In 1951 the home in Birchington, Kent was opened and became the new children's home for Spurgeons. By 1953 all of the children had been relocated to the new home. The children's home remained opened until 1979 when the children were sent to smaller homes or foster families. From 1991 Spurgeons carried out international work in Romania, Kenya, Nigeria and Moldova. This international work was passed onto other organisations in 2011. Children's Centres Spurgeons runs over 50 Children's Centres across the UK. Children's centres are a key resource in local communities. The centres give Spurgeons the opportunity to work with children and families in the context of a local community and ensure they support all families regardless of background or situation. Working with children in the early years of their life is the most effective way to ensure that those experiencing deprivation can still look forward to choices and opportunities. Focusing on communities with high-levels of poverty, Spurgeons work with families at the pre-natal stage, through birth and up to the age of five. Their services include: * Young parents groups * Supporting parent and child relationships, family therapy and nurturing * Baby clinics * Stay and play sessions * Father support groups Young Carers Family circumstances mean that from an early age some children and young people provide regular or ongoing care and support to another family member as a result of them having a physical or mental illness, a disability, or are struggling with substance misuse. Young carers often take on practical and/or emotional caring responsibilities that would normally be expected of an adult. Spurgeons know that these children and young people need help to overcome the challenges they face. They work in partnership with other agencies to support young carers and young adult carers (18-25), individually and within their families in a range of ways. Their services include: * Information, advice and practical help for the family * Educational, training and homework support * One-to-one tailored support * Transition support * Mentoring support Families and Criminal Justice Many children, overwhelmed by their problems, act-up or act out in a bid for attention or a cry for help. Children seen as 'trouble-makers' may become isolated or be excluded from mainstream schooling. When this happens the risk of them becoming involved in criminal activity grows. They face the challenges of drugs, bullying, abuse, poverty and family breakdown alone - sometimes because their own parents are in prison. The impact a parent's imprisonment has on their children is not fully known. But Spurgeons believes that it's crucial to help children to address the root-causes of their problems, support children and their families while they have a family member in prison and ensure they break the cycle of imprisonment within families. In partnership with the police, schools, social workers and Youth Offending teams, Spurgeons supports families at times of crisis and provide one-to-one mentoring and befriending for children. Spurgeons run child focused visitors centres in a number of prisons. These include: * HMP Belmarsh * HMP Brixton * HMP Feltham * HMP Isis * HMP Holloway * HMP Pentonville * HMP Wandsworth * HMP Wormwood Scrubs * HMP Winchester The visitors centres ensure children have the most safe and comfortable experience when they visit a parent in prison. Spurgeons also offers targeted programmes for young offenders or those at risk of offending ‚Äì including mentoring for young people in custody, through the gate, and family based intervention to prevent offending and reoffending. Invisible Walls Spurgeons also provide a project called ‚ÄòInvisible Walls‚Äô. Spurgeons‚Äô Invisible Walls family support service is based at HMP/YOI Winchester, a local Category B/C prison. The service works in partnership with the prison and a range of agencies to support fathers in custody and their families in a range of ways. 1\\\\. Support for visiting... :A key part of the service is the Visitors‚Äô Centre, which acts as a hub for family support, and offers comprehensive access to information about local services within families‚Äô communities. The 7-day-a-week service is supported by a large volunteer workforce who are trained and understand the needs that children and families visiting prison may experience. 2\\\\. Support for fathers inside... :Within the prison, Invisible Walls offers a range of parenting support to fathers, including parenting programmes and Family Days, to assist them develop and maintain healthy relationships with their families wherever possible, both during custody and on release into the community. Invisible Walls acts as a bridging service to help meet the resettlement needs of fathers and their families on release as part of a multi-agency response. 3\\\\. Work with agencies outside... :Invisible Walls works in partnership with Local Authorities‚Äô family support services and social care, to deliver tailored packages of pre- and post-release support for the whole family. The service is a key provider of Hidden Sentence training to partner agencies and organisations across Hampshire and the surrounding area, helping them to understand the impact of having a family member in prison. Invisible Walls also has well-established links with local universities and community organisations through which the service recruits and trains a large cohort of volunteers to help support prisoners‚Äô families. Family Support Spurgeons is an experienced provider of services for families with multiple needs. They deliver a range of programmes to achieve positive change for families and clear outcomes for commissioners. Spurgeons provide cost effective high quality planned programmes in order to meet the needs of troubled families. They provide planned programmes to meet the complex needs of troubled families including key issues such as substance misuse, mental health and offending. Their programmes provide holistic support, co-ordinating multi-agency work around the family unit. They recognise that one of the most effective ways to reach vulnerable young people is by working with them in their own community. By establishing dialogue with children and young people most at risk of deprivation, Spurgeons can better understand them and better help their community to find solutions to the challenges they face. The aim is to facilitate them in doing this through training, support and skills- enhancement. These activities are designed to help people to deal with issues like inter-generational breakdown and anti-social behaviour and can help to build stronger families and healthier and more cohesive communities. Spurgeons provides activities such as parenting support, youth and children's activities, community events and homework clubs. They also offer child contact services. Contact centres are meeting places where children from separated families can enjoy contact with one (or both) parents and/or other family members in a comfortable and safe environment. Visits are tailored around the needs of each child. It is estimated that 2,000 children in the UK use Child Contact Centres each week. Independent visitors services is another service Spurgeons provides through family support. Children and young people being looked after by the local authority can benefit from the friendship and advice offered by a Spurgeons volunteer. All volunteers are fully trained to mentor and befriend a looked after child or young person.

First used by Canadian radio researcher Reginald Fessenden in 1903, it was used until about 1913, after which it was superseded by crystal detectors and vacuum tube detectors such as the Fleming valve and Audion (triode). It was considered very sensitive and reliable compared to other detectors available at the time such as the magnetic detector and the coherer. It was one of the first rectifying detectors, able to receive AM (sound) transmissions. On December 24, 1906, US Naval ships with radio receivers equipped with Fessenden's electrolytic detectors received the first AM radio broadcast from Fessenden's Brant Rock, Massachusetts transmitter, consisting of a program of Christmas music. History Fessenden, more than any other person, is responsible for developing amplitude modulation (AM) radio transmission around 1900. While working to develop AM transmitters, he realized that the radio wave detectors used in existing radio receivers were not suitable to receive AM signals. The radio transmitters of the time transmitted information by radiotelegraphy; the transmitter was turned on and off by the operator using a switch called a telegraph key producing pulses of radio waves, to transmit text data using Morse code. Thus receivers didn't have to extract an audio signal from the radio signal, but only detected the presence or absence of the radio frequency to produce \\"clicks\\" in the earphone representing the pulses of Morse code. The device that did this was called a \\"detector\\". The detector used in receivers of that day, called a coherer, simply acted as a switch, that conducted current in the presence of radio waves, and thus did not have the capability to demodulate, or extract the audio signal from, an amplitude modulated radio wave. The simplest way to extract the sound waveform from an AM signal is to rectify it; remove the oscillations on one side of the wave, converting it from an alternating current to a varying direct current. The variations in the amplitude of the radio wave that represent the sound waveform will cause variations in the current, and thus can be converted to sound by an earphone. To do this a rectifier is required, an electrical component that conducts electric current in only one direction and blocks current in the opposite direction. It was known at the time that passing current through solutions of electrolytes such as acids could have this unilateral conduction property. In 1902 Fessenden developed what he called a \\"barretter\\" detector that would rectify an AM signal, but it was not very sensitive. The barretter used a fine platinum wire, called Wollaston wire, manufactured as a platinum core in a silver sheath that had to be stripped off with acid. In the process of stripping some Wollaston wire, Fessenden left it immersed in acid too long, eating away most of the wire until only a tip remained in contact with the solution; he noted that it responded well to radio signals being generated nearby, and could be used as new type of detector. This story was disputed at the time, with credit for the discovery also given to Michael I. Pupin, W. Schloemilch, Hugo Gernsback and others. However, it is apparent that Fessenden was the first to put the device to practical use. Description The action of this detector is based upon the fact that only the tip of a platinum wire a few thousandths of an inch in diameter is immersed in an electrolyte solution, and a small D.C. voltage bias is applied to the cell thus formed. Platinum is used because other metals are too quickly dissolved in the acid. The applied bias current decomposes the solution by electrolysis into tiny gas bubbles that cling to the metal point insulating the metal tip from the solution thus reducing the bias current. An incoming R.F. current can flow better in the direction across the point that makes the point more negative. That recombines the gases and increases point exposure to the liquid. RF current flow in the direction that makes the point more positive only reinforces the resistance from the gaseous blocking of the point. Detection results from this asymmetrical flow. In practical use, a series circuit is made of the detector, headphones, and a battery with a potentiometer. The wire is made positive, and the signal to be demodulated is applied directly to it; a small (about 5 ml) platinum cup filled with either sulfuric or nitric acid completes the headphone circuit, and is also connected to ground to complete the signal circuit. To adjust the cell, the point of the wire electrode is dipped into the electrolyte and the potentiometer adjusted until a hissing noise is heard in the headphones. The potentiometer setting is then moved to reduce the current until the noise just ceases, at which point the detector is in its most sensitive state. It was found that strong atmospheric noise would render it insensitive, requiring that the device be rebiased after each strong burst of static interference.  Sealed-point detector  Another form of electrolytic detector, the sealed-point electrolytic detector, which could stand considerable rough usage, was commercially known as the Radioson Detector; it had the cell sealed in a glass envelope. The operation was the same as in the bare-point electrolytic detector, the advantage being that the acid was sealed in, and consequently could not spill or evaporate.

He supported the Parliamentary cause in the English Civil War. During the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, he was known as Viscount Lisle or (Lord Lisle) a subsidiary title of the Earls of Leicester. Sidney was the son of Robert Sidney, 2nd Earl of Leicester, and his wife Dorothy Percy, daughter of Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland. In April 1640, he was elected Member of Parliament for Yarmouth, Isle of Wight in the Short Parliament. He was elected MP for both Yarmouth and St Ives for the Long Parliament in November 1640, and chose to sit for Yarmouth. He was Colonel of a Regiment of Horse in Ireland in 1641. Lord Lisle supported the Parliamentary cause in the civil war and was Lord Lieutenant and Commander-in-Chief of Ireland from 1646 to 1647. He survived Pride's Purge in 1648 to sit in the Rump Parliament and was a Councillor of State from 1648 to 1650. He was appointed a judge for the trial of King Charles I but declined to act. He was President of the Council from 1651 to 1652. He was Councillor of State and Councillor to the Lord Protector in 1653. Also in 1653, he was elected MP for Kent in the Barebones Parliament. In 1654 he was elected MP for Isle of Wight, a constituency that only existed in the First Protectorate Parliament. He was appointed to Cromwell's \\"House of Lords\\" in 1658 under the designation \\"Lord Viscount Lisle\\". In 1659 he was returned to the House of Commons for the Restored Rump parliament. On the restoration of King Charles II in 1660 Lord Lisle received a pardon. In 1677 he inherited the Earldom on the death of his father. Lord Lisle married Lady Catherine Cecil, daughter of William Cecil, 2nd Earl of Salisbury, and his wife Lady Catherine Howard, in 1645.

The magazine is known for its high quality fiction and has published stories by authors such as Dave Wolverton, M. Shayne Bell, Dan Wells, and Orson Scott Card, articles by Algis Budrys, as well as poetry and articles by poet and literary critic Michael R. Collings. Several former Leading Edge staff members (such as Brandon Sanderson) have become speculative fiction authors in their own right. Other notable former staff members include Anne Sowards, senior editor at Roc Books and Ace Books, and literary agent Michael Carr. The magazine has also featured award-winning artwork, including the 2002 Chesley Award-winning cover artwork by James C. Christensen for issue 41. It is published twice yearly and has an open submission policy. One of its goals is to aid new writers by providing substantially more detailed feedback than is common in the SF publishing industry. History The roots of Leading Edge and other science fiction efforts at Brigham Young University (BYU) began with a one-day symposium on science fiction held on January 20, 1976. Four years later, Orson Scott Card gave a speech at the university about morality in writing, which showed some of the students and faculty that a serious, academic forum for discussion of science fiction writing was a possibility at BYU, but there weren't enough students interested in trying to make things work at that time. This changed in February 1982 when Ben Bova was invited to speak at a university forum event. The department in charge assigned Marion Smith, the professor whose name is now part of the title of the Life, the Universe, & Everything symposium, to take care of Bova while he wasn't speaking. He and a handful of his writing students (including M. Shayne Bell) got together and held a discussion with Bova. This inspired those students to try to create something like that the following year, when they invited Card back to be the first guest of honor. The magazine was started by those same students, all members of a 1980 creative writing class at BYU. By the late 80s and early 90s, a new crop of young writers and editors had taken the helm at The Leading Edge, many of whom would go on to professional success. These included several Writers of the Future winners such as Russell Asplund, Grant Avery Morgan, and Lee Allred, future editor at Ace Books, Anne Sowards, writer and literary agent Michael Carr, and fantasy writer Brandon Sanderson. Since its beginnings, Leading Edge has published approximately twice a year (sometimes more, sometimes less), with one issue coming out in fall and one coming out in spring. In 2000, Leading Edge published a story that turned out to have been plagiarized by a prison inmate submitting it as his own work. Geoffrey A. Landis' 1994 novella \\"The Singular Habits of Wasps\\", originally published in the April 1994 issue of Analog, was submitted by Phillip S. Barcia, purchased by Leading Edge, and published in issue 39. A correction notice was published in issue 40 indicating the actual author of the story. , Leading Edge has published 69 issues.

The Zempl√©n Mountains have two sides: on the north Vilvit√°ny Hill, on the south Szerencs Hill. The village lies in the valley between the two. Although the north is mountainous the south is lower lying at around . On the north and south slopes there are fields and vineyards whose wines compete with those from Tokaj, and the fields bordering the vineyards offer a beautiful view of the Tatra Mountains. History It is not certain when the village was established, but it was some time during the Mongol invasion of Europe, or the earlier Hungarian invasion (). The first record of the village is in 1392 and the Monaky family owned it in the 13th century . The name of the village comes from Slavic monoh meaning \\"monk\\". During the Ottoman Empire the village was razed and in 1567 it was recorded as being just barren fields. Towards the end of this century the village was reinhabited and around 1570 a small castle was built in the Renaissance style. Later, the village was owned by the Andr√°ssy family who renovated the castle, but because it was too small they built another nearby in the Classical style. Ethnicity 93% of the population is Hungarian, with the remaining 7% being of Romany origin.

His Complete Guide to Heraldry, published in 1909, has become a standard work on heraldry in England. A barrister by profession, Fox- Davies worked on several notable cases involving the peerage, and also worked as a journalist and novelist. Quoted in Biography Fox-Davies' arms, as illustrated in his Complete Guide to Heraldry. Arthur Charles Davies (known as Charlie) was born in Bristol, the second son of Thomas Edmond Davies (1839-1908) and his wife Maria Jane Fox, the daughter and coheiress of Alderman John Fox, JP. Fox-Davies was brought up at Coalbrookdale in Shropshire, where his father worked for the Coalbrookdale Iron Company; his grandfather, Charles Davies of Cardigan in Wales, had been an ironmonger. He added his mother's maiden name to his own by deed poll on his nineteenth birthday in 1890, thereby changing his surname from Davies to Fox-Davies. In 1894, his father took the same course for himself and the rest of the family. Fox-Davies attended Ackworth School in Yorkshire, but was expelled in 1884 at the age of fourteen, after hitting one of the schoolmasters. He received no further formal education, but was admitted to Lincoln's Inn in 1901 and called to the bar in 1906. As a barrister, he practised on the South Eastern Circuit, at the Old Bailey, and at the Surrey and South London Sessions. He also prepared printed cases for peerage cases in the House of Lords. He married in 1901 Mary Ellen Blanche Crookes (1870‚Äì1935), daughter and coheiress of Septimus Wilkinson Crookes and Anne Blanche Harriet Proctor. They had a son, Harley Edmond Fitzroy Fox-Davies (1907‚Äì1941), and a daughter, Moyra de Somery Regan. His wife worked as an heraldic artist, often for her husband's publications, under the pseudonym \\"C. Helard\\". Neither the Fox nor the Davies families were armigerous, so in 1905, when Fox-Davies was 34 and already well- advanced in his career as a writer on heraldic and genealogical subjects, he organised posthumous grants of arms to both his grandfathers. The arms granted to Charles Davies were sable, a demi sun in splendour issuant in base or, a chief dancet√©e of the last, with, for crest, \\"a demi dragon rampant gules collared or, holding in the dexter claw a hammer proper\\"; those granted to John Fox were \\"per pale argent and gules, three foxes sejant counterchanged\\", with, for crest, a demi stag winged gules collared argent. Fox-Davies bore the Davies arms with a crescent for cadency, and intended to quarter them with the Fox arms after his mother's death; but as she outlived him, dying in 1937, this was not possible. He also considered obtaining grants to his wife's families of Crookes and Proctor, which would entitled his children to additional quarterings, but at this point he no longer had the money for further grants of arms. He did obtain, in 1921, the grant of a badge, which consisted of a crown vallary gules. His motto was Da Fydd, Welsh for \\"good faith\\" and a pun on the name Davies. In addition to his writings on heraldry, he published a number of works of fiction, including detective stories such as The Dangerville Inheritance (1907), The Mauleverer Murders (1907) and The Duplicate Death (1910). He authored the article on \\"Heraldry\\" in the Catholic Encyclopedia. Politically Conservative, Fox-Davies \\"quite hopelessly\\" stood for election as a member of parliament for Merthyr Tydfil in 1910, 1923, and 1924. He was, however, successfully elected as a member of Holborn Borough Council in London. Fox Davies lived at 65 Warwick Gardens in Kensington, London, and had chambers at 23, Old Buildings, Lincoln's Inn. He died, aged 57, of portal hypertension and cirrhosis of the liver, having lain ill in his home for several weeks. He was buried at the parish church in Coalbrookdale. Heraldic writings The Royal Arms as depicted in The Art of Heraldry. Fox- Davies's writing on heraldry is characterised by a passionate attachment to heraldry as art and history and also as law. He was something of a polemicist, and issued one of his most controversial works, The Right to Bear Arms, under the pseudonym X. However, he always supported his arguments with specific historical and manuscript evidence. He was the editor of the Genealogical Magazine from 1895‚Äì1906. He conducted a lifelong campaign against the bearing of coats of arms without lawful authority in accordance with the Law of Arms, whether that authority was a right recognised at the Visitations conducted by heralds between the 16th to 18th centuries or, more commonly, a right deriving from a specific grant entered in the records of the College of Arms. In support of this campaign, he produced a directory which attempted to list all living bearers of arms in England and Wales who could prove such authority, under the title Armorial Families. This served as an incentive to families who had not got such authority to regularise their position at the College of Arms and the size of the work increased considerably until its final edition in 1929, which remains the most comprehensive published record (the records of the College of Arms being largely unpublished) of post-Victorian heraldry in Britain. Many of the arms were illustrated with specially commissioned heraldic drawings, and Fox-Davies drew on this large resource when illustrating his more systematic treatises on heraldry. The most lavish of these was The Art of Heraldry: An Encyclop√¶dia of Armory, which was originally conceived as an English translation of a German publication (Str√∂hl's Heraldischer Atlas) but which was transformed, in Fox-Davies's hands, into a largely original work specifically directed to the history, theory and practice of English heraldry, with illustrations in black and white and in colour throughout. This large 500-page book was first published in 1904 and was re-issued in black and white only in 1976 by an American publisher and in 1986 in colour by a London publisher. Much of the material in this book was re-used in a shorter, cheaper and more popular exposition of contemporary English heraldic practice, A Complete Guide to Heraldry, which proved very successful and influential. This too has been reprinted several times. Another even shorter guide was Heraldry Explained, but even this balanced a clear and didactic text with plentiful illustration. Fox-Davies's emphasis on practical and officially authorised heraldry caused him to showcase mostly recent grants of arms. This was in contrast to the medieval emphasis of other scholars, of whom his most prominent critics were Oswald Barron, author of the celebrated article on heraldry in the 1911 edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, and Horace Round. Round, in an essay called \\"Heraldry and the Gent\\" (eventually published in his collection Peerage and Pedigree), ridiculed another thesis with which Fox-Davies was particularly associated, namely, that an English grant of arms was equivalent to a continental patent of nobility, and that, not only were all English armigers to that extent noblemen as well as gentlemen (if male), but that no one without an official right to bear a coat of arms could claim to be a gentleman at all. Fox-Davies's influence on English heraldry continued long after his death in 1928, not least because of his lawyerly insistence on backing his opinions with solid evidence, and because of the continuing popularity of his books with the general public and with expert heraldists alike. One of his admirers in the next generation was John Brooke-Little, Norroy and Ulster King of Arms and founder of the Heraldry Society, who edited a new edition of The Complete Guide to Heraldry and in many ways propagated similar, albeit somewhat less aggressively expressed, ideas. Fox-Davies never served as a herald or pursuivant at the College of Arms, but he was one of the 250 Gold Staff Officers who assisted at the Coronation of King George V.

Life Brener was born Roland Albert Brener on February 22, 1942 in Johannesburg. He studied art at Saint Martin's School of Art under Anthony Caro. He completed his academic training in 1965, and in 1967, Brener was one of the founders of the Stockwell Depot, a studio and exhibition space occupying part of a disused brewery in south London. Brener taught at Saint Martin's, at the University of California, Santa Barbara and at the University of Iowa before being appointed Associate Professor at the University of Victoria in 1974. He retired from teaching in 1997 and continued to live and work in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada until his death in 2006. Work Brener's early practice grew from the formalist innovations of his contemporaries at Saint Martin's. During the 1980s his work developed a more playful individuality as he began to incorporate consumer items, most often toys, and experiment with kinetic sculpture driven by electronic motors or computers. In his later work he began to use the computer as a design tool to produce fantastical distortions of everyday images and objects which were then fabricated in wood or synthetic materials. Exhibitions Brener represented Canada at the S√£o Paulo Art Biennial in 1987 and the Venice Biennale in 1988. In 2000, Brener exhibited Swinger at Deitch Projects in New York, and in 2006 he was in Part Two, a duo exhibition with Mowry Baden at the Art Gallery of Greater Victoria. Public works His public sculpture Radioville, a re- working of his earlier sculptures Endsville and Capital Z, was installed in 2005 on the site of an old CBC radio-antenna tower in central Toronto, Ontario.

The meaning is different when considering the actual and most common use of the term. Today a collateral warranty generally defines an agreement ancillary to another principal contract and/or a letter of appointment. For the benefice of a third party, it imposes an extended duty of care and a broader liability on two separate parties involved in a contract. Collateral warranties may be provided by designers, building contractors and specialist sub-contractors. The need for collateral warranties exists when the party that commissions a building will not carry the burden in the event of defects. For instance, when an architect is appointed to design a group of dwellings for a developer. If the developer intends to sell the building to a housing association, due to privity of contract the architect would normally only be contractually liable to the developer should defects arise. The collateral warranty establishes a contractual relationship between the housing association and the architect against defect.

It is located on Tacoma's eastside. Creation The federal government created the community of Salishan during World War II to house workers in the area's war time industries and military personnel, and their families. It was planned to have 2,000 units (1,600 permanent residencies plus 400 temporary ones). This plan was similar to ones that created communities in Seattle and King County during this same time. The Salishan project was plagued by difficulties common during the war. Trees from the original property were used, but difficulties arose due to limited labor and war-related delays. The sewer system was delivered late, and at one point a snowstorm brought progress to a complete halt. However, on 1 May 1943, over 600 families moved into the new development. At that time, Salishan was almost as large as the nearby community of Puyallup, then a small farming community. Problems continued, however, in the form of poor telephone service and archaic appliances. Additionally, the sudden increase in population put a strain on the Tacoma Public Schools, putting the Salishan School at more than double its capacity. Salishan was notable from the outset in ways that has continued to be true. At a time when the nation's housing market was thoroughly segregated by race, Salishan was racially integrated on purpose. In addition, after the Vietnam War, Salishan also became an important gateway community for new Americans. By the time Salishan was demolished in 2002 to make way for its redevelopment, its residents were about 25% Vietnamese, 25% Cambodian, and about 13% African-American. New Salishan remains one of the regions' neighborhood most diverse by race, language, national origin, income, homeowner-renter, age, ability and disability. Post-War boom By the end of the War, the federal government transferred Salishan to the Tacoma Housing Authority. From that time to the present, Salishan has been an important part of the City of Tacoma's supply of affordable housing. Even during the war, Salishan's population included many low-income families. Despite the wartime boom in shipyard industry, 12 percent of Salishan families relied on public assistance, which would eventually lead to increasing post-war poverty rates. The demand for Salishan housing increased after VJ Day as veterans returned home. Federal legislation extended the life of the temporary wartime developments. However, faced with the growing concern of poverty, the military instituted a minimum income requirement, resulting in lower-income military personnel being denied entry into the Salishan community. Crime also became an increasing problem, leading some bus drivers to refuse to drive into the Salishan area without plainclothes police officers on board to avoid harassment. In addition, the diverse community began to see early indications of racial tensions. In 1949, the Boy Scouts of America attempted to organize racially separated troops in the Salishan area. However, black voters rejected the idea, resulting in the formation of the first integrated Scout troop in the Tacoma area. Despite the crime problems, Salishan was recognized as a center for cultural events. The Sunday edition of the Tacoma News Tribune lauded Salishan for being a \\"lesson in enterprise and thinking,\\" with a large range of cultural activities available to residents. Salishan's population continued to grow. In 1950, a population of 6,700 was reached, of which nearly half were children. In attempts to create a utopian community environment, business sponsored home beautification contests in the area. Despite this, Salishan remained a fairly poor area, which eventually led to its conversion to a low-income housing area. Conversion to low-income housing By the early 1950s, Salishan's income was hovering at around $1,900 per year (approximately $16,000 as of March 2006). This led to increasing pressure on the Tacoma Housing Authority to convert Salishan to a low-income housing property. This was met with opposition from the local real estate industry, which feared that Salishan being converted to a low-income area would have a negative effect on house prices in the surrounding areas. In addition, the industry argued that there was little need, with around half of the housing units unoccupied. However, on 24 May 1951, the Tacoma City Council voted to convert 900 units to low-income housing and demolish the rest. In the mid-1950s the community's \\"center\\" was the Hogan's grocery store/drugstore/variety store/soda fountain in a large building on East 44th St. Incorporated in the drugstore segment was a soda fountain bar with the old style cushioned, spinning stools the length of the bar. This building, located across the parking lot from the Tacoma Housing Authority administration and maintenance facility, went through a variety of iterations to serve the community. In the later 1950s, after the grocery store complex was replaced by the Piggly Wiggly complex at 40th & Portland Avenue, the building became a distribution center for the distribution of government commodities such as cheese, powdered milk, canned meat, flour, sugar, etc. More changes up into the 1990s included it becoming the Eastside Neighborhood Center and numerous other offices for community services. The conversion to low-income housing resulted in an increase in minority population, a trend that continued throughout the years. It has also been an important \\"first home\\" for families immigrating to America. By 2000, for example, approximately half of the Salishan families were first generation Americans. By 1955, one-third of Salishan's population consisted of people of color. A non-discrimination policy had long been in place by the Tacoma Housing Authority. As the immigrant and minority population increased, so did poverty rates. Salishan increasingly became known as unsafe. With incomes only increasing modestly, crime rates in Salishan gradually rose over the next few decades. Salishan in the 1990s By the late 1980s, Salishan had become a center for gang activity and drug trading and was increasingly viewed as burdensome by residents of Tacoma. Residents of the areas around Salishan, which had always been more middle-class, complained that the neighborhood was negatively affecting property prices, crime rates, and perception of the rest of the lower east side. In 1990, Salishan reported 331 violent crimes, for a rate of nearly one per day, for a rate of approximately 5,517 violent crimes per 100,000 population relative to Tacoma's overall rate of 433 per 100,000. Increasing news coverage ensued, and the already strong calls for revitalization strengthened and broadened to include activists from Tacoma neighborhoods far away from Salishan. Community leaders organized youth activities and educational programs in hopes of reducing crime rates. These efforts were largely successful, and encouraged external charitable investment in the Salishan area. By 1996, violent crime rates had dropped to approximately 2,883 per 100,000, a rate nearly half of that only six years ago. Although the rate remained several times that of Tacoma's overall rate, an increasing perception of a revitalized Salishan became popular. In 1996, Washington State University opened the Salishan Learning Center, where local students could earn credits toward a bachelor's degree. New Salishan By 2000, Salishan's revitalization was common knowledge. Its reputation as an unsafe neighborhood continued. By the time, it was demolished, Salishan was a well-organized neighborhood of families who were very fond of it. However, the housing and the infrastructure were worn out. In April 2001, the Tacoma Housing Authority (THA) received a $35 million HOPE VI grant to revitalize Salishan. THA devised a $225 million full redevelopment plan. As of 2015, the plan has demolished all of the housing except for eleven original homes kept and refurbished as historic preservation. THA has built a new mixed-income neighborhood of about 1,400 dwelling units, both single family homes for sale and apartments for rent. THA used three homebuilders: Quadrant Homes, D.R. Horton and Tacoma-Pierce County Habitat for Humanity. The community includes two 55 unit buildings that are reserved for seniors. The first of these is International Place, owned and managed by Korean Women's Association. The other is Salishan Gardens, owned and managed by American Baptist Homes of the West. Salishan also has its own elementary school, the new Lister Elementary School. The commercial core has the region's largest primary health care and dental clinic, the Kimi and Dr. George Tanbara Clinic, built and operated by Community Health Care. The commercial core is still unfinished. Plans call for a public library, a grocery store, a child care center, a credit union, office and programming space for nonprofit education and training services and community space.

The sport is a hybrid between tennis and quoits, and is played with either the rubber disk or ring, or a similarly-sized rope ring. The sport has been standardized and formalized in several countries under names such as \\"tennikoit\\" or \\"ring tennis\\". American sources from the 1930s and 1940s attribute the origin, or at least formal establishment of the game, to Cleve F. Shaffer. In 1981 Mariano Herrera and Alejandro Nougues from Argentina won the first and only Deck Tennis World Championship celebrated in the sunny beaches of Punta del Este, Uruguay. Rules Most games of deck tennis, unlike the official tennikoit form, are informal and without set rules or a governing body, so rules tend to vary. Usually it is played on a court roughly 40 to 50 feet (11 to 14 m) long and 15 to 20 feet (5 to 7 m) wide and may be played as either as singles or doubles. The midcourt net is usually the height, or higher than that of a tennis net. The goal of the game is to serve (throw) the ring into the opponent's court, and the opponent tries to catch it before it falls and immediately throw it back from the same position where it was caught, with a point being scored when the server managed to land a quoit on the opponent's side of the court. The scoring system is commonly the same as regular tennis: Love, 15, 30, 40, Deuce, Advantage, Game. This is in contrast with tennikoit, where sets are played to 21 individual points, similar to badminton. In Popular Culture In the 1936 film Picadilly Jim, Robert Montgomery as \\"Piccadilly Jim\\" is depicted playing the game with his romantic rival in the film Ralph Forbes as \\"Lord Frederick Priory\\" on the deck of an ocean liner.

He was appointed to that position by President Karzai during a cabinet reshuffle on March 21, 2006 and approved by the 249-seat lower house on April 20, 2006. He was previously the Senior Advisor on International Affairs to President Hamid Karzai. On January 18, 2010 Zalmai Rassoul became the Foreign Minister of Afghanistan. Early years Spanta was born on 15 December 1954 in Karukh, Herat Province, where he completed his primary and secondary education. Spanta is fluent in Dari Persian, Pashto, Turkish, German and English.

On November 2, 2004, she was the first woman elected as president of the Tribe. She served until being impeached on June 29, 2006, several months short of the two-year term. The major controversy was over her effort to provide for women on the reservation needing family planning services after the South Dakota legislature banned most abortions throughout the state. The tribal council impeached her for proceeding without gaining their consensus. A founder of community-based health clinics while living and working in California for two decades, Fire Thunder was among founders of the Oglala Lakota Women's Society after her return to the reservation in 1986. She serves on the National Advisory Board of the National Organization on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (NOFAS) and has worked at a shelter for domestic abuse. She is the coordinator of the Native Women's Society of the Great Plains. Early life and education  Born Cecilia Apple on October 24, 1946 on the Pine Ridge Reservation, she is the third of seven daughters of Stephen and Lollie (Featherman) Apple. Her father was a traditional singer and her mother a culture-keeper; the family spoke Lakota at home.Sam Hurst, \\"Cecilia Fire Thunder a 'person of character'\\", Rapid City Journal, 18 December 2005, accessed 5 June 2011 Her grandparents are Frank and Theresa (Garcia) Apple and John and Mary (Ice) Featherman. Her sisters are Shirley Murphy, Mary Hawk, Dinah Apple, Carmine Red Eagle, Joanne Apple, and Wanda Apple (Wanda is deceased). When Cecilia went to the Catholic Red Cloud Indian School, she had to speak English in class. In 1963 her family moved from the reservation to Los Angeles, California in a Bureau of Indian Affairs-sponsored urban relocation program. The BIA encouraged Native American migration to cities to take advantage of educational and job opportunities. Marriage and family Apple married Ben Fire Thunder while living in Los Angeles, and they had two sons, James and John Fire Thunder. She has two granddaughters from her son John, Katie and Hannah Fire Thunder. Organizations and affiliations As a young nurse in California, Fire Thunder started community-based health clinics in Los Angeles and San Diego, learning to work in a different culture and to seek resources locally. She was able to persuade doctors from the University of Southern California and the University of California Los Angeles to donate time to the clinic. After more than 20 years away, in 1986 Fire Thunder returned to the Pine Ridge Reservation and started work at the Bennett County Hospital. She was among the founders of the Oglala Lakota Women's Society. From her years working as a nurse, she had learned of the physical, developmental and learning problems for children born to alcoholic mothers, and encouraged women to get preventive treatment. She serves on the National Advisory Board of the National Organization on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (NOFAS), founded in 1990.\\"About: Directors\\" , National Organization on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome In her work for Cangleska, Inc., a domestic violence shelter, she also dealt with women who suffered from abuse related to poverty and alcoholism on the reservation. A Lakota native speaker, Fire Thunder has also been active in tribal efforts to recover and revive use of the Lakota language among its young people and adults. She sees use of the language as integral to their culture. Tribal presidency On November 2, 2004, Cecilia Fire Thunder was elected as the first female president of the Oglala Sioux Tribe of the Pine Ridge Reservation to serve the two-year term. She defeated both Russell Means, notable as an activist in the American Indian Movement (AIM), and the incumbent John Yellow Bird Steele. In 2005 the tribal council suspended her, initially for 20 days, in an action that ran to 66 days. They began impeachment proceedings related to allegations that she used tribal land as collateral for a US$38 million loan from the Shakopee Tribe in Minnesota to help pay off short-term debt of the Oglala tribe that totaled $20 million; the remainder of the loan was invested for casino expansion to generate revenue. Fire Thunder said the allegations were false, and she had openly negotiated the loan as part of straightening out the tribe's financial status. After the complaint was dismissed by the council on December 30, Fire Thunder returned to her position. In 2005 Nebraska state officials, Attorney General and Congressman Tom Osborne, approached the OST tribal council suggesting collaboration for increased policing at Whiteclay, Nebraska, a perennial problem because of its extensive beer sales to people from the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Possession and consumption of alcohol is illegal at the reservation, but alcoholism is widespread, contributing to many social and health problems. In a unique agreement, the state proposed to deputize OST police (additional staff to be hired) to patrol Whiteclay to prevent beer from being transported to the reservation. Initially the council rejected the proposal, saying the $100,000 grant would be insufficient. It later approved the measure.MELANIE BLOOM, \\"Pine Ridge tribe tentatively accepts federal money\\", KOLN/KGIN-TV, 31 May 2005, accessed 17 February 2012 In March 2006 Fire Thunder announced her intent to create a Planned Parenthood clinic on her own land, within the reservation.Tim Giago, \\"Oglala Sioux president on state abortion law\\" , Indianz.com, 21 March 2006, accessed 5 June 2011 She was responding to the state legislature's passage of a law banning virtually all abortions within South Dakota. She believed that her constituents needed full family planning services, and that the sovereign reservation would not be subject to state laws. In 2004 public opinion polls had shown that 68% of people surveyed in South Dakota supported options for abortions in some cases, so the new law generated controversy across the state.Jodi Rave, \\"Fire Thunder under fire\\", Rapid City Journal, 28 July 2006, accessed 5 June 2011 Fire Thunder's plan attracted widespread media coverage and controversy within the reservation. Some tribal members marched in protest in May 2006 against the planned clinic; others objected to the way Fire Thunder had proceeded.\\"Protest march set for Tuesday\\", Rapid City Journal, 27 May 2006, accessed 5 June 2011 At their council meeting on May 31, 2006, the Oglala Sioux tribal Council suspended Fire Thunder from her duties as president, saying she had not gained their consensus before inviting Planned Parenthood to the reservation. In addition, the Council issued a ban on all abortions on tribal land. A month after the suspension, the tribal council voted on June 29, 2006 to impeach Fire Thunder from her duties as Tribal President. They made six charges against her, notably related to the Planned Parenthood clinic, for which they said she had not gained tribal council consensus. Other charges were that Fire Thunder used the media, the U.S. Post Office and the Oglala Sioux Tribe to solicit funds for the clinic. On June 30, 2006, Alex White Plume, tribal vice-president, assumed the role of President Pro Tem, which he held until the November 2006 election. The council and succeeding chief never organized to spend the federal grant money to support deputized police to patrol at Whiteclay, and the funds were rescinded in late 2007.AP, \\"Two years after 'historic' agreement, no tribe patrols in Whiteclay\\", Rapid City Journal, 14 May 2007, accessed 13 June 2011 During the same period, in 2006 and 2007 tribal activists held blockades on the road inside the reservation to prevent beer from being brought from Whiteclay and continued to demand action by Nebraska. Fire Thunder challenged the impeachment decision, but was unsuccessful. As of 2010, she is the coordinator of the Native Women's Society of the Great Plains. Legacy and honors Because of her groundbreaking election as president of the Oglala Sioux Tribe and work on women's issues, Fire Thunder has frequently been invited to speak at universities and groups about Lakota women and her experiences, as seen in the following: *March 2010, Women's History Month, New York University, Center for the Study of Gender and Sexuality\\"Women‚Äôs History Month Lecture with Cecilia Fire Thunder\\", 11 March 2010, New York University *September 2010, Tribal Leaders Summit, Bismarck, North Dakota - speaking on issues of domestic violence and concentrating resources for childrenJenny Michael, \\"Tribal Leaders Summit tackles domestic violence, law enforcement issues\\", Bismarcc Tribune, 9 September 2010, accessed 5 June 2011 References * \\"Tribal council outlaws abortion\\", Argus Leader, 31 May 2006 * Steven Argus, \\"Abortion Banned On Pine Ridge, Cecilia Fire Thunder Removed From Presidency\\", Santa Cruz Indy Media, 15 June 2006 * Jacqueline Keeler, \\"Fire Thunder Impeachment and the Rights of Women\\", TiyospayeNow Blog, July 2006 Category:1946 births Category:Living people Category:Female Native American leaders Category:People from the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, South Dakota Category:American nurses Category:American women nurses Category:Native American activists Category:Lakota leaders Category:American health activists ","title":"Cecilia Fire Thunder"},{"id":"4493312","text":"The House of Representatives (Majlis al-Nuwaab) is the lower house of the Parliament of Yemen.

Since the civil war, the House of Representatives had held semi-regular sessions in San'aa in Houthi-held territory. In April 2019, the first session was held in Seiyun, in Hadi-controlled Hadhramaut Governorate.https://debriefer.net/en/news-7825.html Latest elections The last parliamentary election in Yemen took place in 2003.

Formally dedicated in 1879, it is the first cantilever bridge constructed in the United States. It has a three-span continuous under-deck truss used by Norfolk Southern Railway to carry trains between Lexington and Danville. It has been designated as a National Civil Engineering Landmark. History In 1851, the Lexington & Danville Railroad, with Julius Adams as Chief Engineer, retained John A. Roebling to build a railroad suspension bridge across the Kentucky River for a line connecting Lexington and Danville, Kentucky west of the intersection of the Dix and Kentucky Rivers. In 1855, the company ran out of money and the project was resumed by Cincinnati Southern Railroad in 1873 following a proposal by C. Shaler Smith for a cantilever design using stone towers designed by John A. Roebling (who designed the Brooklyn Bridge). The bridge was erected using the cantilever design with a three-span continuous under-deck truss and opened in 1877 on the Cincinnati Southern Railway. It was tall and long: the tallest bridge above a navigable waterway in North America and the tallest railroad bridge in the world until the early 20th century. Construction was completed using 3,654,280 pounds of iron at a total cost of $404,373.31. In 1879 President Rutherford B. Hayes and Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman attended the dedication. Around 1908, Kentucky River High Bridge and the surrounding area was a popular destination for local Kentucky artist Paul Sawyier. Sawyier made many friends living in the area and the landscape was the subject of many of his famous paintings. In addition to making many friends with local residents, he met the love of his life, Mary Thomas (Mayme) Bull during her travels to the Kentucky River area. She became the subject of one of his paintings in 1908, ‚ÄòPortrait of Mayme Bull in River Landscape‚Äô. After years of heavy railroad use, the bridge was rebuilt by Gustav Lindenthal in 1911. Lindenthal reinforced the foundations and rebuilt the bridge around the original structure. To keep railroad traffic flowing, the track deck was raised by 30 feet during construction and a temporary trestle was constructed. In 1929, an additional set of tracks was built to accommodate increased railroad traffic and the original limestone towers were removed. The bridge is still accessible by Kentucky State Route 29. In 2005 the state and county jointly reopened a park near the bridge (which had been closed since the mid 1960s) at the top of the palisades above the river. It included a restored open air dance pavilion, first used in the 19th century; as well as a new playground, picnic area, and viewing platform that overlooks the bridge and river's edge from the top of the palisades.

National roads 60 and 61 intersect in the town. In the late Middle Ages, R√≥≈ºan emerged as an important trade center of northeastern Mazovia. Enjoying support of Mazovian Dukes, especially Janusz I of Warsaw, in 1378 it received town charter, a became a capital of a separate province, the Land of R√≥≈ºan. In 1525, Mazovia was annexed by the Kingdom of Poland, and R√≥≈ºan became seat of a starosta, part of Masovian Voivodeship (1526‚Äì1795). In 1565, the town had 330 houses and population of app. 2000. It also probably had as many as 6 churches, and a castle, which guarded nearby border with Prussia. Furthermore, there was a bridge over the Narew, which fortified the importance of Rozan as a trade and administrative center. The town prospered until the disastrous Swedish invasion of Poland (1655 - 1660), when it was ransacked and burned by the invaders. Following the Partitions of Poland and the Congress of Vienna, Rozan in 1815 became part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland, where it remained until World War One. After the January Uprising, which was widely supported by local residents, in 1870 Russians stripped R√≥≈ºan of its town charter. Nevertheless, R√≥≈ºan was a strong garrison of the Imperial Russian Army, with four forts, built after 1886. R√≥≈ºan regained town rights in 1919, and by 1939, its population grew to 5800. The town was completely destroyed during World War Two, only 5% buildings remained by 1945. The crossing of the Narew at R√≥≈ºan had significant military importance in the first half of the 20th century. The Russian Imperial Army fortified and garrisoned R√≥≈ºan around 1900. The was bult at that time. It was defended against German attacks in 1915 in the course of World War I. Fortified further before 1939, it was defended by the Polish army in the course of the German Invasion of Poland in September, 1939. Then, in the course of the fighting in 1944, the Red Army seized a bridgehead across the Narew at R√≥≈ºan, which it used as one of the springboards for the January 1945 Vistula‚ÄìOder Offensive. At the outbreak of World War Two, R√≥≈ºan was home to some 1,800 Jews. From March of 1942 until September, a slave labor camp for Jews was operated within the R√≥≈ºan Fortress. In November of 1942, the Jews were sent back to the nearby ghetto in Mak√≥w Mazowiecki, whereupon they were deported to Auschwitz. Over 1,400 Rozan Jews were murdered in the Holocaust.

Life and career  Texas-born Forman made his first film for Jesse L. Lasky's production company in 1914. With the exception of service at the front during World War I, he had a successful career as both an actor and director. Forman directed Lon Chaney's Shadows (1922), but his biggest achievement was realised directing the second screen version of Owen Wister's The Virginian (1923). After his career faltered, he was reduced to working on cheap Poverty Row melodramas. Forman is also known for his work with Edith Taliaferro in Young Romance. Forman was set to direct the Columbia film The Wreck, which was to start shooting on November 8, 1926; however on the evening of November 7, Forman died by suicide by shooting himself through the heart at his parents' home in Venice, California.

He was a founding member of the artists' group General Idea, was president and director of Printed Matter, Inc., and started the NY Art Book Fair and the LA Art Book Fair.  Early life  Tims' father was an Air Force officer, and as a result, the family moved often; Tims spent his childhood in various places across Canada. He was an avid reader as a child, and it was through his reading habits that he explored his interest in art, architecture, spirituality and the occult, which would remain significant touchstones throughout his life and career, especially in his post-General Idea solo career. He attended the University of Manitoba as an architecture student in the mid-1960s. He met Ron Gabe (aka Felix Partz) at the University of Manitoba. While at architecture school, he came to be interested in and involved with theories of radical education and communes. His interest in and experience with alternate methods of education began at the age of 12, where his primary school experimented with a form of self-directed learning. He, along with a group of fellow U of Manitoba students, dropped out to form a commune, whose activities included a free press (called \\"The Loving Couch Press\\") and a free school (called \\"The School\\"). It was via his activities with the Loving Couch Press that Bronson came into contact with other underground presses. This, in turn, exposed him to the Situationist International and Fluxus, which would have a significant impact on the ideas and methods pursued as part of General Idea. In the late 1960s, Bronson trained as a facilitator in group-process for communes and cooperative communities while apprenticing with a psychologist at the University of Regina. In his role as an apprentice, he travelled across Canada, including to Simon Fraser University. At Simon Fraser, he met Brian Carpenter, who deepened his exposure to radical communication theories. He also encountered the InterMedia artist collective, and Slobodan Saia-Levy (aka Jorge Zontal). In 1969, Bronson's involvement in communes and radical education theories and practices took him to Toronto, to investigate the Rochdale College experiment. It was through some of the members of Rochdale College that Bronson deepened his friendships with Felix Partz and Jorge Zontal (each having arrived in Toronto for different reasons). They, along with several others, became involved in the countercultural performance and \\"happenings\\" scene that centered around Toronto's Theatre Passe Muraille. Through Theatre Passe Muraille, Bronson apprenticed with Coach House Press (he also did graphic design for Passe Muraille). General Idea The General Idea artists group, initially a loose collective of five to seven people, was founded in 1969 by Bronson, Jorge Zontal and Felix Partz, Partz's then- girlfriend Mimi Paige, and Granada Gazelle (a.k.a. Sharon Venne). Among the group's various activities, The trio founded FILE Megazine, a visual magazine, which they edited and published from 1972 until 1989. In 1974 they founded Art Metropole, an international publisher, distributor and archive of artists' books, video and multiples, which they conceived as an extension of the self- mythologization of General Idea. AA Bronson was the director of Art Metropole from 1974 through 1984, and again from 1996 through 1998. The three worked and lived together for 25 years, until their collaboration was terminated with the death of both Zontal and Partz in 1994. General Idea continues to exhibit internationally in private galleries and museums, as well as undertaking countless temporary public art projects around the world. AA Bronson has been working independently since that time. He is currently represented by Esther Schipper, Berlin and Maureen Paley, London. Solo career AA Bronson's solo artwork has dealt with trauma, loss, death and healing. While caring for friends coping with their AIDS-related illnesses, Bronson began to participate in Body Electric (and related) therapeutic massage and healing workshops and seminars in California (he partook in the first of such seminars in 1989). His initial motivation for this was to become a midwife to the dying. Over the course of the next eleven years, he would return to California to continue to take part in, and deepen his knowledge of, alternative healing and therapeutic bodywork practices. After the deaths of Partz and Zontal, an aspect of Bronson's grief manifested as a creative crisis. His first works are, in fact, elegies both to his General Idea partners and his own identity as part of the group: a deathbed portrait of Felix Partz (Felix, June 5, 1994, 1994‚Äì99), a triptych of Zontal shortly before his death (Jorge, February 3, 1994, 2000) and a full-body nude self-portrait in the shape of a coffin (AA Bronson, August 22, 2000, 2000). He began working professionally as a healer initially out of personal calling, and this professional identity as a healer was soon integrated into his artistic identity. Bronson has said that he approached his identity as a healer in the same way that General Idea approached their identities as artists: the word was so overused, it had lost any particular meaning and significance, and so he was free both to assume the 'drag' of a healer, and consequently, to invest the word with his own meaning. The first expression of his healing practice as an artistic performance emerged at a solo show at the Frederic Giroux gallery in Paris in 2003. His healing practice garnered significant attention in the press due to his inclusion of an anal massage technique, a practice he learned through a teacher Bronson met during his extensive therapeutic massage schooling in California. In 2004, Bronson began working at Printed Matter as its director. Through his involvement in Printed Matter, he founded the NY Art Book Fair in 2005 (which in turn birthed the LA Art Book Fair). The annual NY Art Book Fair, which hosts over 200 independent presses, booksellers, antiquarian dealers, artists and publishers from twenty countries.NY Art Book Fair about page Via his work at Printed Matter and at the Book Fairs, Bronson began to be introduced to a network of a younger generation of artists, with whom he began and continues to collaborate regularly. A significant aspect of this collaboration took form in a series of site-specific \\"secret\\" performances entitled Invocation of the Queer Spirits, conceived in collaboration with artist Peter Hobbs. They, along with a series of select collaborators, would collectively ritually invoke the spirits of the dead in various locales. The ritual has been performed in Banff, New Orleans, Winnipeg, Governor's Island, the Fire Island Pines. These performances were always private. A book documenting this process (including its conception and photographic evidence of its remnants) was published by Creative Time in 2011. Since then, the Invocation of the Queer Spirits has been performed in Berlin and Paris, among other venues. In 2009, Bronson enrolled as a Masters of Divinity candidate at Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York. While at Union, he co-founded the Institute for Art, Religion and Social Justice with Kathryn Reklis. In 2013, Bronson was invited to Berlin to be a resident as part of the DAAD Berliner Kunstler program. After the course of the yearlong residency was over, he and his partner, Mark Jan Krayenhoff van de Leur, decided to remain in Berlin, where they both currently reside.  Exhibitions  He had his first solo institutional exhibition outside of General Idea in 2000 at the Vienna Secession in Austria, followed closely by a solo exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago (2001), a solo exhibition at the MIT List Visual Arts Center, Cambridge (2002), and another at The Power Plant in Toronto (2003) and the Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery, Vancouver (2004). He was featured in the Montreal and Whitney Biennials (2000 and 2002). With his partner, Mark Jan Krayenhoff van de Leur, he was one of three finalists in a public competition for a monument to homosexuals persecuted by the Nazis, for the city of Vienna, Austria. In 2010, a Bronson aforementioned Felix, June 5, 1994 appeared in the Hide/Seek exhibit at the United States' National Portrait Gallery, but the artist sought to withdraw the work after the censorship controversy.Taylor, Kate, \\"Canadian Museum Backs Smithsonian Protest\\" , The New York Times Arts Beat blog, December 17, 2010, 6:19 pm. Retrieved 2101-12-21. The Bronson piece was on loan to the show \\"from the National Gallery of Canada. Marc Mayer, the director of the Canadian museum, urged the National Portrait Gallery to respect Mr. Bronson's wishes and remove the work but did not formally demand its return,\\" and the National Portrait Gallery ultimately declined to remove the work.Taylor, Kate, \\"National Portrait Gallery Rejects Artist‚Äôs Request to Remove His Work\\" , The New York Times Arts Beat blog, December 20, 2010, 2:20 pm. Retrieved 2101-12-21. Bronson continues to exhibit regularly. Recent exhibitions of note include The Temptation of AA Bronson at Witte de With Center for Contemporary Art Rotterdam (2013), a kind of experimental solo show which mapped Bronson's various lifelong influences and current collaborations with younger artists. In 2015, he had twin shows at the Salzburger and Grazer Kunstvereins, for which he, in collaboration with his partner Krayenhoff van de Leur and artist Adrian Hermanides, created a massive tent structure called Folly (Lana's Boudoir), which was subsequently featured in Art Basel's Unlimited exhibition in 2016. Curating AA Bronson has also curated exhibitions. In the late 1970s, he curated a series of exhibitions at A Space, Toronto, including an exhibition of the multiples of Joseph Beuys. In 1984 he was co-curator of Evidence of the Avant-Grade..., Art Metropole, Toronto, a survey of artists' books, multiples, and ephemera. In 1987 he curated From Sea to Shining Sea for the Power Plant, Toronto, a history of artist-directed activity in Canada from the post-war period to 1986. In 1991 he curated Learn to Read Art, an exhibition of 287 artists' books and multiples from the permanent collection of Art Metropole presented at the Art Basel, Basel, Switzerland. In the mid-nineties he curated a series of exhibitions for Art Metropole, including Intermedia, a look at Canada's first artist-run center. More recently, as Director of Printed Matter, Inc., New York, he has curated exhibitions related to artists' publishing, notably \\"I will not make any more boring art\\", an exhibition of books, prints and ephemera from the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, Halifax. His exhibition, again titled Learn to Read Art, a history of Printed Matter Inc. with more than 300 publications, editions, and posters, was presented at the Museo de Arte Contemporaneo de Castilla y Leon (Seville, Spain), Badischer Kunstverein (Karlsruhe, Germany), and at MoMA PS1 in 2009. Bronson has been deeply involved with publishing, promoting publishing activity as a primary artistic form. In 1979 he co-edited Performance by Artists with Peggy Gale for Art Metropole, Toronto. In 1983 they co-edited another resource publication, Museums by Artists, Art Metropole. In 1987 the Power Plant catalogue Sea to Shining Sea attempted to construct a history since the post-war period of artist-initiated activity in Canada, including the formation of the artist-run centers. He also published artists' books for Art Metropole by Jeff Wall, Colin Campbell, Lisa Steele, Hamish Fulton, Hans Haacke, and others, as well as conceiving the series Little Cockroach Press, of which he edited the first few issues. As director and president of Printed Matter, he has published many books, including titles by Scott Treleaven, Terence Koh, Tauba Auerbach, Martha Rosler and Temporary Services (Chicago). AA Bronson has written widely, including texts for FILE Megazine, and General Idea publications, as well as essays for art magazines and catalogues. He has published numerous artist books and projects under his own imprint, Media Guru. His own memoir, Negative Thoughts, was published by the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago in 2001.  Collections and awards  AA Bronson's solo work is in the collections of the National Gallery of Canada (Ottawa), The Whitney Museum (New York), the Jewish Museum (New York), the Agnes Etherington Art Centre (Kingston), and private collections. AA Bronson has been awarded the Skowhegan Award (2006), the Governor General's Visual Arts and Media Award (2002), the Bell Award in Video Art (2001), and a Chalmers Fellowship (2003). Other awards include The Gershon Iskowitz Prize (1988), The Lifetime Achievement Award from the City of Toronto (1993), the Banff Centre for the Arts National Award (1993), and the Jean A.

It lies on the river Liwiec (also sometimes called the Liw), approximately west of Wƒôgr√≥w and east of Warsaw. History Liw probably started as a gord guarding the ford across Liwiec river and the eastern borders of Duchy of Masovia, and the stronghold was moved from the original site to the area of the present castle, built in 1429, in the 13th century. First written document about Liw comes from 1304, during Masovian duke Boles≈Çaw II of Masovia rule. Liw received town rights in 1421 or earlier, and between 1493 and 1789 there were two separate towns, Liw Stary (\\"Old Liw\\") and Liw Nowy (\\"New Liw\\"), and this tradition survived in two So≈Çtys(Schulthei√ü) offices in the present village. Under the Masovian dukes the town was developing rapidly lying on the border with Grand Duchy of Lithuania, it became the capital of ziemia liwska ('Land of Liw'), a judicial center for the eastern Masovia region, it held a weekly Street market, and three times a year there was a fair there. It was finally incorporated into Crown of the Kingdom of Poland in 1537, upon the settlement between the last princes of Masovia Anna of Masovia and Polish king Sigismund I the Old. Town continued its development and growth into the 17th century, when the wars, Deluge (history) and Great Northern War, brought a physical destruction and a serious decline to the municipality. It lost some of its importance to Wƒôgr√≥w but its final demise was brought by the Partitions of Poland as it was incorporated into the Austrian Partition, the Liw lost its judicial, administrative and economic importance, Austrians dissolved the administrative and territorial unit of ziemia liwska and moved the seat of administrative and judicial powers to Siedlce. In 1807 town became part of the Duchy of Warsaw, and already resembled more a large village than a town. In 1815 it became part of the Russian Empire. During the November Uprising there took place a battle, Battle of Liw, between Polish insurrectionists forces and Russian army in April 1831, which led to the Russian forces withdrawing across the Liwiec river. Based on the Tsar's order Liw lost its status as a town and became a village in 1866 as the punishment for the town's participation in the January Uprising. The village has a population of 920. It has a ruin of Gothic castle (originally built by the Masovian princes before 1429) and a neo-Gothic church (built 1905-1907).

Economic branches included the manufacture of pottery, flour mills, prayer shawl weaving and the fur trade.Jewish Virtual Library: Kalyszyn After the Germans arrived in 1939, Jews were terrorized, robbed, and often kidnapped for forced labor. In 1940, a ghetto was established in Kaluszyn, and Jewish property was confiscated. Hundreds of Jews from surrounding communities were brought to the Kaluszyn ghetto, most with no possessions, money, or employment. Dozens, or perhaps hundreds, of Jews died in the ghetto of starvation and disease. In late summer 1942, many young Jews fled to the forests after hearing of the murders of the Jews of Warsaw and Minsk. In September, 1942, assisted by the Polish police, and possibly other auxiliaries, the Germans assembled the Jews at the market square. One Polish manager, Sheradzinsky, (the Berman plant) managed to free 30 of his employees from the assembly. Hundreds were murdered there and at the Jewish cemetery. The remaining Jews were taken by train to Treblinka where they were immediately murdered. A few managed to escape from the train.

The story is about a grandfather who hires a contract killer to assassinate his allergy-prone son-in-law. Production Zeyda and the Hitman was filmed in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. The title design was by Cuppa Coffee Studios, Toronto. The film was released on DVD on 5 September 2006, and carries an MPAA rating of NR. Based on a true story The film's storyline is based on the true-life Tully \\"peanut plot\\" case related in Adrian Humphreys' biography of Marvin \\"the Weasel\\" Elkind, titled The Weasel: A Double Life in the Mob. Jack Tully (named Gideon Schub in the film and played by Judd Hirsch) hired Marvin Elkind (named Nathan \\"The Nat\\" Winkler in the film and played by Danny Aiello) to kill Tully's son-in-law, Martin Fisher (named Jeff Klein in the film and played by Gil Bellows), who had a problematic relationship with Tully's daughter, Lynda. Moreover, Lynda had faxed her father a letter advising him that he could not see his grandchildren, aged 10 and five, without Fisher's permission. As Fisher was severely allergic to peanuts, Tully suggested that Elkind poison Fisher's food with a smear of peanut butter or his drink with drop of peanut oil, to trigger death by anaphylactic shock. Tully gave the would-be hitman a $1,000 downpayment for the hit, $200 to buy Fisher drinks, and the murder weapons: a jar of Kraft peanut butter and a bottle of peanut oil. Elkind, a police informant who also worked in the criminal underworld as well as volunteered as a security officer at the synagogue where he and Tully met, turned Tully in to the police and testified against him in court. Tully still had the receipts for the murder weapons in his pocket, when arrested.

It has two almost equal branches that have their confluence in their joint estuary at Carmarthen Bay. The Gwendraeth Fawr (Large Gwendraeth in English) is surprisingly the smaller and has its source in a series of springs to the north of Cross Hands, the most northerly of which rises to the north of Gorslas in the Llyn Llech Owain Country Park, just above the contour. Below Cross Hands, it skirts the northern edge of Mynydd Mawr Woodland Park, and flows to the south of Drefach. It crosses the contour to pass through Pontyberem, Pont Henri and Pontyates, by which time it is less than above sea level. Finally, it passes to the south of Kidwelly, to enter the estuary.Ordnance Survey, 1:50000 map The Gwendraeth Fach (small Gwendraeth in Welsh) flows further to the north having its source about 4 miles north of Cross Hands near the contour at Penrhiwgoch. Passing under the A48 road, it is soon below the contour, flowing in a south-westerly direction to the south of Llanddarog, Cwmisfael and Llangyndeyrn, before turning southwards through Mynyddygarreg. It reaches the estuary to the west of Kidwelly after passing through the town centre. The two branches follow almost parallel courses to the sea. The valleys of both rivers flow through a mixture of modestly steep coal mining communities and through the verdant agricultural land of Carmarthenshire. When Thomas Kymer built his canal to carry coal from pits at Pwll y Llygod on the banks of the Gwendraeth Fawr to Ythyn Frenig, about half a mile to the west of Kidwelly on the southern bank of the Gwendraeth Fach, the authorising act of Parliament included powers to divert the course of the Gwendraeth Fawr from Pwll y Llygod to Pont Spwdwr, where the Kidwelly to Llanelli turnpike road crossed the river. The canal was built and operational by May 1768,Morris (1970) and was later incorporated into the Kidwelly and Llanelly Canal. Although the route across the sands to the dock that he built was often affected by silting, it continued to be used for the export of coal long after the canal had been replaced by a railway. Coasters carried the cargo to Laugharne, Carmarthen, St Clears and Llanstephan, with the last recorded sailing bound for Llanstephan in the early 1920s.Morris (1990) The most notable place of interest is Kidwelly Castle perched above the estuary of the Gwendraeth Fach. The Gwendraeth estuary widens rapidly before joining with the estuaries of the River Tywi and the River T√¢f to form a three branched estuary. To the south of the estuary are the great flat sands of Cefn Sidan and Pembrey, whilst across the estuary on the banks of the River Taf is Laugharne famed for its association with Dylan Thomas. The SV Paul on the Gwendraeth in 1925 The SV Paul is one of the many shipwrecks in the vicinity of the Gwendraeth and the Cefn Sidan sands. The two points enclosing the mouth of the Gwendraeth are Salmon Point Scar (northern side) and Tywyn Point (southern side).

The MND is headed by Minister Yen Teh-fa.  History  ROC Ministry of National Defense former headquarters The MND was originally established as Ministry of War in 1912 at the creation of the Republic of China. It established a military occupation operation center in Taipei, Formosa in November 1945, following the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers Douglas MacArthur's September 2, 1945 General Order No. 1, for the surrender of Japanese troops and auxiliary forces in Formosa and the Pescadores to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. It was changed to the Ministry of National Defense in 1946. Military operation activities in Formosa and the Pescadores were expanded after Japan renounced its title, right, and claim to Formosa and the Pescadores based on the April 28, 1952 Treaty of Peace with Japan. The Law of National Defense and the Organic Law of the ministry were officially promulgated for implementation on 1 March 2002. On 8 December 2014, the ministry moved out from its building from the previous one at Boai Building in Zhongzheng District to the current one in Dazhi area at Zhongshan District, where it houses the Air Force Command Headquarters, Navy Command Headquarters and Hengshan Military Command Center. The completion of the building had been delayed for nearly two decades due to the compound original architecture and the bankruptcy of the project's original contractor. The planning for the new building and relocation had been done since 1997. The official ribbon-cutting ceremony was held on 27 December 2014.  Headquarters ROC Ministry of National Defense headquarters The headquarters of the military was originally in eastern Nanjing near Ming Palace. Today it is located in Dazhi area of Zhongshan District in Taipei. The 8-story main building was constructed at a cost of NT$15.8 billion, spreading over 19.5 hectares of area, which houses office buildings, dormitories and other facilities, such as post office, barbershop, sports center, conference hall and sport center to accommodate its 3,000 military personnel stationed there. It also includes several annex buildings around. The security features of the building include fingerprint and eye scanners that restrict access to certain areas, sensors that can detect vehicles in the unauthorized areas and that may carry explosives and bollards on the compound to block unauthorized vehicles. The compound also has eco-friendly features, such as stone walls, aluminum and low-emission exterior glass panels. The central air conditioning system is provided by ice storage system to reduce peak load electricity demand. The building also has rainwater collecting facilities which can store up to 1,000 tons of water, complete with its waste water treatment and filtering systems. Budget The current annual defense budget for Taiwan is NT$320 billion.

The Narew River flows through town. Wizna is also known for the battle of Wizna which took place in its vicinity during the 1939 Invasion of Poland. Wizna, Gminne Centrum Informacji (official website) At present, farming and food production are the primary sources of income for the residents. The food production by private farms provides favorable conditions for the development of processing industry. Wizna has a remarkably rich history. Already in the 11th century there was a castle there watching over the eastern border of Masovia and the important river crossing over Narew. From the mid 12th century the town was a registered office of the castellany, and from 1379 the capital of the Ziemia wiska (Wizna Land) bordering both Prussia and Lithuania. The Catholic Parish in Wizna was established in 1390. Gmina Wizna - Informacje o regionie  History  Wizna was built on an important trade route from Lithuania to Krak√≥w. Co-ruler of Poland Anna the Jagiellonian used to travel through town and so did Queen Bona Sforza. In the years 1435 - 1870, for over four centuries, Wizna was one of the most important cities of northern Masovia. Its significance began to drop only with the development of the town of ≈Åom≈ºa. In 1860 Wizna had 2,573 residents. In the interwar period the population numbers rose to over 3,300 partly due to influx of new Jewish immigrants from the neighboring states.  The Jews in Wizna  Street in Wizna where the synagogue, Cheder and the Tarbut Hebrew school were located before the Holocaust It is not clear when Jews started to settle in Wizna. Most of the Jewish population lived around the Rynek (Town Square) and the nearby streets. In 1765, 16 Jewish families (about 75 individuals) lived in Wizna. In 1857, there were 492 Jews out of a total population of 1861; in 1921, they numbered 714 out of 2670. Jews were mostly small merchants, craftsman and service providers. In the small village of Witkowo, on the Narew River adjacent to the north side of Wizna, a few Jewish families were farmers and fishermen. These included the Gostkowski family, which operated a ferry on the Narew River for over 100 years prior to the construction of the bridge on the road between ≈Åom≈ºa and Bialystok. The gangster-turned-author Urke Nachalnik was born in Wizna to the wealthy and respected Farberowicz family, who were grain merchants and operated a flour mill. Urke Nachalnik‚Äôs books and stories were published in several languages by the Yiddish press in Poland and in the United States during the 1930s, with some of them being turned into stage plays.  Emigration and Zionist activity in Wizna  Members of the Hachalutz youth movement in Wizna - 1925 The Tarbut Hebrew school in Wizna during the 1930s Zionist parties were active in Wizna during the 1920s and 1930s. A Hebrew school called Tarbut was opened, and the Zionist youth movements Hashomer Hatzair and Hachalutz were active among the young Jewish generation. Jews from Wizna emigrated to the US and other countries such as Cuba, Argentina and Australia during the Russian imperial rule in the 19th century and up until the onset of World War II. Groups of members of the Zionist youth movements emigrated to what was to become Israel before World War II and joined groups that founded the Kibutzim: Ramat-Hakovesh, Einat, Yagur, Giveat-Hashlosha, Kfar-Menachem, Ifat, Evron and Gvat. In addition former Wizners settled in Rishon-le-Zion, Tel-Aviv, Haifa, Jerusalem, Kfar-Saba, Kfar-Sirkin, Kiryat-Chaim, Petach-Tikva, Ramat-Gan, Holon, Ganei-Hadar, Ramat-Zvi, Nahariya, Tel-Mond and elsewhere.  World War II  Ruins of one of the Polish defense bunkers, now a memorial site Wizna is known as the Polish Thermopylae. It was a place of the Battle of Wizna (September 7‚Äì10, 1939) during the initial stages of the German Invasion of Poland. The Polish defense force consisted of approximately 700 soldiers and 20 officers armed with 6 pieces of heavy artillery. They held a fortified territory against a vastly larger invading force at great cost of lives, before being annihilated with no known survivors. A. Zawilski: Bitwy polskiego wrze≈õnia, Krak√≥w 2009, s. 209. Also: Kampania Wrze≈õniowa 1939. \\"B√≥j pod WiznƒÖ\\" Heavy German assault on Polish bunkers continued for three days and was successfully repelled until the early morning of September 10. The German engineers with the help of tanks and explosives managed to destroy all but two Polish bunkers. Both of them were located in the centre of G√≥ra Strƒôkowa, and despite having much of the crew wounded or incapacitated and most of the machine guns destroyed continued their resistance till the end. It is said that General Heinz Guderian threatened the Polish commander, Captain W≈Çadys≈Çaw Raginis, that he would shoot the POWs if the remaining force did not surrender. The symbol of Polish will, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Raginis, committed honorable suicide by throwing himself on a grenade. German losses are not known. In his diaries Heinz Guderian noted that 900 German soldiers were killed in action, although that number is probably underrated. It is certain, however, that the Wehrmacht lost at least 10 tanks and several other AFVs in the struggle.

Zahor, \\"Wizna\\", Wojskowy PrzeglƒÖd Techniczny i Logistyczny, nr 3, 1999  Wizna Jews during the Holocaust  On 22 June 1941, during Operation Barbarossa, most of the houses of Wizna's 600 Jews were burned down following an aerial bombardment. Five German soldiers arrived on 24 June 1941, and local Poles killed three Jews on the same day. Jews fled the town, and local Polish collaborators searched for them in the surrounding villages and turned them over to the Germans after beating up the Jews and their Polish helpers. On 26 June, local Poles locked 20 Jews up in a smithy and a German threw in hand grenades, killing them all. Most of the town's Jews returned by early July, and dozens were killed by the Germans. The Polish mayor ordered the expulsion of the Jews, due to the lack of housing, some traveled to ≈Åom≈ºa and some 200-240 traveled to Jedwabne where many perished on 10 July 1941 in the Jedwabne pogrom.

It allows the operating system to send multiple read and write requests to a hard drive. ATA TCQ is not identical in function to the more efficient Native Command Queuing (NCQ) used by SATA drives. SCSI TCQ does not suffer from the same limitations as ATA TCQ. Without TCQ, an operating system was limited to sending one request at a time. To boost performance, the OS had to determine the order of the requests based on its own possibly incorrect perspective of the hard drive activity (otherwise known as I/O scheduling). With TCQ, the drive can make its own decisions about how to order the requests (and in turn relieve the operating system from having to do so). Thus TCQ can improve the overall performance of a hard drive if it is implemented correctly. Overview For increased efficiency the sectors should be serviced in order of proximity to the current head position, not the order received. The queue is constantly receiving new requests, fulfilling and removing existing requests, and re-ordering the queue according to the current pending read/write requests and the changing position of the head. The exact reordering algorithm may depend upon the controller and the drive itself, but the host computer simply makes requests as needed, leaving the controller to handle the details. This queuing mechanism is sometimes referred to as \\"elevator seeking\\", as the image of a modern elevator in a building servicing multiple calls and processing them to minimise travel illustrates the idea well. If the buttons for floors 5, 2, and 4 are pressed in that order with the elevator starting on floor 1, an old elevator would go to the floors in the order requested. A modern elevator processes the requests to stop at floors in the logical order 2, 4, and 5, without unnecessary travel. Non-queueing disk drives service the requests in the order received, like an old elevator; queueing drives service requests in the most efficient order. This may improve performance slightly in a system used by a single user, but may dramatically increase performance in a system with many users making widely varied requests on the disk surface. Comparison of SCSI TCQ, ATA TCQ, and SATA NCQ SCSI TCQ SCSI TCQ was the first popular version of TCQ and is still popular today. It allows tasks to be entered into a queue using one of three different modes: * head of queue * ordered * simple In head of queue mode, unique to SCSI TCQ, a task is pushed into the front of a queue, ahead of all other tasks including other pending head of queue tasks. This mode is not used much because it can cause resource starvation when abused. In ordered mode, a task must execute after all older tasks have completed and before all newer tasks begin to execute (excluding newer head of queue tasks). Simple mode allows tasks to execute in any order that does not violate the constraints on the tasks in the other two modes. After a command in a task is completed, a notification is sent by the device that completed the command to the host bus adapter. Whether or not SCSI TCQ causes massive interrupt overhead depends on the bus being used to connect the SCSI host bus adapter. On Conventional PCI, PCI-X, PCI Express, and other buses that permit it, first party DMA allows for low interrupt overhead. The older ISA bus required a SCSI host adapter to generate an interrupt to cause the CPU to program the third-party DMA engine to perform a transfer, and then required another interrupt to notify the CPU that a task in the queue was finished, causing high CPU overhead. SCSI TCQ Tag Length The SCSI-3 protocol permits 64 bits to be used in the tag field, allowing up to 264 tasks in one task set to be issued before requiring that some of them complete before any more commands be issued. However, different protocols that implement the SCSI protocol might not permit the use of all 64 bits. For example, older parallel SCSI permits 8 bits of tag bits, iSCSI permits up to 32 tag bits, and Fibre Channel permits up to 16 bits of tag with tag reserved. This flexibility allows the designer of a protocol to trade off queuing ability against cost. Networks that can be large, such as iSCSI networks, benefit from more tag bits to deal with the larger number of disks in the network and the larger latencies such large networks generate, while smaller-scale networks, such as parallel SCSI chains, do not have enough disks or latency to need many tag bits and can save money by using a system supporting fewer bits. ATA TCQ ATA TCQ was developed in attempt to bring the same benefits as SCSI to ATA drives. It is available in both Parallel and Serial ATA. This effort was not very successful because the ATA bus started out as a reduced-pin-count ISA bus. The requirement for software compatibility made ATA host bus adapters act like ISA bus devices without first party DMA. When a drive was ready for a transfer, it had to interrupt the CPU, wait for the CPU to ask the disk what command was ready to execute, respond with the command that it was ready to execute, wait for the CPU to program the host bus adapter's third-party DMA engine based on the result of that command, wait for the third party DMA engine to execute the command, and then had to interrupt the CPU again to notify it when the DMA engine finished the task so that the CPU could notify the thread that requested the task that the requested task was finished. Since responding to interrupts uses CPU time, CPU utilization rose quickly when ATA TCQ was enabled. Also, since interrupt service time can be unpredictable, there are times when the disk is ready to transfer data but is unable to do so because it must wait for a CPU to respond to the interrupt so that the CPU knows that it needs to program the third party DMA engine. Therefore, this standard was rarely implemented because it caused high CPU utilization without improving performance enough to make this worthwhile. This standard allows up to 32 outstanding commands per device. SATA NCQ SATA NCQ is a modern standard which drastically reduces the number of required CPU interrupts compared to ATA TCQ. Like ATA TCQ, it allows up to 32 outstanding commands per device, but was designed to take advantage of the ability of SATA host bus adapters that are not emulating parallel ATA behavior to support first party DMA. Instead of interrupting the CPU before the task to force it to program the host bus adapter's DMA engine, the hard drive tells the host bus adapter which command it wants to execute, causing the host bus adapter to program its integrated first-party DMA engine with the parameters that were included in the command that was selected by the hard drive when it was first issued, and then the DMA engine moves the data needed to execute the command. To further reduce the interrupt overhead, the drive can withhold the interrupt with the task completed messages until it gathers many of them to send at once, allowing the operating system to notify many threads simultaneously that their tasks have been completed. If another task completes after such an interrupt is sent, the host bus adapter can concatenate the completion messages together if the first set of completion messages has not been sent to the CPU. This allows the hard disk firmware design to trade off disk performance against CPU utilization by determining when to withhold and when to send completion messages.

The Sikhs do not regard this as their \\"holy book\\" but as their perpetual and current \\"guru\\", guide or master. It was called Adi Granth until Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth and final guru in human form, conferred on it the title of the guru in 1708, after which it was called Sri Guru Granth Sahib, or Guru Granth Sahib for short. The Granth has 1430 Ang Sahib (ang meaning limb since the Guru Granth Sahib is not a book but it is the eternal Guru for Sikhs) divided into 39 chapters. All copies are exactly alike. The Sikhs are forbidden from making any changes to the text within this scripture. The Guru Granth Sahib was compiled by Guru Arjan Dev, the fifth guru of the Sikhs. The work of compilation was started in 1601 and finished in 1604. The Granth, called \\"Pothi Sahib\\" by Guru Arjan, was installed at Harmandir Sahib (House of God) with much celebration.

Lalwani of Bharat Jivan Publications. He used his entire personal savings and produced 500 copies. Lalwani later took out loans to make a reprint in 1963. The knowledge that enshrines and illuminates Guru Granth Sahib does not recommend translation; instead a direct learning connection with Guru Granth Sahib is only advised. This recommendation reduces learner's bias through secondary translations and middle channels that could mislead a learners' journey.  Dasam Granth  This is regarded as the second holiest book of the Sikhs and is called the Dasam Granth ‚Äì the book of the tenth guru. The Granth was compiled three years after the guru's death and it was Mata Sundri, the widow of the guru, who asked Bhai Mani Singh, a contemporary of the guru, to collect all the hymns composed by the guru and prepare a Granth of the Guru. It was completed in 1711.

A steamboat passed daily on the way to or from Limerick. An application had also been made to the Board of Public Works to improve the Quay near Kildysart, from which pigs, corn, butter and agricultural produce were sent to Limerick in boats; and building material, groceries and other essentials were brought back in return. Today Kildysart has two minimarkets, hardware shops, a mobile bank, pharmacist, clinic, veterinary clinic, credit union, garage, community centre, four pubs and the Quay Marina. It has the parish church, St Michael's and St John Bosco Community College.St John Bosco Community College website; accessed 26 March 2015. Kildysart is known for its fishing, both in the estuary and in the local lakes. Gortglass, Clonshnacta and Effernan, close to the village, are trout fishing lakes only. Only members of the local angling club are allowed to fish in them. Visitors can charter a boat for fishing in the Shannon Estuary or for trips to the islands. The estuary holds fish such as conger, skate, dogfish, pollock, flounder, tope and Thorn Back Ray, all of which can also be caught off Cahercon Pier, which is open to the public and is about from Kildysart.

(2001). Babell [Babel], William. Grove Music Online. Retrieved 9 September 2019 \\\\- 23 September 1723) was an English musician, composer and prolific arranger of vocal music for harpsichord. Life He received his musical training from his father, Charles Babel, a bassoonist in the Drury Lane orchestra, Johann Christoph Pepusch and possibly George Frideric Handel. He played violin in the private band of George I and appeared as a harpsichordist from 1711, often appearing with William Corbett, James Paisible and later Matthew Dubourg. He was associated with Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre. From November 1718 until his death, he was organist at All Hallows, Bread Street, and was succeeded by John Stanley. He wrote numerous keyboard arrangements of arias from popular operas of his time. These were published in France, the Netherlands and Germany as well as in England, and formed the basis of his musical reputation. His style was strongly influenced by his close acquaintance with Handel. Johann Mattheson thought he surpassed Handel as an organ virtuoso, but music historian Charles Burney criticised his manner of playing arrangements, charging that he: Despite Burney's criticism, fellow music historian Sir John Hawkins thought they 'succeeded so well ... as to make from it a book of lessons which few could play but himself, and which has long been deservedly celebrated.' Babell's transcription of arias from Handel's opera Rinaldo includes 'Vo' far guerra', which Handel intended as a showpiece for his harpsichord playing and is quite remarkable in its virtuosity; Babell's transcription was made from his memory of how Handel improvised in performances.Peter Holman: Did Handel invent the English keyboard concerto? - contains information relating to the Babell Handel transcriptions In 1894, Friedrich Chrysander published Babell's arrangement of 'Vo' far guerra' in the H√§ndel-Gesellschaft volume 48. Babell also wrote original sonatas for violin or oboe and continuo, concertos and other miscellaneous works, most notably an Ode for St. Cecelia's day now lost. His slow movements are thought to show valuable insight into early 18th-century practices of ornamentation and extemporization. His early death was attributed to 'intemperate habits'. He died in Canonbury, Islington and was buried in All Hallows Church, Bread Street.

It operates on a unique system Tippmann calls 'Propane Enhanced Performance'. The name 'C-3' may refer to the chemical formula of propane, C3H8.  Operation  While traditional Paintball markers rely upon the expansion of an inert compressed gas (namely or air) for Paintball propulsion, the C-3 utilises the energy released in propane combustion. This is a simplified explanation of the C-3's firing system: The C-3 operates on a closed bolt system. As the pump is pulled back by the shooter, the bolt moves back to allow one paintball to fall into the breech. As the shooter returns the pump to the forward position, completing the pumpstroke, propane is drawn into the combustion chamber. The bolt also moves forward, sealing the breech, and bringing the paintball into the firing position. After the pump stroke, the shooter pulls the trigger, causing a spark and igniting the propane. The resulting expansion of gases forces a piston forward, which in turn compresses air behind the ball, propelling the paintball forward.  Advantages of Propane  Performance - Since combustion releases a great deal of energy compared to expansion, the C-3 is able to get up to 50,000 shots from one 16oz tank of propane, over 60 times the amount from a comparable or compressed air tank. Safety - The fuel is a standard 16oz propane tank, which is stored at about , a much lower and safer pressure than the for or for compressed air. Price - Disposable 16oz propane tanks are readily available at discount, grocery, and hardware stores for around $3.00 and deliver approximately 50,000 shots - a single disposable tank may well outlast the marker. In contrast, reusable tanks cost $5 ‚Äì $25 and compressed air tanks $35 ‚Äì $200, delivering 300 to 1200 shots per refill. Simplicity - Due to it being just that, a propane canister, one can make a \\"remote line\\" using a standard propane hose. Consistency - Propane is more consistent than , as the amount of energy released is independent of ambient temperature.  Disadvantages Of Propane  Heat - A large amount of waste heat is produced. This is the main problem with creating a self-loading combustion powered paintball marker.  Further developments  describes a semi-automatic propane-powered Paintball marker. Operation is similar to that of a reversed C-3 mechanism, with the pump being replaced with a return spring and heavy piston. Pressure produced from the ignited propane pushes the piston forward, which opens a poppet valve and releases exhaust gases into the barrel. The piston continues forward under its own momentum, bounces off the spring and returns to its starting position. It is unlikely that the self- loading version described in the patent will be produced, due to excess heat production.

In 2006 I≈Ç≈ºa had approximately 5,165 inhabitants. The town belongs to the historical region of Lesser Poland, and from its foundation until 1795, it was part of Lesser Poland‚Äôs Sandomierz Voivodeship. I≈Ç≈ºa lies in Malopolska Upland, on the I≈Ç≈ºanka river, south of Radom, and is situated along National Road Nr. 9, which is part of European route E371. I≈Ç≈ºa is the northern terminus of the Starachowice Narrow Gauge Line (Starachowicka Kolej WƒÖskotorowa), a 20-kilometre () line built in the early 1950s, which now is open for tourists in the summer. History The history of the town dates back to the early Middle Ages, when it was a Western Slavic gord. Since the 12th century, until 1789, I≈Ç≈ºa belonged to the Catholic Bishops of Krak√≥w. The settlement was twice destroyed by the Mongols (1241, 1260) during the first and second Mongol invasion of Poland. In around 1294 it received Magdeburg rights town charter. In 1340, a stone castle was built here by Bishop Jan Grot, which was expanded in the 15th and 16th centuries. In the 16th century, I≈Ç≈ºa became famous for its potters and other artisans or craftsmen. The town prospered, together with whole Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was conveniently located on a merchant route from the heartland of Poland to the Vistula ports at Solec nad Wis≈ÇƒÖ, Zawichost, and Sandomierz. In 1576, a town hall was built at the main market square, I≈Ç≈ºa had a defensive wall, and several Polish kings visited the castle. The decline of I≈Ç≈ºa was brought by the Deluge (1655‚Äì1660), when Swedish and Transylvanian armies completely destroyed the town and the castle. View of I≈Ç≈ºa in 1655, by Erik Dahlberg On July 17, 1789 I≈Ç≈ºa ceased to be the property of the Bishops of Krak√≥w, and became a state-owned town. Following the Third Partition of Poland, I≈Ç≈ºa briefly belonged to the Austrian Empire (1795‚Äì1807), afterwards it was part of the short-lived Polish Duchy of Warsaw, and since 1815, it was part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland. The town suffered in the November Uprising (1831), and in 1850, a Jewish gmina was opened here. By 1857, Jews made up 26% of I≈Ç≈ºa's total population. On January 17, 1864, during the January Uprising, a battle between Polish rebels and Russians took place here. In 1867, as a punishment for the uprising, I≈Ç≈ºa lost its town charter and privileges and became a village. In 1870, a synagogue was built, and by 1897, 40% of the population was Jewish. The village was once again destroyed in World War I (1915), and in 1918, the capital of the I≈Ç≈ºa County (created 1866) was moved to Starachowice. In 1921, already in Kielce Voivodeship of the Second Polish Republic, I≈Ç≈ºa regained its town charter. Throughout Invasion of Poland, the Battle of I≈Ç≈ºa (also called Battle of Radom) took place here on September 8‚Äì9 1939, in which Polish Prusy Army was defeated by the Wehrmacht. During the subsequent German occupation, Poles were subject to mass arrests, tortures, massacres and deportations. In March 1940, Germans carried out mass arrests of Poles, who were then either murdered in the village of G√≥ry Wysokie or deported to Nazi concentration camps, and in June 1940, they carried out another wave of arrests of Poles, who were then imprisoned and tortured in Skar≈ºysko-Kamienna, and afterwards murdered in the Brzask forest near Skar≈ºysko-Kamienna.Maria Wardzy≈Ñska, By≈Ç rok 1939. Operacja niemieckiej policji bezpiecze≈Ñstwa w Polsce. Intelligenzaktion, IPN, Warszawa, 2009, p. 251-252, 268 (in Polish) All Poles were a target of German brutality, and Polish Jews were a special target, being nearly wiped out completely. In I≈Ç≈ºa in December 1941, Germans established a Jewish ghetto, whose 2000 residents were murdered at Treblinka extermination camp in October 1942. Polish police assisted in rounding them up for the deportation and searching the ghetto for those in hiding. The number of survivors is unknown. I≈Ç≈ºa was an important center of Polish resistance, with a unit of the Home Army (AK), and local headquarters of Bataliony Ch≈Çopskie. Furthermore, the Communist partisan force Armia Ludowa (AL) was active in the region; on May 16‚Äì17 1944 its units took control of the town and on January 16, 1945 the Red Army entered I≈Ç≈ºa. Former hospital from 1754, now a museum Under the Polish People's Republic I≈Ç≈ºa remained a small town, without an industry and located close to the quickly growing industrial center at Starachowice. Since the 14th century I≈Ç≈ºa established a potter's guild and has been famous for its pottery. Particularly popular were figurines of birds, animals and people, based on keen observations of nature. Entire families participated in the industry each taking their own part in the production. In the 17th and 18th century great developments occurred when caravans of pottery were transported to Krak√≥w and other Polish cities, from where barges would transport the ceramics on the Vistula River to Gda≈Ñsk, spreading the fame of the artists work. During the 19th century, Stanis≈Çaw Kosiarski began his long tradition of production, until his death at the hands of the Nazis in 1939. The tradition was passed on to his students and daughter who continued to produce excellent ornamental pottery and build schools for young artists who could contribute to the art of Poland. I≈Ç≈ºa now belongs to Mazovian Voivodeship, even though it had never been part of the historical Mazovia.

History  Begun as a two-story, 14-room facility on Wilson Lane in 1926, B-CC High School opened at its current location on East-West Highway in 1935 at 44,995 ft¬≤ in a building designed by Howard Wright Cutler. New buildings or additions to existing buildings were constructed over the years: * 1936 - 36,515 ft¬≤ added * 1950 - 49,616 ft¬≤ added * 1952 - 22,396 ft¬≤ added * 1959 - 32,408 ft¬≤ added * 1966 - 29,023 ft¬≤ added * 1970 - 20,295 ft¬≤ added * 1975 - 8,378 ft¬≤ added * 1976 - 9,616 ft¬≤ added These additions made the total school area 253,242 ft¬≤. In the summer of 1994, parents, teachers, administrators, business people and other supporters of B-CC High School formed the Community Coalition for Bethesda- Chevy Chase High School. Its charge was to re-engineer and refocus the high school in an increasingly urbanized and cosmopolitan area. CC-B-CC representatives were encouraged to think broadly and innovatively to create programs that would lead B-CC High School and Montgomery County Public Schools into the next century. Because of this effort, in February 2002, B-CC High School re-opened its doors after a two-and-a-half year, multimillion-dollar, comprehensive modernization that, among other things, combined the historic 1935 and 1936 structures into one building. It had a addition, of renovations of the original 1935, 1936 and part of the 1950 buildings, and of demolitions of most of the 1950 building, 1952, 1959, 1966, 1970, 1975, and 1976 buildings.

Office management is thus a part of the overall administration of business and since the elements of management are forecasting and planning, organising, command, control and coordination, the office is a part of the total management function. Office management is the technique of planning, organizing, coordinating and controlling office activities with a view to achieve business objectives and is concerned with efficient and effective performance of the office work. The success of a business depends upon the efficiency of its office. The volume of paper work in offices has increased manifold in these days due to industrialization, population explosion, government control and application of various tax and labour laws to any business enterprise. Efficiency and effectiveness which are key words in management are achieved only through proper planning and control of activities, reduction of office costs and coordination of all activities of business. ‚ÄúOffice management can be defined as a task of planning, coordination, motivating the efforts of others towards the specific objectives in the office.‚Äù ‚ÄúOffice management, as a function, is that branch of the art and science of management which is concerned with efficient performance of office work whenever and wherever that work is to be done.‚Äù ‚Äî William If. Leffingwell and Edwin M. Rot. ‚ÄúOffice management is manipulation and control of men, methods, machine and material to achieve the best possible results- results of highest possible quality with the expenditure of least possible effect and expense, in the shortest practicable time, and in a manner acceptable to the top management.‚Äù‚Äî Harry H. Wylie. This definition stresses the utilization of resources of business like material, methods etc. to achieve the objectives and results in a best and cheapest way and in a minimum possible time. ‚ÄúOffice management is the art of guiding the personnel of the office in the use of means appropriate to its environment in order to achieve its specified purpose.‚Äù‚Äî Mills and Standinhford. According to this definition, a proper understanding of the objective purpose is necessary so that all efforts and activities are directed in its achievement Environment where office work is to be performed is provided by management after proper planning. Environment means surroundings where employees of an enterprise operate. It includes physical factors like location, layout, lighting temperature, ventilation, cleanliness etc. Various business laws, customs practices etc. must also be made known to employees. In this definition, author has treated office management as an art of guiding and directing personal or employees in the organization in the use of various means such as machines equipment, office forms, manual, methods etc. The definition stresses the development of persons in the office and not direction of things. Office management must understand the behaviour and needs of his employee so as to motivate him to work by influencing him and by providing incentives so that objective of the organization is achieved.

Powell retired in 2016 after 32 years as the head coach with a career record of 532-126-3, four state championships, and four state duals championships. He coached 19 individual state champions, third most of any coach in Pennsylvania history. His eight combined state titles are the most of any coach in Pennsylvania history. Easton is coached by Jamarr Billman, a two-time state champion for the Red Rovers and a three-time NCAA All-American at Penn State and Lock Haven. Billman will debut in the 2016‚Äì2017 season. Billman has been an assistant coach at Cornell University, Easton, and Wilson High School. Billman is also the first African-American head coach in Easton history in any boys sport. Since the PIAA began crowning a team champion at the state tournament 1976, Easton has won six state championships (1981, 1983, 1996, 1997, 2001, 2002) and finished in the top five eighteen times. Pennsylvania added a State Dual tournament in 1999, which Easton won four years in a row from 2001 to 2004. Easton has been to the State Dual Finals eight times, a Pennsylvania record, and their four championships are tied for the most in the state.

With the long-lasting legal issues about the cyanidation patents, MacArthur turned to other businesses. First, he investigated vanadium extraction from ore containing significant amounts of radium. From this enterprise he turned to the production of radium. He founded the Radium Works in Halton in 1911.

Shawn-Douglas Brady has been played by Jason Cook (1999‚Äì2006, 2015) and Brandon Beemer (2006‚Äì08, 2016‚Äì). Belle Black has been played by Kirsten Storms (1999‚Äì2004), Charity Rahmer (2004) and Martha Madison (2004‚Äì08, 2015‚Äì). Along with Lucas and Sami, the popular couple has been lauded by critics and fans as one of the soap's next supercouples. They often referred to as the portmanteau \\"Shelle\\" (for Shawn and Belle) by fans on internet message boards and in magazines. Shawn and Belle have a daughter named, Claire, who was born on September 27, 2005.  Storyline  As the children of two of Salem's supercouples, high school sweethearts Shawn-Douglas Brady (the son of Bo Brady and Hope Williams) and Belle Black (the daughter of John Black and Marlena Evans) found love at a young age. The long time friends experienced a typical high school relationship, with romantic dates and school dances, and quickly fell in love. Unfortunately, the young couple was separated when Shawn claimed to have fathered classmate Jan Spears' baby, actually conceived by a rape while on a school trip to Puerto Rico. Belle was devastated and broke up with Shawn. Back in Salem, Belle and Jan had an argument at Shawn's house and Jan later fell down a flight of stairs and miscarried. Jan blamed Belle for the baby's death, and Shawn believed Jan's claim that the miscarriage was caused by the argument. Belle was hurt that Shawn thought she was capable of something so horrible. After Shawn and Belle's friends were able to prove that Jan's miscarriage was caused by an accident that occurred after Belle had left the house, Shawn begged Belle come back to him, but she refused. After some help from their friends, Shawn and Belle finally reunited and headed off to Salem University. While at school, Shawn and Belle were tempted to have sex but eventually decided to wait until marriage. Shortly after, Belle left Salem for a short time to take care of some business for her father, John Black's, company in Italy when the Salem Stalker began committing numerous murders in town. Belle's mother, Marlena Evans, was a suspect and when Belle returned to Salem, she covered for some of Marlena's suspicious behavior. This led to the murder of Shawn's beloved great-grandmother, Alice Horton. Shawn couldn't forgive Belle for covering for her mother and left town (it was later discovered that Marlena and all of the \\"victims\\" of the Salem Stalker were alive and taken captive by Andre DiMera). Belle was devastated, especially when Jan Spears returned and told Belle that Shawn had joined the merchant marines. Unbeknownst to Belle, Jan had taken Shawn captive hoping to have him for herself. As a result, Belle turned to friend, Philip Kiriakis, who secretly had a crush on her. While trapped, Shawn was subjected to Jan's brainwashing by telling him that Belle had moved on with Philip and showing him video of the friends spending time together. Shawn refused to believe her. When Shawn finally escaped from Jan's clutches, he had a motorcycle accident and lost part of his memory. He had no recollection of Jan's deception, he actually believed her to be his girlfriend, but he remembered the videos of Belle and Philip and believed that Belle had moved on. When Shawn returned to Salem with Jan, Belle hoped that they could reconcile, but saw he was under Jan's spell. Belle was hurt by his actions and turned to Philip for comfort. Philip confessed his feelings and the two decided to marry. Despite Jan's manipulations, Shawn couldn't forget Belle. During a blizzard, Belle and Shawn found refuge in a barn. Cold and afraid, the two made love, though neither remembered due to hypothermia. Belle still planned to marry Philip and a hurt Shawn crashed his motorcycle through the church window at the wedding. His attempt to stop the wedding failed and Belle and Philip were married. Once Philip, a Marine, was sent to the war in Iraq, Shawn and Belle realized they still loved each other and planned to tell Philip the truth. However, in the war, Philip lost part of his leg and Belle, unable to cause her husband any more distress, decided to remain married to him. Shawn was eventually able to convince her that they should tell Philip about their relationship until Belle learned she was pregnant. She assumed Philip to be the father since neither she nor Shawn had any recollection of the time they made love in the barn. Belle decided to stay with Philip for the sake of the baby and Shawn moved on to a relationship with friend, Mimi Lockhart. After Shawn and Belle's baby, Claire, was born, Belle suffered from postpartum depression and couldn't understand why she was so unhappy. Her depression worsened as Shawn's relationship with Mimi became serious feeling as though she would lose him forever. Things became worse for the young mother when it was discovered that baby Claire needed a liver transplant to live. Claire finally received the transplant from Shawn's little brother, Zack Brady, when he was hit by a car and died. It was then that Shawn's girlfriend, Mimi, and her mother, Bonnie Lockhart, realized that Shawn was Claire's biological father, not Philip. On her mother's advice, a guilt-ridden Mimi decided to keep the truth from Shawn for fear of losing him to Belle. After Claire's successful transplant, Shawn and Belle both had a vision of little Zack telling them that they belonged together. Belle finally realized she was, and always had been, in love with Shawn and wanted to be with him. However, Shawn was tired of chasing Belle and asked Mimi to marry him and the couple made it down the aisle. Belle realized she had lost Shawn and decided to focus on her life with Philip and Claire. Since Mimi was unable to conceive because of a previous abortion, the couple decided to try in vitro fertilization with a surrogate. Philip and Belle decided have the same procedure, with Belle carrying her own child, and both couples even had the procedure at the same time. However, unbeknownst to either couple, the sperm samples were switched by a gloved hand which caused Belle's egg to be fertilized by Shawn's sperm and Mimi's egg by Philip's sperm. Outraged, Philip declared that the only sane and logical thing to do would be to abort both embryonic cells. Mimi agreed believing that Belle and Shawn's child would bring the soulmates together again, but Belle and Shawn were determined to keep the baby. Shawn and Belle (as portrayed by Jason Cook and Kirsten Storms) When Shawn's half-sister and troubled teen, Chelsea Benson, was serving her community service (sentenced for causing the accident that killed her brother Zack) at University Hospital, she discovered that Shawn was Claire's father. Determined to turn her life around, Chelsea decided to tell the truth for once. However, because of her strained relationship with Shawn, she knew her brother wouldn't believe her, so she purposely left Claire's hospital file in Shawn's cubicle when he was admitted for alcohol poisoning. Shawn discovered the file but thought it was a mistake or forged. Mimi was relieved to see that both Belle and Philip agreed that it couldn't be true. An angry Philip looked into the matter to find out who would do such a thing. They soon found out that it was Chelsea. Since Chelsea was arrested for putting Claire's file in Shawn's cubicle, they had to run a DNA test on Shawn, to make sure that the file was inaccurate. Mimi and Bonnie tried to change the lab results so that Shawn would never know, but were unable to complete the job and the results came back positive that Shawn was Claire's biological father. Philip refused to believe that this could be true, so he said he was going to find out himself but took off with Claire. A frantic Belle ran to the police station for help finding her husband and daughter. Shawn found Philip with Claire at the hospital. The lab tech confirmed that Claire was Shawn's. When the police arrived, they convinced an irate Philip to give them Claire and Philip was arrested for disorderly conduct. Then the police gave Claire to Shawn. Belle was given a scare when she began to have abdominal pains. She and Philip rushed to the hospital where the couple learned that Belle could lose the baby. Meanwhile, Shawn overheard Mimi and Bonnie having a conversation about lying to Shawn about Claire for months. Shawn confronted his wife and mother-in-law and demanded to know how they could keep him away from Claire for the first year of her life. Mimi tried to explain, but Shawn told her their marriage was over. After he left Mimi, Shawn met a girl named Willow who he told his troubles and admitted he was still in love with Belle. When Shawn arrived at the hospital, he was afraid Belle would lose their baby. Equally worried, Belle insisted that she not receive medication that may harm the baby while Philip insisted that she must first protect her life. Belle asked Philip, as next of kin, not to sign the consent form that would hurt the baby. Philip promised he wouldn't, but when the doctors told him that if they didn't remove the baby, Belle would die, Philip ultimately signed the consent form. When Belle awoke and Philip told her what he had done, she became hysterical with anger and grief and Philip left Shawn with Belle to grieve for their baby. Shawn told Belle that it was the right decision as it was the only way to save her life. Philip returned after Belle apologized to him. Shawn and Belle (as portrayed by Jason Cook and Martha Madison) When Carrie Brady visited Belle in the hospital, the two had a long talk about love and life. Carrie advised Belle that if she really loved Shawn, then she should be with him, as it was unfair to Philip. Meanwhile, Shawn arrived at the hospital with gifts for Belle and Claire and misinterpreted a conversation he overheard between Belle and Carrie. Since he only heard part of the conversation, he misunderstood and thought Belle wanted nothing to do with him. Devastated, he left without talking to Belle. Shawn then learned that Victor knew he was Claire's father and ran a race car through a wall in the Kiriakis mansion. Bo and Hope talked to their son and tried to get him to calm down. Hope knew her son was in love with Belle and advised him to go see her. While Belle was still in the hospital recovering from the loss of her baby, her missing mother returned with her father to Salem. She comes to visit Belle in the hospital along with John. They decided they wanted Belle to come stay at the Penthouse with them while she was recovering. In the hospital and once at the penthouse Marlena and Belle had a long heart-to-heart and Belle made a decision regarding her marriage to Philip. She called her husband and asked him to bring Claire to the penthouse where the couple decided to end their marriage. Philip gathered his things and left town. Shawn arrived at the penthouse and he and Belle had a long overdue talk. Just as the destined pair were making progress, Belle was trying to explain why she ended her marriage with Philip by telling Shawn about her conversation with Carrie. Shawn, remembering what he thought he heard, became hurt and angry and left Belle stunned and confused. Shawn continued to see Willow and even took her out on his father's boat. The two were caught in a storm and had to be rescued by the Coast Guard. Meanwhile, Hope invited Belle to dinner and convinced her to give her relationship with Shawn a chance. Belle agreed and when the two discovered that Shawn was in danger, they hurried to check on him. Belle was shocked to see Shawn and Willow kissing and when she confronted Shawn, he told her that the kiss didn't mean anything. Belle was upset at how Shawn had no feelings for this girl, he was just using her to get away from his own problems, and told him that he was no longer the Shawn she once loved. Shawn was hurt and Belle left. Before Belle would allow Shawn to be a part of Claire's life, she demanded that he get his act together. Shawn obliged and went out to find a job and get a decent place to live so that he could spend time with his daughter. Shawn took a job with the dirty EJ Wells and began to deliver notes back and forth between EJ and Patrick Lockhart. Shawn got paid a huge amount of money and he bought himself an apartment with Willow. Shawn tried to hide his living arrangements with Willow from Belle, knowing that Belle won't let Willow, a hooker, anywhere near Claire. Belle ultimately found out the truth about Willow and that Shawn was working for EJ. Willow became furious with Shawn for kicking her out and vowed revenge. Before leaving, she set his apartment on fire and Shawn was forced out of the building. Shawn, Belle, and Claire moved into Bo and Hope's house for a short time to become a family, even though Shawn and Belle weren't romantically involved. Shawn quit his dirty job with EJ and tried to get his life together for the sake of Claire and Belle. Max and Mimi discovered that Philip had gone back into the Marines, and was severely injured. Victor set up Belle in a diner so that she would answer the phone leaving Claire unattended. While she was on the phone with Victor, a woman kidnapped Claire. She was returned to Belle a few hours later unharmed. Meanwhile, Max and Mimi continued to try to track down Philip, but Victor had them locked up in a church basement before they got too close. A bandaged man was seen in a secret room in the Kiriakis Mansion. Victor would secretly bring Claire to the man for visits. The man turned out to be a wounded Philip. Victor had Philip flown to Canada in order to receive a face transplant. Just when Shawn, Belle, and Claire started to bond as a family, they started to be investigated by a woman named Beverly Healy who worked for Child Protective Services, and who was believed to work for Victor and Philip. Beverly concluded that Shawn and Belle were unfit parents, and had a court order which allowed her to take Claire away from them. Shawn and Belle were horrified when they learned that Philip was fighting for custody of Claire. At the closed hearing, Victor represented Philip, as it was believed that he was unable to appear due to injuries. Shawn and Belle pleaded their case, as Victor did his. Shawn was shocked when Willow testified against him, saying that Shawn never cared about Claire or anyone else, just about his cars and money. Marlena, Bo, Hope, Max, and Mimi were shocked when a bandaged Philip was wheeled into the courtroom in a wheelchair. Shawn and Belle were also shocked, and when Philip revealed his face, Belle yelled, \\"That is NOT Philip.\\" Philip's injuries are explained and Victor provides proof that it is his son. The judge awards temporary custody to Philip, and tells Shawn and Belle that they need to go to counseling sessions. After everyone learns that Willow was paid $10,000 to lie on the stand, and everyone knowing that the judge was probably paid off by Victor as well, Shawn and Belle conclude that they need kidnap Claire and go on the run. After Steve helps them over the Canada‚ÄìUS border, Shawn, Belle, and Claire take refuge in a room in an alley. They plan to board a ship that will take them to Australia, but they need the money first. Shawn calls home to his father Bo, and Bo sends Chelsea and Nick to bring them the money that they need. Philip and Willow however, follow Nick and Chelsea, but Nick plants a knife in Philip's suitcase which gets him arrested. In July 2007, Shawn proposed to Belle, and the pair marries in November 2007. On New Year's Eve 2008, Belle confesses to having sex with Philip before their wedding, causing them to separate. When Shawn contemplated divorce, Claire was once again kidnapped, and with the help of Philip and Chloe, Belle and Shawn find their daughter in Ireland. On the way home from Ireland, Belle and Shawn's plane crashes, and they were saved by her father John Black, and Steve Johnson. Thankful to be alive and Claire being safe they were able to work out their differences and decided to give their marriage another chance. The couple left town to sail around the world on the Fancy Face IV, taking Claire with them on March 2008. In October 2015, Shawn-Douglas returns to Salem to attend his mother's wedding to Aiden Jennings. Belle returns with Claire in November 2015, following the death of Bo, and Belle reveals that during their time in Maine she had an affair and that she and Shawn-Douglas were divorcing.

Written by Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg, and directed by Ken Whittingham, the episode first aired in the United States on March 30, 2006 on NBC. The episode guest stars Nancy Carell as Carol Stills. The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) is disappointed when only Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) celebrates his birthday. Meanwhile, Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) spends the day waiting to find out if he has skin cancer. The ice skating scenes were shot in an actual rink; Carell's talent at hockey was the reason the writers decided to set the episode there. Fischer had also learned to skate in preparation for the movie Blades of Glory, but the writers decided that there was no reason for Pam to be a good skater, so they had Pam lean on Jim. \\"Michael's Birthday\\" was watched by 7.8 million viewers and received mostly positive reviews from critics. Plot Michael Scott (Steve Carell) is excited to be celebrating his birthday, and tries to get the employees excited with him. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) is the only one to join in; the rest of the employees are more concerned about Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner), who is awaiting results from his skin cancer screening. Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) sneak out to buy gifts for Kevin to cheer him up. After goofing around at the store, Jim and Pam return to the office. When Michael finds out about Kevin's predicament, he gives Kevin his condolences, but is bitter that his birthday fun is ruined. Dwight and Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) are less subtle than they think they are being when discussing their secret relationship within earshot of Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak). In an attempt to make Kevin feel better and celebrate his birthday, Michael takes the employees out ice skating. At the rink, he runs into his real estate agent Carol Stills (Nancy Carell) and her children. He entertains them, which makes Carol smile. Kevin gets the word that his screening results are negative, to the relief of everyone except Michael, who believes that negative means he has cancer, and reacts for the first time with genuine concern and compassion for Kevin. Gifts are passed out to Kevin and Michael. Pam says in an interview that Michael's birthday \\"was a good day\\", and appears to struggle to come up with an explanation for why it was good. The documentary crew suggestively intercuts this with footage of her shopping with Jim. Production This episode was the second episode of the series directed by Ken Whittingham. Whittingham had previously directed the first season episode \\"Health Care\\". \\"Michael's Birthday\\" was written by Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg. The two had previously written the episodes \\"The Fight\\" and \\"The Secret\\". The ice skating scenes were shot in an actual rink. According to Jenna Fischer, Steve Carell used to play hockey, and the writers had been looking for a reason to use Carell's ice skating skills in an episode. Fischer had also learned to skate in preparation for the movie Blades of Glory, but the writers decided that there was no reason for Pam to be a good skater, so they had Pam lean on Jim.

At the rink, Michael tells Pam to be wary of breast cancer. This is the third joke that Stupnitsky and Eisenberg had aimed at Pam's breasts, after one each in \\"The Fight\\" and \\"The Secret\\". Fischer later jokingly said that \\"my breasts play a central role in one of tonight's scenes.\\" Fischer also noted that, due to the slight emphasis her breasts were receiving, many fans on the internet were arguing that Fischer had had breast implants. Fischer denied the rumors, but stated that she was \\"flattered\\". The Season Two DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include Jim describing Michael's typical birthday, Dwight explaining his duties on Michael's birthday, Michael being upset when Ryan does not get him a present, Michael telling several variations of his worst birthday, and Michael making Ryan research skin cancer. Cultural references The cold opening features Michael trying to get various members of the office involved in a pyramid scheme, which is a non- sustainable business model that involves promising participants payment or services, primarily for enrolling other people into the scheme, rather than supplying any real investment or sale of products or services to the public. The scheme is generally considered one of various internet scams. Michael notes that he shares his birthday with Eva Longoria, and that it will be a perfect icebreaker if he ever meets Teri Hatcher. After Michael asks what Dwight is playing on the recorder, Dwight replies that it is \\"For The Longest Time\\", by \\"William Joel\\" (Billy Joel released \\"The Longest Time\\" in 1984). When Kevin mentions he might have skin cancer, Kelly starts discussing a case involving cancer on the popular medical drama Grey's Anatomy. She later says that the saddest funeral she ever saw was the one for Princess Diana. For Michael's birthday, his mother sent him a picture of James Dean. Resignedly, Michael notes that \\"I bet Luke Perry's friends don't treat him like this\\". While at the grocery store, Jim and Pam buy a copy of the American comedy movie American Pie 2. Pam later impersonates Darth Vader, a character from the science fiction movie franchise Star Wars on the store's intercom.

Originally released by Freescale in 2006, the RS08 architecture is a reduced-resource version of the Freescale MC68HCS08 central processing unit (CPU), a member of the 6800 microprocessor family. It has been implemented in several microcontroller devices for embedded systems. Compared to its sibling HC08 and Freescale S08 parts, it has a much-simplified design. The 'R' in its part numbers suggests \\"Reduced\\"; Freescale itself describes the core as \\"ultra-low- end\\". Typical implementations include fewer on-board peripherals and memory resources, have smaller packages (the smallest is the QFN6 package, at 3mm x 3mm x 1mm), and are priced under US $1. Aims of the simplified design include greater efficiency, greater cost-effectiveness for small-memory-size parts, and smaller die size. The RS08 employs a von Neumann architecture with shared program and data bus; executing instructions from within data memory is possible. The device is not binary compatible with the S08 core, though the instruction opcodes and addressing modes are a subset of the S08. This allows an easy transition from the S08 core to the RS08 core for designers and engineers. Short and Tiny addressing modes allow for more efficient access and manipulation of the most commonly used variables and registers. These instructions have single-byte instruction opcodes, reducing the amount of program memory required by their frequent use. Die size is 30% smaller than the S08 core. The RS08 core uses the same bus structure as S08, making memory and peripheral module reuse possible. It offers a Background Debug Mode interface, a single-wire debugging interface that allows interactive control over the processor when installed in a target system.  Devices  Devices (as of July 2010): * MC9RS08KA1: 1 kB of Flash-programmable program memory. * MC9RS08KA2: 2 kB of Flash-programmable program memory. * MC9RS08LE4: 4 kB of Flash-programmable program memory, SCI. * MC9RS08LA8: 8 kB of Flash- programmable program memory, SCI, SPI. * MC9RS08KB12: 12 kB of Flash- programmable program memory, I2C, SCI.  Architectural Features  * The RS08 core does not manage a stack. During subroutine calls, it preserves a return address in a Shadow Program Counter link register. If a subroutine in turn calls another subroutine, it can preserve the return address in a local variable, call subroutines as necessary, and restore the saved address just before returning. * The core's Status register has Carry and Zero flag bits. Overflow and Negative, usually found in other cores, are not present.  Interrupt Handling  Interrupts are not dispatched through interrupt vectors, as with nearly all other Freescale processors. RS08 interrupts can wake the processor from a WAIT or STOP condition (where execution is temporarily halted), but otherwise do not change program flow. In essence, RS08 runs any thread of programming to completion. The effect is vaguely similar to cooperative multitasking in operating systems. Though handling external events is synchronous, no overhead due to context switching is required, and low-power operation is possible. Interrupt arbitration is exclusively software-controlled.

According to Sikh Gurus teachings, it is Haumai that leads to endless cycles of transmigration (rebirth), and makes a person \\"manmukh\\". They state that one must turn away from Haumai, become a \\"gurmukh\\" and follow the path of the Guru to receive God's grace. In Sikhism, the Haumai can only be overcome through meditation on God‚Äôs name (Naam), Simran and Sewa. It is a combination of the words Hau (‡®π‡®â) meaning \\"I\\" and Mai (‡®Æ‡©à) meaning \\"me\\". The opposite of Haumai is humility (or Nimrata), which is considered a virtue in Sikhism. Selfless service called Seva, and complete submission to Waheguru, or God is the Sikh path to liberation. Related concepts The concept of destructive self- centeredness and covetous attachment, similar to Haumai in Sikhism, is important in other Indian religions.

The group was a part of the Orange County music scene. The band members included Charlie Glancy on lead guitar and metal trash can, Craig Brisco on drums, Mitch McNally, and Sean Brown on vocals and guitar.  Group history  Weirdotronix Southern California Punk Gig Diary remembers Tazers in 1982 as \\"a Fullerton bar band, who had recently made the transition from mainstream rock to punk. They were competent musicians, with lots of performing experience, but their approach to punk was rather clich√© and formulaic.\\" The review goes on to say that the group apparently decided on having purple hair, torn clothes and sneering after watching the film Valley Girl. In a later review, Tazers are remembered as \\"well practiced (and well- equipped) musicians, yet there seemed to be something missing from their act. They lacked a powerful stage presence; they were really more new wave than punk, and their original material sounded too much like covers of other bands' songs.\\"  Albums  In 1982, the group released a 7\\" vinyl single called Don't Classify Me!, featuring five tracks with titles like \\"Neo Natal Hospital\\" and \\"Microwave Mother.\\" Two years later, the group put forth their self-titled LP in which newcomer to the band, Dave Brown, played lead guitar.  Popularity/promotion  During their peak of popularity, while drawing crowds of 400 to 500 people at shows, the band was promoted by using airtime on southern Californian radio stations such as, KNAC and KROQ-FM. Most of the band's legitimate and paying shows were Ichabod's in Fullerton with bands like Chequered Past, D.I. and 45 Grave. The band played mostly undocumented backyard and house parties, often being paid only in beer and alcohol. Undoubtedly, their most prestigious gig was a slot opening for the heavy metal comedy group, Spinal Tap. The Tazers song \\"Alcoholic‚Äôs Anthem\\" was featured on the soundtrack to the 1987 film Surf Nazis Must Die, commonly recognized as one of the worst movies of all time. The group disbanded in the late 1980s, with Glancy and Brisco continuing on to play in a new band called D/Railed. Mitch McNally currently plays bass in the group Mama Hagglin.  Recent activity  Following the turn of the century, the Tazers became somewhat of a legend in the Orange County punk scene, and their original records began to routinely sell on eBay for hundreds of dollars. In the early 2000s, Rave Up Records announced that they would be re-releasing Don't Classify Me! on vinyl, with a package including vintage photos and extensive liner notes written by the lead guitarist Charlie Glancy. Around the same time, a CD titled Where Has All the Vinyl Gone?, compiling the bands complete discography of one LP and two EPs was self-released.

It is the setting for W.B.Yeats's The Song of Wandering Aengus. The wood is situated on the shores of Lough Gill, which contains Yeats's Lake Isle of Innisfree, and is popular among tourists and locals for its scenic walks, which are dotted with sculptures. Swans, mallards and gulls congregate at the picnic area, and there is fishing on Lough Gill. The wood is part of the Hazelwood estate, owned by the Wynne family for two hundred years. The walk along forests trails provides views of the lake and Church Island, Cottage Island and Goat Island in a serene setting. The woods are dominated by oaks (Quercus spp.), with rowan (Sorbus aucuparia), willows (Salix spp.), bird cherry (Prunus padus), yew (Taxus baccata), and the rare rock whitebeam (Sorbus rupicola). The shores of the lake are home to the world's northernmost specimens of the rare Mediterranean strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo). This area supports several rare plant species, including yellow bird's-nest (Monotropa hypopitys), lady‚Äôs mantle (Alchemilla glaucescens), ivy broomrape (Orobanche hederae), black bryony (Dioscorea communis), intermediate wintergreen (Pyrola media) and bird's-nest orchid (Neottia nidus-avis).

The direct-to-video sequel to the 1996 Disney film The Hunchback of Notre Dame, the film was produced by Walt Disney Animation Japan, Walt Disney Television Animation and Walt Disney Video Premiere. Critical reception was generally negative. Plot The film is set in 1488, six years after the events of the original film and the death of Judge Claude Frollo. Captain Phoebus serves as Paris' Captain of the Guard under the new Minister of Justice. Phoebus and Esmeralda are now married and have become the parents of a five-year-old son named Zephyr. Quasimodo is now an accepted part of Parisian society; though he still lives in Notre Dame de Paris with his gargoyle friends Victor, Hugo, and Laverne as the cathedral's bell-ringer. A circus troupe led by Sarousch enters town as part of \\"Le Jour d'Amour\\", a day dedicated to the celebration of strong and pure romantic love. Sarousch is secretly a master criminal who plans to steal Notre Dame's most beloved bell, La Fid√®le, the inside of which is decorated with beige-gold and enormous jewels. He sends Madellaine, a peasant girl, to discover the whereabouts of La Fid√®le. Madellaine encounters Quasimodo without seeing his face, and the two of them initially get along quite well. Once Madellaine actually sees his face, she is shocked at his deformed appearance and runs away from him. The gargoyles convince Quasimodo to go to the circus to see her again. At the circus, Sarousch captures the audience's attention by making an elephant disappear, while his associates steal from the audience. He pressures Madellaine to follow Quasimodo and obtain the information he needs for his plans. When Madellaine disagrees with this mission, Sarousch reminds her of her past and of the loyalty she owes him: when she was six years old, Madellaine was an orphaned thief who was caught trying to steal coins from Sarousch. He could have turned her over to the authorities or even Frollo; instead, Sarousch took her under his wing and decided to employ her in his circus. Madellaine reluctantly takes the mission to win Quasimodo's trust. After observing Quasimodo fondly playing with Zephyr around town and letting the boy sleep in his arms, Madellaine realises the hunchback's true nature and ceases to be frightened by his appearance. Quasimodo takes her sight-seeing around Paris. A rain forces them to end their date and return to Notre Dame. Quasimodo takes the opportunity to offer Madellaine a gift, a figurine in her own image which he created himself earlier in the film. A sincerely touched Madellaine kisses him on the forehead and leaves. Quasimodo soon realizes that he has fallen in love with her. Meanwhile, Phoebus is investigating reports about robberies in his city. He suspects that the circus is responsible for the crime spree and confides to his family and friends, but Esmeralda expresses her belief that Phoebus is motivated by his own prejudice. Elsewhere, Sarousch instructs Madellaine to keep Quasimodo preoccupied while the circus steals La Fid√®le. However, Madellaine has come to genuinely care for Quasimodo and protests, so Sarousch threatens to have Quasimodo killed if she refuses. Phoebus eventually questions Sarousch about the robberies, and finds a stolen jewel in his possession. To avoid being arrested, Sarousch claims that Madellaine is a lifelong thief and that he is covering for her crimes. Phoebus seems to believe him. Later, while Quasimodo is out with Madellaine, Sarousch and two of his subordinates sneak into the cathedral. Sarousch causes La Fid√®le to vanish. The gargoyles try to stop the thieves, but end up trapped under another bell; Laverne still sounds the bell and alerts everyone that something is amiss at the Cathedral. Hearing the sound, Quasimodo and Madellaine rush back. When the Archdeacon informs everyone that La Fid√®le has been stolen, Clopin claims that if they do not find the bell, the festival will be ruined. Phoebus realises that Sarousch has played him for a fool. He sends the soldiers all over Paris to find Sarousch. Due to some confusion, Quasimodo realizes that his beloved Madellaine has deceived him (despite her pleas that she did not intend to) and angrily breaks off their relationship. He retreats deeper into the Cathedral, feeling heartbroken and betrayed. Phoebus has his guards arrest Madellaine for her involvement in the theft. The gargoyles soon inform Quasimodo that Zephyr has left to pursue Sarousch. He passes the information on to Esmeralda and Phoebus, who now have personal reasons to locate the master criminal. Madellaine, now a prisoner of Phoebus, informs them that Sarousch has taken the missing bell to the Catacombs of Paris and tries to explain the secrets behind her former master's tricks and illusions. Phoebus decides to search around the catacombs, and brings Madellaine with him. In the Catacombs, the search party encounter Esmeralda's pet goat Djali, who leads them to Sarousch and Zephyr. Sarousch has taken the boy hostage and blackmails Phoebus into opening a gate for him. Madellaine uses her high-wire skills to rescue Zephyr and reunite him with his parents. With no leverage against his pursuers, Sarousch and his group of criminals are arrested, and the missing bell is recovered. The festival can finally take place. Hugo finally wins the heart of Djali, his longtime crush. A number of romantic couples, including Phoebus and Esmeralda, proclaim their love for each other while Quasimodo rings the restored La Fid√®le. The bell falls silent when a released Madellaine joins Quasimodo in the bell tower. The two of them admit their own love for each other and share their first romantic kiss. As the film ends, Zephyr takes over the ringing of La Fid√®le.

Phonetic form is the level of representation wherein expressions, or sentences, are assigned a phonetic representation, which is then pronounced by the speaker. Phonetic form takes surface structure as its input, and outputs an audible (or visual, in the case of sign languages), pronounced sentence.Ouhalla, J: \\"Introducing Transformational Grammar.\\" 2nd Ed., page 68. Arnold Publishers, 1999 This is part of the Y- or T-model of grammar within minimalist grammar, wherein the syntactic structure is constructed and then transferred (called spell-out) to both the Phonetic Form and the Logical Form. Operations in this branch of the model (between spell-out and pronunciation), the syntax-phonology interface, affect the pronunciation of the utterance but not its meaning. Within distributed morphology (DM), this is where morphological structure is constructed, where the hierarchical syntactic structure is transformed into a linearized structure, and syntactic features are replaced with vocabulary items, among other things.Halle, Morris & Alec Marantz. 1993. 'Distributed Morphology and the Pieces of Inflection.' In The View from Building 20, ed. Kenneth Hale and S. Jay Keyser. MIT Press, Cambridge, 111‚Äì176. According to some theories of prosody, the prosodic representation is derived with direct reference to the hierarchical syntactic structure. For example, Selkirk (2011, and others) proposes that prosodic structure is constructed by a process of matching, although imperfectly, prosodic constituents to syntactic constituents.Selkirk, Elisabeth. \\"The Syntax-Phonology Interface.\\" in J. Goldsmith, J. Riggle, and A. Yu, eds., The Handbook of Phonological Theory, 2nd edition. Oxford: Blackwell, 2011.

It starred Ed Begley, Jr. as Andy Raper, Richard Masur as Eddie, and Anne Archer as Patricia. Plot The action of the play goes back and forth between Washington, D.C. and Grenada. In Grenada, Alex is a medical student who has a girlfriend named Linda, also a medical student, who works in a gift shop. The gift shop is owned by Ruby, a native of the island. From the beginning, Alex is shown to be a dishonest person, as he tells Linda that he is paying professors for answers to exams. A CIA agent repeatedly visits the shop and has many witty arguments with Ruby. In Washington, Andy manipulates Tommy and Patricia into helping him use political spin to make public opinion supportive of the Grenada invasion. It is revealed that Alex is Eddie's son, whom Eddie thought was going to Stanford University. Alex is paid by the CIA agent to pretend that he is in danger, and Eddie is therefore forced to drop his opposition to the invasion and participate in a press conference with Alex when he returns to the United States. Meanwhile, during the invasion of Grenada, Ruby is killed when the hotel she is working in is bombed accidentally. Linda and Eddie are both upset with Alex and feel that he has become a different person. Eddie always expresses his misgivings about the invasion when talking to the other Washington characters, but when he meets Linda at the end of the play, when he sees her protesting the invasion, he admits that he has done nothing to stop the war.

Into the Past: The Cinema of Guy Maddin. Toronto: U of Toronto P, 2010. Print. Twilight of the Ice Nymphs was Maddin's second feature film in colour and his first shot in 35 mm, on a budget of $1.5 million.Beard, William. Into the Past: The Cinema of Guy Maddin. Toronto: U of Toronto P, 2010. Print. As seen in Noam Gonick's documentary Waiting for Twilight, Maddin was dissatisfied with the filmmaking process due to creative interference from his producers.  Plot  A newly released prisoner, Peter Glahn, returns home to the land of Mandragora, where the sun never sets. Aboard the ship, Glahn has a romantic encounter with Juliana Kossel, then proceeds to the family ostrich farm, which is run by his sister Amelia. Amelia is in love with Dr. Isaac Solti, a manipulative gentleman scientist/mesmerist. Cain Ball, Amelia's hired hand, quarrels with her about her promise to sell him the ostrich farm. Peter heads into the forest to go hunting and meets the pregnant Zephyr, who despite her fisherman husband falls for Peter. Zephyr prays to a stone statue of the goddess Venus that stands in the forest that Peter will be hers, and gives the statue her wedding ring as a gift. Zephyr meets Peter again and Venus appears to have worked her magic, since the two embrace, although Peter notes that he is in love with Juliana and Zephyr notes her marriage. Dr. Solti has likewise been talking to the statue of Venus, which fell over and crushed his leg, causing its amputation. During a picnic, Amelia and Peter meet Solti and Juliana (revealed to be Solti's companion) causing both Glahns to become quite jealous. Solti has mesmerized Juliana and reveals that he orchestrated her affection for Peter as part of his everyday manipulative sadism. Peter assaults Solti and ineffectively attacks his artificial leg. Amelia, meanwhile, has concluded that Cain Ball is trying to kill her and so hammers a giant nail into his skull, sets him on fire, and stuffs his face with live flies, before entering into a semi-catatonic madness herself. Zephyr reveals that she has murdered her husband by leading him into a pit of snakes. Peter and Juliana reignite their romance briefly, before it sours due to Peter's jealousy. He calls upon the spirits of the forest trees to descend on his tormentors, but they only droop a little. Zephyr attempts to take her ring back from the statue of Venus but it falls over to crush her. Cain, nail in head, hallucinates that the cast has piled into a boat, then dies. Solti leaves Mandragora and Juliana follows. She asks Peter for his dog Aesop as a memento, and he agrees but first kills the dog. Peter retreats with Amelia to a wintry cave.

The creator of the website and leader of the VeryCD company, Huang Yimeng was also listed in a \\"list of Chinese multimillionaires born in 1980s\\" by some Chinese media. Software Two eDonkey network clients, eMule VeryCD Mod and easyMule, are developed by VeryCD company. eMule VeryCD Mod eMule VeryCD Mod developed since 2003 is based on eMule and open- sourced.

Due to the censorship in China, eMule VeryCD Mod has a search word filter to prevent users from searching some political or pornographic words. easyMule easyMule developed since 2007 is now the company's primary client. It removes the category, message, IRC, custom skin and some other features from eMule, adds BHO (Browser Helper Object) plug-in to users' IE browser. The browser built in easyMule can only access VeryCD.com site. easyMule's users can't search via eDonkey servers or Kad network, it is only allowed to search from the links indexed by VeryCD.com. easyMule version 1 is eMule-based and open-sourced. Since v2.0, easyMule has closed its source. VeryCD company's developer claimed that easyMule 2.0 is written from scratch by them. On 1 July 2009, an aMule developer wrote a topic on VeryCD's group, claiming that easyMule is built over code of aMule which is a GPLed eD2k client, and asking for the code. But this was said to be \\"purely irresponsible nonsense\\" and refused by VeryCD's owner Huang Yimeng. Anti-leech The two clients implement eMule Xtreme Mod's Dynamic Leecher Protection (DLP) to ban leecher-mods, but use their own modified source-closed dll library file.

Some Chinese users call eMule \\"Dianlv\\" as well. VeryCD company has tried to register both \\"eMule\\" and \\"Dianlv\\" for trademarks in China, but not approved up to now. However, easyMule (version 1 and 2) was named \\"Dianlv\\" in Chinese by the company. VeryCD.com claims itself to be the official \\"Dianlv\\" site. The name of \\"Dianlv\\" is considered to be another misleading. VeryCD sometimes deletes topics about the real official eMule and non-VeryCD clients on its site.

Teams are seeded using a round-robin tournament and the top four play a mix of a single-elimination and double- elimination tournament to determine the winner. It is identical to a four-team McIntyre System playoff, first used by the Victorian Football League in Australia in 1931, originally called the Page‚ÄìMcIntyre system, after the VFL delegate, the Richmond Football Club's Secretary, Percy \\"Pip\\" Page, who had advocated its use. History The Page playoff system was used at the Australian Rugby League Championship 1954-1972. In Australia, its most notable use today is in netball, having been adopted by Suncorp Super Netball when it began play in 2017. The system has been used since 1990 by the International Softball Federation and its successor, the World Baseball Softball Confederation, for the Women's Softball World Championship and from 1996 to 2008 at the Olympic Games.International Softball Federation.

Beginning with the 2020 season, the League of Legends Championship Series uses a double-elimination format with a Page playoff system being employed for the final rounds of the playoff tournament. A similar format would also be adopted for the League of Legends European Championship that same year. Format The system requires teams to be ranked in some way, as the top two teams have an advantage over the bottom two. This is usually accomplished through a round-robin tournament, which eliminates all but the top four teams. Round-robin A standard round-robin tournament is used, in which all teams play each other once. Because the number of total games increases quadratically with respect to the number of teams, scheduling too many teams will result in an unwieldy number of games, particularly when there are a limited number of playing surfaces (championship curling arenas usually only have four or five sheets). Therefore, the number of teams is usually capped at around a dozen; if this is not possible or desirable, teams may be separated into groups playing separate round-robins and either having the top teams combining for the Page playoff or playing separate ones in each group and having the winners play each other after. Page playoff system The system was invented in Australia in the early 1930s and adopted soon after by the Victorian Football League (now known as the Australian Football League). The top four teams advance to the playoffs, which are played over three rounds with one team being eliminated in each round. The format progresses as follows: *In Game 1, the third- and fourth-placed teams play against each other. The loser is eliminated. *In Game 2, the first- and second-placed teams play against each other. The winner qualifies directly for the final. *In Game 3, the winner of Game 1 plays against the loser of Game 2. The loser is eliminated. *Game 4 (the final) is then played between the winners of Games 2 and 3. This system gives the top two teams a double chance, in that they can lose their first game and still go on to win the title, producing a similar though not identical effect to a double-elimination tournament. This gives the top two teams a significant advantage over the next two, since winning the title from third or fourth place requires winning one more game than winning from first or second, and also requires defeating every other team in the playoffs. Additionally, the higher ranked team in any pairing (which, in the final, is automatically the team which won Game 2) will play as the home team to provide an additional advantage; in the case of curling teams, where teams rarely play national or international tournaments at their home rink, the advantage is that the first-placed team is given the hammer (last rock) in the first end, which is a reasonable advantage between comparably skilled teams. In the 2008 World Women's Curling championship, a fifth match was added to the format: a bronze medal playoff match, which was played between the two teams which did not qualify for the final (the losers of Games 1 and 3). This game is normally scheduled between Games 3 and 4. Previously, the bronze would have automatically been awarded to the team which lost Game 3, so this game provides a chance for the loser of Game 1 to still receive a medal. This was also introduced at the national level at the 2011 Scotties Tournament of Hearts and the 2011 Tim Hortons Brier. The bronze medal game was heavily criticized for being \\"meaningless\\" in part because simply winning a \\"medal\\" does not carry the same sort of prestige it does in the Olympic Games. The bronze medal game was eliminated prior to the 2018 Canadian championship curling season. Names of matches In Australia, Games 1 and 2 are known as Semi-Finals; Game 3 is called the Preliminary Final, and the final is known as the Grand Final. To distinguish between the two Semi- Finals, which are different in nature, the match between 3rd and 4th is known either as the First Semi-Final or the Minor Semi-Final; and the match between 1st and 2nd is known either as the Second Semi-Final or the Major Semi-Final. In Curling, Games 1 and 2 are usually known as the 3-4 game and 1-2 game, respectively (and Game 2 is usually played first, to give the higher-ranked team more rest before Game 3); Game 3 is called the Semi-Final, and the final is known by that name. In India, Game 1 is known as the Eliminator, Games 2 and 3 are called Qualifiers, and the final is known by that name. Examples 1931 Victorian Football League playoffs The first-ever use of the system was in Australia in 1931 after the Victorian Football League adopted it. The regular season ended with Geelong winning the minor premiership, followed by Richmond, Carlton and Collingwood. The finals proceeded as follows: Page playoff results from the 2004 Nokia Brier: Page playoff, including a bronze medal match, from the 2011 Scotties Tournament of Hearts. Reaction Players and fans alike have had a mixed reaction to the system. Broadcasters enjoy it as it produces one more game than the single elimination format.

The CED is composed of six members of the State legislature and ten members of the public appointed by the current Governor and represent several industries within California.  History  The Commission served the state under the statutory Chairmanship of Lieutenant Governors from 1971 through 1994, but in the seven years that followed, funding for the Commission was not included in the annual state budgets. Recognizing the need for additional economic development efforts, Governor Gray Davis and the Legislature restored funding for the Commission in 2002. In mid-2003, the Governor appointed a sufficient number of members to establish a quorum. Under a previous Chair, Lt. Governor Cruz Bustamante, the Commission held its first official meeting in more than ten years on December 15, 2003. The most recent Chair, prior to Gavin Newsom, was Lieutenant Governor John Garamendi. Under Garamendi, quarterly meetings took place in July and November 2007 and February and May 2008. He ended his term as Lieutenant Governor of California when he was elected into office in 2009. The current Lieutenant Governor, Gavin Newsom, provided an agenda for economic growth and competitiveness for California in 2011. This agenda was the first statewide economic plan in over ten years. By 2016, over 75-percent of the recommendations presented in the plan had been at least partially implemented.  Duties  Pursuant to California Code ¬ß14999-14999.10, the Commission has the following powers and authority to carry out its statutory duties: ¬∑ Evaluating specific economic development problems and providing recommendations for possible solutions. ¬∑ Maintaining communication about economic dilemmas between the state government and the private sector. ¬∑ Make recommendations to legislation regarding ongoing economic development projects and programs . ¬∑ Evaluate development programs to ensure cost efficiency. ¬∑ Preparing specialized reports, which can include key secondary outcomes on economic development of programs and/or regulations, to support and guide the Governor or Legislature.  Objectives  The Commission for Economic Development assesses issues relating to developing the economy and workforce, trade and government efficiency. Its many goals include increasing effectiveness of the government and its partners in developing and augmenting the workforce of California. While maintaining the workforce, the commission seeks to assemble a strong connection between workforce development and a growing economy, all while encouraging education. The large-scale goal of the CED is to unite all major aspects of an economy (development, small businesses, trade, regulations, etc.) to transform California into a productive and continuously growing entity.

O'Connell (born October 8, 1951) is an American politician and formerly the 26th California State Superintendent of Public Instruction, having been elected to the post in November 2002 with 61% of the vote. He was re-elected to his post by receiving a majority (52%) of the vote in the Primary election on June 6, 2006, thus avoiding a November run-off. He is a member of the Democratic Party. O'Connell was unable to run for a third term in 2010 due to term limits and was succeeded by former state assemblyman Tom Torlakson. Career Before his election to the Legislature, O'Connell served on the Santa Barbara County School Board. O'Connell previously served in the California State Senate representing the 18th District from 1994 to 2002. O'Connell considered a bid for President Pro Tem of the State Senate in 1998 but ultimately decided not to run. He also served in the California State Assembly representing the Central Coast-based 35th District from 1982 to 1994. From 1994 to 1996, O'Connell employed as a legislative aide Tara Reade, who had recently left the office of then-U.S. Senator Joe Biden. In his 2006 re- election campaign, O'Connell won every county in California with at least an electoral plurality. Although the State Superintendent of Public Instruction is officially a non-partisan position, O'Connell is a member of the Democratic Party, and political parties will routinely make endorsements of candidates in the election (which was the case with O'Connell). Personal life O'Connell was born in Glen Cove, New York. In 1958, he moved with his family to Southern California, where he attended local public schools.

He made the earliest sound films in the Persian language. He was also a writer and journalist and promoter of liberal politics. Biography Early years Abdolhossein Sepanta was born in the Vagonkhaneh Avenue area in Tehran in 1907. His father, Gholam Reza Khan was the translator of Mozzafar-al-Din Shah, a King of the Qajar dynasty. Abdolhossein began his studies at the Saint Louis and Zoroastrian Colleges in Tehran circa 1925. He found a keen interest in ancient Persian history and literature. Therefore, in 1927, he chose Sepanta as his surname. In 1927, he traveled to India via Bushehr. There, he became acquainted with Dinshah Irani as his Indian Translator, who was the director of the Persian Zoroastrian Society. After extensive studies in ancient culture, he returned to Iran for a short period. Sepanta soon returned to India again with plans for a lengthier stay. He continued to study ancient Iranian culture and literature. Encouraged by his teachers and professors, Sepanta started his activity in cinema. Lor Girl As Sepanta took more interest in film, he found that there was a possibility one of his productions could make it to theaters in Iran through some competitive tactics. The leading Iranian films producer at the time was Oganes Oganians, a Russian Armenian immigrant who pioneered the industry in Iran. His silent films were a hit in Iran and were modeled after a series of Danish comedies aired in the previous years. Looking at the advanced technology available in British India, Sepanta realized that he could bring to Iranian cinema the first talkie film. In 1931, with an acquaintance Ardeshir Irani, a parsi from the local community, Sepanta began production of the Lor Girl at the Imperial Film Co. in Bombay. The movie was the first film with people talking in it as well as one of the first productions in a Muslim country to cast a female. The movie was screened in October 1933 in Tehran at two major movie theaters, Mayak Cinema and Sepah Cinema, and was surprisingly a major hit. Contrary to the expectations of cinema managers, who relied on foreign films, The Lor Girl was an instantaneous success and set up a new record of sale and running period which was not beaten for several years. Sepanta wrote the entire script and played the leading male role as well. The story is about Golnar, a village teahouse maid that falls in love with Jafar, a government agent. The two fall in love and escape to India until political tensions in troubled Iran die down. The movie is said to be a subtle political commentary on the lack of general public security during a period when the Pahlavi dynasty is replacing the Qajar dynasty in Iran. The leader of early Iranian cinema In the 1930s, there were nine talkie films produced from 1931-1937. Of these nine, five are Sepanta's films. He's considered by many to be the Leader of that era, when films were mainly political documentaries and films for entertainment were disliked by the ruling dynasty. He was director, screenwriter, and many times, the lead role of his films. These were The Lor Girl (1931), Ferdowsi, Shirin-o-Farhaad, Black Eyes, and Leyli o Majnun (1936 film), which were produced in India. Sepanta was a man of letters and a prominent scholar in pre-Islamic Persian literature, therefore his films were extremely national and historical, a trend which prevailed in other artistic and literary circles at the time and was the outcome of the suppressed but restless social and cultural situation in the society. Concerning his motives in making A Lor Girl, Sepanta explains later: Until 1933 and The Lor girl Iran's cinema was not so popular and the few cinemas in Tehran and other major cities just served the aristocracy and some particular classes of the society. Moreover, Iranian filmmakers had no clear line of thought. With the exception of Sepanta, who used the elements of Iran's ancient literature in his works, other filmmakers would mostly imitate foreign movies. Sepanta's superior films raised the expectations of Iranian movie audiences. In 1934, he made his second film Ferdowsi at the millenary celebrations of the great Persian epic poet Ferdowsi. Sepanta's third film. Shirin-o-Farhaad. was based on a romantic story from Nizami dramatic poetry. The film was shot in India in four months and was screened towards the end of 1934. Sepanta directed his fourth film, The Black Eyes, and screened it in Tehran for four weeks. In 1936, Sepanta made his final commercial film, Laili-o-Majnoon. Between 1930 and 1936 the Iranian film industry was shut down, and Sepanta continued his activities alone, and produced his films and kept the market live and busy. After Laili- o-Majnoon, Sepanta prepared for shooting another script with the working title of The Black Owl. However, the project never materialized, nor did another screenplay he had written on the life of Persian mathematician, astronomer and poet Omar Khayy√°m. Conservatism and the Calcutta Iranians Sepanta's early films were filmed in Bombay with Parsis as organizers and cast of different backgrounds. For some reason, in 1935, Sepanta packed his things and left Bombay for Calcutta to seek out opportunities in the Bengali cinema. This final film, Laili-o-Majnoon, was based on a full-scale dramatic poem by Nizami similar to that of Romeo and Juliet. The Basravi family made many peripherals that added to the script such as detailed information regarding exterior and interior scenes, dialogues, and actors‚Äô movements, settings, costumes, lighting, sound effects and camera movements. They also contributed in making explanatory notes on editing and film processing made that are offered and scene descriptions by carefully worked-out drawings. Though the other 4 scripts are available, none of them show such detailed workmanship. Due to the changing political climate in Iran, Laili-o-Majnoon never saw any comparable market success. Return to Iran In 1935, he left Calcutta (Kolkata) for home, hoping that he could enlist government assistance to establish a film production studio in Iran. However, he failed to gain enough support for his projects from the new government. Dr.Sassan Sepanta quoted his father in an interview: Sepanta who had been disappointed, sold his Laili-o-Majnoon at a very cheap price to cinema owners in Tehran, he was about to return to India for the last time to shoot The Black Owl and Omar Khayy√°m, when he was retained in Esfahan by his mother's illness. He never to India again. Sepanta after filmmaking Between 1934 and 1954, not a single film was produced in Iran and when filmmaking activity was resumed, Sepanta was living in seclusion in Esfahan. In 1943 he started publishing his weekly magazine(Sepanta Newspaper). He had difficulty to continuing publishing his magazine because of his ideology and political thought, which holds liberty as the primary political value and seeking a society characterized by freedom of thought on the authority of government. Therefore, he has been forced to close his magazine in 1954. From 1955 he was the Iranian consultant of the United States Aid Program in Esfahan. Finally after 30 years Sepanta took up filmmaking again but not as a professional. He bought an 8 mm Canon camera and made a number of short documentary films between 1967 and 1969. The Autumn, one of his 8 mm films, was presented 2 years after his death at the 26th session of the Free Cinema Workshop in 1971 in Iran. Throughout his life he wrote and translated eighteen books including: *Ethical philosophy of the Ancient Iran, *Who was Zoroaster and what He did, *The elementary Mazdyasna, Rays of Philosophy in Ancient Iran, *Selected Poems from Dehqan Samani and Mirza Abolvahab Golshan Iranpour, *The collected poems of Sepanta, and The poems of the Pahlavi Period. Abdolhussein Sepanta has played a fundamental role in the formation and growth of the Iranian movies, who has been known as the father of Iranian sound films in Iran. Sepanta died in Esfahan of a heart attack on 28 March 1969.

The Aros can also be found in about 250 other settlements mostly in the Southeastern Nigeria and adjacent areas. The Aros today are classified as Eastern or Cross River Igbos because of their location, mixed origins, culture, and dialect. Their god, Chukwu Abiama, was a key factor in establishing the Aro Confederacy as a regional power in the Niger Delta and Southeastern Nigeria during the 18th and 19th centuries.  Origins and history  The history of the Aros predates Igbo migration and founding of the kingdom of Arochukwu. Before Igbos started arriving to the Aro region in the 17th century, Ibibios arrived from the Benue and plateau area and founded states such as Obong Okon Ita and Ibom west of the Cross River. Igbo migrations led by Eze Agwu and Nnachi into the Aro region started in the mid-17th century. These Igbo migrants were resisted by the indigenous Ibibio. The Aro-Ibibio wars and the migration of the Akpa from east of the Cross River, formed the nation during the turning point of the 17th century to the 18th century. The Igbo and Akpa alliance, defeated and assimilated the original Ibibio inhabitants after long years of warfare. By this time, the palm oil and slave trade was popular in the hinterland. By the mid-18th century, there were mass migrations of Aro businessmen to the Igbo hinterland and adjacent areas. This migration, influence of their god Chukwu Abiama through priests, and their military power supported by alliances with several related neighboring Igbo and eastern Cross River militarized states (particularly Ohafia, Abam, Abiriba, Nkporo, Afikpo, Ekoi, etc.) quickly established the Aro Confederacy as a regional economic power. However, Aro economic hegemony was threatened by the penetration of Europeans, mainly British colonists towards the end of the 19th century. Tensions finally led to bloodshed, and the Anglo-Aro war took place from 1901 to 1902. The Aro Confederacy stoutly resisted but eventually suffered defeat. This helped the British to occupy the rest of what became Eastern Nigeria.  Tradition  The Aros have a rich tradition. One factor is the Ekpe society which is a sacred society originally from east of the Cross River. The highly religious and judicial society took a major part in Aro society. The use of the writing system, Nsibidi, was based on secret societies like Ekpe. Uli, another writing system, occurred mostly in the form of body art. Another factor is the Chukwu Abiama Temple, which was mediated by the Aro priesthood. They influenced neighbors and allies before the British invasion and destruction of the Chukwu Abiama Temple and Aro priesthood.The Ekeleke masquerade activity was important in Aro settlements. Brought from the Aros in the western Niger Delta, it eventually spread to the Oguta area. They also were known for wearing the popular \\"George\\" cloth. The Ikperikpe warrior dance was very famous among warriors in the old days and continues to be in use.

The play tells the story of Jody and Carl, two gay men who live in an unnamed American city. The play was written during the midst of the AIDS epidemic, which is the central focus of the story, though ultimately the play sends the message that one should pay attention to the world around them and realize its problems rather than shun it. The play heavily references the Eug√®ne Ionesco comedy The Chairs. Plot Jody, a gay man, owns a small map store on the oldest street in an American city, and is seemingly worldly and knowledgeable. Carl, another gay man is a frequent visitor to the store, is a friend of Jody, and seems to lie a lot about his life and occupation. Despite this, the two seemingly know very little about each other. The play begins with Jody explaining how he found a chair placed in his store one day, without notice, by Carl. Pretty soon, the store is littered with chairs, and after some argument between the two, it is revealed that every chair was owned by someone they knew in their community, who had died from the epidemic. It becomes apparent that Jody hasn't left his store for months on end, rarely going outside and rather having things brought to him. Carl has placed the chairs in his store in hopes that Jody will realize that there are things going on in their community, and as a member Jody must bear witness and help the problem, rather than shun the world. It is also revealed that Carl helps empty the residences of those taken by the epidemic, and can't stand to see the chairs abandoned and alone. Rather, he takes them to Jody's shop which is the biggest room he knows of. Carl succeeds in getting Jody to leave when he goes and gets tested for the first time. This leads to him taking a week off from the shop to see the world he abandoned and by the end finding out that he tested negative. However, a few months later, Carl's own chair appears in the shop and it becomes apparent that he will soon succumb to the disease. Now Carl has become the one who needs security, and Jody must pick up where Carl left off.  Characters  Jody, a man in his forties. Carl, a man in his early thirties.  Themes  Lonely Planet, despite its quips and comedy is ultimately a play about mourning and being forgotten: Jody struggles to cope with how much physical space Carl's mourning takes up and Carl struggles with how much space his mourning take up in his mind. He finds it impossible to do anything but mourn, when so many people he knows are dying, he has to pay attention. Jody's mourning is just as present but less visible, but over the course of the work we see that it is paralyzing him. He cannot leave his shop without being confronted by the death of his community and so he makes the only choice he feels he can: he doesn't leave. There are also multiple discussions in the work of what happens when society abandons the dead and refuses to see them.  Performances  Lonely Planet premiered at Northlight Theatre (with Russell Vandenbroucke as Artistic Director) in Evanston, Illionios in January 1993. Jody and Carl were played by William Brown and Phil Ridarelli respectively. The play was also performed later that year in July by A Contemporary Theatre in Seattle, WA, in February 1994 by The Barrow Group in NYC and the following year in June 1995 by Circle Repertory Company. Most recently it has been revived as an off-Broadway production by Keen Company, closing in November 2017. In this iteration of the work, Arnie Burton and Matt McGrath played Jody and Carl respectively.  Critical Reception  The most recent revival of the play by New York City's Keen Company was positively reviewed by several newspapers. Reviewers seemed to agree that Burton and McGrath were brilliant choices for the revival, commenting on their ability to bring the perfect amount of life and humour to the piece. Their performances also carried the nuance and weight of the play well, results in an emotional touch that \\"sneaks up on you to devastating effect.\\" > \\"But Mr. Dietz has something besides humor in mind (even if there is plenty > of it) and that something ‚Äî the weight of grief, the paralyzing fear of > illness ‚Äî emerges over the course of the show, like a photograph coming into > focus in a dark room.\\" > \\"Lonely Planet debuted in 1994, at the height of the AIDS crisis; its > depiction of the plague years still hits hard.

This market was previously viewed as an area of money lenders and crime related activities. However, through a network of professional outlets, unmanned outlets, internet outlets and cash dispensers and ATMs, Takefuji claimed to revolutionise the market. The operations were carried out through the following divisions: Consumer Financing division deals with unsecured and non-guaranteed loans, internet financing, debt counseling services, credit cards and the Other Operations division which deals with other financing, parking lot operations, golf course operations, venture capital, Karaoke booth operations, re-insurance. As of 31-Mar-2005, the Group consisted of the parent company, five domestic consolidated subsidiaries and five overseas subsidiaries. Scandal Once Japan's most profitable consumer finance company, Takefuji's reputation has been tarnished since founder and former chairman Yasuo Takei pleaded guilty in 2004 to charges he ordered illegal wiretaps on journalists.

Etymology  According to Wiktionary, Â∞ëÂπ¥ (pronounced as sh√†oni√°n) originates from Mandarin. Â∞ëÂπ¥ evolved into other pronunciations as Shonen (japanese) and a similar pronounced word with a similar meaning in Korean as ÏÜåÎÖÑ (sonyeon). The word Ê≥ï(fa) originates as a han character. It contains the same meaning(law) as the japanese character (Ê≥ï) except being pronounced as Ho.  Legal definitions  According to Japanese law, the term \\"shonen\\" refers to \\"a person from the time they enter elementary school until the time they are 15 years of age\\",, Article 4.3 and \\"Any person who has not reached the age of 15 years\\" (, Article 2.1). In the realm of education and culture, this is the period of compulsory education. While the term \\"shonen\\" can refer to both young males and young females, the generally accepted term for young females is sh≈çjo. The following meanings can also be inferred from \\"sh≈çnen\\" (a person under 15 years of age) with regard to juvenile law in Japan: ;:A youth who has been convicted of a crime or confessed to a crime.

Plot Mateo Melgarejo \\"Mateito\\" (Cantinflas) is a notary public and scribe for the illiterate people of Santo Domingo, a neighborhood north of Mexico City's Z√≥calo. A squatter friend asks for his help in negotiating with the land census bureau to regularize a land title.

Satellite image of Toronto in 2018 The geography of Toronto, Ontario, covers an area of and is bounded by Lake Ontario to the south; Etobicoke Creek, Eglinton Avenue, and Highway 427 to the west; Steeles Avenue to the north; and the Rouge River and the Scarborough‚ÄìPickering Townline to the east. In addition to Etobicoke Creek and the Rouge River, the city is trisected by two minor rivers and their tributaries, the Humber River in the west end and the Don River east of downtown. Both flow southward to Lake Ontario at Humber Bay and Toronto Harbour respectively, which are part of the longer Waterfront, as well as Etobicoke Creek and the Rouge River. The concentration and protection of Toronto's ravines allows for large tracts of densely forested valleys with recreational trails within the city. Approximately 26‚Äì28% of Toronto is covered with over 10 million trees, a fairly high percentage within a large city in North America and there are ambitious proposals to double the coverage. Toronto is on the northern edge of the Carolinian forest. The shoreline of the former Lake Iroquois is a major west‚àíeast geological feature, which was formed at the end of the Last Glacial Period. In the west end, Davenport Road follows the ancient shoreline with the steps to Casa Loma rising above and downtown skyscrapers clearly visible to the southeast. It merges with the current Lake Ontario shoreline at the Scarborough Bluffs promontory. The Toronto Islands are the only group of islands located on the western shores of Lake Ontario and were formed from the erosion of the Scarborough Bluffs. The Toronto Islands were originally a sand spit until a major storm separated them from the mainland during the 19th century. Toronto's immediate neighbours are Mississauga and Brampton within the Regional Municipality of Peel, Vaughan and Markham within the Regional Municipality of York, and Pickering within the Regional Municipality of Durham. The Greater Toronto Area (GTA) includes the regional municipalities of Halton, Peel, York and Durham. The GTA is part of a larger, natural ecosystem known as the Greater Toronto Bioregion. This ecosystem is bounded by Lake Ontario, the Niagara Escarpment, and the Oak Ridges Moraine, and includes many watersheds that drain into Lake Ontario. Some parts of Toronto, such as High Park and the lower Humber River, are located in the northernmost parts of the Carolinian forest zone found in North America. In March 2005, the Government of Ontario unveiled the boundaries of a greenbelt around the Greater Toronto Area, a area stretching from Niagara Falls to Peterborough. The green belt is designed to curb urban sprawl and to preserve valuable natural areas and farmland surrounding the city. However, some types of development including detached single residential, quarries and commercial facilities continue to get approved, exerting pressure and population growth on the Greenbelt. Toronto is among the latest in a line of cities that have implemented growth boundaries of some kind as a method of restricting urban growth, including Ottawa; Portland, Oregon; Frankfurt; Melbourne; Seoul and London. Climate Toronto's continental climate is moderated by Lake Ontario; its climate is among the mildest in Canada east of the Rocky Mountains, given Toronto's southerly latitude within the country. Downtown Toronto sits in a pocket of the humid continental climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Dfa) zone found at the southwestern end of Lake Ontario covering the southern part of the city ‚Äî including downtown (but excluding the Toronto Islands), where the annual average temperature exceeds . Some of Toronto, outside of the pre-1998 city limits and some suburban areas, fall within the Dfb climate regimen. This difference partly results from the urban heat island effect. Toronto is located in hardiness zone 7a, with increasing hardiness further away from the downtown core (5b in the suburbs). There is a high degree of variability from year to year and sometimes over a period of days, particularly during the winter months. Inner Harbour frozen over. Contrasting deeper areas of the lake, situated further away from the waterfront, waters near the shoreline may occasionally freeze over. Lake Ontario's water temperature varies due to upwelling of colder water or warmer pools of surface water creating very localized thermal contrast; the deeper waters of the lake, far from the shore, remain at a near-constant water temperature of , the effect of which is either cooling or warming (in winter). This creates generally warmer nights through the colder season than would otherwise occur. When offshore winds blow in summer, they warm as they near the lakeshore in the evening; conversely, the cooling effect by the lake is most pronounced on spring afternoons, which can affect Toronto even more than other cities on the Great Lakes due its exposure to onshore winds from the east to south-east, on some days, the temperatures can be as much as 10 ¬∞C (18 ¬∞F) cooler than areas far removed from Lake Ontario, an effect that wanes by summer when the dominant windflow becomes more southwesterly and the lake surface temperature warms. Springs and autumns are shorter seasons than summers and winters, and they feature varied weather with alternating periods of dry, sunny weather and rain. Many days in these seasons are sunny with pleasant rather than warm or cold temperatures. Nights are generally cool, but frosts are rare. Snow can fall in early spring or late fall but usually melt quickly after contact with the ground. At these changeable times of the year, temperature contrasts (up to in extreme cases) can occur within a short time frames due to rapidly changing air masses that sweep across the continent, often accompanied by high winds. Due to these airmass changes, temperatures of or above have been recorded as early as April 16 and as late as October 8. Conversely, temperatures of or below at night have been recorded as early as November 6 and as late as April 18. Snowfall has been reported as early as October 1 and as late as May 16. Toronto's weather is affected by the relative position of the polar jet stream and continental storm track, both of which pass over or near to the area with some frequency. This is determined by a number of complex global weather drivers, such as ENSO, NOA/AO Oscillations and the Polar vortex. There is no \\"dry season\\" precipitation falls in all months with regularity (but mainly snow during the winter), but summer rains result mostly from Thunderstorms which make for higher average amounts as a general rule with occasional dry periods. February and March rank as the driest months on average. Annual average precipitation is . Winter and snowfall Milliken, a residential Scarborough neighbourhood, during an ice storm, on 15 April 2018. Despite being cold, extended snow free periods occur in most winter seasons and precipitation can fall as rain with temperatures sometimes climbing above . Average winter snowfall is at the weather station in Downtown Toronto and at Toronto Pearson International Airport. The average January maximum/minimum is / in the city. There are usually a few colder periods where temperatures remain below and less frequently below at night (especially in the northern suburbs), with wind chills making it feel like . Due to its position on the northwest shore of Lake Ontario, Toronto is not a direct target of heavy, wind‚àíwhipped lake-effect snow squalls that hit other Great Lake cities on the south/east shorelines of the lakes, in areas where prevailing winds amplify lake effect. Despite this, there are usually two or more heavy snowfalls each winter which deposit at least accumulation, usually from powerful winter storms known as Alberta clippers, \\"Colorado Lows\\" or panhandle hooks that pick up moisture en route to the Great Lakes. These storms can produce strong easterly driven winds that fetch additional moisture from Lake Ontario. They frequently come with a volatile mix of snow, ice pellets, freezing rain and sometimes just ordinary rain, all of which can disrupt transportation, and in severe cases, interrupt power supply. A sustained freezing rain event occurred on December 22, 2013 plunging 30% of the city into darkness, some until after Christmas Day. Toronto snowploughs clearing the highway of snow during a winter storm. Such storms can also produce large snowfall amounts, higher totals found in areas closer to Lake Ontario, sometimes falling over a series of days or weeks creating havoc. On January 13, 1999, after a series of snowstorms, then-Toronto mayor Mel Lastman called in the Canadian Armed Forces to assist with snow removal and clearing streets. Within twelve days, the downtown Toronto weather station at the University of Toronto (Trinity College near Queens Park) recorded an average season's worth of of snow, much of it lake effect from Lake Ontario and a monthly record for January, but fell short of the snowiest month overall March 1870, with , of which fell over a 5-day span. February 2008 set a record a snowfall record for the month with falling at the airport. The winter of 2007‚Äì08 brought accumulated seasonal snowfall totals of downtown and at the airport. The heavy winter snows, in combination with record rains during June‚ÄìJuly of that year made 2008 the wettest year on the climate record with over of total precipitation. The largest single snowstorm on record took place on December 11‚Äì12, 1944, when accumulated, with on December 11 alone. On the opposite extreme, the winter of 2011‚Äì12 had the lowest seasonal snowfall total with only . March 2012 was the warmest March on record. The least snowfall in a calendar year was 2006, with only . The El Ni√±o influenced winter of 2009‚Äì10 had , March 2010 recorded no measurable snow, the first such occurrence in any March since 1946, and was followed by the warmest April ever on record.Ontario Weather Review Winter weather conditions in Toronto can vary greatly from one year to another and is significantly affected by global weather patterns such as El Ni√±o‚ÄìSouthern Oscillation (ENSO). El Ni√±o winters are generally mild and dry, with decreased snowfall (such as the winters of 2009‚Äì2010 and 2015‚Äì2016), while La Ni√±a winters tend have more precipitation (the aforementioned winters of 1999 and 2008 are both La Ni√±a). ENSO Neutral years are more unpredictable. Summer Boating around the Toronto Islands. Excursions to the island are a popular summer activity in the city. Maximum temperatures typically range from with moderate to high humidity, proximity to Lake Ontario and the other lakes contribute to summer humidity but far away sources like the Gulf of Mexico also factor in. The subtropical jet can move well north of the area in the midsummer influenced largely by the strength and position of the Bermuda- Azores High and ridging over the North American continent. The cooling influence of the lake exists but can be very localized to the immediate shoreline or move further inland, but this depends on windspeed and airmass. Temperatures over occur about 7 days each year but usually lasts no longer than a couple of days at a time (3 consecutive days of such temperatures is defined as a heat wave, which occur in most summers but maximums rarely exceed , which last occurred on July 21, 2011). However, coupled with high humidity the humidex value can rise well into the 40s during these heat events, creating great discomfort. Nighttime temperatures generally hover close to in the city but during hotter spells remain closer to . Summer heat episodes are usually broken by cooler, drier periods if only for brief periods. Thunderstorms are also a regular occurrence and can pop up quickly, especially west and north of the city in areas more prone to the \\"lake breeze front\\" or \\"lake breeze thunderstorms\\" phenomenon, in which intense, sharply defined squall lines develop quickly on summer afternoons amplified by localized wind patterns between the Great Lakes.Lake Breeze Weather These storms sometimes, but not always move into the city causing localized flooding resulting from downpours with high rainfall amounts, intense lightning but less often severe winds knocking down trees and powerlines. Severe weather and records In addition to snowstorms, ice storms, windstorms, heavy rainfall events associated with tropical storms or very severe thunderstorms, tornadoes are rare but do occur, particularly in the northern and western suburbs. That area sits in a \\"tornado alley\\" where tornadoes occur the most often in Canada. Downtown Toronto, on the other hand, is generally shielded from tornadic storms by the lake shadow resulting from the lake breezes. Tornado warnings have been posted for the city on a few occasions in the early 21st century, however, no touchdowns have been confirmed in the city limits since a weak tornado hit Scarborough in 1998. A pair of dangerous F2 tornados did touchdown in neighbouring Vaughan during a tornado outbreak on August 20, 2009. Toronto is susceptible to flash flooding due to its various ravines and valleys that can easily flood, as well as generally poor drainage due to its large urban area. Flooding can result from remnants of tropical storms, heavy rainfall combined with snowmelt, or summertime thunderstorms stalled out along lake breeze boundaries. Low-lying areas, such as the lower reaches of the Don River valley, are the most likely to flood. This often leads to the shutdown of the Don Valley Parkway. The alt=A generally flat area is completely submerged by water; trees are scattered throughout. The tropical storm remnant of Hurricane Hazel caused 81 deaths in October 1954 due to flooding that swept homes along river banks into Lake Ontario. A sudden downburst during a strong thunderstorm was believed to have played a contributing factor in the Air France Flight 358 crash on August 2, 2005. Just a few weeks later on August 19, part of a tornado outbreak in Southern Ontario, record-breaking intense rainfall, the worst since Hazel, deluged north-central sections of the city within a couple of hours and destroying a section of a major arterial road in North York resulting in record insurance claims. Some rain gauges recorded 175 mm (7\\") of rain, over 100 mm (4\\") in just one hour. Another large rainstorm with intense, record rainfall amounts struck a wide swath of the city during the afternoon rush hour on July 8, 2013 flooding city streets, subway tunnels, basements and knocking out power for over two million residents, stranding commuters, some having to be rescued from a submerged train. A daily rainfall record of 126.4 mm (5\\") was set at Pearson Airport, most falling in an hour and a half. Flood insurance claims are likely to exceed the 2005 storm due to a wider area affected. In the springs of 2017 and 2019, heavy rain combined with snowmelt led to the water levels of Lake Ontario to rise to record levels, flooding parts of the Toronto Islands and closing it to the public. The most severe heat wave in Toronto occurred in 1936, during the 1936 North American heat wave, when downtown temperatures in Toronto exceeded on three consecutive days (July 8 ‚Äì 10), with nighttime temperatures not falling below . The city was ill-equipped at that time to handle such a prolonged extreme heat wave, and heat stroke claimed 225 lives in the city, not counting indirect deaths from causes such as drowning. The hottest month recorded, however, was July 1921, when the average maximum temperature downtown was , and a mean temperature of still holds as the warmest month. At the airport, the highest monthly maximum average was in July 1955, records there only began in 1937. The highest humidex (combined feel of temperature and humidity) reached at the airport during the heat wave of July 1995, downtown on July 21, 2011. The coldest minimum temperature of was recorded on January 10, 1859. The coldest temperature recorded at Toronto Pearson International Airport was on January 4, 1981, and the coldest windchill recorded was on the same day. The coldest month overall was at the airport in February 2015 and at downtown in February 1875. Other notable cold waves occurred in January 1994 and February 1934. Winter cold snaps pose a danger as they often come with high winds, leaving the city's homeless population very prone to frostbite and hypothermia. Upward temperature trend Based on public records provided by Environment Canada, the average annual temperature has increased at Pearson Airport over a period of 25 years. If compared with the thirty-year normals from 1971 to 2000, more of this increase occurred at night: the average minimum temperature has been higher. Average precipitation during the same period was close to the average of the previous period, snowfall totals down only marginally with slightly higher rainfall. September and January have seen the highest average temperature increases. Part of this warming is likely attributed to increased urban growth surrounding the airport. An older study conducted in the 1990s analysed the heat island effect comparing data from selected regional stations, including both Downtown Toronto and Pearson Airport, enough for Downtown and the old City of Toronto to have a different K√∂ppen climate classification from its surrounding area.Impact of urbanization on the climate of Toronto, Ontario, Canada Statistics Topography Topographical map of Toronto The Rouge River and its valley at Rouge National Urban Park. The Rouge Valley is one of many hills and valleys in the area that was carved out during the Last Glacial Period. Toronto has numerous hills and valleys that were carved out during the last Ice Age. The ravines are largely undeveloped, primarily as the result of Hurricane Hazel in 1954. A significant topographical feature is the old shoreline of the Glacial Lake Iroquois, known as the Iroquois Plain. The plain consists mostly of sand deposits and eroded shale and gently slopes about 3-4 k.m. north from Lake Ontario. The Iroquois Plain joins Lake Ontario at the Scarborough Bluffs where erosion and the currents of Lake Ontario have carried sand deposits into Toronto Harbour to form the Toronto Islands. Above the Iroquois Plain the topography includes two features, the South Slope and the Peel Plain. The South Slope is the southern part of an interlobular moraine the Oak Ridges Moraine. The South Slope has a gentle slope as well, and experiences relatively high runoff as water infiltration is relatively low. The Peel Plain is mostly clay and generally flatter than the South Slope. Water infiltration is also low. Historically the Peel Plain and Southern Slope were considered to be high quality agricultural lands, unlike the Iroquois Plain which is very sandy. These areas are now heavily urbanized. Both Dufferin Street and Caledonia Road between Davenport Road and Eglinton Avenue run across numerous steep hills and valleys. This area has often been compared with the hills of San Francisco. Vaughan Road runs parallel to the buried Castle Frank Brook. The Don River is categorized as an underfit river, given that the river is too small for its much wider and deeper valley. The same is true for the Humber River, the Rouge River, and the various smaller waterways of Toronto. Grenadier Pond in High Park is the largest body of water fully within Toronto's city limits. During the winter, it becomes a natural skating rink.

(Gilbert of Hoyt)The form of his name appears in the works of Umberto Eco, for instance, Art and Beauty in the Middle Ages, p. 10 was a twelfth-century abbot of Swineshead Abbey, the Cistercian monastery in Lincolnshire, between about 1147 and his death in 1172. Swineshead had been a member of the monastic order of Savigny, which joined the Cistercian Order in 1147. Gilbert apparently went to Swineshead to help the community adopt Cistercian usages. Gilbert's surviving works are formed of seven brief spiritual treatises, some letters, and 47 sermons commenting on Song of Songs 3.1-5.10. (Sermones in Canticum Salomonis\\") Sometime after Bernard of Clairvaux died in 1153, Gilbert was asked to continue Bernard's incomplete series of 86 sermons on the biblical Song of Songs. Gilbert wrote 47 sermons before he died in 1172, probably at the French Cistercian monastery of Larrivour. Gilbert's 47 sermons ended in Chapter 5 of the Song of Songs; another English Cistercian abbot, John of Ford, wrote another 120 sermons on the Song of Songs, so completing the Cistercian sermon-commentary on the book. The sermons were fairly well-known, surviving in about fifty manuscripts.Bernard McGinn, The Growth of Mysticism, p. 298 References Modern editions *Gilbert of Hoyland.

It was released in Japan as one of four launch titles. Gameplay A TriIcelon is similar to the real-world triathlon. TriIcelons consist of three separate sporting styles in one game: running, sliding, and swimming. These three things combine to make a race where everyone competes for first place. The TriIcelons take place in four courses: Sweets, Jungle, Toys, and Horror. The player controls little penguin- like characters called Pen Pen, in a race consisting of the three separate sporting styles. Both the sliding and swimming parts are raced by tapping and holding the action button in a rhythmic motion to maintain a smooth flowing pace. The running section is controlled simply with the analogue stick, also with the ability to jump, and charge into other competitors. The playable characters include the Pen Pens Sparky and Tina, the Pen Hippo Ballery, the Pen Shark Jaw, the Pen Walrus Back, the Pen Octopus Sneak, the Pen Dog Mr. Bow, and the unknown-species Hanamizu. Story The Pen Pen are said to live on a small world called Iced Planet, and was here that the strange alien race were first discovered. Since the closest animal on Earth they resemble is the penguin, they were first given the name Pen Pen. The Pen Pen pretty much inhabit most of the planet's surface. It is believed they do, in fact, have their own language, but if so, it is totally incomprehensible to humans.From Issue #36 of Sega Saturn Magazine It was later discovered that they come in a variety of different shapes and sizes. Other types came from other planets to visit the Iced Planet. Six types have been discovered so far. In a world of snow, ice and water, the Pen Pen have mastered the arts of running, sliding and swimming, and always used to play about on an iced field. These creatures saw the Pen Pen and came up with an idea, and thus, the TriIcelon was born. This soon became the most popular sport on the Iced Planet. Pen Pens enjoy this sport everyday and never get bored of competing, but once a year, they hold a grand TriIcelon race to determine the number one TriIcelon player. The PenPen characters later made a cameo appearance on several posters in Blue Stinger's Christmas mall area. Reception Adam Pavlacka reviewed the Dreamcast version of the game for Next Generation, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \\"If you regularly play games with a group, pick it up ‚Äì otherwise make it a rental\\" The game received \\"mixed\\" reviews according to video game review aggregator GameRankings.

In one of its first major undertakings, the company conducted a six-month industrial reparations survey of post-World War II Japan in 1947. It ultimately prepared a report for General Douglas MacArthur. MacArthur's general view, however, was that Japan had already paid a heavy price, in that the war had totally shattered the Japanese economy, and Japan had lost all of the territories it had occupied in Manchuria, Korea, North China and the outer islands. (740.00119 Control (Japan)/3-2548, Report by the Director of the Policy Planning Staff (Kennan), March 25, 1948). The company also did work in underdeveloped countries. In the late 1940s, many poor countries desired to raise their standard of living by increasing output of food, natural resources and manufactured goods. Iran, for example, made a noteworthy start toward this end by engaging Overseas Consultants Inc. to advise on a proposed US$650,000,000 development program. (TIME Magazine, Oct. 24, 1949). The company conducted a detailed study that ultimately resulted in a multi-volume report. Today, the report provides invaluable historical insight into the economic development of Iran as of the late 1940s. Unfortunately, implementation of the plan fizzled out because the impoverished Iranian government lacked sufficient funds. Foreign aid donors - during, in part, the brief rule of Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadeq - did not provide money for implementation. (TIME Magazine, Jun. 4, 1951). The foreign aid donors were not forthcoming because Mossadeq and the Iranian government wished to see those funds or loans benefit Iran's oil industry directly, not benefit the Iranian-Anglo Oil company exclusively, which was owned principally by the British government. OCI was represented by the law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell, two of whose employees and partners were John Foster Dulles and Allen Dulles who in 1950 were not yet fully part of the U.S. government. When the OCI contract was thwarted by Mossadeq and the Iranian Parliament, John Foster Dulles and Allen Dulles declared personal war on Mossadeq. Once the two Dulles brothers officially entered United States government in 1953 as the Secretary of State and the Director of the CIA they arranged, with the help of Christopher Montague Woodhouse, the former chief of British intelligence in Iran, and head of the British Secret Intelligence Service, Sir John Sinclair, often referred to as \\"C\\", to overthrow Mohammed Mossadeq's government. The overthrow was overseen by Frank Wisner, a friend of Allen Dulles in Washington and a subordinate at the CIA. The onsite partner in the overthrow and CIA employee was Kermit Roosevelt. Mohammed Mossadeq detested Communism and considered the new President, General Eisenhower, a friend. Mossadeq's main crime was to thwart the profits of the Dulles brothers personally, their firm Sullivan & Cromwell, their clients OCI, the J. Schroder Banking Corporation, and Chase Manhattan Bank. The two banking clients appear to be minor players, the identity of the eleven engineering and consulting firms remains obscure and their pervasive influence in the post war rebuilding process something that needs to be further researched. The most disturbing thing about this incident involving Iran, the CIA, and the Dulles brothers, this is the introduction into world history of Frank Wisner the man in charge of the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba by the CIA in April 1961. Secondly the introduction by the Dulles brothers, Frank Wisner, and the CIA into history's stream of Mohammad Reza Shah later to be catalyst for the \\"Iranian Hostage Crisis\\" and the overthrow of the Shah by the Ayotallah Khomeini. Overseas Consultants also worked in such remote places as the southern highlands of Central Africa, studying vegetation and soils with respect to possible railroad construction.

Maurice Bergevin, the vice principal of the Etienne Brule School, stated that a study from Montreal in 1971 noted that if francophones in Toronto had the same proportion of schools that anglophones had in Montreal, there would be 31 francophone schools in Metropolitan Toronto. According to a 1971 Canadian federal census, Toronto had 160,000 francophones.\\"Toronto has 7 public schools for French-speaking children.\\" The Canadian Press (CP) at Montreal Gazette. Wednesday May 21, 1980. p. 66. Retrieved from Google News (66 of 141) on July 24, 2013. The number of French first language schools in Toronto has since grown to 26 (secular and separate). These do not include English school board's French immersion programs, which is intended for students whose first language was not French. Several alternative schools in Toronto are also operated by Toronto's public school boards. The oldest is ALPHA Alternative School, which opened in 1972.Toronto Star article: School marks 40 years The first conference for publicly funded alternative schools in the Greater Toronto Area happened in Nov, 2012.The GTA Conference on Alternative Public Schooling Ontario's Ministry of Education distance education program, the Independent Learning Centre, is also headquartered in Toronto. Secular Conseil scolaire Viamonde is a French first language secular school board headquartered in Toronto. Two public secular school boards operate in Toronto, the Conseil scolaire Viamonde (CSV), and the Toronto District School Board (TDSB). The former operates French first language schools in Toronto, whereas the latter operates English first language schools in the city. TDSB only operates schools in Toronto, whereas CSV operates as the school board for Toronto, and the larger Greater Golden Horseshoe region, and the Ontario Peninsula. Both school boards were created in 1998, as a result of the Fewer School Boards Act, 1997. Prior to 1998, each municipality in Metropolitan Toronto had a public English language school boards. The six school boards, the Board of Education for the City of York, the East York Board of Education, the Etobicoke Board of Education, the North York Board of Education, the Scarborough Board of Education, and the Toronto Board of Education, all operated under the Metropolitan Toronto School Board umbrella. The Metropolitan Toronto School Board served as the umbrella organization for the municipally-based school boards of Metropolitan Toronto from 1953 to 1998. As a result of the Fewer School Boards Act, and the amalgamation of Metropolitan Toronto, the six municipally based school boards were amalgamated to form TDSB. The assets of the former Metropolitan Toronto School Board were also amalgamated into TDSB. Prior to 1998, public French language schools were operated by the Conseil des √©coles fran√ßaises de la communaut√© urbaine de Toronto (C√âFCUT). As a part of the Fewer School Boards Act, C√âFCUT was merged with other school boards from the Greater Golden Horseshoe and the Ontario Peninsula in 1998, forming CSV. Separate Headquarters for the Toronto Catholic District School Board, the city's English-language separate school board. Two public separate school boards operate in Toronto, Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir, and the Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB). The former operates French first language schools in Toronto, whereas the latter operates English first language schools in the city. TDSB only operates schools in Toronto, whereas MonAvenir operates as the school board for Toronto, and the larger Greater Golden Horseshoe region. Prior to the amalgamation of Toronto in 1998, English and French separate schools in Metropolitan Toronto was managed by the Metropolitan Separate School Board (MSSB; Les Conseil des √©coles catholiques du Grand Toronto in French). French separate schools in Metropolitan Toronto were operated by Section de langue fran√ßaise, a French language unit of MSSB. In 1998, MSSB was reorganized, with its English and French components split. MSSB's English component formed TCDSB, whereas its French component merged with several other French separate school boards in the Greater Golden Horseshoe to form Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir.

Universities The University of Toronto is one of several universities located in the city. There are six universities located in Toronto. Four universities are located downtown, OCAD University, Ryerson University, Universit√© de l'Ontario fran√ßais and the University of Toronto. The University of Toronto also operates two satellite campuses, the University of Toronto Scarborough, located in the eastern portion of the city, and the University of Toronto Mississauga, located in the neighbouring city of Mississauga. The other two universities, Tyndale University, and York University, are based in an area of the city known as North York. York University maintains two campuses in North York, with plans to build another in the neighbouring city of Markham. Four of the five aforementioned universities are public degree-granting institutions. Tyndale is a private university and a Protestant seminary, and is the only private institution in Toronto with degree-granting authority. In addition to these six institutions, the city is also home to the University of Guelph-Humber, a collaborative institution between the University of Guelph (based in Guelph, Ontario), and Humber College (a college based in Toronto). Guelph-Humber is not an independent institution and does not have the ability to issue its own degrees. Guelph-Humber acts as a satellite campus for its parent institutions, and its graduates are awarded degrees/diplomas from either the University of Guelph or Humber College. Colleges In Canada, the term college typically refers to a technical, applied art, or applied science school. Four colleges have their principal campuses located in Toronto, Centennial College, George Brown College, Humber College, and Seneca College. In addition, the city is also home to the satellite campus for Coll√®ge Bor√©al, a college based in Sudbury, Ontario. From 1995 to 2001, the French first language college, Coll√®ge des Grands-Lacs, operated in downtown Toronto. Following its closure in 2001, Coll√®ge Bor√©al assumed control of Grands-Lacs facilities, maintaining it as a satellite campus for the institution. Overall, the five colleges operate 29 campuses spread throughout the city. Specialty Royal Conservatory of Music is a non-profit music education institution headquartered in Toronto. Toronto is home to a number of supplementary schools, which provides additional educational support for students in mainstream public, and private schools. The city also hosts a growing number of publicly funded and private English as a Second Language (ESL) schools and is home to as many as 10,000 ESL students at a time. These are either visa students primarily from Latin America, Asia and Europe, or newly arrived landed immigrants and Canadian citizens.

The Boulevard Saint-Michel, driven through this old quarter of Paris by Baron Haussmann, relegated the roughly parallel rue Saint-Jacques to a backstreet, but it was a main axial road of medieval Paris, as the buildings that still front it attest. It was the starting point for pilgrims leaving Paris to make their way along the chemin de St-Jacques that led eventually to Santiago de Compostela.Mullins, Edwin (2001) The Pilgrimage to Santiago, p. 3 The Paris base of the Dominican Order was established in 1218 under the leadership of Pierre Seilhan (or Seila) in the Chapelle Saint-Jacques, close to the Porte Saint-Jacques, on this street; this is why the Dominicans were called Jacobins in Paris. Thus the street's name is indirectly responsible for the Jacobin Club in the French Revolution getting that name (being based in a former Jacobin monastery, itself located elsewhere).Johann Heynlin and Guillaume Fichet established the first printing press in France, briefly at the Sorbonne and then on this street, in the 1470s.

In 2004, Auburn University was chosen by the World Food Programme, an agency of the United Nations and the largest humanitarian organization in the world, to lead the first student-led efforts in the War on Hunger. The number 19 in the title is symbolic of the 19 cents per day that it takes the World Food Programme to feed a hungry child in the developing world. Today, that number is estimated to be closer to twenty-five cents. There are currently 22 members on the Committee of 19, representing various student organizations and the university's colleges and schools. About the initiative Vision In partnership with the United Nations World Food Programme, Auburn University will be the catalyst mobilizing universities across the nation and around the globe to create a grassroots student campaign to conquer world hunger and malnutrition. The focus of the campaign will also give momentum to local hunger initiatives. \\"We believe in a world free of hunger. We believe that every man, woman, and child has a right to the basic human need of food. We believe that the skills we learn in the classroom reach beyond the bounds of our own selves and have the power to influence the lives of others for good. We believe that uniting our unique knowledge, talents, and skill sets can produce powerful cooperation and promote sustainable, effective change. We believe that collaboration on university, local, regional, national, and global levels is necessary for reaching universal solutions in our globalized world. We believe that a world without hunger promotes well being, increases productivity, embraces education, and proliferates peace. And because we believe these things, we have no choice but to take action.\\" Mission The mission of the Committee of 19 shall be to develop and implement an action agenda for students that encompasses *Hunger Awareness and Consciousness- raising *Academic Initiatives *Advocacy *Fundraising Through these facets, the Committee of 19 shall lead Auburn University and the local community in the effort to eliminate world hunger and malnutrition. Goal The goal of the Committee of 19 is to create a \\"War on Hunger\\" model that is suitable for replication by other universities across the nation and around the globe. In December 2005, students and administrators from Auburn University presented the War on Hunger model at a meeting of the National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges. Following the positive response from the presentation, Auburn University hosted the War on Hunger Summit on the weekend of February 17‚Äì19, 2006. Representatives from twenty-nine universities were present to learn more about the Auburn University War on Hunger model. Guests at the conference included: *Peter McPherson, President of the National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges *Catherine Bertini, former Executive Director of the World Food Programme and World Food Prize winner *Lauren Bush-Lauren, official spokesperson of the World Food Programme The War on Hunger Summit returned to Auburn University's campus in 2013.

Launched in September 2003 by The Washington Post Writers Group, Candorville features young black and Latino characters living in the inner city. Using the vehicle of humor, Candorville presents social and political commentary as well as the stories of its protagonists. Publication history Candorville grew out of a comic strip called Lemont Brown, which appeared in the student newspaper of UC Berkeley, The Daily Californian, from 1993 to 2003. It still appears in the Daily Californian under its new title, and it is that newspaper's longest-running comic strip. Candorville appears in most of America's largest newspapers. It also runs in Spanish-language newspapers where it is translated by the author's wife, Laura Bustamante. Candorville and Bell's other strip, Rudy Park, exist in a shared universe. For a period in 2017, the strips were amalgamatedDegg, D. D. \\"THE AMALGAMATION OF CANDORVILLE AND RUDY PARK,\\" The Daily Cartoonist (June 16, 2018). while Bell was dealing with health and exhaustion issues. In June 2018, Bell ended Rudy Park, although characters from that strip will continue to appear in Candorville.Degg, D. D. \\"CANDORVILLE/RUDY PARK AMALGAMATION EXPLAINED,\\" '\\"The Daily Cartoonist (October 21, 2018). (Candorville is syndicated in many more newspapers than was Rudy Park.) Because of its political content, Candorville, like Doonesbury, sometimes appears on a newspaper's editorial page rather than its comics page; like G.B. Trudeau's strip, Candorville has been accused of having a liberal slant, which has prevented the strip from being syndicated to some right-leaning newspapers. This is despite the fact that Candorville has lampooned liberal organizations like PETA, and liberal politicians like Hillary Clinton, Howard Dean, John Edwards, and Barack Obama.  Characters and story   Main characters  *Lemont Brown is the strip's main character. A talented young black writer, Lemont began regularly submitting articles to The New Yorker, and was regularly rejected in humiliating fashion. During this period Lemont worked for minimum wage at Pigville Pork Burgers. Constant prodding from his best friend Susan led him to create his own blog, which eventually led to his employment by a newspaper. Lemont is thoughtful, responsible, and clever, and he cares about both the world and his small circle of friends, whom he has known all his life. He is the consummate nerd, cannot dance, and is obsessed with science fiction. He is often seen self- referentially reading the book Thank God for Culture Clash, which is a collection of Candorville cartoons. :He got engaged to Roxanne, an ignorant and deranged woman who had his love child. Based on actions in the strip, he did not appear to love this woman, but proposed to her anyway, apparently to stay close to his child. Eventually they broke up, with Lemont gaining custody of his son. This is a conflict with his (slowly and subconsciously) developing romantic feelings for and relationship with Susan Garcia (see below). He once wrote about the love of \\"Leroy\\" and \\"Susana\\" on his blog. Roxanne, as it turns out, might be an evil vampire. Meanwhile, his newspaper, the Candorville Chronicle, fired all of its reporters except for Lemont, so Lemont is working as the paper's Senior White House Correspondent. *Susan Garcia is Lemont's best friend. An upwardly-mobile Latina who works as a top executive at an advertising agency, Susan is ambitious, straightforward, and maybe a little too wrapped up in herself. She is constantly frustrated that Lemont does not seem to know how to make his dream a reality, as she did. She has a sister who changed her name from Esperanza to Hope (A possible reference to The House on Mango Street) in order to appear to be Anglo instead of Mexican. Susan has known Lemont all her life and they have been platonic friends, but they seem to have deeper romantic feelings for one another that neither one will acknowledge. However, as recently as the June 5, 2008, comic, Susan accidentally revealed to Lemont she loved him while offering to pay off his credit card debt. When Lemont frustrates her, she occasionally lapses into Spanish, like Ricky Ricardo. Susan's nemesis is her assistant at work, Dick Fink, who seems to sabotage her and obviously wants her job. Her clueless and ethically-challenged boss is Mr. Fitzhugh (possibly an homage to the philosopher George Fitzhugh who argued in favor of slavery as the natural and necessary state of black people). Mr. Fitzhugh often makes small changes to Susan's advertising campaigns to make them more dishonest. He once wore a T-shirt to work that said: \\"We invaded Iraq and all I got was this lousy $25 million contract.\\" *Clyde Dogg (also known as C-Dog) is Lemont's foil. Like Lemont, Clyde grew up in a broken home. Unlike Lemont, Clyde is irresponsible and lazy, and he blames everyone else for his own shortcomings. He seems to purposely validate every stereotype about black men, for which Lemont regularly scolds him. He seems stupid at times, but other times it seems as though his \\"stupidity\\" is an act he puts on just to thumb his nose to the world. Clyde dresses and acts like a thug, and very well might be one. But the only time he has been seen stealing so far, it has been from Lemont. He gets caught, but perhaps it's because he wants to get caught. He often calls Lemont \\"Big L\\", probably a reference to the rapper of the same name since Big L's first name was also Lamont. He castigates Lemont for \\"acting white\\" whenever Lemont reads a book or crosses the street at a crosswalk, and he jealously guards his thuggish street reputation. He once crossed the street at a crosswalk, for which his other friends called him a sellout. To get back in their good graces, C-Dog put a recliner in the middle of a busy street and went to sleep on it during rush hour, for which he was sent to jail. C-Dog is an aspiring rapper, and is unemployed. He has an illegitimate business selling fake Botox injections out of his trench coat in a dark alley. Curiously, months after C-Dog began that business, several real-life incidents occurred where women died after receiving fake Botox injections. Clyde has also periodically showed moments of surprising political insight, such as when he talked about how Mr Church embodied the \\"Magical Negro\\" stereotype , and when he commented about racist policing . Supporting characters *Reverend Wilfred is a formerly-liberal Democratic reverend in the mold of Al Sharpton, but after receiving almost $1 million from the White House Office of Faith- Based and Community Initiatives, the good Reverend suddenly did a 180 and became an ultra-conservative Bush supporter who uses his pulpit to preach against the evils of liberalism. He has recently begun to be slightly more skeptical of his turn-around, but has yet to recant his new ideals. It is revealed that he has used the entirety of his pay-off to better his community. He may be somewhat based on Jesse Lee Peterson. *Dick Fink is Susan's backstabbing assistant who is very obviously out to undermine her. *Roxanne is Lemont's white fiance√©. A vegan, Lemont brought her to a steak restaurant for their first date and it went downhill from there, but somehow Roxanne ended up pregnant with Lemont's child. Lemont, whose father walked out on his mother when he was a child, is desperate to make sure his child avoids his fate, and agrees to marry her. Unfortunately, it is nearly impossible to think of two people less suited for each other. While Lemont is easy-going and free- thinking, Roxanne is belligerent and bitter. She is insanely jealous of Susan and Lemont's friendship (sensing Lemont's subconscious love for Susan), and has attempted to break up the friendship between the two, but without success. Their child has been born and first appeared in a comic in October 2007. *Saxon Kenchu is a childhood friend of Roxanne's who claims that she's actually a vampire, and he is a Dhampir the half-vampire offspring of her and a vampire hunter named Artemis Kenchu. It's unclear whether this is true or whether this is an elaborate ruse he's using to break up Roxanne and Lemont (since he knows Lemont's heavily into sci fi and fantasy, he might be manipulating him). *Bus Stop Guy is a neocon who goes through great logical contortions to rationalize current events, such as the push against stem-cell research, the Iraq War, driving an SUV, the campaign against gay marriage, and many other issues. *Homeless Dudes Tyrone and Rosencrantz often appear living in alleys, cardboard boxes and on the sidewalks. They engage in absurdist dialogue and commentary. The two homeless characters may be an homage to the titular characters of the play Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead. *Past and Future Lemont Lemont is occasionally visited in his dreams by both past and future versions of himself. One version, who visits him from the past, is six or seven years old. The other version is 70‚Äì80 years old and speaks very cryptically. Once, before interviewing a Hurricane Katrina victim, Lemont was visited by himself from one week later, warning him to do something that he ended up not doing. A few times, the strip has been set in 1982 and past Lemont is the main character, who receives visits from present Lemont warning him to stay away from girls, and telling him to buy only certain comic books which will appreciate in value by the present day. *Mainstream Media Guy (also known as MSM guy) is a big, grinning, football jersey-wearing embodiment of the oblivious mainstream mass media. He first appeared in August 2006. Lemont runs into the MSM guy at the bus stop every once in a while, and the MSM guy shouts trivial news items to him, while ignoring or downplaying important events. He is related to The Internet, who is mostly the same except for not wearing any clothes save for a tin foil hat, and being slightly more erratic (believing that shaking hands can transmit Alzheimer's disease, among other things). *Al Qaeda's #2 Man is a walking, dismembered corpse who keeps getting blown up, coincidentally every time President Bush or the GOP are scoring badly in opinion polls.\\"Al Qaeda's No. 2 says end of West imminent, video shows,\\" CNN (July 5, 2007). Collections Eight collections of Candorville have been published in book form: # Candorville: Thank God for Culture Clash (2005) ‚Äî fearlessly covers bigotry, poverty, homelessness, biracialism, personal responsibility, and more while never losing sight of the humor behind these weighty issues.

At home, in honor of the first black President, Lemont's friend C-Dog summons the ghost of Richard Pryor for advice on how to stop saying the N-word. He finds himself on the run, impersonating Lemont on his book tour to hide from the insanely huge brother of a girl he's wronged.

While Lemont's political blog explodes, he faces his challenges at home. Lemont accompanies a 94-year- old World War II veteran on his final journey in the story. # Color-Blinded (2016) ‚Äî Lemont's a single dad raising a mysteriously smart two-year-old. He's also a journalist single-handedly running one of the top news sites in the country. The comic is based around Lemont trying to figure out how to cover the breaking news in Uganda and Russia, and interview every candidate in the 2016 presidential race. Lamont has to face the process of explaining to his son why he's supposed to respect the police, when the police don't seem to face any repercussions for killing so many unarmed people who look just like his dad. Despite his best efforts, people start to wonder if C-Dog is secretly the smartest, most morally upstanding man in the neighborhood. At the ad agency, Susan discovers why her boss won't ever let her fire her evil, conniving assistant. And Lemont accompanies the recently departed comedian Robin Williams on his final journey.

They first appeared on the market in 1994 as a more compact alternative to the full-sized Beretta 92 service pistol in order to offer a compromise between concealability, ease of carry, accuracy and firepower. Originally developed for the .40 S&W; cartridge, which was a new cartridge at the time, it was later also manufactured for other calibers, such as 9√ó19 mm, .357 SIG and .45 ACP. These pistols are suitable for use by police and for civilian self- defense. Description Rotating barrel locking rail. Cougar 8000 series pistols are recoil-operated, locked breech semi-automatic pistols. These pistols use a relatively rare rotating barrel locking system, in which the barrel rotates on recoil to unlock itself from the slide. The rotating motion of the barrel is controlled by the stud on its bottom, which follows the cam track in the steel frame insert. The frame is made from lightweight aluminum alloy. The basic version of the Cougar pistol is the F model, with double- action trigger with exposed hammer, and ambidextrous safety/decocker levers, located on the slide. Alternative is D version, which is double-action only, and thus have spurless hammer and no safety/decocker levers. Cougar pistols use double-stack magazines in 9 mm, .357 SIG and .40 caliber models, and staggered column magazines in .45 caliber models. Variants The 8000 series is available in several calibers and in either \\"F\\", \\"G\\" or \\"D\\" configuration.

The slide and barrel are the same length as the full size pistols. This variant is available in the \\"D\\" and \\"F\\" configurations.  Inox  Some models are available as an Inox version which has a stainless steel slide, barrel and other components.  8045 Cougar  The 8045 Beretta Cougar was produced between 1998‚Äì2004 in the D and F configuration. A Mini 8045 Cougar was also produced in the same configurations. No factory 8045 Cougars were produced in the \\"G\\" configuration, but prototype Cougars do exist in the G configuration as well as with a light rail.  8045 Cat Pack  250px In 1999, Beretta USA offered 2000 special edition kits to accompany the 8045F Cougar. Accompanying the basic 8045F was a kit consisting of a special edition case, lapel pin and charcoal laminate grips with inlaid cougar medallions. The pistol comes in the 8045F model which is a double/single-action-type pistol. Standard white dot sights and factory black plastic grips are standard with the \\"Pak\\" consisting of the case, wood grips and pin.  8045 LAPD  Beretta USA made an 8045F for the Los Angeles Police Department. One requirement of the LAPD using these firearms was the use of a 4-inch barrel. There were a limited number of these longer barrels produced to meet this need. Some barrels were shipped to the LAPD to be added and some were shipped directly from the factory already assembled in the pistols. However, BUSA had offered these barrels for sale to military/law enforcement officers for $198 only for a brief period. Some of these pistols were converted to a \\"G\\" model (decock only) by various agencies but were not offered in this configuration from Beretta USA.  Stoeger Cougar  Marketing and distribution of the Cougar has been transferred to Stoeger Industries, a subsidiary of Beretta. The firearms are made in Turkey, using Beretta factory tooling. Stoeger now produces Cougars in 9√ó19mm, .45 ACP, and .40 S&W.; Stoeger recently added a more compact-sized Cougar pistol to their production line, currently available in 9√ó19mm only. The Cougar Compact has a reduced magazine capacity of 13 rounds and MSRP is US$50 less than its full-size counterpart.

It has been claimed by COWI A/S that the City Circle Line is the largest construction project to have taken place in Copenhagen during the last 400 years.\\"The Copenhagen Metro, Denmark.\\" cowi.com, Retrieved: 10 June 2019. The network's total length is and has 17 stations. The line opened on 29 September 2019. Plans for its construction were approved by the Danish Parliament on 1 June 2007. Preferred bidders were announced during November 2010. The total cost was estimated at 15 billion kroner but had risen to 21.3 billion kroner ($ billion) when the contractors were announced in late 2010. It is a fully automated line, using driverless trains and capable of routine 24/7 operations. Italian rolling stock manufacturer AnsaldoBreda provides the trains for the new line, and the stations are intentionally similar to the Copenhagen Metro's existing stations. The transit agency Movia has projected that up to 34 million passengers eventually switch from buses to using the Metro during each year. History Background During 2002, the Copenhagen Metro, a fully automated driverless metro system, was opened. It quickly became known for its high level of reliability, attaining an operational punctuality in excess of 98 per cent of on-time arrivals. Due to its success, during 2005, plans were put forward for further expansion of Copenhagen Metro in the form of the City Circle Line.\\"The Copenhagen Metro.\\" Ramboll, Retrieved: 10 June 2018. As proposed, it involved the construction of a underground circular route, a total of 17 stations, and emergency escape shafts, to support two new underground lines, designated as M3 and M4. The planned City Circle Line would connect into the Kongens Nytorv and Frederiksberg stations of the preexisting metro network. During the summer of 2007, the Danish Parliament gave its approval for the construction of the proposed line, although it would be another four years before construction activity would commence. At the time of its approval, the project had an projected cost of DKK21.3 billion ($3.2 billion) along with an anticipated date of completion by July 2019. Transport group Metroselskabet held overall responsibility for the City Circle Line. Contracting On 7 January 2011, the civil engineering contract for the City Circle Line was awarded to the Copenhagen Metro Team (CMT), a joint venture comprising Salini Impregilo, Technimont, and SELI. Italian rail equipment specialist Hitachi Rail STS was selected to supply the trains, electrical infrastructure and communications systems, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA), platform-edge doors, and the signalling system. The route's tunnels were constructed by Seli Tunneling Denmark ApS, subsidiary of Seli SPA, and subsequently acquired by Salini Impregilo. Consultancy services regarding rolling stock and the automated train depot were sourced from Ramboll and WS Atkins.. The line incorporates various live data feeds for the purpose of highlighting hazards and recording any accidents using project compliance software ComplyPro, produced by software company Comply Serve. Construction During 2013, boring of a pair of 15.5km parallel tunnels commenced using a total of four tunnel boring machines (TBMs) named Eva, Minerva, Nora, and Tria. These tunnels were bored with an inner diameter of 4.9 meters and at a depth varying between 35 meters and 20 meters. The tunnels have been built by Seli Tunneling Denmark, that also manufactured two out of four machines in Denmark, at a facility especially prepared for the task. The interior walls of the tunnel have been coated with concrete and multiple emergency shafts have been installed for the purpose of providing ventilation and maintenance access. The extracted earth produced by the construction effort was routinely used to fill the Nordhavn reclamation project in √òresund.Marfelt, Birgitte. \\"Nordhavnen er p√• vej ud i sejlrenden.\\" Ingeni√∏ren, 31 August 2013. Accessed: 16 October 2013. During the construction process, it was commonplace for geological sensors to be deployed in the general vicinity to monitor ground movements for the purpose of protecting buildings and other structures in the city. During 2014, the line's control and maintenance centre buildings were completed (at Vasbygade, https://ing.dk/artikel/metrocityringen-far-eget-kontrolcenter-pa- kalvebod-brygge-87424 Metrocityringen f√•r eget kontrolcenter p√• Kalvebod Brygge). That same year, various other works were finished, including the walls around all of the stations, and three of the shaft structures. Reportedly, the final construction activity was centered upon the refurbishment of the surrounding areas around the new stations. Stations and route Overview Diagram of Copenhagen Metro opening of the northern part of the M4 (2020) The 15.5 km City Circle Line serves 17 stations. It crosses the M1 and M2 lines at Kongens Nytorv and Frederiksberg stations, and suburban train services at K√∏benhavn H, √òsterport and N√∏rrebro. It extend the Metro network to the N√∏rrebro and √òsterbro areas and K√∏benhavn H (the Copenhagen central station). The City Circle Line services to many of the major areas of Copenhagen, including the Danish Parliament, the Central Station, City Hall, and multiple stations of the S-train and existing metro stops. Access to the region and commuter heavy rail network is also deliberately provision for at several places along its route; furthermore, a twin-track line provides a connection between the City Circle Line and the Nordhavnen Metro. Just as M1 and M2 share a section of the existing metro, the City Circle Line shares a 6-station section with the M4 line. Initially, two possible routes were considered, after an even bigger screening of ideas. In December 2005, it was announced that the Copenhagen and Frederiksberg municipalities had selected the Frederiksberg route; the purpose is to cover areas not yet served by S-trains or the Metro. The finished City Circle Line has been promoted as playing a heavy influence upon much of Copenhagen's current transport network. The transit agency Movia projects up to 34 million passengers switch from buses to the Metro annually. Once the line is completed, 85 per cent of all homes, work places and educational facilities in Copenhagen's inner city area, as well as the surrounding neighbourhoods, shall be less than a ten-minute walk from either a metro or train station. It has been projected for the line is used by approximately 240,000 passengers per day. It is fully automated, being operated using a driverless system that provides 24/7 service coverage and at a peak frequency between trains of 100 seconds. It is intended for trains on the line to achieve an average speed of 40km/h during regular service. As such, performing a round journey on the line is estimated takes approximately 24 minutes. Stations The stations of the City Circle Line are all underground, with easy access from the street level to the platform. The structure of the stations is largely identical to that of the existing Copenhagen Metro stations. They are built at a depth of approximately 19 meters using cut-and-cover methods; a standardised box structure has been adopted, measuring 64 meters by 20 meters. Each one is outfitted with island platforms of between 7 meters and 9 meters. Stations are listed counterclockwise, beginning in the southeast. * K√∏benhavn H (Copenhagen Central Station, interchange with S-trains, DSB and SJ) * R√•dhuspladsen (City Hall Square) * Gammel Strand near Christiansborg Palace * Kongens Nytorv (interchange with M1 and M2) * Marmorkirken (The Marble Church) * √òsterport (interchange with S-trains and DSB) * Trianglen (close to the Parken Stadium) * Poul Henningsens Plads * Vibenshus Runddel * Skjolds Plads * N√∏rrebro (interchange with S-trains) * N√∏rrebros Runddel * Nuuks Plads * Aksel M√∏llers Have * Frederiksberg (interchange with M1 and M2) * Frederiksberg All√© * Enghave Plads While the stations have a similar structure to those of the current Metro, they have been designed with more varied materials and colors, making each individual station more recognisable. Rolling stock Italian rolling stock manufacturer AnsaldoBreda, which had previously provided trains for the existing Copenhagen metro, was selected to supply new-build rolling stock for the line. Deliveries of the trains to the Metro company commenced during 2014; these are being referred to as being the version 5 of the AnsaldoBreda Driverless Metro trains. While these vehicles are broadly identical to the ones running on the Copenhagen metro, they feature several advancements in technology, materials and design. The driverless trains are directly monitored from the line's centralised operations and maintenance centre; they are equipped with a communications-based train control (CBTC) for this purpose. These vehicles are to reportedly capable of a top speed of 90 km/h, an increase over the 80 km/h maximum for trains used on other Metro lines. They have a maximum capacity of 314 passengers and there is a train every 100 seconds, giving a frequency of 36 trains per hour. The system runs hours per day, and passengers are able to keep track of the train location through an electronic display system.

The magazine also served as the publicity arm for the newly founded National Council of Jewish Women. The American Jewess was a periodical ‚Äúpublished in Chicago and New York between 1895 and 1899‚Äù in order to represent the ideas that were important to the American Jewish community during this time. This magazine, though it is not widely remembered in modern society, ‚Äúwas the first Jewish women's journal edited by women that were independent of any organizational or religious ties,‚Äù along with the ‚Äúfirst English-language journal independently edited by women.‚Äù. During the magazines ‚Äúfour years of publication, The American Jewess presented items on contemporary politics, literary figures, aesthetic issues, and‚Ä¶ practical matters‚Äù along with ‚Äúbook reviews and a children's department.\\" In all of its publications, the magazine engrained its contents with ‚Äúa Jewish political agenda as well as a feminist agenda,‚Äù both of which were often combined ‚Äúto produce both a strongly Zionist and an early feminist publication.\\" During its time in publication, the magazine published 46 issues throughout four and a half years, producing a circulation totaling approximately 31,000. History During 1890 to 1920 ‚Äúthousands of Jewish immigrants‚Äù came to the United States, seeking ‚Äúrespite from persecution, a place safe from repression and pogroms, and an opportunity to make a decent living.‚Äù By the end of the nineteenth century, many Jewish Americans ‚Äúwere in a position to live as other bourgeois Americans did‚Äù and ‚Äúemulate the lifestyle of middle-class WASPS.\\" Specifically, ‚Äúmiddle-class Jews of both sexes were emulating the folkways of the WASP (White Anglo-Saxon Protestant) community but were not integrated into it. They dressed, entertained and furnished their homes according to the patterns set by the majority but they celebrated different holidays and often found themselves unwelcome in gentile society.\\" Rosa Sonneschein (1847‚Äì1932), an enterprising woman from St. Louis, founded and edited the periodical. The American Jewess offered the first sustained critique, by Jewish women, of gender inequities in Jewish worship and communal life. Sonneschein gained support for the magazine during the Jewish Women's Congress at the World's Colombian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. The first issue was launched in April 1895. Because the magazine started to struggle financially in 1898, Sonneschein sold the magazine, but retained editorship. This move did not save the magazine and the last issue was printed August 1899..  Publications  Many different magazines were created for the ‚Äúeveryday‚Äù American women, such as the ‚ÄúLadies Home Journal, Woman‚Äôs Home Companion, Good Housekeeping and the Homemaker,‚Äù but none of them brought in the perspective of Jewish women. Due to this, ‚Äúa journal that modeled itself on one of the popular magazines read by Protestant counterparts but still contained enough that was central to Jewish concerns, might well appeal to the upwardly mobile Americanized‚Ä¶ Jewish woman.‚Äù It was from this ideology that The American Jewess was born. The topics in The American Jewess publications spanned across spectrums of political, feminist, and religious ideals. Some of the perspectives best reflected in the periodical are the editorials released by Rosa Sonneschein, the editor and creator of the magazine from the start and end of its publication. Sonneschein often ‚Äúused her editorial pages to advance her views on virtually any subject‚Äù but mostly ‚Äú she dwelt primarily on 5 topics: the responsibility of Judaism to Jewish women; the responsibility of Jewish women to themselves and to Jewish family life and culture; the responsibility of American Jews to the United States; the identification and eradication of anti-Semitism; and the promotion of Zionism.\\" In the midpoint of the magazines life, ‚ÄúApril, 1897,‚Äù the American Jewess published a piece in support of the ‚ÄúNew York City teachers who were fighting for equal pay.\\" Sonneschein, ‚Äúurged all women workers to ‚Äúforce‚Äù their employers to end‚Äù discrimination in the workforce. Sonneschein was a strong advocate for women's rights, and reflected this in her pieces by expressing her expectation that the Jewish Reform movement would ‚Äúexpand its recognition of women's equality and to support full enfranchisement of women in their synagogues.\\" For example, she acknowledged the ‚Äúprogressive position of Reform Judaism in its liturgy and rituals, particularly for its replacement of the Bar Mitzvah ceremony‚Äù due to the fact that it ‚Äúignored the role of girls, with the occasion of confirmation, which included them.\\" Online The periodical was assembled and digitized for online access by OCLC from copies held by the Jewish Women's Archive, Hebrew Union College's Jewish Institute of Religion Klau Library, Brandeis University Libraries, and the Library of Congress.

More than 1,200 visitors per year visit the refuge. The facility is unstaffed, but is administered by the Wheeler National Wildlife Refuge in Decatur, Alabama. The cave itself is closed to the public. Topography Most of the Fern Cave NWR is on the western side of Nat Mountain between Scottsboro and Huntsville, Alabama. The Paint Rock River, a tributary of the Tennessee River borders the northwestern side of the refuge. Elevation ranges from the relative flat area around the Paint Rock River valley to a 1,500+ foot elevation at the top of the mountain. Fern Cave Entrance to Fern Cave Fern Cave NWR is named after the profusion of ferns the original explorers found in the Surprise Pit sinkhole.Donal R. Myrick, Fern Cave (book), Huntsville, Alabama (1972), 106pp. Another entrance used to feature the federally endangered American Hart's-tongue fern (Phyllitis scolopendrium).American Hart's-tongue fern The fern population has disappeared since 1985 from a high of twenty due to the actions of illegal plant collectors. The fern grows in a small pit in Morgan County, but it is closed off due to the species being grown there and the cave it grows in is privatized. Fern Cave itself is described as a \\"vertical and horizontal maze\\". There are 12 different levels connected by canyons and pits. The cave is approximately long and the system is deep. The cave remains very inaccessible. At least one experienced spelunker has died in the cave. There are five entrances to the cave although only four of them are within the Fern Cave NWR. The fifth entrance is owned by the Southeastern Cave Conservancy.Southeastern Cave Conservancy, Inc. Wildlife Fern Cave serves as a home to the largest colony of federally endangered gray bats in the United States. NWR officials estimate that over 1.5 million gray bats use the cave annually. Biologists with the US Fish and Wildlife Service have confirmed the presence within the cave of the fungus that causes White nose syndrome.https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-sci-sn-bat- disease-20130408,0,5401570.story Approximately 200 species of animals use the refuge. Other than the endangered bats, the cave contains cave fish (Typhlichthys subterraneus), cave crayfish, banded sculpins, cave salamanders (Eurycea lucifuga), and northern slimy salamanders (Plethodon glutinosus). Other animals on the refuge include (Cottus carolinae), bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), yellow bullhead catfish (Ictalurus natalis), . Outside of the cave, white-tailed deer, wild turkeys, squirrels, opossums, raccoons, and rabbits. Facilities Map of Fern Cave NWR Fern Cave is not open to the public in order to protect the endangered bats which reside within. The remaining portion of the Refuge is open to the public, although its use is limited due to the rugged topography. Even though the bats leave the cave nightly for food, the refuge recommends against viewing the emergence. The area around the cave entrances is steep and potentially dangerous in the dark. Thus, the park closes around dusk. Otherwise, there are opportunities for hiking, photography, and wildlife observation at the refuge.

CRK was modeled after New York‚Äôs Hudson Riverkeeper and was the 11th licensed program in the international Waterkeeper Alliance. In 2012, the organization officially changed its name to simply Chattahoochee Riverkeeper (CRK), dropping the \\"Upper\\" to better reflect its stewardship over the entire river basin. CRK‚Äôs primary geographic focus begins at the river's headwaters in the north Georgia mountains above Helen and continues downstream to West Point Lake, encompassing more than 200 miles (320 km) of the Chattahoochee River and 3,600 square miles (9,300 km2) of watershed. The Chattahoochee River meets the Flint River above Lake Seminole to become the Apalachicola River in Florida. CRK is best known for its legal action against the City of Atlanta which resulted in the city revitalizing their infrastructure to address a major sewage problem, thus ensuring a cleaner river for the community. CRK \\"actively uses advocacy, education, research, communication, cooperation, monitoring and legal actions to protect and preserve the Chattahoochee and its watershed.\\" History Upper Chattahoochee Riverkeeper was founded in 1994 by Laura Turner Seydel and Rutherford Seydel. Modeling the Chattahoochee program after New York's aggressive and successful Hudson Riverkeeper, they sought to create a focused environmental advocacy initiative led by professional staff and committed volunteers. With funding from the Turner Foundation and other local supporters, UCR officially opened its doors for business on March 1, 1994. Since 1994, a dedicated and diverse board of directors has guided the organization in its transformation from a scrappy group of paddlers, scientists, anglers and environmental activists to a respected organization that has won many victories for the Chattahoochee River Basin. Since its founding, Sally Bethea has served as Executive Director and Riverkeeper. The group changed its name to Chattahoochee Riverkeeper in 2012. After 20 years of running the organization, Sally Bethea retired at the end of 2014. The organization had grown substantially since its founding, and, as a result, CRK divided Bethea‚Äôs role into two separate positions: riverkeeper and executive director. The role of riverkeeper was filled by longtime staff member Jason Ulseth, and CRK‚Äôs general counsel, Juliet Cohen, became the new executive director. In 2015, the non-profit won a $10 million Clean Water Act settlement: one of the largest in Georgia's history. A U.S. District Court Judge ordered American Seal Coat LLC. to pay for damages inflicted when the manufacturer dumped pollutants into a tributary of the Chattahoochee in violation of permits. Current work Chattahoochee Riverkeeper actively works to protect and preserve the Chattahoochee watershed through legal work, policy work, technical programs, communication, education, and recreational activities.  Legal Work  Legal work includes working with legislators to strengthen regulatory protections for waterways, lobbying to protect water resources, and pursuing legal action when necessary to ensure that the laws that protect drinking water supply are properly enforced. In 2015 the organization won a $10 million dollar settlement against a polluting business for violations of the Clean Water Act. CRK also \\"reviews Environmental Protection Division files and Discharge Monitoring Reports for problem facilities, and when identified, will develop strategies for compliance.\\"  Policy Work  In policy, CRK promotes water conservation and advocates for water efficiency measures, protection of our water supply at all levels of government, and effective and wise water planning for the watershed region. With regard to ongoing Tri-State issues, CRK addresses the conflict over water sharing and offers practical sustainable solutions.  Technical Programs  288x288px The technical programs include patrolling the watershed‚Äôs rivers and lakes, responding to citizen hotline calls and other reported problems, and monitoring water quality. CRK's Neighborhood Water Watch program works to assess and improve urban water quality for communities around the Chattahoochee. Community groups, citizens, and students gather water samples from local tributaries and deliver them to CRK conductivity, turbidity, and E. coli testing.  Education  Newsletters, sent two times a year, and bi- weekly electronic news flashes keep citizens in the loop on water issues and events. Education and training includes teaching children, citizens, business people, and policy-makers how to protect the Chattahoochee. CRK educates thousands of children each year onboard floating classrooms on Lake Lanier and West Point Lake to learn about water quality and river stewardship.  Recreation  Recreational activities promote responsible appreciation of the Chattahoochee through kayak and canoe trips, river races, and other activities.  Locations  Additional offices in Gainesville and LaGrange provide education, enforcement and partnership to citizens and groups in the headwaters and the southern regions of the Upper Chattahoochee area.

The most important historic structures on the site are the brick slave cabins which date between 1790 and 1810. The plantation, which used slave labor until the American Civil War, is one of America's oldest plantations still in operation, and has continually produced agricultural crops for over 320 years. The historic site also includes a 1936 Colonial Revival style dwelling, as well as multiple significant landscape features, including an all√©e of southern live oak trees believed to have been planted in 1743.Located at 1235 Long Point Road, Mount Pleasant SC 29464-9020 History 17th and 18th centuries The earliest known reference to the site is in 1681 in a land grant of from owner Theophilus Patey to his daughter Elizabeth and her new husband Major John Boone as a wedding gift when the land became known as Boone Hall Plantation, but it is unknown when a house was built on the site. John Boone was one of the early settlers of the South Carolina colony, arriving in 1672. Boone and his wife were ancestors of Founding Fathers Edward Rutledge and John Rutledge. He was elected to the Grand Council during the 1680s but was removed twice because he illegally trafficked enslaved Native Americans, associated with pirates and concealed stolen goods. He went on to hold other local offices, such as tax assessor and highway commissioner. When Boone died, he divided his estate among his wife and five children with his eldest son, Thomas, making Boone Hall his home. 19th century The Boone family owned the plantation until fourteen years after John Boone's death, when his widow Sarah Gibbes Boone sold the property to Thomas A. Vardell for $12,000 in 1811. Shortly after, Henry and John Horlbeck bought the property, using a number of the enslaved people who were previously employed in agricultural work as brick making laborers. During the early 19th century Charleston's landowners built and expanded their houses in town and along the Ashley river. The Horlbecks profited directly from the free, forced labor of their enslaved workers, including children enslaved at the site. While the Horlbeck brothers have received credit for \\"building\\" many houses and public spaces in downtown Charleston using the brick from their plantations, the enslaved workers accomplished the actual building under the watch of the Horlbecks and their overseers. The work of talented enslaved people, with self-taught and acquired skills, including carpentry, mathematics, and geometry were central to the construction and appearance of many Charleston area structures. By 1850, these enslaved laborers produced 4 million bricks, by hand, per year. The fingerprints of these people are still visible in the bricks of many of these historic sites. The Horlbeck family was responsible for one of the most marketable aspects of the plantation today- the Avenue of Oaks that lead up to the plantation house. They used enslaved gardeners and field laborers to plant each oak using hand tools in 1843. Similarly, the Horlbecks instructed their enslaved workers to plant pecan trees on the plantation, so that by end of the century, Boone Hall was one of the leading producers of pecans in the United States. When Henry Horlbeck died in 1837, several of his children settled his estate by transferring their interests in Boone Hall to four of his sons‚ÄîHenry, Daniel, Edward, and John Horlbeck. The sale occurred on October 1, 1842, and described the plantation as having a \\"Wooden Dwelling House[,] Brick Stables[,] Barns[,] Brick Kilns[,] and buildings\\" on 1442 acres \\"commonly called and known by the name of Boone Hall.\\" 20th century A 1900 photograph shows the former house. Canadian Thomas Stone purchased Boone Hall Plantation in 1935 from the Horlbeck estate, coinciding with the Colonial Revival Architectural era. Deciding that the surviving wooden house structure was not fitting of their idea of a southern plantation house, Stone and his wife, Alexandra, demolished the truly historic structure, replacing it with a historicized, yet modern house in 1936. The Stones focused the property's agricultural output toward the 200 acre pecan farming operation of what had been a 700-acre pecan farm, and built an electrical plant that created power from the tides of the nearby rivers to power the plantation. In 1940, the Stones sold the plantation to Georgian prince Dimitri Jorjadze and his wife Audrey Emery Jorjadze, an American socialite. The prince raced thoroughbreds under the nom de course, Boone Hall Stable, with the most notable of his horses being Princequillo, who in 1943 was the fastest distance runner in the United States. The Jorjadzes sold the plantation to Dr. Henry Deas in 1945, who in turn sold to Harris M. McRae and his wife Nancy in 1955. The McRaes continued to farm the land with a focus on growing peach trees, and eventually opened the plantation to public tours in 1956. 21st century Boone Hall is still owned by the McRae family, which has made great efforts to preserve the original structures and gardens. Due to its role in the antebellum south, the site was named one of the African American Historic Places in South Carolina.African American Historic Places in South Carolina Mansion and grounds Architecture The house at Boone Hall Plantation is a modern house, built during the first half of the 20th century when Thomas Stone commissioned architect William Harmon Beers to design a larger, more modern residence to replace the rather modest house on the Boone Hall Plantation. Designed in the Colonial Revival style, the mansion was built under the oversight of builder Cambridge M. Trott in 1936. Built on the gently sloping banks of Horlbeck Creek, the south-facing residence is a two-and-half story building that incorporates materials from the plantation's old farm structures and salvaged historic brick recovered from the Laurel Hill Brickyard. The eight-bay-wide facade is slightly asymmetrical, with its pedimented gable portico at the fourth, fifth and sixth bays. The portico is supported by six massive Tuscan columns, and features a bull's-eye window in the tympanum. On the ground level, the three western bays feature shuttered 9/9 windows, while the two eastern bays are slightly smaller with 6/9 windows. Within the portico are smaller 6/6 windows flanking the paneled entry door with sidelights and fanlight. Second-level window openings are slightly shorter, with a 6/6 sash. An oculus window occupies the space between the second and third bays on the western side of the facade. Above the entry is an iron balcony accessed by French doors. The lateral hipped roof has a medium pitch, with tall brick exterior chimneys at each side elevation. One interior chimney pierces the slate roof. On the northern, rear facade, there is a wing that projects from the eastern half of the house consisting of four bays. The roof is hipped and has two gabled dormers on all three sides of the wing that indicates a finished attic level. There are brick exterior chimneys at the rear and east elevations of the wing, which has 6/9 windows at both levels. There are two further projections from the rear wing. A small one-story brick wing on the north elevation, with hipped roof and exterior chimney, was originally used for farm-related storage. At the rear bay of the east elevation is a one-story, one-by-one bay frame wing, with a slate gable roof and exterior brick chimney attached to the house as an office. This small structure predates the main house, and was relocated, attached and re-sided. Within the ell at the rear of the house, connecting the library at the front of the house with the loggia in the rear wing, is a brick paved terrace enclosed with a serpentine wall. Single and double French doors, with fanlight, in round-arched surrounds access the terrace from the library, while the west wall of the loggia opens to the terrace with a row of three French doors with sidelights and fanlights in round-arched openings. The mansion has an excavated basement with cement slab flooring, and 5'5\\" walls of smooth cement on which the brick exterior walls rest. Brick piers lend additional support to the main structure. Interior As a modern-built, classical revival/Colonial Revival structure, the interior of the historic house echoes design choices made by master builders of the 18th century. The floor plan covers about , with principal rooms located on the ground floor. The foyer has plaster walls with a double cornice at ceiling level, and flooring of teak parquet. A cantilevered winding staircase rises to the second level, lit by a triple-hung arched window with 12-light sash. To the left of the foyer is the library, accessed through a mahogany paneled door, with an arched tympanum and keystone, that matches the exterior entry door. Shallow steps lead down from a landing just inside the room to the floor of wide oak boards. The walls are clad in dark green painted cypress paneling, offset by a white chair rail that flanks a simple fireplace surround, glass-fronted built-in bookshelves, and a cornice with heavy dentil molding. On the north side of the library, are ornate French doors, with a semicircular arch in the Palladian style, that access the terrace. Centered on the east wall of the foyer is an arched opening, with fluted pilasters and keystone, that accesses a short hallway that steps down to the double door entry of the dining room. The dining room features oak flooring and cypress paneling painted red. The modest dentil cornice, fireplace surround and chair rail are painted white, matching the treatment in the library. The dining room connects with the kitchen through a butler's pantry with glass-fronted cabinets, topped by smaller cabinets at the ceiling level that extend completely around the room. The countertops are made of Monel, and the narrow oak flooring continues into the large kitchen designed to facilitate grand-scale entertaining. Accessed through an arched opening on the north wall of the foyer, located under the winding staircase, is the entry into the loggia, adjacent to the west of the kitchen in the rear wing, that leads to the game room at the north end of the rear wing. The enclosed loggia features a low groin-vaulted ceiling of brick and cement stucco, herringbone-laid brick flooring, and centered on a round-arched fireplace surround with a mirrored inset above the mantel. Opposite the fireplace are three double door arched openings to the terrace. The game room has exposed ceiling beams of rough-hewn cypress, cypress paneled walls and salvaged wide heart pine flooring that may have been saved from the prior plantation residence that was demolished so that this house could be built on the same site. The game room also gives access to a small wine cellar located in the basement. The private family quarters (not open for public tours) are found on the second floor and are accessed by a hallway featuring arches with fluted pilasters and keystones. The bedrooms have generally simpler finishes than those found on the ground floor, though the rear bedrooms and the third level finished space are quite plain. Giving access to each floor is an elevator that rises from the basement to the second level. Grounds and Other Significant Structures at the Site The Avenue of OaksBoone Hall Slave Cabin Boone Hall Plantation now spans 738 acres. The landscape is used for growing seasonal crop fields, but also includes preserved wetlands, creeks, and ponds. The most notable feature of the grounds is the grand Avenue of Oaks that was first planted in 1743 and completed by the Horlbeck brothers in 1843. On axis with the front facade of the house, the all√©e consists of 88 live oak trees and one magnolia, that are evenly spaced, and run 3/4 of a mile from the entrance of the plantation to a pair of brick gateposts. The gateposts are topped with ball finals, hung with formal wrought iron gates and along with a brick serpentine wall enclose the forecourt of the house. Open lawns at each side of the entry drive are flanked by formal gardens with brick-paved paths, laid among large live oaks and planted with camellias, azaleas and Noisette roses. Visitors arriving to the house in the 19th century by carriage would have driven through the tunnel of oaks, past the many slave quarters to the left of the road. Their number, but small massing would have stood in stark contrast to the large, master's house at the end of the drive. Such a vista symbolizes the place as a place of work and production, rather than leisure. The original slave cabins date from between 1790 and 1810. Built of brick, the one-story structures are 12 feet by 30 feet with gabled roofs, have either plank or dirt floors and a simple fireplace with a brick hearth and no mantle at the rear of each house. The cabins were in use well into the 20th century, as they were occupied by sharecroppers through the 1940s. These dwellings were continuously occupied by enslaved, then free sharecroppers fo nearly 150 years, making them incredibly significant to the history of the site. On the wide forecourt directly in front of the house are two pergolas, constructed in 1993 as part of the ongoing efforts to enhance the gardens. At the southwest edge of the gardens, within the serpentine wall, is a brick smokehouse dating from 1750. The cylindrical structure has a conical timber roof sheathed in slate. To the southeast of the main house is the large Cotton Gin house built in the 1850s. The machinery to process cotton is no longer found, and has since been used as a guest house, restaurant and gift shop by subsequent owners. Due to damage by Hurricane Hugo, the building is no longer habitable and is awaiting renovation. Boone Hall Plantation, Inc.   Boone Hall Farms  The agricultural operation of Boone Hall Plantation, incorporated filed with South Carolina Secretary of State to do business as Boone Hall Farms.https://businessfilings.sc.gov/BusinessFiling/Entity/Search During the spring and summer, BHF cultivates strawberries, and hosts an annual Low Country Strawberry Festival at the peak of each growing season, when guests pick thousands of pounds of strawberries from the U-Pick fields. The Boone Hall Farms farm-to-table program generates produce including tomatoes, squash, cucumbers, watermelons, sweet corn, and other produce for over 35 Low Country businesses and restaurants. Boone Hall Farms also offers its produce, prepared foods, and fresh seafood and meat at its Roadside Produce Stand located down the road from Boone Hall Plantation.  Importance of the Mansion and Grounds in Plantation Nostalgia  Many historic sites that were formerly plantations and have now opened their doors to the public have failed to grapple with the difficult history of these places. The historical is often transposed with nostalgia, fiction, or romance. At Boone Hall Plantation, this history of the main house hosts the most opportunity for a visitor's confusion. While touring the house at Boone Hall Plantation, tour guides briefly tell visitors that the 1935 house is not original. However, this fact is quickly put aside, as visitors are directed toward modern rooms decorated with antiques purchased at markets and auctions. Rather than exploring the implications of celebrating the complicated history of plantation culture and its presentation for the public, the tours maintain a level of fantasy that emphasize the grandness and opulence of the house. The interpreters of the historic house appear in costume reminiscent of the 19th century. This adds confusion, considering the house was built in the 1930s. According to historian Jessica Adams, some interpreters do not understand the significance of their costumes. One guide admitted that she knew the costume was significant, but she did not know what time period it was from or why it was important, \\"I think it's more Reconstruction Era. . . I don't know. I think I probably should.\\" The most historically significant structures on the Plantation are the brick quarters that housed enslaved workers at the property.https://npgallery.nps.gov/GetAsset/fd9406ee-c172-45c7-a39c-0212a9c7d669/ They have survived in large part because of the durability and quality of the materials they were constructed from. Many structures that house enslaved people were made from wood, and were easily removed from agricultural landscapes when the owner decided they no longer wanted a visual marker of the history of the enslaved on their property. The interpretation of the slave quarters at Boone Hall Plantation is more extensive than that of the main house, and includes many archaeological artifacts uncovered around these houses. The history of the enslaved workers at Boone Hall Plantation are also linked to Gullah culture, interpreted through living history presentations through song and storytelling. The history of the main house is disconnected entirely from the history of the slave quarters, however. While domestic enslaved workers would have cooked, cleaned, and performed many other tasks for the Boone, then Horlbeck families, slavery was illegal in 1935 when the historic house was built. Such limited interpretive exploration may be attributed to the site's lack of a curator, or curatorial staff to do more research and writing for the public's benefit.Harris, Jennifer Allison.Middle Tennessee State University, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2019. 13859358.  2020 Controversy with Plantation Weddings  Many former plantations open to the public allow venue rentals, most specifically for weddings. Boone Hall Plantation offers multiple buildings and locations on the property for these events. However, as publicly pointed out recently by Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively who were married at Boone Hall Plantation in 2012, plantation weddings are controversial.https://www.fastcompany.com/90525283/most-creative- people-2020-ryan-reynolds In fact, wedding sites like the Knot stated they would cease promoting sites like Boone Plantation out of respect for the people who were enslaved at these places. As Reynolds told a Fast Company reporter recently, \\"It‚Äôs impossible to reconcile. What we saw at the time was a wedding venue on Pinterest. What we saw after was a place built upon devastating tragedy. Years ago we got married again at home‚Äîbut shame works in weird ways. A giant fucking mistake like that can either cause you to shut down or it can reframe things and move you into action. It doesn‚Äôt mean you won‚Äôt fuck up again.

Origins According to some legends, he was born in the Katya lineage originating from Vishwamitra, thus called Katyayan. The KathƒÅsaritsƒÅgara mentions Katyayan as another name of Vararuchi, a re-incarnation of Lord Shiva's gana or follower Pushpadanta. The story also mentions him learning grammar from Shiva's son Kartikeya which is corroborated in the Garuda Purana where Kartikeya (also called Kumara) teaches Katyayana the rules of grammar in a way that it could be understood even by children. Relation to Goddess Katyayini In texts like Kalika Purana, it is mentioned that he worshipped Mother Goddess to be born as his daughter hence she came to be known as Katyayani or the \\"daughter of Katyayan\\" who is worshipped on the sixth day of Navratri festival.Forms of Durga. According to the Vamana Purana once the gods had gathered together to discuss the atrocities of the demon Mahishasura and their anger manifested itself in the form of energy rays. The rays crystallized in the hermitage of KƒÅtyƒÅyana Rishi, who gave it proper form therefore she is also called Katyayani. Works He is known for two works: * The VƒÅrttikakƒÅra, an elaboration on PƒÅ·πáini grammar. Along with the MahƒÅbhƒÅ·π£ya of Pata√±jali, this text became a core part of the VyƒÅkara·πáa (grammar) canon. This was one of the six Vedangas, and constituted compulsory education for students in the following twelve centuries. * He also composed one of the later ≈öulbas≈´tras, a series of nine texts on the geometry of altar constructions, dealing with rectangles, right-sided triangles, rhombuses, etc.Joseph (2000), p. 328 Views KƒÅtyƒÅyana's views on the sentence-meaning connection tended towards naturalism. KƒÅtyƒÅyana believed, that the word- meaning relationship was not a result of human convention. For KƒÅtyƒÅyana, word-meaning relations were siddha, given to us, eternal. Though the object a word is referring to is non-eternal, the substance of its meaning, like a lump of gold used to make different ornaments, remains undistorted, and is therefore permanent. Realizing that each word represented a categorization, he came up with the following conundrum (following Bimal Krishna Matilal): :\\"If the 'basis' for the use of the word 'cow' is cowhood (a universal) what would be the 'basis' for the use of the word 'cowhood'? Clearly, this leads to infinite regress. KƒÅtyƒÅyana's solution to this was to restrict the universal category to that of the word itself -- the basis for the use of any word is to be the very same word-universal itself.\\" This view may have been the nucleus of the Spho·π≠a doctrine enunciated by Bhart·πõhari in the 5th century, in which he elaborates the word-universal as the superposition of two structures -- the meaning-universal or the semantic structure (artha-jƒÅti) is superposed on the sound-universal or the phonological structure (≈õabda-jƒÅti). In the tradition of scholars like Pingala, KƒÅtyƒÅyana was also interested in mathematics. Here his text on the sulvasutras dealt with geometry, and extended the treatment of the Pythagorean theorem as first presented in 800 BCE by Baudhayana.Pingree (1981), p. 6 KƒÅtyƒÅyana belonged to the Aindra School of Grammar and may have lived towards the Punjab region of the Indian Subcontinent.

As of 2016, it has an enrollment of 1,684 students in grades nine through twelve. The school, governed by the Fayette County School System, was named a Georgia School of Excellence in 2001. In 2007, it was named a National Blue Ribbon School of Excellence. History McIntosh High School was opened on January 18th, 1981 to serve the growing community of Peachtree City. Before this, all county residents went to Fayette County High School. At the time, the building was still under construction, though deemed sufficient to serve the truncated 2nd Semester of the 1981-1982 school year. The following year, the school was finally able to open a full school year on its campus. More additions came a few years latter during the 1985-1986 school semester. The math and science wing was added to the east side of campus. Some years later the Black Box theater was built next to the construction education classroom during the 1994-1995 school year. The opening of Starr's Mill High School in 1997 helped alleviate the rapid population growth of Peachtree City. Shortly before the 2004-2005 school year the automotive education program was dropped and the black box theater was converted into the new band room. A new gym was constructed and the former converted into a new auditorium. Awards It was named a 2007 National Blue Ribbon School by the U.S. Department of Education for having scored in the top 10% of all schools nationwide in student achievement. The school placed on Georgia's 2007 Top 25 SAT List for having the 15th highest SAT score in the state. It received Georgia's 2007 and 2011 Platinum Award in the highest performance category for outstanding student achievement; it was one of seven high schools in the state to receive this honor. It was named a Georgia School of Excellence in 1987, 2001, 2008, and 2012. It was recognized by the college board as an AP Merit, AP STEM, and AP STEM Achievement School. It received the Director's Cup Distinction for Athletics in 2013, and Director's Cup for Girls' Athletics in 2013 and 2014.

Both soccer teams have won the state championship in the same season four times (1992, 2000, 2014, and 2017). The varsity boys' soccer team was named national champions in 2013 and 2014 and went unbeaten through those two seasons. The newly added lacrosse program was state runner-up in 2008. Not only has the lacrosse program found success in post season games, they have also been division champs every year since its creation. McIntosh had the highest SAT scores in Fayette County for 2005. In 2008, McIntosh's ACT scores were reported as the highest in Fayette County and the third highest in the state of Georgia.

Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, California, since 1972. The painting relates the Victorian custom of children collecting flowers on May Day back to an Ancient Roman spring festival, perhaps Cerealia or Floralia or Ambarvalia, although the details depicted in the painting do not correspond to any single Roman festival. It was the inspiration for the scene of Julius Caesar's triumphal entry into Rome in the 1934 film Cleopatra. Description The tall narrow painting depicts a procession of women and children along a Roman street and down some marble steps. Spectators cheer from the classical buildings of polychrome marble to either side, some throwing down flowers. The participants in the procession are garlanded with bright flowers, with some also bearing baskets of flowers or branches of blossom, and other playing musical instruments: a flute, pan pipes, and tambourines. The choice of flowers in the painting seems to be driven more by aesthetic and colour considerations than the symbolic meanings of the Victorian language of flowers. Detail of musicians and procession Towards the rear of the procession is a bearded priest holding a metal jug, with other attendants carrying a casket, a torch, and a large portable ivory altar which is emerging from the building to the right. Other attendants bear two silver sculptures of a horned satyr with a child and fruit, and two more hold poles with a banner slung between, bearing a Latin fragment (then attributed to Catullus, known as Carmina Catulli 8): \\"Hunc lucum tibi dedico consecroque, Priape / qua domus tua Lampsacist quaque silva, Priape/ nam te praecipue in suis urbibus colit ora / Hellespontia ceteris ostreosior oris\\" (loosely translated: \\"This enclosure I dedicate and consecrate to thee, Priapus / At Lampsacus where is thy home and sacred grove, Priapus / For thee specially in its coastal cities are you worshipped / Of Hellespont more abundant in oysters than all other coasts\\"). Many of the participants and spectators were modelled by Alma-Tadema's friends or members of his family.Swanson, Alma-Tadema, p. 130 They include the bearded composer George Henschel and his daughter Helen, high on a balcony to the right. A bearded bust to the lower left may be a self- portrait of Alma-Tadema, beside the base of a column where the painting is signed and numbered: \\" L Alma Tadema Op CCCXXVI\\". The surrounding scene is an architectural capriccio, not a single known location but rather combining parts of known Roman buildings from several different locations=. To the left rear is a triumphal arch, with an inscription taken from the Arch of Trajan at Benevento, southeast of Rome; its spandrel is decorated with a river god based on the Arch of Constantine, but unusually accompanied by a sheep and bull (for Aries and Taurus, denoting April and May). A building to the left has a frieze showing the battle of Lapiths and Centaurs. Visible to the rear are two bronze equestrian statues, based on marble statues from Pompeii. The painting measures and retains its original, heavy gilded architectural frame, also designed by the artist, with pilasters and a triangular pediment. The frame above the painting displays its title, \\"Spring\\", and the bottom of the frame has four lines of poetry from Algernon Charles Swinburne's 1865 poem \\"Dedication\\" written in honour of the painter Edward Burne-Jones: \\"In a land of clear colours and stories, / In a region of shadowless hours, / Where earth has a garment of glories / And a murmur of musical flowers\\". Reception Alma-Tadema worked on the painting for four years. It was completed in late 1894, and bought by the German banker . It was exhibited at the 1895 Royal Academy Summer Exhibition, at the 1899 in Berlin, and at the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris. It was a commercial success for Alma-Tadema, who sold many reproductions. The original painting was sold through Thomas Agnew & Sons in London, and acquired by Charles Yerkes in 1901. After his death in 1910, it was sold at the American Art Association, and then bought in 1912 from the dealer Henry Reinhardt Galleries in Chicago by Thomas F. Cole. It was exhibited at the inaugural exhibition at the new building of the Toledo Museum of Art in 1912, and later acquired by Edwin H. Fricke. It was the inspiration for the scene of Julius Caesar's triumphal entry into Rome in Cecil B. DeMille's 1934 film Cleopatra. Along with other works from Fricke's collection, including Alma-Tadema's 1906 painting Ask Me No More, it was sold at Parke-Bernet in New York in 1945. It was acquired through Lewis A. Stone by Mrs. Edward Lane, and sold the same year to Hulett C. Merritt, in Pasadena. It was bought from his estate sale at Ames Art Galleries in 1956 by Victor Emmanuel Wenzel von Metternich, and acquired from his estate sale at Sotheby's in Los Angeles in 1972 by the J. Paul Getty Museum.

But the plan for Sea Ranch eventually grew to encompass of the Sonoma County coastline that would have been reserved for private use.

The Commission is composed of 12 voting members, 6 chosen from the general public, and 6 appointed elected officials. The panelists are not paid salary nor stipend for their work, however being on the Commission can carry responsibilities which are highly politicized. Accounting for 164 percent inflation, the commission's total funding declined 26 percent from $22.1 million in 1980 ($13.5 million in then-current dollars) to $16.3 million in 2010. The commission's full-time staff fell from 212 in 1980 to 125 in 2010. There are 11 enforcement officers to investigate violations along the of coastline. Development Development activities are broadly defined by the Coastal Act to include (among others) construction of buildings, divisions of land, and activities that change the intensity of use of land or public access to coastal waters. Development usually requires a Coastal Development Permit from either the Coastal Commission or the local government if such development would occur within the Coastal Zone. The Coastal Zone is specifically defined by law as an area that extends from the State's seaward boundary of jurisdiction, and inland for a distance from the Mean High Tide Line of between a couple of hundred feet in urban areas, to up to five miles in rural areas.Coastal Act Section 30103. Coastal.ca.gov. State Route 1 is prohibited from being widened beyond one lane in each direction within rural areas inside the Coastal Zone, per Public Resources Code section 30254. Local coastal programs The Commission is the primary agency which issues Coastal Development Permits. However, once a local agency (a County, City, or Port) has a Local Coastal Program (LCP) which has been certified by the Commission, that agency takes over the responsibility for issuing Coastal Development Permits. For areas with Certified LCP's, the Commission does not issue Coastal Development permits (except in certain areas where the Commission retains jurisdiction, i.e. public trust lands), and is instead responsible for reviewing amendments to a local agency's LCP, or reviewing Coastal Development Permits issued by local agencies which have been appealed to the Commission. A Local Coastal Program is composed of a Land Use Plan (LUP) and an Implementation Plan (IP). A Land Use Plan details the Land Uses which are permissible in each part of the local government's area, and specifies the general policies which apply to each Land Use. The Land Use can be a part of a local government's general plan. The Implementation Plan is responsible for implementing the policies contained in the Land Use Plan. The Implementation Plan is generally a part of the City's Zoning code. The Role of Local Governments. Coastal.ca.gov. 2011. Retrieved 10-05-2011.  Enforcement Authority  The agency has sought enforcement through the courts as it originally did not have the power to issue fines on its own to alleged violators. A bill in the California legislature to grant the commission a broad power to issue fines was defeated in September 2013. However legislation attached to the state budget in the summer of 2014 finally granted the authority to impose fines on violators of public-access which could apply to about a third of the backlog of over 2,000 unresolved enforcement cases.Barboza, Tony (June 30, 2014) \\"Blocking Californians' beach access will soon carry a hefty fine\\" Los Angeles TimesMoore, Duncan Joseph; Roy, Jennifer; Stromberg, Winston (August 25, 2014) \\"California Coastal Commission Further Solidifies Enforcement Powers\\" Latham and Watkins The first notable fines were issued in December 2016 against Malibu property owners Dr. Warren M. Lent and his wife, for 4.2 million dollars, and Simon and Daniel Mani, owners of the Malibu Beach Inn, who settled amicably for $925,000. The difference in severity of the fines were attributed to the \\"egregious\\" nature of the Lent case.  Legal issues  The Supreme Court of the United States ruled in the 1987 case of Nollan v. California Coastal Commission that a requirement by the agency was a taking in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The Coastal Commission had required that a lateral public easement along the Nollans' beachfront lot be dedicated to facilitate pedestrian access to public beaches as a condition of approval of a permit to demolish an existing bungalow and replace it with a three-bedroom house. The Coastal Commission had asserted that the public-easement condition was imposed to promote the legitimate state interest of diminishing the \\"blockage of the view of the ocean\\" caused by construction of the larger house. The court, in a narrow decision, ruled that an \\"essential nexus\\" must exist between the legitimate state interest and the permit condition imposed by government. The Ritz- Carlton Hotel in Half Moon Bay was ordered to pay $1.6 million in penalties for failing to provide public access to its nearby beaches in 2019.

It is the third-brightest star in this not-very-prominent circumpolar constellation, the first and second-brightest stars being Œ≤ Camelopardalis and CS Camelopardalis, respectively. It is the farthest constellational star, with a distance of 6,000 light-years from Earth. Description Alpha Camelopardalis has a stellar classification of O9 Ia, with the 'Ia' indicating that it is an O-type luminous supergiant. It is a massive star with 31 times the mass of the Sun and 37 times the Sun's radius. The effective temperature of the outer envelope is 30,000 K; much hotter than the Sun's effective temperature of 5,778 K, giving it the characteristic blue hue of an O-type star. It is emitting 620,000 times the luminosity of the Sun and is a weak X-ray emitter. Variations in the profiles of Alpha Camelopardalis' spectral lines are caused by fluctuations in the photosphere and stellar wind. This may be caused by non-radial pulsations. The absorption lines in the optical spectrum show radial velocity variations, although there is significant uncertainty about the period. Estimates range from a period as low as 0.36 days up to 2.93 days. The stellar wind from this star is not smooth and continuous, but instead shows a behavior indicating clumping at both large and small scales. This star is losing mass rapidly through its stellar wind at a rate of approximately 6.3 √ó 10‚àí6 solar masses per year, or the equivalent of the mass of the Sun every 160,000 years. In 1968, this star was classified as a spectroscopic binary, indicating that it has an orbiting stellar companion with a period of 3.68 days and an orbital eccentricity of 0.45. Subsequent studies refined the period to 3.24 days. However, in 2006 it was recognized that the changes in the spectrum were probably the result of changes in the atmosphere or stellar wind, so it is more likely a single star. Speckle interferometry observations with the 3.67 m Advanced Electro Optical System Telescope at the Haleakala Observatory failed to detect a secondary component. In 1961, based on the criteria that the proper motion of this star indicates a space velocity of greater than 30 km/s, Alpha Camelopardalis was suggested as a candidate runaway star that had been ejected from the cluster NGC 1502. This was based upon the kinematic properties of the star and cluster, as well as the location of this star at a high galactic latitude in an area otherwise lacking in stellar associations. Over the course of a million years, this star should have moved only 1.4¬∞ across the sky, while it was estimated as being only two million years old. Runaway stars such as this with a stellar wind that is moving at supersonic velocity through the interstellar medium have their wind confined by a bow shock due to ram pressure. The dust in this bow shock can be detected using an infrared telescope. Just such a bow shock was observed with NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, or WISE. The star is traveling at a rate of somewhere between 680 and 4,200 kilometers per second: between 1.5 and 9.4 million mph.

In effect, it was a highly sensitive thermoresistor, which could recover amplitude-modulated signals, something that the coherer (the standard detector of the time) could not do.Tapan K. Sarkar, Robert Mailloux, Arthur A. Oliner, Magdalena Salazar-Palma, Dipak L. Sengupta, \\"History of Wireless\\", , January 2006, Wiley-IEEE Press, page 369. The first device used to demodulate audio signals, it was later superseded by the electrolytic detector, also generally attributed to Fessenden. The barretter principle is still used as a detector for microwave radiation, similar to a bolometer. Description and construction Fessenden's 1902 patent describes the construction of the device. A fine platinum wire, about in diameter, is embedded in the middle of a silver tube having a diameter of about . This compound wire is then drawn until the silver wire has a diameter of about ; as the platinum wire within it is reduced in the same ratio, it is drawn down to a final diameter of . The result is called Wollaston wire. The silver cladding is etched off a short piece of the composite wire, leaving an extremely fine platinum wire; this is supported, on two heavier silver wires, in a loop inside a glass bulb. The leads are taken out through the glass envelope, and the whole device is put under vacuum and then sealed.  Operation  The hot-wire barretter depends upon the increase of a metal resistivity with increasing temperature. The device is biased by a direct current adjusted to heat the wire to its most sensitive temperature. When there is an oscillating current from the antenna through the extremely fine platinum wire loop, the wire is further heated as the current increases and cools as the current decreases again. As the wire heats and cools, it varies its resistance in response to the signals passing through it. Because of the low thermal mass of the wire, it is capable of responding quickly enough to vary its resistance in response to audio signals. However, it cannot vary its resistance fast enough to respond to the much higher radio frequencies. The radio frequencies are essentially removed, and the sound is demodulated because the current through the circuit varies with the changing wire resistance. Headphones are connected in series with the DC circuit, and the variations in the current are rendered as sound.

The origin of the expression, especially in its evolved use as an imaginary marker in the landscape, is contested. The various claims are discussed below. The term \\"Black stump\\" was used as land markers on a surveyors plan and was first referred to as a boundary marker in a New South Wales court case involving a land law dispute. See R v West [1831] NSWSupC 66 (12 October 1831). The case refers to vacant land at Woolloomooloo where a surveyor had difficulty in ascertaining the boundaries as he could not find a plan from the days of Governor Lachlan Macquarie. In the case it stated, \\"...and he pointed to some old stumps, which he said had been marked...defendant would not admit that the cross line marked by me on the plan was not part of his boundary...he said it ran to a black stump beyond the line, which he said had been marked...; he said the line was to run somewhere thereabouts; utmost extent claimed by defendant was the black stump of which I have spoken...made no claims beyond South Head road...\\" One theory states that the expression derives from the use of black stumps in the landscape as markers when directing travellers. Other explanations relate to historical events associated with places or geographical features with names incorporating the phrase \\"black stump\\". At least three regional Australian towns claim the expression originated in their general vicinity. Vernacular formulations The term 'black stump' is used in various formulations. The most common are: *‚Äòbeyond the black stump‚Äô or ‚Äòback of the black stump‚Äô : in the outback; remote from civilisation. :: The following quote from John Wynnum‚Äôs I‚Äôm a Jack, all Right (1967; p. 18) conveys this meaning: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs way back o‚Äô Bourke. Beyond the Black Stump. Not shown on the petrol station maps, even.‚Äù In 1956 British novelist Neville Shute published \\"Beyond the Black Stump\\", a novel set in the 1940/50s, contrasting the social mores of a still remote Western Australian sheep station and a small town in Oregon, USA, which still thought of itself as a frontier town despite the Cadillac dealership and the fast food joint *‚Äòthis side of the black stump‚Äô : in the world known to the speaker; anywhere in the general community. :: The following is from Vision Splendid by Tom Ronan (1954; p. 264): ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre looking... at the best bloody station bookkeeper this side of the black stump.‚ÄùRamson, W.S. (ed.), The Australian National Dictionary: A Dictionary of Australianisms on Historical Principals, Oxford University Press, 1988, p. 62. Another use of the phrase ‚Äòblack stump‚Äô in the Australian vernacular, which relates more to the real object than an abstract concept of landscape, is the local term for the old State Office Block in Sydney (now demolished). The high-rise building was dark-grey in colour and Sydney residents ‚Äì ‚Äúwith the local talent for belittling anything that embarrassed them with its pretensions‚Äù ‚Äì dubbed it ‚Äòthe Black Stump‚Äô.Ramson op. cit.; quote from Helga‚Äôs Web by John Cleary (1970; p. 263). The same name has been applied to the Grenfell Centre, briefly the highest building in Adelaide. Etymology The most prosaic explanation for the origin of ‚Äòblack stump‚Äô derives from the general use of fire-blackened tree-stumps as markers when giving directions to travellers unfamiliar with the terrain. An early use of the phrase from the Sydney journal Bulletin (31 March 1900, p. 31) seems to lend support to this explanation: ‚ÄúA rigmarole of details concerning the turns and hollows, the big tree, the dog-leg fence, and the black stump‚Äù. Robbery Under Arms, a fictionalised work by Rolf Boldrewood first published in 1888, refers to the Black Stump as an actual place \\"within a reasonable distance of Bathurst\\" and known to everybody for miles around. Boldrewood says it \\"had been a tremendous old Ironbark tree- nobody knew how old, but it had had its top blown off in a thunderstorm, and the carriers had lighted so many fires against the roots of it that it had been killed at last, and the sides were as black as a steamer's funnel.\\" Raffaello Carboni used the phrase 'black-stump' in his account of the Eureka Stockade uprising which he wrote in 1855, probably referring to a well-worn pipe: \\"Please, give me a dozen puffs at my black-stump, and then I will proceed to the next chapter\\".Eureka Stockade, original account by Raffaello Carboni (first published 1 December 1855), Dolphin Press, 1947, p. 41; . There appears to be no obvious link between the use of the phrase by Carboni and the expression being used as an imaginary marker in the landscape. The evolution of meaning of the phrase 'black stump', from the real to an imaginary marker of landscape, probably occurred during the nineteenth century. There is a widespread belief that the expression took root amongst carriers or teamsters that operated in the regional districts of Australia. Carriers were an integral part of the rural economy during the nineteenth century; they transported wool and supplies by drays drawn by horse- or bullock-teams, travelling constantly across the landscape servicing stations and settlements distant from regional transport hubs and urban centres. If the use of the expression 'black stump' entered the Australian vernacular in the nineteenth century, it rarely appeared in Australian literature or newspaper reports until the twentieth century. At least three towns in regional Australia claim to be home to the 'black stump': Coolah, NSW; Merriwagga and Gunbar in NSW; and Blackall in Queensland. Coolah, NSW alt= The area just north of present-day Coolah was known by local Aborigines as 'Weetalibah-Wallangan', apparently meaning \\"place where the fire went out and left a burnt stump\\". In an attempt to control the settlement patterns of the colony of New South Wales Governor Darling issued regulations in 1829 limiting settlement in the colony to land within the Nineteen Counties surrounding Sydney. The regulations defined the \\"limits of location\\", and it is claimed this boundary passed \\"along the approximate location of the Black Stump Run\\" (located just north- west of present-day Coolah). Land to the north of this part of Governor Darling's boundary (it is asserted) began to be described as \\"beyond the Black Stump\\". This raises the question: had the Black Stump Run been taken up by 1829 (or at least by the mid-1830s)? Darling‚Äôs ‚Äúlimits of location‚Äù was a short-lived concept; in 1836 Governor Bourke allowed individuals occupying lands beyond the Nineteen Counties to obtain annual licenses to legitimise their activities and the \\"limits of location\\" became officially irrelevant. In a list of persons who obtained licences to depasture stock beyond the limits of location in the district of Bligh for the year ending 30 June 1847 appears the entry \\"Launt Joseph ... The Black Stump\\".New South Wales Government Gazette, 28 May 1847 (No.47), page 573 Archival research may produce earlier references. In May 1851 a notice was published by James M‚ÄôCubbin of Coolah, warning against trespassing by cattle or persons on his run ‚ÄúTHE BLACK STUMP‚Äù in the district of Bligh. Maitland Mercury and Hunter River General Advertiser, 21 May 1851, p.1 By 1885, the Black Stump run had been consolidated with the Queensborough run into the Queensborough Pastoral Holding of some 46,000 acres. William Hanson, The Pastoral Possessions of New South Wales, Gibbs, Shallard & Co, 1889, p. 334 The name lived on in local usage, and there are currently three place names in the vicinity of the original run approved by the Geographical Names Board of New South Wales, i.e. Black Stump Graveyard/Cemetery, Black Stump Creek and Black Stump Resting Place. Apparently a teamster named John Higgins took up land in the vicinity of the Black Stump Run (possibly in the early 1860s when Robertson's Land Bills allowed land selection to occur). Higgins built an inn in the 1860s which he called The Black Stump Inn, located at the junction of roads leading to Gunnedah and Coonabarabran. The inn later became the Black Stump Wine Saloon and was destroyed by fire in 1908.The Black Stump (Coolah) retrieved 28 November 2006. It has been suggested that the saloon was an important staging post for traffic to north-west New South Wales and it became a marker by which people gauged their journeys. Merriwagga / Gunbar, NSW Black stump monument at Merriwagga The village of Merriwagga and nearby community of Gunbar, in the Riverina district of New South Wales, have strong claims to the origin of the expression 'black stump'. Gunbar cemetery is the burial-place of Mrs. Barbara Blain, the woman whose accidental death in March 1886 possibly gave rise to the term. Barbara Blain's husband, James, was a carrier or teamster, based at Hay. In March 1886 James and Barbara Blain, in company with other carriers, stopped to camp at a pine ridge on \\"Gunbar\\" station. James and the other men left to load posts onto their drays and Barbara began preparations for the evening meal. When they returned, the men found Mrs. Blain had been fatally burnt, probably after her dress had caught alight from the flames of the camp-fire. Barbara Blain was buried at nearby Gunbar cemetery and an inquest into her death was subsequently held. James Blain apparently stated that when he found his wife she \\"looked like a black stump\\" (possibly as part of his evidence at the inquest). A watering place near where the tragedy occurred ‚Äì roughly halfway between Gunbar and the village of Merriwagga ‚Äì became known as Black Stump Tank.Death registration ‚Äì Barbara Blain (Hay 1886); Riverine Grazier (newspaper), 20 March 1886; Black Stump memorial inscription, Merriwagga, NSW; Register of Inquests by Coroners and Magistrates in New South Wales. The Black Stump Picnic area at Merriwagga has a waggon and memorial stone (), with an inscription which explains the details of these events. Blackall, Queensland Reconstruction of the Black Stump (the original was burned down), Blackall, 2019 The town of Blackall, Queensland makes the following claim to the origin of the expression. In 1887 a group of surveyors arrived in Blackall (near the centre of Queensland, over 1,000 kilometres west of Brisbane) and established an Astro Station on this site to conduct survey readings to establish a principal meridional circuit traverse around the town. Stumps and other suitable stable platforms were often used rather than a set of legs because they gave more stability to the heavy theodolites then used to take longitudinal and latitudinal observations. This Astro station was used as part of the survey to fix the position of principal towns extending from Brisbane to Boulia via Roma, Charleville and Blackall and enabled the mapping of Queensland on a more accurate basis. It was considered at the time that country to the west of Blackall was beyond the 'black stump'.Blackall Shire Council retrieved 24 November 2006. A stump of petrified wood which marks the location of the original Astro Station is found at the monument in Thistle Street () near Blackall State School. This petrified stump replaces the original blackened timber stump destroyed by fire.Blackall State School retrieved 24 November 2006 Modern culture 'Beyond the Black Stump' is a syndicated cartoon strip, featuring Australian native animals as characters. It is published in papers across Australia including The Courier-Mail in Brisbane, Queensland. See their web site for more information (including some strips and characters). The Black Stump Music and Arts Festival was a four-day Christian festival that is held in the Greater Sydney Metropolitan region over the Labour Day long weekend, often the first weekend in October, from 1985 to 2014. In Adelaide, the Grenfell Centre, the city's tallest building during the 1970s, is nicknamed \\"the black stump\\".

It is part of the system of family branching that establishes a multiplied structure to create familial relationships. The head of a household and his successor reside in the honke, while collateral branches establish bunke. The genealogical relationship between honke and bunke is determined by the ie family system. The honke establishes the new branch family while bunke is linked to it since both are part of the ie. They can be described in terms of vertical relationships where the branch is subordinated to the main household. This system also determines how the access to resources is ordered. Ninigi-no-Mikoto is the honke of the first Japanese imperial household. The honke-bunke relationship can be demonstrated in the case of the imperial household, which descended from its founder Amaterasu-omikami. Her grandson Ninigi-no-Mikoto is the honke while the other branches of the family or those distantly related members of the household are the bunke through the branching of the ie. The honke‚Äìbunke relationship is also reflected in the relationship between Japanese companies and their subsidiaries. In the 1700s, businesses ran by families followed rules that contained details on mutual relationships between the honke as the main line and the bunke or the branch lines.

It tells the tale of the \\"eighth\\" voyage of Sinbad, wherein he discovers the lost treasure of Alexander the Great. Plot Fairbanks with Maureen O'Hara in the trailer for the film. ::\\"O Masters, O Noble Persons, O Brothers, know you that in the time of the Caliph Harun-Al- Rashid, there lived on the golden shore of Persia a man of adventure called Sinbad the Sailor. Strange and wondrous were the tales told of him and his voyages. But who, shall we surmise, gave him his immortality? Who, more than all other sons of Allah, spread glory to the name of Sinbad? Who else, O Brother, but - Sinbad the Sailor! Know me, O Brothers, for the truth of my words, and by the ears of the Prophet, every word I have spoken is truth!\\" :::- from the opening title card The story begins with Sinbad (Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.) regaling a group of travelers around a night-time campfire. When his listeners become bored with his often repeated tales, Sinbad tells them about his \\"eighth\\" voyage. With his friend, Abbu (George Tobias), Sinbad salvages a ship whose crew has been poisoned. On board, he finds a map to the lost treasure of Alexander the Great on the fabled island of Deryabar. However, when he sails to Basra, the ship is confiscated by the local Khan, to be sold at auction. Sinbad obtains an agreement that he may keep the ship if there are no bids. He scares away all the bidders with not-so-subtle comments about the ship being cursed. At the last moment, one bidder appears, a veiled woman borne by four servants. She is Shireen (O'Hara), part of the harem of the powerful Emir of Daibul (Anthony Quinn). Sinbad bids against her and ends up owing a huge sum he cannot pay. He steals the auctioneer's own money to pay for the ship. Visiting Shireen that night in her garden, Sinbad learns of a mysterious and deadly person known as Jamal, who will stop at nothing to acquire the treasure. Jamal, only vaguely seen behind a curtain, makes an attempt on Sinbad's life. Sinbad escapes and steals the ship, acquiring a rough crew to man it. Strange stories of the evil Jamel circulate among the crew, but no one alive has ever seen him. After several days, Sinbad sails to another port and goes, risking death, to visit Shireen in the harem. He is captured, but because the Emir believes him to be the Prince of Deryabar, he becomes his \\"guest\\". With his smooth words and some trickery, Sinbad once again escapes, taking Shireen with him. They set sail for Daryabar, but are overtaken and captured by the Emir. It is then revealed that Sinbad's ship's barber, Abdul Melik (Walter Slezak) is none other than Jamal, who has memorized (and then destroyed) the map to Deryabar. Forming an uneasy alliance of convenience, they sail to the treasure island. They convince the lone resident of the ruins of Alexander's palace, the aged Aga (Alan Napier), that Sinbad is his lost son, owing to a medallion Sinbad had since childhood. When the Emir threatens to kill Sinbad, Sinbad confesses his true identity. Nevertheless, Aga capitulates and shows them the fabulous treasure's hiding place. He later informs Sinbad that he had given his son to sailors to shield him from treasure hunters; Sinbad is indeed his son and the true Prince of Daryabar. When it is discovered that Jamal had intended to poison the Emir and his crew to have the treasure to himself, the Emir forces him to drink the deadly liquid himself. Sinbad escapes again, boards the Emir's ship and frees his crew. The Emir is killed by Greek fire catapulted at him from his own ship. The disbelieving listeners around the campfire accuse Sinbad of telling yet another tall tale, but soon change their minds when he distributes precious jewels and gold. The beautiful Shireen appears and they board the ship for their return to Deryabar as Sinbad relates the moral of the tale, that true happiness is found in things other than material wealth.

Kazimierza Wielka is located in Lesser Poland Upland and historically belongs to the province of Lesser Poland. For most of its history, it was a village, and did not receive its town charter until 1959. The first mention of the village dates from 1320 during the reign of Wladyslaw Lokietek. At that time, its name was spelled Cazimiria and it belonged to the Kazimierski family. In the Kingdom of Poland, Kazimierza Wielka was located on the border of two Lesser Poland voivodeships - Sandomierz Voivodeship and Krakow Voivodeship. The village itself belonged to Proszowice County of Krak√≥w Voivodeship, while neighboring Kazimierza Mala belonged to Wislica County of Sandomierz Voivodeship. In the 1560s, Kazimierza Wielka was one of centers of the Polish Brethren. At the end of the 18th century the estate was the property of the magnate ≈Åubie≈Ñski family.

In it Mises expounds on his theory of the origins of money through his regression theorem, which is based on logical argumentation. It is one of the foundational works of the Misean branch of the Austrian School of economic thought. Commodity money exists today. Mises looks at the origin, nature and value of money, and its effect on determining monetary policy. It does not concern all adaptations of money. He uses the so- called regression theorem, a statement backed by a step by step, logical reasoning. Mises explains why money is demanded in its own right. According to Mises, money has historically come about after there has been a demand for the money commodity in a barter economy. Applications Along with Carl Menger's Principles of Economics, and Eugen von B√∂hm-Bawerk's Capital and Interest, the book is one of the foundational works of the Austrian School.

He is noted for his studies of cave art in the Somme and Dordogne valleys as well as in Spain, Portugal, Italy, Ireland, China with Teilhard de Chardin, Ethiopia, British Somali Coast Protectorate, and especially Southern Africa.  Life  Breuil was born at Mortain, Manche, France, and was the son of Albert Breuil, magistrate, and Lucie Morio De L'Isle. He received his education at the Seminary of St. Sulpice and the Sorbonne and was ordained in 1900 but was given permission to pursue his research interests. He was a man of deep religious faith and learning. In 1904 Breuil had recognised that a pair of 13,000-year-old carvings of reindeer at the British Museum were in fact one composition.The swimming reindeer; a masterpiece of Ice Age art, Jill Cook, bradshawfoundation.com, accessed 2 August 2010 He assumed a post as lecturer at the University of Fribourg in 1905, and in 1910 became professor of prehistoric ethnology in Paris and at the Coll√®ge de France from 1925.Standard Encyclopaedia of Southern Africa Polychrome cave painting of a wolf, Font-de-Gaume Scraper ‚Äì Aurignacian ‚Äì Mus√©um de Toulouse Cave paintings Breuil was a competent draughtsman, faithfully reproducing the cave paintings he encountered. In 1924 he was awarded the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the National Academy of Sciences. He published many books and monographs, introducing the caves of Lascaux and Altamira to the general public and becoming a member of the Institut de France in 1938. Breuil visited the Peking Man excavations at Zhoukoudian, China in 1931 and confirmed the presence of stone tools at the site. Aurochs, horses, and deer at Lascaux A modern interpretation of a bison from the Altamira cave ceiling, one of the cave's most famous paintings In 1929, when already a recognised authority on North African and European Stone Age art, he attended a congress on prehistory in South Africa. At the invitation of prime minister Jan Smuts he returned there in 1942 and took up a chair at Witwatersrand University from 1944 to 1951. During his South African stay he studied rock art in Lesotho, the eastern Free State and in the Natal Drakensberg. He undertook three expeditions to South West Africa and Rhodesia between 1947 and 1950. He described this period as \\"the most thrilling years of my research life\\". He had excursions to South West Africa and Bechuanaland with a local Archeologist Kosie Marais. In 1953 he announced his discovery of a painting about 6 000 years old, subsequently dubbed The White Lady, under a rock overhang in the Brandberg Mountain. Breuil returned to France in 1952 and produced a series of publications sponsored by the South African Government. Breuil's books contain valuable photographs and sketches of the art works at the sites he visited but are marred by official South African racism. Breuil developed elaborate scenarios to attribute \\"white\\" authorship to the paintings he studied. For example, he had a theory that the beautiful painting known as \\"The White Lady of the Brandberg\\" had been painted by Egyptians (or some other Mediterranean people), who had improbably made their way thousands of miles southwest into the wilds of Namibia, rather than accepting the logical and fairly obvious fact that the paintings were the product of (and clearly represent the lifestyle of) the Bushmen and other native peoples of Namibia and South Africa. His contributions to European and African archaeology were considerable and recognised by the award of honorary doctorates from no fewer than six universities. He died at L'Isle-Adam, Val-d'Oise, France.  Published works  His works in English include: * Rock Paintings of Southern Andalusia: A Description of a Neolithic and Copper Age Art Group (with M.C.

It was patented in 1981 and approved for medical use in 1993. It is marketed by Abbott Laboratories under the brand name Mavik.  Side effects  Side effects reported for trandolapril include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, dry cough, dizziness or lightheadedness when sitting up or standing, hypotension, or fatigue.  Possible drug interactions  Patients also on diuretics may experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with trandolapril. It can reduce potassium loss caused by thiazide diuretics, and increase serum potassium when used alone. Therefore, hyperkalemia is a possible risk. Increased serum lithium levels can occur in patients who are also on lithium.  Contraindications and precautions  :  Pregnancy and lactation Trandolapril is teratogenic (US: pregnancy category D) and can cause birth defects and even death of the developing fetus. The highest risk to the fetus is during the second and third trimesters. When pregnancy is detected, trandolapril should be discontinued as soon as possible. Trandolapril should not be administered to nursing mothers. Additional effects Combination therapy with paricalcitol and trandolapril has been found to reduce fibrosis in obstructive uropathy.  Pharmacology  Trandolaprilat ‚Äî the active metabolite of trandolapril Trandolapril is a prodrug that is de-esterified to trandolaprilat. It is believed to exert its antihypertensive effect through the renin‚Äìangiotensin‚Äìaldosterone system. Trandolapril has a half-life of about 6 hours, and trandolaprilat has a half life of about 10 h. Trandolaprilat has about eight times the activity of its parent drug. About one-third of trandolapril and its metabolites are excreted in the urine, and about two-thirds of trandolapril and its metabolites are excreted in the feces. Serum protein binding of trandolapril is about 80%.  Mode of action  : Trandolapril acts by competitive inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), a key enzyme in the renin‚Äìangiotensin system which plays an important role in regulating blood pressure.

The song reached number three on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1964 and number one on Canada's RPM chart. The session musicians who played on this record (who were collectively known as The Wrecking Crew) included Leon Russell on piano; Tommy Tedesco, Bill Pitman and Billy Strange on guitar; Ray Pohlman and Jimmy Bond on bass; and Hal Blaine and Earl Palmer on drums. Jan & Dean reworked the lyrics from \\"The Little Old Lady (from Pasadena)\\" in 1967, renaming the track \\"Tijuana\\" and releasing it as a single that same year. The lyrics now contained thinly-veiled references to marijuana use. \\"Tijuana\\" was to be included on the act's final album Carnival of Sound, completed in 1969, but the LP went unreleased for several decades. The record was circulated as a bootleg until it garnered official release in 2010. The song was performed live by The Beach Boys at Sacramento Memorial Auditorium on August 1, 1964 for inclusion on their No.1 album Beach Boys Concert. The Beach Boys, and particularly Brian Wilson, who co-wrote several of Jan & Dean's biggest surf hits, had supported Jan & Dean in the recording studio to initiate them in the surf music genre. Premise The origins of \\"The Little Old Lady (from Pasadena)\\" stem from a very popular Dodge ad campaign in southern California that launched in early 1964. Starring actress Kathryn Minner, the commercials showed the white-haired elderly lady speeding down the street (and sometimes a drag strip) driving a modified Dodge. She would stop, look out the window and say \\"Put a Dodge in your garage, Hon-ey!\\". The song soon followed and Minner enjoyed great popularity until she died in 1969. \\"The Little Old Lady (from Pasadena)\\" was a folk archetype in Southern California in the mid-20th century. Part of this lore was that many an elderly man who died in Pasadena would leave his widow with a powerful car that she rarely, if ever, drove, such as an old Buick Roadmaster, or a vintage 1950s Cadillac, Ford, Packard, Studebaker, DeSoto, or La Salle. According to the story, used car salesmen would tell prospective buyers that the previous owner of a vehicle was \\"a little old lady from Pasadena who only drove it to church on Sundays,\\" thus suggesting the car had little wear. A 1964 Dodge In popular culture During the 1960s, the term became a popular punchline for many comedians, particularly Johnny Carson, who often invoked it when he took The Tonight Show to Los Angeles before permanently moving it there in 1972. The song was one of many California related songs played throughout \\"Sunshine Plaza\\" in the original Disney California Adventure. The Dead Kennedys satirized the concept in their own song \\"Buzzbomb from Pasadena,\\" where an elderly driver likewise terrorizes the city with her driving before getting into a shootout with police at a 7-11. In Animaniacs, Slappy Squirrel once takes over the old lady's role in the song. That episode ends with her revealing that she \\"never took a lesson in her life\\" and being arrested.

Frieze Art Fair is an international contemporary art fair in London, New York, and Los Angeles. Frieze London takes place every October in London's Regent's Park. In the US, the fair has been running on New York's Randall's Island since 2012, with its inaugural Los Angeles edition taking place February 2019. The fair was launched by Amanda Sharp and Matthew Slotover, the founders of frieze magazine, and is led by Victoria Siddall, global director of Frieze Fairs. Frieze Art Fair features more than 170 contemporary art galleries, and the fair also includes specially commissioned artists‚Äô projects, a talks programme and an artist-led education schedule. Background Although staged for the purpose of selling work, the fair has become a cultural entertainment event and out of its 68,000 visitors it has been suggested that 80% attend purely to spectate.\\"With a View to Make More Profit\\", Financial Times, March 4, 2006 The fair also commissions artist projects and holds a programme of talks. The galleries who apply each year are carefully selected by gallerists who participate at Frieze, according to specific criteria. Frieze Art Fair released sales figures following the first three fairs. However, Sharp and Slotover came to regard such results to be misleading and inaccurate, as many sales are completed post-fair, and many galleries choose to keep their sales figures private. From 2006 the fair has not released sales figures. In 2010, Matthew Slotover, co-founder of the fair, debated whether \\"art fairs are about money\\" with Louisa Buck, Matthew Collings, and Jasper Joffe for the motion and against the motion Norman Rosenthal, Richard Wentworth, Matthew Slotover. Joffe claims that his criticisms of Frieze Art Fair led to his work being banned from the fair in 2010.
