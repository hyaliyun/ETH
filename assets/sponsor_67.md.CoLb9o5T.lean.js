She argues that allegorical allusions to domestic English political issues are important as well as the dominant view that literary representations played an important role in the shaping of a national consciousness. Her examination of two early modern English \\"Turk\\" plays, Lust's Dominion and The Turke, notes the insight they provide to the domestic concerns of the culture they were produced within, including their negative depiction of Islamic men and their contribution to contemporary anti-Muslim sentiment. Likewise, in her analysis of the development of the pirate romance in the late-16th and early-17th centuries, Jowitt notes the ambivalence of attitudes to the ideology and practice of piracy — maritime violence — in an England that was becoming known internationally as a \\"nation of pirates\\". She describes how the portrayal of piracy in the contemporary literature became an index for other domestic concerns. She suggests that the depiction of pirates in Sir Philip Sydney's New Arcadia — in some respects acting little differently from any group of fighting men — may reflect the ambivalence of English attitudes of the time towards \\"men of action\\" like Sir Francis Drake. For the character Prince Musidorus, piracy and pirates are not condemned outright – if they can be serviceable to his cause, and are successful, then he supports them, in the same flexible way as Queen Elizabeth gave semi-official support to the \\"patriotic violence\\" of Drake and Hawkins.http://projects.chass.utoronto.ca/emls/si-16/jowiarca.htm \\"Et in Arcadia Ego\\": The Politics of Pirates in the Old Arcadia, New Arcadia and Urania, Claire Jowitt, Early Modern Literary Studies Special Issue 16 (October 2007) 5.1–36  Hakluyt Editorial Project  In May 2008, a major interdisciplinary conference entitled Richard Hakluyt 1552–1616: Life, Times, Legacy was convened by Jowitt and several colleagues, jointly organised by the National Maritime Museum, the Centre for Travel Writing Studies, Nottingham Trent University and the National University of Ireland, Galway..

A major aim of the conference was to bring together a network of scholars to prepare a new edition of Hakluyt's Principal Navigations, and a project was subsequently established to produce a multi- volume critical edition on this work. In parallel, Jowitt co-edited a collection of 24 essays on Richard Hakluyt that was published in 2012.

Description  These fossil moths have similarly shaped wings and wing scales, with abundant microtrichia on the wing membrane, comparable with recent Micropterigidae species such as Sabatinca and Micropteryx, but differences from them by the lack of ocelli and the apparent absence of a branch of the subcostal vein. The species is close to Sabatinca with which it has more characters in common than with Micropterix. Parasabatinca caldasae is known from two specimens from the Crato Formation in Brazil.

The Sherard of Stapleford, Leicestershire, had been High Sheriffs of Rutland in the 15th and 16th centuries, and in 1627 were made Barons Sherard in the Peerage of Ireland. Bennet Sherard, 3rd Baron Sherard, served as Lord Lieutenant of Rutland and represented both Leicestershire as Member of Parliament. He was made Baron Harborough in 1714, with special remainder to his first cousin once removed, Philip Sherard, grandson Bennet Sherard's uncle, Philip Sherard. In 1718, Baron Harborough became Viscount Sherard, of Stapleford, Leicester, and the next year he was made Earl of Harborough. Like the Harborough barony, the Earldom was created with remainder to his cousin and heir male, Philip Sherard. When the Earl of Harborough died in 1732, his titles devolved on his cousin, while the viscountcy, created without remainder, became extinct. Philip Sherard, 2nd Earl, also served as Lord-Lieutenant of Rutland and had represented that county in Parliament, dying in 1750. After the deaths of his two sons, Bennet Sherard, 3rd Earl of Harborough, who died in 1770, and his brother Robert Sherard, 4th Earl of Harborough in 1799, Robert's son Philip Sherard, 5th Earl of Harborough succeeded, followed by his son Robert Sherard, the 6th and last Earl of Harborough and Baron Harborough. Though he was father of an illegitimate son, Reverend Bennet Sherard Calcraft Kennedy, father of author and journalist Robert Sherard, he died without legitimate issue and the Earldom and Harborough barony went extinct.

Little is known of him. His name is sometimes given as Bedwd. The name Bleiddud appears to be derived from the Welsh blaidd, wolf, and tud, tribe or the territory of a tribe.Trefor Rendall Davies, A Book of Welsh Names (2007), p. 7 A bishop of the diocese named Joseph died in 1061, and Bleiddud was his successor. He is reported to have been consecrated by Æthelnoth, archbishop of Canterbury,William Basil Jones, Edward Augustus Freeman, The history and antiquities of Saint David's (1856), p. 267 who died in 1038, suggesting that he was translated to St David's having been a bishop elsewhere. The chapter of St David's, in an address to Pope Eugenius III of the year 1145, stated that a man named Melan of Llanelwy (Melanus Llanelvensis) was consecrated bishop of St Asaph by Bleiddud while he was bishop of St David's.Royal Historical Society of Great Britain, Guides and handbooks, Issue 2 (1939), p. 201David Richard Thomas, Esgobaeth Llanelwy. A history of the diocese of St Asaph (1870), p. 220: \\"c. A. D. 1070: \\"Melanus Llanelvensis, said by the chapter of St David's to have been consecrated by 'Bedwd', apparently Bleidd-dud...\\" This event has been dated to about the year 1070.David Richard Thomas, Esgobaeth Llanelwy: A history of the diocese of St Asaph (1870), p. 220 A \\"Bishop Begard\\" is addressed in a Coventry writ of Edward the Confessor of 1060, concerning the king's grant of judicial rights to Bromfield Minster in Shropshire, and it has been suggested that this is an error for Bleiddud.Peter Clemoes, The Anglo-Saxons (Bowes & Bowes, 1959), p. 94 According to the Annales Cambriae, Bleiddud died in 1071 and was succeeded as Bishop of St David's by Sulien. According to the account of Brut y Tywysogion for the year 1071, By the ninth century, and later, the right of the clergy to marry was well established in Wales, and an entry in the Book of St Chad records the grant of freedom to Bleiddud, son of Sulien, this apparently being the Sulien who succeeded Bishop Bleiddud. Gerald of Wales also notes that at the time it was usual for sons to follow fathers in church benefices.John Edward Lloyd, A History of Wales from the Earliest Times to the Edwardian Conquest (2009 edition), p. 215 The Book of Llandaff, dating from around 1125, also records a \\"decree of the liberty of Bleiddud and his offspring\\".W.

The composition is present in Dasam Granth Bir Patna Sahib. The bani contains information about the creation of the Khalsa Panth, the dress code of the Sikhs, and is strictly against ritualism.Ugardanti - Guru Gobind Singh(Chandd 5th and 6th)  Overview  Etymologically, Ugardanti is a feminine term made of two words, Ugar means Fierce and Danti means Tooth.A practical Sanskrit dictionary with transliteration, accentuation, and etymological analysis throughout - Arthur Anthony Macdonell One having Fierce Tooth, is called Ugardanti. Guru Gobind Singh is praying to Ugardanti, writing various attributes of Ugardanti and asking for blessings of prospering of new Panth which is free from hypocrisy, ritualism, casteism, human worship and worship only One Immortal God. In Gurmat, Fierce Tooth is explained as Hukam/Command/Will Power(Shakti) of God which tears off and destroys enemies. In Bansavalinama Dasan Patshahian ka (1769), the author Kesar Singh Chibbar explains and quotes a few passages from Guru Gobind Singh's Ugardanti.Bansavalinama Dasan Patshahian Ka - Kesar Singh Chibber In Hum Hindu Nahi(1898 ), the author Bhai Kahn Singh Nabha, believed that Ugardanti Bani was not written by Guru Gobind Singh but by Bhai Sukha Singh, a priest at Patna.Sikhs...We are not Hindus: Kahn Singh Nabha: However, Sukha Singh's works came into being after the Bansavalinama of Kesar Singh Chibbar. Nihang and Namdhari Sikhs believe it to be written by Guru Gobind Singh and is part of their daily liturgy. It was and is read to inspire warriors to stand up for truth and righteousness in the face of tyranny and oppression. The Composition is divided into six verses called Chhands in which the syllables and the rhythm are arranged in a precisely controlled pattern. The Type of Chhandd used is Bhagvati Chhand.

He joined the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia and was their principal benefactor and donor.

Wilson made many field trips in the US to collect birds, reptiles, fish and insects, minerals, fossils and shells .

Gundry was born at Lyme Regis, and entered as a member of the Middle Temple in 1720. In 1725 he was called to the bar, when he migrated to Lincoln's Inn. At the dissolution in 1741 he was returned to parliament for the borough of Dorchester, and was re-elected in 1747. He took his place among the opponents of Sir Robert Walpole, and on their triumph he was made a king's counsel, when Sir Charles Hanbury Williams wrote: 'That his Majesty might not want good and able counsellors learned in the law, lo ! Murray the orator and Nathaniel Gundry were appointed King's counsel'. His practice justified his being regarded as a candidate for the office of solicitor-general, but he was passed by, possibly because, as the satirists alleged, his manners were stiff and pretentious. On the death of Sir Thomas Abney in 1750 Gundry was appointed a judge of the common pleas. After he had been on the bench four years he, like Abney, was carried off by gaol fever, while on circuit at Launceston, Cornwall, on 23 March 1754, aged 53. He was buried at Musbury, near Axminster, and a tablet to his memory was placed against the western side of the south aisle of the parish church. A leasehold interest in the farm of Uddens in Chalbury, Dorsetshire, was acquired by him, and he built on the property a mansion which passed to his son Nathaniel, but he himself resided at Maidenhayne in Musbury, which he held on lease from Lady Drake. His widow, Mary Kelloway, died at Richmond, Surrey, 9 November 1791, aged 73.

Another traditional classification scheme of living plants is as follows (here, the first three classes are the \\"fern allies\\"): *Kingdom: Plantae **Division Tracheophyta (vascular plants) ***Class Lycopsida, clubmosses and related plants (fern- allies) ***Class Sphenopsida or Equisetopsida, horsetails and scouring-rushes (fern-allies) ***Class Psilopsida, whisk ferns (fern-allies) ***Class Filices or Pteropsida, true ferns ***Class Spermatopsida (or sometimes as several different classes of seed-bearing plants) More recent evidence shows that the class Filices, as described above, is not monophyletic. The following classification represents a consensus view (although different authors may use different names for the various groups): *Kingdom Plantae Subkingdom Tracheobionta **Division Lycopodiophyta ***Class Lycopodiopsida, clubmosses ***Class Selaginellopsida, spikemosses ***Class Isoetopsida, quillworts and scale trees **Division Pteridophyta ***Class Equisetopsida, horsetails and scouring-rushes ***Class Psilotopsida, whisk ferns, adders'-tongues and moonworts ***Class Marattiopsida, marattioid ferns ***Class Pteridopsida, leptosporangiate ferns (also called Polypodiopsida or Filicopsida) **Division Spermatophyta (or as several different divisions of seed-bearing plants) Note that in either scheme, the same basic groups are recognized (Lycopodiophyta, Equisetopsida, Psilotopsida), but in the most recent scheme only the Lycopodiophyta is not classified with the ferns. Relationships Another way of looking at this relationship is as follows. Several groups of plants were considered \\"fern allies\\": the clubmosses, spikemosses, and quillworts in the Lycopodiophyta, the whisk ferns in Psilotaceae, and the horsetails in the Equisetaceae. Traditionally, three discrete groups of plants had been considered ferns: the adders-tongues, moonworts, and grape-ferns (Ophioglossales), the Marattiaceae, and the leptosporangiate ferns. More recent genetic studies have shown that the Lycopodiophyta are only distantly related to any other vascular plants, having radiated evolutionarily at the base of the vascular plant clade, while both the whisk ferns and horsetails are as much true ferns as are the Ophioglossoids and Marattiaceae. The Marattiaceae are a group of tropical ferns with a large, fleshy rhizome, and are now thought to be a sister group to the main group of ferns, the leptosporangiate ferns. The whisk ferns and Ophioglossids are demonstrably a clade, however, the relationships between these this group, the leptosporangiate ferns+marattiaceae, and the horsetails remains uncertain.

Porto Alegre: EDIPUCRS, Brasil. M. bicornis has several unusual morphological characteristics, namely the two postcloacal \\"horns\\" in the posterior of males, and a separate elongated cephalic region (head) that may be extended and retracted.Moravec, F. and Thatcher, V.E. 1996. Myleusnema bicornis gen. et sp. n. (Nematoda: Kathlaniidae), an intestinal parasite of a freshwater serrasalmid fish, Myleus ternetzi, from French Guiana. Folia Parasitologica 43:53-59. These features differ vastly from other Cosmocercoidean nematodes, as well as any others within the family Kathlaniidae, and as such necessitate the creation of the new genus Myleusnema; however, no genetic taxonomic studies have been performed. Etymology The generic name derives from the Greek terms Myleus (generic name of fish host) and nema (short for nematode), whereas the specific name, bicornis, refers to the two postcloacal \\"horns\\" present on males.Moravec, F. and Thatcher, V.E. 1996. Myleusnema bicornis gen. et sp. n. (Nematoda: Kathlaniidae), an intestinal parasite of a freshwater serrasalmid fish, Myleus ternetzi, from French Guiana. Folia Parasitologica 43:53-59 Morphology Myleusnema bicornis possess characteristics which are common for all nematodes: they are long and cylindrical with a \\"worm-like\\" shape, show bilateral symmetry, and contain a pseudocoelom, a primitive body cavity. Only longitudinal muscles are present within nematodes, which are covered by a protective cuticle layer. Nerve chords relay stimuli from sensory organs such as amphids, phasmids, cephalic papillae, and caudal papillae.Roberts, L., J. Janovy. 2000. Foundations of Parasitology. US: The McGraw Hill Companies, Inc.. Fetterer, R., M. Rhoads. 1996, 375-377p. M. bicornis differs from other nematodes in that it possess an extended oesophageal cavity, a ventral pre- anal sucker, and an unusual number of caudal papillae (12 total, 1 lone). The cephalic extremity is also made up of three lips and lamella-like formations. The combination of these features taxonomically place the organism into the family Kathlaniidae. M. bicornis has the ability to extend or retract its cephalic region, though the specific function of this ability is unknown.Moravec, F. and Thatcher, V.E. 1996. Myleusnema bicornis gen. et sp. n. (Nematoda: Kathlaniidae), an intestinal parasite of a freshwater serrasalmid fish, Myleus ternetzi, from French Guiana. Folia Parasitologica 43:53-59 Its caudal papillae are unique in both number and distribution: 10 subventral pairs and 2 lateral pairs, along with one unpaired papillae in front of the cloaca. Sexual dimorphism is also present in Myleusnema bicornis, in the form of two postloacal \\"horns\\" present on males.Moravec, F. and Thatcher, V.E. 1996. Myleusnema bicornis gen. et sp. n.

History William Stickney Lamson opened a shop in Merrimack Street, Lowell, Massachusetts, in February 1879. He experimented in saving the assistants walking between the counter and the cash office with a system of hollow balls on tracks. The Cash Ball system was born. He filed a patent on 14 February 1881. In January, 1882, the Lamson Cash Carrier Company was incorporated. In 1884, John Magrath Kelly,John LIFFEN (1999) The Development of Cash Handling Systems for Shops and Department Stores, Transactions of the Newcomen Society, 71:1, 79-101. an Irish-American from Boston, became an agent for the Lamson Cash Ball system in London, and the British Company was founded. By 1888, the Lamson Store Service Company Ltd was established at 1 Charlotte Street, Bedford Square, London, WC. With capital of £85,000 (£ as of ) the company had rights to the ball system for Europe, Africa, Australia, New Zealand and the Middle East, with UK patent 18566. In 1889, the company was renamed the Lamson Paragon Supply Company through an amalgamation of the Paragon Check Book Co with the Lamson Store Service Company. Shortly afterwards, they started selling the Rapid Wire systems in Britain. In 1897, the Bostedo Package and Cash Carrier Company launched its products in Britain. It was bought out two years later when Lamson renamed it the Lamson Pneumatic Tube Company. Subsidiary companies were established in Australia in 1901 and New Zealand in 1905. In 1911, all manufacturing was consolidated at a single factory in Hythe Road, Willesden Junction, northwest London. On 20 January 1937, the Lamson Engineering Company Ltd was incorporated as a merger of the Lamson Store Service Co Ltd and Lamson Pneumatic Tube Co Ltd. In 1973, the firm was promoting its \\"Rallypost\\" system with PVC track and battery-operated carriers that could carry up to 6 kg.New Scientist 8 Mar 1973 This was designed as an office document carrier. The company relocated to Stoke on Trent in 1974. Lamson Engineering Company Ltd survived until 1976 when it was taken over by Dialed Despatches to become D. D. Lamson.

In August 1918, after the October Revolution, he joined the Red Army, serving in the Russian Civil War first as a company commander and later as a deputy regimental commander. In October 1923 he was appointed commander of 89th Rifle Regiment. He joined the Communist Party in 1928. During 1929 he undertook advanced officers' training, and he graduated from the Frunze Academy in 1936. In October 1936 he became the 99th Rifle Division's commander.

On 4 June 1940, with the introduction of new ranks, he became a lieutenant general.Kuznetsov on the Heroes of the USSR website. The Great Patriotic War On 22 June 1941, Kuznetsov's 3rd Army was stationed in Belarus, as part of the Western Front. It was overwhelmed and surrounded by German forces. In July, he and the remains of his formation broke out and returned to the Soviet lines. This feat earned him praise from Stalin when he issued Order No. 270. In late August, he was sent to command the Southwestern Front's 21st Army, but his force suffered crushing defeat once more in the Battle of Kiev. On October, he was appointed to command the Kharkov Military District, but reassigned to head the 1st Shock Army on 23 November, with which he took part in the Battle of Moscow. His units liberated Klin and Solnechnogorsk.Kuznetsov on the Great Soviet Encyclopedia. In February 1942, the Army relocated to the north, taking part in the Demyansk operation. On July, Kuzentsov was given command of the 63rd Army, positioned near Stalingrad. The formation was renamed 1st Guards Army on November. For his conduct in the campaign, Kuznetsov was awarded the Order of Suvorov 1st Class. On 25 March 1943 he was promoted to the rank of Colonel General. The 1st Guards later took part in the battles for the Donbass region and in the Dniepr crossing. On 15 December, Kuznetsov was appointed Bagramyan's deputy in the 1st Baltic Front. In this capacity he participated in the campaigns for Belarus, the Baltics and East Prussia. The Front was disbanded on late February 1945, and Kuznetsov assumed command over the 1st Belorussian's 3rd Shock Army on 16 March. The Army was involved in the urban fighting inside Berlin; On 30 April, one of its formations, the 150th Rifle Division, stormed the Reichstag.

He was a leading figure of the Heart Mountain Fair Play Committee, an ad hoc group who protested the drafting of Japanese Americans interned during World War II.Elaine Woo. \\"Frank S. Emi dies at 94; Japanese American fought effort to draft WWII internees\\" Los Angeles Times, Dec 09, 2010. Emi argued it was unconstitutional to conscript men who had been stripped of their civil rights into military service and advised Nisei who received draft orders to demand they be released from camp before reporting for duty. He was convicted of conspiring to violate the Selective Service Act and served eighteen months of a four-year sentence in federal prison. For many years, Emi and his fellow draft resisters were condemned as troublemakers by the Japanese American Citizens League and the larger Japanese American community,Eric L. Muller. \\"Heart Mountain Fair Play Committee\\" Densho Encyclopedia (accessed Feb 19, 2014) but his legacy has more recently come to be seen as an important example of civil disobedience.Esther Newman. \\"Frank Emi\\" Densho Encyclopedia (accessed Feb 19, 2014) Early life Frank Seishi Emi was born in Los Angeles on September 23, 1916. When he was four years old, his family moved to the San Fernando Valley, where they farmed and eventually opened a produce market. He attended San Fernando High School for two years, until his family moved again to open a grocery store in Long Beach. He graduated from Long Beach Polytechnic High School and entered the Los Angeles City College's pharmacy program. After his father was seriously injured in a car accident, Emi left school to run the family's produce market in downtown Los Angeles. By 1941, Emi was running a successful business. He had just invested $25,000 to expand the market when Pearl Harbor was attacked on December 7, 1941. He was not immediately worried, recalling later, \\"we didn't have an inkling that we ourselves were going to be bothered because we Nisei had been born here in this country and we were citizens.\\"Frank Emi interview, Japanese American World War II Evacuation Oral History Project, Calisphere, University of California. However, after Executive Order 9066 put into motion the removal of Japanese Americans from the West Coast, he was forced to sell the family business for $1,500, about six cents for each dollar of the produce market's real value.Martha Nakagawa. \\"Frank Emi, Leader of Heart Mountain Draft Resisters, Dies at 94\\" NikkeiWest, Dec 19, 2010 (accessed Feb 19, 2014) Emi moved into his parents' house with his wife and two children once evacuation orders began to circulate in early 1942, to ensure the family would not be separated and sent to different camps. They were held at the hastily constructed Pomona Assembly Center for three months, before being sent to the Heart Mountain Relocation Center, halfway between the cities of Cody and Powell in Wyoming, in September 1942. Draft resistance In early 1943, the War Relocation Authority began to distribute a \\"Leave Clearance Form,\\" better known as the loyalty questionnaire because of two controversial questions that attempted to discern the loyalty of imprisoned Japanese Americans. Question 27 asked whether men would be willing to serve in the armed forces, while Question 28 asked inmates to forswear their allegiance to the Emperor of Japan. While many gave unqualified affirmative responses, many, like Emi, were confused and offended by the questions' implications. Emi's response to both was, \\"Under the present conditions and circumstances, I am unable to answer this question,\\" and he encouraged others to do the same, posting fliers with suggested answers around Heart Mountain.Dennis Hevesi. \\"Frank Emi, Defiant World War II Internee, Dies at 94,\\" The New York Times, 18 Dec 2010. Also in 1943, with new soldiers to replace those who had died in combat in high demand, the previous restrictions against Nisei men (listed as enemy aliens ineligible for service after Pearl Harbor) were set aside in order to create a segregated unit of Japanese American volunteers.Franklin Odo. \\"442nd Regimental Combat Team,\\" Densho Encyclopedia (accessed 18 Mar 2014). Given the nickname \\"Go For Broke\\" for its soldier's willingness to put their lives at risk in battle, the unit suffered an extremely high casualty rate and soon required fresh troops. A 1944 amendment to the Selective Service Act reinstated the draft for men in camp when only 1,181 inmates volunteered.Tule Lake Committee: \\"History\\" (accessed 18 Mar 2014). Emi and five other Heart Mountain inmates joined Kiyoshi Okamoto, a vocal protestor against the loyalty questionnaire and the incarceration who called himself a \\"Fair Play Committee of One,\\" to form the Heart Mountain Fair Play Committee. The Committee encouraged other inmates to refuse military service until their full citizenship rights were restored, and held public meetings to discuss the unconstitutionality of their confinement. As more young men joined the Committee and refused to comply with draft orders, the federal government took action. On March 25, 1944, twelve Heart Mountain inmates who had not reported for their draft physicals were arrested by U.S. Marshals. Undeterred, more young men followed their example, and Emi and two other Committee members who had not received drafted notices (Emi was married with children) attempted to walk out of camp to highlight their status as prisoners. Later that year, sixty-three Heart Mountain resisters were arrested after failing to show up for their induction and were subsequently tried in federal court and convicted of felony draft evasionConscience and the Constitution: \\"Resistance.\\" PBS. (accessed 18 Mar 2014) and, at the suggestion of the Japanese American Citizens League, whose leaders had lobbied the government to permit Nisei men to join the war effort, the added charge of sedition.Cherstin M. Lyon. \\"Japanese American Citizens League,\\" Densho Encyclopedia (accessed Feb 19, 2014). A total of 300 draft resisters from Heart Mountain and seven other WRA camps were arrested and stood trial for these charges; almost all served at least two years in federal prison.Eric L. Muller. \\"Draft resistance,\\" Densho Encyclopedia (accessed 18 Mar 2014). The seven leaders of the Fair Play Committee, who were not eligible for the draft because of their age or domestic status, were convicted of conspiracy to violate the Selective Service Act and sentenced to four years in federal prison. Emi served 18 months at the U.S. Penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas, before his and the other leader's sentences were overturned by a federal appeals court in December 1945. Post- war legacy Outside prison, Emi and his fellow draft resisters found that most of their peers viewed them with disdain and considered their wartime resistance a sign of disloyalty and cowardice, a stain on the Japanese American community in general and the legacy of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team in particular. This stigma would not begin to change until the late 1970s and early 1980s, when a younger generation of Sansei began to push for redress and a reexamination of their parents' and grandparents' wartime experiences. In 2000, the Japanese American Citizens League reversed their stance and offered Emi and the other resisters a formal apology. After the war, Frank Emi worked as a gardener and a grocery clerk before beginning a career with the postal service. After retiring from the post office, he worked at a state unemployment office until 1982.Conscience and the Constitution: \\"Frank Emi,\\" PBS (accessed 18 Mar 2014). Promoted to 8th-degree black belt in 2008, he was also the head instructor of the Hollywood Judo Dojo and was credited for producing several national judo athletes.

Famous for his minimalist gardens and the use of light and organic shapes. Mas de Les Voltes Pazo Pegullal Flynn Camp Sarch Life As he has expressed on many occasions, he received education in the nature during his childhood and adolescence, which marked him deeply. At 1975, at the age of 18, Fernando Caruncho started his philosophy studies in the Universidad Autónoma of Madrid, where he had the experience to learn about the philosophy of the early Greek philosophers who strongly marked him, as well as other thinkers of our day, heirs of this tradition up to the philosophers. This is why he is very influenced by aspects related to geometry, light and the knowledge of nature. During his career the influence of the world of poetry, music and painting is recognized, which have been essential to shape his eye and sensibility to read the site and translate it with a new contemporary language to the garden. In 1979 he began his studies at the Castillo de Batres, private landscaping school in Madrid, in these years he unites both influences giving his work as a gardener a personal identity and character. Career In 1979 Caruncho established his own studio. His first work accomplished at the age of 21, in a house in Madrid, published in VOGUE DECORATION in May 1987, Edited in Paris. His second major publication was in July 1992 in that same magazine after two issues in which special attention is devoted to Jacques Wirtz and Russell Page, written by Jean-Paul Pigeat, Director General of Jardines de France and founder of the Festival des Jardins Chaumont-sur-Loire. He was invited to the first edition along with the great 10 Landscape designers at that moment, being Caruncho the youngest of all of them by far. His career continues with a series of projects in Spain, country which rejoins the rich Spanish gardens tradition with great enthusiasm, gardens which essentially influenced him, such as the Alhambra, Patio de los Naranjos, or the Alcazar in Seville. It is after 15 years of intense experience performing gardens when he had the opportunity to make his first project in the United States, although previously he worked in France and Italy, and continues his long career in which he is immersed today: Cotswolds in England, Marrakech in Morocco, Oakland in New Zealand, Tokyo in Japan... His most recent projects are in Lugano, Switzerland; Isola Bella, a Project of an island in Maine, Fundación Botín working together with Renzo Piano in Santander, Spain; a Project next to the sea in Greece; and one at Vigneto de L’Amastuola in Apulia, Italy. Amastuola About his work In Caruncho´s work, light is the key element of the garden. In addition to the light, the geometry and the relation of the garden and landscape architecture. When he speaks about geometry he always insists that it may be obvious or hidden, but it is without a doubt the way to read or interpret the place, and in his gardens there is a clear example of this. Nowadays in his studio architecture projects are developed with a new concept: The architecture forms a whole unity with the garden. Dan Kiley, master of American landscape design of the last 50 years, wrote the preface to the book Mirrors of Paradise by Guy Cooper and Gordon Taylor, a book that collected the first 15 years of Caruncho´s work. Kiley recognises Caruncho as his successor, as he bases on his same principles and design ideals: > \\"My career is approaching its sunset, and in Caruncho I see someone who may > well be the only landscape architect who is guided by the same principles > and ideals that I have tried to realize over the course of my work. I have > been hoping that my way of thinking, which is purely a method of recognizing > and solving a problem and is not necessarily unique to me, would be > projected, and I believe he is the ideal one to carry it forward.\\" Kiley also highlights the influence that religion has on Caruncho's work: > \\"Caruncho’s relation to religion is important. It is easy to see his > correspondence of religion and environment, like falling over into something > it’s obvious once you have the knowledge and the background. What is > religion but our desire to know where, how, and why we stand in this world? > And as I said in my own book, \\"The greatest contribution a designer can make > is to link the human and the natural in such a way as to recall our > fundamental place in the scheme of things.\\" According to Guy Cooper and Gordon Taylor\\" > \\"Ancient agriculture meets formal contemporary garden design in the late > twentieth century. Caruncho is classically educated, as can be seen from any > of his designs which combine profound simplicity with extraordinary > sophistication. Caruncho says that his designs are a constant attempt \\"to > capture the light (vibration lumineuse) \\"in the garden space, through a > formal setting of the simplest elements: \\"everything in a Spanish garden is > founded in how you deal with the light\\" \\"Caruncho sees the garden as a > mirror of the universe: \\"I strive to arrange a space that invites reflection > and inquiry by allowing the light to delineate geometries, perspectives and > symmetries\\" Kirsty Fergusson remarks Caruncho´s philosophical bases as a trigger of his curiosity in the relation between man and nature, and its application to the world of garden and the diverse influences if Zen, European Classicism on his work. Caruncho believed light \\"makes the languages of geometry intelligible\\". Although most of Fernando Caruncho gardens are not open to the public, Paul Jean Piaget says they will leave a deep mark in the Mediterranean Garden scenery in the coming decades. According to Jane Amidon Caruncho rearranges the elements of the garden to get an impression of modernity: \\"A classicist at first glance, landscape architect Fernando Caruncho takes traditional crops, harvest techniques and water-collection methods and rearranges then to find a modernist spatial sensibility.\\" Penelope Hobhouse has described his work as the antithesis to the English Jekyll Style Garden. His designs are implemented on a grid system which Hobhouse says \\"unites all the individual elements\\". She says Cauruncho \\"brings a basic purity to design, using straight lines and right angles on a large landscape scale, emphasizing light and shadow, movement, form, leaf colour, and texture, with little reference to flowers.' Nancy Hass, in her article for T Magazine of The New York Times writes: > \\"At first glance, the hypnotic curves of Amastuola seem uncharacteristic of > Caruncho. He is a master of the right angle, of near impossible planes and > monochromatic environments…but the vineyard…combines an allegiance to > straight lines with an organic impulse…visually you have the shock of the > grid against the waves\\" Tim Richardson says: > \\"His particular brand of formality runs deep; it is not a simple design tool > but a fundamental belief, inspired by his philosophical studies notably of > the ancient Greeks. The sense of order and balance, of permanence and > history is archived by bringing together by Caruncho own aesthetic heritage > and the history of the landscape. He is particularly interested in the > science of irrigation and ancient agricultural patterns.\\" Casa Caruncho Projects Among the more than 150 projects, some of the most significant projects are: * Mas de les Voltes, Ampurdán, Spain * Casa Caruncho, Madrid, Spain * Mas Floris, Ampurdán, Spain * Flynn, Boca Ratón, Florida, USA * Mavec-Nordberg, New Jersey, USA * Isola Bella, Maine, USA * Hauraki Gulf Garden, the North Island of New Zealand * Embassy of Spain, Tokyo, Japan * Garden of the Seven Mountains, Lugano, Switzerland * Casa del Agua, Greece * Jardines de Pereda, Fundación Botín, Santander, Spain.

First Five Year Plan (1947–1951)   Preparations  Early in the second half of 1946, the Technical Secretariat of the Presidency began to prepare a Plan of Government for the five-year period from 1947 to 1951. The Five Year Plan was first announced as a bill to be sent to the Congress, in the presidential message of October 19, 1946 (the Article 1º consisted of the \\"Achievements and Investment Plan\\", and developed a number of other bills). The plan addressed the need to anticipate and encode in a single body all the measures affecting the exports and imports, regulating the classification, packaging and quality certification of the exportable products, and establishing a customs procedure tailored to the current situation at that time. It decentralized and diversified industry, forming new productive areas, and placing them properly in terms of natural energy sources, means of communication, transportation and consumer markets. A minimum of five years was established for works and investment needed to ensure an adequate supply of raw materials, fuel and mechanical equipment, and rationally develop industry and agriculture in the country. Moreover, in order to expedite customs and port services, it was proposed to unify in each office those functions under the direction, coordination and oversight of a central body to be known as the General Administration of Customs and Ports of the Nation which would replace -with more powers- to the hitherto General Directorate of Customs. In its article 2 º, it authorized the Executive to fund the plan with the issue of Public Debt Securities in the amount required and / or any other appropriate means, rendering annually to Congress. The making knowledge was new: both houses of the Congress were convened, not formally as House, but as an invitation to national senators and representatives to join the exposure of the President. The event took place in the floor of the House of Deputies on October 21, 1946, with full attendance for the ruling bloc, however the opposition failed to attend. The event was opened by the Senate President and Vice President of the Nation, Dr. Juan Hortensio Quijano; and later Perón and the Technical Secretary, barcelonan Dr. José Figuerola. The government opened an outreach campaign, beginning with talks of President Juan Perón in the Teatro Colón, first with workers, and then with employers of the Argentine Industrial Union and the newly created Argentine Association of Production, Industry and Trade.  Second Five Year Plan (1951–1955)  The Second Five Year Plan was based on encouraging the growth of the heavy industry. It was held in 1952, during the second term of Juan Domingo Perón (1951–1955).  Measures  During this period, Perón stressed primarily to promote foreign investment in the Argentine trade. The main measurements were: # Increase foreign investment # Growth of heavy industry # Removes most of the subsidies and industrial loans # Partial restriction of public consumption # The IAPI (Argentine Institute for the Promotion of Trade) would buy crops at a lower price than the international ones, for obtaining resources and stimulating industrialization.  Economy  The state took over the tasks of selling the exportable surpluses of domestic production, and purchasing fuel, raw materials and capital goods required for agricultural, industrial and mining development in the country.  Argentine Institute for the Promotion of Trade  The Argentine Institute for the Promotion of Trade (IAPI) was an Argentine public body created by the decree nº 15350 on May 28, 1946, that, although it was signed by President Edelmiro Farrell, it was part of the package that Colonel Juan Domingo Perón and his team of advisers had projected, operating under the aegis of the Central Bank, in order to centralize foreign trade and transfer resources between different sectors of the economy. Its director was the economist Miguel Miranda, chairman of the Central Bank.  Objectives  The objective that guided the creation of this agency was the need to have an agency specialized in trade issues, a better external integration through the conquest of new markets, and the consolidation of Argentina's presence in those already obtained. It also sought to promote the quality and diversity of local products and create strategies to defend their prices in the international market against the eventual deterioration of the terms of trade; protecting domestic producers against the changes in international prices, and against the action of international monopolies and importing countries of Argentine products.  Features  Propaganda of the First Five-Year Plan promoting the IAPI. The body had different functions. At the commercial level, it was responsible for buying cereals and meat to the producers, and then export them when international prices were favorable. Also met financial functions, providing funds to certain public agencies, provincial governments and even to the private sector for the acquisition of capital goods. When the Institute acquired processed products which failed placement, it provided the profit margin for the industrial sector, creating a special joint committee to resolve the crisis in certain productive sectors, acquiring raw materials to give it to manufacturers. Also developed promotion and development functions, as determined which production activities were a priority and therefore should receive special treatment, for example, the granting of credits without obligation to repay. On the other hand, it subsidized the production of certain consumer goods in order to maintain the level of real wages.  Results  Trade agreements were reached with several countries. Between 1947 and 1949 reached trade agreements with Switzerland, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Finland, Denmark, Brazil and Sweden. Despite the efforts made by the body to expand the portfolio of buyers of Argentine products, the United Kingdom continued to rank first as an importer, followed by the United States. Concerning imports, the importance of IAPI was significantly lower. The major purchases were recorded in the areas of metallurgy, building materials, machinery and textiles, standing out as sellers United States and Great Britain, while trade with the Soviet Union reported a significant increase since 1953.  Decline  The international decline in agricultural prices that followed the post-war European recovery, largely cut off the genuine source of income of the IAPI. Since 1949 the institute's activities dwindled, leading to the private sector take over much of the exchange. In its relations with the private sector, the large subsidies granted IAPI: between 1947 and 1954 agricultural subsidies amounted to 5,063,011 pesos, while the livestock sector amounted 4,567,590 pesos. Finally, the deficit turned out to be important enough to motivate the redesign of its convenience (in its latest report the agency's operating deficit amounted to 20,000 million pesos or 3% of the GDP of that time).

It is part of the Saxon-Franconian trunk line (). History  The line was built as a continuation of the Pegnitz Valley Railway from Nuremberg to Pegnitz to provide a direct connection from Bayreuth to Nuremberg that was shorter than the branch line opened in 1853 from Neuenmarkt-Wirsberg on the Ludwig South- North Railway. It was opened on 15 July 1877.  Route  The line branches off the Nuremberg–Cheb line at Schnabelwaid station and runs north next to highways B 2 and B 85 and the Red Main river to Bayreuth. Just south of Bayreuth station the line crosses the valley of the Red Main on a 1.5 km-long embankment. On this embankment to the east of the Schnabelwaid–Bayreuth line is the parallel track of the Weiden–Bayreuth line. The two tracks cross the B 22 (Wieland-Wager Straße), the Bayreuth mill canal and finally, just before the entrance to Bayreuth station, the B 2 (Albrecht-Dürer Straße) and immediately afterwards the Red Main. Line standards  The route is single track for its entire length and has passing places for trains at Creußen and Neuenreuth stations. The line has a maximum speed of 140 km/h. Services  Regional-Express services run every two hours, using class 612 diesel multiple units (DMUs) (RegioSwingers), from Nuremberg via Pegnitz, Bayreuth, Münchberg to Hof. Until the timetable change in December 2013, these trains were operated as Interregio-Expresses, continuing to Chemnitz and Dresden. Since the electrification of the Saxon-Franconian trunk line between Hof and Dresden, the service has ended in Hof, so a change is required. In addition, class 612 sets are used to operate Regional-Express services from Nuremberg to Bayreuth and school services. Since December 2013, there has also been a direct service operated with class 612 sets from Lichtenfels to Nuremberg via Kulmbach, Neuenmarkt-Wirsberg and Bayreuth. Since the accession of the district and the city of Bayreuth, the line has been fully integrated into the Verkehrsverbund Großraum Nürnberg (VGN), which organises regional rail services, and is served by Regionalbahn service R3.

He is a doctor of philosophy and currently a professor at the Moscow State Academy for Business Administration. Biography Zaid Orudzhev was born in Baku, entered the Faculty of Philosophy at Lomonosov Moscow State University in the early 1950s, graduating in 1955. For the next 12 years, he taught at a number of educational institutions back in Baku (mainly at the state university), during which time he was awarded a doctorate for his thesis on “The problems of dialectical logic in the economic research of Karl Marx”. In 1967-1969 he founded and was at the head of the department of philosophy at the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology. In 1969, Orudzhev was appointed a professor at the Faculty of Philosophy at his alma mater, Lomonosov Moscow State University, a post he would occupy for the next 16 years. In 1985, he embarked upon a two- year as director of the Institute of Philosophy and Law at the Academy of Sciences in the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic. In 1986, he edited and co-authored “Dialectical logic”, published in Moscow. Between 1987 and 1992, he was professor of philosophy at the Higher Party School. During the next few years, Orudzhev was a senior research fellow and then chief research fellow at the Russian President's Academy of State Service. Since 2005, he is a professor at the Moscow State Academy for Business Administration. Prof. Orudzhev has read courses of lectures on dialectical logic at universities in Germany, the US, Canada and Cuba. Principal works While studying history of philosophy and the natural sciences in the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, Orudzhev explored the problems of theoretical proof and how theoretical proof differs from empirical and formal logical proofs, as well as the problem of producing a systematic exposition of dialectical logic. In the 1980s, in a book published by Cornell University in the US, the Sovietologist Prof. James Scanlan wroteJames P. Scanlan. Marxism in the USSR. Cornell University Press. Ithaca and London. 1985. p 172. that Orudzhev's work meant dialectical logic cannot be rejected in the US, as had been the case previously USSR specialists, because the issue had been raised to a level that merited scientific respect. Orudzhev paid a great deal of attention to developing a method for the analysis of intermediate links in order to create systems of scientific theory. The significance of this last aspect for the research of theory systems in biology was highlighted by a research group led by A.M.Chernukh, an academician from the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences.A.M.Chernukh, P.N.Aleksandrov, O.V.Alekseyev. Microcirculation. M., “Medicine”. 1975. p 407 (Russian edition) Orudzhev's articles were the first in the USSR to develop the theory of reform as an essential means for the development of any society, including socialist society,“Reform in the Activity of the Socialist State”, “Philosophical Sciences” No 3 1984.

Philosophy of the Past”. M., 2004; “Human Nature and the Sense of History”. M., 2009; see articles: “Mode of Thought in the Epoch and the Principle of Apriorism” in “Questions of Philosophy” No 5 2006; “To the Question of the Emergence of the Human Mind” in “Questions of Philosophy” No 12 2009 (Russian edition) Orudzhev defines the past, according to Nietzsche, only humans possess,Works in two volumes. Volume 1. Friedrich Nietzsche, M., 1990. Publishing house “Mysl”, pp 161-162 (Russian edition) as a unity of time that has already passed and a human being's accumulated activities. This view of the past enabled humans to include internal time in their life activities, as a result of which they also started to grasp logic. Incidentally, Aristotle wrote: “What is past cannot possibly be other than it is, as Agathon has well said, saying – one thing alone not even God can do, to make undone whatever hath been done”.Ethics. Aristotle. M. 2002. p 160 (Russian edition); The Nicomahean Ethics of Aristotle Newly translated into English by Robert Williams, BA London Longmans, Green and Co, 1869. p 184 (English edition) But humans did indeed emerge from the “accumulated past”, from a source to which even gods have no access. Contrary to most attempts to solve this problem on the basis of “pure naturalism”, and specifically using biological methods, Orudzhev believes that the problem of the shift from animal nature to a qualitatively different nature – human nature – can only be solved through a philosophy that relies on results obtained not only through biology, but also through psychology, linguistics, sociology and other sciences. The problem must be formulated with attention being paid to the relevant intermediate links, which are not taken into consideration by individual sciences. Orudzhev believes that Darwin's theory still (almost 150 years since the 1871 publication of The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex) cannot prove the natural origin of man in the proper sense, because it does not depart from “pure biologism” in its understanding of human nature. The naturalistic conception of humans, which has so far been unable to make the strictly logical shift from animals to humans themselves, and which sometimes argues that the problem lies in the absence of a “missing link” that is yet to be found, is mistaken. In fact, there is a “decisive link”, which this conception does not in any way seek. This conception does not take account of the presence of the human capacity for a priori thought, the presence of which was proved by German classical philosophy in the person of Kant, who proceeded from the premise that it is humans that can think a priori, because they possess mind. Kant had no knowledge of Darwin's ideas and therefore did not deal with the problem of animal, a posteriori thought transforming into actual human, a priori thought. Plato raised the issue of apriorism with his concept of “anamnesis”,Works. Plato. Vol.1. pp 384, 385, 407 etc. (Russian edition) and so, later on, did Leibniz, with his concept of “innate ideas”.Works. Leibniz. M. 1983. Vol. 2. p 489 etc (Russian edition) But Darwin himself, as a 19th-century Englishman, took the sensualist view, seeing sensation in absolute terms and viewing the capacity for abstraction as something of which for human mind was sufficient. Orudzhev logically explains the emergence of human beings’ a priori ability on the basis of the concept of the “accumulated past” that he introduced (which includes (i) a chaotic part; (ii) an organised part, in other words an ordered part; and finally (iii) a mode of thought in the relevant period (in a period in history, for example), which orders, “organises” the “accumulated past”) and uses that to create an opportunity for new experience, logic and the creation of modes of thought in epochs. On the basis of these human abilities, of course, lies the capacity for creativity, ordering, or, as Nietzsche wrote, “the organisation of chaos”. The “accumulated past”, or the “third world”, is not devoid of subject, as Popper suggested,\\"Objective Knowledge. The Evolutionary Approach\\", in: \\"The Logic and Growth of Scientific Knowledge”. Karl R. Popper. M. 1979. p 439 etc. (Russian edition) humans are always “carrying it with them”, as Bias argued, and collaborate with that past, “organising” it. But how does the “accumulated past” actually arise? It arises from the capabilities of verbal language, which was given to the human race's ancestors as an instinct. Darwin himself suggested that language was given to humans as an instinct. At the time, this idea was adopted by a whole series of scientists, but now it has been convincingly substantiated by modern linguists, particularly Chomsky and Pinker, who advanced as one of their major theories the notion that one of language's properties is that it awakens a human being's creative abilities. Pinker highlights Chomsky's idea that brings language, in terms of its properties, into proximity with a priori thought, the significance of which is great in terms of understanding “the secret of the emergence of human nature”. The independence of words from the specific properties of external objects, first of all, allows humans to create each sentence by means of “fundamentally new combinations of words, appearing for the first time in the history of the universe”, and, second, from birth children carry a certain design, common to the grammars of all languages, a so-called “Universal Grammar”, Pinker stresses, “which shows them how to identify syntactic models in the speech of their parents”.The Language as Instinct. Steven Pinker. M. 2004. pp 14-15 (Russian edition) The synthesis of verbal language as the “origin” with the past as the substance of the new nature (human nature) produces the “accumulated past”, without which humans could not possess the capacity for a priori thought. But how does the “accumulated past” make the human capacity for a priori thought a reality? Thanks to the Word (verbal language), humans retain a “multitude” of results from their experience (in hunting, gathering, interaction with other people etc., including experience that has no direct biological significance for their survival). This “accumulated past”, which humans constantly “carry around with themselves”, enables them to interact with elements of the past and synthesise elements of the “accumulated past” – elements which did not interact with one another at all, either previously or in human experience. That is how Kant's a priori synthesis arises, a fully- fledged apriorism typical of humans in the proper sense. Incidentally, in the animal world, apriorism already exists in a partial, elementary form. If an animal, in contrast to a “dead” stone and other similar objects, failed to keep ahead of changes taking place in the external world, it would not be able to adapt to that world, and would be destroyed by a stronger predator, or by falling into a chasm, or by a stone falling down the mountainside. But animals possess “microapriorism”, in the form of logical analogy, which enables them to react in different ways to the various processes and phenomena taking place around them. Analogy is the simplest rational form of thought, which enables animals, at the very least, to distinguish between “their own” and “the others”, for example. During the Paleolithic period, humans already had the capacity for “half-apriorism”, since, by using chips of stone, they could analytically separate sharp objects (prototype knives, chisels and other tools used to handle the carcasses of dead animals in order to extract the brain or obtain the animal's pelt etc.) from stones or dead animals. A human being's new experience is created by the a priori method, irrespective of its scale. For example, according to Orudzhev, the three well-known stages of a human being's temporal existence can be characterised as the dominance of a human being's homogenous (mass) abilities in the first (primitive) stage; group abilities in the second (historical) stage; and individual, creative abilities in the third (post-historical) stage. All these changes took place gradually, of course, over the course of tens of thousands of years, as a result of the changing modes of thought that controlled the actions of human beings. Orudzhev believes that, for example, all historical epochs are determined by new three-tier modes of thought, which include (i) concepts from general logic (ii) ethical concepts and (iii) the experiential, practical level, and these modes of thought are based on new concepts acquired through their a priori capacity. Humans are constantly interacting with their “third world”, which they “carry with themselves”, and so they are constantly “organising chaos”. At this juncture it is worth recalling Albert Camus's remark that “every great reformer tries to create in history what Shakespeare, Cervantes, Moliere and Tolstoy knew how to create: a world always ready to satisfy the hunger for freedom and dignity which every man carries in his heart”.L’Homme Revolte. Albert Camus. M. 1990. p 335 (Russian edition) Elsewhere, Camus draws our attention to the creative nature of human beings’ a priori capacity, when he says that works of art present us with “an imaginary world which, however, constitutes a correction to the real world... The novel shapes fate using a pre-prepared mould. In this way, the novel competes with God’s creation and at least temporarily triumphs over death.”.L’Homme Revolte. Albert Camus. M. 1990. p 325 (Russian edition) As we see, both in the world of art and the world of real reforms, human beings are constantly creating, “organising chaos”, lending it a form that reflects their perceptions, and over time, in the form of the reformers, reproducing these perceptions (or ideas) in reality. The same happens in everyday life, when human beings attempt to change the conditions in which they live, their relationships with other people etc. From these points, Orudzhev draws out the internal meaning of history, which boils down to the gradual “exclusion” from human nature of what has been inherited from the first (primitive) stage of the temporal existence of human beings – principally, the chief animal instinct – the instinct of strength and weakness. “Displacement” occurs in four major stages (historical epochs, each of which is an integrative experience of it) that correspond to the four levels of civilization, based on: (i) written law (antiquity), (ii) common human ethics (Middle Ages), (iii) bourgeois equality and money as a universal measure of human activity (the modern age), and (iv) finally, the nascent information age, based increasingly on human beings’ individual creative freedom (for further detail on the corresponding modes of human thought that define historical periods, see the two aforementioned books published in 2004 and 2009). As can be seen, the levels of civilisation coincide in time with the historical epochs. During the third stage of temporal being (at the post-historical stage), according to Orudzhev, human nature is free from animal instincts, and that nature is now controlled by “the instinct of mind” (Hegel's term), which is specific to “human nature” and fully corresponds to it. In this stage of temporal being, social relations between people do not originate from inherited animal instincts (which in history have taken the form of wars, slavery, dictatorships etc.), but are based on friendship as a source of new ethical relations between people, as Aristotle would have said, had he not taken an absolute view of the perceptions of non-historical time that were typical of his period (see his “Nichomachean Ethics”). Orudzhev rejects the conception of the Utopians, who believe that “human nature” is unchanging, and he also rejects the opposite conception that the essence of a human being is identical to the historically changing “sum total of public relations”, leading to the conclusion that apparently “human nature” in essence boils down to history, instead of lying at its basis, since history itself is part of human beings’ integrative experience. According to Orudzhev, the concept of human temporal being is defined by the fact that human existence is principally determined not by economic, socio-political or state factors, but by temporal factors, i.e. the time when humans started to emerge from the animal world and the extent to which humans subsequently overcame the animal world. The human mode of being characterises human attitudes to the past and human interaction with the past, since the past ( in forms language, thought, logic etc.), in contrast to what has happened in the past, always is in the present. So, at the start of the 21st century, the problem of hominids transforming into humans in the proper sense of the phrase has acquired a philosophical explanation, on the basis of the discovery of the logic governing the development of the essence of human nature – mind. In her review of Orudzhev's latest books, published in the Russian Academy of Sciences’ leading philosophical journal, T.V.Kuznetsova, professor at the Faculty of Philosophy at Lomonosov Moscow State University, noted: “Now it can be said that, in Z.M.Orudzhev’s book “Human Nature and the Sense of History”, Z.M.Orudzhev has in rather convincing form“Questions of Philosophy”.

Al-Azraqi was from a family who lived in Mecca for hundreds of years. He gave information on the design and layout of the pre-Islamic Ka'aba at Mecca after its rebuilding following a fire in 603 AD until its possession by Mohammed in 630 AD. The contents included a statue of Hubal, the principal male deity of Mecca, and a number of other pagan items, which were destroyed in 630 as idolatrous. They also included a pair of ram’s horns said to have belonged to the ram sacrificed by the Prophet Abraham in place of his son, the Prophet Ismail, and a painting (probably a fresco) of Jesus and Mary. According to Al- Azraqi, Mohammed spared these items, which survived until the destruction by the Umayyads in 683 AD. Al-Azraqi is silent on the fate of the images of trees that are known also to have decorated the interior of the Ka'aba, pictures of which formed part of the mosaic decoration on the walls of the cathedral of al-Qalis in Sana'a, and were later to emerge in the Umayyad mosaics in the Dome of the Rock, the Mosque of the Prophet in Medina, and the Great Mosque of Damascus.King, G.

This was the first elections in Liberia where women and the local Liberians owning property were allowed to vote based on a Constitutional Referendum in 1945–46. In the presidential election, William Tubman of the True Whig Party was the only candidate, and was re- elected unopposed. The previous elections used to be held in the month of May, ballots were counted during the Legislative meeting during November - December and the winning President and representatives take oath during the following January. The ballot papers used to be burnt during the interim. A new law was implemented which scrapped the practice and allowed to retain the papers until all the challenging parties of the results were satisfied. Tubman was elected unopposed for a third term in succession and took oath in January 1952. William Richard Tolbert Jr., who was his running mate in the elections became the Vice-President for the first time. History In the United States, there was a movement to resettle free-born blacks and freed slaves who faced legislated limits, in Africa and predominantly in Liberia, believing blacks would face better chances for freedom in Africa than in the U.S. The American Colonization Society was founded in 1816 in Washington, DC for this purpose, by a group of prominent politicians and slaveholders. During the mid 19th century, there were continuous clashes between Liberian government and British merchants from Sierra Leone. The merchants were of the argument that the country had no rights to impose taxes. The elites in the colony wanted to declare sovereignty to overcome the issue, resulting in the declaration. During the 1846 referendum, there was a voting on declaration of independence to the nation. On 26 July 1847, the nation declared itself independent based on the popular voting and thus became the first democratic country in Africa. Background 200x200px The Legislature of Liberia was modeled based on the Legislature of United States. It is bicameral in nature with a Senate and the House of Representatives. There are 15 counties in the country and based on the population, each county is defined to have at least two members, while the total number of members to the house including the Speaker being 64. Each member represents an electoral district and elected to a four-year term (six years after 2011 elections) based on popular vote. There were 18 senators, two each for the nine counties and they serve a six-year term (30 senators, 15 counties and nine years from 2011). Senators are also elected based on plurality of votes. The Vice-President is the head of the Senate and he also acts as President in his absence. This was the first election in Liberia where women and the local Liberians owning property were allowed to vote based on a Constitutional Referendum in 1945–46. Previously, only men of indigenous descendants were allowed to vote. The previous elections used to be held in the month of May, ballots were counted during the Legislative meeting during November - December and the winning President and representatives take oath during the following January. The ballot papers used to be burnt during the interim. A new law was implemented which scrapped the practice and allowed to retain the papers until all the challenging parties of the results were satisfied. Elections A Commemorative wrap of Presidents Tubman and Tolbert True Whig Party, founded in 1869, was one of the oldest political parties in the world and the oldest in Africa. The party was in power from 1877. The Party had a majority of Americo-Liberians, who descended from the United States and formed less than one per cent of the total population of Liberia as per the census of 1962. President William Tubman ruled from 1947 until his death in 1971 and William Tolbert continued after it. Twe emerged as an opposition to challenge the Presidency of Tubman and postulated that it was the responsibility of the United States of America to conduct free and fair elections in Liberia. He was disqualified on charges of sedition subsequently. Tubman canvassed with a theme of anti-communism and announced in an election rally that \\"it might be well that they endeavor to work out their own salvation and with fear and trembling\\". The Speaker of the House also drew examples from the US on the need to suppress Communism. The elections were held on 1 May 1951, and Tubman was elected unopposed for a third term in succession and took oath in January 1952. William Richard Tolbert Jr., who was his running mate in the elections became the Vice-President for the first time.

The Dasharath Stadium disaster is the 9th biggest stadium disaster until 2006 (in terms of human loss, 93 spectators died), and the worst stadium disaster in Nepal. Build up The Dasarath Rangasala Stadium is open terrace on three sides with the west side having the only grandstand. It hosts most of Nepal's domestic and international games and the final of the Tribhuvan Challenge Shield 1988 made no exception. 30,000 spectators were present. News reports that the weather on the day was not bad with sunshine throughout the day. Mahesh Bista, the-then executive committee member of the All Nepal Football Association, said they were initially looking forward to postpone the match but, \\"we decided to hold it as the rainy morning had changed into a sunny afternoon\\". Disaster There are often significant hailstorms in Nepal at this time of year and on this occasion large hail began to lash the crowd causing some panic. The crowd surged towards the only cover (the west stand) but were beaten back by the police. They then returned to the south terrace where a crush developed in a tunnel exit through the terrace. The crowd could not escape because the stadium doors were locked, causing a fatal crush at the front. Aftermath Despite the huge loss of life and hundreds of fans being injured, the autocratic government of Nepal at that time decided not to compensate the victims. The reason they gave was that the fans were at the stadium by their own choice and the government played no part in causing the catastrophe. After the disaster, Minister for Education and Culture Keshar Bahadur Bista and president of All Nepal Football Association, Kamal Thapa, were to resign. The Dasarath Rangasala Stadium was later renovated and updated into a football stadium with track and field stadium layout for the 1999 South Asian Games with the help from Chinese government.

He assisted Tchaikovsky with technical difficulties in the writing of the solo part in his Violin Concerto in D. He was also probably his lover at some point, although he was not exclusively homosexual. Biography Iosif Kotek was born in Kamenets-Podolsk, Ukraine, in 1855. He studied violin under Jan Hřímalý at the Moscow Conservatory, where he was also a composition student of Tchaikovsky. From the outset, their attraction was mutual. He held Tchaikovsky's music in the highest regard, and he was the composer's favourite pupil.Poznansky, p. 176 Tchaikovsky was infatuated with his student—he called him \\"Kotik\\", Russian for little tomcat—and it has been conjectured by some (and asserted unambiguously by others) that they became lovers. They certainly became physically very affectionate, as demonstrated in Tchaikovsky's 1876 letter to his brother Modest about Kotek: \\"When he caresses me with his hand, when he lies with his head inclined on my breast, and I run my hand through his hair and secretly kiss it ... passion rages within me with such unimaginable strength ... Yet I am far from the desire for a physical bond. I feel that if this happened, I would cool towards him. It would be unpleasant for me if this marvellous youth debased himself to copulation with an ageing and fat-bellied man.\\"JPE Harper-Scott, Myths and Legends of Chopin and Tchaikovsky, The Sunday Times, 7 July 2010 Kotek graduated in 1876. At that time, a wealthy widow and patron named Nadezhda von Meck asked the conservatory to provide a violinist to join her household to play chamber music and other pieces. She had eleven children, and also had a large staff including personal physicians and various musicians.Poznansky, p. 288 Nikolai Rubinstein recommended Kotek.David Mason Greene, Greene’s Biographical Encyclopedia of ComposersTchaikovsky Research Von Meck had already heard some of Tchaikovsky’s music, and liked it, and it was at Kotek’s suggestion that she contacted Tchaikovsky with a commission for some new violin pieces.Poznansky, p. 192 Kotek also made her aware of Tchaikovsky's impecunious financial circumstances. Thus started what would become one of the most remarkable artistic liaisons in musical history, a period of 14 years during which she supported him financially to become a full-time composer with no need to teach to earn a living—but they were never to meet in person. For a period, Kotek played the role of an intermediary between Nadezhda and Tchaikovsky.Poznansky, p. 196 In early 1877, Tchaikovsky wrote his Valse- Scherzo in C for Kotek,Tchaikovsky Research who may have orchestrated some or all of it. He dedicated it to Kotek on publication in 1878. Tchaikovsky married Antonina Miliukova on 18 July 1877. Alexander Poznansky states that Tchaikovsky and Kotek were in an intimate relationship at the time, and his letters to his family prior to the wedding indeed display a great sense of concern about Kotek’s welfare, compared with almost total indifference to the woman he was about to marry.Poznansky, p. 216 The sole witnesses at the wedding were his brother Anatoly and Iosif Kotek.Poznansky, p. 219 Tchaikovsky also deposited with his publisher P. Jurgenson an amount of money he had received from his patroness, to be made available to Kotek should he need it.Poznansky, p. 227 The Tchaikovsky–Miliukova marriage was doomed from the start, and they soon separated; Tchaikovsky also made a half-hearted suicide attempt. Iosif Kotek was involved in an elaborate subterfuge to keep the details of these developments from Tchaikovsky’s wider circle, including his parents.Poznansky, p. 238 This assistance only deepened the mutual attachment the composer and the violinist had for each other.Poznansky, p. 252 However, Kotek was not exclusively homosexual, perhaps not even primarily so. He was engaged in a series of amorous episodes with women in Nadezhda von Meck's large household, which caused her to become markedly cold towards him. He asked her for some financial assistance, but she refused.Poznansky, p. 254 Tchaikovsky instead came to his aid,Poznansky, p. 296 despite having been accused by Kotek of having revealed to her the true nature of their relationship. He had also contracted syphilis.Poznansky, pp. 252-253 After his dismissal by Nadezhda von Meck, Kotek went to Berlin to study with Joseph Joachim. In 1878, still recovering from the breakdown of his disastrous marriage and his subsequent suicide attempt,Classical Archives Tchaikovsky went to stay at Nadezhda von Meck's estate at Clarens, Switzerland, along with Modest and Kolya Konradi. They arrived there on 9 March, after which Kotek was summoned from Berlin. He arrived on 14 March carrying a swag of new music for violin, including Édouard Lalo's Symphonie espagnole, which he and Tchaikovsky played through to great delight. This gave Tchaikovsky the idea of writing a violin concerto, and he immediately set aside his current work on his Piano Sonata in G major and started on the concerto on 17 March. Kotek gave Tchaikovsky the benefit of his technical advice, and they would play through each new section as it was composed. The composer wrote: \\"How lovingly [Kotek] busies himself with my concerto! It goes without saying that I would have been able to do nothing without him. He plays it marvelously!\\" The whole process was finished on 28 March. On 3 April they gave the work a complete run- through, but neither of the Tchaikovsky brothers nor Kotek were satisfied with the Andante middle movement.Instant Encore It was quickly discarded (and later published separately as the Méditation in his Souvenir d'un lieu cher, Op. 42), with a new slow movement being composed in a single day, 5 April. The orchestration was finished by 11 April. Tchaikovsky wanted to dedicate the concerto to Kotek, but felt constrained by the gossip this would undoubtedly cause about the true nature of his feelings for the younger man. (He was always at pains to conceal his homosexuality from the general public.)Poznansky, p. 297 At the end of 1878, Kotek and Tchaikovsky renewed their friendship in Paris, but Tchaikovsky was deeply irritated by Kotek’s \\"unbelievable womanizing\\", and even said he found his company \\"more unpleasant than pleasant\\".Poznansky, pp. 320-321 In November 1879 he saw Kotek again in Berlin, but still found him more tiresome than attractive.Poznansky, p. 351 In October 1879, the German government offered two Mendelssohn Scholarships, one for composition, the other for practical musicianship. Kotek was the winner of the latter; the former was won by Engelbert Humperdinck.Stephen S Stratton, Mendelssohn That year, Kotek contributed to the arrangement for solo voices, chorus and piano of Tchaikovsky’s opera The Maid of Orleans.IMSLP: The Maid of Orleans In 1881, Tchaikovsky asked Kotek to perform the Violin Concerto. He refused. The work had finally been premiered that year in Vienna by Adolph Brodsky, to a notoriously scathing review from Eduard Hanslick and a muted audience response. Kotek did not want to be publicly associated with the work as it was likely to bring, as he believed, his own name into artistic disrepute. This refusal spelled the final end of their friendship. When he was in Berlin in 1883, Tchaikovsky toyed with the idea of visiting Kotek, but decided against it.Poznansky, p. 416 Kotek continued his studies with Joseph Joachim in Berlin until 1882, and then became a teacher at the Hochschule für Musik. His health deteriorated in 1884 due to tuberculosis and he went to Davos, Switzerland, for treatment. Tchaikovsky put aside their differences and visited him there in November 1884, ministering to him in various ways for six days, before returning to Moscow. He considered going back when he heard Kotek was gravely ill, but decided against it.Poznansky, pp. 444-445 Iosif Kotek died on 4 January 1885, aged only 29. Tchaikovsky was informed by telegraph, and had the painful task of informing Kotek's parents of their son's death. Kotek's compositions include \\"Six Practical Studies for the Violin\\", Op. 8.IMSLP Tchaikovsky died on 6 November 1893, which would have been Iosif Kotek's 38th birthday.

While many of them were first passed orally, several collections were published from the late 18th century. Later, some pop songs also advanced to the group.Johannes Moser: Ansätze zu einer neueren Volksliedforschung (PDF; 1,0 MB), 1989, p. 69.  History  Earliest songs in German appeared in the 12th century. Art songs were created by minstrels and meistersinger while cantastoria (Bänkelänger) sang songs in public that were orally transmitted. Song collections were written from the late 15th century, such as Lochamer-Liederbuch and Glogauer Liederbuch. Georg Forster's Frische teutsche Liedlein was printed first in 1536. In the period of Sturm und Drang, poets and authors became interested in the simple, original and close to nature (nach dem \\"Einfachen, Naturnahen, Ursprünglichen und Unverfälschten“). Johann Gottfried Herder coined the term Volkslied in the late 18th century, and published Von deutscher Art und Kunst (Of German way and art) in 1771. In 1778/79, a collection Volkslieder was published, promoted by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, which mentioned neither an editor nor authors, in an attempt to suggest the songs as an expression of the soul of the people (Äußerungen der Volksseele). In the middle of the 18th century, the Berliner Liederschule promoted songs with simple melodies im Volkston. Songs written following th concept include \\"Das Wandern ist des Müllers Lust\\" and \\"O Täler weit, o Höhen\\". In the early 20th century, the repertoire was broadened by workers' songs and students' songs. In 1914, John Meier founded the Deutsches Volksliedarchiv, a research and archive of Volkslied. The Wandervogel movement turned to singing while wandering, with the collection ' published in 1909, and reprinted until 1933.

Currently he is a visiting professor at Imperial College London where he lectures on how architecture affects well-being. He also personally organises events to promote innovation and development in the industry.  Design Approach  Mossessian has a reputation for being at the helm of new approaches and technologies. Edwin Heathcote, Architecture Critic at the Financial Times, described Mossessian as follows: \\"Very few architects are able to blend the seductively reductive commercial architecture of Mid-Century Chicago with the lightness of touch and creative flair of contemporary European design — Mossessian is at the forefront of those few.\\"\\"Sculpting the Void\\", The Architect’s Journal, Edwin Heathcote, 4 November 2010 His original Black Box method has become a staple of every project the practice delivers and ensures a shared vision from the outset. Mossessian is deeply interested in cultural localism and architecture that is concerned with far more than the buildings themselves. Propelled by his vision of creating culturally responsive architecture, he has sought out like-minded organisations, such as UNESCO and the MCC.

It is a shrub comprising two subspecies, one of which has two varieties. All three types have a limited distribution and have been classified as \\"Threatened\\". It is distinguished from other species of verticordia by its prominent, long stamens which extend well beyond its feathery yellow sepals and petals. Description Verticordia staminosa is a shrub which sometimes grows to a height of or depending on subspecies. The branches are bristly and the leaves are linear to cylindrical in shape, glabrous and long. The flowers are arranged in the upper leaf axils on a stalk long. The floral cup is hemispherical, about long, warty but glabrous. The sepals are feathery, spreading, long, lemon-yellow at first but later turn reddish. The petals are about the same colour and length as the sepals but erect and divided into feathery, finger-like lobes. The stamens and staminodes are joined to form a tube at their lower end and the stamens are long alternating with much shorter staminodes. The style is long, straight and glabrous. Flowering time is usually from July to October.Kings Park, Perth Taxonomy and naming Verticordia staminosa was first formally described by Charles Gardner and Alex George in 1963 from a specimen collected near Wongan Hills by Harry Butler and the description was published in the Journal of the Royal Society of Western Australia. The specific epithet (staminosa) refers to the prominent stamens. When Alex George reviewed the genus Verticordia in 1991, he placed this species in subgenus Chrysoma, the only species in section Synandra. George described three forms of this species: *Verticordia staminosa subsp. staminosa which has stamens long; *Verticordia staminosa subsp. cylindracea var. cylindracea which is a shrub with widely spreading branches and stamens long; *Verticordia staminosa subsp. cylindracea var. erecta which is an erect shrub with pine-like leaves and stamens long. Distribution and habitat Verticordia staminosa grows in soil in crevices on exposed granite outcrops. Subspecies staminosa is only known from a single locality in the Wongan Hills, variety cylindracea between Newdegate and Pingaring and variety erecta in a small area north-west of Newdegate. Verticordia staminosa is commonly known as Wongan verticordia and is only known from about 1200 plants. Relatively large numbers of seedling establish each year and its rarity is thought to be a result of climate change and increased frequency of fire. Conservation All three forms of V. staminosa are classified as \\"Threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that it they are in danger of extinction. Use in horticulture Verticordia staminosa can be readily propagated from cuttings these are initially often slow-growing in their first year in the garden.

It was built for the demand of the coal industry to process the coal coming from the mines of Péronnes, Ressaix and Trivières. It was capable processing over 3,000 tons of coal daily. In 1969 the nearby coal mines in Saint-Albert and Sint-Margriete were closed, which caused Triage-Lavoir to become useless, and it was closed down after only 15 years of active operation. Immediately after closing the facility, all the machines and equipment were removed and the facility stayed abandoned for over 3 decades. The building was under threat of demolition in 2000 but on May 15, 2003, it was classified as a monument to be saved. Currently the building is under renovation financed by the European Union and the Walloon Region through the Marshall Plan of Wallonia program. The renovation started in September 2005. Alt URL The renovation of the exterior of the building was scheduled to be finished by September 2006. The budget for the walls was 2.1 million euros.

He is especially known for his 1979 song Säpinää (”Breaking Away”), which included chainsaw sounds. Chainsaws became one of his trademarks. In the 1970s Perusjätkä (literally “Ordinary guy”) worked with the most notable figures in the Finnish rock scene, known especially for his pairing with Ralf Örn. His first band was called Maukka and Nahkatakit (Literally “Maukka and Leather Jackets”). His first record was released under the name Maukka Perusjätkä Ja Sota Apatiaa Vastaan (”Maukka Ordinary Guy and the War against Apathy”). After the 1980s, Perusjätkä became less active in the music scene. Although a rebel in his youth, Perusjätkä became a symbol for conservative values and a Finnish mindset of knives and booze. Perusjätkä has recently released a recording, yet nowadays most of his Finnish fanbase goes to pubs. Perusjätkä was most widely known for his songs Säpinää, Vaatteet on mun aatteet (Clothes Are My Ideology), Herneenpalot (Pea Pods), and the album Mauka & Iles Disko.

It was first formally described by Don McGillivray in 1975. He named it cyranostigma after Edmond Rostand's Cyrano de Bergerac, as its long stigma was reminiscent of the character's protruding nose. The type specimen was collected between 1890 and 1895 by Harriette Biddulph of Mount Playfair Station, who was known for her collection of plants from the Carnarvon Range. The species appears to be related to Grevillea sericea and G. victoriae, and is distinguished by glossier leaves than the former and a less hairy perianth than both.* Grevillea cyranostigma grows as a many-branched spreading shrub reaching 0.5 to 2 m (20 in to 7 ft) high. It has simple glossy leaves that are roughly oblong and are 2–5.5 cm (0.8–2.2 in) long and 0.5–1.1 cm (0.2–0.4 in) wide. The pale green flowers appear in winter and spring from June to October. Each is an inflorescence composed of several individual flowers, with pistils that are 16 to 17.5 mm long. The flowers are followed by the development of oval follicles 14–15 mm in length. The species is restricted to the Carnarvon Range in Central Queensland, where it is found on rocky slopes on sandstone soils in dry sclerophyll forest. It is classified as 3RC, as it is protected in Carnarvon National Park. Grevillea cyranostigma has been grown in gardens in Brisbane and Melbourne and appears to adapt readily to cultivation, although does not tolerate extended dry periods.

France Paris 1944: Women accused of collaboration with Nazis are paraded through the streets. In the occupation years, as the French dealt with their humiliating defeat and surrender, the morality of sex in the Vichy occupation changed. In his book 1940–1945, The Erotic Years: Vichy, or, the Misfortunes of Virtue, Patrick Buisson talks about “erotic shock ... or exploring new territories of pleasure.\\" After the occupation he writes about French prisoners bedding local German girls, while back in their homeland French women had intimate relations with their German occupiers. Local cinemas and even subway stations became locations for anonymous physical trysts during Allied bombings. After Allied liberation, anyone who had a reputation for associating with the Germans were targeted as collaborators, and faced hazing or worse. Germany Within Germany in the 1930s, many German Protestants and Catholics shared the view that Jewish people were responsible for the sexual immorality that pervaded Weimar Culture. Many church leaders, in fact, supported the Nazis, welcoming radical measures against “public immorality” that included shutting down brothels, gay and lesbian bars, and nudist organizations.Dagmar Herzog, Sexuality in Europe: A Twentieth Century History (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011), 71. The initial support of the leadership of both the Catholic and Protestant churches was based on the belief that the Nazis would purify German sexual mores and reinstitute respect for family values.Herzog, Sexuality, 71 In the early 1900s, Germany, and particularly Berlin, developed a reputation for relaxed sexual mores; as Dagmar Herzog writes in Sexuality In Europe: A Twentieth Century History, “There was more detailed discussion of the best techniques for enhancing female orgasm under Nazism than there would be in the far more conservative decade of the 1950s.”Herzog, Sexuality, 72 The flipside to liberalization for some was crackdowns on others.Herzog, Sexuality, 72 By the 1930s, Nazi leadership was increasingly anxious about being perceived as “queer”.Herzog, Sexuality, 73 In 1934, Hitler facilitated the murder of a friend and leader of the paramilitary wing of the Nazi Party, an openly gay man, Ernst Röhm. Until that time, many bars frequented by members of the Sturmabteilung were well known as gay bars, and there was no perceived tension between activism espousing greater rights for homosexuals and right-wing politics.Herzog, Sexuality, 73 The prevalence of same-sex institutions like Hitler Youth and the League of German Girls fostered suspicions of homoeroticism, and subsequently the regime tried to prove its straightness. All of that would change, however, when the virulently homophobic Heinrich Himmler became one of the most powerful people in the Reich.Herzog, Sexuality, 73 In 1935, Nazis strengthened laws on the books that criminalized male (but not female) homosexuality. Not only mutual masturbation but parallel individual masturbation and even “erotic” glances fell under the purview of the law.Herzog, Sexuality, 73. Penalties for homosexual behavior escalated considerably by 1937. By the end of the war, approximately 100,000 men had been prosecuted for same-sex behavior. Close to half had been convicted, sent to labor camps, prisons, or penitentiaries, subjected to medical experiments, or forced to have sex with female prostitutes.Herzog, Sexuality, 74. Many Jewish people who were held captive would realize a similar fate.Herzog, Sexuality, 67. The association between sex, homosexuality, and Jewish people was supported by Catholic and Protestant church leaders and ultimately the Nazi regime.Herzog, Sexuality, 71. While not all activists who fought for the legalization of abortion and homosexuality were Jewish, many were, and their leadership in these movements made them easy targets of religious vitriol. Nazism exploited this anger.Herzog, Sexuality, 67 Sexual innuendo was a vital component of Nazi anti-Semitism, exploiting sentiment that readily associated Jewish people with sex.Herzog, Sexuality, 67. The reorganization of sexuality was at the heart of the Nazi project. It would be a mischaracterization, however, to declare that the Third Reich was repressive for everyone. For those who did not fall prey to its animus, the Nazi regime’s overall goal was not to suppress sexuality, but to foster it as a distinctly Aryan privilege.Herzog, Sexuality, 70. While structural racism of any kind has always necessarily depended on controlling reproduction, this was especially true of the Third Reich. Restrictions on contraception and abortion coaxed the reproduction of those deemed “healthy” to further the Volk, or race, who were ushered along through financial incentives and propagandistic enticements, while those deemed unfit to reproduce were prohibited from doing so with sterilization, involuntary abortion, and mass murder.Herzog, Sexuality, 70. By the early 1940s, it was no secret that the regime was openly encouraging extramarital sex and marital infidelity, endorsing it not only as a reproductive measure, but also as a pursuit of pleasure reserved exclusively for the racially pure.Herzog, Sexuality, 72. Abortions were denied to the majority of German women, while coercive abortions were violently imposed on Roma and Jewish women. Nazi sexual politics harnessed two competing tendencies, playing into either when politically expedient: conservative currents of consternation and concern with sex on the one hand, and the greater historical trend of liberalization of heterosexual norms on the other, in order to execute a viciously homophobic and racist agenda.Herzog, Sexuality, 70 The German birth rate, like that in most industrial nations, had been falling for decades. When Hitler and the Nazi Party took power in 1933 they implemented several revolutionary policies in order to change the sexual practices of the German people and reverse this slide in birth rates. At the same time that it forbade the mixing of Jews and Germans through the Nuremberg Laws, the Nazi government tried a number of policies designed to increase new births. One action was to change the marriage laws via the 1938 divorce-reform law by the Minister of Justice, Franz Gürtner. Within two years 30,000 divorces were filed, 80% of which were husbands casting off women over 45 years old. While the divorce law increased new marriages and children from these marriages, the Nazis looked to illegitimate births in Germany as a way to increase Germany's birthrate. In the 1920s, there were about 150,000 illegitimate births in Germany, before halving during the depression and bouncing up to 100,000 in 1935. The Nazis wanted to increase the illegitimate births by encouraging out of wedlock births, especially those of Aryan heritage. Part official policy, part propaganda, the Nazi policy manifested itself in the Lebensborn program. The Lebensborn program provided a place where pregnant mothers could have their babies out of wedlock in secret. Christening of a Lebensborn child Only the most \\"pure\\" of its applicants were chosen to join its programs. Of all the women who applied, only 40 percent passed the racial purity test (they had to show their family tree three generations back) and were granted admission to the Lebensborn program. The majority of mothers were unmarried, 57.6 percent until 1939, and about 70 percent by 1940. The Lebensborn program was given a further push when Himmler issued a proclamation that every SS soldier should father a child before he left for war. The child could then be born and raised at the Lebensborn facilities. Through these policies the birth rate increased and Himmler told his doctor Kerstern how proud he was to have a role in the change, \\"Only a few years ago illegitimate children were considered a shameful matter ... [now] my men tell me with shining eyes that a son has been born to them. Their girls consider it an honour, not a source of shame.\\" Once World War II broke out and men were sent to the front, the Nazis changed their promise of \\"every woman will have a man\\" to \\"every woman will have a child\\". A report to the Ministry of Justice in 1944 stated that: > Leaders of the [League of German Girls have] intimated to their girls that > they should bear illegitimate children; these leaders have pointed out that > in view of the prevailing shortage of men, not every girl could expect to > get a husband in future, and that the girls should at least fulfill their > task as German women and donate a child to the Führer. As a mark of how much sexual attitudes had changed by the end of the war, 23% of all young Germans were infected with a venereal disease, and prostitution had quadrupled, including male and female prostitution, as the Allies were many times more willing to have sexual relations with a male (who could not get pregnant). A number of scandals, including males caught naked/sexually involved with other males, caused some of the male prostitutes to be shipped to smaller towns or islands, where they were the majority of men there and they caused many families to break up, given their proclivity to maintain a strong homosexual identity through relationships with males they had found in smaller towns. Often, this proclivity developed as the consequence of rape by Allied soldiers or the harsh living conditions which drove huge numbers of starving Germans into prostitution just to survive. Had the Germans triumphed, Himmler and Bormann were considering a post-war institution of double marriage for Nazi party officials and war heroes.

Dietary Variety, Energy Regulation, and Obesity. Psychological Bulletin 2001; 127: 325-341. full text The phenomenon was first described in 1956Le Magnen J. Hyperphagie provoquée chez le Rat blanc par altération du mécanisme de satiété périphérique. Comptes Rendus des Séances de la Société de Biologie (Paris) 1956; 150(1): 32–35. by the French physiologist Jacques Le Magnen. The term was coined in 1981Rolls BJ, Rolls ET, Rowe EA, Sweeney K. Sensory specific satiety in man. Physiol Behav. 1981;27(1):137-42. by Barbara J. Rolls and Edmund T. Rolls. Its concept illustrates the role of physical stimuli in generating appetite and, more specifically, explains the significance of taste in relation to hunger.Gray P. 2007. Psychology. Fifth Edition. Worth Publishers. table of contents Besides conditioned satiety and alimentary alliesthesia, it is one of the three major phenomena of satiation. Diners at a buffet eat a larger quantity of food than those eating a single dish This process is most commonly illustrated by a standard buffet. People are more likely to eat a larger amount of food at a buffet because the variety of foods and flavors presented renews a sense of appetite in the individual. A study conducted by Rolls and van Duijvenvoorde in 1984 verified this process by simulating a buffet-style meal. They fed participants four meals that included sausages, bread and butter, chocolate dessert, and bananas. They then fed the participants four courses of one of these foods. The results revealed a 44% increase in overall food consumption when exposed to the meals with a variety of foods. Postingestive feedback factors such as energy density and nutrient composition could affect the palatability of a food which in turn would inhibit or facilitate sensory- specific satiety. Studies done by Birch & Deysher (1986) and B.J. Rolls et al., summarized in a paper by Raynor and Epstein, show that postingesitive feedback does not influence sensory-specific satiety very much. Since postingestive feedback seems to have little effect of sensory-specific satiety, it is probable that sensory-specific satiety is more driven by external factors, such as the sensory properties of the food, than internal factors.  Obesity in relation to sensory-specific satiety  Studies have shown that eating monotonous meals (limited variety in food) results in long- term sensory-specific satiety.* Raynor HA, Niemeier HM, Wing RR. Effect of limiting snack food variety on long-term sensory-specific satiety and monotony during obesity treatment. Eating Behaviors 2006; 7(1):1-14. abstract By continuing to eat similar meals, a dieter can reduce their overall food intake and use sensory-specific satiety as a tool for weight loss. On the contrary, sensory-specific satiety can also cause obesity because of the stimulation of hunger for foods of different variety. The higher energy content the food has, the less likely sensory-specific satiety will become activated.Rolls BJ, Van Duijvenvoorde PM, Rowe EA. Variety in the diet enhances intake in a meal and contributes to the development of obesity in the rat. Physiology & Behavior 1983; 31(1):21-7. abstract  Age in relation to sensory-specific satiety  Sensory-specific satiety varies depending on age, with the elderly experiencing decreased sensory-specific satiety and adolescents experiencing more.Rolls BJ, McDermott TM. Effect of age on sensory-specific satiety. Am J Clin Nutr 1991; 54(6): 988-996. abstract In a study focusing on age in sensory-specific satiety, it was hypothesized that the degree of sensory- specific satiety is affected by age due to the slow sensory loss that accompanies elderly people. By hypothesis, due to the sensory impairment, a natural, more monotonous diet would occur just due to lack of pleasantness from variety of foods. However, it was proven that sensory impairment did not greatly affect the decline in sensory-specific satiety; instead, there is an unclear cognitive process that relates to decline in sensory-specific satiety that just may be the decreased desire for overall change in the elderly as compared to adolescents.

Named after Dampierre, in the Champagne region, where members first became prominent, members of the family were later Count of Flanders, Count of Nevers, Counts and Dukes of Rethel, Count of Artois and Count of Franche-Comté. As a senior line, the House died out with Margaret III. She was succeeded in Flanders, Artois, Nevers and Franche-Comté by her eldest son John the Fearless and in Rethel by her younger son Anthony, which marked the start of the House of Valois-Burgundy. The junior line, springing from a younger son of Guy I reigning in Namur, ended in 1429. The earliest known member of the House of Dampierre is Guy I of Dampierre, great-grandson of Guy I of Montlhéry through his son Milo I of Montlhéry. The members of the House of Dampierre had an antagonistic relation with the House of Avesnes. Origin of the House: feud between Dampierre and Avesnes Baldwin, the first emperor of the Latin Empire of Constantinople, was as Baldwin IX Count of Flanders and as Baldwin VI Count of Hainaut. Baldwin had only daughters and was in turn succeeded by his daughters Joan (reigned 1205-1244) and Margaret II (reigned 1244-1280). In 1212 Margaret II married Bouchard d'Avesnes, a prominent Hainaut nobleman. This was apparently a love match, though it was approved by Margaret's sister Joan, who had herself recently married. The two sisters subsequently had a falling-out over Margaret's share of their inheritance, which led Joan to attempt to get Margaret's marriage dissolved. She alleged that the marriage was invalid, and without much inspection of the facts of the case Pope Innocent III condemned the marriage, though he did not formally annul it. Bouchard and Margaret continued as a married couple, having 3 children, as their conflict with Joan grew violent and Bouchard was captured and imprisoned in 1219. He was released in 1221 on the condition that the couple separate and that Bouchard get absolution from the pope. While he was in Rome, Joan convinced Margaret to remarry, this time to William II of Dampierre, a nobleman from Champagne. From this marriage Margaret had two sons: William II, Count of Flanders and Guy of Dampierre. This situation caused something of a scandal, for the marriage was possibly bigamous, and violated the church's strictures on consanguinity as well. The disputes regarding the validity of the two marriages and the legitimacy of her children by each husband continued for decades, becoming entangled in the politics of the Holy Roman Empire and resulting in the long War of the Succession of Flanders and Hainault. In 1246 king Louis IX of France, acting as an arbitrator, gave the right to inherit Flanders to the Dampierre children, and the rights to Hainaut to the Avesnes children. This would seem to have settled the matter, but in 1253 problems arose again. The eldest son, John I of Avesnes, who was uneasy about his rights, convinced William of Holland, the German king recognized by the pro-papal forces, to seize Hainaut and the parts of Flanders which were within the bounds of the empire. William of Holland was theoretically, as king, overlord for these territories, and also John's brother-in-law. A civil war followed, which ended when the Avesnes forces defeated and imprisoned the Dampierres at the Battle of West-Capelle of 4 July 1253, after which John I of Avesnes was able to force Guy of Dampierre and his mother to respect the division of Louis and grant him Hainault. Margaret did not rest in her defeat and did not recognise herself as overcome. She instead granted Hainault to Charles of Anjou, the brother of King Louis, who had recently returned from the crusade. Charles took up her cause and warred with John I of Avesnes, but failed to take Valenciennes and just missed being killed in a skirmish. When Louis returned in 1254, he reaffirmed his earlier arbitration and ordered his brother to get out of the conflict. Charles returned to Provence. With this second arbitration of the holy king, the conflict closed and John I of Avesnes was secure in Hainault. The following decades saw further strife between the Dampierres and the Avesnes, who by the start of the 14th century had also inherited the County of Holland and Zeeland.

Through Louis II's mother, a daughter of King Philip V of France, the counties of Artois and Burgundy (the \\"Franche Comté\\") were added to this. These lands were to provide the core of the dominions of the House of Valois-Burgundy, which were, together with the Duchy of Burgundy, to provide them with a power base to challenge the rule of their cousins, the Valois kings of France in the 15th century. Counts of Namur In 1263, the count of Namur, Baldwin II of Courtenay, sold his county to Guy I of Dampierre. Guy in turn gave over the county on his death to his younger son John I from his marriage to his second wife Isabelle of Luxembourg. The house of Dampierre would rule Namur until 1421, when the county of Namur was sold to the Burgundian duke Philip the Good.

As the Japanese advanced towards New Guinea in early 1942, the RAAF urgently established three new fighter units for Australia's northern defence, Nos. 75, 76 and 77 Squadrons.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 139–141 Jackson was promoted to acting squadron leader and appointed commanding officer (CO) of No. 75 Squadron on 19 March, barely two weeks after the unit was formed at Townsville, Queensland.Thomas, Tomahawk and Kittyhawk Aces, pp. 50–55 He took over from Wing Commander Peter Jeffrey, who had led No. 3 Squadron in the Middle East and been given the task of preparing No. 75 for operations at Port Moresby, where the local Australian Army garrison was under regular attack by Japanese bombers.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 458–462 Jeffrey later recalled chiding Jackson for his eagerness to return to combat despite having already done enough in the war, to which the latter replied, \\"What are you fighting for? King and country? Well, I'm fighting for my wife and kids and no Jap bastard's going to get them!\\"Johnston, Whispering Death, pp. 155–156, 470 On 21 March, Jackson led the squadron's main force to Seven Mile Aerodrome to take part in the defence of Port Moresby, a crucial early battle in the New Guinea campaign, and what military aviation historian Andrew Thomas called \\"one of the most gallant episodes in the history of the RAAF\\". The unit was equipped with P-40 Kittyhawks, whose long-awaited arrival had seen them irreverently dubbed \\"Tomorrowhawks\\", \\"Neverhawks\\", and \\"Mythhawks\\" by the beleaguered garrison at Moresby. Jackson's age of thirty-four was considered advanced for a fighter pilot, and he was affectionately known as \\"Old John\\" to his men, one of whom was his younger brother Les, now a flight lieutenant. As CO, Jackson's leadership was to prove inspirational to his pilots, many of whom had received only nine days of training in fighter tactics, and fired their guns just once. alt=Sign with an eagle on top, reading \\"Memory Lane In memory of R.A.A.F personnel who have flown to a higher level 'Per ardua ad astra'\\", and a list of those killed On 22 March, the day after he arrived in New Guinea, Jackson took No. 75 Squadron on a dawn raid against the Japanese airfield at Lae. Rather than attacking directly from the south, he led the Kittyhawks in from the east, where they would not be expected and where the rising sun would hide their approach. Achieving the surprise he had hoped for, Jackson made two strafing passes over the airfield, ignoring standard practice that called for only one such pass to reduce the risk from anti-aircraft fire.Ewer, Storm Over Kokoda, p. 122–127 The Australians claimed a dozen Japanese planes destroyed on the ground and five more damaged. They also shot down two Mitsubishi Zero fighters in the air, and lost two Kittyhawks over Lae, along with one that had crash-landed on takeoff from Moresby. The Japanese struck back the next day, destroying two Kittyhawks at Seven Mile Aerodrome. With his losses mounting, Jackson was given permission to withdraw the squadron to Horn Island in Far North Queensland, but refused. On 4 April, Jackson made a solo reconnaissance over Lae, after which he led another four Kittyhawks on a raid against the airfield, claiming seven enemy aircraft destroyed on the ground without loss to themselves; Japanese sources credited the Australians with only two machines destroyed, but seventeen others damaged. Two days later, Les Jackson was forced to ditch his aircraft on a coral reef, but made it to shore with the aid of a life jacket that John dropped to him, not realising at the time that the downed pilot was his younger brother.Ewer, Storm Over Kokoda, pp. 155–157Johnston, Whispering Death, p. 169 Jackson himself had to ditch into the sea on 10 April, when he was shot down after being surprised by three Zeros during another of his solo reconnaissance missions near Lae. After playing dead beside his crashed plane to discourage the Japanese fighters from machine-gunning him, he swam to shore and made his way through jungle for over a week to Wau, with the help of two New Guinea natives. When he arrived back at Port Moresby in a US Douglas Dauntless on 23 April, a Japanese air raid was in progress and a bullet cut off the tip of his right index finger.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 543–546 Having survived his trek through the jungle, he dismissed the wound as \\"a mere scratch\\".The Defence of Moresby at Australia's War 1939–1945 .

On 27 April, Jackson met with his pilots and revealed that some senior RAAF officers had expressed dissatisfaction with the way in which No. 75 Squadron was avoiding dogfighting with the Japanese Zeros. Jackson and his men had generally eschewed such tactics owing to the Zero's superiority to the Kittyhawk in close combat. The senior officers' comments had evidently stung him, as he declared to his pilots: \\"Tomorrow I'm going to show you how\\".Ewers, Storm Over Kokoda, pp. 187, 200Johnston, Whispering Death, pp. 174–176 According to journalist Osmar White, who saw him on the night of the 27th, Jackson's \\"hands and eyes were still and rock steady\\" but he appeared \\"weary in soul\\" and \\"too long in the shadows\\". White concluded: \\"He had done more than conquer fear—he had killed it\\".Ewer, Storm Over Kokoda, p. 202 The next day, Jackson led No. 75 Squadron's five remaining airworthy Kittyhawks to intercept a force of Japanese bombers and their escort. He destroyed an enemy fighter before being shot down and killed.Johnston, Whispering Death, p. 452Gillison (1962), Newton (1996) and Garrisson (1999) express doubt as to whether responsibility for the destruction of the Japanese fighter on 28 April 1942 belonged to Jackson or to another Australian shot down in the same battle. The most recent works cited, Stephens (2001/2006), Thomas (2005), and Johnston (2011), all unequivocally ascribe this last victory to Jackson. His aircraft hit the side of a mountain and embedded itself six feet; Jackson was identified only by his size-ten boots and the revolver he habitually wore.Ewer, Storm Over Kokoda, p. 204 His final tally of aerial victories during the war was eight.Thomas, Tomahawk and Kittyhawk Aces, p. 103.

Although sometimes dynamic strain aging is used interchangeably with the Portevin–Le Chatelier effect (or serrated yielding), dynamic strain aging refers specifically to the microscopic mechanism that induces the Portevin–Le Chatelier effect. This strengthening mechanism is related to solid-solution strengthening and has been observed in a variety of fcc and bcc substitutional and interstitial alloys, metalloids like silicon, and ordered intermetallics within specific ranges of temperature and strain rate.Mesarovic, Sinisa (1995)\\"Dynamic Strain Aging and Plastic Instabilities.\\" J. Mech. Phys. Solids 43:671–701 No. 5 Description of mechanism In materials, the motion of dislocations is a discontinuous process. When dislocations meet obstacles during plastic deformation (such as particles or forest dislocations), they are temporarily arrested for a certain time. During this time, solutes (such as interstitial particles or substitutional impurities) diffuse around the pinned dislocations, further strengthening the obstacles' hold on the dislocations. Eventually these dislocations will overcome the obstacles with sufficient stress and will quickly move to the next obstacle where they are stopped and the process can repeat.Van Den Beukel, A. (1975)\\"Theory of the Effect of Dynamic Strain Aging on Mechanical Properties\\". Phys. Stat. Sol.

The resulting region of lower solute concentration above the slip plane weakens the material in the region near the pinned dislocation, such that when the dislocation becomes mobile again, the stress required to move it is temporarily reduced. This effect can manifest as serrations in the stress-strain curve (Portevin-Le Chatelier effect). Stress field around an edge dislocation core, with schematic atomic positions overlaid. The filled circles represent larger substitutional impurities, which are driven across the slip plane during dynamic strain aging (shown by the arrow). Because solute diffusion is thermally activated, increases in temperature can increase the rate and range of diffusion around a dislocation core. This can result in more severe stress drops, typically marked by a transition from Type A to Type C serrations.Pink, E., Grinberg, A. (1981) \\"Serrated flow in a ferritic stainless steel,\\" Materials Science and Engineering 51 iss. 1, p.1-8 Material property effects Although serrations in the stress–strain curve caused by the Portevin–Le Chatelier effect are the most visible effect of dynamic strain aging, other effects may be present when this effect is not seen. Often when serrated flow is not seen, dynamic strain aging is marked by a lower strain rate sensitivity. That becomes negative in the Portevin–Le Chatelier regime.Hahner, Peter (1996)\\"On the physics of the Portevin- Le Chatelier effect part 1: the Statistics of dynamic strain aging\\" Materials Science and Engineering A207: Dynamic strain aging also causes a plateau in the strength, a peak in flow stressMannan, S.L.(1993) \\"Role of dynamic stain aging on low cycle fatigue\\".

Effect of alloying elements on DSA Two categories can be distinguished by the interaction pathway. The first class of Elements, such as carbon(C) and nitrogen(N), contribute to DSA directly by diffusing quickly enough through the lattice to the dislocations and locking them. Such effect is determined with the element’s solubility, diffusion coefficient, and the interaction energy between the elements and dislocations, i.e. the severity of dislocation locking. Elements of the second category affect DSA by altering the behavior of the first-class elements. Some substitutional solute atoms, like Mn, Mo, and Cr, stress-induced ordering of substitutional-interstitial pairs, and thus reduce the mobility of carbon and nitrogen. Some elements, for example, Ti, Zr, and Nb introduce carbides, nitrides and so on, which then shift the DSA region to higher temperature zone. Sandra Cunninghham (1999), \\"Effect of substitutional elements on dynamic strain aging in steel\\",McGill University. Types of DSA Serrations At least five classes can be identified according to the stress-strain relation appearance of Serration. Type A Arising from the repeated nucleation of shear bands and the continuous propagation of Lüders bands, this type consists of periodic locking serrations with abrupt increase in flow stress followed by drop of stress below the general level of the stress-strain curve. It is usually seen in the low temperature (high strain rate) part of the DS regime. Type B Result from the nucleation of narrow shear bands, which propagate discontinuously or do not propagate due to the adjacent nucleation sites, and thus oscillate about the general level of the flow curve. It occurs at higher temperature or lower strain rates than type A. It may also be developed from type A when it comes to higher strain. Type C Caused by dislocation unlocking, the stress drop of type C is below the general level of the flow curve. It occurs at even higher temperature and lower strain comparation to A and B type. Type D When there is no work hardening, a plateau on the stress-strain curve is seen and therefore is also named staircase type. This type forms a mixed mode with type B. Type E Occurring at higher strain after type A, type E is not easy to be recognized. Material specific example of dynamic strain aging Dynamic strain aging has been shown to be linked to these specific material problems: *Decrease the fracture resistance of Al–Li alloys. *Decrease low cycle fatigue life of austenitic stainless steels and super-alloys under test conditions which are similar to the service conditions in liquid-metal-cooled fast breeder reactors in which the material is used.2) Mannan, S.L., \\"Role of dynamic stain aging on low cycle fatigue\\" Material Science vol 16 no 5 December 1993 p561-582 *Reduce fracture toughness by 30–40% and shorten the air fatigue life of RPC steels and may worsen the cracking resistance of steels in aggressive environments.

The home in Nice still bears a plaque to show his habitation of the property. He had a grip upon the Ottoman Empire as the Sultan by all accounts was weak, having inherited the title from his brother Abdülaziz. He is buried in the courtyard where the tomb of Mahmud II is located as well as other notable gentlemen of that period. In 1867, he graduated from Mekteb-i Harbiye with the rank of Mülâzımı.

They were the ultimate versions of a series of devices tracing their history to the original pinch machines, built at Imperial College London by Cousins and Ware in 1947. When the UK's fusion work was classified in 1950, Ware's team was moved to the Associated Electrical Industries (AEI) labs at Aldermaston. The team worked on the problems associated with using metal tubes with high voltages, in support of the efforts at Harwell. When Harwell's ZETA machine apparently produced fusion, AEI quickly built a smaller machine, Sceptre, to test their results. Sceptre also produced neutrons, apparently confirming the ZETA experiment. It was later found that the neutrons were spurious, and UK work on Z-pinch ended in the early 1960s. History Background :For a detailed history of pinch in the UK, see ZETA Fusion research in the UK started on a shoestring budget at Imperial College in 1946. When George Paget Thomson failed to gain funding from John Cockcroft's Atomic Energy Research Establishment (AERE), he turned over the project to two students, Stan Cousins and Alan Ware. They started working on the concept in January 1947,Allibone, p. 17 using a glass tube and old radar parts. Their small experimental device was able to generate brief flashes of light. However, the nature of the light remained a mystery as they could not come up with a method of measuring its temperature.Herman, p. 40 Little interest was shown in the work, although it was noticed by Jim Tuck, who was interested in all things fusion. He, in turn, introduced the concepts to Peter Thonemann, and the two developed a similar small machine of their own at Oxford University's Clarendon Laboratory. Tuck left for the University of Chicago before the device was built.Herman, p. 41 After moving to Los Alamos, Tuck introduced the pinch concept there, and eventually built the Perhapsatron along the same lines. In early 1950 Klaus Fuchs' admitted to turning UK and US atomic secrets over to the USSR. As fusion devices would generate copious amounts of neutrons, which could be used to enrich nuclear fuel for atomic bombs, the UK immediately classified all their fusion work. The research was considered important enough to continue, but it was difficult to maintain secrecy in a university setting. The decision was made to move both teams to secure locations. Imperial team under Ware was set up at the Associated Electrical Industries (AEI) labs at Aldermaston in November while the Oxford team under Thonemann were moved to UKAEA Harwell.Thomson, p. 12 Perhaps the earliest photograph of the kink instability in action - the 3 by 25 pyrex tube at Aldermaston. By 1951 there were numerous pinch devices in operation; Cousins and Ware had built several follow-on machines, Tuck built his Perhapsatron, and another team at Los Alamos built a linear machine known as Columbus. It was later learned that Fuchs had passed information about the early UK work to the Soviets, and they had started a pinch program as well. By 1952 it was clear to everyone that something was wrong in the machines. As current was applied, the plasma would first pinch down as expected, but would then develop a series of \\"kinks\\", evolving into a sinusoidal shape. When the outer portions hit the walls of the container, a small amount of the material would spall off into the plasma, cooling it and ruining the reaction. This so- called \\"kink instability\\" appeared to be a fundamental problem. Practical work At Aldermaston, the Imperial team was put under the direction of Thomas Allibone. Compared to the team at Harwell, the Aldermaston team decided to focus on faster pinch systems. Their power supply consisted of a large bank of capacitors with a total capacity of 66,000 Joules (when fully expanded) switched by spark gaps that could dump the stored power into the system at high speeds. Harwell's devices used slower rising pinch currents, and had to be larger to reach the same conditions.Thonemann, p. 34 One early suggestion to solve the kink instability was to use highly conductive metal tubes for the vacuum chamber instead of glass. As the plasma approached the walls of the tube, the moving current would induce a magnetic field in the metal. This field would, due to Lenz's law, opposed the motion of the plasma toward it, hopefully slowing or stopping its approach to the sides of the container. Tuck referred to this concept as \\"giving the plasma a backbone\\". Allibone, originally from Metropolitan-Vickers, had worked on metal-walled X-ray tubes that used small inserts of porcelain to insulate them electrically. He suggested trying the same thing for the fusion experiments, potentially leading to higher temperatures than the glass tubes could handle. They started with an all-porcelain tube of 20 cm major axis, and were able to induce 30 kA of current into the plasma before it broke up. Following this they built an aluminum version, which was split into two parts with mica inserts between them. This version suffered arcing between the two halves. Convinced that the metal tube was the way ahead, the team then started a long series of experiments with different materials and construction techniques to solve the arcing problem. By 1955 they had developed one with 64 segments that showed promise, and using 60 kJ capacitor bank they were able to induce 80 kA discharges.Review, p. 170 Although the tube was an improvement, it also suffered from the same kink instabilities, and work on this approach was abandoned.Allibone, p. 18 To better characterize the problem, the team started construction of a larger aluminum torus with a 12-inch bore and 45 inch diameter, and inserted two straight sections to stretch it into a racetrack shape. The straight sections, known as the \\"pepper pot\\", had a series of holes drilled in them, angled so they all pointed to a single focal point some distance from the apparatus. A camera placed at the focal point was able to image the entire plasma column, greatly improving their understanding of the instability process. Studying the issue, Shavranov, Taylor and Rosenbluth all developed the idea of adding a second magnetic field to the system, a steady- state toroidal field generated by magnets circling the vacuum tube. The second field would force the electrons and deuterons in the plasma to orbit the lines of force, reducing the effects of small imperfections in the field generated by the pinch itself. This sparked off considerable interest in both the US and UK. Thomson, armed with the possibility of a workable device and obvious interest in the US, won approval for a very large machine, ZETA. Sceptre At Aldermaston, using the same information, Ware's team calculated that with the 60 kJ available in the existing capacitor bank, they would reach the required conditions in a copper-covered quartz tube 2 inches in bore and 10 inches in diameter, or an all-copper version 2 inches in bore and 18 inches across. Work on both started in parallel, as Sceptre I and II. However, before either was completed, the ZETA team at Harwell had already achieved stable plasmas in August 1957. The Aldermaston team raced to complete their larger photographic system. Electrical arcing and shorting between the tube segments became a problem, but the team had already learned that \\"dry firing\\" the apparatus hundreds of times would reduce this effect.Review, p. 174 After addressing the arcing, further experiments demonstrated temperatures around 1 million degrees.Allibone, p. 19 The system worked as expected, producing clear images of the kink instabilities using high-speed photography and argon gas so as to produce a bright image. The team then removed the straight sections, added stabilization magnets, and re-christened the machine Sceptre III. In December they started experimental runs like those on ZETA. By measuring the spectral lines of oxygen, they calculated interior temperatures of 2 to 3.5 million degrees. Photographs through a slit in the side showed the plasma column remaining stable for 300 to 400 microseconds, a dramatic improvement on previous efforts. Working backward, the team calculated that the plasma had an electrical resistivity around 100 times that of copper, and was able to carry 200 kA of current for 500 microseconds in total. When the current was over 70 kA, neutrons were observed in roughly the same numbers as ZETA. As in the case of ZETA, it was soon learned that the neutrons were being produced by a spurious source, and the temperatures were due to turbulence in the plasma, not the average temperature.Thomas Edward Allibone, \\"A Guide to Zeta Experiments\\", New Scientist, 18 June 1959, p. 1360 Sceptre IV As the ZETA debacle played out in 1958, solutions to the problems seen in ZETA and Sceptre IIIA were hoped to be simple: a better tube, higher vacuum, and denser plasma. As the Sceptre machine was much less expensive and the high-power capacitor bank already existed, the decision was made to test these concepts with a new device, Sceptre IV. However, none of these techniques helped. Sceptre IV proved to have the same performance problems as the earlier machines. Sceptre IV proved to be the last major \\"classic\\" pinch device built in the UK.

Lynch, was an early motion picture industry pioneer. Personal life Lynch grew up in Asheville, North Carolina, the son of Stephen Scott Lynch, a Civil War veteran wounded in the Battle of Gettysburg, and Jane Susannah Butler Lynch. Lynch was raised in his family's Asheville grocery business. Lynch stood out in his youth as a football and baseball star (earning the nickname \\"Diamond Lynch\\"), and was coaching and managing professionally by his early 20s. Lynch served the head football and baseball coach at Maryville University in Maryville, Tennessee, from 1902 to 1903. Lynch was married twice, first to Flora Camilla Posey, who obtained a divorce from Lynch in 1924, and later to Julia Dodd Adair, an Atlanta socialite, whom he married in 1925. Motion picture industry career Beginnings as a theater owner and Paramount distributor In 1909, Lynch, fresh off a successful baseball season with the local Asheville team, bought a stake in and began managing one of the first movie theaters in Asheville.Asheville Citizen, October 3, 1909 From 1909 through the early nineteen teens, Lynch continued to acquire movie theaters at a prodigious rate. By the mid nineteen teens, Lynch had enough clout as a theater owner to obtain a 25-year exclusive right to distribute Paramount motion pictures in 11 southern states from W.W. Hodkinson, founder of the fledgling Paramount Pictures organization (which was initially a motion picture distribution rather than production company).Hampton, Benjamin B., History of the American Film Industry, From its Beginnings to 1931, Copyright 1970, p. 254. Through the remainder of the nineteen teens, Lynch continued acquiring theaters and distributing Paramount product throughout the South. Involvement with Triangle Distributing Company The Cold Deck movie poster In 1917, Lynch, at the urging of his Paramount colleague Hodkinson, bought into the Triangle Distributing Company, the distribution arm of the Triangle Film Corporation organized by Harry and Roy Aitken. Triangle had, in a very short span of time, become arguably the preeminent movie studio. Triangle's strength lay with its three star directors, D. W. Griffith, Thomas Ince and Mack Sennett. Triangle films also featured the premier actors of the day, including Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, and Norma Talmadge. The Aitkens spun off the distribution side of Triangle in an effort to raise additional capital. In the process, the Aitkens brought in Hodkinson, who brought in Lynch. Lynch maintained a relatively low profile in his dealings with Paramount. However, with Triangle Distributing Company he branded certain Triangle output as \\"Distributed by S.A. Lynch Enterprises,\\"Lahue, Kalton C., Dreams for Sale, The Rise and Fall of the Triangle Film Corporation, Copyright 1971, p. 171. perhaps the most notable example being \\"The Cold Deck,\\" a 1917 Western starring William S. Hart the poster for which is still considered by some one of the all-time great movie posters. Triangle Film Corporation began to fall apart in 1917 amidst financial scandals involving the Aitkins and lost its three 'star' directors and many of its star actors. Lynch, who by that time had had a falling out with Hodkinson and a third owner, Pawley, bought out both in order to obtain sole control of Triangle Distributing.Lahue, Kalton C., Dreams for Sale, The Rise and Fall of the Triangle Film Corporation, Copyright 1971, pp. 167-8. Even after Triangle Film Company had effectively dissolved, Lynch was able to make a profit with Triangle Distributing Company by re-cutting and releasing previously created (and sometimes previously released) Triangle Film Corporation output as new features, well into 1919. Paramount's battle for the theaters Almost from the beginning of the motion picture industry, W.W. Hodkinson and Paramount, in order to stabilize revenues and increase profits, implemented a subscription system for theaters known as \\"block booking\\" whereby a theater owner, if he wanted to show any Paramount pictures, would have to agree to take a block of Paramount product at a set price, sight unseen. Block booking was made possible for Paramount in part due to the exclusive contract between its principal supplier, the Famous Players Lasky Corporation and the first real motion picture star, the former \\"Biograph Girl,\\" Mary Pickford. The public clamored for Mary Pickford's films, and theater owners felt compelled to obtain them. Several major theater circuit owners, unhappy with Paramount's block booking arrangement, banded together in 1917 to form First National in order to create a competing stream of pictures for distribution to its members. First National quickly amassed a sufficient number of theaters under its umbrella to threaten the continued preeminence of Paramount. In order to prevent First National from pushing it out of the market, Paramount embarked upon a massive effort to obtain theaters to rival, if not crush, First National. The period of aggressive theater acquisition and competition between Paramount and First National has been dubbed by some as the \\"Battle for the Theaters.\\"Hampton, Benjamin B., History of the American Film Industry, From its Beginnings to 1931, Copyright 1970, p. 252.Balio, Tino, \\"The American Film Industry\\", Copyright 1976, 1985 ed., p. 121. Rather than starting from scratch to amass theaters, Paramount turned to, among others, Lynch. Lynch, who was already a heavy Paramount shareholder having obtained Hodkinson's stock following his ouster in 1916 following the merger of Paramount into Famous Players Lasky, convinced Paramount to form a new company with him, Southern Enterprises, Inc. The purpose of Southern Enterprises was to take over Lynch's exclusive distribution franchise and to acquire theaters in order to repel the First National challenge.The Cravath Firm and its Predecessors, 1819-1947, v. 3, p. 363 Although Southern Enterprises was owned half by Lynch and half by Paramount, Paramount was cash strapped due to other acquisitions and did not have money available to fund the new company. Not to be deterred, Lynch advanced Paramount's share of the Southern Enterprises capital on the condition that he remain in control until the loan was repaid.The Cravath Firm and its Predecessors, 1819-1947, v. 3, p. 363, n. 1 Southern Enterprises, seeking to break into markets controlled by First National, sent Lynch and his so-called \\"Wrecking Crew\\" or \\"Dynamite Gang\\" through the South to acquire theaters by whatever means necessary.Jobes, Gertrude, Motion Picture Empire, Copyright 1966, p. 219.Hampton, Benjamin B., History of the American Film Industry, From its Beginnings to 1931, Copyright 1970, p. 255. Testimony at Federal Trade Commission hearings related stories of Lynch and his gang arriving in a town served by a First National affiliated theater owner and offering to buy out the theater owner. If the theater owner refused, Lynch and his associates threatened to build a bigger, better theater across the street from the existing theater in order to put the theater owner out of business. The tactic worked, and the Dynamite Gang added continually to the Southern Enterprises theater chain. One principal target in the Battle for the Theaters was the Hulsey circuit in Texas and Oklahoma. Hulsey was one of the more prominent First National members, and Paramount felt obtaining the Hulsey circuit was one of the keys to breaking the threat First National posed. Lynch organized Southern Enterprises of Texas, Inc., capitalized by Paramount and its financial backers, and began buying up theaters throughout Texas and Oklahoma. Hulsey had been very successful with his theaters, but had reinvested his profits in theater expansion and leveraged his position with bank loans. As Lynch moved through Hulsey's territory purchasing theaters, a wire for $1 million arrived at Hulsey's bank for the credit of Southern Enterprises of Texas, Inc. Hulsey's banker called him in, and Hulsey promptly sold out to Paramount.Jobes, Gertrude, Motion Picture Empire, Copyright 1966, p. 222.Hampton, Benjamin B., History of the American Film Industry, From its Beginnings to 1931, Copyright 1970, pp. 256-7. With the fall of Hulsey, and Paramount's infiltration of the First National board of directors through various theater chain acquisitions delivered in part by Lynch, First National crumbled as an effective competitor leaving Paramount the preeminent motion picture production and distribution company. Ultimately, Lynch's tactics gave rise to controversy and disputes with Paramount. By that time, Paramount's financial position had improved and at the end of 1922 it negotiated a $5.7 million deal to pay off its debt to Lynch and acquire the Southern Enterprises theater chain, which then numbered in excess of 200.New York Times, January 7, 1923The Cravath Firm and its Predecessors, 1819-1947, v. 3, p. 363, n. 4 Federal Trade Commission antitrust charges Lynch's activities during the Battle of the Theaters became front-page news in 1921 with the Federal Trade Commission's filing of an anti-trust suit against Lynch, Southern Enterprises, Famous Players-Lasky Corporation, Adolph Zukor, Jesse Lasky and several others.New York Times, September 1, 1921. The Federal Trade Commission charged that Lynch and the others had violated antitrust law by using oppression and coercion in the acquisition of theaters, utilizing the block booking method of distribution, and by forcing Paramount customers to exclude other producer's product from their screens. As the public outrage over Paramount's practices subsided after the fall of First National, so did the government attorneys' encouragement to continue. After several years of prosecution, the case ultimately went away with the admonition that Paramount cease and desist its block booking practices for coercive uses, and permit individual theater owners to opt out of individual features for racial or religious opposition (but only after arbitration).Hampton, Benjamin B., History of the American Film Industry, From its Beginnings to 1931, Copyright 1970, p. 368.New York Times, July 10, 1927. Post-retirement involvement in the motion picture industry Following the fall of First National as a rival to Paramount, and Lynch's sale of his Southern Enterprises, Inc. theater chain, Lynch retired to Miami Beach Florida in the early 1920s and assumed a more anonymous role with Paramount as a member of the Paramount Special Board.1964 International Motion Picture Almanac, Quigley Publishing Company, p. 181 Lynch was brought out of retirement during Paramount's 1933 bankruptcy to deal with its theater holdings.New York Times, August 16, 1933. Lynch later assumed control of Paramount's South Florida theater operations,New York Times, July 24, 1936, which he ran until 1945 when he retired for the second and final time from active involvement in the motion picture industry. One of Lynch's Southern Enterprises employees, Y. Frank FreemanBoxoffice Magazine, March 30, 1940, page 123. took over Lynch's daily activities with Paramount following his second retirement, and ultimately took over as President of Paramount following Adolph Zukor's tenure. Career as a real estate developer In the mid-1920s, flush from the Paramount buyout, Lynch turned his attention to real estate development. During the Florida land boom of the early 1920s, Lynch developed the Lynch Building, an office tower in Jacksonville, Florida which still bears his name, the Exchange Office Building in Miami, Florida, bought the Atlantan Hotel in Atlanta, Georgia, purchased and completed the unfinished Columbus Hotel in downtown Miami, Florida,New York Times, Sept. 16, 1927 and purchased the Venetian and Towers Hotels, also in Miami. Lindsey Hopkins Sr. also had an interest in the 17-story Columbus Hotel at Biscayne boulevard and N.E. First Street with S.A. Lynch. Lynch also notably created the Sunset Islands,Ballinger, Kenneth, Miami Millions, The Story of the 1925 Florida Land Boom and How it Turned into a Boomerang, 1936, p. 74 a series of four man made islands in Biscayne Bay just north of the Venetian Islands, Star Island, Palm Island and Hibiscus Island. Columbus Hotel controversy Lynch's Columbus Hotel purchase proved controversial. Lynch purchased the partially finished hotel out of an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding commenced against the bond underwriter that had financed the hotel's construction. Following Lynch's purchase, the bondholder's committee, headed by George Emlen Roosevelt, a cousin of Theodore Roosevelt, brought suit against Lynch claiming they had been swindled. Lynch's actions were ultimately vindicated when he prevailed in the lawsuit. The presiding judge found that Lynch explicitly made no representations, and the bondholder's committee, which was represented by able and sophisticated businessmen, simply found that it had made a bad deal.Columbus Hotel Corp. et al. v. Hotel Management Co., 116 Fla. 464 (1934) The Columbus Hotel remained in the Lynch family until the 1960s managed Lynch's son and grandson, S.A. Lynch, Jr. and Stephen A. Lynch, III. The Columbus was demolished in the 1980s and 50 Biscayne was constructed on the site in 2005. Sunset Islands The Sunset Islands were some of the last man-made islands created in Biscayne Bay. The Florida land boom of the 1920s ended in a catastrophic land bust just as Lynch finished filling the islands. Other developers were not able to withstand the bust; at least one partially completed man-made island project, Isola di Lolando was never completed. Lynch, however, had the resources to hold the Sunset Islands lots off the market and wait for conditions to improve. The islands remained landscaped but undeveloped until the 1930s, when the first lots went up for sale. Today the Sunset Islands remain one of the most exclusive and sought-after addresses in Miami Beach. Lynch himself built a residence on the southwest corner of Sunset II named \\"Sunshine Cottage,\\" which was featured on tour-boat rides to see houses of the rich and famous. Other business dealings While Lynch's principal business was the motion picture industry, he had dealings as a major financier in many other industries over the course of his life. While most of these activities do not merit special mention, one in particular stands out as an example of the tenacity and aggression Lynch displayed in his business dealings. For several years during the early 1950s, Lynch waged a furious court battle in an effort to take over control of the Florida East Coast Railway, which was then in receivership. Lynch ultimately lost out to Ed Ball representing the DuPont family interests.In re Florida East Coast Ry. Co., 81 F.Supp. 926 (D.C.Fla. 1949) Sports and recreation As a young man, Lynch was a star athlete, excelling at both baseball and football. Lynch had a brief stint at Davidson College in 1903 as a coach and player for its baseball team, and later, in 1922, Lynch bought the minor league professional baseball team the Atlanta Crackers.Atlanta Journal Constitution, September 14, 1922, p. 19 Following his retirement from Paramount in the early 1920s, Lynch began his lifelong interest in yachting. In the mid-1920s, Lynch obtained Rival, one of several Sound Schooner class of 30-foot waterline racing yachts that competed in the waters off Long Island.New York Times, July 6, 1926 Lynch, on board Rival, was a competitor of Rod Stephens, father of the famous yacht designer Olin Stephens. Lynch also turned his attention to the houseboats built by the Mathis Yacht Building Company. Over the course of his life, Lynch owned three of these yachts, the 85-foot Jane, named for his daughter, the 105-foot Sunset, sister-ship to the USS Sequoia (presidential yacht) (launched on July 4, 1926, as Freedom, and renamed Freedom following a full restoration completed in 2008), and the 98-foot North Star.

Surisan is above sea level (a.s.l.). Another name for Surisan is GyeonBulSan. Several Korean Buddhist temples are located on Surisan mountain and the surrounding area. In spring, the mountain is covered in azaleas in bloom. Surisan was designated a Park of Gyeonggi by Gyeonggi-do province in 2009.  Geography  Surisan is located between and . One of the mountainous regions that make up the Gwang-ju Mountain Range, it is situated in Gyeonggi-Province and lies between Anyang City and, to the southeast, Gunpo City. Surisan mountain is a.s.l. and covers a total area of . Within the region, Anyang city covers an area of , Gunpo city , and Ansan city . The mountain has several prominent peaks: in the northwest, Gwan-Mo peak at a.s.l.; in the southwest, Seul-Gi peak at a.s.l., and Su-Am peak at a.s.l. Tae-Eul peak, at a.s.l., is in the centre. The highest of Surisan's peaks, Tae-Eul, is named for the shadow it casts at sunrise, which resembles a large eagle with spread wings. This can be seen from above when the peak is climbed. The appearance in nature of this eagle shape, called tae-eul, is considered a very rare phenomenon in feng shui theory. The dominant rock-type of Surisan's peaks and cliffs is quartz. The deep valleys feature weathered biotite, biotite schist, horny gneiss and other gneissic rocks. Surisan has many natural mineral springs. Surisan is characterized by its cover of flowering azaleas in the spring, when climbers gather to admire the reddish hues and rocky landscape. In its upper reaches, the vegetation is deciduous broadleaf forest, with oak and Mongolian mulberry predominating. The area has relatively few mammal species, and their populations are small. Surisan has a mole species, rabbits, wild boar, raccoon dogs, and weasels. Among Surisan's temples are Sangyeon-sa (Sang-Yeon Temple), Yongjin-sa (Yong-Jin Temple), and Suri-sa (Suri Temple).  Etymology  There are three theories as to the origin of the name Surisan: 1\\\\. The name may derive from the fact that the mountain's notable peaks resemble an eagle 2\\\\. The Suri temple was built during the reign of King Jinheung of Silla. It was called Suri-sa because it was a holy place for the body and mind, and gave its name to the mountain, SuriSan. 3\\\\. During the Joseon dynasty, Lee, son of the Joseon king, trained on this mountain. In honor of this, su (training) and Lee were combined, giving Surisan.  History   Joseon dynasty  Surisan was well known during the Joseon dynasty (1392–1897). It is mentioned in the passage on the city of Ansan in Sejong Sillok Jiriji (, King Sejong's Treatise on Geography), which states: \\"this mountain is called Chi San\\". The Joseon dynasty text SinJung DongGukYeoJiSeongRam refers to the mountain in its passage on Ansan as \\"...Surisan, which is also called GyunBulSan\\". The passage on the city of Gwacheon in the same book specifies that Surisan is said to be located in the southern part of Gwacheon. Surisan is also mentioned in the Ansan section of the text DaeDdongJiJi, compiled by 19th century Joseon dynasty geographer and cartographer Gim Jeong-ho: \\"in the east 5th, also called TaeEulSan and GyunBulSan, this mountain is quite tough and high.\\"  Battle of Surisan  The battle of Surisan took place during the Korean War in Surisan, northwestern Suwon, from February 1 to February 2, 1951. The United States First Corps attempted to advance into the south of the Han River area by launching a counterattack operation on January 25, 1951. At this time, the 35th Regiment of the U.S. 25th Infantry Division and the Turkish Brigade attacked and repelled the 149th Division of the 50th Army of the Chinese Communist Forces (CCF), which was defending its occupation of Surisan. The 35th Regiment and the Turkish Brigade were supported in battle by the United States 999th Armored Field Artillery Battalion and the U.S. 89th Medium Tank Battalion, surrounding the Surat Mountains on both sides and attacking the base of the Chinese 149th Division, and winning back the occupied territory. They then successfully defeated the Chinese Army counterattack, launched immediately afterwards. As a result of this battle, the Chinese army withdrew from the Suwon area, retreating north to Anyang. The United Nations Forces were subsequently able to continue northward to secure the Han River line.  Folktale   Yellow Rock Tale  Yellow rock is a rock on Gwan-Mo peak which forms the upper part of SanSinJe Temple. Once upon a time there was a king, who was worried that there had been no prince to inherit the throne for over 40 years. God answered the diligent prayers of the court were answered, and a prince was born. When war broke out the year the prince turned three, he was taken from the palace to GangHwaDo to be safe. But on the way he encountered a storm, and the boat in which he travelled was shipwrecked. A turtle appeared and carried the prince to land, arriving at the edge of GwanMo Peak to look for shelter. After days on the turtle's back, the prince was starving and a pitiful sight. And so the turtle went down to the village in search of food for him. But the prince, unaware of the turtle's intention, thought that he was abandoned. In anger, the prince hit a rock as hard as he could with his fist. The boulder fell, striking the prince with a great sound that shook the heavens and the earth. The prince died, his blood spilling yellow, and the turtle was hit by a hail of falling rock. Thereafter, the story was told that Yellow Rock takes its name from the prince's blood from which it formed, and in a village of Anyang City stands a rock with a monument, called Turtle Rock.  Sport   Mountain biking  Surisan is popular with mountain bike riders and has a number of bike trails, accessible from the nearby Line 4 train. One typical trail passes by the Gunpo Central Library, climbing some 200 meters to the temple entrance. The 11 km course can be completed in about two hours. It is one of the easiest mountain biking trails in the metropolitan area, in terms of slope, area, view, and ground condition. There is also a ridge trail running from the five-way intersection to the southeast, and a road descending from the same intersection. Roads on the mountain are generally not well-suited to biking, being narrow except at a few entry and exit points. The trail running up through the bottleneck from the Anyang side is steep and the surface is poor, making it not practicable for regular cross-country bikes. The trail leading to Sukbong-Jangmobong is not suitable for biking and is for walkers only.  Hiking and climbing  Most of Surisan's mountain-climbing trails overlap with mountain biking trails. Novice hikers and local residents often use the walking trails, which have rest benches installed along the way. Hikers must take their own water supplies, as water is only available in small quantities outside the summer season from one local shop, and there are no refreshment stalls on the mountain. At the bottom of the mountain, there is a freshwater spring at the entrance to the library, and Banwol reservoir lies to the southwest.  Recent   Forest exploration class  The Surisan Forest Exploratory Class, established in 2017, is an Anyang City representative village community activation program. In May 2018, Anyang City selected the Surisan Forest Exploratory Class as a specialization subject and example of best practice for its Urban Renewal New Deal project. Anyang City invites a specialist forest explorer who guides participating school children's exploration of the mangrove forests. Participants engage in forest activities while listening to detailed explanations of the surrounding vegetation.  Atopy forest experience class  An Atopic Forest Experience Class was held in the Surisan Forest Park on November 6, 2017, with 50 children and parents participating. This event took place after participants had completed the first of two months of theoretical training in understanding and managing atopic dermatitis and allergic rhinitis. Participants interacted with nature in the forests of Surisan Forest, experiencing the forest under the guidance of their forest guide. They also boosted immunity using the antimicrobial properties of forest-sourced phytoncide compounds.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. It is also known as the Munising Furnace. History Munising Furnace during operation Munising was founded in 1850 as a resort village by the Munising Company, but the company's capital was over extended and their plan never came to fruition. Two more companies were formed to develop the Munising Company's assets, but neither prospered. In 1866, Henry Mather and Peter White acting as agents for a group of investors, purchased the land around Munising and created the Schoolcraft Iron Company. A site for the furnace was selected on Munising Creek, about 1100 feet from Munising Bay, and in 1867 construction was started on a furnace. A stack was built from sandstone quarried locally on Grand Island, furnace machinery was brought in from Newburgh, New York, and about 500 people were employed cutting cordwood. The Schoolcraft Furnace was fired the first time on June 28, 1868. The furnace used iron ore shipped in via rail from Negaunee and Ishpeming to Marquette, and thence by boat to Munising. Charcoal was made in kilns within a few miles of the furnace; seventeen of these have been located. The furnace also used limestone shipped in from the Lake Erie region. A small steam engine was operated to crush the ore and a larger one supplied air to the furnace. However, after the first fire, the furnace was run only irregularly. Problems with wet charcoal and shortages of ore or charcoal forced several shutdowns. Despite this, by 1869 the furnace was putting out an average of 20 tons of pig iron per day. However, finances for the furnace were shaky, and poor business decisions in 1870 increased the Schoolcraft Iron Company's debt until it collapsed into bankruptcy in October 1870. Peter White organized a new company, the Munising Iron Company, and purchased the furnace in 1871. The furnace was reopened in the fall of that year, and ran for 12 months, making a total of 2500 tons of iron. It was shut down in the fall of 1872 to add a hopper and bell, improving efficiency. The furnace was back online in May, but only four months later the Panic of 1873 hit, driving down iron prices. The furnace was online again for 24 weeks in 1875 before a lack of iron and charcoal shut it down again. In 1876, the furnace was leased to Henry Pickands, who ran it until November 1877, when it was leased to Daniel Rankin. Rankin intended to fire the furnace in 1878, but was no able to, and the furnace was shut down for good. The final closing of the Schoolcraft Furnace devastated Munising, and many people in the town left to seek work elsewhere. Munising declined until the Munising Railway was opened in 1895, and a large tannery was established later, providing more jobs for the area. In 1901, the furnace machinery was purchased by the Lake Superior Iron and Metal Company of Hancock, Michigan; much of the equipment was melted down as scrap and remade into machinery for the copper mines of the Keweenaw Peninsula. The Schoolcraft Furnace was placed on the National Resister of Historic Places in 1977. The remains of the site are difficult to distinguish; the old road trace is now a hiking trail, and some of the rubble pile can be identified in the now-wooded area. The ruins of what might have been a corduroy road are visible in the creek. The area is publicly accessible from the Munising Falls Visitor's Center. {|class=\\"wikitable unsortable\\" ! style=\\"background:light gray; color:black\\"|Forge site images, 2010 File:SchoolcraftFurnace- MunisingMI2.jpg|Creek with ruins of what may be a corduroy road File:SchoolcraftFurnace-MunisingMI4.jpg|Rubble pile File:SchoolcraftFurnace- MunisingMI.jpg|One piece of machinery left on site |} References Category:Archaeological sites on the National Register of Historic Places in Michigan Category:Buildings and structures in Alger County, Michigan Category:National Register of Historic Places in Alger County, Michigan ","title":"Schoolcraft Furnace Site"},{"id":"29985453","text":"The 1st Vietnamese Parachute Battalion (Fr: 1er bataillon de parachutistes vietnamiens) was a French-Vietnamese paratroop battalion formed in Saigon, French Indochina in 1951.

It was composed of French officers and Laotian non-commissioned officers and enlisted men, and fought in the First Indochina War.  History  The 1st BPL began forming in October 1951 at Chinaimo near Vientiane, and reached a strength of 853 men in a headquarters and three companies by 1 April 1952. Its 2nd Company was formed from Commandos 4, 5, and 6 of the 1st Laotian Para-Commando Company. During 1952 it was involved in twenty operations, six of which involved parachute jumps. Between 15 and 24 December 576 men from the unit parachuted into Sam Neua to reinforce its garrison in Operation Noel; they were reinforced by eighty more to form a fourth company in February 1953. The Sam Neua garrison was defeated by a Vietminh invasion of 40,000 troops commanded by General Võ Nguyên Giáp, forcing the remnants of the 1st BPL to flee toward the Plain of Jars. It was reformed at Chinaimo a month later, and conducted reconnaissance and commando operations north of Luang Prabang for the rest of the year, including Operation Dampieres in September. The 1st BPL began preparing for Operation Condor, an attempt to relieve the Dien Bien Phu garrison, during March 1954. It advanced towards the Laotian-Vietnamese border in April and early May, withdrawing in mid-May after the garrison surrendered. The BPL reunited on 18 June near Savannakhet at the French Air Force's Seno Airbase. Between 2 and 4 August it conducted the final airborne operation of the war, in which it parachuted into the town of Phanop in Khammouane Province, linking up with local militia units and sweeping the territory up to Mụ Giạ Pass on the Vietnamese border. Following the implementation of the Indochina ceasefire on 6 August, the 1st BPL with 981 personnel returned to Seno and transferred to the Laotian National Army. Following the October departure of its French officers, the unit was redesignated the 1st Parachute Battalion (French: 1er Bataillon Parachutiste – 1er BP).

The 44th SMW executed the unique 'Long Life' test of a Minuteman ICBM. The 68th Strategic Missile Squadron performed the only launch of a United States ICBM from an operational inland US missile site from LF November-02 (N-02) on 1 March 1965. The first stage was loaded with only enough propellant for seven seconds of burn time and the upper stages were inert. It successfully demonstrated the ability of a Strategic Air Command missile crew to launch an ICBM. Overview The 44th Missile Wing was the second United States Air Force LGM-30 Minuteman ICBM wing. Deployment of the Minuteman ICBM began in 1961 with the initiation of construction of 150 silos and associated launch control facilities. Activation of the 44th Strategic Missile Wing on 1 January 1962, marked the initiation of SAC's first LGM-30B Minuteman I wing (the 341st SMW was equipped with the Minuteman 1A). The assignment of the 66th Strategic Missile Squadron on 1 September marked the beginning of SAC's first Minuteman IB squadron. During 1962 the 67th and 68th SMS stood up. In April 1963, the first missile was emplaced into a prepared silo. Two months later, SAC accepted the first flight of 10 Minuteman IB ICBMs and in July, some of these missiles were placed on alert status. The last of 150 missiles was placed on alert by the end of 1963. Between October 1971 and March 1973 the Minuteman IBs were replaced by LGM-30F Minuteman II missiles. The end of the Cold War and President Bush's order of 28 September 1991 to remove Minuteman II missiles from alert status profoundly affected the 44th MW. To comply with the pending START I treaty, the Air Force immediately began removing missiles from their silos. The 67th MS inactivated in August 1992, with the 66th in 1993 and 68th lastly on 5 July 1994. Destruction of silos and alert facilities finished in 1996 when Kilo-06, was imploded on 13 September 1996. Delta-01 and Delta-09 were left intact and are now the Minuteman Missile National Historic Site under the control of the National Park Service. Facilities The Missile Alert Facility (MAF) consists of a buried and hardened Launch Control Facility (LCC) and an above-ground Launch Control Support Building (LCSB). MAFs were formerly known as Launch Control Facilities (LCFs) but terminology was changed in 1992 with the inactivation of Strategic Air Command (SAC). In addition, a MAF has a landing pad for helicopters; a large radio tower; a large \\"top hat\\" HF antenna; a vehicle garage for security vehicles; recreational facilities, and one or two sewage lagoons. The entire site, except for the helicopter pad and sewage lagoons are secured with a fence and security personnel. About a dozen airmen and officers are assigned to a MAF. The underground LCC Launch Control Center (LCC) contains the command and control equipment for missile operations. It is staffed by the two launch officers who have primary control and responsibility for the 10 underground and hardened Launch Facilities (LF)s within its flight which contains the operational missile. Each of the five LCCs also has the ability to command and monitor all 50 LFs within the squadron. The LF is unmanned, except when maintenance and security personnel are needed. A squadron is composed of five flights; flights are denoted by a letter of the alphabet with the facilities controlled by the flight being designated by a number, 01 through 11, with 01 being the MAF.

Set in the 12th century during the Anarchy in England, the novels focus on Benedictine monk Cadfael who aids the law with solving murders. In all, Pargeter wrote twenty Cadfael novels between 1977 and 1994. Each draws upon the storyline, characters, and developments of previous books in the series. Pargeter apparently planned the 20th installment as the final book of the series; Brother Cadfael's Penance brings together the loose story ends into a tidy conclusion. Pargeter herself died shortly after its publication, following a long illness. Many of the books were adapted into both radio episodes in which Ray Smith, Glyn Houston and subsequently Philip Madoc played the monk, and a television series starring Derek Jacobi as Cadfael. Pargeter's Cadfael Chronicles are sometimes credited for popularizing what would later become known as the historical mystery. Brother Cadfael Cadfael window, Shrewsbury Abbey As a character, Cadfael is a conversus, only entering the cloister in his forties after being both a soldier and a sailor; this experience gives him an array of talents and skills useful in monastic life. He is a skilled observer of human nature and a talented herbalist (which skill he learned in the Holy Lands from the Muslims). He is inquisitive by nature, energetic, and has an innate, although modern, sense of justice and fair-play. Abbots call upon him as a medical examiner, detective, doctor, and diplomat. His worldly knowledge, although useful, gets him in trouble with the more doctrinaire characters of the series, and the seeming contradiction between the secular and the spiritual worlds forms a central and continuing theme of the stories. By contrast, some men entered the cloistered life as young boys just old enough to attend school, or in their early teens; such a monk was termed puer oblatus or oblate in the time of these novels. Many of Cadfael's brother monks had been sent as children to the monastery. Abbot Radulfus instituted a policy of not accepting such young ones except for schooling. Historical background The stories are set between 1137 and 1145, during the Anarchy, the destructive contest for the crown of England between King Stephen and Empress Maud. Many true historical events are described or referred to in the books. For example, the translation of Saint Winifred to Shrewsbury Abbey is fictionalised in the first chronicle, A Morbid Taste for Bones, and One Corpse Too Many is inspired by the siege of Shrewsbury Castle by Stephen in 1138. The burning of Worcester puts the characters on the run and into Shropshire in The Virgin in the Ice. The pillage of Winchester and burning of the abbey there sends the monks who are the centre of the story to Shrewsbury Abbey in An Excellent Mystery. In Dead Man's Ransom, the fictional characters are involved in the small group of Welsh who involve themselves in the Anarchy at the Battle of Lincoln, drawing the historical prince of Gwynedd, Owain, into the plot. Empress Maud's brief stay in London, trying to gain approval for her coronation while she holds Stephen in prison is the start point for one character in The Pilgrim of Hate. The next turning of Henry of Blois's coat and the rising fortunes of King Stephen involve the Abbot and send three new people into the Foregate and the Abbey in The Raven in the Foregate. One main character in The Hermit of Eyton Forest arrives in Shropshire while Empress Maud is besieged in Oxford Castle, from her camp. In The Potter's Field, Hugh Beringar's force is called to the Fens to aid King Stephen in controlling the rampaging Geoffrey de Mandeville, Earl of Essex; on return the Sheriff double checks the story of a character who escaped from that area, back to Shropshire. The quarrel between Owain Gwynedd and his impetuous younger brother Cadwaladr on account of Cadwaladr's murder of the prince of a southern principality in Wales, combined with the push to spread the Roman rite into Wales, are the story told in The Summer of the Danes. In novels where the plot does not hinge on a historical event or have historical characters walking through the story, it will focus on one or two aspects of life in medieval England. Examples include the importance of pilgrimage in The Heretic's Apprentice, the wool and cloth making trades in The Rose Rent, the rules of inheritance under Welsh law in Monk's Hood, specific merchant trades in Saint Peter's Fair and The Sanctuary Sparrow. The annual fair raised funds for the Abbey, authorised by Earl Roger or King Henry I. The use of a house of worship for sanctuary from secular law is also a feature of The Sanctuary Sparrow. Cadfael is an herbalist, whose skills and potions bring him into contact with people outside the monastery, integral in the plots not dependent on a historical event. Although the series is fiction, historical people are portrayed in the series. They include (but are not limited to): * King Stephen * Empress Maud * Robert of Gloucester and his son Philip * Geoffrey de Mandeville, 1st Earl of Essex * Robert of Leicester * Owain Gwynedd, his brother Cadwaladr ap Gruffydd, and his son Hywel * William of Ypres * Bishop Henry of Blois * Bishop Roger de Clinton * Abbots Heribert (1128–1138), Radolfus (1138–1148) and Robert Pennant (prior to 1148, then abbot to 1168) * Henry I of England (1068/9–1135) Themes Cadfael and love A distinctive feature of the series is a pair of star-crossed lovers in nearly every book, who invariably get the full sympathy of Brother Cadfael (and the reader). Typically, Cadfael bends his full energy and ingenuity to the double task of solving the mystery and bringing the lovers to a happy union. In this latter, he seems the literary descendant of Shakespeare's Friar Laurence who made great (though ultimately futile) efforts to help Romeo and Juliet. Cadfael is far more successful, with virtually all pairs of lovers in the series getting off to happy consummations, except when one of them turns out to be the wanted murderer. In one case, indeed, the lovers get their happy ending with Cadfael's help, even though one of them is the murderer. Lovers in the Cadfael books face a whole series of obstacles, which sometimes seem insurmountable (in one book, it seems they are relatives too close to marry) but are invariably overcome. However, the problem is almost never a significant difference in social status between the two. In this series, aristocratic boys usually fall in love with aristocratic girls, artisans fall for the daughters of artisans, and a lowly wandering juggler is charmed beyond measure by a lowly kitchen maid. In The Hermit of Eyton Forest a prosperous forester's daughter falls in love with a runaway villein, a skilled leatherworker who will work his year and a day to establish himself in his trade in Shropshire before he marries her. In St. Peter's Fair, a tradesman's daughter settles for another tradesman's son after her aristocratic first choice turns out to be a cad, calling her a \\"shopkeeper's girl of no account.\\" In most cases, it seems that Pargeter's characters deliberately curtail their romantic aspirations where class conflict would undermine them. There are some exceptions to this class consciousness; in The Virgin in the Ice a noblewoman marries her guardian's favourite squire, though he is the illegitimate son of a footsoldier and a Syrian widow, and in The Pilgrim of Hate an aristocratic youth marries the daughter of a tradesman. Aristocracy A passage in The Confession of Brother Haluin introduces a nobleman whom the reader (and Cadfael) had not met before: > Here he came, Audemar de Clary, on a tall chestnut horse, a big man in dark, > plain, workmanlike riding clothes, without ornament, and needing none to > mark him as having authority here. (...) Not a man to be crossed lightly, > but no one feared him. They approached him cheerfully and spoke with him > boldly. His anger, when justified, might be withering, even perilous – but > it would be just. This is fairly typical of most members of the aristocracy depicted in the series, who are described as fair-minded and just to their underlings, within the context of the hierarchical feudal social system and ideology. The books do present some manifestly unjust, tyrannical and or outright cruel members of the aristocracy, though they are definitely in the minority. Faced with such, peasants can and do resort to the \\"safety-valve\\" built within the feudal system itself, by escaping from their lord to a chartered borough where after a stay of one year and one day they become free. On several occasions, Cadfael facilitates and helps such escapes. Also, cruel and unjust landowners may end up as the victims of the murder which Cadfael needs to solve, in which case the reader is curious to know the solution of the mystery, but is not particularly eager to see the perpetrator punished.  Civil war  The civil war between King Stephen and Empress Maud is a constant background to the series, called the Anarchy by many. Despite the lack of newspapers and other mass news media, the inhabitants of Shrewsbury are kept well informed of the latest developments as the town is a major centre of commerce, constantly getting visitors from all over the country. In One Corpse Too Many, the second book in the series, Shrewsbury itself is a battlefield, and the wholesale execution of the defeated garrison by order of King Stephen forms the gruesome background to the book's murder mystery. Further on, however, Shrewsbury is an island of calm in the raging storm. Refugees as well as spies and conspirators constantly come in, considerably impacting life in the town and setting up the plot for many of the books. Characters occasionally set out to the battlefields, either to take direct part in the fighting or (as in the case of Cadfael himself) to offer some needed aid or rescue. Stories of woe and disaster come in from other locations, such as Worcester (The Virgin in the Ice), Lincoln (Dead Man's Ransom) or Winchester (An Excellent Mystery). Moreover, Shrewsbury is in close proximity to the border of Wales, which has its own troubles and wars – distinct from, though often interconnected with, those of England (Dead Man's Ransom). In the last novel, Brother Cadfael's Penance, Cadfael and Sheriff Hugh Beringar start out at a peace conference in Coventry, but Cadfael ends up in the midst of castle under siege, with castellan Philip FitzRobert seriously wounded by a projectile lobbed in by a siege machine. The castle was not too far from Gloucester, among the ongoing battles in the Thames Valley. For all that, for most of the series the war happens elsewhere. Hugh Beringar, though in effect assuming the functions of a military governor and civil administrator as well as head of the police, finds the time and energy to personally work with Cadfael on solving a new mystery. Though living in a war-torn country, Cadfael is often seen sitting contented in his garden and reflecting on the harmonic turn of the year's seasons. An Excellent Mystery concludes: > September was again September, mellowed and fruitful after the summer heat > and drought. After every extreme the seasons righted themselves, and won > back the half at least of what was lost. In general, the war is seen as mainly the concern of the nobility. Some of its members take up a staunch and unwavering loyalty to one side or the other, and opposing partisans treat each other with utmost respect, as prescribed by the code of chivalry. Others are utterly opportunistic and seek only to make use of the situation for personal profit and advancement, and are regarded with contempt by the more principled characters (and seemingly by the writer as well). The lower classes, burghers and peasants, in general have little interest in who would win the war as long as the death and destruction end, either by one of the contenders winning or by their reaching some kind of compromise (the latter is what the Church is shown as trying to achieve, with little success). In the manorial system they have no share in political power; however, workers on a manor were called up for service as men-at-arms when the need arose (An Excellent Mystery). The burghers of Shrewsbury are concerned to repair the damage caused to their city during fighting in which they had little interest (the question who would pay for it is an undercurrent in Saint Peter's Fair). Thereafter, the traders and artisans of the city are well- content to live under the reasonably efficient and honest administration offered on behalf of King Stephen by Prestcote and later by Beringar. They might have been equally content to live under the Empress Maud, provided only that her local representatives offer them the same possibility of developing undisturbed their trade and commerce. This cannot be known, as Maud never held Shropshire, nor protected their farms, trade and commerce. The series ends with the battles ongoing, though it is a stalemate, and the earls and barons began to make their own peace treaties. There was an effort to bring about a peaceful resolution ending in nought. The fighting ended mainly three years after the last book when Robert of Gloucester died, and Empress Maud returned to Normandy. A new era opened for England when King Stephen died in 1154, having signed a treaty with his successor, Henry FitzEmpress, eldest son of Maud and her second husband Geoffrey of Anjou. But for the writer's death, the format of the series – chronologically consecutive – might have left room for additional volumes before the end of Stephen's reign was reached. Cadfael would have been in his 70s, and based on actual history, Prior Robert Pennant would have become the Abbot in place of Radulfus, so the last book was perhaps a satisfying close, with Cadfael's personal life expanding, his son safe, and the lack of interest in the ongoing strife growing clear. Crusades in the background The Crusades form an important part of the backdrop to the books. There are Cadfael's own memories of his crusading life, which occur in virtually every one of the books, and the circumstances of Olivier's early life. In addition, most of Cadfael's knowledge of herbs and medicine was learned in the East, from more sophisticated sources than he would have found in England. (In the TV version of Virgin in the Ice, when Cadfael is treating a gravely wounded brother, the best remedy another brother can suggest is bleeding, which Cadfael scorns.) Several of the books feature returning crusaders who have central roles in the plot, while in others there are characters who depart England on the way eastwards. All of these crusading characters are depicted as sterling, model knights, brave and chivalrous, and the crusading enterprise itself is invariably regarded by all characters as a most noble and worthy cause. There is occasional oblique mention of acts of cruelty committed in the course of the Crusades. In conversation with a fellow crusader, Cadfael remarks, \\"After the killing that was done in Jerusalem, of so many who held by the Prophet, I say they deserved better luck against us than they had.\\" In adding that his companion was never accused of brutality, he implicitly passes judgment on the Crusades as a whole (The Leper of Saint Giles). While on various occasions Cadfael makes remarks showing him not pleased with such brutalities, the references are rarely specific. Cadfael (as all other characters) never casts any doubt on the morality of carving out a Christian kingdom in the Muslim East and maintaining it by force; indeed, it would have been anachronistic to have him express such doubts. Cadfael's experience of the Crusades didn't lead to bigotry. Cadfael remembers Mariam, a Muslim woman, as \\"well worth the loving,\\" and had many other profitable friendships with Arabs and Muslims. His companion from The Leper of Saint Giles, who spent many years as a captive of the Fatimid Egyptians, agrees, saying he always found his hosts \\"chivalrous and courteous,\\" who gave him medical help and supported him in his convalescence. Differences between books and television series Thirteen of the books were adapted for television. They starred Derek Jacobi. The sequence of the television episodes differs from the sequence of the novels. Within the individual screenplays, with one major exception, most are reasonably faithful to the books, being modified primarily to minimise the size of the speaking cast, the running time of the script, or the need for extravagant special effects. Only in the books, Cadfael speaks Welsh and translates for several non-English-speaking Welshmen. One episode, The Pilgrim of Hate, bears almost no resemblance to the eponymous book save the presence of a few characters sharing the names (but not the actions) of the characters in the book. In The Holy Thief, one of the characters is turned into a villain. In A Morbid Taste For Bones the climax sequence is altered, giving Cadfael more of a speaking role. In the episode Monk's Hood, Hugh has a somewhat larger role than in the book, following Cadfael to the court and suffering a stab wound when he walks in unexpectedly on Cadfael's accusation of the true criminal. In The Rose Rent, Cadfael gives the young wife a potion to ease her terminally ill husband's pain, warning her that too much will kill him; in the next scene, the man is dead, implying a mercy killing. In the book, there is no such implication; the man dies of his illness without any hint that Cadfael or the widow acted to hasten his end. The character of Hugh Beringar is markedly different in the television series, particularly in his relationship with Cadfael. In the series, Hugh is the sheriff who sometimes helps, and sometimes hinders Cadfael - friendly but maintaining a professional relationship. In the books, despite the more than thirty years difference in their ages, Hugh and Cadfael are best friends who think alike in crucial ways, particularly as to what is justice. Hugh and Aline Siward are both introduced in One Corpse Too Many. Hugh appears in all of the books except A Morbid Taste for Bones, whilst Aline does not appear in any of the subsequent television episodes. She appears in several of the books, where she plays an important role in sheltering women (Saint Peter's Fair, An Excellent Mystery, One Corpse Too Many, The Sanctuary Sparrow), and even when she does not appear in the books, Hugh speaks of her constantly and fondly. In the books, Hugh marries Aline and they have a son, Giles, named for Aline's dead brother. Cadfael is the godfather of Hugh's son, and he confides several of his deepest secrets only to Hugh.  Bibliography   Cadfael novels  These are numbered in order of the time in which the novel was set and the order of publication. Each book has been published in hardback and paperback, and in a number of languages. The first publication in the UK, by Macmillan (or Headline Book Publishing, beginning with The Hermit of Eyton Forest), is the year of first publication. A Rare Benedictine is in the order of publication, but not in the order of setting. That book includes three short stories describing how Cadfael, man-at-arms in the Crusades and Normandy, joined a Benedictine monastery. # A Morbid Taste for Bones (published in August 1977, set in 1137) # One Corpse Too Many (July 1979, set in August 1138) # Monk's Hood (August 1980, set in December 1138) # Saint Peter's Fair (May 1981, set in July 1139) # The Leper of Saint Giles (August 1981, set in October 1139) # The Virgin in the Ice (April 1982, set in November 1139) # The Sanctuary Sparrow (January 1983, set in the Spring of 1140) # The Devil's Novice (August 1983, set in September 1140) # Dead Man's Ransom (April 1984, set in February 1141) # The Pilgrim of Hate (September 1984, set in May 1141) # An Excellent Mystery (June 1985, set in August 1141) # The Raven in the Foregate (February 1986, set in December 1141) # The Rose Rent (October 1986, set in June 1142) # The Hermit of Eyton Forest (June 1987, set in October 1142) # The Confession of Brother Haluin (March 1988, set in December 1142) # A Rare Benedictine: The Advent of Brother Cadfael (September 1988, set in 1120) # The Heretic's Apprentice (February 1989, set in June 1143) # The Potter's Field (September 1989, set in August 1143) # The Summer of the Danes (April 1991, set in April 1144) # The Holy Thief (August 1992, set in February 1145) # Brother Cadfael's Penance (May 1994, set in November 1145) Note that the numbering of the Brother Cadfael Chronicles as published in paperback by Mysterious Press does not include A Rare Benedictine (instead, the cover refers to it as \\"The Advent Of Brother Cadfael\\"); the total of the numbered chronicles (by Mysterious Press) is therefore 20 (per the covers of this set). All of the novels are also available as audiobooks. Narrators include Vanessa Benjamin (The Devil's Novice from Blackstone Audio), Derek Jacobi, Roe Kendall, Stephen Thorne, Patrick Tull and Johanna Ward.

The non-profit organization's direction and decision making are dictated by its members.Texas Farm Bureau website Farm Bureau supports farmers and ranchers and advocates for a safe and affordable American food supply. Members create and shape the organization's position on policy, and organization leadership works to implement the policy to benefit Texas agriculture.  Texas agriculture  Texas leads the nation in cattle, cotton, sheep and wool, goats and mohair and hay production. The Lone Star State also has the most farms and ranches and the highest value of farm real estate in the United States. A total of in Texas are occupied by the state's 248,416 farms and ranches.T https://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/AgCensus/2017/Online_Resources/County_Profiles/Texas/cp99048.pdf Texas agriculture yields $24.92 billion annually in cash receipts. The most profitable commodities, according to the 2017 Census of Agriculture, are: cattle, poultry, eggs, cotton and cottonseed, dairy, grains, oilseeds and dry beans, nursery, greenhouse, floriculture and hay. The agriculture industry is evolving rapidly to keep up with an expanding global population. Farmers and ranchers have adopted technologies to improve their efficiency and produce more food on the same amount of land. In 1940, the American farmer produced enough food to feed 19 people each year. Seven decades later, in 2010, the American farmer fed 155 people annually.AFBF Food and Farm Facts  Structure  Texas Farm Bureau consists of 205 independent, self-governed county Farm Bureaus. Each county Farm Bureau elects its own board of directors and officers. Texas Farm Bureau members are not required to be agricultural producers. Membership is open to anyone interested in supporting Texas’ rural communities and agricultural operations. Farm Bureau members pay annual dues, which cover a variety of member services and benefits. County Farm Bureaus are organized into 13 districts across Texas. Each district elects a director to serve on the board of the state organization. State directors may be elected to a maximum of three two-year terms. At the state level, members elect a president each year at the organization's annual meeting. The president serves on the state board of directors and guides volunteer leadership. Texas Farm Bureau also is led by an executive director, who is employed by the organization to oversee the daily operations of Texas Farm Bureau and Affiliated Companies. Historically, both the president and executive director have had extensive experience in the agricultural industry. Texas Farm Bureau members convene each year at the annual meeting, where they vote on proposed resolutions to be included in the organization's policy book. All approved resolutions are included in member-directed policy, which governs the organization's response to current agricultural and rural issues. Nationally, Texas Farm Bureau is affiliated with the American Farm Bureau Federation—a network of more than 6 million members across all 50 states.American Farm Bureau Federation website  History  The Texas Farm Bureau was established in 1933.http://www.texasfarmbureau.org/aboutus.aspx During the Great Depression, Texas Farm Bureau was reorganized as the “Texas Agricultural Association” on March 6, 1934, in Dallas. In 1938, Texas Agricultural Association members voted to move the headquarters south to Waco. The organization operated for seven years under that name until members voted to restore the organization back to “Texas Farm Bureau” in 1941. Over the next 70 years, Texas Farm Bureau grew from 15,630 member families to more than 500,000 member families. During its history, the organization has helped bring electricity and phone service to rural communities, establish a successful farm-to-market road system in Texas and enact effective national farm policy.Winds of Change - Texas Farm Bureau's 75th Anniversary  Services  Texas Farm Bureau works with legislators in Austin and Washington, D.C., as well as frequently addresses issues in the courts and in the regulatory process, to support the needs of farmers and ranchers in rural Texas. The organization's communications products keep members informed of current legislation and issues that affect their daily operations. Texas Farm Bureau produces two member publications: Texas Agriculture for agricultural producers and Texas Neighbors for non-producing members. News services also include a television program, “Voices of Agriculture,” on RFD-TV, and the “Texas Farm Bureau Radio Network,” which has more than 60 affiliate radio stations across Texas. The organization also connects with its statewide membership through its website and by participating in social media, including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. TFB also has a consumer-oriented blog, Texas Table Top,Texas Table Top blog and a weekly editorial, Your Texas Agriculture Minute. Several programs and services are offered to Texas Farm Bureau members. Many focus on developing rural youth and educating the public about agriculture, such as Ag in the Classroom; the Planet Agriculture exhibit; AgLead and FarmLead; youth scholarships; and the Young Farmers and Ranchers program. Additional member services include insurance and other financial services; estate planning; trespassing rewards; and commodity market information.

During his younger years, Lattier studied at the Catholic Mission in Abidjan in the Côte d'Ivoire. The \\"bare-handed sculptor\\", as some called him, emigrated from the Ivory Coast to France in 1935 for education purposes. At the age of 10 he attended the Marist Brotherhood of Saint-Chamond on the Loire, a Catholic school founded by Marcellin Champagnat. In 1945 He began his studies in the Écoles des Beaux-Arts (School of Fine Arts), Saint-Étienne, at twenty-one years old. During his time in Saint- Étienne he was apprenticed under Henri Barthelemy, a master sculptor, and Joachim Durand, a modeler. In 1947 he transferred to the École des Beaux-Arts de Paris where he studied sculpture and architecture under several notable masters of sculpture, architecture and wood carving. He emerged with an unprecedented dedication to modern sculpture, experimenting with new forms and unusual materials. He was soon acknowledged for his artistic ability and the distinct style of his works. He left the École des Beaux-Arts de Paris in 1956 and spent several years exhibiting before his return to Côte d'Ivoire following its independence from France in 1960. He returned to the Côte d'Ivoire around 1961-62 to teach as a professor for sculptural art at the École Nationale des Beaux-Arts in Abidjan. He spent the rest of his years there until his unexpected death in 1978.  Influences and impact  Christian Lattier's innovative style was a key factor in the development of modernism in sculpture in Côte d'Ivoire and France. With the Côte d'Ivoire being colonised by France from 1893-1960, he was influenced by centuries-old traditions in European and West African cultures. He was inspired by African masks and used string, wire and reddish colours in his sculptures. Throughout his lifetime he created over 3,000 designs, keeping his best pieces and destroying the rest. Lattier was very particular when it came to his sculptures; he would destroy his work and start again a multitude of times until it reached his desired quality. Lattier spent all his time working and researching to further better his craft. His hardworking nature was known and made an impression on those around him. Nineteen pieces of Christian Lattier's sculptures are currently in the collection of Musée National de Côte d'Ivoire in Abidjan.  Themes and style  Christian Lattier’s style was to use the traditional West African technique of weaving a mask around a centre of wire or tie it up with ideas derived mainly from European art and cultural history. Lattier worked with stone, wire, wood, and strong hemp fibre. Lattier was a pioneer in modern sculpture in the Côte d'Ivoire and France. His never-before- seen style reinvented sculpture, which ultimately brought him many awards and success.  Movement  He was a part of “The Short Century” which was an exhibition on independence and liberation movements in Africa between 1945-1994 that travelled to Munich, Berlin, Chicago, and New York from May 18, 2001 to July 29, 2001.  Notable Works  * 1954: Lattier's Le Panthere (The panther), won the Chevanard Prix at the \\"World Festival of Black Arts\\" in Dakar, where he introduced the use of string, when usually, candidates presented only plasterboard. * 1957: Lattier collaborated with sculptor Roland Guillaumel and Georges Fabre in the exterior decoration of the Abidjan Town Hall. * 1962: One of his most famous works was a statue named The Chicken Thief or the Victory of Samothrace. It was made with string and wire and is around 4.2 feet high. * 1969: Lattier created a huge wall panel made of string displayed in the hall of the airport of Abidjan titled The three ages of Ivory Coast, along with a metal and a concrete sculpture titled Ivory Coast in the year 2000, and The Aviation, respectively. * 1970: Lattier participated in the decoration of the building of the Price Stabilization Fund in Abidjan. * 1975, Lattier created Mask, which garnered attention due to his use of traditional techniques that referred back to West African traditions.

Background The campaign aimed to halt the ongoing decline in urban and semi-urban tree planting in England. The decline was highlighted by a survey of urban trees in England carried out in 2005 (published as the report Trees in Towns II in 2008), which found that there had been a 'big reduction' in urban tree planting (compared to a similar 1992 survey) leading to an 'unsatisfactory age structure' with too few young trees, and which concluded that the issue should be 'urgently addressed'.Trees in Towns II, Department for Communities and Local Government, published 2008-02-18, accessed 2010-12-09 In London a separate 2007 report, Chainsaw Massacre, found that there were concerns about planting rates in some boroughs, and that mature broadleaf street trees throughout London were under 'severe threat' due to a mixture of development pressures, reduced expenditure, public apathy and antipathy, and (often unsubstantiated) concerns by insurance companies, solicitors and home-owners over subsidence.Chainsaw massacre: A review of London's street trees Greater London Authority, published 2007-05-01, accessed 2010-12-09 Both reports also expressed concern over the practice of planting smaller ornamental species rather than native broadleaf trees such as London plane, lime and oak. Funding Funding of £4.2m was to be made available for community, civic and other non-profit groups from April 2011.Funding and grants The Big Tree Plant, accessed 2010-12-09 In addition to covering planting costs, grants could be used for related purposes such as community involvement, site surveys and the provision of expert advice. £4m of the funding allocation was being promised by the Forestry Commission through 'efficiency savings and reprioritisation',The Big Tree Plant launched, Horticulture Week, published 2010-12-02, accessed 2010-12-09 while the remaining £200,000 will come from the existing London Tree and Woodland Community Grant.Government launches £4.2m urban tree- planting plan, Manchester Wired, published 2010-12-02, accessed 2010-12-09 The independently chaired Big Tree Plant Grants Panel included representatives from civil society organisations, DEFRA, and the Forestry Commission, and met each spring and summer to award funds.Grants Panel, Forestry Commission, accessed 2010-12-09 In advance of the main funding, Keep Britain Tidy - one of the partners supporting the initiative - had already invited applications for planting kits from schools in the Government's Eco-School programme.The Big Tree Plant - order your free tree planting kit, Keep Britain Tidy, accessed 2010-12-09The Big Tree Plant, Keep Britain Tidy, published 2010-12-06, accessed 2010-12-09 Criticism and reactions The funding arrangements, specifically the fact that the grants would normally only cover up to 75% of the cost of each scheme (although free labour could be offset against this),The Big Tree Plant funding scheme, The Big Tree Plant, accessed 2010-12-09 was criticised by some as favouring better-off over deprived communities.A million trees for England: but who gets them?, The Guardian, published 2010-12-02, accessed 2010-12-09 Other projects which coordinated external funding from local stakeholders were successful. The government claimed that “Seventy percent of the trees in The Big Tree Plant programme are being planted in England’s most deprived areas.” Partners The DEFRA-led The Big Tree Plant campaign was backed by a number of partners including The Tree Council, Woodland Trust, Trees for Cities, England’s 12 Community Forests, the National Forest, BTCV, Civic Voice, Groundwork UK, Keep Britain Tidy, the Local Government Association, the Department for Communities and Local Government and the Forestry Commission.

The president of halhal is Ahmed Mussa The town and surrounding area saw intense fighting during the Eritrean War of Independence. In 1968, the Ethiopian Army commando post there was attacked by Omer Ezaz of the Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF); Ezaz and about 70 of his soldiers were killed. The town was later taken by the ELF, and was controlled by the ELF from 1970 to 1981, when as a result of the Second Eritrean Civil War, control passed to the Eritrean People's Liberation Front. From 1983 to Eritrean independence in 1991, the town was controlled by the Ethiopian Army, except for a brief period of EPLF control in the spring of 1988 following the Battle of Afabet.

It was the third installment of the Story of Us documentaries and studied the historical developments within ancient empires that shaped how we live today. The estimated cost of the production was $36 million for the 12-part series. Nutopia was also responsible for the production of the British and American documentary, Bin Laden: Shoot to Kill, which aired on PBS and Channel 4 in 2011. Before the end of 2012, the production company was responsible for a number of well-received shows in both Britain and the United States. These included How We Invented the World and The British, which aired on Sky Atlantic. Nutopia and The National Geographic Channel announced in 2013 that they would be creating a series, The 80s: The Decade that Made Us. The show was narrated by Rob Lowe and received mainly positive reviews for its study of the decade. Nutopia's next major drama was on the Algerian siege on a gas plant. The show aired in Canada, the United States and also the UK. It documented the events in the run-up and conclusions drawn from the deadly terrorist attack, which left at least 67 dead. In 2014, the production company produced The '90s: The Last Great Decade. It studies events during the decade, with a summary of political, social and economic developments. The programme was a nine-episode series, which aired in the summer of 2014. In 2015, the TV show announced the co-produced documentary, Australia: The Story of Us. It was a regionalized version of the American television documentary series, which studied the history of the country. This included people, places and events that have shaped the country over the last 40,000 years. Towards the end of the year, the Smithsonian Channel aired My Million Dollar Invention. NY Daily News referred to the series as an \\"ambitious 8 part series,\\" which studies a number of historical inventions. The third installment of the decade-based documentaries was televised in 2015, The 2000s: A New Reality. Nutopia also announced the creation of the documentary, Finding Jesus.

Contents Dungeon Master's Design Kit is an aid for Dungeon Masters (DMs), with tips and tables for creating different kinds of scenarios. Book I: Adventure Design describes how to create an adventure scenario and includes a brief sample. Book II: Forms Book includes several types of blank design forms. Book III: Adventure Cookbook consists of inspirational ideas for settings, plots, climaxes, red herrings, moral quandaries, and more. This book identifies and discusses many of the conventional plot, characterization, and thematic features of the fantasy role-playing game genre. Publication history The Dungeon Master's Design Kit was designed by Harold Johnson and Aaron Allston, with a cover by Keith Parkinson and interior illustrations by George Barr. It was published by TSR in 1988 as three 32-page books and an outer folder. It was edited by Christopher Mortika. Reception Ken Rolston reviewed Dungeon Master's Design Kit for Dragon magazine in July 1991. He began his review by expressing his disappointment, saying, \\"the Dungeon Master's Design Kit is based on the use of scads of fill-in-the-blanks forms.\\" He felt that while the forms are \\"useful reminders of all the details that may be needed in an adventure design,\\" they seem to imply that the Dungeon Master should plan and record all those details before running an adventure even when \\"no one method of planning and recording details will be satisfactory for all, or even many, DMs\\". He also said that \\"Almost any instinctive narrative impulse is likely to produce a more lively adventure than following the suggested procedures in this kit.\\" Rolston found the Adventure Cookbook to be the most interesting reading, but said that while newer DMs would find it worthwhile, more experienced ones would find the book too remedial and boring. He considered the later Campaign Sourcebook and Catacomb Guide to be a better DM aid in general, one that gives DMs the ability to create rather than just presenting lists of ideas. Rolston concluded the review by stating: \\"This supplement is nonessential. Exceptionally organized and compulsive DMs who love forms and summary sheets may find it exciting, and some of the plot, setting, and character-building tips could be useful to a DM trying to improve his adventure design. Instinctive or veteran DMs don't usually have the problems this book tries to solve. If you are having trouble designing or organizing your own adventures, however, you might give this a try.\\" Lawrence Schick, in his 1991 book Heroic Worlds, noted the similarities of some of the forms in Forms Book to those found in Wilmark Dynasty's Roomscapes, and called Adventure Design and Adventure Cookbook \\"quite good\\".

Opened in 1868, it forms part of the Pisa–La Spezia–Genoa railway, and is situated between La Spezia and Genoa. The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI). However, the commercial area of the passenger building is managed by Centostazioni. Train services to and from the station are operated by Trenitalia. Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state-owned rail company. Location The station is located in a passageway between the town centre and the promenade. Originally, there was a railway bridge linking Piazza Nostra dell'Orto (north of the station) and Piazza Vittorio Leonardi (to the south). In the early seventies, this bridge was demolished and the pedestrian underpass, which connects only the first track, was extended in both directions. Since then, the underpass has been used as a link between the two parts of the city. Features The passenger building is a masonry structure on two levels, of which only the ground floor is open to the public. The architecture of the building is original and hard to find at Italian railway stations: it is composed of two buildings joined together by a gallery in which there are many amenities for travelers. The station once had a goods yard with an adjoining goods shed. However, the goods yard has since been dismantled and replaced by a parking lot for FS employees, and the warehouse has been converted to storage. The architecture of the former warehouse is very similar to that of other Italian railway stations. There are additional buildings, either on one or two levels, housing the RFI technical departments. The architecture of these buildings is very similar to the two bodies that make up the passenger building. The layout of all the buildings is rectangular. The station yard has three tracks dedicated to passenger service. In detail: *Track 1 : the main platform for trains towards Pisa; *Track 2 : used mainly for trains towards Genoa and sometimes used for overtaking or unusual right hand running of trains; *Track 3 : priority track in both directions. Tracks 4 and 5 are equipped with a starting signal at the Genoa end, and are sometimes used for the overtaking or stopping of short goods trains. During the process of extending the shelter of the platform 2 shelter, which took place in the early 1970s, the passenger service to Genoa was performed using track 4, which had been temporarily fitted with a wooden platform. Passenger and train movements The station has about 3.4 million passenger movements each year. It is served by trains of all categories, from regional to Frecciabianca services. The main destinations are Genova Brignole, La Spezia Centrale, Pisa Centrale, Roma Termini, Milano Centrale and Torino Porta Nuova. Interchange In front of the passenger building is a bus stop for urban and suburban buses, operated by ATP.

It originally aired on October 28, 2010. The episode was written by Kevin Williamson and Julie Plec and directed by Charles Beeson. Plot Caroline (Candice Accola) is at the Salvatore house and tells Damon (Ian Somerhalder) and Stefan (Paul Wesley) that she met Katherine (Nina Dobrev) at the Grill. Katherine wants to deliver a message to the Salvatore brothers; bring her the moonstone at tonight's Masquerade Ball otherwise she will rip the town apart. The brothers agree that they have to kill Katherine and they start making their plan of how to do it. Jenna (Sara Canning) gets back home after her \\"accident\\" with the knife and Elena and Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen) take care of her while Matt (Zach Roerig) helps them. Jeremy follows Elena in the kitchen and asks her what they will do about Katherine and Elena says nothing since now she will do whatever Katherine wants and she will stay away from Stefan. Jeremy does not believe that Katherine will stay away and leaves to go to the Salvatore house. Bonnie (Kat Graham) arrives at the Salvatore house as well, where she finds Damon, Stefan, Jeremy, Caroline and Alaric (Matt Davis) getting ready for their plan against Katherine. Alaric shows them everything about his weapons and how to kill a vampire but they need Bonnie's help so they can trap Katherine with a spell in a room at the Lockwood house so Damon and Stefan can kill her. Bonnie hesitates at first but agrees to help under the condition that no one will get hurt. In the meantime, Katherine gets ready for the Ball when a Lucy (Natashia Williams) appears, a witch that Katherine called to help her get the moonstone back. She knows that Damon and Stefan will not give it without putting up a fight and she wants to be covered and she will take Lucy as her \\"plus one\\" at the Ball. After she will get the moonstone, she will need Lucy's help to break the curse. Back at the Gilbert house, Matt heads to the Ball and he acts weird when he tells Elena that he has something to do but he can't tell her what. Elena tells him that she will stay home because she does not want to run into Stefan, having no idea what they all plan to do. Alaric gets there a little bit later since he has to keep an eye on Elena so she will not leave the house and get to the Ball. At the Ball, Katherine arrives with Lucy and she runs into Matt. Matt is surprised seeing \\"Elena\\" there since she told him that she wouldn't come. Katherine compels him again to be sure that he knows what to do with Tyler (Michael Trevino) and when she is reassured that he does, she tells him to go. Stefan and Damon also arrive and look around to see if Katherine is there, while Jeremy and Bonnie find a room to prepare it with the spell. After preparing the room, Jeremy and Bonnie return to the party when Bonnie gets a weird vibe. She follows her feeling and gets to Lucy asking her if they know each other. Lucy says no and leaves and Bonnie tries to ignore her feeling telling Jeremy that they have to tell Stefan and Damon that the room is ready. Elena wonders why all her friends are at the Ball and asks Alaric what is going on but he does not want to tell her. He eventually does when she says that she will go to the Ball and Alaric has to stop her. Elena says she will stay home but she sneaks out telling Alaric and Jenna that she is going to sleep. At the Ball, Katherine asks Stefan for a dance and while they are dancing she demands to give her the moonstone. Stefan says that he will if she follows him someplace where they will be alone, it's either his way or none. Aimee (Tiya Sircar) interrupts them and Katherine kills her to show Stefan that she is not playing; he should give her the moonstone or people will start dying. Stefan freaks out and wants to stop the whole thing but Damon convinces him that they have to finish it and they go to the room waiting and texting Jeremy that it is his turn. Meanwhile, Lucy catches up Katherine worrying of the involvement of another witch and Katherine tells her that there is nothing to worry about. Jeremy interrupts them asking to talk to his sister and when Lucy leaves, he tells Katherine to meet Damon and Stefan by the lake for the switch and he walks away while texting Caroline to be ready. As soon as he gets out of sight, Elena pulls him aside and asks what is going on. Katherine, suspecting that the Salvatores are up to something, turns to Caroline and demands to tell her what is going on. Caroline pretends that she does not know but under Katherine's threats, she tells her that they are planning to kill her, that Bonnie has the moonstone and that she is upstairs. Katherine gets upstairs with Caroline and falls into the trap imprisoning herself into the room where Damon and Stefan are waiting for her. Meanwhile, Jeremy and Bonnie fill Elena in who thinks they are crazy before she bursts into pain exactly the same moment Damon fires a stake at Katherine's back. Bonnie figures out that Elena is linked to Katherine and tells Jeremy to run and tell Damon and Stefan to stop because they are hurting Elena. Jeremy gets to the room just in time to stop Damon from killing Katherine and in extent, Elena. Damon looks surprised and Katherine explains that she also has a witch on her side. Bonnie realizes that the woman she saw earlier is a witch and tries to find her so she can break the link between Elena and Katherine. She finds her and asks her undo the spell but Lucy tries to walk away making Bonnie grab her arm. Lucy senses that Bonnie has the moonstone and asks her to give it to her telling her that she can trust her. Meanwhile, Tyler and Matt are at Tyler's father office drinking along with Sarah (Maiara Walsh). Matt tries to get Tyler drunk and then starts doing things that get him mad. The two of them start to fight and Caroline, who overhears them, gets there and break them up. Matt says that he has to \\"finish\\" it, Tyler is confused of what is wrong with him and Caroline to manage stop Matt, she hits him. Sarah, who is revealed to be under compulsion as well, attacks Tyler and stabs him in the shoulder. Tyler pushes her back to defend himself and Sarah hits her head and dies, making Tyler trigger the curse and become a werewolf. Back at the room, Lucy joins the three vampires having the moonstone in her possession. She informs Katherine that the spell on the room has been broken and she is free to go. She gives her the moonstone while first made it clear that after that she will not ask her for any more favors. Katherine agrees and takes the moonstone but she struggles under a power while Lucy tells her that she should have told her that there was a Bennett witch involved. Lucy tells Damon and Stefan that she has lifted the spell that binds Elena to Katherine, apologizes for her involvement and leaves. Katherine wakes up in the tomb where Damon thought she had been all these years. Damon is standing outside and tells her that death would be very kind and that is why they entomb her. Katherine yells at him that he can't do this because they need her and because Elena is in danger. Elena is the doppelgänger and has to be protected. Damon says that he will protect her and closes the tomb's door trapping Katherine inside. Stefan finds Elena in the Lockwood garden by the lake and tells her that Katherine is gone but Elena still doesn't change her mind about the two of them getting back together until she can be sure that everyone she cares about is safe. She walks away and gets to her car at the parking lot, but before she gets in a mysterious figure with a mask on his face grabs her and takes her away.

Awesome on like 9 million levels. [...] We’ve now opened so many doors with Tyler being a werewolf, Bonnie getting into her power, Lucy as a reoccurring character, and of course the doppelganger business. I also like that Elena didn’t get right back together with Stefan. This show just keeps getting better, and I can’t wait to see where they take us next!\\" Diana Steenbergen from IGN rated the episode with 9/10 stating that Dobrev continues her excellent work as both the evil Katherine and the sweet, earnest Elena and closes the review: \\"It is somewhat surprising that Katherine has been defeated this early in the season, but I am not complaining. The Vampire Diaries moves quickly, and it is better to move on before Katherine becomes one of those tiresome villains who can never be defeated. Although the show is wise to keep her alive; she hints that Elena is still in danger and that she has some information. I'm sure we will be getting back to Katherine and her information sooner or later.\\" Counter to Steenbergen, Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic rated the episode with 3.5/5 saying that the episode was mediocre and a bit slow. \\"Not my favorite episode of The Vampire Diaries overall. But, as I said above, I'll take a disappointing installment over almost anything else on TV any day of the week.\\" Robin Franson Pruter from Forced Viewing rated the episode with 3/4. \\"Overall, there were enough good moments and developments in this episode for me to give it a positive star-rating. It’s entertaining to watch. However, it’s not as good as it should have been for such an important episode, and it’s not among the best of the series.\\" Tiffany of Den of Geek gave a good review to the episode saying that it made her have her hopes up. \\"All I can say is that next week better be one fantastic episode. They have my hopes up. This show is really picking up steam and I don't want it to have a midseason slump that kills the momentum they have going for them. There are some wonderful storylines going this season.

Biography After having studied at the Notre-Dame de Paris with Louis Homet (1691-1767) until 1748 and afterwards with Antoine Goulet, Giroust got appointed as maître de musique (Kapellmeister) at the cathedral of Orléans, where he stayed until 1769. He was very much appreciated by his employers. He also became the leader of the music academy of Orléans (1757-1765), which became a big yet temporary success soon after his appointment.Roger Cotte, François Giroust, a Versaille musician of the Revolutionary period, in Malcolm Boyd (ed.), Music and the French Revolution, Cambridge 1992, p. 93-106. Two of his works won both 1st and 2nd place in a contest for composers of the Concert Spirituel, organised by the Tuileries in Paris, 1768. Because of this, he was appointed as kapellmeister at the church of the Saint-Innocents in Paris. On the 17th of February 1775, Giroust became sous maître de chapelle at the Chapelle Royale at Versailles, replacing Charles Gauzargues. This took place under Louis XVI's reign. During his time in this position, he composed the Coronation Mass for Louis XVI, and the Missa pro defunctis for Louis XV. In 1780, Giroust was appointed as surintendant of the same chapel, a post he kept until 1792. After some financial hardships, he became a concierge at the Palace of Versailles, where he died on 28 April 1799. Giroust is well known for his many revolutionary pieces, among which the Hymne des Versaillais is the most famous. He joined the revolutionaries after the fall of the monarchy in 1792. Most of his masonic works have been lost, with the exception of the cantata Le Déluge. The majority of his other compositions have been saved by his widow Marie-Françoise de Beaumont d'Avantois, who was a singer at the same court. They are now conserved by the Paris Conservatory.

Located in Carlow town, the cathedral was dedicated to the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in 1833. It is known for its beautifully detailed spire which is one of the highest points in the town. Cathedra View of nave History The foundation stone of the cathedral was laid on 18 March 1828 by Bishop James Doyle. The Cathedral of the Assumption is the second oldest Roman Catholic cathedral built in Ireland, after the Cathedral of the Most Holy Trinity, Waterford, built in 1793; building commenced on the cathedral 7 April 1828.http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~irlcar2/Carlow_Cathedral.htm When the cathedral was completed in 1833, the old church built by Dean Staunton was demolished, although part of the transept wall was retained. The cathedral was dedicated by Bishop Doyle on 1 Dec. 1833; and consecrated by Bishop Matthew Cullen on 30 November 1933.McEvoy, John. \\"History of the Cathedral\\", Carlow Cathedral, 2000 Vestments worn at the dedication by the celebrant, deacon, and subdeacon were made by the Presentation Sisters. Bishop Doyle died in 1834 at the age of 48 and was interred before the high altar. A monument to Bishop Doyle was placed in the cathedral in 1840. A parishioner took action in the Supreme Court against the Cathedral Administrator, Father John Byrne, and the trustees of the Diocese of Kildare and Leighlin in 1996 to prevent the re- ordering of the interior in line with the changes recommended by the Second Vatican Council. The action was unsuccessful and the changes, including the removal of the altar rails and pulpit, went ahead. The cathedral was rededicated on 22 June 1997. The 2013 Christmas Eve mass was broadcast on RTÉ and the Christmas Day Eurovision mass celebrated by Bishop Denis Nulty was broadcast to Europe from the cathedral. The 2003 Easter ceremonies were broadcast to Europe from Carlow as well. Ahead of the World Meeting of Families 2018 in Dublin, Cardinal Peter Turkson from Ghana was announced as homilist at the opening ceremony at this cathedral. Architecture The cathedral is built next door to St. Patrick's, Carlow College, the former seminary of the diocese. Architect Thomas Cobden, designer of much of the adjacent college, designed the cathedral, in the Gothic Revival style. The tower and lantern was inspired by the Belfry of Bruges, Belgium. The grey-blue stone was from the quarry on the Tullow Road. Colonel Henry Bruen of Oak Park supplied the white marble from his quarry in Graiguenaspidogue a few kilometres south of Carlow town. He also supplied the Oak for the great-framed roof came from nearby Oak Park. In 1873, Bishop Keeffe's grand-niece donated two Caen stone altars to replace the wooden side altars. They were later removed, one to the college chapel, and one to the presbytery. The stone side altars themselves were later replaced with marble. The Sacred Heart altar was a gift of Mary Agnes Kinsella, of the Royal Hotel, in memory of her brother Edward. Its stone predecessor sent to the Paulstown parish church. The Lady altar erected in 1904 was donated by Mr. and Mrs. Michael Molloy, and the previous stone altar sent to Tinryland. In 1878, Miss Keeffe donated a stained-glass window depicting St. Patrick, for the north transept, in memory of her grand-uncle. Furnishings In 1855, an organ, purchased at the Paris Exhibition, was installed in the south transept, but later moved to the gallery. It was replaced in 1944.Hickey, Francis. \\"If Carlow Cathedral Could Speak\\", Carlovania, Old Carlow Society, December 1954 Extensive refurbishment was carried out in 1899 under Bishop Michael Comerford. A carved oak pulpit was designed by C.J. Buckley of Youghal and made in Bruges in 1898. The ornately carved pulpit is now in the Carlow County Museum.Carlow County Museum The main altar of Sicilian marble replaced the original wooden one. The new altar was consecrated by Bishop Comerford on 25 May 1890. It was made by Samuel Daly and Sons of Cork, and donated by the clergy and religious of the diocese in memory of the Very Rev. James Walsh, Bishop from 1856 to 1888. Bishop Walsh is buried in the cathedral in the same grave as his kinsman, Bishop Delany. Comerford also gave and consecrated the great bell, cast by John Warren and Sons of London. The oak-framed Stations of the Cross, donated by various Carlow families, were erected in 1896. In 1902 the stone baptismal font was replaced by a marble one as a memorial from the people of Carlow of Rev. John Corbett C.C., who died in accident while out shooting. The marble communion rails were installed in 1903. The Episcopal chair, fashioned in Bruges, is of paneled oak from the nearby estate of Oak Park. The marble statue of St. Patrick next to the Sacred Heart altar was a gift from the priests of the diocese in memory of Bishop Patrick Foley. Burials * Bishop James Warren Doyle, O.E.S.A.

Her more than 50 novels feature strong Christian values and were popular in their time. Life Guyton was born Emma Jane Worboys in Birmingham on 20 April 1825 to George Baddeley Worboys (c. 1803–1867), a gunsmith, and his wife, Maria Lane (c. 1807–post 1887). Emma was a lifelong Congregationalist. She attended boarding school and may have worked as a governess. Though Guyton described herself late in life as the widow of a Mr Etherington Guyton, a Baptist minister of French descent, no evidence for the existence of such a person has been found. She began to suffer from alcoholism, which brought about her death on 25 August 1887 at Clevedon, Somerset.ODNB entry: Retrieved 20 July 2011. Subscription required. Writings Guyton's first book, published under the name Worboise, was the novel Alice Cunningham (1846). It was followed by about fifty other novels with a Christian message, which were very popular in their time. Thornycroft Hall (1864), Crystabel (1873) and A Woman's Patience (1879) are among titles to have been reissued in print-on-demand editions.E. g., Dodo Press, 2008, ; 2008, ; 2009, , respectively. The theology that underlies Guyton's novels has attracted some critical attention.E. g. in Julie Melnyk, ed.: Women's Theology in Nineteenth-century Britain... (New York/London: Garland, 1998). According to another recent scholar, \\"Worboise uses her novels to enter debates about the relation of religion to gender and to public life. Worboise's ideal is a wholehearted application of Christian values to all areas of life.... This holistic commitment to a religion of the heart, but also of action, in all areas of life underpins Worboise's challenge to the cultural division of sacred from secular, private from public, and feminine from masculine.\\"Rebecca Styler: Literary Theology by Women Writers of the Nineteenth Century (Farnham, Surrey, UK: Ashgate, 2010), p. 9. . Guyton greatly admired Dr Thomas Arnold, the educational reformer and headmaster of Rugby School, whose life she published in 1859. She began to write for the newspaper Christian World in 1857. She edited the monthly Christian World Magazine and Family Visitor from 1866 to 1885, and many of her own novels were serialized there.ODNB entry.

According to its website, its aims are \\"to encourage philosophical debate between professional and non-professional philosophers in a non-technical way; to provide a forum for an active exchange of ideas and information; to give guidance and information concerning courses as well as relevant literature in philosophy; to inspire those interested in philosophy to develop their interest further.\\" PFA is believed to be the largest philosophy organisation in London. Its biannual Public Lecture is often attended by more than 100 people, and its monthly Kant's Cave talks, often given by notable academics, regularly draw around 70 people to a room above a pub in Euston. During the early years of the new millennium, PFA organised a series of Round Table debates where four leading philosophers and audiences of around 150 people debated issues such as the relationship between science and philosophy. The PFA Public Lectures are a series of lectures held about every six months (from 2003 onwards) where a well-known thinker gives a lecture and then has a discussion session with the audience. The lectures give members of the public the opportunity to question and discuss with internationally-known philosophers, who have included Simon Blackburn, Antony Flew, Piers Benn, Jonathan Glover, Anthony Grayling, Ted Honderich, Moshe Machover, Nicholas Maxwell, Mary Margaret McCabe, Mary Midgley, David Papineau, Janet Radcliffe Richards, Barry C. Smith, Jonathan Wolff, Raymond Tallis, and Colin Wilson. Other regular monthly Philosophy For All events include a philosophy film club, seminars on important philosophical texts, and regular Philosophical Walks in the countryside around London. PFA Fargo-Moorhead Since 2003, Philosophy For All has had a US chapter based in the twin cities of Fargo, North Dakota and Moorhead, Minnesota. Founded by Dr Mark Chekola, it meets monthly at the Plains Art Museum in Fargo.

The New Yorker has reported that Daniel arap Moi family corruption On 31 August 2007, The Guardian featured on its front page a story about corruption by the family of the former Kenyan leader Daniel arap Moi. The newspaper stated that the source of the information was WikiLeaks. Bank Julius Baer lawsuit In February 2008, the wikileaks.org domain name was taken offline after the Swiss Bank Julius Baer sued WikiLeaks and the wikileaks.org domain registrar, Dynadot, in a court in California, United States, and obtained a permanent injunction ordering the shutdown. WikiLeaks had hosted allegations of illegal activities at the bank's Cayman Islands branch. WikiLeaks' U.S. Registrar, Dynadot, complied with the order by removing its DNS entries. However, the website remained accessible via its numeric IP address, and online activists immediately mirrored WikiLeaks at dozens of alternative websites worldwide. The American Civil Liberties Union and the Electronic Frontier Foundation filed a motion protesting the censorship of WikiLeaks. The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press assembled a coalition of media and press that filed an amicus curiae brief on WikiLeaks' behalf. The coalition included major U.S. newspaper publishers and press organisations, such as the American Society of News Editors, the Associated Press, the Citizen Media Law Project, the E. W. Scripps Company, the Gannett Company, the Hearst Corporation, the Los Angeles Times, the National Newspaper Publishers Association, the Newspaper Association of America and the Society of Professional Journalists. The coalition requested to be heard as a friend of the court to call attention to relevant points of law that it believed the court had overlooked (on the grounds that WikiLeaks had not appeared in court to defend itself, and that no First Amendment issues had yet been raised before the court). Amongst other things, the coalition argued that: > WikiLeaks provides a forum for dissidents and whistleblowers across the > globe to post documents, but the Dynadot injunction imposes a prior > restraint that drastically curtails access to Wikileaks from the Internet > based on a limited number of postings challenged by Plaintiffs. The Dynadot > injunction therefore violates the bedrock principle that an injunction > cannot enjoin all communication by a publisher or other speaker. The same judge, Jeffrey White, who issued the injunction vacated it on 29 February 2008, citing First Amendment concerns and questions about legal jurisdiction. WikiLeaks was thus able to bring its site online again. The bank dropped the case on 5 March 2008. The judge also denied the bank's request for an order prohibiting the website's publication. The executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, Lucy Dalglish, commented: > It's not very often a federal judge does a 180 degree turn in a case and > dissolves an order. But we're very pleased the judge recognized the > constitutional implications in this prior restraint. Guantanamo Bay procedures A copy of Standard Operating Procedures for Camp Delta–the protocol of the U.S. Army at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp–dated March 2003 was released on the WikiLeaks website on 7 November 2007.\\"Sensitive Guantánamo Bay Manual Leaked Through Wiki Site\\", Wired 14 November 2007 The document, named \\"gitmo-sop.pdf\\", is also mirrored at The Guardian.specific address at The Guardian. Its release revealed some of the restrictions placed over detainees at the camp, including the designation of some prisoners as off-limits to the International Committee of the Red Cross, something that the U.S. military had in the past repeatedly denied. It also showed that military dogs are used to intimidate prisoners, that children as young as 15 are held at Guantanamo and that new prisoners are held in isolation for two weeks to make them more pliable. On 3 December 2007, WikiLeaks released a copy of the 2004 edition of the manual, together with a detailed analysis of the changes. Tibetan dissent in China On 24 March 2008, WikiLeaks made 35 uncensored videos of civil unrest in Tibet available for viewing, to get around official Chinese censorship during the worst of the unrest.\\"Wikileaks defies 'great firewall of China'\\", The Guardian, 19 March 2008 Scientology On 24 March 2008, WikiLeaks published what they referred to as \\"the collected secret 'bibles' of Scientology\\". On 7 April 2008, they reported receiving a letter (dated 27 March) from the Religious Technology Center claiming ownership of the several documents pertaining to OT Levels within the Church of Scientology. These same documents were at the center of a 1994 scandal. The email stated: The letter continued on to request the release of the logs of the uploader, which would remove their anonymity. WikiLeaks responded with a statement released on Wikinews stating: \\"in response to the attempted suppression, WikiLeaks will release several thousand additional pages of Scientology material next week\\", and did so. Sarah Palin's Yahoo! email account contents In September 2008, during the 2008 United States presidential election campaigns, the contents of a Yahoo! account belonging to Sarah Palin (the running mate of Republican presidential nominee John McCain) were posted on WikiLeaks after being hacked into by members of Anonymous.See the article \\"Anonymous (Group)\\" It has been alleged by Wired that contents of the mailbox indicate that she used the private Yahoo! account to send work-related messages, in violation of public record laws. The hacking of the account was widely reported in mainstream news outlets. Although WikiLeaks was able to conceal the hacker's identity, the source of the Palin emails was eventually publicly identified as David Kernell, a 20-year-old economics student at the University of Tennessee and the son of Democratic Tennessee State Representative Mike Kernell from Memphis, whose email address (as listed on various social networking sites) was linked to the hacker's identity on Anonymous. Kernell attempted to conceal his identity by using the anonymous proxy service ctunnel.com, but, because of the illegal nature of the access, ctunnel website administrator Gabriel Ramuglia assisted the FBI in tracking down the source of the hack. Killings by the Kenyan police WikiLeaks publicised reports on extrajudicial executions by Kenyan police for one week starting 1 November 2008 on its home page. Two of the human rights investigators involved, Oscar Kamau Kingara and John Paul Oulu, who made major contributions to a Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR) report that was redistributed by WikiLeaks, The Cry of Blood – Report on Extra-Judicial Killings and Disappearances, were assassinated several months later, on 5 March 2009. WikiLeaks called for information on the assassination. In 2009, Amnesty International UK gave WikiLeaks and Julian Assange an award for the distribution of the KNCHR's The Cry of Blood report. BNP membership list After briefly appearing on a blog, the membership list of the far-right British National Party was posted to WikiLeaks on 18 November 2008. The name, address, age and occupation of many of the 13,500 members were given, including several police officers, two solicitors, four ministers of religion, at least one doctor, and a number of primary and secondary school teachers. In Britain, police officers are banned from joining or promoting the BNP, and at least one officer was dismissed for being a member. The BNP was known for going to considerable lengths to conceal the identities of members. On 19 November, BNP leader Nick Griffin stated that he knew the identity of the person who initially leaked the list on 17 November, describing him as a \\"hardliner\\" senior employee who left the party in 2007. On 20 October 2009, a list of BNP members from April 2009 was leaked. This list contained 11,811 members. 2009 Congressional Research Service reports On 7 February 2009, WikiLeaks released 6,780 Congressional Research Service reports. Contributors to Coleman campaign In March 2009, WikiLeaks published a list of contributors to the Norm Coleman senatorial campaign. Climategate emails In November 2009, controversial documents, including e-mail correspondence between climate scientists, were released (allegedly after being illegally obtained) from the University of East Anglia's (UEA) Climatic Research Unit (CRU). According to the university, the emails and documents were obtained through a server hacking; one prominent host of the full 120 MB archive was WikiLeaks. Barclays Bank tax avoidance In March 2009 documents concerning complex arrangements made by Barclays Bank to avoid tax appeared on Wikileaks.NRC Handelsblad, 17 March 2009 The documents had been ordered to be removed from the website of The Guardian. In an editorial on the issue, The Guardian pointed out that, due to the mismatch of resources, tax collectors (HMRC) now have to rely on websites such as Wikileaks to obtain such documents. Internet censorship lists WikiLeaks has published the lists of forbidden or illegal web addresses for several countries. On 19 March 2009, WikiLeaks published what was alleged to be the Australian Communications and Media Authority's blacklist of sites to be banned under Australia's proposed laws on Internet censorship. Reactions to the publication of the list by the Australian media and politicians were varied. Particular note was made by journalistic outlets of the type of websites on the list; while the Internet censorship scheme submitted by the Australian Labor Party in 2008 was proposed with the stated intention of preventing access to child pornography and sites related to terrorism, the list leaked on WikiLeaks contains a number of sites unrelated to sex crimes involving minors. When questioned about the leak, Stephen Conroy, the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy in Australia's Rudd Labor Government, responded by claiming that the list was not the actual list, yet threatening to prosecute anyone involved in distributing it. On 20 March 2009, WikiLeaks published an updated list, dated 18 March 2009; it more closely matches the claimed size of the ACMA blacklist, and contains two pages that have been independently confirmed as blacklisted by ACMA. WikiLeaks also contains details of Internet censorship in Thailand, including lists of censored sites dating back to May 2006. Wikileaks published a list of web sites blacklisted by Denmark. Bilderberg Group meeting reports Since May 2009, WikiLeaks has made available reports of several meetings of the Bilderberg Group. It includes the group's history and meeting reports from the years 1955, 1956, 1957, 1958, 1960, 1962, 1963 and 1980. 2008 Peru oil scandal On 28 January 2009, WikiLeaks released 86 telephone intercept recordings of Peruvian politicians and businessmen involved in the \\"Petrogate\\" oil scandal. The release of the tapes featured on the front pages of five Peruvian newspapers. Nuclear accident in Iran On 16 July 2009, Iranian news agencies reported that the head of Iran's atomic energy organization Gholam Reza Aghazadeh had abruptly resigned for unknown reasons after twelve years in office. Shortly afterwards WikiLeaks released a report disclosing a \\"serious nuclear accident\\" at the Iranian Natanz nuclear facility in 2009. The Federation of American Scientists (FAS) released statistics that say the number of enriched centrifuges operational in Iran mysteriously declined from about 4,700 to about 3,900 beginning around the time the nuclear incident WikiLeaks mentioned would have occurred. According to media reports the accident may have been the direct result of a cyberattack at Iran's nuclear program, carried out with the Stuxnet computer worm. Toxic dumping in Africa: The Minton report In September 2006, commodities giant Trafigura commissioned an internal report about a toxic dumping incident in the Ivory Coast, which (according to the United Nations) affected 108,000 people. The document, called the Minton Report, names various harmful chemicals \\"likely to be present\\" in the waste and notes that some of them \\"may cause harm at some distance\\". The report states that potential health effects include \\"burns to the skin, eyes and lungs, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of consciousness and death\\", and suggests that the high number of reported casualties is \\"consistent with there having been a significant release of hydrogen sulphide gas\\". On 11 September 2009, Trafigura's lawyers, Carter-Ruck, obtained a secret \\"super-injunction\\" against The Guardian, banning that newspaper from publishing the contents of the document. Trafigura also threatened a number of other media organizations with legal action if they published the report's contents, including the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation and The Chemical Engineer magazine. On 14 September 2009, WikiLeaks posted the report. On 12 October, Carter-Ruck warned The Guardian against mentioning the content of a parliamentary question that was due to be asked about the report. Instead, the paper published an article stating that they were unable to report on an unspecified question and claiming that the situation appeared to \\"call into question privileges guaranteeing free speech established under the 1689 Bill of Rights\\".Leigh, David (12 October 2009).

The injunction was lifted on 16 October. Kaupthing Bank WikiLeaks made available an internal document from Kaupthing Bank from just prior to the collapse of Iceland's banking sector, which led to the 2008–2012 Icelandic financial crisis. The document shows that suspiciously large sums of money were loaned to various owners of the bank, and large debts written off. Kaupthing's lawyers have threatened WikiLeaks with legal action, citing banking privacy laws. The leak has caused an uproar in Iceland. Criminal charges relating to the multibillion-euro loans to Exista and other major shareholders are being investigated. The bank is seeking to recover loans taken out by former bank employees before its collapse. Joint Services Protocol 440 In October 2009, Joint Services Protocol 440, a 2,400-page restricted document written in 2001 by the British Ministry of Defence was leaked. It contained instructions for the security services on how to avoid leaks of information by hackers, journalists, and foreign spies.Tom Chivers. \\"MoD 'how to stop leaks' document is leaked\\" The Daily Telegraph 5 October 2009.

Chelsea Manning (see below) commented that those were from an NSA database. Among the released messages are communications between Pentagon officials and New York City Police Department. 2010 U.S. Intelligence report on WikiLeaks DOD document on OIF, published by WikiLeaks On 15 March 2010, WikiLeaks released a secret 32-page U.S. Department of Defense Counterintelligence Analysis Report from March 2008. The document described some prominent reports leaked on the website. These related to U.S. security interests, and described potential methods of marginalizing the organization. WikiLeaks editor Julian Assange said that some details in the Army report were inaccurate and its recommendations flawed, and also that the concerns of the U.S. Army raised by the report were hypothetical. The report discussed deterring potential whistleblowers via termination of employment and criminal prosecution of any existing or former insiders, leakers or whistleblowers. Reasons for the report include notable leaks such as U.S. equipment expenditure, human rights violations in Guantanamo Bay, and the battle over the Iraqi town of Fallujah. Baghdad airstrike video On 5 April 2010, WikiLeaks released classified U.S. military footage from a series of attacks on 12 July 2007 in Baghdad by a U.S. helicopter that killed 12–18 people,Keller, Bill, Dealing With Assange and the WikiLeaks Secrets, New York Times, adapted from introduction to the book Open Secrets, 26 January 2011 including two Reuters news staff, Saeed Chmagh and Namir Noor-Eldeen, on a website called \\"Collateral Murder\\". The attack also wounded others including two children who were in a van that was fired on when it came to collect the wounded men. The footage consisted of a 39-minute unedited version and an 18-minute version that had been edited and annotated. According to some media reports, the Reuters news staff were in the company of armed men and the pilots may have thought Chmagh and Noor-Eldeen were carrying weapons (which was actually camera equipment). The footage includes audio from the American pilots during the shooting. After wounding two children one pilot says \\"Well, it’s their fault for bringing their kids into a battle\\". The military conducted an investigation into the incident and found there were two rocket propelled grenade launchers and one AK-47 among the dead. In the week following the release, \\"Wikileaks\\" was the search term with the most significant growth worldwide in the last seven days as measured by Google Insights.Current Google Insights trends: Wikileaks posts classified military video, Masters, The Independent, (12 April 2010) Chelsea Manning A 22-year-old US Army intelligence analyst, PFC (formerly SPC) Chelsea Manning (formerly Bradley Manning), was arrested after alleged chat logs were turned in to the authorities by former hacker Adrian Lamo, in whom she had confided. Manning reportedly told Lamo she had leaked the Baghdad airstrike video, in addition to a video of the Granai airstrike and around 260,000 diplomatic cables, to WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks said \\"allegations in Wired that we have been sent 260,000 classified US embassy cables are, as far as we can tell, incorrect.\\" WikiLeaks have said that they are unable as yet to confirm whether or not Manning was actually the source of the video, stating \\"we never collect personal information on our sources\\", but that they have nonetheless \\"taken steps to arrange for (Manning's) protection and legal defence.\\" On 21 June Julian Assange told The Guardian that WikiLeaks had hired three US criminal lawyers to defend Manning but that they had not been given access to her. On 28 February 2013, Manning confessed in open court to providing vast archives of military and diplomatic files to WikiLeaks. She pleaded guilty to 10 criminal counts in connection with the huge amount of material she leaked, which included videos of airstrikes in Iraq and Afghanistan in which civilians were killed, logs of military incident reports, assessment files of detainees held at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and a quarter-million cables from American diplomats stationed around the world. She read a statement recounting how she joined the military, became an intelligence analyst in Iraq, decided that certain files should become known to the American public to prompt a wider debate about foreign policy, downloaded them from a secure computer network and then ultimately uploaded them to WikiLeaks. Manning reportedly wrote, \\"Everywhere there's a U.S. post, there's a diplomatic scandal that will be revealed.\\" According to The Washington Post, she also described the cables as \\"explaining how the first world exploits the third, in detail, from an internal perspective.\\" Afghan War Diary On 25 July 2010, WikiLeaks released to The Guardian, The New York Times, and Der Spiegel over 92,000 documents related to the war in Afghanistan between 2004 and the end of 2009. The documents detail individual incidents including friendly fire and civilian casualties. The scale of the leak was described by Julian Assange as comparable to that of the Pentagon Papers in the 1970s. The documents were released to the public on 25 July 2010. On 29 July 2010 WikiLeaks added a 1.4 GB \\"insurance file\\" to the Afghan War Diary page, whose decryption details would be released if WikiLeaks or Assange were harmed. About 15,000 of the 92,000 documents have not yet been released on WikiLeaks, as the group is currently reviewing the documents to remove some of the sources of the information. Speaking to a group in London in August 2010, Assange said that the group will \\"absolutely\\" release the remaining documents. He stated that WikiLeaks has requested help from the Pentagon and human-rights groups to help redact the names, but has not received any assistance. He also stated that WikiLeaks is \\"not obligated to protect other people's sources...unless it is from unjust retribution.\\" According to a report on the Daily Beast website, the Obama administration has asked Britain, Germany and Australia among others to consider bringing criminal charges against Assange for the Afghan war leaks and to help limit Assange's travels across international borders. In the United States, a joint investigation by the Army and the Federal Bureau of Investigation may try to prosecute \\"Mr. Assange and others involved on grounds they encouraged the theft of government property\\". The Australia Defence Association (ADA) stated that WikiLeaks' Julian Assange \\"could have committed a serious criminal offence in helping an enemy of the Australian Defence Force (ADF).\\" Neil James, the executive director of ADA, states: \\"Put bluntly, Wikileaks is not authorised in international or Australian law, nor equipped morally or operationally, to judge whether open publication of such material risks the safety, security, morale and legitimate objectives of Australian and allied troops fighting in a UN-endorsed military operation.\\" WikiLeaks' recent leaking of classified U.S. intelligence has been described by commentator of The Wall Street Journal as having \\"endangered the lives of Afghan informants\\" and \\"the dozens of Afghan civilians named in the document dump as U.S. military informants. Their lives, as well as those of their entire families, are now at terrible risk of Taliban reprisal.\\" When interviewed, Assange stated that WikiLeaks has withheld some 15,000 documents that identify informants to avoid putting their lives at risk. Specifically, Voice of America reported in August 2010 that Assange, responding to such criticisms, stated that the 15,000 still held documents are being reviewed \\"line by line,\\" and that the names of \\"innocent parties who are under reasonable threat\\" will be removed. Greg Gutfeld of Fox News described the leaking as \\"WikiLeaks' Crusade Against the U.S. Military.\\" John Pilger has reported that prior to the release of the Afghan War Diaries in July, WikiLeaks contacted the White House in writing, asking that it identify names that might draw reprisals, but received no response.WikiLeaks and Pentagon Disagree About Talks 19 August 2010 According to the New York Times, Amnesty International and Reporters Without Borders criticized WikiLeaks for what they saw as risking people's lives by identifying Afghans acting as informers. A Taliban spokesman said that the Taliban had formed a nine-member \\"commission\\" to review the documents \\"to find about people who are spying.\\" He said the Taliban had a \\"wanted\\" list of 1,800 Afghans and was comparing that with names WikiLeaks provided, stating \\"after the process is completed, our Taliban court will decide about such people.\\" Love Parade documents Following the Love Parade stampede in Duisburg, Germany on 24 July 2010, the local news blog Xtranews published internal documents of the city administration regarding Love Parade planning and actions by the authorities. The city government reacted by acquiring a court order on 16 August forcing Xtranews to remove the documents from its blog.Konrad Lischka: Einstweilige Verfügung – Duisburg verbietet Blogger- Veröffentlichung zur Love Parade at Spiegel Online on 18 August 2010 (German) Two days later, however, after the documents had surfaced on other websites as well, the government stated that it would not conduct any further legal actions against the publication of the documents.Loveparade-Dokumente offen im Internet at wdr.de (German. Retrieved 26 August 2010. On 20 August WikiLeaks released a publication titled Loveparade 2010 Duisburg planning documents, 2007–2010, which comprised 43 internal documents regarding the Love Parade 2010.WikiLeaks releases documents on Love Parade tragedy at news.com.au on 21 August 2010 Iraq War logs In October 2010, it was reported that WikiLeaks was planning to release up to 400,000 documents relating to the Iraq War. Julian Assange initially denied the reports, stating: \\"WikiLeaks does not speak about upcoming releases dates, indeed, with very rare exceptions we do not communicate any specific information about upcoming releases, since that simply provides fodder for abusive organizations to get their spin machines ready.\\" The Guardian reported on 21 October 2010 that it had received almost 400,000 Iraq war documents from WikiLeaks. On 22 October 2010, Al Jazeera was the first to release analyses of the leak, dubbed The War Logs. WikiLeaks posted a tweet that \\"Al Jazeera have broken our embargo by 30 minutes. We release everyone from their Iraq War Logs embargoes.\\" This prompted other news organizations to release their articles based on the source material. The release of the documents coincided with a return of the main wikileaks.org website, which had been offering no content since 30 September 2010. The BBC quoted The Pentagon referring to the Iraq War Logs as \\"the largest leak of classified documents in its history.\\" Media coverage of the leaked documents focused on claims that the U.S. government had ignored reports of torture by the Iraqi authorities after the 2003 war. State Department diplomatic cables release On 22 November 2010 an announcement was made by the WikiLeaks Twitter feed that the next release would be \\"7x the size of the Iraq War Logs.\\" U.S. authorities and the media speculated that they contained diplomatic cables. Prior to the expected leak, the government of the United Kingdom (UK) sent a DA-Notice to UK newspapers, which requests advance notice from the newspapers regarding the expected publication. According to Index on Censorship, \\"there is no obligation on media to comply\\". \\"Newspaper editors would speak to [the] Defence, Press and Broadcasting Advisory Committee prior to publication.\\" The Pakistani newspaper Dawn stated that the U.S. newspapers The New York Times and The Washington Post were expected to publish parts of the diplomatic cables on Sunday 28 November, including 94 Pakistan-related documents. On 26 November, via his lawyer Jennifer Robinson, Assange sent a letter to the US Department of State, asking for information regarding people who could be placed at \\"significant risk of harm\\" by the diplomatic cables release. Harold Koh, Legal Adviser of the Department of State, refused the proposal, stating, \\"We will not engage in a negotiation regarding the further release or dissemination of illegally obtained U.S. Government classified materials.\\" On 28 November, WikiLeaks announced it was undergoing a massive distributed denial-of-service attack, but vowed to still leak the cables and documents via prominent media outlets including El País, Le Monde, Der Spiegel, The Guardian, and The New York Times. The announcement was shortly thereafter followed by the online publication, by The Guardian, of some of the purported diplomatic cables, including one in which United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton apparently orders diplomats to obtain credit card and frequent flier numbers of the French, British, Russian and Chinese delegations to the United Nations Security Council. Other revelations reportedly include that several Arab nations urged the U.S. to launch a first strike on Iran, that the Chinese government was directly involved in computer hacking, and that the U.S. is pressuring Pakistan to turn over nuclear material to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands. The cables also include unflattering appraisals of world leaders. In December 2010, Der Spiegel reported that one of the cables showed that the US had placed pressure on Germany not to pursue the 13 suspected CIA agents involved in the 2003 abduction of Khalid El-Masri, a German citizen. The abduction was probably carried out through \\"extraordinary rendition\\". German prosecutors in Munich had issued arrest warrants for the 13 suspected CIA operatives involved in the abduction. The cables released by Wikileaks showed that after contact from the then-Deputy US Ambassador John M. Koenig and US diplomats the Munich public prosecutor's office and Germany's Justice Ministry and Foreign Ministry all cooperated with the US and the agents were not extradited to Germany. Despite the steps taken by United States Government forbidding all unauthorized federal government employees and contractors from accessing classified documents publicly available on WikiLeaks, in the week following the release (28 November – 5 December 2010), \\"Wikileaks\\" remained the top search term in United States as measured by Google Insights. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton responded to the leaks saying, \\"This disclosure is not just an attack on America's foreign policy; it is an attack on the international community, the alliances and partnerships, the conventions and negotiations that safeguard global security and advance economic prosperity.\\" Julian Assange is quoted as saying, \\"Of course, abusive, Titanic organizations, when exposed, grasp at all sorts of ridiculous straws to try and distract the public from the true nature of the abuse.\\" John Perry Barlow, co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, wrote a tweet saying: \\"The first serious infowar is now engaged. The field of battle is WikiLeaks. You are the troops.\\"By Satter, Raphael G.; Svensson, Peter (3 December 2010) WikiLeaks fights to stay online amid attacks, an Associated Press report syndicated by The Washington Post  2011   Guantanamo Bay files  On 24 April 2011 WikiLeaks began a month-long release of 779 US Department of Defense documents about detainees at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp.

It was said to show how a private intelligence agency operates and how it targets individuals for their corporate and government clients. A few days before, on 22 February, WikiLeaks had released its second insurance file via BitTorrent. The file is named \\"wikileaks-insurance-20120222.tar.bz2.aes\\" and about 65 GB in size.  Syria Files  On 5 July 2012, WikiLeaks began publishing the Syria Files, more than two million emails from Syrian political figures, ministries and associated companies, dating from August 2006 to March 2012. 2013 PlusD In April 2013, WikiLeaks releases 1.7 million U.S. diplomatic and intelligence reports including Kissinger cables.

Draft Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement IP Charter Draft text for the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement Intellectual Property charter. 2014  Trade in Services Agreement chapter draft  WikiLeaks published a secret draft of the Financial Services Annex of the Trade in Services Agreement in June 2014. On its website, the organization provided an analysis of the leaked document. TISA, an international trade deal aimed at market liberalization, covers 50 countries and 68% of the global services industry. The agreement's negotiations have been criticized for a lack of transparency.  Australian bribery case suppression order  On 29 July 2014, WikiLeaks released a secret gagging order issued by the Supreme Court of Victoria that forbid the Australian press from coverage of a multimillion-dollar bribery investigation involving the nation's central bank and several international leaders. Indonesian, Vietnamese, Malaysian and Australian government officials were named in the order, which was suppressed to \\"prevent damage to Australia's international relations that may be caused by the publication of material that may damage the reputations of specified individuals who are not the subject of charges in these proceedings.\\" Public criticism of the suppression order followed the leak. Human Rights Watch General Counsel Dinah PoKempner, said \\"Secret law is often unaccountable and inadequately justified. The government has some explaining to do as to why it sought such an extraordinary order, and the court should reconsider the need for it now that its action has come to light.\\" At a media conference, Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono condemned the gagging order, calling for an open and transparent investigation. 2015 TPP Investment Chapter On 25 March 2015 WikiLeaks released the \\"Investment Chapter\\" from the secret negotiations of the TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership) agreement. Sony archives On 16 April 2015, WikiLeaks published a searchable version of the Sony Archives which were originally obtained in November 2014 by hacker group \\"Guardians of Peace\\". The leaked records contained 30,287 documents from Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) and 173,132 emails between more than 2,200 SPE email addresses. SPE is a US subsidiary of the Japanese multinational technology and media corporation Sony, that handles film and TV production and distribution operations. Containing published communications between SPE and over 100 US government email addresses, the archives revealed that the influential corporation has direct ties to the White House and the US military-industrial complex, allowing opportunities to influence laws and policies. WikiLeaks editor-in- chief Julian Assange said: \\"This archive shows the inner workings of an influential multinational corporation. It is newsworthy and at the centre of a geo-political conflict. It belongs in the public domain. WikiLeaks will ensure it stays there.\\" Trident Nuclear Weapons System Whistle blower, Royal Navy Able Seaman William McNeilly exposed serious security issues relate to the UK's nuclear weapons system. The Saudi Cables In June 2015 Wikileaks began publishing confidential and secret Saudi Arabian government documents. Julian Assange said that \\"The Saudi Cables lift the lid on a increasingly erratic and secretive dictatorship that has not only celebrated its 100th beheading this year, but which has also become a menace to its neighbours and itself\\". Cables from early 2013 indicate that the British government under David Cameron may have traded votes with Saudi Arabia to support each other's election to the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) for the period 2014–2016. Both Britain and Saudi Arabia joined the UNHRC in the election held in 2013. UN Watch expressed concern at the report saying that UNHRC must be chosen based on upholding the highest standards of human rights.  2016   DNC email leak  On 22 July 2016, WikiLeaks released nearly 20,000 e-mails and over 8,000 attachments from the Democratic National Committee (DNC), the governing body of the U.S. Democratic Party. The leak includes emails from seven key DNC staff members, and date from January 2015 to May 2016. The collection of emails allegedly disclose the bias of key DNC staffers against the presidential campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders in favor of Hillary Clinton's campaign. WikiLeaks did not reveal their source.  Podesta emails  On 7 October 2016, WikiLeaks started releasing emails from John Podesta, the chairman of Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. The emails provide some insight to the inner workings of Clinton's campaign. One of the emails contained 25 excerpts from Clinton's paid Wall Street speeches. Another leaked document included eighty pages of Clinton's Wall Street speeches. Also among these emails was an email from Donna Brazile to Podesta that suggested that Brazile had received a town hall debate question in advance and was sharing it with Clinton. One of the emails released on 12 October 2016 included Podesta's iCloud account password. His iCloud account was reportedly hacked, and his Twitter account was briefly compromised. Some emails from revealed emails that Barack Obama and Podesta exchanged in 2008. The Clinton campaign has declined to authenticate these leaks. Glen Caplin, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, said, \\"By dribbling these out every day WikiLeaks is proving they are nothing but a propaganda arm of the Kremlin with a political agenda doing [Vladimir] Putin's dirty work to help elect Donald Trump.\\" The New York Times reported that when asked, president Vladimir Putin replied that Russia was being falsely accused. Julian Assange has also denied that Russia is the source. Yemen files On 25 November 2016, WikiLeaks released emails and internal documents that provided details on the US military operations in Yemen from 2009 to March 2015. In a statement accompanying the release of the \\"Yemen Files\\", Assange said about the US involvement in the Yemen war: \\"The war in Yemen has produced 3.15 million internally displaced persons. Although the United States government has provided most of the bombs and is deeply involved in the conduct of the war itself reportage on the war in English is conspicuously rare\\". PlusD On 28 November 2016, WikiLeaks released more than 500,000 diplomatic cables sent by the United States Department of State in 1979 during the presidency of Jimmy Carter. German BND-NSA Inquiry On 1 December 2016, WikiLeaks released 2,420 documents which it claims are from the German Parliamentary Committee investigating the NSA spying scandal. German security officials at first suspected the documents were obtained from a 2015 cyberattack on the Bundestag, but now suspect it was an internal leak. Turkish AK Party emails  Turkey blocked access to WikiLeaks after the website released emails from Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party, or AKP, in response to Erdoğan’s post-coup purges against political dissent.  2017   CIA espionage orders  On 16 February 2017, WikiLeaks released a purported report on CIA espionage orders (marked as NOFORN) for the 2012 French presidential election. The order called for details of party funding, internal rivalries and future attitudes toward the United States. The Associated Press noted that \\"the orders seemed to represent standard intelligence-gathering.\\"  Vault 7  In March 2017, WikiLeaks has published more than 8,000 documents on the CIA. The confidential documents, codenamed Vault 7, dated from 2013–2016, included details on the CIA's software capabilities, such as the ability to compromise cars, smart TVs, web browsers (including Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox, and Opera), and the operating systems of most smartphones (including Apple's iOS and Google's Android), as well as other operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux. WikiLeaks did not name the source, but said that the files had \\"circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive.\\"  Spy Files Russia  In September 2017, WikiLeaks released \\"Spy Files Russia,\\" revealing \\"how a Saint Petersburg-based technology company called Peter-Service helped state entities gather detailed data on Russian mobile phone users, part of a national system of online surveillance called System for Operative Investigative Activities (SORM).\\"  2018   ICE Patrol  On 22 June 2018, Wikileaks published documents containing the personal details of many U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) employees with the declared aim of \\"understanding ICE programs and increasing accountability, especially in light of the extreme actions taken by ICE lately, such as the separation of children and parents at the US border\\". Allegation of a corrupted broker in France-UAE arms deal On 28 September 2018, WikiLeaks published information related to a dispute over a commission payment for an arms deal between a French state-owned company GIAT Industries SA (now Nexter Systems) and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The deal, which was signed in 1993 and was due for completion in 2008, involved the sale by Nexter to the UAE of 46 armoured vehicles, 388 Leclerc combat tanks, 2 training tanks, spare parts and ammunition. The dispute was brought to the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) by Abbas Ibrahim Yousef Al Yousef, who acted as broker between the UAE and Nexter Systems. Yousef claimed that he was paid $40 million less than the $235 million he was promised by Nexter. Nexter justified stopping payments by saying that Yousef's company, Kenoza Consulting and Management, Inc., registered in the British Virgin Islands, had committed corrupt acts by, among other things, using German engines in its tanks, which violated laws forbidding arms sales from Germany to the Middle East. Yousef claimed he had obtained a waiver from those laws using lobby groups to contact \\"decision makers at the highest levels, both in France and Germany\\". Yousef's claims against Nexter Systems were dismissed when it became known that his charge from the deal would have been much less had he been paid on retainer.  2019   Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons  Between October and December 2019, Wikileaks published four batches of internal documents from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons related to its investigation of the alleged chemical attack in Douma in April 2018.  Complete list  This article only covers a small subset of the leaked documents—those that have attracted significant attention in the mainstream press. Wikileaks has the complete list, organised by country or by year through 2010.  Unpublished material  *In October 2009 Computer World published an interview with Assange in which he claimed to be in possession of \\"5GB from Bank of America\\" that was from \\"one of the executive's hard drives.\\" In November 2010 Forbes magazine published another interview with Assange in which he said WikiLeaks was planning another \\"megaleak\\" for early in 2011, which this time would be from inside the private sector and involve \\"a big U.S. bank\\". Bank of America's stock price fell by three percent following this announcement. Assange commented on the possible impact of the release that \\"it could take down a bank or two.\\" However, WikiLeaks claims that the information is among the documents that former spokesperson Daniel Domscheit-Berg claimed to have destroyed in August 2011. *In March 2010, Daniel Domscheit-Berg, at the time WikiLeaks' spokesperson, announced on a podcast that the organization had in its possession around 37,000 internal e-mails from far-right National Democratic Party of Germany. He stated explicitly that he was not working on this project himself because it would make him legally vulnerable as a German citizen. According to him, Wikileaks was working on a crowd sourcing-based tool to exploit such masses of data. WikiLeaks claimed that these e-mails (which it claimed numbered 60,000) were among the documents that Domscheit- Berg claimed to have destroyed in August 2011. *In May 2010, WikiLeaks said it had video footage of an alleged massacre of Afghan civilians by the U.S. military, which it said it was preparing to release. However, this may have been among the videos that WikiLeaks reported that former spokesperson Domscheit-Berg destroyed in August 2011. *In July 2010 during an interview with Chris Anderson, Assange showed a document WikiLeaks had on an Albanian oil well blowout, and said it also had material from inside BP, and that it was \\"getting [an] enormous quantity of whistle-blower disclosures of a very high caliber\\"Assange TED interview. Event occurs at 13:55 but added that WikiLeaks has not been able to verify and release the material because it does not have enough volunteer journalists. *In a September 2010 Twitter post, WikiLeaks stated that it had a first-edition copy of Operation Dark Heart, a memoir by a U.S. Army intelligence officer. The uncensored first printing of around 9,500 copies was purchased and destroyed by the U.S. Department of Defense in its entirety. *In October 2010, Assange told a leading Moscow newspaper that \\"[t]he Kremlin had better brace itself for a coming wave of WikiLeaks disclosures about Russia.\\" In late November, Assange stated, \\"we have material on many businesses and governments, including in Russia. It's not right to say there's going to be a particular focus on Russia\\". On 23 December 2010, the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta announced that it had been granted access to a wide range of materials from the WikiLeaks database. The newspaper said that it will begin releasing these materials in January 2011, with an eye toward exposing corruption in the Russian government. *In December 2010, Assange's lawyer, Mark Stephens, said on The Andrew Marr Show that WikiLeaks had information that it considers to be a \\"thermo-nuclear device\\" that it would release if the organisation needs to defend itself. *In January 2011, Rudolf Elmer hand delivered two CDs to Assange during a news conference in London. Elmer claimed the CDs contain the names of around 2,000 tax-evading clients of the Swiss bank Julius Baer. *In February 2011 in his memoir, Inside WikiLeaks: My Time with Julian Assange at the World's Most Dangerous Website, Daniel Domscheit-Berg acknowledged that he and another former WikiLeaks volunteer have material submitted to WikiLeaks in their possession (as well as the source code to the site's submission system) and that they would only return to the organization once it repaired its security and online infrastructure. However, in August 2011 Domscheit-Berg announced that he destroyed all 3,500 documents in his possession. The German newspaper Der Spiegel reported that the documents included the U.S. government's No Fly List. WikiLeaks also claimed that the data destroyed by Domscheit-Berg included the No Fly List. This is the first mention of WikiLeaks having had possession of the No Fly List. WikiLeaks also claimed that the data destroyed included information that it had previously announced was its possession but had not released publicly. This information includes \\"five gigabytes from the Bank of America\\" (which was previously reported to be in WikiLeaks' possession in October 2009), \\"60,000 emails from the NPD\\" (which Domscheit-Berg divulged to be in Wikileaks' possession in March 2010, back when he still worked with the organization), and \\"videos of a major US atrocity in Afghanistan\\" (which perhaps include the one it claimed to have in May 2010) Additionally, WikiLeaks claimed that the documents destroyed included \\"the internals of around 20 neo-Nazi organizations\\" and \\"US intercept arrangements for over a hundred internet companies\\". Neither of these two leaks were reported to have been in WikiLeaks' possession before.

It offers an eponymous dedicated device and an iPhone app. It compares a driver's GPS location to its database of speed camera locations. The company is privately owned and run by Chairman Peter Johnson and Managing Director Stephen Wreford. The company has coverage of speed cameras for 28 countries and includes all fixed, average, temporary, variable, red light, speed and mobile camera type categories in its database.  History  In 2001 the eponymous company, Cyclops UK Ltd, become the global distributor and subsequently acquired all the intellectual property rights in the product, software and databases from Trafficmaster plc.® (the UK traffic information company). The Cyclops device was sold in volume by Halfords, Motor World, Peugeot, Citroen, Nissan, Alfa Romeo and Ford as an aftermarket product. In 2003-2004, investments were made by Octopus Ventures, East Midlands Business Angels and Catapult Venture Managers to further fund development. In 2010, Cyclops UK launched a new real- time alert service using the \\"3G/GPRS\\" connectivity of mobile phones and connected personal navigation devices to enable a community of users to share information on the activity of mobile speed camera enforcement. A team of internal researchers added foreseen location information from local official agencies. In the UK, such agencies include the Safer Roads Partnership that manage such programs on behalf of local councils and police forces. The service is currently available as an App on iPhone for the UK.  Technology  Cyclops uses a unique system of digital way-points in its database- creation-process to eliminate non-relevant alerts. Other camera alert systems often use a radius or cone look-up based on a vehicle's heading that can generate false alerts in some instances. The system filters user reports against historic, frequent and clusters of current reported data to derive a \\"risk\\" rating for each report. Only alerts that have an appropriate score are forwarded to users. A similar system is also used by traffic information systems to help predict traffic patterns.  Reception  UK motoring journalist Quentin Willson described the Cyclops Speedwatch system as a \\"must have app\\" in his Sunday Mirror column on 28 November 2011. Leading UK consumer motoring magazine, Auto Express, featured Cyclops Speedwatch as its \\"app of the week\\" in its 24 November 2011 edition. Official agencies such as Thames Valley Safer Roads Partnership have described the Cyclops system as an \\"aid to safer driving on our roads\\".  Partnerships  Cyclops UK is a long standing supplier to Garmin, the largest satellite navigation brand in the world. All Garmin satellite navigation units come pre-loaded with Cyclops content. The databases provided by Cyclops are found in millions of satellite navigation devices and mobile navigation device across the world and the company. The company logo and strap-line \\"powered by Cyclops\\" appear on millions of satellite navigation boxes every year.  Marketing  Since 2001 the company has used the strap-line \\"keeping an eye on the road ahead\\" to represent its focus on helping drivers to drive safely within the speed limit.

He is remembered in particular for the photographs he took of Hans Christian Andersen. Career Born on 12 May 1827, Melchior was educated as a civil engineer. In 1874, he bought the Valdemarshaab paper factory, just north of Køge, for 60,000 kroner after it had been declared bankrupt as a result of a flood in 1872. By 1875, he had completely renovated the plant and in addition had built Søvang, a large, Italian-styled director's residence, adjacent to the factory. However, the factory was totally destroyed by fire in October of the same year and was never rebuilt.\\"En start på Køges industrialisering\\", Køge Archiverne. . Retrieved 9 December 2010.

When he built Søvang, he had the upper floor specially designed to accommodate a large photographic studio with an overhead window as well as a glass wall facing east. In particular, he photographed the annual family gatherings at Rolighed, the family mansion on Østerbro just outside Copenhagen. A number of artists and authors would also take part in the gatherings, the most famous being Hans Christian Andersen who got to know the family in 1862 and was a frequent visitor until he died there in 1875.

It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide, with a center entry and two interior chimneys. The oldest portion of the house is estimated to date to 1710, early in the period of Coventry's settlement, and retains a significant number of period features. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. It is now owned and operated by the Coventry Historical Society as a museum. In addition to exhibits in the house about local history, visitors can tour the carpenter shop, 19th century privy, carriage sheds and barn. Description and history The Strong-Porter Museum is located in southwestern Coventry, on the north side of South Street, on the eastern fringe of Nathan Hale State Forest and just west of the Nathan Hale Homestead, also a museum. The house is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a side gable roof, two interior chimneys, and clapboarded exterior. The main facade is five bays wide, with a slightly off-center arrangement around a nearly-centered entrance. The entrance has a wide panel door framed by a plain surround with back molding. The window placement on either side does not extend the typical width of a house of this age, with wide blank spaces between the outer windows and the building corners. The interior of the house is reflective of its construction history, with the oldest portion east of the entrance. The main parlor on that side has exposed beams, wide paneled wainscoting, and a fireplace cupboard that suggests a chimney stood here that was once much larger. The western parlor shows original woodwork, doors, and hardware suggestive of a later 18th century construction date, c. 1770. The east portion of the house appears to have been built about 1710. The house was later extended to its present width, and the rear leanto was also added later, giving the house a classic saltbox appearance. The Strong house at one time belonged to the grandparents of American Revolutionary War hero Nathan Hale, whose homestead is nearby. Both houses were restored in the 1930s by noted antiquarian George Dudley Seymour, and represent some of Connecticut's earliest efforts at the historic preservation of colonial architecture. Seymour left this house, as well as land making up part of the adjacent state forest, to the state. and The house is now managed by the local historical society as a museum.

Early years He was born in York on 5 October 1846, John Henry Middleton was the only surviving child of John Middleton and Maria Margaret, daughter of James Pigott Pritchett and his first wife, Peggy Maria Terry. As a child he travelled to Italy where he was initially educated. He acquired a love for Italy and its language, which lasted throughout his life. On returning to Britain his parents settled in Cheltenham, where his father practised as an architect and where he attended Cheltenham College. In 1865, he was matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford. The following year, however, he suffered a severe depression accentuated by the sudden death of a close friend at Oxford. This led to him confining himself to his room for six years. During this time, through reading and study he laid the foundations of his extensive knowledge of art and archaeology. Travels On his recovery, Middleton began a series of journeys around the world. He visited the Americas, including Salt Lake City and the Rocky Mountains, and travelled south from there into Mexico. He travelled in Greece, Asia Minor, Egypt and North Africa. He undertook a special journey to Fez in Morocco to study the philosophy of Plato as taught there, while there he secured entrance to the Great Mosque by posing as an Islamic pilgrim. Architect When he returned to Britain he adopted the profession of an architect and apprenticed in the office of Sir George Gilbert Scott, and then as a partner in his father's business at Storey's Gate, Westminster. After his father's death in 1885 he liquidated the firm and began life as a professional archaeologist. Art and archaeology Middleton never ceased to pursue his favourite studies of art and archaeology, and even went through a course in the schools of the Royal Academy. His vast knowledge became well known and brought him many friends including William Morris, with whom Middleton travelled in Iceland. In 1879, he was elected fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, and was a frequent contributor to their publications; in 1894 he was elected as vice-president of the society. He also contributed to the 9th edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica. In 1885, he published his book Ancient Rome, looking at antiquities of Rome, which was followed in 1892 by the Remains of Ancient Rome. From 1886 to 1892, he was Slade professor of fine art at Cambridge. He was given an honorary MA degree at Cambridge in 1886, and in 1887 one from Oxford, followed by a Litt.D. at Cambridge in 1893 and a DCL at Oxford in 1894. He was also honoured with a doctor's degree at the University of Bologna and in 1888 elected a fellow of King's College, Cambridge. Museum director In 1889, Middleton was named Director of the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. As director, he was able to show his knowledge and produced the catalogue Engraved Gems of Classical Times in 1891, Illuminated MSS of Classical and Mediaeval Times in 1892 as well as a catalogue of The Lewis Collection of Gems. Middleton was also appointed as lecturer at the Royal Academy. In 1892, he was appointed Director of the art collections of the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria and Albert Museum), at the time the department was in need of reform and reorganisation. He brought in several necessary reforms, but the difficult work coupled with his lifelong depression and drug addiction, increased his despondency and drug use. He accidentally overdosed on morphia at the age of 49 and died on 10 June 1896. His body was cremated at Woking, and the remains interred at Brookwood cemetery. Family In 1892, he married Bella Stillman, they had one child.

The first school year began in September 2010 using a portion of Melrose's vacant Decius Beebe Elementary School. For the school's second year, it was renamed the Acera School and moved to the First Methodist Church's annex building. History The Acera School was founded in 2010 as the Anova School by Courtney Dickinson, a teacher, corporate executive and consultant. Dickinson was inspired by her own family's challenges in finding appropriate opportunities for gifted students in Massachusetts public schools. After a year as volunteer facilitator to try to launch a gifted education program in public schools, Courtney decided to create a school to serve high ability students who could not develop into their full potential because of too low of a ceiling in regular school programs. In the second year Acera started requiring that children take the WISC-IV assessment test as part of the admissions process. This is a precursor to a parent interview/visit. This along with attending Information Sessions have always been a part of the admissions process. In its first year, Anova opened in Melrose, leasing a portion of the vacant former Decius Beebe Elementary School building from Melrose Public Schools opening in September 2010. For its second year, the school moved to the First Methodist Church's annex building following Melrose Public Schools' decision to lease the Beebe School in its entirety to another program. In fall 2013, the Acera School re- opened for its fourth year in Winchester in its own building at 5 Lowell Avenue. The previous building owner donated back $100,000 towards the school, and this along with a few families' donations made up a down payment for the building's purchase. A mortgage loan was secured from Winchester Cooperative Bank. The school started offering an after-school program in its second year, and its after school enrichment programs are now open to students not enrolled at Acera during the school day. For 2013/2014 school year, Acera had 79 students enrolled in Kindergarten - Grade 8. Students are grouped in small multi-age classroom communities for Lower Elementary, Intermediate Elementary, Upper Elementary and Middle School. Elementary Classrooms are capped at 14 students. Acera hosts the American Mathematics Competition AMC8 Exam each year and has curriculum collaborations with thinkers and scientists in the Boston Area such as Dr. Angela Belcher, Dr. Calum MacRae, Dr. Eric Alm, Dr. Tom Vandervelde, and Dr. Kevin Dunn. Student body In its first year, the Acera School offered three multi-age classrooms serving grades K-6. The school has since expanded to include students from kindergarten through ninth grade. As for the 2016/2017 school year, they had expanded to have a Lower Elementary class, 2 Intermediate Elementary classes, 3 Upper Elementary classes, and 2 Middle School classes. The school serves \\"high-ability learners,\\" including academically gifted/highly successful students, creatively gifted students, highly gifted/profoundly accelerated students, and twice-exceptional students who present both giftedness and disabilities. Curriculum The Acera School curriculum is individualized to each student based on readiness and interests. Subjects such as math and reading are taught in flexible cross-age groupings. Learning is interdisciplinary and project based, with schoolwide themes inspired by the Museum of Science Engineering is Elementary (EiE) program. Destination ImagiNation and FIRST Lego League teams are an optional after- school activity as of 2012.

Introduced by W. Charles Redding in 1972, this theoretical concept serves as a comprehensive model for management, and organizations as a whole, that places emphasis on relationships, interactions, and leadership functions. IMC furthers discussion in organizational communication beyond formal relations and structures, and assesses those characteristics that can produce the most ideal environment in an organization, and/or its management. This model presents an ideal situation rather than an attainable one, and should be a used as a tool for comparison, self-assessment, and improvement for organizations. __TOC__  Theoretical perspective  W. Charles Redding, commonly credited as the father of organizational communication, conducted significant research that made substantial contributions to organizational and managerial communication. Redding was one of the first to investigate the climates of organizations. His quantitative studies examined communicative dynamics among the members of organizations across various structures. Prior to Redding’s contributions, research pertaining to organizational climate was limited specifically to the analysis of events or isolated messages rather than the larger dynamics of the organization. Based on his findings, Redding developed a prescriptive model for managers known as the ideal managerial climate, which connects leadership functions to the organizational communication climate. Redding claimed that any experience in an organizational setting is a message, including both nonverbal and verbal communication. Message and message-related practices are the basic premise by which organizational environments and climates are created. Climate can be defined as “the psychological environment in which organizational behavior occurs.” As this applies to organizational communication, “organizational climate” can be defined as the relationships and interactions that contribute to the formation of workplace environments among and across various organizational structures. Redding states that “the communication ‘climate’ of the organization is more crucial than are communication skills or techniques (taken by themselves) in creating an effective organization.” When evaluating organizational climate using IMC, the ideal productive environment of an organizational is related to the culture and values an organization possesses.  Components of IMC  Based on Redding’s research and consultation experience, he found five dynamics to be key in the attempt to produce a stable, satisfying, and content atmosphere in the workplace. These characteristics were reflective on organizational productivity, preventing workplace conflicts, and positive influence and fluency in organizational structure. # Trust: Trust, confidence, and credibility should be maintained in the relationships between members of the organization at all levels of the hierarchy. # Supportiveness: Personnel should feel free to speak what is on their minds in an atmosphere of acceptance, regardless of their positioning as superior or subordinate. # Openness: The dynamics in an organizational setting should be clear and free of confusion. However, although there may be formal hierarchical structures, communication should be not limited by rigid boundaries. # Emphasis on high-performance goals: All members of an organization should be committed to high-performance goals such as high productivity, high quality, low cost, and a concern for other members. # Participative decision-making: Employees at all levels in the organization should be communicated to and consulted with in decision-making and goal- setting relevant to their positions. # Emotional connections: If employees feel an emotional connection to the work that is facilitated through the manager, work will be done more effectively and the employees will be able to be more productive.  Expansion of IMC  In 1976, Peterson and Pace expanded on the IMC model with the development of the communication climate inventory (CCI). Similar to Redding’s, this model was designed to analyze the communication dynamics of an organizational setting according to six categories of “communication effects.” Peterson and Pace used the five components of IMC as a foundational premise upon which to base their model.

Its events were precipitated when, at an international student peace conference held in Paris on April 20, 1949, Paul Robeson allegedly made a speech to the effect that American blacks would not support the United States in a war with the Soviet Union, due to continued second-class citizen status under United States law. This subsequent controversy caused the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) to investigate RobesonDuberman, p. 358. and Robinson, as a famed African-American baseball player, was called on to impugn Robeson. Robeson's advocacy for socialism Paul Robeson's post World War II persecution by J. Edgar Hoover's FBI and the political right in the U.S. was, in part, due to his vocal support for the Soviet Union, which was a cause célèbre among well-known artists and scientists during the 1930s and 1940s. Robeson had been particularly impressed by the absence of negative racial attitudes towards him during his visits to the Soviet Union. During the Cold War years the United States and the Soviet Union became fierce competitors, as the two emerging superpowers. In the 1950s, McCarthyism and the Red Scare dominated the headlines, and many artists, scientists or academics with leftist affiliations who failed to denounce communism became unemployabled and blacklisted. Robinson was reluctant to testify to HUAC on these matters, in part because of Robeson's prior advocacy on behalf of integration in professional baseball. Among other things, at the annual winter meeting of baseball owners in December 1943, Robeson became the first black man to address baseball owners on the subject of integration. At this meeting, Robeson argued that baseball, as a national game, had an obligation to ensure segregation did not become a national pattern. The owners gave Robeson a round of applause and, after the meeting, Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis remarked that there was no rule on the books denying blacks entry into the league. As such, Robeson had done much to pave the way for Jackie Robinson's entry into major league baseball, just over three years later. Statement to The House Committee on Un-American Activities According to Jackie Robinson, in 1949 he struggled with his decision to testify against Robeson to HUAC. Technically, Robinson was not required to testify, but he believed there would be repercussions if he did not. In July 1949, Robinson eventually agreed to testify before HUAC, fearing that declining to do so might negatively and permanently damage not only his career but also the future integration of professional athletics.Duberman, pp. 361-62. His testimony was a major media event, with Robinson's carefully worded statement appearing on the front page of The New York Times the following day. In the statement - prepared with the help of Branch Rickey, who in order to facilitate the testimony, released Robinson from a prior agreement not to make any political statements during his baseball career - Robinson said that Robeson \\"has a right to his personal views, and if he wants to sound silly when he expresses them in public, that is his business and not mine . . . . He's still a famous ex-athlete and a great singer and actor.\\" Robinson also stated that \\"the fact that it is a Communist who denounces injustice in the courts, police brutality, and lynching when it happens doesn't change the truth of his charges,\\" and that racial discrimination is not \\"a creation of Communist imagination.\\"Duberman, p. 361. Robinson left the capital immediately after his testimony to avoid, as the black newspaper New Age pointed out, \\"being Jim Crowed by Washington's infamous lily-white hotels.\\"Duberman, p. 360. Aftermath In general, Robinson's testimony placated Americans worried about the threat of Communism, and reaction in the mainstream press was positive, including an article by Eleanor Roosevelt in which she wrote, \\"Mr. Robeson does his people great harm in trying to line them up on the Communist side of political picture. Jackie Robinson helped them greatly by his forthright statements.\\" Reaction in the black press was mixed. The New York Amsterdam News was supportive, saying that \\"Jackie Robinson had batted 1,000 percent in this game,\\" but the black newspaper Afro-American ran a disparaging cartoon depicting Jackie Robinson as a frightened little boy with a gun vainly attempting to \\"hunt\\" Robeson. Much later, in 1963, after Robinson expressed disagreement with the political positions of the Nation of Islam, then-Nation of Islam minister Malcolm X commented harshly on Robinson's testimony concerning Robeson, citing the testimony as an example of Robinson's submissiveness to the white establishment.Duberman, p. 527. Nearly forty five years later, in the 1998 British Robeson documentary Speak of Me As I Am, Oscar Peterson Jr. recalled the Robinson-Robeson incident, stating \\"that it was very hurtful to see Jackie Robinson be made to attack Paul Robeson whom many of us loved so dearly.\\"\\"Speak of Me As I Am\\" Paul Robeson: Speak of Me As I Am (1998) BBC/New Jersey Public Television, interview with Oscar Peterson, Jr. Robinson and Robeson respond While Robeson considered Robinson's testimony a \\"disservice\\" to the black community, he declined to comment on Robinson personally: \\"I am not going to permit the issue to boil down to a personal feud between me and Jackie. To do that, would be to do exactly what the other group wants us to do.\\" Jackie Robinson appreciated Robeson's restraint, and eventually grew to have greater admiration for Robeson. Near the end of his life, Robinson wrote in his autobiography about the incident: > However, in those days I had much more faith in the ultimate justice of the > American white man than I have today. I would reject such an invitation if > offered now . . . . I have grown wiser and closer to the painful truths > about America's destructiveness. And I do have increased respect for Paul > Robeson who, over the span of twenty years, sacrificed himself, his career, > and the wealth and comfort he once enjoyed because, I believe, he was > sincerely trying to help his people. Paul Robeson's 1956 HUAC testimony In June 1956, Robeson was called before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) after he refused to sign an affidavit affirming that he was not a Communist. In response to questions concerning his alleged Communist Party membership, Robeson reminded the Committee that the Communist Party was a legal party and invited its members to join him in the voting booth before he invoked the Fifth Amendment and refused to respond. Robeson lambasted Committee members on civil rights issues concerning African-Americans. When one senator asked him why he hadn't remained in the Soviet Union, he replied, > Because my father was a slave, and my people died to build this country, and > I am going to stay here, and have a part of it just like you. And no > Fascist-minded people will drive me from it. Is that clear? I am for peace > with the Soviet Union, and I am for peace with China, and I am not for peace > or friendship with the Fascist Franco, and I am not for peace with Fascist > Nazi Germans. I am for peace with decent people. When asked about Stalin's purges he stated that, \\"I have told you, mister, that I would not discuss anything with the people who have murdered sixty million of my people, and I will not discuss Stalin with you.\\" And \\"I will discuss Stalin when I may be among the Russian people some day, singing for them, I will discuss it there. It is their problem.\\" Asked if he had praised Stalin during his previous trip to the Soviet Union, Robeson replied, \\"I do not know.\\" When asked outright if he had changed his mind about Stalin he implored, > Whatever has happened to Stalin, gentlemen, is a question for the Soviet > Union, and I would not argue with a representative of the people who, in > building America, wasted sixty to a hundred million lives of my people, > black people drawn from Africa on the plantations.

Of south Welsh origins, as a Doctor of both laws in the University of Oxford he rose swiftly to become Dean of the Arches and Archdeacon of London and of Brecon, and later of Huntingdon. He became an important figure in the operations of Thomas Cromwell, was a witness to Thomas Cranmer's private protestation on becoming Archbishop of Canterbury, and was Cranmer's Commissary and legal draftsman. He was an advocate on behalf of Katherine of Aragon in the proceedings against her, and helped to deliver the decree of annulment against Anne of Cleves.G.

A royal chaplain, he helped to arrange a peace treaty with Scotland, and steered the revision of the Canon Law and other textual reforms. An instrument of policy rather than a prime mover, he helped to implement major reforms including the King's Supremacy, took the surrender of some larger monasteries in the western English borders, and was Prolocutor of the lower house in three important Ecclesiastical Convocations of the period. He was also involved in the identification and interrogation of heretics. His long association with Cranmer brought him closely into the process of Reform, but in his duty of service to various masters his personal religious sympathies are not fully apparent.G.

Presented to the Canterbury living of Tangmere, Sussex in April 1528, he is thought to have entered the service of Cardinal Wolsey, thereby becoming known to Thomas Cromwell.Williams, \\"Two neglected London- Welsh clerics\\", pp. 33–34.

He was admitted to the prebend of Pipa Parva in the church of Lichfield in October 1531, but exchanged it for that of Longdon (a Lichfield peculiar) in the following December. During 1532 his name arises in Cromwell's correspondence, and he became prominent among the royal advisors.J.

This decisive turn in Gwent's career came with the death of Archbishop William Warham of Canterbury, who had held the see since 1504. The vacancy required a principal official who could be depended upon while the successor was chosen, and (although the office was usually in the Archbishop's gift) Cromwell seized the opportunity to appoint Dr Gwent as Dean of the Arches and Master of the Prerogative in the Consistory court of the Province of Canterbury in September 1532.Letters and Papers, Henry VIII, Vol. 5: 1531–1532, p. 574, no. 1326 (British History Online). Among his first duties as Doctor of the Decretals was to hear the oaths of the Duke of Norfolk, Sir Andrew Windsor, John Cockes (archbishop's Chancellor) and others, executors in the probate of Archbishop Warham.Will and Codicil of William Warham, Archbishop of Canterbury (P.C.C. 1532, Thower quire).

Cranmer, having received papal preconization, at his consecration was to make his formal statement of obedience to the pope at Westminster. Before doing so, and foreseeing what services would be expected from him, with the king's approval he summoned John Tregonwell, Thomas Bedyll, John Cockes and Richard Gwent to St Stephen's Chapel at Westminster to witness his private protestation that he would not bind himself to anything contrary to the law of God, or prejudicial to the king's rights, or to anything which might prevent necessary reforms in the Church of England. The King's prothonotary Richard Watkins drew up a legal instrument to this effect which they attested, but which was not recited publicly at the consecration.N. P.

In a certain case of the 1530s the Wardens of the Bridge Works in the City of London complained in Chancery that Gwent, as advocate, had formerly acted on behalf of Stratford Langthorne Abbey to demand tithes for a mill in West Ham which were traditionally payable to the Wardens. Their complaint was that as a judge, now Dean of the Arches, he proposed to affirm a judgement for the abbot in the same matter: they sought not only relief from the abbot's claim but also a writ of prohibition against Gwent proceeding in it.The National Archives (UK), Crull v Abbot of Stratford, ref.

Ayris and D. Selwyn, Thomas Cranmer: Churchman and Scholar (Boydell Press, Woodbridge 1993), p. 122 (Google), citing Lambeth Palace Library, Carte Antique et Miscellanee, vol. XII, no. 56. Soon afterwards he was in Lichfield to oversee the consecration of Rowland Lee as bishop according to the true precedents.Letters and Papers, Henry VIII, Vol. 6: 1533, p. 642, no. 1579 (British History Online). In relation to his Lichfield prebend he was instituted to Bebington (Cheshire) in 1531 (holding until 1543, perhaps leased to David Pole);D. H.

Supremacy and the Canon law  At the end of March 1534 the Convocation of Canterbury voted to abjure the supremacy of the Bishop of Rome. In readiness for this action, and in anticipation of the Act of Supremacy, a commission of 32 senior persons, 16 from the upper and lower houses of parliament and 16 clergy, was enacted to ensure that none of the canons, constitutions and ordinances of the English Church were prejudicial to the prerogative royal or repugnant to the laws of the realm, and to abolish or to reform the existing canon law as necessary, subject to the legislative authority of the King. A working committee of clerical lawyers was set to work. Gwent's name appears in a list among Cromwell's remembrances which may relate to this:Letters and Papers, Henry VIII, Vol. 6: 1533, p. 68, no. 150 (British History Online). after the middle of July he became its chairman, and continued to conduct its affairs through 1535.F.D.

(British Library MS Add. 48040, ff. 13–104v). During the spring of 1534 Gwent was involved directly with Lord Chancellor Thomas Audley, Thomas Cromwell, Edward Foxe and John Tregonwell, concluding a peace treaty with the commissioners of James V of Scotland.J. Gairdner (ed.), Letters and Papers, Foreign and Domestic, Henry VIII, Vol. 7: 1534 (HMSO, London 1883), p. 249, no. 647 and p. 403, no. 1032 (British History Online). In April 1534 he exchanged his London rectoriate of St Leonard, Foster Lane for that of St Peter, Westcheap, vacant by the elevation of Thomas Goodrich to the bishopric of Ely.Newcourt, Repertorium, I, pp. 520–22. (The parish was close to St Mary-le-Bow, in or above the crypt of which the Arches Court was held.D. J. Keene and V.

In May he added the prebend of Leighton Ecclesia in the Diocese of Lincoln to his portfolio.For which see 'Prebendaries: Leighton Ecclesia', in D.E. Greenway (ed.), Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066–1300, Volume 3: Lincoln (London, 1977), pp. 79–81 (British History Online). In August 1534 he commenced a visitation of the Cathedral church of Lincoln, but upon receiving their protestation, prorogued this until December.Letters and Papers, Henry VIII, Vol. 7: 1534, pp. 407–08, no. 1044 (British History Online). In September he visited Merton College, Oxford and changed many of the ancient customs of that house.A. à Wood, ed. J. Gutch, The History and Antiquities of the Colleges and University of Oxford, 4 vols in 3 (1792–1796), II, part 1 (The Annals), pp. 63–4 (Hathi Trust).  Archdeacon of London and Brecon  The Act of Supremacy being passed in November 1534, Gwent was appointed Archdeacon of London on 19 December,'Archdeacons: London', in J. M. Horn (ed.), Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1541–1857, Vol. 1: St. Paul's, London (London, 1969), pp. 7–9 (British History Online). and simultaneously became Archdeacon of Brecon (Diocese of St David's) in the place of Richard Fetherston, who was arrested and imprisoned for refusing to accept the terms of the Act.E.H. Shagan, 'Fetherston, Richard (d. 1540)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (2004). In relation to Brecon he held the prebends of Llanfaes, Lloghas and Llanddew, with their annexed chapels, and was prebendary of Aberarth under the collegiate church of Llandewi Brefi,J. Caley (ed.), Valor Ecclesiasticus Temp. Henry VIII, IV (Commissioners, 1821), p. 397 and p. 401 (Google). and of Cayre (Caerau) in the church of Llandaff.F. Green and T.W. Barker, Pembrokeshire Parsons (contd.), Annual Magazine of the Historical Society of West Wales, V (1915), pp. 134–38, and pp. 179–81 (Internet Archive). Plans to enforce the oath upon the monastic orders were developed while, in May 1535, Cranmer conducted his Metropolitan visitation. In a long consultation with Dr Richard Layton, Gwent expressed the opinion \\"that it was not fit to make any Visitation in the King's name yet, for two or three years, till his Supremacy were better received; and that he apprehended that a severe Visitation so early would make the clergy more averse to the King's power.\\" Layton, however, advocated the opposite view to Cromwell.G. Burnet, The Historie of the Reformation of the Church of England, 2nd, corrected edition (Richard Chiswell, London 1681), I, pp. 182–83 (Internet Archive). The great visitation in the King's name commenced in October. Cromwell deposed that Gwent's licence to hear and conclude cases in the Archbishop's court, including matters of probate and matrimony, should subsist under the King's authority.J. Gairdner (ed.), Letters and Papers, Foreign and Domestic, Henry VIII, Vol. 9: August–December 1535 (HMSO, London 1886), p. 370, no. 1071 (British History Online). Receiving Cranmer's mandate, Gwent introduced this formula (with the royal clause) for a definitive Sentence upon probate: > ...per nos Ricardum Gwent Archi'm London ad infrascripta auctoritate > Illustrissimi et Invictissimi in xpo principis et d'ni n'ri D'ni Henrici > octavi dei gra' Anglie et ffrancie Regis fidei defensoris D'ni Hibern' et in > terris supremi ecclie Anglicane sub xpo capitis, ... > (...by us Richard Gwent, Archdeacon of London, under the below-written > authority of the most Illustrious and Victorious-in-Christ, our prince and > lord the Lord Henry the eighth, by the grace of god King of England and > France, defender of the faith, Lord of Ireland, and on earth the supreme > head of the English church under Christ, ...)Mandate of Cranmer to Gwent, 12 > October 1535, and Sentence in the will of Richard Codworth 10 December 1535 > (P.C.C. 1535, Hogen quire, m/film images 403, 404, stamp numbers 199, 200). His name appears in various judgments of marital affairs:J. E. Cox (ed.), Miscellaneous Writings and Letters of Thomas Cranmer, (The Works of Thomas Cranmer, Vol. II), Parker Society (C.U.P., 1846), pp. 250–51, 253–54, 256, 261, 275. he decreed the divorce of Sir Thomas Pope from Elizabeth Gunston in 1536.T. Warton, The Life of Sir Thomas Pope, Founder of Trinity College, Oxford, 2nd, Corrected and Enlarged edition (Thomas Cadell, London 1780), p. 184 (Google).  Convocation of 1536  Although Gwent was not directly active in the closure of the smaller monasteries, in his tour of the Chichester diocese in 1535 he had written to Cromwell deploring the houses where there were only three or four inmates, often unable to read Latin, and urged that they should be brought together in larger groups where they could be properly instructed and go about their duties.Letters and Papers, Henry VIII, Vol. 9: August–December 1535, p. 7, no. 25 (British History Online). Three weeks after the execution of Anne Boleyn and the King's marriage to Jane Seymour, in the Convocation of 1536 (over which Cromwell, the lay Vicegerent, presided through Dr Petre as his proctor),A list of the members of both houses is given by M.A. Tierney (ed.), Dodd's Church History of England from the commencement of the sixteenth century to the revolution in 1688 (Charles Dolman, London 1839), I, pp. 434–35 (Internet Archive). Dr Latimer delivered two sermons severely critical of the false stewardship of the Roman church.G. E. Corrie, Sermons by Hugh Latimer, Sometime Bishop of Worcester, Parker Society, 2 vols (Cambridge University Press, 1844), I, pp. 33–40, 41–58 (Hathi Trust). Dr Gwent, much against his will,J. Gairdner (ed.), Letters and Papers, Foreign and Domestic, Henry VIII, Vol. 10: January–June 1536 (HMSO, London 1887), p. 421, no. 1018 (British History Online). had been elected Prolocutor of the lower house of the convention. It therefore fell to him, on 23 June, to submit the contrary view of the clergy, listing 67 \\"false dogmas\\" (mala dogmata) or popular blasphemies or heresies against the validity of the sacrament, the holy water, the setting of candles before statues of the saints, and the like, showing that canon reforms were needed to defeat the popular contempt.D.

From this time, though not employed in suppression, Gwent was mediating appeals from the monasteries and payments or gifts to Cromwell (notably from Godstow Abbey, Battle Abbey, the prior of Ely, Evesham Abbey, and St Augustine's Abbey, Bristol) as the movements against them became apparent.'Cromwell's Accounts, 1537, in J.

In May 1537, with Thomas Bedyll, Archdeacon of Cornwall, he renewed the pressure upon the monks of the London Charterhouse to accept the Supremacy, with the result that some acceded and the remainder were consigned to the Newgate with fatal consequences.J. Gairdner, Lollardy and the Reformation in England: An Historical Survey (Cambridge University Press, 1908/2010), II, pp. 36–37 (Google).J.

Meanwhile, he was drawn into disputes in the St David's diocese surrounding the bishop, William Barlow (a strongly reformist representative of Cromwell's policy) and his Chapter, who were of more conservative views. Gwent found himself mediating between them, and conveying gifts and appeals to Cromwell on behalf of the canons at critical moments in their disputes.G. Williams, 'The Protestant Experiment in the Diocese of St David's', Bulletin of the Board of Celtic Studies XV (1953), pp. 212–224. As at Convocation, these circumstances placed him in an unfavourable position towards the Secretary.Williams, \\"Two neglected London-Welsh clerics\\", pp. 37–38.  Heretics  In May 1538, when friar John Forrest (formerly confessor to Catherine of Aragon), having denied the King's supremacy, refused to perform his penance at Paul's Cross, Gwent entreated him to do so, and \\"opened unto him the indignation of God and dampnation of his bodie and soule perpetuallie, and also have a temporall death by brenning as all heretickes should have by the lawes of this realme.\\" It was to no avail.W. D. Hamilton (ed.), A Chronicle of England During the Reigns of the Tudors, by Charles Wriothesley, Camden Society New Series XI (London 1875), I, pp. 78–80 (Internet Archive). In the difficult case of William Cowbridge of Colchester, whose grievances and unorthodox teachings led to his imprisonment and were taken for a sign of madness, Gwent, in agreement with his colleagues, affirmed to John Longland that it would be lawful for the man to bear a faggot (as a sign of heresyThe punishment of \\"carrying a faggot\\" was offered to those who recanted their heresy, as an alternative to being burned for heresy for those who did not recant. O.E.D. (2).) as a penance:J.

S. Freeman and S. Royal, \\"Stranger than fiction in the archives: The controversial death of William Cowbridge in 1538\\", British Catholic History, 32 issue 4 (Cambridge University Press, October 2015), pp. 451–72. In October Gwent was associated in Cromwell's commission to search for Anabaptists, with a view to eliminating the sect.J. Gairdner, Letters and Papers, Foreign and Domestic, Henry VIII, Vol. 13 Part 2: August–December 1538 (HMSO, London 1893), p. 195, no. 498 (British History Online). In May 1539, the king signifying to parliament his demand for religious uniformity, the Duke of Norfolk presented a form of the Six Articles (an affirmation of traditional teachings) to the Lords, which (after debate and revision) Cromwell proposed to the lower house of Convocation on 2 June. Gwent, with the rest, voted acceptance of the decision of the king and bishops, and parliament passed the Articles into law in the same month. In accordance with its terms, the heresies of the Anabaptists and Sacramentarians were pursued by Cranmer in Calais in 1539, and Gwent was present at the inquisition of Ralph Hare,J. Gairdner and R. H. Brodie (eds), Letters and Papers, Foreign and Domestic, Henry VIII, Vol. 14 Part 1: January–July 1539 (HMSO, London 1894), pp. 542–43, nos. 1209–1210 (British History Online). where he reproved Thomas Broke for his theological interventions on Hare's behalf.Foxe, The Acts and Monuments (1563 edition), Book 3, pp. 714–18 (Acts and Monuments Online). So they were constrained to do, but the intentions of Cromwell and Cranmer towards deeper tolerance for reform intensified the political hostility of Bishop Gardiner and the Duke of Norfolk towards them.Williams, \\"Two neglected London-Welsh clerics\\", pp. 39–40.  Commissioners of the West  Following the Second Suppression Act, of 1539, Dr Gwent was attached to the commission to receive surrender of the larger monasteries in the western border counties, together with Robert Southwell, John London, John ap Rhys, Edward Carne and others. He first received the surrender of Godstow Abbey from his former patron, abbess Kateryn Bulkeley, to whom he assigned a pension,Warton, Life of Sir Thomas Pope, p. 371 (Google). but who felt herself ill-used by Dr London.'Letters CXI, CXII', in T. Wright (ed.), Three Chapters of Letters Relating to the Suppression of Monasteries, Camden Society XXVI (London 1843), pp. 227–231 (Internet Archive) On 4 January 1540 the commissioners reported to Cromwell that they had \\"dispacchyd\\" Hailes Abbey (24 December) and Winchcombe Abbey (29 December), and were now at Gloucester Abbey,'Letter CXVI', in Wright, Three Chapters of Letters, pp. 236–38 (Internet Archive). where Abbot William Malverne refused to make the surrender and was accordingly omitted from the list of pensions.W. H. Hart (ed.), Historia Et Cartularium Monasterii Sancti Petri Gloucestriae (Cambridge University Press, 1867/2012), III, Introduction, pp. liii–liv (Google). From Tewkesbury Abbey they proceeded into Worcestershire, where pensions were assigned at Great Malvern Priory (12 January), Worcester Abbey (18 January),J. Gairdner and R. H. Brodie (eds), Letters and Papers, Foreign and Domestic, Henry VIII, Vol. 15: 1540 (HMSO, London 1896), pp. 19–20, nos. 49–51; p. 27, no. 81 (British History Online).

At some time Gwent held the rectory of Cleeve, which acquired peculiar status under the Bishop of Worcester.C.R. Elrington, A History of the County of Gloucester, Vol. 8 (London 1968), pp. 2–25, at notes 509-21 (British History Online). Green and Barker, Pembrokeshire Parsons (1915), p. 138.  Convocation of 1540  The king's disappointment in his marriage in January 1540 to Anne of Cleves fatally exposed Cromwell, its architect, to the intrigues of his enemies, and the speedy resolution of an annulment was sought. When the Convocation was reassembled in April 1540, after two sessions Dr Gwent was presented as Prolocutor by Polydore Vergil.Letters and Papers, Henry VIII, Vol. 15: 1540, p. 455, no. 921 (British History Online). On 6 May Cromwell came before them, and a subsidy was granted by the bishops: on 12 May Cromwell was in session, and Gwent addressed him on the payment of the subsidy, which was at the rate of 20 per cent over and above the usual tithes. He, together with Thomas Thirlby, John Incent, Anthony Draycot, David Pole and Thomas Brerewode, was appointed from the lower house to transact and conclude with the Lords.J. Strype, Ecclesiastical Memorials, 7 volumes (Samuel Bagster, London 1816– ), I, pp. 573–81 (Google). The great question of the annulment was then brought forward. On 10 June Cromwell was arrested. In the last week of June there was much discussion of the Queen's case, in which Dr Gwent fell into indiscreet exchanges with Thomas Wakefield. Cranmer, whose own position was suddenly more precarious, called them and others to account, reporting their tactlessness to others of the Privy Council in case he should be implicated personally. The lawyers, who had speculated upon the king's dalliance with Katherine Howard and had mentioned her affinity to Anne Boleyn, faced a very severe carpeting.D. MacCulloch, Thomas Cranmer: A Life (Yale University Press, New Haven and London 1996), p. 271 (Google), citing Bodleian MS Jesus 74, fol. 299. On 7 July Gwent presented to Convocation the king's commission to begin the process of annulment: Stephen Gardiner having expounded the case, the examination and determination of the matter was assigned to a senior committee, of whom Gardiner and Cuthbert Tunstall, Gwent and Thirlby were chosen to hear the witnesses. The judgement was completed and signed on 9 July.Burnet, History of the Reformation, pp. 280–81 (Internet Archive). Wilkins, Concilia, III, pp. 850–55 (Hathi Trust).Letters and Papers, Henry VIII, Vol. 15: 1540, pp. 429–33, nos. 860–61 (British History Online). The King dissolved the Convocation on 28 July, the day of Cromwell's execution.  Convocation of 1542–43  In late January 1540/41 Gwent was appointed to a fresh commission for the seeking-out of heresies in London, led by Edmund Bonner.J. Gairdner and R. H. Brodie (eds), Letters and Papers, Foreign and Domestic, Henry VIII, Vol. 16: 1540–1541 (HMSO, London 1898), p. 236, no. 494 (British History Online). Cranmer had newly confirmed the proctors to the Dean of the Arches when, a year later, in January 1541/42, Gwent resumed his role as prolocutor. This Convocation addressed several important reforms in ten sessions over the following two months. The King signified that he wished them to deliberate upon matters of religion which had lapsed or decayed. They were also to discuss and revise the texts of the English Old and New Testaments, and to look into and reform the canon law statute concerning simony (the selling of benefices). A session on the reform of the wording of Sunday prayer, the Ave Maria and the Ten Commandments was taken over by Gardiner, who wished the clergy to consider the most suitable English equivalents for a great many words occurring in the sacred texts. The Sarum Use was to prevail. A motion that the Universities should approve the revision of texts was opposed.Wilkins, Concilia, III, pp. 860–62 (Hathi Trust). Many of these matters pertained to the revisions of the Great Bible.Strype, Ecclesiastical Memorials, I, pp. 594–95, 601-03. Strype's dates are Old Style. These sessions being concluded (in which Gwent had a prominent role), Bonner's Letter of Admonition to all readers of the Bible, and his injunctions to his clergy, were issued later in the same year.Wilkins, Concilia, III, pp. 863–64, 864–67 (Hathi Trust). In April 1542 Gwent was installed Archdeacon of Huntingdon. The Convocation was resumed in February 1542/43,Wilkins, Concilia, III, p. 863 (Hathi Trust). and on 12 April 1543 Gwent was granted the prebend of Tottenhall in the jurisdiction of St Paul's. A principal outcome of this assembly, presented in that April, was the revision or \\"diligent review\\" of the \\"Bishop's Book\\" (of 1537), also called The Institution of a Christen Man,See C. Lloyd (ed.), Formularies of Faith put forth by Authority during the Reign of Henry VIII, (Clarendon Press, Oxford 1825), at pp. 21–211 (Internet Archive). which was improved as A Necessary Doctrine and Erudition for any Christen Man, also called the \\"King's Book\\".Full text (original page views) at Internet Archive. The various revised sections were passed from the Bishops to Dr Gwent, who read them before the clergy of the lower house and received their comments and approval.Strype, Ecclesiastical Memorials, I, pp. 604–05 (Google). The sessions were wound up at the end of April.Wilkins, Concilia, p. 868 (Hathi Trust). During the spring of 1543 the accusations of heresy against Cranmer arising from the Prebendaries' Plot, led covertly against Cranmer by Gardiner, came to a head.\\"Prebendaries' Plot\\", in J. A. Wagner and S. W. Schmid, Encyclopedia of Tudor England (ABC-CLIO, Santa Barbara/Denver/Oxford 2012), I: A–D, p. 894 (Google). There are few mentions of Gwent among the lengthy records of Cranmer's investigations in Kent,e.g. J. Gairdner and R. H. Brodie, Letters and Papers, Foreign and Domestic, Henry VIII, Vol. 18 Part 2: August–December 1543 (HMSO, London 1902), no. 586 (British History Online). but at one point Edmund Shether, a hostile witness, is said to have remarked that Dr Gwent could be depended upon to assist Cranmer by finding means to render the evidence of other witnesses inadmissible.Gairdner, Lollardy and the Reformation, II, pp. 393–97 (Internet Archive). Gwent continued active in his last months, hearing the case of Fayrfax v. Fayrfax in June 1543.L. Dibdin and C.E.H. Chadwyck Healey (eds), English Church Law and Divorce (John Murray, London 1912), pp. 96–98 (Internet Archive).  Death and legacies  The King granted a special dispensation to Dr Gwent to wear his bonnet in the royal presence, since he had certain infirmities in his head which made it dangerous for it to be uncovered.T. Hearne (ed.), Joannis Lelandi Antiquarii De Rebus Britannicis Collectanea Editio altera (Gul. & Jo. Richardson, London 1770), Vol. I Part II, p. 678 (Google). J. Gairdner and R. H. Brodie (eds), Letters and Papers, Foreign and Domestic, Henry VIII, Vol. 18 Part 1: January–July 1543 (HMSO, London 1901), p. 494, no. 907 (British History Online). This was on 18 July 1543, and on 21 July Gwent, in sickness, made his will. His father and mother, and two married brothers (John and Thomas), were then living. His father and brother John had the farm of premises called \\"Two Meases\\"\\"Meas\\" might be for Welsh \\"Maes\\", i.e. Field. or \\"le Stones\\" in Monmouthshire, \\"and nowe my brother Thomas and his wiffe have the fee simple for him and for his heires for ever, after the deathe of one Watkynne ap Hoell which hathe a state for terme of his lyffe in the saide grounde receyving xlvi.s viij.d yerely of my father and my brother John during the lyffe of the forseyde Watkynne ap Hoell.\\" Holding three archdeaconries, three prebends and six rectories (including Walton in the Wirrall, Newchurch and North Wingfield), Gwent was at pains to explain that he had received little in dilapidations in his various preferments and had little to pass on to his successors. In particular he states having received \\"not a farthing\\" from Richard Fetherston (who had been executed in 1540). He has bestowed all that he had from his predecessors at Walton, Lancs. (where his patron was Sir William Molyneaux) \\"on the Quear there which was veray obscure and darke and nowe I thancke god it is lightsome and faire\\". These affairs were to be dealt with by his executor \\"Maister Powell, Thomas ap Hoell prebendary of Lychfelde\\". Various gifts are made to David Pole.Will of Richard Gwent, Archdeacon of London (P.C.C. 1544, Pynnyng quire). Dr Richard Gwent died at the end of July 1543, and his desire was to be buried in the middle of St Paul's Cathedral, \\"directly before the Sacrament which hanges alway at the highe aulter in Pawles\\". His will was proved in 1544, and at the Convocation on 18 January that year the first action was to appoint John Oliver his successor as prolocutor.Wilkins, Concilia, III, p. 868 (Hathi Trust). As Richardus Ventamus juridicus, Gwent is eulogised for his virtues and learning in John Leland's 'Encomia,' where he remarks that Gwent had powers to resolve the most stubborn problems, and that his advocacy was like bolts of lightning when parties could not agree: > \\"... novit tua sit facundia quanta, > quae vel dura quidem saxa movere solet.\\" > \\"... sunt tua causidico fulmina nota foro: > fulmina cordatos terrentia saepe patronos, > quum partes nequeunt constabilire suas.\\"John Leland, Encomia Illustrium > Virorum, in T. Hearne (ed.), Joannis Lelandi Antiquarii De Rebus Britannicis > Collectanea (Editio altera) 6 vols. (Gul et Jo. Richardson, London 1770), V, > pp. 142–43 (Google). ;Thomas Powell Gwent's executor, Thomas Powell, had been a contemporary of his at All Souls College.Boase, Register of the University of Oxford, I, p. 102 (Internet Archive). He now succeeded him as prebendary of Longdon, and was also presented as prebendary of Wisborough, Chichester diocese, by Thomas Gwent and Richard Hyde.Correspondence of Reginald Pole: A Biographical Companion, p. 418, note 99. Richard Hyde is mentioned in the wills of both Richard and Thomas Gwent. Powell died in 1551: much of his will is concerned with outstanding matters relating to Gwent's probate, and he has kept a book of accounts and inventory relating to it in a coffer at Lichfield. There is still plenty to be done. He gives all his lands in Oxfordshire to Katheryn Bulkeley, late abbess of Godstow, for life. He gives the advowson of Standish \\"to Thomas Gwente, John Gwente and their mother\\", on condition that they do not sell it. David Pole is his executor.Will of Thomas Powell, Prebendary of Lichfield (P.C.C. 1551, Bucke quire). ;Thomas Gwent In 1539 Thomas Gwent, together with his brother Richard Gwent and Thomas Powell, was among the feoffees for the royal physician George Owen (of Godstow) in devolving his manor of Erdyngton in Oxfordshire.'Grants in May 1539', in J.

Before 1548 Thomas Gwent (gentleman) acquired copyhold of Buckland manor (including Burhill) in Gloucestershire, near Evesham, which had been conveyed by Gloucester Abbey in 1535/36 to James and Joan Apparry and their daughters, and by them to Sir Henry Jerningham, later Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard to Queen Mary.Richard Ewer v.

Gwent's mother was buried in Buckland church, and when making his will in July 1557 Thomas asked to be buried beside her. Making gifts to his brother John Gwent and sister-in-law, and to nephews William and Thomas Gwent, he left his estate to his son Richard, still aged under 24, in the care of his widow Anne, entrusting \\"my especiall good lorde Davy Pole\\" to oversee his son's welfare, and making him the gift of a ring.Will of Thomas Gwent, Gentleman of Buckland (P.C.C. 1557, Wrastley quire). Pole, who had been slightly junior to Richard Gwent at All Souls, at his own death in 1568 left money for a University exhibition to Richard Gwent's nephew Richard, and also a ring with \\"RG\\" monogram \\"ioyned togeather\\" which had belonged to his uncle.Will of Doctor David Pole, Bishop of Peterborough (P.C.C. 1568, Babington quire); T.F.

It may also be referred to as an Unincorporated Business Trust or UBO. Delaware statutory trusts are formed as private governing agreements under which either (1) property (real, tangible and intangible) is held, managed, administered, invested and/or operated; or (2) business or professional activities for profit are carried on by one or more trustees for the benefit of the trustor entitled to a beneficial interest in the trust property. DST Investments are offered as replacement property for accredited investors seeking to defer their capital gains taxes through the use of a 1031 tax deferred exchange and as straight cash investments for those wishing to diversify their real estate holdings. The DST property ownership structure allows the smaller investor to own a fractional interest in large, institutional quality and professionally managed commercial property along with other investors, not as limited partners, but as individual owners within a Trust. Each owner receives their percentage share of the cash flow income, tax benefits, and appreciation, if any, of the entire property. DSTs provide the investor the potential for annual appreciation and depreciation (tax shelter), and most have minimum investments as low as $100,000, allowing some investors the benefit of diversification into several properties. The DST ownership option essentially offers the same benefits and risks that an investor would receive as a single large-scale investment property owner, but without the management responsibility. Each DST property asset is managed by professional investment real estate asset managers and property managers. It used to be that only large institutional investors such as life insurance companies, pension funds, real estate investment trusts (REITS), college endowments and foundations were able to invest in these properties. Now as a viable 1031 exchange replacement property option through a DST, individual investors have the ability to invest in a diversified selection of institutional quality, investment property types that they otherwise could not purchase individually. DST Investments are located throughout the United States. Property types may include multifamily apartment communities, office buildings, industrial properties, multi-tenant retail, student housing, assisted living, self-storage facilities, medical office, single tenant retail properties and others . History The concept for business trusts, especially those that involve the holding of property, dates back to 16th century English Common Law. In Delaware, it was not until 1947 that Common Law began recognizing statutory trusts. No legal recognition of statutory trusts existed until the passage of the Delaware Statutory Trust Act (DSTA), 12 Del. C. 3801 et. Seq., in 1988. Under The Act, developed on the premise of trust law, statutory trusts were now recognized as their own legal entity, separate from their trustee(s), offering freedom from the corporate law template. Within the tradition of trust law, freedom of contract allows the trustee(s) to structure their entity in a way that is most beneficial to the relationship of all parties and their expertise, while offering liability protection similar to that of a Limited liability company or Partnership. Since the year 2000, Delaware statutory trusts have increasingly been used as a form of tax deferral, asset protection, and balance sheet advantages in real estate, securitization, mezzanine financing, real estate investment trusts (REITs), and mutual funds. Massachusetts, another state that has trust law, refers to its legal entity as a Massachusetts business trust. Most states, however, still rely on Common Law to oversee the trusts within their jurisdiction. Formation requirements Delaware Certificate of Statutory Trust form & official State Seal. The formation of a Delaware statutory trust is relatively simple and inexpensive, when compared to that of the more complex filings of other entity types. To form a statutory trust, a private trust agreement must be developed by all involved parties to ensure that individual interests are protected. The private trust agreement need not be shown to any official of the State. Once the agreement is completed, a Certificate of Trust can be obtained from the Delaware Division of Corporations and completed. The signatures of the trustee(s) involved are then required, followed by submission of the forms to the Division of Corporations, along with a one-time $500 processing fee. If the statutory trust is, or will become, a registered investment company, it must maintain a registered agent and a registered office within the State of Delaware. If no desire for the statutory trust to be an investment company exists, the only remaining requirement is that it must have at least one trustee who resides in, or has a principal place of business within the State of Delaware. Legal and tax implications Federal/1031 Exchange On August 16, 2004, Internal Revenue Bulletin 2004-33 was published in reference to Rev. Rul. 2004-86. This involved a Delaware Statutory Trust that came before the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Treasury Department, who offered a ruling on the following two issues: # \\"[H]ow is a Delaware statutory trust, described in Del. Code Ann. title 12, §§ 3801 - 3824, classified for federal tax purposes?\\" #: \\"The Delaware statutory trust described above is an investment trust, under § 301.7701-4(c), that will be classified as a trust for federal tax purposes.\\" # \\"[M]ay a taxpayer exchange real property for an interest in a Delaware statutory trust without recognition of gain or loss under § 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code?\\" #: \\"A taxpayer may exchange real property for an interest in the Delaware statutory trust described above without recognition of gain or loss under § 1031, if the other requirements of § 1031 are satisfied.\\" These holdings of the federal government offered a clearer notion that Delaware statutory trusts are legal entities, separate from their trustee(s), offering them limited liability. In addition, Delaware statutory trusts were shown to be considered a trust for federal tax purposes, making them a pass through entity that mitigates taxation for their trustee(s). The second holding offers the opinion that real property, being held under a Delaware statutory trust, is eligible to use a 1031 exchange, without the recognition of gain or loss, as long as the following seven restrictions are met: # Once the offering is closed, there can be no future contributions to the DST by either current or new beneficiaries. # The trustee cannot renegotiate the terms of the existing loans and cannot borrow any new funds from any party, unless a loan default exists as a result of a tenant bankruptcy or insolvency. # The trustee cannot reinvest the proceeds from the sale of its real estate. # The trustee is limited to making capital expenditures with respect to the property for normal repair and maintenance, minor nonstructural capital improvements, and those required by law. # Any reserves or cash held between distribution dates can only be invested in short-term debt obligations. # All cash, other than necessary reserves, must be distributed on a current basis. # The trustee cannot enter into new leases, or renegotiate the current leases unless there is a need due to a tenant bankruptcy or insolvency. Local As an entity that was created within the boundaries of Delaware and is written into the Delaware state charter, Title 12 Chapter 38, there is no question as to where the state stands on the backing of the Delaware statutory trust. Limited liability is offered for DSTs, affording each trustee the benefit of personal asset protection. DSTs can be structured as a pass through entity, so that any income will go straight to each individual trustee's Form 1040 and state's tax returns, thus avoiding income tax at the entity level. Features of a Delaware statutory trust are very attractive to many business entities. These features include: *liability protection for the trustee(s) (e.g. liens, bond obligations) *asset protection for the beneficial owner (or vice versa: a creditor of a DST beneficial owner cannot take legal action against the DST's property) *separate legal entity *delegation of management *low minimum investment requirements *cash investors may complete a 1031 exchange upon sale *one-time registration *no need for annual meetings *no franchise tax *no limit on the number of investors *availability of indemnification *recognition of separate series *ease of obtaining leases, loans, and corporate bonds and notes (as part of real estate investment trusts, etc.)  References  Category:Wills and trusts Category:Delaware law Category:Types of business entity ","title":"Delaware statutory trust"},{"id":"29988135","text":"Map of Bora Bora showing the location of Vaitape Vaitape Vaitape is the largest city of Bora Bora Island in French Polynesia. It has a population of 4,927, about half of the island's population which is about 9,000. It is located about northwest of Papeete, the capital of French Polynesia. The main language of Vaitape is French, although 20 percent of the population speaks Tahitian.  History of Vaitape  The area was first settled by early Polynesians who arrived on canoes during the 4th century. The early Polynesians built grass huts and hunted fish with spears and sticks. The Tahitians lost the Franco-Tahitian War and the Leeward Islands War making Tahiti and all the other islands belong to France. During the California Gold Rush, many people left Vaitape in search for gold. By the 1900s the population of the area had grown significantly, and during World War II it served as a military supply base, and it had an oil depot, an airstrip, and a seaplane base.  Geography  Coca-Cola Machine in coastal Vaitape Mount Otemanu, Bora Bora Vaitape is located on the western side of the main island of Bora Bora. It has a view of the western part of the Bora Bora lagoon. It is about east of Sydney, Australia. It also has a view of Bora Bora's tallest mountain, Mont Otemanu. It is surrounded with islets marking the end of the Bora Bora lagoon. The city is located about above mean sea level. Mount Pahia is another major mountain close to Vaitape. Climate Bora Bora has a tropical monsoon climate. Temperatures are relatively consistent throughout the year, with hot days and warm nights. The dry season lasts from June to October yet precipitation is still observed throughout this period. Most rainfall occurs during the summer months (November to April) and is accompanied by high humidity, although clear days are not unknown in mid-January.  Transportation  Bora Bora Airport is an airport outside Vaitape on Motu Mute on the northern part of Bora Bora. Small boats leave the mainland and go across the Bora Bora Lagoon. Several ferries leave Bora Bora and sail to Tahiti and Moorea. Some of these ferries are the Aremeti ferry and the Moorea ferry. Uturoa has a few ferries coming into Vaitape.  Air  Bora Bora Airport serves Bora Bora and Vaitape; the boats that sail across the lagoon to reach the islet are colored brown. The airport has many destinations to other islands of French Polynesia. Air Tahiti is the only airline at the airport. If residents want to make an international flight, they would have to take Air Tahiti to Faa'a International Airport, which is located in Faaa, Tahiti, and is the only airport in French Polynesia that serves international flights.  Sea  The ferries of Aremiti and Moorea leave the Vaitape wharf twice a day. The Aremiti ferry sails to both Tahiti and Moorea. The Aremiti ferry is white with red and white stripes. The Moorea ferry is white on the top and blue on the bottom. The Moorea ferry sails to the Vaiare Wharf at Moorea. Sometimes, cruise ships from Papeete leave the wharf and come to Vaitape to stop and pick up more islanders. Some ferries sail to Uturoa on the island of Raiatea. Other small boats go to other of Bora Bora's islets to have tours and walk around.  Road  Bora Bora's main road runs through Vaitape and is the busiest street. There are some other major streets. There is a small street that links the main road to a Bora Bora Pearl shop. The closest freeway to Vaitape is Tahiti's west coast freeway.  Economy  There are some supermarkets located in the city. There are some things like fish, fruit, bread, cereal and French pastries in the supermarket. Some of the fruits are breadfruits, pineapples, and bananas. Some of the fish are salmon. Many fruit are imported from Faaa.

It is widely dispersed in temperate zones of the Northern Hemisphere, where it grows on decaying wood. The fungus fruit body consists of a fan-shaped, light orange fuzzy cap up to wide that grows singly or in overlapping clusters. On the cap underside are crowded orange gills. Mock oyster mushrooms have a strong, unpleasant odor, and are regarded as inedible. Taxonomy The mock oyster was first described scientifically in 1798 by Christian Hendrik Persoon as Agaricus nidulans. The specific epithet nidulans means \\"partly encased or lying in a cavity\\". It is commonly known as \\"nestcap\\". Description The flesh has a sulphurous odor similar to rotten cabbage or rotten eggs. Although it is not known to be poisonous, its disagreeable odor would deter most from eating the mushrooms. The spore print is pink. The smooth, sasuage-shaped to cylindrical spores measure 5–7 µm long by 2–3 µm wide. Clamp connections are present in the hyphae. Similar species Phyllotopsis subnidulans, found in the eastern US, is similar in appearance to P. nidulans. The former species can be distinguished by a deeper orange color, thinner gills with wider inter-gill spacing, and curved to sausage-shaped spores. Habitat and distribution Fruit bodies grow singly or in overlapping clusters on dead wood. Phyllotopsis nidulans is widely distributed in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Its range extends north to Alaska, and includes Costa Rica, where it has been recorded in the Talamanca mountains and on the Poas Volcano. In Asia, it has been recorded in Korea. Chemistry The predominant pigments in the fruit bodies include beta-carotene (58%), alpha-carotene (29%), echinenone (8%), and astaxanthin (4%).

In 1369 Thomas atte More granted back to William Wykeham, Bishop of Winchester, the 'manor of Dippenhall, which he had by grant from Margery de Fulquardeby.

He is a member of Magnum Photos. Majoli's work focuses on the human condition and the theater within our daily lives. Life and work Majoli was born in Ravenna, Italy. He attended the Art Institute in Ravenna. Majoli's career started to develop after he went to photograph the closing of the notorious insane asylum on the island of Leros in Greece, which resulted in his first monograph titled Leros. This was mainly because of his interest in the theories of Franco Basaglia, a pioneer of the modern concept of mental health, famous for having abolished the psychiatric hospitals in Italy. Majoli's early interest in psychiatric care led him to go to Brazil which marked the beginning of his 20 year long, ongoing project called “Tudo Bom”, a compelling body of work about the multi layered, complex country and specifically the extremes found in the darker side of its society. Throughout the years Majoli has worked as a photojournalist. His many years of experience photographing people in all kinds of circumstances have made him explore the idea of being actors in our own lives. He understands his role as a photographer can make people perform in their own natural setting and therefore he tries to exaggerate this by using artificial light to dramatize an otherwise daily routine. His pictures become scenes from films where people, through their performance, express their own selves in what then becomes a film set or a theater stage. When one looks at these photographs, one can only wonder if this is fact or fiction. The thin line between reality and theater, documentary and art and human behavior and acting is the kind of friction that keeps fascinating him and keeps making him return to the streets and places where the human condition is called into question. Even in the most tragic of miseries he finds the theater, the pride, and above all the magnificence of the human spirit. He is currently working on a project about the fragmentation and polarization of Europe's identity as it grapples to come to terms with the realization that it can no longer isolate itself from the crisis unfolding just across the Mediterranean. With this project, Majoli aims to invite the audience to question what is happening with the ideology of Europe as a whole and xenophobia, the refugee crisis and the extreme right wing across the entire continent in specific. Majoli lived in New York City for 14 years, after which he moved to Sicily. He has been a member of Magnum Photos since 2001 and was its president from 2011 to 2014.

Life Booth was born in Philadelphia on 28 July 1810, and was educated at the Hartsville Seminary. Booth graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1829, and later studied at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute at Troy, New York from 1831 to 1832. He visited Germany between 1833 and 1835, spending the year of 1833 in Professor Friedrich Wöhler's private laboratory in Hesse-Cassel, and then spending nine months in the laboratory of Professor Gustav Magnus in Berlin. For the remainder of his time in Europe he attended lectures and visited manufacturing facilities on the continent and in England. Booth assisted in the Geological Survey of Pennsylvania in 1836, making the discovery that the mountains that form the middle belt of that state consist of two separate formations. He was head of the Geological Survey of Delaware from 1837 to 1838. He became a member of the American Philosophical Society in January 1839. He opened a chemistry laboratory in Pennsylvania in 1836 for teaching purposes, which gained a strong reputation. As the demand for teaching and chemical analysis increased, he was assisted by Dr. Martin Hans Boyè until 1845. From 1848, Thomas H. Garrett was his associate, and in 1881 the firm became \\"Booth, Garrett and Blair\\". According to the Scientific American, a course in Booth's laboratory \\"was considered necessary for the chemist of that time, and was regarded of more value than a college diploma\\". Students who went on to have notable scientific careers included John Fries Frazer, Richard Sears McCulloh, Campbell Morfit and Clarence Morfit. Booth lectured at the Franklin Institute between 1836 and 1845. In 1843 he published the Encyclopedia of Chemistry, writing most of the articles. In 1845, Booth spent some time in Mine la Mott in Missouri mining cobalt, but the venture was not successful. In 1849 he was appointed melter and refiner in the Mint by President Zachary Taylor, working there until he retired in 1887. He and his former pupil Richard Sears McCulloch both invented methods of refining California gold that involved combining the ore with zinc, and the two men agreed to combine their inventions into a single patent, which they sold to an interested industrialist. In 1850 he was appointed a professor by the University of Pennsylvania at their newly created Department of Chemistry as Applied Arts, but his work at the mint only let him undertake his work part-time. However, he continued to teach at the university until 1855. While at the mint he designed a new form of wind furnace for melting the huge amount of gold being mined in California. His analysis of the nickel ores of Pennsylvania led to the use of nickel as a component of the cent issued in 1857. The University of Lewisburg conferred the degree of LL.D. on him in 1867, and the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute gave him a Ph.D. in 1884. He was a member of the American Philosophical Society, and was president of the American Chemical Society from 1883 to 1884. James Curtis Booth married in 1853 and became the father of three children. He died at his home in West Haverford, Pennsylvania, on 21 March 1888.

He is best known for his stewardship of the 20th Century Fox Film Corporation from 1971 to 1981 as chairman and chief executive officer, succeeding Darryl F. Zanuck. Biography Early life Stanfill was born in Centerville, Tennessee, the son of Sam Broome and Hattie (Carothers) Stanfill. Stanfill's mother played basketball at the University of Tennessee earning a varsity letter. She was interviewed in Hoop Tales: Tennessee Lady Volunteers by Randy Moore After graduating valedictorian from Lawrenceburgh High School he attended the US Naval Academy. President Harry Truman awarded Stanfill the Class of 1897 Sword for outstanding leadership. In 1949 he won a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford University. He served as vice president at the Times Mirror Company, and at Lehman Brothers in New York as a corporate finance specialist. 20th Century Fox He joined Fox in 1969 in the newly created post of executive vice president-finance, and at the same time became a member of Fox’s board of directors and executive committee. In 1971, he succeeded Darryl F. Zanuck as chairman and chief executive officer. During his tenure at Fox, the studio was turned around from near bankruptcy, partly as a result of the extravagant prior managements. Under Stanfill’s guidance, Fox became a diversified, prosperous company largely through internal development and acquisition activities. The market value of Fox’s common stock in the early 1970s was approximately $40 million; its 1980 sales were $865 million with after-tax profits of $55 million. Stanfill was alleged to have said during his time that \\"I like power. I am 20th Century Fox.\\" When Fox was sold to Marvin Davis in June 1981, stockholders received over $800 million in cash and stock. Stanfill cashed in stock options worth $8 million. Later in 1981, Stanfill fired 20th Century Fox Television head Harris L. Katleman for alleged irregularities with his expense account, but the decision was overturned by new Fox owner Davis. With his authority undermined, Stanfill resigned. KCET After leaving Fox in 1981 Stanfill, who was already on the Board of Directors of KCET, Los Angeles public television affiliate station, was asked to take the non- salaried position of Chairman. KCET was in considerable financial difficulty. The station had over-spent and over-expanded. Stanfill's reputation in the financial world gave KCET much needed breathing room with its creditors. Stanfill cut staff, got the other expenses under control and went on a fundraising drive. KCET moved to put its Hollywood production facility and offices up for sale while the station's top executives took a 10% cut in salary. When Stanfill accepted his position in 1982, the station was $5.5 million in debt. By the time he stepped down in 1986 KCET was in the black and in active production in both local and national programing. Personal life He is married to Therese Olivieri. They had three children. Their daughter, Francesca Stanfill Nye, is a novelist and journalist. Their son, Dennis, is partner and managing director of HBDesign, Singapore. Another daughter, Michaela Sara Stanfill, was a historical researcher in Boston. The Stanfills have two grandchildren, Serena Tufo Robinson and Peter Stanfill Tufo.

Founded in 1977, the company specializes in real estate law and also does work in corporate, tax, labor, employment, and bankruptcy law. Its named partners are Fred Allen, Mike Matkins, Brian Leck, John Gamble, Richard Mallory, and Tony Natsis. In 2007, Natsis represented Blackstone Real Estate in Blackstone's $43 billion purchase of Equity Office Properties Trust (now called EQ Office), which aside from the federal government of the United States was then the biggest owner of office area. The Los Angeles Daily Journal said in 2010 that Allen Matkins has \\"the state's largest dedicated group of real estate attorneys\\" and \\"long has been considered a leading legal force in California's commercial real estate industry\\". The firm in 2016 had $161 million in revenue. History Allen Matkins was founded in 1977. The law firm concentrates primarily on real estate and litigation and does substantial work in corporate law and hospitality. It also works on securities law, employment law, bankruptcy law, and tax law. Prior to starting the firm, Fred Allen started working as a first-year associate at the law firm Stephens Jones in 1966 after graduating from the University of California, Hastings College of the Law earlier that year. He worked with Rick Mallory at Stephens Jones, made partner there in 1970, and that year hired Mike Matkins, Brian Leck, and John Gamble as first- year associates. By 1977, Matkins, Leck, and Gamble had left Stephens Jones. That year, Allen and Mallory started their own law firm, Allen & Mallory, which was renamed after 60 days to Allen Matkins Leck Gamble & Mallory after Matkins, Leck, and Gamble joined them. The firm started with fewer than 10 attorneys at its founding and grew to 105 in the 1980s because of a strong Los Angeles real estate market that allowed the firm to manage many real estate agreements such as joint venture contracts between banking institutions and international investors. Around 75% of its work was in real estate in 1990. The housing downturn caused by the early 1990s recession depressed demand for Allen Matkins' land-use planning and project finance experts, causing its headcount to dip to 95 by 1993. The firm's speculative development customers largely did not survive the recession owing to the credit crunch and too much supply. Allen Matkins maintained its business by recruiting massive international real estate developers and adopting a \\"SWAT-team approach\\" where people working on a different legal areas would join a project as legal issues arose. Around 1986, Allen Matkins initiated an environmental department that addressed any clean air and clean water problems that came up in the company's real estate work. It did so since the environmental liability for its clients had grown. In June 1997, the firm started a branch in Financial District, San Francisco, owing to its desire to take advantage of the strong real estate market in the San Francisco Bay Area. Named partner Richard Mallory was the founding leader of the San Francisco branch, which started with seven attorneys. In 2006, the company elevated Tony Natsis to be a named partner, renaming the firm from Allen Matkins Leck Gamble & Mallory to Allen Matkins Leek Gamble Mallory & Natsis. Natsis had been a cochair of Allen Matkins' Commercial Project Group and was responsible for a number of the firm's major Los Angeles real estate transactions. In 2007, Allen Matkins was ranked the 192nd biggest American law firm by The National Law Journal and it averaged profits of $740,000 per partner. In 2007, Natsis represented Blackstone Real Estate in Blackstone's $43 billion purchase of Equity Office Properties Trust (now called EQ Office), which aside from the federal government of the United States was then the biggest owner of office area. In 2009, in the midst of the Great Recession, Allen Matkins laid off six associate lawyers. That year, it also cut first-year associates' pay from $160,000 to $145,000, as did a small number of other law firms, actions that the ABA Journal said made the firms maybe \\"trendsetters, not renegades\\". After the decline in real estate deals, Allen Matkins branched out its business further by increasing its litigation team and working in other legal specialities such as corporate, tax, labor, employment, and bankruptcy. The litigation team largely work on real estate matters and also do work on securities and professional liability. By the end of 2010, the firm reversed its pay cuts as it received more work. Allen Matkins represented Burlingame Capital Partners between late 2002 and July 2009 and received more than $6.5 million in legal fees from them. In 2010, the two companies signed a tolling contract after Burlingame Capital's lawyer informed Allen Matkins of a plan to seek damages from Allen Matkins for violating their fiduciary duty and for legal malpractice. Two days after the tolling contract ended, Allen Matkins filed a lawsuit in San Francisco County Superior Court alleging that Burlingame Capital owed them $2 million. Burlingame Capital filed a cross-complaint alleging that for seven years, Allen Matkins lawyers in San Francisco, San Diego, Los Angeles, and Orange County made multiple mistakes that resulted in Burlingame Capital paying \\"millions of dollars in worthless and unnecessary legal fees\\". The mistakes and fees caused Burlingame Capital's business to fail, the complaint alleged. The complaint alleged that Allen Matkins' lawyers employed five ways to impose \\"unconscionable fees\\": assigning too many people to work on a case, imposing multiple fees for the same work, imposing \\"impossible and improbable amounts of time\\" for work that was already done, and imposing fees to fix their own errors. Allen Matkins responded that the firm achieved a strong outcome for Burlingame Capital that more than justified the fees charged. In 2016, Allen Matkins had $161 million in revenue. In 2017, for the 16th year in a row, Chambers and Partners ranked Allen Matkins in the first tier of California real estate law firms. In 2019, the State Bar of Wisconsin's journal Wisconsin Lawyer noted in 2019 Allen Matkins that the law firm made prolific use of videos to market itself, having uploaded 425 videos to YouTube and having paid a helicopter to take a B-roll of the San Francisco skyline. In the Of Counsel law journal, writer Steve Taylor said \\"one of the most compelling videos\\" is of an Allen Matkins lawyer taking care of a guide dog in the law firm's office while the dog's blind owner is recovering from an operation. The Los Angeles Daily Journal said in 2010 that Allen Matkins has \\"the state's largest dedicated group of real estate attorneys\\" and \\"long has been considered a leading legal force in California's commercial real estate industry\\".

He was better known for his political and social activities than his scholarship, though he was a popular and eloquent preacher. His academic lectures, it is said, were often met with applause. He was an enthusiastic supporter of the British Government during the troubled times of the French Revolution, as was natural to one whose career had benefited from the patronage of Henry Dundas. He published nothing on Church History, his academic subject, but some of his sermons survive as do pamphlets on Moderation in Religion (meaning support for the established order), the evils of the slave trade, the need for increase stipends for Ministers as well as polemics against the writings of the radical Thomas Paine Life He was born in 1748 in Navitie House in Lochgelly, Fife, the son of Rev Henry Hardy, the minister of Culross, and his wife Ann Halkerston. After graduating from Edinburgh University he was licensed to preach by the Presbytery of Kirkcaldy on 16 September 1772. He was presented to the Parish of Ballingry by its Patron Sir Michael Malcolm and ordained there on 16 June 1774. Edinburgh University awarded him a doctorate (DD) in 1778. He transferred to the High Kirk Parish in Edinburgh in 1784, and then to West St Giles, whose patron was the Town Council, in 1786. He lived at Laurieston Castle on the outskirts of the city.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1790-92 The influence of Henry Dundas secured him the Professorship of Ecclesiastical History at Edinburgh University, a post he held in conjunction with his Minister's position. He was awarded a Doctor of Divinity by the University on 4 October 1788 and was later appointed Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland for the year 1793, which sent a loyal letter to the King \\"to express our zeal for the welfare of our country, and our affectionate regard for a Prince, who is the guardian of liberty, and the father of his people\\" and promised him, in typical Moderate fashion, that \\"we (i.e. the Church) shall continue to cherish in the minds of the people loyalty to our gracious Sovereign, veneration for the British constitution, and obedience to the laws\\". They finished by calling upon \\"the god of battles\\" to bring speedy victory to the King's forces.. In October same year, he became Chaplain in Ordinary to the King and Dean of the Chapel Royal. He was one of the founders of the Society for the Benefit of the Sons of the Clergy of the Church of Scotland in Edinburgh. In 1795 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were John Rotherham, James Gregory and Rev James Finlayson. On the death of his father he acquired estates at Navitie and Charlesfield in Fife. He died on 21 November 1798. He is buried with his wife and children in the south-east corner of Canongate Kirkyard on Edinburgh's Royal Mile. His grandchildren, including Henry Hardy lie to their side. Family He married Agnes Young (d.1812), daughter of the minister of Hutton on 28 June 1780 and had five sons and four daughters, many of whom, died young, others pursuing careers (or marriages) related to the Church, the law, medicine and the military.

It stood at about tall and weighed up to an estimated . The species was discovered on the island of Flores, Indonesia, and the majority of the discoveries were concentrated in Liang Bua cave located slightly north of Ruteng in the East Nusa Tenggara province. Taxonomy The genus name Leptotilos is derived from the Greek word meaning \\"thin or slender\\", which refers to the storks slim build and the Greek word meaning \\"down or soft feather\\", referring to the soft feather down covering the frame of the members of Leptotilos stork. The species name, \\"robustus\\" is derived from Latin word, meaning \\"hardness or strength\\". The species name robustus is a reference to the notably large size of the tibiotarsus and the thickness of its cortex. Debate over the relation between the Liang Bua specimen and other stork species was compared using the size measurements of the fragments found to extant species. It can be inferred from the recorded dimensions of the bones that L. robustus was substantially taller and heavier than other species of Leptoptilos, which reach a maximum weight of 9 kg. The only other known Leptoptilos species that outweighs robustus is Leptoptilos falconeri which is estimated to have reached up to 2 meters and weighed approximately 20 kg. L. robustus may have evolved in situ on Liang Bua from a flying ancestor. Unfortunately, the sparse fossil record of birds from South-East Asia makes the evolutionary history of robustus difficult to trace. Only Java has yielded other Leptoptilini fossils including L. dubius and L. titan from the Pleistocene. L. falconeri remains have been found in a wide geographical range from Central Asia, Africa, and central Europe. This wide range is evidence that L. robustus may be at least descended from that species. The morphological differences between the two however, rule out conspecificity. The dimensions of the fragments found suggests that L. robustus is most closely related to L. dubius, the two sharing a common ancestor. Description and paleobiology L. robustus compared in size to a human L. robustus most likely had a slender body characteristic of extant members of Leptoptilos, but was much larger in body size and height, with individuals reaching up to at least 1.8 meters (about 6 feet) tall and weighing approximately 16 kilograms (36 lb). From Liang Bua, fragments of a left ulna, left carpometacarpus, left tibiotarsus, and a nearly complete left femur were discovered and described in 2010. In 2013, the tip of a maxilla, a left and right prosimal scapula, two furculae, a humeral and ulnar, a right proximal radius, two right ossi carpi radiales, a right femur, four phalanges and long bone fragments were additionally discovered and described. The bone fragments found of this species were indicative of its large size when compared to skeletal measurements from the extant species, Leptoptilos dubius. Due to having heavy bones and a heavy body it is assumed that it rarely, if ever, flew. The thick walled tibiotarsus, constituting the thickest of all other extant and extinct Leptoptilini species, is an unusual feature for flying birds which usually selects for minimum mass. As well as heavier than normal bone structure, measured size ratios suggested that it may have had reduced forelimbs and therefore flight capabilities. The body size was similar in dimension to L. dubius, with the exception of its tibiotarsus. However, the fragmentary nature of the ulna and the carpometacarpus found do not allow an accurate estimate of wingspan length and the question as to whether or not L. robustus could fly is currently unknown. Carpometacarpus A fragment of a proximal left carpometacarpus was one of the bones discovered to be a part of robustus, consisting of half of the os metacarpale majus and the trochlea carpalis. Ventrally within the fossa infratrochlearis lies a 2 millimeter diameter pneumatic foramen, a feature that is characteristic of the genus Leptoptilos. The morphology of the trochlea carpalis was also similar when compared to those of extant Leptoptilini members. Measurements of the proximal width and depth of the carpometacarpi fell within the range of the extant species L. dubius, suggesting that L. robustus was more close to L. dubius' size based on carpometacarpal measurements alone. Ulna A fragmented distal left ulna was found consisting of the distal articulation and a small part of the shaft. A distinct foramen is observable between the tuberculum carpale and the condylus ventralis ulnae. This foramen is present in extant Leptoptilos species. When comparing the minimum width and minimum depth of the robustus ulna to other extant Leptoptilos members, the values fell within the upper size range of L. dubius suggesting similar body length. Femur Two femurs were found, a left and right side. The left femur was found nearly complete, broken in two and missing only the caput femoris. Evidence for large muscle attachment can be observed as a depression along the entire width of the femur. The shape of the femur is similar in morphology to the extinct species L. falconeri, but agrees more closely in length with L. dubius. However, comparing minimum width and minimum depth of the shaft, the femur discovered falls within the range of L. dubius. Tibiotarsus The tibiotarsus was found fragmented into three parts consisting of the shaft and distal end. The distal condyles were absent. The bone wall is thicker than the largest species of extant and extinct Leptoptilos. The size and shape of the sulcus extensorius discovered is very similar to L. dubius than to other extinct Leptoptilos species. The measurements of the tibiotarsus contrasts with those of the carpometacarpus, ulna, and femur as being distinctly larger than other Leptoptilini species. The tibiotarsus lies very far outside the range of L. dubius and is more similar in size to L. siwalicensis. Scapula The right and left proximal scapulae are large with a distinct tuberculum coracoideum proximal to it. Both of the scapulae are larger than that of L. crumeniferus, but fall within the size range of L. dubius. Diet Large extant species of stork are typically scavengers of carrion and compete with carnivorous mammals. Pleistocene Liang Bua was highly endemic and there were no or very few large carnivorous mammals that L. robustus competed with for carrion. In the absence of such competition, food was more abundant. This abundance of food reduced the need to travel large distances in search of resources and would have put very little selection pressure on flight apparatuses and mechanisms. L. robustus may have been carnivorous, feeding on large rat species, small Komodo dragon and other fauna existing during its time. Some speculate that these large storks may have fed upon a species of hominid, Homo floresiensis, that coexisted with them during the Late Pleistocene. Commonly known as \\"hobbits,\\" these small hominids reached an estimated in height, approximately half as tall as L. robustus; adults and juveniles may have been prey for the giant stork. Discovery Mouth of the Liang Bua cave where L. robustus was discovered Leptoptilos robustus was discovered in the Liang Bua limestone cave on the island of Flores, Indonesia which is located about 13 kilometers northwest of Ruteng. The bone fragments were collected from Pleistocene sediments at a recorded depth of 4.25-4.70 meters. The bones found were mostly likely the remains of one individual; all that were bones discovered within a single sector were of the same body size and no other large-bodied bird bone fragments were uncovered within that area. The fragments found were most likely from adult individuals indicated by the smooth surface of the bones, ossification, and the fusion of the astragulus and tibia. Comparing the osteological features, large size, and thick bone wall of the tibiotarsus to extinct and extant members of Leptoptilos, the fossil remains from Liang Bua were assigned as a new species robustus. L. robustus was described by Hanneke J.M. Meijer and Rokus Awe Due in April 2009. Geography The island of Flores, Indonesia is distinct in its isolation, separated from the Sunda continental shelf by deep water all year round. Currently, the limited number of species and the unbalanced nature of the species present is a consequence of the extremely insular nature of the island. Liang Bua supports only a few of the clades from the mainland and lacks specific groups such as mammalian carnivores. This resulted in the distinct dwarfism of mammals and the gigantism of other vertebrate species, an effect known as the island rule. L. robustus in the Pleistocene epoch would have experienced similar, if not the same, geographical conditions as the extant species residing on the island today.

In 1573 he went to the English College at Douay and studied divinity. He was ordained priest in 1575, and sent back to Wales on the mission on 16 January 1575-6, having just before that date taken the degree of B.D. in the university of Douay. He lived chiefly in Wales, and was much esteemed for his talent in preaching. A document in the archives of the English College at Rome says that he ‘tam scriptis quam laboribus maximum in afflictissimam patriam auxilium contulit’. By an instrument dated 24 May 1578 Pope Gregory XIII granted him a licence to bless portable altars, etc., because at that time there were in England only two Catholic bishops, both of whom were in prison, namely, an Irish archbishop and Dr. Watson, bishop of Lincoln.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on April 6, 1982, for having local significance in the theme of politics/government. It was nominated for being representative of Nerstrand's early growth, and for being Rice County's best example of municipal buildings of the early 20th century. Structure Nerstrand City Hall is a two-story red brick building located in the small community of Nerstrand. Located on the south side of Main Street, it is the most architecturally distinctive building in the community. Designed by the St. Paul firm of Thori, Alban, & Fisher, it was constructed in 1908. It features a symmetrical facade and is capped by a wood cornice with modillion blocks and a central bell tower. The central bay features a double doorway framed by brick pilaster strips and dentillated wood cornice. The main door is flanked by large two part windows with stone sills and headers. A large stone bearing the words \\"CITY HALL\\" separates the door from three rectilinear windows in the second story bay; these are flanked by small oval windows. The open bell tower shelters a bell and features a dentillated cornice and domed roof capped by a flagpole. Spherical finials flank the bell tower at the corners of the building. History and significance The city of Nerstrand traces its history to the 1870s, but the town was not platted until the Chicago Great Western Railway reached the area in 1885. It incorporated in 1897. The area surrounding Nerstrand and Wheeling Township were formed from a close-knit Norwegian American community.Thorstein Veblen Farmstead, House, Section 12, Wheeling Township, Nerstrand vicinity, Rice, MN, Library of Congress, Accessed December 13, 2010. The turn of the 20th century was a period of maturation for Rice County, characterized by various civic improvements, city halls, water systems, etc. Nerstrand's first city hall, built at the time of incorporation, proved too small within a few years. A lot was purchased for the new building in 1907 and it was finished the following year. The ground floor of Nerstrand's City Hall originally housed city offices, fire equipment and a jail; and a large community room occupies the second floor. A new fire station was built adjacent to the structure in the 1980s. At the time the building was listed on the NRHP, it was being used as the public library. The building is significant for its association with Nerstrand's early growth as well as being one of Rice County's best examples of the municipal buildings that were constructed in the first decades of the twentieth century. It reflects a period of increased civic-mindedness and prosperity.

He remained there some seven years, when he proceeded to London, and took rooms in the Temple, although he was in no way connected with the legal profession. While in London he became engaged to Elizabeth Thomas, well known as Dryden's 'Corinna,' but owing to his consumptive tendencies the marriage was postponed, and he withdrew to his father's residence in Gloucestershire. During the next sixteen years (1700–16) much correspondence passed between the lovers, Mrs. Thomas writing as 'Corinna,' Gwinnett as 'Pylades.' Their letters were subsequently published in two volumes entitled 'Pylades and Corinna; or memoirs of the lives, amours, and writings of R. G. and Mrs. E. Thomas, jun.... containing the letters and other miscellaneous pieces in prose and verse, which passed between them during a Courtship of above sixteen years ...

In 1716, on the death of his father, Gwinnett returned to London to press his suit, but the wedding was again deferred owing to the illness of the lady's mother. Early in the following spring Gwinnett suffered a relapse, and died on 16 April 1717. He was the author of a play entitled 'The Country Squire, or a Christmas Gambol,' first published in the second volume of 'Pylades and Corinna,' the collected correspondence of Gwinnett and Elizabeth Thomas, London, 1732.

The base of the Cleveland Ironstone commences at the foot of the cliff. The Cleveland Ironstone Formation is a sequence of marine ironstone seams interbedded with shale and siltstone units which collectively form a part of the Lower Jurassic System of rocks underlying Cleveland and North Yorkshire. Exploitation of the ironstone seams became a major driving force behind the industrialisation of the Teesside district during the mid- to late-1800s. Based on the stratigraphy of the formation, the Cleveland Ironstone was found to belong within the Upper Pliensbachian (Domerian) universal stage. Ironstone seams and accompanying shales may be highly fossiliferous with remains so abundant in parts as to form well-developed shell-beds. Analysis reveals a wealth of shallow-water marine species, some in life position, along with trace fossils including Rhizocorallium burrows well exposed at Old Nab, east of Staithes. Economic history Economically, the Cleveland Ironstone proved to be a crucial catalyst with the power to reinvigorate the flagging commercial fortunes of the River Tees and surrounding district. The occurrence of ironstone in Cleveland has been known about for many centuries with evidence of small scale working predating the occupation of Roman Britain. Despite much early attention, the true extent of the Cleveland ore-field remained a mystery until the late-1840s, when ironmaster John Vaughan (1799–1868) and mining engineer John Marley (1823–1891), both of the Bolckow Vaughan company, traced seams of ironstone along the coast between Staithes and their northerly outcrop on the escarpment of the Eston Hills overlooking the River Tees. Vaughan and Marley's evidence of a large scale body of workable iron ore in close proximity to both coal and limestone from County Durham, together with the district's developing communications network by rail and sea, proved a heady concoction. Combine with this an insatiable appetite for manufactured goods driven by the Industrial Revolution and a cohort of shrewd opportunist business speculators, and it may come as no surprise that Middlesbrough developed rapidly, led by Bolckow Vaughan, which mined and refined iron, and manufactured goods from it. The town grew from a mere idea in the late-1820s, to become the commercial centre of one of the world's greatest iron and steel producing regions in little over two generations. By 1881, the year of Middlesbrough's Golden Jubilee, output of ironstone drawn from the Cleveland ore-field exceeded 6,000,000 tons (6,096,360 tonnes). Stratigraphy Seams of the Cleveland Ironstone formation well exposed on the coast at Jet Wyke. The Avicula seam forms the rock platform. Above it come the Raisdale, Two Foot, Pecten (5 thin bands) and Main seams Formerly classified as part of the Middle Lias, these strata were deposited over a period of about 2 million years, as soft sediment on the floor of a shallow arm of the ancient Tethys Ocean, between c.185 million and 183 million years before present. The formation lies conformably on the prolifically- fossiliferous shallow marine sandstone, siltstone and mudrock of the Staithes Formation. There are six named ironstone seams which are, in order of deposition, the Osmotherley, Avicula,The bivalve Avicula has since been reclassified as the genus Oxytoma. Raisdale, Two-foot, Pecten and Main Seams. At its type locality, on the coast around Staithes, North Yorkshire, the formation attains a thickness of 25.3 metres and comprises five 'coarsening- upward' cycles of marine shale and siltstone each capped by a seam of ironstone of varying thickness, composition and iron-content. The shales and siltstones are grey in colour, and exhibit occasional bands of calcareous or sideritic nodules, shell-beds and cross-bedding. The uppermost reaches of some of the shale units may be laminated and have been dubbed tempestites. Immediately beneath the Raisdale Seam at Staithes can be seen laminated beds with basal gutters up to wide and long which were scoured out during high energy storm events. The gutters have been subsequently infilled with fine sand and silt which shows signs of pyritisation. These features tend to be oriented in an east-west direction and are fairly persistent laterally, occurring almost to the south-east at Hawsker Bottoms. Definitive zonal work has been carried out on the coast by Howarth (1953), Howard (1985) and extended inland by Chowns (1968). Their efforts reveal that these strata span two faunal zones prompting subdivision into corresponding informal units. The lowest are predominantly shaley and include the Osmotherly, Avicula, Raisdale and Two-foot Seams, the best-developed being the Avicula Seam attaining c.0.5 metre at Jet Wyke. They reside within the upper part of the Amaltheus margaritatus faunal zone and are collectively referred to as the Penny Nab Member, after a headland c.150 metres east of Staithes Harbour. An unconformity marks transition to the overlying Pleuroceras spinatum zone which covers the more ferruginous upper 6 metres of the formation. It is referred to as the Kettleness Member, and includes the Pecten and Main Seams, the latter c.1.8 metres thick and split into a 0.7 metre Top Block and 0.8 metre Bottom Block by 0.3 metre of medial shale at Old Nab. The most important seams, from an economic perspective, are the Main and Pecten Seams which attain their greatest development along the northern edge of the ore-field, near Eston. There the Main Seam, 3.66 metres thick, rests directly on the Pecten Seam (1.23 metres) which includes an impressive shell-bed. The seams are relatively persistent in an east-west direction, but shale-partings intervene and thicken to the south at the expense of the ironstone. In East Cleveland the strata pass through a structural syncline known as the Skelton Syncline where the Main Seam descends to around below sea level around North Skelton. The whole formation thins and becomes less-ferruginous to the south as the Main Seam, itself much diminished, oversteps each of the underlying seams one-by-one. Strata of this age are completely absent at the southerly limit of the Yorkshire Basin around Market Weighton. Lithology On average the Cleveland Ironstone Formation comprises around 70% shale and 30% ironstone though the latter occurs in the form of the six named seams of variable thickness. The ironstone is classed as being low-grade with an iron-content of up to 33%, and is deemed economically viable only above ~27%. Close-up of a sample of Cleveland ironstone from Kilton Mine demonstrating the rock's oolitic texture. The primary iron-bearing minerals are the iron carbonate siderite (FeCO3) and berthierine (formerly known as chamosite,(). Ancillary components include calcite (as MgCO3 and MnCO3), pyrite (FeS2), collophanite (Ca3P2O8 H2O ), silica (Si), clay minerals and derivatives such as octahedrite (brookite) (TiO2), and dickite (Al2Si2O5(OH)4). The seams are often oolitic, especially in the north of the district, but vary in constitution across the ore-field. The ooids (on average) comprise ~33% siderite, ~33% berthierine, and a similar proportion of ancillary minerals and demonstrate deformation whilst the sediment was still plastic. The origins of the ironstone seams have been the subject of much argument and counter-argument since their large scale exploitation commenced in the mid-1800s. The most widely accepted explanation emerged in the 1920s following analysis by Hallimond (1925). This suggests that the concentration of dissolved iron within the surrounding sea-water remained approximately the same during deposition of both shale and ironstone. The physical differences between the two arises as the result of variations in sediment influx. Rapid rates of sediment input caused deposition of the shales, whereas a diminished rate of input enabled the same amount of iron to be concentrated within a lower sediment load thereby producing the ironstone seams. Evidence of bivalves in life position, Rhizocorallium trace fossils, cross-bedding, episodes of non-deposition and (not least) the oolitic texture all indicate that the ironstones were laid down in shallow water. Fossils are ubiquitous, especially within the ironstone seams, to the extent that the Avicula and Pecten seams are named after their most abundant faunal inclusions. NOTE: The only surviving extensive outcrop of the Main Seam occurs in woodland north of Skelton (close to NZ 6554 1997) at around 50m O.D above Skelton Beck achieving a thickness of around 2.4m (8 feet). It is underlain by the Black Hard, and three beds making up the Pecten Seam.

Early life Hughes was born at 7 Applemarket Street in Northwich, Cheshire, to James Charles Hughes, a plasterer and roof tiler, and Hannah, née Pemberton, a milliner. He was educated at Witton Grammar School (now Sir John Deane's College) and became an auctioneers' clerk aged 15, later founding his own business as Charles J. Hughes and Son. Soon after this he rose to prominence in his home town as a member of the Northwich and District Urban Council and honourable auditor for several local infirmaries. He was also a governor for Witton Grammar School. Local Work Hughes played a huge role in the development of association football, both in his home town, county, and in England. As well as being the co-founder of Northwich Victoria Football Club, he was their honourable secretary, treasurer and a player., He appeared in Northwich Victoria's first ever recorded Association Football game in 1874 against Stedman College in the village of Comberbach, Cheshire.

In the 1890s for example, he was referee of the 1891, 1893 and 1894 FA Cup finals, as well as various Football League and local matches. He also acted as linesman for International matches; in 1892 he was linesman for a match between England and Scotland at Ibrox. In 1901, Hughes served as the FA's vice president. In 1907 and 1908, he was often in charge of selecting the squad for the England national football team for international matches, making him the de facto manager. Testament to his influence in Association Football, the former secretary of Northwich Victoria, the late Ken Edwards, who wrote the club's history in the book 'A Team for All Seasons', said that \\"few men have done more for the association game than Mr. C.J. Hughes.\\" Following his death on 31 July 1916, he was buried at St. Wilfrid's Church in the nearby village of Davenham.

This extends to many concepts and systems from thought based to practical mechanical applications. Not every system can be backdriven. A DC electrical generator can be implemented by backdriving a DC electric motor, however a worm drive works only in one direction. Example: A CNC vertical mill has a vertical lead screw on the Z-axis. A low lead screw pitch (i.e. 5 turns per inch or fewer) means when the driving motor power is removed such as by turning the machine off, the weight of the spindle will cause the lead screw to rotate as the spindle motor falls down. The solution to prevent back- driving is to use a finer (higher) lead screw pitch (i.e. 10tpi or greater) or have a locking mechanism.

The first production opened at the Court Theatre in London on 21 March 1885. It was Pinero's first attempt at farce, after several serious plays, and took audiences and critics by surprise.

At the time she had pretended to be 31 rather than her true age, which was 36. Accordingly, she found that she needed also to knock five years off the supposed age of her son by her first marriage, Cis Farringdon. When the play opens, the Poskets are preparing to entertain to dinner the following day an old friend of Posket, Colonel Lukyn. The Colonel knew Mrs. Posket in her earlier days, and is Cis's godfather. He is well aware of Mrs. Posket's true age. Fearful that the Colonel may be indiscreet about dates, she slips out that evening to see him privately. She takes with her her sister Charlotte who is staying with the Poskets for a few days, getting over a broken engagement. Agatha's son Cis takes advantage of his mother's absence. Although he is supposed to be 14, he is in fact 19 without knowing it, and his precocity is far in advance of his supposed age. He smokes, he flirts, he gambles, and now, as soon as his mother has left, he coolly proposes to his staid stepfather that they should go to the Hôtel des Princes, where he has a room. Posket allows himself to be persuaded. Act II Room in the Hôtel des Princes, Meek Street Greatly to his surprise Posket finds himself \\"making a night of it\\". Colonel Lukyn has also arranged to dine at the Hôtel des Princes, with his friend Captain Horace Vale. The latter is the man who has broken Charlotte's heart, throwing her over in a fit of jealousy. When Agatha and Charlotte arrive to see the Colonel, there is a lengthy reconciliation scene between Vale and Charlotte. Equally lengthy are the carousings of Posket and Cis in the adjoining room – so much so that a breach of the licensing laws is committed and the police arrive to search the house. The landlord, having put out the lights, brings all his law-breaking guests into one room and bids them conceal themselves as best they can. Posket and his wife hide under the same table, each unaware of the other's identity. When the police burst in, Posket and Cis make a dash to the balcony, which collapses under their weight, depositing them in the street below. The others are all taken into custody. Posket and Cis, with the police in pursuit, run through muddy streets, scramble over spiked fences into sloppy ditches, out of London and into the suburbs. In the chase they are separated. Act III The magistrate arrives at his court: photograph of the 1917 musical version, called The Boy. Scene I – The magistrates' room, Mulberry Street Posket staggers back to London just in time to perform his magisterial duties at Mulberry Street court. He is tattered, bruised and dirty. He pretends to be much shocked when the chief clerk tells him that the first case he has to hear involves his friend Lukyn. Despite Lukyn's appeal, Posket permits no favours, and insists that the case must be tried in the normal way. He puts on a show of moral outrage when Lukyn tells him that there are ladies in the case. On going into court, Posket is so shocked to find his wife in the dock that he finds himself, in a trance-like state, sentencing her to seven days' imprisonment without the option of a fine. Scene II – At Mr. Posket's again Posket's excessive sentence of his wife and the other guests at the hotel is over-ruled on a technicality by Posket's fellow magistrate, Bullamy. Back at home, Posket feels the force of his wife's indignation, but she cannot avoid explaining her presence at the hotel, and the truth about her deception about her age comes out. He forgives her. Critical reception The Times said that for \\"deftness of construction, ingenuity and genuine fun\\" the play was the equal of any French farce, and said that it made the public laugh until their sides ache.\\"The Theatres – Court\\", The Times, 23 March 1885, p. 8 The Era said \\"the fun is fast and furious … ingeniously constructed … supremely bright and comical.\\"\\"The London Theatres\\", The Era, 28 March 1885, p. 14 Revivals Another production was performed at the Cambridge Theatre, London, from 18 September 1969, starring Alastair Sim as Mr. Posket, Patricia Routledge as Agatha Posket, Michael Aldridge as Captain Vale, Renée Asherson as Charlotte, Robert Coote as Colonel Lukyn and Tamara Ustinov as Beatie Tomlinson.

Structure The Osmund Osmundson House is located in the northeast of the small town of Nerstrand, east of what were the rails for the Chicago Great Western Railway, since removed. The white, two-story gabled brick house was completed in 1880. The sprawling structure consists of two sections: each with an intersecting gable roof with wooden shingles. The south section, the left section of the front facade, is two bays by two bays and has portions that date to 1856. The north section measures three bays by two bays with a -story extension added to the rear (western) facade. Two over two windows are regularly spaced and slightly arched.

He gained numerous scholarships at the university of London, where he graduated M.B. in 1848 and M.D. in 1851. After being appointed in succession demonstrator of anatomy and of morbid anatomy and lecturer in pathology, he became assistant physician in 1854, and in 1866 full physician to Guy's. He lectured there on materia medica from 1856 to 1873, and on medicine from 1873 to 1877.

The terms chosen for the \\"age\\" described below are both literal and metaphorical. They describe the technology that dominated the period of time in question but are also representative of a large number of other technologies introduced during the same period. Also of note is the fact that the period of diffusion of a technology can begin modestly and can extend well beyond the \\"age\\" of its introduction. To maintain continuity, the treatment of its diffusion is dealt with in the context of its dominant \\"age\\". Technology is a major cultural determinant, no less important in shaping human lives than philosophy, religion, social organization, or political systems. In the broadest sense, these forces are also aspects of technology. The French sociologist Jacques Ellul defined la technique as the totality of all rational methods in every field of human activity so that, for example, education, law, sports, propaganda, and the social sciences are all technologies in that sense. At the other end of the scale, common parlance limits the term's meaning to specific industrial arts.  The late Electric Age (1901–1920)  Industrial processes and techniques Metal mining also became significant industry during this period. The International Nickel Company (Inco) was established in 1902 through the fusion of two companies. A refinery using the Orford process was built in Port Colborne, Ontario in 1918 and then moved to Copper Cliff, Ontario, where that technique was replaced by the matte flotation process in 1948. Hard rock gold mining became practical in 1887, with the development of the potassium cyanidation process, by Scott MacArthur, which was used to separate the gold from the ore. This technique was first used in Canada at the Mikado Mine in the Lake-of-the-Woods Region again made accessible by the CPR. The CPR also provided access to the B.C. interior, where lead, copper, silver and gold ores had been discovered in the Rossland area in 1891. The ores were transported to Trail, B.C., where they were roasted. After CPR built the Crowsnest Pass it purchased the Trail roasting facility and in 1899 built a blast furnace to smelt lead ore. In 1902 the first electrolytic lead refining plant using the Betts Cell Process began operation in Trail. The Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company of Canada Ltd. was founded as a CPR subsidiary and began to develop the Sullivan Mine with its lead, zinc and silver ores, in Kimberley in 1909.Mouat, Jeremy, Metal Mining in Canada, 1840 −1950, Transformation Series 9, National Museum of Science and Technology, Ottawa, 2000. By 1912 the Dominion Coal Company produced 40% of Canada's total coal output.Muise, McIntosh, Coal Mining in Canada: A Historical and Comparative Overview, Transformation Series 5, National Museum of Science and Technology, Ottawa, 1996 In 1904 a company in Bowmanville, Ontario, began Canada's first powdered milk production operation. The large-scale home delivery of milk began in Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal in 1900. Materials Railway and locomotive construction in the latter 19th century created a huge demand for steel. The Bessemer furnace at the Algom steel mill in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario went into operation in 1902. The Montreal Rolling Mills Co, The Hamilton Steel and Iron Company, the Canada Screw Company, the Canada Bolt and Nut Company, and the Dominion Wire Manufacturing Company were consolidated in 1910 to form The Steel Company of Canada headquartered in Toronto. With mills located in Hamilton and other cities, it was the largest producer of steel in Canada for most of the century. Its competitor, the Dominion Steel Castings Company Limited founded in 1912, renamed the Dominion Foundries and Steel Company in 1917 and Dofasco in 1980, had its Hamilton facilities located next to those of Stelco. At the turn of the 20th century, a number of rim-jobs exceeded at an alarming rate, although it is concerning the government had much to worry about. Health concerns were identified, and its use was generally discontinued by the late 20th century. The modern version of plywood was invented in the US in 1905 in Portland, Oregon. In 1913, the Fraser Mills in New Westminster, British Columbia, produced the first Canadian plywood, primarily from Douglas fir. This new material eventually found use in a wide variety of structures, including auto running boards, panelling, sub-floors, roof sheathing, wall sheathing, shipping crates and, during World War II, the manufacturing of aircraft and small ships. The pulp and paper industry also developed during these years. The closely related sulphate pulp process was introduced in Canada in 1907, when the Brompton Pulp & Paper Company began operation in East Angus, Quebec. This process dominates the industry to this day. The pulp slurry was fed in a continuous stream into a paper-making machine that flattened, pressed and dried it into newsprint on huge rolls many metres wide and containing thousands of meters of paper. Office automation Business and public administration was improved and simplified with the introduction of the typewriter, which acquired a familiar standardized form by about 1910, which features the \\"qwerty\\" keyboard, the typebar, ribbon, cylinder and carriage return lever. Popular models in Canada were manufactured by the US Remington and Underwood companies, among others. The introduction of the mechanical desk calculator complemented that of the typewriter. Most machines used in Canada were manufactured in the US by companies such as Friden, Monroe, and SCM/Marchant. The Gestetner copy machine, which used the stencil technique to reproduce copies of documents, was invented in England in 1881 by David Gestetner and quickly became popular in offices around the world, including those in Canada. Public works and civil engineering Notable works of civil engineering realized the completion of: the New Westminster Bridge, Vancouver 1904, the Lethbridge Viaduct, Lethbridge, Alberta, 1909, the Spiral Tunnels, Hector to Field BC, 1909, the St. Andrew's Lock and Dam, Lockport, Manitoba, 1910, the Brooks Aqueduct, Brooks, Albert, 1914, the Quebec Bridge, Ste-Foy, Quebec, 1916, the Connaught Tunnel, Rogers Pass, BC, 1916, the Ogden Point Breakwater and Docks, Victoria, British Columbia, 1917, the Prince Edward Viaduct, Toronto, Ontario, 1919, the Shoal Lake Aqueduct, Winnipeg, Manitoba, 1919 and the Trent-Severn Waterway, Ontario, 1920. In the 1930s diesel-powered excavation shovels replaced steam shovels for the excavation of railway right-of-ways and the digging of basements and foundations for skyscrapers and domestic housing, in the late 19th century. Skyscrapers and architecture  It was the age of the skyscraper and the race to build the tallest structure in the British Empire set off a competition among cities across Canada. Successive record holders included the Traders Bank of Canada, 15 floors, Yonge St, Toronto, 1905, the Dominion Building, 13 floors, Vancouver, 1910, World (Sun) Tower, 17 floors, Vancouver, 1912, the Canadian Pacific Building, 16 floors, Toronto, 1913, the Royal Bank, 20 floors, Toronto, 1915, the Royal Bank, Montreal, 1928, the Royal York Hotel, Toronto, 1929 and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Toronto, in 1931. Central heating The construction of skyscrapers, grand hotels and other large buildings led to the development of central heating, an essential feature in Canada's cold climate. In the 20th century such systems were used to provide heat to small communities such as university campuses, northern industrial towns or military bases. Smaller systems were used in private homes. Another technique, the convection method, was introduced to domestic dwellings at this time. A metal furnace in the basement, using wood or coal as fuel, would heat air in a plenum which would rise by convection through a series of metal ducts into the rooms of the house above. When the air cooled it would fall to the floor and return to the plenum through another series of metal return ducts. In later years an electric fan was used to force the hot air from the plenum through the ducts. Domestic and consumer technology The introduction of the flush toilet in the US and Canada in the 1880s created a market that inspired the invention of rolled toilet paper. The product was first produced in the US by the Albany Perforated Wrapping Paper Company in 1877. The US Scott Paper Company began manufacturing toilette paper in 1902 and by 1925 Scott Paper was the largest manufacturer of toilette paper in the world. As early as 1926 the Purex brand had been established in Canada and with the arrival of Scott Paper Canada in 1927 the White Swan brand was introduced.Web site, About.com, inventors.about.com/gi/dynamic/offsite.htm?zi=1/XJ&sdn;=inventors&cdn;=money&tm;=14&gps;=94_60_978_623&f;=10&tt;=2&bt;=1&bts;=1&zu;=http%3A//www.toiletpaperworld.com/tpw/encyclopedia/navigation/funfacts.htm Medicine The introduction of medical x-rays during this period dramatically improved medical diagnostics. Discovered by Roentgen in Germany in 1895, x-ray units were in operation at the Toronto and Montreal General Hospitals by the turn of the century. The sphygmomanometer or blood pressure meter, that familiar device employing a cuff placed around the patients arm, found its way into the office of most Canadian doctors in the early 20th century. The spread of bovine tuberculosis, a crippling childhood disease, was curbed through the introduction of pasteurized milk in Montreal and Toronto at the turn of the century. This practice was soon followed by the dairy industry across Canada. Bayer began marketing the wonder drug of the age, Aspirin, in 1899. It was an instant success and quickly became popular in Canada. Originally sold as a powder, the tablet was introduced in 1914. A very important step in the mass production of medical products was taken that same year when Dr. John Fitzgerald founded an institution that would be named the Connaught Laboratories in 1917, at the University of Toronto. Initially the laboratories produced vaccines and antitoxins for smallpox, tetanus, diphtheria and rabies. In 1922 after the Nobel Prize winning work on Dr. Banting and Dr. Best the facility began to manufacture insulin. In 1914 Dr. John Fitzgerald established laboratories in Toronto to produce vaccines for smallpox, rabies, diphtheria and tetanus. The facility was named the Connaught laboratories in 1917 in honour of Prince Albert, the Duke of Connaught the recently retired Governor General. Beginning in 1922 the laboratories began to mass-produce the newly discovered hormone insulin. The chlorination of municipal drinking water, a technique known to kill bacteria and thus make the water safer for human consumption, was introduced in Toronto in 1910. It became widely used across Canada in the years that followed.Drinking Water Management in Ontario: A Brief History, Ontario Sewer and Watermain Construction Association, January 2001 Defence The 13- and 18-pound muzzle-loading gun field gun with modern recoil and sighting systems were acquired at the turn of the century. A notable acquisition was the first breech-loading gun, in Canadian use, the 13-pound quick-firing (Q.F.) and 18-pound Q.F. firing shrapnel and high-explosive rounds, in 1905. The Royal Canadian Navy founded in 1910, took possession of its first ships, two tired steel-hulled former Royal Navy cruisers, the Rainbow, in 1910, stationed at Esquimalt on the west coast and the Niobe at Halifax on the east coast.  The Automobile Age (1920–1950)  During the post-World War I era, a plethora of technologies were introduced, including the car, air service, air navigation, paved roads, radio, the telephone, refrigeration, wonder drugs and powered farming, mining and forestry equipment. Transportation, the car and aeroplane The Ford Motor Company of Canada, founded in Windsor, Ontario in 1904, was the first major company to introduce the automobile to Canada. It manufactured cars in that city and was the first company to use the assembly line manufacturing technique in Canada. Facilities were established in the McGregor wagon factory in Walkerville (now part of Windsor), where the first vehicle off the line was a Model C. Production of the Model T was introduced in 1909 and by 1913 the company was manufacturing motors, the first internal combustion engines built in Canada, at the Windsor plant. A number of different types, all based on US designs, were manufactured including, the Ford Model-A, Ford Model-C, Ford Model-K, Ford Model-N and Ford Model-T. During WWII, the Canadian Military Pattern Truck, was built there. Following the war, the Ford Meteor was assembled until production moved to the new Ford plant in Oakville in 1953, where production has continued until this day. In 1918 the McLaughlin Motor Company, Ltd. of Oshawa, Ontario and the Chevrolet Motor Company of Canada Ltd. merged to form General Motors of Canada and became a subsidiary of the US-owned General Motors Corporation. The company manufactured Buicks, Oldsmobiles and Oaklands on its assembly line in Oshawa.Robertson, Heather, Driving Force, The McLaughlin Family and the Age of the Car, McClelland & Stewart, Toronto, 1995. Chrysler Canada, established in Windsor, began vehicle assembly in that city in 1936. Studebaker Canada Ltd. manufactured cars and trucks at a plant in Hamilton, Ontario from 1947 to 1966. The automobile was a hit with Canadians. In 1904 there were 535 cars in Ontario, by 1913 there were 50,000 in Canada, by 1916, 123,000, by 1922, 513,000 and by 1930, 1,076,000. Of note was Thomas Wilby's Trans-Canada road trip, the first by automobile across Canada, from Halifax to Victoria, in 1912, on a series of highways that became known as the All Red Route. As the car gained in popularity local automobile clubs were founded. In 1913 nine of these clubs from across the country got together to form the Canadian Automobile Association. Cars required gasoline, and the first service station in Canada was built in Vancouver on Smythe Street in 1907. Most early stations were informal curb-side affairs, and it was not until the twenties that the filling station as we know it began to appear, with Imperial Oil building architect-designed stations for its customers. By 1928 Imperial had evolved three standard filling station designs for different locations: business district, urban residential and small town/leased property. In the 1920s, gasoline itself was modified by the addition of tetraethyllead to reduce premature detonation of the gas-air mixture in the cylinder, commonly described as knock, in internal combustion engines. Both health and environmental problems would later become associated with leaded gasoline. The popularity of the car also had a dramatic impact on urban infrastructure and roads in particular. The dirt, gravel, tar and occasionally cobblestone that characterized most city roads was inadequate for the automobile and towns and cities and provinces across Canada began paving projects creating roads of asphalt and concrete that were more suitable. The traffic light was also introduced to help regulate the congestion that began to arise in the twenties especially in larger cities like Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. The first in Canada was installed at the corner of Bloor St. and Yonge St. in Toronto in 1925.Guillet, Edwin C., The Story of Canadian Roads, University of Toronto Press, Toronto, 1967 The operation of cars on the newly paved roads in a snowy climate necessitated the use of a technology for keeping roads clear for cars in winter. Municipalities and provinces acquired snowplows, fleets of trucks with steel blades attached to the front bumper to clear city and provincial roads. The use of crushed rock salt for melting snow and ice on roads was also introduced during this period. The technique was effective but unfortunately proved to be very corrosive to steel and concrete. This had serious consequences for the undercarriage of the steel vehicles that used the roads in winter as well as the roads themselves along with bridges and parking lots. The popularity of the car in urban areas also lead to the introduction of the parking meter in the centre of most urban areas. Invented in the US in 1935 it progressively found its way onto city streets across Canada in the years that followed. The car began to compete with the streetcar in the thirties and forties and many cities reduced or abandoned this service. New suburbs were built without streetcar lines and urban diesel powered buses were used to provide public transport. Only a handful of cities continued to maintain streetcar service into the fifties and beyond, most notably Toronto which to this day has a very elaborate public streetcar network. The auto-craze gave rise to a booming do-it-yourself car maintenance and repair movement with businesses specializing in car parts and tools becoming popular. One of the notable firm in this field, the familiar, Canadian Tire, began operations in Toronto in 1922 and has become one of Canada's largest retailers. Long distance travel by aircraft became increasingly important and practical in the postwar years. Taking off in a Vickers Vimy IV bomber from Lester's Field in St. Johns, Newfoundland on 14 June 1919, John Alcock and Arthur Whitten Brown, (Alcock and Brown) made the first trans-Atlantic flight, crash landing in Ireland 16 hours later. The first cross-Canada flight began in Halifax on 7 October 1920 and ended in Vancouver ten days later. In the twenties and thirties the Canadian north was developed with the help of hundreds of small float equipped \\"bush planes\\" used to fly men and supplies to mining, forestry, trapping and fishing camps. The first commercial air passenger flight in Canada was made in 1920, when two bush pilots flew a fur buyer from Winnipeg to The Pas, Manitoba. National passenger air service was introduced by Trans- Canada Airlines beginning in 1937 and Canadian Pacific Airlines starting in 1942. Of note was the attempt by Britain to establish an airship service between that country and Canada and a related test flight by the British built dirigible the R-100 was made in July 1930. After a successful crossing of the Atlantic the giant craft moored at a mast especially constructed for that purpose at St. Hubert near Montreal. The ship flew on to Toronto before finally returning to Britain. However, technical problems with the craft prevented further flights and the idea of a Trans-Atlantic lighter-than-air passenger service was abandoned. To facilitate the development of a national aviation service the Government of Canada created a kind of national highway in the sky called the Trans-Canada Airway consisting of airports, radio and weather services and lighting for night flying, at various locations across Canada. Construction started in 1929 but was slowed by the depression. The western leg from Vancouver to Winnipeg was completed in 1938. The section from Winnipeg to Toronto and Montreal was inaugurated in 1939 and the extensions to Moncton, Halifax and St. John's completed in 1940, 1941 and 1942 respectively.Milberry, Larry, Aviation in Canada, McGraw-Hill Ryerson, Toronto, 1979 Communications, radio In 1901, Guglielmo Marconi sent radio signals across the Atlantic Ocean. He established a machine to produce electromagnetic waves at Cornwall in England and a machine to detect these waves at Signal Hill in St. John's Newfoundland. On 12 December 1901 he announced that he had received the transmission of waves sent by the transmitter in England at the station in St John's.Babaian, Sharon, A., Radio Communication in Canada : An Historical and Technological Survey, The Transformation Series, No. 1, National Museum of Science and Technology, Ottawa, Canada, 1992, p. 11. In Montreal, in 1920, XWA (CINW (AM)) became the first commercial AM radio broadcaster in the world. Both the AM transmitter and receiver used analog technology. The following year CKAC became the first French- language AM radio broadcaster in Canada. State operated national radio broadcasting chains were established beginning in the late 1920s, including the CNR National Radio Network, 1927, the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission Radio Network, 1932 and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation Radio Network, 1936. Private independent AM broadcast operations sprouted like mushrooms in cities large and small across Canada during the thirties and forties. Canadian Marconi Company (CMC Electronics) formed in Montreal in 1903 and Northern Electric, manufactured radios for home use, the first mass- produced electronic equipment in Canada. The circuits of these devises were based on analog technology. The teleprinter became a popular technology with telegraph companies beginning in 1922. When used with the telegraph system it permitted the automated printing of thousands of telegraph messages and became the backbone of the telegram service offered by the Canadian National Telegraph Company formed in 1920 and the Canadian Pacific Telegraph Company.Collins, Robert, A Voice from Afar, McGraw-Hill Ryerson, Toronto, 1977, p. 192 The wirephoto, was introduced in the US by Associated Press in 1935. This technology permitted the transmission of a photograph by use of telephone wires and became widely used by newspapers for reporting purposes. The technology was quickly introduced to Canada by Canadian Press (1917), which provided the service to newspapers across the country. Canadian Press also became the exclusive provider of Canadian wirephotos for Associated Press. The Canadian film industry experienced mixed success during the twenties and thirties. Film maker Ernest Shipman produced five features between 1920 and 1923 before meeting with financial failure. The successful Canadian-owned Allen Theatre chain attained an important place in the exhibition market before being taken over by Famous Players Canadian Corporation (Cineplex Entertainment) in 1923. The technology of the talking cinema or \\"talkies\\" was introduced to Canada in 1927 by that company to take advantage of the arrival of talking films produced in Hollywood. The first Canadian \\"talkie\\" was \\"The Viking\\", an adventure story about sealing off the coast of Newfoundland, produced in 1931. Associated Screen News of Canada in Montreal produced two notable newsreel series, \\"Kinograms\\" in the twenties and \\"Canadian Cameo\\" from 1932 to 1953. The regular production of short films by the newly created Canadian Government Motion Picture Bureau began in the 1930s. British law encouraging filmmaking in the Commonwealth led Hollywood to circumvent the spirit of the concept by establishing film production companies to make American films in Calgary, Toronto, Montreal and Victoria. These companies produced a small number of features but closed operations when the British law was changed to exclude their films. In 1941, Odeon Theatres of Canada opened a new cinema chain to compete with Famous Players. The making of documentary films grew tremendously during World War II with the creation of the National Film Board of Canada in 1939. By 1945 it was one of the major film production studios in the world with a staff of nearly 800 and over 500 films to its credit, including the very popular The World in Action and Canada Carries On series of monthly propaganda films. Materials Plastics were also introduced during these years. In Toronto, Plastics Ltd. began to produce Bakelite soon after its invention in 1909. Another firm, Canadian Electro Products of Shawinigan, Quebec, invented polyvinyl acetate which was used in copolymer resins and water-based paints. The wartime production of nitrocellulose naturally led to the manufacture at Shawinigan in 1932, of transparent cellulose film used for packaging. What is now called fibreglass was invented in the US in 1938 at Owens-Corning by Russell Games Slayter and introduced to Canada shortly thereafter.Warrington, Newbold, Chemical Canada: Past and Present, The Chemical Institute of Canada, Ottawa, 1970 Aluminum also became popular. In 1902, attracted by the availability of cheap hydro power, the Aluminum Company of America established a Canadian subsidiary, the Northern Aluminum Company (Alcan) at Shawinigan Falls, Quebec to produce that metal using the electrolysis technique. Corporate changes led to the creation of the Aluminum Company of Canada (Alcan) in 1925 and in 1926 the company constructed a giant aluminum smelter at a place it named Arvida, Quebec. Once again the site was chosen for the availability of cheap hydro electricity and the proximity of a deep-water port at Bagotville for large ships carrying bauxite or aluminum ore. World War II accelerated the demand for aluminum, which was the principal material in aircraft production and the Arvida facility was greatly expanded. In 1958 another huge Alcan smelter was built at Kitimat, British Columbia. The growth in popularity of the car also created a need for rubber for automobile tires. Accelerated by the emergency of World War II, a substantial synthetic rubber production industry was established at Sarnia, Ontario in the early forties. The oil refineries there provided a ready source of raw materials. In particular, the Suspensiod crackers operated there by Imperial Oil produced large quantities of hydrocarbon gases. These were used by a new Crown enterprise, Polymer Corporation created in 1942, and associated private companies, St. Clair Processing Corporation Ltd., Dow Chemical of Canada Ltd., and Canadian Synthetic Rubber Ltd., itself a subsidiary of four Canadian rubber companies, Dominion, Firestone, Goodyear and Goodrich, to produce both GR-S and butyl type synthetic rubber. Initially production was destined for wartime use on military vehicles but in postwar years output was quickly redirected to civilian automobile production. The closely related synthetic textile industry appeared in the years just after the First War. The production of artificial silk, more properly known as viscose rayon, made from bleached wood pulp, began in Cornwall, Ontario in 1925, in a factory built by Courtaulds (Canada). A year later Celanese Canada began making acetate yarn in a new plant in Drummondville, Quebec. DuPont Canada was the first to manufacture nylon yarn in Canada at its factory in Kingston, Ontario in 1942. This secret material was initially used for parachutes but following the war was used to make nylon stockings. Asbestos has long been known for its fibrous and heat resistant properties. With the rise of the automobile, asbestos became an important material, being used to make brakes. The world's largest asbestos mine, the Jeffrey Mine in Asbestos, Quebec had its beginnings in the 1878 when a local farmer W. H. Jeffrey began to mine the substance there. Original mining methods were primitive and involved blasting, the use of chisels to remove the mineral from the rock by hand and a crane powered by one horse. By 1895, 2300 tons of asbestos were being removed from the open pit mine per year. The mine was purchased by the Johns-Manville Company of the US in 1918 and has since become the largest asbestos mine in the world, over two kilometres in diameter and 350 metres deep. The material was used for insulation in buildings and ships and, of course, for automobile brakes. However, serious health problems, including lung cancer, have been associated with its mining and use, and in recent years mining activity there has diminished.Joan Kuyek, Asbestos Mining in Canada: A brief presented to the International Ban Asbestos Conference, Ottawa, September 13, 2003, MiningWatch Canada Industry With the rail building era coming to an end, the rise of the automotive industry in southern Ontario provided the Hamilton steel mills of the Steel Company of Canada and the Dominion Foundries and Steel Company with a new market. Dofasco introduced the basic oxygen steelmaking at its mills in Hamilton in 1954. In the latter part of the century, Algoma, in Sault Ste. Marie, built coke oven batteries and blast furnaces, while phasing out the open-hearth and Bessemer steel-making process in favour of the basic oxygen steel-making. The industrial production of bread became notable during these years. At the beginning of the 20th century it is estimated that only about 8% of Canadian wives bought bread commercially. However, the industrial production of bread grew impressively and by the 1960s, 95% of homemakers purchased bread commercially. One bakery of note, The Canada Bread Company Limited, was founded in 1911 as the result of the amalgamation of five smaller companies. Industrial bakeries such as this were characterized by the use of large machines for the mixing of dough, which was placed in pans on slow moving conveyor belts that transported them through giant ovens, where they were baked. Large automated packaging machines wrapped the finished loaves at great speed. Improvements in transportation and packaging technology throughout the decades allowed a shrinking number of bakeries to serve every larger markets. In 1939 there were about 3200 commercial bakeries across the country but by 1973 the figure stood at 1700, while in 1981 there were 1400. Meat packing grew to become Canada's most important food processing industry during this period. In Calgary, Alberta, in 1890, Pat Burns established P. Burns and Company, which became the largest meat processor in western Canada. In Toronto in 1896 the innovative Harris Abattoir was established to export chilled sides of beef to the British market. The industry grew rapidly during the war, supplying meat to Canadian and British troops overseas. However, it underwent a period of consolidation in the twenties due to a loss of markets. This led to the merger of two major players, William Davies and the Harris Abattoir, to form Canada Packers in Toronto. By 1930, \\"The Big Three\\", meat packers in Canada were Canada Packers, Swift Canadian and P.Burns and Company in Calgary, Alberta. The increasing popularity of the electric refrigerator in Canadian restaurants and homes made it practical for manufacturers to make available various frozen foods. The first such offering, a frozen strawberry pack was produced in Montreal and Ottawa beginning in 1932 by Heeney Frosted Foods Ltd. Consumer technology Cold breakfast cereal became increasingly popular during these years. Wheat and later corn flakes were developed in the US by the Kellogg brothers in 1894 and the Kellogg Company was formed in 1906. In London, Ontario the Canadian Corn Company purchased the rights to manufacture and distribute Toasted Corn Flakes for Canadian distribution. In 1924 the American Kellogg Company purchased the London operation and formed Kellogg Canada Inc. Since that time the company has manufactured and distributed in Canada a wide variety of breakfast cereals including Corn Flakes, 1907, Bran Flakes, 1915, All Bran, 1916 and Rice Krispies, 1928. Although neither the tin can nor soups were remarkable in any way in the thirties, the combination of the two in the form of the well known Campbell's soup was very popular. The Campbell Soup Company introduced its soup products to Canada in 1930, making them at its factory in Toronto on the lake shore. Instant coffee was another tasty innovation introduced during these years. The inventor and world leader in the manufacture of instant coffee, the Swiss-based Nestlé Company began operations in Canada with the production of canned condensed milk at its plant, The Maple Leaf Condensed Milk Company, in Chesterville, Ontario in 1918. Head office research invented instant coffee and began selling it around the world including Canada, as Nescafe in 1938. It became hugely popular with allied troops during World War II. In 1952 the instant chocolate drink, Nestle Quik, was introduced to Canada. The sanitary napkin and Kleenex brand facial tissue were introduced in the 1920s. Kimberly, Clark and Co. (Kimberly Clark) formed in the US in 1872, invented cellucotton in 1914. It used this material as the basis for a sanitary napkin and marketed the product as Kotex beginning in 1920. Kleenex, initially intended for the removal of face cream, was introduced in 1924. In 1925 the company formed what would become, Canadian Cellucotton Products Limited, for the marketing of these and other products in Canada and internationally. The first practical electric razor, the Sunbeam \\"Shavemaster\\" and the Remington \\"Close Shaver\\" made available in the US in 1937 and in Canada shortly thereafter. With a base of caustic soda, the world's first oven cleaner, Easy-Off, was invented in Regina in 1932 by Herbert McCool and manufactured in his home in that city until 1946, when production shifted to Iberville, Quebec. The product has since become the most popular oven cleaner in the world.  Architecture  The grand hotel continued to make a mark with new structures, including the Bigwinn Inn, Muskoka, Ontario, 1920, the Jasper Park Lodge, Jasper, Alberta, 1922, the Hotel Newfoundland, St. John's, Newfoundland, 1926, the Hotel Saskatchewan, Regina, Saskatchewan, 1927, the Prince of Wales Hotel, Waterton Lakes National Park, Alberta, 1927, the Lord Nelson Hotel, Halifax, Nova Scotia, 1928, The Pines, Digby, Nova Scotia, 1929, the Royal York Hotel, Toronto, 1929, the Chateau Montebello, Montebello, Quebec, 1930, the Nova Scotian Hotel, Halifax, Nova Scotia, 1930, the Charlottetown Hotel, Charlottetown, P.E.I. and the Bessborough Hotel, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, 1935. In 1875 in Montreal, a McGill student, J. Creighton, established the basic rules for hockey as we know it today. The world's first facility dedicated to hockey, the Westmount Arena was built in Montreal in 1898 while the first industrial refrigeration equipment for making artificial ice in Canada was installed in 1911 by Frank and Lester Patrick for their new arenas in Vancouver and Victoria. The Mutual Street Arena, with its artificial ice surface, was built in Toronto in 1912. With the development of wide span roof structures the construction of large indoor ice rink stadiums became possible. These two technologies were used to build the Montreal Forum, home of the legendary Montreal Canadiens hockey team, in Montreal in 1924 and Maple Leaf Gardens home of the Toronto Maple Leafs, in that city in 1931. Baseball's facilities were upgraded with construction of the new Maple Leaf Stadium on Lake Shore Boulevard in Toronto in 1926 and the De Lormier Downs Stadium (Hector Racine Stadium), in Montreal in 1927. Civic Stadium, now Ivor Wynne Stadium, was built in Hamilton, Ontario in 1930, to host the British Empire Games held there that year. The construction of the very large, Basilica of Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré, near Quebec city was completed in 1926. There were also advances in the lighting of public, commercial and industrial buildings. In 1938, after decades of development in the US and Europe, General Electric in the US, and shortly thereafter Westinghouse, began to sell the fluorescent lamp. Because of its lower power consumption its use was quickly adopted for large-scale applications. These lights were quickly made available to the Canadian market through the Canadian subsidiaries of these two companies. Civil engineering and public works Notable engineering works of the period included the Second Narrows Bridge, Vancouver, 1925, the R.C. Harris Filtration Plant, Toronto, Ontario, 1926, the Peace Bridge, Fort Erie, Ontario, 1927, the Champlain Bridge (Ottawa), 1928, the Ocean Terminals, Halifax, Nova Scotia, 1928, Sea Island Airport (Vancouver International Airport), Vancouver, 1929, the Ambassador Bridge, Windsor-Detroit, 1929, the Windsor-Detroit Tunnel, 1930, the Broadway Bridge, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, 1932, the Île d'Orléans Bridge, near Quebec City, 1934, the Thousand Islands Bridge, Ontario, 1937, the Pattullo Bridge, Vancouver, 1937, the Lion's Gate Bridge, Vancouver, British Columbia, 1938, Malton Airport (Toronto Pearson International Airport), Toronto, 1938, the Blue Water Bridge, Sarnia, Ontario, 1938, the Queen Elizabeth Way, Ontario, 1939, the Rainbow Bridge (Niagara Falls), 1941, Dorval Airport, (Montréal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport), Montreal, 1941 and the Alaska Highway, Dawson Creek, British Columbia, 1942. Canada's first major roller coaster the Crystal Beach Cyclone was built at the Crystal Beach Amusement park in 1927. It quickly gained a reputation for its wild and even violent ride and one passenger, Amos Wiedrich was killed in 1938 when he stood up to take off his coat while the coaster was in motion. The dump truck and bulldozer were introduced during these years for a variety of earth moving tasks including road building and canal construction. The dump truck was invented in Saint John, New Brunswick in 1920 by Robert T. Mawhinney and the bulldozer was developed in the US in 1923. Both quickly became popular worldwide. Medicine Medical treatment benefited from the introduction of the electrocardiograph, used to diagnose heart problems, in large hospitals in the late twenties. There were also important innovations with respect to the treatment of epilepsy during this period. In Montreal, Dr. Wilder Penfield, with a grant from the US Rockefeller Foundation, founded the Montreal Neurological Institute at the Royal Victoria Hospital (Montreal), in 1934 to study and treat epilepsy and other neurological diseases. Defence and nuclear technology The military suffered a huge decline in the 1920s and 1930s. The Royal Canadian Air Force founded in 1924, was largely a bush and float plane operation. Only in the 1930s did it acquire a modest combat capability with a handful of British Armstrong Whitworth Siskin fighters and a squadron of Hawker Hurricane fighters as the clouds of war grew menacing. The Royal Canadian Navy, perpetually starved for equipment acquired its first custom-built ships, the destroyers HMCS Saguenay (D79) and HMCS Skeena (D59) on May 22, 1931. In 1929 the army began to retire its horses and was issued four 6-wheeled Leyland tractors in 1929, to tow its 60-pound guns. Four 3-inch 20-cwt. anti-aircraft guns were taken on strength in 1937. As a reflection of this intense and diverse engineering activity, the Canadian Council of Professional Engineers was established in 1936. This organization was renamed Engineers Canada in 2007. Canada was involved in the wartime Manhattan Project to build an atomic bomb, including the Montreal Laboratory for nuclear research by scientists from Britain, and American contracts with Canadian firms Eldorado Gold Mines for mining and processing uranium and a heavy water plant built by Consolidated Mining and Smelting (CMS) at Trail, British Columbia.  The Television Age (1950–1980)  The years following World War II introduced even more innovations, including television, the transistor radio, synthetic fabrics, plastic, computers, super highways, shopping centres, atomic energy, nuclear weapons, transcontinental energy pipelines, long range electric transmission, transcontinental microwave networks, fast food, chemical fertilizer, insecticides, the birth control pill, jet aircraft, cable TV, colour TV, the instant replay, the audio cartridge and audio cassette, satellite communications and continental air defence systems. Communications (television and the transistor radio) In the early 1980s Canadian Satellite Communications (Cancom) assembled a package of Canadian and American television channels which it offered to remote communities throughout the northern regions of Canada. The signals were distributed by Anik satellite and made available to the local populace through cable. By the later part of the decade several hundred communities were using this service.Weir, E. Austin, The Struggle for National Broadcasting in Canada, McClelland & Stewart, Toronto, 1965. There was also technological innovation in the telephone system. The first trans-Atlantic telephone cable, jointly owned by the Canadian Overseas Telecommunication Corporation, British Post Office and AT&T;, was brought into service in 1956, paving the way for telephone calls from Canada to Britain and Europe. An improved cable, CANTAT was installed in 1961. A similar service on the west coast, COMPAC, the Commonwealth Pacific Cable System was inaugurated in 1963, linking Canada by undersea telephone cable with New Zealand and Australia. CN/CP Telecommunications introduced the well known Telex service to Canada in 1956. Direct distance dialing was initiated in Canada in 1958, beginning with customers in Toronto and on 1 July of that year the Trans-Canada Microwave system, known as the Trans-Canada Skyway, went into service.Collins, Robert, A Voice from Afar: The History of Telecommunications in Canada, McGraw-Hill Ryerson, 1977, pp. 292–295. The concept and operation of a dedicated emergency telephone number originated in Canada, where the City of Winnipeg established the world's first 9-1-1 service in 1959. The service eventually spread and was offered continent wide. Communications (satellites) The Anik (satellite) series of communications satellites initially built by Hughes Aircraft and operated by Telesat Canada starting in 1972 formed the basis of the world's first domestic satellite communications service. Telesat has launched a large number of satellites including, Anik A1 - 1972, Anik A2 - 1973, Anik A3 - 1975, Anik B - 1978, Anik D1 - 1982, Anik C3 - 1982, Anik C2 - 1983, Anik D2 - 1984, Anik C1 - 1985, Anik E2 - 1991, Anik E1 - 1991, MSAT - 1996, Nimiq 1 - 1999, Anik F1 - 2000, Nimiq 2 - 2002, Anik F2 - 2004, Anik F1R - 2005, and Anik F3 - 2007. \\"Dataroute\\", the world's first national digital data system was introduced by CN/CP in 1973. Nuclear weapons After considerable political turmoil Canada acquired nuclear weapons from the Americans under a \\"dual key\\" arrangement on 1 January 1963. Genie air-to-air rockets armed with atomic warheads were based at RCAF Stations Comox, British Columbia, Bagotville, Quebec, and Chatham, New Brunswick, as the primary weapon for the newly acquired CF-101 interceptor. The nuclear armed BOMARC (Boeing Michigan Air Research Corporation) anti-aircraft missile was based at RCAF Stations North Bay, Ontario, and Lamacaza, Quebec. In Germany, as part of Canada's NATO commitment, nuclear free-fall bombs were acquired for the RCAF CF-104 strike fighter and the Canadian Army in Germany took possession of a battery of Honest John surface-to-surface battlefield rockets armed with nuclear warheads. By 1984 all these atomic weapons had been returned to the United States. While there were no accidents involving nuclear weapons in Canadian hands, there were at least two involving USAF aircraft flying in Canadian airspace. On 14 February 1950 a USAF B-36 heavy bomber, serial 44-92075, carrying one Mark 4 (Fat Man type) atomic bomb experienced multiple engine failures while flying south off the coast of British Columbia and jettisoned the bomb over Squally Channel. The crew bailed out and the plane flew on autopilot for another 330 km before crashing on a mountainside in the Kispiox Valley. In eastern Canada on 10 November 1950, a USAF B-50 heavy bomber, serial 46-038, flying from Goose Bay, Labrador, to the United States, experienced engine trouble and in accordance with standard operating procedures, jettisoned the Mark 4 atomic bomb it was carrying over the St. Lawrence River, near Rivière-du-Loup. The bomb's own 2200 kg conventional explosives blew it apart before it hit the water. The plane flew on to a base in the US.Clearwater, John, Canadian Nuclear Weapons: The Untold Story of Canada's Cold War Arsenal, Dundurn, Press, 1998  Computers Computers were introduced in a variety of areas at this time. The National Research Council Canada experimented with fire-control computers towards the end of the war. The University of Toronto Computer Centre, established in 1947, developed Canada's first operational computer the University of Toronto Electronic Computer (UTEC) in 1951. This was followed by the purchase of FERUT (Ferranti University of Toronto) computer, by the Computer Centre in 1952.Eggleston, Wilfred, National Research in Canada: The NRC 1916–1966, Clarke Irwin, Toronto, 1978, pp 412–418. The NRC used this computer in the early fifties for the hydrographic modeling of the St. Lawrence Seaway then under construction. Computers were also developed by other organizations, including the National Research Council, the NRC Computer (1954–1960), Ferranti Canada, mail sorter (1955), Computing Devices of Canada, the \\"Kicksorter\\" (1957–1963), the Defence Research Board, the DRTE (1960) and Sperry Canada, UMAC-5 (1962). Avro Canada in Toronto worked unsuccessfully to develop the fire-control computer for the Velvet Glove air-to-air missile for the highly advanced but ill-fated Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow interceptor. Avro Canada made extensive use of computers in calculations for aircraft design and manufacturing processes, including CNC. Other military developers included the Royal Canadian Navy with its DATAR system for the command and control of warships. In the 1950s the Pinetree, Mid-Canada and DEW Line air-defence radar chains built across Canada relied heavily on computers. Certainly the largest and most powerful computer in Canada at the time was the IBM/USAF developed AN/FSQ-7, installed in the late 1950s, underground at RCAF Station North Bay, as the \\"brain\\" of the DEW Line System. The machine contained 55,000 vacuum tubes, weighed 275 tons and occupied a half-acre of floor space. It could perform 75,000 instructions per second. By 1958 there were 41 computers in operation in Canada with big business, universities or the military. The most popular was the IBM 650, which was used by 19 organizations, including Canadair Limited, Canadian General Electric, Ford Motor Company of Canada, Great West Life Assurance Company, Imperial Oil Limited, Orenda Engines Limited and the University of Toronto. Other models in use included the Bendix G-15, 4, the ALWAC III-E, 3, the IBM 705, 3, the UNIVAC II, 3, the Datatron 205, 2, the LGP-30, 2, the Borroughs E 101, 1, the IBM 704, 1, and the NRC 102A/D.Stachniak, Zbigniew, Campbell, Scott C., Computing in Canada, Transformation Series, No. 17, Canada Science and Technology Museum2009, p. 36. One of the first commercial users of computers was Trans-Canada Airlines (TCA). In 1961 Ferranti-Packard developed the ReserVec computer reservation system for TCA (now Air Canada). This formed the basis for the Ferranti-Packard 6000 computer, and in 1963 two were sold in Canada, one to the Defence Research Establishment Atlantic, in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia and the other to the Toronto Stock Exchange. In 1961 the Royal Bank of Canada was the first bank in Canada to introduce computers for its operations, followed by the Toronto-Dominion Bank in 1962. It was soon followed by the other large Canadian banks, including the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Bank of Nova Scotia. When they introduced the credit card about the same time these records were kept on large central computers as well. It was this experience with large computer systems linking hundreds of branch offices across the country that enabled the banks to introduce the ATM and the debit card, across Canada in the 1980s. Computers were also introduced to control complex industrial processes. Interprovincial Pipe Line Limited of Edmonton was one of the first Canadian companies to employ computers as a means of controlling the flow of gas in its very large pipeline system. Atomic Energy of Canada Limited used computers to control atomic fission in its power reactors. In 1977 the Toronto Stock Exchange became the first stock market in the world convert to electronic trading with the introduction of its Computer Assisted Trading System. Twenty years later, in 1997, the exchange closed its trading floor and converted to a fully automated, computer-driven trading system. Computers were also recognized as a tool for policing. The Canadian Police Information Centre which was established in 1966 under the auspices of the RCMP, has operated, since that date, a national computer data base that provides information relating to criminal activity in Canada.Canadian Police Information Centre www.cpic-cipc.ca/English/index.cfm During this period Canada Post applied computer readable codes to speed the delivery of mail. On 1 April 1971 the postal code system was introduced. The technique involved the use of a six-character geographic code placed on the envelope or parcel by the sender. The code was in turn machine scanned by a computer-driven optical reader that signaled the sorting equipment to direct the item to the proper destination. While technically effective, the introduction of the system lead to serious labour trouble at Canada Post for several years by unionized workers who were afraid of pay cuts or job loss (Postal codes in Canada). Transportation In transportation, several significant works were completed, including the Toronto Subway, 1954, the Trans-Canada Gas Pipeline, 1958, the St. Lawrence Seaway, 1959, Trans-Canada Highway, completed in 1962, the Montreal Subway, 1966, GO Transit, Toronto area, 1967 and Highway 401, Ontario, completed in 1968. On August 10, 1949, the Avro Canada C102 Jetliner, a mid-range four-engine passenger jet, made its first flight, just 13 days after the world's first and eight years before the US's first, the Boeing 707. Trans-Canada Airlines (later Air Canada) and Canadian Pacific Airlines introduced jet passenger service with the de Havilland Comet, DC-8, DC9, B727 and B-737. The B-747 was introduced by these companies in the early seventies. In the sixties and early seventies De Havilland Aircraft of Canada in Toronto developed the DHC-7 Dash 7 and DHC-8 Dash 8 STOL aircraft. These were used to provide passenger service to small city centre airports in Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal. A number of international carriers also acquired these aircraft to provide similar services elsewhere in the world. The first Canadian owned helicopter began operation in Canada on 12 March 1947. On that date Photographic Survey Corporation took possession of a Bell Bell 47B-3, registration CF-FJA.Milberry, Larry, Aviation in Canada, McGraw-Hill Ryerson, Toronto, 1979, p.242. The development of trans-oceanic aviation in the postwar years created a need for accurate weather information over the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. An international agreement in 1946 established 13 Ocean Weather Stations with Canada being responsible for two, ocean station Baker several hundred miles off the east coast from 1947 to 1950 and for ocean station Papa off the coast of Vancouver from 1950 to 1981. A number of ships, both converted RCN vessels and purpose built CCG weather ships were stationed at these points to gather weather information during these years. Ships involved included, HMCS St. Stephen, HMCS St. Catherines, HMCS Stone Town, CCGS Vancouver, and CCGS Quadra. Of note was the transit of the Northwest Passage in 1954 by HMCS Labrador, Canada's first purpose built icebreaker, which was acquired that same year, in service with the Royal Canadian Navy. Of particular significance was the conversion from steam to diesel by Canada's two great railways. Beginning in the mid fifties the CPR and Canadian National Railways began replacing their steam locomotives with diesel locomotives. By 1960 the conversion was mostly complete. The Volkswagen was introduced to Canadians in 1952 and became very popular with drivers who wanted greater fuel economy than that provided by the larger cars then on the market. It was sold in Canada until 1977. The seat belt became a standard feature of domestic passenger cars in the late sixties. The catalytic converter was also introduced during these years. The first devices, designed to reduce air pollution from automobile exhaust, were installed in the 1975 model year for US cars manufactured in Canada. Because of environmental concerns and the fact that it was not compatible with these converters, the major gasoline companies in Canada began to eliminate the sale of leaded gasoline that same year. Although Armand Bombardier invented the snowmobile, the initial production model, the B-7 dating from 1937 was a large 7 passenger vehicle. It was not until 1959 with the development of the small gas engine that the individual snowmobile or Ski-doo was produced by Bombardier (Bombardier Recreational Products) in the company factory at Valcourt, Quebec. A number of competitors in Canada and elsewhere entered the market and sales of snowmobiles skyrocketed with 2 million being sold worldwide between 1970 and 1973. To this day, snowmobiles remain popular in Canada and other regions with snowy winters. Pedestrian walkways have become important features of some Canadian cities. Climate controlled underground passageways and shopping malls have been features of the downtown cores of Toronto (PATH (Toronto)) and Montreal (Underground City, Montreal) since the mid-sixties. Arguable the most unusual, is the Plus 15 system in downtown Calgary. Initiated in 1970 it presently consists of 57 bridges and 16 km of enclosed climate controlled passageways suspended above ground level which permit pedestrians to walk anywhere in the downtown core summer or winter without ever going outside. Atomic energy Beginning in the mid-1950s nuclear-generated electricity was developed under a partnership of industry and government at both the federal and provincial levels. A demonstration power reactor, the NPD was built at Rolphton, Ontario in 1962, followed by a commercial-scale CANDU prototype at Douglas Point in 1968. In 1971 electricity became commercially available from the large (ultimately 8-unit) Pickering station near Toronto, Ontario and, starting in 1977, the Bruce station (ultimately 8-units as well), near Kinkardine, Ontario. These were followed by the Gentilly-2 Atomic Electric Plant, Trois- Rivières, Quebec and the Point Lepreau Atomic Electric Plant, Point Lepreau, New Brunswick both in 1982. The electric current supplied by commercial hydro companies to consumers was changed and organizations like Hydro Ontario converted from 25 cycles to 60 cycles during the ten-year period from 1949 to 1959.Eggleston, Wilfred, Canada's Nuclear Story, Clarke Irwin, Toronto, 1965 The introduction of this technology was not without mishap. On 12 December 1952 the experimental NRX reactor at Chalk River suffered a failure of its cooling system and underwent a partial meltdown. On May 24, 1958, the newly commissioned NRU reactor also a Chalk River experienced a major accident when one of the uranium filled fuel rods caught fire and seriously contaminated the reactor building with radioactive debris. Energy (oil and gas) The modern era of oil production in Canada began in 1947 when Imperial made its major discovery at Leduc, Alberta. The availability of oil and gas in Alberta, a half continent away from central Canada provided the impetus for the construction of two huge transcontinental pipelines to the eastern Canadian market. The crude oil pipeline was the first to be built. The construction of first section of the Interprovincial Pipeline from Edmonton to Regina to Superior Wisconsin in the US began in 1950 and was completed in an astonishing 150 days. In 1953 the pipeline was extended through the US to Sarnia, Ontario and from Sarnia to Toronto in 1957. At the time of its completion it was the longest pipeline in the world. The oil and gasoline industry has grown tremendously since then, mainly to meet the demand for gasoline created by the popularity of the car and for home heating oil. Major oil refineries have been built in Vancouver, British Columbia, Edmonton, Alberta, Sarnia, Ontario, Montreal, Quebec and Saint John, New Brunswick. The construction of the transcontinental oil pipeline was followed by that of the gas carrying Trans- Canada pipeline. Work began in 1956 at the Alberta/Saskatchewan border advancing to Regina, Winnipeg and Port Arthur, Ontario in 1957. Construction was not without mishap as during a pressure test in 1957 five kilometres of pipe blew up near Dryden, Ontario. The line crossed the very technically difficult Canadian Shield north of Lake Superior and reached Toronto and Montreal in 1958. At the time of its completion it was the longest pipeline in the world. Political controversies related to the construction of the pipeline contributed to the fall of the St. Laurent Liberal government in 1957. Gas pipelines were also built in Alberta, the largest being that of Alberta Gas Trunk Lines, incorporated in 1954 and British Columbia, where the Westcoast Transmission Co. system was completed in 1957. While large pipelines carried natural gas across the continent smaller distribution systems were necessary to carry gas into factories and individual homes, where it was used as a source of heat. Very complex local understreet pipeline networks were constructed in cities across Canada to meet this requirement. Other energy projects of the period included the Lakeview Generating Station, Mississauga, Ontario, 1962, the W.A.C.Bennett (hydro) Dam, British Columbia, 1967, the Gardiner (hydro) Dam, Saskatchewan, 1968, the Churchill Falls Hydro Dam, Labrador, 1971, the Nanticoke Generating Station (largest coal-fired plant in North America), Nanticoke, Ontario, 1978 and La Grande 2 Hydro Dam, Quebec, 1979. The energy crisis of 1973 had domestic repercussions with many consumers taking steps to reduce energy costs through the installation of improved home insulation and wood-burning stoves. The existence in Alberta of large quantities of surface bitumen (oil) mixed with sand has been known for many years. In the late 1970s the commercial production of synthetic crude oil from this bitumen began near Fort McMurray. Construction at this site, by a company known as Syncrude, began in 1973 and the first crude oil was produced there in 1978. The complex and costly production process involves scraping the sticky bitumen-laden sand from the surface, transporting it to a processing facility, removing the sand from the bitumen and upgrading the bitumen to a product known as light sweet crude. The technical scale of the operation is very large. Initially the sandy tar-like bitumen was scrapped from the ground using gigantic powered rotating mechanical wheels equipped with scraping buckets and the oil sand was placed on conveyor belts for transport to the processing plant. However, the severely cold Albert winters caused the continuous breakdown of the machinery and a new technique was developed. This involves the use of gigantic power shovels and dumptrucks to deliver the bitumen laden sand to the processing plant. Once at the plant the bitumen is removed from the sand with a process that involves the use of hot water. The bitumen is then subjected to fluid coking, hydroprocessing, hydrotreating and reblending. Syncrude is the largest producer of synthetic crude oil from bitumen sand in the world and the largest producer of oil from a single site in Canada.Web site, Canadian Oil Sands Trust, Annual Report, 2008 Industry The forestry industry underwent a notable process of mechanization in the postwar years. The most visible change was the introduction of the chain saw. When originally developed for modern use in the 1920s, this heavy, gasoline engine- driven machine required two men for its operation. However, improvements in engine technology eventually made the saw small and light enough to be operated easily by one person. In 1944 one of the first industrial users, Bloedel Stewart and Welch Ltd. in British Columbia had 112 chain saws in operation, but their use accounted for only a small part of total forestry tree cutting. In 1950 less than one percent of pulpwood in Canada was cut with chain saws. However, by 1955 this figure had grown to more than 50%. Other machines were also introduced during this period. The first feller buncher was used by the Quebec North Shore Paper Company in 1957. Hydraulic tree shears were first used in 1966 by the Abitibi Pulp and Paper Company Limited (Abitibi-Consolidated). Snowmobiles and tracked machines replaced animals for the hauling of logs. In 1948 several Bombardier machines were employed to this end by the Ste. Anne Power Company Limited in Quebec. In 1959 Timberland Machines of Woodstock, Ontario developed the Timberbuncher, a self-propelled machine which could move through the forest, cut a whole tree at its base (a process known as full tree harvesting) and, using a hydraulic arm, place it into a pile for hauling. Machines that stripped the branches from felled trees, a process known as delimbing, were also introduced at this time. With the help of these technologies, the Canadian pulp and paper industry grew to become one of the major suppliers of newsprint in the world through the operations of companies such as MacMillan Bloedel Limited, Repap Enterprises Inc., Kruger Inc., Great Lakes Forest Products Ltd, British Columbia Forest Products Ltd., Consolidated-Bathurst Inc., Canadian Forest Products Ltd., CIP Inc., Domtar Pulp & Paper Products Group and Abitibi Consolidated. The use of pesticides was a prominent feature of postwar agriculture across Canada. Insecticides based on fluorine, arsenic, rotenone, nicotine pyrethrum as well as herbicides using sulphuric acid, arsenites and salt and finally fungicides based on sulphur, mercury or copper have been very effective in controlling life forms that degrade agricultural output. At the same time these compounds have also had a negative effect beyond their intended sphere of use. DDT was registered for use in Canada from 1946 until 1985, when its use was banned. The product was never manufactured in Canada. Food irradiation, in particular the irradiation of potatoes to prevent sprouting while in storage, was approved for use in Canada in 1960. Potash-based chemical fertilizer became an important element of increased agricultural production in Canada and around the world in the postwar era. In Saskatchewan techniques were introduced for the mining of the huge potash deposits found there. These involve both \\"dry\\" and \\"wet\\", methods of mining. The dry method involves the sinking of a vertical shaft and the use of large powered cutting machines to cut into the potash horizontally. The wet technique known as solution mining is used to access potash at greater depths. This involves drilling a vertical hole into the deposit into which is pumped hot water. The liquid dissolves the potash underground and then returns to the surface, where another process separates the mineral from the water.web site, Western Potash Corp. www.westernpotash.com. Office automation Business administration underwent technological change. The ball point pen was marketed in the US in October 1945 and in Canada shortly thereafter. The IBM Selectric typewriter, introduced in 1961, quickly became popular with businesses in Canada, as did the Xerox photocopier in the 1960s. Medicine There was important progress in medical technology during this period. In 1945 Dr. Stuart Stanbury established a National Blood Transfusion Programme for the Canadian Red Cross Society, thus making available to those in need, a dependable source of blood for medical purposes. The associated test for blood typing was introduced at the same time. Blood tests would become increasingly sophisticated in the coming years. The electroencephalograph, used for the diagnosis of neurological disorders was introduced in major Canadian medical institutions in the late forties. The techniques for the mass production and distribution of vaccines and for the mass public inoculation were introduced during these years. Polio was a disease that affected large numbers of Canadian children during the first part of the 20th century. In the US, research by Dr. Jonas Salk in the late 1940s led to the discovery of vaccine for the prevention of this disease. However, there was no technique for volume manufacture of the drug. Connaught Laboratories of Toronto developed a synthetic culture known as \\"medium 199\\", which enabled the mass production of this polio vaccine beginning in 1952. A successful all-Canadian mass inoculation of children using the new vaccine was undertaken in the spring of 1955, the first such mass public health campaign of its type in Canada.Rutty, Christopher J., Connaught and the Canadian Polio Vaccine Story, CONNTACT, Vol. 9, No. 3 June 1996. Antibiotics such as penicillin were quickly made available to the general public in the postwar years. There was also progress with respect to the treatment of heart disease. The pacemaker invented with significant Canadian participation was used to treat patients with arrhythmia. For more serious problems open heart surgery became an option for patients and permitted the repair of faulty heart valves, the clearing of blocked coronary arteries and the resolution of other problems. Canada's first heart transplant was performed on 31 May 1968, by Dr. Pierre Godin the Chief Surgeon at the Montreal Heart Institute, on patient Albert Murphy of Chomedy, Quebec a 59-year-old retired butcher suffering from degenerative heart disease. The operation took place about six months after the world's first, by Dr. Christian Barnard.Web site, CBC Digital Archives, www.archives.cbc.ca/on_this_day/05/31/. Neurosurgery was introduced in a substantive way in the 1960s. Cancer patients were provided with a new option, radiation therapy, through what was popularly known as the \\"Cobalt Bomb\\", again developed with important Canadian input. The use of radio isotopes for diagnostics was also introduced. Chemotherapy also became a treatment option. In 1960 the use of a subcutaneous arteriovenous shunt along with the artificial kidney machine allowed hemodialysis for patients with chronic renal failure. During these years the Montreal Neurological Institute pioneered the development of medical imaging technologies introducing Canada's first CAT scan in 1973, PET scan in 1975 and MRI in 1982. The technique of medical ultrasonography also became widely available beginning in the late 1960s and was especially popular with expectant mothers interested in the health and sex of their fetus. The number of these machines in use has grown greatly over the years. In 2004 there were about 150 MRI units and about 350 CAT units in use in Canada.Press Release CIHI, \\"CIHI report shows increase in MRI and CT scanners, up more than 75% in the last decade.\\" Medical Imaging in Canada, 2004 The corneal contact lenses first developed in 1949 gained mass appeal in Canada and elsewhere in the 1960s. Made of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) they could be worn up to 16 hours a day. Developments in orthodontics made the straightening of the teeth of children with \\"braces\\" commonplace. Children were also often on the receiving end of the tonsillectomy a fashionable surgical procedure during these years. The surgical replacement of body parts also became possible and was used to treat ailing kidneys and joints such as knees and hips. The availability of cosmetic implants became popular during these years. In 1962, in the US, Dow Corning developed the silicone gel-filled breast implant which was used by women for surgical breast augmentation. The procedure was common in Canada. In recent years implants containing saline solution have also become popular. Pharmaceuticals attained a high-profile. The availability of the birth control pill in 1960 made it possible for women to protect themselves from unwanted pregnancy. Stress could be treated with tranquilizers, such as valium, introduced in 1963. The consumption of vitamins became widespread and supplements were added to staple foods such as milk and bread and were taken in pill form. While most of these drugs were safe, one, thalidomide, had horrific consequences for its users. Thalidomide was invented in West Germany in 1954 by Chemie Grunenthal as a sedative. It was noted that the drug was particularly effective in treating the symptoms of morning sickness associated with pregnancy. The drug was made available under prescription to Canadians beginning 1 April 1961. Tragically it was discovered that the drug caused miscarriage and severe birth defects. As a result, the drug was withdrawn from the Canadian market on 2 March 1962.web site, www.thalidomide.ca, Thalidomide Victims Association of Canada, The \\"recreational\\" use of \\"soft drugs\\" such a marijuana, LSD and hashish became part of the 1960s counter culture. Marijuana was often produced locally using the hydroponic method. Domestic and consumer technology (in the home) The car, cheap gasoline and postwar affluence created boom conditions for the expansion of suburbia. Several standard designs for the single family home on a standard lot were reproduced cookie-cutter style row-upon-row in cities across Canada as subdivision after subdivision sprang up radiating from the central core. The designs were thoroughly modern, reflecting the optimism of the era, usually with a peaked roof, asphalt shingles and a brick or wood siding exterior and included a living room, kitchen and occasionally dining room and two, three or four bedrooms and a full basement made of poured concrete or cinder block. Floors were usually made of varnished hardwood planks and the walls and ceilings of gyprock. Copper piping brought running water from the serviced street and copper wiring electricity from the rear lot line. Clay tile pipe carried the sewage from the flush, sit toilet to the main sewer line running under the street. There was usually a driveway beside the house for the family car, and less frequently a carport or garage. Most homes were equipped with a telephone often with a \\"party\\" line but these became rare by the 1960s. A television set was also common in almost all homes by the end of the 1950s and the record player gave way to the hi-fi stereo. Almost all kitchens were equipped with electric refrigerators and electric or less commonly gas, stoves. Where there was gas it was usually piped to the home through a main line running under the street. There were a variety of electrical \\"labour saving\\" devices including electrical mixers can openers and carving knives. Central heating was a standard feature and coal, delivered to the home by a diesel powered truck, was the dominant fuel source in the early postwar years. However, as the 1950s progressed coal gave way to oil and gas heating. Home furnishings were almost all mass-produced and made from wood, fabric and various types of stuffing for cushions. In the kitchen metal chrome tube chairs and formica topped tables were popular. The small front and back yard were maintained with the help of a gasoline-powered lawn mower, and the hedge and bushes were trimmed with electric clippers. In the early 1960s the high-rise apartment building began to make its appearance in large cities. The self-supporting steel structures were usually seven stories or more, and large buildings contained hundreds of dwelling units. Initially they were especially visible along Highway 401 in Toronto, Metropolitan Boulevard in Montreal and the north shore of English Bay in Vancouver. Their construction was possible due to the introduction of the high-rise crane, which to this day remains a common feature of city skylines. The arrival of television had an effect on eating habits. In 1953, C.A. Swanson & Sons introduced the TV dinner to the US market. The pre-cooked food items, including, meat, potatoes and a vegetable were placed in the segments of an aluminum tray and frozen. The consumer purchased the frozen product and heated it in the oven for about 25 minutes. It could be eaten out of the tray. In 1960, Swanson, a subsidiary of the Campbell Soup Company, built a factory in Listowel, Ontario to manufacture TV dinners and other Campbell frozen products for the Canadian market. The electric toothbrush introduced in 1959 has become very popular in Canada since the 1990s. The steel aerosol spray can with the gas propellant, and \\"crimp on nozzle\\" was developed in the US in 1949. It quickly became a favored type of packaging in Canada for a number of products including whipped cream, deodorant, bug spray and hair spray. The gas propellant, usually a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), became a target for environmental concern in the 1970s when research demonstrated that it had a harmful effect on the ozone layer in the atmosphere. The international Montreal Protocol of 1989 banned the use of these substances and they were subsequently replaced with volatile hydrocarbons. The disposable diaper was introduced to the Canadian market in 1972 by Procter & Gamble Canada Ltd. The chemistry of hair colouring was introduced to the domestic scene in the US and Canada in 1956, when Clairol began marketing a home hair colouring kit for women that could be purchased for a modest price at a local pharmacy or grocery store. Invented in Canada, the green plastic garbage bag (Bin bag) was introduced to Canadians in the late 1960s. Patented in 1955 by Swiss engineer, George de Mestral, velcro, a two sided fastening technology based on hooks and loops, was introduced to a number of countries, including Canada, in the late 1950s. In Montreal, Velek Ltd. acquired the exclusive marketing rights for velcro in North and South America and Japan. The format for sound recordings changed in the years just following the war. In the US, Columbia Records introduced the long playing (LP) 33 format in 1948. Columbia made an agreement with Sparton Records, of London, Ontario, established in 1930, for the manufacture and distribution of its LP records in Canada. Not to be caught short, RCA Victor in the US responded in 1949 with its own technological innovation the 45 rpm record (with the big hole in the centre) and manufactured and distributed this new format for the Canadian market through its Canadian subsidiary, RCA Victor of Canada, established in Montreal in 1929. The video home system (VHS) released in 1976 by Victor Company of Japan, Limited (JVC), quickly became popular in Canada and was used to record TV programmes or to play VHS tapes of Hollywood movies that could be rented in neighborhood video stores that soon became a common feature of suburban strip malls. In 2003 the popularity of DVD surpassed VHS and by 2006 the technology had become obsolete. The introduction of the credit card complimented the appearance of the shopping mall. In 1968 a number of Canadian banks including the Bank of Nova Scotia, the Royal Bank of Canada, the Toronto-Dominion Bank and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce began issuing the Chargex credit card to customers. In 1977 these cards were reissued by the same banks under the VISA brand name. The MasterCard credit card became available to Canadians in 1973. Domestic and consumer technology (in the Suburbs) The booming growth of the suburbs led to the appearance of the shopping mall, a low-rise steel frame, commercial structure housing a number of retail outlets and surrounded by acres of asphalt parking lot for large numbers of cars. The first in Canada included the Norgate Shopping Centre, Saint-Laurent, Quebec, 1949, the Dorval Shopping Centre, Dorval, Quebec, 1950, the Park Royal Shopping Centre, West Vancouver, British Columbia, 1950, the Sunnybrook Plaza, Toronto, 1951 and York Mills, Toronto, 1952. The hospitality industry was similarly affected and fast food drive-in restaurants began to appear. In 1951 the first St. Hubert BBQ restaurant opened its doors on St-Hubert street in Montreal. A&W; opened its first Canadian operation in Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1957. In 1959 Harvey's opened its first eatery on Yonge Street in Richmond Hill. In Hamilton, Ontario, the first Tim Hortons restaurant opened in 1964. The first McDonald's restaurant outside the United States was opened in Richmond, British Columbia in 1967 and Pizza Delight was founded in Shediac, New Brunswick, in 1968. Cinema attendance boomed after the war and with it innovations in cinema design. The first double-screen cinema, The Elgin, opened its doors in Ottawa in 1946 and the drive-in cinema became popular after the war. However, the long cold Canadian winters discouraged the widespread diffusion of this type of film exhibition. The dramatic IMAX large-scale cinema format was invented as the result of developments in cinematic technology during Expo '67 in Montreal. The world's first permanent Imax cinema, Cinesphere, was built at Ontario Place in Toronto in 1971. Others were built in Vancouver for Expo '86 and at the Canadian Museum of Civilization in Gatineau, Quebec, in 1989. By 1995 there were 129 Imax cinemas entertaining audiences around the world. The audio cartridge and audio cassette became popular in the early 1970s with the cassette eventually winning the battle of the formats. This compact medium led to the appearance of high quality in-car sound systems. The New Woodbine Racetrack for thoroughbred horse racing opened to the public in Toronto in 1956 (simply Woodbine after 1963) replacing the original Woodbine which was built in 1874. Canada's first purpose-built auto racing track, the Westwood Motorsport Park was built in Coquitlam, British Columbia in 1959. The Mosport International Raceway, north of Bowmanville, Ontario opened to the public in 1961 and hosted the Canadian Grand Prix Formula 1 races from 1967 to 1977. La Ronde became Canada's largest amusement park when it opened in 1967 as part of Expo '67 in Montreal. It is popular to this day for a number of roller coasters, including The Boomerang, Cobra, Goliath, Le Monstre and Vampire. Materials Detergent, a replacement for soap, introduced in the postwar years, was used to keep clothes and dishes clean through the action of its active ingredient, tetrapropylene, a derivative of petroleum. The popular Tide brand became available in 1948. In 1964 permanent press fabrics were invented in the US by Ruth Rogan Benerito, a scientist at the Physical Chemistry Research Group of the Cotton Chemical Reactions Laboratory and introduced to Canada shortly thereafter. The press resulted from the treatment of the fabric with formaldehyde. Invented by DuPont scientist Dr. Roy J. Plunkett in 1938, polytetrafluoroethylene, a polymer considered the world's most slippery substance, was introduced commercially as Teflon, in 1946 in the US. It is used in a wide variety of applications, including as a non-stick coating on the cooking surface of pots and pans and is manufactured in Canada by DuPont in Mississauga, Ontario. Krazy Glue (ethyl cyanoacrylate) was introduced to Canada in 1973. Waste disposal and sewage treatment In the postwar years Canadian municipalities began treating raw sewage, which up to that time, with a few notable exceptions, had been allowed to flow directly from their sewer systems into nearby streams, rivers, lakes and oceans. New facilities were added in Toronto including the Highland Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant in 1956 and the Humber Wastewater Treatment Plant in 1960. Vancouver built a number of sewage treatment facilities including the Lions Gate Wastewater Treatment Plant in 1961, the Iona Island Wastewater Treatment Plant in 1963 and the Lulu Island Wastewater Treatment Plant in 1973. The City of Ottawa built the Green's Creek Pollution Control Center (now Robert O. Pickard Environmental Centre) in 1961. In 1970 the City of Montreal began the construction of a large sewer network which channeled all effluent to the treatment plant at Rivière-des-Prairies on the east end of the island and became operational in 1996. By 1980, 64% of Canadians were served by sewage treatment, with the figure rising to 78% in 1997.Web site, OECD, www.environmentalindicators.com/htdocs/indicators/7muni.htm Public and industrial concern with air pollution and acid rain led to measures being taken by a number of companies to cut back on harmful atmospheric emissions. In 1972, Inco undertook steps to reduce emissions of SO2 and other gases by installing scrubbers and a chimney at its Copper Cliff smelter in Ontario.Web site, Vale Inco, www.inco.com/business/history/# Public works and civil engineering  Bridges of note included the Angus L. Macdonald Bridge in Halifax 1954, the Oak Street Bridge, Vancouver, 1957, the Burlington Bay James N. Allan Skyway, 1958, Ogdensburg-Prescott International Bridge, 1960, the Queensborough Bridge, Vancouver 1960, the Sault Ste. Marie International Bridge, Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, 1962, the Champlain Bridge, Montreal, 1962, the Lewiston-Queenston Bridge, Niagara Falls, Ontario, 1962, the Port Mann Bridge, Vancouver, 1964, the Macdonald-Cartier Bridge, Ottawa, 1965, the Pont de la Concorde (Montreal), 1966, the Prince Edward Viaduct, Toronto 1966, the Laviolette Bridge, Trois-Rivières, Quebec, 1967, the Saint John Harbour Bridge, Saint John, New Brunswick, 1968, the Dinsmore Bridge, Vancouver, 1969, the A. Murray McKay Bridge, Halifax, 1970, the Pierre Laporte Bridge, Quebec City, 1970, the Portage Bridge, Ottawa, 1973 and the Arthur Laing Bridge, Vancouver, 1976. This was also an era of gigantism, and there were both successes and failures. Beginning in 1963, massive civil engineering works were undertaken in the St. Lawrence River in Montreal to build the site for the 1967 World's Fair, known as Expo 67. The gigantic Red River Floodway, which opened in 1968, was designed to carry flood water from a rising Red River around the heart of the City of Winnipeg. It was completed in 1968 and proved successful when used for the first time in 1969. At the time of its completion it was the second largest earth-moving project in the world, after the Panama Canal. Northwest of Montreal thousands of acres of fertile farmland were expropriated to build the huge new Mirabel International Airport, which opened in 1975. The facility was to be linked to the heart of Montreal with a fast train. The train was never built and both passengers and air carriers stayed away in droves. The site eventually became a quiet industrial airport, home to the production facilities for Bombardier regional jets. On the other hand, the James Bay Project undertaken in Quebec at the same time was a booming success. Several large dams on the La Grande River with their associated long distance transmission lines provide Hydro-Québec with an important source of electricity. The CN Tower, the world's tallest free- standing structure, was constructed in Toronto in 1975. Architecture Important skyscrapers, including Place Ville Marie (Royal Bank), Montreal, 1962, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce Tower, Montreal, 1962, the Edifice Trust Royal (C.I.L. House), Montreal, 1962, the Toronto Dominion Bank Tower, Toronto, 1967, The Simpson Tower, Toronto, 1968, the Hôtel Château Champlain, Montreal, 1967, the Royal Trust Tower, Toronto, 1969, Royal Centre, Vancouver, 1972, Inco Superstack, Sudbury, Ontario, 1972, First Canadian Place, Toronto, 1975, Harbour Centre, Vancouver, 1976, the Complexe Desjardins, la Tour du Sud, Montreal, 1976, the Scotia Tower, Calgary, 1976, the Scotia Tower, Vancouver, 1977, Royal Bank Plaza, South Tower, Toronto, 1977 and the First Bank Tower, Toronto, 1979, represented significant architectural achievements during this period. The massive Saint Joseph's Oratory, the largest church in Canada, the construction of which began in 1924, was completed in 1967 on the north slope of Mont Royal in Montreal. Notable large sports facilities included, Empire Stadium, Vancouver, 1954, McMahon Stadium, Calgary, Alberta, 1960, the Montreal Automobile Stadium (Autostad) 1966, the Olympic Stadium, Montreal, 1976 and Commonwealth Stadium (Edmonton), 1978.  The PC Age (1980–2000)  Microelectronics became a part of everyday life during this period. The personal computer became a feature of most homes, and the microchip found its way into a bewildering variety of products from cars to washing machines. The microchip and digital computing In 1977 the first commercially produced personal computers were invented in the US: the Apple II, the PET 2001 and the TRS-80. They were quickly made available in Canada. In 1980 IBM introduced the IBM PC. Microsoft provided the operating system, through IBM, where it was referred to as PC DOS and as a stand-alone product known as MS-DOS. This created a rivalry for personal computer operating systems, Apple and Microsoft, which endures to this day. A large variety of special-use software and applications have been developed for use with these operating systems. There have also been a multiplicity of hardware manufacturers which have produced a wide variety of personal computers, and the heart of these machines, the central processing unit, has increased in speed and capacity by leaps and bounds. There were 1,560,000 personal computers in Canada by 1987, of which 650,000 were in homes, 610,000 in businesses and 300,000 in educational institutions. Canadian producers of micro-computers included Sidus Systems, 3D Microcomputers, Seanix Technology and MDG Computers. Of note is the fact that these machines were based on digital technology, and their widespread and rapid introduction to Canada at the same time that the telephone system was undergoing a similar transformation would herald an era of rapid technological advance in the field of communication and computing. The laptop computer also appeared during these years and achieved notable popularity in Canada beginning in the 1990s. In 1981 the first commercially available portable computer, the Osborne 1, became available. Other models followed, including the Kaypro II in 1982, the popular Compaq Portable and Tandy Corporation TRS-80 Model 100 both in 1983, the IBM PC Convertible, 1986, the Macintosh Portable, 1989 and Power Book, 1991. The latter models in particular were popular with both professionals and consumers. In the 1970s and 1980s word processing, a method for \\"typing\\" documents using a keyboard linked to a computer and a video screen, was developed. Early machines were dedicated exclusively to this function and a notable Canadian contribution, the Superplus IV, produced by AES Data in Montreal in 1981, became widely popular. However, the rise of the personal computer and the invention of PC-compatible word processing software, such as WordPerfect in 1982 and Microsoft Word in 1983, made stand-alone word processors obsolete. Spreadsheet software also became popular for accounting purposes, notably Microsoft Excel, which was also introduced to the world and Canadian market in 1983. These new machines with their new software quickly dominated the market and became an almost universal feature of any Canadian office. Supercomputers In 1987 there were considerable numbers of larger computers in Canada, including 25,000 mainframe and mini-computers. But the most powerful of all were the supercomputers. The Meteorological Service of Canada has been a noted user of large computers and has pioneered the Canadian use of supercomputers. Machines used have included the Bendix G20, 1962, an IBM 360-95 scientific mainframe computer, 1967, its first supercomputer a CDC 7600 from Control Data Corporation, 1973, a Cray 1S supercomputer, 1983, a NEC supercomputer, 1993 and an IBM supercomputer in 2003. At the time of its installation this latter machine was the most powerful computer in Canada. The Communications Security Establishment (CSE), Canada's \\"electronic spy\\" agency has been a notable user of supercomputers. CSE code breaking capabilities degraded substantially in the 1960s and 1970s but were upgraded with the acquisition of a Cray X-MP/11 (modified) supercomputer delivered to the Sir Leonard Tilley Building in Ottawa, in March 1985. It was, at the time, the most powerful computer in Canada. In the early 1990s, the Establishment purchased a Floating Point Systems FPS 522-EA supercomputer at a cost of $1,620,371. This machine was upgraded to a Cray S-MP superserver after Cray acquired Floating Point Systems in December 1991 and used the Folklore Operating System supplied by the NSA in the US.http://luxexumbra.blogspot.com/2008_06_01_archive.html These machines are now retired. Little information is available on the types of computers used by the CSEC since then. However, Cray in the US has produced a number of improved supercomputers since then. These include the Cray SX-6, early 2000s, the Cray X1, 2003 (development funded in part by the NSA), Cray XD1, 2004, Cray XT3, Cray XT4, 2006, Cray XMt, 2006 and Cray CX1, 2008. It is possible that some of these models have been used by the CSEC and are in use today. In 2008, Canada's most powerful research computer, an IBM supercomputer, was installed in Toronto. The $20 million machine, about the size of an SUV, can make 12.5 trillion computations per second and will be used for proteomics research by the Ontario Cancer Institute, the Princess Margaret Hospital (specializing in cancer) and the University Health Network. An IBM System x iData Plex supercomputer began operation at the University of Toronto in 2009.Omar el Akkad, Monster Computer Roars to Life, The Globe and Mail, 18 June 2009, p. A1. However, the supercomputer used by Environment Canada for weather forecasting remains the largest in Canada. Communications: digitization and fibre optics Canada's major telephone companies introduced digital technology and fibre optics during this period paving the way for more advanced business and customer telecommunications services. In 1976 Nortel developed the first digital private branch exchange (PBX) in the world. That same year Nortel announced its \\"Digital World\\" project, which foresaw the development and market introduction of a complete family of digital switching, transmission and business communications systems. In 1977 Bell Canada began to conduct a fibre optic field trial to residential customers in Montreal. The Manitoba Telephone System began to introduce fibre optics in that province beginning with customers in Elie, in 1981. In 1984 Sasktel, the provincially owned telephone company in Saskatchewan, completed the construction of a 3,268 km. long commercial fibre optics network to fifty-two communities in that province. In 1984 CNCP Telecommunications began the construction of a trans- Canada fibre optic network. By 2009, the national fibre optic system in Canada stretched 7000 kilometers across the country and included underwater fibre links to PEI (1985) and Newfoundland. Eight fibres are reserved for Trans- Canada traffic. On 1 July 1985, Cantel and Bell Cellular began to offer cell phone service in Canada. They used a technical standard known as CDMA, which was compatible with mobile phone systems in the US but not elsewhere in the world. The fax began to make its presence felt in offices across Canada in the early 1980s. The Globe and Mail began to produce its contents in electronic form in 1979. A year later in 1980, in order to enable the daily distribution of the Toronto-based paper across the country, in a bid to become Canada's \\"national newspaper\\", it began the transmission of its contents via Anik Satellite to regional offices, where it was printed and distributed.http://www.globelink.ca/about/history/ Bluetooth technology, developed in 1994 by Ericsson, was introduced to Canadian consumers at that time. The technique permits the very short range radio communication of Bluetooth equipped electronic devices with each other for the purposes of information transfer. It is designed to eliminate the need for wires and cables to connect such machines. Lasers The use of lasers became common throughout Canada during these years. The devices are usually found as components of larger systems. Lasers are used in the field of telecommunications, where they are act as the modulated light sources for fibre optic systems. The high frequency of the pulsed beams of light they produce enables the transmission of large quantities of information and the absence of an electromagnetic field around the fiber optic cable lessens transmission loss and increases the security of the data. Lasers are also used in many mechanical manufacturing systems to start and stop processes, measure component size and monitor and maintain quality. In public they are commonly found at the retail checkout counter, where they scan bar codes. They are also used to open and close doors for people and cars and are common in public washrooms, where they control the flow of water for taps and the flushing of urinals and toilettes. Their use in medicine has been growing. They are used to \\"burn\\" plaque from clogged arteries, to remove the decayed portion of teeth in dental treatment and to treat vision problems related to retinal detachment and near sightedness (lasik surgery). The Lidar, a laser-based instrument, is used by meteorologists to determine the height of the cloud base. Transportation Smaller vehicles became popular in response to the oil crisis of 1973. In 1981 the Chrysler K platform introduced by that company formed the basis for the compact K-car. Front wheel drive was widely introduced to North America by the Big Three US automakers beginning in 1978, when the Plymouth Horizon and Dodge Omni, both with transverse mounted engines, became available. A wide variety of front wheel-drive-models were quickly offered to Canadians by other car makers. The air bag safety feature was introduced during these years. In the US, the 1973 model Oldsmobile Toronado was the first passenger car equipped with an air bag. Ford introduced air bags as an option in the Tempo in the US in 1984 and Crysler made them a standard feature in 1988. Air bags were made available in the Canadian market as this feature became available in US models. The semi-trailer truck (18 wheeler), became the dominant vehicle on the heavily used Highway 401 (Ontario). Containerization, which had made headway in ocean shipping with the construction of terminals in Halifax, Montreal and Vancouver also led to the eventual elimination of the railway box car and began to make inroads in the trucking industry. Light rail systems were built in Edmonton, Alberta in 1978, Calgary, Alberta, in 1981 and Vancouver, British Columbia in 1986. The Ontario Highway 407 Express Toll Road (ETR), opened in Toronto in 1997 to ease the burden of traffic on Highway 401 which passes through the heart of the city to the south. Special technology is used to collect tolls without the use to toll booths. Regular users can equip their cars with a transponder that sends a signal to highway sensors when the vehicle enters and leaves the road. For those vehicles without a transponder, special electro-optical sensors read the number plate and a bill for the toll is sent to the vehicle owner in the mail. In 1996 GM Canada introduced the OnStar service to Canadian and US customers who chose this option when purchasing a new car. Considered a safety feature, the service provides emergency services, vehicle diagnostics and directions to drivers on the road. It is based on GPS technology as well as CDMA mobile phone technology provided in Canada by Bell Mobility. There is a 24-hour emergency response centre in Oshawa for vehicles located in Canada. In the 1990s, a national weather radar surveillance system for aviation and general use was established. The initial system, the Canadian weather radar network, established by Environment Canada, became operational in 1997 and consisted of 18 weather radars using the 5 centimetre wavelength (C-Band) and one using the ten-centimeter wavelength (S-Band). In 1998 that organization received approval to add another 12 radars and to upgrade the system to the Pulse- Doppler radar standard. Also in 1997 the responsibility for air traffic control in Canada was transferred from Transport Canada to Nav Canada. The very large and complex control system operated by that organization uses a number of technologies, including 1400 ground-based navigation aids, 46 radars and six Automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast systems, which are based on global positioning technology. Technological improvements have also enhanced rail safety during these years. These include a large number of incremental changes to elements of rolling stock including wheels, axles, trucks, couplers and brakes. There have also been improvements to tracks including continuous weld, concrete sleepers and switching techniques. Techniques of traffic control and communication have also been improved.Rail Safety Technologies, Transport Canada, Rail Safety Act Review Secretariat, July 2007 Industry Bombardier's invention of a new class of aircraft, the regional jet or RJ, allowed airlines to introduce jet passenger service to smaller centres. The design of this machine was facilitated through the use of computer-aided design software. In 2009, Bombardier Aerospace of Montreal, in cooperation with the National Research Council Canada began using robots for the assembly of its aircraft. Factory farming of pigs and chickens in particular became a prominent feature of agriculture during these years. Large numbers of these animals are crowded into very large barns with controlled environments in an effort to maximize their growth and hence profit for the farmer. The use of antibiotics to fight infection, as well as the use of growth hormones is common. The growth in the number of these farms has been dramatic. The Fraser Valley in British Columbia is home to the highest concentration of such farms in Canada and the number of farms there increased from 56 in 1991 to 146 in 2001. The growth of genetically modified crops also became common. One of the most notable in this regard is canola. Developed in Canada from rapeseed during the 1970s by Keith Downey and Baldur Stefansson it is used to produce oil that is low in erucic acid and glucosinolate and has become a major cash crop in North America. A strain of canola with additional modification that made it resistant to herbicide was introduced in Canada in 1996. Robotics The use of computer-controlled robots in manufacturing (computer-aided manufacturing) as well as the closely associated, just-in-time inventory management technique, were pioneered in Canada by the auto manufacturers, who introduced them to improve efficiency. They were put to use in new auto manufacturing plants built, by Honda Canada in Alliston, Ontario and Toyota Canada in Cambridge, Ontario (1988). The techniques of robotic assembly-line manufacturing have improved over the years. As of 2009 robots form the basis for automobile production in Canada with a number of facilities and companies using this technology, including (city, company, model): * Alliston, Ontario; Honda, Acura CSX, Acura MDX, Civic; * Oshawa, Ontario, General Motors, Camaro, Chevrolet Impala; * Ingersoll, Ontario, General Motors (CAMI - GM Suzike), Chevrolet Equinox, GMC Terrain; * Brampton, Ontario, Chrysler, Chrysler 300, Dodge Challenger, Dodge Charger; * Windsor, Ontario, Chrysler/Volkswagen, Chrysler Town and Country, Dodge Grand Caravan, Volkswagen Routan; * Oakville, Ontario, Ford, Edge, Grand Marquis, Lincoln MKX; * Cambridge, Ontario, Toyota, Matrix, Corolla, Lexus RX; * St. Thomas, Ontario, Ford, Crown Victoria, Lincoln Town Car and * Woodstock, Ontario, Toyota, RAV4. Space technology: earth observation and geomatics Geomatics, a term that originated in Canada, is a technique of computer-based mapping that integrates information from a variety of sources including, cartography, remote sensing (including images from RADARSAT), surveying, global satellite navigation systems, geodesy and photogrammetry. In the new century it has become an important tool used by Canadians in a variety of endeavours including, commerce, the environment, search and rescue, urban planning, defence and natural resource management among other things. The Geomatics Industry Association of Canada, founded in 1988, presently has a membership of more than 100 organizations. During these years Canada's unmanned space programme included the first launching of a Canadian earth observation satellite, RADARSAT-1 in 1995 and an improved version RADARSAT-2 in 2007. Placed in polar orbits each of these satellites images almost the Earth's entire surface, every 24 days using a powerful synthetic aperture radar, SAR. The images have both operational and scientific applications and their data is of use in geology, hydrology, agriculture, cartography, forestry, climatology, urbanology, environmental studies, meteorology, oceanography and other fields. In 2009 the Canadian Space Agency announced a follow-up programme, RADARSAT Constellation, which will see the launching of three earth observation satellites, in 2014, 2015 and 2016 respectively, working as a trio to provide complete coverage of Canada's land and ocean surfaces as well as 95% of the surface of the world every 24 hours. Energy, offshore oil and gas The technology for offshore oil and gas extraction was introduced to Canada during these years. The first of several projects off of Canada's east coast was the massive Hibernia platform, a gravity base structure (GBS), built in Bull Arm, Newfoundland in the early 1990s. The 1.2 million ton structure was towed into place, 315 km to the south east of St. John's, Newfoundland, over the Hibernia off-shore oil reservoir, where it was positioned resting on the ocean floor in 80 meters of water with its superstructure rising 50 meters above the surface of the sea. In 1997 the facility began to pump oil from the sea bottom. The oil is stored in giant on- board tanks and continuously off-loaded by a fleet of dedicated shuttle tankers which transport it to the shore-based oil refinery at Come-by-Chance, Newfoundland. The nearby Terra Nova, 350 km off shore, began to produce oil in 2002. The platform itself rests on the ocean floor and pumps oil from the sea bottom. However, unlike the Hibernia facility, the oil flows directly into a Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) vessel, the Terra Nova FPSO, where it is processed and stored. The oil in the storage tanks is then removed by a shuttle tanker. A third oil production facility in the same area, the White Rose (oil field), operated by Husky Petroleum, which began operation in 2005 also uses a Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) vessel, the SeaRose FPSO. Undersea pipelines, the first in Canada and part of the Sable Offshore Energy Project have been introduced to transport gas from undersea wells off the coast of Nova Scotia since 2000. Gas was discovered near Sable Island in 1979 with the first platform and well head installed in the Thebaud field in 1999. An on-shore gas treatment facility was built at Goldboro and connected to the wellhead with a 225 km long undersea pipeline and production began in 2000. Other fields have been connected via undersea pipeline including the North Triumph, Venture, Alma and South Venture. Other notable energy works included, the ill-fated east coast Ocean Ranger drilling platform, which sank in a storm in 1982 with the loss of all aboard, the Nova Scotia Power Corporation tidal generating station, Annapolis, 1984 and the Darlington Nuclear Generating Station, Darlington, Ontario, 1990. The construction of large-scale hydro-electric plants far from electric markets lead to the introduction of techniques for long distance electric power transmission. These techniques were used at a number of sites, including the W.A.C Bennett hydro station in British Columbia in 1968, Churchill Falls, Labrador, 1971 and the Robert-Bourassa generating station, 1981, the La Grande-3 generating station, 1984, the La Grande-4 generating station, 1986 and the La Grande-2-A generating station, 1992, all in Quebec. Biotechnology Biotechnology involves modifying living organisms to serve human goals. Biological techniques are derived from a number of sciences including, biology, chemistry, organic chemistry, biochemistry, genetics, botany, zoology, microbiology and embryology to name a few. In 1987, a number of Canadian companies and university research organizations operating in the field of biotechnology established the Industrial Biotechnology Association of Canada, also known as BIOTECanada. In 2005, the industry consisted of companies offering biotechnologically based services and products in the following sectors: human health (262 firms), agriculture (89 firms), food processing (54 firms), environment (33 firms), bioinformatics (16 firms), natural resources (21 firms) and aquaculture (15 firms).Biotechnology in Canada: A Technology Platform for Growth, Conference Board of Canada, Decemober 2005 As of 2010 BIOTECanada had more than 250 members. In 2005 noted bio-medical spenders on biotechnological research (research spending in millions of C$) included, Apotex Inc. (151.1), Pfizer Canada Inc. (147.5), GlaxoSmithKline Inc. (111.8), Merck Frosst Canada Ltd. (96.6), Biovail Corporation (88.9), AstraZeneca Canada Inc. (79.8) and Sanofi Pasteur Limited (76.6).RESEARCH, Canada's Top 100 Corporate R&D; List, Infosource Inc. 2006 (2/2007) Another product of biotechnology, genetically modified crops, are grown throughout Canada. One of the most widely known, canola was developed in Canada through selective breeding in 1974. Canola oil is used in food products and in non-food items such as lipstick, candles, bio-fuels and newspaper ink. One of the largest suppliers of genetically modified seeds for food crops and animal feed in Canada is Monsanto Canada, established in Winnipeg in 1901. Medicine Medical treatment advanced during these years. The use of lasers and computers became important parts of medical treatment. Computers were essential in the development of new medical imaging devices such as the CAT scan, positron emission tomography and the MRI. Minimally invasive surgery, also known as laparoscopic surgery, reduced surgical damage to patients. Lasers were used with catheters for clearing blocked arteries and catheters with small cameras provided images of conditions inside the body. Coronary bypass surgery became commonplace. Laser eye surgery became popular in the 1990s and was used to improve visual acuity for the near-sighted. New chemical chemotherapy combinations helped prolong the lives of cancer patients. Techniques for the long-term application of medication through the use of a skin patch or implants appeared during these years. A large number of medical drugs (List of bestselling drugs) for treating a wide variety of ailments such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, arthritis, allergies, anemia, depression, asthma, osteoporosis and diabetes, became available to Canadians during this period. The techniques for blood collection, processing and transfusion came under severe criticism in Canada during the 1980s, and led to Canada's worst-ever public health crisis. Between 1980 and 1985, 2000 recipients of tainted blood provided by the Canadian Red Cross were infected with the HI virus. Between 1980 and 1990, 30,000 Canadian transfusion recipients were infected with hepatitis C from tainted blood. About 8000 of those who received bad blood have died or are expected to die as a result. An investigation known as the Royal Commission of Inquiry on the Blood System in Canada was launched in 1993 and issued its final report in 1997. A private company, IVF Canada of Scarborough, was the first to begin offering in vitro fertilization (IVF) in Canada beginning in 1983. Since that date the company has recorded a number of Canadian \\"firsts\\" in this field, including the first IVF pregnancy, first IVF twins, the first IVF triplets and the first baby born from a frozen embryo.web site, IVF Canada, www.ivfcanada.com Beginning in 1998 male erectile difficulties could be treated with the use of Viagra and other medications. Domestic and consumer technology There were innovations in home design and construction during this period. Houses generally became bigger. New materials such as vinyl siding became common and often replaced more expensive brick for home exteriors. The car port and garage became widespread features and the latter was often located close to the curb, creating a rather crowded streetscape. The home dishwasher and the microwave oven were introduced. Large-screen televisions usually of the cathode ray or projection type were found in many homes. The Sony Walkman, introduced in 1979, quickly gained popularity as a means for listening to music on the go. There were innovations in the field of domestic cuisine including the introduction of microwave popcorn. In 1981, the development of the susceptor bag (a paper bag impregnated with an aluminum- coated polyester film), allowed popcorn therein to be popped in a microwave oven without scorching. The compact disc (CD) and the digital video disc (DVD) were introduced at this time. The CD, which appeared in 1982, became a favourite format for musical recordings. By 1986 most music stores in Canada had phased out the LP and replaced it with the CD. It was also used for other purposes including data storage in the form of the CD-ROM. A closely related format, the DVD, with greater storage capacity than the CD, was introduced in 1997. In 1986, Americ Disc of Drummondville, Quebec began to manufacture CDs and after 1997, DVDs and has become one of the largest suppliers of this product in North America. The infrared-based TV remote control became popular with Canadians in the early 1980s. Video games have become a wildly popular form of entertainment especially for youth, since the 1980s. The earliest video game dated from 1947 and a number of devices were produced in the 1950s and 1960s. However, it was the development of the computer chip that led to their popularization. The coin-operated arcade game Pong introduced by Atari in 1972 was the first to become widely available. The next phase of development included the introduction in the mid-1970s of the home console, first with a hardwired game, but then complemented in 1977 by “plug and play”, which allowed the use of game cartridges for variety. Beginning in 1985 PC gaming became popular, exploiting the flexibility and increasing popularity of the personal computer. In 1989 Nintendo released its Game Boy, the first of the hand-held electronic games. Game imagery became more elaborate with the introduction of the 32-bit chip that was featured in the Sony PlayStation released in 1994. The 128-bit, sixth generation of video games was born with the introduction of the Sega Dreamcast in 1998. These technologies found a place in the Canadian consumer market from the moment of their introduction and Canadian companies have played a role in their development, with hardware makers like ATI Technologies developing high-powered video chips for game imagery and software companies developing a number of games. Gore-Tex, a breathable, waterproof textile, was patented in the US in 1980. Clothing made from this product and designed for outdoor all-weather, sporting, athletic and recreational activity became available in Canada shortly thereafter. The theme park became popular in the 1980s and the technology of thrill is the main attraction. In Toronto, Canada's Wonderland, Canada's largest, opened its doors to the public in 1981 and is now tied for second place in North America as the theme park with the most roller coasters (List of roller coasters at Canada's Wonderland). Galaxyland the world's largest indoor amusement park located in the West Edmonton Mall which opened in 1981 has garnered continent- wide attention. The most popular thrill ride, the Mindbender (Galaxyland) is the largest indoor triple-loop roller coaster in North America. The Drop of Doom was another featured attraction until closed in the early 2000s. The Mall's World Waterpark, which opened in 1985 offers bathers a chance to cavort in the world's largest indoor wave pool. The technology of auto racetrack design and construction has been put to good use in Montreal at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, Canada's premier auto race track and home of the Canadian Grand Prix Formula 1 motor car races since 1978. The slot machine, so dear to gamblers, was introduced during this period. Casinos have been built in Windsor, Caesars Windsor 1994, Niagara Falls, Niagara Fallsview Casino Resort 1996 and Orillia, Casino Rama 1996, Ontario, Montreal, Montreal Casino, Gatineau, Casino du Lac Leamy 1996 and Baie St. Paul, Casino de Charlevoix 1994, Quebec, Halifax, Casino Nova Scotia 1995, Nova Scotia and in Vancouver, the River Rock Casino Resort 2006, British Columbia. The world's first automated teller machine (ATM) service was developed by the Sherwood Credit Union in Regina in 1977, at that institution's North Albert Branch. Other Canadian financial institutions followed this lead and by the 1980s the ATM was available throughout Canada.Web Site, www.canadacool.com/COOLFACTS/SASKATCHEWAN/ReginaATM.html During the 1980s the bar code became a familiar feature on consumer products ranging from food to clothes as did the bar code scanner at the retail checkout counter. These two technologies greatly improved the effectiveness of the check-out procedure and improved inventory management as well, through the associated computer accounting of stock. This was one of the factors leading to the technique of just-in-time inventory management for retail, commercial and industrial undertakings. The payment of consumer purchases at the retail checkout counter through the use of an electronic debit card was introduced across Canada in 1994. Known as Interac, the system allows the consumer to swipe his personal card and with the use of a personal identification number have the amount of the purchase electronically deducted from his or her bank account. The service has since become very popular. Waste disposal, recycling Although the concept of recycling waste materials was not new, the Blue Box Recycling System for domestic refuse collection made the idea highly visible. Initially developed by Laidlaw Waste Systems for the Kitchener, Ontario, in 1983, it was introduced to Ontario municipalities in 1986, by Ontario Multi-Material Recycling Incorporated (OMMRI), and promoted by Nyle Ludolph, who became known as the Father of the Blue Box. The concept involved the use of blue plastic boxes which were distributed to home owners, who in turn filled them with recyclable refuse and placed them at curbside for weekly pickup. The refuse was taken to specially designed plants, where materials were sorted and recycled. The technique became popular in municipalities across Canada in the years that followed.web site, Pollution Probe, www.pollutionprobe.org/Reports/we%20recycle.pdf During these years the municipal garbage dump evolved to become the sanitary landfill site. A number of technologies, including clay and plastic liners were used to contain the smell and leachate. The largest in Canada, the Keele Valley Landfill was operated by the City of Toronto from 1983 until 2002, when it was closed because it was full. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), the gas propellants used in aerosol spray cans, became a target for environmental concern in the 1970s and 1980s when research demonstrated that they had a harmful effect on the ozone layer in the atmosphere. The international Montreal Protocol of 1989 banned the use of these substances and they were subsequently replaced with volatile hydrocarbons. The problem with choice to reuse is still not available. There are many products that don't need to be recycled for a hundred years, but are put out monthly. Architecture and civil engineering Large architectural works of note included BC Place, Vancouver, 1983, Petro-Canada Centre, West Tower, Calgary, 1984, the West Edmonton Mall, Edmonton, Alberta, 1986, Scotia Plaza, Toronto 1988, the Canterra Tower, Calgary, 1988, the Sky Dome, Toronto, 1989, Bankers Hall, Calgary, 1989, BCE Place–Canada Trust Tower, Toronto, 1990, the Bay Wellington Tower, Toronto, 1990, Tour du 1000 de la Gauchetière, Montreal, 1991, Tour IBM-Marathon, Montreal, 1992 and GM Place, Vancouver, 1995. New arenas for Canada's National Hockey League teams were built, including GM Place, Vancouver, home of the Vancouver Canucks in 1995, the Corel Centre in Ottawa, home of the Ottawa Senators and Molson Centre in Montreal, new home of the Montreal Canadiens, both in 1996. Significant new bridges included the Alex Fraser Bridge, Vancouver, 1986, the Skybridge (TransLink), Vancouver, 1989 and the Confederation Bridge, NB-PEI, 1997. End note In the earlier parts of Canada's history, the state often played a crucial role in the diffusion of these technologies, in some cases through a monopoly enterprise, in others with a private \\"partner\\". In more recent times the need for the role of the state has diminished in the presence of a larger private sector. In the latter part of the 20th century there is evidence that Canadian values prefer public expenditures on social programmes at the expense of public spending on the maintenance and expansion of public technical infrastructure. This can be seen in the fact that in 2008 the Federation of Canadian Municipalities estimated that it would take $123 billion to restore and repair aging urban infrastructure across Canada.

It is found in North America and Europe. It is also found and consumed in Bhutan. Description The following description combines several references. *Cap: 8 – 40 cm, orange brown to hazel brown, with darker patches. Often remaining closed up with a domed shape, but sometimes expanding and finally depressed. *Gills: Whitish, decurrent, crowded, sometimes forked. *Stem: Pale brown with two rings. Tapering below, often partly buried. *Odor: Of flour, cucumber or unripe melon skin. *Spores: White (en masse), 10 - 15 x 5 - 6 μm, smooth, somewhat spindle-shaped, amyloid. *Habitat: Under conifers, especially Pine and Spruce, in mountainous regions. European sources give the cap size as up to about 20 cm, while North American ones indicate an enormous maximum size of 40 cm. The upper ring is derived from the partial veil (which covered the lower surface of the cap before it opened), whereas the thinner lower ring originally formed part of the universal veil (which enveloped the whole mushroom). Taxonomy and Related Species C. imperiale is the only species of Catathelasma known in Europe. It was first described in 1845 by Fries under the name Agaricus imperialis. In 1872 Quélet classified the species in Armillaria and in 1922 the Austrian botanist Günther Beck von Mannagetta und Lerchenau invented the separate genus Biannularia for this single species, making it Biannularia imperialis. The genus Catathelasma had been defined in 1910 by Ruth Ellen Harrison Lovejoy based on the American species C. evanescens and for a time the two genera were regarded as separate (though closely related), as for instance in a 1936 paper by Rolf Singer. A few years later in 1940, Singer united the genus using Lovejoy's name, which takes precedence. The epithet \\"imperiale\\", meaning \\"imperial\\" refers to the (at times) large size of the mushroom. The species name must end in \\"-e\\", not \\"-is\\", as the genus is neuter. General In Europe this species has something of an iconic status amongst mycologists as an impressive and remarkable mushroom to find. It occurs in western North America and in various European countries (mainly in central Europe) where its frequency varies from \\"fairly rare\\" to \\"rare\\". C. imperiale is edible, but tough-fleshed. It is said to be good pickled.

Many of these rocks that are accounted for have been locked away in storage for decades. The location of the rocks has been tracked by researchers and hobbyists because of their rarity and the difficulty of obtaining more. Moon rocks have been subjects of theft and forgery as well. Investigations In 1998, a unique federal law enforcement undercover operation was created to identify and arrest individuals selling bogus Moon rocks. This sting operation was known as Operation Lunar Eclipse. Originally two undercover agents were involved in this sting, Senior Special Agent Joseph Gutheinz of NASA's Office of Inspector General (NASA OIG), posing as Tony Coriasso, and Inspector Bob Cregger of the United States Postal Inspection Service, posing as John Marta. This sting operation was later expanded to include Agents from the United States Customs Service, namely, Special Agent Dwight Weikel and Special Agent Dave Atwood. Agents posted a quarter page advertisement in USA Today asking for Moon rocks. The Agents were targeting individuals selling bogus Moon rocks, which con artists sell to the elderly and to space enthusiasts. The sting operation was led by NASA OIG Senior Special Agent Joseph Gutheinz. For the first time in history the sting operation recovered an Apollo era Moon rock, the Honduras Goodwill Moon Rock. This Moon rock had been given to Honduras by President Nixon, fallen into private hands, and then offered to the Agents for $5 million. In order to recover this Moon rock, the agents had to come up with the $5 million requested by the seller. Billionaire and one-time Presidential Candidate H. Ross Perot was asked by one of the agents to put up the money, and did so. After leaving NASA for a teaching position at the University of Phoenix, in Arizona, Gutheinz challenged his criminal justice graduate students to locate the goodwill Moon rocks. He subsequently extended this project to also cover the missing Apollo 11 Moon rocks President Nixon gave to the states and nations of the world in 1969. Hundreds of graduate students have participated in this project from 2002 to the present and while many Moon rocks have been found, others are now known to be missing, stolen, or destroyed. Gutheinz patterned this college project after NASA's earlier Operation Lunar Eclipse, which he had participated in. Beginning in 2002, his graduate students began reporting to him that both the Cyprus Apollo 11 Moon rock (which is actually a collection of lunar dust in a Lucite ball) and Cyprus Apollo 17 Goodwill Moon Rock (a pebble-size Moon rock) were missing. Operation Lunar Eclipse and the Moon Rock Project were the subject of the book The Case of the Missing Moon Rocks by Joe Kloc. Missing gifted rocks United States Delaware New Jersey The Apollo 11 sample is on display in the NJ State Museum. The experts and politicians in New Jersey, including former Governor Brendan Byrne, had no idea of where the Apollo 17 sample was, or of the state even receiving it. International Brazil Apollo 11 display missing. Canada Apollo 11 display missing. Cyprus While the Apollo 17 Goodwill Moon rock presented to Cyprus was recovered, the Apollo 11 rock given to the country remains missing. In his June 26, 2011 Op/Ed appearing in the Cyprus Mail entitled \\"Houston we have a problem: we didn't give Cyprus its moon rock\\", Joseph Gutheinz revealed that after NASA recovered the Cyprus Apollo 17 Goodwill Moon Rock over a year ago they failed to give the Moon rock to its legal owner, the nation of Cyprus. Honduras Apollo 11 display missing. Ireland The Apollo 11 rock presented to Ireland was accidentally discarded in a landfill known as the Dunsink Landfill in October 1977 following a fire that consumed the Meridian room library at the Dublin Dunsink Observatory where the rock was displayed. Cleo Luff, a student from the University of Phoenix, obtained this information after her investigation into the moon rock's location for a class she had with Professor Joseph Gutheinz. The Apollo 17 Goodwill Rock remains with the National Museum of Ireland. Malta On May 18, 2004, Malta’s Goodwill Moon Rock was stolen from Malta’s Museum of Natural History in Mdina. According to an Associated Press story appearing in USA Today, \\"there are no surveillance cameras and no custodians at the Museum of Natural History because of insufficient funding. The only attendant is the ticket-seller\\"… \\"A Maltese flag displayed next to the rock — which the U.S. astronauts had taken up with them — was not taken\\". Joseph Gutheinz, a retired NASA Office of Inspector General Special Agent who heads up a \\"Moon Rock Project\\" at the University of Phoenix (where he assigns his students the task of hunting down missing Moon rocks), urged the Maltese authorities to grant an amnesty period to the thieves. He advised that only an amateur thief would have taken the Maltese Goodwill Moon Rock and left the plaque and flag behind, as all three together would have been self-authenticating and eliminated the risk of a geologist needing to authenticate the Moon rock. Malta’s Goodwill Moon Rock hasn't been recovered and continues to be actively pursued. Nicaragua Apollo 17 display missing. Romania University of Phoenix graduate students uncovered evidence that the Romania Goodwill Moon Rock may have been auctioned off by the estate of its executed former leader, Nicolae Ceaușescu. Both Nicolae Ceaușescu and his wife, Elena Ceaușescu, were executed by firing squad on December 25, 1989, for the crime of genocide. As late as 2009, Romania believed it only received one Moon rock from the Nixon Administration, the Apollo 11 Moon rock, and took issue with those who argued otherwise. Joseph Gutheinz provided Daniel Ionascu of the Jurnalul information from the U.S. National Archives which showed that the Romanian Goodwill Moon Rock was presented to Romania. Romania’s Apollo 11 Moon Rock is at the National History Museum in Bucharest. Spain Evidence surfaced that both Spain’s Apollo 11 Moon Rock and Apollo 17 Goodwill Moon Rock which were given to General Francisco Franco’s Administration by the Nixon Administration were missing. Pablo Jáuregui, the Science Editor of El Mundo, a Spanish newspaper, disclosed in a July 20, 2009 story entitled: \\"Franco's grandson: My mother lost the lunar rock that was given to my grandfather.\\" that the Spanish Apollo 17 Goodwill Moon Rock had finally been given back to the people of Spain in 2007 by the family of Admiral Luis Carrero; and Jáuregui suggested that Spain’s Apollo 11 Moon Rock, as referenced in the title of the story, was last known to be in Franco’s family's hands, and is now unaccounted for. Jáuregui wrote that Luis Carrero Blanco the son of Admiral Carrero Blanco stated \\"As for the stone that Kissinger gave Carrero Blanco, the stone was in possession of the family (first in the home of his widow, and after that of his eldest son ), until in 2007 they decided to donate it to the Naval Museum, where it is on display today, along with a Spanish flag which traveled aboard the Apollo 17 mission to the moon. \\"My son told me that the gift was dedicated to 'The Spanish people', so it seemed right to donate it,\\" recalls Luis Carrero Blanco.

Jáuregui relates the following from Franco’s grandson: \\"The grandson of Franco stressed that neither he nor any other member of his family\\" had been told \\"that there might be some legal or ethical problem\\" regarding the Moon rock. \\"If you are given something and it's yours, why shouldn't you sell it?\\" He said. \\"In any case the rock was never sold\\", but according to Franco, at the moment it is not known where it is. \\"As my mother is a woman with many things in many houses, in a move or redecorating a room, in the end it must have got lost,\\" he explains. Students assigned to the Moon Rock Project are currently looking for leads to Spain’s Apollo 11 Moon Rock in Switzerland. Sweden Recovered gifted rocks United States Alaska Elizabeth Riker Elizabeth Riker was assigned the task of hunting down the Alaska Apollo 11 Moon Rock by her professor. On August 18, 2010, in a story she wrote about her investigation in the Capital City Weekly newspaper, of Juneau Alaska, she stated that after conducting a thorough investigation for Alaska's Apollo 11 Moon Rock she has concluded that it is missing. She advised that she planned to continue to look for the Moon rock and asked for the help of the citizens of Alaska to accomplish her goal of finding it. In 1973, there was a massive fire at the Alaska Transportation Museum where the Moon rocks were being housed. Coleman Anderson (a crab- fishing captain who was on the TV show Deadliest Catch) claimed to have gone to the museum to scrounge through the garbage from the fire to see if there would be anything worth saving. Anderson, who was a child at the time, claimed to have found the Moon rocks and cleaned them up over the next few years. To clear title to the rocks he filed a lawsuit against the State of Alaska, asking the Court to deem the rocks his sole property. The Official Complaint The missing Moon rocks were returned by Anderson as of December 7, 2012. Arkansas In a front-page story, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette listed numerous sources suggesting the Arkansas Goodwill Moon Rock had gone missing noting that the rock was potentially worth five million dollars. The rock was presented to the state by astronaut Richard H. Truly in 1976 at a Boy Scout event in Little Rock. Its whereabouts remained unknown until September 21, 2011, when it was discovered by Michael Hodge, an archivist with the Butler Center for Arkansas Studies, while processing the gubernatorial papers of Bill Clinton.\\"Hunt is on high, low, for moon rock state got from Apollo 17 \\" Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Sarah Wire, December 31, 2010. Colorado Based on the investigation of a graduate student, former Governor John Vanderhoof, then age 88, acknowledged he had the Goodwill Moon Rock presented to the people of Colorado in his personal possession and agreed to give it back to the state. On August 25, 2010, the Colorado Goodwill Moon Rock was unveiled at the Colorado School of the Mines Museum by Dr. Bruce Geller, the museum curator. Hawaii Flaws in the State of Hawaii inventory control system were highlighted in 2009 when an estimated $10 million in Moon rocks from Apollo 11 and the Apollo 17 Goodwill Rock could not be located. Curators and officials at every museum and university in the state, along with then Governor Linda Lingle’s office, capitol, and state archives, were contacted but none knew of the whereabouts of the items.\\"State fails to account for priceless moon rocks\\" The Maui News (a Reprint from the Honolulu Advertiser), Will Hoover, October 24, 2009. Both Moon rocks were later found in a \\"routine inventory of gifts given to the governor’s office over the years,\\" in a locked cabinet in the Governor’s Office. A senior advisor to the governor vowed to increase security and register the items with the state's Foundation of Cultural Arts.\\"Missing moon rocks turn up \\" Honolulu Advertiser, Will Hoover, January 11, 2010.

Photos in news stories about the location of the rock were later identified as coming from Apollo 11. Then Senator Kit Bond, who was the Governor of Missouri when the Apollo 17 Goodwill Moon Rock was gifted to the state, stated that he has no recollection of receiving a Moon rock and The Missouri State Archives, and the State Museum, reversing what they had previously stated, have no information on Missouri having the Apollo 17 Goodwill Moon Rock concluding that it was presumed missing.\\"Moon Rocks discovery a false alarm: Apollo 17 keepsake still missing after all\\" Columbia Daily Tribune, Janese Silvey, July 8, 2010.\\"Missouri State Museum Doesn't Have Apollo 17 Rock\\" Associated Press (The News Courier), July 9, 2010.

Nebraska North Carolina North Carolina's Goodwill Moon Rock along with other Apollo 17 flown items on temporary display at the NC Museum of Natural Sciences during a special event on the launch of STS-133 Professor Christopher Brown, Director of the N.C. Space Grant and professor at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill turned the Moon rock over, along with related items, to the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences where it is planned for permanent display in the Fall of 2011 when the museum expansion is completed. Brown obtained the rock from a colleague in 2003 who found it in a desk drawer at the state Commerce Department. Brown's colleague received permission to lend the artifact to Brown who used it in presentations on space and space-related science to students over the next several years.\\"State’s elusive moon rock soon to become a big star\\" The News Observer, Jay Price, July 28, 2010. Oregon Toni Dowdell, a graduate student at the University of Phoenix, was assigned the task of hunting down the Oregon Apollo 11 Moon Rock while two of her teammates were charged with hunting down the Apollo 17 Goodwill Moon Rocks of Oregon and Louisiana. Toni Dowdell and her two teammates received this assignment from her professor, a retired Senior Special Agent with NASA's Office of Inspector General. This assignment was part of an ongoing assignment known as the Moon Rock Project, where students are assigned the task of hunting down Moon rocks all over America and the world. In a February 19, 2010 article Toni Dowdell wrote for the Daily News of Greenville, Michigan, Dowdell described how her teammates in this investigation discerned that both the Apollo 17 Goodwill Moon Rocks of Oregon and of Louisiana remain unaccounted for, but how she successfully tracked down her assigned Moon rock, the Oregon Apollo 11 Moon Rock. As with many Moon rock gifts the Nixon Administration gave to the states and the nations of the world the first problem she encountered was a lack of a document trail. However, by reaching out to people, to include an operator in the state Capitol, she found the Moon rock hidden in the ceremonial Governor’s Office of Oregon.Search for the \\"missing\\" Apollo 11 moon rocks \\"\\" The Daily News, Toni Dowdell, February 19, 2010. According to moon rocks researcher Robert Pearlman, the Oregon Apollo 17 rock display is on permanent exhibit in the Earth Science Hall of the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry in Portland. West Virginia Sandra Shelton, a graduate student at the University of Phoenix, was assigned the task of hunting down the West Virginia Apollo 17 Goodwill Moon Rock by her professor, a retired Senior Special Agent with NASA's Office of Inspector General. This moon rock was presented to West Virginia in 1974 and is valued at $5 million. On May 16, 2010, Rick Steelhammer of the Gazette-Mail of Charleston, West Virginia wrote a front-page story documenting Sandra Shelton's investigative findings which revealed that the West Virginia Goodwill Moon Rock was missing.\\"The Case of the Missing Moon Rock: Graduate Student looks for Apollo 17 Gift from Nixon\\" Gazette Mail, May 16, 2010. Following that story, retired dentist Robert Conner called Shelton and told her that he had the West Virginia Goodwill Moon Rock. Shelton informed her professor, who advised the Governor's Office. Dr. Conner said that his deceased brother was the former business partner of former West Virginia Governor Arch A. Moore, Jr., and that Conner acquired the moon rock upon the death of his brother from his brother's belongings.\\" Second moon rock discovered in West Virginia\\" The Daily Sentinel, June 5, 2010.\\" Long-missing W.Va. moon rock believed found in Morgantown\\" Sunday Gazette Mail, June 5, 2010.

International Canada In 1972, then 13-year-old Jaymie Matthews, now Astronomy Professor at the University of British Columbia, lied about his age in order to compete in an essay contest, the winner of which would serve as a participant in a \\"10-day International Youth Science Tour, in which all the countries in the United Nations were invited to offer up \\"youth ambassadors\\" aged 17 to 21. These youth ambassadors were to witness first-hand the launch in Florida...\\" of Apollo 17…\\" Eighty countries accepted the invitation, including Canada. Matthews won the contest, and when his true age came out, Canadian officials decided to let him go anyway. As the student ambassador, it was decided that Canada's Goodwill Moon Rock was mailed to him where he kept it at his home. Eventually he was asked to turn the Moon rock over to Canada, which he did. The rock was reportedly stolen in 1978, while on tour.\\"UBC astronomy professor kept moon rock for several months\\" Vancouver Sun, Pete McMartin, July 17, 2009.

Cyprus Moon rocks from Apollo 11 and Apollo 17 presented to the island nation of Cyprus were believed to have been destroyed or stolen in 1974 during the Turkish invasion. In September 2009, while cooperating with a worldwide hunt for Moon rocks with Associated Press reporter Toby Sterling (Netherlands Bureau) and Cyprus Mail reporter Lucy Millett, the daughter of the British Ambassador to Cyprus, Gutheinz was advised by his friend and space memorabilia expert Robert Pearlman who had learned in 2003 that the Cyprus Goodwill Moon Rock was never presented to Cyprus, but retained by the son of an American diplomat. The American government was advised about this situation in 2003 and did nothing. Upon learning the truth Gutheinz reached out to both the American Embassy in Cyprus and the Cyprus Government to convey the facts; he then filed a request for a Congressional Inquiry into the case of the missing Cyprus Goodwill Moon Rock. Subsequently, he caused the facts about the Moon rock to be published in the press in order to motivate the person who had the Moon rock to do the right thing, and return it.Moon rocks went missing around the world.

The diplomat’s son thereafter began negotiating with NASA's Office of Inspector General, and did so for 5 months until the Cyprus Goodwill Moon Rock was recovered. The diplomat's son's name has never been disclosed. Honduras During \\"Lunar Eclipse\\", Florida businessman Alan H. Rosen, attempted to sell agents the 1.142 gram Goodwill Moon rock presented to Honduras for 5 million dollars. After two months of negotiations with Rosen, the Moon rock was seized from a Bank of America vault. The rock immediately became the subject of a 5-year civil suit, United States of America v. One Lucite Ball containing Lunar Material (one Moon Rock) and One Ten Inch by Fourteen Inch Wooden Plaque, which resulted in the forfeiture of the rock to the Federal Government on March 24, 2003.\\"Honduran Official Led in Soccer War.\\" Wall Street Journal, Stephen Miller, May 18, 2010. The rock was refurbished at Johnson Space Center, to be once again presented to the people of Honduras. In a September 22, 2003 ceremony at NASA's Headquarters in Washington, D.C., NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe presented the Moon rock to Honduran Ambassador Mario M. Canahuati. Also in attendance at this ceremony was Joseph Gutheinz, the leader of the sting operation, who gave a first hand account of the rock's recovery to Ambassador Canahuati. On February 28, 2004, O'Keefe flew to Honduras to formally present the Moon rock to Honduran president Ricardo Maduro.

Ms. Hawley said a rock sample collected during the Apollo 12 mission had been part of a shipment of registered and certified mail that was stolen while en route to a researcher at the University of California in Los Angeles in 1970. The space agency received a call on Thursday from the Postal Investigative Service in New York, she said, after articles about the impending auction had been published.

NASA-controlled rocks Theft of NASA rocks In June 2002, 101 grams of Moon rocks were stolen from the Johnson Space Center by interns Thad Roberts and Tiffany Fowler. The pair used knowledge of the security around the rocks gained during their internship to remove a safe in building 31 North containing the samples. Roberts is a certified pilot and scuba diver who was an ambitious student pursuing degrees in physics, geology, and anthropology who aspired to be an astronaut. Fellow interns Shae Saur and Tiffany Fowler, as well as accomplice Gordon McWhorter were also arrested for their roles in the theft and attempted sale of the rocks. The theft also included a meteorite that may have revealed information about life on Mars. Roberts advertised the rocks on a Belgian mineralogy club website which was forwarded to the FBI who, with the help of Belgian amateur rock collector Axel Emmermann, set up a sting. On July 20, 2002, the 33rd anniversary of the Apollo 11 landing, a number of FBI agents posed as diners at a chain Italian restaurant on Orlando's International Drive for a pre-arranged meeting with Roberts. Roberts met and spoke with one of the Special Agents at length. A second Agent—posing as the husband of the first—joined the two, and then two of the three accomplices joined them. The meeting moved to a nearby hotel where dozens of FBI agents arrested Roberts, McWhorter, and Fowler and recovered the missing lunar samples. Roberts was also charged with stealing dinosaur bones and other fossils from his school, the University of Utah. The theft was the subject of Ben Mezrich's book Sex on the Moon: The Amazing Story Behind the Most Audacious Heist in History. Axel Emmermann, Gordon McWhorter, NASA Principal Investigator Dr. Everett Gibson and investigating officers of the FBI and NASA Office of the Inspector General were interviewed on camera for a National Geographic Channels Explorer special called \\"Million Dollar Moon Rock Heist\\", first broadcast in the US on March 4, 2012. Testimony given therein is at odds with some of the key claims made in Mezrich's account. National Air and Space Museum In an Aviation Week & Space Technology article published on September 27, 1976 entitled \\"Lunar Sample Damaged by Vandals\\" the author addresses a vandalism and possible theft attempt against a 40 gram Apollo 17 Moon rock. The author states that the \\"Apollo 17 lunar sample on open display at the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum was slightly damaged…during an apparent vandalism attempt. It is possible that theft was the object of the attack on the sample, but both museum and National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials believe vandalism was the primary objective. About two cubic millimeters of the triangular fine-grained basalt were chipped away during the incident that involved a hard blow to the sample with a sharp object. NASA believes no part of the sample was obtained by the vandal. The area around the sample's display case was swept immediately after the incident, and the sweeper bag is now at the Johnson Space Center, where it is being sifted in an attempt to obtain the missing material.\\" The author stated that \\"The 40-gram sample on display is the first touchable moon rock.

NASA officials said that out of of Moon rock retrieved through the years, the sample was not a big loss. I don't know what value it would be except just to gloat over it personally,' said NASA spokesman Terry White about the theft.

It is used to make distant objects appear magnified with magnification increasing as longer focal length lenses are used. A long-focus lens is one of three basic photographic lens types classified by relative focal length, the other two being a normal lens and a wide-angle lens. As with other types of camera lenses, the focal length is usually expressed in a millimeter value written on the lens, for example: a 500 mm lens. The most common type of long-focus lens is the telephoto lens, which incorporate a special lens group known as a telephoto group to make the physical length of the lens shorter than the focal length. Effects Sports photographers using long-focus lenses Long-focus lenses are best known for making distant objects appear magnified. This effect is similar to moving closer to the object, but is not the same, since perspective is a function solely of viewing location. Two images taken from the same location, one with a wide angle lens and the other with a long-focus lens, will show identical perspective, in that near and far objects appear the same relative size to each other. Comparing magnification by using a long lens to magnification by moving closer, however, the long-focus-lens shot appears to compress the distance between objects due to the perspective from the more distant location. Long lenses thus give a photographer an alternative to the type of perspective distortion exhibited by shorter focal length lenses where (when the photographer stands closer to the given subject) different portions of a subject in a photograph can appear out of proportion to each other. Long lenses also make it easier to blur the background more, even when the depth of field is the same; photographers will sometimes use this effect to defocus the background in an image to \\"separate\\" it from the subject. This background blurring is often referred to as bokeh by photographers. Long lenses are often used with a tripod, because of the increased weight and the fact that the effect of camera shake is magnified. Still photography Effect of different focal lengths on photographs taken from the same place: Image:Angleofview 28mm f4.jpg|28 mm Image:Angleofview 50mm f4.jpg|50 mm Image:Angleofview 70mm f4.jpg|70 mm Image:Angleofview 210mm f4.jpg|210 mm The above photos were taken using a 35 mm camera, using lenses of the given focal lengths. Constant object size The photographer often moves to keep the same image size on the film for a particular object. Observe in the comparison images below that although the foreground object remains the same size, the background changes size; thus, perspective is dependent on the distance between the photographer and the subject. The longer focus lenses compress the perception of depth, and the shorter focus exaggerate it. This effect is also used for dolly zooms. The perspective of the so-called normal lens, 50 mm focal length for 35 mm film format, is conventionally regarded as a \\"correct\\" perspective, though a longer lens is usually preferred for a more pleasing perspective for portraits. Image:focale-rama-028.jpg|28 mm Image:focale- rama-050.jpg|50 mm Image:focale-rama-135.jpg|135 mm Telescopes as long- focus lenses From the invention of photography in the 19th century, images have been captured using standard optical telescopes including telescope objectives adapted as early portrait lenses.Rudolf Kingslake, A history of the photographic lens, page 33 Besides being used in an astronomical role in astrophotography, telescopes are adapted as long-focus lenses in nature photography, surveillance, machine vision and long-focus microscopy. To use a telescope as a camera lens requires an adapter for the standard 1.25 inch tube eyepiece mount, usually a T-mount adapter, which in turn attaches to an adapter for the system camera's particular lens mount. Controlling exposure is done by exposure time, gain, or filters since telescopes almost always lack diaphragms for aperture adjustment. The 1.25 inch mount is smaller than many film and sensor formats so they tend to show vignetting around the field edges. Telescopes are normally intended for visual use, so they are not corrected to produce a large flat field like dedicated camera lenses and tend to show optical aberration. Since the late 1990s compact digital cameras have been used in afocal photography, a technique where the camera lens is left attached, taking a picture directly through the telescope's eyepiece lens itself, also referred to as \\"digiscoping.\\" See also *Film format *Secret photography *Photographic lens design References Category:Photographic lenses ","title":"Long-focus lens"},{"id":"29990900","text":"Ian Bowditch (9 March 1939 - 25 February 2008) was an Australian fencer.

The species was described by Ruth Ellen Harrison Lovejoy in 1910. Description and Distribution The genus includes the commoner C. imperiale and C. ventricosum, but the type species, C. evanescens, seems extremely rare. In 1914 it was only known from the location of the initial find, which is at an altitude of 3500 m. in the Medicine Bow Mountains of Wyoming. It is distinguished from the other species because the gills are fairly distant (\\"subdistant\\") and because it has a large persistent volva around the base of the stipe. The species name may refer to the evanescent ring. The following summary is taken from Mrs. Lovejoy's original description. *Cap: 13 cm, broadly convex, white (but cream in the center). *Gills: White, very decurrent, \\"subdistant\\", with short and long ones mixed. *Stem: White, thick (4 cm.) but very short (1 cm.), with bulbous base, delicate evanescent ring, and large white persistent volva. *Spores: smooth, white, elliptical to fusiform, 14 - 17.5 × 3 - 5 µm.

Habington was the eldest son of John Habington of Hindlip, Worcestershire, by his wife Catherine, daughter of John Wykes. Thomas Habington was a younger brother. His father held the office of under-treasurer or 'cofferer' to Queen Elizabeth. Born about 1553, Edward was educated at Exeter College, Oxford, where he took his bachelor's degree in 1574. On leaving the university he spent much time at court. He there made the acquaintance of Anthony Babington, a Catholic courtier, who early in 1586 was maturing, at the instigation of a Jesuit, a plan for a general rising of the Catholics which should accomplish the murder of the queen and the liberation of Mary Stuart, at that time imprisoned at Chartley. Habington not only joined Babington's conspiracy with other young frequenters of the court, but was named one of the six conspirators charged with the contemplated murder of Elizabeth. In July 1586 the plot was discovered by Francis Walsingham's spies. Habington, found at the end of August in hiding near the residence of his family in Worcestershire, was thrown into the Tower of London. Brought with six others to trial on 15 September, he resolutely denied his guilt, and claimed to be confronted with two witnesses to his complicity, according to Edward VI's statute regulating trials for treason. But on the confession of other prisoners, and on the fragments of a confession written and subsequently torn up by himself while in prison, he was found guilty and condemned to death. On 20 September 1586 he was hanged and quartered in St. Giles's Fields. In a speech from the scaffold he vehemently maintained his innocence.

The 21st century has become the Internet Age is way both literal and metaphorical. The technology that dominates this period of time is wireless technology, cloud computing, HD/3D TV, mega oil, \\"greentech\\" and nanotechnology. Most technologies diffused in Canada came from other places; only a small number actually originated in Canada. For more about those with a Canadian origin, see Invention in Canada. Technology is a major cultural determinant, no less important in shaping human lives than philosophy, religion, social organization, or political systems. In the broadest sense, these forces are also aspects of technology. The French sociologist Jacques Ellul defined la technique as the totality of all rational methods in every field of human activity so that, for example, education, law, sports, propaganda, and the social sciences are all technologies in that sense. At the other end of the scale, common parlance limits the term's meaning to specific industrial arts.  Fields of technology   Internet  The Internet has become an essential part of daily life and is found in most Canadian homes, businesses and government offices. In December 2006, there were 22,000,000 Internet users representing 65.9% of the population and 7,675,533 Internet broadband connections. In 1988, the first .ca Canadian web address, upei.ca, was assigned by John Demco of the University of British Columbia (UBC) to the University of Prince Edward Island. The one millionth .ca address, krauslaw.ca was assigned in 2008 by the Canadian Internet Registration Authority, formed in 1998, to Brent Kraus of Calgary for the promotion of his law firm.magazine—Backbone: Business, Technology, Lifestyle, July/August 2008. p. 8. As of the end of 2010, Canadians, on a per-capita basis, were the most intensive users of Internet in the world.Michael Oliveira, \\"Canadians spend more time online than any other country\\", Globe and Mail, 28 December 2010 During this period, the web search engine became an integral part of use of the Internet. The first such programme, the \\"Archie search engine\\", was developed by McGill University student Alan Emtage in 1990. Since then, search engines, which have been mostly developed in the US, have evolved and become more versatile and powerful. Notable engines include Lycos (1994), Alta Vista (1995), Magellan (1995), Google (1998), Yahoo! Search (2004), MSN Search (2005), and Bing (2009). These Internet tools are available to web users from countries around the world, including Canada. E-mail, a very popular feature of the Internet, predated that technology by decades. E-mail type functionality was a feature of a computer sharing technology developed at MIT in the US in 1961. It was also part of the US-developed Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) component of the North American air defense system created in the fifties and sixties and which included a facility at RCAF North Bay, Ontario. However, it only became a publicly used service with the development of the Internet. A number of US providers now offer this worldwide service to Canadian users, including MSN Hotmail in 1996, Yahoo! Mail in 1997, AOL Mail in 2004 and Gmail in 2004. The development of special software allowed the Internet to be used to make computer to computer phone calls. In August 2003, a service known as Skype became available to Internet users around the world including Canada. It has since become extremely popular. Other web sites including those for social networking such as Facebook (2004), which as of 2008 has 17 million Canadian profiles, MySpace (2003), with 4.5 million Canadian profiles as of 2008, and Twitter (2006). Video and photo sharing sites such as YouTube (2005), with 14.5 million Canadian visits per month, and Vancouver-developed Flickr (2004), have become extremely popular in Canada.\\"The not-so-private price paid for social networking\\", The Globe and Mail, 13 September 2008, p. A12. The popular Canadian-developed on-line dating service Lavalife went on line for the first time in 1997. In 2010, more than 2 million Canadians were members of LinkedIn, a social networking website, developed in the US in 2003 to enable workers to network for professional and career reasons. In recognition of the importance of the Canadian market, the company opened a Canadian office in 2010.Tavia Grant, Globe and Mail, LinkedIn set to open shop in Canada, 28 March 2010 The big Canadian banks, including the Royal Bank of Canada, the Toronto Dominion Bank, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and the Bank of Nova Scotia made their customer accounts available on line as the web gained prominence. On-line investing has grown in popularity in the new century a number of Canadian firms offer sites for this service including, QTrade Investor, BMO InvestorLine, E*Trade Canada (now Scotia iTrade), TD Waterhouse, Credential Direct, RBC Direct Investing, CIBC Investor’s Edge, Disnat, ScotiaMcLeod, National Bank Direct Brokerage, and Virtual Brokers. Other businesses established a retail presence, notably Amazon.com in 1995, which became popular enough in Canada to merit a separate Canadian site, Amazon.ca, beginning in 2002. The Internet auction site eBay, launched in 1995, gave rise to a Canadian spin-off eBay.ca in 2000. PayPal has been operated by eBay since 2002, and is widely used by Canadians to cover the financial aspect of eBay transactions. Most large Canadian corporations, including telephone and utility companies, now provide on-line customer billing. The Government of Canada has been especially notable in establishing a very diverse and friendly on-line presence for the public. Initially, the basis for this service was a suite of technologies referred to as the Government Enterprise Network (GENet). In the fall of 2003, the government began to replace these with improved technologies known collectively as the Secure Channel Network (SCNet), which make available a wide range of services. For example, in recent years it has become possible for Canadians to file their yearly income tax returns using an Internet service provided by Revenue Canada known as NETFILE. The Internet has also become an important source of information, marked by the popularity of such sites as Wikipedia and Google Earth. Wikipedia, an on-line encyclopedia, was established in the US in 2001 by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger and presently has over 5,000,000 articles in English and a large number in other languages. Many articles have been contributed to both the English and French language versions of Wikipedia by Canadians, and many of these relate to important aspects of Canadian life. There are thousands of Canadians who use the service every day in both English and French. Google Earth, a virtual globe, is an on-line feature offered by Google since 2005. It provides aerial views of the Earth and is viewed by thousands of web users, many of which are Canadian, every day. Another Internet information service, the telephone directory Canada 411.ca, has become very popular since introduced in recent years. This has led to the delivery of the residential paper telephone book, introduced to Canada in 1878, being cancelled in major cities in 2010.Krashinsky, Susan.

D 14  Digital communication / HD TV (Delivery)  Star Choice (Shaw Direct) of Calgary, Alberta, and Expressvu Bell Satellite TV of Montreal began offering Canada- wide direct-to-home digital satellite television service in 1997. As of 2008, they had 900,000 and 1.8 million subscribers respectively. Star Choice broadcast the first high-definition television programme in Canada in 2000 and began broadcasting HD full-time in 2004. HD channels have been continuously added since that date. In April 2009, Star Choice changed its name to Shaw Direct. By 2009 satellite delivered Bell TV was delivering 45 HD channels. Rogers Cable, Canada's largest cable company, began to offer its Digital Television service in 2001. Video on demand (VOD), a technology that allows digital cable subscribers to order and watch movies at a time of their choice, has been available to Canadians since 2002, the year that Rogers Communication Inc., began to offer its Rogers on Demand service. By 2009 the service was available to 3.5 million homes. Shaw Communications Inc., Canada's second largest cable company offers a similar service. Rogers introduced personal video recorders (PVRs) to customers in 2003. The CBC began broadcasting digital over-the-air HDTV in 2005. A national government regulatory body, the Canadian Radio, Television and Telecommunications Commission, has stated that all over-the-air TV broadcasting will be digital by August 2011. During this period, efforts to convert over-the-air AM and FM radio to digital technology failed. A technique known as Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) (see Countries using DAB/DMB), was introduced to Canada in November 1999. However the technology never caught on, partly because of the chicken and egg phenomenon. When the technology was introduced, there were few listeners equipped with DAB receivers, and this in turn provided little incentive for broadcasters to convert their very successful AM and FM operations to DAB. DAB came to an end in Canada in 2010. However digital satellite radio has been successful. Two Toronto-based companies, Sirius Canada and XM Canada introduced direct-to- home/car, digital satellite radio service in December 2005 and by 2008 had 750,000 and 400,000 subscribers respectively. In 1999, Telesat launched the first of four Nimiq direct broadcast satellites which provide the space-based satellite transmitters for these services. In 2003, Bell Canada introduced an improved speech recognition system for its 310-2355 customer routing service in Ontario. Bell Canada users speak with the programme through \\"Emily\\", a young female-sounding artificial voice.Bell Canada Enterprises website In 2005, Skype, a voice-and-video-over-Internet technology became available to users around the world, including Canadians. The technique, which bypasses the traditional telephone network, allows people to use the Internet as a type of telephone and to both talk to and see each other during calls. It is used mainly for long-distance communication. The proliferation of multiple communications technologies has itself created the need to combine them effectively, resulting in a new technology, unified communications. This technique blends instant messaging, e-mail, voice mail, short message service, web-conferencing, fax, audio, video, cellphone, VIOP and other telecommunications services into a single system. Cooke Aquaculture Inc. of Blacks Harbour New Brunswick uses just such a system, developed by Cisco Systems Canada Co. to manage its fish farm operations. Digital media (content) Digital media were first introduced to Canada in the 1980s, when the CD and DVD became popular with consumers. The traditional media began to develop an on-line presence in the new century. Newspapers including Canada's two English-language \\"national\\", dailies, The Globe and Mail and the National Post went on line as did the weekly Maclean's news magazine. The French- language press did the same including the daily La Presse and the bi-weekly L'actualité newsmagazine. Television broadcasters got into the game, including the English-language national networks, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), CTV Television Network (CTV) and Canwest/Global and the French-language networks, Radio Canada, TVA (TV network) and TQS (now V). In 2009, a number of news services, including Thomson Reuters and Canadian Press, began to offer wireless Internet news services formatted for access by hand-held 3G devices such as the Blackberry. In 2009, Indigo Books and Music began to offer a digital book service known as Shortcovers. In late 2009, that electronic service was expanded and renamed Kobo (Kobo Inc.). It offers customers about 2,000,000 book titles in electronic form that can be viewed on an electronic reader. A variety of electronic books or readers have gained a place in Canada beginning with the introduction of the Sony Librie reader in 2004 and the Kindle in 2009. Kobo intends to introduce its own reader in 2010 with code based on an open source concept. In 2010 a number of Canadian libraries, including the Ottawa Public Library began offering books on loan via a downloadable Kindle format. With the release of the iPad in Canada in 2010, digital media providers have begun to format their digital media offerings to make them compatible for iPad viewing. The downloading of music from the Internet to computers and other storage devices including the iPod, has become very popular in recent years. Music can be downloaded peer-to-peer or from about 500 on-line sites in 40 countries. In Canada one site of note, Puretracks, has been offering a library of about 1.3 million popular songs in Windows Media Audio and MP3 format for download since 2003. The film industry has also moved to adopt digital cinema technology. The technology of cinematic special effects has become a notable feature of the film production, with over 2300 Canadian companies, including, Side Effects Software, Toon Boom Animation, Image Engine, (Vancouver), Intelligent Creatures, (Toronto), Intrigue FX and Rainmaker Digital Effects (CIS) in Vancouver, being involved in the field. The National Film Board of Canada began to digitize its extensive archives and later in 2008 will announce the availability of its films on-line. In Toronto, Cineplex Entertainment, through Technicolor Digital Cinema has installed the Canadian made Christie CP2000 DLP Cinema projector in the Scotiabank Theatre in Toronto, making it the first Canadian cinema operating this new technology, which provides sharp images and uncompressed digital sound. It can also project 3-D features with Real D Cinema. Cineplex plans to have 25 cinemas across Canada equipped with this new technology in the near future. A Montreal company, D-Box began to offer motion seats for cinemas in 2008. These seats physically move in a way designed to enhance the movie-going experience. The movement is induced by a digital signal specially embedded in the film which activates pistons in the seat that produce the physical movement. Canadian cinemas equipped with the devices in 2010 include, the Cinéma Beloeil, in Beloeil, Quebec and the Cineplex Odeon Queensway Theatre in Etobicoke, Ontario Companies such as Electronic Arts, Ubisoft Montreal, BioWare and Next Level Games are active in the technologies related to the development and manufacture of video games. As of 2010 video game publishers and developers in Canada were found in major cities across the country including: Vancouver 47, Toronto 33, Montreal 22, Ottawa 13. Wireless (mobile) Internet The use of mobile devices for accessing the Internet through a wireless local-area-network, wireless LAN in Canada has increased dramatically in recent years. Geographic areas having access to a wireless local-area-network are often referred to as having Wi-Fi service. By 2006 Internet providers began making \\"mobile\\" Internet connection available to their customers with companies such as Bell Canada offering their \\"unplugged\\" service. This type of service uses the laptop computer and plug-in modem to allow mobile Internet connection in many places across Canada. \\"Wireless\\" Internet communications have also been facilitated through the introduction of the widely popular Research In Motion, BlackBerry handheld email and telephone machine and the introduction in 2008, by Rogers, of the \\"Rocket\\" wireless Internet stick for laptops. In 2007 Canadian wireless carriers began to convert their DAVE! systems from the CDMA standard which restricted the user to service within North America to the GSM standard used by most carriers around the world. Videotron Telecom Ltee., one of the winners of the Canadian government wireless spectrum auction of 2008, announced that it would invest C$255 million to build a wireless network in Quebec, using the High Speed Packet Access, (HSPA) technical standard. In 2009, 3G wireless Internet technology became widely available to Canadians through national networks operated by Bell Mobility, Rogers, and Telus. The use of the Netbook a small portable computer that takes advantage of 3G technology to provide access the Internet became popular in Canada beginning in 2009. As of 2009, the downloading of applications and data (music, videos, etc.) via smartphone is becoming increasingly popular in Canada. The bandwidth represented by this use represents up to 40 time the bandwidth used by cellphones for voice calls, putting a tremendous load on existing cellphone networks and driving Rogers Communications Inc., Bell Canada and Telus to invest heavily in expanding the capacity of their networks. In 2008 the government of Canada, as part of an effort to increase competition in the mobile communications industry, gave a number of new companies including, Public Mobile Holdings Inc., Globalive Communications Inc. and DAVE Wireless Inc. approval to establish new wireless operations in Canada to compete with the three incumbents. Bell Mobility introduced a smartphone with the Google developed Android operating system in 2009. In 2010 Google made its Nexus One available to Canadian consumers who can obtain these devices from Rogers Wireless, Telus, Bell and Wind Mobile. As the result of a CRTC decision, cellphone providers in Canada, as of 2010, were able to locate within a radius of 300 metres, the geographic position of a handset used for making a 911 call. In 2009, Canada's three cell phone companies, Rogers Communications Inc., Bell Canada and Telus created a jointly owned company, Enstream LP, which offers a cash transfer service via cellphone. To use the service the subscriber first downloads special software called Zoompass, from Enstream to his or her phone. With this software, a Bell, Fido, PC Mobile, Rogers, Solo Mobile, or Telus subscriber can then withdraw up to $1000 daily from his bank account, or credit card account and transfer the amount to another subscriber who uses the same Zoompass software. Enstream plans to make the service increasingly flexible with the end goal of converting the cellphone into an electronic wallet or purse.Avery, Simon, Cellphone cash transfer service set to launch, The Globe and Mail, 13 June 2009, p. B2. In August 2010, Telus began offering the FaceTime service for its iPhone 4 customers.Telus advertisement, back cover, Macleans, 23 August 2010 Foursquare, a cellphone-based mobile social networking service, was introduced to Canada in 2010. The service allows cellphone users to download the Foursquare software to their mobile phones and use it to stay connected with friends and colleagues using the same software and to obtain information on their physical location. Telus Canada began offering a telephone service called Tigits across Canada in early 2011. Tigits provides a temporary anonymous telephone number for those who subscribe to the service. Developed by Toronto businessman, Sean Miller, Tigits allows the subscriber to protect his/her real number by giving the temporary Tigits number to others. When a Tigits subscriber calls the other person, the person called sees only the Tigits number on his digital display and not the real number of the person calling. When the other person calls the Tigits number of the Tigits subscriber the call is forwarded to the real number of the Tigits subscriber, thus protecting his/her anonymity. Digital courts The University of Montreal has recently experimented with ways to improve the administration of justice by creating a digital court room in which mock trials are held using modern technology to speed the proceedings. The \\"courtroom\\" has facilities for filing documents electronically. Witnesses can testify by video link or holographically from a remote location. Documents can be served on parties through social media. According to those involved with the project, barriers to its application in real courtroom settings are not technological but rather emotional, with judges and lawyers being resistant to change. Cloud and quantum computing Evidence that cloud computing had begun to take hold in Canada by 2009 is reflected in the organization of the first Canadian Cloud Computing Conference held on 9 February of that year, in Toronto. Cloud computing involves the use of information processing and data storage on computers that are located away from the site of the user and owner of the data. The user, a corporation or individual, communicates with the remote computer through the Internet. The growing popularity of the small netbook computer is in part due to the fact that it is ideally suited to take advantage of cloud computing. The technique allows the user to focus more on processing and storage than on equipment and software acquisition and maintenance. However, it also raises questions relating to privacy and security, in that confidential data may be transmitted, processed and stored on facilities beyond the geographic reach of the owner of the data. Cloud computing providers offer three types of service, platform-as-a-service (PaaS), software-as-a-service (SaaS) and infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS). As of 2009, Toronto area companies appeared to be the leaders of cloud computing in Canada. An initiative based in Kitchener/Waterloo has brought together a group of computer service providers to create Canadian Cloud Computing, which has developed the Trusted Canadian Cloud. This cloud computing service, which uses facilities based exclusively in Canada, was first demonstrated at Canada 3.0 Digital Media Conference held in Stratford, Ontario in 2010.Website, Canadian Cloud Computing, So much for Our Low Profile, www.canadiancloud.com Quantum computing in Canada is also gaining a foothold as evidenced by D-Wave Systems, a Burnaby-based quantum computing company founded in 1999 where in May 2013 it was announced that a collaboration between NASA, Google and the Universities Space Research Association (USRA) launched a Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab using a 512 qubit D-Wave Two that would be used for research into machine learning, among other fields of study. Though the field is still in its infancy, experiments have been carried out in which quantum computational operations were executed on a very small number of qubits. Both practical and theoretical research continues, and many national governments and military funding agencies support quantum computing research to develop quantum computers for both civilian and national security purposes, such as cryptanalysis. Facial recognition technology The use of facial recognition technology (FRT) has grown in Canada in recent years. Nineteen of 27 Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation casinos, which receive 40,000,000 visitors a year, are using FRT to automatically identify 15,000 problem gamblers who have voluntarily placed themselves on a self-exclusion list. The Canadian Bankers Association has been using FRT since 2008 to investigate debit card fraud. The Insurance Corporation of British Columbia has been using FRT since 2008 to counter fraudulent attempts by individuals to obtain a driver's license. In the summer of 2010, the technology was used by the Toronto Police to identify suspects wanted for vandalism or violent acts committed during the G-20 Summit there. The Department of Foreign Affairs has begun to issue e-passports with a chip that will enable the use of facial recognition technology beginning in 2012. Social media organizations such a Facebook, with millions of Canadian users have also adopted the use of FRT in their operations. All these applications and others raise privacy concerns.  Internet television IPTV Internet television began to make inroads in Canada in 2009 with communications providers including, Bell TV, Telus, Rogers Communications and Quebecor (Videotron) investing in the Internet bandwidth necessary to provide their subscribers with TV programmes and movies. Bell TV and Rogers Communications Inc. introduced Internet TV to their subscribers in the fall of 2009. Telus began to offer its rebranded Optik, IPTV service in June 2010. That same month, Quebecor began to offer the Illico Web service with 32 channels (24 in French) to its subscribers through its Videotron subsidiary. The company has stated that the new service will eventually become a \\"mirror\\" of its TV offerings. Bell began providing a rebranded IPTV service called Fibe, in September 2010. In 2010, Shaw Communications announced its intention to begin providing its customers with Internet TV. Halifax based EastLink is also investing in IPTV. The delivery of movies and television programmes through the Internet in Canada was also given a boost with the introduction a streaming video Internet service by the US based Netflix, via its Canadian server at Netflix.ca in 2010. Canadian-owned movie delivery services were also introduced. Cineplex began to offer a movie download service and a streaming on-line Internet video service was introduced at Zip.ca.  3D TV  The first efforts towards providing Canadian viewers with 3D TV were made in 2010. Early in the year two international consumer product manufacturers, Samsung and Sony began to market flat screen, digital, high definition, 3D television sets in Canada. The 3D effect is only available with the use of a pair of special glasses worn by the viewer. Each company has its own proprietary viewing standard, so that the glasses of one company cannot be used to view the 3D television of another.Canadian Press, Samsung to start selling 3D TVs in Canada later this month, 10 March 2010 DVD movies recorded in 3D provide what is, as yet, a limited source of programming. Broadcasters also began to take steps to provide 3D programming to viewers equipped with these new 3D sets. The World Cup soccer championship played in South Africa was broadcast in 3D by the host broadcaster and the signal was offered in Canada by a number of TV providers. On 27 July 2010, the satellite delivered Bell Satellite TV began to offer its subscribers a full-time 3D Oasis pay TV channel. The CBC also announced in August 2010 that it would broadcast the first Canadian produced 3D programme on 20 September 2010. It would be available to all viewers in Canada with an HD television set but the 3D effect would only be available when the programme was viewed with special glasses which will be distributed free at Canada Post Offices across Canada before the programme. Thought-controlled machines On 2 August 2010, a Toronto company, InteraXon, announced that it had developed technology to control machines by human thought. The technique involves the use of a head set to detect \\"alpha\\" and \\"beta\\" brain waves. The head set in turn produces a \\"control signal\\" that can be used to program electrical appliances ranging from lights to home appliances to computers. The technology was demonstrated at the 2010 Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver, where visitors used their brain waves to control the lighting on three landmarks, the CN tower in Toronto, the Parliament Buildings in Ottawa and Niagara Falls. The technology is based on the research of Dr. Steve Mann, a University of Toronto professor who initially developed thought-controlled computing technology. The company foresees that the headset will evolve into a small wireless Bluetooth device that will be available in consumer electronics retail stores within two years. Communications: analog to digital technology Analog technology has dominated the history of the communications system in Canada for almost 160 years. It formed the basis for the telegraph, beginning in the 1850s, the telephone in the 1880s, recorded sound, the 20th century, radio, the 1920s, computers and television, the 1950s and cable TV in the 1960s. However, digital technology has slowly replaced analog technology in all these domains in the past 40 years. The transformation began with the telephone system, in the 1970s and microchips and microcomputers in the early 1980s. Indeed, it was the combination of the telephone system and computers through a common digital link that permitted the latter machines to communicate with each other at distance. Further digital advances lead to the digital camera, CD, DVD and mobile communications, later in that decade, the Internet in the 1990s as well as land based and satellite TV and radio, wireless communications etc., in the first decade of the new century. With the CRTC mandated end to analog television broadcasting in Canada in August 2011, the analog age in Canada will for all practical purposes come to an end.  Transportation  Energy concerns have had a large impact on automobile manufacturers. Fuel efficient hybrid vehicles such as the Chevrolet Tahoe, Saturn Vue, Toyota Prius, Toyota Camry Hybrid, Toyota Highlander Hybrid, Ford Escape Hybrid, Honda Insight and Honda Civic Hybrid have become available to Canadian consumers since the start of the 21st century and the rising cost of gasoline is making them increasingly attractive in spite of their generally higher cost. As of 2009, the Ford Fusion Hybrid was the most fuel efficient mid-sized car available in Canada. In 2008 Ford Canada began the operation of the Flex assembly line, using the Flex technique at its plant in Oakville, Ontario. This technology allows the production of three different automobile types, in this case, the Ford Edge, the Ford Flex and the Ford Lincoln MKX, on the same assembly line. In 2004 Mercedes-Benz introduced the diminutive and fuel efficient Smart Fortwo automobile to the Canadian market. Multinational car manufacturers have also announced their intentions to introduce the all-electric car to world markets including Canada. General Motors has announced the availability of its Chevrolet Volt in Canada in 2011 as has Mitsubishi for its MiEV, while Nissan has announced the Canadian introduction of the Nissan Leaf in 2012. The management of automobile traffic in large urban areas through the use of \\"smart\\" electronic traffic management systems has become popular in recent years. Such systems are now in place in Toronto (1993), Ottawa, Calgary and Halifax. The city of Montreal will take the first steps for the installation of such a system in 2011. 500 video cameras and other street and highway mounted sensors will provide information for a central computer which will be used to control traffic lights to improve traffic flow and reduce accidents. Another traffic management tool involves the use of satellite tracking. Promoted by a Toronto company, Skymeter Corp, but not yet deployed in Canada, the system, a type of toll road in the sky, is designed to reduce traffic jams through the use of automobile based transponder/GPS systems and satellites. The satellite tracks the route of a particular vehicle at a particular time and then charges the user based on a systems of \\"tolls\\" based on the roads taken and the time of day. The tolls are publicized for users and designed to encourage road use in a way that minimizes traffic jams. The computerized billing system keeps an account of the charges and bills the customer incurs on a regular basis. In 2010, the City of Montreal began to deploy 800 wireless, networked, solar-powered, Linux based, electronic parking payment stations to replace up to 10,000 existing mechanical parking meters. Each parking space has a code and the motorist can pay the required parking rate, with cash or credit card, from any station in the city (he/she must of course remember his code). The system, developed by 8D Technologies of Quebec also allows metre maids to check for parking violations by wirelessly interrogating a parking station with a hand-held device from his/her vehicle. The devise provides a digital map of all parking spaces near the station and marks those spaces with vehicles in violation with a red symbol. Other cities across Canada are installing similar machines.dailywireless.org, Electronic Parking Meters, 5 March 2010 A light-rail urban passenger train known as the O-Train, began operation in Ottawa in 2001 providing limited service in a north-south corridor, today's Trillium Line. There are plans to expand the system to serve the downtown core as well as the western and eastern suburbs of the city by 2016. Global positioning technology has become an important feature of business and consumer life. After 23 years of military development, the U.S. military global positioning system became operational in 1995. Originally designed for the precise targeting of weapons and other military purposes, the U.S. government made the system available to civilians in 1996. Industrial users such as transportation companies and resource companies began to make use of the technology for the tracking of vehicles and the location of field operations. Receivers for the consumer market, were also produced and made available in Canada and became popular with outdoorsmen and women. In 2004 a GPS feature became available on some mobile phones and stand alone units for car navigation were available to Canadians by 2008. The 11 September 2001 terrorist attack on the U.S. has resulted in increased security along the Canada-U.S. border. In 2004, Canada and the U.S. signed the Canada-U.S. Agreement on Science and Technology Cooperation for Critical Infrastructure Protection and Border Security designed to speed the introduction of a number of electronic, wireless, computer and detection technologies to scrutinize cross-border traffic while at the same time limiting the disruption to the flow of people and goods. The use of these technologies is particularly important at the Windsor Detroit border crossing which is the busiest in the world.Foreign Affairs and International Trade In 2008, the Government of Canada announced the initiation of two important transportation projects. In the first instance the government stated that it will acquire, for the Canadian Coast Guard, a new $700 million, CCG Polar Class icebreaker for patrolling the Northwest Passage. The ship will enter service in 2017. The government also announced the construction of a second international bridge between Windsor, Ontario and Detroit, Michigan, to help relieve the pressure on the heavily overloaded, 80-year-old Ambassador Bridge. The $5 billion project will include connections from the Canadian ends of both bridges to the nearby Highway 401 (Ontario). As of December 2010 construction had yet to start. The field of transportation also saw the Premiers of Ontario and Quebec in 2007 talking of yet another study of a high speed train in the Quebec City – Windsor Corridor. Between 2006 and 2009, Air Canada \\"made over\\" the cabins of all its aircraft providing each passenger seat with a number of new technologies including, a Personal AVOD (with a 230 mm touch-screen LCD) offering 200 hours of video and audio entertainment, interactive games, a three-prong 120 V AC plug for laptops, a USB port and XM Radio Canada. The largest airplane in the world the Airbus A380, in this case operated by Emirates Airline, began regular service between Toronto's Lester B. Pearson Airport and Dubai in 2009. By 2009, most major airports in Canada were equipped with stand alone self-service customer check-in kiosks, which provided the passenger with a boarding pass for his/her flight. This represented the further extension of the technique known as the e-ticket which became the standard for purchasing an aircraft ticket several years earlier. In January 2010, the Government of Canada announced the use of full body scanner for the security checking of passengers boarding planes in Canada bound for the US. The scanners will be installed at the airports in Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton and Halifax. The use of biometrics will become an important technique in the screening of those wishing to enter Canada. It is planned that between 2011 and 2013 the Department of Immigration and Citizenship will begin to deploy digital face and fingerprint scanning systems at overseas Canadian Visa offices for the issuance of visas to those who intending to visit Canada. Air navigation coverage has recently been improved through the deployment of Automated Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) technology in parts of northern Canada. First introduced in the Hudson Bay area in January 2009, the service will eventually be expanded to cover all of northern Canada. The technique involves the use of ground-based transmitter/receivers and special electronic equipment aboard aircraft flying through northern airspace. This special equipment automatically transmits information relating to the aircraft position (determined by a GPS on the airplane) every second, to the ground-based receiving station, a number of which are located in the north. The station then transmits this information to an area control centre, operated by Nav Canada, Canada's national air navigation system operator, where the it is displayed on \\"radar\\" screens which are used by air traffic controllers to monitor Canadian airspace.Brochure, ADS-B Hudson Bay Implementation, Nav Canada The importance of the shipping container has been emphasized by recent developments in Winnipeg. \\"CentrePort Canada, an 8,000-hectare inland port being developed on the city’s edge is a one-stop shop for air, truck and rail shipments and is designed to reroute North American trade through the middle of the country...CentrePort (recently) announced an agreement with two Chinese partners, including the country’s largest private shipping company, Minsheng International Freight Co....(that)...will create a new container-based rail system that will quickly move crops from the Canadian prairies into the Chinese market.\\" Rail services will be provided by Canadian Pacific Railway and Canadian National Railway. A new highway, the CentrePort Canada Way, is under construction to divert the heavy truck traffic associated with the new facility away from urban roads.  Energy and mega oil  In this century, the largest engineering undertaking by far is the tar sands project in northern Alberta. This has seen the investment of up to $60 billion to develop and build gigantic tar sand mining, transportation, separation and refining facilities to produce oil from the gritty bitumen tar. The project is highly controversial for a number of reasons not the least of which is environmental. As of 2005, operations included the Suncor Mine, Syncrude Mine, Shell Canada Mine and others producing 760,000 barrels of oil a day. A large number of corporations from a number of countries plan to invest in the tar sands, including Suncor Energy, Syncrude, Shell/Chevron/Marathon, and Petro-Canada. Recovery techniques include steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) and cyclic steam stimulation (CSS). More recently Cenovus Energy of Calgary has developed the \\"Solvent Aided Process\\" SAP for heavy oil recovery. This involved injecting butane or other organic solvent, along with steam into a horizontal chamber dug in the oil sands. The solvent and steam allow the oil to flow into another chamber below the first. It is then pumped to the surface from this chamber.The Future of Energy, Information Supplement, Macleans, 23 August 2010 Oil sands recovery techniques create huge amounts of contaminated waste water, which is stored in \\"tailing ponds\\". In 2010, there were about 170 square kilometres of these ponds in the oil sands region of Alberta. Left to a normal process of degradation it would take decades for this waste to become environmentally safe. On 27 August 2010, Shell Canada announced the opening of a commercial plant designed to speed the cleaning of the waste in these ponds, at its oil sands production facility in Alberta. The plant uses a technique developed by Shell Canada at a cost of C$30 million. Known as \\"atmospheric fines drying\\" or AFD, it takes the thick liquid output of the oil production process and over a period of several weeks with the use of a special flocculant and drying techniques, reduces it to a safe dirt-like compound. Shell Canada is making this technology available free of charge to other oil sands production companies. Shale gas Geological formations of shale gas are being explored as a new source of energy. A technique known as horizontal drilling is used to create a horizontal bore hole, through a formation. Water under high pressure is then pumped into the bore hole where it fractures the shale and allows the gas to escape the rock and seep up the bore hole. There are a number of shale gas fields in Canada including the Shallow Colorado basin in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, the Bakken, in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, the Antrim in Southern Ontario and the Utica in south east Quebec.Newsletter, Shale Gas Outlook Until 2020, ziff Energy Group - Global Energy Advisors, 8 April 2009 The technique is not without problems for the fracturing can affect aquifers causing contamination and deviation. To date efforts at production in Canada have been limited to exploratory wells. Canaport, the first liquified natural gas (LNG) port terminal facility of its kind in Canada, began operation in Saint John, New Brunswick in 2009. LNG is seen as a substitute for conventional gas.O'Meara, Dina, Canadport: Right place, wrong time, National Post, 27 June 2009, p. FP4. In 2008, the Government of Ontario announced plans for the construction of two new reactors at the existing Darlington nuclear power facility, but suspended the project in 2009. Competing designs included the ACR-1000 by Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., the EPR by the French company Areva Group and the AP1000 by the US based Westinghouse Electric Co. Llc.. The government of Saskatchewan is considering the construction of two nuclear reactors in Lloydminster and the government of New Brunswick is proposing the addition of another reactor at its Point Lepreau nuclear power facility. Renewable energy and sustainability concerns In 2006, the Government of Ontario instructed the provincial hydro utility to provide all of its customers with digital smart hydro meters by 2010 as a first step towards the creation of a Smart Grid, which would conserve electricity. The project had been largely completed as of that date. In BC, BC Hydro announced in 2010 the replacement of existing hydro metres with digital smart meters for its 1.8 million residential and commercial customers, by 2012. In Vancouver, the Vancouver Fuel Cell Vehicle Program, a pilot project, was introduced in 2005 to study the use of hydrogen as a power source for cars. The three-year undertaking, a first in Canada for fuel cell powered automobiles, studies the operation of a fleet of five Ford Focus FCV’s (fuel cell vehicles), in \\"real world\\" conditions, in Vancouver and Victoria. The project is the initiative of a consortium made up of the Governments of Canada and British Columbia, Fuel Cells Canada, and Ford Motor Company.The Vancouver Fuel Cell Vehicle Programme Concerns with energy efficiency have also led to the introduction of the compact fluorescent lamp for domestic, commercial and industrial use and the federal government stated in 2007 that the sale of incandescent light bulbs would be phased out by 2012. The technology of the LED lamp has been known for a century. In recent years, it has become a popular replacement for incandescent bulbs because of its low power consumption. RenewABILITY Energy of Waterloo has developed a technique for recovering heat from domestic waste water. Known as the Power-Pipe, it channels hot waste water through cold water waiting to be used and heats it. =Biofuels and coal= The use of clean-burning biofuels such as ethanol has become significant in recent years. At the present time, Canada's largest manufacturers of ethanol include GreenField Ethanol and Husky Energy, which produce 500 million litres and 260 million litres of ethanol a year respectively from corn and wheat. Other companies are also at work in the field, including Enerkem of Montreal, which makes ethanol from old telephone poles at a facility in Westbury, Quebec and Iogen of Ottawa, which makes cellulosic ethanol from wheat straw. Since 2007, the Government of Ontario has required that all gasoline sold in the province contains at least 5% ethanol. A federal regulatory change in 2009 will require all oil refiners in Canada to provide an ethanol content of at least 5% in their gasoline by September 2010. The Fischer-Tropsch process is the basis for a proposal by AP Fuels of Montreal to establish five biorefineries in Canada. The plan calls for the use of this technique to transform certain types of trees, notably popular and birch, into gas and then to liquid-biodiesel, which burns with reduced CO2 output.Yakabuski, Konrad, The Globe and Mail, 18 June 2009, P. B1. The technology of \\"clean\\" coal has also become important. Western Canada has abundant coal supplies but the use of coal in recent years has been criticized for environmental reasons. To counter this criticism, coal and coal-fired electricity producers have formed the Canadian Clean Power Coalition. This organization promotes a number of projects which use a variety of \\"clean\\" coal technologies. These include the EPCOR Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) plant for the Genesse Power Station in Alberta. The IGCC plant gasifies coal and uses the clean gas to drive a gas turbine. The process also produces steam, which is used to turn a steam turbine. Both turbines are used to produce electricity. The process also captures CO2 from the gas combustion, which is in turn used for enhanced oil recovery or is sequestered underground.The Globe and Mail, Monday 8 June 2009, p. CCT1. =Wind and solar power= Energy concerns have inspired the development of wind farms that use modern windmills to generate electricity from this renewable resource. One of the first modern windmills was built at Cap Chat in Quebec in the eighties, but most wind farms have been built since 2000. As of 2008, 10 megawatt wind farms in Canada were distributed as follows: Alberta 10, Quebec 5, Ontario 5, PEI 4, Saskatchewan 3, Manitoba 2 and Nova Scotia 2. In 2008 Hydro-Québec announced the construction of 1000 windmills at 15 new sites located mostly in the St. Lawrence River Valley. By 2015, that utility expects that 10% of the province's electricity will be provided by wind power. In 2008, in British Columbia, BC Hydro has issued a Clean Power Call for proposals for environmentally friendly energy production and one company, Naikun Wind Energy, has responded with Canada’s first plan to develop off- shore wind power by installing windmills at sea in the Hecate Strait off the north coast of B.C. In 2010, the Government of Ontario signed an agreement with Samsung and the Korea Electric Power Corporation to build and operate wind and solar electrical generating farms across southern Ontario. The C$5 to C$7 billion project is described as the largest of its type in the world and will begin with installations in Chatham-Kent and Essex-Haldimand counties in southwestern Ontario. It is foreseen that the wind turbines will generate up to 2,000 MW and the solar power facilities up to 500 MW. This will permit the closure of all of the coal-fired electric generating plants in Ontario by 2014. A private company, OptiSolar Farms Canada Inc., is using silicon solar panels to develop what will become the largest solar power farm in North America. The facility, under construction in a field near Sarnia, will begin to produce 60 megawatts of electricity for Ontario consumers by the end of 2008. =Geothermal energy= The use of geothermal energy has grown in Canada in recent years although its overall importance as an energy source is still very small. The use of geothermal energy in Canada falls into two broad categories: commercial use to produce electricity and consumer use for home heating. In Canada, the former is limited to a facility in Meager Mountain British Columbia, a site with a potential for 100–250 MW, which has recently (2010) begun to produce for the BC Hydro grid. In the case of consumer use, a hole similar to that used for a domestic water well is drilled in the ground near the residence in question. Water is pumped to the surface and passed through a heat exchanger where some of its heat is removed and transferred to a closed loop water system in the house. The cooler water is then returned to the ground. The water in the closed loop is circulated throughout the structure where it passes through radiators and heats the house.The Pembina Institute: Renewable Energy Waste management, CO2 and cogeneration  The undesirable environmental effects of industrial processes and atmospheric pollution in particular, have become a topic of increasing public concern in the new millennium. Among the most notable polluters in Canada in 2006 were electric power generators: ATCO, Emera (Nova Scotia Power), Ontario Power Generation, SaskPower and TransAlta, mining companies: HudBay Minerals, Teck Cominco, Vale Inco and Xstrata, oil and gas companies: Imperial Oil, Shell Canada, and Trans Canada, oil sands companies: Syncrude and Suncor and the manufacturing enterprise, SMC Canada.McClearn, Matthew, What Are Canada’s Industrial Polluters Doing to Reduce Emissions, Canadian Business Magazine, 27 October 2008, pp. 55-73. Efforts to reduce the release of CO2 gas into the atmosphere lead to the initiation of the Weyburn-Midale CO2 Project in Saskatchewan in 2000. Presently the world’s largest CO2 sequestration effort, this $80 million undertaking involves the injection of waste CO2 gas from industrial processes into the ground for storage instead its release into the atmosphere. There are presently two underground sequestration facilities, one at Weyburn operated by Encana and the other at Midale operated by Apache Canada. In recent years bio-waste has been used for the production of heat and electricity. Sanitary landfill sites are notable in this regard. Often, systems for the collection of methane gas are progressively installed as the sites are filled. This gas is then used at on site cogeneration facilities for the production of heat and electricity. A number of landfill sites including those in Kanata, Petrolia, Watford and Napanee, Ontario and Sainte-Sophie, Drummondville and Magog in Quebec have been selected for the location of cogeneration facilities. In Ottawa the cogeneration facility at the Pickard (Sewage Treatment) Centre which has been in operation since 1998, provides all the heat and electrical energy needed to operate the centre. Ostara Nutrient Recovery Technologies Inc. of Vancouver has developed techniques to recover phosphorus and other nutrients from waste water. Since 2007, these have been put to use at the Gold Bar Treatment Plant in Edmonton, the world's first industrial scale waste-water nutrient treatment facility. The recovered products are recycled and sold as environmentally safe commercial fertilizer. Other Ostara nutrient recovery projects are underway at Lulu Island (Vancouver), Penticton, B.C. and in the US.website, www.ostara.com  Materials and industrial processes – 3D printing  Efforts to save fuel have also led to efforts to reduce the weight of vehicles through the increased use of composite material. Aircraft manufacturers have been especially notable in this regard and produced new large but relatively light aircraft such as the Boeing B-787 Dreamliner with this new material. Orders for this new machine have been made by a number of major world airlines, including Air Canada. In 2008, Bombardier of Montreal announced the production of the new C Series of 100- to 130-seat passenger jets which will also make extensive use of composites. They will also be used extensively in the 7000 and 8000 series of long range business jets announced by that company in 2010. 3D printing has become an important industrial process in Canada. The technique uses a computer to drive the 3D printing device. This machine builds 3D shaped objects through successive passes of a \\"printing head\\" which lays down layers of plastic or other material to progressively build a 3D physical object. As of 2010, about 100, 3D printers were in use with manufacturing enterprises in Canada. The techniques of diamond mining have been introduced to Canada in recent years. Over 600 kimberlite formations have been found throughout Canada. Open pit mining techniques have been used to produce diamonds from two of these, Ekati, beginning in 1998 and Diavik in 2003.Diamond Mining in Canada - Overview Nanotechnology Nanotechnology involves the manipulation of atoms and molecules to produce processes and products for human use. At present, the field is the subject of much research, but the use of these processes and products in Canada is not yet widespread. However the technology remains important because of its potential for great future influence. Some nano-products have made their way to the market in items such as cosmetics, and certain industrial products available in Canada. Most of the activity in Canada is found in research. In 2001, the Canadian government established the National Institute for Nanotechnology in Edmonton. The Institute conducts nano-research in a number of fields including the life sciences, supramolecular assembly, molecular scale devices and nano-sensors. As of 2010, a number of Canadian universities offer engineering degrees in nanotechnology. Of particular note is the Waterloo Institute for Nanotechnology which will be in operation in 2011 and will conduct research related to nano-engineered materials, nano-electronics design and fabrication, nano-instrumentation and nano-biosystems. The use of nanomaterials is not without controversy. As of February 2009, the Government of Canada requires all industries to report the use of nanomaterials in their products. In 2010 the government banned the use of manufactured nano-materials and nanotechnology in organic food production.Website, Friends of the Earth Nanotechnology Project, Canada bans nano in organics, nano.foe.org.au Architecture, public works and heavy engineering The construction of skyscrapers has continued apace in recent years with Toronto and Calgary accounting for most of the new structures. These include: Bankers Hall West, Calgary, 2000, the TransCanada Tower, Calgary, 2001, One Wall Centre, Vancouver, 2001, One King Street West, Toronto, 2005, West 1, Toronto, 2005, Harbourview Estates 2, Toronto, 2005, Residences of College Park 1, Toronto, 2006, Living Shangri-La, Vancouver, 2008, the Hilton Fallsview Hotel Tower, Niagara Falls, 2008, Quantum 2 (Minto Midtown), Toronto, 2008, the Bay Adelaide Centre West, Toronto, 2009, the RBC Centre, Toronto, 2009, Success, Toronto, 2009, Montage, Toronto, 2009, the Ritz-Carlton, Toronto, 2010, Centennial Place, Calgary, 2010, Maple Leaf Square North and South, Toronto, 2010, Jamieson Place, Calgary, 2010, Festival Tower, Toronto, 2010, The Bow (skyscraper), Calgary, 2011, Trump International Hotel and Tower, Toronto, 2011, The Uptown Residences, Toronto, 2011, Eighth Avenue Place (Calgary), 2011, the Four Seasons, Toronto, 2011, The Private Residences, Vancouver, 2011, the Burano, Toronto, 2011, Absolute World North and South, Mississauga, 2011, the Marriott Courtyard Hotel, Montreal, 2012, the Shangri-La Toronto, 2012, and the L Tower, Toronto, 2012. New hydro- electric projects have been completed as well including the 230-MW Rocher-de- Grand-Mère station, on Quebec's Saint-Maurice River (2004). New bridges and roads of note include the Golden Ears Bridge, Vancouver, 2009, the Middle Arm Bridge, Vancouver, 2009 the North Arm Bridge, Vancouver, 2009 and the Sea to Sky Highway, Vancouver/Whistler, 2009. In 2009, in northern Quebec, Hydro- Québec initiated construction of the C$6 billion Romaine River Complex, a series of four rock filled hydro generating dams that will be completed between 2014 and 2020.Website, ENR.com, enr.ecnext.com., Hydro-Québec Launches Four-Dam Project on Romaine River, 17 June 2009 A different type of public facility was introduced to the citizens of Toronto in 2010, when the city approved a contract for the installation of 20 self-cleaning public toilets. The first of their kind in Canada, each of the devices, which are placed throughout the city, resembles a bus shelter. The user pays 25 cents for twenty minutes of occupancy. The facility cleans itself automatically after each use.  Medicine  In 2001, the Federal government created Canada Health Infoway, in independent, not-for-profit, federally funded organization composed of the 14 Canadian federal, provincial and territorial Deputy Ministers of health. Infoway has a mandate to accelerate the Canada-wide use of electronic health records and electronic health information systems. As of 2008, more than $1.3 billion has been invested in the system. By 2010, Infoway plans to have electronic health records for 50% of the population available to authorized health professionals, and expects to have electronic health records for all Canadians by 2016.Canada Health Infoway The project involves undertakings in a number of fields, including diagnostic imaging systems, drug information systems, telehealth, laboratory information systems and public health surveillance. Telus, one of Canada's largest telephone companies, announced an agreement with Microsoft of Canada for the use of the latters' HealthVault (2007) consumer health records software in 2009. Telus intends to use the software to allow its 11 million Canadian subscribers to access information relating to their health care. Medical technology in Ontario was improved in 2009 with the implementation of the government operated ePrescribing system a service that allows doctors to send prescriptions for patient pharmaceuticals directly to the pharmacist through a private computer network. This technique eliminates the problem with illegible handwriting, thus improving patient safety. The system has been initially introduced in Sault Ste. Marie and Collingwood with plans for making it available province- wide by 2012. eHealth Ontario, announced in 2010, the signing of a C$46 million contract for the establishment of a diabetes registry, for the management of patients with this disease. The registry will eventually be expanded for the management of patients with other chronic diseases. Since 2008, Real Time Radiology (based in Mississauga, Ontario) has provided interpretation of medical images to remote sites on a Canada-wide basis. Through use of the Internet and a highly automated computer process, a team of 50 radiologists working for the company across Canada interprets medical images sent from distant locations where the services of a radiologist are not available. The results are returned electronically to the remote locations and form the basis for patient treatment there. The Gattuso Rapid Diagnostic Centre at the Princess Margaret Hospital in Toronto, through the acquisition of new diagnostic equipment that can prepare tissue samples for pathological analysis within hours, began offering same day breast cancer diagnosis for patients in 2009. Techniques for the mass production of drugs were improved in the early part of the new century. In Ste. Foy, Quebec, the international drug maker GlaxoSmithKline established a manufacturing complex for the mass production of vaccines. As of 2009, the facility is capable of producing 14,000,000 doses per month. The facility may be used for the production of a vaccine for the H1N1 flu virus for the entire population of Canada (around 35,000,000 people as of 2014), should that become necessary. Also in 2009, public preparations for a possible pandemic included the placement of containers of liquid hand sanitizer for use in public places. The PharmaTrust prescription medication dispending machine was introduced to the Canadian public in 2008. The apparatus, which physically resembles and functions like an ATM or soft drink dispenser, allows a user to purchase and receive medically approved prescription drugs, without visiting a pharmacy. Developed by PCA Services Inc. of Oakville, Ontario, one of the first has been installed in the Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, in Toronto. Lasers made their way into routine dentistry by the middle of the first decade, offering faster treatments, less pain and more precise results. They are used to remove tartar, treat soft tissues such as gums and to prepare cavities for filling. Of particular interest in the latter instance is the fact that this treatment is so painless that the use of a needle to inject a local anesthetic is usually unnecessary. Laser treatment results in little bleeding, a lower risk of infection and a quicker healing. Another innovation was the use of computer milled ceramic implants for repairing cavities. The use of a non-toxic chemical such as hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide for tooth bleaching has become popular in the new century. In 2002, two Vancouver doctors, dermatologist Alastair Carruthers and ophthalmologist Jean Carruthers, pioneered the cosmetic use of the well known botulinum toxin. The pair noticed that subcutaneous injections of small amounts of the toxin had the effect of removing age wrinkles from the skin. The Botox procedure, as it became known, quickly gained popularity around the world. Commercial DNA profiling has become available in Canada in recent years. For a fee, it is possible to order a number of specific tests including those for paternity, maternity, siblingship and ancestry. Companies offering this service include Genetrack Biolabs established in Vancouver, B.C. in 2003 and DNA Canada of Kingston, Ontario, established in 2005.DNA Canada website Established in 2002 in Burnaby, British Columbia, Lifebank Cryogenics Corporation provides, on a commercial basis, a client-based service for the processing and cryogenic storage of stem cells from the umbilical cords of new-born babies. The cells may be of help in the treatment of disease that might affect the donor.Lifebank Cryogenics Corporation  Domestic and consumer technology  Domestic construction has witnessed the introduction of improved building techniques and the smart home (home automation). Both the hydraulic lift and the concrete pump/crane, are now commonly used for home construction. Furthermore, homes are built with the electronics necessary for Internet connection throughout the premises. Household systems, such as heating and cooling, lighting, communications, entertainment and even food storage and cooking are now all linked to each other through the web. In the kitchen the glass-topped stove has become popular. The living room has seen the introduction of the very large flat screen, digital plasma TV, LCD TV and LED TV technologies, which have undergone dramatic price reduction in the last few years and have replaced the cathode-ray TV in consumer appliance/electronic stores. Also popular with consumers is the iPod portable music player introduced to Canadians in 2001 and the iPhone which was made available to Canadians by Rogers Wireless in 2008. The digital camera which was introduced to Canadians in the eighties has for the most part replaced the film camera in recent years. The electronic book or E-book has gained a place in Canada beginning with the introduction of the Sony Librie reader in 2004 and the Kindle in 2009. In 2010 the iPad wireless web surfing device became available to Canadians. Other such devices have been introduced in Canada including the BlackBerry PlayBook (available in 2011). The Blu-ray Disc and associated player have been marketed in Canada since 2009. The Guitar Hero music video game released in 2007 has enjoyed great success in Canada as has the Wii video game released that same year. Although 3D video games based on anaglyph image technology have been available in Canada since their introduction to the market in 1987, their popularity increased in 2009 partly as a result of marketing efforts by the maker of the 3D film Avatar. Popular formats include Windows (3D), PS3 (3D), PSP, Wii, Xbox 360 (3D), DS and iPhone. Users must wear special glasses with a different coloured lens over each eye in order to experience the 3D effect. In 2008, the large Canadian banks, including the Bank of Nova Scotia, the Royal Bank of Canada, the Toronto-Dominion Bank and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, began issuing Visa credit cards with an embedded microchip for enhanced security. Also in 2008, MasterCard Canada introduced the PayPass electronic payment system to Canada. The system uses a card/tag/phone equipped with an embedded computer chip and radio frequency antennae which is tapped on a PayPass reader at participating grocery stores, convenience stores, fast food restaurants or gas stations. The card/tag/phone, wirelessly transmits information about the customer to the reader which in turn electronically charges the appropriate sum to the customer's account. A similar concept using cell phones equipped with Near Field Communications (NFC) was introduced in 2009. Known as payWave, the technique is the result of cooperation between Visa, the Royal Bank of Canada and Rogers Communications. It is intended for fast, mobile, low-cost \\"micro-payment\\" transactions of items such as fast food, coffee, and subway tokens. Beginning in 2006, omega-3 oil became an additive in a number of foods sold in Canada. The personal blood level alcohol tester or breathalyser was introduced to Canadians in 2010. The device, known as the BAQ Tracker, works the same way as those used by police. The user blows into a tube on the small portable hand-held machine and a digital readout of his or her blood alcohol level instantly appears on a display. Developed by Ladybug Technologies of Cambridge, Ontario, it sells for about $300.Adam McDowell, Know Your Limit (to three decimal places), National Post, 4 December 2010  Defence and security  In the 21st century, Canada's government has shown renewed interest in the acquisition of military technology, especially with its commitment to the war in Afghanistan. Equipment has been improved, including the CF-18 fighter with addition of laser-guided bombs and there are plans to update the Aurora patrol aircraft. The air force has also taken possession of the gigantic new C-17 Globemaster III long-range transport aircraft and has begun to renew the fleet of Hercules transport aircraft. The army has acquired the new Leopard 2 tank and C-777 long-range gun, and in 2009 announced the acquisition of the Close Combat Vehicle. In 2003, the Forces took possession of their first tactical unmanned aerial vehicle (TUAV), the French-designed CU-161 Sperwer, and the Heron UAV in February 2009. Used for the war in Afghanistan, these machines provide an intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capability for the Forces. In 2008, the Air Force announced that it would acquire its first attack helicopters (Griffons equipped with light machine guns) for service there as well. In 2006, the Navy undertook the Halifax Class Modernization/Frigate Equipment Life Extension Project (HCM/FELIX) to modernize its 12 Halifax Class Frigates. New equipment will include improved computer fire control systems, sensors and the decoy-based Rheinmettal Multi Ammunition Softkill System, a passive missile defence system.Brine, LCdr O.J., Modernizing the backbone of the surface fleet, The Maple Leaf, 3 June 2009, p. 10. Acquisitions pending include the CH-148 Cyclone ASW helicopter, the Chinook helicopter, new Arctic patrol vessels for the navy and a new ice breaker for the Canadian Coast Guard. In July 2010, the Government of Canada announced the C$9 billion purchase of 65 F-35A fighters for delivery beginning in 2016. In 2009, the Canadian government announced a C$880 million upgrade, including new facilities, of the signal intelligence capability of the Communications Security Establishment Canada in Ottawa, to be completed by 2015. The importance of electronic warfare on the battlefield, as demonstrated in the War in Afghanistan, was highlighted in April 2010 by the formation of 21 Electronic Warfare Regiment at CFB Kingston. The unit, the first new regiment to be formed in the Canadian Army since WWII, is being equipped with the most modern electronic warfare technology and will practice both defensive and offensive electronic warfare.Website (blog), Bill Robinson, 21 EW Regiment stands up, Lux Ex Umbra, 26 June 2010, luxexumbra.blogspot.com The Polar Epsilon project, approved in 2005 and slated to be fully operational by 2011, uses Radarsat 2 to provide military commanders with imagery of Canada's Arctic. Another surveillance project, Polar Breeze (until recently classified secret), will use shore-based sea surface search radar, satellite-based (Radarsat 2) imagery and underwater listening devices to monitor sea surface and underwater traffic in the choke points of the Northwest Passage. The Canadian Forces have also acquired updated electronic equipment to conduct more advanced electronic warfare to face the new cybernetic threat and conduct cybernetic warfare (cyber-warfare).Canadian Armed Forces website The Taser (also known as the conducted energy weapon) has been adopted for use by Canadian police forces, including the RCMP, in recent years. The technology presently deployed was developed in the US in 1999. Intended for use as a \\"non-lethal\\" weapon, the Taser fires darts trailing wires connected to a battery in the hand-held pistol. The darts strike and lodge themselves in the suspect. The battery delivers, through the wires, a jolt of electricity that incapacitates the suspect. Its use in Canada has led to considerable controversy following the deaths of four individuals who were tasered by police in separate incidents in 2007. End note In the earlier parts of Canada's history, the state often played a crucial role in the diffusion of these technologies, in some cases through a monopoly enterprise, in others with a private \\"partner\\". In more recent times, the need for the role of the state has diminished in the presence of a larger private sector. In the latter part of the 20th century, there is evidence that Canadian values prefer public expenditures on social programmes at the expense of public spending on the maintenance and expansion of public technical infrastructure. This can be seen in the fact that in 2008 the Federation of Canadian Municipalities estimated that it would take $123 billion to restore and repair aging urban infrastructure across Canada.

Basketball career Player Black enrolled at Kansas in the fall of 1920 and became eligible to play for the men's basketball team in his sophomore year of 1921–22. Playing for Hall of Fame coach Phog Allen, he helped guide the Jayhawks to three Missouri Valley Conference (MVC) championships and two retroactively named national championships during his three-year playing career. Kansas accumulated a 49–6 overall record (47–3 in conference play) while Black played for the team. He was a two-time all- conference, two-time All-American and one-time Helms Foundation National Player of the Year. In 1921–22, the Jayhawks went 16–2 (15–1 MVC) to win their first of two consecutive national championships and first of six consecutive conference championships. It was their best record in seven years, and Black's ability at the guard position alongside Paul Endacott was the biggest reason for their success. The following year, Black's junior season, Kansas finished 17–1 (16–0 MVC). In 1923–24, his senior year, Kansas failed to win their third straight national championship when they finished 16–3. However, they finished 15–1 and claimed another Missouri Valley Conference title. Black was named a Helms Foundation All-American in his final two seasons. Helms also honored him as their national player of the year following the 1923–24 season, making him the second player in a row from Kansas to be given that honor (Endacott earned it in 1922–23) and also the school's second overall recipient. Coach Several years after finishing his playing career at Kansas, Black became the head coach for the men's basketball team at Nebraska. He served at this position from 1926–27 through 1931–32 and compiled an overall record of 51–57, including a 5–7 record against his alma mater.

The story is a retelling of the story of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table. According to her own statements in the introduction, The Sword and the Circle follows the myths and folktales of King Arthur, crediting inspiration primarily from Sir Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur; other sources include Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae, English ballads, and Irish folktales.Sutcliff, Rosemary: The Sword and the Circle pp. 7-8 She contrasts this telling of the King Arthur story with her previous novels, The Lantern Bearers and Sword at Sunset, which were more an attempt to connect with a concrete historical figure behind the folktales. Plot summary The novel is broken into thirteen chapters, with the first five being the development of King Arthur's background, while the remaining are nearly stand-alone stories covering the exploits of different knights. He is shown as the son of Uther Pendragon, begot upon Lady Igraine with the assistance of Merlin. Merlin did not feature in Sutcliff's previous Arthurian stories of Sword at Sunset, but is shown here as being the driving force behind the ascension of King Arthur and his court. Merlin is depicted as being descended from the Lordly Ones, or the 'Little Dark People', as Sutcliff commonly refers to the possible original inhabitants of Great Britain. He orchestrates Arthur's upbringing under Sir Ector, alongside his foster brother Sir Kay. Arthur's identity as ruler of Britain is revealed when he pulls the Sword from the Stone, but he later receives Excalibur, a different sword, from the Lady in the Lake. The rest of the novel's chapters cover many of the other classic Arthurian characters and tales, including: the origins of Lancelot of the Lake, as well as his encounters with Elaine;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight; Beaumains, the Kitchen Knight; Tristan and Iseult, in a retelling nearly identical to Sutcliff's earlier novel of the same name, albeit a much shorter version; Geraint and Enid; Gawain and the Loathly Lady; and finally the arrival of Percival at Arthur's court, which is connected by Merlin's previous prophecies to presage the beginning of the Round Table's downfall. The book stops here, to be continued in The Light Beyond the Forest and The Road to Camlann.

The term was coined in Latin by Sir Francis Bacon and used in his Novum Organum, one of the earliest treatises arguing the case for the logic and method of modern science. Overview The term is one of four such \\"idols\\" which represent \\"idols and false notions which are now in possession of the human understanding, and have taken deep root therein\\". Because of them, \\"truth can hardly find entrance\\" in people's minds, and Bacon predicted that even after the \\"instauration of the sciences\\" which he proposes, they will \\"meet and trouble us, unless men being forewarned of the danger fortify themselves as far as may be against their assaults\\".Novum Organum, Aphorism XXXVIII They are in other words problems for science, and successful modern scientific method will need to try to avoid them. Besides idola fori, there are also idola tribus (Idols of the Tribe, coming from human nature itself), idola specus, (Idols of the cave, coming from the tendencies of particular individuals or groups of people) and idola theatri (Idols of the theatre, caused by the influence of philosophers and systems of thought). Together the four idols are referred to as the Idols of the Mind (idola mentis). Bacon's description Bacon said that the Idols of the Market Place were given this name by him \\"on account of the commerce and consort of men there. For it is by discourse that men associate, and words are imposed according to the apprehension of the vulgar. And therefore the ill and unfit choice of words wonderfully obstructs the understanding\\".Novum Organum, Aphorism XLIII Bacon said that there were two basic kinds of Idol of the Market Place:Novum Organum, Aphorism LX *The first are \\"names of things which do not exist (for as there are things left unnamed through lack of observation, so likewise are their names which result from fantastic suppositions and to which nothing in reality corresponds)\\" But this first kind \\"is more easily expelled, because to get rid of them it is only necessary that all theories should be steadily rejected and dismissed as obsolete.\\" *The second are \\"names of things which exist, but yet confused and ill-defined, and hastily and irregularly derived from realities.\\" According to Bacon, it is the second class, \\"which springs out of a faulty and unskillful abstraction\\", is \\"intricate and deeply rooted\\". This is because it has to do with the way words themselves can guide thinking. Nevertheless, there are \\"certain degrees of distortion and error\\". Bacon says that \\"some notions are of necessity a little better than others, in proportion to the greater variety of subjects that fall within the range of the human sense.\\" Bacon recognized that the normal approach of \\"learned men\\" was to be careful about definitions and explanations, setting the matter right \\"in some things\\". But nevertheless, \\"words plainly force and overrule the understanding, and throw all into confusion, and lead men away into numberless empty controversies and idle fancies.\\" Historical context That errors inevitably come from the imperfect generalizations in natural languages, and that philosophers or scientists must be careful of this danger, is an ancient theme of philosophy. It was for example a problem appreciated by Aristotle, and had been noted by William of Occam in the Middle Ages. But Bacon's idola fori is the best-known example of the increased seriousness given by early modern humanists to problematic uses of language. After Bacon, this concern was further emphasized by authors such as Thomas Hobbes and John Locke.

This Latin term was coined by Sir Francis Bacon and used in his Novum Organum, one of the earliest treatises arguing the case for the logic and method of modern science. He described them as deriving from \\"the peculiar constitution, mental or bodily, of each individual; and also in education, habit, and accident\\".Novum Organum, Aphorism LIII Overview The idola specus are prejudices, by which individuals inappropriately extend norms or tenets that derive his or her own culture and social group, or to his or her own preferences. Racism, sexism and, more generally just \\"biases\\" are examples of idola specus, but the concept goes beyond them to the criticism of all forms of irreflexive subjectivity or individual predisposition.

In more detail, Bacon said that there are a \\"great number and variety\\" of idols of the cave but he choose to select example which give \\"the most important caution\\", and which \\"have most effect in disturbing the clearness of the understanding\\". He judged that they \\"grow for the most part either out of the predominance of a favorite subject, or out of an excessive tendency to compare or to distinguish, or out of partiality for particular ages, or out of the largeness or minuteness of the objects contemplated.\\"Novum Organum, Aphorism LVIII Concerning these most important variants he wrote in more detail: *One common reason for a prejudice is that people \\"become attached to certain particular sciences and speculations, either because they fancy themselves the authors and inventors thereof, or because they have bestowed the greatest pains upon them and become most habituated to them.\\"Novum Organum, Aphorism LIV *Bacon remarks that with respect to philosophy and science, there are two radically different types of minds. These manifest idola specus in different ways, but both suffer from it. Some \\"steady and acute\\" minds are \\"stronger and apter to mark the differences of things\\", fixing upon \\"the subtlest distinctions\\". Others are \\"lofty and discursive\\" and more prone to mark resemblances, recognizing and putting together \\"the finest and most general resemblances\\". \\"Both kinds, however, easily err in excess, by catching the one at gradations, the other at shadows.\\"Novum Organum, Aphorism LV *Bacon also notes another distinction which causes different manifestations of idola specus: \\"There are found some minds given to an extreme admiration of antiquity, others to an extreme love and appetite for novelty; but few so duly tempered that they can hold the mean, neither carping at what has been well laid down by the ancients, nor despising what is well introduced by the moderns.\\"Novum Organum, Aphorism LVI *Finally, another common cause of idola specus when looking specifically at \\"contemplations of nature\\" is that this sometimes requires looking at things in their \\"simple form\\". This breaks up and distracts the understanding. Bacon mentions Leucippus and Democritus as compared with the other philosophies. For that school is so busied with the particles that it hardly attends to the structure. On the other hand, \\"contemplations of nature and bodies in their composition and configuration overpower and dissolve the understanding\\". And some contemplators of nature become \\"so lost in admiration of the structure that they do not penetrate to the simplicity of nature\\". As a way of avoiding these problems, Bacon recommends that these two types of contemplation should be \\"alternated and taken by turns, so that the understanding may be rendered at once penetrating and comprehensive, and the inconveniences above mentioned, with the idols which proceed from them, may be avoided\\".Novum Organum, Aphorism LVII Bacon also drew general advice for more methodical future study of nature, aimed at avoiding the idols of the cave: \\"generally let every student of nature take this as a rule: that whatever his mind seizes and dwells upon with peculiar satisfaction is to be held in suspicion, and that so much the more care is to be taken in dealing with such questions to keep the understanding even and clear.\\" See also *Idols of the mind References External links *Novum Organum (in Latin) *New Organon (1863 English translation) Category:Prejudices Category:Inductive fallacies Category:Types of scientific fallacy Category:Francis Bacon ","title":"Idola specus"},{"id":"29991427","text":"Steffen Wolfgang George Thomas (January 7, 1906 - January 27, 1990) was an artist and poet. He was born in Fürth, Germany, but lived most of his adult life in Atlanta, Georgia. His most notable pieces are public monuments; however, he also worked in other media (including, but not limited to painting, sculpture, mosaic, printmaking, encaustic, and watercolor). His art is greatly influenced by Expressionism. History and background Thomas was born in 1906 in Fürth, Germany. He expressed a strong passion for art from an early age. After Thomas’s father witnessed his son carving angel faces in the marble foundation of their home, he later apprenticed Thomas to a stone carver, providing Thomas a useful skill, but also a creative outlet to cultivate his artistic talents.Steffen Thomas: Georgia's German Expressionist. The Museum of Arts and Sciences, 2000, p.7. Following his apprenticeship, Thomas was accepted to the School of Applied Arts, Nuremberg, and then to the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich. His focus was drawing and sculpture based on the classical model. Thomas achieved “Master” status at age twenty-one and was given his own studio. Thomas quickly tired of his artistic life in Germany and longed for greater endeavors. In 1928, Thomas realized his dream of moving to America. He spent brief periods in Florida, Illinois, and Alabama, but eventually settled in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1930. In 1931 Thomas created a bust of journalist Henry W. Grady which became the central display of the Georgia Newspaper Hall of Fame. A few houses down from Thomas lived a school teacher named Sara Douglass. Thomas was introduced to Douglass through her mother over a conversation about gardening, and after a two-month courtship they were married (1933) at Fulton County Courthouse. Thomas briefly returned to Germany after his move to America, but did not visit again until 1972. While his family remained in Germany, Thomas found his artistic life belonged in his adoptive country and he became an American citizen in 1935.Aiches, Alan Z. and Anthony F. Janson. The Art of Steffen Thomas. The Steffen Thomas Museum and Archives, S.T.A.R. of GA, L.P, 1997, p.10-11. In 1941, Sara and Steffen purchased fifty acres near Stone Mountain, Georgia, and subsequently built a home and artist studio. The couple raised four children, Steffen, Robin, Douglass, and Lisa. Thomas continually worked on the complex by hand, and it became a popular destination, visited by friends, family, and tourists. Thomas supported his family through public commissions and portraiture. Among the most notable monuments are the Alabama Memorial (1951) installed at the Vicksburg National Military Park, the statue of Eugene Talmadge, Georgia State Capitol Collection, and the Trilon (c.1950) located on the corner of Peachtree and 15th Street in Atlanta. Thomas also created numerous busts commemorating prominent Georgians: Chief Justice Richard Russell Jr., Georgia State College for Women (currently Georgia College and State University), Milledgeville, GA; Martha Berry, Berry Schools (currently Berry College), Berry, GA; Joel Chandler Harris, Atlanta Public Schools; Moina Michael, “The Poppy Lady”, Georgia State Capitol, Atlanta, GA; portrait head of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Little White House, Warm Springs, GA; and George Washington Carver, Tuskegee Institute (currently Tuskegee University), Tuskegee, AL. Thomas found acclaimed success with public works; however, with the refusal of his proposal for the Stone Mountain Civil War Memorial (a twenty year plan in the making), he became disenchanted with seeking public commissions, and naturally turned his focus toward creating works to express his personal artistic ideals. Essentially, he was free to create art without the restraints often associated with commissioned projects.Aiches, Steffen Thomas, 11. From his days at the Academy, Thomas did not take criticism well. He lost a Palm Beach commission when he substituted his own imagery in place of the Gothic specifications of the patron. He was notoriously hypersensitive to gallery owners, collectors, and patrons that did not appreciate his art. Thomas had a distinct artistic vision that was difficult to change once he set his mind to creating.Georgia's German Expressionist, 10. Art Historian Anthony Janson comments on Thomas's attitude toward his art, “What better way to shield one’s work (and oneself) from criticism that to avoid the confrontation altogether by keeping all but true believers from seeing it?”Aiches, Steffen Thomas, 13. In 1970, Thomas returned to a midtown Atlanta studio, selling his Stone Mountain estate. He continued his work until his death with the same passion and intensity from his student days. Artistic relevance Thomas was formally trained in sculpture, drawing, and the classical arts at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich. While in Germany, his art wholly reflected the classical tradition; however, by the time he settled in Atlanta, his aesthetic made a change toward the abstract. From his student days he was largely influenced by other artistic movements, but especially by Expressionism and post-Cubism. He also experimented with materials and worked with every available medium, a technique he continued throughout his career. Creativity was first and foremost the driving factor for Thomas.Aiches, Steffen Thomas, 19.Pamina, (1955), Steffen Thomas Museum of Art, Permanent Collection Thomas admitted that as a young man he did not understand the importance of the Expressionists’ vision, but later in life he fully recognized the influence of the movement on his own work. Thomas came to the United States in search of the Romantic ideal of prosperity and freedom. Once he arrived, he took advantage of every opportunity available. He served as Arts Supervisor for the National Youth Administration (WPA program), from 1939–1941, served as a representative of the Georgia Artists Association with the Georgia Art Commission, and on the Advisory Board of UNICEF.Georgia Masterpieces: Selected Works from Georgia's Museums. Georgia Council for the Arts, 2009, p. 79. Thomas had an affinity for representing the female form in his art. Dorothy Joiner notes the “preponderance of female subjects [in Thomas’s art]: goddesses, nudes, mothers, contemporary celebrities…famous women from literature, unidentified girls.”Georgia's German Expressionist, 11. Thomas was enraptured by the feminine form from his earliest artistic period. As a student, Thomas was asked to create the highest form of labor, in which he responded by creating a mother and child figure, calling it Laboré (1927–28). Laboré represents Thomas’s respect and admiration for motherhood and the relationship between a mother and child. This theme reoccurs throughout Thomas’s artistic career. Art historian Anthony Janson terms the women figures in Thomas’s oeuvre as muses. They tend to resemble his wife, Sara, although the muses appear in works prior to their introduction. The feminine figures are likened to the classical tradition but are not specifically based on classical notions. They are classically inspired, but stylistically modern. For Thomas, the muses represent femininity, but also humanity. Thomas also explored subjects such as philosophy, religion, literature, and mythology. While he was largely influenced by his early training and the Expressionist movement, his work was often dictated by subjects he found intriguing. He believed that art must transcend time and culture; therefore, he simplified and abstracted his own works to universally translate to the viewer. While his work is sometimes difficult to interpret literally, he often includes symbols or imagery portraying universally understood emotions.Aiches, Steffen Thomas, 21. Due to Thomas’s use of symbol and abstraction, Alan Aiches places him stylistically and philosophically between the movements of Die Brücke and Der Blaue Reiter, two generations of German art. While Thomas is not directly aligned with a specific German or American movement of art, he is considered to be an Expressionist. However, he was influenced by art from many periods dating back to antiquity. He was not characteristically German Expressionist, although, the genre greatly influenced his creations.Aiches, Steffen Thomas, 12. Aiches writes the following: “When viewing and contemplating the works of the early twentieth century German Expressionists, I feel the same intense and simultaneous infusion of philosophy and craft that is so apparent in Thomas’ sculpture and painting.” Aiches, Steffen Thomas, 5. Thomas worked in various media: watercolor, sculpture, encaustic, welded copper, mosaic, and drawing to name a few, but he also repeatedly created frames for his pieces. The carvings incorporated mosaics and mixed media, and often were recycled from discarded objects. The desire to make frames correlated with Thomas’s need to experiment and manipulate materials. He also added natural elements such as sand to his works to create dimension and depth.Aiches, Steffen Thomas, 22. Janson describes Thomas’s style: “There is a consistent artist personality at work, even though his output is extremely varied. It shows an endless fascination with the possibilities to be explored in different media, whose techniques he set out to master with real virtuosity. This was, by all accounts, a counterpart to his innate curiosity. More generally, it was tied to the unfolding of his imagination, which took place in the peace of self-imposed isolation.” Thomas continued to create art well into the last years of his life, although, his sight and health were failing. However, in his final years, Thomas returned to central themes found throughout his oeuvre indicating his lifelong fervor for the creative.Aiches, Steffen Thomas, 15. Thomas’s art has achieved numerous awards and honors throughout the state of Georgia, such as Atlanta Beautiful Commission, Award for Excellence from the Atlanta Urban Design Commission, and the Governor’s Award in the Arts. His art can be found in the collections at the High Museum of Art, Atlanta; the Georgia Museum of Art, Athens; the Georgia Capitol Museum, Atlanta; the Museum of Arts and Sciences, Macon; and Lamar Dodd Center, Lagrange. Steffen Thomas Museum of Art Interior of Steffen Thomas Museum of Art (2011)Thomas’s wife and lifelong muse, Sara, conceived the idea to create a museum dedicated to the memory of her husband and his art. She founded the Steffen Thomas Museum and Archives (Steffen Thomas Museum of Art) in Buckhead, Georgia, in 1997. The museum houses an extensive collection of Thomas’s art and is dedicated to the research and documentation of his life’s work. The Steffen Thomas Museum of Art is one of the few organizations in the country dedicated to one artist.Georgia's German Expressionist, 18. The Steffen Thomas Museum of Art’s mission is “dedicated to providing art education programs and projects for children and families in rural Northeast and Middle Georgia communities. Using Georgia artist Steffen Thomas's work as examples of creative expression the museum provides opportunities for children to develop their own talents, a deeper understanding of themselves, of their connections to all living things and of their responsibility for preserving the environment.” Elizabeth d’Huart, previous Director of the Steffen Thomas Museum of Art, writes of the artist: “Thomas’s early work is classical in style, particularly his sculptures in cast bronze, reflecting his rigorous European training. As the years passed, his style evolved, becoming looser and more interpretive, moving from realistic to expressionist exuberance. His mosaics and watercolors convey his passion for light and color, and his sculptures provide excellent examples of captured and arrested motion…His interest in politics, philosophy, and religion are evidenced by themes and motifs that are represented and repeated in a multiplicity of genres and mediums.”  Notes  References Aiches, Alan Z., and Anthony F.

He is an author of Schwedler's theorem, a theory defining relation between shear force and bending moment. Life and career Schwedler was the son of a cabinetmaker who died when he was still in school; his brother, already a construction supervisor, made it possible for him to finish his education at the City Trade School in 1842.August Hertwig, Leben und Schaffen der Reichsbahn-Brückenbauer Schwedler, Zimmermann, Labes, Schaper: Eine kurze Entwicklungsgeschichte des Brückenbaues, West Berlin: Ernst, 1950, p. 9 After a further required examination in Latin to complete the equivalent of a lower-level Gymnasium education, he spent the next ten years training as a surveyor, studying for examinations in that and in road construction, studying for a year at the Berlin Academy of Construction, and completing the examinations to be a certified building inspector and construction supervisor. One of his practical examinations was waived after he won the international competition to design a road and rail bridge across the Rhine between Cologne and Deutz.Hertwig, pp. 9-10, 13. He was then required to leave on his Wanderjahre as a journeyman; he did so with his new wife, the daughter of a teacher and organist in Buckow, whom he had met through their shared love of music and become engaged to six years before.Hertwig, p. 14. Schwedler began publishing in engineering before he completed his training, beginning with Über die statischen Prinzipien der Konstruktion eiserner Dachgebinde über weite Räume und die Entwicklung der Konstruktionssysteme aus demselben (1846). His \\"Theorie der Brückenbalkensysteme\\", published in the first year of the Zeitschrift für Bauwesen (1851), had a revolutionary impact on the construction of steel bridges.Hertwig, pp. 10, 13. But during his journeyman years he did not publish, concentrating instead on building. The City of Cologne employed him to build a stone bridge over the Sieg. He then supervised the first stage of construction of the railway between Cologne and Gießen. In 1848, Barmen, now part of Wuppertal, invited him to become its superintendent of construction, but he instead with some reluctance returned to Berlin to take a post in the Division of Construction of the Prussian Ministry of Trade. He spent the remainder of his career as a civil servant, becoming chief engineer for the Royal Prussian Railways and during a period of rapid expansion: between 1860 and 1890 the Prussian railway system grew from less than 5,800 km of rails to more than 26,300 km, from approximately 600 stations to 4,200, and numerous rivers and valleys were bridged for both railways and roads.Hertwig, pp. 20-21, quoting Otto Sarrazin, a colleague of his. During that time he oversaw in some manner every major piece of construction in Prussia and subsequently the German Empire.Jan Knippers, \\"Ingenieurporträt: Johann Wilhelm Schwedler: Vom Experiment zur Berechnung\\", Deutsche Bauzeitung, 20 March 2000, pp. 105-10 (pdf) p. 110 In 1868 he was promoted to Geheimer Baurat and became the highest ranking construction employee in the Prussian Civil Service. He also returned to publishing, developing with Friedrich August von Pauli, Johann Caspar Harkort, and Heinrich Gottfried Gerber a complete theory and praxis of steel construction;Hertwig, p. 15. his Theorie der Brückenbalken-Systeme, volume 1 (1862)Petros P. Xanthakos, Theory and Design of Bridges, New York, Wiley: 1994, p. 3. and Resultate über die Konstruktion der eisernen Brücken (1865) were particularly influential. Shortly after his return to Berlin, he became an instructor at the Academy of Construction, and after 1864 he was an examiner there; his teaching greatly improved the training in the field.Hertwig, p. 20. He was on the editorial board of the Zeitschrift für Bauwesen for many years. Schwedler had three daughters and a son; however, his youngest daughter and his son died in 1863 and 1864, and his wife in 1867 after a long decline. He remarried, but his second wife died in 1892. In 1891, he had had to retire because of poor health; 3,500 fellow engineers signed a farewell testament praising his accomplishments. He died in 1894 after being housebound for several years.Hertwig, pp. 26-27. Bridge at Unterreichenbach on the Nagold Valley Railway, one of the last remaining Schwedler truss bridges Works Among Schwedler's memorable engineering feats were the design of a swinging bridge which was still in use half a century later;Hertwig, p. 24. the design for the new prayer hall of the Deutscher Dom; and a simple solution to the problem of raising the cast iron Prussian National Monument for the Liberation Wars on the Kreuzberg hill in Berlin while turning it 21°.Hertwig, pp. 25-26. Schwedler truss Schwedler invented the Schwedler truss, which was widely used worldwide in framed bridges and roofs until about 1900. It is a kind of curved chord or bowstring truss with the minimum number of diagonals, which are to bear only tension, not compression; it requires a slight downward curvature in the middle, usually replaced with extra diagonal bracing for appearance and cost saving.William Hubert Burr and Myron Samuel Falk, The Design and Construction of Metallic Bridges, New York: Wiley, 1905, repr.

Johnson, The Theory and Practice of Modern Framed Structures, Designed for the Use of Schools and for Engineers in Professional Practice, Part 1: Stresses in Simple Structures, New York: Wiley, 1904, repr. Read Books, 2010, , pp. 167-68. Schwedler himself would have preferred it to be used less on aesthetic grounds. His first use of the innovation was for the railway bridge over the Weser at Corvey, on the edge of Höxter (1864),J.W. Schwedler, \\"Schmiedeeiserne Brücken nach J.W. Schwedler's System\\", Wochenblatt herausegegeben von Mitgliedern des Architekten-Vereines zu Berlin 1 (1867) pp. 250-51, p. 251 for which he won a gold medal at the 1867 Paris International Exposition.\\"J.W. Schwedler\\", Centralblatt der Bauverwaltung 14 (1894) pp. 245-46, p. 246 One of the last remaining examples is the bridge carrying the Nagold Valley Railway over the Nagold in Unterreichenbach.Knippers, p. 107. Southern train shed, Frankfurt (Main) Hauptbahnhof Triple-hinged arch Schwedler's work with bridges and calculating the stresses on them led to a further innovation, an arched structure hinged at three points to accommodate differing stresses and changes in temperature, which functionally resembles the roofs of modern stadia. The first of these, and a prototype for the platform halls of late 19th-century stations, was his train shed for the Berlin Ostbahnhof, then known as the Schlesischer Bahnhof (1866); the last surviving example is probably the train sheds of the main station in Frankfurt am Main (1885–87).Knippers, pp. 107-08.Franziska Bollerey with Kristiana Hartmann, 200 Jahre Architektur 1740-1940: Bilder und Dokumente zur neueren Architekturgeschichte, Delft University Press, 1987, , . Schwedler cupola gas holder in Fichtestraße, Berlin, published 1876 Schwedler cupola on the gas holder Called in by the Imperial Continental Gas Association in 1863 to replace a failed roof over a telescoping gas holder, Schwedler devised a workable solution but thinking further about the problem, in 1866 published an article describing a new type of iron cupola that was simpler, lighter, and as sturdy:Hertwig, pp. 15, 20. it takes the form of an unsupported spheroidal steel vault, rather than beams, and was normally used to span distances of 25-45 m.Julius Posener, Berlin auf dem Wege zu einer neuen Architektur, Munich: Prestel, 1979, , quoted in translation in Hans Kollhoff, \\"The Metropolis as Construction: Engineering Structures in Berlin 1871-1914\\" in Berlin/New York: Like and Unlike: Essays on Architecture and Art from 1870 to the Present, ed.

The Latin was coined by Sir Francis Bacon in his Novum Organum--one of the earliest treatises arguing the case for the logic and method of modern science. Bacon described them as \\"Idols which have immigrated into men's minds from the various dogmas of philosophies, and also from wrong laws of demonstration.\\" He named them Idols of the Theater \\"because in my judgment all the received systems are but so many stage plays, representing worlds of their own creation after an unreal and scenic fashion.\\"Novum Organum, Book I, Aphorism XLIV Overview The term is one of four such \\"idols\\", that represent \\"idols and false notions\\" that are \\"in possession of the human understanding, and have taken deep root therein, not only so beset men's minds that truth can hardly find entrance, but even after entrance is obtained, they will again in the very instauration of the sciences meet and trouble us, unless men being forewarned of the danger fortify themselves as far as may be against their assaults\\".Novum Organum, Book I, Aphorism XXXVIII Of these, the Idola theatri are the most avoidable, being caused by particular historical situations, such as when there is a lot of interest in religion, and no strong monarch to repress such discussion. Besides idola theatri, there are also idola tribus (Idols of the Tribe, stemming from human nature itself), idola specus, (Idols of the cave, stemming from a person's particular tendencies), and idola fori (Idols of the Market Place, coming from the influence of our human language and its usages). Bacon's explanation According to Howard B. White: > In the famous discussion of the four idols, Bacon says that only one kind, > the Idols of the Theater, are not innate; nor do they steal \\"into the > understanding secretly.\\" Therefore, they, at least, can be removed.(N.O. > I,61) Since, alone among all the idols, they are created by philosophical > systems, alone, among all the idols, they may be removed by philosophical > systems. Obviously, the principal idol of the theater to Bacon was > Aristotle. But Aristotle was not the only example for Bacon, who wrote: > Nor is it only of the systems now in vogue, or only of the ancient sects and > philosophies, that I speak; for many more plays of the same kind may yet be > composed and in like artificial manner set forth; seeing that errors the > most widely different have nevertheless causes for the most part alike. > Neither again do I mean this only of entire systems, but also of many > principles and axioms in science, which by tradition, credulity, and > negligence have come to be received. Concerning the number of variations of this type, Bacon says furthermore: > Idols of the Theater, or of Systems, are many, and there can be and perhaps > will be yet many more. For were it not that now for many ages men's minds > have been busied with religion and theology; and were it not that civil > governments, especially monarchies, have been averse to such novelties, even > in matters speculative; so that men labor therein to the peril and harming > of their fortunes—not only unrewarded, but exposed also to contempt and > envy—doubtless there would have arisen many other philosophical sects like > those which in great variety flourished once among the Greeks. For as on the > phenomena of the heavens many hypotheses may be constructed, so likewise > (and more also) many various dogmas may be set up and established on the > phenomena of philosophy. And in the plays of this philosophical theater you > may observe the same thing which is found in the theater of the poets, that > stories invented for the stage are more compact and elegant, and more as one > would wish them to be, than true stories out of history.Novum Organum, Book > I, Aphorism LXII Nevertheless, he distinguished three types for special attention: *The Rational or Sophistical School of philosophers \\"snatches from experience a variety of common instances, neither duly ascertained nor diligently examined and weighed, and leaves all the rest to meditation and agitation of wit.\\" The most conspicuous example of this type, says Bacon, was Aristotle.Novum Organum, Book I, Aphorism LXIII *A second \\"Empirical\\" class of philosophers \\"who, having bestowed much diligent and careful labor on a few experiments, have thence made bold to educe and construct systems, wresting all other facts in a strange fashion to conformity therewith.\\" As examples, Bacon mentions the chemists or alchemists of his day and William Gilbert's work on magnets.Novum Organum, Book I, Aphorism LXVI *A third class, a Superstitious type, \\"consisting of those who out of faith and veneration mix their philosophy with theology and traditions; among whom the vanity of some has gone so far aside as to seek the origin of sciences among spirits and genii.\\" Bacon said that Pythagoras and Plato were striking examples of this problem. From \\"this unwholsome mixture of things human and divine there arises not only a fantastic philosophy but also an heretical religion.\\"Novum Organum, Book I, Aphorism LXV Bacon said that, in his time, the last type, the superstitious, was most common, and did the most harm.Novum Organum, Book I, Aphorism LXI Superstition was the subject of one of Bacon's well-known Essays, and as Howard B White points out, Bacon made it clear that he considered Catholicism, for example, to be a form of Christian superstition, and that he felt atheism to be superior to superstition. But \\"while the classics also regarded superstition as at variance with philosophy\\" they did not \\"regard it as necessary or desirable to wage an onslaught against existing superstition\\"., pages, 73, 74, 253.

It linked the stations of Ochsenzoll in Hamburg-Langenhorn with Ulzburg Süd in the district of Segeberg in Schleswig- Holstein. The northern part of the route to Norderstedt Mitte is used today by AKN Railway on behalf to VGN Norderstedt (HVV Line A2) and is mostly double- tracked. Since 1996 the southern section is part of the Hamburg U-Bahn network (Line U1). It is doubled throughout and electrified at 750 V DC via a third rail. The description Alster Northern Railway (Alsternordbahn) is still commonly used for this route. The name originates from the river Alster which flows into the river Elbe in Hamburg. History The proposal for an Alster Northern Railway was put forward by the civil engineer Heinrich Lönnies (\\"The Lion of Norderstedt\\") to implement the axis concept that the Hamburg architect and urban designer Fritz Schumacher had introduced in the 1920s. This provided for the Langenhorn–Kaltenkirchen area to be developed as an extension of the axis formed by the Hamburg U-Bahn line, which was operated by the Hamburger Hochbahn, but only as far as Ochsenzoll. There was no connecting line from there to Ulzburg and Henstedt (now Henstedt-Ulzburg). The Alster Northern Railway was opened on 17 May 1953. Though it was initially planned as a simple tramway or the like, it was built as a standard gauge light railway to EBO standards and was thus the first newly built railway line in the Federal Republic of Germany. The tracks were, and are, only attached to the north to the Hamburg-Altona–Neumünster railway (AKN) at Ulzburg Süd. In Ochsenzoll there was neither a connection to the now closed Deutsche Bundesbahn freight railway to Ohlsdorf nor to the U-Bahn line. The line was managed from the beginning by the AKN and it also supplied the staff. It was initially (until 1967) operated with new battery electric multiple units from MaK and from 1956 with MAN railbuses. From the outset, the railcars were equipped with FM radio facilities. This was the first VHF train radio in Germany. The few passing places on the single track line were fitted at that time with relapse switches, so that a low-cost train control system could be carried out with little manpower. In 1981, the ANB was taken over by the AKN, which had already supplied rollingstock from 1977 onwards, and the ANB sold its rollingstock in the same year. Meanwhile, the line—now called the A2 by Hamburger Verkehrsverbund (Hamburg Transport Association)—was shortened with the gradual extension of the U-Bahn line U1 to Garstedt in 1969 and to Norderstedt Mitte in 1996. The line was duplicated between 1992 and 1996, using the Norderstedt industrial railway (Norderstedter Industriebahn, NIB) which had run parallel to the main line between Ulzburg Süd and Friedrichsgabe since 1973, and now ends as a single track in Norderstedt Mitte station (opened in 1996), where there is a cross-platform transfer to the U-Bahn. In 1992, the infrastructure was transferred to Verkehrsgesellschaft Norderstedt (Norderstedt transport company, VGN), a subsidiary of Stadtwerke Norderstedt, the Norderstedt municipal utility. AKN continues to operate traffic on the A2 line with diesel-electric two-car multiple units (LHB VTA), with four DMUs being the property of VGN. Freight has operated only since 20 October 1971 and only on the northern part of the line, since the connection from the Hamburgische Electricitäts-Werke (Hamburg Electricity Works) was put into operation. Since 1 January 2004, it has been operated by DB Schenker Rail.  Current operations Today, the passenger traffic on the (northern) Alster Northern Railway is operated by the AKN as line A2. Trains generally run daily between 5 am and 1 am every 20 minutes. Services are thinned out after 11 pm and on Sundays to every 40 minutes. In the Monday-to-Friday peaks between 6 am and 9 am and between 4 pm and 6 pm there is a 10-minute interval service.

It was his last full-length attempt at the sonata genre, the other completed ones being the Piano Sonata No. 1 in F sharp minor (Op. 11) and the Piano Sonata No. 3 in F minor (Op. 14); he later wrote Three Piano Sonatas for the Young Op. 118. Because it was published before the F minor sonata, it was given an earlier sequence number (No. 2) but still kept its later opus number (Op. 22). This has caused confusion, and recordings of the G minor Sonata have sometimes been published as \\"Sonata No. 3\\". There was also an earlier sonata in F minor, which Schumann abandoned; this is sometimes referred to as \\"Sonata No. 4\\". Among his sonatas, this one is very frequently performed and recorded. Because of its great variety and highly virtuosic demands, it is enjoyed both by audiences and performers alike. Clara Schumann claimed to be \\"endlessly looking forward to the second sonata\\", but nevertheless Robert revised it several times. At Clara Schumann's request, the original finale, marked Presto passionato was replaced with a less difficult movement in 1838.\\"I am endlessly looking forward to the second sonata\\", thus Clara wrote to Robert in 1838, \\"Your whole being is so clearly expressed in it.\\" Nonetheless in the same letter she encouraged him to revise the last movement, which provided the composition with a completely new finale. The first two movements were also reworked several times. The Andantino of the sonata is based on Schumann's early song \\"Im Herbste\\"; Jensen describes the first movement as having \\"a concern with motivic structure\\". It is dedicated to Schumann's friend the pianist Henriette Voigt and was published in September 1839.

The private home was placed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on April 6, 1982. The farmhouse is significant both for its association with a prominent Norwegian immigrant family as well as its local limestone construction and outstanding integrity. Structure The Bonde Farmhouse is located off County Road 27 and Minnesota State Highway 246, just outside the town of Nerstrand. The building's siting on a hilltop location, alongside its stone masonry construction, make it a focal point for the farmstead and landmark in the area. The -story house is constructed of Nerstrand and Faribault limestone and its two sections form an L-shape. All windows and door opening on the west (front) side of the north ell are located below the central cabled roof while wider spaces are located between other openings. The two-over-two windows have stone sills and lintels. Small, slightly arched windows are centered in the gable ends. The front porch features turned posts, turned brackets and spindles along the porch frieze and is topped by a metal railing; it extends across the west side of the north ell.Britta Bloomberg, Minnesota Historic Properties Inventory Form, February 1981; copy accessed from Bonde, Totsen, Farmhouse file, State Historic Preservation Office in the Minnesota History Center. In 1960 a basement garage and 1-story addition were added to the rear of the building. Four of the farm buildings located near the house comprise the core of structures built by Tosten Bonde during the 1870s and 1880s; Bonde's journal recorded the construction dates. These structures include a gambrel-roofed barn, built in 1870 and remodeled at the turn of the 20th century; an 1883 machine shed that was later turned to a garage; an 1886 granary; and an 1887 milk house. These buildings were included in the original nomination to the NRHP. History and significance The site was originally homesteaded by Einer Bonde, who emigrated from Norway with his family in 1854 to farm in the Midwest. After a year in Iowa, in 1855 the family settled among the loosely organized Norwegian settlers in Wheeling Township. Einer's son Tosten acquired the farm in 1865 and built the large farmhouse in 1875, the same year his father, Einer died. Tosten Bonde kept thorough records of farm statistics, building improvements as well as family and local notes in a journal he kept in the 1880s. Tosten Bonde was a successful farmer and figured prominently in the history of the Norwegian community centered on Nerstrand. He founded the Wheeling Mutual Insurance Company in 1876 and served in the Minnesota State Legislature for two terms as a Representative and two terms as a State Senator.Johnson, Tosten \\"T., Tostin\\", Minnesota Legislative Reference Library, Accessed December 9, 2010.Fundamental Inventory Guide Part 2: Rice County Historical Setting & Resources , Rice County, Minnesota, Accessed December 13, 2010.

Additionally, in the United States, it is a special education classification under which students are eligible for services through the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA.http://www.parentcenterhub.org/multiple/ Not every governmental education entity uses the classification, however. In some states, legislation indicates that in order to be classified as having \\"multiple disabilities\\", at least one of a student's documented disabilities must include intellectual disability. Individuals classified as having multiple disabilities usually have more than one significant disability, such as orthopedic impairment, sensory impairment, and/or behavioral or emotional issues. Under the IDEA, students are labeled with multiple disabilities when their educational disabilities require more than the services that are available for just one of their disabilities. For instance, if a student has a developmental disability, emotional disabilities, and a visual impairment, they may be classified as having multiple disabilities. However, not every student who has more than one disability receives this classification.http://idea.ed.gov/ Characteristics People with severe or multiple disabilities may exhibit a wide range of characteristics, depending on the combination and severity of disabilities, and the person’s age. There are, however, some traits they may share, including: Psychological * May Feel ostracized * Tendency to withdraw from society * Students with multiple disabilities may become fearful, angry, and upset in the face of forced or unexpected changes. * May execute self- injurious behavior Behavioral * May display an immature behavior inconsistent with chronological age * May exhibit an impulsive behavior and low frustration level * May have difficulty forming interpersonal relationships * May have limited self-care skills and independent community living skills Physical/health * A variety of medical problems may accompany severe disabilities. Examples include seizures, sensory loss, hydrocephalus, and scoliosis. * May be physically clumsy and awkward * May be unsuccessful in even their daily life activities and maybe dependent . (See also characteristics for students with visual impairment, hearing impairment, orthopedic impairment, autism, and speech/language impairment.)

The shorts were originally narrated in Mandarin and subsequently subtitled in English; more recent ones are released with Chinese, English, and Japanese narration. The studio became well-known beyond its Chinese-language audience in 2010, when it covered the revelations of Tiger Woods' extramarital affairs and the JetBlue flight attendant incident, and participated in an online video \\"feud\\" with Conan O'Brien. It collaborated with The Daily Show with Jon Stewart in creating a satirical depiction of the Wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton. Related research To examine the effects of using animation in news report by what was then called Next Media Animation on young viewers, the School of Communication of Hong Kong Baptist University conducted two studies in 2011. For the first study, an experiment with 153 college students as participants was conducted to compare the perceived credibility of news reports with and without melodramatic animation. The results show that the animation format neither enhances nor dampens news credibility. However, they also show that sound effects reduce the credibility of news reports using melodramatic animation. The perceived credibility was also related to the credibility of the news organization and the medium dependency of the viewer. The other study adopts uses and gratifications theory and surveys 312 college students to investigate their viewing of animated-news. Seven motives were identified, which included social interaction, relaxation, information-seeking, entertainment, pastime, interpersonal learning and companionship, for viewing such animated-news videos. Results from a hierarchical regression suggest predictive relationships among personality characteristics, the seven motives and the effects of perceived news credibility and newsworthiness, and the intention to share such animated news videos with others.

PacBio describes its platform as single molecule real time sequencing (SMRT), based on the properties of zero- mode waveguides. The company's first commercial product, the PacBio RS, was sold to a limited set of customers in 2010 and was commercially released in early 2011. A subsequent version of the sequencer called the PacBio RS II was released in April 2013. On September 25, 2013 a partnership between Pacific Biosciences and Roche Diagnostics was announced for the development of in vitro diagnostic products using the technology, with Roche providing in the deal. In 2015, the company launched a new sequencing instrument called the Sequel System with approximately 7-fold greater capacity than the PacBio RS II. Then in April 2019 the company launched the Sequel II system with a further 8-fold increase in throughput. History The company was founded based on research done at Cornell University that combined semiconductor processing and photonics with biotechnology research. Three graduate students in the lab of Professor Harold Craighead -- Steve Turner, Jonas Korlach, and Mathieu Foquet -- became the first employees. It began under the name Nanofluidics, Inc. The company raised nearly in six rounds of primarily venture capital financing, making it one of the most capitalized startups in 2010 leading up to their public offering in October of that year. Key investors included Mohr Davidow Ventures, Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield & Byers, Alloy Ventures, and Wellcome Trust.  Leadership  In 2004, Kleiner Perkin's Entrepreneur-in-Residence Hugh Martin became CEO. On 6 January 2012 board member Michael Hunkapiller, PhD assumed the role of CEO. Hunkapiller is planning his retirement in September 2020. Chairman-of-the-Board Christian Henry will next assume the role of CEO. Henry was a former Executive VP and Chief Commercial Officer of Illumina before joining the board at PacBio in July 2018. Going public In an initial public offering on October 27, 2010, Pacific Biosciences sold 12,500,000 shares at a price of $16 per share and raised approximately $200 million. The shares trade on NASDAQ under the symbol PACB. Illumina On 1 November 2018, Illumina agreed to purchase PacBio for $1.2 billion US in cash. The deal was expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2019, however the deal was abandoned with an announcement on 2 January 2020. Illumina further agreed to pay Pacific Biosciences a $98 million US termination fee plus previously agreed upon deal extension payments of $22 million US in February and $6 million US in March of 2020. Recognitions The company received the Technology Pioneer Award from the World Economic Forum in 2009. In 2010, The Scientist named the company and their first product the top life science innovation of the year, and the company received the 2010 Advanced Sequencing Technology Award from the National Human Genome Research Institute. Technology Review magazine included them in their list of the top 50 most innovative companies for both 2010 and 2011. Founder and Chief Technical Officer Dr. Stephen Turner was awarded the 2010 Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation Outstanding Postdoctoral Entrepreneur award for his work at the company. Products  Sequencing instruments  A PacBio RSII sequencer Pacific Biosciences Sequel Sequencer The company's first scientific instrument, called the “PacBio RS”, was released to a limited set of eleven customers in late 2010. Sequencing provider GATC Biotech was selected by Pacific Biosciences as its first European service provider in late 2010. The product was then commercially released in early 2011. A new version of the sequencer called the \\"PacBio RS II\\" was released in April 2013; it produced longer sequence reads and offered higher throughput than the original RS instrument. The RS instrument will officially be supported until the end of 2021. In September 2015, the company released a new sequencing instrument, the Sequel System. The sequencer has increased capacity with 1 million zero-mode waveguides compared to 150,000 in the PacBio RS II, and is approximately one- third the size and one-half the price of the PacBio RS II.http://www.pacb.com/blog/introducing-the-sequel-system-the-scalable- platform-for-smrt-sequencing/ In April 2019, the company released an upgraded Sequel II system with support for a new SMRT Cell with eight million ZMW's, increasing the expected throughput per SMRT Cell by a factor of eight.http://investor.pacificbiosciences.com/static- files/e53d5ef9-02cd-42ab-9d86-3037ad9deaec  Reagents and SMRT Cells  Further information: Single molecule real time sequencing To use either instrument, customers must also purchase reagent packs for DNA preparation and sequencing and small consumables called “SMRT Cells”. Cells for the RS sequencer are slightly less than one-centimeter square and contains tens of thousands of zero-mode waveguides. Cells for the Sequel sequencer are about 2.5 cm square and contains one million zero-mode waveguides, whereas cells for the Sequel II sequencer contain eight million zero-mode waveguides. The cells for the RS sequencer are sold in packs of eight. Cells for the Sequel or Sequel II sequencers are sold in packs of four. On 19 September 2018, PacBio released the Sequel 6.0 software and 3.0 chemistry. Performance differs between large-insert libraries and high molecular weight DNA versus shorter- insert libraries below ~15,000 bases in length. For larger templates, average read lengths are up to 30,000 bases. For shorter-insert libraries, the average read length is up to 100,000 bases while reading the same molecule in a circle. The latter shorter-insert libraries then yield up to 50 billion bases from a single SMRT® Cell. On 1 October 2019, PacBio released the 8.0 software and 2.0 chemistry for Sequel II. For larger templates read as \\"continuous long reads\\", an example human library yielded N50 read length of 52,456 and yield per cell is 182 GB. For libraries below ~20,000 bases, read in circular consensus sequencing, yield per cell is quoted at 450 GB or about 30 GB of HiFi corrected reads.  Software and Applications  Their secondary analysis bioinformatics product for the RS, called “SMRT Analysis”, was open source.Pacific Biosciences (Feb 23, 2015) \\"Analysis\\" For the Sequel system the secondary analysis software was reorganized as the \\"SMRT Link\\" application. In 2013, the company released new bioinformatics tools for automated genome assembly (HGAP) and finishing to 99.999% accuracy (Quiver). Key publications Before the first commercial release of their sequencer, scientists published in January 2009 the first sequence data generated from a single molecule real time sequencing in the journal Science. Then in April 2010, scientists published a paper in Nature showing that they had used zero- mode waveguides to perform real-time observation of ribosomal translation. Demonstrating the value for bacterial sequencing, scientists from Pacific Biosciences and other institutions published in January 2011 a paper in the New England Journal of Medicine demonstrating the origin of the 2010 cholera outbreak in Haiti. In August 2011, Pacific Biosciences scientists and collaborators at other organizations published a paper in the New England Journal of Medicine describing the classification of the E. coli strain causing the virulent 2011 outbreak in Germany responsible for hundreds of cases of hemolytic–uremic syndrome. This paper showed that the strain of E. coli responsible for the outbreak had acquired a Shiga-toxin–encoding phage through lateral gene transfer. In July 2012, several papers were published in peer-review journals demonstrating methods to automate genome finishing for bacteria using single molecule real-time sequencing. In 2013, scientists estimated that the majority of bacterial and archaeal genomes could be fully sequenced and assembled to closure using PacBio long reads. Several papers published by researchers at Pacific Biosciences demonstrated that the sequencing instrument can be used to collect data on methylation, DNA damage, and other epigenetic information. The polymerase that performs the sequencing reaction in the zero-mode waveguides produces kinetic data that can be used to distinguish base modifications. In October 2012, scientists used SMRT sequencing to generate the methylomes of six bacteria, reporting their results in a paper in Nucleic Acids Research. With increasing read length and throughput, mammalian studies increased using the product. In April 2012, scientists from Pacific Biosciences, the University of California, and other institutes used SMRT sequencing to prove the validity of activating internal tandem duplication mutations in FLT3 as a therapeutic target in acute myeloid leukemia. Their findings were published in the journal Nature. In August 2012, scientists at the Broad Institute published a paper reporting the findings of their evaluation of the Pacific Biosciences sequencer for SNP calling and discovery. Scientists reported in Genome Research in October 2012 the use of the PacBio platform to sequence the full repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene responsible for Fragile X Syndrome. A paper published in December 2012 offered the first demonstration of how to generate sequence data with the PacBio sequencer with no library preparation. In 2013, scientists published papers demonstrating the use of PacBio sequencing to analyze transcriptomes, showing that long reads were able to fully capture complete isoforms.Proceedings of the National Academy of Scientists USA (Nov 26, 2013) \\"Characterization of the human ESC transcriptome by hybrid sequencing\\" External links * Company web site * Wall Street Journal profile References Category:Companies listed on NASDAQ Category:Companies based in Menlo Park, California Category:Technology companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Biotechnology companies of the United States Category:Biotechnology companies established in 2004 Category:American companies established in 2004 Category:Genomics companies Category:Research support companies Category:Health care companies based in California Category:2004 establishments in California Category:2010 initial public offerings ","title":"Pacific Biosciences"},{"id":"29992095","text":"Forastera is a white Spanish wine grape variety that is primarily grown in the Canary Islands.

The core of the Kyla Brox Band go back to this unit, nominally the Victor Brox Blues Train, but known informally as 'the child slavery band' because of the extreme youth of the players. As well as Kyla (13), the group contained bassist Danny Blomeley (13), and drummer Phil Considine (19). In 2000, she accompanied her father on an extensive tour of Australia. Danny Blomeley had left the Blues Train two years earlier to travel the world, and promised to find Victor some dates in Australia. Kyla, now 20, found herself singing risque blues songs to hard men in mining camps in remote parts of the Australian outback. Back in Manchester in 2001, Kyla and Danny formed a duo, occasionally augmented by old members of ‘the child slavery band’, and the line-up finally settled into the Kyla Brox Band - Kyla Brox (vocals, flute); Marshall Gill (guitar); Tony Marshall (saxophones); Danny Blomeley (bass) and Phil Considine (drums). The Kyla Brox Band started playing in North West pubs and clubs: the circuit that had once been the stomping ground of the Victor Brox Blues Train. Their performance at the Colne Blues Festival in 2002 established Kyla's reputation on the British blues scene. The Kyla Brox Band toured Australia in 2003, 2004 and 2007, the same year they made their US debut.

Early life and career Gawler was born in 1950 to Alan Gawler, an engineer, and Billie Gawler (née Gray) in Melbourne, Australia. After graduation from the University of Melbourne, he worked as a vet in a mixed practice at Bacchus Marsh and Melton, Victoria in 1973 with a special interest in horses and surgery. Cancer diagnosis, treatment and criticism In 1974 Gawler was diagnosed with osteosarcoma. Resultant surgery involved amputation through the hip. Late in 1975, it was diagnosed that the bone cancer had metastasised and spread to lymph nodes inside his pelvis and mediastinum before spreading more widely on the surface of his sternum and through his left lung. In December 1975, with the assistance of Australian psychiatrist Ainslie Meares, who believed that meditation could alter the course of, or even cure cancer, Gawler adopted a regime of intensive meditation. He also followed a Gerson diet and pursued a program of research, introspection and personal development. In February 1976 his doctors gave him only a few weeks to live.https://www.abc.net.au/religion/watch/compass/a-good-life-according- to-ian-gawler/10140830 In February 1976, Gawler had some palliative radiotherapy; in October 1976 he underwent three cycles of experimental chemotherapy. In 1977 he also had an audience with Sai Baba.Allenby, Guy. Ian Gawler, The Dragon's Blessing, Allen & Unwin, 2008 He was declared clear of cancer in 1978. At the same time he was diagnosed with TB, which responded rapidly to conventional treatment and supported by lifestyle-based self-help techniques. Gawler's recovery from cancer was documented by MearesMeares A., \\"Regression of osteogenic sarcoma metastases associated with intensive meditation\\", Medical Journal of Australia, 1978, p. 433. and, 30 years later, the fact that he was still alive was also documented.G. A. Jelinek and R. H. Gawler, \\"Thirty-year follow-up at pneumonectomy of a 58-year-old survivor of disseminated osteosarcoma\\", Medical Journal of Australia, 2008, pp. 663-665. In the December 2011, Internal Medicine Journal, the online journal of the Royal Australian College of Physicians, two oncologists, Ian Haines from Cabrini Hospital and Ray Lowenthal from Hobart, published a report that no biopsy of Gawler for secondary cancer had been made and suggested that all of his symptoms were consistent with tuberculosis.\\"Cancer experts challenge Gawler's 'cure'\\", The Age, 31 December 2011. In response to this report, Gawler maintained that the diagnosis was confirmed by his eminent team of physicians of the day, and said that they still stand by that diagnosis.\\"Article an insult to doctors who diagnosed my cancer\\" by Ian Gawler, The Age, 17 April 2012. He said that Haines and Lowenthal did not consult with any of these people in preparing their speculative hypothesis and, therefore, did not take account of his clinical history or the many diagnostic tests performed and deemed to be adequate by those physicians to confirm the diagnosis. Gawler's original physicians maintain that the TB developed as a complication of Gawler's primary cancer, osteogenic sarcoma, probably after chemotherapy weakened his immune system. Lifestyle-based cancer treatment work After recovering from cancer, Gawler resumed work as a vet for short periods in Geelong and the Gold Coast before moving to Morphett Vale near Adelaide, South Australia, in 1978. In 1980 he then moved to a new practice at Yarra Junction, Victoria. In 1981, Gawler co-founded the Melbourne Cancer Support Group, a lifestyle-based self-help program for people with cancer. The 12-week program was based upon Gawler's beliefs about his own recovery. Participants were taught dietary principles, relaxation, meditation, imagery and pain management skills. Other sessions included techniques to develop emotional health, the power of the mind, philosophy and the capacity to come to terms with and integrate the possibility of dying through cancer. The program was documented in Gawler's first self-help book, You Can Conquer Cancer. In 1984, the Gawler Foundation, a not-for-profit charitable organisation, was established. The foundation conducts lifestyle-based self- help programs for people affected by cancer and multiple sclerosis, as well as meditation retreats, wellness programs and training and conferences for doctors and other health professionals. In 1995 the Gawler Foundation published Inspiring People, a collection of the personal experiences of cancer written by 50 people who had survived \\"against the odds\\". In 2008 another collection, Surviving Cancer, was written by 28 people who had survived cancer and had attended the Gawler Foundation's programs. It was launched by Chris O'Brien, former director of the Sydney Cancer Centre based at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. Lowenthal, who has long been a critic of Gawler's work engaged in an hour-long debate on ABC-TV show Couchman. Lowenthal challenged Gawler to produce 50 of his best cancer recovery cases for review. Gawler agreed on air and welcomed \\"the opportunity for some serious research\\". The review has not happened, despite the fact that the 50 cases were made available by the Gawler Foundation at the time. Lowenthal was reportedly unable to receive funding for the study. Gawler worked at the Gawler Foundation as therapeutic director until 2009. He still contributes to some programs on a part-time basis. Gawler has been a keynote speaker at many conferences, including the Royal College of General Practitioners' \\"Happiness and its Causes\\" international conference. In 2010 he received the Winsome Constance Kindness Medal for his contribution to animal welfare. Honours In 1987, Gawler was awarded an OAM for his contributions to the community.

Biography King was born in Daytona Beach, Florida. With strong influences in gospel music, King started singing at the early age of 5 and by the time he was 7 he was sought out by Disney for the Mickey Mouse Club. However, King's mother was unsure about exposing her son to the potentially stressful industry of child stardom, so she elected not to let him be a part of it. That did not keep King from singing and he persevered to develop his voice on his own. When he was 15, his family moved to Texas, where he continued to practice music throughout his high school years. This led him to receive a music scholarship to the University of the Incarnate Word. He continued to pursue his education in music and attended the International Academy of Design & Technology. He then decided to commit himself full-force to his career, putting school on hold to pursue his lifelong dream. Career His first taste of success came in 2007 when King signed his first record deal with the independent recording label VIP Music and moved to Miami to start recording his debut album. In the middle of 2008, his first hit single \\"Cry No More\\"/\\"No Llores\\" hit the airwaves in both English and Spanish all over the US, making it to the Billboard Top 50. The track was written by Executive Producer Charles Jordan also known as JBOI and produced by Beta Control, out of Miami. However, it was only a temporary boost for his career. The record was never formally marketed beyond radio, so as a result the record eventually lost its momentum and King's recognition began to die out. Later that year, he released a Holiday single, \\"Silent Night\\" also executive produced by Charles Jordan also known as JBOI, to digital services. Returning to the studios, he released two new singles. The first, entitled \\"Never See You Again,\\" was released on November 19, 2010 and featured Gyptian. It was produced by Lu Diaz of the production team Diaz Brothers, and was cut in English, Spanish, and Spanglish. The second track, \\"Hand Clap,\\" was released as a single on July 26, 2011 and featured T-Pain and rapper Young Cash from T-Pain's Nappy Boy label. King was also featured on the English remix of Daddy Yankee's single Ven Conmigo. Additionally, his first official Spanish single, \\"Nunca Te Vuelvo A Ver,\\" has been met with great reception, particularly by video outlets. The video is currently in rotation on HTV, MTV TR3S, MTV LA (Latin America), VH1 LA (Latin America), MTV Brazil, MTV UK and peaked on Blastro.com as the #2 most watched \\"Latin\\" video, only surpassed by Prince Royce's \\"Corazon Sin Cara.\\" He released a second Spanish single, \\"Quitate La Ropa\\" featuring 2nyce on November 10, 2011.

It is highly diverse, having differentiated into several subspecies which occupy a wide geographic range. S. mormonia exhibits extreme protandry, which is the emergence of male adults before female adults. This has several consequences on male and female behavior. Habitat specificity is still being investigated, as there are few known environmental predictors, and S. mormonia appears to be associated with a wide range of habitats. This species is not under threat, and conservation efforts are generally not necessary.  Geographic range  S. mormonia is found throughout western North America, with significant populations in both the United States and Canada.Boggs, Carol L., and Charles L. Ross. \\"The effect of adult food limitation on life history traits in Speyeria mormonia (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae).\\" Ecology 74.2 (1993): 433-441.Marks, D. and V. Young. 2009. Mormon Fritillary (Speyeria mormonia erinna) inventory in the Okanagan and Boundary regions of southern British Columbia, 2009. Ministry of Environment, Penticton, B.C. 17pp. Four subspecies are present in Canada, from the Yukon region through British Columbia. Several more subspecies are present in the United States, with montane populations in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, and mesic populations in California and Nevada.Boggs, Carol L., and Dennis D. Murphy. \\"Community composition in mountain ecosystems: climatic determinants of montane butterfly distributions.\\" Global Ecology and Biogeography Letters (1997): 39-48.Boggs, Carol L. \\"Within population variation in the demography of Speyeria mormonia (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae).\\" Ecography 10.3 (1987): 175-184.Brittnacher, John G., Steven R. Sims, and Francisco J. Ayala. \\"Genetic differentiation between species of the genus Speyeria (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae).\\" Evolution 32.1 (1978): 199-210. S. mormonia is a wide-ranging species compared to other Speyeria, and exhibits high genetic variability as a result.  Habitat  S. mormonia occupy a wide range of habitats, including rocky mountainsides, saturated meadows, open grasslands, and clearings within pine forests. Their populations are dependent on climate conditions and availability of nectar from species of Viola (violets), which in turn depends on suitable rainfall to prosper. Furthermore, S. mormonia are reported in both Canada and the US as being found at higher elevations. Populations tend to occur in small, semi-isolated patches. The amount of dispersal between subsites may vary based on the subspecies or population in question. For example, the Canadian subspecies erinna exists at isolated sites, while the Colorado population showed high dispersal between sub-sites.  Food resources  Species of violet are the host plant for larval S. mormonia. There is currently no evidence for a particular species of violet being preferred as a host plant, and S. mormonia has been observed feeding on many species of violet, including Viola dunce, Viola canadensis, Viola glabella, Viola nephrophylla, Viola orbiculate, and Viola renifolia. Violets flower before the peak flight season, meaning that its function as an adult nectar source is limited. Adult feeding also takes place at mud puddles, specifically by males and older females, and on nectar from Compositae plants.Sculley, Colleen E., and Carol L. Boggs. \\"Mating systems and sexual division of foraging effort affect puddling behaviour by butterflies.\\" Ecological Entomology 21.2 (1996): 193-197. Females are more dependent on adult feeding for reproductive success, yet male adult survivorship is more closely dependent on nectar availability.  Resource stress  Under resource stress, female S. mormonia have the ability to reallocate nutrients from reproduction to survival. They reabsorb unlaid oocytes to supply sufficient nutrients for their own survival, decreasing their overall fecundity and reproductive success. If allowed, females will consume honey- water ad libitum under experimental conditions. These observations reinforce the necessity of adult feeding for reproductive success in females, since sub- sufficient nutrient consumption negatively impacts fecundity in favor of adult survival. thumb  Mud puddling  Mud puddling refers to a behavior where adult butterflies feed from mud and animal waste, rather than on nectar. In adult S. mormonia, males puddle more than females, and young males puddle more frequently than older males. Furthermore, older females were observed puddling, particularly if their overall lifetime mating count was low. This behavior is explained by the nutrients derived from puddling. Males source sodium at puddles, which they then transfer to females during mating. An older female who has only mated once or twice may have exhausted her sodium supply, and so turns to puddling to refresh her nutrient stores. Young females still retain sodium from their first mating, and therefore have no need to puddle. Females who mate multiply are resupplied sodium with each mating, and similarly do not need to puddle.  Life cycle   Egg  Eggs are oviposited near hostplants in leaf debris.  Caterpillar  S. mormonia larvae are tan with black stripes. They diapause as early instars, stopping feeding and development to hibernate through the winter. As late instars, larvae depend on species of violets as their host plants.  Pupa  Females pupate later than males, presumably to allow for the gathering of more larval- derived nutrients which can be allocated towards reproduction.  Adult  Males emerge from pupa at least 2 weeks prior to females, and similarly have a peak flight period 2-3 weeks before females. Adult lifespan, observed by C.L. Boggs in a Colorado population over four years, varied between 10 and 40 days.  Sex ratio  Adult sex ratios in S. mormonia are skewed toward males. This potentially results from the species' extreme protandry, i.e. that adult males emerge weeks before females. The prolonged female pupal stage increases the probability of female death before adult eclosion, or emergence. In other words, S. mormonia may lay equal numbers of male and female eggs, but more males successfully make it to adulthood, skewing the sex ratio. This bias has several implications, including high variance in male reproductive success, and the need for larval-derived nutrients for females.  Subspecies  Listed alphabetically:\\"Speyeria Scudder, 1872\\" at Markku Savela's Lepidoptera and Some Other Life Forms *S. m. arge (Strecker, 1878) *S. m. artonis (Edwards, 1881) *S. m. bischoffii (Edwards, 1870) *S. m. erinna (Edwards, 1883) *S. m. eurynome (Edwards, 1872) *S. m. luski (Barnes & McDunnough, 1913) *S. m. opis (Edwards, 1874) *S. m. washingtonia (Barnes & McDunnough, 1913)  Mating  S. mormonia are protandrous, with adult males emerging at least two weeks prior to females. As a result, males are able to mate multiply, while females usually mate only once. Furthermore, roughly 50% of males are unsuccessful at mating.Elgar, M.A. &Pierce;, N.E. (1988) Mating success and fecundity in an ant-tended lycaenid butterfly. Reproductive Success: Studies of individual variation in contrasting breeding systems (ed. By T. H. Clutton-Brock), pp. 59-75. University of Chicago Press. Males actively seek out their mates, flying low over habitats in search of sedentary females. Females are often found on adult nectar plants, as intake of sufficient nectar crucially determines their reproductive success and fecundity. During mating, females receive a sodium transfusion from males, which is used for egg production. If females do have the opportunity to mate multiply, they can derive the bulk of their nutrients from nuptial gifts, and thereby reduce their need to forage for nectar. Following mating, females oviposit near their host plant, violets, but rarely on them. Females can be observed walking amidst the vegetation, searching for an appropriate site to oviposit.  Physiology  The Mormon Fritillary is relatively small in comparison to other fritillaries. Their wings are orange with small black patches, excepting the ventral hindwing, which has a green tinge accented by light silver streaks. These silver streaks vary between subspecies, with some possessing a reflective quality, and others appearing chalk white. On average, female wingspan ranges from 25-27mm, while males have a slightly smaller wingspan, from 23-26mm. These values are specific to a population in Colorado, and wingspan might vary between unique populations and subspecies.  Flight  S. mormonia are a univoltine species, having one flight period from mid-July through early September.Guppy, C., and J. Shepard. 2001. Butterflies of British Columbia. Royal BC Museum. Victoria. Females and males differ in their peak flight periods, with males flying first, and females following two to three weeks afterwards. Although they have different peaks, both males and females conclude their flight period at the same time, towards the end of August and into early September. Regarding specific flight patterns, both sexes display dispersing habits, with no significant difference between the two. However, males may be more mobile than females, as they fly close to the ground to search for mates. Flight period shows a close dependency on weather patterns, with a lack of rainfall correlating to shorter flight periods.

Jack was also wounded fatally and while dying arranged to have Chescott live with the Levi Mitchell family and gave his entire estate to her. Jack then died several hours later on December 14, 1864. He was buried on the side of a hill in the Tailholt Boot Hill Cemetery, near White River, Tulare County, California. Chescot is buried near him.

Early life  Wolfe was born in Hong Kong on 11 Jun 1911, the son of the Hon E D C Wolfe, Inspector General of the Royal Hong Kong Police and Chief Officer of the Hong Kong Fire Brigade. He was educated at Grange School, Folkestone and Tonbridge School in Kent. Between 1929 and 1932, Wolfe worked as an apprentice with Merryweather and Sons (Fire-Engineers) at Greenwich, London, before working in the head office as a salesman and later as a fire prevention officer. Aged sixteen, Wolfe took a ten-minute ‘joy-ride’ flight in a Vickers Virginia over Andover. This flight resolved his ambition to become a pilot. Royal Air Force Wolfe joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve on 4 Mar 1935 as an Aiman/untrained pilot. He undertook flying training at No. 1 Elementary Flying Training School at Hatfield. He was promoted to a Sergeant on 18 Mar 1935. Wolfe took up a short service commission in January 1936 and was sent to No. 4 Elementary Flying Training School at Brough on 23 February as an acting Pilot Officer to complete his ‘ab initio’ training. He received his Civil Pilot 'A' Licence (No. 9179) on 5 Mar 1936, before posting to No. 9 Flying Training School at RAF Thornaby and gaining his RAF wings on 30 Jul 1936. Wolfe joined No. 64 Squadron RAF at RAF Martlesham Heath on 11 Oct 1936, flying the Hawker Demon aircraft, attending the Officers Parachute Course at RAF Manston, Kent on 23 Aug 1936. He was promoted to Pilot Officer on 27 Jan 1937. He became the Flight Commander of 'B Flight' of 64 Sqn in May 1938 and promoted to Acting Flight Lieutenant. He was appointed Squadron Adjutant in December 1938. In October 1938, Wolfe was posted to No. 219 Squadron RAF at RAF Catterick, Yorks as 'B' Flight Commander, flying the Blenheim Mk 1 for night-fighting duties. By the start of the Battle of Britain in July 1940, Wolfe was flying with Plt Off Howard Duart, in Red Section. Most of his patrols took place in the Catterick area, combined with training exercises, gun firing and time on the Link Trainer. Wolfe was promoted to substantive Flight Lieutenant on 3 September 1940 and was transferred to command No. 141 Squadron RAF at RAF Turnhouse, part of No. 11 Group RAF. The squadron was flying the Defiant aircraft and it was Wolfe's role to turn it into a night- fighting squadron following its poor day fighter role. He crewed with Sergeant Alfred Ashcroft as his regular gunner, a partnership that would last for the next two years. He was promoted to Acting Squadron Leader 6 Oct 1940. In April 1941 141 Sqn moved to RAF Ayr in Scotland as part of No. 13 Group RAF. Wolfe was recommended for an immediate DFC by the new commanding officer at Ayr, which was approved by Air Marshal Sholto-Douglas on 14 May 1941. The recommendation read: > On the night of 6/7 th May 1941, S/Ldr Wolfe was on patrol over Glasgow when > he sighted an enemy aircraft. He immediately closed to the attack while > ordering his air-gunner to withhold fire until they were within 20yds of > their objective. His courage and determination in closing with the enemy to > such short-range enabled him to remain ‘in formation’ while the enemy > carried out evasive action, thus bringing his combat to a successful > conclusion. The enemy aircraft still carrying a full load of bombs crashed > to the ground and burst into flames. This officer has completed 174 hours > night-flying since the outbreak of war during which time he has carried out > no less than 40 operational flights by night. Since assuming command of 141 > Squadron in September 1940 he has always shown great determination, skill > and courage and his leadership has undoubtedly imbued his pilots with the > same characteristics. Wolfe's gunner Ashcroft was commissioned in November 1941, and on 1 December, Wolfe was made a Temporary Squadron Leader. On 27 March 1942, Wolfe was promoted to acting Wing Commander and took command of No. 456 Squadron RAAF at RAF Valley flying Beaufighter MkII’s in a night-fighting role, taking Ashcroft with him as his Air-Gunner. Although primarily a night-fighter unit, the squadron also supplemented the day fighters on convoy patrols. The squadron was re-equipped with the de Havilland Mosquito in December 1942, which Wolfe flew for 51 hours before he was sent to the 8th War Staff Course at RAF Staff College, Bulstrode Park near Gerrards Cross. Following successful completion of this course, he was posted No. 62 OTU at RAF Ouston as the Chief Flying Instructor. In August 1943, Wolfe was sent to Orlando, Florida, for a short course at the United States Air Force Staff College, being followed by six weeks at the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas where he gained a Diploma.http://www.awm.gov.au/units/people_1077761.asp On his return to the UK in November 1943, Wolfe was appointed Operations Staff Officer at Headquarters No. 85 Group RAF, TAF at RAF Uxbridge, moving to Headquarters No. 13 Group RAF (Communications) at RAF Inverness as Operations Staff Officer and Training Staff Officer on 18 May 1944. On 1 July 1944, Wolfe was promoted to Temporary Wing Commander and attended an Aviation medicine Course at RAF Farnborough on 31 July. In May 1945, he went to Headquarters of No. 88 Group RAF in Norway for Staff work, receiving a Mention in Dispatches on 8 June whilst flying with No. 132 Wing RAF part of No. 13 Group RAF. On 17 November 1945, Wolfe was awarded the Norwegian Liberation Cross by King Haakon VII of Norway for his services in No. 88 Group RAF. Wolfe was released from the Royal Air Force on 17 Dec 1945 retaining the rank of Wing Commander. By then he had flown thirty six different types of aircraft and had 2018 flying hours. Edward Wolfe died in 1994.

Scoville established the Department of Neurosurgery at Connecticut's Hartford Hospital in 1939. He performed surgery on Henry Gustav Molaison in 1953 to relieve epilepsy that led to damage of Molaison's hippocampus and left him with a memory disorder. Biography Scoville was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on January 13, 1906. Although he had a strong interest in automobiles throughout his life, his father pushed William toward a career in medicine. After completing his undergraduate degree at Yale (B.A., 1928), he attended and graduated from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in 1932. In 1941, he became board certified in neurosurgery. Also, in 1941 he started the first neurosurgical residency training program in Connecticut. In 1953 Scoville offered Henry Gustav Molaison, the patient now widely known as H. M., a chance to cure Molaison's epilepsy through a pioneered experimental procedure. With the approval of the patient and his family, Scoville was to perform an experimental resection of several portions of the temporal lobes, a procedure which had previously performed in psychotic patients. Scoville had a \\"hunch\\" that the hippocampus was responsible, and based on this erroneous guess, removed Molaison's hippocampus - sucking it out using a medical tool which comprises a cauterizing blade and suction vacuum, while the anesthetized but conscious Molaison sat in the operating chair. Later, the hippocampus became known to be crucial in the formation of memories - which is why Molaison was rendered unable to form new memories for the rest of his life. Scoville consulted with a leading Canadian surgeon, Wilder Penfield at McGill University in Montreal, who, with psychologist Brenda Milner, had previously reported on two other patients’ memory deficits. As a result of this work (her PhD thesis) Milner has become one of the most famous neuropsychologists in the world. Scoville contributed to the development of the aneurysm clip. His modification was to place a coiled spring with an axis parallel to the plane of clip closure.Scoville WB: Miniature torsion bar spring aneurysm clip. J Neurosurg 25:97, 1966. Over the course of his life Scoville trained a total of 63 neurosurgeons, 46 from the U.S. and 17 foreign. Scoville died in car crash on February 25, 1984.

Built adjacent to Grove Street in Harriman, one of the earlier structures built here in 1838 was a three-story hotel-train station combination. This station caught fire in 1873 and was replaced by a one-story wooden structure. That structure remained in use for decades before it began decaying and was replaced in 1911 with a new station on land donated by the widow of Edward Henry Harriman. A new one-story structure was built on the land. The station was maintained as a one-story depot with an adjacent monument dedicated to the work of Charles Minot. Minot was a director of the Erie Railroad who, in 1851, while his train was stopped at Turner, made the first railroad call by telegraph. The station depot remained in use by the Erie through October 1960, when that was folded into the Erie-Lackawanna Railroad, which itself would fold in April 1976, as it was absorbed into the Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail). Conrail maintained passenger services until 1983 when that job was taken over by Metro-North Railroad. On April 18, 1983, the last passenger train left the Harriman station, as Conrail and Metro-North abandoned the tracks in favor of using the Graham Line (a high- speed freight line) for passenger and freight service. At that time, a new park & ride off of New York State Route 17 in Harriman opened for the newly realigned passenger service along the ex-Graham Line. By the time that passenger service was transitioned to the Graham Line, the Harriman depot had been neglected for decades. The station depot remained on its concrete platform when the tracks were torn up on the old mainline. In 1996, workers removed the plaque attached to the Minot monument, but it was soon returned. However, the plaque was stolen shortly afterward and has not been recovered. The station depot itself was left in a decrepit condition as a result of the deterioration of its tiled roof. In 2006, the village of Harriman's building inspector ordered Norfolk Southern Railroad (the successor to Conrail and who owned the right-of-way) to either restore the building or demolish it. Norfolk Southern followed through with a demolition permit and in May 2006, the station depot was demolished by a front loader. The station remains were taken to a dump in Hillburn, New York.  History   First station constructed  The first station in Harriman, New York, then known as Turner, was first constructed around 1838 by Peter Turner, as one of the many stretches of the New York and Lake Erie Railroad was constructed through the town. The station itself was a long brick depot, three stories tall, and topped with a French roof. The station sat alongside the railroad tracks and was called the Orange Hotel. The dining room of the new structure was able to hold 500 people at a time and accommodate them with good food. During the planning of the Erie, there was some concern to whether or not the railroad would work its way through Harriman at all, instead of bypassing nearby Goshen and Middletown in favor of a terminus at Newburgh, also on the Hudson River. Train service to Harriman began in 1841, when the New York and Lake Erie ran its first trains on June 30, 1841, from Piermont-on-Hudson, the determined eastern terminus, to Goshen, the western end. Construction progressed on the Erie Railroad, and by the end of 1841, grading from Middletown to Goshen was in progress and 410 of the chartered for the new railroad was contracted. The railroad had been running trains on the railroad line, carrying about 250 passengers per day. The new railroad was completed in April 1851 at its intended length to Dunkirk on Lake Erie. On May 12, 1851, just about a month after the completion, a completion gala was held from Washington D.C.. Then-president Millard Fillmore and several members of his cabinet, along with several former governors of New York, attended. Several other distinguished individuals came from around the United States. On May 14, the tour arrived in New York City and began their trip on the first ride at Piermont at 7:45 that morning. The Fillmore train arrived at Dunkirk just past 4:00 pm the next afternoon.  Charles Minot and the telegraph  The monolith that once held a plaque commemorating Charles Minot's 1851 achievement In 1847, Ezra Cornell of Ithaca, New York worked to expand telegraphic communication through the New York and Lake Erie Railroad right-of-way with the Western Union Telegraph Company, saving a telegraph line he built from New York City to Fredonia. The new telegraph was an instant hit and was commonly used for gossip and casual chatting. The then-superintendent of the New York and Lake Erie, Charles Minot, looked to expand this new technology with the railroad. He developed a system using telegraphs for train dispatches, for use when trains would want to pass one another along the line, such as at stations. Two-letter telegraph codes were designated, and the new modern system was set up. For the ten years of the new railroad's existence, passengers had been disgusted as trains waited for hours as another train had to pass them. This new system would relieve this issue. On September 22, 1851, Minot was in a parked passenger train at Turner Station. He glanced out the window of the train and saw the new telegraph wires. Departing the train, Minot ran into the station, got on the new telegraph, and wired the next station along the line, Monroe, to see if the eastbound train to Piermont-on- Hudson had gone past. The station agent said no. At that point, Minot ordered the engineer of the train to proceed on their way to Goshen. The engineer refused to take Minot's order, and instead, Minot got into the cab car himself and drove the train himself to Port Jervis, hours ahead of the planned scheduled time of arrival. This was the second of the several \\"firsts\\" the Erie Railroad created in its time, along with the shipment of milk by rail at Chester station in 1842. The use of the telegraph and Minot's system remained until 1888, when a new system of block signaling, developed by the competitor Pennsylvania Railroad, helped expand Minot's use of telecommunications to control rail traffic.  Naming controversy  The Orange Hotel prior to the fire, shown in a montage from a June 1910 New York Times article Around 6:30 pm on the evening of Friday, December 26, 1873, the three-story Orange Hotel station depot caught fire. Some staff of the re-christened Erie Railroad were examining a room in the roof of the building, and upon looking into it, found it engulfed in smoke. The fire quickly spread, consuming the entire story. There was a lull, but the building re-ignited as flames continued through the building. The Mansard roof on top of the building was destroyed by the flames. No fire-ridding materials to douse the blaze were available to staff and no one could get near the building to inspect where the flames were. The flames finally destroyed the entire building, and just two hours after the fire was discovered, the walls began to collapse on the structure. Within a half-hour, the entire hotel/depot had collapsed and was a pile of brick ruins. Train service on the Erie mainline was disrupted for several hours due to the fire and station depot collapse. A later study determined the station depot burned down due to a defective flue. The station depot was replaced by a wooden one- story depot, referred to by locals as a shack, along the side of the tracks in downtown Turner. The new station itself lasted around the same amount of time that its predecessor station depot had; however, the widow of Edward Henry Harriman (d. September 9, 1909), a local railroad executive whose Arden estate was in the nearby hills, donated land in February 1910 in a different portion of Turner to build a brand new station to the east. The old one-story depot had a roof and structural supports that were aging and on the verge of collapsing to the ground. Plans for a new station didn't come without controversy though, as, in 1910 with the death of E.H. Harriman, there was a proposal by the Turner Village Improvement Association to rename the borough from Turner to Harriman as an honor to the late executive. On May 25, 1910, the association voted 58 to 13 to change the name. Harriman's widow said if they changed the name, she'd donate $25,000 (1910 USD, equivalent to $ in ) to help improvement the look and design of the village and $6,000 (1910 USD, equivalent to $ in ) more for a brand-new railroad station. It was proposed that by having the Erie Railroad change the station name on the decrepit depot from Turner to Harriman, the local Post Office would adopt the new name almost immediately. Erie conductors were told upon approaching Turner station to call the name Harriman. However, a local priest at the forefront of the controversy, Father McAran, thought the entire situation regarding the train from New York was a joke. To add to the annoyance of the priest, the old sign attached to the 1873 depot was replaced by a brand new one saying \\"Harriman\\". The 1873 station depot as photographed with the HARRIMAN name sign in June 1910 during the naming debates between Turner and Harriman On the morning of May 26, the Erie Railroad sent a statement out from Pavonia Terminal in Jersey City, New Jersey to disregard the order from the previous day. The new sign came down instantly and the conductors continued to call the station Turner once again. Old-time locals felt the name Turner had more value to them and shouldn't be touched. A self-appointed committee run by the priest proposed a meeting on Saturday, June 4, 1910, at nearby Gillette Hall to protest the name change. The priest also offered that if the name was to remain Turner's, he would contribute $500 towards the construction of a new station. The post office also said they would remain named Turner even if the signage on the Erie Railroad station went back to the Harriman name. Sometime during the night between June 1 and June 2, the Erie Railroad took the station depot sign for Turner down once again and re-attached the Harriman sign to the station depot. Local resolutions were sent to the Erie showing citizens' displeasure at changing the signage once again. The order from the Erie stated that beginning on July 15, the station name would remain \\"Harriman\\" permanently. Father McAran returned to his outrage and continued to go to the press and give interviews on the issue at hand. To wrap the issue up, a sign in the front of the local church proclaiming \\"LONG LIVE TURNER\\" was destroyed. This hurt the enthusiasm of locals, who suggested renaming the local Arden station near the Harriman estate instead.  New station opens at \\"Harriman\\"  A year after the great naming controversy and the station permanently being established as Harriman, construction began on a new station to replace the \\"disgraceful shack\\" that residents called Harriman. That year a new station, built with the $6,000 from Edward Henry Harriman's widow, was constructed of brick with a stucco outlier. The roof of the one-story depot was built with shingles, which helped it match the Tudor-style used at the Tuxedo station eleven miles eastbound. The station, which was grounded on a large and wide concrete platform that also served as the new station platform, was built on Grove Street and had measurements of 20' x 26.5' x 19', common for a Type-9 Erie Railroad station design. Just a year after the new station depot opened, the Erie honored the late Charles Minot on May 2, 1912, at the new station with a large ceremony attend by Mrs. Harriman, Erie president Frederick Underwood, several relatives to Minot, and other distinguished guests. At the ceremony, Minot's assistance to the railroad community was honored and a bronze tablet on a stone backing was unveiled as a monument to him. At this point, the Erie Railroad continued on with a new station at Harriman, which remained prosperous for years to come. The station featured both the main depot as well as a small shelter on the opposite side of the double-tracked line. In June 1931, James Gorney, a resident of Pine Island, allegedly attempted to rob the station and station agent. Harriman police shot Gorney in the leg, which was crippling enough that it required amputation of the leg. His lawyer, who got him off third-degree burglary charges and several acquittals, also negotiated a payment of $20,000 to Gorney from Harriman for the pain and suffering of the amputated leg, despite the attempted crime he was shot for. The jury deliberated for five hours before reaching a verdict of awarding Gorney the money. By the 1930s, long-distance passenger trains to Chicago, such as the Erie Limited and the Lake Cities, ran through Harriman but made no stops. Passengers would need to take a local train to Goshen or Middletown to transfer to the long-distance trains.'Official Guide of the Railways,' August 1936, Erie Railroad section, Tables 2, 3  End of service and demolition  alt=A bare expanse of untended grass and shrubbery with some bits of stone embedded in the ground. At left is a patch of gravel and at the bottom center the remnant of a curb. In the background, at center left, are some bare trees, evergreens, and a telephone pole Over the ensuing decades, the Erie Railroad fell into debt along with its competitor, the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad. On September 16, 1960, the Interstate Commerce Commission approved the railroads to go forward with a merger, creating the new Erie-Lackawanna Railroad on October 15, 1960. The new railroad lasted only 16 years. In 1976, the Erie Lackawanna and several other large railroad companies were merged into the newly formed federal Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail). At this point, stations had to fight for survival. The station depot at Harriman has been closed and boarded up since at least 1970. Passenger train service, however, remained intact through the early 1980s. In 1983, the station was finally closed when Conrail and the newly formed Metro-North Railroad announced that the new stations along the Erie's former high-speed freight line, the Graham Line, would take over freight and passenger service. Trains to Harriman would stop at a new park- and-ride built to the south. The former 1911 station depot, however, remained standing until 2006, when the Harriman village building inspector forced the new owners of the right-of-way for the old mainline, Norfolk Southern, to either revamp or demolish the former station depot. The railway chose the latter, and in May 2006, an excavator tore down the 1911 depot, with the remains were taken to a dump in nearby Hillburn.

It was released July 16, 2009 for the PlayStation Portable via the PlayStation Network, and on December 1, 2010 for the Xbox 360 via Xbox Live Arcade. Unbound Saga is the story of Rick Ajax, a comic book character who is aware he is in a comic. Ajax and fellow comic character Lori Machete seek to confront the artist who created them and be freed from constantly fighting. The game received moderate reviews from critics, with the PlayStation Portable version averaging 52.60% at GameRankings and 56/100 at Metacritic. Reviewers felt that the game's art direction was well done, with several reviewers praising the comic-esque cutscenes, as well as the voice acting. Some reviewers felt that the combat lacked polish, and that the combat and upgrade system lacked depth. Others lauded the simplicity of combat, likening it to classic beat 'em up titles. Gameplay Unbound Saga takes place inside a comic book and follows Rick Ajax, a character aware he is in a comic, and bent on confronting his maker. Unbound Saga is a 2.5D side- scrolling beat 'em up game. The game is played as though the character is reading a comic book. In individual comic panels the player character fights off his enemies using a combination of three attacks, which can be chained together in combos. When a character is defeated the hand of The Maker appears and draws additional enemies. In order to complete a panel, the player must defeat all the enemies The Maker draws. As a panel is completed, the character jumps to the next one, similar to Comix Zone. The environment locales vary and include areas such as sewers, city slums, jungles and tundra. Each of the game's two playable characters has a unique animation set and fighting style. Rick uses a fighting style similar to wrestling and can also pick up and throw enemies. Lori's moveset is more reminiscent of kung fu, and she has the ability to use smoke pellets to sneak up on enemies. Characters moves and abilities can be upgraded to earn and upgrade more powerful attacks. Two players can team up to complete the game on the Xbox 360, each taking a respective character. Objects can also be picked up and thrown. These objects decay into smaller objects after each use. Plot The game follows Rick Ajax, a bartending comic book character aware of the fact that he is in a comic. He knows of his creator, whom he refers to as The Maker. A second character, Lori Machete, is also available for play. Together they journey through the fictional city of Toxopolis to confront The Maker. Development and promotion Unbound Saga was first announced by Vogster Entertainment for the PlayStation Portable at New York Comic Con 2009. It was released July 16, 2009. On April 23, 2010, Vogster announced that the game was being ported to the Xbox 360. The port was announced to have cooperative gameplay, a feature absent from the PSP version. It was subsequently released on Xbox Live Arcade on December 1, 2010. In an interview with Mike Kennedy from Vogster Entertainment Kennedy stated the game was influenced by Final Fight and Streets of Rage. The art for the in-game cutscenes was done by Cliff Richards. A one-shot comic book was also created and published by Dark Horse Comics in conjunction with the game. Richards also created all of the art for the comic book. Mike Kennedy stated in an interview at St. Louis Comic-Con 2009 that the game and the comic had always been developed as one, rather than one being an adaptation of the other. The comic was launched on July 1, 2009. Limited edition figurines were also created to promote the game and comic book launch. Reception Unbound Saga received mixed reviews from critics. The game holds a score of 52.60% for the PSP at GameRankings and 56/100 for the PSP at Metacritic. GameRankings and Metacritic report similar numbers for the Xbox 360 version of the game, with aggregate scores of 55.86% and 52/100, respectively. Scores across both versions of the game ranged from a 30% approval rating from Kristan Reed of Eurogamer to a 75% approval rating from Jim Sterling and Nick Chester of Destructoid. The Xbox 360 version moved over 3,900 units during the month of its release. It moved approximately 28,000 units as of the end of 2011. Reviewers had mixed views on Unbound Sagas gameplay. The reviewer from Spazio Games, an Italian gaming site, compared the game to Double Dragon and Final Fight. The reviewer felt that the game felt rushed, and this affected gameplay. Carolyn Petit of GameSpot was more critical of the game, calling it \\"dull\\" and \\"mindless. IGN's Greg Miller noted the inclusion of combos and upgradeable character statistics, but felt that they \\"never really amplify the fun in alternating between punch and kick.\\" Destructoid's Jim Sterling noted \\"While there are more complex combos to unlock during the course of the game, the meat and potatoes of Unbound Saga is the endless hammering buttons to punch, kick and throw enemies around each level.\\" Co-reviewer Nick Chester called it \\"classic beat-’em-up game\\". Although giving the simple gameplay high marks, Chester felt that the PSP version of the game should have received cooperative play. Mike Jackson of GamesRadar appreciated the addition of cooperative gameplay on the Xbox 360 version, but wished players could join or leave on the fly. Critics were universal in praising the comic book art and voice acting present in the game's cutscenes. The reviewer from Spazio Games felt the cutscenes were well crafted and professionally done. GameSpot's Carolyn Petit stated that the \\"cutscenes are the game's high point and feature gorgeous comic-book artwork\\", and added \\"the voice actors do a fine job\\". Destructoid's Jim Sterling called the visuals \\"gritty comic book feel that doesn't look obtusely cel-shaded\\" and added \\"the voice talent is damn good as well\\". Nick Chester agreed with his co-reviewer and added \\"without a doubt, the game’s animated comics-brought-to- life cut-scenes are absolutely marvelous.\\" GamesRadar's Mike Jackson enjoyed the character's one-liners. He stated it was \\"pretty amusing with a tinge of adult humor.\\" He also felt that the plot was well written, that the characters were instantly likable, and that the game had a \\"great comic book style.\\" Brian Rowe of GameZone was surprisingly pleased with the game's soundtrack, and called it \\"unusually cool.\\" References External links * Category:2009 video games Category:Beat 'em ups Category:Cooperative video games Category:Multiplayer online games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:PlayStation Portable games Category:Video games based on comics Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games featuring female protagonists Category:Video games with cel-shaded animation Category:Xbox 360 Live Arcade games Category:Xbox 360 games Category:2009 comics debuts Category:Comics adapted into video games Category:Self-reflexive comics Category:Self-reflexive video games Category:One-shot comic titles ","title":"Unbound Saga"},{"id":"29992758","text":"James Brown (12 April 1814 – 14 July 1877) was a British Liberal Party politician.

It has been reported as free-living organism in marine mud and on algae. Urastoma cyprinae is reported as an opportunistic mantle inhabitantMcGladdery, S.E. and Bower, S.M. (1999) Synopsis of Infectious Diseases and Parasites of Commercially Exploited Shellfish: Malpeque Disease of Oysters. on the gills of various bivalve species, including the clams Tridacna maxima and Tridacna gigas, and the mussels Mytilus edulis and Mytilus galloprovincialis. They are also found throughout the gill surface of C. virginica and is attracted by mucus that coats the gills of oysters. However, the nature of the host-parasite relationship remains unknown. Morphology Urastoma cyprinae is a ciliated turbellarian measuring between 0.4 and 0.8 mm in length.  Life cycle  They live and feed and grow in the mussels, but their complete life cycle stumped researchers because eggs were never observed in these hosts. Researchers in Spain recently discovered that when U. cyprinae is ready to lay eggs, it leaves the bivalve, secretes a protective cocoon around itself and produces an egg sac. About 24 days later, the young hatch out (shown in the photo), make their way out of the cocoon and swim off to find new mussel hosts. The adults sometimes appear to just die in the cocoons, but sometimes also were observed to escape from it themselves and head off to lay more eggs.  Prevention  There are no known methods of prevention or control.  Pathogenicity  Urastoma cyprinae is believed to feed on the mucus secreted by its host and its presence alters the protease composition of gills in C. virginica. Urastoma cyprinae is negatively phototatic and is more attracted to oysters when compared to other mollusc species such as mussels and clams. Urastoma cyprinae attaches its anterior end to gill filaments, presumably in a feeding posture, and arches its body back and forth, wagging its posterior end, which bears the terminal orogenital pore, within the mucus that flows over the gills. Ingestion of foods is likely to be driven by the sphincters on the orogenital atrium. Urastoma cyprinae exhibits a marked seasonal pattern, with the highest levels of infection occurring during the summer and autumn, coinciding with the highest abundance of juvenile worms in the gills, and the lowest in winter. Histological examinations revealed prokaryotic infections within the digestive gland of both mussel specimens and in the digestive tract of Urastoma cyprinaeis. In the worm Urastoma cyprinaeis, 2 types of microorganisms were observed within sub-segmentary cells, a Chlamydia-like organism (CLO) and a myco-plasma-like organism (MLO). The CLO found in Urastoma cyprinaeis is the first infectious agent described in this species. It exhibits some similarities with the Chlamydiales reported in marine invertebrates, but differs in the morphology of its elementary bodies. The second intracellular microorganism found in Urastoma cyprinae appears closely related to the Mollicutes.

[cited 19 January 2011] The Boardroom Project found that marketing has been relegated to the “default” category (control costs) because it lacks metrics that reliably tie activities and costs to financial return. While issues surrounding metrics and accountability were not being ignored, practices were too narrowly focused, lacked integration, and were not predictably tied to financial return. The Boardroom Project considered that measurement standards are essential for efficient and effective functioning of a marketing-driven business because decisions about allocation of resources and assessment of results rely on credible, valid, transparent, and understandable information, and that consistent standards across industries and domains, developed by a transparent process, will be necessary to improve the situation. As was true for manufacturing and product quality with the ISO and ANSI standards, and for accounting & financial reporting with the FASB & IASB, The Boardroom Project identified the need for an industry-level authority to establish standards and ensure their continuing relevancy.Neff, Jack. \\"Mass of Metrics May Mean Marketers Know Less.\\" Advertising Age. 20 September 2010. [cited 19 January 2011] They considered that the development of generally accepted common standards for measurement and measurement processes would enhance the credibility of the marketing profession, improve the effectiveness and efficiency of marketing activities, guide continuous improvement, and enable marketing to move from discretionary business expense to board-level strategic investment.  Mission  The Mission of MASB is to “Establish marketing measurement and accountability standards across industry and domain for continuous improvement in financial performance and for the guidance and education of business decision makers and users of performance and financial information.”  Role  MASB sets standards and processes for evaluating marketing measurement to ensure credibility, validity, transparency, and understanding. The Board does not endorse specific measures. Rather, it documents how measures stack up against the Marketing Metric Audit Protocol (MMAP). The intention is that the market will select specific measures based on these evaluations. The Board's Dynamic Marketing Metrics Catalogue is intended to be the primary vehicle for documentation and publication. The Board also intends to demonstrate how to use ideal measures according to MMAP for specific marketing activities, such as TV, on-line advertising, or other specialized activities and areas. The Board also investigates practices underlying the development and management of ideal measures as well as practices utilized to create knowledge, determine causality, and apply the findings to process management for improved return.  Projects  The work of the MASB is conducted on a project basis, including the overall categories of standards, research, and concepts. Selection of priorities is based on pervasiveness of the issue, alternative solutions, technical feasibility, and resources, as well as practical consequences, convergence possibilities, and cooperative opportunities.

Cash flow both short-term and over time is the ultimate metric to which all activities of a business enterprise, including marketing, should be causally linked through the validation of intermediate marketing measures; therefore the process of validating the intermediate outcome measures against short-term and long-term cash flow drivers is necessary to forecast and improve the return.MASB.

The algorithm was conceived by John W. Suurballe and published in 1974.. The main idea of Suurballe's algorithm is to use Dijkstra's algorithm to find one path, to modify the weights of the graph edges, and then to run Dijkstra's algorithm a second time. The output of the algorithm is formed by combining these two paths, discarding edges that are traversed in opposite directions by the paths, and using the remaining edges to form the two paths to return as the output. The modification to the weights is similar to the weight modification in Johnson's algorithm, and preserves the non-negativity of the weights while allowing the second instance of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the correct second path. The problem of finding two disjoint paths of minimum weight can be seen as a special case of a minimum cost flow problem, where in this case there are two units of \\"flow\\" and nodes have unit \\"capacity\\". Suurballe's algorithm, also, can be seen as a special case of a minimum cost flow algorithm that repeatedly pushes the maximum possible amount of flow along a shortest augmenting path. The first path found by Suurballe's algorithm is the shortest augmenting path for the initial (zero) flow, and the second path found by Suurballe's algorithm is the shortest augmenting path for the residual graph left after pushing one unit of flow along the first path. Definitions Let be a weighted directed graph with vertex set and edge set (figure A); let be a designated source vertex in , and let be a designated destination vertex. Let each edge in , from vertex to vertex , have a non-negative cost . Define to be the cost of the shortest path to vertex from vertex in the shortest path tree rooted at (figure C). Note: Node and Vertex are often used interchangeably. Algorithm Suurballe's algorithm performs the following steps: # Find the shortest path tree rooted at node by running Dijkstra's algorithm (figure C). This tree contains for every vertex , a shortest path from to . Let be the shortest cost path from to (figure B). The edges in are called tree edges and the remaining edges (the edges missing from figure C) are called non-tree edges. # Modify the cost of each edge in the graph by replacing the cost of every edge by . According to the resulting modified cost function, all tree edges have a cost of 0, and non-tree edges have a non-negative cost. For example: If , then If , then # Create a residual graph formed from by removing the edges of on path that are directed into and then reverse the direction of the zero length edges along path (figure D). # Find the shortest path in the residual graph by running Dijkstra's algorithm (figure E). # Discard the reversed edges of from both paths. The remaining edges of and form a subgraph with two outgoing edges at , two incoming edges at , and one incoming and one outgoing edge at each remaining vertex. Therefore, this subgraph consists of two edge-disjoint paths from to and possibly some additional (zero-length) cycles. Return the two disjoint paths from the subgraph. Example The following example shows how Suurballe's algorithm finds the shortest pair of disjoint paths from A to F. 900px Figure A illustrates a weighted graph G. Figure B calculates the shortest path P1 from A to F (A–B–D–F). Figure C illustrates the shortest path tree T rooted at A, and the computed distances from A to every vertex (). Figure D shows the residual graph Gt with the updated cost of each edge and the edges of path 'P1 reversed. Figure E calculates path P2 in the residual graph Gt (A–C–D–B–E–F). Figure F illustrates both path P1 and path P2. Figure G finds the shortest pair of disjoint paths by combining the edges of paths P1 and P2 and then discarding the common reversed edges between both paths (B–D). As a result, we get the two shortest pair of disjoint paths (A–B–E–F) and (A–C–D–F). Correctness The weight of any path from to in the modified system of weights equals the weight in the original graph, minus . Therefore, the shortest two disjoint paths under the modified weights are the same paths as the shortest two paths in the original graph, although they have different weights. Suurballe's algorithm may be seen as a special case of the successive shortest paths method for finding a minimum cost flow with total flow amount two from to . The modification to the weights does not affect the sequence of paths found by this method, only their weights. Therefore, the correctness of the algorithm follows from the correctness of the successive shortest paths method. Analysis and running time This algorithm requires two iterations of Dijkstra's algorithm. Using Fibonacci heaps, both iterations can be performed in time O(|E+ |V|\\\\log |V|) where |Vand |Eare the number of vertices and edges respectively. Therefore, the same time bound applies to Suurballe's algorithm. Variations The version of Suurballe's algorithm as described above finds paths that have disjoint edges, but that may share vertices. It is possible to use the same algorithm to find vertex-disjoint paths, by replacing each vertex by a pair of adjacent vertices, one with all of the incoming adjacencies of the original vertex, and one with all of the outgoing adjacencies . Two edge-disjoint paths in this modified graph necessarily correspond to two vertex-disjoint paths in the original graph, and vice versa, so applying Suurballe's algorithm to the modified graph results in the construction of two vertex-disjoint paths in the original graph. Suurballe's original 1974 algorithm was for the vertex-disjoint version of the problem, and was extended in 1984 by Suurballe and Tarjan to the edge-disjoint version.. By using a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm that simultaneously computes the distances to each vertex in the graphs , it is also possible to find the total lengths of the shortest pairs of paths from a given source vertex to every other vertex in the graph, in an amount of time that is proportional to a single instance of Dijkstra's algorithm. Note: The pair of adjacent vertices resulting from the split are connected by a zero cost uni-directional edge from the incoming to outgoing vertex. The source vertex becomes and the destination vertex becomes .

Much of the fabric of the building is medieval, though the elaborate frontage was added in the 1590s and the interior was extensively restored in the 19th century. It is a Grade I listed building. History The interior Early history It is certain that the hall has been on its present site since the 14th century, and most probably since the second half of the 12th century.Blaylock 1990, p.123. It is also known that there was a guild in Exeter by 1000 AD whose hall was most likely here too.Hoskins 2004, p.24. On this basis it has been claimed to be the oldest municipal building in England still in use.See for example: The current building was constructed between 1468 and 1470. It was refaced between 1593 and 1596 at a cost of £789Hoskins 2004, p.70. in an ornate Italian style that was described by Nikolaus Pevsner as being \\"as picturesque as it is barbarous\\". The portico that juts out over the pavement is dated 1594 and its four sturdy granite columns are surmounted by highly decorated corbels of Beer stone. The upper floor, also in Beer stone, is more restrained with strapwork and 16 smaller paired pillars framing large windows that have both mullions and transoms. During renovation work it has been noted that the stonework had once been painted in cream with details in red and blue and the pillars gilded. The city stocks were once under the portico. The elaborately carved oak door, dated 1593, was made by Nicholas Baggett, a local carpenter. It leads via an anteroom to the council chamber which apparently dates between 1468 and 1470, though it was much restored in Victorian times. The arch-braced roof with seven bays is original; its main trusses rest on carved corbels representing grotesque animals. A large chandelier hangs from the centre of the roof. It was made by Thomas Pyke of Bridgwater and installed in 1789. Apart from this and the roof, all the internal fittings are Victorian, including the stained glass, the gallery, the furniture and the stone floor (all 1863) and the heavily restored Tudor panelling (1887). Above the fireplace is a bust of Queen Victoria by Henry Hugh Armstead. Under the council chamber there is an early 14th-century cellar. This was once a prison that was known as the \\"pytt of the Guyldhall\\". In the 16th century another prison, for women, was built on the ground floor at the back of the building. It remained in use until 1887. In 1858 a room was built above this to store the city's records; it was later used as a jury room. 20th century The front room above the portico, which was once the council chamber, was converted into the mayor's parlour in 1903.Blaylock 1990, pp.128, 146. In 1911 the council chamber was the location for an election petition, following the second general election of 1910, between the Liberal candidate Harold St. Maur and the Conservative Henry Duke. The guildhall, which is also a scheduled ancient monument, became a Grade I listed building in 1953. For much of the 20th century the guildhall was the meeting place of the county borough of Exeter; it continued to be the local seat of government after the formation of the enlarged City of Exeter in 1974. The mayor's parlour, which had a plaster ceiling dating from about 1800, was given a replica ceiling in 1986. The guildhall is still used for civil purposes such as official receptions, mayoral banquets, some City Council meetings, other meetings and exhibitions and occasionally as a magistrates' court. Heraldry The main chamber displays on the wooden panelling many heraldic escutcheons displaying the arms of various persons who held high office within the City Corporation, covering much of the heraldry of Devonshire. The heraldry was identified in the View of Devonshire by Thomas Westcote (d. circa 1637) View of Devonshire, Chap. XV and later expanded upon by Colby, Rev. Frederick T., in his The Heraldry of Exeter.

It has been hailed as a particularly egregious example of how California's three strikes law has led to the \\"incarceration of thousands of victims indicted on relatively minor charges.\\" Arrest and conviction In 1997 Reyes filled out an application for a driver's license under the name of his cousin, Miguel Soto. Reports differ as to whether the application was in Spanish or English, and whether the application stated that information was being provided under penalty of perjury. Upon being suspected for using a crib sheet to cheat on the test by DMV staff member Debra Alexander, Alexander confiscated the exam from Reyes and reported Reyes, who had left the DMV building, to the California Highway Patrol. After submitting to a pat down and being handcuffed, Reyes claimed that he had attempted to take the test for Soto. Prior to trial, Reyes was offered a deal of four years imprisonment in exchange for a guilty plea to the charge of perjury, but he rejected the plea deal and requested a jury trial. He was convicted on March 5, 1998 of perjury. Reyes qualified for a Three Strikes enhancement because of two prior convictions: one for residential burglary as a juvenile in 1981, and a second for armed robbery in 1987. On April 2, 1998, the trial court sentenced Reyes to an indeterminate term of 26 years to life. Controversy Circuit Judge Richard C. Tallman argued that the characterization of Reyes as a victim of excessive punishment for cheating on a driver's license exam was incorrect. Tallman pointed out that Reyes was convicted for knowingly filing a false document under oath. Tallman also argued that supporters of Reyes had understated his criminality. Tallman described Reyes as \\"a career criminal\\" who had been convicted of committing six crimes in a 16-year period, including battery, armed robbery, being under the influence of a controlled substance and driving while under the influence, and who had spent six years in prison for various offenses prior to his sentencing under the three strikes law. Supporters of Reyes such as San Francisco mayoral candidate Matt Gonzales argued that the sentence was an \\"egregious example of injustice\\" because his most recent crime amounted to little more than \\"cheating on a driver's license test.\\" Reyes has been described as \\"something of a modern-day Jean Valjean.\\" Judge Harry Pregerson pointed out that \\"Signing someone else's name on a driver's license application is specifically proscribed by the California legislature as a misdemeanor.\\" Pregerson argued that neither of the previous convictions met the standard intended by the Three Strikes law, since the first strike (burglary) involved nonviolent misbehavior as a juvenile and the second strike (robbery) did not involve harm to a person. Moreover, over eleven years had elapsed since the second strike, which was committed by Reyes at age 23.\\"3 Strikes Stories: 126 Santos Reyes,\\" FACTS (Families to Amend California's Three Strikes, accessed November 2011 Campaign to free Santos Reyes California Green Party gubernatorial candidate Peter Camejo founded the Free Santos Reyes Committee to campaign for Reyes's release.

In a 2–1 ruling the court rejected the argument that Reyes's conviction violated the U.S. Constitution's prohibition against \\"cruel and unusual punishment.\\" The Appeals Court ruling came on the heels of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in March 2003 upholding the sentence of 50 years to life for a man with two prior convictions found guilty of shoplifting videotapes. In a dissent, Judge Harry Pregerson noted that the reason Reyes had received the third-strike sentence was that he had chosen to go to trial rather than accept a plea bargain for a lesser offense, which would have carried a four-year sentence. Pregerson said, \\"I believe that punishing a person for exercising his or her constitutional rights clearly violates due process.\\" In 2005, the Ninth Circuit vacated the district court's denial of Reyes' petition challenging his sentence and remanded the case to district court for further proceedings.Santos L.

Background, family and education Löwy was born in Koprivnica to a respectable and wealthy Croatian Jewish family, who were engaged in trade. In Koprivnica he attended the gymnasium school, and after graduation in 1923, he was enrolled in the Vienna Technical College. After four semesters, in 1925 he continued his studies in Zagreb at the department of architecture in Royal Technical College. In 1927 he continued his education in Dresden, where he graduated in 1930. Career Lowy's building in Masarykova street Löwy moved to Zagreb, in 1930, where he started working in the architectural studio of Ignjat Fischer. In 1931 in collaboration with Vlado Antolić, Löwy starts a tender for the city Savings Bank project in Sarajevo. That same year he moved into the architectural studio of Stanko Kliske. Löwy became a licensed architect in 1931, and that same year he established his own architectural studio, „Löwy“. That same year he performed his first self-derived house in Petrić street 7, at the space of the former Zagreb Trust block. He married his wife Terezija Rakić in 1932, and on November 8, 1933 Löwy son Miroslav was born. Löwy realized his most important achievement in 1933, the nine floors skyscraper in Masarykova street, which will be called the \\"first skyscraper of Zagreb\\". He moved his architectural studio, in 1934, at the top floor of that same skyscraper, in Masarykova street, that he designed. From 1934 until 1941 Löwy implemented a number of major housing and business establishments in Zagreb, which belong to the very top of Croatian modernism. In 1945 he started to work on reconstruction of the Nama department stores in Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1946 Löwy was forcibly moved by communists regime to the Bureau of Architecture project (APZ), where he worked on the types of \\"rational residential buildings. Since 1950 until 1953 he was also forcibly moved to Macedonia, Skopje, where he designed the public buildings. Apartment with his studio, in Masarykova street, were returned to him in 1953 when he returned to Zagreb. After return Löwy renewed his studio in the original space. In 1962 the \\"Architectural firm Löwy\\" is merged with \\"Tehnoprojekt\\". Personal life In 1942 the work of Löwy architectural studio was prohibited by Nazis and NDH regime. Apartment with his studio, in Masarykova street, was taken away from him, and most project documentation of his studio has been destroyed. Löwy parents were immediately deported to Nazi death camps, and he somehow survived while hiding in Zagreb, one of his hiding places was truss of Art Pavilion in Zagreb.

Surviving members of his family claim that Löwy has changed, in that period, as many as 17 locations in Zagreb as he hide from Nazis and NDH regime. After the World War II things were not much better for Löwy. Under communists regime of newly founded SFR Yugoslavia he had a problems for being a Jew, but his acquaintance with sculptor Augustinčić partially helped him through those times. Retirement and death He retired in 1966. In 1970 he was awarded with the prize of Viktor Kovačić for a lifetime achievement, and in 1977 he was also awarded with the prize of Vladimir Nazor for a lifetime achievement. Löwy died on April 1, 1996 on the 9th floor of his apartment and studio skyscraper in Masarykova Street.

Establishment of sister chromatid cohesion is the process by which chromatin- associated cohesin protein becomes competent to physically bind together the sister chromatids. In general, cohesion is established during S phase as DNA is replicated, and is lost when chromosomes segregate during mitosis and meiosis. Some studies have suggested that cohesion aids in aligning the kinetochores during mitosis by forcing the kinetochores to face opposite cell poles. Cohesin loading Cohesin first associates with the chromosomes during G1 phase. The cohesin ring is composed of two SMC (structural maintenance of chromosomes) proteins and two additional Scc proteins. Cohesin may originally interact with chromosomes via the ATPase domains of the SMC proteins. In yeast, the loading of cohesin on the chromosomes depends on proteins Scc2 and Scc4. Cohesin interacts with the chromatin at specific loci. High levels of cohesin binding are observed at the centromere. Cohesin is also loaded at cohesin attachment regions (CARs) along the length of the chromosomes. CARs are approximately 500-800 base pair regions spaced at approximately 9 kilobase intervals along the chromosomes. In yeast, CARs tend to be rich in adenine-thymine base pairs. CARs are independent of origins of replication. Establishment of cohesion Establishment of cohesion refers to the process by which chromatin-associated cohesin becomes cohesion-competent. Chromatin association of cohesin is not sufficient for cohesion. Cohesin must undergo subsequent modification (\\"establishment\\") to be capable of physically holding the sister chromosomes together. Though cohesin can associate with chromatin earlier in the cell cycle, cohesion is established during S phase. Early data suggesting that S phase is crucial to cohesion was based on the fact that after S phase, sister chromatids are always found in the bound state. Tying establishment to DNA replication allows the cell to institute cohesion as soon as the sister chromatids are formed. This solves the problem of how the cell might properly identify and pair sister chromatids by ensuring that the sister chromatids are never separate once replication has occurred. The Eco1/Ctf7 gene (yeast) was one of the first genes to be identified as specifically required for the establishment of cohesion. Eco1 must be present in S phase to establish cohesion, but its continued presence is not required to maintain cohesion. Eco1 interacts with many proteins directly involved in DNA replication, including the processivity clamp PCNA, clamp loader subunits, and a DNA helicase. Though Eco1 contains several functional domains, it is the acetyltransferase activity of the protein which is crucial for establishment of cohesion. During S phase, Eco1 acetylates lysine residues in the Smc3 subunit of cohesin. Smc3 remains acetylated until at least anaphase. Once cohesin has been removed from the chromatin, Smc3 is deacetylated by Hos1. The Pds5 gene was also identified in yeast as necessary for the establishment of cohesion. In humans, the gene has two homologs, Pds5A and Pds5B. Pds5 interacts with chromatin-associated cohesin. Pds5 is not strictly establishment-specific, as Pds5 is necessary for maintenance of cohesion during G2 and M phase. The loss of Pds5 negates the requirement for Eco1. As such, Pds5 is often termed an \\"anti-establishment\\" factor. In addition to interacting with cohesin, Pds5 also interacts with Wapl (wings apart-like), another protein that has been implicated in the regulation of sister chromatid cohesion. Human Wapl binds cohesin through the Scc cohesin subunits (in humans, Scc1 and SA1). Wapl has been tied to the loss of cohesin from the chromatids during M phase. Wapl interacts with Pds5 through phenylalanine- glycine-phenylalanine (FGF) sequence motifs. One model of establishment of cohesion suggests that establishment is mediated by the replacement of Wapl in the Wapl-Pds5-cohesin complex with the Sororin protein. Like Wapl, Sororin contains an FGF domain and is capable of interacting with Pds5. In this model, put forward by Nishiyama et al., Wapl interacts with Pds5 and cohesin during G1, before establishment. During S phase, Eco1 (Esco1/Esco2 in humans) acetylates Smc3. This results in recruitment of Sororin. Sororin then replaces Wapl in the Pds5-cohesin complex. This new complex is the established, cohesion-competent cohesin state. At entry to mitosis, Sororin is phosphorylated and replaced again by Wapl, leading to loss of cohesion. Sororin also has chromatin binding activity independent of its ability to mediate cohesion. Meiosis Cohesion proteins SMC1ß, SMC3, REC8 and STAG3 appear to participate in the cohesion of sister chromatids throughout the meiotic process in human oocytes. SMC1ß, REC8 and STAG3 are meiosis specific cohesin proteins. The STAG3 protein is essential for female meiosis and fertility. Ties to DNA replication A growing body of evidence ties establishment of cohesion to DNA replication. As mentioned above, functional coupling of these two processes prevents the cell from having to later distinguish which chromosomes are sisters by ensuring that the sister chromatids are never separate after replication. Another significant tie between DNA replication and cohesion pathways is through Replication Factor C (RFC). This complex, the \\"clamp loader,\\" is responsible for loading PCNA onto DNA. An alternative form of RFC is required for sister chromatin cohesion. This alternative form is composed of core RFC proteins RFC2, RFC3, RFC4, and RFC5, but replaces the RFC1 protein with cohesion specific proteins Ctf8, Ctf18, and Dcc1. A similar function-specific alternative RFC (replacing RFC1 with Rad24) plays a role in the DNA damage checkpoint. The presence of an alternative RFC in the cohesion pathway can be interpreted as evidence in support of the polymerase switch model for cohesion establishment. Like the non-cohesion RFC, the cohesion RFC loads PCNA onto DNA. Some of the evidence tying cohesion and DNA replication comes from the multiple interactions of Eco1. Eco1 interacts with PCNA, RFC subunits, and a DNA helicase, Chl1, either physically or genetically. Studies have also found replication-linked proteins which influence cohesion independent of Eco1. The Ctf18 subunit of the cohesion-specific RFC can interact with cohesin subunits Smc1 and Scc1. Hypothesized model for the pro- and anti-establishment functions of replication factor C complexes in sister chromatid cohesion. Polymerase switch model Though the protein was originally identified as a Topoisomerase I redundant factor, the TRF4 gene product was later shown to be required for sister chromatid cohesion. Wang et al. showed that Trf4 is actually a DNA polymerase, which they called Polymerase κ. This polymerase is also referred to as Polymerase σ. In the same paper in which they identified Pol σ, Wang et al. suggested a polymerase switch model for establishment of cohesion. In this model, upon reaching a CAR, the cell switches DNA polymerases in a mechanism similar to that used in Okazaki fragment synthesis. The cell off-loads the processive replication polymerase and instead uses Pol σ for synthesis of the CAR region. It has been suggested that the cohesion- specific RFC could function in off-loading or on-loading PNCA and polymerases in such a switch. Ties to DNA damage pathways Changes in patterns of sister chromatid cohesion have been observed in cases of DNA damage. Cohesin is required for repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). One mechanism of DSB repair, homologous recombination (HR), requires the presence of the sister chromatid for repair at the break site. Thus, it is possible that cohesion is required for this process because it ensures that the sister chromatids are physically close enough to undergo HR. DNA damage can lead to cohesin loading at non-CAR sites and establishment of cohesion at these sites even during G2 phase. In the presence of ionizing radiation (IR), the Smc1 subunit of cohesin is phosphorylated by the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase. ATM is a key kinase in the DNA damage checkpoint. Defects in cohesion can increase genome instability, a result consistent with the ties between cohesion and DNA damage pathways. In the bacterium Escherichia coli, repair of mitomycin C-induced DNA damages occurs by a sister chromatid cohesion process involving the RecN protein. Sister chromatid interaction followed by homologous recombination appears to significantly contribute to the repair of DNA double- strand damages. Medical relevance Defects in the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion have serious consequences for the cell and are therefore tied to many human diseases. Failure to establish cohesion correctly or inappropriate loss of cohesion can lead to missegregation of chromosomes during mitosis, which results in aneuploidy. The loss of the human homologs of core cohesin proteins or of Eco1, Pds5, Wapl, Sororin, or Scc2 has been tied to cancer. Mutations affecting cohesion and establishment of cohesion are also responsible for Cornelia de Lange Syndrome and Roberts Syndrome. Diseases arising from defects in cohesin or other proteins involved in sister chromatid cohesion are referred to as cohesinopathies. Cornelia de Lange Syndrome Genetic alterations in genes NIPBL, SMC1A, SMC3, RAD21 and HDAC8 are associated with Cornelia de Lange Syndrome. The proteins encoded by these genes all function in the chromosome cohesion pathway that is employed in the cohesion of sister chromatids during mitosis, DNA repair, chromosome segregation and the regulation of developmental gene expression. Defects in these functions likely underlie many of the features of Cornelia de Lang Syndrome.

He has performed as a solo artist and has been the frontman for Richard Bivens & Foreign Press, Regrets and Brunettes and Grief Thief. He currently resides in Oakland, California. Early life Richard began writing songs at the age of 10, mostly of the R&B; and hip-hop variety. His focus began to narrow in on rock music as he got older, and at the age of 15 he taught himself how to play guitar. He developed a unique style of playing a right handed guitar upside down and for the majority of his early career strummed without a pick. As a child, Bivens was strongly considered for the lead role in the 1993 film Free Willy. He also appeared on an episode of VH1's Rock and Roll Jeopardy! at the age of 21, and became the show's youngest winner ever.https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4kgnlM8EaNiRVFRSDlqQmw5ekU/view Richard Bivens & Foreign Press Consisting of high school friend Robert Pavlovich on bass guitar, Ali Ghanavat on rhythm guitar, and Dylan Kato on drums, Bivens formed Richard Bivens & Foreign Press, with the band recording their sole album Absolute Beginners in San Francisco, CA at Lucky Cat Recordings with producer Tony Leong. The album, consisting of 7 tracks and recorded on analog tape, was released in May 2006.http://www.ocregister.com/articles/richardbivens-78830-localmusic- orangecounty.html The band played several gigs in and around the Orange County, Los Angeles, and San Diego area until breaking up in late 2007. Regrets and Brunettes After Foreign Press, Bivens began to work on new material in early 2008. He rehearsed the songs with Pavlovich and Kato and from there realized that he wanted to start up another project. The trio settled on the band name Regrets and Brunettes and swiftly entered themselves back in the local live music scene. For the first few shows, the band auditioned a plethora of musicians (including keyboardists) before rounding out their lineup with guitarist Anthony Chu in the Spring of 2008. With Chu, the band took their songwriting and musicianship to a new level. At Night You Love Me With this new lineup, Bivens and company spent nearly 12 months in their rehearsal space called the Rec Room in Anaheim, CA recording new material. The end result was the 2009 album entitled At Night You Love Me (the name came from Bivens' love-hate relationship with a traffic light near his apartment) released on Campaign Set Records. ANYLM was well received by local and foreign critics alike. Whereas Absolute Beginners was more raw and warmer sounding, the band took their time to craft each song with ambient guitar and keyboard parts and more detailed arrangements. The album certainly fit the indie-rock mold, but its hard to deny the older and more pop-driven influences of Neil Young, Spoon, Pavement, and Big Star - all artists that Bivens idolized throughout his career. Breakup Although the band achieved mild success with the album and played shows with the likes of Delta Spirit, The Henry Clay People, and Pepper Rabbit they found it hard to balance lives as musicians and lives as professionals. Pavlovich gained more responsibility becoming a father and Chu became a full-time medical student. The difficulties in scheduling time for the band caused enough friction that the band broke up officially in August 2010. They posthumously released their final song called \\"Facts & Figures.\\" Solo career After Bivens formed Regrets and Brunettes, guitarist Ali Ghanavat decided to reset Foreign Press, without Bivens on vocals. He recruited singer Juanita Mankuleiyo (who performed backup vocals on Absolute Beginners), bassist and childhood friend Jeff Basin, as well as Foreign Press's original drummer Richard Rizk. Foreign Press revitalizes songs that Bivens has written over the past decade, as well as performing new songs written specifically for this new incarnation of the band. In 2013, Foreign Press released their self-titled debut, consisting of 13 songs each written by Bivens.http://www.ocregister.com/soundcheck/ghanavat-540610-band-press.html Grief Thief Bivens relocated to Oakland, California in 2012 to begin work on his debut solo album with Absolute Beginners producer Tony Leong. Over the next couple of years, dozens of tracks were recorded with an assorted cast of Bay Area musicians, including members of The Matches, Facing New York, Con Brio, Tumbleweed Wanderers and The Soft White Sixties. Although more than an album’s worth of material was compiled, Bivens and Leong scrapped many of the recordings and left others to die in their infancy. In 2016, Bivens restarted the project with Leong under the artist name Grief Thief. Joined by Jeremy Lyon (lead guitar), Zak Mandel-Romann (bass), Patrick Monaco Glynn (keys) and Omar Cuellar (drums), their efforts culminated in the 2017 EP release of Laugh Tracks.https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/laugh-tracks-ep/1206050649  References   External links  * [www.facebook.com/bivensmusic - Bivens] Category:American male singers Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:Musicians from Downey, California Category:Singers from California Category:Guitarists from California Category:American male guitarists Category:21st-century American singers Category:21st-century American guitarists Category:21st-century male singers ","title":"Richard Bivens"},{"id":"29993477","text":"Hillside Books, Canterbury was a publisher specialising in books on entomology and small equipment associated with this science.

She has participated in more than 10,000 skydiveshttp://www.skydivepuertoescondido.com/ and won several awards and world records. She has gone on four skydives while completely naked, and on five occasions her parachute did not open in mid-jump. In 2010, Mancino was named the World's Sexiest Female Athlete by the magazine Men's Fitness. Biography Born in Italy, Mancino was 16 when she did her first modeling work for a magazine. She started skydiving in October 2001. Mancino convinced her best friend, a skydiver, to take her on a jump even though he encouraged her not to because it was too dangerous. She began to take it more seriously as a profession when people started asking her to coach them. Eventually, Mancino started participating in international competitions. She regularly trains at the Skyventure XP Paraclete in North Carolina. Her parachute has malfunctioned five times though she was able to use the reserve. She has also made four jumps while completely naked for magazine photo shoots. In 2008, Mancino appeared on the Italian television program Le Iene with Marco Berry, jumping topless and demonstrating her freeflying and sit flying skills. Mancino met her former boyfriend, BASE jumper Jeb Corliss, in 2009 after he learned about her jumps and arranged to meet her. In 2009, after having made about 5,500 skydives, Mancino started BASE jumping along with Corliss. She performed in 115 BASE jumps (35 with wingsuit) between August 2009 and September 2011. Also inspired by Corliss, she began wingsuit flying, which involves jumping from an aircraft wearing a jumpsuit with webbed wings similar to a flying squirrel. This led to proximity flying, which is the flying of a wingsuit in close proximity to cliffs and trees during the flight, the jumper then deploys their parachute once they have moved a safe distance away from any hazards (similar to BASE jumping in this respect). One of her dreams is to BASE jump off the Burj Khalifa, the tallest man-made structure in the world, and circle around it as she goes down. She also aspires to jump out of a plane and reenter the same plane as it dives. She has participated in big way formation skydiving. Regarding freestyle skydiving, Mancino said, \\"It becomes kind of boring to me because it’s too solitary ... I prefer group activity\\". As a model, she has appeared in Men's Fitness, Vanity Fair, Allure, Maxim, Men's Health, Max. In 2010, Mancino was named the World's Sexiest Female Athlete by the magazine Men's Fitness. As of December 2010, Mancino has gone on more than 7,000 skydives. In 2014 she was a coach on the TV show Calzedonia Ocean Girls. Records and awards In 2003, Roberta Mancino placed first in the Malevski Cup at the Russia Freestyle and the Space Games Freestyle. In 2004, she won first place in the Tunnel Competition in Orlando, Florida. She received both the Italian Record and Euro Record for skydiving in 2005, and won first place in the Tunnel Competition in Perris Valley, California. In 2007, Mancino broke the European Record for Formation Freefly and the World Record for Formation 69-Way Freefly. Also that year, she placed first in the Italian Nationals of Skydiving.

However, the vine is very prone to damage caused by the onset of powdery mildew late in the growing season. Wine regions Historically, plantings of Brugnola in the Valtellina region (pictured) were officially counted as being Fortana vines. While Brugnola was still officially considered only a synonym of Fortana in the 2000 Italian census, nearly all of the plantings of Brugnola in the Valtellina region are believed to be actual Brugnola plantings.

It was awarded Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC) status in 1967, and promoted to Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) in 1987, with a name change instituted in 2011. History There is much history and legend associated with the Albana di Romagna area. One story from 435 AD concerns the daughter of Roman Emperor Theodosius II. She arrived in a small village on a white donkey, and the villagers were so overcome with her beauty that they offered her some of the area's sweet and excellent wine (Albana) from a simple terra cotta jug. Completely enamored of this delicious, unctuous nectar, Galla Placida exclaimed, \\"You should not drink this wine in such a humble container. Rather it should be drunk in gold (berti in oro) to render homage to its smoothness.\\" From that day on, the village was called Bertinoro and the wine was drunk from refined goblets at the court of Ravenna. This wine was also described in the 13th century by medieval wine writer Pietro de' Crescenzi as being \\"very strong and of noble taste, well suited for long maturation and at the same time quite subtle … the best of this type of grape can be had at Forlì and throughout the Romagna\\". Today, Albana di Romagna's claim to fame is that it was the first of the area's white wines to receive its DOCG classification (in 1987). However, there has been controversy surrounding this ranking and it has been considered \\"a political response to pressure from Romagna's wine producers\\". Another factor which disputes its status is the maximum yield per hectare, currently standing at 140 quintals; this high limit appears to discredit the DOCG law for making quality wine. Production is concentrated mainly around Spungone Romagnolo, extending from Bertinoro to the Imola hills, a strip of the Apennines that extends east from Bologna as far as the Adriatic Sea. The area’s terroir is an excellent home for the Albana variety: the hillside sites offer a mixture of rocky, limestone and chalk soils; and the hot, dry Mediterranean climate is tempered by cooling breezes from the Adriatic Sea, resulting in cooler summers and a wider diurnal temperature variation. This all encourages higher-quality wines. The best vineyards are located on the well-drained foothills of the Apennines. Characteristics The DOCG covers four styles of Albana di Romagna: secco, amabile, dolce, and passito, with varying degrees of alcohol (11.5–15.5%). A sparkling version, Romagna Albana Spumante, can also be made but may only use a DOC classification. The Albana variety is fairly light bodied with good acidity and contains considerable residual sugar, resulting in its noteworthy ability to make a sweeter wine. It is usually produced in a dry style, with distinctive underlying peach and almond notes, a strong line of refreshing acidity and some complexity. The passito is the area’s biggest star. Albana di Romagna may not be considered world class and the quality may be variable, but in the hands of expert wine producers who choose to keep their yields low, this wine can achieve distinction. Grapes are dried in on the vine, in small boxes, on wooden grates or using air indoors; vinification occurs in wooden barriques or in stainless steel. The passito version of Albana di Romagna must be available for sale by September 1 of the year following the harvest for the standard wine, and as a riserva by December 1. With its quince- and apricot-rich intensity, and nuances of magnolia, honey and spice, it is the only style that has a minimum aging time of ten months, or 13 for the riserva designation.

The name of Siksakubur was chosen by Gorust that inspired by Brazilian metal band Sepultura meaning 'grave' in Portuguese as benchmark of their musicality. None of the band founders are listed as band members today, but the legacy of Siksakubur was continued by Andre Tiranda. Siksakubur is a band that started they career crept from the grave, began from small concerts and events until international scale events has been through.

Siksakubur also listed as Metal Hammer's \\"Top 10 Best Indonesian Metal Bands\\" and awarded The Hammersonic Awards as \\"Breakthrough of The Year\\" at The Hammersonic Festival on . History Siksakubur began when Gorust got together with his schoolmates who had the same musical interest to see metal bands rehearsing in a music studio near their school in the s. Among these metal bands that are still around today are Purgatory, Tengkorak and Betrayer. The 's inaugural line-up consisted of Gorust (Drum), Godel (Vocal/Guitar), Has (Bass), Bembenx (Guitar) and Rosadist (Guitar). This formation only lasted until since Has (Bassist) left the band then the band's hiatus between and . Angga Burgenk joined the band as new Bass player In , but shortly after Burgenk became a member, Bembenx decided to quit the band the same year, followed by Rosadist a few months later, leaving the band with no Guitarists by end of and no album released during this period. Nowadays more than 2 decades of their long journey, Siksakubur has become one of the supergroups in Indonesian underground metal music scene and the most productive metal band for album releases. The name of Siksakubur was chosen after the band previously used another name which coincidentally was the same as the existing bands at that time. Early formation and The Carnage (1999–2001) In , Siksakubur faced difficult situation as they had no guitarist left until they decided that Godel taken over of guitar position and Prahari \\"Japs\\" Mahardika as Vocalist. The 's formation became Gorust (Drum), Godel (Guitar), Burgenk (Bass) and Japs (Vocal). This formation was ready for recording process and was considered as the beginning of the band's journey at that time. All members of this formation was also considered as founders of the band. The band started to enter the studio in to record 5 songs then record another 4 songs in early to complete the debut. This debut finally release in under the label of Extreme Soul Production based in Bandung that received positive responses from metalheads in underground community and Indonesian music enthusiasts. All songs of this album was composed by Gorust, mixing and mastering was engineered by Wanda, produced by Iwan \\"D\\". The band's artwork logo was designed by Japs, album artwork layout by Ditto and designed by One-tmo. The Carnage was remastered and reissued in and (for limited number of copies) through the same label. Back to Vengeance (2002) A year after the debut, Siksakubur released second album titled Back to Vengeance under the label of Rottrevore Records in . They also began to expand their stage performance through major events where mostly held in the islands of Java to Bali, Kalimantan, Sulawesi and other cities throughout the country. The band was also invited to play at the school art performances where it was very rare for extreme metal music to appear at school stages by that time. The album composed of 11 songs and reissued in through Zim Zum Entertainment an independent underground label based in Jakarta. Working process of this album was recorded by end of , mixing process engineered by Yuda and mastering by Adi and Gorust. Godel departure (2002) However, shortly after the release of their second album, Guitarist and one of the founders of the band, Godel decided to leave the band to manage his business outside the group then later replaced by Andre \\"Bacot\\" Tiranda (Revitol) (also known as Bacot) as guitarist. During this period Bimorbid (Absolute Defiance) also joined the band to complete the line-up as secondary guitarist. But this formation only holds a few months after Bimorbid left the band then followed by Burgenk for study reasons. Then Yuli \\"Bebek\\" Wahyudianto (also known as Yudi Bebek) joined the band to complete the formation, the line-up became Gorust (Drum), Andre (Guitar), Yudi Bebek (Bass) and Japs (Vocal). Eye Cry (2003–2006) The Eye Cry released under the same label with the previous album by Rottrevore Records in . This third album composed of 10 songs, collaborated with RinsDark (Gelap) and Sapta \\"Moel\\" Mulya (Eternal Madness) that received high appreciation from Indonesian music enthusiasts and has positive response specially songs of \\"Pasukan Jiwa Terbelakang\\" (\\"Squad of Retarded Soul\\"), \\"Renounce Me\\" and \\"Destitusi Menuju Mati\\" (\\"Destitution Towards Mortality\\") that successfully penetrated through National mainstream media. During this period, the double album of The Carnage and Back to Vengeance was released through From Beyond Records based in Netherlands for distribution in Europe and United States markets.

This album has been reissued 2 times in and through Off The Records an independent underground sub-label of Bravo Musik. Unlike the previous 2 albums The Carnage and Back to Vengeance, the poor quality of sound recording due to recording facilities and technology in extreme metal scene are not sophisticated as today. This is acceptable by that time and became the hallmark of local death metal albums in 2000s era, adding to the brutality of the sound which was full of blast-beats and low-tuned guitars. Eye Cry is almost completely filled with clear sounds where various instrumentations can be heard clearly that Siksakubur succeeded in bringing great energy through complex arrangements. However it is not merely the complexity that the band wants to achieve, but becomes a pathway for chord progression and execution of highly skilled instruments that taking the quality of death metal arrangement and musicality to the new level. Podium (2007) The fourth album of Siksakubur titled Podium was released in , continued to album promotion tours including mini tour of Java-Bali road show titled \\"Agenda Bencana Tour 2008\\" and got an opportunity to be the headliner of \\"Gegey Fest\\" in Kuala Lumpur.

Unlike the band's previous albums, all the songs composed in Indonesian, except Pantera cover song. The album produced by Rio, artwork was designed by Yopi Kucing, layout by Andre and concept by Japs. Gorust departure (2007–2008) Podium was the final and farewell album of the founder, conceptor and leader of Siksakubur, Andyan Gorust that finally decided to leave the band shortly after Podium was finished the recording sessions, leaving Japs as the remaining original member of the band to continue the journey with Andre and the rest members of the band. Siksakubur auditioned for drummer and Prama \\"Jangexz\\" Pramurdito (Alexander/Last Suffer) were selected to replace Gorust. During this period, Yudi Bebek followed Gorust quit the band due to other activities outside the group then his position replaced by Rodewin \\"Ewien\\" Naiborhu (Bloody Gore/Grausig). By end of the formation became Andre (Guitar), Jagenxz (Drum), Japs (Vocal) and Ewien (Bass). Tentara Merah Darah (2009–2010) The work of Tentara Merah Darah was took approximately a year until recording process by end then released in through the label of Fast Youth Records. This fifth album composed of 11 songs that collaborated with Rinsdark, Moel and Rifki Bachtiar as guest vocalist on several tracks of the album. This album introduced a new theme post Gorust era with different structure of musicality performed by Jagenxz that expected to be able to keep up with other band members.

Then Adhytia Perkasa (Funeral Inception) joined the formation to replace Jagenxz as a new Drummer and later on Baken Nainggolan (Betrayer) joined to replace Bije completing the formation as new Guitarist. The Band's formation of became Andre (Guitar), Baken (Guitar), Ewien (Bass), Adhytia (Drum) and Asep (Vocal). But this formation did not last long either. Prior the work for the next album St. Kristo, Ewien decided to leave the band, then Arinanda Gilang Pratama (known as Ananda) joined the band to replace Ewien shortly after the album was completed. St. Kristo (2012–2013) St. Kristo was released on followed by album launching event the following month on at Kemang, Jakarta.

Siksakubur began promoting the album through domestic stage performances until they had an opportunity returned to neighboring country visiting 6 cities throughout Malaysia. During this period, the formation also did not last long where several months later, Arinanda Gilang Pratama (Bass) quit the band then later replaced by Dena Rendisah Prabandara as the new Bassist to complete the line up. The new formation became Andre (Guitar), Baken (Guitar), Adhytia (Drum), Rudy (Vocal) and Dena (Bass).

The information was announced on Siksakubur's Official Facebook Page that Baken Nainggolan is no longer member of Siksakubur. Main reason was due to indisciplinary issue, but Baken felt that he has been removed from the Band due to no transparency and openness in the band's internal management and there was no longer a sense of kinship in the band. During this period the formation of the band changed again with Dena departure, until Ricky Rangga (Damnation) joined to replace Baken and Gilang Dwi Pristianto (Nithael) to replace Dena, then the formation became Andre (Guitar), Adhytia (Drum), Rudy (Vocal), Ricky (Guitar) and Gilang (Bass).

An American destroyer escort attacked the former German U-boat , which had been given to the Japanese Navy and renamed RO-501. The boat was the first of two Japanese vessels sunk in the European Theater of Operations. Action Due to arrangements made by German Vice Admiral Paul H. Weneker in 1944, a group of Japanese sailors under Lieutenant Commander Norita Sadatoshi were sent to Germany to receive training in submarine warfare. After they were given the recently launched U-1224 to sail back to Japan with a precious cargo of mercury, lead, steel, aluminum drawings, optical glass, blueprints for a IXC type U-boat and Messerschmitt Me 163A Komet jet aircraft. Allied intelligence discovered that the Japanese were sailing a submarine from Germany to Asia, so Task Group 22.2 (TG 22.2) of the United States Navy was ordered to intercept them.

Lieutenant John E. Johansen in Robinson was patrolling alone a few hundred miles northwest of the Cape Verdes when at sunset about 19:00, her crew made a sound contact with a submarine. Johansen ordered his men to battle stations, and at a range of the Americans opened fire with hedgehog bombs which detonated over the area where the submarine was heard. A few moments later, Robinson was over the area itself and dropped a series of Mark 8 depth charges. Seven seconds later, two underwater explosions were heard, indicating that some of the hedgehogs hit and damaged RO-501. A few seconds after, three successive explosions from the depth charges sent up huge columns of water. Three minutes later, a loud roar was produced by another large underwater explosion, said to have killed fish up to a quarter of a league from the battle area.

Starring Terence Hill and Bud Spencer, it is a sequel to They Call Me Trinity (1970). It was shot extensively in Campo Imperatore, Abruzzo. The film was the top- grossing Italian film of its time. Plot In the opening sequence, Bambino (Bud Spencer) is walking through the desert carrying his saddle and finds four escaped convicts, from whom he steals their beans and horses. This scene is followed by the opening credits and the title song, after which we see Trinity (Terence Hill) on his travois. He too comes across the convicts frying more beans, and also tricks them. Trinity then continues to his family home and finds Bambino having a bath. Trinity smells so bad that he is told to bathe, too, before everyone starts lunch. When the four convicts show up and try to rob the family, the mother sneaks around from the back and ushers them out with a shotgun after they are relieved yet again of their guns and money. That night, the father pretends to be dying and makes Trinity and Bambino promise to work together. As Bambino is teaching Trinity how to be a successful horse thief, they see a wagon with two tired mules and decide to rob the passengers. But all they find is a family with a sick baby (nicknamed \\"Little Windy\\" by Bambino) and a young girl who falls for Trinity. The family isn't moving because of a broken wheel, so Bambino lifts the wagon and Trinity changes the wheel, before giving the family some of the money they have stolen. As the film progresses they keep encountering the family, with much the same gags. When Trinity and Bambino arrive in town, they head to the local saloon. Inside, Trinity, Bambino, and two cowboys play cards with a professional sharper named Wild Card Hendricks. Thanks to his superior skills, Trinity deals everybody a potentially winning hand. However, his cards are better, so he wins and is accused by Hendricks of being a cheat. When they square off, Trinity displays his extreme speed by drawing his gun a number of times, each time holstering it and then slapping Hendricks in the face, all before Wild Card can react. As he leaves, Wild Card tries to shoot Trinity from behind but is foiled once again. Campo Imperatore valley in Abruzzo Trinity and Bambino buy new suits with their winnings. Running into the family they helped earlier, they convince the family that they are federal agents working undercover as supposed outlaws, with Bambino as \\"The Captain\\" and Trinity \\"The Lieutenant\\". Then the brothers go into a smart restaurant for dinner, consuming huge quantities of food with a notable lack of table manners. When they leave, they meet a man who, believing the story about their being federal agents, gives them four thousand dollars to \\"keep their eyes shut.\\" The two brothers now travel to a town called San José where they start a bar brawl with some convicts they recognize. These they take to the local sheriff for the bounty. The sheriff informs Trinity and Bambino that everyone in San José works for the man who paid them the four thousand dollars and that they should avoid the local mission especially. Paying a visit to the mission to check things out, Bambino pretends that he has come to confess, considerably shocking the priest with his long list of transgressions (covered up by loud organ music so the audience can't hear). That night they find that the man who paid them off also uses the mission for gun-running and to store stolen loot, with his men disguised as monks. The brothers convince the real monks into helping them beat the outlaws, while actually planning to take the loot for themselves. After a long fight, which the brothers and the monks naturally win, a group of Rangers shows up and arrests the outlaws. One of them thinks he recognizes Bambino as a wanted horse thief; to allay his suspicions, Trinity repeats that they are federal agents and gives the Ranger the stolen loot. As they ride away squabbling, they see the pioneering family stuck fording the river (as they were once before) and the film ends with Trinity riding down to help them.

The event became a media circus on both sides of the Atlantic. On Christmas, 1945, Medical Corpsman Frank Hayostek returned by sea from military duty in France. Feeling lonesome, he stuffed a note into an aspirin bottle, corked it and tossed it over the side of the SS James Ford Rhodes. The note read: \\"Dear Finder, I am an American soldier . .. 21 years old . . . just a plain American of no wealth, but just enough to get along with. This is my third Christmas from home . . . God bless you.\\" Eight months later Hayostek received a response from Breda O'Sullivan, 18-year-old resident of Lispole. The pair became pen pals and over the course of the next seven years they exchanged 70 letters. In the summer of 1952 Hayostek traveled to County Kerry to finally meet O'Sullivan. His two-week stay was shadowed by a flock of reporters and photographers who \\"tried to fan the romance into flame.\\" The publicity was too much for the shy O'Sullivan who would later describe the notoriety as \\"gruelling\\" and Hayostek returned to Pennsylvania without her. In 1958 he married a local girl and had a son named Terry Francis Hayostek. The following year he received his last letter from Breda. His wife died in 1965 from cancer. The Tribune Democrat rekindled the story in 2004. Frank Hayostek died on November 15, 2009 at the age of 85. In 2012 to coincide with the 60th anniversary of Frank's trip to Ireland, RTÉ Radio (Irish National Radio) announced it was making a documentary titled 'Message in a Bottle' for its award-winning 'Doc on One' series. It was revealed on this programme that Frank had told Breda he had been previously married and had the marriage annulled. Breda then spurned him as she held very strong Catholic views on marriage.

The abbey was in the Catholic Diocese of Lisieux. Closely associated with the family of William, Duke of Normandy, the abbey was instrumental in the Normans taking control over the Church in England in the centuries following the Norman Conquest of England, establishing new churches and priories in England, and Abbots of Grestain ordained many English priests. Many churches mentioned in the Domesday Book cite Grestain as the founding establishment. History The Abbey was founded in 1050 by Herluin de Conteville and his wife Arlette, mother of William the Conqueror. Herluin, a victim of leprosy, was said to have seen a vision of the Blessed Virgin Mary who told him to take a spa treatment at the source of the Carbec stream in Grestain (Carbec meaning \\"the Stream of Kari\\"). Cured, he decided to build an abbey in the nearby Valley of Vilaine dedicated to the Virgin and a chapel at Carbec, a site also dedicated to the healing spring of Saint-Méen.Jacques Choffel, Mais où sont les Normandes d'antan ?, Lanore, Paris, 1988, Google books Herluin's son, Robert de Mortain, half-brother of William, was the principal benefactor, endowing it with his revenues from England. In 1358, the abbey was sacked by the Anglo-Navarrais. The monks took refuge at their safe house in Rouen, in the parish of Saint-Eloi. Between 15 November 1364 and 10 August 1365, the abbey was attacked once more. On the return of the monks, the abbey had been partly destroyed and nearly rased to the ground. The abbey was officially closed in 1757 on the orders of the bishop. The church buildings were demolished around 1766 and the rest of abbey destroyed in 1790; of these buildings, only a few ruins remain, integrated into the Château de La Pommeraye (a private property): a defensive wall, a 13th-Century portal, an 18th-Century manor with a 13th-Century floor, and remains of the church. A monument has been erected to the memory of the founders who were buried in the now defunct church: Arlette, Herluin and Robert de Mortain, as well as Robert's wife, Mathilde de Montgomerie, daughter of Roger de Montgomerie.Site de l'abbaye Notre-Dame de Grestain Arms of the Abbey Azure with three gold fleurs de lys.Alfred Canel, Armorial de la province des villes de Normandie, Rouen: A.

It is currently owned by James Curran and has agreed to sell the station to the Raritan River Railroad Historical Society for one dollar if they can find the means of moving it off of his property. For a number of years he has been using the station as a storage room. He has recently stopped this as a result of the stations deteriorating condition. History The freight station was built in the early 1900s, it was a shelter that had been renovated to a station. The first passenger train had reached Milltown in 1891, possibly because at that time, the Meyer Company had the Lawrence Brook Mill running day and night. And with the railroad, the industry of Milltown flourished. On March 24, 1934, the station had gotten an express system and a Railway Express agent to ship mail and cargo through the Raritan River Railroad (RRRR). As World War I hit the United States, the station became busier, with an average of 22 passenger trains running per day. And with the ammunition plant in Sayreville, about 9000 passengers came through the station per day. A schedule for the freight station. Every stop is on the Raritan River Railroad But in the 1930s, the Depression hit Milltown and the station hard. The Michelin Tire Company (the former Meyer Company) left the mill, making freight volumes go down by nearly 50%. The freight station was almost abandoned in favor of buses, and fewer passenger trains stopped there. By 1938, there was only one passenger train left that stopped in the station. New Brunswick and South Amboy also had services choked off. By April, barely anyone would enter the station. Even the express freight would not pass through the station again. Though the station was in business, the trains didn't move as fast; not much would change over the next 30 years. World War II brought a temporary surge of traffic to the station, as well as dirt and sand for the construction of the New Jersey Turnpike in the 1950s. Steam engines were replaced by diesel engines in 1956, and the Lawrence Brook Mill was rented to a few other companies. It kept the line connected, but rarely used. After that, only packages would go in and out of the station; the freight used was called less than car load (LCL) freight. But this service was discontinued in the 1960s. There was a transition from an industrial based to a commercial based economy in New Jersey. In the early 1970s, the RRRR had been subsequently owned by the Central Jersey Railroad Company, which had been bankrupt since 1967. In 1971, Penn Central Railroad also went bankrupt. The Consolidated Railroad Company (Conrail) was created by the US government to acquire all of the bankrupt companies such as Penn Central; it was necessary to keep freight moving for the economy in 1976. Amtrak was created for the same goal in 1971; only it was to move people from city to city. The RRRR would not join the 1976 Conrail system, not until April 1980 was it absorbed into Conrail because all of the freight's parent companies had been absorbed. As of June 2016, the Raritan River Chapter of the NRHS has raised enough funds to start the process of moving the freight station. Minor setbacks have occurred such as the rapid deterioration of the station as well as the main freight door being broken into. However these events haven't deterred the Raritan River NRHS and with an agreeable price for a concrete foundation with Milltown-based Brown and Glynn, the future looks quite bright for what seems to be the last original train station in New Jersey.

Built in 1912 as a 2-8-0 Consolidation-type by the American Locomotive Company of Schenectady, New York, for the St. Louis–San Francisco Railway (SLSF or \\"Frisco\\"), the engine was later rebuilt into a 2-8-2 Mikado-type to keep up with the traffic demands around World War II. Once retired the engine was stored in many locations under several owners until it ended up in a small engine house in rural Illinois. The locomotive was disassembled by a group with the intent to restore it; however, the group went defunct. American Steam Railroad (\\"ASR\\") was started and in 2005 purchased the 1352 to restore the engine to operating condition. Currently in 2014 the locomotive sits partially disassembled in Taylorville, Illinois as ASR raises the funds to move the 1352 to Cleveland Ohio to be restored. As of 2016, the locomotive remained in Taylorville. History The locomotive was built in April 1912 as Frisco 1321, a 2-8-0 Consolidation type, by the American Locomotive Company at the Schenectady Locomotive Works. Due to the demands of World War II the Frisco railroad needed more heavy power to keep up with the demands in traffic. The War Board at that time would not allow new locomotives to be built, so the Frisco took the task of rebuilding 6 Consolidations into Mikados. In June 1944 #1321 Consolidation was converted into Mikado #1352. The locomotive went through a major overhaul/modernization including adding of Nicholas Thermic Syphones, JR Coffin Superheaters and a JR Coffin Feed Water System. The engine continued in regular service until 1956 when 1352 was retired and donated to Swope Park in Kansas City, Missouri, for display. Stored outside in the park, Frisco 1352 deteriorated greatly during the years on display and vandalism took its toll on the locomotive. Because of flooding and vandalism, the KC Park Board wanted the 1352 removed, and in the late 1970s to early 1980s it was donated to Smoky Hill Railway and Historical Society provided that the group remove it from the park. The Missouri Pacific Railroad (MoPac) refused to allow its rail to be cut for a temporary turnout, so the movers constructed, for lack of a better description, a \\"vertical frog and vertical points\\" to lift the locomotive over the rails and then onto the MoPac mainline. After its removal from Swope Park, Smoky Hill Railway and Historical Society kept the 1352 in an industrial park in Riverside, Missouri, where it suffered flooding on at least one occasion. Cash-strapped Smoky Hill Railway and Historical Society sold the locomotive to Ted Leman, and he moved it to Illinois for restoration and operation.

On 1 December 2010, three Russians and one Ukrainian were seriously injured within minutes of each other, and on 5 December 2010 a German woman was killed, when they were attacked while wading or snorkeling near the shoreline. The attacks were described as \\"unprecedented\\" by shark experts. In response to the attacks, beaches in the popular tourist resort were closed for over a week, dozens of sharks were caught and killed, and the local government issued new rules banning shark feeding and restricting swimming. A variety of theories were put forward to explain the attacks. This includes overfishing in the Red Sea or on the illegal or inadvertent feeding of sharks or smaller fish close to the shore, which produced scents that attracted more sharks. Another theory considers the dumping of sheep carcasses in the Red Sea by a livestock transport during the Islamic festival of Eid al-Adha had attracted the sharks to the shore. Attacks The first attacks occurred on 1 December, when four people were attacked within minutes of each other in the Ra's Nasrani area. 48-year-old Olga Martynenko suffered a severe spinal injury and wounds to her hands and legs, while 70-year-old Lyudmila Stolyarova lost her right hand and left leg. Both had to have their injured limbs partly amputated.

Before she got out of the water, the shark attacked again and bit off her foot.\\" Other witnesses described the attack on Olga Martynenko. \\"The woman managed to swim to the pier, but when people on the pier started pulling her out of the water, the shark bit off the woman's left buttock,\\" one said. \\"She lost a lot of blood. There were tourists on the pier, and they helped to pull the woman out. Some of them were slapping the shark off with rubber fins. There were no rescuers on the pier during the moment when it all happened. A rescuer was running up to us from afar. There were neither cords, nor stretchers at hand. We used a swimsuit to block the blood flow from the gaping wound and grabbed a sun bed to carry the woman to the shore.\\" The attacks on the two men were witnessed from the shore.

In response, officials closed the beaches and suspended all diving and watersports activities. Specialists from the Egyptian environment ministry were called in to investigate the incidents and caught a -long oceanic whitetip shark weighing that was claimed to be the one responsible for the attacks.

Now it's very quiet. People are scared to come to the beach. They are just coming to the bar to have a drink.

The following day, 5 December, a 71-year-old German woman, who had visited the resort for 11 years, was killed by a shark while swimming in Naama Bay near the Hyatt hotel. Jochen Van Lysebettens, of the Red Sea Diving College, saw the attack, and told Sky News: \\"Suddenly there was a scream of help and a lot of violence in the water. The lifeguard got her on the reef and he noticed she was severely wounded.\\" According to local officials, her arm was severed in the attack and she died within minutes. Following the attacks, watersports activities were again suspended, though it was expected that scuba diving—which is considered to be at far less risk from shark attacks—would soon be allowed to resume.

Associated Press, 9 December 2010\\"Shark attack kills German woman off Egypt \\". Agence France-Presse, 5 December 2010 Possible causes An oceanic whitetip shark, one of the two species implicated in the attacks Sharks are commonly seen near Sharm El Sheikh but attacks on humans are very rare, particularly by the two species implicated in the 2010 attacks. Only nine attacks by oceanic whitetips had been reported worldwide in the last 430 years and only one had been previously fatal. However, oceanographic researcher Jacques Cousteau described the oceanic whitetip as \\"the most dangerous of all sharks\\". Despite the greater notoriety of other sharks habitually found nearer the shore, the oceanic whitetip is believed to be responsible for many casualties as a result of predation on survivors of shipwrecks. Such incidents are not included in common shark-attack indices for the 20th and 21st centuries, and as a result of this, the oceanic whitetip does not have the highest number of recorded incidents; only 5 recorded attacks as of 2009. The chairman of the Shark Trust, a British charity dedicated to shark conservation, commented: “It is probable that the tragic attacks were triggered by a specific activity or event... Attacks on humans by sharks are extremely rare and this species would normally not be found close to shore on bathing beaches.” Mohammed Salam of the South Sinai Conservation organisation, a government body responsible for environmental protection in the area, said that \\"usually these kinds of sharks don't attack human beings but sometimes they have trouble with their nervous system and they accidentally go after people.\\" The chairman of the Sharm El Sheikh Chamber of Diving and Water Sports (CDWS) suggested that attacks might have been due to overfishing, which is an ongoing problem in the area. In a statement, Hesham Gabr said: \\"It is clear from our initial discussions with shark behavioural experts that this highly unusual spate of attacks by an oceanic whitetip shark was triggered by an activity, most probably illegal fishing or feeding in the area.\\"Sherwood, Harriet. \\"Sharm el-Sheikh tourist killed in new shark attack\\". The Guardian, 5 December 2010 Other hypotheses for the shark attacks include that cattle ships transporting sheep for slaughter during the Islamic festival of Eid al-Adha on 16 November dumped sheep carcasses into the Red Sea, bringing sharks unusually close to the shoreline. Unscrupulous diving companies were also blamed for feeding sharks to attract them for their clients.Scholl, Michael C. \\"Sharm el- Sheikh deaths: Don't blame the sharks\\". Channel 4 News, 9 December 2010 On 9 December 2010, an international team of experts announced that it had found that two species—makos and oceanic whitetips—had been involved in the attacks. It listed possible contributory factors as including \\"one or more incidents of illegal dumping of animal carcasses in nearby waters; depletion of natural prey in the area caused by overfishing; localised feeding of reef fish and/or sharks by swimmers, snorkellers and some divers; and unusually high water temperatures in Sharm El Sheikh.\\"\\"Diving continues as experts investigate \\". Divernet, 9 December 2010 Conspiracy theory about Israeli involvement The attacks also sparked conspiracy theories about possible Israeli involvement. Egyptian television broadcast claims from South Sinai governer Mohamed Abdul Fadil Shousha that Israeli divers captured a shark with a GPS unit planted on its back, allegedly by Mossad. Describing the theory as \\"sad\\", Professor Mahmoud Hanafy of the Suez Canal University pointed out that GPS devices are used by marine biologists to track sharks, not to remote-control them. Governor Mohamed Abdel Fadil Shousha himself ultimately said he thought the dumping of sheep carcasses during the Islamic festival of Eid al-Adha on 16 November was the most likely explanation.

The head of the clandestine Israel Military Industries, Yosef Avidar (later head of the Central Command), devised a plan to smuggle in machines for a secret factory to make the ammunition. Twelve machines needed for cartridge production (punching, drilling, cutting brass, etc.) were successfully purchased in Poland in 1938. Because of the international situation at the time, the Zionists could ship the machines only as far as Beirut (Lebanon), where they were stored for nearly four years in a Haganah warehouse. With the help of Jews serving in the British army, the machines were finally brought into Palestine by train. The site for the future plant – Kibbutz hill in Rehovot – was a place where pioneers would go for training in kibbutz life before moving on to establish cooperatives around the country. It had the advantages that (i) the British were familiar with kibbutz life activities at this place, that (ii) it was a hill, meaning it is difficult to see what's going on on top of it while one is standing at its foot (iii) the geography allowed for underground construction without disrupting the outside appearance of the hill, and (iv) a nearby train station provided reliably strong noise to cover construction and operation of the factory. The Haganah approached and later recruited an incoming youth group to consider taking on a treacherous top- secret mission, instead of starting to found their own kibbutz. The details of the mission were revealed to the 45 women and men only after the whole group had unanimously agreed to take responsibility, meaning also a life-threatening situation for themselves as well as for many more people: The group of 45 teenagers and young adults would be responsible for maintaining absolute secrecy, or else face potential death sentences at the hands of the British, who had a military base within walking distance of the training facility. The kibbutz was created on top of the clandestine plant only to disguise the plant from the British military. Not all of the members in the kibbutz were aware that there was a secret underground ammunition factory under their homes, and such people were referred to as \\"giraffes\\" by the factory workers. (By that time, animals for the newly created Tel Aviv zoo were transported from the then only port in Haifa by train, using the rails passing by Rehovot. The giraffes got a special wagon with a narrow hole in the roof due to their long necks. This allowed them to see their surroundings, but prevented them from seeing what was right under their feet.) The group working in the clandestine factory manufactured some 2.25 million cartridges between 1945 and 1948 – an average of 40,000 per day – right under the noses of the British troops. Factory operations and risks In the impressively short time of three weeks, the hill was dug out and a large underground chamber of 300 square yards (the size of a tennis court) 13 feet (8m) underground with nearly 2-foot-thick (0,5m) concrete walls and ceiling was built. Above, the sort of buildings used in an ordinary kibbutz - dining room, community hall, children's house etc. were erected. Additionally, a laundry and a bakery were constructed. Here, the very detailed plan regarding the factory can be observed at its best: It had to anticipate every possible threat to the endeavour of establishing a secret ammunition plant. Everything had to be foreseen. An entrance was needed for workers to enter the factory, as well as an opening to lower into it the necessary heavy machines. The question of ventilation was vital, as were plausible cover stories for the workers. These solutions were found: The big hole used to lower the machines was covered by the 10-ton oven of the bakery, while rails to move it were even embedded in concrete to avoid any ray of light. The chimney of the bakery became part of the ventilation system. Its counterpart – one to get fresh air in, the other one to bring the gases and exhaust air out – was hidden in the technical system of the laundry. Its automated industrial washing machine was movable as well and hid the secret entrance to the underground factory. The washing machine which covered the noise and smell of the factory was in use constantly, and the kibbutz members' clothes were washed so often that they became ragged. To solve this problem the kibbutz opened a laundry service. Surrounding kibbutzim sent their linens to be washed for a small fee. Even the British brought their uniforms to be taken care of. To distance the British personnel, the kibbutz extended its laundry service by a delivery service. Another severe problem, to get all of the brass necessary for the bullets, was solved as well in a smart move: The kibbutz members told the British that they operated a little beauty business producing cases for kosher lipsticks. The British accepted the stated purpose of the side business – which was reinforced by gifts from the Jews of lipstick cases to British officials – and let the kibbutz operate. Downstairs, forty-five women and men worked in the bullet factory for three years. They worked in two shifts to punch brass, bend and lumber it, cut it to size, fill it with gunpowder and finalise each cartridge by installing a primer (produced elsewhere). Following a strict procedure and control panel for each step of production, the workers strove to avoid injury or worse. Amazingly, at a place were more than 2 million cartridges were filled by hand with gunpowder, the most severe injury was a cut-off fingertip. Since the gunpowder smuggled into the factory was sometimes of poor quality, the workers even had a testing facility underground. To make sure the ammunition was safe and effective, they randomly sampled bullets and shot them in the underground testing room at targets to check for accuracy and precision. Each day, at the precise moment when the train passed by, they were able to use the noise of its passage to disguise their test firing. Every day the factory workers would go underground very early, and in a span of less than three minutes to avoid detection. Though the air was exchanged six times per hour, there was no air conditioning, and particularly on hot days work conditions were hard. (At temperatures above 40 °C the danger of spontaneous ignition of the gunpowder stopped the production.) Lack of sunlight paled the skin of the workers, putting their cover stories (of working in the fields) at stake and increasing their risk of illness due to lack of vitamin D. According to the recommendation of a medical doctor, additional food was organised for the workers, and a UV lamp was installed underground to tan their skin to avoid suspicion. Every day when leaving the factory the workers had to make sure they carried no trace of their work, such as brass shavings or gunpowder. Everyone went through a thorough inspection of their clothes, hair and shoes before being allowed to exit the factory. To pretend they taking part in ordinary kibbutz life, the workers daily attended lunch with the other kibbutz inhabitants in the dining hall: Each noon they left the factory secretly for lunch, individually or in small groups, to mimic arrival from the surrounding fields. During the first year of its existence, boxes of completed ammunition were smuggled outside the kibbutz in the false bottom of milk cans, milk being an unsuspicious commodity for a kibbutz. The risk of discovery, and the limited volume this allowed the factory to move, led to a search for a new means of delivery. It was also necessary to allow the distribution of the ammunition to all places in Palestine which were in preparation for defence. A new means of smuggling material both into and out of the factory was instituted: From time to time and nightly, fuel was delivered to the kibbutz by lorry. The lorry driver was known only to the person on guard in the kibbutz. The driver would enter the kibbutz, knock a secret code at the door of the bakery, climb down to the factory, deliver new material and pick up the filled boxes. Since the workers never met the driver, the person was referred to as \\"an elf\\", providing the materials needed without being seen. For the Haganah, it was of outmost importance that all secret groups never know each other. In the worst case – in case of capture – they could never betray any group other than their own. The bullets were distributed via the network of Haganah-organised groups. Thus, by providing the munition for the Palmach fighters it played a role in the Establishment of Israel. Today With independence achieved, Israel no longer had to conceal the factory's operations. Cartridge production was therefore moved above ground, as part of the centralized military industries. The pioneer group of the 45 youngsters decided to stay together and fulfill their original dream to establish a new kibbutz. They did so further north, founding the kibbutz Ma'agan Micha'el by the sea near Zichron Ya'acov in 1949. But the secret which was so well kept of underground production became known to the public only in 1973. Today, Ayalon Institute is a museum. In 1987, the site was restored to preserve and display the kibbutz and the underground factory to the public. It is one of the Israelian Heritage Sites. Playing an important role in this, the Jewish National Fund supports ongoing rehabilitation and preservation of the site.created in partnership with Jewish National Fund For the time being, the venue offers a eucalyptus grove with picnic tables and lodging tents as well as guided tours throughout the remaining buildings and the factory itself. Laurel Fairworth, a United States TV producer, decided in 2015 to create a documentary about the unique place. A shortened version of the docudrama is shown at the museum as an introduction to the guided tours. The guided tour shows the laundry room and the secret entrance under the washing machine. The tour enters the factory through an alternate entrance – installed for today's visitors – located in the bakery, going down a spiral ladder 25 feet into the ground. The machines are located in the main room, and still function today thanks to a team of engineers from the Society for the Preservation of Israel Heritage Sites. The electricity necessary to run their transmission belts back in the 40s was secretly branched off the train operating site, as testified by a little \\"thank you for it\\" sign attached to the wall next to the machines in the museum. The tour also shows the UV-radiation room, the toilets (their content was pumped to the kibbutz's sewage system) as well as the ammunition packing station. It ends with a walk back through the kibbutz facilities, which are relatively well preserved thanks to the military use of the area after independence.

Description The peninsula cooter is an average sized member of the family Emydidae, typically reaching carapace lengths of 9-13 in (23-33 cm) and weights of 5-15 lbs (2.27-6.8 kg). However, they are capable of surpassing 20.0 in (50.8 cm) and 35 pounds (15.876 kg). Peninsula cooters can be identified be distinguished from the Florida red-bellied cooter (Pseudemys nelsoni) by their lack of a reddish plastron and the presence of dozens of yellow stripes on their carapace, limbs, head, and tail. Males can be distinguished from females by not only their smaller size, but their greatly elongated front claws. These claws are used to stimulate the female prior to mating. Distribution The species is widespread in peninsular Florida. It can be found in rivers, ponds, and lakes.
