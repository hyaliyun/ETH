History Plans for a locomotive with Voith hydraulic transmission (the first of its kind in Poland) were drawn up between the years of 1959 and 1960, alongside the design for the SN80 DMU -- though the latter did not make use of the Voith system. The new locomotives were intended to replace the obsolete SM30 series -- however, the SM30 was still being built long after production of the SM25 had ceased. Manufacture of the SM25 began in 1961 and came to an end in 1963. During these years only three units rolled off the Fablok production line in Chrzan√≥w, due to the severe difficulty in importing the hydraulic transmission units from Voith. The three that were built were sent to the depot in Krak√≥w where they remained in service until the late-1970s when they were sold to industry. One example -- SM25-002 (serial number 5427), built in 1962 -- has been preserved as an exhibit at the Warsaw Railway Museum. Technical data The SM25 is a C locomotive. This means that there are three powered axles under the unit. They are not articulated relative to other parts of the locomotive and are driven via hydraulic transmission. The locomotive is powered by a four-stroke diesel engine. The SM25 had several improvements over previous classes in the SM series. The most notable being the revised positioning of the cab -- which had been soundproofed -- and platforms, with the intent of providing optimal conditions for shunting.

E. Turner (1836) of a Priestley portrait commissioned by Joseph Johnson from Henry Fuseli (c. 1783). The Theological Repository was a periodical founded and edited from 1769 to 1771 by the eighteenth-century British polymath Joseph Priestley. Although ostensibly committed to the open and rational inquiry of theological questions, the journal became a mouthpiece for Dissenting, particularly Unitarian and Arian, doctrines. Priestley promised to print all viewpoints, but only like-minded authors ever submitted articles. He was therefore forced to provide much of the journal's content himself. After only a few years, due to a lack of funds, he was forced to cease publishing the journal.See Schofield, Vol. 1, 193‚Äì201 for an analysis of the journal; Uglow, 169; Holt, 53‚Äì55. About a decade later, in 1784, Priestley revived the Theological Repository, but he again became responsible for much of the journal's content and again the journal became insolvent after several issues (1784, 1786, 1788).See Schofield, Vol. 2, 202‚Äì207 for an analysis of Priestley's contributions. Joseph Johnson, Priestley's close friend and publisher, was responsible for issuing the journal. Dedicated to the Unitarian cause, he bore much of the financial burden of the enterprise.Braithwaite, 12‚Äì13; 18‚Äì19.

The earliest colonists of Massachusetts Bay Colony used it, and rendered it wider by driving cattle along it. The old route is still followed, for part of its length, by Massachusetts Route 9 and Massachusetts Route 126. In lean years of the early 1630s, when the Massachusetts Bay Colony ran short of grain, Nipmuck farmers in the valley of the Connecticut River loaded some of their abundant surplus maize into birch-bark backpacks and trod a familiar route to the settlements at the mouth of the Charles River, where they traded food for European goods made of copper and iron and woollen cloth.Ron McAdow, \\"The Old Connecticut Path\\" Fur traders and the exploratory party of John Oldham (1633) penetrated this first of the trails west into the continent's interior. In 1635, some settlers from Watertown took this route when they removed to Wethersfield, Connecticut. In 1636, the outcast Thomas Hooker and a hundred of his congregation, with 160 cattle, whose milk they drank en route, followed the Old Connecticut Path in a two-weeks' journey to the Connecticut River. There they settled in a place the native Lenape people called Suckiaug, because of the blackness of its earth. They founded the English settlement of Hartford. By 1643, documents in the village of Sudbury called this trail the \\"Old Connecticut Path.\\" In 1672, with the establishment of a postal system, it became the first colonial post road. Long native usage had emphasized the easiest route,By collating early maps, documents and town histories with on- the-ground exploration, Harral Ayres established the route of the Old Connecticut Path and its byways, in The Great Trail of New England (Boston: Meador) 1940 skirting the water meadows of the river bottoms and crossing streams at the most dependable fords. The Path led west along the north bank of the Charles River from New Town (Cambridge) to newly settled Watertown and passed through what are now Waltham and Weston, curving southward where it entered the southeasterly section of the new town of Sudbury, now set apart as Wayland, where a section of the routeRoute 126. still bears the name \\"Old Connecticut Path\\". At Wayland, the Bay Path, later the Boston Post Road,Route 20 in Wayland retains its name as \\"Boston Post Road\\". diverged from the Connecticut Path, headed west through Marlborough, Worcester and Brookfield straight toward the Connecticut River.The route of the Bay Path has been confused with the Old Connecticut Path, as by Archer Butler Hulbert, Indian Thoroughfares 1902:74, who mistakenly traces it through Marlborough to Albany, New York. In Sudbury the Connecticut Path was known as \\"the road from Watertown to the Dunster Farm\\", for after passing along the north side of Cochituate Pond, it crossed the tract beyond that was granted to Henry Dunster, president of Harvard College, and the lands of Edmund Rice and Philemon Whale.Alfred Sereno Hudson, The History of Sudbury, Massachusetts. 1638-1889 1889:5f.

Originally established in the city of ƒ∞zmit in 1927 as a privately-owned joint-stock company with the name Kocaeli Halk Bankasƒ± TA≈û, in 2005 TEB entered into a strategic partnership with BNP Paribas, a leading euro area banking group. Taking a customer-focused approach to banking, TEB continues to expand its active customer base through the provision of digital products and services. Seeking to reach its customers through many different channels, TEB strives to provide them with quick, convenient, and secure access through digital channels as well. TEB was one of the first banks in Turkey to invest in mobile banking. The bank‚Äôs investments in this business line were centered around its CEPTETEB platform, a mobile application that introduced many innovations not just in the Turkish banking industry but throughout the world when it was released in 2008. Given a makeover in 2015, CEPTETEB became the primary mobile banking channel for TEB‚Äôs retail customers. In early 2020, TEB introduced CEPTETEB ƒ∞≈ûTE (‚ÄúCEPTETEB For Business‚Äù) , a version of the app specifically designed for its SME, corporate, and microbusiness banking customers. The rapidly-won success of CEPTETEB ƒ∞≈ûTE earned the app an award in the ‚ÄúMobile‚Äù category of the ‚ÄúInnovation in Digital Banking Awards‚Äù series organized by The Banker', an international financial affairs monthly owned by The Financial Times.

In keeping with TEB‚Äôs ‚Äúconsultant bank‚Äú approach, TEB Private Banking proactively seeks to acquaint its clients with a variety of investment alternatives that go beyond traditional products and services. Having first entered the SME banking business line in 2005, in 2019 TEB overhauled its SME banking business model in order to better address the changing and increasingly more diversified requirements of SME customers through market segmentation focusing on such customers‚Äô particular needs. Firms requiring specialized services for example are provided with bespoke services ranging from foreign trade to project finance and from derivatives trading to supplier financing. The bank‚Äôs digital service model was also revised both to make it easier for smaller businesses to take care of their day-to-day banking needs and to automate credit- allocation processes. Having entered the SME banking business line with the intention of acting as such customers‚Äô financial adviser, TEB‚Äôs success has been recognized by the International Finance Corporation, a member of the World Bank Group, which cited TEB as one of the world‚Äôs three best banks active in SME banking. TEB ranks among the top world banks for its SME banking activities Another business line in which TEB is active is startup business banking, which it entered in order to contribute to the growth and development of Turkey‚Äôs entrepreneurial ecosystem. TEB Startup Business Banking proactively seeks out startup companies (especially techs) throughout the country in order to help them transform their innovative business ideas into economic value. In the particular case of fintechs, which play a crucial role in the digital transformation of the financial services industry, TEB regards them as medium and long-term business partners and engages with them as one of the actors shaping the industry‚Äôs future.

L. Mencken. The two men were very close in age, and their career paths have sometimes been compared, but Mencken outlived Sherman by three decades. Background, education, and academic career Sherman, who was distantly related to William Tecumseh Sherman, was born to New Englanders John and Ada Martha (Pratt) Sherman on October 1, 1881, in Anita, Iowa. The family later relocated to Rolfe, Iowa, and finally, in 1887, to Los Angeles, California. His father, a druggist and lover of music and poetry, had moved to California in search of a more healthful climate, but he died when Sherman was just 11. The family subsequently returned to New England. Sherman entered Williams College in 1900, and he won prizes there in Latin, French and German, as well as becoming editor of the ‚ÄúWilliams Literary Monthly.‚Äù He graduated with a Ph.D. in 1906 after writing his thesis on the 17th-century dramatist John Ford. Upon graduation, Sherman became an instructor at Northwestern University for one year before moving to the University of Illinois (UIUC). In 1908 he was offered a position of the staff of The Nation, to which he was a frequent contributor, but declined when UIUC made him an associate professor. He became a full professor in 1911 and permanent chairman of the UIUC English Department in 1914 where he built the department into one of the strongest in the Midwest. He was a natural teacher, noted for his sound scholarship, especially on the works of Matthew Arnold, and for his passion for the living values of literature. In April 1924, Sherman became editor of ‚ÄúBooks,‚Äù the literary supplement to the New York Herald Tribune, which became under his editorship the leading American critical journal of the day. Sherman was initially an advocate of the \\"Nativist\\" movement in American literature. The \\"Nativist\\" movement defended traditional modes of American literature (which it identified with Anglo-Americans) against Modernism, (which it identified with immigrants). Sherman's supporters in the \\"Nativist\\" controversy included Brander Matthews, Gertrude Atherton and John Farrar.Higham, John, Strangers In The Land: Patterns of American Nativism, 1860-1925. New Brunswick, NJ; Rutgers University Press 2011, (pp. 276-277) Sherman was initially critical of the work of Theodore Dreiser, and argued Dresier's German-American background hindered Dreiser's ability to express \\"spiritual values\\".Newlin, Keith, A Theodore Dreiser Encyclopedia. Westport, Conn. : Greenwood Press, 2003. (p. 333) Controversy With the entry of the United States into the Great War, Sherman expressed what some deemed a chauvinistic patriotism in an address before the National Council of Teachers of English on 1 December 1917, denouncing both the philosophy of Nietzsche and his American apologist, Henry Louis Mencken. This began a decade long, erudite, and witty feud between these literary titans. The next salvo from Sherman was an article in the October 1920 issue of Bookman, ‚ÄúIs There Anything to be Said for Literary Traditions?‚Äù where he attacked literary modernism. Interpreting the challenge to conventional morals by younger literary figures as moral relativism, Sherman defended traditional values, nationalism, and even Puritanism, a popular scapegoat of the time. As the decade of the 1920s unfolded, however, many argue that Sherman moved perceptibly to the left, eventually embracing modernism and confessing that he had erred in trying to make men good instead of happy. Sherman also changed his mind about the merits of Dreiser's work, and praised An American Tragedy for what Sherman regarded as its \\"masterly exhaustiveness\\" of character development. Personal life In 1906, Sherman married Ruth Bartlet Mears, daughter of a chemistry professor at Williams, and the couple had a son. Sherman was on vacation with his wife on Lake Michigan when he suffered a fatal heart attack after an accident overturned his canoe. He died on August 21, 1926, at age 44. He is buried in Manchester, Vermont. Published works *Introduction to an edition of John Ford (dramatist)‚Äôs ‚Äú'Tis Pity She's a Whore‚Äù / ‚ÄúThe Broken Heart.‚Äù Boston, London, D.C.

While returning from a goodwill voyage to Japan in 1890, she encountered a typhoon off the coast of Wakayama Prefecture, subsequently drifted into a reef and sank. The shipwreck resulted in the loss of more than 500 sailors and officers, including Rear Admiral Ali Osman Pasha. Only 69 sailors and officers survived and returned home later aboard two Japanese corvettes. The event is still commemorated as a foundation stone of Japanese-Turkish friendship. Ship Ertuƒürul Ertuƒürul, ordered in 1854 by Ottoman Sultan Abd√ºl√¢ziz (reigned 1861‚Äì1876), was built in the Ta≈ükƒ±zak Shipyard (Ters√¢ne-i √Çmire) in Galata, an area of Istanbul (previously known as Constantinople) and was launched on 19 October 1863 in presence of the Sultan. She was named for Ertuƒürul Gazi (1198‚Äì1281), the father of Osman I, founder of the Ottoman Empire. A three-mast wooden ship, she was long, wide and had a draft of . The frigate sailed to England in 1864, where she had steam engines and state of the art machinery installed, including electrical lighting. On 18 February 1865, she left Portsmouth to return home with two other ships of the Ottoman Navy, Kosova and H√ºdavendig√¢r, visiting some French and Spanish ports on the way. After arriving in Istanbul, she anchored awhile in the Bosphorus in front of the Dolmabah√ße Palace and later took part in the campaign against the Cretan Revolt in 1866. Subsequently, she was locked up in Golden Horn during the reign of Abdul Hamid II (1876‚Äì1909).  Japanese-Ottoman relations  In November 1878, the sloop Seiki (Ê∏ÖËºù) of the Japanese Imperial Navy arrived in Istanbul en route to a training mission in Europe, and the envoy was received by Sultan Abdul Hamid II and honored with various medals. In 1881, a mission led by diplomat (ÂêâÁî∞ Ê≠£Êò• Yoshida Masaharu) came to the court Yƒ±ldƒ±z Palace in an effort to conclude agreements relating to trade and wartime status. Upon the visit of Prince Komatsu Akihito to Istanbul in October 1887 and the presentation of Japan's highest order, the Order of the Chrysanthemum, to the Sultan, the government of the Ottoman Empire decided to send a ship on a goodwill voyage to Japan in return.\\"The Martyrs of Turkish Fleet at the Shore of Ooshima\\" (slides 5-6 of \\"A Brief Introduction to International Yachting Fellowship of Rotarians\\").

Appointment Head of the navy, Bozcaadalƒ± Hasan H√ºsn√º Pasha The crew of Frigate Ertuƒürul, Middle: Rear Admiral Ali Osman Pasha The Grand Vizier K√¢mil Pasha sent a note on 14 February 1889 to the head of the navy, Bozcaadalƒ± Hasan H√ºsn√º Pasha, asking the name and possible departure date of a battleship, which was suitable to sail to the seas of Indo-China and Japan in order to put the theoretical knowledge of the Naval Academy graduates into practice. On 25 February 1889, Hasan H√ºsn√º Pasha informed the Grand Vizier that the frigate Ertuƒürul was suitable for the assignment and could accomplish the preparations required within one week and set sail within one month. The real reason of the journey and its importance was revealed then by the Grand Vizier as a goodwill visit to Japan for the presentation of gifts and the highest decoration of the Ottoman Empire, \\"Medal of High Honor\\", from the Sultan to the Japanese Emperor. Another aim of the voyage was to show the flag on the Indian Ocean. On 6 April 1889, the naval ministry appointed as commanding officer Captain Ali Osman Bey, the most appropriate officer due to his knowledge of several foreign languages and his skills in seamanship. Voyage to Japan Rear Admiral Ali Osman Pasha The ship, in service for 25 years, was overhauled shortly before the voyage, and most of the hull's wooden parts were renewed. Ertuƒürul, with 607 (disputed figure) sailors ‚Äî including 57 officers ‚Äî on board, was instructed to set sail from Istanbul on 14 July 1889, with Captain Ali Osman Bey commanding. The initial route was designed to make various necessary stops on the way. The first stop was planned in Marmaris, and the next one in Port Said before the passage through the Suez Canal. Visits in Aden and Somalia would follow the stay in Jeddah. Considering the seasonal winds, the ship would stop by at Pondicherry and Calcutta in India. After staying in Port Akabod and Singapore, she would carry on to Malacca by way of the Strait of Malacca. Proceeding to the north, the ship would stop by in Saigon and then in some docks in China to arrive in Hong Kong. Amoy and Shanghai would be the last stops before reaching Japan. Finally, after a stay in Nagasaki, the ship would arrive her destination in Yokohama. The return was scheduled in October of the same year. The ship experienced some problems during her long journey. On 26 July 1889, she entered the Suez Canal and ran ashore in Great Bitter Lake, destroyed the stern post and lost the rudder. After repairs, Ertuƒürul set sail again on 23 September. While sailing in western Indian Ocean, the ship took on water from the bow. The crew was unable to conduct the necessary repairs until they reached Singapore. Ertuƒürul was repaired in Singapore and departed on 22 March 1890. After a ten-day stop in Saigon, she arrived in Yokohama on 7 June 1890. The journey from Istanbul lasted around eleven months. Captain Ali Osman Bey was promoted to the rank of (Commodore/Rear Admiral) during the journey. In Yokohama, Rear Admiral Ali Osman Pasha and the officers were received by Emperor Meiji of Japan on 13 June 1890. The gifts and the medal sent by Sultan Abdul Hamid II were presented to their intended recipients. Ali Osman Pasha was honored with the First Class Order of the Rising Sun, and Skipper Ali Bey with the Third Class Order of the Rising Sun. Other navy officers were also decorated with medals. Subsequently, Ottoman officers were received by the Empress. On 14 June 1890, young Prince Yoshihito Haru received the Ottoman rear admiral. On the following days, many receptions, dinners and ceremonies took place. During her stay of three months in Japan, Ertuƒürul frigate lost twelve crew members to epidemic. Shipwreck Collision site off Kii Oshima. At noon on 15 September 1890, Ertuƒürul set sail from Yokohama for Istanbul. At the time of departure, the weather conditions were good, but the next morning a reverse wind began to blow, getting stronger towards evening. By nightfall, the wind came from below the bow so that the sails had to be folded. At the same time, violent waves began beating against the ship, which, under severe trial, could hardly make headway. The high mizzen mast collapsed and caused severe damage by shaking from side to side and banging into the other (rigging) sails. While the storm continued gaining power, waves coming from the bow separated the deck boards from the front. Water broke through into the coal depots in the boiler room. Over the next four days, the crew tried to repair the damage by remedying the sails and tightening the shrouds. They also continuously tried to empty the water out of the coal containers (which were the ones most seriously in danger) using buckets, since the pumps were insufficient. Despite all their efforts, the ship's disintegration was imminent and the only option was to seek sanctuary in a nearby port. They headed to Kobe, within of the ship, in the gulf beyond the Kashinozaki Cape with Oshima Lighthouse. Seawater breaking through finally extinguished one of the furnaces in the engine room. Almost immobile without main sails and sufficient propulsion, and having only the wind and the waves behind, Ertuƒürul drifted towards the dangerous rocks at the eastern coast of Kii ≈åshima. As the crew tried just to stop the ship before the rocks by emergency anchoring, the ship hit the reefs and fell apart at the first impact around midnight on 18 September 1890. Kong≈ç in Constantinople, 1891, by Luigi Acquarone (1800-1896). At the site of the incident, more than 500 sailors, of whom fifty were officers including the commander Rear Admiral Ali Osman Pasha, lost their lives. Only six officers and sixty-three sailors survived. Six of the survivors were uninjured, nine severely wounded and the others sustained light injuries. After the rescue operation, two survivors were taken to Kobe by Japanese ships, two more by a Japanese battleship and sixty-five by German gunboats. All of the sixty-nine survivors were transported back to Istanbul aboard the Japanese corvettes and , leaving Shinagawa, Tokyo, in October 1890. The Sultan met with the officers of the Japanese ships on 5 January 1891 and expressed his appreciation for the relief operation by decorating them with medals. Commemoration Frigate Ertuƒürul Memorial in Kushimoto, Japan. A scale model of Ertuƒürul on display at the Mersin Naval Museum This accident created a general sympathy in Japan for Turkish people and led to the establishment of a strong basis for which friendship between Turkey and Japan was to later flourish. In February 1891, a cemetery was established for the 150 bodies recovered from the sea, and a memorial next to it was built near the lighthouse in the town of Kushimoto, Wakayama. On 3 June 1929, Emperor Hirohito visited the cemetery, which was extended the same year. Turkey renovated the monument in 1939. In 1974, a \\"Turkish Museum\\" was established, in which a scale model of the ship, photographs and statues of the sailors are on exhibition. The event is commemorated every five years on the day of the accident in Kushimoto, with the participation of high-level officials from Turkey and Japan. In June 2008, Turkish president Abdullah G√ºl, visiting Japan officially, proceeded from Tokyo to Kushimoto to take part at a commemoration together with regional officials. A drama film about the event, 125 Years Memory, was released in 2015. Salvaging the wreckage On 4 January 2007, an underwater archaeological project started the excavation of the wreck as a collaboration of the Institute of Nautical Archaeology (INA) in Bodrum, Yapƒ± Kredi Retirement Partnership and the Turkish Foundation of Nautical Archaeology. It is intended to exhibit the remains of the ship in the museum next to the Ertuƒürul Monument in Kashino, Kushimoto. American and Japanese nautical archaeologists and historians joined the excavation team. On 28 January 2008, the team of archaeologists, under the leadership of Tufan Turanlƒ± (director of INA-Bodrum at the time), reached the ammunition store section of the wreck in a dive during the second phase of the underwater excavation project. Three cannonballs, each , of the ship's Krupp naval guns, tens of bullets and pieces of naval mines were recovered and safely brought to the Port of Kushimoto, where explosive experts of local police, the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force and Navy examined them. The artifacts were later taken to Ertuƒürul Research Institute for conservation. Turanlƒ± recalled that two Winchester rifles recovered earlier are on exhibition in the museum.

At a time when Oriental disciplines like Confucian philosophy, Chinese literature and classical Japanese were the mainstream subjects for study, he extended his attention to Occidental philosophy as well, including the Christian bible. Because of the Kuroda family's continuous enthusiasm in adopting scholarly insights under their rule, Kuroda-han flourished in a variety of academic fields, producing scholars from Confucian philosophy and classical Japanese, to Chinese herbology, agriculture, and medicine. When Kuroda Naritaka (younger brother of Tokugawa Ienari, the eleventh sh≈çgun of the Tokugawa shogunate) became the 9th lord of Kuroda-han at a young age in 1783, the advisory board summoned two renowned scholars of the domain, Takeda Sadayoshi and Kamei Nanmei, to each build a school in order to pass on their forbearers‚Äô scholastic ambition to the future generation.  Han-school years  In 1784, Takeda and Kamei each founded their han-schools and named it Shuyukan and Kantokan respectively. Due to the two schools‚Äô location, Shuyukan was also called the Eastern-academy (Higashi Gakumon Keikojo), and Kantokan the Western-academy (Nishi Gakumon Keikojo). Kantokan was burnt down during a fire in 1798, and Shuyukan subsequently became the only han-school remaining. The 11th lord Nagahiro Kuroda was especially concerned with the education of his people throughout his life, and was particularly attentive to new cultures arriving from the Occident. With such pedagogical emphasis and interest in the West, he sent off many gifted samurais from Shuyukan to study at cosmopolitan cities in Japan and abroad, among whom was Kentaro Kaneko, a young han-samurai at the time, who continued his studies at Harvard University and later became one of the drafters of Meiji Constitution. With the waves of social change during the Meiji Restoration period, however, educational reform was underway. Because han-schools were limited to elite students from privileged samurai families, they were to be abolished for a more democratic school system open for all. Shuyukan was closed down in 1871, and thus was the end of its years as a han- school.  Reopening, the war to present  In 1885, Lord Nagahiro Kuroda and Kentaro Kaneko appealed to Fukuoka prefecture for the reopening of Shuyukan as a prefectural school. On May 30, Fukuoka prefecture ordered the establishment of Fukuoka Prefectural Shuyukan as an English vocational school to produce English specialists. All classes were taught in English, and students studied Anglophone literature, Euro-American history, and Science using English-American textbooks.Abe, Noriko. Shuyukan no eigo kyoiku : Meijihen.

The same year, another graduate Tetsuo Hamuro won the gold medal in 200 meter breaststroke at the Berlin Olympics. Two years later, youths from Hitler- Jugend visited the Shuyukan campus and interacted with students. As the war deepened, only the freshmen were attending classes in 1944, as upperclassmen had been recruited for military services. The school was severely damaged with the Fukuoka Air Raids in the following year, and soon after, the war ended on August 15, 1945. Classes resumed in September under serious shortage of essentials and textbooks; the biology club and Rugby team resumed their activities in October. During this post-war period, school reform was executed in order to fully democratize the Japanese educational system. In 1949, Shuyukan was renamed Fukuoka Prefectural Shuyukan Senior High School. Under the occupation of GHQ who strongly discouraged any form of tradition that hinted the legacy of Japan's feudal and militant past, even to keep the name \\"Shuyukan\\" was impossible without the extraordinary efforts of its alumni. This year the school admitted its first batch of female students in the incoming freshmen, and Shuyukan thus became a public co-educational high school that it is today.  School life   Academics  Currently there are no vocational courses; education is limited to regular college preparatory courses. In the second year, students choose between Liberal Arts and Science tracks. In addition, there are Advanced Liberal Arts, Advanced Science, and Pre-Medicine classes for advanced students.

Simpson, nicknamed \\"Mickey,\\" arrived in Los Angeles in the late 1930s. Some unconfirmed stories have him working as a chauffeur for Claudette Colbert. In 1939, he reportedly played a tiny bit part in his first film, Stagecoach. The director, John Ford, would loom large in Simpson's career. Simpson found fairly steady movie work as various guards, cops, bouncers, and thugs until his career was interrupted by World War II, in which he served in the United States Navy as a Shore Patrolman, keeping drunken sailors and townies from killing each other, while patrolling the many L.A. bars and strip clubs. When he returned to Hollywood, it was Ford who resurrected his career, giving Simpson a small but notable role as one of Walter Brennan's sons in My Darling Clementine. Simpson would appear in a total of nine Ford films. He appeared in 13 episodes of the TV Series The Lone Ranger between 1950 and 1956, including episode 117 in 1953 and episode 141 in 1954. During the late 1950s he portrayed the role of Boley on the television series Captain David Grief. In 1957 Simpson appeared as Johnny Hines on the TV western Cheyenne in the episode titled \\"Decision at Gunsight.\\" Modern viewers may remember Simpson as Rocky Duggan in the Three Stooges film Gents in a Jam. Simpson played a memorable wrestler dubbed \\"the strongest man in the world.\\" He even offered to tear a telephone book in half for the Stooges, who were hiding his unclothed wife (Dani Sue Nolan).

It is 29 kilometres north west of Deepwater and south west of Tenterfield and 61 kilometres from Glen Innes (South-East). It is situated on a plateau known as the Mole Tableland in close proximity to the Queensland border on the Northern Tablelands. A feature of Torrington is its abundance of boulders and rocky outcrops. The most notable boulder outcrop located in the village being \\"Goat Rock\\" and just out of town is \\"Old Mystery Face\\" History Torrington was named after its English counterpart in Devon. The discovery of the extremely rich Torrington tin lode in 1881 created much excitement but in a very short time the small prospectors had lost control to overseas mining companies, the precursors of today's multi-nationals. In the 1920s, 500 men were employed at the mines. There were sixteen batteries working, and the community enjoyed the convenience of five general stores, butcher shop, cafes, bakery, billiard rooms, police station, post office, churches, hotel and many sporting facilities in Torrington and the two now defunct satellite villages of Tungsten and Bismuth which were both approximately 7 kilometres north and west of Torrington respectively. Today, there is scarcely any indication that either of the satellite villages ever existed. The Mole Post Office opened on 1 August 1882 and was renamed Torington in 1883 and Torrington in 1970. Bismuth Post Office was open between 1912 and 1931. Torrington Public School Headmaster in 1934 was Mr. A. J. McMullen. At his farewell dinner, the people of the town spoke of his sporting leadership in leading the school hockey team, and his musical talent. He had transferred to The Entrance in 1934. The first rural land release for grazing occurred in 1931 when a block of north of Torrington was granted by the New South Wales Department of Lands. This was followed by the general granting of further lands both north, south and west of Torrington over the next 50 years, for grazing purposes, but primarily most of the Torrington district remains in its natural state. When the government ended its tin subsidy after World War II the mining industry virtually shut down. Torrington also had a saw mill which used stringybark trees taken from the surrounding heavily timbered pendant but this mill closed in the 1960s. There is still a small timber mill operating not far from Torrington on the Deepwater Road which produces hardwood timber to order. There is still intermittent commercial mining dependent upon the current prices for tin. The area has large deposits of massive topaz (silexite) which is of interest to the mining industry and to fossickers. In 1981 Torrington celebrated its centenary, and was officially classified as a village. There was a hotel in Torrington, but it shut down in January 1999 when the licence was to be transferred to Sydney for the Olympic games, but with objections to the Liquor Board the Hotel was re-opened in December 2000 with a restaurant licence and the original licence was allowed to be transferred to Sydney. However, there was difficulty with the holding company of the freehold and the pub was permanently closed in October 2003. A Cornish Buddle and Five-Head Stamper which are relics of the old mining days can be seen at the caravan park.Readers Digest Guide to Australian Places, Readers Digest, Sydney The population of Torrington is approximately 85 people. Droughts The average rainfall over the ten years to 2000 was . After the short sharp drought of 1982‚Äì83, in the twenty-two-year period 1983 to 2005 there were many short droughts. For instance in October 1991 all northern New South Wales and southern Queensland were in extreme drought conditions. Again in 1994 a bad drought continued until January 1996, but worse was to come. In 2002 Torrington received and again in 2005 it had for the year. This drought broke in 2006. Fossicking and tourism Mining has given way to fossicking and tourism and now visitors enjoy the spectacular scenery of rocky granite outcrops, steep gorges, gently flowing streams as well as fossicking for topaz, quartz and the many minerals found in the area. Unfortunately the last general store and the caravan park were closed some years ago. Torrington State Recreation Area has more than 30,000 ha of wildlife featuring the famous Old Mystery Face, Captain Thunderbolt's Lookout and many other spectacular rock formations, streams and waterfalls. The Reserve is recognized as being of State significance for conservation, mining, honey production, recreation and cultural heritage.

Many schools use these games as a fun way to teach their students about the states, provinces, territories, and cities. The game is published by Ingenuity Works, a Vancouver-based company originally known as Didatech Software. In most of the games, the player will drive an 18-wheeler to pick up and deliver commodities to the cities assigned, while making decisions about the best route, when to eat, sleep, fill up gas, etc. Crosscountry USA (1985) This was the first game in the series, released in 1985 by Didatech Software (later renamed to Ingenuity Works). Educational Software Reviews deemed it \\"the type of game you can play for a full hour without getting tired.\\"http://www.his.com/~pshapiro/xc.usa.html Developed for the PC, the purpose of the game is to pick up commodities from one city and deliver them to another by driving across the country. Players interacted with the game through a command line using commands such as \\"turn on truck\\". Crosscountry Canada (1986) This was the second game in the series, released in 1986 for the Apple II by Didatech Software, and later ported to DOS in 1991. Home of the Underdogs deemed it \\"One of the best edutainment titles ever made\\".http://homeoftheunderdogs.net/game.php?id=4036 This title has since been made available on several websites, free-to-play. Crosscountry California (1987) As titled, players of this game are restricted to the boundaries of California. The gameplay was similar to Crosscountry USA.  Crosscountry Texas (1987)  The game was the first geography simulation to be designed specifically for Texas schools. The game contained simulated travel from city to city throughout Texas.https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED313011.pdf The game sees players travel to 135 cities and collect up to 55 commodities; the game requires 128K to run, and the school version includes a back-up disk and a teacher 's manual. This version was created without the state's involvement, similar to California, and in contrast to North Dakota. According to Paul Melhus, president of Didatech, the simulation of Texas was designed to be as realistic as possible. The game was not used in Del Rio, as school officials noted the limited use of computers within education. The title was released onto DOS and the Apple II. The paper Technology: Window to the Future. Proceedings of the Annual State Conference of the Texas Computer Education Association noted that the game was more attractive to Texan teachers than Crosscountry USA due to the \\"proximity and familiarity with the content\\".https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED316193.pdf  Crosscountry North Dakota (1992)  In October 1992, Didatech announced a deal with the North Dakota's Department of Public Instruction to create a state-specific version of the software for the state's schools. The state would provide statistical data to adapt Cross Country USA to a North Dakotan edition. Didatech estimated a production schedule of 100 hours, much quicker than the year taken for the USA version. This came off the heels of the targeted versions Canada, California, and Texas. The game was unique in that Didatech worked with the state's officials directly in production, while the Texas and Californian versions were created without the states' input. At the time of the announcement, Didatech was arranging deals similar to the North Dakotan one with Illinois, Virginia, Ontario, and British Columbia. the game was released onto the Apple II, while a DOS version was being worked on for release the following year. The Computer Paper felt the project \\"makes the most of what the small firm has\\". That game had turned out to be cost-effective; the state invested $45,000 and supplied information for the software maker to use, while Didatech produced the game and manual. Didatech sold a school version of the software to the state, which then sold it directly to schools; meanwhile Didatech would sell a separate retail version through its traditional retail channels. The cost per school was only $65, verses $350 for the site license of a national title. Didatech president Paul Melhus asserted that this type of collaboration was better suited to smaller states due to them being less bureaucratic, more flexible, and more open to innovation. This formula was later followed with Where in North Dakota Is Carmen Sandiego?. Crosscountry Canada Platinum (2000) The game was added to incorporate the new territory of Nunavut and the Confederation Bridge in Prince Edward Island. Crosscountry USA 2 (2002) The game was released in 2002, by Ingenuity Works.http://www.ingenuityworks.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=51 Crosscountry Canada 2 (2002) Crosscountry Canada 2 cover art This game was released in 2002, by Ingenuity Works.

History The company began making automotive safety equipment and accessories in 1938, as well as importing car and motorcycle accessories. During the 1970s, Britax began making childcare safety products, primarily child safety seats and strollers. Excelsior Motor Company Excelsior Motor Company, a former motorcycle company, bought Britax Group for ¬£880,000 in March 1963. It diversified into aircraft interiors and seating, car mirrors and car seating. Its main competitor in the 1960s was Irvin Air Chute, which had been Britain's main manufacturer and designer of parachutes. In 1960, the BSI introduced a kite-mark BS 3254 for car seats, and Britax was one of the first to comply to the standard. In 1960, one of their seatbelts saved Donald Campbell when he crashed at 400 mph. Its belts were made from Terylene (now known as PET) made by ICI. Also in 1960 it bought the Cyclemaster motorcycle company in Byfleet. In June 1963, it introduced a new type of seat belt that allowed the belt to move but locked in rapid deceleration, as all belts are now today, known as inertia reel, and which it called an 'automatic belt'. In the mid-1960s, Britax was based on Chertsey Road in Byfleet. In June 1966, the parent company, Excelsior Motor, bought Notek, a car light manufacturer. Britax-Excelsior In January 1968, due to the prominence of the Britax brand, the parent company became known as Britax-Excelsior. At this time, its main competitor was Kangol Magnet, although Britax had over 80% of the UK market. From July 1968, all new cars were required to have front passenger seat belts fitted. However, their usage was not legally required until 1983. In January 1970, it bought Hans Kolb of Munich, Germany. The chairman was Oscar Proctor. In December 1971, it was bought by Griffiths Bentley of Staffordshire for ¬£4.27 million. Stephen Proctor became managing director of Griffiths Bentley. BSG International Griffiths Bentley was bought by the Bristol Street Group to become BSG International. In February 1978, this company bought Weathershields, a Birmingham sunroof manufacturer. On 3 December 1982, the Duke of Edinburgh visited Britax's factory in Chichester. The Britax brand also applied to sun- roofs. In March 1995, LA Rumbold the Surrey-based aircraft interiors company owned by BSG International, won a contract to manufacture all toilet modules for Boeing 737s. Britax International It was known as BSG International until May 1997, becoming Britax International. The chief executive was Richard Marton from the 1990s until November 2000, replaced by Bernard Brogan. In May 1996, it set up a joint venture with Koito Industries to make car lights for the European car market. In the late 1990s it was world leader in car safety seats and aircraft interiors. It bought Buderus Sell, a German aircraft seat manufacturer in June 1997 for ¬£73 million. In June 1998 it bought Public Safety Equipment of America, which made fire engine sirens, for ¬£75 million later in August 1998, it sold its Autolease vehicle leasing company to Standard Chartered for ¬£83 million. In April 2000, it bought Bellingham, an American aircraft interiors company, from Hexcel for ¬£73 million. It sold its car mirrors division to Reitter & Schefenacker of Germany for ¬£200 million. Britax patents Britax is the patent holder for over 180 United States granted patents.List of Britax's patents The Isofix (known as LATCH in the US) system was developed jointly by child safety seat maker Britax-R√∂mer and Volkswagen, with the first compatible products released in 1997. However at the US DOT's request, Britax filed a series of \\"Terminal Disclaimers\\" to waive all its ISOFIX patent rights and dedicate the patents to the public good, so the US LATCH regulations could be established in 1998. Management buyout In July 2001, it underwent a ¬£441 million management buyout. In September 2005, Britax International sold its Britax Childcare division for ¬£230 million to Carlyle Group, a private equity company. In November 2010, Carlyle sold Britax Childcare, to Nordic Capital, for a reported ¬£450 million. BOB Gear In 2011, Britax acquired BOB Gear, a brand of jogging pushchairs and accessories.About BOB  Investigation by the Consumer Product Safety Commission  According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which relied on consumer-submitted reports, nearly 100 adults and children had been injured by the BOB jogging pushchairs from 2012 to 2018. The common problem appeared to be that the front wheel of the three-wheel pushchair fell off. According to a Consumer Product Safety Commission lawsuit, Britax had failed to disclose these accidents to regulators. The Consumer Product Safety Commission asked Britax to voluntarily recall the product, saying it was unsafe. Britax refused to do so, asserting that the product was safe. During the course of the investigation, Republicans gained a majority on the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Subsequently, Republicans on the agency kept Democratic members of the agency in the dark about the investigation into the BOB pushchairs and helped to end the case against the company in court.

It is the only holiday, which is devoted to all children of the world by Atat√ºrk. It is also observed by Northern Cyprus. Background 23 April is the day that the Grand National Assembly of Turkey was founded in 1920. The national council denounced the government of the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed VI and announced a temporary constitution. This national day, April 23 Children's Day, in Turkey is a unique event. The founder of the Turkish Republic, Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk, presented April 23 to all the world's children to emphasize that they are successor of the future. During the War of Independence, Grand National Assembly met in Ankara and laid down the foundations of a new, independent, secular and modern republic from the ashes of the Ottoman Empire. Following the defeat of the Allied invasion forces on September 9, 1922 and the signing of the Treaty of Lausanne on July 24, 1923, Atat√ºrk started his task of establishing the institutions of the new state. Over the next eight years, Atat√ºrk and his followers adopted sweeping reforms to create a modern Turkey, divorced from its Ottoman past. In unprecedented moves, he dedicated the sovereignty day to the children and entrusted in the hands of the youth the protection of this sovereignty and independence. Customs Every year, the children in Turkey celebrate National Sovereignty and Children's Day as a national holiday. Similar to other April events, Children's Day celebrations often take place outdoors. Schools participate in week-long ceremonies marked by performances in all fields in large stadiums watched by the entire nation. Among the activities on this day, the children send their representatives to replace state officials and high ranking civil servants in their offices. The President, the cabinet ministers, provincial governors, and mayors all turn over their positions to children's representatives. These children, in turn, sign executive orders relating to educational and environmental policies. On this day, the children also replace the parliamentarians in the Grand National Assembly and hold a special session to discuss matters concerning children's issues. Over the last two decades, the Turkish Republic has been working hard to internationalize this important day. Their efforts resulted in large number of countries sending groups of children to Turkey to participate in the above stated festivities. During their stay in Turkey, the foreign children are housed in Turkish homes and find an important opportunity to interact with the Turkish children and learn about each other's countries and cultures. The foreign children groups also participate in the special session of the Grand National Assembly.

Previously, he served as Chief Executive for Stralliance Developments and Watersun Homes, a Melbourne-based development and construction company. Campbell was previously the Chief Executive of the for a period of more than 8 years, after returning to Melbourne from Brisbane where he was running the 2001 Goodwill Games as Chief Executive. Campbell is an accomplished sailor and was an Australian Olympian (yachting). Education In 1985, Rose received his Bachelor of Applied Science (Hons) Degree in Physical Education and Recreation from the Victoria University of Technology. In 2005, he was bestowed with an Honorary Doctorate by Victoria University for Sports Achievements in the western region of Melbourne including his services to sport, sports administration and the community. Rose completed his HSC at Melbourne Grammar School in 1982. Sporting career In 1982 Campbell was a member of the victorious Head of the River crew for Melbourne Grammar School (5th seat), where he was also Vice Captain of the first XV Rugby team, where he played as loose head forward. He played in the Victorian School Boys Rugby Team at the International Series in New Zealand in 1980 before devoting more time to his love of yachting. His achievements there span from 1979 to 1995 and highlights include being the Australian Representative in the Finn Dinghy Class at the inaugural Goodwill Games in Russia in 1986. He also participated as a crew member of Steak and Kidney for the America's Cup Defence Series in Perth in 1986, and as a team member (alternative helmsman) for the Australian Olympic Yachting Team at the Olympic Games in Seoul in 1988. Business career Capitalising on his sporting successes and combined with his entrepreneurial skills, Campbell moved to managing specific sporting events, firstly as Sports and Recreational Marketing Manager for the Victorian Health Promotion Foundation (part of the Victorian Government) in 1989 and from 1990 - 1994 as Executive Director of the Victorian Yachting Council, now Yachting Victoria. In this role he held various positions with the Australian Yachting Federation, now Yachting Australia, and the International Yacht Racing Union, now the International Sailing Federation (ISAF). From 1995 to 1997, Campbell held the position as Chief Executive of the Melbourne Major Events Company Limited, which was responsible for many international concerts, festivals and international sporting championships and events being brought to Melbourne and Victoria for the first time. The success of the Melbourne Major Events Company was an integral part of repositioning Melbourne as a liveable city, and a city that is internationally recognised as a major sporting and events capital. The procurement of these events heavily drove Victoria's economic recovery and infrastructure development, particularly around public amenity and sporting facilities. A move to the position as Chief Executive of the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games Bid, working with Ron Walker, Bid Chairman, saw the company successful in its bid for the Commonwealth Games to be held in Melbourne in 2006. Campbell moved to Brisbane in early 1999, as Chief Executive of the 2001 Goodwill Games - The Ted Turner initiative to bring the world's best athletes together to compete in good will. This was the most successful games held from a financial perspective. In August 2002, Campbell joined the Western Bulldogs, AFL Football Club as Chief Executive. The financial and operational problems of the Bulldogs were well documented. After announcing a $3 Million loss within two months of arriving, Campbell set about transforming the football club into a viable, sustainable, community-oriented football club that served the needs of the whole of the western region of Melbourne. One of the most significant achievements during Campbell's tenure was the redevelopment/revitalisation of the Whitten Oval creating a vibrant community hub which today, stands proudly representing the Club and its footprint within the western region of Melbourne. The club has yet to deliver on its on-field capabilities (in that it is yet to win a premiership flag since its first flag in 1954), however, the foundations have been built off-field with a $32.5 Million Whitten Oval Redevelopment (the home of the Western Bulldogs) and substantial increases in members. The Club announced a small operating loss of $280,000 in financial year 2006. In the last 3 years of Campbell's tenure, he returned the Club to healthy profits in excess of $1 million (EBTD) and a record membership of over 37,500 adult members. In December 2010, Campbell resigned as Chief Executive of the Western Bulldogs to take up the role at Stralliance Developments. In 2012, Campbell was recruited to the position of Chief Executive of VicTrack commencing in February 2013. www.victrack.com.au Other present and past appointments include the Melbourne Recital Centre, Victoria University Foundation, Early Childhood Management Services - a not- for-profit community childcare provider, Australia New Zealand Melanoma Trials Group, Founding Chairman of Australian Melanoma Consumer Alliance, and Founding Chairman Melbourne Melanoma Project Consumer Reference Group.

The Thai whiting ranges from the west coast of India to the Gulf of Thailand in the east, inhabiting silty substrates in shallow waters. First identified in 1977 from a specimen found in a fish market, the species has had little research performed on its biology, and is frequently misidentified as Sillago sihama or Sillago maculata Thai whiting are commonly caught by fishermen throughout their range and are marketed fresh locally. Taxonomy and naming The Thai whiting is one of 29 species in the genus Sillago, which is one of three divisions of the smelt whiting family Sillaginidae. The smelt-whitings are Perciformes in the suborder Percoidea. The species was first recognized and named Sillago intermedius by Wongratana in 1977 after a number of unknown sillaginid individuals were found in a Thai fish market whilst Wongratana was collecting specimens of sillaginids to be sent to McKay for his review of the Sillaginidae. He based his description on a specimen taken from the east coast of Thailand in 1977, which was allocated to be the holotype. The species has been subsequently misidentified as Sillago maculata, as the blotches on the species are fairly similar. Description As with most of the genus Sillago, the Thai whiting has a slightly compressed, elongate body tapering toward the terminal mouth. The body is covered in small ctenoid scales extending to the two rows of cheek scales and head. The first dorsal fin has 11 spines and the second dorsal fin has 1 leading spine with 21 to 22 soft rays posterior. The anal fin is similar to the second dorsal fin, but has 2 spines with 21 to 22 soft rays posterior to the spines. Other distinguishing features include 67 to 70 lateral line scales and a total of 34 vertebrae. The species has a known maximum length of 20 cm. The swim bladder has two anterior extensions which extend forward and diverge before terminating above the auditory capsule. Two lateral extensions commence anteriorly, sending tubules to the anterior and extending below the abdominal wall adjacent to the swimbladder. There are also two posterior extensions which project into the post-coelomic region. The morphology of the swim-bladder is quite similar to S. sihama, but the tubules are very simple, unlike S. sihama which has complexly folded extensions. The Thai whiting is a pale silvery colour, being darker on top and lighter below. The top of the snout is blackish, while the opercle, preopercle and preorbital are bright silver. The sides of the body below the lateral line have a longitudinal row of 8 or 9 dark blotches. The back also has a row of dusky blotches. The caudal fin has darker upper and lower rays, with all other fins hyaline in appearance. Distribution and habitat As its name suggests, the Thai whiting occurs predominantly in Thailand where it ranges the Gulf of Thailand, extending westward to the west coast of the Indian subcontinent, apparently having a fairly scattered distribution. The Thai whiting is a shallow water, inshore species which inhabits open silty substrates at depths of 0 to 10 m, occasionally entering estuaries. Nothing else known of its biology. Relationship to humans Like other sillaginids, the Thai whiting is taken on a small scale by fishermen throughout its range, where it is sold fresh in local markets. It is often not differentiated form other sillaginids due to its close resemblance to both S. sihama and S. maculata.

Ondine's extensive catalogue includes nearly five hundred recordings of artists and ensembles such as conductor and pianist Christoph Eschenbach, conductors Vladimir Ashkenazy, Esa-Pekka Salonen, Jukka-Pekka Saraste, Sakari Oramo, Leif Segerstam, John Storg√•rds and Mikko Franck, orchestras such as The Philadelphia Orchestra, the Orchestre de Paris, the London Sinfonietta, the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the Czech Philharmonic, the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra and the Helsinki Philharmonic, sopranos Karita Mattila and Soile Isokoski, pianist Olli Mustonen, violinist Pekka Kuusisto and clarinetist Kari Kriikku. The label has also had a long and fruitful association with the Finnish composers Einojuhani Rautavaara, Kaija Saariaho and Magnus Lindberg, having recorded the premieres of many of their works and garnering many awards along the way. The recording of Einojuhani Rautavaara's 7th Symphony (Angel of Light), was released in 1996 to a huge commercial success. The label has recorded nearly the complete works of the composer. History The roots of Ondine date back to 1985 when founder Reijo Kiilunen released the very first Ondine album under the auspices of the renowned Finnish Kuhmo Chamber Music Festival. The label's initial mission was to produce one live album at the Festival each season. The fourth album, however, featured Einojuhani Rautavaara's opera Thomas, raising major international attention and opening up the possibility for North American distribution. Kiilunen, who was running the Festival's concert agency and had begun the recording activity part-time, soon decided to devote himself fully to the development of this new business, producing and editing the first 50 releases himself. In 1991, Seppo Siirala joined as producer, and the Helsinki- based company has been expanding steadily since. Today, Ondine continues to uphold its reputation as one of the most respected labels in classical music, and its products have received numerous prizes at the Cannes (MIDEM) Classical Awards, the Gramophone Awards, the BBC Music Magazine Awards and the Classical Internet Awards.

It is used in theories of the modularity of mind and the closely related society of mind theory and was developed by Jerry Fodor. It became better known throughout cognitive psychology by means of his book, The Modularity of Mind (1983). The nine aspects he lists that make up a mental module are domain specificity, mandatory operation, limited central accessibility, fast processing, informational encapsulation,‚Äòshallow‚Äô outputs, fixed neural architecture, characteristic and specific breakdown patterns, and characteristic ontogenetic pace and sequencing. Not all of these are necessary for the unit to be considered a module, but they serve as general parameters.Robbins, Philip, \\"Modularity of Mind\\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = <https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2017/entries/modularity-mind/>.

Psychological disorders  Many common psychological and personality disorders are caused by cognitive modules running amok.  Jealousy  All people are born with a basic jealousy cognitive module, which is developed through as an evolutionary strategy in order to safeguard a mate. Problem with Jealousy of Past Relations By Gunborg Palme 2006This module triggers aggression towards competitors in order to ensure paternity and prevent extramarital offspring. If this module is activated to a strong degree, it becomes a personality disorder.Tatiana's Sex Advice to All Creation: The Definitive Guide to the Evolutionary Biology of Sex Olivia Judson, Dr. Publisher: Vintage; New Ed (2003), 320p.

Barkow et al., The Adapted Mind, Oxford University Press, 1992, page 302-305.David M. Buss: The evolution of desire] - 2nd edition, Basic Books 2003, pages 129ff.  Stalking  Stalking is an extreme psychological disorder also related to jealousy and several other cognitive modules.Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - DSM- IV, American Psychiatric Association 1994 page 287 A stalker is a person who behaves as if he had a relation to another person who is not interested in him. Some behaviors related to this disorder can get to the extent of following the other person on the street or observe him or her at home, compulsively reviewing their activity on social media, and can even result in harassment.  Paranoia  Being suspicious of fellow human beings is a cognitive module linked to human survival traits, which is generally characterized by being excessively suspicious of others or even situations, perceiving irrational threats from others, or feeling disruptive distrust in others. Such behaviour, in its extreme cases is labeled as paranoid schizophrenia by matter experts, or in milder forms it is also called paranoid personality disorder.Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - DSM-IV, American Psychiatric Association 1994 pages 634ffErlene Rosowsky, Robert C. Abrams, Richard A. Zweig: Personality Disorders in Older Adults: Emerging Issues in Diagnosis and Treatment; Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1999. p. 154.  Obsessive-compulsive disorder  An example of this disorder is commonly illustrated by a person who will repeatedly check that a door is locked. One may constantly wash hands or other body parts, sometimes for hours, to ensure cleanliness.Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - DSM-IV, American Psychiatric Association 1994 pages 417ff The obsessive-compulsory disorder is an extreme malfunction of a normal adaptation trait in all humans.  Transference  A cognitive moduleThornton, Stephen P. (2006) Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) developed to solve a particular problem in which an emotional load can sometimes be taken to other situations where it is not appropriate. One may be angry at one's boss, but take the anger out on one's family. Often, the transference is unconscious (see also Subconscious mind and Unconscious mind). In psychotherapy, the patient is made aware of this, which makes it easier to modify the unsuitable behaviour.Gabbard GO, Horwitz L, Allen JG, Frieswyk S, Newsom G, Colson DB, Coyne L.: \\"Transference interpretation in the psychotherapy of borderline patients: a high-risk, high- gain phenomenon\\", Harv Rev Psychiatry. 1994 Jul-Aug;2(2):59-69.  Freud's theory of sublimation  Sublimation presents itself when a certain impulse that is socially unacceptable is deflected into a more suitable public behavior.Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) Thornton, Stephen P. (2006) Freud also introduced the idea of the unconscious, which interpreted cognitive modules where a person is not aware of the initial cause of these modules and may use them inappropriately.  Schizophrenia  Schizophrenia is a psychotic disorder where cognitive modules are triggered too often, overwhelming the brain with information.D. Weinberger, Prefrontal neurons and the genetics of schizophrenia Biological Psychiatry, Volume 50, Issue 11, Pages 825-844. The inability to repress overwhelming information is a cause of schizophrenia.Randolph M. Nesse and Alan T. Lloyd, The Evolution of Psychodynamic Mechanisms, in Jerome H. Barkow et al., The Adapted Mind, Oxford University Press, 1992, page 608. Treatment of cognitive module psychological disorders Cognitive therapy is a psychotherapeutic method that helps people better understand the cognitive modules that cause them to do certain things, and to teach them alternative, more appropriate cognitive modules to use instead in the future. Psychoanalytic view of cognitive modules According to psychoanalytic theory, many cognitive modules are unconscious and repressed, to avoid mental conflicts. Defenses are meant to be cognitive modules used to suppress the awareness of other cognitive modules. Unconscious cognitive modules may influence our behaviour without our being aware of it. Evolutionary psychology view In the research field of evolutionary psychology it is believed that some cognitive modules are inherited and some are created by learning, but the creation of new modules by learning is often guided by inherited modules.David M. Buss: Evolutionary Psychology - The New Science of the Mind] - 2nd edition, Pearson Education 2004, pages 19‚Äì21 For example, the ability to drive a car or throw a basketball are certainly learned and not inherited modules, but they may make use of inherited modules to rapidly compute trajectories. There is some disagreement between different social scientists on the importance to the capabilities of the human mind of inherited modules. Evolutionary psychologists claim that other social scientists do not accept that some modules are partially inherited,Tooby, John and Cosmides, Leda 1992 The Psychological Foundations of Culture, in The Adapted Mind: Evolutionary Psychology and the Generation of Culture, Oxford University Press, page 38. other social scientists claim that evolutionary psychologists are exaggerating the importance of inherited cognitive modules. Memory and creative thought A very important aspect of how humans think is the ability, when encountering a situation or problem, to find more or less similar, but not identical, experiences or cognitive modules. This can be compared to what happens if you sound a tone near a piano. The piano string corresponding to this particular tone will then vibrate. But also other strings, from nearby strings, will vibrate to a lesser extent. Exactly how the human mind does this is not known, but it is believed that when you encounter a situation or problem, many different cognitive modules are activated at the same time, and the mind selects those most useful for understanding a new situation or solving a new problem.Liane Gabora: Toward a theory of creative inklings In (R. Ascott, ed.) Art, Technology, and Consciousness, Intellect Press, p. 159-164.D. Goleman, Vital lies, simple truths, Simon & Schuster 1985. Ethics and law Most law- abiding people have cognitive modules that stop them from committing crimes. Criminals have different modules, causing criminal behaviour. Thus, cognitive modules can be a cause of both ethical and unethical behaviour.David Abrahamsen: The Psychology of Crime; Columbia University Press, 1960. p. 158ff See also * Cognition * Cognitive ethology * Functionalism (philosophy of mind) * Language module * Visual modularity References This article is based on an article in Web4Health.

It belongs to the wheatear genus Oenanthe which was formerly placed in the thrush family Turdidae but is now in the Old World flycatcher family Muscicapidae. The red- tailed wheatear used to be considered a subspecies of the Kurdish wheatear (O. xanthoprymna) but is now often regarded as a separate species.

The rump and bases of the outer tail-feathers are reddish while the rest of the tail is black forming a T-shaped pattern.Harris, Alan; Hadoram Shirihai & David Christie (1996) The Macmillan Birder's Guide to European and Middle Eastern Birds, Macmillan, London. . There is little difference between males and females but the male has black between the eye and bill.Grimmett, Richard; Carol Inskipp & Tim Inskipp (1999) Pocket Guide to the Birds of the Indian Subcontinent, Christopher Helm, London. . The female Kurdistan wheatear can be very similar but usually has white bases to the outer tail-feathers. Adult males and some females of the Kurdistan wheatear are quite different with a black face and throat and greyer upperparts. The song is a simple repeated whistle. The bird has several clicking, rasping and whistling calls. Taxonomy The species was described in 1863 by the Italian zoologist Filippo de Filippi who named it Dromolaea chrysopgyia. It was later treated as a subspecies of the Kurdish wheatear (O. xanthoprymna) after birds with an appearance intermediate between the two (\\"O. x. cummingi\\") were found, suggesting that they could interbreed. However, these hybrid birds may in fact be first-winter Kurdish wheatears.Roselaar C. S. (1995) Songbirds of Turkey, an atlas of biodiversity of Turkish passerine birds, Pica Press. . Red-tailed wheatears in the eastern part of the range are slightly paler and are sometimes regarded as a separate subspecies, O. c. kingi. Distribution and habitat Its breeding range extends from north-east Turkey, Armenia and Azerbaijan eastwards through Iran to Afghanistan, southern Tajikistan and western Pakistan. It migrates south to winter in the Arabian Peninsula, Eritrea, southern parts of Iraq and Iran, Pakistan and north-west India. It has occurred as a vagrant in Israel, Ethiopia, Djibouti and Nepal. It breeds in mountainous areas from 1,200‚Äî4,000 m above sea-level. It nests on steep, barren, rocky ground with little vegetation. It winters at lower levels occurring on rocky hills, steppe, scrubland and semi-desert. Behaviour It usually forages on bare ground, feeding mainly on insects such as ants, beetles and caterpillars. It will pick food from vegetation, dig with its bill for beetle larvae and launch attacks from an exposed perch on a rock or stone. It breeds from late March or April to June, raising two broods. The nest is a cup of grass and other plant material built in a hole in rocks, stones or a wall. Four to six eggs are laid and are incubated for 13 days. The eggs are pale bluish-white, sometimes with reddish-brown spots.

This large, three-storied Baroque building in Palladian style was designed by Tylman van Gameren. In 1688 it was purchased by Queen Maria Kazimiera and transferred to the Benedictines of the Blessed Sacrament. From 1688 till 1692 the Kotowski residence was transformed into a church-cum-cloister by Tylman van Gameren. In the 18th century the monastery was enlarged. Around 1745 the new palace was built at the New Town Market Square and from 1771 till 1779 King Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski established a new building situated at the escarpment. Those two buildings were connected in 1788. During the Second World War, the building was used as a hospital. This made it a frequent target for bombing by the Germans in the Warsaw Uprising.

Mechanism Carbon dioxide (CO2) is produced in tissues as a byproduct of normal metabolism. It dissolves in the solution of blood plasma and into red blood cells (RBC), where carbonic anhydrase catalyzes its hydration to carbonic acid (H2CO3). Carbonic acid then spontaneously dissociates to form bicarbonate Ions (HCO3‚àí) and a hydrogen ion (H+). In response to the decrease in intracellular pCO2, more CO2 passively diffuses into the cell. Cell membranes are generally impermeable to charged ions (i.e. H+, HCO3‚àí ) but RBCs are able to exchange bicarbonate for chloride using the anion exchanger protein Band 3. Thus, the rise in intracellular bicarbonate leads to bicarbonate export and chloride intake. The term \\"chloride shift\\" refers to this exchange. Consequently, chloride concentration is lower in systemic venous blood than in systemic arterial blood: high venous pCO2 leads to bicarbonate production in RBCs, which then leaves the RBC in exchange for chloride coming in. The opposite process occurs in the pulmonary capillaries of the lungs when the PO2 rises and PCO2 falls, and the Haldane effect occurs (release of CO2 from hemoglobin during oxygenation). This releases hydrogen ions from hemoglobin, increases free H+ concentration within RBCs, and shifts the equilibrium towards CO2 and water formation from bicarbonate. The subsequent decrease in intracellular bicarbonate concentration reverses chloride-bicarbonate exchange: bicarbonate moves into the cell in exchange for chloride moving out. Inward movement of bicarbonate via the Band 3 exchanger allows carbonic anhydrase to convert it to CO2 for expiration. The chloride shift may also regulate the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen through the chloride ion acting as an allosteric effector.  Reaction  Reaction (as it occurs in the pulmonary capillaries) RBC PLASMA HCO3‚àí <\\\\-- <\\\\-- <\\\\-- HCO3‚àí K+ Na+ Cl‚àí \\\\--> --> --> --> Cl‚àí Bicarbonate in the red blood cell (RBC) exchanging with chloride from plasma in the lungs. The underlying properties creating the chloride shift are the presence of carbonic anhydrase within the RBCs but not the plasma, and the permeability of the RBC membrane to carbon dioxide and bicarbonate ion but not to hydrogen ion. Continuous process of carbonic acid dissociation and outflow of bicarbonate ions would eventually lead to a change of intracellular electric potential because of lasting H+ ions. Inflow of chloride ions maintains electrical neutrality of a cell. The net direction of bicarbonate- chloride exchange (bicarbonate out of RBCs in the systemic capillaries, bicarbonate into RBCs at pulmonary capillaries) proceeds in the direction that decreases the sum of the electrochemical potentials for the chloride and bicarbonate ions being transported.

Warren Knoll Motte The first \\"Tilsworth Castle\\", now known as \\"Warren Knoll Motte\\", was a pre-11th century motte-and-bailey castle, built prior to the Norman Invasion in 1066. Originally a Saxon stronghold, it was held by Levric, son of Osmund. It was a timber castle, and believed to have had outer fortifications to the east and north. Mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as \\"Tilsworth Manor\\", it was at that time held by William Peverel. By the middle of the 13th century, the castle had passed into the Morteyn family, and was held by seven members of that family before passing, in 1362, into the hands of a Morteyn cousin, Richard Chamberlain. The manor was thus in the Chamberlain family, passing to Richard's son Richard (d. 24 August 1396), and then to Richard's grandson Richard (1390‚Äì1439), a minor at the time of his inheritance. During his minority, the manor was held by his mother Margaret Chamberlain (d. 18 April 1408), (n√©e de Lovaine), and stepfather Philip St.Clair, until his possession of it, upon Margaret's death, in 1408. His death in 1439, and the death of his elder son Richard in the same year, left the manor in the possession of his younger son William Chamberlain. Sometime around Richard's death, during the 15th century, a new manor house was built across from the church. The old one falling into ruins thereafter. Nothing but cropmarks and earthworks remain. The site was excavated in 1972, and is listed as a Scheduled Monument. Tilsworth Manor Built just beside Warren Knoll, on lower ground, was the second \\"Tilsworth Castle\\", a 15th-century fortified, and moated, manor house. The manor was inclosed by an Act of Parliament in 1767. It was demolished about the year 1800 and a new manor house was built on the same location. It was most likely built by Richard Chamberlain (d. 1496), the son of the previous mentioned William Chamberlain. The manor passed to Richard's son Edward Chamberlain (b. 1479), who gave it to his maternal grandfather Sir Richard Fowler in 1528. It was held in the Fowler family for only 3 generations, until sold by Richard Fowler, in 1606, to Sir Anthony Chester. The sale of the estate followed an incident, in 1600, during which Richard Fowler was imprisoned in the Tower of London as the result of a forged letter implicating him in a plot to poison Queen Elizabeth I. Richard's young wife, her lover and her brother were later convicted of the forgery. The estate then passed through the hands of eight members of the Chester family before being sold by Charles Chester to Sir Gregory Osborn Page-Turner, son of Gregory Page-Turner, 3rd Baronet, in 1838. The property was then in the ownership of that family, in the forms of Mr. F. A. Page-Turner and Sir E. H. Page-Turner, until the latter's death in 1898, at which time it was held by his trustees. Currently on the site is the third manor, of the same name, built in the 19th century by a member of the Chester family, which still retains the 15th century gate tower and the moat. The current Tilsworth Manor is a private residence, though the Tilsworth F√™te is held in the grounds each June. This last site of \\"Tilsworth Castle\\" is a Scheduled Monument.

Population Places of interest * The church of St. Armand, rebuilt as was the rest of the village, after World War I. World War I Fresnoy was virtually destroyed in 1917 during the First World War. After their successes in the spring campaigns (including the taking of Vimy Ridge), the Canadians and British pushed eastwards across open country until they reached German defence lines that, in this sector, ran north to south from Arleux, on to Oppy and then down to Gavrelle. Following a successful push by the Canadians through Arelux in late April, German positions in and around Fresnoy became the scene of fierce fighting on April 28, 1917. Ernst J√ºnger, who wrote Storm of Steel, recalled the barrage on the village: ‚ÄòFresnoy was one towering fountain of earth after another. Each second seemed to outdo the last. As if by some magical power, one house subsided into the earth; walls broke, gables fell, and bare sets of beams and joints were sent flying through the air, cutting down the roofs of other houses. Clouds of splinters danced over whitish wraiths of steam. Eyes and ears were utterly compelled by this devastation.‚Äô A few weeks later, on May 5, the Canadians managed to capture the village. It was lost, however, when ferocious German counterattacks were launched on May 7 and pushed the Canadians and British back. The frontline then stabilised just outside the village. In commemoration of this battle, Fresnoy Mountain in the Canadian Rockies was given its name in 1919.

The term arises from the international railway conference held and consequent convention signed in Bern, Switzerland in 1912. The official name of this gauge is the ' (, literally \\"pass-everywhere international\\"), and it came into force in 1914. The European (Berne) loading gauge is usually wide by rising to in the centre. This is a clearance envelope (see loading gauge) on a curve of radius. Previously, international through traffic, particularly freight, had been effectively constrained to vehicles and loads consistent with the standard French (with 1,500 V DC) loading gauge, the narrowest and lowest in Mainland Europe. As a result of accepting the convention, the French embarked on a period of progressive upgrade to make their network compliant.  Comparison  Even after adopting the convention, significant parts of the European network, such as Belgium and most Germanic countries, as well as Scandinavia, operated to larger gauges, thus restricting the interchange of traffic from those areas. Although the name \\"PPI\\" includes the characterisation as \\"international\\" it is actually the minimum standard just in Western Europe. The contiguous rail network in North America has a minimum width of 3250 mm (10 ft 8 in) and a minimum height of . The standard gauge rail network in Eastern Asia is built to a minimum width of , and the Chinese CRH2 as well as the Japanese 0 Series Shinkansen have a width of . Similarly the tracks in Sweden are built to 3400 mm (clearance SE-A and SE-B) just as the broad-gauge network under Russian influence (on tracks with 1520 mm). As such the Russian Velaro Sapsan and the Chinese Velaro CRH3 have widths of while the German variant Velaro ICE 3 is built to to fit in the PPI outline. Parts of the German network are built to accommodate wider trains from neighbouring countries. In a research project for ICE 4 a width of was tested but not pushed into production. container profiles in UIC loading gauges  European freight network  The success of the intermodal shipping containers led to some adaptations to allow ISO containers with a height of or Hi-Cube containers with a height of to be carried by rail in Western Europe. In general the deck height of flatcars was reduced to 940 mm to allow for shipping containers to fit in the \\"GB\\" clearance in France. It was further modified so that for the minimum height of the exterior walls (3175 mm) and the minimum height at the center (4320 mm) a third height was added such that at a width of 2720 mm a minimum height of 4180 mm is ensured. This profile was dubbed \\"GB+\\" and has a roof that is almost flat. All modern freight tracks in Western Europe are built to this size, the modern replacement for the PPI minimum international loading gauge. In comparison the central European \\"GC\\" loading gauge allows the use traditional flatcars with a deck height of 1100 to 1300 mm to carry intermodal shipping containers. Trains with Hi-Cube containers can not pass from Germany into France.

This term may also be used to describe a short ram air intake, a totally different intake modification. Operation All warm air intakes operate on the principle of decreasing the amount of oxygen available for combustion with fuel. Warm air from inside the engine bay is used opposed to air taken from the generally more restrictive stock intake. Warmer air is less dense, and thus contains less oxygen to burn fuel in. The car's ECU compensates by opening the throttle wider to admit more air. This, in turn, decreases the resistance the engine must overcome to suck air in. The net effect is for the engine to intake the same amount of oxygen (and thus burn the same amount of fuel, producing the same power) but with less pumping losses, allowing for a gain in fuel economy, at the expense of top-end power. Opposite principle of a cold air intake (CAI) which significantly differs by collecting air from a colder source outside the engine. In the extreme, a warm air intake can eliminate the need for a conventional throttle and thus eliminate throttle losses.Ronney, P. D., Shoda, M., Waida, S. T., Durbin, E.

World War I During most of the period of hostilities between 1914 and 1918 (World War I) Gommecourt was in the front line of the Western Front, occupied by the Imperial German Army, and was virtually destroyed as a result of the violence to which it was exposed.

The victorious German troops who defended the village during the battle were the 52nd Infantry Division from Baden together with 2nd Guards Reserve Division from Westphalia; the British troops taking part in the attack comprised the 56th (1/1st London) and the 46th (North Midland) Divisions.

A colony, in the sense of a region being ruled by a foreign overseas power, was in a different position from that of an independent country. As Maddison remarked some time ago of India, ‚ÄòThe major burden of foreign rule arose from the fact that the British raj was a regime of expatriates.‚Äô ‚ÄòThe Economic and Social Impact of Colonial Rule in India‚Äô Chapter 3 p. 19 of Class Structure and Economic Growth: India & Pakistan since the Moghuls A. Maddison (1971) Such expatriates generate a flow of funds out of the colony. Something similar would have occurred in Latin America during the post-Spanish period of ‚Äòinformal rule‚Äô by British and American finance. Simply, the Colonial Surplus is a measurement of the benefits in money terms gained by citizens, business and government of the colonising power (metropolis) from the colony. It is a measure of exploitation. It describes and calculates part of the economic relationship between colonising power and colony. The part it describes is revenue to the metropolis. The colonial surplus measures in money terms what the metropolis gets out of its colony, its gains. It includes the sum of the trading and financial relationship between the two. (and it covers gains made by other nationals operating in the colony). The foremost part deals with the balance of trade and services. The presence of a Colonial Surplus may be evidenced by an export surplus on the part of the colony that was outstandingly large. The export surplus must be particularly large for it has to pay real expenses such as insurance and freight of the goods exported which may not be part of the colonial surplus. But it is better if there is a Balance of Payments account for the colony. Better still if this can be supported by statistics from the Balance of Payments or National Income for the metropolis or from other overseas accounts. It need not be supposed that those records of colonial exploitation are especially accurate for accountancy was in its infancy and there will be errors, omissions and downright evasions in them. Nonetheless used critically they should be enough to determine the size of the Colonial Surplus, if any. Included in this calculation would be items not only like private and government dividends and profits transferred abroad but also pensions transferred abroad, travel expenses to and from the colony, other government expenditures overseas, changes in overseas bank balances and so on. Attention should be paid to profits made but not distributed in the colony and to investment out of undistributed profits which may or may not be included in the colony‚Äôs Balance of Payments. An example is the colony of the Netherlands East Indies (Indonesia) where they could not be included in the Balance of Payments for lack of evidence. In several colonies special arrangements were made for the transfer of funds that should be included in the Colonial Surplus but do not appear in the colony‚Äôs balance of payments data. They have to be sought for elsewhere. All but one of these items above deal with international transactions (or should do). The exception to this would be the inclusion of incomes made in the colony by non-indigenous private persons and businesses.

In 1130, monks of the Premonstratensian Order chose a site on the plateau between the rivers Canche and Authie to build their abbey. The church had begun in 1156 and consecrated in 1220. It was surrounded by many buildings and had a large tower, a barn and two cloisters. Hostilities in the sixteenth and seventeenth century caused much damage. In the early years of the 18th century, the church building was reconstructed, as was the rest of the abbey around 1751 under the leadership of Dom Ignace Cr√©pin with the guidance of the architect Arrageois Merville. After the revolution only the abbey church and agricultural outbuildings were left standing. The Marquis de Riencourt then transformed it into a chateau, Farm buildings were built between 1752 and 1755 by architect Claude Brunion and were expanded up to 1784. The current buildings facades are exceptional architecturally with bricks and stones. The chateau was accidentally burned down by British troops in 1918.

History Construction The house was Sir John Soane's first domestic commission, which he designed in 1783 and constructed during the following six years for Brampton Gurdon Dillingham. This replaced the Old Hall, which Dillingham had inherited in 1783, but had been convinced by Soane to demolish. Victorian & Edwardian Period The house passed through members of the Gurdon family to Robert Thornhagh Gurdon. After the death of his father, John Brampton Gurdon, in 1881, R.T. Gurdon commissioned Edward Boardman to renovate the site, including the construction of the clock- tower and summer-house and a remodeling of the gardens. Bertram Francis Gurdon succeeded to the estate in 1899, aged 25, and extended the library to create a billiards room. B.F. Gurdon however put the property up for auction in 1914, at the eve of the First World War, and moved to his family estates in Woodbridge. Twentieth Century At the 1914 auction, the estate was purchased by Arthur Gordon, who moved in after the conclusion of the war. Gordon improved the utilities of the Hall, but, after its requisition during the Second World War, put the estate up for sale. It was purchased by George Eglington, who developed the estate into a successful agricultural venture, notably breeding Welsh Pigs and Polled Friesian Cattle. While the Eglingtons still farm the estate, after George Eglington's death, the Hall was separated from the grazing land and once more put up for sale. In 1979 Peter Carroll bought Letton Hall and ten acres of gardens to create a conference and activity centre; Mary, his wife, died just six months after their arrival, but their project was completed. Present Day The hall is now mainly used for Christian conferences, youth camps and school trips. The hall includes its own purpose-built karting track.

Flora and fauna During the winter, the Mahodand lake freezes and is covered by heavy snow. In the summers, the basin of the lake is surrounded by a sheet of alpine flowers like geum, blue poppy, potentilla and gentian.

Similar crowns were included on the arms of Ireland before being superseded by the golden harp in the 16th century. The meaning of the crowns on the flag is not certain, but one possibility is that they may represent three of the medieval Hiberno-Norman lordships in Munster; the O‚ÄôBriens (Thomond), the Butlers (Ormond) and the Fitzgeralds (Desmond). Similarly, the arms of Munster (dark blue, three antique crowns Or) is thought to have been derived from those of the former Lordship of Ireland, or from the short-lived dukedom of Ireland created for Robert de Vere in 1386. The crowns are now usually depicted as \\"antique\\" or \\"eastern\\": a gold rim with eight sharp, triangular rays, of which five are seen.  History  For more than four hundred years, the Province of Munster has been heraldically symbolised by three golden antique crowns on a deep blue shield. The crowns may represent Thomond (Tuamhain, North Munster), Desmond (Deasumhain, South Munster), and Ormond (Urumhain, East Munster). While these arms are on record as relating to Munster as early as the sixteenth century, the motif, namely the antique Irish crown which inspired them, is considerably older. For example, a crown of the type now known as antique Irish, crafted in burnished metal and resting on a blue enamel surface, forms part of a thirteenth-century crozier head found near Cormac‚Äôs Chapel on the Rock of Cashel. This Gaelic Irish artifact is now in the National Museum of Ireland, Kildare Street, Dublin. Cashel was the seat of the Kings of Munster, from early Christian times through to the fifteenth century. In the case of the ‚Äòking-bishops‚Äô of Cashel, the placing of the antique crown on their crozier, could be interpreted as a symbolic assertion of their right to the political sovereignty of Munster. It is suggested therefore that the sovereignty of Munster, as expressed in heraldic format, uses the antique crown in triplicate. (Tripling of symbols in heraldic art is a convention used to achieve balance on the triangular surface of a shield.)The National Library of Ireland As to the tincture (colour) of the Munster shield, in Gaelic mythology the sovereignty of Munster was personified in M√≥r Muman ‚Äì a lady or goddess dressed in deep blue robes. Modern forms and uses The flag of Munster is usually displayed alongside the flags of Leinster, Ulster and Connacht, or as part of the combined flag of the Provinces of Ireland. The Munster flag is the official flag of the Munster Gaelic Athletic Association and the Munster rugby team. The three crowns of the flag can also be seen on the Munster Rugby crest, and also the Munster GAA crest.

He participated in the French Revolution of 1848, was author and editor of Anarchie, Journal de l'Ordre and Au fait ! Au fait ! Interpr√©tation de l'id√©e d√©mocratique. Biography Early life Not much is known about the childhood and young adulthood of Anselme Bellegarrigue. According to his close friend Ulysse Pic, he went to the Lyc√©e d'Auch for some time, then traveled in order to make his own education: between 1846 and 1848, he visited North America, via New York City, Boston, New Orleans and the West Indies. These travels convinced him of the advantages of democracy and individual liberties.He explains this evolution from his initially monarchist conviction in his novel Le Baron de Camebrac, en tourn√©e sur le Mississippi and his essay Les Femmes d'Am√©rique Catalan historian of individualist anarchism Xavier Diez reports that during his travels in the United States \\"he at least contacted (Henry David) Thoreau and, probably (Josiah) Warren.\\".Xavier Diez. El anarquismo individualista en Espa√±a (1923-1938). Virus editorial. Barcelona. 2007. pg. 60 Participation in the 1848 French Revolution Anselme Bellegarrigue came back to France on 21 February 1848, the day before the events that would end the reign of Louis-Philippe I. He participated in the revolt but never ceased criticising the direction taken by the movement from the day following the end of the July Monarchy: as a young worker passes by saying \\"This time, we won't be robbed of our victory!\\" (a reference to the July Revolution that had failed to install a regime satisfying workers' demands), he responds : \\"Ah, my friend, the victory has already been robbed: hasn't a temporary government been declared?\\". He also participated in the Soci√©t√© R√©publicaine Centrale (also called Club Blanqui), where he accused all of the political parties of the French Second Republic of having hijacked the popular revolt into more authoritarianism and central concentration of power, calling them \\"the pox of nations\\". He refused to call the historical period a revolution, instead saying of it that \\"the evolution of 1848 has only been a consolidation of what was meant to be abolished\\" because \\"a Revolution must be the ruin not of a government, but of all government.\\" While he was participating in a society composed mostly of socialist thinkers, he opposed all authoritarian measures and all social measures because he considered that any governmental intervention can be shown to be slavery of some by some others, or a violent conflict between men: \\"Anarchy is order, government is civil war.\\" He even mentioned concepts of civil disobedience and voluntary servitude: :A democrat is not one who commands, but one who disobeys. :You thought to this day that there were tyrants? Well! You were in error, as there only are slaves: where no one obeys, no one commands. In 1849 he founded the Association des Libres Penseurs in Meulan with some childhood friends, including Ulysse Pic (who then called himself Pic Dugers), in order to publish anarchist pamphlets; but the arrests of several members slowed and finally put an end to these activities. Anarchist publications Anselme Bellegarrigue published, edited and authored several anarchist texts. In 1848, between October and December he published Au fait ! Au fait ! Interpr√©tation de l'id√©e d√©mocratique in Toulouse. With Ulysse Pic he edited Le Dieu des riches et le Dieu des pauvres and Jean Mouton et le percepteur. He was also an editor for the daily La Civilisation from March 1849, a local newspaper selling about 2000 copies.Biography of Anselme Bellegarrigue by Max Nettlau. For his friends of the Association des Libres Penseurs, he wrote an article titled ¬´ L'anarchie, c'est l'ordre ¬ª (Anarchy is order) in the 3 April 1850 issue of La Voix du Peuple, but this issue's publication was interrupted. Later he wrote, edited and self-published his Anarchie, Journal de l'Ordre of which two issues appeared due to low readership: the third issue, containing a study on the origin of wealth, was never published. According to Sharif Gemie, this journal constitutes the very first anarchist manifesto in the worldAnselme Bellegarrigue: The World's First Anarchist Manifesto. Kate Sharpley Library 2002. . In 1851 he started writing a novel: \\"Le Baron de Camebrac, en tourn√©e sur le Mississippi\\", published episodically until 1854, and an essay: \\"Les femmes d'Am√©rique\\" describing his observations on American society. He participated in the writing of the Almanach de la Vile Multitude in 1851 and prepared an Almanach de l'Anarchisme for the year 1852, which was never published due to the French coup of 1851. Return to America By the establishment of the French Second Empire, Anselme Bellegarrigue went back to America, in Honduras, where, according to Max Nettlau, he was a professor, then in San Salvador where he is said to have participated in the government. Bellegarrigue's anarchism For anarchist historian George Woodcock \\"Bellegarrigue stood near to Stirner at the individualist end of the anarchist spectrum. He dissociated himself from all the political revolutionaries of 1848, and even Proudhon, whom he resembled in many of his ideas and from whom he derived more than he was inclined to admit.\\"George Woodcock. Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements (1962) pg. 276 Bellegarrigue's \\"conception of revolution by civil disobedience suggests that in America Bellegarrigue may have made contact with at least the ideas of (Henry David) Thoreau\\".\\"Anselme Bellegarrigue\\" by George Woodcock (1912-1995) \\"At times Bellegarrigue spoke in the words of solipsistic egoism. \\"I deny everything; I affirm only myself.... I am, that is a positive fact. All the rest is abstract and falls into Mathematical X, into the unknown.... There can be on earth no interest superior to mine, no interest to which I owe even the partial sacrifice of my interests.\\" Yet in apparent contradiction, Bellegarrigue adhered to the central anarchist tradition in his idea of society as necessary and natural and as having \\"a primordial existence\\". Quotes *There are, in truth, no worse counter-revolutionaries than revolutionaries ; because there are no worse citizens than the envious. *Power only possesses what it takes from the people, and for the citizens to believe that they have to give what they have in order to get welfare, their common sense must have been deeply distorted. *It is only when everyone's authority is equal among everyone, that social equilibrium is obviously attained. *A people that runs its own affairs is a self-governing people, and a self-governing people abolishes, by this very fact, and makes obsolete all the bazaar of legislation that popular agitation, more than the genius of the State's men, had engendered. *Revolution is the flux of interests: no one can represent interests, they represent themselves. The intense force of these interests' persevering and calm manifestation is the only revolutionary force that is both reasonable and possible. *One cannot redistribute wealth without first becoming master of all wealth; redistribution is first and foremost monopoly. *If governing is called a job, I ask to examine the products of this job, and if those products don't suit me, I declare that forcing me to consume them would be the strangest abuse of power a man could exercise on another man. It is true that this abuse is done by force and that I am the one who supports, on my own coins, this force I am complaining about. That said, I'm coiling back on myself and recognize that though I am a victim, I am also an idiot. But my idiocy only stems from my isolation, which is why I say to my fellow citizens: Let's rise up; let's only trust in ourselves; let's say: let freedom be, and freedom shall be. *So I hear that liberty without brakes is menacing. Who is she menacing? Who shall fear the untamed horse, but one who would tame it? Who shall fear an avalanche, but one who would stop it? Who trembles in front of liberty, but tyranny? A menacing liberty... one ought to say it's the opposite. What is frightening in her is the sound of her irons. Once those are shattered, she is no more tumultuous; but calm and wise. *Government is not a fact, but a fiction. The only permanent and eternal fact is people.

Since the early 1990s the group has consisted of tenor saxophonist and band leader Dave Hillyard as well as percussionist Larry McDonald. In live performances, they are supported by a rotating cast of musicians, including drummer Eddie Ocampo and Dave Wake on keys among others. Given reggae‚Äôs globally reaching influence, the Rocksteady 7 holds true to the genre's roots and the self- described \\"Jamaican Jazz\\" sound combines ska, rocksteady and reggae with extended jazz improvisation, intricate melodies, and complex harmonies. The group incorporates many diverse elements of world music with rocksteady rhythms, including ska, jazz, calypso, as well as early African and American jazz influences. As of late 2012, the Rocksteady has released seven studio albums and has seen some success, particularly in Europe and on United States college radio stations. They are currently signed to Brixton Records with previous releases on Hellcat and Do Tell Records. Biography David Hillyard & the Rocksteady 7 are innovators in the Jamaican Jazz genre, which experiments in mixing jazz, reggae, Latin, and ska. The group features a shifting collective of some of the best musicians in New York City with experience playing with a variety of musical acts from Sting to the Skatalites. Senior among them is veteran percussionist, Larry McDonald on congo. Larry began his career at the inception of ska music with Carlos Malcolm‚Äôs Afro Jamaicans. McDonald went on to perform on several classic reggae tracks such as Cherry Oh Baby, Funky Kingston and Rivers of Babylon. He left Jamaica after playing on several crucial Bob Marley cuts and has since backed up American icons, from Taj Mahal, Gil-Scott Heron, Bad Brains and Dave Hahn, earning him the sometime nickname ‚ÄúOriginal Beatnik‚Äù. Blending ska, reggae, jazz and blues, David Hillyard and The Rocksteady 7 has championed the style of mixing Jamaican Rhythms and American Jazz, celebrating commonalities between improvised foundation ska, roots reggae, and Latin jazz played by an accomplished and diverse line-up. \\"I picked the musicians for their personal style,\\" says Hillyard. \\"I want them to be themselves and make a soup. This recording is all live, no overdubs.\\" 1992‚Äì2007: Career beginnings The music of the Rocksteady 7 bridges the divide once thought to exist between early instrumental Jamaican ‚Äúroots‚Äù rhythms ala the Skatalites, Burning Spear, Rocksteady Freddie and early American Jazz ala David Murray, Charlie Haden, Sidney Bichet and Pharaoh Saunders. Reminiscent of sounds from the 1940s and 60s, the group fuses Latin American and jazz elements in their music, which is also influenced by Afro-Cuban mambo and Brazilian bossa nova. The colorful mix of work songs, calls, field and street cries, hollers, rhyme songs, and spirituals taken on by Hillyard and his group changed the format of reggae and jazz, respectively; By bringing the soloist to the forefront, during live shows and in his recording groups, they demonstrated that jazz improvisation could go far beyond ornamenting a simple melody, and his motto \\"improvise and overcome\\" showcases the talents of individual players, resulting in tenser rhythms and more complicated textures. The 1999‚Äôs release, Playtime is a lively, celebratory mix of early American Jazz and world music. The band's second album, United Front, released in 2003 contains stronger political undertones and uses the hypnotizing percussive base of the conga as a launching pad for an impressive mix of guitar and horn solos that weave in and out of the hypnotic groove laid down by the rhythm section. This album mixes free improvisation, reggae and revolutionary rhetoric to create \\"a true movement in the ska scene\\". 2008‚Äì10: \\"Way Out East\\" and beyond In 2007, the Rocksteady 7 released their 3rd album, Way Out East (Brixton), which was recorded at a club in Jena, Germany during a 2004 tour and captured the powerful energy of the band as a dynamic and inspiring live act noted as a perfect Jazz/Reggae fusion that will leave fans of both in a \\"state of bliss.\\" The nine tracks are filled with solos, dub-soaked passages, breaks and buildups that really let Hillyard and his killer crew stretch out. The band's latest 2009 release Get Back Up! (Brixton) debuted in 2009 as a landmark in Dave's \\"Jamaican Jazz\\" concept, blending subtleties and intricacies of the reggae beat with extended improvisation of seasoned jazz soloists. The title track evokes power reminiscent of Coltrane's Love Supreme and is a screaming triumph over hardship and adversity. The Rocksteady 7 has played numerous venues in New York City from SOBs, the Knitting Factory, Wetlands, Bbkings, and the Bottom Line. For most of 2005, they were regulars at Detour, a small jazz club on the lower east side of New York. They have also played at Los Angeles‚Äô Whisky A Go Go, Knitting Factory, Echoplex (dub club), and House of Blues; the Toronto Jazz Festival; and numerous club dates in the eastern United States and Canada. Since early 2004, they have also completed 3 European tours, performing in Spain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Germany, as well as touring the U.S. in 2011.

The arms are recorded as such on a map of Galway dated 1651,http://archives.library.nuigalway.ie now in the library of Trinity College, Dublin. These arms approximate rather closely to those of the Schottenkloster or Irish monastery founded in Regensburg, Bavaria in the 11th century.Heraldry in Ireland, The National Library of Ireland The arms of Connacht is blazoned Party Per Pale Argent and Azure, in the first an eagle dimidiated and displayed Sable in the second issuant from the partition an arm embowed and vested, the hand holding a sword erect, all Argent. These are believed to have been adopted from the arms of the medieval Schottenkl√∂ster (Gaelic monastery) in Regensburg, Germany. The arms of the Regensburg Schottenkl√∂ster, which date from at least the 14th century, combined the arms of the Holy Roman Emperor (from whom the abbey received protection) dimidiated with a symbol that may be linked with the crest of the O'Brien dynasty arms (an 11th-century O'Brien is listed as the \\"fundator\\" of the abbey). The arms may have been granted to Ruaidr√≠ Ua Conchobair, King of Connacht and the last High King of Ireland before the Norman invasion, by the abbey as a gift to return his patronage. The arms were given as the \\"old tyme arms\\" of Ireland by the Athlone Pursuivant, Edward Fletcher, c. 1575 and, with slight change of tinctures, became the arms of Connacht in the seventeenth century.Kennedy, John (Autumn 1991), \\"The Arms of Ireland: Medieval and Modern\\", Coat of Arms (155) History  The question is how the arms of that Schottenkloster located deep in the heart of the Holy Roman Empire come to be associated with the province of Connacht in Ireland. A somewhat unsatisfactory answer to this question can be found in Vatican Ms 11000 which contains a necrology of prominent Irish ecclesiastics and political rulers ‚Äì with floruits mainly in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries ‚Äì whose obituaries were recorded locally, apparently on the basis of their being substantial benefactors of the Schottenkloster at Regensburg. In the section of the aforementioned necrology headed \\"Kings\\", the initial entry relates to Donnchadh and Domhnall Mac Carthaigh, rulers of Desmond, to whom the arms of the Schottenkloster were apparently conceded, presumably as arms of affection. If it is assumed that the arms of the Schottenkloster were similarly conceded to the other royal benefactors noted in the necrology, then an explanation of the origins of the arms of the province of Connacht begins to emerge because the final entry in the necrology refers to Ruaidhr√≠ √ì Conchobhair, King of Connacht and last High King of Ireland. Present forms and uses The flag of Connacht is usually displayed alongside the flags of Leinster, Munster and Ulster, or as part of the combined flag of the Provinces of Ireland.

Owen Roe, nephew of Aodh (Hugh O'Neill), had entered the Spanish service after his uncle's defeat at Kinsale in 1601.

Eastern Tamils inhabit a region that is divided into Trincomalee District, Batticalo District and Ampara District.Kartithigesu, Sri Lankan Tamil society and politics, p.2-4 Early settlements Evidence of a settlement of people with burial practices similar to that found in the Tamil Nadu region in India and further North was excavated at megalithic burial sites at Pomparippu in the western coast and in Kathiraveli in the eastern coast. These are dated between the 2nd century BC and 2nd century AD.de Silva, A History of Sri Lanka, p.129 Although it is not known when ethnic Tamils first settled in Sri Lanka, early settlements occurred in the aftermath of repeated South Indian invasions (c. 1st to 13th centuries.). Tamil royal dynasties in this period are known to have patronized Tamil Saivite culture in the east that parralled the growth of the community in the area, and by the 6th century, a special coastal route by boat was functioning to the Koneswaram temple of Trincomalee and Thirukkovil temple of Batticaloa. It was not until the 13th century that there was firm evidence of the rise of a significant Tamil Hindu kingdom in the Jaffna Peninsula, complete with a Hindu king and a palace, in the aftermath of the collapse of the classical Sinhala Dry Zone civilisations.de Silva, A History of Sri Lanka, p.132 By the 11th and 12th centuries, the upper half of the eastern province had a large Tamil community.de Silva, A History of Sri Lanka, p.131 Historical Tamil settlements in the East.Tamils and the Tamil-speaking Muslim community formed the majority of the province prior to the Independence of the island Eastern Tamils had feudal organizations that centered around Ur PodiyarThe Kokkadicholai massacre and after at a village level and the Kudi system that controlled social interactions. They also were organized politically as Vannimai chiefsMcGilvray, Mukkuvar Vannimai: Tamil Caste and Matriclan Ideology in Batticaloa, Sri Lanka, p.34-97 who came nominally under the Kandyan kingdom. The most important social group were the Mukkuvar who had originated from South India and had repeatedly invaded Sri Lanka as evidenced by Sinhalese literature of that period called Kokila Sande≈õa as the Mukkara Hatana. One of the local traditions that records the landing and settling of eastern Sri Lanka is called Mattakallappu Manmiam (Tamil:‡ÆÆ‡Æü‡Øç‡Æü‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡Æ≥‡Æ™‡Øç‡Æ™‡ØÅ ‡ÆÆ‡Ææ‡Æ©‡Øç‡ÆÆ‡Æø‡ÆØ‡ÆÆ‡Øç).Subramaniam, Folk traditionas and Songs..., p.20 Local sources Mattakallappu Manmiyam in reality is the story from a Mukkuva perspective of their settlement of Batticaloa District, although not all Tamils of the east are Mukkuvas. It also explains etymology of place names from a Mukkuva perspective and combines legends with historical facts. From the study of the language used, it is evident that it is a compilation of works written by number of authors over a long period of time. According Manmiam Mukkuvars came from the Pandya Kingdom in present days Tamil Nadu state in India. After arriving in the east they had established seven nuclear villages. Once established they came into conflict with another fishing related caste called Thimilar. Thimilar are found in the east as well as the north of the country. Their primary settlement was called Thimilathivu, where according to Manmiam there was a fort. They also had settled in a lucrative fishing settlement called Valaikattiravu where the place where Thimilar caught large amounts of fish using fishing nets. (Valai(‡Æµ‡Æ≤‡Øà) in Tamil) means a net). Manmiam narrates that how Fishing related conflicts eventually became a mini holocaust for the Thimilar.Subramaniam, Folk traditionas and Songs..., p.3 With the help of another group of people who came to Batticaloa from India called Pattaniar who are believed to be Muslim traders from South India, for business they defeated the Thimilar and chased them away to Verugal which is a boundary village of between Batticaloa and Trincomalee districts. The name of some villages are seemed to be the monuments of this war. A village near the modern Batticaloa town called Sathurukondan which in Tamil means a place where enemies were killed. A place where the warriors who chased after the retreating Thimilar came back with victory and met together called Santhiwelli. A place where warriors rested and celebrated the victory was called Vanthaarumoolai where the Eastern University of Sri Lanka is located today.Subramaniam, Folk traditionas and Songs..., p.4 The place where the Mukkuvar settled the Muslims who assisted them to prevent the Thimilar from returning is called Eravoor (derived from Erathu= prevent re-immigrant Oor=place or village) which is today a Muslim majority town within the Batticalo district. Present-day Distribution of Sri Lankan Tamils throughout the Island including the eastern province in Trincomalee (34.3%), Batticaloa (70.8)and Ampara districts (18.4%) Other social groups such as Vellalar have their own caste legends as to how they came to settle the east. Vellalar consider themselves to be the descendants of soldiers of Kalinga MaghaKartithigesu, Sri Lankan Tamil society and politics, p.6(reigned 1215 - 1236), who invaded Sri Lanka. Curiously he was also considered to be instrumental in creating the Jaffna Kingdom in the North according to Yalpana Vaipava Malai and other scholars.de Silva, A History of Sri Lanka, p.132 Magha was an invader from present day Orissa state in India who recruited his soldiers from South India. His invasion is credited by Sri Lankan literature as one of the main causes for the failure of the classical Sinhala Dry Zone civilisations.Geiger, Culavamsa, Chapter LXXX, p.54-58 Other social group called Seerpadar have been a minority, their conservative worldview has prevailed among the Vellala and similar castes. Multiple origins From traditional and legendary sources, it can be ascertained that the immigrants who created the first Tamil settlements in Sri Lanka in general and the east in particular appear to have come not just from the Tamil Nadu region of south India, but from the Kerala coast as well.Sri Lanka - Kerala linkSubramaniam, Folk traditionas and Songs..., p.11 See also * Batticaloa Territory * Mattakallappu Manmiyam Notes References   * External links *Community portal for Batticaloa * Sri Lankan Tamil society and politics Web version of the book by Prof. Sivathamby Karthigesu *Culavamsa Web version of book by William Geiger Category:Tamils of Sri Lanka ","title":"History of Eastern Tamils"},{"id":"13031592","text":"Hermelinghen is a commune in the Pas-de-Calais department in the Hauts-de- France region of France.

It is one of oldest buildings and one of the few surviving examples of Gothic architecture in the city. It is located at ulica Przyrynek 2. History St. Mary's Church stands on the site of an ancient pagan place of worship. The church's foundation stone was laid by Janusz I the Old, Duke of Masovia and his wife, Danutƒó of Lithuania, in 1409. The church was consecrated in 1411. It has been modified, demolished and rebuilt several times. Originally it had one nave, was made of bricks, had a ceiling and an arch presbytery, before the end of the 15th century it was transformed into a three nave basilica. The church's most striking characteristic is the tower, built in 1518. It is recognizable from a great distance and is depicted in the oldest images of Warsaw. During World War II, the church was severely damaged by German forces - the roof of the nave collapsed and the upper portion of the tower was blown up. It was reconstructed in 1947-1966 to the design by Beata Tryli≈Ñska. Behind the church is small park with a set of steps that lead down to the Vistula and the so named Ko≈õciuszko banks of the river.

It was first published by Collins publishers in 1951. The book was published under the title Skating Shoes in the US, also in 1951.BBC h2g2: The 'Shoes' Books White Boots tells the story of a poor girl and a rich girl who meet as a result of ice skating and is the tale of their unlikely friendship.White Boots at the White Gauntlet Noel Streatfeild site  Plot summary  Harriet Johnson has been ill and her doctor arranges for her to take up ice skating in order to build strength in her legs. When she gets to the rink Harriet meets Lalla Moore, a young skater who has been training since she was three years old; Lalla's parents were killed in a skating accident, and her Aunt Claudia is determined that Lalla will be the greatest figure skater in the world. Harriet and Lalla soon become friends and as Harriet is still not well enough for school, it is arranged that she will share Lalla's governess and her various dance and fencing lessons. Harriet soon shows herself to be a talented skater, and she starts to take, and pass, the same skating tests that Lalla does. Lalla, on the other hand, is much more of a performer than a figure skater and starts to have trouble with various figures she needs to learn for tests. Lalla becomes jealous of Harriet and tells her that if she takes and passes her next skating test, Lalla will tell her aunt that she does not want Harriet to have lessons with her any more. Distraught, Harriet pretends to once again be ill while she decides what to do. But when Lalla hears that Harriet is seriously ill, she faints and later explains how nervous, miserable and guilty she feels. Lalla and Harriet go for a holiday together with their families and they talk about their futures. Lalla's coach tells her that she will never be a good enough figure skater to succeed in competitions, but that she could be a fantastic show skater and performer; whereas Harriet has potential to be a great skater one day, as she is better at the figures required to do well.

In 1916, his brother John emigrated to Dunedin and joined the company, and the partnership was formed as a limited liability company, and from 1919 was called the Fletcher Construction Company. In 1940, the company was renamed Fletcher Holdings. Fletcher moved the businesses headquarters to Auckland in 1925. The company grew despite the difficult economic conditions, completing a number of major construction projects, such as the Chateau Tongariro and Dominion Museum in 1929. Following the election of the First Labour Government in 1935, Fletcher established an enduring friendship with the government. Fletchers' built some of the first state houses in New Zealand.

While the technology and related platforms are legal in many jurisdictions, law enforcement and prosecutorial agencies are attempting to address this avenue of copyright infringement. Notably, the use of BitTorrent in connection with copyrighted material may make the issuers of the BitTorrent file, link or metadata liable as an infringing party under some copyright laws.Note, 40 Colum. J.L. & Soc. Probs. 1 (2006‚Äì2007) Secondary Liability for Copyright Infringement: BitTorrent as a Vehicle for Establishing a New Copyright Definition for Staple Articles of Commerce; Helton, Matthew. Heinonline.org. Retrieved on 11 May 2013. Similarly, the use of BitTorrent to procure illegal materials could potentially create liability for end users as an accomplice. BitTorrent files can be seen conceptually as a hyperlink. However, it can also be a very specific instruction for how to obtain content on the internet. BitTorrent may transmit or include illegal or copyrighted content. Court decisions in various jurisdictions have deemed some BitTorrent files illegal. Complicating the legal analysis are jurisdictional issues that are common when nation states attempt to regulate any activity. BitTorrent files and links can be accessed in different geographic locations and legal jurisdictions. Thus, it is possible to host a BitTorrent file in geographic jurisdictions where it is legal and others where it is illegal. A single link, file or data or download action may be actionable in some places, but not in others. This analysis applies to other sharing technologies and platforms.  Jurisdictional variations  Legal regimes vary from country to country. BitTorrent metafiles do not store copyrighted data and are ordinarily unobjectionable. Some accused parties argued that BitTorrent trackers are legal even if sharing the copyrighted data in question was a copyright violation. Despite these arguments, there has been tremendous legal pressure, usually on behalf of the MPAA, RIAA and similar organizations around the world, to shut down BitTorrent trackers. Finland: Finreactor In December 2004, Finnish police raided Finreactor, a major BitTorrent site. Seven system administrators and four others were ordered to pay hundreds of thousands of euros in damages. The defendants appealed the case all the way to the Supreme Court of Finland, but failed to overturn the verdict. Two other defendants were acquitted because they were underage at the time, but were held liable for legal fees and compensation for illegal distribution ranging up to 60,000 euros. The court set their fine at 10% of the retail price of products distributed. Hong Kong: individual actions On 24 October 2005, BitTorrent user Chan Nai-ming (Èô≥‰πÉÊòé), using the handle Âè§ÊÉëÂ§©Áöá (The Master of Cunning, although the magistrate referred to him as Big Crook) was convicted of violating copyright by uploading Daredevil, Red Planet and Miss Congeniality to a newsgroup (Chapter 528 of Hong Kong law). The magistrate remarked that Chan's act significantly damaged the interest of copyright holders. He was released on bail for HK$5,000, awaiting a sentencing hearing, though the magistrate himself admitted the difficulty of determining how he should be sentenced due to the lack of precedent. On 7 November 2005 he was sentenced to jail for three months, but was immediately granted bail pending an appeal. The appeal was dismissed by the Court of First Instance on 12 December 2006 and Chan was immediately jailed. On 3 January 2007, he was released pending appeal to the Court of Final Appeal on 9 May 2007. In 2008 and 2009, an unidentified woman and man were arrested for illegally uploading files with BitTorrent in September 2008 and April 2009, respectively. Singapore: Odex actions against users Anime distributor Odex actively took down and sent legal threats against individual BitTorrent users in Singapore beginning in 2007. These Internet users allegedly downloaded fansubbed anime via BitTorrent. Court orders required ISPs to reveal subscribers' personal information. This led to cease-and-desist letters from Odex to users that led to out-of-court settlements for at least S$3,000 (US$2,000) per person. One person who received such a letter was 9 years old.\\"Parents get shock letter \\", Liew Hanqing, The New Paper, 2 August 2007Kicking kids for profit? , Michael Tan, CNet Asia, 16 August 2007 These actions were considered controversial by the local anime community and attracted criticism, as they were seen by fans as heavy-handed.Anime firm boss gets online death threats , Chua Hian Hou, The Straits Times, 16 August 2007, p. 4 Slovenia: Suprnova In December 2004, Suprnova.org, a popular early BitTorrent site, closed purportedly due to the pressure felt by Andre Preston, aka Sloncek, the site's founder and administrator. In December 2005, Sloncek revealed that the Suprnova computer servers had been confiscated by Slovenian authorities. Sweden: Pirate Bay The Pirate Bay torrent website, formed by a Swedish anti-copyright group, is notorious for the \\"legal threats\\" section of its website in which letters and replies on the subject of alleged copyright infringements are publicly displayed. On 31 May 2006, their servers in Sweden were raided by Swedish police on allegations by the MPAA of copyright infringement. The site was back online in less than 72 hours, and returned to Sweden, accompanied by public and media backlash against the government's actions. Steal This Film, was made to cover these incidents.Steal This Film (Stockholm, Summer 2006) website. Retrieved 22 April 2007. On 17 April 2009, as a result of the trial following the raid, the site's four co-founders were sentenced to one year of jail time each and to collectively pay 30 million SEK in damages. All the defendants appealed the decision, although two later served their sentences. In 2012, to minimize legal exposure and save computer resources, The Pirate Bay entirely switched to providing plaintext magnet links instead of traditional torrent files. As the most popular and well-known facilitator of copyright infringement, The Pirate Bay continues to shift between different hosting facilities and domain registrars in the face of legal prosecution and shutdown threats. Telenor was recently forced to ban the DNS of TPB (although other cloud based clones still are available). United States: 2003‚Äìpresent Soon after the closure of Suprnova, civil and criminal legal actions in the United States began to increase. MPAA cease and desist messages In 2003, the Motion Picture Association of America began to send cease and desist messages to BitTorrent sites, leading to the shutdown of Torrentse and Sharelive in July of 2003. LokiTorrent In 2005, Edward Webber (known as \\"lowkee\\"), webmaster of LokiTorrent, was ordered by a U.S. court to pay a fine and supply the MPAA with server logs (including the IP addresses of visitors). Webber began a fundraising campaign to pay legal fees for actions brought by the MPAA. Webber raised approximately US$45,000 through a PayPal-based donation system. Following the agreement, the MPAA changed the LokiTorrent website to display a message intended to discourage filesharers from downloading illegal content. EliteTorrents On 25 May 2005, the popular BitTorrent website EliteTorrents.org was shut down by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Ten search warrants relating to members of the website were executed. Six site administrators pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit criminal copyright infringement and criminal copyright infringement of a pre- commercial release work. Punishments included jail time, house arrest and fines. Jail sentences were issued to some defendants violations of criminal law, the Family Entertainment and Copyright Act.EliteTorrents Admin gets 18 month sentence. Afterdawn.com (10 September 2008).

TorrentSpy On 29 May 2007, a U.S. federal judge ordered TorrentSpy to begin monitoring its users' activities and to submit logs to MPAA. TorrentSpy ultimately removed access for US visitors rather than operate in an \\"uncertain legal environment.\\" In the face of destruction of evidence charges and a $111 million legal judgement, TorrentSpy voluntarily shut down and filed for bankruptcy in 2008, although appeals continued through 2009. isoHunt On 21 December 2009 a federal district court found the founder of isoHunt guilty of inducing copyright infringement. The ruling was upheld on appeal in Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. v. Fung in March 2013 and the site finally shut down in October 2013. Copyright holder actions Copyright owners have undertaken a variety of tactics and strategies to try to curtail BitTorrent transmittal of their intellectual property. In 2005 HBO began \\"poisoning\\" torrents of its show Rome, by providing bad chunks of data to clients. In 2007 HBO sent cease and desist letters to the Internet Service Providers of BitTorrent users. Many users reported receiving letters from their ISP's that threatened to cut off their internet service if the alleged infringement continued. HBO, unlike the RIAA, has not been reported to have filed suit over file sharing as of April 2007. Beginning in early 2010, the US Copyright Group, acting on behalf of several independent movie makers, has obtained the IP addresses of BitTorrent users illegally downloading specific movies. The group then sued these users, in order to obtain subpoenas forcing ISPs to reveal the users' true identities. The group then sent out settlement offers in the $1,000‚Äì$3,000 range. About 16,200 lawsuits were filed between March and September 2010. In 2011, United States courts began determining the legality of suits brought against hundreds or thousands of BitTorrent users. Nearly simultaneously, a suit against 5,000 IP addresses was dismissed. A smaller suit, Pacific Century International, Ltd. v. Does against 100 ISPs, has also been dismissed.

Other notable search engines also voluntarily self-censored licensed content from their results, or became \\"content distribution\\"-only search engines. Mininova, announced that it would only allow freely licensed content (especially free content distributed by its author under a Creative Commons license) to be indexed after November 2009, resulting in the immediate removal of a majority of Mininova's search.  Infringement's sales impact  Some commentators have suggested that copyright violation through BitTorrent need not mean a loss of sales. In addition, the Game of Thrones director, HBO programming president and Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes spoke about the positive effects of file sharing. Bewkes further commented that he did not consider the unauthorized distribution to result in the loss of HBO subscriptions, rather: \\"Our experience is, it all leads to more penetration, more paying subs and more health for HBO.\\" The show is the most infringed TV show, and \\"the show's first season was the best-selling TV DVD of 2012.

She was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Early life and education Louisa Lula Greene was born in Kanesville, Iowa, to Evan M. Greene (a son of John P. Greene) and Susan Kent. Lula was the eighth of their thirteen children. She was born during an outbreak of cholera. Throughout her life, she was a member of the LDS Church. Both of her grandmothers were sisters to LDS Church president Brigham Young. Her family moved to Kanesville in 1846. In 1852, they moved to Salt Lake City, Utah Territory, after Young evacuated Kanesville. Greened later lived in Provo, and her family moved to Grantsville in 1859, and they moved again to and Smithfield in 1864. Greene began writing poetry as a young girl and there is evidence that she wrote poetry at age fourteen. From 1868 to 1869, Greene attended a private school in Salt Lake City. When Greene was 18, she and her sister began a small school in Cache County, Utah; however, Greene lacked patience with her students and did not have formal training. In 1869, she returned to school at the University of Deseret in Salt Lake City. Career In 1869, Greene was the editor of the Smithfield Sunday School Gazette, a small periodical issued to individuals who attended the LDS Church Sunday School in Smithfield for six issues from October to November. However, in 1871, she was required to return to Smithfield due to a family illness. Lacking the money she needed for the trip, Greene submitted a poem to the Salt Lake Daily Herald and asked editor Edward L. Sloan to buy it for $7.50, which was the amount of money she needed to return home. Sloan agreed, and her poem \\"Tired Out\\" was published on the front page of the Daily Herald. Sloan soon contacted Greene in 1872 and asked her if she would be interested in being the editor of a newspaper for Latter-day Saint women called Woman's Exponent. Greene conferred with general Relief Society president Eliza R. Snow, and after receiving her blessing and the approval of Brigham Young, Greene accepted Sloan's offer. In 1872, Women's Exponent began publication in Salt Lake City with Greene as editor. Her name was printed as \\"L. L. Greene\\" in the first issue, but due to letters to the editor that assumed she was male, she changed her name to \\"Louise L. Greene\\" in subsequent issues. Greene edited the periodical until she was succeeded in 1877 by Emmeline B. Wells, who edited until Women's Exponent was discontinued in 1914. Greene requested to leave her position there due to responsibilities at home and to her family. However, she continued to contribute to the Exponent and other church publications. In 1873, Greene married Levi Willard Richards, the son of Levi Richards and a nephew of church leader Willard Richards. Levi served in many positions in the LDS Church, including as a member of the general board of the Sunday School and as a patriarch. Lula and Levi had seven children, four of whom lived to adulthood. One of their children was the artist Lee Greene Richards.Andrew Jenson. Latter-day Saint Biographical Encyclopedia, vol. 3, p. 703. In 1883, Louisa Richards became an editor with the Juvenile Instructor, an LDS periodical edited by George Q. Cannon. She wrote and edited the column \\"Our Little Folks\\" until 1907, when it was discontinued. Richards wrote poetry, and her poems appeared in Woman‚Äôs Exponent, Juvenile Instructor, Improvement Era, Young Woman's Journal, Children‚Äôs Friend, and Relief Society Magazine. Later life Her husband, Levi, took a plural wife, Persis Louisa Young, who was Greene's niece. They were married on the eleventh anniversary of Lula and Levi's wedding. Persis stayed at the Richards' household and helped with chores. Levi died in 1914. Richards continued to be an active member of the LDS Church. She helped with the Young Ladies' Mutual Improvement Association and the Relief Society. She was also called by the church to be a member of the General Board of the Primary, a position she held for twenty-five years. She worked in the Salt Lake Temple from its dedication in 1893 until 1934. She continued writing until her death. Richards died on September 9, 1944, in Salt Lake City.

It has two wheels that allow it to rotate and spin, as well as two bands of colored LED light running around its edge and cup-like \\"wings\\" (or \\"arms\\" according to the Sony sonystyle USA website) which can open and close on either end, all of which can be synchronized to the music being played. Rolly has several operating modes, including Bluetooth functionality. Rolly can play music streamed directly from any Bluetooth-enabled cell phone, computer, or mp3 player. Rolly is able to dance along to streaming music, but the Rolly Choreographer software produces far better results when it analyzes tracks and creates motion files before loading them onto Rolly. The Rolly player uses .mtf files to store motion data along with a particular music track. Pre-made motion files can be downloaded and uploaded from Rolly Go. Rolly also has a G force sensor (accelerometer) which detects if the player is laying horizontally or being held upright. When held upright, the track next/previous can be controlled by the top wheel and volume up/down can be controlled by the bottom wheel. Tracks can be shuffled by holding the unit upright, pressing the button once, then shaking the unit up and down (light color changes to purple). You can return to continuous play (light color blue) by simply repeating this process.

Their basic constitutional right to worship has been reinforced by decades of court decisions and more recently by the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act. However, several of these court rulings have also set limitations on these rights when prisoner demands are seen to impede prison safety and function.  Organizations and programs  While inmates often worship as individuals they also frequently do so within the structure provided by the programs of religious groups and denominations tending to the incarcerated. Nearly all correctional facilities provide support for at least the Abrahamic religions: Christianity, Islam and Judaism. Chaplains, volunteers and other representatives of these groups may organize religious services as often as daily in large prisons, while also providing pastoral care to inmates and staff.Dammer, Harry R. (2006) \\"Religion in prison.\\" In Encyclopedia of American Prisons, edited by Marylin D. McShane and Frank P. Williams III. New York: Garland Publishing. pg. 400  Contemplative programs  Some U.S. prisons offer contemplative programs for inmates and staff, which may include meditation, yoga or contemplative prayer. While these programs are sometimes secular they are also frequently sponsored by religious organizations and interfaith groups. Such programs have an established history. In the 19th century Quaker ideas, were co-opted by Pennsylvania prisons which had inmates meditate upon their crimes as a key component of rehabilitation.Sutherland, Edwin H. and Cressey, Donald Ray and Luckenbill, David F. (1992) Principles of Criminology pp.502-503Knapp, Samuel Lorenzo (1834) The Life of Thomas Eddy pp.71-72 direct page view In the 1970s organizations such as the Prison-Ashram Project and SYDA Foundation began programs to offer meditation or yoga instruction to inmates.Brooks, Douglas Renfrew (2000) Meditation Revolution: A History and Theology of the Siddha Yoga Lineage pp.109, 154 In subsequent years more religious groups have begun meditation programs, such as the Prison Dharma Network in 1989. Modern meditation programs are thought to help inmates deal with the stress of confinement.Bartollas, Clemens (1985) Correctional Treatment: Theory and Practice p.141 One recent study has suggested that such programs help to reduce a host of undesirable and unhealthy behaviors, like drug use, violence and risk taking.Murty, Komanduri and Owens, Angela and Vyas, Ashwin (2004) Voices from Prison: An Ethnographic Study of Black Male Prisoners p.237 Not all prisons allow contemplative programs, leading some to use religious freedom provisions as a way to gain access to the programs.Queen, Christopher S. (2000) Engaged Buddhism in the West pp.355-357 For instance, court actions recognizing Zen Buddhism as an \\"acceptable religion\\" have secured meditation programs in New York prisons.  Traditions  Catholicism Saint Dismas Prison Ministry was founded in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 2000 to offer spiritual services for Catholic prisoners in the United States. The president is George Williams, a priest. It was named after Dismas, the repentant thief. The ministry was founded in 2000 by Ron Zeilinger who found no \\"Catholic organization of a national scope providing Catholic materials‚Äù. The ministry distributes bibles to prisoners. In 2006, Scott Jensen chose to remain on the ministry board after he was forced to leave the Wisconsin State Assembly following a felony conviction that was later overturned.  Islam  In addition to immigration, the state, federal and local prisons of the United States contribute to the growth of Islam in the country.SpearIt. ‚ÄúAmerican Prisons: A Critical Primer on Culture and Conversion to Islam,‚Äù (First Edition Design Publishing 2017). According to the then Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Harley G. Lappin, not counting members of the Nation of Islam, there were 9,600 Muslim inmates in federal prisons in 2003.United State Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Testimony of Mr. Harly G. Lappin, Director, Federal Bureau of Prisons, October 14, 2003 However, J. Michael Waller claims that roughly 80% of the prisoners who find faith while in prison convert to Islam and that these converts made up 17‚Äì20% (around 350,000) of the total (state and federal) prison population, in 2003.United State Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Testimony of Dr. J. Michael Waller October 12, 2003  Neopaganism  There are a variety of Neopagan practitioners in the prison population many of whom are served by a variety of prison outreach programs. Mattias Gardell indicates that \\"a pagan revival among the white prison population, including the conversion of whole prison gangs to the ancestral religion.\\".Gardell (2003), p. 217 In 2001 there were prison groups associated with Wotansvolk in all states of the nation supporting more than 5000 prisoners. The women's group Sigrdrifa, which has chapters in the United States and Canada, also runs a \\"Odinism in Prison\\" project, while the Odinic Rite and the √Åsatr√∫ Alliance have prisoner outreach programs as well. The ability of Neopagans to practice their religion in U.S. prisons has been shaped by the outcome of two significant court cases. In 1985, Virginia prisoner Herbert Daniel Dettmer sued Robert Landon, the Director of the Virginia Department of Corrections, in federal court to get access to objects he claimed were necessary for his Wiccan religious practice. The district court for the Eastern District of Virginia decided in Dettmer's favor, although on appeal, in Dettmer v. Landon the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruled that while Wicca was a religion, it was not a violation of the First Amendment to keep a religious practitioner from accessing ritual objects. In 2005 Cutter v. Wilkinson came down on the side of at least three Neopagan prison inmates protesting the denial of access to ceremonial items and opportunities for group worship. Yet in their decision the court reinforced the notion that \\"should inmate requests for religious accommodations become excessive, impose unjustified burdens on other institutionalized persons, or jeopardize an institution's effective functioning, the facility would be free to resist the imposition.\\"  Relevant court cases  *1964 - Cooper v.

By March 2015, the Turkish lira began losing heavy value towards the US dollar, trading at ‚Ç∫2.68 to US$1. The sudden decline caused the Central Bank of Turkey to make a written intervention, with the opposition criticising President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan for intervening in economic affairs despite his neutral and ceremonial role. The economy was seen as so fragile due to the political uncertainty that a single speech by Erdoƒüan caused the lira to rapidly lose its value against the dollar soon after. Investors were also concerned about the future of Deputy Prime Minister Ali Babacan, who holds responsibility for the Economy. Despite the economic slowdown, ≈ûim≈üek claimed that there would be a high chance that the lira would regain its value and that inflation would fall at a fast rate in 2016. With key Islamists in government, such as Numan Kurtulmu≈ü, openly critical about the independence of the Central Bank, ≈ûim≈üek claimed that the uncertainty caused by the potential of politicising the Central Bank meant that Turkey was unlikely to return to strong economic growth in the near future. ≈ûim≈üek has since defended his record as Finance Minister, stating that his government was being unfairly targeted despite managing to keep its budget commitments under heavy economic pressures. Poverty reduction In May 2015, ≈ûim≈üek was ridiculed for tweeting that his government had reduced poverty, as well as including a statistic that showed that the percentage of the population living below $1 a day fell from 0.2% to 0% between 2002 and 2013. The tweet generated huge controversy, with replies asking whether his Twitter account had been hacked.http://www.hbrdr.com/gundem/mehmet-simsek-ten- akil-almaz-istatistik-paylasimi-h4042331.html June 2015 general election In the run-up to the June 2015 general election, ≈ûim≈üek stated that populism by opposition parties would be the most significant threat to Turkey's economy, stating that the Republican People's Party's policy of increasing the minimum wage to ‚Ç∫1,500 would be devastating to workers, alleging that the extra cost of hiring workers would lead to unemployment. Commenting on other policies in the Republican People's Party (CHP) manifesto, ≈ûim≈üek claimed that if the party could name a source for all their spending plans, he would vote for them. The CHP subsequently gave the numerous government corruption scandals, the lavish spending on a new Presidential Palace and government waste as their funding. In the run up to the election, ≈ûim≈üek ordered the release of ‚Ç∫1.325 billion of allowances to farmers and manufacturers.

History Viva Air, whose complete name in Spanish was Vuelos Internacionales de Vacaciones (International Vacation Flights,) was founded on 24 February 1988 by Iberia and Lufthansa. Operations began with a320 aircraft. At the beginning flights were mostly from Germany to Spain, in particular to Palma de Mallorca. By 1992, the partnership between Lufthansa and Iberia dissolved and Iberia took over the operations of Viva Air. Shortly thereafter, Viva Air entered the Spanish domestic scheduled market using Douglas DC-9 aircraft but those were quickly replaced by the Boeing 737-300.Viva Air Fleet The airline's aircraft stood out with their simple and colourful Joan Mir√≥- style livery created by Spanish school children. It was intended to symbolise the Spanish sunshine which most of its passengers sought during their holidays. After the first few years of operation, the airline was one of the first subsidiary airlines of a major carrier (in this case IBERIA) to gain a foothold into London's Heathrow Airport from where Viva operated several scheduled services on behalf of its parent company using Viva callsigns and Viva flight numbers. Since the scheduled flights were losing money, Iberia took over those routes and Viva Air was relegated to charter flights using Boeing 737-300 aircraft of which it had 10 in service by 1995. Owing to heavy competition from other Spanish and European charter companies, Viva Air began to lose money and, by 1999, operations ceased and the airline was liquidated.

Plot It is night. A police car pulls over near a van with a flat tire on a desolate highway, where two young men are changing the tire. The police officers step out of the patrol car and offer their help. Suddenly, a third person gets out of the van. One of the officers reacts instantly - this man is a well known criminal, he understands he is recognized. He has also robbed a military camp ten minutes ago, and the van is loaded with explosives and assault rifles. The situation is tense. Later on, the two police officers are found shot dead in a way that looks like an execution. Martin Beck is working on the case and gets all resources he needs to get the unknown murderers. A hunt that gets complicated, because Martin's partner, Gunvald Larsson, was a close friend to one of the killed police officers and he is literally ready to use any methods to find the killer...

In December 1842, Ballantyne became a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, being baptized in the Firth of Forth at Leith. In 1843 he and a number of his family members emigrated to Nauvoo, Illinois, where the majority of the Latter Day Saints were gathering. On February 17, 1847, Ballantyne married Hulda Meriah Clark, and they emigrated to Utah Territory in 1848 with the Mormon pioneers. While living in Salt Lake City, Ballantyne asked for permission from his bishop to establish a Sunday school for some of the Latter-day Saint children. Having been granted permission, he held the first Church Sunday School meeting in his home on December 9, 1849.Alward, Benjamin B.

WZSK is owned and operated by New Millennium Communications Group, Inc. 1040 AM is a United States clear-channel frequency, on which WHO is the dominant Class A station. WZSK must leave the air during nighttime hours in order to prevent interference to the skywave signal of WHO. History Beginnings The groundwork for WZSK was first laid in 1962. Known then as WWDS, founders Dennis and Willard Sleighter first applied for its construction permit in November 1962. The station first operated at an FCC assigned frequency of 1050 kHz, with a maximum output power of 250 watts. The station went on the air March 25, 1963 from its longtime facilities along East First Avenue and Juaniata Street in Everett. In August 1964, the Sleighters applied for a construction permit to move WWDS's dial position from 1050 kHz to 1110 kHz and increase its power to 5,000 watts. The FCC denied the permit in March of 1967. Shortly after, the Sleighters sold the station to the Bakner family, who would control the station over the next three decades. Sale to Bakner Family Melvin Bakner, known by his on-air name \\"Shorty King\\", formed Radio Everett, Inc. and acquired WSKE in July 1967. The call letters were changed to WSKE in November of that same year. Under Bakner's direction, the station boasted a country format, which became popular with local listeners. In 1979, WSKE applied for a power increase to 1,000 watts and installed a directional antenna system. Bakner's son Martin, also began working at the station as a teenager and would remain there until its sale in 2002. WSKE petitioned for a frequency change again in the 1980s, and was granted a move its present dial position of 1040 kHz and a power increase to 10,000 watts daytime and 4,000 watts, critical hours. On April 27, 1987, Radio Everett, Inc. successfully applied for an FM license at 104.3 mHz. That station became known as WSKE-FM and became a full simulcast of its then-same-named AM sister. The station allowed Everett to have local radio service after WSKE was required to sign off after local sunset. The FM broadcast 18 hours a day at that time. Sale to Millenium Broadcasting The stations were sold to its present owner in 2002.

He began his career with hometown club Wigan Athletic, earning a good reputation as a goalscorer from a young age and securing a move to First Division club Everton, being loaned back to Wigan until the end of the season. He later joined Aston Villa for a club record fee of ¬£315,000, helping the club back to the top tier of English football, before signing for Portsmouth for another club record fee. He made over 150 appearances in all competitions for Pompey, before moving to Bournemouth after a loan spell at the club and Swansea City. He later played for Carlisle, aiding the club's promotion cause and helping them win the Football League Trophy. He also played for Brentford, Colchester United and Brighton & Hove Albion. He retired from playing through an ankle injury in 2000. After his retirement from the game, his alcoholism and gambling addiction brought him to the brink of suicide after losing ¬£1 million that he had earned during his career. Following his recovery after checking into the Sporting Chance clinic, Aspinall became an advocate for the Samaritans, fronting their \\"Men on the Ropes\\" campaign and has talked openly about his alcohol and gambling problems to aid other males in similar situations. Career Born in Wigan, Aspinall began his career as a 13-year-old apprentice with hometown club Wigan Athletic. He signed a professional contract at the age of 17 and made his debut in March 1985 in an away game against Leyton Orient. He made 33 league appearances and scored ten goals for Wigan, before being sold to Everton in 1986 for ¬£150,000. He was immediately loaned back to Wigan, scoring a further 12 goals in 18 league appearances. With Wigan's season completed, Aspinall returned to Everton, where he came on as a substitute for Gary Lineker in a 3‚Äì1 victory. After making only ten substitute appearances in all competitions for the Toffees, Aspinall transferred to Aston Villa for a then club record fee of ¬£300,000, but could not help stop the club being relegated from the First Division. Manager Billy McNeill, who signed Aspinall, was sacked and replaced by Graham Taylor, as Villa bounced back immediately to the First Division, with Aspinall finishing as joint-top scorer. However, a poor disciplinary record prompted a warning from Taylor that this must improve or he would be sold. An incident away to St Mirren in a pre-season friendly involved Aspinall stamping on an opponents foot led to him being sold to Portsmouth for a club-record fee of ¬£315,000 in August 1988. He played in 44 league games and scored 14 goals for Aston Villa. In five years at Fratton Park, Aspinall made over 150 appearances in all competitions, scoring 28 goals, and under Jim Smith helped the club reach the 1992 FA Cup semi-final, going out on penalties before Aspinall could take his kick. The team also narrowly missed out on promotion to the Premier League, but missed out by two goals. After loan spells at Bournemouth and Swansea City, playing six games for each club and scoring only once for Bournemouth, he was sold to Bournemouth for ¬£20,000 in December 1993. With limited chances at Bournemouth, scoring eight goals in 28 league games, Aspinall signed for Carlisle United on a free transfer. Making 132 appearances and scoring 16 goals, he helped the club to promotion and won the Football League Trophy. In 1997, he joined Brentford for ¬£50,000, citing wanting to move back to the south of England as his reasons for leaving Carlisle. He was later loaned out to Colchester United after scoring just five league goals in 43 appearances for the Bees. He signed permanently for Colchester in March 1999, and was made captain of the team in the summer of 1999. However, he was later loaned to Brighton in September 1999, with the move being made permanent in November of the same year. It was with Brighton that Aspinall was forced to retire from playing early through injury, after suffering from a long-term ankle problem. Aspinall had contracted MRSA following an operation on his ankle that went wrong, spending 27 days in hospital as a result. Life outside football After leaving the game, Aspinall turned to drink and picked up a gambling addiction. His gambling cost him around ¬£1 million that he had earned during his long career. On the verge of suicide, after narrowly avoiding death by train, saved only by last minute thoughts of his family, he checked himself into the Sporting Chance clinic. He has fronted a Samaritans campaign, \\"Men on the Ropes\\", that aims to reduce male suicides. In 2009 Aspinall was working in a Sainsbury's distribution centre in Basingstoke and scouting for League Two side Port Vale under manager Micky Adams. By 2015 he was working for radio station BBC Sussex as a summariser for Brighton & Hove Albion matches.

Biography The band was formed in 1995 and started first playing power metal under the name Guardian Force. Over the years, the group has gone through changes and the band started to take its current form in 2001, when Lari Sorvo (keyboards) and Lauri Koskenniemi (guitar) joined the founding members Mikael Gr√∂nroos (guitar), Max Obstbaum (vocals) and Gustaf Standertskj√∂ld (drums) with the bassist Eerik Purdon. Now that the band performs and records under the name Crystal Blaze, the musical genre has also changed. The group is not afraid of combining different styles and genres with metal. Crystal Blaze's first demo Dreams was published in 2004 and was recorded at the MusaMuusa studios. The second demo The Punishment was released in 2006. In 2007, Crystal Blaze parted ways with one of the founding members of the band, drummer Gustaf Standertskj√∂ld. Crystal Blaze was the winner of 2007 Wacken Metal Battle Finland and also performed at Wacken Open Air 2007 festival in Germany.

Appearance The Panzerwurfmine's appearance owed much to the Panzerfaust (specifically its warhead), which was of similar construction and operation. The major difference was that the PWM had a tube attached to the charge, running behind it, with some form of stabilising fins or canvas attached to the rear of the tube. Premise For any high-explosive anti-tank mine or grenade to be effective against armour, it must sit squarely on to the armour, so that the high-velocity jet of metal punches through the armour at a ninety degree angle. A way of making sure this happens is to place the charge onto the armour by hand. However, this puts the participant into grave danger from defensive fire from the tank and other enemies. A thrown version would be more versatile, but it would be hard to ensure the ninety degree angle. The Panzerwurfmine is designed to achieve the stable flight needed by the deployment of large fins or canvas lengths at the back of the design, to stabilise the trajectory of the grenade and therefore make a ninety degree angle contact more likely. When the PWM hits the armour, the shaped charge is activated. However, in combat use the Panzerwurfmine often did not live up to expectations, due to the relatively short range it could be thrown, and also the relative lack of clean ninety degree impacts, decreasing its effectiveness. Versions The first version of the Panzerwurfmine was the Panzerwurfmine Lang (\\"long\\"). This weighed 1.36kg, and had a total length of 53.3 cm. It was stabilised by fins at the rear of the tube, that sprang out when the device was thrown. It was first introduced in May 1943, with 203,800 produced in that year. It was discontinued in favour of the Panzerwurfmine Kurz (\\"short\\"), which was stabilised by a canvas strip that rolled out when the device was thrown, and was also shorter. Both designs had warheads with a diameter of 11.4cm, carrying a shaped charge of 500g that could penetrate approximately 150mm of RHA at zero degrees.

Synopsis It is a member of the class of compounds known as auxins and a chlorinated analogue of the more common indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) auxin. 4-Cl-IAA is found in the seeds of a variety of plants, particularly legumes such as peas and broad beans. In one study it is written that the substance is \\"mainly found in reproductive structures\\" and \\"is thought to be restricted to members of the leguminous tribe Fabeae, specifically \\"the genera Vicia, Pisum, Lathyrus, Lens, and Vavilovia\\". In Pisum sativum, 4-Cl-IAA biosynthesis diverges from IAA biosynthesis when the amino acid tryptophan is chlorinated to form 4-chlorotryptophan (4-Cl-Trp); the biosynthesis of 4-Cl-IAA then precedes parallel to that of IAA. Engvild hypothesized in 1996 that 4-Cl-IAA may be a \\"death hormone\\" that maturing seeds use to trigger death of the parent plant by mobilizing nutrients to be stored in the seed.

The exterior walls are of puddingstone, granite and blue stone blocks, with brick window and door surrounds. The hip roof is black slate with red copper pans with multiple dormers and skylights.The Mary Baker Eddy Library for the Betterment of Humanity - Text-only Timeline A major renovation of the mansion was undertaken in 1907-1908 to the designs of Chicago-based architect Solon Spencer Beman, in preparation for occupancy by Mary Baker Eddy and her executive staff and household helpers. The renovation transformed the massing and layout of the original mansion, introduced two elevators inside, and added a substantial new wing in the style of the original.

History Prior to Eddy According to both Mary Baker Eddy Library and National Park service sites, the main house was built in 1880 by William Arthur Dupee, but this does not seem plausible since he was born on November 30, 1871. It seems more probable that it was built by his father, William Richardson Dupee, who was born August 10, 1841, in Brighton and died January 19, 1911, in Brookline. In 1895 the estate was sold by the Dupee family to R. Ashton Lawrence. Eddy years Mary Baker Eddy bought the estate from R. Ashton Lawrence in October 1907, but she did not move in until after the addition had been completed in 1908. She used the house not only as her home but also as the office from which she oversaw the management of the church she had founded. Eddy died at home on December 3, 1910, and was buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery. After Eddy The estate at 400 Beacon Street was bequeathed by Eddy to her church which, for decades, maintained it as she had left it. It was open to the public for many years until escalating costs as well as the need for major repairs and renovations led the church to close it to the public. In April 2006, the church announced it would sell the house as part of an overall plan to reduce its involvement in managing real estate and to instead focus on its \\"spiritual priorities\\".David Cook, \\"Museum buying last home of Monitor founder\\" Christian Science Monitor (November 10, 2006).

The sale did not include the furnishings and artifacts that had been in the home since her death in 1910. These were removed by the church before closing.

Employed in remote television broadcasts, satellite trucks transmit video signals back to studios or production facilities for editing and broadcast. Satellite trucks usually travel with a production truck, which contains video cameras, sound equipment and a crew. A satellite truck has a large satellite dish antenna which is pointed at a communications satellite, which then relays the signal back down to the studio. Satellite communication allows transmission from any location that the production truck can reach, provided a line of sight (direct view) to the desired satellite is available. KSTP satellite truck in the United States Equipment Typically a satellite truck will have its own onboard power source such as an electrical generator or inverter to create the alternating current to power all the transmission systems, which makes it a true independent mobile satellite transmission entity. Often such trucks also have various degrees of video production equipment and video editing gear. This equipment allows these trucks to also act as mobile electronic news gathering (ENG) facilities, or they can even be outfitted to do an electronic field production (EFP) to create an entire television show with multiple switched professional video cameras, character generators (CG) for digital on- screen graphics, video tape recorders (VTR) and video servers. Most satellite trucks have typically been built on a light or mid-duty truck chassis with 6 wheels; usually with 4 tires on the rear axle. All the equipment is mounted into the truck in racks that are fabricated into the box. Satellite Trucks are generally referred to as 'fixed load' vehicles, meaning that the amount of equipment on-board generally does not change and the weight of the truck (other than fuel) ordinarily does not fluctuate. Regulations Some of the larger satellite trucks weigh over , and therefore require the driver to obtain a Commercial Driver's License (CDL). Satellite trucks over GVWR are required to stop at weigh stations, undergo annual DOT inspections, and the Truck driver (usually also operates the truck) needs to pass a physical examination mandated by the DOT, maintain an accurate Drivers Daily Logbook, and comply with Hours of Service rules for professional drivers. Satellite Trucks part of a commercial fleet, or weighing over 10,000 pounds are considered commercial vehicles by the United States Department of Transportation (DOT). Uses Some newer generation satellite trucks are also being used for crisis communications and command and control centers for law enforcement (homeland security) emergency managers and public utility companies. The fact that these trucks do not rely upon terrestrial (land-based signals received through a conventional aerial) communication systems makes them ideal for information distribution and bandwidth creation in the aftermath of severe tropical cyclones, floods, and earthquakes when these land-based systems are damaged or destroyed. In the wake of hurricane Katrina, when the communication ability of news media outlets far exceeded that of many federal and state relief agencies, many governmental bodies have since migrated to a mobile satellite-based communication platform. C-Band satellite truck In the United States, C-Band Transportable uplinks (\\"Transportable Earth Station\\" (TES) or Satellite Truck) was initially used to transmit longer-format live television like sports television events and entertainment television programming. C-band satellite transmission requires a larger antenna than the Ku band trucks developed later in the 1980s, and a larger satellite antenna takes longer to set up and deploy. Prior to dispatch of a C Band transportable uplink, an RF Interference study needs to be completed. An RFI is a computer-generated report detailing any FCC protected microwave stations in the immediate area. This \\"frequency coordination\\" process has to be completed before an uplink transmission can commence. Terrestrial point-to-point signals share C-Band transmit frequencies (5.700-6.500 GHz), and full-time terrestrial signals take priority over ad hoc (temporary) C-Band uplink transmissions. Factors such as terrain, buildings and other structures are considered when determining the likelihood of interference from the TES. Two satellite trucks in Helsinki, Finland Historically, it was necessary to install land telephone lines (also called hard or wired lines) where the TES was located. This was expensive and difficult to do at the time since telephone companies were not used to setting up phone lines without notice of several days or even weeks. Early scrambling or encryption methods required a hard line for authorization of receive sites. Today, a digital cellular telephone is sufficient for most situations. C-Band transportable service remained a prevalent source of long-haul transmission because of its immunity to the \\"rain fade\\" that Ku band experiences in significant rainstorms. C-Band transportable services cost more than similar Ku service due to the robust nature of the signal, the larger physical size of the truck, and specialized nature of C-Band transmissions. With the advent of Ku band trucks (that don't require frequency coordination) and long-haul fiber optics providing similar signal qualities, C-Band transportable service experienced a slowdown in service volume in the 1990s. It's still used in situations where rain-fades (a problem affecting only Ku band uplinks) are unacceptable and where fiber-optic links are not practical. C-Band uplinks are still commonly used for golf, auto racing, horse racing, and major college sports events in rural areas where local fiber interconnects to long-haul networks are either not available or where the low number of events at the venue per year made installation of fiber not cost effective. Ku TES outnumber C perhaps 30:1, when you consider the number of TV Station, Network and \\"freelance\\" Ku trucks versus the limited number of C Band trucks. Even with diminished usage, C-Band transportable services are still utilized as an alternative to fiber optic cross-country transport as an 'alternate' transmission path. Most broadcast networks utilize both in order to protect their remote broadcasts that may be worth millions in rightholder fees. In the 2000 era, High Definition Television (HDTV) remote broadcasts caused a resurgence in C-Band transportable uplink service. The major factor in the resurgence was the limited amount of available bandwidth in local and long- haul fiber optic service, while uplink systems merely required the installation of High Definition MPEG digital encoders and decoders at either end. Ku band satellite truck Mobile Ku band satellite transmissions for television broadcasts started in Canada, until Conus Communications of St. Paul, MN along with Hubcom in Florida built the first SNG or Satellite News Gathering truck in 1983. Along with the truck, and later used vans purchased from Telesat in Canada, Conus developed a comms, or communications, system which allowed satellite transmissions without the need to drop phone lines. ENG, or Electronic News Gathering was never the same, and it was now possible to go 'live' from anywhere the truck could drive by raising the antenna and seeing the satellite. The development of the mobile phone, and its decreasing cost of operation and hardware over the years means trucks didn't need a satellite \\"comms\\" system in most places in the continental United States. Satellite time was also easily booked on an 'as-needed' basis, typically around $500 per hour for the common Ku band TV transmission. Over the years, Ku band Satellite trucks have undergone changes, from large trucks with C Band dishes outfitted with landing pads and antenna wings to make them FCC compliant to simpler rapidly deployable Ku band type. The Ku band uplink vehicles are available in a series of small to large vehicles varying from an SUV, van, Sprinter, \\"bread truck (cutaway)\\", to the more common carryall (2 axle/6 tire truck). The typical Ku uplink vehicles, are as large as 13 feet 6 inches tall by 40 feet long, the largest (Non-tractor-trailer type) commercial units allowed on the roads of the continental United States. Satellite Vehicles are either TV station or network-owned and custom suited to their internal usage needs or are rental units owned by independent companies. Independently owned satellite uplink vehicles are often designed to be versatile to performing multiple uplink functions ranging from straight uplink/downlink services, network news, satellite media tours, or even being configured to being a full production vehicle. Such large uplink trucks now have multiple camera television production capabilities all on board, as pioneered by SDTV (Satellite Digital Teleproductions) in the early 1990s. This combination, uplink with production, Transportable Earth Station (TES) are now the preferred vehicle for smaller (One to eight camera) on location live television broadcast instead of a separate uplink vehicle working alongside a larger 50-foot tractor trailer production-only vehicle, although the latter is still a regular occurrence. There are a few combination production/uplink combination vehicles where the uplink system is located on the semi-tractor and the production facilities are in the semi-trailer. These systems add the ability to physically separate the uplink from the production unit. Typical scenarios for this are when the production trailer has to park inside a building or if the uplink antenna has to be positioned farther away from the production trailer in order to make line-of-sight to the satellite arc. Larger Satellite vehicles are often television production control rooms (PCR) /Mobile Newsrooms/Workspaces on wheels, operated and maintained by broadcast engineers known as satellite truck operators. Both operators, of units large and small, are known to have a vagabond lifestyle, spending large parts of their lives on the road. Now even a simple flyaway transportable units can be packed all into two suitcases, all small enough to be airline compliant. The smaller suitcase flyaway units are often used to supplement a build on location television control room or to provide satellite uplink facilities in locations where a truck cannot be easily transported.

There are some companies that keep databases of part-time or freelance satellite truck operators. The National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) occasionally offer courses on the operation of satellite trucks but most operators have learned their trade from an industry mentor or a combination of both formal in school and on the job informal training. While helpful, formal training in electronics is not required to be a satellite truck operator. Even camera persons have made the transition from photography to transmission, a clear understanding of the operation of each device on the truck and at what point in the transmission flow it is used are required. Most modern day electronic equipment is too complicated to repair especially in the field. A truck operator, however, is expected to be able to quickly identify a defective device and either replace it or engineer a way around it. It is for this reason a strong transmission flow understanding is essential. Having a background in auto mechanics is also a plus especially when you consider the truck's main power source is a diesel generator. At the absolute least, an operator should know how to change an oil, fuel, or air filter and troubleshoot common engine problems i.e. burning oil, fuel pump failure, starter/alternator issues... Like other vehicles, trucks need regular maintenance and upkeep. Commercial vehicles must pass annual DOT inspection inspections. Older trucks are more difficult to maintain because of increased vehicle wear, availability of parts (for discontinued nameplates), and availability of qualified service personnel fluent in maintenance issues of older vehicles. The expected lifespan of most truck chassis is roughly 8‚Äì10 years or 200,000 miles, dependent on its operating environment. It is common for satellite truck boxes to be swapped over to a newer chassis. Driving the truck to and from event locations is a large, often overlooked, part of the job. Satellite truck operators are often not as interchangeable as reporters/producers/camera crews, and as a result, can be worked full news cycles (morningside to nightside). When this happens, the DOT Hours of Service rules may prohibit the operator to drive the truck. This often proves to be complicated for planning and logistic purposes. By the very nature of the work, a truck operator is expected to travel, often at the last minute. Most uplink-for-hire operators keep a packed suitcase with at least 7 days of clothing in or near the truck for prompt deployment.

French period  The struggle began during the French occupation of the Low countries. In 1795 the French introduced the separation of church and state. Due to this, education became a matter of the state. Prior to this, the Dutch Reformed Church had most power over education for centuries. The French did not forbid Christian schools, but they needed permission of the government, which was not given in all cases. Funding of Christian schools was out of the question. Religion was not completely banned from education, however.  19th century up to 1848  In the law on schools (schoolwet) of 1806 it was stated that public schools should educate for all Christian and civil virtues. Many Protestants thought this basis not sufficient. Especially the later Anti-Revolutionary politicians Guillaume Groen van Prinsterer and Abraham Kuyper wanted more religion in education and wanted special schools apart from the public schools. Following the Protestants, the Roman Catholics also came into the struggle. In 1840 they handed a list of complaints to King William I, showing the backlog of the Roman Catholics in the country. This list especially featured education. Part of the solution came from the constitution of liberal politician Johan Rudolph Thorbecke in 1848, in which freedom of education was included. Thorbecke himself was in favor of public education, but he thought that anybody should be allowed to establish a school, if the teachers were of good quality.  1848 to 1919  Missing in the constitution was a paragraph on funding of schools. In 1857 a law was introduced which made it more expensive to go to a school for children, caused by arrangements on salary of teachers, class size etc. Due to this, Jewish schools disappeared, but special Christian schools kept their position. In 1878 again a new law was introduced by Kappeyne van de Coppello, which increased the cost of education even more. The non-public schools had to fund these additional costs themselves. As a consequence, the poorest Protestants and Catholics could not send their children to their preferred school. The revolts of the people resulted in a petition to King William III, in which they asked him not to sign the new law. The petition was signed by more than 300,000 persons of Protestant origin. An alternative petition of the Roman Catholics received 100,000 signatures. The king, however, signed the law on 17 August of the same year. The protest of the ordinary people was not heard sufficiently, because they had no suffrage. By voting within electoral associations on a candidate they could, however, influence the voting by the elite. These electoral associations became the precursors of the current political parties. The first party was the ARP. It was established on 3 April 1879, partly by the same people that had established some months earlier a \\"school with the Bible.\\" Cartoon by Albert Hahn, suffrage (in the car) versus School Struggle (the line across the road). The name Bram of the person at the tree stands for Abraham Kuyper The Protestant and Catholic parties, the Anti-Revolutionary Party and Christian Historical Union and the General League of Roman Catholic Caucuses respectively, wanted their religious schools to receive financing equal to that received by public schools, while maintaining their freedom in, for example, curriculum policy and teacher appointments, that came with their religious tradition. Liberals and socialists tried to protect the privileged financial position of public schools and were much against public funding of religious schools. These parties had another political standpoint, which they thought more important than education: suffrage for all male citizens. They could not succeed to change the constitution in this manner, without support of a substantial part of the religious parties.  End of conflict  The conflict lasted from 1801 to 1920, when it was resolved in the Pacification of 1917 which included male suffrage. Suffrage for females came two years later. The Dutch solution was the separation of school and state by funding all schools equally, both public and private, which is enshrined in article 23 of the Dutch constitution. After this, many special schools appeared in the country, not only religious, but on the basis of other ideas on education. The result of the school struggle has enhanced the so-called pillarisation of the Dutch society, with even separate public, Protestant (Vrije Universiteit) and Catholic universities (Katholieke Universiteit Nijmegen).

The Pacification of 1917 was a political agreement between liberals and socialists on the left and Christian democrats on the right in the Netherlands, ending both the suffrage issue and the school struggle. Process and agreement The suffrage issue and the school struggle were issues that had dominated Dutch politics in the previous decades. When the liberal Cort van der Linden cabinet took office in 1913, it vowed to resolve both issues. A state committee tasked with finding a resolution to the suffrage issue was instituted on 15 November 1913. Although led by the liberal professor Jacques Oppenheim, it included members from all parliamentary parties and movements of the time, seeking a compromise that could rely on broad support. A second state committee for the school struggle was instituted on 31 December. It was led by the progressive liberal member of the House of Representatives Dirk Bos, but had a composition much like the first. The committees quickly agreed that the two issues should be treated as a compromise. The Opperheim Committee handed its report to the cabinet in 1914, while the Bos Committee finished in 1916. The Christian democratic parties would be given a constitutional right to equal funding for religious schools, for which they had pleaded since the early 19th century. In return, the Christian democrats vowed to support universal male suffrage, which had long been a wish of the liberal parties and the Social Democratic Workers' Party. Although suffrage would not be extended to women as part of the compromise, the sex requirement would be taken out of the Constitution, thus allowing a parliamentary majority to introduce it afterwards. Additionally, the majoritarian two-round system would replaced by party-list proportional representation using one nation-wide district, and compulsory voting was introduced. Since constitutional amendment required a majority in two successive parliaments, including a two-thirds majority in the second, a snap election was called in 1917. The major parties, all of which had agreed to the terms of the Pacification, did not field candidates against incumbent opponents in order to assure that the elected parliament would show the same level of support as the retiring one. Fifty incumbents stood unopposed, while another fifty were re-elected. Candidates challenging incumbents were mostly associated with the Anti-Constitution Committee, which opposed the prospective constitutional amendments, as well as members of the Peasants' League and the Christian Social Party. The newly elected House of Representatives, identical in composition to its predecessor, voted overwhelmingly in favour of the constitutional amendments on 25 September 1917; only two members voted against the education amendment. The Senate followed on 29 November, with only one Senator voting against all amendments. Consequences After having passed the amendments, parliament was immediately dissolved again, leading to the first election in organised in accordance with the new Constitution in 1918. The Social Democratic Workers' Party grew substantially, but the Christian democratic parties dominated the election, collectively winning a majority of the seats. The liberal parties were the losers of the extension of suffrage; the two conservative liberal parties fell from 31 seats to only 10. Although women did not yet enjoy active suffrage (the right to vote), they did now have passive suffrage (the right to be voted for), leading to the election of the first female member of the House of Representatives, the Social Democrat Suze Groeneweg. Active female suffrage was approved by parliament in 1919. Although the suffrage issue and the school struggle were now resolved, the Pacification did nothing to address the social question, which would subsequently become the dominant issue in Dutch politics. As a result, the terms left and right became less based on the religious/secular cleavage as it had been under the antithesis, and more based on the economic cleavage, with social democrats on the left, Christian democrats in the centre and liberals on the right. The end of the school struggle and the restructuring of the political spectrum paved the way for cooperation between Christian democrats and liberals, as would happen in the second Colijn cabinet. Another consequence of the Pacification was the development of consociationalism, manifesting itself as pillarisation, whereby Dutch politics and society were sharply divided into four \\"pillars\\" (Protestant, Catholic, liberal and socialist), each of which had a full set of its own social organisations, including churches (for the religious pillars), political parties, schools, universities, labour unions, sport clubs, youth clubs and newspapers.

Mallite is a type of laminate composite material, formerly manufactured by the William Mallinson & Sons company. The material is formed of a core sheet of end grain balsa wood, faced by duralumin sheets. This construction endows the finished material with greater strength and rigidity than a light alloy sheet of equal mass. The material was originally developed in the late 1950s for use in the aerospace industry, primarily for use in flooring and internal partitioning in jet airliner construction. However, it found fame as one of the first engineered composite materials to be employed in the motorsport industry. Robin Herd, formerly a designer on the Concorde project, used his aerospace knowledge to design the first McLaren single-seater racing cars. The M2A prototype used Mallite extensively, throughout its construction. The final production model, the Formula One McLaren M2B of 1966, only used Mallite for its internal skins and lower bodywork; a lack of understanding of the material's properties had led the team to design the car with conventional curved bodywork, creating problems during the fabrication process as the inherently inflexible material would not readily conform to complex, compound curvatures. With greater understanding of Mallite's properties Herd later used the material to construct the unraced Cosworth four-wheel drive Formula One car of 1969, noted for its slab-sided, angular looks.

Storylines Laurie arrives in September 1989, taking over a vacant stall on Turpin Road market, where Cindy Beale‚Äôs (Michelle Collins) mother had formerly sold hats.A;bert Square Market Hat Stall Laurie sells fruit and veg by trade, opening up in direct competition to the resident fruit and veg trader, Pete Beale (Peter Dean). A trade war escalates as Laurie tries to pilfer all Pete‚Äôs customers by undercutting his prices. Meanwhile, Laurie catches the eye of hairdresser Julie Cooper (Louise Plowright). They date briefly, but Laurie is far more taken with Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth) ‚Äì Pete‚Äôs recently estranged wife. Kathy is initially wary of Laurie, but she begins to warm to him after he shares his sad life story with her ‚Äì he‚Äôd been scarred by the loss of his second wife, who had died from cancer. Julie is extremely jealous of their blossoming romance, and Pete is furious that Laurie is not only trying to steal his customers, but also his wife. Numerous rows erupt between Laurie and Pete, as each try to outdo one another. Laurie and Kathy‚Äôs romance progresses slowly, as she was raped in 1988. Finding it hard to trust men, so she is unwilling to rush things with Laurie and Julie takes advantage of this. She seduces Laurie in October 1989 and they spend the night together but Laurie regrets it the next day, particularly when he is shunned by Kathy. Julie assumes that Laurie wants a relationship but he tells her their night together was a mistake. Incensed, Julie tries to turn him against Kathy, telling him that she was raped but this only makes him more sympathetic. He persuades Kathy to give him another chance and promises to take things slowly. Kathy and Laurie face objections from Pete and Kathy‚Äôs son Ian (Adam Woodyatt), who takes Pete‚Äôs side and refuses to accept Laurie as Kathy‚Äôs new beau. After a long period of feuding, Pete eventually accepts that he and Kathy are over and the Beales call a truce with Laurie. By 1990, Kathy finally feels ready to sleep with Laurie; however, their attempt at consummation fails and Laurie storms out angry and embarrassed (the reason for which is never divulged, although it is indicated that Kathy had laughed at Laurie and he later tells her that she ‚Äúhas a knack for laughing at the wrong time‚Äù). After this, Kathy loses interest and her ambiguous behaviour begins to confuse Laurie. He is keen to hold on to Kathy and he tries his best to please her, but she begins to feel that he is treating her like a possession ‚Äì buying her expensive clothes and jewellery and showing her off like a ‚Äútrophy‚Äù. Unaware of Kathy‚Äôs discontent, Laurie arranges a lavish date but when he comes to collect her, she refuses to go and ends the relationship. Laurie takes the rejection badly and some tactless comments regarding her sexual abstinence makes Kathy believe that he has hidden shallows. He storms off, dropping his wallet in his haste and, when Kathy retrieves it, she discovers that it contains a photograph of woman who strongly resembles her. Kathy concludes that Laurie has been attempting to recreate his dead wife through her, by dressing her in the same clothes and jewellery. Following this, Laurie becomes depressed and begins drinking heavily. His sister Shirley (Sarah Swingler) visits Kathy, asking her to tell him why she has ended their relationship which she does, accusing him of trying to turn her into a replica of his deceased wife; however, he tells her that the woman in the photo was not his dead wife. Kathy apologizes for jumping to conclusions; they call a truce and realize that they are not right for each other. This is Laurie‚Äôs last appearance, though it is revealed that he had decided to give up his market pitch and move on, an act which fuels rumours amongst the traders that Turpin Road Market is due to be closed. Character creation and development 1989 was a year of big change for EastEnders, both behind the cameras and in front of them. Original production designer, Keith Harris, left the show, and co- creators, Tony Holland and Julia Smith, both decided that the time had come to move on too; their final contribution coinciding with the exit of one of EastEnders most successful characters, Den Watts (Leslie Grantham). A new producer, Mike Gibbon, took control of the show and he enlisted the most experienced writers to take over the storylining of the programme, which included Charlie Humphreys, Jane Hollowood and Tony McHale. As well as Den, several other long running characters left the show in 1989, including three original cast members, Angie Watts (Anita Dobson), as well as Sue and Ali Osman (Sandy Ratcliff and Nejdet Salih) and their family; Donna Ludlow (Matilda Ziegler); Carmel Jackson (Judith Jacob) and her family, and one of the show's more controversial characters, Colin Russell (Michael Cashman). It was decided that 1989 was to be ‚Äúa year of change‚Äù in Walford. EastEnders script-writer, Colin Brake, has suggested that \\"it was almost as if Walford itself was making a fresh start\\". At the time EastEnders had come under criticism in the British media for being too depressing; arguably a reputation that it has never been able to shake. The programme makers were determined to change this. In 1989 there was a deliberate attempt to increase the lighter, more comic aspects of life in Albert Square. This led to the introduction of some characters who were deliberately conceived as comic or light-hearted. Such characters included Julie Cooper (Louise Plowright), a man-mad hairdresser; Marge Green ‚Äî a batty older lady played by veteran comedy actress, Pat Coombs; Trevor Short (Phil McDermott), the \\"village idiot\\", and his friend, northern heart-breaker Paul Priestly (Mark Thrippleton); wheeler- dealer Vince Johnson (Hepburn Graham) and Laurie Bates, who was introduced in September and became Pete Beale's (Peter Dean) sparring partner. On-screen Laurie arrived in Turpin Road Market and set up a rival fruit and veg stall in direct competition to Pete and the rivalry went further when he became romantically interested in Pete‚Äôs estranged wife, Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth). A feud between Laurie and Pete was launched, which included various jibes and games of one-upmanship, as each tried to outdo each other. Humour was an important element in the storylines during 1989, with a greater amount of slapstick and light comedy than ever before. 1989's changes were a ‚Äúbrave experiment‚Äù and while some found this period of EastEnders entertaining, many other viewers felt that the comedy stretched the programme's credibility somewhat. The programme still covered many issues in 1989, such as domestic violence, drugs, racism and rape ‚Äì specifically concerning the victim‚Äôs (Kathy) struggles to move on from the ordeal and trust other men (Laurie); however, the new emphasis on a more balanced mix between \\"light and heavy storylines\\" gave the \\"illusion\\" that the show had lost a \\"certain edge\\". By the end of the year EastEnders had acquired a new executive producer, Michael Ferguson, who had previously been a successful producer on ITV's The Bill. Ultimately, Ferguson was responsible for bringing in a new sense of vitality, and creating a programme that was \\"more in touch\\" with the \\"real world\\" than it had been over the last year. A new era began in 1990 with the introduction of the Mitchell brothers, Phil (Steve McFadden) and Grant (Ross Kemp), two extremely successful characters, who would go on to dominate the soap thereafter. As the new production machine cleared the way for new characters and a new direction, a number of characters were axed from the show at the start of the year. Among them was Laurie, as well as every other \\"comedic\\" character that had been introduced to the show in 1989. By March 1990 they had all gone. On-screen it became clear that Laurie‚Äôs \\"infatuation\\" with Kathy was not reciprocated. Their on/off relationship came to an end and Laurie decided to give up his stall in Walford, making his final screen appearance on 8 March 1990.

Location and construction Wigan Central station was on Station Road, some way from the two main stations (North Western and Wallgate) which are on the western edge of the town centre.The station on a 1948 OS Map via npe maps Wigan Central was the eventual terminus of the Wigan Junction Railways from Glazebrook West Junction.The line and mileages via railwaycodes It was built by the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (later to become the Great Central) and opened on 3 October 1892, when it replaced the temporary Wigan Darlington Street terminus, which had opened on 1 April 1884. Central was about a third of a mile nearer the town centre than Darlington Street. Operations According to Beeching's Reshaping of British Railways (see Appendix Passenger Line Usage Map) the line was more heavily used than many which did not close, however, as with many unmodernised and heavily used commuter lines it was deemed uneconomic. The line's main passenger traffic was workers travelling from the Wigan area to industrial plants in Cadishead and Partington and around the docks in Salford and Manchester; until the late 1970s the Lancashire United bus company operated a replacement bus service from Wigan to Partington. Steam remained the dominant motive power to the end of services, though some DMUs made an appearance. Services The service patterns in 1895, 1947 and 1962 are fully documented in the authoritative Disused Stations website.The station via Disused Stations UK In April 1884 the service pattern to Wigan (Darlington Street temporary terminus) was straightforward. Seven \\"Down\\" trains arrived from Manchester Central, one \\"express\\" called at Glazebrook only and three called at all stations. The remaining three missed some stations between Manchester and Glazebrook. With the exception of the \\"express\\", all trains called at all stations between Glazebrook and Wigan. The \\"Up\\" service was similar. In 1922 six \\"Down\\" trains arrived, All Stations from Manchester Central on \\"Weekdays\\" (Mondays to Saturdays), with a further evening train from Lowton St Mary's only. Three other trains arrived, apparently All Stations from Culcheth, but it is possible they originated at Liverpool Central and turned west to north at Dam Lane Junction. One of these trains ran on Fridays and Saturdays only and the other two ran on Saturdays only. The \\"Up\\" service was broadly similar, but the mix of Saturday-only trains was even more complicated. There was no Sunday service. Closure and after The station closed to passengers on 2 November 1964 and closed to all traffic the following April. It was demolished in 1973.The station via Disused Stations UKStation demolition via Wigan World The Grand Arcade shopping centre was built between 2006 and 2008 on the station site, of which no trace remains.

As part of a Technical Committee (TC), specialising in ‚Äúsignature services‚Äù, a ‚ÄúCore‚Äù specification was created by the international standardization organization OASIS in 2007. This standard defines the basic functionality for the creation (SignRequest /-Response) and validation (VerifyRequest /-Response) of CMS- and XMLDSig- compliant signatures. Due to the wide range of requirements from the various application areas of signatures and time-stamps, the core specification has been extended by a series of so-called ‚Äúprofiles‚Äù, e.g. for use with code signing, entity seals or processing XAdES- and CAdES-compliant artifacts. In the following years further profiles were developed, e.g. for detailed signature verification reports and for signature creation devices not located within the server instance. Based on this previous work, the challenges of a new ‚ÄúAPI-Ecosystem‚Äù were addressed in the OASIS Digital Signature Services eXtended (DSS-X) TC with version 2.0 of the Core, which also separates the semantics of the interface from the concrete implementation using a specific syntax. In addition to the XML syntax adopted from version 1, JSON, which is often used in modern web applications, is now also supported. Additional syntaxes could be defined, if required. For example, an ASN.1 based syntax would be conceivable to enable a particularly compact format for mobile and embedded applications with the ‚ÄúPacked Encoding Rules‚Äù (PER). To ensure the highest possible visibility and acceptance of the standard, the DSS-X Technical Committee, in collaboration with the OASIS Infrastructure team, has started to provide the interface on the ‚ÄûSwaggerHub‚Äú collaboration platform. For this purpose, the JSON schema is extended by a series of meta-information to comply with the OpenAPI specification. The profiles, recently created by ETSI and currently at OASIS, enable the specific characteristics of the AdES signature formats in combination with local and remote eIDAS-compliant signature created devices via the DSS-X interface. The additional attributes of the signatures (e.g., the embedded certificate status information, time- stamps or evidence records) allow a wide applicability of this format. Since the initial standardisation, the associated interface extensions for the XAdES and CAdES formats are defined by the ‚ÄúAdES-Profile‚Äù. As part of version 2.0, the AdES-Profile is currently updated to support the latest developments related to the AdES formats. In particular, the PAdES format based on the PDF specification is also supported in accordance with ETSI EN 319 142-1. With this PAdES format multiple signatures in a workflow and the visual representation of an electronic signature in a PDF document can be realised. For use within the eIDAS environment, the support of so-called ‚Äúpolicies‚Äù by the DSS-X specification proves to be valuable. This allows the caller to submit a ‚Äúpolicy‚Äù to the service, required for the desired action. The addressed server instance decides whether it can meet the required quality level or whether the request must be rejected. If the request is processed, the applied ‚Äúpolicy‚Äù can be transferred to the caller within the response structure. This ensures that a consensus has been reached on the minimum quality level to be applied.

Born into a noble family from Gelderland, he studied Law in Utrecht and worked as lawyer and a judge. He was elected into the House of Representatives in 1876, and retained his seat for twelve years before his premiership. In his cabinet, he served as minister of the Interior and minister of Colonial Affairs. After another thirteen years in the House, he became a member of the Council of State, receiving the honorary title Minister of State. Early life Mackay was born in Nijmegen on 29 November 1839, into a noble family of Scottish origin. His parents were Johan Fran√ßois Hendrik Jacob Ernestus Mackay, a member of the States of Gelderland and the brother of the 10th Lord Reay, and his wife Margaretha Clara Fran√ßoise van Lynden. At the age of six, he was among the first 116 students of De Klokkenberg, the first particular school in the area, which was established primarily at the hands of his father, despite enduring opposition from the municipal and provincial governments. He received secondary education at the Latin school in Nijmegen. Mackay moved to Utrecht in 1856 in order to study Roman and Contemporary Law. He left University on 27 November 1862 after defending his dissertation \\"The exclusion of clergy and ministers of Religion in the Legislature in accordance with art. 91 of the Constitution\\", after which he settled back in Nijmegen as a lawyer. He became deputy registrar in Arnhem in 1865, deputy prosecutor in Zwolle in 1867, and judge in 1873. Political career Mackay twice failed to get elected as Member of Parliament, for Nijmegen in 1873 and for Zutphen in 1875. On 4 April 1876, he was elected as a member of the House of Representatives for Amersfoort, defeating the liberal Willem Hendrik de Beaufort. In the House, he was concerned with a variety of policy areas, including justice, education, colonies and suffrage; in his first speech, he defended particular education and reform of the Elections Act. In 1883, he and three other MPs introduced a bill that would reduce the regulation imposed by the Lower Education Act, but the bill was fell due after a less far-reaching bill was passed the following year. In 1884, Mackay was elected Speaker of House of Representatives, obtaining 41 of 82 votes. He lost re-election as Speaker to Eppo Cremers the following year. In 1886, Mackay and five other MPs introduced an amendment to the education provision in the constitutional amendment proposed by the cabinet. After the cabinet failed to meet the Anti- Revolutionaries' demands regarding education and the constitutional amendment failed to pass the House, the cabinet resigned. In the subsequent election, Mackay was elected in both Amersfoort and Utrecht, and he chose to sit in the House for the latter. Two years later, after the right won a parliamentary majority in the 1888 general election, Mackay was appointed as formateur, tasked with composing a cabinet. On 20 April, Mackay became chairman of the council of ministers, or Prime Minister of the Netherlands. In his own cabinet, he served as Minister of the Interior. The school struggle was the most important issue for the cabinet. In 1889, the cabinet amended the Lower Education Act, improving the position of particular education. From then on, particular schools would receive subsidy on the same footing as public schools, and a new tax on school fees for municipal schools would allow particular schools to compete with public ones. In 1890, after his budget failed to pass through the Senate, Levinus Wilhelmus Christiaan Keuchenius resigned, and Mackay succeeded him as Minister of Colonial Affairs. A year later, a bill regarding military organisation failed to pass through the House, opposed by many Catholics, and the cabinet resigned on 21 Augustus 1891. A years after the end of his premiership, Mackay returned to the House of Representatives for Kampen, although he refrained from leading his party in the House. He declined taking part in the cabinet of Abraham Kuyper in 1901. He was elected for another term as Speaker of the House in the same year. He was one of the Anti-Revolutionary to vote against Johannes Tak van Poortvliet's constitutional amendment. After this constitutional amendment caused some Anti-Revolutionaries to split off and found the Christian Historical Union, Mackay left some ambiguity over his alignment. He remained Speaker until 1905, when he chose not to stand for re-election in the general election. In his last years, Mackay was a member of Council of State. He died in The Hague on 13 November 1909, at the age of 70. Private life Mackay married Elisabeth Wilhelmina, Baroness van Lynden in Nijmegen on 7 July 1869. They had one son, Eric, Baron Mackay, who inherited the Scottish peerage Lord Reay from his great-granduncle.

She was armed with a main battery of four guns and was capable of a top speed of . Friedrich Carl served with the scouting forces of the Active Battle Fleet for the first several years of her career, including a stint as the flagship of the reconnaissance squadron. During this period, she went on cruises abroad, including voyages where she escorted Kaiser Wilhelm II on tours in the Mediterranean Sea. She also participated in extensive training exercises in the Baltic and North Seas. In 1909, she was withdrawn from front- line service and used as a torpedo training ship, a role she held until 1914. After the outbreak of World War I in July 1914, the ship returned to active service for operations in the Baltic Sea against the Imperial Russian Navy. She served as the flagship of the cruiser squadron in the Baltic and participated in patrols in the Gulf of Finland. She was modified to carry a pair of seaplanes. In mid-November, the cruiser squadron was tasked with attacking the Russian base at Libau, but while en route on 17 November, Friedrich Carl struck a pair of naval mines. She remained afloat long enough for most of her crew to be taken off by the light cruiser before sinking; seven or eight men were killed in the sinking. Design Line-drawing of Prinz Adalbert; the shaded areas represent the portions of the ship protected by armor Friedrich Carl was the second member of the , which were ordered under the Second Naval Law of 1900. The law called for a force of fourteen armored cruisers that would be able to serve in Germany's colonial empire and scout for the main German fleet in home waters. The need to fill both roles was the result of budgetary limitations, which prevented Germany from building vessels specialized to each task. The Prinz Adalbert design was based on that of the previous armored cruiser, with incorporated a more powerful armament and more comprehensive armor protection. Friedrich Carl was long overall, and she had a beam of and a draft of forward. She displaced as built and up to fully loaded. The ship was powered by three vertical triple expansion engines driving three screws, with steam provided by fourteen coal-fired water-tube boilers. Her engines were rated at to yield a maximum speed of , though she slightly exceeded these figures on speed trials. She carried up to of coal, which enabled a maximum range of up to at a cruising speed of . Her standard crew consisted of 35 officers and 551 enlisted men. She was armed with four guns arranged in two twin gun turrets, one on either end of the superstructure. Her secondary armament consisted of ten SK L/40 guns mounted in casemates in a two-story arrangement amidships. For defense against torpedo boats, she carried twelve guns in both single pedestal mounts and casemates. Friedrich Carl was also equipped with four torpedo tubes submerged below the waterline, one in the bow, one in the stern, and one on each broadside. Friedrich Carl was protected by Krupp armor; her armored belt was thick amidships and reduced to forward and aft. The deck armor was thick, and her forward conning tower was thick. The main battery turrets had 150 mm thick sides and the casemate guns were protected with 100 mm of Krupp steel. Service history Construction through 1905 Midsection of Friedrich Carl in a miniature in the Deutsches Museum Friedrich Carl was ordered under the provisional name Ersatz K√∂nig Wilhelm and built at the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg under yard number 155. Her keel was laid down in August 1900 and she was launched on 21 June 1902. At the launching ceremony, Prince Friedrich Leopold of Prussia gave a speech; he was the son of the ship's namesake, Prince Friedrich Carl. Friedrich Leopold's wife, Louise Sophie, christened the ship. Fitting-out work followed, and in November 1903 a shipyard crew began builder's trials before she was moved to Wilhelmshaven to have her artillery installed. Work on the vessel was completed by 12 December 1903, the day she began sea trials; her first commander was Kapit√§n zur See (KzS‚ÄîCaptain at Sea) Johannes Merten. Trials were interrupted in March 1904 when Friedrich Carl was tasked with escorting Kaiser Wilhelm II aboard the Norddeutscher Lloyd steamer on a trip to the Mediterranean Sea. On 12 March the ships left Bremerhaven and steamed to Vigo, Spain, where the Spanish king, Alfonso XIII, visited Friedrich Carl on 15 March. Three days later the ships arrived in Gibraltar, where they met the British Channel Squadron. They then proceeded to Naples, Italy, by way of Mah√≥n, where on 24 March Wilhelm II transferred to his yacht, Hohenzollern. King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy visited the ship there before Friedrich Carl, Hohenzollern, and the dispatch boat began a tour of Mediterranean ports. Friedrich Carl was in need of repairs, so she left Hohenzollern and Sleipner on 26 April and began the voyage back to Germany; she stopped in Venice, Italy, on 7 May and arrived back in Kiel on 17 May. There, she was assigned to the reconnaissance force of the Active Battle Fleet, taking the place of the protected cruiser . Beginning in June, Friedrich Carl joined II Squadron for a tour of Dutch, British, and Norwegian ports that lasted until August. During the voyage, Friedrich Carl had to tow two torpedo boats along with the coastal defense ship and the torpedo boat to Stavanger, Norway. On returning to Germany, the German fleet conducted its annual maneuvers in August and September in the North and Baltic Seas. Following the conclusion of the maneuvers in September, Merten was replaced as the ship's commander by Fregattenkapit√§n (FK‚ÄîFrigate Captain) Hugo von Cotzhausen. The ship's sea trials were also officially ended at that point. In November, the crew briefly staged a mutiny against Cotzhausen, citing his inept leadership, though he remained in command. KAdm Gustav Schmidt, who was the commander of reconnaissance forces of the Active Battlefleet, transferred from Prinz Heinrich, making Friedrich Carl the new flagship of the reconnaissance squadron. From January to February 1905, Friedrich Carl participated in training exercises in the Baltic. While cruising north of the Great Belt, she struck a submerged shipwreck but suffered no significant damage in the accident. Beginning on 23 March, she again accompanied Wilhelm II, this time aboard the HAPAG steamship , for another voyage to the Mediterranean. While the ships were in Lisbon, they were visited by King Carlos I of Portugal. German Chancellor Bernhard von B√ºlow sent a message to Wilhelm II in Lisbon suggesting he visit Morocco, and on 31 March Friedrich Carl and Hamburg arrived in Tangier, where they encountered the French cruisers and . Wilhelm II made a speech where he supported Moroccan independence, which led to the First Moroccan Crisis. The following day, the two German vessels steamed to Gibraltar, where Friedrich Carl accidentally collided with the British pre-dreadnought battleship . During the cruise, Schmidt transferred to Prinz Heinrich. On her return to Germany in June, she resumed her role as flagship, apart from during a maintenance period from 10 to 26 August. 1905‚Äì1915 Map of the North and Baltic Seas in 1911 In July, Friedrich Carl joined the rest of the fleet for a cruise in the North and Baltic Seas, during which she accidentally ran aground but was not damaged. She thereafter participated in squadron exercises in the Baltic. In February 1906, she went on a training cruise to Denmark. The new armored cruiser replaced Friedrich Carl as the squadron flagship in late March. Friedrich Carl in turn replaced Prinz Heinrich as the flagship of the deputy commander, Kommodore (Commodore) Raimund Winkler. She remained in this role only briefly, however, before the new armored cruiser took her place on 15 August. The autumn maneuvers of 1906 were conducted in Norwegian waters and the western Baltic. After the maneuvers, FK Franz von Hipper took command of the ship. Friedrich Carl resumed her role as the deputy commander flagship on 31 October when KzS Eugen Kalau vom Hofe came aboard the ship; she held the position until 5 March 1908. The year 1907 passed uneventfully for Friedrich Carl; she briefly served as the squadron flagship from 11 September to 28 October due to an accident with Yorck. Friedrich Carl went on a major training cruise into the Atlantic Ocean in early 1908 and on her return to Wilhelmshaven was decommissioned on 5 March for lengthy repairs. On returning to service on 1 March 1909, KzS Friedrich Schultz assumed command of the ship, which was to be used as a torpedo test ship. In this role, she replaced the protected cruiser ; Schultz was also the commander of the Torpedo Testing Inspectorate. On 30 March, Friedrich Carl was assigned to the temporary Training and Testing Ship Unit for maneuvers that were conducted off the island of R√ºgen in April. The unit was dissolved on 24 April, and from mid- August to early September, Friedrich Carl participated in the autumn maneuvers as part of the Reconnaissance Group of the Reserve Fleet. The years 1910 and 1911 followed a similar training routine to that of 1909, though Schultz had been replaced by KzS Ernst Ritter von Mann und Edler von Tiechler as the ship's captain in September 1909 and by KAdm Wilhelm von Lans as commander of the Torpedo Testing Inspectorate on 19 December 1909. Tiechler was in turn replaced by FK Andreas Michelsen in September 1911; he held the command until the outbreak of World War I in July 1914. In July 1911, Friedrich Carl conducted torpedo tests with the light cruiser in Norwegian waters. The winter of 1911‚Äì1912 was particularly severe, and so in early 1912 Friedrich Carl was used to rescue merchant ships that had been trapped in the iced-over Baltic. That year, the Training and Testing Ship Unit was reactivated as the Training Squadron for exercises. KAdm Reinhard Koch replaced Lans on 1 October 1912 and kept Friedrich Carl as his flagship. During the autumn maneuvers that year, Friedrich Carl was assigned to II Scouting Group of what was now the High Seas Fleet. The training routine in 1913 and the first half of 1914 followed the same pattern as in previous years. On 6 April 1914, she ran aground off Swinem√ºnde but was pulled free without damage. During the Kiel Week sailing regatta in July 1914, Gro√üadmiral (Grand Admiral) Alfred von Tirpitz came aboard Friedrich Carl to observe the festivities, which coincided with a visit from the British Royal Navy. While Edward Goschen, the British ambassador was visiting Tirpitz aboard the ship, news of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand arrived. On 31 July, days after Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia but before Germany entered the war, Friedrich Carl went into drydock at the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) in Kiel for repairs in preparation for the coming conflict. World War I On 28 August, Friedrich Carl returned to service under the command of KzS Max Schlicht, though he held the position for just two months before being replaced by FK Loesch. Friedrich Carl was assigned to the Cruiser Division of the Baltic Sea, taking the place of the protected cruiser , where she became the flagship of KAdm Robert Mischke. In late September, the division supported the laying of a defensive minefield off Langeland. The ship was transferred to the unit commanded by KAdm Ehler Behring, where she served as his flagship. At the time, the unit included the protected cruisers Vineta, , and and the light cruisers Augsburg, , and , along with attendant torpedo boats and U-boats. The division was based in Neufahrwasser in Danzig. Friedrich Carl took part in a sortie into the Gulf of Finland on 24 October to sweep for Russian warships and British submarines that were operating in the area, though the Germans failed to locate any hostile vessels. By this time, the ship had been modified to carry seaplanes; she carried two planes provisionally and had no permanent modifications made to support them. On 30 October another patrol was carried out, again without success. In early November, Friedrich Carl was withdrawn for repairs, though these were completed by mid-November. In the meantime, the German naval command, which was aware that British submarines were operating in the Baltic Sea, had ordered Behring to attack the Russian port at Libau to prevent it from being used as a British submarine base. Friedrich Carl was assigned to the attack force, and left Memel on 16 November to bombard Russian positions around Libau; at 01:46 on 17 November, while west of Memel, she struck a naval mine that had been laid by Russian destroyers in October. The ship's crew initially thought the shock of the explosion was from striking a submarine; they immediately altered course to return to Memel, at which point she struck a second mine at 01:57. She began to take on water, though she remained afloat for some time. At 6:20, Augsburg arrived on the scene and evacuated the crew, and Friedrich Carl was abandoned to sink, which she did at 07:15. Only seven or eight men were killed in the sinking.

History In the 1800s, starting around the time of the Civil War, thrifty homemakers would use scraps of wool or felted wool from old clothing, blankets and hats to create designs for mats or rugs. Using coins as templates, they created circles and each piece was then stitched in blanket stitch fashion. (Thus, the name \\"penny\\" rug). Sometimes, the mats or rugs were backed with old burlap bags or feed sacks. Sometimes a penny was stitched inside the mat to make it lie flat. Penny rugs are not actual rugs for the floor, but decorative coverings for beds, tables and dressers and mantles. Sometimes they are used as wall hangings or pillows. Most designs include circles and some include images from everyday life such as cats, flowers, birds and shapes such as stars and hearts.

Ecclesiastical career Schaffgotsch was born in Bad Warmbrunn in the Riesengebirge mountains to the House of Schaffgotsch, an old Silesian aristocratic family. He was educated by the Jesuits at the Collegium Romanum in Rome. In 1738, Schaffgotsch was ordained a Roman Catholic priest in Vienna and was appointed a canon in Olomouc, Halberstadt and later in Breslau. During this time he became a member of the fraternal organization known as Freemasons and was heavily influenced by the Enlightenment-era ideas and philosophies. And although Freemasonry was condemned by Pope Clement XII in 1738 in the Papal Bull In eminenti, Schaffgotsch supported the creation of the first Freemason loge in the Austrian capital, Vienna. Despite his disagreements with the Vatican, in 1743 he was created an abbot and soon after a coadjutor bishop of Breslau to Prince-Bishop Philipp Ludwig von Sinzendorf. Following Sinzendorf‚Äôs death in 1747, Schaffgotsch was elevated by King Frederick II of Prussia to Prince- Bishop. This appointment was confirmed by Pope Benedict XIV on 5 March 1748 despite Schaffgotsch‚Äôs relationship with Freemasons. Count Philipp Gotthard of Schaffgotsch was finally consecrated on 1 May 1748. Later years CoA. In 1757, at the outset of the Seven Years' War, Schaffgotsch, on the advice of Empress Maria Theresa, left Breslau and moved the seat of his diocese to castle J√°nsk√Ω Vrch in Austrian Silesia. Frederick the Great viewed this move by the Prince-Bishop as betrayal and placed the Breslau diocese under official administration where it remained for the remainder of the war. In 1763, Schaffgotsch was allowed to return to the Prussian part of the diocese, but was confined to Oppeln and unable to return to Breslau. His calls for reinstatement were also ignored by the King who appointed auxiliary bishop Johann Moritz von Strachwitz and in 1781 auxiliary bishop Anton Ferdinand von Rothkirch und Panthen to oversee the Prussian part of the diocese. In 1766 Schaffgotsch fled from Oppeln back on the castle J√°nsk√Ω Vrch in Austrian Silesia, which remained his residence until his death in 1795 and from where he led the Austrian part of the diocese. During his time in Javorn√≠k, J√°nsk√Ω Vrch became a cultural center of the region, and a meeting place for artist from the entire Holy Roman Empire. Among the most notable was composer Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf who resided in Javorn√≠k for over 20 years. Schaffgotsch died at the castle in 1795 and was buried in the family tomb in Warmbrunn.

Its height is cca. 3 m The B√ºkk√°br√°ny mummified forest is a 2007 paleontological discovery in northeastern Hungary of sixteen well-preserved swamp cypress (Taxodium) trunks of Miocene age which were found in an open pit lignite mine 60 meters underground near the town of B√ºkk√°br√°ny.BBC ‚Äì Ancient forest found in Hungary The trunks, about six metres high and two to three metres in diameter, were cased in sand about eight million years ago, preserving their wood without fossilization.Archaeologists discover 8-million-year-old forest in Hungary, Yahoo News The find is unique in Europe, since trees this old have never been found in their original state and original place before.Reggel ‚Äì Megmenek√ºlhetnek a ciprusok The cypresses were 30 to 40 meters high and 300 to 400 years old when they died during the Miocene period, when this region was partially covered by the shallow Pannonian Sea with marshy shorelines creating habitat for swamp cypresses. The trees were covered by a sandstorm up to a height of 6 meters, and their trunks were preserved intact. Because of the non-fossilized state of the trees, dendrochronology tests can be done, and scientists can gain insight into the climate changes of the period when the trees lived. Their non-fossilized state also makes the trees very vulnerable to external conditions such as air and sunlight, so it was with precautions and the strictest security measures that the cypresses were transported, four to the Ott√≥ Herman Museum in county seat Miskolc in northeast Hungary on August 8, 2007, and the rest to the visitor's centre of the B√ºkk National Park in Ipolytarn√≥c. During transportation the trees were drenched with water in order to preserve them. It is likely that not all of the trunks can be preserved since some of them have already decayed, and only their shucks remain, filled with sand. The preservation process can last up to 4 years and will cost about 200 million forints (800,000 euros).

Many treatments already in clinical trials involve drugs that are used in other diseases or medications that have not been designed specifically for multiple sclerosis. There are also trials involving the combination of drugs that are already in use for multiple sclerosis. Finally, there are also many basic investigations that try to understand better the disease and in the future may help to find new treatments. Research directions on MS treatments include investigations of MS pathogenesis and heterogeneity; research of more effective, convenient, or tolerable new treatments for RRMS; creation of therapies for the progressive subtypes; neuroprotection strategies; and the search for effective symptomatic treatments. Separated variants Several previous MS variants have been recently separated from MS after the discovery of a specific auto-antibody, specially autoantibodies against AQP4, MOG and Neurofascin proteins. Previously recognized variants of MS like Optic-Spinal MS is now classified as a phenotype of the anti-AQP4 spectrum, and some tumefactive cases of MS as anti-MOG associated encephalomyelitis. Some researchers think that there could exist also an overlapping between Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis cases and neuromyelitis optica or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. The following previous MS variants are now considered apart from MS: *Optic-Spinal MS: Now it is considered inside the Anti-AQP4 diseases spectrum. * Anti-MOG associated MS and some cases of tumefactive multiple sclerosis currently considered inside the anti-MOG spectrum. *Anti-neurofascin associated MS and CIDP: Some Anti- neurofascin demyelinating diseases were previously considered a subtype of Multiple Sclerosis but now they are considered a separate entity, as it happened before to anti-MOG and anti-AQP4 cases. Around 10% of MS cases are now thought to be anti-Neurofascin disease in reality.Marcus Vinicius, Magno Goncalves, Yara Dadalti Fragoso, The involvement of anti-neurofascin 155 antibodies in central and peripheral demyelinating diseases, Neuroimmunol Neuroinflammation, 8 Apr 2019;6:6.10.20517/2347-8659.2019.08 Anti-neurofascin autoantibodies have been reported in atypical cases of MS and CIDP, and a whole spectrum of Anti-neurofascin demyelinating diseases has been proposed. Some cases of CIDP are reported to be produced by auto-antibodies against several neurofascin proteins. These proteins are present in the neurons and four of them have been reported to produce disease: NF186, NF180, NF166 and NF155. Antibodies against Neurofascins NF-155 can also appear in MS and NF-186 could be involved in subtypes of MSEarly research into a treatment for progressive MS yielding an intersection between both conditions. Summarising, autoantibodies against several neurofascins can produce MS: neurofascin186 (NF186), neurofascin155 (NF155), contactin 1 (CNTN1), contactin associated protein 1 (CASPR1) and gliomedin. All of them nodal and paranodal proteins. *Anti-TNF associated MS: Several anti-TNF drugs like adalimumab are commonly prescribed by a number of autoimmune conditions. Some of them have been reported to produce a CNS-demyelination compatible with, and by current knowledge indistinguishable from, standard MS. Several other monoclonal antibodies like pembrolizumab,Marzia Anita Lucia Romeo et al, Multiple sclerosis associated with pembrolizumab in a patient with non-small cell lung cancer, Journal of Neurology, pp 1‚Äì4, 04 October 2019 nivolumab and infliximabAlicja Kalinowska-Lyszczarz, Mahboobeh Fereidan-Esfahani, Yong Guo, Pathological findings in central nervous system demyelination associated with infliximab, https://doi.org/10.1177/1352458519894710 have been also reported to produce MS artificially. This has given birth to the Anti-TNF-Œ± therapy- associated demyelinating disorders. The reactions have been diverse according to the source of the disease. Some of these cases can be classify as ADEM, using the confluent demyelination as barrier between both conditions. In most cases, the damage fullfills all pathological diagnostic criteria of MS and can therefore be classified as MS in its own right. The lesions were classified as pattern II in the Lassman/Lucchinetti system. Some lesions also showed Dawson fingers, which is supposed to be a MS-only feature. *LHON-associated MS: Also a previous subtype of MS associated to LHON has been described (LHON-MS)David Bargiela, Patrick F Chinnery, Mitochondria in neuroinflammation ‚Äì Multiple sclerosis (MS), leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) and LHON-MS, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neulet.2017.06.051 It is a presentation of LHON with MS-like CNS damage. It used to satisfy McDonalds definition for MS, but after demonstration that LHON can produce this kind of lesions, the \\"no better explanation\\" requirement does not hold anymore. It is not due to auto- antibodies, but to defective mitochondria instead. The symptoms of this higher form of the disease include loss of the brain's ability to control the movement of muscles, tremors, and cardiac arrhythmia.cardiac arrythmia and the lack of muscular controlMayo Clinic: Multiple Sclerosis Treatments Advancements during the last decades have led to the recent approval of several oral drugs. In March 2019 for example the Food and Drug Administration approved cladribine tablets (Mavenclad) to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) in adults, to include relapsing-remitting disease and active secondary progressive disease. These drugs are expected to gain in popularity and frequency of use at the expense of previously existing therapies. Further oral drugs are still under investigation, the most notable example being laquinimod, which was announced in August 2012 to be the focus of a third phase III trial after mixed results in the previous ones. Early trials of the female sex hormone estriol, led in part by Rhonda Voskuhl, have generated interest in reducing symptoms in women with RRMS. Similarly, several other studies are aimed to improve efficacy and ease of use of already existing therapies through the use of novel preparations. Such is the case the PEGylated version of interferon-Œ≤-1a, that has a longer life than normal interferon and therefore it is being studied if given at less frequent doses has a similar efficacy than the existing product. Peginterferon beta-1a was approved for use in the United States in August 2014. Preliminary data have suggested that mycophenolate mofetil, an anti-rejection immunosuppressant medication, might have benefits in people with multiple sclerosis. However a systematic review found that the limited evidence available was insufficient to determine the effects of mycophenolate mofetil as an add‚Äêon therapy for interferon beta-1a in people with RRMS. Monoclonal antibodies, which are biological drugs of the same family as natalizumab, have also raised high levels of interest and research. Alemtuzumab, daclizumab and CD20 monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab, ocrelizumab and ofatumumab have all shown some benefit and are under study as potential treatments for MS. Nevertheless, their use has also been accompanied by the appearance of potentially dangerous adverse effects, most importantly opportunistic infections. Related to these investigations is the recent development of a test against JC virus antibodies which might help to predict what patients are at a greater risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy when taking natalizumab. While monoclonal antibodies are probably going to have some role in the treatment of the disease in the future, it is believed that it will be small due to the risks associated to them. Another research strategy is to evaluate the combined effectiveness of two or more drugs. The main rationale for polytherapy in MS is that the involved treatments target different mechanisms of the disease and therefore, their use is not necessarily exclusive. Moreover, synergies, in which a drug potentiates the effect of another are also possible. Nevertheless, there can also appear important drawbacks such as antagonizing mechanisms of action or potentiation of deleterious secondary effects. While there have been several clinical trials of combined therapy none has shown positive enough effects to merit the consideration as a viable treatment for MS. Regarding neuroprotective and regenerative treatments such as stem cell therapy, while their research is considered of high importance at the moment they are only a promise of future therapeutic approaches. Likewise, there are not any effective treatments for the progressive variants of the disease. Many of the newest drugs as well as those under development are probably going to be evaluated as therapies for PPMS or SPMS, and their improved effectiveness when compared with previously existing drugs may eventually lead to a positive result in these groups of patients. Disease- modifying drugs Disease-modifying drugs represent possible interventions able to modify the natural course of the disease instead of targeting the symptoms or the recovery from relapses. Over a dozen clinical trials testing potential therapies are underway, and additional new treatments are being devised and tested in animal models. New drugs must pass several clinical trials in order to get approved by regulatory agencies. Phase III is normally the last testing phase and when results are as expected a formal approval request is submitted to the regulator. Phase III programs consist of studies on large patient groups (300 to 3,000 or more) and are aimed at being the definitive assessment of how effective and safe a test drug will be. It is the last stage of drug development and is followed by a submission to the appropriate regulatory agencies (e.g., European Medicines Agency (EMEA) for the European Union, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the United States, Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) for Australia, etc.) to obtain approval for marketing. Treatment in MS phase III studies is usually two years per patient. Relapsing-remitting MS Currently there are several ongoing phase III trials, and there are also some drugs that are waiting for approval after finishing theirs. The following drugs, at least, are also in phase III (for a complete list see Multiple sclerosis drug pipeline): *Tovaxin (injectable) A vaccine against self T-Cells, which consist of attenuated autoreactive T cells. It is developed by Opexa Therapeutics, (previously known as PharmaFrontiers), and finished a phase IIb September 2008,Opexa shares lose most of value on study data failing its primary target though in March 2008 was still performing good.Opexa Therapeutics Announces Completion Of Mid Study Descriptive Analysis On Phase IIb Trial Of Tovaxin After several financial troubles, a phase III trial has been granted in 2011Tovaxin phase III announced http://www.opexatherapeutics.com/?page=release&section;=news&article;=010511 Secondary progressive variants Relapsing-Onset variants (RO), even when they turn into progressive, have proved easier to treat than Progressive-Onset variants. Though difficult to treat, Secondary progressive and Progressive- Relapsing are easier to treat than PPMS. Only Mitoxantrone has been approved for them, but there is nothing for PPMS. At this moment several therapies are under research: *Cyclophosphamide (trade name Revimmune) is currently in Phase III for secondary progressive MS.Significant Advances in Multiple Sclerosis Treatment http://www.pharmacytimes.com/publications/specialty- pt/2011/February-2011/SPT-NPP-0211 It was also studied for RRMS but the company does not pursue actively this path. After a 2006 study for refractory cases it showed good behaviour Later, a 2007 open label study found it equivalent to Mitoxantrone and in 2008 evidence appeared that it can reverse disability. *Simvastatin has shown brain atrophy reduction in secondary progressive MS. *Masitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is in late-stage testing for the treatment of patients with secondary and primary progressive MS (PPMS). It is a twice-daily oral medication that targets mast cells and inhibits several biochemical processes.14 *Ibudilast: MediciNova, Inc., announced that MN-166 (ibudilast) has been approved for \\"fast track\\" development by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as of 2016, as a potential treatment for progressive multiple sclerosis (MS). Progressive MS in this case means both the primary progressive (PPMS) and secondary progressive (SPMS) forms of the disease. Treatment for Primary Progressive variants Most Progressive-Onset variants does not have any approved disease-modifying treatment currently. Some possible treatments have been published, such as methylprednisolone pulses or riluzole, and some reduction of spasticity was reported in a pilot Italian study on low dose naltrexone but there is nothing conclusive still. Currently, good results using the monoclonal antibody Ocrelizumab in primary progressive MS (PPMS) have put the focus into depleting B cells targeting CD20 proteins A Statin, Simvastatin (Zocor), has shown good results in progressive variantsStatin may slow progressive MS Also Masitinib and Ibudilast, mainly targeted to SPMS have recruited PPMS patients in their clinical trials with good results. Respect the etiological research, a special genetic variant named rapidly progressive multiple sclerosis has been described. It is due to a mutation inside the gene NR1H3, an arginine to glutamine mutation in the position p.Arg415Gln, in an area that codifies the protein LXRA. Highly active relapsing remitting variant Highly Active Relapsing Remitting, sometimes called Rapidly Worsening relapsing remitting, is a clinical form considered distinct from standard RRMS during clinical trials, being normally non responsive to standard medication. As of 2011, fingolimod has been approved as the first disease modifying therapy for this clinical course.First Oral Treatment For Highly Active Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis Provides New Choice For UK Patients Failing On Injections, Cyclophosphamide is currently used off-label for Rapidly Worsening MS (RWMS). Pediatric MS Pediatric patients constitute a particularly interesting MS population since the clinical onset of the disease is likely very close to the biological one. Therefore this population offers the possibility of studying the MS pathogenesis closer to its root. Grat Matter Lesions were observed in the cerebellum of almost all (93.3%) adolescents with pedMS and significantly outnumbered WML, suggesting that the cerebellar cortex is a main target of MS- related pathology in teens. A former problem with pediatric patients is that some variants of anti-MOG disease were considered MS before 2016. Therefore publications before this date have to be considered with caution. Currently the only approved treatment for pediatric MS is fingolimod. Personalized medicine Personalized medicine refers to the expected possibility of classifying patients as good or bad responders before starting a therapy. Given the side effects of all MS medications, this is currently an active field of research. Biomarkers :Main:Multiple sclerosis biomarkers Several biomarkers for diagnosis, disease evolution and response to medication (current or expected) are under research. While most of them are still under research, there are some of them already well stablished: *oligoclonal bands: They present proteins that are in the CNS or in blood. Those that are in CNS but not in blood suggest a diagnosis of MS. *MRZ-Reaction: A polyspecific antiviral immune response against the viruses of measles, rubella and zoster found in 1992. In some reports the MRZR showed a lower sensitivity than OCB (70% vs. 100%), but a higher specificity (69% vs. 92%) for MS. *free light chains (FLC). Several authors have reported that they are comparable or even better than oligoclonal bands. Imaging While MRI is used normally for diagnosis and follow up, it has limitations. New MRI technologies like pulse sequences and post-processing are under study. Anyway some of the features of MS, like microglia activation, are invisible to MRI. Therefore positron emission tomography (PET) is preferred in the current studies Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) routinely undergo serial contrast-enhanced MRI checks. Given concerns regarding tissue deposition of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) and evidence that enhancement of lesions is only seen in patients with new disease activity on noncontrast imaging. Research is now being carried out to understand and implement what intravenous contrast agents would be reserved for patients with evidence of new disease activity on non-contrast images. Clinical measures of evolution The main measure of evolution of symptoms, specially important as an endpoint in MS trials, is the EDSS (extended disability status score). However, this and other measures used in clinical studies are far from perfect and suffer from insensitivity or inadequate validation. In this sense there is ongoing research to improve the EDSS and other measures such as the multiple sclerosis functional composite. This is important as the greater efficacy of existing medications force functional measures in clinical trials to be highly sensitive in order to adequately measure disease changes. Currently there are two main criteria coexisting: * EDSS (disability status scale) - The first scale to monitor MS progression. * NEDA (No evidence of disease activity). The new one. Several NEDA criteria have been published. NEDA-3 means that EDSS remains constant, MRI shows no activity and no relapses have appeared. NEDA-4 means NEDA-3 plus that brain atrophy has not increased. Some authors speak about a NEDA-3+ which is a NEDA-3 plus no cortical lesions. Clinical courses redefinition In MS usually the clinical course is referred to as \\"type\\", while radiological and pathological types are referred to as \\"variants\\". In 1996, the US National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS) Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials in Multiple Sclerosis (ACCTMS) standardized four clinical courses for MS (Remitent-Recidivant, Secondary Progressive, Progressive-Relapsing and Primary progressive). Later, these were considered subtypes of the disease. Some reports state that those \\"types\\" were artificially made up for classifying RRMS as a separate disease. In this way, the number of patients in this group was low enough to get the interferon approved by the FDA under the orphan drugs act. Later revisions of this report removed the progressive-relapsing course and added CIS. Nevertheless, regulatory agencies often refer to unofficial subtypes in their recommendations, like \\"active SPMS\\" FDA press release for Mavenclad \\"highly active\\",European Medicines agency, Mavenclad approval press release or \\"rapidly progressive\\". These types have proven to be unspecific. In the days in which NMO was considered a kind of MS (optic-spinal MS), the four clinical types model on widespread usage, and it was nevertheless unable to yield any clue about all the important differences. Currently it is accepted that the \\"types\\" are not exclusive. The standard course of the disease presents three different clinical stages. A preclinical or prodromal stage, also termed RIS (radiologically isolated sindrome), a relapsing stage and finally a progressive stage. Atypical clinical courses In 1996, the US National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS) Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials in Multiple Sclerosis (ACCTMS) standardized four clinical courses for MS (Remitent-Recidivant, Secondary Progressive, Progressive-Relapsing and Primary progressive). Later, Some reports state that those \\"types\\" were artificially made up trying to classify RRMS as a separate disease so that the number of patients was low enough to get the interferon approved by the FDA under the orphan drugs act. Revisions in 2013 and 2017 removed the Progressive-Relapsing course and introduced CIS as a variety/course/status of MS, stablishing the actual classification (CIS, RRMS, SPMS and PPMS). Nevertheless these types are not enough to predict the responses to medications and several regulatory agencies use additional types in their recommendations lide Highly active MS, Malignant MS, Aggressive MS or Rapidly progressive MS.D√≠az C, Zarco LA, Rivera DM, Highly active multiple sclerosis: An update, Mult Scler Relat Disord. 2019 May;30:215-224. doi: 10.1016/j.msard.2019.01.039. Epub 2019 Jan 24 Research into pathogenesis There are several ways of research open about the cause of MS, ranging from metabolic disregulations to external infections. Regarding the possibility of a viral cause, there are reports about monoclonal antibodies against EBV- infected B-cells which are an important clue over pathogenesis. These reports have been recently complemented by reported interactions between EBV and HERVs(Human endogenous retroviruses), and experiments in vitro showing how HERVs can activate microglia into an active state that produces demyelination. Research into pathogenesis focuses on explaining the ultimate causes of MS onset and progression, and explaining the heterogeneous behaviour Pathological research tries to obtain correlations for the observable biomarkers. Several important areas of study have been delimited, like Normal Appearing White Matter areas, which are the source of the lesions and under special MRI techniques like Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy have been found to have a similar molecular composition. Also some external agents can modify the disease course. Smoking is known to modify (for worse) the course of the disease, and recently this effect has been seen via MRI. An explanation of this effect could shed some light into the pathogenesis. Geographical Causes Extensive research on multiple sclerosis is being done on what parts of the world have higher rates of MS compared to other regions. Researchers have studied MS mortality statistics in various latitudes of the earth and the pattern shows that MS mortality rates are lowest in equatorial regions, which contain the countries, Ethiopia and Jamaica. It increases towards the north and south showing that the highest MS rate is at a latitude of around 60 degrees, which are the countries Orkney, Shetland Islands, and Oslo, Norway. The next step for researchers would be to consider what factors are different at the latitudes of 60 degrees and the equatorial regions and continue to narrow down their theories for the exact cause of MS. Heterogeneity Another important research field in MS is over its heterogeneity. There are also some reports considering that several disease entities are confused into the same clinical entity \\"multiple sclerosis\\". For example, neuromyelitis optica, formerly considered a kind of MS, was separated in 2006 with the discovery of AQP4-IgG, and currently a second variant has been separated, antiMOG associated encephalomyelitis and a third one was separated as anti- neurofascin disease. This research is not closed and some other conditions could be separated from MS following the discovery of specific pathogens. MS has been historically a clinically defined entity including several atypical presentations. Some auto-antibodies have been found in atypical MS cases, giving birth to separate disease families and restricting the previously wider concept of MS. The research in MS heterogeneity is trying to set apart all the pathogenically unrelated conditions that are currently included in the spectrum. It is an ongoing research and the list of separated conditions could grow in the future. First of all, anti-AQP4 autoantibodies were found in neuromyelitis optica (NMO), which was previously considered a MS variant. After that, a whole spectrum of diseases named NMOSD (NMO spectrum diseases) or anti-AQP4 diseases has been accepted. Later, it was found that some cases of MS were presenting anti-MOG autoantibodies, mainly overlapping with the Marburg variant. Anti-MOG autoantibodies were found to be also present in ADEM, and now a second spectrum of separated diseases is being considered. At this moment, it is named inconsistently across different authors, but it is normally something similar to anti-MOG demyelinating diseases. Finally, a third kind of auto-antibodies is accepted. They are several anti-neurofascin auto-antibodies which damage the Ranvier nodes of the neurones. These antibodies are more related to the peripheral nervous demyelination, but they were also found in chronic progressive PPMS and combined central and peripheral demyelination (CCPD, which is considered another atypical MS presentation). Other auto-antigens are under study, like GDP-L-fucose synthase , reported in a subset of MS patients It is currently unknown if it is pathogenic or a side effect of the disease. Other example could be a new kind of multiple sclerosis without white matter demyelination that affects 12% of the patients and could behave differently from the rest of patients Later its existence was confirmed (2018) Besides all this autoantibodies found, four different patterns of demyelination have been reported in MS, opening the door to consider MS as an heterogeneous disease. HERVs Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) have been reported in MS for several years. In fact, one of the families, Human Endogenous Retrovirus-W was first discovered while studying MS patients. Recent research as of 2019 point to one of the HERV-W viruses (pHEV-W), and specifically one of the proteins of the viral capside that has been found to activate microglia in vitro. Activated microglia in turn produces demyelination. Some interactions between the Epstein-Barr virus and the HERVs could be the trigger of the MS microglia reactions.

However, it is hard to predict how these future discoveries will impact clinical practice or research for new drugs and treatments. An example of a soon-to-be finished study is the Wellcome Trust case control consortium, a collaboration study including 120,000 genetic samples, of which 8000 are from individuals with MS. This study may presumably identify all the common genetic variants involved in MS. Further studies will probably involve full genome sequencing of large samples, or the study of structural genetic variants such as insertions, deletions or polymorphisms. Genetic factors are the primary cause to the more rapid progression and frequency of the disease. Although genetics is linked to multiple sclerosis, most of the prime perceptivity of the linkage has not been fully characterized as there has not been a big enough sample size available for the research needed. Some genetic mutations have been associated with an increased risk to develop MS, like STK11-SNP. The chronic demyelination may cause axons to be notably vulnerable to repetitive and increasing injury and destruction. Progressive variants Cortical atrophy and demyelination along the subpial surface appear early in the disease course but accelerate in progressive stage. Inflammatory infiltrates appear in the meninges, in some cases with B cell follicles. Leptomeningeal enhancement under MRI is common in patients with progressive forms of MS and shows a relationship to subpial cortical lesions and cortical atrophy.

She was the lead ship of her class, which included a second ship, . Prinz Adalbert was built at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel. Her keel was laid in April 1900, and she was launched in June 1901. Her completion in January 1904 had been delayed by a surplus of construction projects at the Imperial Dockyard. She was armed with a main battery of four guns, a significant improvement over the previous armored cruiser, , which carried only two guns. The ship was capable of a top speed of . Upon commissioning, Prinz Adalbert served as a gunnery training ship, a role she held for the majority of her career. She trained with the Heimatflotte (Home Fleet), later renamed the Hochseeflotte (High Seas Fleet), throughout the early 1900s, and she made several visits to foreign countries. After the outbreak of World War I in July 1914, she was assigned to the reconnaissance forces in the Baltic and was tasked with protecting the German coast from Russian attacks. After her sister ship was sunk in November 1914, she became the flagship of the cruiser squadron in the Baltic. She conducted operations against Russian forces, including bombarding the port of Libau in support of the German Army. She was torpedoed by a British submarine in July 1915, but was able to return to port and was repaired. She was torpedoed a second time on 23 October 1915; the torpedo detonated her ammunition magazines and destroyed the ship. She sank quickly with heavy loss of life; only three men were rescued from a crew of 675. This proved to be the worst German naval disaster in the Baltic during the war. Design Line-drawing of Prinz Adalbert; the shaded areas represent the portions of the ship protected by armor Prinz Adalbert was the second member of the , which were ordered under the Second Naval Law of 1900. The law called for a force of fourteen armored cruisers that would be able to serve in Germany's colonial empire and scout for the main German fleet in home waters. The need to fill both roles was the result of budgetary limitations, which prevented Germany from building vessels specialized to each task. The Prinz Adalbert design was based on that of the previous armored cruiser, , which incorporated a more powerful armament and more comprehensive armor protection. Prinz Adalbert displaced as built and fully loaded. She had an overall length of , a beam of and a draft of forward. She was powered by three vertical triple-expansion steam engines, with steam provided by fourteen coal-fired water-tube boilers. The engines were rated to produce for a maximum speed of , though she slightly exceeded these figures on speed trials. She carried up to of coal, which enabled a maximum range of up to at a cruising speed of . The ship's crew consisted of 35 officers and 551 enlisted men. She was armed with four guns arranged in two twin-gun turrets, one on either end of the superstructure, a significant improvement over Prinz Heinrich, which carried only two guns in single turrets. Her secondary armament consisted of ten 15 cm (5.9 in) guns in individual casemate mounts. For defense against torpedo boats, she carried a battery of twelve guns, also in individual mounts. She was also equipped with four underwater torpedo tubes, one in the bow, one in the stern, and one on each broadside. The ship was protected by a armored belt consisting of Krupp cemented armor, along with an armored deck that was thick. Her main battery turrets had faces thick and her conning tower had an equal amount of armor on its sides. Service history Prinz Adalbert was ordered under the provisional name \\"B\\" and built at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel under construction number 27. Her keel was laid in April 1900 and she was launched on 22 June 1901. The launching ceremony was attended by the Kaiser, Wilhelm II, his wife Kaiserin Augusta Victoria, his brother Admiral Prince Heinrich and Wilhem's son, Prince Adalbert of Prussia. The ceremony of christening the ship was performed by Princess Irene of Prussia, wife of Prince Heinrich, who then delivered a speech. Fitting-out work proceeded slowly, in large part the result of the Imperial Dockyard attempting to build too many ships at once, but the work was eventually completed by 12 January 1904. Prinz Adalbert was commissioned into the Imperial German Navy the same day for sea trials, with Kapit√§n zur See (Captain at Sea) Hermann Jacobsen in command; the ship was slated for service as a gunnery training ship. She had cost the Imperial German Government 16,371,000 Goldmarks. Sea trials were completed by 30 May, after which Prinz Adalbert began her duties as a gunnery training ship. In September, the ship took part in the annual autumn maneuvers with the rest of the Heimatflotte (Home Fleet). A special training unit consisting of reserve ships, training ships like Prinz Adalbert, and a flotilla of torpedo boats was created in early 1905; Prinz Adalbert was the flagship of the unit from 1905 to 1907, flying the flag of Konteradmiral (Rear Admiral) Hugo Zeye. Prinz Adalbert and the light cruiser escorted Kaiser Wilhelm II's yacht Hohenzollern to Sweden for a visit to King Oscar II in July 1905. The following month, she joined the light cruisers and for training maneuvers off Swinem√ºnde; the exercises were to test the ships against a simulated night attack by torpedo boats. The tests were observed by Konteradmiral Ludwig Schr√∂der, the Inspector of Naval Weapons, aboard Prinz Adalbert. Wilhelm II boarded Prinz Adalbert for the conclusion of the exercises, in which the ship towed an old torpedo boat filled with cork while the light cruisers and torpedo boats fired on it with live shells. Prinz Adalbert did not participate in the 1905 autumn maneuvers, though she was present for the naval review at the end of the exercises on 13 September. In February 1906, the tender was assigned to support Prinz Adalbert. From 17 to 28 June, the cruiser served as the flagship of Prince Heinrich, then the commander of the Baltic Sea Naval Station. During this period the ship traveled to Norway to take part in the coronation festivities for King Haakon VII. The cruiser again took part in the autumn maneuvers in 1907 and 1909. During the latter maneuvers, Prinz Adalbert took part in the Reserve Division, commanded again by Zeye, who had now been promoted to Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral). The ship served as the flagship of the III Scouting Group, under Konteradmiral Johannes Merten, who would go on to command the Ottoman fortifications at the Dardanelles during World War I. In March 1910 and March 1911, Prinz Adalbert conducted gunnery tests in the northern North Sea and visited T√≥rshavn and Vestmanna in the Faeroe Islands. She visited √Ölesund in Norway in July and August that year. The ship's first period in service came to an end in September, following a large naval review in the Kiel roadstead for Wilhelm II and Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, which began on 5 September. Prinz Adalbert was then decommissioned in Kiel on the 29th, with the armored cruiser taking her place as the fleet's gunnery training ship. After a lengthy overhaul, Prinz Adalbert returned to service on 1 November 1912, again with the artillery school. She was based in Sonderburg, where she replaced the armored cruiser Prinz Heinrich. World War I Map of the North and Baltic Seas in 1911 At the outbreak of World War I in July 1914, Prinz Adalbert was brought into front-line service with the fleet, and Kapit√§n zur See Andreas Michelsen took command of the ship. She was assigned to the IV Scouting Group, under the command of Konteradmiral Hubert von Rebeur-Paschwitz. On 26 August, she was sent to rescue the light cruiser , which had run aground earlier that day, though she was recalled after the Germans received word that Magdeburgs crew had been forced to scuttle the ship. Prinz Adalbert was transferred to the North Sea on 7 September and was tasked two days later with protecting the minelaying cruisers and and the auxiliary minelayer Kaiser while they laid a minefield to protect the southern entrance to the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal. The ship was briefly detached to guard the Great Belt after the Germans received false intelligence suggesting that British warships would try to penetrate the Baltic. She then joined the High Seas Fleet for a sortie into the North Sea on 2‚Äì4 November. After her sister ship was sunk in November 1914, Prinz Adalbert was detached from the IV Scouting Group to replace her in the Coastal Defense Division in the Baltic on 29 November. She became the flagship for Admiral Ehler Behring, the commander of the cruiser detachment in the Baltic, on 7 December. On the 15th, she sortied with the light cruisers , , , and and several torpedo boats for a reconnaissance sweep toward the √Öland Islands; the ships returned to port on 18 December without having engaged Russian forces. Another sweep followed on 27‚Äì29 December, this time to cover a sortie by the of the V Battle Squadron toward Gotland. On 6 January 1915, Prinz Adalbert, Thetis, Augsburg, L√ºbeck, and several torpedo boats and U-boats went on a patrol toward Ut√∂, where they discovered a Russian base for submarines. The Germans planned to attack the base with the torpedo boats and Thetis, since she had the shallowest draft, but due to a miscommunication, the attack was not carried out. On 22 January 1915, Prinz Adalbert, in company with Augsburg and several torpedo boats, conducted another reconnaissance sweep toward the √Öland Islands. While on the return voyage, she bombarded Russian positions at Libau. She ran aground off Steinort during the operation, and Augsburg struck a mine off Bornholm. After being freed from her grounding, the ship was repaired; Michelsen temporarily served as the detachment commander in place of Behring from 13 February to 9 March, when the ship was ready to return to service. Behring returned to Prinz Adalbert on 20 March. In the meantime, the Russians had briefly captured Memel. The Admiralstab (Admiralty Staff) detached the II Battle Squadron, II Scouting Group, and two flotillas of torpedo boats from the High Seas Fleet to reinforce the forces in the Baltic. The ships began to make diversionary attacks to support the German Army's campaign to retake Memel; Prinz Adalbert supported one such operation, a raid of the II Scouting Group into the Bothnian Sea to attack Russian merchant shipping on 23 March. The following day, the ships from the High Seas Fleet were recalled to the North Sea, leaving Behring's cruisers alone once again. Behring conducted one last operation from 13 to 17 April, with Prinz Adalbert, Thetis, and L√ºbeck, to support the minelayer , which laid a minefield off Dag√∂. On the 20th, the Admiralstab instituted a reorganization of the Baltic Sea forces, and Behring was replaced with Konteradmiral Albert Hopman. At the same time, Michelsen was promoted to Hopman's chief of staff, with his place as Prinz Adalberts commanding officer being taken by Kapit√§n zur See Wilhelm Bunnemann. The ship remained the flagship of the unit, and Hopman made his first cruise aboard the vessel from Kiel to Danzig on 27 April. At this time, Generalfeldmarschall (General Field Marshal) Paul von Hindenburg, the commander in chief of German forces on the Eastern Front, ordered a major assault on Libau. Hopman ordered his forces to support an attempt by the German Army to seize the city. The pre-dreadnoughts of the IV Battle Squadron and the IV Scouting Group were allocated to Hopman's command to provide additional support to the operation. The attack took place on 7 May, and consisted of Prinz Adalbert and the armored cruisers and Prinz Heinrich, the elderly coast defense ship , and the cruisers Augsburg, Thetis, and L√ºbeck. They were escorted by a number of destroyers, torpedo boats, and minesweepers. The bombardment went as planned, though the destroyer struck a mine in Libau's harbor, which blew off her bow and destroyed the ship. German ground forces were successful in their assault and they took the city. On 1 July, the minelayer , escorted by the cruisers Roon, Augsburg, and L√ºbeck and seven destroyers, laid a minefield north of Bogsk√§r. While returning to port, the flotilla separated into two sections; Augsburg, Albatross, and three destroyers made for Rixh√∂ft while the remainder of the unit went to Libau. Augsburg and Albatross were intercepted by a powerful Russian squadron commanded by Rear Admiral Bakhirev, consisting of three armored and two light cruisers. Commodore Johannes von Karpf, the flotilla commander, ordered the slower Albatross to steam for neutral Swedish waters and recalled Roon and L√ºbeck. Albatross was grounded off Gotland and Augsburg escaped, and the Russian squadron briefly engaged Roon before both sides broke contact. Upon being informed of the situation, Hopman sortied with Prinz Adalbert and Prinz Heinrich to support von Karpf. While en route, the cruisers encountered the British submarine , which scored a hit on Prinz Adalbert. The torpedo hit below the conning tower, caused severe damage, and killed ten men. Hopman transferred to the torpedo boat while Michelsen remained aboard Prinz Adalbert to oversee the return to port. The ship took on some of water; her draft increased significantly, which prevented her from being able to put into Danzig. She instead had to make the journey back to Kiel for repairs, which she reached on 4 July. Repairs were finally completed by September 1915. On 21 September, Prinz Adalbert joined a sortie to the Gulf of Finland with the battleships , , , , and and the light cruiser . They encountered no Russian forces and returned to port on the 23rd. Another operation followed on 5 October; this was in company with Prinz Heinrich and Bremen, and was to cover a minelayer as it laid a field to the northwest of √ñstergarn. The ships completed their mission the next day and returned to port without incident. On 19 October, Hopman transferred his flag to Roon and ordered Prinz Adalbert to take up a patrol between F√•r√∂ and Dagerort. The ship was steaming some 20 miles west of Libau, en route to her patrol area, in company with a pair of destroyers on 23 October when she was intercepted by the submarine . E8 fired a spread of torpedoes at a range of approximately 1,200 m (1,300 yd), detonating the ship's ammunition magazine. The massive explosion destroyed the ship, which sank immediately with the loss of 672 crew. There were only three survivors. The sinking was the greatest single loss of life for the German Baltic forces during the war.

The Socialist Youth (JS) is a political organization that emerges as a youth party of the Socialist Party. It is integrated, politically and ideologically, into democratic socialism and social-democracy). It is made up of young people over 14 and under 30, Portuguese or resident in Portugal. At the moment this organization is directed by Maria Begonha, chosen in the XXI National Congress of the JS, that was realized in Almada in December 2018. It is a political organization of young Portuguese who accept the political platform approved in Congress, the Declaration of Principles and Program of the Socialist Party, with the aim of building a more just and solidary society in Portugal. The Socialist Youth finds in this political and ideological current a progressive project of social transformation, centered on the values of Equality, Solidarity and Freedom.  Values  Composed of young people who say they are dissatisfied with the world in which they live, this organization defends a society free of injustices, inequalities and poverty that knows how to respect and be tolerant of differences. They are fighting for a society where development is sustainable and therefore respects and protects the environment. It seeks a thriving and culturally advanced society capable of ensuring quality education, quality health care, social protection and rights- based employment for all. The young socialists are internationalists and radicals in the defense of peace. It is for this reason that the political intervention of this organization also goes through the search for and defense of an alternative to a world marked by inequality, poverty and war.  Ends  The Socialist Youth is a political youth organization that strives for the implementation of the values of democratic socialism and of the Republic, aiming for a freer, fairer and more solidary society, respecting the principles of respect for the dignity of the human person, pluralism of expression and internal and external democracy. The Socialist Youth strive to correct social inequalities by implementing a political platform that promotes the integration of individuals into the community in which they live, regardless of their ancestry, gender, age, ethnicity, sexual orientation, language, origin, religion, political, philosophical or ideological convictions, education or economic situation. The action of the Socialist Youth aims at the internationalization of democratic socialism. The Socialist Youth contribute to the peaceful resolution of any international conflicts, as well as to safeguarding the right of self-determination of all peoples. The Socialist Youth condemns and fights against any form of armed aggression or terrorist practice, regardless of its ideological or political support. The Socialist Youth is committed to the construction of a European Union that takes international responsibility for the values and democratic principles that guide the Peoples of Europe and the Portuguese Republic. The Socialist Youth contribute to the formation, participation and political representation of the Portuguese youth.  Structures of the Socialist Youth  Local and National Intervention JS operates locally, through its Concelhias structures. These, in turn, are organized into 21 District and Regional Federations.  Autarchic Intervention  In addition to these structures, the National Association of Young Socialist Authors (ANJAS) coordinates the work of local elected officials in the parishes and municipalities, disseminating good practices and assisting political coordination at the level of local power.  Organization of Socialist Students  The National Organization of Socialist Students (OES) is the representative structure of all students affiliated to the Socialist Youth and organizes itself in school, federative and national structures. As a result of the statutory changes introduced at the end of 2014, the structure merges into the same organization the former National Organization of Socialist Students of Higher Education (ONESES) and the National Organization of Socialist Students of Basic and Secondary Education (ONESEBS). The OES is responsible for pronouncing on the general lines of orientation and political intervention of the JS in the areas of Educational Policy, contributing to the articulation of the national intervention of the JS in Educational Institutions, namely through the formulation of proposals to the other organs of the Socialist Youth and manage the national network of Federations and Nuclei of Socialist Students. The Nucleus of Socialist Students (NES) aims to represent the Socialist Youth in the institutions of Education where they are inserted, namely by stimulating the political debate and the diffusion of the program and decisions of the Socialist Youth. On the other hand, each NES is free to promote the activities that it deems appropriate, as well as to pronounce itself on the subjects related to the Establishment where it is inserted, in articulation with OES and with its Federation, when it exists.  Trade Union Intervention  More recently, JS has created its Young Socialist Tendency, seeking to integrate into a national structure the nuclei in the area of employment and trade unionism.  International intervention  On the external front, JS is a founding member of the European organization of young socialists ECOSY (now called YES - Young European Socialists), and is particularly committed to deepening the European project and strengthening its democratic and social components. Working in support of an international order based on the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, JS is also a member of the IUSY - International Union of Socialist Youth and has reinforced its intervention in cooperation between organizations of Portuguese-speaking countries and the Ibero-American space .

The len was changed to an amt (district) in 1662 but it kept its original name and capital until 1919.  History  Formerly, in Norway, the term len (plural len) represents an administrative region whose borders roughly match those of the counties of today. It was an essential part of the national administration during the years when the two kingdoms of Denmark and Norway were united as a single kingdom. At the beginning of the 16th century the political divisions were variable but, since 1503, there were four main slottslen (castle provinces), each with about 30 smaller sub-divisions. They were: {valign=top* Akershus |valign=top* B√•hus |valign=top* Bergenhus |valign=top* Trondheim (with Northern Norway) |} Until 1660, their headquarters were, respectively, Akershus Fortress, Bohus Fortress, Bergenhus Fortress and the fortified city of Trondheim. The sub-divisions corresponded to the present church districts of the Lutheran Church of Norway. In 1536, North Norway was added to the len of Bergenhus but the len still had about 30 sub-divisions. In 1560, they were: {valign=top* Lister (now Lista) (Eastern half of Vest- Agder) * Stavanger (including Rogaland) * Lofoten and Vester√•len |valign=top* Lyster (now Luster) * Nordfjord * Sunnm√∏re |valign=top* Helgeland * Salten * Hardanger |valign=top* Andenes (And√∏ya) * Senja (South Troms) * Troms (Middle and North Troms) |valign=top* Vard√∏hus (including Finnmark). |} They covered the areas of the modern Vestland county (previously Hordaland and Sogn og Fjordane). Trondheim and North Norway were still parts of the Bergenhus len. Since then, the number of the len's sub-divisions was gradually reduced as the provincial and national administrations both became more stable. By 1660, Bergenhus was one of Norway's nine main len, each with 17 sub-divisions. On 19 February 1662, by royal decree, all the len, including Bergenhus, were renamed as amt (plural amt), and their lenmann were recast as the amtmann, both from Amt, the German word for \\"office\\", reflecting the bias of the Danish court of that year. In 1671, Norway was divided once more, this time into four principal amt or stiftsamt and nine subordinate amt. Bergenhus amt was the stiftsamt and its subordinate amt were Halsn√∏y klostergods, Hardanger amt and Nordlandene amt. In 1763, Bergenhus was divided in two, creating the following amt ‚Äì Nordre Bergenhus amt and S√∏ndre Bergenhus amt.

Biography  Originally from Salem, Ohio, Beeson was the seventh-born child of Samuel and Martha Beeson. The family moved to Marshalltown, Iowa shortly after his birth. In 1866 the 18-year-old Beeson left Marshalltown and headed west to Texas, where he found employment as a cowboy. Years later, Charles Goodnight would say of Beeson: \\"He was the best cowboy on the trail ... could stampede or quiet a herd quicker than any rustler I ever met.\\"Beeson Collection, Boot Hill Museum, Inc., Dodge City, Kansas. During 1872 the 24-year-old Beeson was living in Colorado. He worked, for a time, as a guide to buffalo hunters, with his clients including Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich of Russia, Phil Sheridan, and George Custer.  Life in Colorado  When the hunt ended, Beeson returned to Pueblo, Colorado where he participated in many civic activities. He was a member of the volunteer fire department and also Pueblo's baseball team. For employment, he drove a stagecoach between Denver and Colorado Springs. By 1875 Beeson grew bored with Pueblo and relocated to the three-year-old town of Dodge City, Kansas.  Marriage  In 1876, Chalk Beeson returned home to Marshalltown, Iowa, where he married 22-year-old Ida Gause on July 17, 1876. The newlyweds intended to locate in Kansas City, Missouri. Before they could do so, Chalk had to return to Dodge City to collect money owed him by A.J. Peacock, the owner of the Billiard Hall Saloon. Peacock was unable to pay Beeson in cash and handed him the deed to the establishment as payment.  Dodge City Saloon owner  Ida Beeson had to adjust to the fact that her husband was a Dodge City saloon owner. She was able to take some comfort in the fact that her husband provided an alternative to \\"entertainment\\" usually provided by frontier saloons ‚Äì namely prostitutes. What Beeson provided may not have been as exciting to a Texas cowboy just arriving from a long drive, but it was certainly more cultural. Chalk Beeson offered a full orchestra. Beeson changed the name of his business to the Saratoga Saloon. According to a local paper: \\"It is a rare treat to drop in at the Saratoga upon Mr. Beeson, and listen to his last and best musical combination. Mr. Beeson is a thorough lover of good music, and by his skillful selection of good performers ... draws crowds of attentive listeners.\\"Dodge City Times, September 29, 1877.  Long Branch Saloon  Encouraged by his success with the Saratoga, Beeson decided to take a chance on another saloon. The Long Branch Saloon had been founded early in 1873 by Charles E. Bassett and A.J. Peacock. The saloon changed hands several times. On March 1, 1878, Beeson purchased the Long Branch from the firm of Dexter D. Colley and James M. Manion. Soon after purchasing the Long Branch, Beeson took William H. Harris as his partner. Also with Harris, Beeson established the COD Cattle Ranch, south of Dodge City. During the next several years, the firm of Beeson & Harris became a minor conglomerate whose holdings were located in such far- flung locations as Las Animas, Colorado and Tombstone, Arizona.Young, Fredric R. Dodge City: Up through a Century in Story and Pictures. Dodge City: Boot Hill Museum, Inc., 1972, p. 119. After owning it for five years, Beeson grew bored with the Long Branch and sold his share of the business to Luke Short on February 6, 1883.Ford County Globe (Dodge City), February 6, 1883. In 1884 Beeson purchased a farm some two miles from Dodge City and moved his family there.  Dodge City Cowboy Band  In 1884 Beeson formed the \\"Dodge City Cowboy Band. The group was well received wherever it played. The band members cut dashing figures in full \\"cowboy\\" regalia ‚Äì enormous white stetsons, blue flannel shirts and boots festooned with ornamental spurs. Their fame finally spread far enough that they were featured performers in the March 4, 1889, inaugural parade of President Benjamin Harrison. The parade marked the Dodge City Band's finest hour, and also their final hour. Soon after their return to Dodge City, Beeson sold the ownership of the band to a man from Colorado. The transaction included most of the musical instruments and the right to use the name ‚Äì all for a purchase price of $750.  Sheriff of Ford County, Kansas  In November 1891, 43-year-old Chalk Beeson was elected sheriff of Ford County, Kansas. On November 1, 1892, Oliver Yantis and two accomplices robbed a Speareville, Kansas bank of $1,697. After Yantis was identified as being in Oklahoma, Sheriff Beeson journeyed there and secured a warrant for him. On November 30, 1892, Beeson, accompanied by three Oklahoma lawmen, tracked Yantis to the residence where he was hiding. A gunfight with the posse followed in which Yantis was mortally wounded.Hunt, Daniel D. and Snell, Joseph W. \\"Who Killed Oliver Yantis?,\\" True West, January‚ÄìFebruary, 1966. Beeson served two terms as sheriff with distinction and left office in 1896. For the remainder of his life, Beeson concentrated on his cattle ranching. He was occasionally called upon for public service and served four separate terms in the Kansas State legislature between 1903 and 1908.  Death and legacy  On the morning of Tuesday, August 6, 1912, with routine ranch chores to attend to, Chalk mounted a horse that was unusually skittish. When he attempted to dismount, the horse bucked and sent Beeson flying. On Friday, August 9, 1912 Chalk Beeson died. His family managed to keep his memory alive for decades after his death. In 1915 his sons, Merritt and Otero, opened the Beeson Theater on First Avenue in Dodge City. His widow, Ida Beeson, remained a prominent member of Dodge City society until her death on June 15, 1928. In 1932, Merritt Beeson opened the Beeson Museum, which became a popular tourist attraction. After Merritt Beeson died on January 28, 1956 his widow managed the museum until 1964, when its large collection of historic documents, photos and artifacts were sold to Dodge City's Boot Hill Museum, Inc.

Aggregates are quarried nearby and Porthoustock beach is dominated by a large concrete stone mill. The mill was once used to crush stone but is now disused. Coastal trading ships of up to can dock alongside the wharf along the southern edge of the beach to be loaded with stone. Fishing boats operate from the shingle beach, with lobster and crab potting, net fishing and long lining as the principal fishing methods. The South West Coast Path passes through Porthoustock. Porthoustock lies within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). Almost a third of Cornwall has AONB designation, with the same status and protection as a National Park. History Porthoustock originated as a fishing hamlet. However, from the 1890s the village developed as a port for the local stone quarries. There has been quarrying activity in Porthoustock since the late 19th century. By the 1940s the quarries were owned by Amalgamated Roadstone and provided stone to build Cornwall's wartime airfields. Porthoustock survived a German bombing raid in November 1940 with no casualties. Porthoustock's proximity to The Manacles, a set of treacherous rocks which extend about east and south east of Manacle Point means that it has been the location for numerous shipwrecks. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) stationed a lifeboat at Porthoustock in 1869 and built a boat house by the beach. The station was closed in 1942 and has since become the village hall. The last boat stationed here was the Kate Walker which arrived in 1931. After it was sold in 1946 it was converted to a yacht and was reported as being at Felixstowe Ferry in 2007. Geology Analcime, analcite, epidote, hornblende, prehnite, calcite, diorite and pectolite are all minerals extracted from the quarries in Porthoustock. A natural rock formation known as the Giant's Quoits stands on the cliffs above Porthoustock. The rocks once stood on Manacle Point but were moved to their current position in 1967 due to the expansion of the quarries. The cliffs and quarries to the south of the hamlet are designated as part of Coverack to Porthoustock SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest) for their geological interest. Economy Aram Resources' West of England Quarry is situated adjacent to Porthoustock village. The quarry works a dark green diorite rock mass and has its own wharf allowing the loading of aggregates directly from the quarry to ships. The wharf is protected from the prevailing southwesterly Atlantic weather systems, ensuring minimal disruption to ship loading. Diving Porthoustock is a popular launching beach for divers en route to The Manacles and instruction in diving is available.Clegg, David (2005) Cornwall & the Isles of Scilly.

There is also a membership group within the afrosphere that is called the AfroSpear, which includes over one hundred and fifty Black blogs. History The genesis of the AfroSpear/afrosphere movement can attributed to the involvement of many bloggers of African descent, and their blogs and websites throughout the African Diaspora. In the first months of 2007, Black bloggers such as AfroNetizen, African American Political Pundit, Jack and Jill Politics, Black Commentator Booker Rising, Prometheus 6, Mirror on America and Francis L. Holland had for many months expressed the need for inclusion of black bloggers into the majority blogosphere discussion on all issues impacting Americans. White bloggers in many ways refused to hear the outcry of black bloggers for participation and inclusion and even met in the middle of an historic black community of Harlem, N.Y. with former President Bill Clinton, to discuss politics, without including a single Black blogger. Members of the white blogosphere coming into the Black community, and only inviting one Black person, (who was not able to attend for personal reasons) was considered by many Black bloggers an insult to Black bloggers and their communities. The picture of all white bloggers in Harlem, with Bill Clinton talking politics, when black voters are a critical base of the Democratic Party insulted black bloggers from the conservative La Shawn Barber, the Moderate The Republic of T and the liberal Steve Gillard and The Culture Kitchen created early discussions for a chain of change in the Blogosphere. Enter Black Internet social and political activist Francis L. Holland, who wrote a groundbreaking post in MyDD: Blackosphere & Whitosphere: Silence is Never Golden on February 15, 2007 which provided additional emphasis for a coming together point for bloggers of African descent to further discuss issues of importance to the African diaspora in a collective manner. His article entitled \\"White-News\\" vs. the Blackosphere\\" became the hot topic of conversation in the Black blogger community. The term \\"whitosphere\\" to refer to the white blogosphere, made popular by Francis L. Holland, is still used today. Bloggers like The Field Negro, Jack and Jill Politics, African American Political Pundit, Asabagna, Aulelia, P6, Skeptical Brotha, Republic of T, BygBaby, Culture Kitchen, Angie, The Free Slave, and many other bloggers continued the discussions at the Republic of T's blog after his blog post \\"The Republic of T. Blogging While Brown, Part III\\" on March 30, 2007 with Black bloggers, Rikyrah, ecthompson, Electronic Viillage, Mark Bey, Dr. Lester Spence, Bronze Trinity and many other bloggers contributing to the discussion. Through further discussions on other Black blogger platforms such as The Free Slave the AfroSpear name was agreed upon. The overall the origins of ‚ÄúAfroSpear‚Äù started from a discussion group of Black bloggers from around the world who had an interest in developing a community of African/Black progressive minded bloggers. The word AfroSpear came from black blogger discussions regarding a name for a group of Black bloggers who did not want to limit their engagement to the continent of the United States, but also wanted to connect with bloggers from throughout the African Diaspora. Seeing the need to water of the AfroSpear seed, and take it to the next level, a smaller ad hoc black blogger group moved forward and began planning beyond the creation of a name and concepts into a baseline model of the AfroSpear. It developed into an idea to create a diasporic-wide think tank type blog with six bloggers: three women and three men. The vision was that it would focus on discussing issues, exchanging ideas and creating strategies, with the objective of developing concrete and viable solutions to tackle the concerns relating to those of African descent worldwide. The 6 who initially started the AfroSpear blog had developed a relationship by exchanging ideas and having discussions and respectful debates on each other‚Äôs blogs. They didn‚Äôt always agree, but what they had in common was their love for their community and a commitment to the progress of those of African descent, both near and far. They came from 4 different countries on 3 continents. They brought a variety of experiences, perspectives, ideas, beliefs and values in an effort to foster understanding, wisdom, knowledge and strength. The Afrospear is a part of, connected to and add a collective voice to the variety of other Afrocentric/Black individuals, conglomerations and collectives out in the AfroSphere. To the best and the brightest for the progress of people of the African diaspora. Original moderators and Contributors of the Afrospear included, Adrianne, Asabagna, Aulelia, BelizeBound, Field Negro and Kizzie. The Afrospear and the afrosphere of bloggers worked on organizing The Jena 6, and Shaquanda Cotton and have helped spread word about the Jena6 while at the same time AfroSpear Members Mark Bey and Bronze Trinity organized the African American Bloggers Association and its Solutions Blog. On August 2, 2007, the Afrosphere Bloggers Association was launched as an organization to help the Black community to grow and prosper and became the first organisation to use the word in its company name. In 2007, bloggers, and podcasters of the Afrosphere played a significant role in publicising and organising activism in response to the Jena SixAfrosphere Bloggers Ask Media To Cover Jena Six Story ¬´ THE SOLUTIONS BLOG In 2008, the Democratic National Convention credentialed several AfroSpear and afrosphere bloggers to cover the Convention in Denver, Colorado.  Participation in the 2008 Democratic National Convention  On May 16, 2008, AfroSpear member Atty. Francis L. Holland broke the story of the Democratic National Convention's (DNC) virtually all-white state blog pool, where some 53 of 55 state blogs chosen to sit among the delegates on the floor of the Democratic National Convention were white, with only two Black or Latino blogs chosen. The DNC state blog corps story was first covered in the mainstream media by reporter Karen Brooks of the Dallas Morning News. Atty. Francis L. Holland and D. Yobachi Boswell, both coordinators of the Afrosphere Action Coalition issued a series of press releases and gave a series of interviews to the mainstream media on the issue, after which the story was covered in the Atlanta Journal Constitution, the Washington Post, USA Today, The Chicago Tribune, The San Francisco Chronicle, and Politico. Partly as a result of these actions, as well as a generalized afrosphere campaign of e-mail contact with the DNC and intense media attention, six AfroSpear blogs and an additional three afrosphere blogs that had applied for credentials were allowed to cover the 2008 Democratic National Convention as part of the Convention's \\"general pool\\" of blogs, but not as part of the state blog corps, which remains virtually all-white. DemConvention.Com AfroSpear blogs admitted to cover the 2008 Democratic National Convention in the general pool were L.N.

Biography Although records disagree about the year in which Hubert was born, his New York Times obituary places the date at December 25, 1884. Hubert was born to Zach and Camilla Hubert, African American farmers who owned several hundred acres of land in the northern part of Hancock County Georgia. The Huberts were surrounded by a dozen other black farm owning families. The community, called Springfield, built a church, a general store, and a rudimentary four-year grade school. To further educate their children, the Huberts sent the oldest children away to board in nearby schools, and ultimately sent all twelve of their children to college. After he graduated from college, Zach Hubert called his oldest son home to expand the grade school into a high school. As the sixth child, Benjamin Hubert benefited from this expansion. Like his brothers, he attended Atlanta Baptist (later known as Morehouse College). He earned a high school diploma and graduated with a B.A. in 1909. Afterward, he enrolled in the agricultural science program at Massachusetts Agricultural College where he studied under Kenyon Butterfield, a founder of rural sociology. Butterfield was a member of the Country Life Commission organized by President Theodore Roosevelt , and in 1919, Butterfield became the first president of the American Country Life Association. For the rest of his life, Hubert became involved in the Country Life Movement, which sought to find ways to make rural life more attractive to young people through scientific farming, cooperatives, and improved rural social institutions. This movement later informed the early agenda of agricultural extension in the U.S. Department of Agriculture when agricultural extension work was begun for white agents in 1902 and expanded to black agents in 1915. In 1912, Hubert took a position as professor of agriculture at South Carolina State Agricultural and Mechanical College at Orangeburg, (now South Carolina State University). He soon became director of Agricultural Extension at the college, and director of the agricultural department. At the outbreak of World War I, Hubert served on the South Carolina Food Administration Board and then went overseas to help direct the agricultural reconstruction of Europe. Upon returning to the U.S. in 1920, Hubert accepted the directorship of the Department of Agriculture at Tuskegee Institute. He soon became supervisor of the Negro Division of the Agricultural Extension Service for Alabama. There, he made contacts with the philanthropists who would help him in his next position as president of a small, struggling black college in Savannah, Georgia.Schultz, Mark, \\"Benjamin Hubert and the Association for the Advancement of Negro Country Life,\\" in Beyond Forty Acres and a Mule: African American Landowning Families Since Reconstruction.

Hubert and the Log Cabin Community,\\" M.A. thesis, University of Georgia, 1989, 1-47. President Hubert succeeded Cyrus G. Wiley as president of the college in 1926. Under his leadership the college became a full-time degree-granting institution as the high school and normal programs were disestablished. The school also became a full member institution of the University System of Georgia in 1932 and the name was changed to Georgia State College that same year. Hubert also used his relative proximity to Hancock County, Georgia, to attempt an experiment in rural community building along the themes of the Country Life Movement. In 1928, he organized the Association for the Advancement of Negro Country Life. With backing from northern philanthropists, he attempted to transform Springfield into a model black community, blending Butterfield's progressive rural idealism, the economic separatism of Marcus Garvey, and the apolitical pragmatism of Booker T. Washington. Under Hubert's guidance, the community organized a community health clinic, a cooperative community center, complete with swimming pool, a cooperative dairy and an enclosed poultry house. To maximize market efficiency, they bought seed and machinery cooperatively, and sold their agricultural products cooperatively. They attracted outstanding faculty to the high school and expanded it with grants from the Julius Rosenwald Foundation. At its height, eighty percent of the graduates of this high school continued on to college. Hubert used the community to host teacher training institutes for African American teachers in Georgia. In the end, these efforts were not enough to withstand the market forces which were pushing out small farmers. Also, they were a victim of their educational success. College graduates from Springfield tended to look for professional employment in the cities, not on the farms. And in 1947, Hubert retired from Georgia State College due to tensions over his autocratic administrative style. A couple years later, he suffered a debilitating stroke. Hubert died on April 30, 1958.Schultz, \\"Benjamin Hubert and the Association for the Advancement of Negro Country Life,\\" 88-105; Schultz, \\"A More Satisfying Life on the Farm\\", 47-161.

In Suriname, the Netherlands and Belgium, this position is often taken by well-known non-politicians such as artists, celebrities and sports people. They are officially a candidate, but they are put at the end of the party list (in an unelectable position) in a bid to attract more votes for the party and as a sign they endorse that specific party. In local elections, ordinary people who are well-known in the community might also act as lijstduwer. Since these electoral systems use open list party-list proportional representation, votes cast to the lijstduwer add up to the total number of votes, and hence seats for the party. The candidate is not likely to become member of the elected body due to the low placement on the list, and generally rejects the position if they gather enough preference votes for a full seat (which they can claim within the Dutch system). There can be more than one lijstduwer. How many members on the list can be considered lijstduwer varies. In the more broad definition, candidates who are lower on the list than the number of seats a party is likely to win, are considered lijstduwers. In Israel, which uses a closed list nationwide proportional representation system, the tradition of choosing elder statesmen and celebrities as candidates in the lowest places of the list also exists, but without a special term. Well-known national politicians can act as lijstduwer on the list for the European and municipal elections.

She sailed from 1894 until 1923, and was the first U.S. steamship to pass through the Suez Canal, as well as the first to circumnavigate the globe. Her radio call letters were GF and her signal letters KMCQ. Origin In the 1890s, Alexander McDougall, the originator of the whaleback ship design, wanted to build ships in Washington, on the Pacific Coast. His steamer (1891 ‚Äì 265 ft) became the first lake vessel to leave the Great Lakes when she took a load of grain from Duluth to Liverpool, England, shooting the St. Lawrence rapids in the process. Wetmore was sent around Cape Horn with a load of supplies for the establishment of a shipbuilding colony near Everett, Washington. From parts she carried, the City of Everett was built, commissioned in 1894. Intended to be the first of a line of whaleback ships built out of the facility in Everett, changing fortunes resulted in her being the only ship produced there by McDougall's ill-fated company. Her career The unarmed steamer ‚Äúcaptured‚Äù the City of Malaga, Spain, when it entered the harbor seeking fresh water, which occasioned a surrender by the city‚Äôs inhabitants during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War.The City of Everett underway On 8 September 1902, City of Everett suffered an explosion while loading at Port Arthur, Texas. Her captain, a mate, and several crew members were seriously injured; the resulting fire engulfed not only the ship, but also destroyed the docks and wharves of the Texas Company (later known as Texaco). In January 1905, City of Everett collided with the Norwegian steam freighter Leif Eriksson north of Charleston, South Carolina. Leif Eriksson took on water through a deep gash in her hull, and sank in less than 10 minutes with the loss of two lives. Near Nantucket on 23 January 1909, City of Everett heard a distress signal from the RMS Republic, which was taking on water following a collision. Captain Thomas Fenlon of the City of Everett twice offered his ship's considerable pumping and towing abilities, but with assistance reportedly on the way from the White Star Line, Republic declined.https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1909/01/27/101864346.pdf New York Times article, 26 January 1909 Could Have Saved Republic, He Says\\" Fog delayed tugs of the White Star Line, and towing efforts by the smaller US Coast Guard cutter Gresham failed. Republic sank the next day. Newspapers at the time reported that if the White Star Line had been successful in recovering the Republic with company ships, instead of using a third-party salvor, it could have recouped some of its salvage expenses from the owners of the recovered cargo aboard the Republic. The inference was that Republic's captain had refused aid merely to prevent another company from sharing the salvage award if the ship were to be saved. Everett's Captain Fenlon maintained that, as Republic had remained afloat until the day after the collision, she could have been saved if she had accepted a tow from City of Everett, stating that his boat was \\"built for ocean towing\\" and was equipped with \\"tremendously powerful machinery and towing cables seven inches (178 mm) in diameter\\", as well as pumps with a capacity of \\"two million gallons an hour\\". While carrying molasses from Santiago, Cuba to New Orleans on 11 October 1923, City of Everett foundered in the Gulf of Mexico. All 26 people on board died in the sinking. Discovery of the shipwreck City of Everett On September 11, 2010, divers from the Association of Underwater Explorers, Michael Barnette and Joe Citelli, identified the wreck of the City of Everett resting in approximately of sea water off Florida in the Gulf of Mexico.

The \\"Memoirs\\" bears the seeds of many successful later works borne out of the Club, such as Swift's Gulliver and Pope's Dunciad. Each chapter of the novel satirises a different fad or fashion of the period, mocking modern culture for its blind adherence both to new trends and outdated beliefs. The novel tells the story of Martinus Scriblerus' upbringing by his parents, who subject him to a range of strange customs such as refusing to allow his wet- nurse to eat beef and instead raising him solely on butter and honey, a diet supposedly advised by Eustathius.

ArcaEx, Putnams' company, was built to instantly look at the Arca exchange for best prices and if not matched then to route to the bourse that displayed the best price. When Putnam headed Arca's purchase of the Pacific Stock Exchange, he created the first ECN that was also a stock exchange. He also took Arca into options trading. John Thain, a perennial deal maker, did his first major deal since taking the helm at the NYSE when he merged with Arca. This merger caused the 212-year-old (at time of merger) NYSE to demutualize and make an initial public offering.

The station operates at the assigned frequency of 97.5 MHz and an equivalent radiated power of 50,000 watts. Its studios and offices are located in Ridgway Township, near the summit of Bootjack Mountain, about 3 miles south of downtown Ridgway and about 2 miles west of its city of license. Its transmitter site is located in Lamont, about 2.5 miles south of Kane, Pennsylvania. The station also uses a booster, WDDH-FM1 with 250 Watts at 171 feet AGL along South Highland Street in DuBois, about 20 miles south of the Ridgway studios. History: Beginnings as WKYN-FM The station first went on the air on April 22, 1986 as WKYN, and was founded by suburban Pittsburgh radio personality Bob Stevens, who had been looking to buy or build a radio station of his own in Western Pennsylvania. That opportunity presented itself in 1985, when he successfully applied for the license to operate at 97.5 FM, originally licensed to Ridgway. For the first three years, the studios and transmitter were located at the transmitter site in a remote, wooded area of Jones Township near Rasselas, Pennsylvania, with business and sales offices in downtown St Marys. Signals were radiated by a 4-bay, ERI \\"Rototiller\\" antenna atop a newly erected 535 foot tower. On several occasions, air staff were stranded at the studio/transmitter facility due to heavy snow accumulation and ice storms. In 1989, Stevens purchased a defunct drive-in theater south of St Marys, and consolidated both the studios and offices there. As the station grew, Stevens determined that the station would reach a significantly larger audience if the transmitter site was relocated to the west. Much of the original signal coverage area fell on a largely unpopulated area of north- central Pennsylvania known as \\"God's Country\\", and was spotty in several better-populated communities to the west. A new transmitter site south of Kane was found and construction was started. The STL path from the Fairview studios to the new transmitter site was not possible due to obstruction by Bootjack Mountain. Stevens renovated a vacant, former restaurant at the top of Bootjack Mountain to house the offices and studios, where they remain today at 14902 Bootjack Road. The old tower and transmitter plant in Jones Township were left standing, and purchased by a cellular phone service provider. Programming WKYN, billed as \\"97 KYN\\", signed on with an Adult CHR format. Stevens stuck with this formula for seven years, until the opportunity presented itself in 1993 to acquire WCCZ (now WPCL) in Spangler. WCCZ operated on the adjacent frequency of 97.3 and could be heard clearly in the more populous area of Johnstown, Pennsylvania. Stevens purchased WCCZ and changed the call letters to WXVE, turning it into a translator to extend WKYN's signal into the Johnstown market. At the time of the acquisition, WKYN became WKVE (an allusion to Pittsburgh's legendary AOR station WDVE) and the station changed format from Adult CHR to AOR, as there was no album rock formatted station in Johnstown at that time. In 1996, Stevens had the opportunity to buy a radio station closer to his hometown in Western Pennsylvania, purchasing WHJB (now WKHB) and WBCW (now WKFB) in Greensburg and Jeannette, respectively. WKYN was sold to Cam Communications, reverting to Adult CHR as \\"97.5 The Peak\\". Call letters were changed to WPKK. In 2001, Cam Communications sold WPKK to Laurel Media, Inc of Ridgway, a company owned by Dennis Heindl, who previously owned WLMI in Kane and held a construction permit for an FM station in Reynoldsville (now WDSN.) DDH are the initials of Dennis D. Heindl. A lifelong country music lover, Heindl converted the station format to Country. In 1999, ownership was transferred from Laurel Media Inc. to Intrepid Broadcasting owned by Michael Stapleford. In the Summer of 2008, ownership reverted to Laurel Media Inc. and Dennis D. Heindl. Heindl has kept the Country Format and has added ABC News and is host of the Award Winning Program \\"Talk Of The Town.\\" Lou Dobbs has appeared as Heindl's guest on \\"Talk Of The Town.\\" WDDH is known as \\"The Hound\\" and its logo is recognizable. The Hound carries Pittsburgh Pirate Baseball. Heindl is a part owner of the Pittsburgh Pirates.

Viterra Inc grew into a global agri-business with operations in Canada, the United States, Australia, New Zealand and China. Viterra operated three distinct, inter- related businesses: Grain Handling & Marketing, Agri-Products and Processing, enabling it to generate earnings at various points on the food production chain from field to the table. Following its $6.1-billion acquisition by Glencore International, on 1 January 2013 Viterra Inc was merged with Glencore purchaser, 8115222 Canada Inc. Viterra's grain handling and marketing operations were located primarily in two of the world's most fertile regions: Western Canada and South Australia. The company owns and operates grain terminals in Western Canada, along with 95% of the grain handling and storage facilities in South Australia. The company ships grain to markets worldwide. Viterra was also one of the largest agri-product retailers in Canada, with a network of more than 250 retail locations throughout the Prairies. As part of this business, Viterra owns a 34% interest in Canadian Fertilizer Limited CFI, a large urea and ammonia plant. The company also operates several value-added processing businesses, including wholly owned subsidiaries like Dakota Growers Pasta Company, 21st Century Grain, making it the largest producer of industrial oats in North America, the third largest producer of pasta on the continent, the largest malt producer in Australia, a large producer of canola and a leading producer of animal feed in New Zealand. At the time of the Glencore's March 2012 back-to-back purchase-and-agreement of Viterra's assets to Agrium, which paved the way for Glencore's purchase of Viterra, in December 2012, Viterra was generating \\"$2.4-billion in revenue and $244-million in EBITDA\\" and operated a \\"network of 258 agri-products retail locations throughout Western Canada and 17 retail locations in Australia. Retail locations offer fertilizer, crop protection products, seed and equipment to growers. Viterra also has a minority interest in a nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing plant in Medicine Hat, Alberta.\\"  History  Viterra Inc. was formed in 2007 as a publicly traded corporation when the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool acquired Agricore United, which was at that time the largest grain handler in Western Canada. Viterra's predecessors were the grain-trading co- operatives set up in Canada during the 1920s known as the wheat pools. It has since acquired the former Australian government-sponsored monopsony marketing board, the Australian Barley Board, created in 1939.  Mergers  Viterra building near Fort Road in Edmonton, Alberta. On 19 May 2009, Viterra announced it would buy Australian ABB Grain for C$1.4 billion. On 9 September, 84 percent of ABB shareholders voted in favour of the merger, with 75 percent required to pass the resolution. On March 15, 2012, Viterra announced that it had received takeover offers from multiple parties. Glencore was revealed to have offered a takeover bid of $6.1 billion. It intended to immediately sell off its Canadian assets to Agrium and Richardson International while retaining Viterra's overseas assets. The takeover deal was completed in December 2012. Following Glencore's takeover of Viterra in December 2012, Viterra underwent some major changes. Viterra Inc. (Viterra) was acquired by a Glencore purchaser, 8115222 Canada Inc. and merged under the Canada Business Corporations Act (CBCA). The new board of directors includes Mr. Chris Mahoney (Director of Agricultural Products of Glencore), Mr. Ernest Mostert (Financial Manager of Glencore Grain), Mr. Robert Wardell and Mr. Larry Ruud (President & CEO One Earth Farms Corp). In preparation for Glencore's acquisition of Viterra in December 2012, in March 2012 Agrium Inc entered into a $1.15bn sale agreement with Glencore, who in this way divested \\"90 percent of Viterra‚Äôs Canadian retail facilities, all of its Australian retail facilities, as well as their minority position in a nitrogen facility located in Medicine Hat, Alberta.\\" In 2016, Glencore sold a minority stake in the business to the Canada Pension Plan, who paid \\"US$2.5 billion for a 40 percent stake\\" in its global agricultural assets, by then renamed \\"Glencore Agri\\".

It is of particular note in two areas: in the politics of the Netherlands and Belgium and in the politics of the United States. Belgium and the Netherlands \\"Purple\\" () is the nickname of a government coalition of social democrats and liberals, excluding Christian democrats. It is derived from the combination of the colour of the social democrats (red) and liberals (blue). Both the Netherlands and Belgium have had such governments. In the Netherlands the two cabinets of Prime Minister Wim Kok (Kok I and Kok II, 1994‚Äì2002) were composed of social democrats (the Labour Party, PvdA), conservative liberals (People's Party for Freedom and Democracy, VVD) and progressive liberals (Democrats 66). In the 2010 Dutch cabinet formation the possibilities for a Purple-plus cabinet (the original \\"purple\\" coalition of PvdA, VVD, D66 plus GreenLeft) was investigated. Since 5 November 2012, following the 2012 Dutch general election, the VVD has been the senior partner in the second Rutte cabinet, a grand coalition Purple government with the PvdA. In October 2013 the Second Rutte cabinet (VVD and PvdA), which has no majority in the Senate, reached a budgetary agreement with D66 and the smaller Christian parties Christian Union (CU) and the Reformed Political Party (SGP). This occasional coalition is nicknamed \\"purple plus the Bible\\" (Paars met de Bijbel) as it includes the purple parties VVD, PvdA and D66 plus the Bible- minded parties CU and SGP. The term \\"purple plus the Bible\\" had already been used in February that year, when the same parties reached an agreement on modernising the housing market. Secretary of Financial Affairs, Jeroen Dijsselbloem (PvdA) now calls D66, CU and SGP his \\"most beloved opposition parties\\". The three parties are very influential on the policy of the Second Rutte cabinet, because without the support of the three parties, new parliamentary elections are inevitable. In the municipal elections of 19 March 2014 D66, CU and SGP did well. D66 for instance, became the biggest party in Amsterdam and The Hague, beating the PvdA. The CU became the biggest party in Zwolle, hometown of CU-leader Arie Slob. All three parties were rewarded for their so-called \\"constructive co-operation\\" with the cabinet. However, the coalition parties VVD and PvdA lost a lot of seats (PvdA lost its majority in Amsterdam, The Hague, Rotterdam, Groningen etc. and the VVD did equally bad). In Belgian politics, the term is used as a term for the two federal governments of Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt, from 1999 to 2008. These cabinets consisted of the Flemish and Francophone social-democratic parties (SP.A and PS) and the Flemish and Francophone liberal parties (Flemish Liberals and Democrats and the Liberal Reformist Party, which later became Open VLD and the Reformist Movement). The first government also included the Flemish and Francophone green parties Agalev and Ecolo. United States In the United States, a purple state is one where popular support for the Republican Party (red) and Democratic Party (blue) is approximately equal; such states, in elections for the President of the United States, are termed \\"swing states\\" and are highly targeted on account of the Electoral College system of electing the President of the United States. Purple states can also appear with the control of different branches. For example, a Democratic governor with Republican controlled state legislature, or a Republican governor with Democrat controlled state legislature.

Emotions are \\"internal phenomena that can, but do not always, make themselves observable through expression and behavior\\". While some emotions are universal and are experienced in similar ways as a reaction to similar events across all cultures, other emotions show considerable cultural differences in their antecedent events, the way they are experienced, the reactions they provoke and the way they are perceived by the surrounding society. According to other theories, termed social constructionist, emotions are more deeply culturally influenced. The components of emotions are universal, but the patterns are social constructions. Some also theorize that culture is affected by emotions of the people. Cultural studies of emotions Research on the relationship between culture and emotions dates back to 1872 when Darwin argued that emotions and the expression of emotions are universal. Since that time, the universality of the seven basic emotions (i.e., happiness, sadness, anger, contempt, fear, disgust, and surprise) has ignited a discussion amongst psychologists, anthropologists, and sociologists. While emotions themselves are universal phenomena, they are always influenced by culture. How emotions are experienced, expressed, perceived, and regulated varies as a function of culturally normative behavior by the surrounding society. Therefore, it can be said that culture is a necessary framework for researchers to understand variations in emotions. Pioneers In Darwin's opening chapter of The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, (1872/1998) Darwin considered the face to be the preeminent medium of emotional expression in humans, and capable of representing both major emotions and subtle variations within each one. Darwin's ideas about facial expressions and his reports of cultural differences became the foundation for ethological research strategies. Silvan Tomkins' (1962) Affect Theory 1963) built upon Darwin's research, arguing that facial expressions are biologically based, and universal manifestations of emotions. The research of Paul Ekman (1971) and Carroll Izard (1971) further explored the proposed universality of emotions, showing that the expression of emotions were recognized as communicating the same feelings in cultures found in Europe, North and South America, Asia, and Africa. Ekman (1971) and Izard (1971) both created sets of photographs displaying emotional expressions that were agreed upon by Americans. These photographs were then shown to people in other countries with the instructions to identify the emotion that best describes the face. The work of Ekman, and Izard, concluded that facial expressions were in fact universal, innate, and phylogenetically derived. Some theorists, including Darwin, even argued that \\"Emotion ... is neuromuscular activity of the face\\". Many researchers since have criticized this belief and instead argue that emotions are much more complex than initially thought. In addition to pioneering research in psychology, ethnographic accounts of cultural differences in emotion began to emerge. Margaret Mead, a cultural anthropologist writes about unique emotional phenomena she experienced while living among a small village of 600 Samoans on the island of Ta'u in her book Coming of Age in Samoa. Gregory Bateson, an English anthropologist, social scientist, linguist, and visual anthropologist used photography and film to document his time with the people of Bajoeng Gede in Bali. According to his work, cultural differences were very evident in how the Balinese mothers displayed muted emotional responses to their children when the child showed a climax of emotion. In displays of both love (affection) and anger (temper) Bateson's notes documented that mother and child interactions did not follow Western social norms. The fieldwork of anthropologist Jean Briggs details her almost two year experience living with the Utku Inuit people in her book Never in Anger: Portrait of an Eskimo Family. Briggs lived as the daughter of an Utku family describing their society as particularly unique emotional control. She rarely observed expressions of anger or aggression and if it were expressed, it resulted in ostracism. Scholars working on the history of emotions have provided some useful terms for discussing cultural emotion expression. Concerned with distinguishing a society's emotional values and emotional expressions from an individual's actual emotional experience, William Reddy has coined the term emotive. In The Making of Romantic Love, Reddy uses cultural counterpoints to give credence to his argument that romantic love is a 12th-century European construct, built in a response to the parochial view that sexual desire was immoral. Reddy suggests that the opposition of sexual ardor and true love was not present in either Heain Japan or the Indian kingdoms of Bengal and Orissa. Indeed, these cultures did not share the view of sexual desire as a form of appetite, which Reddy suggests was widely disseminated by the Church. Sexuality and spirituality were not conceived in a way which separated lust from love: indeed, sex was often used as a medium of spiritual worship, emulating the divine love between Krishna and Rada. Sexual desire and love were inextricable from one another. Reddy therefore argues that the emotion of romantic love was created in Europe in the 12th century, and was not present in other cultures at the time. Cultural norms of emotions Culture provides structure, guidelines, expectations, and rules to help people understand and interpret behaviors. Several ethnographic studies suggest there are cultural differences in social consequences, particularly when it comes to evaluating emotions. For example, as Jean Briggs described in the Utku Eskimo population, anger was rarely expressed, and in the rare occasion that it did occur, it resulted in social ostracism. These cultural expectations of emotions are sometimes referred to as display rules. Psychologists (Ekman & Friesen, 1969; Izard, 1980; Sarni, 1999) believe that these rules are learned during a socialization process. Ekman and Friesen (1975) have also suggested that these \\"unwritten codes\\" govern the manner in which emotions may be expressed, and that different rules may be internalized as a function of an individual's culture, gender or family background. Miyamoto & Ryff (2011) used the term cultural scripts to refer to cultural norms that influence how people expect emotions to be regulated. Cultural scripts dictate how positive and negative emotions should be experienced and combined. Cultural scripts may also guide how people choose to regulate their emotions which ultimately influences an individual's emotional experience. For example, research suggests that in Western cultures, the dominant social script is to maximize positive emotions and minimize negative emotions. In Eastern cultures, the dominant cultural script is grounded in \\"dialectical thinking\\" and seeking to find a middle way by experiencing a balance between positive and negative emotions. Because normative behaviors in these two cultures vary, it should also be expected that their cultural scripts would also vary. Tsai et al. (2007) argues that not only do cultural factors influence ideal affect (i.e., the affective states that people ideally want to feel) but that the influence can be detected very early. Their research suggests that preschool aged children are socialized to learn ideal affect through cultural products such as children storybooks. They found that European American preschool children preferred excited (vs. calm) smiles and activities more and perceived an excited (vs. calm) smile as happier than Taiwanese Chinese preschoolers. This is consistent with American best sellers containing more excited and arousing content in their books than the Taiwanese best sellers. These findings suggest that cultural differences in which emotions are desirable or, ideal affect, become evident very early. Culture and emotional experiences A cultural syndrome as defined by Triandis (1997) is a \\"shared set of beliefs, attitudes, norms, values, and behavior organized around a central theme and found among speakers of one language, in one times period, and in one geographic region\\". Because cultures are shared experiences, there are obvious social implications for emotional expression and emotional experiences. For example, the social consequences of expressing or suppressing emotions will vary depending upon the situation and the individual. Hochschild (1983) discussed the role of feeling rules, which are social norms that prescribe how people should feel at certain times (e.g. wedding day, at a funeral). These rules can be general (how people should express emotions in general) and also situational (events like birthdays). Culture also influences the ways emotions are experienced depending upon which emotions are valued in that specific culture. For example, happiness is generally considered a desirable emotion across cultures. In countries with more individualistic views such as America, happiness is viewed as infinite, attainable, and internally experienced. In collectivistic cultures such as Japan, emotions such as happiness are very relational, include a myriad of social and external factors, and reside in shared experiences with other people. Uchida, Townsend, Markus, & Bergseiker (2009) suggest that Japanese contexts reflect a conjoint model meaning that emotions derive from multiple sources and involve assessing the relationship between others and the self. However, in American contexts, a disjoint model is demonstrated through emotions being experienced individually and through self-reflection. Their research suggests that when Americans are asked about emotions, they are more likely to have self-focused responses \\"I feel joy\\" whereas a Japanese typical reaction would reflect emotions between the self and others \\"I would like to share my happiness with others.\\" Culture and emotion regulation Emotions play a critical role in interpersonal relationships and how people relate to each other. Emotional exchanges can have serious social consequences that can result in either maintaining and enhancing positive relationships, or becoming a source of antagonism and discord (Fredrickson, 1998; Gottman & Levenson, 1992)). Even though people may generally \\"want to feel better than worse\\" (Larsen, 2000),) how these emotions are regulated may differ across cultures. Research by Yuri Miyamoto suggests that cultural differences influence emotion regulation strategies. Research also indicates that different cultures socialize their children to regulate their emotions according to their own cultural norms. For example, ethnographic accounts suggest that American mothers think that it is important to focus on their children's successes while Chinese mothers think it is more important to provide discipline for their children. To further support this theory, a laboratory experiment found that when children succeeded on a test, American mothers were more likely than Chinese mothers to provide positive feedback (e.g. \\"You're so smart!\\"), in comparison to Chinese mothers who provided more neutral or task relevant feedback (e.g. \\"Did you understand the questions or did you just guess?\\"; Ng, Pomerantz, & Lam, 2007). This shows how American mothers are more likely to \\"up-regulate\\" positive emotions by focusing on their children's success whereas Chinese mothers are more likely to \\"down-regulate\\" children's positive emotions by not focusing on their success. Americans see emotions as internal personal reactions; emotions are about the self (Markus & Kityama, 1991). In America, emotional expression is encouraged by parents and peers while suppression is often disapproved. Keeping emotions inside is viewed as being insincere as well as posing a risk to one's health and well being. In Japanese cultures, however, emotions reflect relationships in addition to internal states. Some research even suggests that emotions that reflect the inner self cannot be separated from emotions that reflect the larger group. Therefore, unlike American culture, expression of emotions is often discouraged, and suppressing one's individual emotions to better fit in with the emotions of the group is looked at as mature and appropriate. Emotional perception and recognition The role of facial expressions in emotional communication is often debated. While Darwin believed the face was the most preeminent medium of emotion expression, more recent scientific work challenges that theory. Furthermore, research also suggests that cultural contexts behave as cues when people are trying to interpret facial expressions. In everyday life, information from people's environments influences their understanding of what a facial expression means. According to research by Masuda et al. (2008), people can only attend to a small sample of the possible events in their complex and ever- changing environments, and increasing evidence suggests that people from different cultural backgrounds allocate their attention very differently. This means that different cultures may interpret the same social context in very different ways. Since Americans are viewed as individualistic, they should have no trouble inferring people's inner feelings from their facial expressions, whereas Japanese people may be more likely to look for contextual cues in order to better understand one's emotional state. Evidence of this phenomenon is found in comparisons of Eastern and Western artwork. In Western art there is a preoccupation with the face that does not exist in Eastern art. For example, in Western art the figure occupies a larger part of the frame and is clearly noticeably separated from the ground. In East Asian artwork, the central figure is significantly smaller and also appears to be more embedded in the background. In a laboratory setting, Masuda et al. also tested how sensitive both Americans and Japanese would be to social contexts by showing them pictures of cartoons that included an individual in the context of a group of four other people. They also varied the facial expressions of the central figure and group members. They found that American participants were more narrowly focused with judging the cartoon's emotional states than the Japanese participants were. In their recognition task they also observed that the Japanese participants paid more attention to the emotions of the background figures than Americans did. Individualistic vs. collectivistic cultures Contemporary literature has traced the influence of culture on a variety of aspects of emotion, from emotional values to emotion regulation. Indeed, culture may be best understood as a channel through which emotions are molded and subsequently expressed. Indeed, this had been most extensively discussed in psychology by examining individualistic and collectivistic cultures. The individualistic vs. collectivistic cultural paradigm has been widely used in the study of emotion psychology. Collectivistic cultures are said to promote the interdependence of individuals and the notion of social harmony. Indeed, Niedenthal suggests that: \\"The needs, wishes, and desires of the collectives in which individuals find themselves are emphasized, and the notion of individuality is minimized or even absent from the cultural model\\". Individualistic cultures, however, promote individual autonomy and independence. Individual needs, wishes, and desires are emphasized and the possibility of personal attainment is encouraged. Collectivistic cultures include those of Asia and Latin America, whilst individualistic cultures include those of North America and Western Europe. North America, specifically, is seen to be the prototype of an individualistic culture. Research has shown that the collectivism vs. individualism paradigm informs cultural emotional expression. An influential paper by Markus & Kitayama, on the influence of culture on emotion, established that in more collectivistic cultures, emotions were conceived as relational to the group. Thus, in collectivistic cultures, emotions are believed to occur between people, rather than within an individual. When Japanese school students were asked about their emotions, they usually stated than an emotion comes from their outside social surroundings. When asked about where the emotions they feel originate from, Japanese school students never referred to themselves first. This suggests that Japanese people believe emotions exist within the environment, between individuals, in line with collectivistic values. Individualistic cultures, however, conceive emotions as independent internal experiences, occurring within an individual. When American school students were asked about their emotions, they usually stated that they experienced emotions within themselves. This suggests that Americans consider emotions as personal, experienced internally and independently. Markus & Kitayama purport that emotions like friendliness and shame - which promote interconnectedness - are predominant in Asian culture. Conversely, European-American cultures were shown to be predominated by individualistic emotions, such as pride or anger. Emotion suppression Collectivistic cultures are believed to be less likely to express emotions, in fear of upsetting social harmony. Miyahara, referencing a study conducted on Japanese interpersonal communication, purports that the Japanese \\"are low in self disclosure, both verbally and non-verbally....Most of these attributes are ascribed to the Japanese people's collectivistic orientations\\". The study conducted showed that Japanese individuals have a relatively low expression of emotion. Niedenthal further suggests that: \\"Emotional moderation in general might be expected to be observed in collectivist cultures more than in individualistic cultures, since strong emotions and emotional expression could disrupt intra-group relations and smooth social functioning\\". Individualistic cultures are seen to express emotions more freely than collectivistic cultures. In a study comparing relationships among American and Japanese individuals, it was found that: \\"People in individualistic cultures are motivated to achieve closer relationships with a selected few, and are willing to clearly express negative emotions towards others\\". Research by Butler et al., found that the social impact of emotion suppression is moderated by the specific culture. Whilst the suppression of emotion by those with European Americans values led to non-responsive reactions and hostility, individuals with bicultural Asian-American values were perceived as less hostile and more engaged when they suppressed their emotions. Thus, individuals with Asian- American values were more skilled in emotional suppression than individuals with European-American values. The article explanation is that Asian-Americans may engage in habitual suppression more often as negative emotions are seen to cause social disharmony and thus contradict cultural values. Culture and emotion socialization Research undertaken in the socialization of children cross-culturally has shown how early cultural influences start to affect emotions. Studies have shown the importance of socializing children in order to imbue them with emotional competence. Research by Friedlmeier et al., suggests children must be socialized in order to meet the emotional values and standards of their culture. For instance, in dealing with negative emotions, American parents were more likely to encourage emotion expression in children, thus promoting autonomy and individualistic competence. East Asian parents, however, attempted to minimize the experience of the negative emotion, by either distracting their child or trying to make their child suppress the emotion. This promotes relational competence and upholds the value of group harmony. Children are thus socialized to regulate emotions in line with cultural values. Further research has assessed the use of storybooks as a tool with which children can be socialized to the emotional values of their culture. Taiwanese values promote ideal affect as a calm happiness, where American ideal affect is excited happiness. Indeed, it was found that American preschoolers preferred excited smiles and perceived them as happier than Taiwanese children did, and these values were seen to be mirrored in storybook pictures. Importantly, it was shown that across cultures, exposure to story books altered children's preferences. Thus, a child exposed to an exciting (versus calm) book, would alter their preference for excited (versus calm) activity. This shows that children are largely malleable in their emotions, and suggests that it takes a period of time for cultural values to become ingrained. Another study has shown that American culture values high arousal positive states such as excitement, over low arousal positive states such as calmness. However, in Chinese culture low arousal positive states are preferable to high arousal positive states. The researchers provide a framework to explain this, suggesting that high arousal positive states are needed in order to influence someone else, where low arousal positive states are useful for adjusting to someone else. This explanation is in line with the collectivism-individualism dichotomy: American values promote individual autonomy and personal achievement, where Asian values promote relational harmony. Emotion expression is consequently seen to be influenced largely by the culture in which a person has been socialized. Culture of honor Nisbett & Cohen's 1996 study Culture of Honor examines the violent honor culture in the Southern states of the USA. The study attempts to address why the southern USA is more violent, with a higher homicide rate, than its northern counterpart. It is suggested that the higher rate of violence is due to the presence of a 'culture of honor' in the southern USA. A series of experiments were designed to determine whether southerners got angrier than northerners when they were insulted. In one example, a participant was bumped into and insulted, and their subsequent facial expressions were coded. Southerners showed significantly more anger expressions. Furthermore, researchers measured cortisol levels, which increase with stress and arousal, and testosterone levels, which increase when primed for aggression. In insulted southerners, cortisol and testosterone levels rose by 79% and 12% respectively, which was far more than in insulted northerners. With their research, Nisbett & Cohen show that southern anger is expressed in a culturally specific manner. Challenges in cultural research of emotions One of the biggest challenges in cultural research and human emotions is the lack of diversity in samples. Currently, the research literature is dominated by comparisons between Western (usually American) and Eastern Asian (usually Japanese or Chinese) sample groups. This limits our understanding of how emotions vary and future studies should include more countries in their analyses. Another challenge outlined by Matsumoto (1990) is that culture is ever changing and dynamic. Culture is not static. As the cultures continue to evolve it is necessary that research capture these changes. Identifying a culture as \\"collectivistic\\" or \\"individualistic\\" can provide a stable as well as inaccurate picture of what is really taking place. No one culture is purely collectivistic or individualistic and labeling a culture with these terms does not help account for the cultural differences that exist in emotions. As Matsumoto argues, a more contemporary view of cultural relations reveals that culture is more complex than previously thought. Translation is also a key issue whenever cultures that speak different languages are included in a study. Finding words to describe emotions that have comparable definitions in other languages can be very challenging. For example, happiness, which is considered one of the six basic emotions, in English has a very positive and exuberant meaning. In Hindi, Sukhi is a similar term however it refers to peace and happiness. Although happiness is a part of both definitions, the interpretation of both terms could lead to researchers to making assumptions about happiness that actually do not exist. Further research Studies have shown that Western and Eastern cultures have distinct differences in emotional expressions with respect to hemi-facial asymmetry; Eastern population showed bias to the right hemi-facial for positive emotions, while the Western group showed left hemi-facial bias to both negative and positive emotions. Recently, the valence and arousal of the twelve most popular emotion keywords expressed on the micro-blogging site Twitter were measured using latent semantic clustering in three geographical regions: Europe, Asia and North America. It was demonstrated that the valence and arousal levels of the same emotion keywords differ significantly with respect to these geographical regions ‚Äî Europeans are, or at least present themselves as more positive and aroused, North Americans are more negative and Asians appear to be more positive but less aroused when compared to global valence and arousal levels of the same emotion keywords. This shows that emotional differences between Western and Eastern cultures can, to some extent, be inferred through their language style. Conclusion Culture affects every aspect of emotions. Identifying which emotions are good or bad, when emotions are appropriate to be expressed, and even how they should be displayed are all influenced by culture. Even more importantly, cultures differently affect emotions, meaning that exploring cultural contexts is key to understanding emotions. Through incorporating sociological, anthropological, and psychological research accounts it can be concluded that exploring emotions in different cultures is very complex and the current literature is equally as complex, reflecting multiple views and the hypothesis.

At its peak length, the route connected Highway 33 in Bloomfield, near Picton, with Highway 7 in Marmora. Portions of this longer route are now designated as Highway 62\\\\. Prior to being decommissioned, the route connected Highway 62 in Foxboro with Highway 7 in Marmora, via Stirling. What became Highway 14 was designated as part of the original Ontario Highway System in 1920. The route, connecting Picton, Belleville and Foxboro, was numbered in 1925. The route was extended north to Marmora in 1928, and remained generally stable over the next fifty years. In 1982, the Norris Whitney Bridge was opened over the Bay of Quinte. Consequently, the section of Highway 14 south of Foxboro was renumbered as Highway 62\\\\. The remainder of the highway was decommissioned on April 1, 1997, the only of the original fifteen 1925 highways to have its number completely removed from the provincial highway system.  Route description  Prior to being decommissioned in the 1990s, Highway 14 connected the towns of Foxboro, Stirling and Marmora, entirely within Hastings County. Today, this route begins in the south at an intersection with Highway 62, the Foxboro Bypass, and proceeds west as the Foxboro‚ÄìStirling Road. It travels through a highly populated rural region, passing through the community of Chatterton, where it turns north. The route meanders north and northeastward through a mix of farmland and forests, passing the community of Oak Lake. As it enters the town of Stirling, the road curves west and crosses Rawdon Creek as Front Street East. At North Street, former Highway 14 turns and follows the Stirling‚ÄìMarmora Road, which carries the route northward into the farmed countryside. After travelling through the community of Sine, the road runs parallel to Hoards Creek. The creek remains on the west side of the route north to its headwaters as the road passes through Harold, Spring Brook and Bonarlaw. From there, the route curves northeast until it enters the town of Marmora, where it is known as Forsyth Street. The former highway ends at Highway 7 (Matthew Street); beyond Highway 7, the roadway becomes County Road 48, which continues north to Cordova Mines.  History  Highway 14 was one of the original 15 provincial highways (2-17, with 13 skipped) which formed in the early 1920s. The predecessor of the Ministry of Transportation, the Department of Public Highways in Ontario (DPHO) had assumed control of two roads in Eastern Ontario, the Picton-Belleville road, and the Foxboro- Belleville Road. Its routing led from the town of Foxboro, to the town of Picton. At first, the road was not given a route number, and was simply referred to as the Foxboro-Picton Highway. In 1925, the Provincial Government and Department of Highways had decided to number the provincially controlled highways, and the road was given the designation of Highway 14. Most of the road had been paved by 1925, and the last gravel sections (south of Belleville, and north of Bloomfield) were paved in 1927. This road was the second provincial highway to be fully paved, with Highway 5 being the first. At this point, the road had become in length. In 1928, the Department of Highways gained control of more roads that led from Foxboro to Marmora, and applied the Highway 14 designation on them, too. This brought Highway 14's length to . By 1941, the remainder of the road had been paved, and a bypass was built around Foxboro in 1964. By 1982, the Norris Whitney Bridge was opened, replacing the old Belleville Bay Bridge, and the road was terminated at Foxboro. The section south of there to Bloomfield became part of Highway 62 in 1983. The length of the highway was now . After the road was truncated at Foxboro, its purpose became to link the generally parallel roads of Highway 2 and Highway 7 together, to improve access between Kingston and Peterborough. The road was eliminated from the provincial network on April 1, 1995 amongst the downloading of Highway 33 and the portion of Highway 2 within Hastings County. The road became \\"Hastings County Road 14\\", but the County of Hastings then downloaded the county road (and the responsibilities of its maintenance) to its constituent towns and townships on January 1, 1998. Although the road has such varied names as \\"Stirling-Rawdon Road 14\\", and \\"Marmora & Lake Road 14\\", it has the same numerical designation throughout.

The community population taken at the 2011 census was 585. The older, Anglicised spelling of Nerquis can sometimes be found. It has a small school and a local bus service to Mold which is around 3 miles away. Geography Nercwys lies on the eastern fringe of the Clwydian Range and is served by a network of lanes. The modern settlement straggles along a shelf that interrupts the prevailing south-west to north-east slope. The River Terrig, a tributary of the Alyn, runs northwards less than one kilometre to the east. Nercwys Forest, a large conifer woodland planted in 1965, lies to the west of the village. Multiple circular trails exist for mountain biking, hiking and horse riding, along with remnants of a Bronze Age cairn and industrial lead mining. History The origins of this settlement are obscure. The shape of the churchyard might indicate an early medieval origin but there is no convincing evidence to corroborate the theory. The meaning of the name is obscure but could combine either 'hanner' [half] or 'anner' [heifer] with 'cwys' [furrow]. The development of Nercwys through the Middle Ages and even into the post-medieval era remains to be elucidated. The first depiction on an estate map of 1734 shows Plas-yn-llan to the south of the churchyard, the White Lion Inn at the crossroads and a small number of dwellings scattered along the road. The parish church is dedicated to St Mary, dates back to the 12th century and is a grade II* listed building. The church, an ancient chapelry of Mold, is first documented in 1291, when the place was termed Nerchgwys. Tower. The only fortified border house still standing in Wales Within the community of Nercwys is a Grade 1 listed Welsh fortified border house which is referred to as The Tower or simply 'Tower'. It is the only Welsh fortified border house still standing and has been in the same family for six centuries and is still privately owned. Over the decades the building has had many additions, including a tower and battlements which Mr Wynne-Eyton (the current occupier) thinks date from the 18th Century and belongs to the early Gothic Revival period. This now gentrified home was referred to by the 15th century poet Hywel Cilcan as ‚Äúthe fair Tower ‚Ä¶.a fortress twenty fathoms high‚Äù. Rheinallt ap Gryfydd ap Bleddyn, who features in the continuous border warfare of the time, hung the Mayor of Chester in the dining hall at Tower in 1465. An iron staple in the ceiling of the medieval dining hall marks the spot.

Bo (2005). Creative Cognition: Analogy and Incubation. Department of Psychology, University of Aarhus, Denmark Incubation is defined as, when attending to a different task, humans forget about the previous unsuccessful attempts and can engage with the task anew, often leading to finding the solution. Incubation is related to intuition and insight in that it is the unconscious part of a process whereby an intuition may become validated as an insight. Incubation substantially increases the odds of solving a problem, and benefits from long incubation periods with low cognitive workloads.\\"Does incubation enhance problem-solving? A meta-analytic review\\", Sio & Ormerod 2009 The experience of leaving a problem for a period of time and then finding that the difficulty evaporates on returning to the problem, or, even more striking, that the solution \\"comes out of the blue\\" when thinking about something else, is widespread. Many guides to effective thinking and problem solving advise the reader to set problems aside for a time. Paradigm for investigation The most widely adopted paradigm for investigating incubation involves comparing problems on which participants take a break during solving with problems on which participants work for a continuous period. The total time spent on each problem is equated across the conditions, and the incubation period is usually filled with unrelated activity to prevent further conscious work on the problem. Superior performance on problems for which work is split over two sessions is taken as evidence for the incubation effect, which is thus operationally defined as any benefit of a break during problem solving. Effects of emotion and sleep When discussing the relation between incubation effect, emotions, and creativity, researchers found that positive mood enhances creativity at work. That means that a given day's creativity would be expected to follow reliably from the previous day's mood, above and beyond any carry-over of that previous day's mood. Theory and research on incubation, long recognized as a part of the creative process, suggest such cross-day effects. Thus, if positive mood on a particular day increases the number and scope of available thoughts, those additional thoughts may incubate overnight, increasing the probability of creative thoughts the following day.Dodds, A. Rebecca, Ward, B. Thomas, & Smith, M. Steven (2004). A Review of Experimental Research on Incubation in Problem Solving and Creativity. Texas A&M; University Recent advances in neuroscience provide intriguing evidence of the mechanisms underlying incubation effects, particularly those that occur during sleep. This research reveals that people's experiences while awake can be consolidated into memory and result in enhanced performance the next day without any additional practice or engagement in the task. Moreover, there is mounting evidence that sleep can facilitate the types of memory and learning processes, such as associative memory, that contribute to creative problem solving. In one relevant experiment, researchers demonstrated that problem- solving insight can be dramatically enhanced by a period of sleep following initial work on a problem. Effects of dreams In the 1970s, Stanford Sleep Lab Director William Dement gave 500 undergraduate students three \\"brain- teaser\\" problems to read over before going to sleep and had them note whether they had solutions in their dreams that night; seven students had a dream containing the solution. In 1993, Harvard psychologist Deirdre Barrett conducted research asking college students to incubate answers to real-life homework and other objective problems on which they were working, finding that, in one week's time, half had dreamed about their topic and a quarter had a dream which provided an answer.Barrett, Deirdre. The 'Committee of Sleep': A Study of Dream Incubation for Problem Solving. Dreaming: Journal of the Association for the Study of Dreams, 1993, 3, pp. 115-123. Barrett also interviewed modern artists and scientists about their use of their dreams, documenting dramatic anecdotes including winners of Nobel Prizes and MacArthur \\"Genius Grants\\" whose ideas originated in dreams.Barrett, Deirdre. The Committee of Sleep: How Artists, Scientists, and Athletes Use their Dreams for Creative Problem Solving‚Äîand How You Can Too. NY: Crown Books/Random House, 2001 Her research concludes that, while anything‚Äîmath, musical composition, business dilemmas‚Äîmay get solved during dreaming, the two areas dreams are especially likely to help are 1) anything where vivid visualization contributes to the solution, whether in artistic design or invention of 3-D technological devices and 2) any problem where the solution lies in thinking outside the box--i.e. where the person is stuck because the conventional wisdom on how to approach the problem is wrong. Not everybody agrees about the usefulness of dreams in solving problems. In the August 2004 article \\"Dreams: The Case Against Problem-Solving\\", G. William Domhoff concluded: > When all is said and done, there is only occasional anecdotal evidence for > the idea that recalled dreams have any role in solving or detecting > problems.

The type specimen is represented by a Jamaican fossil skeleton, described in 2001 by Daryl Domning, a marine mammal paleontologist at Howard University in Washington, DC. It is believed to have had a hippopotamus-like amphibious lifestyle, and is considered a transitional form between land and sea mammals:Prothero, Donald R. 2007. Evolution: What the Fossils Say and Why It Matters. With original illustrations by Carl Buell. New York, Columbia University Press. . Discovery In the 1990s, vertebrate fossils were found in lagoon deposits at Seven Rivers in Jamaica by Daryl Domning and colleagues. The site is rich in fossils, and yielded hundreds of bones of mainly aquatic vertebrates, a primitive rhinoceros, and possibly a primate. In 2001, Domning named Pezosiren portelli based on sirenian bones found at Seven Rivers. The Seven Rivers site is not only one of the very rare examples of a noncave deposit in the West Indies, but also the oldest discovered so far, with an age of late Early or early Middle Eocene, as attributed by Robinson in 1988. The presence of Pezosiren in Jamaica can be explained as evidence of an Eocene land bridge connecting North America, the Mexican Arc, the Chortis Block, the Nicaragua Rise, and Jamaica. Whatever might be the origin of this sirenian, it had no further impact in the history of the Antillean mammals, because Jamaica became submerged soon after and with it any terrestrial forms. The rest of the accompanying fossil fauna consists mainly of aquatic vertebrates‚Äîfishes, crocodilians, and turtles- and a rhinocerotid species (Hyrachyus). Description P. portelli cast skeleton produced and distributed by Triebold Paleontology Incorporated So far, Pezosiren are not known from complete skeleton. The original description is based on some partial skeletons and ‚Äúseveral hundred‚Äù of isolated bones collected from different bone beds within the Chapelton Formation, but Domning thought most of them \\"appear to represent a single taxon\\". From these, an almost complete skeleton have been composed, only missing most of the feet and the tail. It was the first known quadrupedal sirenian. The remains of Pezosiren indicate that while it had four limbs adapted to walking on land, the skull, teeth, and heavy ribs are more typical of modern sirenians, such as manatees and dugongs. The living animal is estimated to have been \\"pig-sized\\", or roughly 2 meters long (depending on the length of its tail). Based on the known tail vertebrae, reserachers argue that Pezosiren, like its european relative Sobrarbesiren, did not use the tail to propel in the water, but rather used its hind limbs in a mode similar to otters.D√≠az-Berenguer E, Houssaye A, Badiola A & Canudo1 J.I., ‚ÄúThe Hind Limbs of Sobrarbesiren cardieli (Eocene, Northeastern Spain) and New Insights into the Locomotion Capabilities of the Quadrupedal Sirenians‚Äù, Journal of Mammalian Evolution (6/9/2019): doi.org/10.1007/s10914-019-09482-9 See also * Evolution of sirenians * Prorastomus References Category:Paleogene mammals of North America Category:Eocene sirenians Category:Transitional fossils Category:Prehistoric mammal genera Category:Fossil taxa described in 2001 ","title":"Pezosiren"},{"id":"13033909","text":"A Couple More Years is an album by Ronnie Drew and Eleanor Shanley, released in 2000.

The variety spoken there, Costa Rican Spanish, is a form of Central American Spanish. Costa Rica is a linguistically diverse country and home to at least five living local indigenous languages spoken by the descendants of pre-Columbian peoples: Mal√©ku, Cab√©car, Bribri, Guaym√≠, and Buglere. Immigration has also brought people and languages from various countries around the world. Along the Atlantic Ocean in Lim√≥n Province, inhabited primarily by Afro-Caribs, an English-based creole language called Mekatelyu or Patua is spoken to varying degrees, as is English; many older Limonenses speak English as their native language. The Quakers community, who settled in Monteverde in the early 1950s, speaks an older dialect of English, using thou instead of you. Costa Rican Sign Language is also spoken by the deaf community, and Costa Rican Spanish slang is known as \\"pachuco\\". Since 2015 Costa Rica is officially known as a multi-ethnic and pluralistic republic. The greatest advance in this respect came with the amendment of Article 76 of the Constitution of Costa Rica, which now states: \\"Spanish is the official language of the Nation. However, the State will oversee the maintenance and cultivation of indigenous national languages.\\" Living indigenous languages Currently, in Costa Rica, there are six indigenous languages that are still used by their respective populations. All of them belonging to the Chibcha language family. Those languages are: * Mal√©ku language: Also known as Guatuso, spoken by around 800 people in north-eastern Alajuela Province. This language, along with Rama, belongs to the Votic branch of the Chibchan language family. * Cab√©car language: Spoken in the Talamanca mountain range and in the southern Pacific region, Cab√©car is the sister language to Bribri in the Isthmic branch of the Chibchan language family. * Bribri language: Bribri is spoken on the Atlantic slope of the country, including Lim√≥n Province, the Talamanca mountain range, and the south Pac√≠fic region. Together with Cab√©car, it forms the Viceitic subgroup of Chibchan languages. * Guna language : Guna is the language of native tribes in the area of the Cartago Province located in the center of Costa Rica. It is also part of the Isthmic branch of the Chibchan languages, as well as Cab√©car. * Guaym√≠ language: Spoken in various indigenous territories to the southeast of Puntarenas Province, bordering Panama. Together with Buglere, it belongs to the Guaymic subgroup of the Chibchan languages. Also known as Ng√§bere or Movere. * Buglere language: Spoken in the same territories as Guaym√≠, the language to which it is most closely related. It is also known as Bocot√°.  Extinct and formerly spoken languages  An indigenous language map of Costa Rica, pre-Spanish arrival. Prior to the 9th century, only languages of the Chibchan family were spoken in Costa Rica. The extinct Huetar language, probably affiliated with the Chibchan family, served as the lingua franca for the interior of Costa Rica and was considered by the Spanish upon their arrival to be the \\"general language\\" of all Costa Rica. Historically, the range of the still-living Rama language also extended south into northern Costa Rica, where the Mal√©ku language was also spoken. Boruca, an Isthmic Chibchan language, was formerly spoken across the southern Pacific slope while Bribri and Cab√©car speakers inhabited the northern Atlantic slope. An unknown language, known only as the lengua de Paro, was also spoken on the western coast of the Gulf of Nicoya. During the 9th century, speakers of the now-extinct Oto-Manguean language Chorotega controlled most of northeast Costa Rica. Other Mesoamerican peoples penetrated Costa Rican territory. The Nahua speakers known as Nicarao, named after their cacique of the same name, lived in enclaves in Guanacaste Province as well as near the delta of the Sixaola River, speaking a dialect closer to nuclear Nahuatl in Mexico than to the Pipil of El Salvador and Nicaragua. At the beginning of the 21st century, two Costa Rican indigenous languages became extinct. T√©rraba, a variety of the T√©ribe language, was spoken in the indigenous reserve of T√©rraba in the southeast of Puntarenas province. Until its recent extinction, Boruca was spoken in the Boruca and Curr√© reserves in the southeast of Puntarenas province.

It focuses on how broader belief systems shape the cognition and behavior of actors.Friedland & Alford, 1991; Lounsbury, 2007; Thornton, 2004 Friedland and Alford (1991) wrote: \\"Institutions are supraorganizational patterns of human activity by which individuals and organizations produce and reproduce their material subsistence and organize time and space. They are also symbolic systems, ways of ordering reality, and thereby rendering experience of time and space meaningful\\".Friedland, Roger, and Robert R. Alford. 1991. Bringing Society Back in: Symbols, Practices, and Institutional Contradictions. Pp. 232-266 in The New Institutionalism in Organizational Analysis, edited by Walter W. Powell and Paul J. DiMaggio. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. p. 243. Friedland and Alford (1991, p. 248) elaborated: \\"Each of the most important orders of contemporary Western societies has a central logic ‚Äì a set of material practices and symbolic constructions ‚Äì which constitute its organising principles and which is available to organizations and individuals to elaborate.\\" Thornton and Ocasio (1999: 804) define institutional logics as \\"the socially constructed, historical patterns of material practices, assumptions, values, beliefs, and rules by which individuals produce and reproduce their material subsistence, organize time and space, and provide meaning to their social reality\\".Thornton, Patricia, H. and William Ocasio (2008). ‚ÄúInstitutional Logics,‚Äù in Royston Greenwood, Christine Oliver, Kerstin Sahlin and Roy Suddaby (eds.) Handbook of Organizational Institutionalism, CA: Sage.  Overview  Focusing on macro-societal phenomena, Friedland and Alford (1991: 232) identified several key Institutions: the Capitalist market, bureaucratic state, democracy, nuclear family, and Christianity that are each guided by a distinct institutional logic. Thornton (2004) revised Friedland and Alford‚Äôs (1991) inter- institutional scheme to six institutional orders, i.e., the market, the corporation, the professions, the state, the family, and religions. More recently, Thornton, Ocasio and Lounsbury (2012), in more fully fleshing out the institutional logic perspective, added community as another key institutional order. This revision to a theoretically abstract and analytically distinct set of ideal types makes it useful for studying multiple logics in conflict and consensus, the hybridization of logics, and institutions in other parts of society and the world. While building on Friedland and Alford‚Äôs scheme, the revision addresses the confusion created by conflating institutional sectors with ideology (democracy) and means of organization (bureaucracy), variables that can be characteristic several different institutional sectors. The institutional logic of Christianity leaves out other religions in the US and other religions that are dominant in other parts of the world. Thornton and Ocasio (2008) discuss the importance of not confusing the ideal types of the inter-institutional system with a description of the empirical observations in a study‚Äîthat is to use the ideal types as meta theory and method of analysis.  New institutionalism  Organizational theorists operating within the new institutionalism (see also institutional theory) have begun to develop the institutional logics concept by empirically testing it. One variant emphasizes how logics can focus the attention of key decision-makers on a particular set of issues and solutions (Ocasio, 1997), leading to logic-consistent decisions (Thornton, 2002). A fair amount of research on logics has focused on the importance of dominant logics and shifts from one logic to another (e.g., Lounsbury, 2002; Thornton, 2002; Suddaby & Greenwood, 2005). Haveman and Rao (1997) showed how the rise of Progressive thought enabled a shift in savings and loan organizational forms in the U.S. in the early 20th century. Scott et al. (2000) detailed how logic shifts in healthcare led to the valorization of different actors, behaviors and governance structures. Thornton and Ocasio (1999) analyzed how a change from professional to market logics in U.S. higher education publishing led to corollary changes in how executive succession was carried out. While much earlier work focused on ambiguity as a result of multiple and conflicting institutional logics, at the levels of analysis of society and individual roles,(Boltanski and Thevenot ([1986] 1991) Friedland and Alford (1991:248-255) discussed in theory multiple and competing logics at the macro level of analysis. Recent empirical research, inspired by the work of Bourdieu, is developing a more pluralistic approach by focusing on multiple competing logics and contestation of meaning.(Lounsbury, 2007; Marquis & Lounsbury, 2007; Schneiberg, 2007) By focusing on how some fields are composed of multiple logics, and thus, multiple forms of institutionally-based rationality, institutional analysts can provide new insight into practice variation and the dynamics of practice.(see Lounsbury, 2001; Lounsbury & Crumley, 2007) Multiple logics can create diversity in practice by enabling variety in cognitive orientation and contestation over which practices are appropriate. As a result, such multiplicity can create enormous ambiguity, leading to logic blending, the creation of new logics, and the continued emergence of new practice variants. Thornton, Jones, and Kury (2005) showed how competing logics may never resolve but share the market space as in the case of architectural services. Recent research has also documented the co- existence or potential conflict of multiple logics within particular organizations. Zilber (2002), for example, described the organizational consequences of a shift from one logic to another within an Israeli rape crisis center, in which new organization members reshaped the center and its practices to reflect a new dominant logic that they have carried into the organization.Zilber, T. B. (2002). \\"Institutionalization as an Interplay between Actions, Meanings, and Actors: The Case of a Rape Crisis Center in Israel.\\" Academy of Management Journal, 45(1), 234-254. Tilcsik (2010) documented a logic shift in a post-Communist government agency, describing a conflict between the agency's old guard (carriers of the logic of Communist state bureaucracies) and its new guard (carriers of a market logic). This study shows that, paradoxically, an intra-organizational group's efforts to resist a particular logic might in fact open the organization's door to carriers of that very logic.Tilcsik, A. (2010). \\"From ritual to reality: Demography, ideology, and decoupling in a post-communist government agency.\\" Academy of Management Journal, 53(6), 1474-1498. Abstract Almandoz (2012) examined the embeddedness of new local banks' founding teams in a community logic or a financial logic, linking institutional logics to new banking venture's establishment and entrepreneurial success.Almandoz, J. (2012). \\"Arriving at the Starting Line: The Impact of Community and Financial Logics on New Banking Ventures.\\" Academy of Management Journal. As these studies demonstrate, the institutional logics perspective offers valuable insights into important intra-organizational processes affecting organizational practices, change, and success. These studies represent an effort to understand institutional complexity due to conflicting or inconsistent logics within particular organizations, a situation that might results from the entry of new organization members or the layering (or \\"sedimentation\\") of new organizational imprints upon old ones over time.  Institutional theory in marketing  This growing area of research highlights the way that market structures, processes and consumer behaviors can be shaped by different institutional logics. For example, different rhetorical strategies grounded in particular institutional logics might be used in order to better persuade potential consumers.  Historicizing institutional logics  Recent work in institutional theory has attempted to bring historiography into our understanding of institutions. In particular, scholars have drawn onto the Annales School in history. Concepts such as mentalities, critical events, and time horizon have been mapped out and explained in institutional terms, to be mobilized in future research.Such theoretical framework complements existing apparatus in institutional theory, in the sense that it helps understand historical and temporal dynamics in institutional theory.

Florrie's mother scoffs at her daughter's ideas. The talk turns to other crimes and the latest news in the papers of a trial at the Old Bailey involving a taxi driver where the jury is still out considering its verdict. Florrie is scornful of the judge's summing up but praises the reported prosecution speech by Sir Luke Enderby. He is a well- known King's Counsel who came to public attention for successfully prosecuting a man called Henry Garfield in a serial killer case known as the \\"Blondes on the Beach\\". The accused was a good-looking man who attracted women and Mrs. Petter uses this example as an excuse to tell her daughter to be careful of the men that she meets. Their conversation is interrupted by Julia who asks to use their telephone. She is left alone to make the call and she rings up a house in Chishold Gardens where she asks to speak to Sir Luke Enderby... Hayward, the servant, tells Julia over the phone that Sir Luke is not yet back from the Old Bailey. After finishing the phone call, Hayward lets in a visitor to the house ‚Äì Susan Warren, a society lady. Sir Luke arrives soon afterwards from the trial having won his guilty verdict. Soon afterwards his wife arrives back home after a day out at Christie's and she and Susan soon talk of the nature of juries and the verdicts they reach ‚Äì particularly when there are a number of women on the jury who might be influenced by their feelings for the accused. Like Mrs. Petter and Florrie they cite the case of Garfield and the \\"Blondes on the Beach\\". Sir Luke announces that he is leaving for Liverpool that night on another case to the surprise of Lady Enderby who knew nothing of this plan. He soon goes and Susan sympathises with Lady Enderby on her husband's constant infidelities. Lady Enderby is philosophical ‚Äì at least he wasn't unfaithful on their honeymoon ten years ago! He is devoted to their boys and kind and considerate to her. She is sure that his flings are just that ‚Äì meaningless encounters. Arriving at Paddington, Sir Luke meets his latest flame ‚Äì Julia Keene. They get on the train and travel to a station strangely called ' Warning Halt'. From there they walk across the fields to an isolated cottage that Julia has found for their tryst where she has already brought in food for a meal. After a cheerful fire has been lit she brings in a meal of food rarely seen in the days of rationing including duck, pate and a large dish of butter ‚Äì \\"Butter in a Lordly Dish\\" as Julia names it. After their meal, she pours him coffee and once again the talk turns to the nature of Sir Luke's work. Julia asks him if he is troubled that his eloquence can lead to the execution of man and she also brings up the subject of Henry Garfield. Sir Luke tells her that there was no doubt as to the man's guilt in his view: he had known associations with the victims and he only avoided arrest the first few times due to alibis supplied by his wife. She might also have swayed the trial but for the fact that she was ill in hospital at the time with typhoid. Sir Luke is suddenly troubled with a cramp in his leg and the phrase \\"Butter in a Lordly Dish\\" is also concerning him. His cramps get worse and his eyesight also starts to become fuzzy. Nevertheless, he is still able to see somewhat and is puzzled by Julia's actions as she picks up a hammer and nail. She mentions Sisera and Jael and Sir Luke is reminded where the phrase \\"Butter in a Lordly Dish\\" comes from. As his condition further deteriorates Julia confesses three things: That she has drugged his coffee; that she is not Julia Keene but Julia Garfield; and that she and not her husband killed all the women who Henry Garfield was having affairs with. Unlike Lady Enderby, she was not prepared to put up with her husband's infidelities but nevertheless she still loved him. As Sir Luke struggles to move, Julia completes the biblical allusion by hammering a nail into his head...  1948 Radio production  Director/Producer: Martyn C.

The assembly was marked by a series of three addresses in which the British Malaya Command formally surrendered the Indian troops of the British Indian Army to Major Fujiwara Iwaichi representing the Japanese military authority, followed by transfer of authority by Fujiwara to the command of Mohan Singh, and a subsequent address by Mohan Singh to the gathered troops declaring the formation of the Indian National Army to fight the Raj, asking for volunteers to join the army. Early Japanese efforts At the onset of the war, the Japanese IGHQ in October 1941 sent intelligence missions, notably the Fujiwara Kikan, or the F-kikan headed by Major Fujiwara Iwaichi, in Bangkok. The kikan was tasked with intelligence gathering and contacting the Indian independence movement, the overseas Chinese and the Malayan Sultan with the aim of encouraging friendship and cooperation with Japan and destabilising the British war effort in Malaya. Fujiwara successfully established contact with Indian revolutionaries living in exile in Thailand, notably with Swami Satyananda Puri and Giani Pritam Singh, which saw the foundations of the Indian Independence League being formed. With Pritam Singh, Fujiwara sought to establish contacts within the British Indian Army at Malaya. After the war started in South east Asia and Japan successfully invaded the Malaya, Fujiwara came to meet with Capt. Mohan Singh. Mohan Singh had, as a captain in the British Indian Army, seen action with the 1/14th Punjab Regiment against Japanese forces at Jitra, where his troops were outgunned and shattered by Japanese tanks. Captured by Japanese troops after several days in the Jungle, Singh was taken to Alor Star to Fujiwara and Pritam Singh at a joint office of the F-Kikan and the IIL. Fujiwara, later self-described as \\"Lawrence of the Indian National Army\\" (after Lawrence of Arabia) is said to have been a man committed to the values which his office was supposed to convey to the expatriate nationalist leaders, and found acceptance among them. Even before Singapore fell, the Japanese troops had started the process of identifying Indian troops among the captured and separating them from the Australian and British troops. On a number of occasions, it was noted, British and Australian officers were killed, while the Indians spared. Singapore surrendered on 15 February 1942. On the evening of the 16th, the Indian troops of the now amalgamated 1/14th and 5/14th Punjab were ordered by the Malaya command (of the commonwealth forces) to assemble at Farrer Park Field. The British officers were, in the meantime, ordered to assemble east to Changi. The Farrer Park addresses On the morning of 17 February 1942, some 45,000 Indian POWs who gathered at Farrer Park where addressed by in turns, first by a Col Hunt of the Malaya Command, who handed over the troops to Japanese command under Fujiwara. Fujiwara spoke to the troops in Japanese which was translated into English and then Hindustani. In his speech, Fujiwara is said to have told the troops of the Asian co-prosperity sphere under the leadership of Japan, of Japanese vision of an independent India and its importance to the co- prosperity sphere, and of the Japanese intentions to help raise a \\"liberation army\\" for the independence of India. He invited the troops seated at the park to join this army. Further, he told the troops, they were going to be treated not as PoWs, but as Friends and allies. Fujiwara ended his speech stating he is passing on their responsibilities and command to Mohan Singh. Mohan Singh's speech, in Hindustani, was short. He told the troops of forming the Indian National Army to fight for an independent India, and invited the troops to join it. As an Indian Jawan present at the time remembers, Mohan Singh's speech was powerful and touched a chord, and the troops responded with wild enthusiasm and excitement. The Japanese forces, eager to engage the co- operation of the troops and further lacking the man-power, did not have the men impounded. The supreme command of the INA was set up at Mount Pleasant suburbs in the Northern part of the City. The PoW headquarters, along with the largest PoW camp was set up at Neesoon under M. Z. Kiani. Other smaller PoW camps housing Indian troops were set up at Bidadari, Tyersall, Buller, Seletar and Kranji. To Lt. Col N.S Gill went the overall direction of PoW. Significance Controversy exists as to what was actually said by Hunt in the first of the three speeches, while handing over the troops to Japanese authority. Fay writes in 1993 that a number of the troops gathered at the park remembers Hunt as having told the troops that they now belonged to the Japanese army and should obey their orders while Hunt only remembers having said that they were all Prisoners of War of the Japanese Nevertheless, Fay also points out that the fact that they were all POWs was already self- evident, and the fact that they were addressed separately implies some significance. A number of INA veterans present at the event also insist that Hunt's speech effectively told them they were under Japanese control and command. This also fed a feeling of devaluation (handed over like cattle, as Shah Nawaz Khan later put it), abandonment and of dishonour on part of the British high command that they perceived to have served loyally. In the days and years to come, a number of INA men cited this act of abandonment a major reason to join the first INA. It is estimated that nearly half of those present at Farrer Park Field later joined the first INA. Significantly however, a large number of Indian officers decided not to, which also kept disinclined those under their command not to. During the Red Fort Trials, one of the arguments made by Bhulabhai Desai for the defence was that the Malayan command had abandoned the responsibility it had to these troops, allowing the Indian troops to be separated from the rest against the laws of treatment to Prisoners of War and formally handing them over to Fujiwara. This, Bhiulabhai argued, legitimised the subsequent adoption of allegiance to Azad Hind by the troops since their original oath to the King emperor had been nullified by this act of the Malaya Command. Hunt, who was in England during the trial, was called to give evidence but refused on grounds of ill-health. Notes References * . *. *.

At the initiative of the Vermont Commission on Country Life, Flanders commenced a three-decade career capturing traditional songs that were sung in New England --songs that, in many cases, traced their origin to the British Isles. The timing of her life work was critical, coming as it did when people were turning away from traditional music in favor of listening to the radio. Today her nearly 4,500 field recordings, transcriptions and analyses are housed at the Flanders Ballad Collection at Middlebury College, Middlebury, Vermont and have been a resource for scholars and folk singers, since the establishment of the collection in 1941. Biographical Helen Hartness ca. 1909 Flanders was born in Springfield, Vermont. Her father was James Hartness, inventor, industrialist, and one-term Governor of Vermont, who headed the Jones and Lamson Machine Tool Company in that town. She graduated from the Dana Hall School in 1909, where she sang in the glee club and was a member of the school French club. In 1911 she married Ralph Flanders, a noted American mechanical engineer, industrialist and Republican U.S. Senator (1946-1959) from Vermont. She and her husband maintained homes in Springfield and Washington, D.C. where they entertained friends who included Dorothy Canfield Fisher and Robert Frost. They had three children: Elizabeth, (born in 1912), Anna (also known as Nancy--born in 1918), and James (born in 1923). Elizabeth helped her mother from time to time with collecting and transcribing tunes. In addition to her writings on traditional ballads, Flanders published two small volumes of poetry and one children's play. She traveled with her husband to the British Isles, Europe and Australia on various occasions.  Ballad and folk song collecting   Background  In 1930, Vermont Governor John E. Weeks invited Flanders to join the Committee on Traditions and Ideals of the Vermont Commission on Country Life. That committee asked her to collect Vermont folk songs, which were passed along orally from one person to another. In the 1930s, people in New England were turning to music on the radio; as a result, interest in traditional songs was on the wane. Flanders understood that unless these songs were collected and recorded for posterity, they would die along with the people who sang them. What began as a committee assignment became not just a hobby, but a passion. She continued collecting for three decades.  Collection methodology  Flanders with Eveline K. Fairbanks (right), one of the singers whose traditional songs she recorded. Photographer unknown. Photo in Helen Hartness Ballad Collection at Middlebury College. The availability of portable recording devices was key to Flanders's ability to collect music from singers in remote parts of New England. Initially, she recorded on wax cylinders; then from 1939 to 1949, on aluminum and acetate discs; and in later years, on reel-to-reel tapes. On occasions when electricity was not available in a singer's home, Flanders plugged a recorder into the cigarette lighter of her car. Flanders expanded her quest throughout New England and to New York State. The singers that she found came from all walks of life; the majority of them were elderly. Flanders made field recordings with George Brown in 1930, then with the occasional help of Phillips Barry between 1931 and 1937, and with Alan Lomax in 1939. From 1940-1958 Flanders continued to collect, but Marguerite Olney was responsible for major contributions both in the collection management and in the field. Between 1930 and 1939, Flanders focused mostly on collecting Child ballads. This explains the proportionately large number of those ballads on cylinders. Of the 150 recordings made on disc with Alan Lomax, there were songs, stories and fiddle tunes. Over time, the scope of the field recordings would include religious songs, children's songs, 19th-century American popular songs, dance tunes, as well as folktales. George Brown, his mother, Alice Brown, Phillips Barry, Marguerite Olney and Elizabeth Flanders Ballard all made musical transcriptions of songs for Flanders's publications. An index of all the field recordings (collected between 1930 and 1958) was published in 1983.  The collection and its significance  In 1941 when there was no longer enough space to store the collection in Flanders's home, she donated it to Middlebury College in Vermont. Today the Flanders Ballad Collection is housed in Special Collections and includes not only her papers but nearly 4,500 field recordings. Copies of these recordings are also available at the American Folklife Center of the Library of Congress and at Harvard University. The American Folklife Center also has files of Flanders's correspondence. Flanders demonstrated that when songs migrated from the British Isles or Europe, the texts would sometimes undergo changes as singers inserted details from their life in the new world. For example, the \\"Yorkshire Bite\\" became the \\"New Hampshire Bite.\\" Many of the stories in these ballads and folksongs describe aspects of life in New England and Colonial history. In recognition of her accomplishments as a ballad collector, Middlebury College awarded Flanders an honorary Master of Arts in 1942. She was a member of the National Committee of the National Folk Festival Association and vice president of the Folksong Society of the Northeast. In 1966, the Vermont House of Representatives added Flanders's name to the state's Roll of Distinction in the Arts. Legacy  Promoting an interest in traditional ballads  Flanders was the author of eight books on ballads and folk music; she also wrote pamphlets, newspaper and magazine articles, and two books of poetry. She wrote a regular column on ballads for the Springfield Sunday Union and Republican (Massachusetts) during the 1930s.  Performers of traditional ballads  Through their concerts and recordings, numerous folksingers have promoted interest in the Flanders Ballad Collection. Foremost among these is ballad singer Margaret MacArthur (1928‚Äì2006) who moved to Vermont in the late 1940s. During their ten-year friendship, Flanders encouraged her singing and gave her copies of the field recordings. Although also a collector of traditional songs in New England, MacArthur was especially known in the United States and abroad for her repertoire (and many recordings) of songs derived from the Flanders Collection. In recent years, Vermonter Deborah Flanders has performed and recorded songs collected by her great-aunt Helen.  Flanders Ballad Collection at Middlebury College  The Flanders Ballad Collection at Middlebury College is organized, as follows: #Materials related to field collecting, 1930-1958: The original field recordings consist of 254 wax cylinders. Those recorded on discs comprise the largest body with a variety of songs, a few interviews and stories. Flanders made 77 discs with Alan Lomax, which are catalogued in the Library of Congress. There are 60 discs that contain songs recorded in Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine between 1940 and 1947; and 61 that contain fiddle and dance music from all the New England states (16 collected with Alan Lomax); nine discs of fife music made in Massachusetts; and from the 1950s, approximately 55 tapes made on a reel- to-reel recorder. #Manuscript and typescript materials derived directly from field research, 1930-60: Flanders and Marguerite Olney subdivided song texts into the following categories: Child ballads (89 titles), 635 other British song titles (broadsides and others), and 593 American titles. Among these, there were 114 \\"stage songs\\" (British and American popular songs from the 19th-early 20th centuries), 73 religious titles and 122 children's songs. #Correspondence, publication materials, lectures and exhibits derived largely from field work, 1931-1967: including Flanders's correspondence with scholars, articles about her collecting experiences; information about ballad lectures given over a 30-year period throughout New England and in the Washington, D.C. area. #Supporting materials not directly related to field work, 1930-1960: original manuscripts, copybooks, and miscellaneous sheets which contain over 300 songs and tunes‚Äîincluding ballads, broadsides, fiddle and fife tunes which were transcribed between the 18th and the early 20th centuries. #Collection administration, 1940-1967: papers relating to the general operation of the collection. #Personal papers, 1941-65: a limited number personal notes from friends of Helen Flanders and photographs of members of the Flanders family.

In the process, the movement sought to 'break through' the pillarisation in Dutch politics. This led to the creation of the modern day Labour Party.  Background  After World War II, there was widespread feeling amongst progressives that the pillarised political system should be broken open. No longer should Catholics vote for the Roman Catholic State Party simply because they were Catholic or Reformed people for the Anti-Revolutionary Party simply because they were Reformed. Instead, political issues should structure the political system. The progressives were united in their vision of a democratic socialist Netherlands. In order to force this breakthrough, the Social Democratic Workers' Party, the left-liberal Free-thinking Democratic League and the Christian socialist Christian Democratic Union united to form the Labour Party, a progressive party open to all people. The new party did not, however, gain enough support from Catholics or Reformed adherents. Much of the liberal wing left in 1948 and joined with the conservative liberal Freedom Party to form the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy. The PvdA became encapsulated in the socialist pillar. In 1966, social liberal Democrats 66 attempted another breakthrough of the pillarised political system, again unsuccessfully.

It was associated with the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME Church). The college was named in honor of Daniel Payne, the sixth bishop of the AME Church and the first black president of a college in the United States.  History  The college was founded in Selma in 1889. Its campus was located at 1525 Franklin Street and included the Bishop Gaines Hall as the primary building, two additional classroom buildings and Coppin Hall which served as a dormitory. The college stayed at that location through 1922, when it relocated to its Woodlawn location within the city of Birmingham. The college was located at 6415 Washington Boulevard. By 1974, the college had to be relocated because of airport expansion and the building of interstate highways in the area. The street on which the college was located no longer exists; however, a remnant of University Avenue that once led to the campus connects to the Messer Airport Highway. The college moved to a new campus at the southeast corner of Cherry Avenue and Daniel Payne Drive on the far northern edge of Birmingham, where new buildings were constructed in 1974. On April 4, 1977 a destructive tornado tore through the campus, severely damaging buildings. The damage, along with mounting financial problems, forced the school to file for bankruptcy in 1978 and close its doors in 1979. At the time of its closure, the college had 120 students enrolled on the campus. Later a group of students sued the former president, claiming that he had mismanaged college funds. A court ruling established the precedent that students have a vested interest in the operation of the college which they attend.  Physical legacy  After the college closed, the city of Birmingham changed the name of Sayreton Road to Daniel Payne Drive in honor of the bishop and educator. The old campus still exists, although the dormitories have been abandoned. Other buildings were adapted for use as a public health clinic, and as the headquarters for the African Methodist Episcopal Church in Alabama. In 2009, the AME Church offices were relocated to downtown Birmingham. In 2010 the AME Church announced plans to redevelop the campus as a retirement home and multi-use project. The former campus was severely damaged by the April 2011 tornado outbreak in Birmingham.

The group were known for combining the musical stylings of punk rock, psychedelic rock, and even pop music with their songs. The band released a total of nine full-length studio albums across their entire career before they band broke up in early 1998. History The band emerged in 1987 from the edgy punk scene of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The city was going through a major decline at the time due to the closing of the industrial powerhouse Bethlehem Steel. After numerous unsuccessful attempts at joining bands, guitarist John Terlesky decided to form his own band with Ken Bussiere, a bassist he met through Neil Hever, a WMUH college radio disc jockey who was friends with Terlesky. Later on, the duo would meet keyboardist Dan McKinney and drummer Dave Ferrara, and the quintet would name themselves The Original Sins. Later that same year, the band released their debut studio album Big Soul, which received moderate success within the American underground music scene. Their independent success with Big Soul continued with The Hardest Way (1989) and Self Destruct (1990), the latter included a photo of Terlesky holding a BB gun next to his head as the cover. Their 1992 album, Move was expected to be a major success for the band, as Peter Buck from R.E.M. helped with the record, but unfortunately for the band, it was not. After the release of Move, Ferrara left the group and would later perform in the band The Reach Around Radio Clowns. To replace him, the band hired Seth Baer on drum duties. Seth would stay with the band until he left for school before the production of Suburban Primitive, in which Ferrara came back to perform drums. The band would continue releasing records with Baer, such as Out There (1992) and Acidbubblepunk (1994). Their 1995 album Turn You On was released as a limited edition vinyl record through Terlesky's Bedlam record label. 1996 saw the release of Bethlehem, which was released through Bar/None Records, who released their debut album in 1987. The album shows a change in style and tone for the band, focusing much heavily on pop music rather than the garage punk fury of past releases. The album met high praise from fans and critics alike, with some calling it as \\"the band's greatest achievement\\". A year after the release of their 1997 album Suburban Primitive, the project finally ended after bassist and founder member Ken Bussiere announced that he will be moving to Florida to perform in oldies cover bands.

It is of glacial origin, being a Moraine- dammed lake. The lake is connected to Nahuel Huapi Lake. It was named by explorer and naturalist Francisco P. Moreno as an homage to his academic mentor Juan Mar√≠a Guti√©rrez. The lake harbors several species of trout including rainbow trout, brown trout and brook trout which attract anglers from the world over. Despite being nowhere near any ocean and being at high altitude, the lake is also home to the kelp gull and the blue-eyed cormorant (Phalacrocorax atriceps), otherwise strictly marine birds. The lake's clear waters are very susceptible to climate change and have an average surface temperature of 45 ¬∞F (7 ¬∞C). Hypothermia is one of the risks bathers must endure. Kayaking is a popular sport on this and adjacent lakes. The lake is located near San Carlos de Bariloche (about 12 km), and it is a popular tourist attraction.

(6 January 1859 ‚Äì 19 May 1942) was a French prelate of the Catholic Church, who became a Cardinal in 1935. An historian and writer, he served as Rector of the Institut Catholique de Paris from 1907 until his death. He campaigned to rouse international support for France during the First World War, while in the Second World War he supported the Vichy regime and backed the Germans for leading the international struggle against bolshevism. Biography Baudrillart was born in Paris, to Henri Baudrillart and Marie Sacy. His father was professor of political economy at Coll√®ge de France, editor in chief of the Journal des √âconomistes, and a member of Acad√©mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques. Baudrillart's maternal grandfather, Samuel Ustazade de Sacy, was redactor in chief of the Journal des d√©bats and a member of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise. Raised in the Latin Quarter, Baudrillart entered √âcole Bossuet in 1868, and later the Coll√®ge Louis le Grand. In 1876, at the age of seventeen, he decided to pursue a career in the Church. He attended the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure from 1878 to 1881, where his classmates included Jean Jaures and Henri Bergson. He earned his doctorate with a thesis entitled Philippe V et la Cour de France and earned a theology degree as well. He taught at several schools, including the Coll√®ge Stanislas de Paris. Baudrillart joined the Oratory of St. Philip of Neri in 1890. He was ordained to the priesthood in Paris on 9 July 1893, at the relatively late age of 34. He then served as professor of history at the Institut Catholique from 1894 to 1907, when he was named its rector; he held this position until his death thirty-five years later. Founding the Revue practique d'apolog√©tique in 1905, he was the director of Bulletin critique from 1898 to 1908, having previously served as a collaborator from 1891 to 1897. Baudrillart served as General Assistant of the Oratorians from 1898 to 1908, and again from 1919 to 1921. He was a \\"ferocious opponent\\" (farouche adversaire) of \\"modernism\\", a complex of ideas and social developments that the Catholic Church identified broadly as historicism, secularism, and rationalism, and which Baudrillart identified with the bishops of Germany and their resistance to the teaching of Pope Pius X in his encyclical denouncing modernism, Pascendi dominici gregis (1907). Baudrillart was an ardent supporter of France in the First World War and promoted its cause internationally. He founded the Comite catholique de propagande francaise a l'etranger and reached an audience of 15 million with articles written for publication in U.S. newspapers. He also gave lectures in Spain and the U.S. In May 1917, he rejected an overture from Matthias Erzberger of the German Catholic Centre Party because he thought it wrong for Catholics or any other group to act in the place of the lawful government. Baudrillart was made an honorary canon of the metropolitan cathedral chapter of Paris in 1906, and a Domestic prelate of His Holiness on 17 April 1907. On 10 October 1908, he became Vicar General of Paris. He was elected as a member of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise, like his grandfather, on 2 May 1918. On 29 July 1921, Baudrillart was appointed Titular Bishop of Hemeria by Pope Benedict XV. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 28 October in the Institut's √âglise des Carmes from Cardinal Louis-Ernest Dubois, with Bishops Stanislas Touchet and Joseph-Marie Tissier serving as co-consecrators. Baudrillart was later advanced to Titular Archbishop of Melitene on 12 April 1928. On a visit to a francophone conference in Canada in 1927, he imagined in his diaries the future on an independent French state in North America. During his visit to New York on that trip, The New York Times called him \\"one of the best known bishops in the world\\". Pope Pius XI created him Cardinal Priest of S. Bernardo alle Terme in the consistory of 16 December 1935. Baudrillart was one of the cardinal electors in the 1939 papal conclave, which elected Pope Pius XII. Pius was close friends with General Maurice Gamelin, whom Baudrillart had once taught. Baudrillart supported the Vichy government of Marshal Philippe P√©tain, issuing a statement titled Choisir, vouloir, ob√©ir (Choose, desire, obey) on 20 November 1940, which shocked his colleagues and veterans of the First World War. In August 1941, as a fervent anti-communist, endorsed the formation of the creation of a Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism to fight alongside the Germans. He was a member of the Legion's Honorary Committee of Sponsors, and his views, according to his diary, were influenced by meetings with , an Austrian Catholic, German officer, and Nazi counter-intelligence agent. His endorsement of the Legion said: Baudrillart died in Paris on 19 May 1942 at the age of 83. He was interred in the √âglise des Carmes at the Institut Catholique.

At one time it had a general store started by Matthias Carland's family who settled the land beginning in 1796. Also a post office and a grist mill, started by Peter Van Dyke and his sons, which began operating in 1789. These businesses have been gone for many years, though the building that served as the store and post office still stands as a storage building for a home. It is located approximately 5 miles north-northeast of Taylorsville. Rivals received its name in an unusual fashion. The story goes that when the application to open a post office there was filled out, a second name choice was required in case the first choice had already been taken. The store owner, needing this second choice, looked upon his shelves and saw a box of ammunition with the brand name Rivals. The first choice was already in use elsewhere, so Rivals became the official post office name, and consequentially the community name. The Van Dykes were early settlers of the area, owning at least one grist mill and also farming the area. The road into Rivals from Highway 55 is still known as Van Dyke Mill Road. Early newspaper reports refer to the area as \\"Van Dyke Mills\\". A letter to the editor of one of these early papers refers to more than one mill, a wool carding factory, and several other business interests. The area is still largely farmland, producing tobacco, corn, wheat, soybeans, sod, cattle, and goats. Over the past 25 years, however, a number of farms have been subdivided into residential areas and \\"mini-farms\\"‚Äîproperties with zoning to allow a small number of animals and/or growing of crops, but not large enough to actually be considered a for-profit farm. In spite of the changes and growth of recent decades, Rivals and other nearby communities such as Normandy are still home to a number of families who have lived there for multiple generations, such as the Allgeier, Harp, Jeffiers, Jeffries, Prewitt, Travis, Yates and Wills families.

Arthur Ransome wrote detailed descriptions of the locations in his books and based many of them on real places that he knew personally or had read about. By the Lake The geography of the novels set in the Lake District is less faithful to the real world, but many locations have been identified, either by Ransome himself or by diligent readers. *The Lake: This appears to be a mix of Windermere and Coniston Water in the English Lake District. The topography of the lake is similar to Windermere, but the surrounding countryside more closely resembles the land around Coniston. *Rio: The principal town beside the Lake. It is based on Bowness-on-Windermere. *Holly Howe: The farm where the Walkers stay and the home port of the Swallow. This is modelled after Bank Ground Farm on the east side of Coniston Water. *Wild Cat Island: The island where the Swallows and Amazons camp is based on Blake Holme in Windermere, but the Secret Harbour at the south end comes from Peel Island in Coniston Water. *Kanchenjunga: The mountain climbed in Swallowdale is based on Coniston Old Man, named Kanchenjunga because of a well-known expedition to climb the Himalayan mountain while Ransome was writing the book. The Amazons' parents and Captain Flint had called it the Matterhorn when they climbed it thirty years earlier. *Strickland Junction where the Swallows transferred to the branch line to Rio is Oxenholme. Roger releases a pigeon at Oxenholme station at the start of Pigeon Post. *Beckfoot The home of the Amazons and their mother, Molly Blackett; on the Amazon River where it flows into the Lake. Appears in Pigeon Post and The Picts and the Martyrs. East Anglia Generally Ransome was much more faithful to real geography while writing the books set in this part of England. The towns, villages and waterways in the area are generally given their real names and the descriptions match, apart from changes brought about since the books were written. *Coot Club and The Big Six are set in and about Horning,Literary Norfolkhttps://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/155564 Location map a village on the River Bure in the northern Norfolk Broads. *We Didn't Mean to Go to Sea starts at Pin Mill on the River Orwell upstream from the ports of Felixstowe and Harwich. Ransome sailed the Nancy Blackett from the River Orwell to Flushing when researching the book. Essex The book set in Essex is also faithful to the real geography of the area. *Secret Water is set in and around Hamford Water, close to the resort town of Walton-on-the-Naze. Other books Ransome based the geography of the other three books, Peter Duck, Missee Lee and Great Northern? on various books, and often from his own experience. *Crab Island: The treasure island of Peter Duck was based on the volcanic Brazilian island of Trinidade described in E.F. Knight's book The Cruise of the Alerte. *The Hebridean setting of Great Northern? was based on a fishing trip Ransome made to Lewis in the Outer Hebrides when researching the area for the book. *The Chinese setting of Missee Lee reflects a visit Arthur Ransome made to China in 1926 & 1927 for the Manchester Guardian. He supported the Kuomintang rather than the British-backed warlords, and concluded that China was the most loathsome place he had ever visited.

Courir de Mardi Gras is Louisiana French for \\"Fat Tuesday Run\\". This rural Mardi Gras celebration is based on early begging rituals, similar to those still celebrated by mummers, wassailers, and celebrants of Halloween. As Mardi Gras is the celebration of the final day before Lent, celebrants drink and eat heavily, dressing in specialized costumes, ostensibly to protect their identities. In Acadiana, popular practices include wearing masks and costumes, overturning social conventions, dancing, drinking alcohol, begging, trail riding, feasting, and whipping. Mardi Gras is one of the few occasions when people are allowed to publicly wear masks in Louisiana. Dance for a Chicken: The Cajun Mardi Gras, a documentary by filmmaker Pat Mire, provides great insight into the history and evolution of this cultural tradition. In popular culture, two HBO series (the crime drama True Detective and the post Hurricane Katrina themed Treme) also make reference to the tradition. Origins Medieval French peasants enjoying a meal Barry Jean Ancelet, Cajun folklorist and retired professor at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, has explained the origins of the Courir in rural medieval France: These origins are found in the customs of Catholic medieval Europe, specifically the f√™te de la qu√©mande (\\"feast of begging\\") of medieval France. During the f√™te, which was a time when begging from house to house was a socially acceptable behavior, disguised revelers would go through the countryside visiting households and performing for offerings. This is similar to other contemporary traditional European customs such as mumming and wassailing which usually occur around Christmas, New Year's, and Epiphany. These traditions originated in a time when most of the land and money was held by the upper classes. The poor, at the end of long winters and short on food, would gather in groups and make their way from castle to manor house to beg for food from the wealthy, dancing and singing in return for the generosity of the nobles. French medieval carnival celebrations also featured contests and races, which may be the origins of the chicken chase associated with the courir. A few of the traditional runs have whipping and penance as part of their traditions. These traditions are traced to the Medieval Flagellants, who would hold processions through the streets whipping themselves and sometimes onlookers to beat the sin out of them. Other of the traditions associated with the courir are derived from the folk traditions of Pre-Christian Celtic Europe and are associated with fertility and renewal. Examples include the use of the burlap whip and the tune on which the Chanson de Mardi Gras are based, both of which are traced back to Brittany, a Celtic enclave on the Northwestern French coast near where the original settlers of Acadia were from. These traditions were carried to North America by European immigrants during the 17th and 18th centuries. In the mid to late 18th century when the Acadian settlers of the Canadian Maritimes were forcibly deported by the English, many made their way to South Louisiana, settling what would become known as the Acadiana region. The Cajuns, as they would become known to the rest of the world, have held on to many of their traditional customs, including their language (Acadian French became Cajun French), music, dances and religious festivals such as the courir. This determination to hold on to their religious customs and faith has been a major factor in creating the atmosphere that has allowed for the celebration of life, or \\"la joie de vivre,\\" that is so characteristic of Cajun life and culture in South Louisiana. Modern revival Although the tradition never died out, during the 1930s and 1940s it had begun to fade away, especially during the World War II era as many of the young men who participated were away serving in the armed forces. During the late 1940s and early 1950s the tradition began to be revived and in the 1960s got a major boost with the \\"Cajun renaissance\\", a grass roots effort to promote the unique local food, culture, music and language of the area. In 1993, documentary filmmaker Pat Mire chronicled the tradition with his film Dance for a Chicken: The Cajun Mardi Gras. The imagery of the event is represented in work by local artists such as Chuck Broussard, Francis Pavy, and Herb Roe and in the name and packaging of a locally brewed seasonal beer. The increased popularity of Cajun music and culture has also led to more nonlocal attention for the event. In 2011 the NPR show Snap Judgement did a series of interviews at one event and the courir was used in a story line by David Simon for his HBO series Treme. In 2014 the HBO crime drama True Detective included images of courir participants and created a cult group whose roots lay partially in the rural Mardi Gras traditions. Traditions Chasing a chicken through a muddy field People escape from ordinary life through the alcohol and the roles they portray in costume. In the early morning the riders or runners or Mardi Gras (as the troop and its individual members are known) gather in a central meeting place. As they gather, Le Capitaine (the leader of the Mardi Gras) and his co-capitaines explain the rules and traditions that must be followed. The Capitaine usually rides on horseback, wears a cape and carries a small flag. After he organizes the troop, the bands begin to play and he leads them on the route. Traditions vary in each town with the way it is carried out. Some towns have people on horse back, some on trailers and some on foot, and others use a variation of all three methods. The Capitaine is the first to approach the houses along the route, to ask permission to enter onto their property. At this point, in the spirit of frivolity, individual Mardi Gras will attempt to sneak onto the property. They are held in check by the Capitaines, who sometimes brandish a plaited burlap whip. The whips are designed to be flexible and not to inflict any serious damage onto their victims, but do produce a loud noise for the edification of onlookers. Participants claim one has not fully participated until one has been whipped. Once they are on the property, the revelers play a variety of pranks on the farmers and beg for food for the communal gumbo that lies at the end of the route. A prize ingredient is a live chicken, which is usually thrown into the air for the drunken Mardi Gras to chase through the muddy yards and fields. La Chanson de Mardi Gras The Mardi Gras song, known in the local Cajun French as \\"La Danse de Mardi Gras\\" and \\"La Vieille Chanson de Mardi Gras\\", is a traditional tune sung by the participants, although the exact lyrics vary greatly from town to town. The melody of the traditional folk song is similar to melodies of the Bretons from the northern coast of France. The tune is played in a minor mode not generally found in other Cajun music. This version is sung at the Church Point Courir de Mardi Gras: And the same song in English: A version of the song by the Balfa Brothers was included in the 1992 film Passion Fish. Many other musicians have recorded versions of the song, with notable artists being Zachary Richard Steve Riley and the Mamou Playboys, BeauSoleil and Cedric Watson. Costumes Many of the traditional costumes are derivatives of the costumes worn in early rural France during the same celebration. The costumes not only conceal the identities of the participants, but also allow them to parody authority figures and society. Role reversals can be employed such men dressing up like women or the rich to pose as the poor. The costumes also directly mock the nobility, the clergy and the educated; celebrants wear miter hats, mortarboards and capuchons, which were initially designed to mock the tall pointy hats worn by noble women. These hats are still worn, primarily by men. The name \\"capuchon\\" comes from the same root word, \\"cappa\\" in Latin, meaning a cape or hood, that gives us \\"cap\\" in English and \\"chapeau\\" in French. Chaperon (headgear) describes the development of the word. The hats are vibrantly decorated to match (or intentionally mis-match) the colorful Mardi Gras costumes that they accompany. The capuchons worn by Mardi Gras celebrants are completely unrelated to the pointy hats worn by the Ku Klux Klan (KKK), founded after the American Civil War, and, in fact, predate the KKK costumes by several hundred years. Originally the costumes were made from old work clothes decorated with cloth remnants and pieces of feed sack material, as many of the participants could not afford to buy material strictly for the event. This led to a patchwork style that has become associated with the costuming of the event. The shirts and pants of the costume are made by sewing together various pieces of cloth in a patchwork style. The strips of cloth are cut into fringing, and are sewn onto the sleeves, up and down the legs, and on the capuchon. The end effect is a riot of color and pattern. These costumes are also believed to have originated in Medieval times. The masks are made by taking ordinary wire mesh window screen and attaching large protruding noses and painting on features such as eyes and mouths. The masks are almost see through, but usually not enough to discern the wearer's identity. Many costumes and masks include animal features like beaks, feathers, hair, fur or tails.

Although there are many variations, most still practice the time honored tradition with Le Capitaine leading masked revelers on horseback to gather ingredients for making the communal gumbo. A few notable examples have gained attention as vital parts of the local Cajun culture. Basile In Basile the Courir was suspended during World War II, but was re-established during the 1960s. A provision allowing women to be a part of the Courir has been in place since the 1980s, and they are also permitted to serve as capitaines. The Basile Courir de Mardi Gras have a tradition of begging for nickels (called cinq sous). The participants come up to bystanders with an open palm in the traditional begging gesture, and if that does not work, they will try to dig into the pockets or clothes of the bystanders as a prank in an attempt to find the nickels. Choupic The rural Mardi Gras in Choupic involves a ritual chasing and flogging with willow tree branches. Young, unmarried men from sixteen or seventeen years old up into their twenties secretly organize the run each year, and they do not disclose their participation in the run to anyone. Once a man is married, he voluntarily stops his participation in the Mardi Gras run. Traditionally, the Mardis Gras were on foot, but today some adaptations have been made, such as the use of pickup trucks and the use of three-wheelers by some participants. The Mardis Gras meet early Mardi Gras morning at Possum Square and then climb into the back of a few pickup trucks to hide. The pickup trucks carry the Mardis Gras from one residential section to another where they chase the children of the town, and make them recite Catholic prayers before giving them their pre-Lenten flogging with willow tree branches or sometimes with the flexible end of a fishing pole. The Choupic courir de Mardi Gras differs from other courirs in that it does not involve the chasing of chickens nor ritual begging nor the use of horses as a means of transportation. Church Point 2017 Children's Courir de Mardi Gras in Church Point In Church Point the rural Mardi Gras is basically the same as it was in the old days of the early settlers. In 1961 Elton Richard formally organized the event, which until then had been individual, independent groups of riders. Only men are permitted to participate in the run, and all Mardi Gras must be fully masked and costumed. The Capitaine holds his position as leader for year after year, until he decides to relinquish it. He appoints his co-capitaines who, like himself, must not be masked. The Chanson de Mardi Gras in Church Point has its own unique lyrics. The Church Point Courir is held on the Sunday before Mardi Gras, a consequence of the formal organization in 1961. Elton Richard and Senator Paul Tate of Mamou flipped a coin to see who would have their official courir on Mardi Gras Day. Mamou won and as a result the Church Point Mardi Gras is on Sunday. Duralde In Duralde, an unincorporated village between the towns of Mamou and Basile on the southwestern prairies of Louisiana, is one of the Creole Mardi Gras'. Participants at times wear \\"white face\\", a way that the Mardi Gras runners dress as \\"the other\\" and overturn social conventions and the world for a day. Elton Elton, Louisiana is a small town in Jefferson Davis Parish, Louisiana 15 miles west of Eunice on U.S. Route 190. Although it was defunct for a long time, the Elton courir was revived in the mid-1990s. It follows the same route and its participants sing the same local variation of the Chanson as the courir in 1925. The ride starts at sunrise just to the north of town and goes through the Coushatta Indian Reservation and then heads south back toward Elton. Like many of the traditional Courirs the ride is an all-male affair. Eunice In Eunice the celebration dates from when the town was first established in the late 19th century. It was abandoned for a short time during World War II when many of the local young men were in the army, but was restarted in 1946. The roughly 2000 participants, both male and female, assemble at the National Guard Armory at the corner of South 9th Street and Maple Avenue at 6 a.m., and start the run 8 a.m. The route is long. They stop at farms along the route and beg for gumbo ingredients and call out \\"Cinq-sous pour les Mardi Gras!\\" or \\"Nickels for the Mardi Gras'!\\" If ingredients or money are given, they thank the givers of charity with a dance. By 3:00 p.m. the revelers return to town for a parade along Second Street. In 1997 a new addition was added to the festivities, the baking of the world's largest king cake. Gheens Gheens is located between Raceland and Lockport, Louisiana, about from New Orleans. Every year during their Cajun Mardi Gras Chase 20,000 people flock to the town of less than 1000 people for the event. Unlike other Cajun Mardi Gras' celebrations, the Gheens event features teen-aged boys and men dressed as ghouls riding in pickup trucks. After the morning parades the group meets behind the local church, where costumes are donned and the ground rules are laid out by the veteran runners to the newly initiated. Each of the newcomers must line up and be given a swat by each of the veterans with the yard long willow branches so they know how bad the switches can hurt if over used. The runners are given bells to pin on their clothing. They then load up into their trucks and attack the town with their willow switches, searching for children. They chase the children to \\"beat the sinful stuff out of them so they can be clean for the lent\\". Their young victims have the choice to either fall to their knees in a penitent position and say \\"Pardon! Pardon!\\" or make the Mardi Gras chase them, often taunting and daring them to catch and beat them more. LeJeune Cove LeJeune Cove is a rural community located about 3 miles north of Iota in Acadia Parish. According to the account published in the Crowley Post Signal on January 27, 2002, the run dates from the earliest days of the L'Anse LeJeune settlement until it disbanded in the 1950s. The LeJeune Cove Mardi Gras was then revived in 2002 after a lapse of approximately 50 years. All male riders on horseback and wagons wear traditional costumes with capuchons and handmade masks. The riders travel from farm to farm, visiting and dancing with their neighbors, begging for money and gumbo ingredients while singing their unique Mardi Gras song, all just as they had done prior to disbandment. The run is now held annually on the Saturday before Fat Tuesday. In the evening, a communal gumbo and dance is held at La Pay E Bas RV Park between Iota and Eunice. Mamou Mamou courir in the late 1990s In Evangeline Parish, the Mamou celebration starts with a street dance held the Monday evening before Mardi Gras, with bands such as Steve Riley and the Mamou Playboys performing. A crowd favorite is the Mamou variation of the Chanson de Mardi Gras. The next day a street party begins, in anticipation of the Courir, who have been riding through the countryside collecting ingredients for the evening gumbo. The Mamou Courir abides by the older traditions, with the Capitaines unmasked and all other revelers masked in the all-male troupe. They are accompanied by a wagon for the musicians and trailers for participants who do not have horses. The event was suspended twice in its history, during the American Civil War and during World War Two. By the mid-1940s the courir tradition in Mamou had declined but was revived by Alfred \\"Fred\\" Tate, Revon Reed, and Paul Tate, proprietors of the then newly opened \\"Fred's Lounge\\". Soileau The run in Soileau, Louisiana is one of the few Creole Courir de Mardi Gras in southwest Louisiana, and is thought to be just as old as the Cajun versions. The rural community of Soileau is located to the west of Duralde in Allen Parish, Louisiana not far from the Evangeline Parish, Louisiana line. They hold their run on the Monday before Mardi Gras, with its starting point at Andrew Cezar's sulky racing track. From there they head down Louisiana Highway 104. South Cameron Two Mardi Gras \\"stealing\\" a child's bicycle at the South Cameron Courir Traditional Mardi Gras Courirs have been held in Creole and Grand Chenier, small towns in southern Cameron Parish, since the beginning of the 20th century. This region of Southwest Louisiana has been plagued by multiple hurricanes throughout the years, including total destruction by Hurricanes Audrey, Rita, and Ike. As a result, Mardi Gras celebrations had been defunct for over a decade. The Courir was revived in 2014 by a group of Cameron Parish natives. The group mainly consisted of young men who were Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans. Some were displaced by the hurricanes, living in different parts of the state, and looking to bring camaraderie and tradition back to their community. The Mardi Gras ride throughout the countryside in cattle trailers pulled by pickup trucks. Men and women ride together. The Mardi Gras stop at multiple houses and business in and around the towns of Creole and Grand Chenier to dance, drink, play tricks, chase chickens, and gather ingredients for their communal gumbo that night. They wear traditional Cajun Mardi Gras costumes as well as modern variations. The two to three unmasked Capitaines regulate with burlap whips. A Fais do-do with live music follows the gumbo. This Courir is held two weekends before Mardi Gras day, however, dates are subject to change from year to year. Tee Mamou-Iota The longstanding tradition of the courir in the small community of Tee Mamou had waned by the late 1960s when new capitane was instrumental in preserving the tradition. An all women's group was established a few years later. The women's group does their run on Saturday before Mardi Gras and the men's run is on Mardi Gras day. The capitane and co-capitanes of Tee Mamou use a special variation of the burlap whip associated with the courir. The route of the courir ends in the nearby community of Iota, Louisiana. Iota has an organized event, with Cajun and Zydeco bands playing on the main stage throughout Mardi Gras day. The highlight of the day is the arrival of the Tee Mamou courirs riding into the town in a wagon after the route through the country. The courir then gathers on the main stage with the capitaine to sing their version of the Chanson de Mardi Gras. Once this task is completed, the Mardi Gras descend on the downtown area dancing and begging for loose change.

They were themselves of Obotrite origin and engineered the formation of a Slavic principality in the region. They became extinct in the male line in the early 12th century. Their capital was Mecklenburg Castle. The Nakonids derive their name -- a modern invention -- from the earliest attestable ruler of the dynasty, Nako, who fought the expansionist tendencies of the German kingdom in the mid and late 10th century before being defeated and converted to Christianity. The Nakonid leaders alternated between being lapsed Christians (mali christiani) and ardent missionaries of the Slavs who were the prime movers of the Germanisation and Christianisation of the Polabian Slavs. The German historian Heinz Stoob, in his retranslation of the chronicle of Helmold, derived the first genealogy of the Nakonids. Besides Helmold, Adam of Bremen, Thietmar of Merseburg, and Saxo Grammaticus are important sources for Nakonid history. Despite these sources, uncertainty exists concerning the nature of the Nakonid rule over their people. Historiographers sometimes call them Samtherrscher or Oberherrscher, meaning \\"overlords\\". The primary sources, in Latin, use the various titles regulus (subking), dux (duke), and tyrannus (tyrant or usurper) to describe them. When Canute Lavard was granted lordship over the Obotrites in 1128 by Emperor Lothair II, he took the Slavic title knes. The Nakonids were originally the rulers of the Obotrites, but under Nako they obtained dominance over the neighbouring Slavs: the Wagrii with their capital at Starigard, the Polabians with their chief cities of Liubice and Ratzeburg, the Linonen with their capital at Lenzen, and the Warnabi. This Nakonid principality, the Obotrites Confederation as it is sometimes called, was composed of these and other smaller tribes each under its own chieftain, but with all recognising the overlordship of the Obotrites chief, perhaps because they served as a buffer (Limes Saxoniae) between the more powerful Saxons and the more easterly Slavs, and they also had older relations with the Franks to the west. The Obotrites had made a pact with Charlemagne as early as the Battle of the Sventanafeld in 798. The Nakonids contested supremacy of the Slavs of the Elbe and Baltic coast with the Veleti to the east and the Polani to the south. The Polans under the Piasts drew many Slavs to their banner by offering a Christian alternative to Germany. The Nakonids probably turned to Christian Denmark to avoid the pressures of Saxon missionary work and the tithes and other taxes imposed by the Saxon Church. However, the other tribes each had their own favoured divinities (Prove in Wagria, Radegast in Mecklenburg, Swantewit in Rugia) and clung to them strongly when Christianity was foisted upon them. The opposing influences of Slavic paganism and Saxon Christianity is seen in that several Nakonids had both a Slavic name and a Saxon, Christian name. Nako turned to Christianity after his defeat in the Battle of Recknitz in 955. He established his seat at Mecklenburg. His sons Mstivoj and Mstidrag and grandsons Mstislaw and Udo are mostly associated with the Slavic uprising of 983. All of them either abandoned Christianity or were \\"bad Christians\\" (at least for a time). Udo's successor, Gottschalk, is perhaps the most famous member of the family. He was educated by the Church, but initially made war on the Saxons in revenge for his father's death (1028). He was captured and his lands and position given to Ratibor. After a sojourn in Scandinavia and England, he returned to the Elbe region with a renewed sense of Christian purpose. He subdued the Veleti and the Diocese of Bremen is said to have \\"feared him as king.\\"The Cambridge Medieval History, III, 805-806. Had he not died in a pagan uprising, \\"he would have brought all pagans to the Christian faith.\\" His son Henry subdued the Rani and encouraged the missionary work of Vicelinus. Henry had four sons, but two predeceased him and the two who survived fought over the inheritance, dying in 1128 and 1129. Sources Gwatkin, H. M., Whitney, J. P. (ed) et al.

He queried her as to why she appeared so aloof, even angry. MacGill responded that her facial expressions were a means of dealing with fear. Beginning in 1949 she worked in the posh salons of designers and 7th Avenue (Manhattan) showrooms. She believed her success as a model was a product of her desire to make good.

The district also closed Fidelity Elementary School at that time.

Whether or not folklore has become mixed up with actual history, the Fidelity School did exist on Bolden Street. Two years previously in 1930, the Galena Park Independent School District (GPISD) had become an official body and their placing of a facility at the Fidelity site was the second act designed to nurture African-American student education. The GPISD's ownership of two lots on East Street and their tax exempt status suggest that the body or its antecedents had begun providing education to black children eight years before it became an independent school district. This school housed eight grade levels and offered courses in science, reading, writing, math, agriculture, and home economics.Wilson, Josetta Boudreaux. Oral history interview October 12, 2007. Tapes and transcript are in possession of interviewer. The classes contained twenty to thirty pupils almost equally spread across the various age groups. All were taught the same courses ‚Äî reading writing and arithmetic. Children had near one-on-one instruction as they each had to approach the instructor's desk and read aloud.Wilson, Joesetta Boudreaux In 1931 Mrs. Emerson taught classes alongside her colleague Laura Bailey.Galena Park Independent School District Board minutes September 1931. GPISD archives, Galena Park, Texas. The Fidelity School then experienced growing pains whereupon the GPISD board authorized removal of a partition between two rooms of the school. Mrs. Emerson was re-elected to the position of principal and Laura Bailey was also re-elected by the board. The board also authorized the superintendent to add one additional African American teacher to the staff of the school. By 1937, the GPISD realized that both white and black school populations were still growing and petitioned the state for $85,000, $1000 to $2000 of which was to be used to add two more rooms to the one-room Fidelity School. The old white elementary school was abandoned in 1938 when the GPISD built a new facility. When subsequent improvements to the Fidelity school proved necessary, lumber from the abandoned white student school was used to add two rooms to the one-room facility.Series 1937 Galena Park Independent School District Schoolhouse Bonds. Office of Attorney General of State of Texas. June 29, 1937. While much of the stability and growth of the Fidelity School was tethered to the growth and development of Clinton, Fidelity had additional problems inherent in the make up of the African- American community, which was splintered by the demographics of the area. One part of the black community lived in the southern portion of Clinton while the other was located several miles away in a thinly populated neighborhood along the two-block wide five-mile long Burns Road. The Fidelity Addition took its name from the Fidelity Shipyard located a few hundred yards from Fidelity or Burns Road. To add to the diversity of those demographics, blacks also lived in section houses spread further west along Clinton Drive near McCarty Drive.Carr, Katherine Allum. The men of these families worked for the railroad that formed part of the terminus along the port at Clinton. By 1947, the African-American population had grown to the point where more teachers were employed to meet the educational needs of the black-student population. The hiring of Mr. Arthur C. Lilly in 1947 proved significant - he would become the only principal of the junior/senior high school.Lilly, Arthur C. Oral history interview September 13, 2007. Tapes and transcripts are in possession of interviewer. Mrs. Freddie Sandle had carried out most of the teaching for more than twenty years. Fidelity School was still an eight grade school, but by 1947 it had been expanded to include ten classrooms, a library, an office, a music room, a softball field and a bus parking area. Once students finished the eighth grade, they were bussed to Phillis Wheatley High School in Houston in order to finish their secondary education. In 1934, the GPISD passed a motion to pay Jason Humber $40.00 a month to transport the African American children to Houston to attend high school that year.Galena Park Independent School District board minutes September 1934.

Before 1949, students only had to finish the eleventh grade to get a high school diploma and most students who attended Wheatley from Fidelity had already taken algebra so they were able to skip a grade. The commuter system was a troublesome process, therefore Mr. Arthur C. Lilly petitioned the GPISD to allow the school to add one grade a year until it possessed twelve grades.Lilly, Arthur C. In the 1953-1954 school year, the first graduating class of five students matriculated from Fidelity School consisting of Nora Eagleton, Marie Nelson, Hilda Guillory, Effie Watts, and Calvin O. White. While Fidelity's number of grades grew, a further factor led to the separation of the elementary and high schools. In 1951, the Galena Park City Council approved the development of a shopping center and a new subdivision of 330 homes priced between $7,400 and $8,000 that would be called the Galena Manor Addition.Houston Chronicle April 18, 1950 p. 5. The new development was located immediately adjacent to the Fidelity neighborhood. Inasmuch as Galena Manor provided the link between the two black communities of Fidelity and the South Main Street area of Galena Park, its 330 new families gave a direct boost to the school's population. The GPISD ordered the building of two ultra- modern school buildings, the junior/senior high school and the elementary school.Leslie, Roger and Edwards, Sue Elkins, p. 207 The high school opened in January 1955 and Mr. Arthur C. Lilly became its first and only principal. Built adjacent to the high school, the elementary school opened in September 1956 and Mrs. Freddie Emerson Sandle, by now the longest employed educator at the Fidelity Schools, became the Principal. When she retired in 1960, Mr. John T. Lane took over as second principal. 1970 saw the Fidelity Elementary and High Schools close due to court ordered desegregation. Some of the teachers along with the black student population were integrated into other Galena Park schools. The long legacy of the Fidelity Schools ended when a failure to reach consensus by the citizens of Galena Park on the fate of facility led to its demolition in 1986.Leslie, Roger and Edwards, Sue Elkins, p. 36 Notable alumni *Craig Anthony Washington, class of 1958, former US Congressman Background Mascot - Black Panther Colors - Purple and Gold Notable Accomplishments Academics *Integrated Science Fair District Champions 1956Leslie, Roger and Edwards, Sue Elkins.

In August 2007, Reed was selected to appear in the fifth season of the U.S. television series Dancing with the Stars. Early life Reed was born in South Miami, Florida at the South Miami Hospital to Barbara Foster and John Reed. At the age of thirteen, Reed moved with his family about north of their middle class Miami neighborhood to Vero Beach, which Reed refers to as \\"a little surfer town located on the east coast of central Florida.\\" The family's proximity to the beach allowed Reed to surf just about every day.

While in Italy, Reed was featured as the sole male model in the Spring/Summer 2004 catalog for Italian sportswear company SLAMSLAM website Although his European experience was positive, the ongoing Iraq War left Europeans \\"a bit sour\\" towards Reed and other Americans working in Europe, and Reed returned to the United States. A 2004 meeting with internationally acclaimed photographer Bruce Weber led to Reed's big break, a photo shoot and website video appearance for Abercrombie & Fitch.

The T93 (Type 93) Sniper Rifle () is a 7.62√ó51mm bolt-action rifle designed and manufactured in Taiwan. History It was first shown to the public during the 2007 Taipei Aerospace & Defense Technology Exhibition. The primary organization responsible for the development of this rifle is the 205th Armory, with technical assistance from unspecified domestic and foreign firms. Design By its appearance, the T93 is closely patterned after the M24 Sniper Weapon System.http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2008/new/sep/1/today- fo8.htm It features a similar action with internal magazine. The barrel is floated for its entire length. One notable departure from the M24 design is the absence of the front sight base. The adjustable-length stock appears to be H-S Precision PST-25, but is said to have been redesigned using ergonomic measurements of Taiwanese soldiers. As displayed, the T93 prototype is equipped with a Leupold Ultra M3A riflescope on an extended Picatinny rail mount, allowing the use of night-vision equipment with the scope. The scope mount is similar to the McCann Industries MIRS, but lacks rails on either side. The bipod is a Harris Ultralight 1A2 Series. According to official news release, T93 scored a best 3-round group size of 0.3 MOA at 800 meters during trials. It was not known whether factory match or hand-loaded ammunition was used. The rifle also passed endurance tests by firing 6,000 rounds without any failure. Production and Usage Potential customers are scout sniper and special operations/anti-terrorism units in the military, as well as police SWAT units. In September 2008, the Republic of China Marine Corps announced it will procure 179 T93 rifles and over 100,000 rounds of sniper ammunition over the next two years. One hundred thirty-two rifles and 74,000 rounds of ammunition will be delivered in 2009, while the remaining 47 rifles and 26,000 rounds of ammunition will be delivered in 2010. Total procurement cost is approximately NT$120M (US$3.8M).

It is based on the proven T86 assault rifle incorporating features from the M16 and AR-18 rifles with more modern features. The T91 is lighter and shorter than the T65 it replaces and has a 3-position telescopic stock to allow adjustment based on individual requirements. History T91 was a further development of the T86 assault rifle which had been intended to replace the T65 assault rifle series in Taiwan military service. Experience on the previous design and feedback from various users were incorporated into the T91. Development was completed in 2002, and volume production commenced in 2003. There are rumors that arms dealers had secretly inquired about the possibility of sales to certain militant groups in Southeast Asia, but were reportedly rejected by the Republic of China defense ministry (MND). The MND neither confirmed nor denied such rumors.Êù±Âçó‰∫ûÊüêÂúãÂèõËªçÊ¨≤Ë≤∑T91Êà∞È¨•Ê≠•ÊßçË¢´ÊãíÁµï(A rebel army in Southeast Asia desired to buy T91 but rejected by Republic of China army) Design T91 is a gas-operated short-stroke, air-cooled, rotating bolt, magazine- or drum-fed, select-fire, modularized military rifle compatible with various tactical accessories. Similar to its predecessor, T91 is a shorter version of the T65K2 assault rifle, giving the operator higher mobility and ease of aiming in a confined space. T91 has a 4-position selector switch: S ‚Äì safe, 1 ‚Äì semi-automatic, 3 ‚Äì three-round burst, and A ‚Äì automatic. Like the T65K2, T91 utilizes an M16A2-style front post, rear peephole sight. The rear sight, mounted on the detachable handle, is adjustable for windage and elevation. Operation of the charging handle, magazine release, and bolt release are the same as the M16. One notable difference is that the T91 does not have a forward assist, and the brass deflector is not as pronounced. The action of the T91 is based on the T65 series. However, parts are not interchangeable because the bolt lug on the T91 is shorter by 1 mm. T91 also inherits the modularized gas piston system from the T86, allowing easy removal for maintenance without the risk of losing small parts. The telescopic stock on the T91 was designed based on the experience of military and police personnel with the M4 Carbine. The resulting product has improved recoil transfer and handling qualities. A rubber recoil pad is also added for comfort. The handguards are triangular in shape. T91 has a barrel with flash suppressor. Rate of rifling twist is . Due to the use of a shorter barrel, the T91 has 20% more recoil than the T65K2. Average group size at 175 m (191.4 yd) also increased by . The chamber and bore are chrome-lined and can fire 5.56√ó45mm NATO ammunition. Standard-issue 30-round magazines for the T91 feature indicator holes for the top 2-15 rounds as well as two protrusions on each side to avoid over-insertion. However, standard STANAG magazines may also be used. Accessories T91 has a MIL-STD-1913 rail on the top of the receiver, handguard, and the front-sight block. The standard-issue detachable handle may be removed to accommodate a variety of optical sights and scopes. T91 can also be equipped with the T85 40mm grenade launcher to serve in a squad-level fire support role. The Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology developed a T91 indoor shooting simulator for infantry marksmanship training. This equipment is capable of simulating various weather conditions, shooting distances, and wind states. For training purposes, a paintball conversion kit is also provided. Other attachments include red dot sights or holographic weapon sights similar to EOTech models. Variants The T91K3 features polygonal rifling which increases barrel life and improves accuracy. The 205th Arsenal and the National Defense University are jointly developing a nickel-boron finish for the bolt carriers which would allow the weapon to fire about 10,500 rounds without any lubrication whatsoever.  List of variants  * T91 assault rifle * T91 CQC * T91S * T91K1 * T91K3 Production and usage Taiwanese military policeman on duty at the Taipei Songshan Airport. In 2003, the Taiwanese army ordered 101,162 T91 combat rifles as force-wide replacements of all service rifles, with a delivery schedule from 2004 to 2008. The total budget amount was NT$1,803 million (US$54.6 million), placing the unit price at about NT$17,800 (US$539). As of April 2006, nine Taiwanese army armored, mechanized infantry, and infantry brigades have fully converted to the T91. In 2005, the Taiwanese military police ordered 12,069 T91 combat rifles to equip garrison units in the Taipei capital region. Delivery would span over the next three years. Export sales of the T91 to Jordan and Kuwait have been officially confirmed. The Jordanian Defense Forces reportedly conducted comparison tests between several service rifles in a desert environment. The T91 was found to have reliability comparable to the AK-47, scoring better than the M16, thereby making it very dependable for desert conditions. Indonesia procured as many as 10,000 T91 combat rifles from Taiwan to equip police and border patrol units. The UAE acquired T91 rifles after Sheikh Hamid bin Zayed Al Nahyan made a visit to Taiwan, and soon quantities of T91 were supplied to the UAE. T91 uppers have also been exported to the United States through Wolf Performance Ammunition. When it was first released Wolf is reported to have sold more than a thousand uppers in one day.

Early life Richard Lawrence Grimsdale was born on 18 September 1929 in Australia, where his father, an English engineer, was working on construction of the suburban railway system for the Metropolitan-Vickers company. The family returned to England, where he was educated at Manchester Grammar, and then studied electrical engineering at Manchester University, where he earned his Bachelor of Science, his Master of Science in 1951, writing a thesis on \\"Computing Machines - Design of Test Programmes\\", and ultimately his Doctor of Philosophy, writing his thesis on the \\"Transistor Digital Computer\\" under the supervision of Frederic Calland Williams. Career In 1953, whilst still a post-graduate research student at Manchester University, Grimsdale achieved one of the first major landmarks in his career with his design and development work on the Metrovick 950, the world's first computer made from transistors rather than valves or electromechanical devices. The computer used early point-contact transistors which were the first generation of transistors, however later developments of the machine used more advanced junction transistors which offered better performance. Grimsdale also worked on the Ferranti Mark I computer, a commercial development of the Manchester Mark 1 computer. He also designed the 100-nanosecond read-only memory for the Atlas computer. He remained at Manchester University until 1960, then began to work at Associated Electrical Industries as a research engineer. In 1967 he left AEI and joined the Sussex University's electrical engineering faculty as a lecturer. His research at Sussex University included work on computer graphics, computer networking systems and VLSI accelerator chips for generating three-dimensional images. Grimsdale died from a heart infection at his home in Brighton on 6 December 2005. He was survived by his wife Shirley Roberts Grimsdale and daughters Susan and Kathryn.

It was licensed to issue degrees by the California State Department of Education and its degrees were recognized by several dozen other schools - reportedly including Harvard and Johns Hopkins - but its attempts to attain accreditation never came to fruition. The college was reported to have 174 students in 1978 and 350 students in 1980. It had no classrooms, libraries or laboratories, but its administrative offices were located at 1019 Gayley Avenue in Los Angeles. It ceased operations in 1986 and its students were transferred to another unaccredited college, William Lyon University. Operating in the pre-internet period, the college had a business model that was ahead of its time. As its motto, In Vestigiis Institutorum Antiquorum indicated, the college followed the methods of the first universities, where students were paired with outstanding tutors. Students could earn credit studying at different universities before completing their dissertation. Many of the works of its students were published by the College under the imprint Guild of Tutors Press. In the area of economics, the late Dr. Hans F. Sennholz was one of the tutors who participated over many years, graduating students of renown in the field of economic education and public policy. One example is Alejandro Chafuen, president and CEO of Atlas Economic Research Foundation since 1991 and president and founder of the Hispanic American Center of Economic Research. Another is Juan Carlos Cachanosky, a renowned professor in Argentina and Guatemala. Also in the field of economics, Robert L.

Together with its adjacent formal gardens, it is surrounded by parkland. The site of the house has been a seat of the Cholmondeley family since the 12th century. The present house replaced a timber-framed hall nearby. It was built at the start of the 19th century for George Cholmondeley, 1st Marquess of Cholmondeley, who designed most of it himself in the form of a crenellated castle. After the death of the Marquess, the house was extended to designs by Robert Smirke to produce the building in its present form. The house is designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building. The first formal garden was designed in the 17th century by George London. Following neglect in the 18th century, the garden was re- ordered by William Emes, who also created the landscape park. During the 20th century the garden was further developed under the care of Lavinia, widow of the late 6th Marquess. The park and gardens are listed Grade II in the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. In the park and gardens are a number of other listed buildings. The most important of these is St Nicholas' Chapel, which dates from the 13th century and contains much 17th-century furniture. It is listed Grade I in the National Heritage List for England. Standing across the main drive is a wrought iron screen and gateway made by Robert Bakewell in 1722 for the Old Hall and moved here in the early 19th century. This is listed as Grade II*. The other Grade II listed buildings include the altered remains of the Old Hall, five of the lodges in and around the estate and a variety of structures in the gardens. During the Second World War, the house and grounds were used for a variety of military purposes which included a hospital. Until her death in November 2015, the house was occupied by Lavinia, Dowager Marchioness of Cholmondeley, mother of the present Marquess who lives in the other family seat, Houghton Hall in Norfolk. The house is not open to the public, but the park and gardens are open during the summer season. A variety of events are organised in the grounds and one of the lodges can be used as a holiday cottage. History Old Hall alt=Drawing of a two-storey classical house with statues and urns along the roof The site of the house has been a family seat of the Cholmondeley family since the 12th century. In the 16th century the house was a timber-framed hall standing on a moated platform. During the English Civil War in the following century, the house and its separate chapel were damaged by the Parliamentarians and were subsequently repaired by Robert Cholmondeley, 1st Earl of Leinster. In 1701 Hugh Cholmondeley, 1st Earl of Cholmondeley commissioned William Smith of Warwick to encase the house with brick and to add features such as giant columns and balustraded parapets with urns and statues. By 1712 the earl had lost patience with Smith and asked John Vanbrugh to prepare a new design, but it was never executed. In 1722 wrought iron gates and railings made by Robert Bakewell were used to enclose the forecourt of the house. In the 18th century the house was neglected. In 1770 it was inherited by George Cholmondeley, the 4th Earl of Cholmondeley, who decided to demolish most of the Old Hall and to replace it with a new building. Present house Building of the new house in the style of a castle began in 1801. It was designed mainly by the Earl in collaboration with the architect William Turner of Whitchurch. The design was symmetrical; the entrance front facing west and consisting of two castellated blocks, between which was a single-storey loggia. Behind the loggia was the full-height entrance hall. Facing the park on the east side of the house were the three main state rooms. This phase of building the house was completed in 1805. Much of the construction material was recycled from the old house, including bricks, glass, windows, woodwork and chimneypieces. Bakewell's railings, without the gates, were moved to form a screen on the main drive. In 1817 George Cholmondeley (now the 1st Marquess) started a series of enlargements to the house beginning with a new dining room. Two years later, a family wing with tall rectangular tower was added to the south of the house; both of these additions were designed by the Marquess. They were followed by the addition of two octagonal angle turrets. The Marquess died in 1828 and soon after that, Robert Smirke was commissioned to make further additions and alterations. The main addition was a round tower at the southeast corner of the family wing. Smirke also brought forward the central tower of the east front by adding a canted bay, giving the house its present appearance. This work was completed in 1829. Later history alt=A room converted into a hospital ward with nurses and patients in beds In common with many other country estates and stately homes, special roles were allocated to Cholmondeley during the Second World War. Between July and October 1940 the grounds were the home of troops serving the Czechoslovak government-in-exile. Later they were used in the preparations for Operation Anthropoid, an assassination attempt on Reinhard Heydrich. Cholmondeley was also employed as a Royal Naval Auxiliary Hospital which treated serving servicemen suffering from severe nervous conditions. The house was designated a Grade II* listed building on 10 June 1952. The current Marquess, David Cholmondeley, 7th Marquess, does not live at Cholmondeley but at the other family seat, Houghton Hall in Norfolk. Until her death in November 2015, Cholmondeley Castle was occupied by his mother, Lavinia. Architecture Exterior The house is constructed in sandstone with roofs of slate and lead. It is mainly in two storeys with a basement, and has towers rising to a greater height. The entire building has a battlemented parapet. The entrance front faces west and consists of two three-storey wings in three bays with a single-storey three- bay loggia between them. The windows in the lateral blocks have Gothic-style arches and contain Y-tracery. In the loggia the windows each have two lights under almost circular heads. Above and behind the loggia the upper storeys of the entrance hall also contain Y-tracery. On the right side of the entrance front is a square five-storey tower, which is linked to an octagonal turret containing arrow slits. The garden front, facing east, has octagonal corner turrets between which is a large canted bay window which rises up to form a half-tower. The section to the left of this faces south and is in two storeys with three bays. It contains French windows and windows with trefoil heads containing Y-tracery. There is then a two-storey two-bay section and finally Smirke's service wing with its large round tower containing arrow slits. Interior The loggia leads into the double-height entrance hall. This has blind arcades on the side walls. Opposite the entrance is an open arcade leading to a north-south passage. Beyond this is the ante-room with its large, canted bay window. This room has a simple dentil cornice. To the north of it is the dining room with a marble mantlepiece, a cornice decorated with gilded flowers and leaves and, in the ceiling, rosettes with a large central rose with a chandelier. To the south of the ante-room is the drawing room. Here the cornice is decorated with arrows pointing downward and there is a central rose with a chandelier. Leading from the drawing room is the staircase hall with an open-well staircase. The hall is top-lit from a timber lantern and the stairs are in black marble. The wrought iron balustrade on the stairs and landing was made by Robert Bakewell and moved from the Old Hall. The handrail is in rosewood. To the south of the staircase hall is the nursery suite and the library. The Bird Room, between the staircase and the drawing room, contains a collection of muniments. The arrangement of rooms and corridors in the upper rooms is complex. The kitchens and domestic offices are in the basement. Grounds Chapel alt=Small brick Neoclassical chapel behind ornate iron gates The Grade I listed chapel originated as a timber-framed structure in the 13th century. It was encased in brick and extended in 1717 and further additions were made in 1829 and 1840. It has a slate roof and is in a cruciform plan. Much of its furniture dates from the 17th century. The Cholmondeley family pew is at the west end, in an elevated position. Gardens and park The first formal gardens were established in the 17th century by Hugh Cholmondeley, 1st Earl of Cholmondeley. These were in the French style, containing canals and alle√©s. The gardens were designed by George London, and included gates and railings by Jean Tijou and statues by Jan van Nost. Following neglect in the 18th century, the 4th Earl employed William Emes to re-model the gardens. Emes converted the formal garden into a landscape park, planting large numbers of trees and creating lakes. Further development of the gardens was carried out by John Webb, a student of Emes, who probably designed the terrace immediately around the house. Since the middle of the 20th century and until her death, the gardens were in the care of Lavinia, the Dowager Marchioness, who improved them and added additional features. alt=A lily pond with a temple-like structure at the far end The house is surrounded by a terrace, to the south of which are three interlinked gardens: the Silver Garden, the Lily Pool Garden and an area containing a swimming pool. Beyond are lawns, groups of specimen trees and shrubs, gravelled paths and a walled garden. A major feature is the Temple Garden which contains an irregular pool within which are two small islands. On one of the islands is a structure in the form of a temple. At the west end of the garden is a rotunda. To the northwest of the Temple Garden is the Rose Garden. Beyond the gardens is a park, which is mainly grassland with some trees. Features in the park include a ha-ha and two lakes; Chapel Mere and Deer Park Mere. Since 10 June 1985 the gardens and park have been listed as Grade II in the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. The area covered by the designation amounts to about 240 ha. Listed buildings alt=A gatehouse with a tower and a gateway to the right, all battlemented In addition to the house being listed Grade II* and the chapel Grade I, there are other listed structures associated with the house. Richard Bakewell's screen, standing across the main drive, is listed as Grade II*. All the other listed buildings are designated Grade II. Of these, five are associated with the Temple Garden: the temple itself, the rotunda, the bridge over the pond with its parapets consisting of stone dolphins, a sculpture in lead by van Nost depicting three cherubs, and the gated entrance, possibly by Jean Tijou. The north and south gates of the chapel enclosure, made by Bakewell in 1722 and installed in 1829, are both listed. Of the five lodges associated with the castle, three of them that lie within the grounds are listed: Dee Park Lodge, on the southeast approach to the castle; Park House Lodge, on the north approach; and Somerset Lodge, a gatehouse on the east approach, designed by S. S. Teulon. The other two lodges stand at the entrances to the grounds: Nantwich Lodge, at the original south entrance, and Beeston Lodge, a lodge and gateway at the east approach. The remaining listed buildings are the reduced and altered remains of the Old Hall, the Mews adapted from the former stables, Park House and Scotch Farm developed from the original stables. A bridge on the east approach to the house is also listed. Present day Goat tower on grounds The house is not open to visitors but during the summer season the gardens are open to the public. Available facilities include tea rooms, picnic and play areas, and a nature trail. Visitors can see a variety of farm animals in the stables and paddocks. During the summer season a programme of events is organised, including an annual Pageant of Power. Somerset Lodge is available for use as a holiday cottage. The Cheshire Hunt Hounds meet here occasionally.

It is the second original rifle design conducted by the 205th Armory of Combined Service Forces, Republic of China (Taiwan). Though it saw limited production and service after a protracted development process, it became the basis of the T91 Assault Rifle currently in volume production for the ROC armed forces. History Development of the T86 started in 1992, with the stated objective of replacing the venerable T65 series. Several radical concepts, such as caseless ammunition, were explored but ultimately rejected due to high risk. Still, the XT86 prototype revealed to the public in 1996 demonstrated several innovative features and significant departure from US influence in firearms design. However, the ROC military was more confident in the tried-and-true T65 design, and instructed the 205th Armory to redesign the rifle. The XT86 pre-production model rolled out in 1997 showed a return to the T65's features, especially the T65K3 carbine. The T86 design was finalized in 1998 and officially named the 5.56 mm T86 Combat Rifle (5.56ÂÖ¨ÂéòT86Êà∞È¨•Ê≠•Êßç). Design The finalized T86 design is an evolution of the T65 series. It inherits the short-stroke gas piston operated system from the T65 as well as the rotating bolt design. Upper and lower receiver are made with aircraft-grade aluminum. The side-folding metal stock on the prototype was replaced with an M4 carbine style polymer telescopic stock and buffer mechanism. The polymer handguard from the prototype was retained. The controls of the T86 are similar to the T65 and M16. The T86 has a 4-position selector with safe, semiautomatic, three-round burst, and automatic settings. Like the T65K2, T86 utilizes an M16A2-style front post/rear peephole sight. The rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation. One notable difference is that the T86 does not have a forward assist, and the brass deflector is shaped differently. The T86 has a barrel with flash suppressor. The rate of rifling twist is one twist in . The bore is chrome-lined and the T86 can fire all 5.56√ó45mm NATO standard ammunition. Magazines used by the ROC military feature two protrusions on each side to avoid over-insertion, but standard STANAG magazines are compatible. The T86 is modular and can be field-stripped without using special tools. The gas piston system and the trigger assembly can be removed as complete assemblies for maintenance, reducing the risk of losing small parts. Accessories An attachment point is provided on the carrying handle for an optional scope mount. The T85 40 mm grenade launcher, standard issue of the ROC Army, may be mounted on the T86 carbine. Production and usage Contrary to initial expectations, ROC Army and Marine Corps did not order T86 carbines in large quantities. Defense budget priorities during the late 1990s forced ROC military to delay the replacement of T65K1 and T65K2 assault rifles. A small quantity of T86 did enter service with the ROC Navy Underwater Demolition Team and underwent rigorous trials in widely varied environmental conditions. Jordanian royal guards and special troops are reportedly armed with Taiwan made T86 carbines.‰∏≠ËèØÊ∞ëÂúãËªçÊñπË≠âÂØ¶ÂúãÈÄ†T86Ê≠•ÊßçÂèäT91Ê≠•ÊßçÈä∑ÂæÄÁ¥ÑÊó¶ Users ‰∏≠ËèØÊ∞ëÂúãËªçÊñπË≠âÂØ¶ÂúãÈÄ†T86Ê≠•ÊßçÂèäT91Ê≠•ÊßçÈä∑ÂæÄÁ¥ÑÊó¶(T86 & T91 sold to Jordan confirmed by ROC army)  * Haiti Haiti See also * T65 assault rifle * T91 assault rifle * XT-97 Assault Rifle References *ÊßçÁ•ûÔΩûÂ∞èÂè£ÂæëÊ≠¶Âô®Ë®≠Ë®àÂàÜÊûêÔºèÊà∞Ë°ìÈÅãÁî® External links * Modern Firearms - T65, T86 and T91 assault rifle (Taiwan) Category:5.56 mm assault rifles Category:Carbines Category:Short stroke piston firearms Category:Firearms of the Republic of China Category:ArmaLite AR-10 derivatives Category:AR-15 style rifles Category:Weapons and ammunition introduced in 2000 ","title":"T86 assault rifle"},{"id":"13034701","text":"Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center at Abilene (TTUHSC Abilene) is a branch campus of Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center (TTUHSC) located in Abilene, Texas.

He has done guitars for numerous films such as The Replacements, The Scorpion King, Spiderman 2, Iron Man 2, Green Lantern, The Bourne Legacy, and composed and performed the music on the hit series, Justified, on FX channel, with keyboardist, Steve Porcaro (Toto). He also composes for Comedy Central's The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore. He also lectured at LA's Guitar Institute of Technology (GIT). He now lives in Los Angeles with his wife and son and has recently completed a new ground- breaking album with Keith Emerson titled The Three Fates Project with the Munich Radio Orchestra, conducted by Maestro Terje Mikkelsen and has finished work on an album \\"Beyond The Stars - Keith Emerson\\" with the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields and also the follow-up long-awaited third guitar instrumental album called Celluloid Debris available exclusively at www.marcbonillamusic.com. He also currently tours with Harry Shearer (aka Derek Smalls from Spinal Tap) playing guitar, bass and mandolin. Although Marc appears in the video for Toy Matinee's \\"Ballad of Jenny Ledge,\\" he did not actually play lead guitar on the album. Lead guitar work for the Toy Matinee LP was done by LA studio guitarist Tim Pierce, though Marc replaced him for the touring incarnation of the band along with Sheryl Crow. Around the time that EE Ticket was released, Yamaha musical instruments produced a prototype left-handed Marc Bonilla model guitar. This guitar was embellished with comic book superheroes, of which Marc was very fond. (www.marcbonillamusic.com) Aside from his work as a musician, Bonilla was also a graphic artist, who did album cover designs for Ronnie Montrose, with his 1986 solo album Territory and with his band Montrose, the 1987 album Mean. Fallen Angels Tour 2017 In April 2017 Bonilla and Eddie Jobson began the \\"Fallen Angels Tour,\\" a tribute to the music of John Wetton & Keith Emerson, commencing at London's Under The Bridge venue at Chelsea F.C.'s Stamford Bridge stadium on 22 April.

The Warnabi, Warnavi, Warnahi, Wranovi, Wranefzi, Wrani, Varnes, or Warnower were a West Slavic tribe of the Obotrite confederation in the ninth through eleventh centuries. They were one of the minor tribes of the confederation living in the Billung Mark on the eastern frontier of the Holy Roman Empire. They were first mentioned by Adam of Bremen. Etymologically their name is related to the river, the Warnow (also Warnof, Wrana, or Wranava), along which they settled in the region of Mecklenburg. It may have meant \\"crow river\\" or \\"black river\\" in their Slavic language, or been derived from the name of the Warni (from earlier warjan), a Germanic people who had previously lived in the same area. The name Warnabi may be a combination of Warni and Abodriti. In the second half of the ninth century the chief town of the Warnabi was on an island in Lake Sternberg at the site of the castle of Gross Raden. The centre of their culture was near the present towns Sternberg and Malchow. From 1171, 1185, and 1186 there are references to the land of the Warnabi: the Warnowe.

Morrison is assisted by Li Shigong (left) and Chen Laoyi (right). Cai Gao (1788‚Äì1818), also known as Tsae A-ko and by various other names, was the first Protestant convert in mainland China. He has also been called the first Western-style type-cutter and letterpress printer. Name The real name of China's first Protestant convert is uncertain, although his surname was \\"almost certainly\\" . Like those of his family members, his name was recorded only in the missionaries' English romanizations,. which include . ,. and .. Over the next two centuries, this was variously modernized as ,. , \\"Ako\\", and \\"Ko\\". It has become generally accepted that these rendered the given names and . which would be . or Yagao in pinyin. Su and Ying, however, believe the original name to have been which would be in pinyin. Smith also gives the Cantonese form as Family Cai Gao's father was a Cantonese merchant at Macao whose legal wife had borne him no children; Gao's mother was his second concubine. He had an elder brother (born ) whose name variously appears as \\"Low H√´en\\", \\"Low-h√´en\\", . and . He had another brother or \\"Ayun\\",. who was \\"a child\\", younger than Low-h√´en and whom Morrison \\"wish[ed] to educate\\".. Though frequently taken as Gao's younger brother, appears as his \\"elder brother\\" in the Mission Society's 1819 report. Morrison's journals mention an who was distinct from and, as \\"a lad\\", distinct from his older tutor and companion Yong Sam-tak. McNeur, Gu, and Zetzsche do not mention A-yun as one of Gao's brothers but do say that \\"A-sam\\" was his younger brother.. The use of lou‚Åµ (, p l«éo, \\"old\\") and aa¬≥ (then , p y√† or y«é, but now , ƒÅ, \\"dear ~, dear little ~\\") reflects the standard practice of Cantonese nicknames. Morrison notes that these were generally used without \\"Tsae, being the sacred or family name\\". As the elder member of the family, \\"Low-h√´en\\" received the affectionate honorific \\"low-\\" and the others the diminutive \\"a-\\". While it is possible \\"Low-h√´en\\" and \\"A-h√´en\\" were different members of the family, they are not distinguished as such by Morrison. Life Cai Gao was born in 1788. He and his brothers were given a good Chinese education, although Gao's poor health caused him to fall behind his brother Low-h√´en. His calligraphy, however, was quite good. During his adolescence, his father's wealth was lost when his ship returning from Batavia (now Jakarta) in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) was wrecked in the South China Sea. The father died when Gao was sixteen. Upon the ruin of their family, their father's debts were so large that Gao's brother Low-h√´en was suddenly arrested and imprisoned over a decade later for the unpaid amount. In March 1808, Gao‚Äîthen 20‚Äîbegan working for Robert Morrison at his home in Guangzhou's Thirteen Factories trading ghetto. Morrison was the first Protestant missionary to the Qing Empire and a translator for the East India Company. With the assistance of his Chinese staff, he published the first Chinese-language periodical. and, with additional assistance from William Milne, wrote the first major Chinese‚ÄìEnglish, English‚ÄìChinese dictionary from 1815 to 1823.. Low-h√´en was already Morrison's tutor and companion, teaching him Cantonese and copying out Morrison's Chinese translation of the Bible. Gao was recommended by Yong Sam-tak, who had served as Morrison's comprador since February 1801, to be Morrison's printer, carving the wooden blocks necessary to publish the Chinese characters of his text. He also took charge of Morrison's shopping and provisioning. Morrison took note of him, saying \\"There is one boy, a fatherless lad, the brother of Low-heen. He possesses tolerable parts. I wish to pay attention to him.\\" Morrison asked his employees to attend Sunday worship services at his home. There were also daily meetings which began with Morrison praying, followed by a reading from his Chinese translation of the Bible and Morrison's commentary on it. They ended with hymns. These meetings were sometimes followed by personal counseling. At first Cai Gao was unable to understand Morrison's attempts to discuss Christianity, but he assisted Low-h√´en in printing Morrison's Chinese translation of the New Testament. After about five months, he began praying with Morrison in Chinese. Nonetheless, owing to his quarreling with Morrison's Mandarin tutor \\"Kwei- Une\\", the missionary fired them both in late September 1808. Morrison never brought him back into personal service, even after his conversion, but hired him two years later as the printer for his missionary periodical. In his survey of the development of Western-style printing in China, Reed calls Cai Gao \\"the first Chinese type-cutter and letterpress operator\\". Low-h√´en continued to work with Morrison and Cai Gao continued to join him for Morrison's meetings and Sunday services. (Low-h√´en was an ardent Confucianist, uninterested in Morrison's faith, but attended out of his sense of obligation to his employer.) By October 1812, Gao was reading Morrison's Bible before the group, expressing his own ideas about religion, and requesting Morrison's guidance on proper prayer. On October 30, he brought Morrison some idols, saying that he agreed with their uselessness. On November 8, he admitted that he desired baptism, but so secretly that his brothers wouldn't know. His bad temper and quarrelsome nature caused Morrison to deny his request. After a period of improved behavior and various testing, Cai Gao wrote out a statement of faith and Morrison relented. The confession follows the structure of a catechism, noting his own sins and \\"complete depravity\\", the need for salvation, Christ's ability to provide it and good works' inability, and his hope of resurrection. He was baptized by Robert Morrison on Macao on July 16, 1814, becoming the first Protestant convert in mainland China. Morrison's journal entry read, > \\"At a spring of water issuing from the foot of a lofty hill by the seaside > away from human observation, I baptized, in the Name of the Father, Son, and > Holy Spirit, the person whose name and character have been given above. Oh, > that the Lord may cleanse him from all sin by the blood of Jesus; and purify > his heart by the influences of the Holy Spirit! May he be the first-fruits > of a great harvest, one of millions who shall come and be saved.\\" Cai Gao continued to attend services faithfully, with Morrison noting that he attended every Sunday \\"so long as [he] is within a few miles\\". All the same, Morrison continued to complain that \\"he is not so docile as I could wish\\".. In January 1817, officers from Guangdong raided the East India Company's printing offices on Macao, prompting all Morrison's Chinese associates to flee. Gao and two others snuck onto a ship bound for British Malacca. Morrison paid the stow-aways' fare, giving $6 and two boxes of tea to their families in China. He further gave Gao an interest-free $200 loan to start a business to provide for his livelihood while abroad. After he arrived, he began writing books for the London Missionary Society's station. He was probably also responsible for the hand-cut Chinese type used by the station's printing press. With the station's printer Liang Fa, who had become the second baptized mainland Chinese in 1816, he attended William Milne's open Sunday services and private lessons each Tuesday evening at 8. Milne found both \\"sincere, tho very imperfect, Christians\\". Cai Gao returned to China after six months abroad. On 10 October 1818, Morrison wrote to the London Missionary Society to say that his convert was \\"suffering from a serious lung disease and I fear this illness is on the verge of ending his life\\". He died before the end of the month of pulmonary consumption. His brother Low-h√´en did not return to Morrison's employment after the raid but he unexpectedly wrote to Morrison in Macao in 1822 requesting baptism. No extant record records it, but they remained close and Low-h√´en continued to attend Morrison's gatherings and services until 1827. Another of Gao's brothers, A-yun, began working for the LMS missionary John Slater while in Malacca in 1818 but returned to China by November 1819, when officers hunted him and Morrison's other Chinese associates for their involvement with Liang Fa's attempted publication of a Christian tract for distribution in his native village. Morrison hid him in his locked bedroom until he could escape under cover of darkness. He then accompanied Morrison to Malacca in early 1823 to deal with the problems caused by Milne's death, after which his fate is unrecorded. Legacy A Protestant chapel in Macau bore his name.

A right-handed pitcher, he appeared in 66 games in Major League Baseball over four seasons between and for the Brooklyn and Los Angeles Dodgers and Philadelphia Phillies. The native of Akron, Ohio, was listed as tall and . He graduated from Garfield High School and attended Kent State University. Negray began his 15-year pro career in 1949 in the Brooklyn farm system, winning 21 games in the Class D Georgia‚ÄìFlorida League. His first taste of MLB service came at the tail end of the campaign, when the pennant-bound Dodgers recalled him from the Triple-A St. Paul Saints. Negray got into four games pitched, including one start, and allowed 15 hits and five earned runs in 13 full innings pitched. He then spent 2 more years with St. Paul, winning 17 games for the Saints in 1954. On June 7, 1955, he was recalled by the Dodgers and traded to the Phillies for fellow pitcher Dave Cole. Inserted into the Phils' starting rotation, Negray hurled seven shutout innings on June 19 against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field, surrendering only four hits and one base on balls before departing in the eighth inning. (The Phillies would go on to win 1‚Äì0 in 15 innings.)Retrosheet box score: 1955-06-19 Negray was less effective in his next start five days later, permitting 11 hits and five earned runs in seven innings against the Cincinnati Redlegs at Crosley Field, but the Phillies outscored Cincinnati 8‚Äì6 to deliver Negray's first big-league win.Retrosheet box score: 1955-06-24 In his third start on June 29, Negray notched his first complete game in MLB, defeating the Pittsburgh Pirates 6‚Äì3 at Connie Mack Stadium, giving up only two earned runs.Retrosheet box score: 1955-06-29 He threw his second and last complete game two months later, defeating the Redlegs at Connie Mack Stadium, 8‚Äì3.

He posted a 2‚Äì3 record and his earned run average rose from 3.52 to 4.19. During spring training in , he was traded back to the Dodgers in a six-player transaction that brought shortstop Humberto \\"Chico\\" Fern√°ndez to Philadelphia. The Dodgers, playing their final season in Brooklyn, sent Negray back to St. Paul for the remainder of 1957. Negray was destined to be a member of the first edition of the Los Angeles Dodgers, however. On March 8, 1958, he was the starting pitcher in the franchise's first spring training game as representatives of Los Angeles, a 7‚Äì4 loss to the Phillies at Miami Stadium. Then, after making the Dodgers' 28-man early-season roster, he appeared in the first regular National League game in Los Angeles Dodger history on April 15 at Seals Stadium, as the Dodgers fell to the San Francisco Giants, 8‚Äì0.Retrosheet box score: 1958-04-15 In that game, he allowed one earned run in two innings of mop-up relief.

He wrote two volumes of autobiography which recount his early life growing up in Belfast, his early career as a mariner and his political development, as well as his close involvement with Aldred and the United Socialist Movement. A career agitator Caldwell joined Aldred's United Socialist Movement (USM) shortly after its inception in 1934, eventually becoming secretary. He was closely involved in the group's agitational work in support of anarchism in Spain before becoming - along with Jenny Patrick and Ethel MacDonald - a full- time \\"family\\" member of Aldred's Strickland Press when it was set up in 1939. Like Aldred, Caldwell was a conscientious objector and resisted conscription during World War II. For many years, Caldwell shared with Ethel MacDonald a third-floor flat in Gibson Street, Hillhead, Glasgow. He acted as election agent for Aldred on four occasions. Last of the quartet Following Guy Aldred's death in 1963, Caldwell continued the work of both the USM and Strickland Press before finally closing the doors of their radical bookshop (somewhat coincidentally) in May 1968. As Aldred's literary executor, he collated a microfilm archive of Aldred's journals and pamphlets as well as his unfinished autobiography, No Traitor's Gait and the manuscript of Caldwell's own, unfinished, three-volume biography, The Red Evangel. The latter was subsequently published, in an abridged form, as Come Dungeons Dark: The Life and Times of Guy Aldred, Glasgow Anarchist. In 1966, to celebrate what would have been Aldred's 80th year, Caldwell produced a small collection of quotations, In Memoriam: Quotations from the writings of Guy A.

(External flows are movements of value such as transfers of cash, securities or other instruments in or out of the portfolio, with no equal simultaneous movement of value in the opposite direction, and which are not income from the investments in the portfolio, such as interest, coupons or dividends.) To calculate the modified Dietz return, divide the gain or loss in value, net of external flows, by the average capital over the period of measurement. The average capital weights individual cash flows by the length of time between those cash flows until the end of the period. Flows which occur towards the beginning of the period have a higher weight than flows occurring towards the end. The result of the calculation is expressed as a percentage return over the holding period. GIPS This method for return calculation is used in modern portfolio management. It is one of the methodologies of calculating returns recommended by the Investment Performance Council (IPC) as part of their Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS). The GIPS are intended to provide consistency to the way portfolio returns are calculated internationally. Origin The method is named after Peter O. Dietz. The original idea behind the work of Peter Dietz was to find a quicker, less computer-intensive way of calculating an IRR as the iterative approach using the then quite slow computers that were available was taking a significant amount of time; the research was produced for BAI, Bank Administration institute. Dietz or Modified Dietz being MWRR (money weighted rates of return) methodologiesPaolo Antonio Cucurachi, Ph.D. & Ugo Pomante, Ph.D. \\"A Modification of the Modified Dietz Approach\\", The Journal of Performance Measurement, Summer 2013, his approximation was therefore to generate a money weighted rate of return for the period (IRR is also a MWRR). Because there is a GIPS requirement to produce a valuation on a monthly basis at least, using modified Dietz with monthly valuations provides a series of individual monthly money-weighted rates with which can be compounded together to produce a good quality approximation for the longer time period time weighted rate of return. Formula The formula for the modified Dietz method is as follows: :\\\\cfrac{\\\\text {gain or loss}}{\\\\text {average capital}}= \\\\cfrac{ B - A - F}{ A + \\\\sum_{i=1}^n W_i \\\\times F_i} where :A is the starting market value :B is the ending market value :F = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n F_i is the net external inflow for the period (so contributions to a portfolio are treated as positive flows while withdrawals are negative flows) and :\\\\sum_{i=1}^n W_i \\\\times {F_i} = the sum of each flow F_i multiplied by its weight W_i The weight W_i is the proportion of the time period between the point in time when the flow F_i occurs and the end of the period. Assuming that the flow happens at the end of the day, W_i can be calculated as : W_i = \\\\frac{C-D_i}{C} where :C is the number of calendar days during the return period being calculated, which equals end date minus start date (plus 1, unless you adopt the convention that the start date is the same as the end date of the previous period) :D_i is the number of days from the start of the return period until the day on which the flow F_i occurred. This assumes that the flow happens at the end of the day. If the flow happens at the beginning of the day, the flow is in the portfolio for an additional day, so use the following formula for calculating the weight: : W_i = \\\\frac{C -D_i + 1}{C} Comparison with time-weighted return and internal rate of return The modified Dietz method has the practical advantage over the true time-weighted rate of return method, in that the calculation of a modified Dietz return does not require portfolio valuations at each point in time whenever an external flow occurs. The internal rate of return method shares this practical advantage with the modified Dietz method. With the advance of technology, most systems can calculate a true time-weighted return by calculating a daily return and geometrically linking in order to get a monthly, quarterly, annual or any other period return. However, the modified Dietz method remains useful for performance attribution, because it still has the advantage of allowing modified Dietz returns on assets to be combined with weights in a portfolio, calculated according to average invested capital, and the weighted average gives the modified Dietz return on the portfolio. Time weighted returns do not allow this. The modified Dietz method also has the practical advantage over internal rate of return (IRR) method that it does not require repeated trial and error to get a result. The modified Dietz method is based upon a simple rate of interest principle. It approximates the internal rate of return method, which applies a compounding principle, but if the flows and rates of return are large enough, the results of the Modified Dietz method will significantly diverge from the internal rate of return. The modified Dietz return is the solution R to the equation: :B = A \\\\times (1+R)+ \\\\sum_{i=1}^n F_i \\\\times \\\\left( 1+R \\\\times \\\\frac{T - t_i}{T} \\\\right) where :A is the start value :B is the end value :T is the total length of time period and :t_i is the time between the start of the period and flow i Compare this with the (unannualized) internal rate of return (IRR). The IRR (or more strictly speaking, an un-annualized holding period return version of the IRR) is a solution R to the equation: :B = A \\\\times (1+R)+ \\\\sum_{i=1}^n F_i \\\\times (1+R)^ \\\\frac{T - t_i}{T} Example Suppose the value of a portfolio is $100 at the beginning of the first year, and $300 at the end of the second year, and there is an inflow of $50 at the end of the first year/beginning of the second year. (Suppose further that neither year is a leap year, so the two years are of equal length.) To calculate the gain or loss over the two-year period, :\\\\text {gain or loss} = B - A - F = 300 - 100 - 50 = $150\\\\text{.} To calculate the average capital over the two-year period, :\\\\text {average capital} = A + \\\\sum \\\\text {weight} \\\\times \\\\text {flow} = 100 + 0.5 \\\\times 50 = $125\\\\text{,} so the modified Dietz return is: :\\\\frac {\\\\text {gain or loss}}{\\\\text {average capital}} = \\\\frac {150}{125} = 120\\\\% The (unannualized) internal rate of return in this example is 125%: :100 \\\\times (1 + 125\\\\%)+ 50 \\\\times (1+125\\\\%)^ \\\\frac{2 - 1}{2} = 225 + 50 \\\\times 150\\\\% = 225 + 75 = 300 so in this case, the modified Dietz return is noticeably less than the unannualized IRR. This divergence between the modified Dietz return and the unannualized internal rate of return is due to a significant flow within the period, and the fact that the returns are large. The simple Dietz method The modified Dietz method is different from the simple Dietz method, in which the cash flows are weighted equally regardless of when they occurred during the measurement period. The simple Dietz method is a special case of the Modified Dietz method, in which external flows are assumed to occur at the midpoint of the period, or equivalently, spread evenly throughout the period, whereas no such assumption is made when using the Modified Dietz method, and the timing of any external flows is taken into account. Note that in the example above, the flow occurs midway through the overall period, which matches the assumption underlying the simple Dietz method. This means the simple Dietz return and modified Dietz return are the same in this particular example. Adjustments If either the start or the end value is zero, or both, the start and/or end dates need to be adjusted to cover the period over which the portfolio has content. Example Suppose we are calculating the 2016 calendar year return, and that the portfolio is empty until a transfer in of EUR 1m cash in a non-interest bearing account on Friday 30 December. By the end of the day on Saturday 31 December 2016, the exchange rate between euros and Hong Kong dollars has changed from 8.1 HKD per EUR to 8.181, which is a 1 percent increase in value, measured in Hong Kong dollar terms, so the right answer to the question of what is the return in Hong Kong dollars is intuitively 1 percent. However, blindly applying the modified Dietz formula, using an end-of-day transaction timing assumption, the day-weighting on the inflow of 8.1m HKD on 30 December, one day before the end of the year, is 1/366, and the average capital is calculated as: : + inflow √ó = 0 + 8.1m √ó 1/366 = 22,131.15 and the gain is: : - - = 8,181,000 - 0 - 8,100,000 = 81,000 so the modified Dietz return is calculated as: : = = 366 % So which is the correct return, 1 percent or 366 percent? Adjusted time interval The only sensible answer to the example above is that the holding period return is unambiguously 1 percent. This means the start date should be adjusted to the date of the initial external flow. Likewise, if the portfolio is empty at the end of the period, the end date should be adjusted to the final external flow. The end value is effectively the final external flow, not zero. The return annualized using a simple method of multiplying-up 1 percent per day by the number of days in the year will give the answer 366 percent, but the holding period return is still 1 percent. Example corrected The example above is corrected if the start date is adjusted to the end of the day on 30 December, and the start value is now 8.1m HKD. There are no external flows thereafter. The corrected gain or loss is the same as before: : - = 8,181,000 - 8,100,000 = 81,000 but the corrected average capital is now: : + = 8.1m so the corrected modified Dietz return is now: : = = 1 % Second example Suppose that a bond is bought for HKD 1,128,728 including accrued interest and commission on trade date 14 November, and sold again three days later on trade date 17 November for HKD 1,125,990 (again, net of accrued interest and commission). Assuming transactions take place at the start of the day, what is the modified Dietz holding-period return in HKD for this bond holding over the year to-date until the end-of-day on 17 November? Answer The answer is that firstly, the reference to the holding period year to-date until the end-of-day on 17 November includes both the purchase and the sale. This means the effective adjusted holding period is actually from the purchase at the start of the day on 14 November until it is sold three days later on 17 November. The adjusted start value is the net amount of the purchase, the end value is the net amount of the sale, and there are no other external flows. : = 1,128,728 : = 1,125,990 There are no flows, so the gain or loss is: : - = 1,125,990 - 1,128,728 = -2,738 and the average capital equals the start value, so the modified Dietz return is: : = = -0.24 % 2 d.p. Contributions - when not to adjust the holding period This method of restricting the calculation to the actual holding period by applying an adjusted start or end date applies when the return is calculated on an investment in isolation. When the investment belongs inside a portfolio, and the weight of the investment in the portfolio, and the contribution of that return to that of the portfolio as a whole is required, it is necessary to compare like with like, in terms of a common holding period. Example Suppose that at the beginning of the year, a portfolio contains cash, of value $10,000, in an account which bears interest without any charges. At the beginning of the fourth quarter, $8,000 of that cash is invested in some US dollar shares (in company X). The investor applies a buy-and-hold strategy, and there are no further transactions for the remainder of the year. At the end of the year, the shares have increased in value by 10% to $8,800, and $100 interest is capitalized into the cash account. What is the return on the portfolio over the year? What are the contributions from the cash account and the shares? Furthermore, what is the return on the cash account? =Answer= The end value of the portfolio is $2,100 in cash, plus shares worth $8,800, which is in total $10,900. There has been a 9 percent increase in value since the beginning of the year. There are no external flows in or out of the portfolio over the year. : = 0 so : = = $10,000 so the return is: : = = 9 % This 9% portfolio return breaks down between 8 percent contribution from the $800 earned on the shares and 1 percent contribution from the $100 interest earned on the cash account, but how more generally can we calculate contributions? The first step is to calculate the average capital in each of the cash account and the shares over the full year period. These should sum to the $10,000 average capital of the portfolio as a whole. From the average capital of each of the two components of the portfolio, we can calculate weights. The weight of the cash account is the average capital of the cash account, divided by the average capital ($10,000) of the portfolio, and the weight of the shares is the average capital of the shares over the whole year, divided by the average capital of the portfolio. For convenience, we will assume the time weight of the outflow of $8,000 cash to pay for the shares is exactly 1/4. This means that the four quarters of the year are treated as having equal length. The average capital of the cash account is: : ::= - √ó ::= 10,000 - √ó $8,000 ::= 10,000 - $2,000 ::= $8,000 The average capital of the shares over the last quarter requires no calculation, because there are no flows after the beginning of the last quarter. It is the $8,000 invested in the shares. However, the average capital in the shares over the whole year is something else. The start value of the shares at the beginning of the year was zero, and there was an inflow of $8,000 at the beginning of the last quarter, so: : ::= - √ó ::= 0 + √ó $8,000 ::= $2,000 We can see immediately that the weight of the cash account in the portfolio over the year was: : ::= ::= 80 % and the weight of the shares was: : ::= ::= 20 % which sum to 100 percent. We can calculate the return on the cash account, which was: : = = 1.25 % The contribution to the portfolio return is: : √ó return = 80 % √ó 1.25 % = 1 % How about the contribution to the portfolio return from the shares? The adjusted holding period return on the shares is 10 percent. If we multiply this by the 20 percent weight of the shares in the portfolio, the result is only 2 percent, but the correct contribution is 8 percent. The answer is to use the return on the shares over the unadjusted full-year period to calculate the contribution: : ::= ::= ::= 40 % Then the contribution from the shares to the portfolio return is: : √ó ::= 20% √ó 40 % = 8 % This does not mean that the correct holding period return on the shares is 40 percent, but for calculation of the contribution, use the unadjusted period return, which is the 40 percent figure, not the actual 10 percent holding period return. Fees To measure returns net of fees, allow the value of the portfolio to be reduced by the amount of the fees. To calculate returns gross of fees, compensate for them by treating them as an external flow, and exclude accrued fees from valuations. Annual rate of return Note that the Modified Dietz return is a holding-period return, not an annual rate of return, unless the period happens to be one year. Annualisation, which is conversion of the holding-period return to an annual rate of return, is a separate process. Money-weighted return The modified Dietz method is an example of a money (or dollar) weighted methodology. In particular, if the modified Dietz return on two portfolios are R_1 and R_2, measured over a common matching time interval, then the modified Dietz return on the two portfolios put together over the same time interval is the weighted average of the two returns: :W_1 \\\\times R_1+W_2 \\\\times R_2 where the weights of the portfolios depend on the average capital over the time interval: :W_i = \\\\frac{\\\\text{average capital}_i}{\\\\text{average capital}_1+\\\\text{average capital}_2} Linked return versus true time-weighted return An alternative to the modified Dietz method is to link geometrically the modified Dietz returns for shorter periods. The linked modified Dietz method is classed as a time-weighted method, but it does not produce the same results as the true time weighted method, which requires valuations at the time of each cash flow. Issues Problems with timing assumptions There are sometimes difficulties when calculating or decomposing portfolio returns, if all transactions are treated as occurring at a single time of day, such as the end of the day or beginning of the day. Whatever method is applied to calculate returns, an assumption that all transactions take place simultaneously at a single point in time each day can lead to errors. For example, consider a scenario where a portfolio is empty at the start of a day, so that the start value A is zero. There is then an external inflow during that day of F = $100. By the close of the day, market prices have moved, and the end value is $99. If all transactions are treated as occurring at the end of the day, then there is zero start value A, and zero value for average capital, because the day- weight on the inflow is zero, so no modified Dietz return can be calculated. Some such problems are resolved if the modified Dietz method is further adjusted so as to put purchases at the open and sales at the close, but more sophisticated exception-handling produces better results. There are sometimes other difficulties when decomposing portfolio returns, if all transactions are treated as occurring at a single point during the day. For example, consider a fund opening with just $100 of a single stock that is sold for $110 during the day. During the same day, another stock is purchased for $110, closing with a value of $120. The returns on each stock are 10% and 120/110 - 1 = 9.0909% (4 d.p.) and the portfolio return is 20%. The asset weights wi (as opposed to the time weights Wi) required to get the returns for these two assets to roll up to the portfolio return are 1200% for the first stock and a negative 1100% for the second: :w*10/100 + (1-w)*10/110 = 20/100 ‚Üí w = 12. Such weights are absurd, because the second stock is not held short. The problem only arises because the day is treated as a single, discrete time interval. Negative or zero average capital In normal circumstances, average capital is positive. When an intra-period outflow is large and early enough, average capital can be negative or zero. Negative average capital causes the Modified Dietz return to be negative when there is a profit, and positive when there is a loss. This resembles the behaviour of a liability or short position, even if the investment is not actually a liability or a short position. In cases where the average capital is zero, no Modified Dietz return can be calculated. If the average capital is close to zero, the Modified Dietz return will be large (large and positive, or large and negative). One partial workaround solution involves as a first step, to capture the exception, detecting for example when the start value (or first inflow) is positive, and the average capital is negative. Then in this case, use the simple return method, adjusting the end value for outflows. This is equivalent to the sum of constituent contributions, where the contributions are based on simple returns and weights depending on start values. Example For example, in a scenario where only part of the holdings are sold, for significantly more than the total starting value, relatively early in the period: :At the start of Day 1, the number of shares is 100 :At the start of Day 1, the share price is 10 dollars :Start value = 1,000 dollars :At the end of Day 5, 80 shares are sold at 15 dollars per share :At the end of Day 40, the remaining 20 shares are worth 12.50 dollars per share The gain or loss is end value - start value + outflow: :20 \\\\times 12.50 - 100 \\\\times 10 + 80 \\\\times 15 ::= 250 - 1,000 + 1,200 ::= 450 There is a gain, and the position is long, so we would intuitively expect a positive return. The average capital in this case is: :\\\\text {start value} - \\\\text {time weight} \\\\times \\\\text {outflow on Day 5} ::= 100 \\\\times 10 - \\\\frac {40 - 5}{40} \\\\times 80 \\\\times 15 ::= 1,000 - \\\\frac {7}{8} \\\\times 1,200 ::= 1,000 - 1,050 ::= -50 \\\\text { dollars} The modified Dietz return in this case goes awry, because the average capital is negative, even though this is a long position. The Modified Dietz return in this case is: :\\\\frac {\\\\text {gain or loss}}{\\\\text {average capital}} = \\\\frac {450}{-50} = -900 \\\\% Instead, we notice that the start value is positive, but the average capital is negative. Furthermore, there is no short sale. In other words, at all times, the number of shares held is positive. We then measure the simple return from the shares sold: :\\\\frac {15 - 10}{10} = 50 \\\\% and from the shares still held at the end: :\\\\frac {12.50 - 10}{10} = 25 \\\\% and combine these returns with the weights of these two portions of the shares within the starting position, which are: :\\\\frac {80}{100} = 80 \\\\% and \\\\frac {20}{100} = 20 \\\\% respectively. This gives the contributions to the overall return, which are: :50 \\\\% \\\\times 80 \\\\% = 40 \\\\% and 25 \\\\% \\\\times 20 \\\\% = 5 \\\\% respectively. The sum of these contributions is the return: :40 \\\\% + 5 \\\\% = 45 \\\\% This is equivalent to the simple return, adjusting the end value for outflows: :\\\\text {Start value} = 1,000 \\\\text { dollars} :\\\\text {Adjusted end value} = \\\\text {end value} + \\\\text {outflow} ::= 20 \\\\times 12.50 + 80 \\\\times 15 ::= 250 + 1,200 ::= 1,450 :\\\\text {Simple return} = \\\\frac {\\\\text {adjusted end value} - \\\\text {start value}}{\\\\text {start value}} ::= \\\\frac {1,450 - 1,000}{1,000} :::= 45 \\\\% Limitations This workaround has limitations. It is possible only if the holdings can be split up like this. It is not ideal, for two further reasons, which are that it does not cover all cases, and it is inconsistent with the Modified Dietz method. Combined with Modified Dietz contributions for other assets, the sum of constituent contributions will fail to add up to the overall return. Another situation in which average capital can be negative is short selling. Instead of investing by buying shares, shares are borrowed and then sold. A decline in the share price results in a profit instead of a loss. The position is a liability instead of an asset. If the profit is positive, and the average capital is negative, the Modified Dietz return is negative, indicating that although the number of shares is unchanged, the absolute value of the liability has shrunk. In the case of a purchase, followed by a sale of more shares than had been bought, resulting in a short position (a negative number of shares), the average capital can also be negative. What was an asset at the time of the purchase became a liability after the sale. The interpretation of the Modified Dietz return varies from one situation to another.

Pete Panto) (Sept 13, 1910 - July 14, 1939) was an Italian American longshoreman and union activist who was murdered by the mob for attempting to revolt against union leadership. Panto was born in Brooklyn and at an unknown date he left the United States, returning on June 3, 1924 on the S.S. President Wilson that sailed out of Naples. He left the United States again, returning on March 22, 1934 on the S.S. Sinaia that sailed out of Palermo. Both ship registries list 198 Sackett Street in Brooklyn as his address. Revolt Pietro \\"Pete\\" Panto was the leader of a revolt against Joseph P. Ryan and his colleagues, many of them allegedly mafia, who ran the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA). Corruption was rampant among ILA leaders and working conditions were deplorable. Panto attempted to expose this corruption via the Brooklyn Rank-and-File Committee, a group of \\"left wing\\" dockworkers. He and the Rank-And-File Committee held open air assemblies attracting over 1500 longshoreman at a time. This was a serious threat to Ryan, Anastasia, and other corrupt officials. Panto was lured from his home on July 14, 1939, following a phone call from an unknown individual and was never seen again. His body was later found during January 1941, in a lime pit in Lyndhurst, New Jersey. Albert Anastasia was suspected of ordering the execution but Abe Reles, the chief witness, died in 1941 while supposedly trying to escape from custody. He either \\"jumped or fell\\" from a room where he was held under guard by six police officers. Panto's murder was allegedly carried out by Mendy Weiss, Tony Romanello and James Feraco of Murder, Inc. Although Anastasia, Weiss, Romanello and Ferraco were never indicted, Weiss would receive the electric chair in 1944 for a separate murder, whereas Anastasia was murdered by rival mobsters in 1957. Romanello was arrested and questioned in 1942. A few months after his release from custody his dead body was found along the banks of the Brandywine Creek near Wilmington, Delaware. James Ferraco had vanished without a trace and was most likely killed in 1940 or 1941. Ryan resigned in 1953, following New York State Industrial Commissioner Edward Corsi and Governor Thomas E. Dewey's investigation into corruption charges.FrontPage Magazine. February 11, 2005.

Scope of the law Premises liability may range from things from \\"injuries caused by a variety of hazardous conditions, including open excavations, uneven pavement, standing water, crumbling curbs, wet floors, uncleared snow, icy walks, falling objects, inadequate security, insufficient lighting, concealed holes, improperly secured mats, or defects in chairs or benches\\". As \\"ExpertLaw\\" puts it: \\"Premises liability law is the body of law which makes the person who is in possession of land or premises responsible for certain injuries suffered by persons who are present on the premises\\". For premises liability to apply: # The defendant must possess the land or \\"premises\\". # The plaintiff must be an invitee or, in certain cases, a licensee. Traditionally, trespassers were not protected under premises liability law. However, in 1968, the California Supreme Court issued a vastly influential opinion, Rowland v. Christian, 69 Cal.2d 108 (1968), which abolished the significance of legal distinctions such as invitee, licensee, or trespasser in determining whether one could hold the possessor of a premises liable for harm. This opinion led to changes in the law in many other states in the United States, and is viewed as a seminal opinion in the development of the law of premises liability. # There must be negligence‚Äîa breach of the duty of care‚Äîor some other wrongful act. In recent years, the law of premises liability has evolved to include cases where a person is injured on the premises of another by a third person's wrongful act, such as an assault. These cases are sometimes referred to as \\"third party premises liability\\" cases and they represent a highly complex and dynamic area of tort law. They pose especially complex legal issues of duty and causation because the injured party is seeking to hold a possessor or owner of property directly or vicariously liable when the immediate injury-producing act was, arguably, not caused by the possessor or owner. Common law of premises liability A notice informing potential entrants of limits to the duty of care At common law, in the case of landowners, the extent of their duty of care to those who came on their premises varied depending on whether a person was classified as a trespasser, licensee, or invitee. This rule was eventually abolished in some common law jurisdictions. For example, England enacted the Occupiers Liability Act 1957. Similarly, in the 1968 landmark case of Rowland v. Christian,Rowland v. Christian, 69 Cal. 2d 108 (1968). the Supreme Court of California replaced the old classifications with a general duty of care to all persons on one's land, regardless of their status. After several highly publicized and controversial cases, the California Legislature enacted a statute in 1985 that partially restored immunity to landowners from some types of lawsuits from trespassers.Calvillo-Silva v. Home Grocery, 19 Cal. 4th 714 (1998). Colorado's highest court adopted the Rowland unified duty of care analysis in 1971. The resulting explosion of lawsuits against Colorado landowners caused the state legislature to enact the Colorado Premises Liability Act in 1986, which enacted a cleaned-up statutory version of the common law classifications and simultaneously expressly displaced all common law remedies against landowners in order to prevent state courts from again expanding their liability. In the Republic of Ireland, under the Occupiers' Liability Act, 1995, the duty of care to trespassers, visitors and \\"recreational users\\" can be restricted by the occupier; provided reasonable notice is given, for which a prominent notice at the usual entrance to the premises usually suffices. Premises liability case law of the United States In United States law, premises liability law is highly developed and can differ from state to state. This section includes some examples of state case law. Florida In Lai Chau v. Southstar Equity Limited Co. and Brookside Properties Inc., a former University of South Florida student, survived a violent abduction in her North Tampa apartment complex in 2001. Two men sneaked past the complex's security gate, and shot the 20-year-old student three times in the head. The landmark negligent security case won Chau $15.7 million in damages in 2004. New York In Morales v. Lia, a pedestrian who was hit by a car in the parking lot of a strip mall was unable to get payment for his injuries from the mall owner because the driver and owner of the vehicle were determined to be 100% liable for plaintiff's injuries. In Peralta v. Henriquez, New York's highest court, the New York Court of Appeals, held that a landowner has a duty to provide lighting, when \\"defendants created the dangerous condition that led to the accident, [and] notice was not at issue ....\\"; in this case, it was lack of illumination that caused plaintiff's injuries when she walked into a bent car antenna in the darkened parking lot of defendant's premises. Both the intermediate court, the Appellate Division, and the N.Y. Court of Appeals cited prior precedent, that when \\"the general public is invited into stores, office buildings and other places of public assembly, the owner is charged with the duty of providing the public with a reasonably safe premises, including a safe means of ingress and egress.\\" Peralta has been cited itself as precedent in at least one other department's decision. Peralta was distinguished in those instances where the landlord had no notice of a dangerous situation, e.g. a tenant's prior criminal propensity to commit arson.

He was sired by top stallion Broad Brush, who in turn was a son of Ack Ack. His dam was Fara's Team. Foaled in Maryland, Concern was best known for his wins in the 1994 Breeders' Cup Classic and the grade two Arkansas Derby. Born at owner Robert Meyerhoff's Fitzhugh Farm in Phoenix, Maryland. To date, Concern is one of only three Maryland-bred horses ever to surpass the three million dollar mark in earnings. The other two were Cigar and Awad. He finished racing with a record of 7-7-11 in 30 starts and career earnings of $3,079,350.Pedigree Online, Thoroughbred Database;  Two-year-old season  At age two, Concern developed late in the year. He raced a total of four times winning both a maiden special weight race in his second attempt and an allowance race. He placed third in the $60,000 Rollicking Stakes for 2-year-old Maryland-breds at Laurel Park Racecourse.  Three-year-old season  Concern established himself as one of his crop's top three-year-olds by winning two big races and finishing in the money in each of his twelve starts as a sophomore. He started the season with three stakes placings in the spring at Oaklawn Park in Arkansas. In each successive stakes, he improved, beginning with a third-place finish in the Great West Stakes. He followed that up with a runner-up finish under jockey Francine Villeneuvehttp://www.drf.com/news/fort- erie-villeneuve-enters-next-stage-trainer in the grade three Rebel Stakes to Judge T. C. In April, Concern scored the second biggest win of his career under Garrett Gomez in the $500,000 grade two Arkansas Derby. He ran the 1-1/8 mile distance in 1:48.1 in a field of nine, defeating Blumin Affair and Silver Goblin. His connections then made the decision to bypass the Kentucky Derby in favor of being fresh for the hometown $750,000 grade one Preakness Stakes at Pimlico Race Course. In the second leg of the Triple Crown, Concern was taken way back early trailing 15 lengths down the backstretch. Then he unleashed his late rush and made up about a dozen lengths, finishing third behind Tabasco Cat and Derby winner Go for Gin in the \\"Run for the Black-Eyed Susans.\\" After his Preakness placing, Concern wheeled back in three weeks to place third in the grade three Round Table Stakes at Arlington Park. Two weeks later, he raced in the $300,000 grade two Ohio Derby and finished second in the field of nine to Exclusive Praline. He then finished third in the $500,000 Haskell Invitational to Holy Bull. Later that summer, he attempted to run down Holy Bull again in the $750,000 grade one Travers Stakes at Saratoga Race Course. He finished second by a neck but defeated Dual Classic winner Tabasco Cat. In the autumn of 1994, he shipped to Canada to race in the nine furlong grade two Molson Export Million Stakes placing third to Dramatic Gold. Two weeks later, he lost narrowly to Soul of the Matter in the $750,000 grade one Super Derby. Concern achieved his greatest success using his come-from-behind running style in moving from last to first, again beating Tabasco Cat and Dramatic Gold in the 1994 Breeders' Cup Classic.  Four-year-old season  At age four, Concern won the $200,000 grade two New Orleans Handicap in March at Fair Grounds Race Course. Mike Smith piloted him to the win over Fly Cry and Tossofthecoin. In the summer of 1995, he won the $275,000 grade one Californian Stakes at Hollywood Park. In that race he beat Tossofthecoin again and Tinners Way under jockey Smith and Best Pal. He also placed third in three different grade one races in his four-year-old season. Those races included the Pimlico Special Handicap to Cigar, the Oaklawn Handicap to Cigar and the Meadowlands Cup to Peaks and Valleys. After finishing eighth to Cigar in the muddy Breeder's Cup Classic at Belmont Park, Concern returned to the Fair Grounds Race Course, where he began the year with a win in the New Orleans Handicap, to win in an Allowance Race on November 24, 1995, two days after Thanksgiving, his career finale.  Retirement  A descendant of the great sire Nearco, Concern was retired to stud in 1996 at Northview Stallion Station in Chesapeake City, Maryland until 2003. He then moved to the Oklahoma Equine Reproductive Center in Washington, Oklahoma, where he stood from 2004 until being pensioned in 2011. While Concern has sired a number of winners, his offspring have had some success in graded stakes races but never to the level that their sire accomplished. The best of his progeny has actually been Good Night Shirt, a steeplechase runner who was voted the 2007 and 2008 Eclipse Award as American Champion Steeplechase Horse and was elected to the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 2017. A press release on March 26, 2015 announced Concern's death at the age of 24. He was buried at Oklahoma Equine.

It was produced by Universal Television and was the second time programming of this nature had been attempted. The first TV miniseries, QB VII, had aired ‚Äî also on ABC ‚Äî in 1974. These projects proved to be a critical and ratings success and were the forerunner for similar projects based on literary works, such as Roots and Sh≈çgun. The film stars Peter Strauss, Nick Nolte and Susan Blakely. It spawned the sequel Rich Man, Poor Man Book II, which aired from September 1976 through March 1977. The network repeated the original series Tuesday nights at 9:00pm from May to June 1977. Overview Based on the best-selling 1969 novel by Irwin Shaw, it spanned the period from 1945 through the late 1960s and followed the divergent career courses of the impoverished German American Jordache brothers. Rudy (Peter Strauss) was the titular rich man, a well-educated and very ambitious entrepreneur who triumphed over his background and constructed a corporate and political empire. Poor man Tom (Nick Nolte) was a rebel who eventually turned to boxing to support himself. Axel and Mary were their parents, and Julie Prescott was Rudy's lifelong sweetheart who eventually married him. Later, another important character appears, the dangerous and eccentric Falconetti, lifelong nemesis of the Jordache Brothers, who is intent on killing them. While the first series spans a twenty-year period between 1945 and 1965, the second series begins in 1968. The series became a huge success in the countries that aired it.

A multi- instrumentalist, he is known for his work in the psychedelic, avant-garde rock field (primarily as a guitarist). Torabi was one of the founding members of The Monsoon Bassoon (as singer, guitarist and one of the two primary composers) and subsequently joined the cult psychedelic rock group Cardiacs as second guitarist. He currently fronts his own group Knifeworld and also plays guitar and composes for Guapo and for the legendary psychedelic band Gong, is a touring and recording musician for the Medi√¶val B√¶bes and for Rob Crow and frequently collaborates with notable artists working in left-field music. Musical style Torabi is reluctant to be pegged as a particular stylist, and his music has always drawn on a wide variety of influences. These have included indie and alternative rock (Pixies, Shudder to Think, XTC), British and American art/progressive rock (Cardiacs, Henry Cow, Yes, Hatfield and the North, Don Caballero), folk music, minimalist music, various forms of hard rock and heavy metal (Voivod, Melvins) and many others. His compositions are often typically dense, polyrhythmic and based in the lydian mode. History and main musical projects Torabi was born in Iran to an Iranian father and an English mother. His family moved to Plymouth, UK, when he was eighteen months old, originally planning to return once his father had made sufficient money, but ended up settling permanently following the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran. \\"Most\\" of Torabi's relatives remain in Iran, but he himself has never returned. Torabi remembers that his family were not particularly musical (although his mother knew a few guitar chords) but that he himself was interested in music from an early age (in particular the music from TV shows). Torabi taught himself music by inventing his own form of notation and using it to score out the theme from CHIPS. When he was seven, his family bought a piano and he used it as a compositional tool ‚Äì already writing songs of his own, he showed little interest in learning those of others. From 1980, he became interested in pop music (initially becoming inspired by Brian Setzer and the Stray Cats) and began teaching himself how to play guitar. Eight years later, aged sixteen, he discovered his main musical touchstone in the form of Cardiacs, although in the interim he had taught himself more about music by sequential obsessions with various other bands and music forms. One of Torabi's most cherished memories is of being given a satchel by BBC broadcaster and newsreader Fiona Bruce. Die Laughing (1988‚Äì1993) Torabi's first significant band was Die Laughing, formed in 1988.Metal Archives ‚Äì Die Laughing This was a psychedelic/thrash metal group formed in Torabi's native Plymouth in which he played guitar and in which he first met his close friend and collaborator, Dan Chudley. (Chudley ‚Äì a fellow guitarist and singer ‚Äì has been part of Torabi's life for most of his musical career, and the two are noted for their interlocking, highly complex guitar style.) Die Laughing released three demos before they eventually split in 1993. The Monsoon Bassoon (1994‚Äì2001) In 1994, Torabi reunited with Chudley, who had been playing in a band called Squid Squad since the previous year. The two formed a new band called The Monsoon Bassoon, in which they were joined by bass player Laurie Osbourne and two more Squid Squad members (singing clarinet/flute/sax player Sarah Measures and drummer Jamie Keddie). Their musical ‚Äì an energetic and tuneful form of psychedelic math rock ‚Äì was built around Torabi and Chudley's singular compositions. The group soon relocated from Plymouth to Leyton, East London and began to gain underground attention, releasing recordings on their own Weird Neighbourhood Records label. Despite scoring several Single of the Week awards in New Musical Express, the Monsoon Bassoon failed to get signed to a larger label or make a significant commercial breakthrough, although they did receive critical acclaim and a cult following for their unorthodox approach and sound. The band released a lone, well-regarded studio album (I Dig Your Voodoo) and five singles, and split up in 2001 following the exit of Keddie. Many of the band's recordings remain unreleased. Cardiacs (2003‚Äìpresent) Since the mid-1990s Torabi has had a close working relationship with Tim Smith (lead singer and songwriter for Cardiacs), who produced the majority of The Monsoon Bassoon's recordings. Having been Cardiacs' guitar technician since around 1995, Torabi finally joined the band as second guitarist in 2003 (replacing Jon Poole). His first appearance with Cardiacs was at their now legendary three-date Garage concerts (at which they played only archive material from their first two cassette releases). He was not publicly revealed as a full member until the next round of concerts. He featured on their 2007 single, Ditzy Scene (for which he also wrote the lyrics) and contributed to recordings for a subsequent album tentatively titled LSD (which remains unreleased). Despite Cardiacs' hiatus since 2008 (due to Tim Smith's long-term hospitalisation), Torabi remains a full member of the band. Knifeworld (circa 2002‚Äìpresent) Knifeworld is Torabi's current main band. Originally a solo project, it has since become a full band . Knifeworld originated from around the time of the Monsoon Bassoon's breakup, but only released its first material eight years later following a long recording period. Knifeworld is currently Torabi's main compositional vehicle, in many ways continuing ideas and approaches to polyrhythmic songwriting and arrangements that were germinated in The Monsoon Bassoon.  Guapo Torabi joined the instrumental avant- psychedelic/progressive rock band Guapo as permanent guitarist in 2006. He has toured extensively with the band, and co-wrote the 2013 album History Of The Visitation and the 2015 album Obscure Knowledge (Cuneiform) Medi√¶val B√¶bes Torabi regularly plays guitar and cuatro as a recording and touring musician and occasionally writes with the Medi√¶val B√¶bes. Believers Roast Torabi started the label Believers Roast in 2009, initially as a platform to release his own music, however since the release of 2010's The Leader Of The Starry Skies it has released music Torabi feels particularly strongly about, including The Gasman, Thumpermonkey and Redbus Noface The Utopia Strong Torabi also plays in The Utopia Strong alongside Steve Davis (DJ and snooker player) and Coil member, Michael J. York. Their first album \\"The Utopia Strong\\" was released in 2020. Other musical projects Further work with Dan Chudley (Miss Helsinki, Authority, Hatchjaw & Bassett) Since the breakup of The Monsoon Bassoon, Torabi has maintained an ongoing (if interrupted) musical relationship with Dan Chudley , resulting in several other projects. The first of these was Miss Helsinki , a more straightforward rock band which recorded a couple of tracks and played a few acoustic gigs in 2002. The band failed to find a steady lineup (despite assistance from Richard Larcombe from Stars In Battledress and from Monsoon Bassoon drummer Jamie Keddie) and consequently folded. Torabi, Chudley and Keddie worked together again when they formed another rock band, Authority , in 2005 (the lineup was completed by Craig Fortnam of North Sea Radio Orchestra on bass). Authority recorded several songs and played live over the next two years, but never released anything beyond a couple of MySpace uploads. The band split in 2007 due to the various members' other commitments and Chudley's move to Cornwall. Torabi and Chudley have worked on another project together ‚Äì the instrumental Hatchjaw & Bassett, which Chudley has described as \\"acoustic spiritual music\\".Description on Dan Chudley's The Don And Only MySpace page, accessed 23 August 2009 This project has not released any records, although a video featuring the duo and their music has appeared on YouTube.Hatchjaw & Bassett ‚Äì Dynasty video, hosted by YouTube, accessed 19 August 2008 Work with Spider Stacy (2001‚Äì2003) Before the split of The Monsoon Bassoon, Torabi toured as guitarist with former Pogues member Spider Stacy's group, Wisemen (which also featured other ex-Pogues). After line-up changes, the group became The Vendettas. Torabi co-wrote and produced an album with Spider in 2003, but the project was shelved in the wake of the Pogues' reunion that year. Torabi has subsequently expressed an interest in releasing the album on his own Believer's Roast label. Admirals Hard Torabi is a member of Admirals Hard, an occasional \\"sea-shanty supergroup\\" made up of members of London math-rock bands and avant-garde folk groups (Stars in Battledress, Tunng, Max Tundra, Foe and The Monsoon Bassoon) and fronted by singer Andy Carne. Torabi plays mandolin and guitar (and sings backing vocals) for the group. Chrome Hoof He played guitar with Chrome Hoof between 2009 and 2010 (contributing to the 2010 album Crush Depth). The Interesting Alternative Show Since 2010 Torabi has been co-presenting \\"The Interesting Alternative Show\\" on Monday evenings, 10pm‚Äì12am with former snooker player Steve Davis on Brentwood radio station Phoenix FM.Phoenix FM ‚Äì The Interesting Alternative Show The show focusses largely on experimental, avant-progressive, psychedelic, electronic, folk and rock music with an emphasis on new releases.

In 2001, plans were announced for a merger with Kent Ambulance Service, but these were shelved six months later after local resistance was encountered. A Commission for Health Improvement (CHI) began a clinical governance review of the trust in 2002. Its report in 2003 criticised managerial staff at the trust for having inadequate systems to communicate with staff. In 2005, it emerged that the trust‚Äôs despatch system had suffered computer failure four times over a period of a few months. The service started to use thrombolysis for suspected heart attacks in October 2003; by 2005 they had treated their 50th patient with this. The service had established a community first responder scheme by 2006. In 2000, the trust had an agreement with the Gambian Government to provide training to some African emergency service workers.

Club career On 13 November 2009, Montes was linked with a move to the Primera Divisi√≥n de F√∫tbol de El Salvador (La Primera) club Indios de Ciudad Ju√°rez. He did not sign with the club, as Indios coach Jos√© Trevi√±o stated that reinforcements, including Montes, would not be brought in. On 15 April 2011, Miguel Montes left C.D. √Åguila after 2 years in the club, first being capped in the La Primera's Apertura 2009. He left because the club had not paid him for over a month and a half. On 14 May 2011, Miguel Montes signed for one year at Isidro Metap√°n. He told a Salvadoran radio station, \\"I'm happy because I reached an agreement with the people of Isidro Metap√°n, they were interested like me and came to the concentration, spoke with me and we reached an agreement.\\" On May 2012, he signed for Alianza.http://futbol.univision.com/centroamerica/el- salvador/article/2012-05-11/el-isidro-metapan-confirmo-bajas-y-busca- portero#axzz1uPiMWo7k International career Montes received call ups to the national team in 1998 and in 2001, but did not get his first cap until 24 May 2004, in a friendly match against Haiti. Following the Haiti game, Montes was once again neglected by national team coaches, that is until June 2007 when Mexican coach Carlos de los Cobos called him up to participate in the 2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup. Although he missed out on the opening two game, Montes did play in the team's third and final cup game against the USA. Since then, Montes has become a mainstay with the national team. On 20 March 2010, Montes was given a one-year ban and a fine of $250 by the El Salvador Football Federation on account of not wearing the team's sponsored kit. He wore gloves and socks for a different sponsor on numerous occasions, including the Gold Cup in the U.S in 2009. The federation signed a $600,000 deal with the sponsor in 2008, meaning all players were to wear the same sponsored kit to fulfill the sponsorship deal. After a year of suspension, Montes was called up by then coach Jos√© Luis Rugamas in a friendly international against Cuba on 24 March 2011. He entered as substitute for injured Dagoberto Portillo in the second half. On September 20, 2013, Montes was one of 14 Salvadoran players banned for life due to their involvement with match fixing.

It aims at promoting economic liberalism through economic education of the general public and what it regards as efficient public policies in Quebec and Canada through studies and conferences. Its research areas include different topics such as health care, education, taxation, labour, agriculture and the environment. Its studies are often mentioned in the media. History The MEI was incorporated in July 1987, after being created by a group of Qu√©bec intellectuals and businessmen as the continuation of the Institut √©conomique de Paris √† Montr√©al (which was directed by economists Pierre Lemieux). MEI's activities soared in the late 1990s with the nomination of Michel Kelly-Gagnon as Executive Director. The Institute rapidly established a leading place in debates on economic policy in the province of Quebec and managed to attract leading academics. Several members of its board of directors and many of its fellows play a significant role in Quebec's economy as entrepreneurs or intellectuals. Maxime Bernier served as its vice president, from May to November 2005, before he became federal Minister of Industry. Bernier explained that his role at the Institute was mainly fundraising and act as an advisor to Kelly Gagnon. Tasha Kheiriddin also briefly occupied this position from March to September 2006, before moving to the Quebec branch of the Fraser Institute. From February 2007 to October 2009, the vice president was Marcel Boyer, professor of economics at the University of Montreal. The vice president is currently Jasmin Gu√©nette, former director of public affairs who came back after spending two years at the Institute for Humane Studies in Virginia. Paul Muller was president of the MEI from 2006 to 2012 and former policy adviser to leader of Action d√©mocratique du Qu√©bec, Mario Dumont. From 2000 until 2008, the MEI prepared a ranking of Quebec high schools published in L'actualit√© magazine every fall. In 2009, Kelly Gangon returned to the MEI as president and moved the organisation from a $269,342http://www.iedm.org/uploaded/pdf/rapport08_fr.pdf deficit for financial year ending December 31, 2008 to a $153,188http://www.iedm.org/uploaded/pdf/rapport09_fr.pdf surplus (as of December 31, 2009) in the context of a severe recession During 2012 Quebec student protests, their office was damaged by militants who disapproved of their positions. MEI recruited Joe Oliver, the former Minister of Finance in Stephen Harper's Conservative Party of Canada government, as a 'Distinguished Senior Fellow' in 2016. Youri Chassin, who was the research director from 2012-2017 was elected as MNA for Saint-J√©r√¥me. Description MEI states that it does not participate in partisan activities. Its public interventions are meant only to analyze the relevance of public policies, their costs and benefits, and their impact on individuals and on private and public organizations. Our work remains the same regardless of who proposes or opposes specific policies. It rejects characterizations such as \\"right-wing\\" and \\"libertarian,\\" MEI advocates policies in line with economic liberalism, such as loosening Quebec‚Äôs labour laws, increasing the transparency of labour union financing, merit pay for teachers, and ending Canada Post's monopoly on letter delivery, as well as a general downsizing of the state. The institute maintains a \\"Chinese wall\\" between its researchers and its Donors. The institute states that the publications and videos are not submitted to Donors or their representatives for approval or editing before they are released.  Funding  MEI is a registered Canadian charity and Kelly-Gagnon has said that 65-70% of MEI's funding comes from foundations, with an additional 15-20% coming from individuals and the remainder coming from corporations; it does not accept funding from the public sector. Its 2015 budget was $2.3 million, and had a full-time staff of 12 as of March 2016. Its tax returns indicate that major support comes from the Stowers Institute for Medical Research, the Donner Canadian Foundation, and the Chase Foundation of Virginia.

He was named a People's Artist of the USSR in 1980. Andrey Petrov is known for his music for numerous classic Soviet films such as I Step Through Moscow, Beware of the Car, and Office Romance. Life A native of St. Petersburg (then Leningrad), Petrov was the son of a military doctor; his mother was an artist. He had little interest in music until, at fourteen, he saw The Great Waltz; after this he decided to become a composer. He studied composition at the Leningrad Conservatory under Orest Yevlakhov. Petrov is known for his work in various genres; he wrote a number of operas and ballets, as well as symphonic works, incidental and film music, and various songs. He is especially famous for his ballet Creation of the World, based on drawings by Jean Effel. This was performed around the world, with Mikhail Baryshnikov among its first performers. Petrov also scored over eighty films, including the Soviet-American co-production The Blue Bird. From 1964 until his death Petrov was the head of the St. Petersburg Composers' Union, to which he was introduced by Dmitri Shostakovich. He also founded and served as the general director of a music festival in St. Petersburg. He won numerous prizes and awards; on May 22, 1998, he was made an honorary citizen of St. Petersburg. In 1993 a small planet, asteroid 4785 (Petrov) was named after him. https://minorplanetcenter.net//iau/ECS/MPCArchive/1993/MPC_19930604.pdf Petrov's wife, Natalya Yefimovna, was a well-known musicologist; his only daughter, Olga, co-wrote a number of his later works.

The group claims to have released videos of its attack on US troops. The 1920 Revolution Brigade insists that Hamas in Iraq was involved in assisting US troops in their recent Diyala operations against Al-Qaeda in Iraq. Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki has feared the US-armed 'concerned local citizens' are an armed Sunni opposition in the making, and has argued that such groups should be under the command of the Iraqi Army or police. On October 11, 2007, the militia group joined a political council that embraced armed insurgency against American forces.Iraq insurgent groups form one council  Political program  Hamas in Iraq released a political program in April 2007 with some of the following provisions: * \\"The movement believes in armed jihad as a means for expelling the occupier, and calls on public opinion and agencies and international institutions to respect this right... of all peoples to resist occupation, and to distinguish between that and armed crimes which target innocent civilians.\\" * \\"We believe in a necessary link between military efforts and political action as two mutually supportive instruments for achieving the goals of resistance for liberation and salvation and preventing the fundamentalist movements from harvesting the fruits of the resistance.\\" * \\"We confirm the necessity of continuing the killing until the exit of the last soldier from the occupying armies, and to not negotiate with the enemy except with an agreement of the factions of the jihad and the Iraqi resistance; and under the appropriate circumstances and conditions.\\" In July 2007, The Guardian reported that the group participated with other insurgent groups in an alliance called the Political Council for the Iraqi Resistance, which includes a range of Islamist and nationalist-leaning groups which was formed to negotiate with the Americans in anticipation of an early US withdrawal. Main planks of the joint political program included a commitment to free Iraq from foreign troops, rejection of cooperation with parties involved in political institutions set up under the occupation and a declaration that decisions and agreements made by the US occupation and Iraqi government are null and void.\\" Operations in Diyala in August 2007 The 1920 Revolution Brigades insists that Hamas in Iraq was involved in assisting US troops in their recent Diyala operations against al-Qaeda in Iraq in August 2007. The insistences occurred when The Washington Post reported in a telephone interview with Lt. Col. Joseph Davidson, executive officer of the 2nd Infantry Division, U.S. forces were now \\"partnering with Sunni insurgents from the 1920 Revolution Brigades, which includes former members of ousted president Saddam Hussein's disbanded army.\\" The 1920 Revolution Brigades replied that: \\"We say to ‚Ä¶ the occupation and to your followers and agents that you made a very big lie\\" in linking us with the Diyala anti-al Qaida campaign. The group maintains that the US military spokesman should have referred to \\"Iraqi Hamas\\", which consisted of Brigades before the operations.

Its origins can be traced to the funding of Japan Communications Satellite Company (JCSAT) and Satellite Japan Corporation in 1985. Both companies merged into Japan Satellite Systems Inc. in 1993. In 2000 the company was renamed as JSAT Corporation and was listed in the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. In September 1, 2008, the company was merged into the SKY Perfect JSAT Group. History With the opening of the Japanese satellite communications market to private investment, Japan Communications Satellite Company (JCSAT) and Satellite Japan Corporation were founded in 1985. On June of the same year, JCSAT awarded an order to Hughes Space and Communications for two identical satellites, JCSAT-1 and JCSAT-2, based on the spin-stabilized HS-393 satellite bus. JCSAT-1, the first commercial Japanese communications satellite, was successfully launched aboard an Ariane-44LP on March 6, 1989. Its brother was launched aboard a Commercial Titan III on January 1, 1990. In 1992 N-Star was created as a joint venture between JSAT, NTT, NTT Communications and NTT DoCoMo for the supply of these latter two WIDESTAR satellite telephone and data packet service. JSAT would handle the satellite side of business and NTT DoCoMo would operate the payload. Two identical satellites were ordered on 1992 from Space Systems Loral, N-STAR a and N-STAR b, for 1995 and 1996 on orbit delivery. They would be \\"switchboards in the sky\\" having S band, C band, Ka band and Ku band payload. On 1993, Japan Communications Satellite Company and Satellite Japan Corporation merged to form Japan Satellite Systems Inc. (JCSAT). That same year, JCSAT orderedJCSAT-3, a third satellite from Hughes, using the HS-601 platform. In 1995, JCSAT obtained a license for international service, and thus became a regional operator. On August 29, 1995 an Atlas IIAS successfully launched JCSAT-3 into orbit. On the same August 29 but on an Ariane 44P, N-STAR a was successfully launched. On December, JCSAT ordered a fourth satellite, JCSAT-4, with the same manufacturer and platform as JCSAT-3. N-STAR b, launched on February 5, 1996, also aboard an Ariane 44P. The satellite telephone service was operational in March 1996. On June 1996, JCSAT ordered JCSAT-5, another HS-601-based satellite, and the twin JCSAT-6 in December, from Hughes. On February 17, 1997 JCSAT-4 was renamed JCSAT-R after being put in orbit by an Atlas IIAS. By September 1997, both JCSAT and Space Communications Corporation (SCC) had requested the 110¬∞East position. The Japanese government made both companies share the 100¬∞E position, and thus both made a joint order on November 1998 for N-SAT-110 from Lockheed Martin. It was also called JCSAT-7 by JCSAT, and Superbird-5 by SCC. On December 2, an Ariane-44P successfully orbited JCSAT-5, which became JCSAT-1B. JSAT-6 was rechristened as JCSAT-4A after successfully being injected in its transfer orbit by an Atlas IIAS on February 16, 1999. In 2000, the company name was changed to JSAT Corporation, and was listed on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. On March 2000, JSAT received the NTT Communications interest in the N-STAR a and N-STAR b satellites. N-STAR c was ordered by NTT DoCoMo from Lockheed Martin and Orbital Sciences Corporation. Orbital would supply the spacecraft and procure launch services and Lockheed would deliver the payload an act as main contractor. In April 2000, JSAT ordered JCSAT-8 from Boeing Satellite Development Center (which had acquired the HS-601 business from Hughes), to replace JCSAT-2 at the 154¬∞ East slot. N-SAT-110 was successfully launched October 6 by an Ariane 42L, at which point it was renamed JCSAT 110 and Superbird-D. Horizons Satellite was originally an equal share joint venture with PanAmSat. It ordered its first satellite, Horizons-1/Galaxy 13 from Boeing in middle 2001. It was a spacecraft with 24 C band and 24 Ku band transponders. It had a 10 kW power generation capacity and 15 years of expected life. Horizons-1 was successfully launched on October 1, 2003 aboard a Zenit-3SL rocket from the Ocean Odyssey platform in the Pacific. An Ariane 44L successfully launched JCSAT-8 on March 28, 2002 from Guiana Space Centre. Once successfully deployed, it was renamed JCSAT-2A. N-STAR c was successfully launched on July 5, 2002 along Stellat 5 on an Ariane 5G. JSAT switched satellite suppliers again and on April 30, 2003 awarded an order for JCSAT-9 to Lockheed Martin and its A2100AXS platform. A hybrid satellite with 20 C band, 20 Ku band, and 1 S-band transponders, it was expected for launch in 2005 for the 132¬∞ East slot. On May 2003 JSAT leased some of JCSAT-9 transponders to NTT DoCoMo to be used as N-STAR d. On August 2003 the JSAT acquired the NTT DoCoMo interest on N-STAR a and N-STAR b, whom then leased them back. On April 20, 2004, JSAT ordered a second satellite from Lockheed, JCSAT-10. Based on the A2100AX platform, it would have a C band and Ku band payload and was expected to occupy the 128¬∞East slot after its planned 2006 launch. On August 30, 2005, Orbital Sciences announced that Horizons Satellite had ordered a small satellite based on the STAR-2 platform, Horizons-2, for the PanAmSat licensed orbital slot at 74¬∞West. It would carry 20 Ku band transponders, generate 3.5 kW of power, weight around and was expected to be launched in 2007. The same year PanAmSat was taken over of by Intelsat, but it had no negative impact on the Horizons joint venture. On October 3, 2005, JSAT ordered a third A2100-based satellite from LM, JCSAT-11. It would also have a C band and Ku band payload, and would be launched in 2007 to act as a backup for the whole JSAT fleet. During 2006, JSAT successfully launched two satellites. On April 12, 2006 a Zenit-3SL successfully orbited JCSAT-9 from a platform on the Pacific Ocean. JSAT had leased some transponders to NTT DoCoMo to be used as N-STAR d. Once in its 132¬∞ East orbital position, it was known as JCSAT 5A and N-STAR d. Then, on October 11, an Ariane 5 ECA launched JCSAT-10 along Syracuse-3B into a transfer orbit. Upon successful deployment at 128¬∞East longitude, it was renamed JCSAT-3A. On May 1, 2007, Intelsat put the order for the Star-2-based Intelsat-15 satellite to Orbital Sciences. In a business deal, five of its 22 Ku band transponders were sold to JSAT. Under this arrangement, Intelsat-15 became JCSAT-85 for the JSAT payload, since it was to be positioned at the 85¬∞E longitude. The almost 19-year streak of successful JCSAT launches was ended when a Proton-M/Briz-M failed to orbit JCSAT-11 on September 5, 2007. A damaged pyro firing cable on the interstage truss prevented the second stage from controlling its direction, and the rocket and its payload crashed into the Kazakhstan steppes. Being lucky in misfortune, JCSAT-11 was simply an on-orbit backup and thus it had no operational impact on the fleet. The same day of the launch failure, JSAT placed an order with Lockheed for an identical replacement, JCSAT-12, for launch in 2009. On September 19, 2007, they closed a deal with Arianespace for a launch slot with an Ariane 5 for its launch. On December 21, 2007, Horizons Satellite used an Ariane 5 rocket to launch Horizons-2. On March 2008, SCC became a wholly owned subsidiary of SKY Perfect JSAT Group. At the SKY Perfect JSAT board meeting of August 6, 2008, it was resolved to merge SKY Perfect Communications, JSAT Corporation and Space Communications Corporation. This consolidated the Superbird fleet into JSAT and created the fifth satellite operator in the world at the time. The merge consolidated all companies under the SKY Perfect JSAT corporate entity, transferring all assets and operations and liquidating the absorbed companies legal entities.

Mabry earned a fortune through land and railroad speculation during the 1850s, and was known throughout the South for his herd of race horses.Laura Holder, Mabry-Hazen House. Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2009. Retrieved: 11 August 2011. During the Civil War, Mabry donated a large supply of uniforms and tents to the Confederate Army, and was rewarded with the rank of general. For the remainder of his life, he was thus often referred to by the sobriquet, \\"General Mabry.\\"James B. Jones Jr., A Blood Feud in Nineteenth Century Knoxville: The Mabry, Lusby, and O'Connor Killings, 1881-1882, The Courier, Vol. 49, No. 2 (June 2011), pp. 11-15. Retrieved: 11 August 2011. In his day, Mabry was one of Knoxville's most influential citizens. In 1853, Mabry and his brother-in- law, William G. Swan, donated the initial acreage for the city's Market Square.Jack Neely, Market Square: A History of the Most Democratic Place on Earth (Knoxville, Tenn.: Market Square District Association, 2009), pp. 9, 168. As president of the Knoxville and Kentucky Railroad, Mabry raised millions of dollars in funding for railroad construction in the region.Jerome Taylor, \\"The Extraordinary Life and Death of Joseph A. Mabry,\\" East Tennessee Historical Society Publications, No. 44 (1972), pp. 41-70. After the Civil War, Mabry quickly made amends with the city's pro-Union businessmen, and continued to champion railroad development. By the 1870s, however, his business ventures had mostly failed, leaving him heavily in debt. In 1882, Mabry and his son were killed in a shootout with banker Thomas O'Connor in downtown Knoxville, an incident later chronicled by Mark Twain in his book, Life on the Mississippi. The Mabry‚ÄìHazen House, built by Mabry in 1858, still stands in Knoxville. Biography Early life Mabry was born near modern Concord in west Knox County, Tennessee, to state legislator and farmer Joseph Alexander Mabry and Alice Hare Scott. In 1837, the elder Mabry was killed in a duel in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, leaving Mabry to be raised by his older brother, George (builder of the Mabry-Hood House). After completing school in Knox County, Mabry is believed to have attended the Holston Seminary (in New Market), and possibly Tusculum College, although the latter has no record of his attendance. Pre-Civil War businesses In the early 1850s, Mabry formed a landholding company that speculated in land on the periphery of Knoxville. In 1853, Mabry and his brother-in-law, attorney William G. Swan, donated what is now Market Square (then empty pastureland just north of the city limits) to the city for the establishment of a market house, where regional farmers could sell produce. During the same period, Mabry used his connections in the Tennessee state legislature to obtain funding for railroad construction, acquiring over the years millions of dollars in bonds for the Knoxville and Kentucky Railroad (by the time the railroad was placed in receivership in 1869, it had been loaned over $2.3 million by the state). Mabry was named president of this railroad in 1858, and had begun building the first stretch of this line to Clinton when the Civil War halted construction. Mabry raised prized racehorses that competed in races across the South, and in 1860 he listed his occupation as \\"stock raiser.\\" In 1858, Mabry built what is now known as the Mabry-Hazen House on a hill in East Knoxville, where he lived for the rest of his life. Mabry also served as a trustee for East Tennessee University (now the University of Tennessee). Civil War By the early 1860s, Mabry was one of Knoxville's largest slaveholders, and like most Democrats, he generally supported secession. During the secession crisis that followed Abraham Lincoln's election in November 1860, Mabry waffled between angrily calling for \\"immediate secession,\\" and seeking a peaceful resolution to the crisis. In April 1861, Mabry chased away a Confederate brass band attempting to interrupt a speech by pro-Unionist Andrew Johnson. The following day, however, Union supporter Charles Douglas was shot by a Confederate soldier on Gay Street in an incident for which Mabry was later charged as an accessory. In December 1861, William \\"Parson\\" Brownlow, the vitriolic pro- Union editor of the Knoxville Whig, was jailed by Confederate authorities on charges of treason. While most of Knoxville's secessionists celebrated the arrest and called for Brownlow to be hanged, Mabry nevertheless lobbied on Brownlow's behalf, and managed to secure his release. Brownlow never forgot this gesture, and during the Reconstruction period following the war, Mabry was one of the few ex-Confederates spared the wrath of Brownlow's regime. During the war, Mabry established a supply depot that provided uniforms and tents to Confederate soldiers. He later claimed to have donated $100,000 to the Confederate cause, although historians point out that he may have earned upwards of one million dollars in contracts with Confederate purchasing agents during the course of the war. Furthermore, when the Union Army occupied Knoxville in September 1863, Mabry quickly switched sides, and offered his assistance to the occupying forces. He took the United States Oath of Allegiance on January 29, 1864. Post-war activities After the war, Mabry continued championing railroad construction. Working with fellow Confederate- turned-Unionist Charles McClung McGhee, Mabry helped extend the Knoxville and Kentucky Railroad to modern Caryville, providing invaluable railroad access to the lucrative coalfields of western Anderson County. By 1869, however, the railroad was bankrupt and placed in receivership. Mabry's fortunes began to decline, and in subsequent years he fell deeply into debt. Throughout the 1860s, Mabry consistently quarrelled with Knoxville attorney John Baxter, who accused Mabry of opportunism and profiteering during the war. In 1869, after the Knoxville and Kentucky was placed in receivership, Baxter sued Mabry, claiming that Mabry had practically pillaged the company. The two assailed one another in the press, and filed libel suits and counter libel suits against one another. Finally, on June 13, 1870, Mabry approached Baxter in front of the Lamar House Hotel, stated, \\"Business is business,\\" and shot Baxter in the wrist. Baxter managed to run away, and for reasons unknown, never pressed charges. Mabry-O'Conner shootout In December 1881, Mabry's son, Will, was shot and killed by Constable Don Lusby during a barroom brawl at Snodderly's bar on Gay Street. Lusby was arrested for murder, but acquitted of the charge in April 1882, leaving the Mabry family outraged. For several weeks, Mabry and Lusby exchanged threats. In August 1882, a chaotic brawl erupted at the Knox County Courthouse involving Mabry, his son Joseph Mabry, III, Lusby, Lusby's father, and several others. During the fracas, Lusby and his father were shot and killed. Mabry and his son were charged with the murder of the Lusbys, but were acquitted. In 1880, Mabry sold a parcel of land to Mechanics' National Bank president Thomas O'Conner under the stipulation that O'Conner give the land to Mabry's son, Will. After Will's death, the land became O'Conner's, leading Mabry to suspect that O'Conner had somehow arranged for Will to be murdered. On October 17, 1882, a visibly intoxicated Mabry confronted O'Conner at the Fair Grounds in South Knoxville, but O'Conner backed off, saying it was neither the time nor place to settle their dispute. That evening, Mabry sent O'Conner a message, stating he would \\"kill him on sight.\\" On the morning of October 19, 1882, O'Conner stepped outside the Mechanics' Bank and spotted Mabry walking down Gay Street. O'Conner quickly grabbed a double-barreled shotgun, and emptied both barrells into Mabry, killing him instantly. Hearing the commotion, Joseph Mabry, III, hurried toward the bank, and upon seeing his father's body, drew a pistol and shot O'Conner. As O'Conner fell mortally wounded, he managed to fire one final shot, killing the younger Mabry. Along with these three deaths, seven bystanders were wounded by stray shot from O'Conner's gun. Legacy Mabry and his son, the latter representing the third consecutive generation of the family killed in a gunfight, were buried next to Will Mabry in Old Gray Cemetery after a funeral at the Mabry-Hazen House on October 20, 1882. O'Conner was buried in the same cemetery the following day. Chapter 40 of Mark Twain's 1883 book, Life on the Mississippi, references an account of the Mabry-O'Conner shootout. (Twain spells Thomas's name O'Connor.)Mark Twain, Life on the Mississippi (P.F. Collier, 1917), pp. 334-335. Mabry's granddaughter, Evelyn Hazen, eventually inherited the Mabry-Hazen House, and lived there until her death in 1987. The house has since been transformed into a historic house museum. During the 1960s, Mabry's descendants sued the City of Knoxville over the demolition of the Market House on Market Square, which the city replaced with the Market Mall. The family argued this action violated the 1853 Mabry-Swan deed, which stipulated the land must be used for a Market House for farmers, or its ownership would revert to Mabry and Swan, or their heirs.

Half Moon is a joint production of Iran, Austria, France and Iraq. This movie was commissioned by the New Crowned Hope festival, a celebration of the 250th birthday of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and the story plot has been inspired in part by Mozart's Requiem. Plot Mamo, an old Kurdish musician in the twilight of his life, plans to perform one final concert in Iraqi Kurdistan. The village's elderly warn him that as the moon becomes full, something awful would happen to him and urge him not to proceed with his plan. After several months of trying to overcome the red-tape, he begins a long and dangerous journey along with his sons. Along the way, the group picks up female singer Hesho who resides in a village of 1,334 exiled women singers. This adds to the complications of the trip as Hesho did not have authorization to go into Iraq. Despite all these obstacles, Mamo is determined to continue with his journey across the border.

It is a type of f-divergence. The Hellinger distance is defined in terms of the Hellinger integral, which was introduced by Ernst Hellinger in 1909. Definition Measure theory To define the Hellinger distance in terms of measure theory, let P and Q denote two probability measures that are absolutely continuous with respect to a third probability measure Œª. The square of the Hellinger distance between P and Q is defined as the quantity :H^2(P,Q) = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\displaystyle \\\\int \\\\left(\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{dP}{d\\\\lambda}} - \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{dQ}{d\\\\lambda}}\\\\right)^2 d\\\\lambda. Here, dP / dŒª and dQ / dŒª are the Radon‚ÄìNikodym derivatives of P and Q respectively. This definition does not depend on Œª, so the Hellinger distance between P and Q does not change if Œª is replaced with a different probability measure with respect to which both P and Q are absolutely continuous. For compactness, the above formula is often written as :H^2(P,Q) = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\int \\\\left(\\\\sqrt{dP} - \\\\sqrt{dQ}\\\\right)^2. Probability theory using Lebesgue measure To define the Hellinger distance in terms of elementary probability theory, we take Œª to be Lebesgue measure, so that dP / dŒª and dQ / dŒª are simply probability density functions. If we denote the densities as f and g, respectively, the squared Hellinger distance can be expressed as a standard calculus integral :H^2(f,g) =\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\int \\\\left(\\\\sqrt{f(x)} - \\\\sqrt{g(x)}\\\\right)^2 \\\\, dx = 1 - \\\\int \\\\sqrt{f(x) g(x)} \\\\, dx, where the second form can be obtained by expanding the square and using the fact that the integral of a probability density over its domain equals 1. The Hellinger distance H(P, Q) satisfies the property (derivable from the Cauchy‚ÄìSchwarz inequality) : 0\\\\le H(P,Q) \\\\le 1. Discrete distributions For two discrete probability distributions P=(p_1, \\\\ldots, p_k) and Q=(q_1, \\\\ldots, q_k), their Hellinger distance is defined as : H(P, Q) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} \\\\; \\\\sqrt{\\\\sum_{i=1}^k (\\\\sqrt{p_i} - \\\\sqrt{q_i})^2}, which is directly related to the Euclidean norm of the difference of the square root vectors, i.e. : H(P, Q) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} \\\\; \\\\bigl\\\\|\\\\sqrt{P} - \\\\sqrt{Q} \\\\bigr\\\\|_2 . Also, 1 - H^2(P,Q) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^k (\\\\sqrt{p_i q_i}). Properties The Hellinger distance forms a bounded metric on the space of probability distributions over a given probability space. The maximum distance 1 is achieved when P assigns probability zero to every set to which Q assigns a positive probability, and vice versa. Sometimes the factor 1/\\\\sqrt{2} in front of the integral is omitted, in which case the Hellinger distance ranges from zero to the square root of two. The Hellinger distance is related to the Bhattacharyya coefficient BC(P,Q) as it can be defined as : H(P,Q) = \\\\sqrt{1 - BC(P,Q)}. Hellinger distances are used in the theory of sequential and asymptotic statistics.

The squared Hellinger distance between two Weibull distributions \\\\scriptstyle P\\\\,\\\\sim \\\\,\\\\rm{W}(k,\\\\alpha) and \\\\scriptstyle Q\\\\,\\\\sim\\\\,\\\\rm{W}(k,\\\\beta) (where k is a common shape parameter and \\\\alpha\\\\, , \\\\beta are the scale parameters respectively): : H^2(P, Q) = 1 - \\\\frac{2 (\\\\alpha \\\\beta)^{k/2}}{\\\\alpha^k + \\\\beta^k}. The squared Hellinger distance between two Poisson distributions with rate parameters \\\\alpha and \\\\beta, so that \\\\scriptstyle P\\\\,\\\\sim \\\\,\\\\rm{Poisson}(\\\\alpha) and \\\\scriptstyle Q\\\\,\\\\sim\\\\,\\\\rm{Poisson}(\\\\beta), is: : H^2(P,Q) = 1-e^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}(\\\\sqrt{\\\\alpha} - \\\\sqrt{\\\\beta})^2}.

He attended Ainsworth Primary School (Standards 1 to 6); Shepherds Junior Buruburu (Standards 6 to 8); Jamuhuri High School and eventually Kenya Christian Industrial Training Institute (K.C.I.T.I) Eastleigh where he received a diploma in Information technology. There, he played basketball with ambitions to make it to the Kenyan National Basketball Team. He never made it in the team, blaming this on his height. His earlier foray into music included singing in a band called 'Sita Futi'. Sita Futi disbanded almost as soon as it was started leaving behind Jua Cali and his close friend Jemmoh. The departing group members left to pursue careers outside music. Calif Records came into being after Jua Cali teamed up with childhood friend Clemo to form the record label that quickly became a hit factory, gaining prominence in the East Africa music scene with chart topping artists and music. Calif Records also invented the Genge genre of Kenyan hip hop. Jua Cali often cites his brother, Chris, and his parents as his greatest influences in life.He is also related to dell xerxes as his brother in law Music career His first recorded track was Ruka, released in 2001, and was followed by Nipe Asali in 2002. In 2004 he collaborated with Pilipili in track \\"Kamata Dame\\". Like most Kenyan artists, it took several years before his first full album was released. His album \\"Juacali Sekta\\" reached the stores in 2006, containing mostly previously released singles. His single Kwaheri (featuring Sainapei Tande-winner Coca-Cola pop star and radio presenter) was a major hit in Kenya in 2007.Daily Nation, 29 December 2007: Kenya: 2007 ‚Äì the Year in Which Local Music Boomed At the New Year's Eve 2008/2009 he released a new album, Ngeli ya Genge.Daily Nation, Zuqka magazine, 30 December 2008: New Year‚Äôs Genge party He has toured the US and other countries.The Standard, 26 January 2006: Tour gripes In August 2007, he was among 100 most influential Kenyans as selected by The Standard newspaper.The Standard, 21 August 2007: most influential KenyansThe Standard, 21 August 2007: 100 most influential Kenyans ‚Äì Entertainment His stage name Jua Cali, is derived from California, an estate in Nairobi (as is the name of Calif Records). It also resembles Jua Kali, a Swahili term meaning fierce sun, which has been taken to refer to Kenya's informal sector of the economy. He has released a series of new songs with a new producer Keggah based in the United States. His new songs include, Karibu Nairobi and Kuna Sheng which have both received massive airplay and good reviews. Endorsements Motorola Besides being talented, he's a commercial success, thanks to his appeal to the young and the not-so-young alike. For instance, he became Kenya's first artiste to get an endorsement deal when in 2007 he signed a reported Sh1-million-a-year deal mobile phone giant Motorola for its W model. And, according to the company, he was quite a catch. \\" Jua Cali is part of the Motorola family, and we are honoured to have worked with him in the recent past,\\" says Joanne Doyle, the marketing manager for East Africa. \\"He has been a great ambassador and, like Motorola, he is all about creativity, style and substance, so we could not be happier that his hard work has been recognised at the prestigious Kisima awards.\\" Orange Mobile Juacali shooting the Hello tunes commercial at Nairobi Primary Juacali is arguably today's most successful artist in the Kenyan music scene as far as endorsements and pay per show income is concerned. Early 2009, Telkom Kenya appointed him as the Orange Ambassador for their youth market and began his one-year sh10-million shilling contract by fronting the 'hello tunes' advertising campaign. Following the successes by the Kenyan Rugby Sevens team, Orange went on to shoot a series of infomercials on Rugby featuring top Kenya rugby players and the genge artist. Also featured in the informercials were label mates Mejja, Jimwat and their producer Clemo. Pamoja Mtaani Pamoja Mtaani, Swahili for \\"together in the hood\\" is a new video game in Kenya developed by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. Its basically about a youth band together making their way through a maze of challenges throughout the East African city. The game has a subtle but deliberate agenda: HIV prevention. Players do not directly confront the threat of HIV; instead, they encounter challenges throughout the adventure that lead to lessons about risk and self-confidence. Jua Cali recorded the video games anthem \\"City in the Sun\\". Others The artiste has also been involved in other major advertisements such as Protex bath soap and Pilsner beer, and the deals have raked in big cash. He's also the Bloodlink Foundation Kenya ambassador. Bloodlink Foundation Kenya is a non-profit charitable trust established in Kenya seeking to assist Kenyan people achieve better health and improved quality of life through partnership with communities, corporate organisations and public sectors.

Peet (March 10, 1920 - August 29, 2007) was a Dutch-American entrepreneur and the founder of Peet's Coffee & Tea in Berkeley, California, in 1966. Peet is widely credited with starting the specialty coffee revolution in the US. Among coffee historians, Peet has been called \\"the Dutchman who taught America how to drink coffee.\\" Peet taught his style of roasting beans to Jerry Baldwin, Zev Siegl and Gordon Bowker, who, with his blessing, took the technique to Seattle and founded Starbucks in 1971. Peet later distanced himself, however, from the Starbucks trio as they experimented with ultra-dark roasts. \\"Baldwin never learned anything from me,\\" Peet was later quoted as saying. Life and career Peet was born in Alkmaar, The Netherlands, where his father ran a small coffee roasting establishment, prior to World War II. Following the war; Peet left London, where he had apprenticed with Twinings coffee and tea company, to work as a tea taster in the Dutch East Indies and New Zealand, prior to emigrating to San Francisco, California, in 1955, where he worked in the coffee importing industry. Dismayed with the poor quality of coffee in the United States, Peet opened a coffee store in Berkeley, California, on 1 April 1966. He compared the low quality coffee in the United States to World War II \\"rationed\\" coffee. (in Dutch). Although often encouraged to expand the business, he remained stalwart in keeping the original location at Walnut and Vine, zealously guarding the quality of the coffee bearing his name. After several years of roasting beans in the back of the store using one-, and then five-pound, roasters, in the early 1970s, he acquired a warehouse in the adjacent town of Emeryville, in which he installed a 100-pound roaster, followed by a 300-pound roaster, in 1976. By that time, Peet had two additional retail stores: one on Piedmont in Oakland, and one on University in Palo Alto. He then also sold roasted-to-order, 20 to 50 pound bags of beans to restaurants throughout the Bay Area. Retirement Peet sold his business, in 1979, to Sal Bonavita, for whom he remained a mentor for the next five years. Bonavita soon opened new stores in Oakland, Mill Valley and Menlo Park. After retiring from the coffee business, Peet moved in 2001 to Ashland, Oregon, where he died on August 29, 2007, at age 87. In 1984, Jerry Baldwin led Starbucks in acquiring Peet's four locations from Bonavita. Influence on coffee industry Peet introduced custom coffee roasting of top quality beans to the United States, at a time when Americans were typically drinking coffee brewed from beans freeze-dried in a can.Uncommon Grounds: The History of Coffee and How It Transformed Our World; Mark Pendergrast; Basic Books; 2019; p. 176.Alfred H. Peet, 87, Dies; Leader of a Coffee Revolution, by Carolyn Marshall, September 3, 2007 The origin of Berkeley's Gourmet Ghetto was Peet's first Peet's Coffee location, opened in 1966, at the corner of Walnut and Vine; the area grew around Peet's and adjacent specialty food, health food, and other avant-garde restaurants that sprung up, including Chez Panisse. While Peet was known to have a \\"severe demeanor\\", he also had a genuine willingness to instruct coffee entrepreneurs in the art of bean roasting.(Clark, Taylor) Starbucked: A Double Tall Tale of Caffeine, Commerce, and Culture by Little, Brown; 2007; p. 22. Starbucks co-founder Jerry Baldwin has remembered Peet as a \\"very generous\\" mentor.Uncommon Grounds: The History of Coffee and How It Transformed Our World; Mark Pendergrast; Basic Books; 2019; p. 372. And Baldwin was one of many coffee entrepreneurs that Peet mentored, including Jamie Anderson (Anderson's Coffee, Austin, Texas), David Dessinger (Pegasus Coffee, Bainbridge Island, Washington), Arnold Spinelli (Spinelli Coffee Company, San Francisco, California), Susan O'Hori (O'Hori's Coffee Roasters, Santa Fe, New Mexico) and Leigh McDonald (founder of Coffee Connection in Amsterdam). Other coffee entrepreneurs got into the business simply because they were inspired by Alfred Peet and their experience tasting his coffee at his first Berkeley store. George Howell is a notable example, who founded The Coffee Connection in the Boston, Massachusetts area. Howell is widely credited as having been the inventor of the Frappuccino. Starbucks later acquired his business. Media An interview with Alfred Peet is included in the documentary Coffee Culture USA, released in 2008. Peet's sister, then aged 100, was interviewed by Dutch editor and author Jasper Houtman, for The Coffee Visionary: The Life & Legacy of Alfred Peet, published in 2018.

He was a member of the Breckinridge family of Kentucky, the son of Senator John Breckinridge. A restless youth, Breckinridge was suspended from Princeton University for fighting, and following his graduation from Union College in 1819, was prone to engage in a lifestyle of partying and revelry. But, he was admitted to the bar in 1824 and elected to the Kentucky General Assembly in 1825. A serious illness and the death of a child in 1829 prompted him to turn to religion, and he became an ordained minister in 1832. That year Breckinridge accepted the call to pastor the Second Presbyterian Church of Baltimore, Maryland. While at the church, he became involved in a number of theological debates. During the Old School-New School Controversy within the Presbyterian Church in the 1830s, Breckinridge became a hard-line member of the Old School faction, and played an influential role in the ejection of several churches in 1837. He was rewarded for his stances by being elected moderator of the Presbyterian Church's General Assembly in 1841. After a brief stint as president of Jefferson College in Pennsylvania, Breckinridge returned to Kentucky, where he pastored the First Presbyterian church of Lexington, Kentucky, and was appointed superintendent of public education by Governor William Owsley. The changes he effected in this office brought a tenfold increase in public school attendance and led to him being called the father of the public school system in Kentucky.Klotter in The Kentucky Encyclopedia, p. 120 He left his post as superintendent after six years to become a professor at Danville Theological Seminary in Danville, Kentucky. As the sectional conflict leading up to the Civil War escalated, Breckinridge was put in the unusual position of being a slaveholder who opposed slavery. The tragic scenario of brother against brother literally played out in Breckinridge's family, with two of his sons joining each side during the war. Following the war, Breckinridge retired to his home in Danville, where he died on December 27, 1871. Early life Robert Breckinridge was born March 8, 1800 at Cabell's Dale near Lexington, Kentucky. He was the third son born to Senator John and Mary Hopkins (Cabell) Breckinridge. Senator Breckinridge died in 1806, leaving his wife to tend the family's large plantations. Robert soon earned a reputation of misbehaving. In one instance, he and his brother John had a physical altercation because Robert put salt in a blind cousin's coffee; in another, his mother gave him a \\"tremendous whipping\\" for beating an old slave.Klotter in Breckinridges of Kentucky, p. 42 Breckinridge studied education at a classical school operated by Dr. Louis Marshall, the brother of Chief Justice John Marshall, then followed his brothers, Cabell and John, to Princeton in 1817. His behavior problems continued there; in one year, he spent more than $1200. He was suspended for fighting, and although he was later reinstated, the incident soured him on Princeton, and he was granted an honorable release. (The school later awarded him an honorary Master of Arts degree in 1832.) Breckinridge enrolled at Yale University, but after three months, discovered that a one- year residency was required for graduation. Unwilling to complete this requirement, he moved to Union College in Schenectady, New York, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1819.Waugh in Southern Presbyterian Review Following his graduation, Breckinridge returned to Kentucky with no clear direction in his life. He began to amuse himself by attending various parties and other social engagements. During a visit to the state capital, he so offended one man that he was challenged to a duel. Though he obtained two pistols, he never accepted the man's challenge, and was branded a coward. The dispute was later settled in the Masonic Lodge of which both Breckinridge and the other man were members. On March 11, 1823, Breckinridge married his cousin, Ann Sophonisba Preston at the bride's home in Abingdon, Virginia; the couple had eleven children. Ann's political heritage rivaled that of her husband. A grandniece of Patrick Henry, she was also a sister to Senator William Campbell Preston and a sister-in-law to South Carolina governor Wade Hampton III, and Virginia governors John B. Floyd and James McDowell.Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, p. 43 Service in the Kentucky General Assembly Robert Breckinridge's actions as a Kentucky Representative put him at odds with reasoning espoused by his late father, Senator John Breckinridge Following the advice of his older brother, Breckinridge obtained his law license on January 3, 1824, but the practice of law did not suit him. He instead decided to follow the family tradition and seek public office, campaigning for a seat in the Kentucky House of Representatives. Even in his early political career, he began to articulate his stance on the issues that would become his legacy. First, he shunned the states' rights viewpoint, stressing instead the need for a strong interdependence between the states. Second, he called for an end to slavery. Third, he emphasized the importance of education. Though they agreed on this last point, Breckinridge's father had ardently opposed emancipation of slaves and favored states' rights. Historian James C. Klotter opines that Louis Marshall and Robert's mother Mary may have influenced his positions.Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, p. 44‚Äì45 The most politically charged issue in Kentucky during Breckinridge's campaign, however, was the Old Court-New Court controversy. The Panic of 1819 had left many Kentuckians in dire financial straits. Legislators sought to relieve some of the financial burden by passing a law of replevin which favored debtors. The Kentucky Court of Appeals, (the highest court in the Commonwealth at the time,) declared the law unconstitutional. The next year, an incensed General Assembly passed legislation that dissolved the court and replaced it with a new court. Neither court acknowledged the other as valid, and a confused public lost respect for public authority in general. The issue was generally split along party lines, with Democrats generally favoring the New Court and Whigs favoring the Old Court.Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, p. 45‚Äì46 Breckinridge dodged the issue during the campaign, which he won in 1825, but once he took office, he had to come down on one side or the other. He voted in favor of the Old Court, reflecting his upper-class status and affinity for the establishment. In so doing, he identified himself with the party of Kentucky's favorite son, Henry Clay. The Whigs would control Kentucky politics for the next twenty-five years. In 1826, the majority of the General Assembly sided with the Old Court and abolished the New Court.Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, p. 47 Eventually, tensions faded, but a bigger decision awaited Robert Breckinridge in 1828. He was chosen to sit on a committee that would draft Kentucky's response to the Nullification Crisis. Because much of South Carolina's reasoning for their actions was based on the logic of the Kentucky Resolutions, which had been supported by Senator John Breckinridge, Robert Breckinridge now had to determine whether he should support the words of his late father or refute them. In the end, his Unionist sympathies overrode his sense of loyalty to his father; he sided with the committee's majority in condemning South Carolina's actions. Religious conversion and ministry Throughout his time in the General Assembly, Breckinridge had battled with typhoid fever. In an 1828 letter to his wife, who was visiting relatives in Virginia, he recounted that he had been bedridden and near death for two months. Finally, in February 1829, the illness subsided. Only then could he be told about the death of his daughter, Louisiana, which had occurred a month earlier. The illness, combined with the news of the death of his daughter, caused Breckinridge to turn to religion. In spring 1829, he made a public profession of his faith. In 1831, he hosted a revival meeting on his farm during which he decided to pursue ministerial training under the West Lexington Presbytery. He was ordained as a Presbyterian minister on April 5, 1832.Harrison in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, pp. 48‚Äì50 Breckinridge served as a Ruling Elder at the Presbyterian General Assembly of 1832, then relocated to Princeton, New Jersey, to study under Samuel Miller at Princeton Theological Seminary. In November 1832, he succeeded his brother John as pastor of Second Presbyterian Church of Baltimore, Maryland. His tenure saw numerous converts, but he was put at odds with his brother and Samuel Miller over practices employed in his church. His counselors were also concerned that he was wavering on his belief in the doctrine of limited atonement. Eventually, he was persuaded back into the doctrines of the orthodox Calvinism and became one of the leaders of the Old School Presbyterian movement. Now solidly in the Presbyterian fold, Breckinridge began to follow in the footsteps of his brother John, criticizing Roman Catholicism in a number of his speeches and publications. There were many Catholics in Baltimore. He sponsored and edited two \\"thoroughly Protestant\\" journals - the Baltimore Literary and Religious magazine and the Spirit of the XIX Century. A year-long tour of Europe with his wife that began in April 1836 deepened his disdain for the denomination; he opined that most of the continent's ills could be traced back to Catholic \\"superstitions.\\" A particularly harsh missive against a Catholic who worked in the county almshouse drew an indictment for libel in 1840. The trial ended in a hung jury that voted 10‚Äì2 in favor of acquittal. Though displeased that he could not obtain a unanimous acquittal, Breckinridge continued undaunted. In 1841, he published several of his anti-Catholic articles as Papism in the XIX Century in the United States.Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, pp. 53‚Äì55 Breckinridge was equally controversial in internal church politics. He rebuked the Synod of the Western Reserve for de-emphasizing and effectively abandoning the office of Ruling Elder. He also condemned the governance of Presbyterian missionaries by anyone other than the Presbyterian church. In 1834, he was the chief author of the Act and Testimony, a document summarizing the contentions between the Old and New Schools. The New School resented Breckinridge and those who signed the Act and Testimony, and even some in the Old School camp had hoped for a more moderate course. The differences between the Old and New Schools widened over the teachings of Albert Barnes, and the New School members were ejected from the Presbyterian Church in 1837. Because of his leadership in the Old School-New School controversy, Breckinridge was elected moderator of the Old School branch's General Assembly in 1841. President of Jefferson College Portrait of Breckinridge as President of Jefferson College In 1844, Breckinridge's wife Ann died. Lingering sadness and memories of his and Ann's life in Baltimore may have led him to leave the city and the pastorate he had held for twelve years. He was offered pastorate of the Second Presbyterian Church of Lexington, Kentucky, but instead, accepted the presidency of Jefferson College in Pennsylvania in 1845 against the advice of his brothers John and William. A rift between Breckinridge and his brother Cabell's widow and other relatives may help account for this surprising decision. He did not feel he could yet return to his home state.Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, p. 56 Breckinridge was inaugurated as president of Jefferson College on September 27, 1845. During his tenure, he also pastored a church in the city of Canonsburg, Pennsylvania.Fish, p. 267 College administration apparently did not suit him, however. A student uprising against the president and the faculty occurred in 1846, hastening the end of his short stay at the school. A desire to see his children, most of whom were living with relatives scattered throughout Kentucky and Virginia, also factored into his decision to resign his post in 1847. On his resignation, he was awarded an honorary LL.D from the school. Father of Kentucky's public school system Breckinridge was appointed superintendent of public education by Governor William Owsley Breckinridge returned to Kentucky, accepting the pastorate of First Presbyterian Church of Lexington. His return to Kentucky was also motivated by a growing fondness for his cousin, Virginia Hart Shelby, who had cared for two of his children during his stay in Pennsylvania. Virginia was the widow of Alfred Shelby, the son of Isaac Shelby, who was twice governor of Kentucky. Their written exchanges included love poems from Robert and concerned questions from Virginia about the wisdom of engaging in a relationship. Despite being advised by her sisters to avoid the marriage and her own wavering on the issue, the two were married in April 1847. They had three children, only one of whom survived to adulthood. Disagreements among the children of both partners' previous marriages exacerbated an already tense union, which almost ended in divorce in September 1856. Robert managed to reconcile with his wife, and they remained together until Virginia's death in 1859.Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, pp. 57‚Äì58 Breckinridge's personal turmoil did not hinder his political accomplishments. He was appointed superintendent of public education by Governor William Owsley. He was the sixth person to hold the office since its creation in the 1830s. The task was daunting. Only one of every ten school-age children in Kentucky ever attended school, and at least thirty Kentucky counties had received no state educational funds since 1840.Klotter in The Breckinridges of Kentucky, p. 59 Breckinridge began reforms immediately and zealously. He secured the General Assembly's passage of a two-cent property tax for education. The tax was subject to voter approval, and Breckinridge worked hard to publicize the issue. His efforts paid off, as the tax passed by almost a two-to-one margin. Continuing to publicize needs and push legislators to action, Breckinridge enjoyed the support of five of the six governors under whom he served. Only John L. Helm, who opposed a state-funded school system, challenged him, but Helm's veto of a Breckinridge educational bill was overridden in the General Assembly. Breckinridge's reforms manifested tangible results. From 1847 to 1850, educational spending increased from $6,000 to $144,000. By 1850, only one out of every ten school age children did not attend school. In 1850, Kentuckians ratified their third constitution. One of many changes effected by this document was that the office of superintendent became elective. Though the election belonged to the Democrats, Breckinridge, a Whig, was elected over five challengers for the office. His tenure would be a short one, however. Unlike his early reforms, his calls for parental selection of textbooks and use of the Bible as the primary reading material were not heeded. He also opposed the abolition of tuition charges and unsuccessfully lobbied for a pay increase for his position. (The salary was only $750.) With little prospect of further reform under his leadership, Breckinridge resigned in 1853. Following his resignation, Breckinridge shifted his party affiliation from Whig to Know- Nothing to Republican. In 1853, he helped found Danville Theological Seminary in Danville, Kentucky, becoming a Professor of Exegetic, Didactic and Polemic Theology. Civil War and later life Robert Breckinridge supported Abraham Lincoln for president in 1860 over his nephew, John C. Breckinridge Although he owned a number of slaves, and his marriage to Virginia Shelby had left him with a good many more, Breckinridge had been a supporter of gradual emancipation and colonization of blacks since his early political career. As the sectional crisis worsened, this led him into several high-profile debates, notably with fellow Kentuckian Robert Wickliffe, the uncle of Robert C. Wickliffe. His support of Abraham Lincoln for president in the election of 1860 pitted him against his own nephew, Vice President John C. Breckinridge. At the outbreak of the Civil War, Breckinridge quickly became an ardent supporter of the Union, not for its position against slavery, but for the sake of preserving the Union. He used his position as editor of the Danville Quarterly Review to advocate his position. He called for harsh measures against secession, and in time, accepted President Lincoln's immediate emancipation of slaves. He was chosen as the temporary chair of the 1864 Republican National Convention that re-nominated Lincoln for president, and his pro-Union speech was hailed by freshman Representative James G. Blaine as one of the most inspiring given at the event. Breckinridge's family split on the issue, with two of his sons - Joseph and Charles - fighting for the Union cause, and two - Willie and Robert Jr. - fighting for the Confederacy. While three of his sons-in-law also fought for the Union, daughter Sophonisba's husband, Theophilus Steele, rode with John Hunt Morgan, and it is likely that Robert Breckinridge's intervention kept him from being executed by Edwin M. Stanton. Following the war, Willie Breckinridge's wife Issa refused to let her father-in-law see two of his grandchildren for a period of two years. On November 5, 1868, Breckinridge married his third wife, Margaret Faulkner White. A year later, he resigned his professorship at Danville Seminary. He died on December 27, 1871 after an extensive illness, and was buried in Lexington Cemetery. Legacy In 1892, Breckinridge Hall (named for Breckinridge) was built as a dormitory for students of the Danville Theological Seminary. It is now a residence hall for upper-class students at Centre College in Danville - Breckinridge's nephew John C. Breckinridge's alma mater. Breckinridge Hall was renovated in 1999, and is on the National Register of Historic Places. Breckinridge Hall, a three-story building on Morehead State University's campus, is named for Robert J. Breckinridge.

History  Eruption had a rapidly shifting lineup of musicians whom Schnitzler had met and played with at the Zodiak Free Arts Lab in the late 1960s and very early 1970s. At times Eruption included Klaus Schulze, Manuel G√∂ttsching, and Hartmut Enke, who would go on to form the trio Ash Ra Tempel, Dieter Serfas of the jazz band Embryo, Michael Gunther and Lutz Ulbrich of Agitation Free, Christa Runge, who had read the text on the first Kluster album, as well as members of Amon D√º√ºl. Schnitzler and Schulze had also previously worked together as members of Tangerine Dream, both appearing on that band's first album, Electronic Meditation. Conrad Schnitzler described Eruption this way: \\"So anyway we got 10 musicians together; rock musicians, freejazz and electronic musicians - all together. We did some really interesting things.\\" David Keenan, writing for The Wire issue 261 in November, 2005 described the band: \\"Eruption was a multidisciplinary freeform ensemble put together by cellist, violinist and early electronic improvisor Conrad Schnitzler in 1970 as an adjunct to his work with Kraut behemoths Tangerine Dream and Kluster. They seem to have functioned more as a thinktank for the then explosive Krautrock scene than a straightforward gigging group, with a revolving membership...\\" When Eruption went into the studio the lineup consisted of Schnitzler, Wolfgang Seidel, and Klaus Freudigmann. Freudigmann also recorded the final Kluster concert for Schnitzler, which was erroneously released under the title Kluster und Eruption. Schnitzler has stated in interviews that the band Eruption wasn't included at all on the Kluster album and that the album title should have simply been Eruption, a change that was finally made on the 1997 CD reissue by German label Marginal Talent. The album Eruption by Kluster is a different (live) album than the self-titled (studio) release by the band Eruption. Eruption is notable more as an incubator for later, highly successful Krautrock bands and for the influence the various musicians had on one another than for their releases, which came 35 years after the music was recorded. The 1970 tapes which would become Eruption were shelved until 2005 when Qbico Records finally released the album. David Keenan describes the music as \\"much more punk than the group's links to such centres of kosmische boatfloat might suggest. The music starts out fairly fragmented, with sustained violin drones caught in a flux of scattershot percussion, short passages of silence and wowing effects.\\" Three previously unreleased tracks from 1971 have been included as bonus tracks on the 2007 CD reissues by the Japanese label Captain Trip of the first three Kluster albums: * \\"Black Spring\\" appearing on the reissue of Klopfzeichen, * \\"Cold Winter\\" appearing on the reissue of Zwei-Osterei and * \\"Eruption Soundcheck\\", a short 4 1/2-minute 1971 soundcheck appearing on the 2006 reissue of Kluster's live album Eruption, now retitled \\"Schwarz\\" and credited to Conrad Schnitzler. In 2008, Qbico released Live Action 1972 - Wuppertal, the first release of a live Eruption concert recording. In addition, a 1972 video by Kluster titled Elevator can be viewed from former member Wolfgang Seidel's MySpace page. The 6LP Qbico 1969-1972 album credited to \\"Kluster\\" is actually entirely Eruption recordings from 1970-1971. (The 8LP Vinyl-On-Demand album titled Klusterstrasse 69-72, implying that later Eruption tracks are included, actually only covers the years 1969-1970 and is entirely genuine Kluster recordings.)  Musical Style  Eruption performed free-form, improvisational, experimental music, some of which resembles industrial music. A few pieces do have discernible melodies and/or strong rhythmic elements, at times resembling Conrad Schnitzler's earlier work with Tangerine Dream on their Electronic Meditation album.

Under the leadership of Nicolaus Ludwig, Count von Zinzendorf, who in addition to being a German nobleman was a Bishop of the Moravian Church, it took an active part in the great Evangelical Revival of the eighteenth century and was a pioneer of modern Protestant missionary work (1732).The [British] Moravian Almanac 2007 Organisation Headquarters Moravian Church House, 5‚Äì7 Muswell Hill, London N10 3TJ, England.

All text in this section is taken from. Other work The diaspora work in the British Province seeks to link non-resident and former members of the Moravian Church with each other and the wider life of the Church. Worship From the outset, the Moravian Church has placed a strong emphasis on congregational hymn singing as a form of both worship and learning. One of its early Bishops, Luke of Prague (1460‚Äì1528),Hutton (1909), pp 58‚Äì69 also encouraged the Church to use Hussite and Catholic liturgies to enrich their worship.Linyard and Tovey (1994), p 5 Zinzendorf, who renewed the church in the 1720s, has been described as the most original liturgist of Protestant Christianity.Podmore (1998) p 144 The Moravian Church in Britain has continued to be a liturgical church while at the same time allowing free worship as the occasion demands.Linyard and Tovey (1994), p 27 Moravian Liturgy 1960 Liturgy of the Word The Moravian Liturgy 1960 is currently the main authorised book of services. The liturgy of the Word is contained in six Orders of Worship, each one of which produces a service lasting about one hour. The words of introduction consist of texts from Scripture with a response from the congregation. Confession and absolution also follow Scripture closely and in some Orders feature the Ten Commandments, the Lord‚Äôs Summary of the Law or the Beatitudes. There is provision for the chanting of psalms and canticles such as the Magnificat and the singing of hymns. Among the canticles is a festal doxology from the 1759 Moravian Liturgy. Many prayers are taken from Anglican, Scottish and Free Church texts but some elements are distinctively Moravian. The First Order is grounded in the Litany compiled by Martin Luther and printed in the Brethren's Hymn Book of 1566.The Moravian Liturgy (1960), p v The Sixth Order includes the 'Christ Litany' composed by Zinzendorf. The Liturgy also includes the Apostles' and Nicene creeds and five 'confessions of faith'. The first of the ‚Äòconfessions‚Äô dates from the early days of the Moravian renewal in Germany in the 1720s.Linyard and Tovey, p 9 This is usually used in the Easter dawn service, commonly held in burial grounds. The Nicene Creed in the Moravian Liturgy does not include the 'filioque' clause, i.e., like the Eastern Orthodox Churches, Moravians believe that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father alone and not from 'the Father and the Son'. Linyard and Tovey (1994) do not attach much importance to this but it appears that Zinzendorf accepted the Greek claim that the ‚Äòfilioque‚Äô was a relatively late Western addition. Offices of the Church The Offices of the Church in the Liturgy Book include the Lord's Supper, the Lovefeast, the Cup of Covenant, the Thanksgiving of Mothers, Baptism of Infants, Baptism of Adults & Confirmation, the Reception of Communicants, the Ordination of Ministers, Solemnization of Marriage and Burial of the Dead. The liturgy for the Lord's Supper or holy communion shows a Moravian characteristic in that prayers are addressed not to God the Father but to Christ. The communion prayer is a combination of Anglican and Presbyterian material.Linyard and Tovey (1994), p 13 At the heart of the service is a structure taken from Luther‚Äôs 1526 Deutsche Messe.Linyard and Tovey (1994), p 14 After the Minister has recited the Lord‚Äôs words of institution, the communion wafers are distributed to worshippers in their seats and consumed together. A verse of meditation on the death of Christ is then sung. The same sequence is repeated with the wine, which is distributed in small glasses. Podmore (1998) reports how impressed observers, including Roman Catholics, were to see up to 300 people taking the sacrament together in solemn stillness and then prostrating themselves.Podmore (1998) p 147 After a hymn and a prayer of thanksgiving, a covenant hymn is sung in which members of the congregation exchange the right hand of fellowship. The service concludes with the Aaronic blessing. In most Moravian congregations in Britain, holy communion is celebrated once a month. In the New Testament, the Lovefeast was part of the common meal which included the Lord‚Äôs Supper.Jude, 1:12; Acts 2:46 The Lovefeast was spontaneously revived in the Moravian Church on 13 August 1727 when Count Zinzendorf sent some food to sustain people who wished to remain in prayer and singing following a deeply moving communion service in the parish church of Berthelsdorf on his estates in Saxony.The Moravian Liturgy (1960), p 54 Some Moravian congregations in Britain celebrate the Lovefeast with simple refreshments and singing of hymns as a way of preparing for communion. The Cup of Covenant is a peculiarly Moravian custom. Originating in 1729 as a way of dedicating young men leaving on overseas missions, it involves drinking from a common cup, singing hymns and exchanging the right hand of fellowship.The Moravian Liturgy (1960), p 55 The rite for the Ordination of Ministers makes provision for the ordination of deacons and presbyters and the consecration of bishops. The Moravian Church has retained a threefold order of ministry since its early days and an unbroken succession of bishops since 1553.Anglican-Moravian Conversations (1996), p 27) It is noteworthy that the Order for the Burial of the Dead includes a prayer for the repose of the faithful departed, borrowed from the Book of Common Prayer.The Moravian Liturgy (1960), p 93 Special Seasons The Moravian Church observes the seasons of the church year and the 1960 Liturgy includes services for Christmas, Good Friday, Easter, Whitsuntide and Trinity Sunday. Passion Week is of particular importance. On Palm Sunday the Hosanna Anthem, written by Christian Gregor in 1783, is sung in antiphonal form by males and females. This service begins a week of meetings for readings from the ‚ÄòPassion Week and Eastertide‚Äô booklet, which contains a harmony of narrative drawn from all the gospels. On Thursday there is a service of holy communion. The Good Friday Liturgy includes readings from the booklet and singing of hymn verses. The Easter Liturgy, which in the old settlements of the church takes place in the burial grounds early in the morning of Easter Sunday, celebrates the Resurrection of Christ and prays for unbroken fellowship with the faithful departed; and ends in church with a service of holy communion with the Risen Lord.Linyard and Tovey (1994), pp 10‚Äì11 Christmas is also important to Moravians, who place a special emphasis on the humanity of the Incarnate God.Freeman (1998), pp 101‚Äì5 The Hosanna Anthem is sung on Advent Sunday. Closer to Christmas, a Christingle service is held. Now common in many denominations, this service was first held in the Moravian church at Marienborn in Germany in 1747. Each child was presented with a candle decorated with red ribbon to remind them of the birth of Christ ‚Äòwho has kindled in each heart a flame‚Äô. Nowadays the candle is presented on an orange decorated with frills and sweets to symbolize Christ as the Light of the World. By the light of the candles, the congregation sings Hymn 45, ‚ÄòMorning Star, O cheering sight‚Äô.Linyard and Tovey (1994), p 10 Liturgical revision ‚ÄòAlternative Orders of Worship‚Äô were produced in 1987. These include an Order that integrates the ministry of the Word and Sacrament for holy communion, and a revised First Order which modernizes the language of the ancient litany. The Provincial authorities continue to work on revising both Liturgy and Hymn Book.Linyard and Tovey (1994), p 7 Hymns The oldest hymn in the Moravian Hymn Book (1960) celebrates the unity and glory of the church: it is number 356, ‚ÄòCome, let us all with gladness raise / A joyous song of thanks and praise‚Äô and is a translation of one originally written for the Synod of Lhota in 1467, at which the Bohemian Brethren decided to establish their own priesthood. Spirit of the Moravian Church An account of the ethos of the Moravian Church is given by one of its British Bishops, C H Shawe. In a lecture series delivered at the Moravian Theological Seminary in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, Shawe described the Spirit of the Moravian Church as having five characteristics. These are simplicity, happiness, unintrusiveness, fellowship and the ideal of service. Simplicity is a focus on the essentials of faith and a lack of interest in the niceties of doctrinal definition. Shawe quotes Zinzendorf's remark that 'The Apostles say: \\"We believe we have salvation through the grace of Jesus Christ ....\\" If I can only teach a person that catechism I have made him a divinity scholar for all time'.Shawe (1977), p 9 From this simplicity flow secondary qualities of genuineness and practicality. Happiness is the natural and spontaneous response to God's free and gracious gift of salvation. Again Shawe quotes Zinzendorf: 'There is a difference between a genuine Pietist and a genuine Moravian. The Pietist has his sin in the foreground and looks at the wounds of Jesus; the Moravian has the wounds in the forefront and looks from them upon his sin. The Pietist in his timidity is comforted by the wounds; the Moravian in his happiness is shamed by his sin'.Shawe (1977), p 13 Unintrusiveness is based on the Moravian belief that God positively wills the existence of a variety of churches to cater for different spiritual needs. There is no need to win converts from other churches. The source of Christian unity is not legal form but everyone's heart-relationship with the Saviour. Fellowship is based on this heart- relationship. Shawe says: 'The Moravian ideal has been to gather together kindred hearts ... Where there are \\"Christian hearts in love united\\", there fellowship is possible in spite of differences of intellect and intelligence, of thought, opinion, taste and outlook. ... [In Zinzendorf's time] Fellowship meant not only a bridging of theological differences but also of social differences; the artisan and aristocrat were brought together as brothers and sat as equal members on the same committee'.Shawe (1977), pp 21,22 The ideal of service entails happily having the attitude of a servant.

Location Mankiala is located 36 km southeast of Islamabad, near the Rawat Fort.Islamabad Tourist Treasures, Government of Pakistan, Islamabad Pg 1 It is situated along the Kallar Syedan Road. Etymology The town is said to be named after Raja Man or Manik, who is said to have built the village's stupa during the Buddhist era. The village is said to have been previously known as Manikpur or Maniknagar, and was capital of the ancient Hindu Rakshasas. However, archaeological evidence does not support the conclusion that Manikpur was the capital of the Rakshasas, and that the village's ruins were built during the Buddhist-era. Background Mankiala Stupa is a Gandhara era stupa built in the nearby village of Tope Mankiala to memorialize the place where, according to legend, an earlier incarnation of Buddha sacrificed some of his body parts or his entire body to feed seven hungry tiger cubs.Golden Light Sutra 18. History The stupa in 1897. Mankiala dates from the Gandharan era, around 2000 years ago. The village had been previously described as the former grand capital of the mythological Rakshasas, though no archaeological evidence supports the theory of Mankiala serving as an ancient Hindu capital, and instead suggests that the area's ruins date from the Buddhist period. The settlement during the Buddhist era may have consisted of approximately 2,000 homes, interspersed with monasteries and 15 stupas. The archaeological site is believed to be on the same hillock where the modern village now stands. Mankiala's stupa was built in the reign of Kanishka (128-151 CE). The ancient settlement is believed to have been destroyed by fire, though there is no indication that it was purposely destroyed. Mountstuart Elphinstone, the first British emissary to Afghanistan chanced upon this stupa in 1808 AD and penned a detailed account in his memoir 'Kingdom of Caubul' (1815). According to an inscription on a stone the stupa was restored in 1891 by a regiment of the British Indian Army. Raja Usman was architect. Relics from stupa Mankiala stupa's relic deposits were all removed from the site during British colonial rule, and are all now housed in the British Museum, were found by Jean- Baptiste Ventura in 1830 between 10 and 20 metres below the top of the dome. They were at one stage owned by the celebrated antiquarian James Prinsep.The British Museum Collection The mouth of the stupa has a gaping hole as a result of excavations by relic hunters in the past. It now has a barrier around it for safety reasons. Transportation  Road Mankiala is located along the Kallar Syedan Road, which connects the city to Kallar Syedan, and the N-5 National Highway that provides access to Islamabad and Rawalpindi.

History Origins In the early 1970s, anti-war activists in Minneapolis and St Paul had founded more than two dozen natural food co- operatives, which were owned and operated almost entirely by volunteer members. Former co-op members Craig Cox (author of Storefront Revolution: Food Co-ops and the Counter Culture) and David Gutknecht (founder and longtime editor of the magazine Cooperative Grocer) describe the growth of food co-ops as an attempt to enact ideals of mutual aid and other cooperative principles. Members of the hippie counter-culture and the anti-war movement in the Twin Cities were inspired by the desire to \\"feed the people\\" and perhaps by some knowledge of other food co-ops in the United States. Although the connections were mostly unexplored at the time, the food co-op movement can be traced in part back to both the Rochdale movement in England and the history of economic cooperation in the African American community (see Jessica Gordon Nembhard's book Collective Courage). Political differences arose between those who were influenced by the ideas of the counter-culture and anarchism, and more orthodox \\"communists.\\" The second group argued that the co-operatives should sell processed food products, white sugar, and canned goods. They argued that selling cheaper goods would make co-ops more accessible to the working class, and would allow them to better deliver a message of revolution to those they felt were most in need of it. Other co-op members argued that part of furthering their ideals was selling better-quality food than was typically sold in grocery stores at the time. By the mid-70s, some of those calling themselves communists had formed a group known as the Cooperative Organization, or C.O. The group had developed through secretive study groups. They argued that the \\"middle-class hippies\\" pushing for organic food in co-op stores did not understand the plight of the working class, and that the co-op community was too disorganized and dominated by middle-class elites to lead the sustained struggle against racism, capitalism, and imperialism that the C.O. felt was necessary. The group had members in many of the co-ops around town, and their membership was strongest at the People's Warehouse (a distributor servicing many of the cooperatively-run businesses in the Twin CIties) and at the Beanery. The co-op wars (1975-1976) In late 1975, the C.O. took over the People's Warehouse. Firstly the C.O. attempted to negotiate control at a board meeting. When this failed they walked into the financial offices at the Warehouse and grabbed the checkbook and financial records. Other co-op members attempted to negotiate with the C.O. and were met with violence. Co-op member Phill Baker, who was part of the board meeting, described C.O. members attacking them with iron bars and ripping the phones from the walls. The next morning the C.O. announced, \\"The People's Warehouse now belongs to the people!\\" After this meeting there was a clear divide between the two sides. The C.O. used various tactics to take control of other co-ops, including further violence. On January 9, 1976, C.O. members entered the Seward Cooop (called this because the store was not yet legally defined as a co-op) and attacked worker-owners Kris Olsen and Leo Cashman, beating them and throwing them out of the store. (For more on the history of what is now known as Seward Community Co-op, see Growing with Purpose: Forty Years of Seward Community Cooperative,' written by Kari Cornell and Patricia Cumbie.) Such actions appalled many in the co-op community, who organized a boycott of C.O.-run businesses. A non-C.O. distribution warehouse was set up called DANCE. The C.O.'s leader Theophilus Smith criticized Black Panther Mo Burton and used bullying tactics. This led Burton's supporters to physically retaliate. These events led to a decline of the C.O., as the People's Warehouse and other businesses reverted to non-C.O. control. After the co- op wars (late 1970s-present) Though they had suffered a defeat in the co-op wars, the C.O. persisted into the late '70s and early '80s. Now known simply as \\"The O,\\" they became a highly secretive group of about 30 members (down from around 300-1000 in their heyday). Members were known by code names and organized in disconnected cells in order to throw off the FBI, and were expected to unquestioningly follow directives from elusive leader, Theophilus (Theo) Smith. These directives did not only concern political actions, but personal lives as well - former member Alexandra Stein, author of Inside Out: A Memoir of Entering and Breaking Out of a Minneapolis Political Cult) has described being ordered to enter into a \\"P.R.\\" (personal relationship) with one of her follow O members, with the aim of getting pregnant. It is unknown whether remnants of the O still survive, due to its policy of near-total secrecy. Members were not allowed to talk to non-members, and were given very limited information about others in the organization. Stein mentions ten people in her social circle who left the O in 1991; presumably it still existed at that time. Characteristics The group was characterized by an extreme form of secrecy. Members used code names, and instructions were communicated by memos. The secrecy was such that many members had never met, or could not even name, group leader Theophilus (Theo) Smith. Some members were under the impression that the group was related to the Black Panthers or the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, or was part of a nationwide group. At one point members received no orders for a year, with no explanation given at the time or afterwards. During that year Smith was in jail in Chicago, serving time for manslaughter in the killing of a popular black DJ who had been living in one of the properties Smith owned in North Minneapolis. Sociology professor and specialist on cults Janja Lalich stated that the O, \\"with its clandestine structure, charismatic leader and all-controlling environment\\", was a cult. However some former members have disagreed. Former member Bob Malles described being in the O as a \\"bizarre and painful experience\\". However he describes it not as a cult, but as a failed social experiment that \\"blew up in the lab, so to speak, flinging the research staff far and wide.\\" See also * Seward Community Cafe References Category:Food cooperatives in the United States Category:Communism in the United States Category:Organizations established in 1974 Category:Defunct Maoist organizations in the United States Category:Counterculture Category:1974 establishments in Minnesota ","title":"The O (political group)"},{"id":"13036189","text":"Lagan is the second largest locality situated in Ljungby Municipality, Kronoberg County, Sweden, with 1,744 inhabitants in 2010.

Du Puy surrendered on December 22, 1375, and was handed over to Hawkwood's custody on the day after Christmas, only to be escourted to Cesena as prisoner where he was left in the custody of Galeotto I Malatesta, the lord of Rimini.Caferro, 2006, pp. 179-180.

Hutchinson (eds.), Plato, Complete works, Indianapolis: Hackett, 1997, pp. 1707-8. Contents It is a dialogue between Socrates and Sisyphus. Sisyphus believes that deliberation allows one to find the best course of action, but Socrates is puzzled by what deliberation is, and why it is supposed to be different from guesswork. By the end of the dialogue, it becomes clear that Sisyphus does not know what deliberation is. The dialogue seems to engage with an idea of good deliberation (euboulia) for which Isocrates was a noted exponent.Carl Werner M√ºller, Die Kurzdialoge der Appendix Platonica, Munich: Wilhelm Fink, 1975, pp. 79-82. The author uses the term dialegesthaiPseudo-Plato, Sisyphus, 338d8, 390b6 in an un-Platonic fashion to refer, not to dialectic, but to what Plato considered eristic.M√ºller 1975, p. 104 Dating argues that the Sisyphus can be dated securely to the middle third of the fourth century BC, and, assuming that the reference to \\"Callistratus\\"Pseudo-Plato, Sisyphus, 388c is to Callistratus of Aphidnae, to the period between Callistratus' death sentence in 361 and his execution (by 350), when no one needed to ask \\"Who is Callistratus?\\" but Callistratus' constantly changing location in exile made \\"Where is Callistratus?\\" a real question.M√ºller 1975, p. 103 Francesco Aronadio also dates the work to Plato's lifetime and places it within the circle of the Academy.John M.

The station is licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to broadcast on 102.3 FM with an effective radiated power (ERP) of 6 kW. The station's studios are located in downtown Louisville and the transmitter site is blocks away atop The 800 Apartments building. Station history 102.3 FM signed on as WLRS in 1964 as a stand-alone FM station for Louisville Radio School (hence the call-letters for the station). The station was used as a training ground for the school's broadcast students in its early years. In the late 1960s, station owner Clarence Henson entered into an agreement to sell WLRS to crosstown AM Top 40 WAKY, but the deal fell apart when WAKY did not meet the six-month deadline to complete the transaction. By 1970, WLRS was noted as being one of only nine stand-alone FMs in the state of Kentucky. WLRS went to first place in the Arbitron ratings in 1978. By that time, the station was Album Rock, a format that the station had adopted for many years. However, by 1981, WLRS was beaten by rival Album Rock station WQMF in the ratings, and in 1984, the station switched to a Top 40/AOR format or CHR for short as \\"The Flamethrowing LRS 102\\". The station was adding pop and urban artists like Michael Jackson and Whitney Houston to its playlist (while still leaning toward Rock), to fill the void left when WKJJ abandoned Top 40 for Adult Contemporary in 1982 and WJYL dropped Top 40 for urban contemporary in 1984. Eventually, WKJJ switched back to CHR as WDJX, and both WLRS and WDJX (which leaned more toward R&B; and dance) battled each other for the next few years before WLRS evolved back to their Album Rock format in the late 1980s, because, at that time, LRS' ratings were poor.

Local Board and Urban District In 1868 the township of Stretford adopted the Local Government Act 1858, and a local board was formed to govern the town. In 1889 the district became part of the administrative county of Lancashire. The Local Government Act 1894 reconstituted the local board's area as Stretford Urban District. An urban district council of eighteen members replaced the local board. The urban district was divided into six wards, each returning three councillors: Clifford, Cornbrook, Longford, Stretford, Talbot and Trafford. In 1933 the urban district was enlarged when the Davyhulme area was added on the abolition of the neighbouring Barton upon Irwell Rural District by a county review order. Municipal borough In 1933 the urban district was granted a charter of incorporation and Stretford became a municipal borough. The charter was formally presented by the Earl of Derby, Lord Lieutenant of Lancashire at a Charter Day celebration held on 16 September. At the same time the Earl officially opened the Town Hall. Political control The borough council consisted of a mayor, eight aldermen and twenty-four councillors. The charter mayor was Sir Thomas Robinson, who had been Member of Parliament for the Stretford constituency until 1931. One third of the councillors were elected annually, while half of the aldermen were chosen by the council every three years. The Conservative Party controlled the borough from 1933 to 1945. From 1945 to 1947 the council was under no overall control. The Conservatives regained control in 1947 and held it until 1962.The Times, November 3, 1947, p.6; May 11, 1962, p.10 After two years with no party in a majority, the Labour and Conservative parties alternated in power for the last ten years of the borough's existence: Labour had a majority from 1964 to 1967, Conservatives 1967 to 1972 and Labour from 1972 to 1974.The Times, May 8, 1964, p.10; May 12, 1967, p.3; May 6, 1972 Coat of arms On 20 February 1933, Stretford Urban District Council was granted armorial bearings by the College of Arms.Geoffrey Briggs, Civic and corporate Heraldry: A Dictionary of Impersonal Arms of England, Wales & N. Ireland, London, 1971 The arms continued in use when the borough was incorporated. The arms were blazoned as follows: The lion in the centre of the shield represented John of Gaunt, while the red roses were the county emblems for Lancashire. The \\"lymphad\\" or ancient ship at the base of the arms indicated that the area had maritime connections via the Rivers Mersey and Irwell. The arms were completed by a crossed flail and scythe. The scythe was emblematic of the agricultural past of the area, while the flail came from the arms of the Trafford family. The crest on the helm above the shield was an arm grasping a golden thunderbolt, symbolising the modern industries of Stretford. The design was completed by a coronet of Lancastrian roses. Abolition The borough was abolished by the Local Government Act 1972, and its former area transferred to the new county of Greater Manchester in 1974, to form part of the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford.

From 1922 until 1928, he was a resistance leader seeking to resist laws and changes introduced by the British.  Early life  Haji Abdul Rahman bin Haji Abdul Hamid was born in Telemong, Terengganu. He was much respected and loved by Malay society. Prior to the British arrival, Terengganu had Islam-based rules and administrations. The society freely opened up their land for farming and collecting crops.  British occupation  When the British came, new laws about the ways to open up land were introduced. One of them involves paying a tax to the government before using it. This new law made it difficult for everyone, especially poor farmers. To make things worse, the permission letters and passes from the government for opening up lands were also introduced. Despite the laws being introduced by the British, Haji Abdul Rahman Limbong fought to protect the livelihood and means of survival of farmers, claiming that land only belongs to Allah, and eventually to those who work on them. In 1922, Haji Abdul Rahman Limbong represented one of the 43 farmers being put to trial in a court for doing farming without permission. In numerous hearings that followed, no results had been given. In 1925, about 300 to 500 farmers cleared Tengku Haji Nik's land without permission from the government.  Insurgency  In 1928, following a series of restrictions and crackdowns by the British, Haji Abdul Rahman Limbong assembled about 1,000 people in Kampung Buluh, to launch their resistance to get the British out of their state. They attacked the police station in Kuala Berang, and conquered it,http://web5.bernama.com/events/merdeka50/newsbm.php?id=260861. Retrieved 1 September 2008. raising a red flag in its place. After the successful attack, they moved on to Kuala Terengganu, to persuade the Sultan to endorse their actions. Meanwhile, another group of resistance fighters was formed at Kampung Pelam, Telemong. The British representative sent a police from the state's capital to Kuala Berang to get aid from the Federated Malay States. As the resistance forces approached Padang Kachong, Kuala Telemong, the police defended against the resistance. Most of the resistance fighters died in the battle, and finally, the resistance retreated.  Aftermath and final years  All of the leaders involved in the insurgency of Terengganu citizenry had been found and put on trial. The majority of them were sentenced to lifelong imprisonment. Haji Abdul Rahman Limbong, who was one of them was found guilty, but was not sentenced like most of his leaders. Instead, he was exiled from Terengganu to Mecca, where he continued to teach Islam, until his death in 1929.

With a membership of over 150,000 and 110 staff BASC is the largest and best resourced field sports organisation in the UK. Its magazine Shooting and Conservation had an average circulation of around 135,000 in 2017. Sporting shooting includes wildfowling, game, and rough shooting, deer stalking, target shooting and air gunning, pigeon shooting and pest control, gundogs and promoting practical habitat conservation. BASC is also involved in the political representation of shooting ‚Äì training and the setting of standards in shooting sports and the association undertakes research in its area of interest. History WAGBI BASC began as the Wildfowlers Association of Great Britain and Ireland, (WAGBI) founded by Stanley Duncan, an engineer and gun shop owner from Hull, in 1908. Duncan was a wildfowler and naturalist who feared for the future of wildfowling which was under threat from attempts to control the foreshore. He was also concerned to protect coastal habitats to preserve wildfowl and defend shooting from \\"protectionist extremists\\" wishing to ban the sport. The first president was Sir Ralph Payne-Gallwey, a notable Edwardian shot and author of several books on shooting. Duncan remained the secretary of WAGBI until 1946. Duncan was also a member of the Zoological Society. For his fowling expeditions Duncan stayed at the Black Hut on Patrington Haven on the Humber. The first WAGBI meeting was held in an hotel in Hull. The Black hut was allegedly washed away by a big tide in 1969 but was more likely destroyed by a digger clearing the site. WAGBI nearly died due to the losses sustained by its members during the world wars. By 1953 the association was in sufficiently good shape to mount a formidable defence of wildfowling against the Protection of Birds Bill which threatened to impose restrictive controls on the sport. WAGBI‚Äôs lobbying resulted in legislation that was far more balanced and which was dubbed by the sports' opponents as \\"The Wildfowlers‚Äô Charter\\". Following this, WAGBI appointed its first full- time director, a former naval officer and Liverpool businessman, Commander John Anderton, who summed up his agenda as \\"doing one‚Äôs best for something one likes ‚Äì backed by the conviction that what one is doing is right.\\" Under Anderton WAGBI focused its efforts on raising standards among wildfowlers and establishing a network of wildfowling clubs to preserve local shooting and maintain records of wildfowl populations. In 1975 the Gamekeepers Association merged with WAGBI and in 1977, the association was a founding member of FACE the federation for shooting sports in the European Union. BASC In addition, shooting had become more open with individuals pursuing several forms of the sport. The change of name to the British Association for Shooting and Conservation (BASC) was agreed at the Annual General Meeting in 1981 in recognition that shooting sports required a single representative body and that WAGBI was the most suitably placed organisation to take on the role. Modern day BASC is a representative body for shooting sports and is a registered society under the Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies Act 2014. Each member has one share in the association. BASC is governed by a council elected from the members. The council is advised by a series of committees for Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, game shooting, deer stalking and wildfowling. Marford Mill, the association‚Äôs headquarters was acquired in 1976. The property is a former water mill at Rossett, in Wrexham. Among the collections held by BASC at the headquarters are firearms such as Irish Tom, a punt gun of unusual length and bore and Col. Peter Hawker's double punt gun. The association has country offices in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland as well as four English regional directors and their staff based in the North, Central, the South East and the South West. While the main purpose of the association is the protection and promotion of country shooting and its associated conservation activities, BASC also runs the wildfowling permit scheme, deer stalking schemes and the Goshooting initiative which links those looking for a shooting opportunity with those providing them. Members also receive the benefit of advice from BASC's expert staff on issues involving shooting and firearms certification and licensing, land management and gamekeeping. Other projects include Green Shoots, which links members to local biodiversity plans; Young Shots, which seeks to educate young people about field sports; and Taste of Game which promotes game meat. BASC is a signatory to the Code of Good Shooting Practice and produces a series of codes of practice on aspects of shooting. In politics BASC operates on an all-party basis and they ensured that shooting was not damaged by the Hunting Act 2004, preserved the legal right for young people to continue to go shooting with airguns, where they have the permission of the landowner, and secured an exemption from the ban on the cosmetic docking of dogs tails for working gundogs. The patron of the association is Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, who has held the office since 1967.Richard Ali succeeded John Swift as chief executive of the association in 2013, a position he held until March 2017, when the association announced his dismissal due to gross misconduct. BASC has announced that Ian Bell took over as chief executive in February 2018. In February 2020, BASC, alongside eight other shooting and rural organisations, announced a voluntary five-year transition away from lead shot and single-use plastics for live quarry shooting. The statement claimed significant recent advances in technology has enabled the transition to take place. Despite this, in June 2020 BASC strongly opposed EU legislation to restrict the use of lead shot around wetlands.

Hortus third: A concise dictionary of plants cultivated in the United States and Canada. Macmillan, New York. is a spiny and woody shrub producing wild almonds, native to the deserts of Arizona, California, Baja California, Nevada and Utah.Biota of North America Program 2014 county distribution mapSEINet, Southwestern Biodiversity, Arizona chapter photos, distribution mapCalflora taxon report, University of California, Prunus fasciculata (Torrey) A. Gray, 1874. Desert almond Prunus fasciculata lives many years (is perennial), and drops its leaves (deciduous). It prefers sandy or rocky soil on dry slopes and washes, usually below elevation. Description Prunus fasciculata grows up to high, exceptionally to , with many horizontal (divaricate) branches, generally with thorns (spinescent), often in thickets. The bark is grey and without hairs (glabrous). fascicles. Branches with smooth grey bark bear clusters of narrow leaves and small flowers. The leaves are long, narrow (linear), with a broad, flatten tip that tapers to a narrow base, (spatulate, oblanceolate), arranged on very short leaf stem (petiole) like bundles of needles (fascicles). Sepals are hairless and without lobes or teeth. The flowers are small and white with 3-mm petals, occurring either solitary or in fascicles and are without a petal stem (subsessile) growing from the leaf axils. They are dioecious. Male flowers have 10-15 stamens; female, one or more pistils. The plant displays numerous fragrant flowers from March to May, which attract the bees that pollinate it. The drupe is about 1 cm long, ovoid, light brown and pubescent with thin flesh.  Uses  The plant is not cultivated. Some Native Americans in its limited range learned traditional ways of using it: the Cahuilla prepared the drupe as a delicacy. The wild almonds were considered a delicacy by Native Americans. The Kawaiisu found the tough twigs useful as drills in starting fires and as the front portion of arrow shafts. The seed contains too much cyanide to be edible, but see under Paleobotanical evidence below. Classification The plant was first classified as Emplectocladus fasciculata in an 1853 paper by John Torrey based on a collection of the plants of California acquired during the third expedition of John C. Fremont in 1845;This famous expedition combined scientific and military operations, merging into the war with Mexico of 1848 and the acquisition of California for the United States. Fremont's mandate had been to explore Oregon. He followed secret orders to establish a presence in California. Apparently he did accomplish both scientific and military objectives (but not in Oregon) and the pre-publication in Torrey's paper of his remaining plant specimens (some had been lost on the Missouri) helped him during his later prosecutions for insubordination. whence the synonym Emplectocladus fasciculata (Torr.) The contents of this volume are stated in The paper, however, had already been published independently in April, 1853, according to The work was illustrated by Isaac Sprague. Torrey devised the genus Empectocladus to comprise a few desert shrubs. According to Silas C. Mason the genus has :\\"... a top so densely branched, angled and interlocked as to well merit the name Emplectocladus (Greek, \\"woven branch\\"), signifying interlocked branches ....\\" According to George Bentham and Joseph Dalton Hooker the name fasciculata means that the leaves are in fascicles, or little bundles: :\\"Leaves small, spatulate, as it were of precious stones, subglobose fasciculate\\"\\"Folia minuta, spathulata, e gemmis subglobosis quasi fasciculata ....\\" However, Asa Gray publishing in 1874 reclassified Empectocladus to Prunus resulting in the designation Prunus fasciculata (Torr.) A. Gray (subg. Emplectocladus), in which the desert shrubs become a subgenus. In 1996 Jepson defined a California variety with smooth leaves, punctata, in comparison to which Gray's species, with pubescent leaves, becomes the variety, fasciculata. Unfortunately, the binomial Prunus punctata was already used in 1878 to describe what is now known to be Prunus phaeosticta.The Flora of British India 2(5): 317. 1878. Prunus fasciculata punctata grows in the coastal ranges as well as in the desert.  Palaeobotanical evidence  Middens from rodent activities such as those of the Pack rat are a rich source of plant macrofossils from late Pleistocene habitats. At Point of Rocks in Nevada by 11700 BP desert shrubs such as Desert Almond had replaced Juniper and Joshua trees, indicating the onset of the modern desert. Somewhat earlier, 17000-14000 BP, Desert Almond flourished in a mixed desert and woodland ecology on the Colorado Plateau. The article is available as a .pdf file at . There is some archaeological evidence that the seeds were pounded into flour and leached to make it edible by the ancient population of the Mojave desert.

Mercenaries organised by mainly British financiers were arrested in Zimbabwe on 7 March 2004 before they could carry out the plot. Prosecutors alleged that Moto was to be installed as the new president in return for preferential oil rights to corporations affiliated to those involved with the coup. The incident received international media attention after the reported involvement of Sir Mark Thatcher in funding the coup, for which he was convicted and fined in South Africa. Summary On 7 March 2004 Zimbabwean police in Harare airport impounded a plane which flew in from South Africa. The alleged plot leader, ex-Special Air Service (SAS) officer Simon Mann, was arrested with two colleagues near the runway while waiting for arms to be loaded on a Boeing 727 (N4610), carrying three crew and 64 former soldiers recruited in South Africa. The majority of those alleged to have been the mercenaries planning to carry out the coup are based in South Africa and ex-members of the 32 Buffalo Battalion, a special force unit that fought for the South African apartheid regime. On 9 March 2004 Nick du Toit and 14 other South African and Angolan men were arrested in Equatorial Guinea on suspicion of being the mercenaries' vanguard.The marketing manager of Zimbabwe Defense Industries, Hope Mutize, said in court that Simon Mann had paid him a deposit of $180,000 (¬£100,000) in February 2004 and indirectly linked Mann to the alleged plot by saying he was accompanied by a South African, Nick du Toit, the leader of the 14 men arrested in Equatorial Guinea. Their arms requisition included 20 machine guns, 61 AK-47 assault rifles, 150 hand grenades, 10 rocket-propelled grenade launchers (and 100 RPG shells), and 75,000 rounds of ammunition. Mann said he wanted the rifles, mortars and ammunition to guard diamond mines in volatile parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo. It was alleged that those arrested in Zimbabwe made a stopover in Harare city to buy weapons and expected to join a team in Equatorial Guinea to overthrow President Obiang. Nick du Toit, the leader of those detained in Equatorial Guinea, testified at his trial in Equatorial Guinea that he was recruited by Simon Mann and that he was helping with recruitment, acquiring weapons and logistics. He testified he was told they were trying to install an exiled opposition politician, with Severo Moto as the new president. Prosecution and media evidence Simon Mann letter In a letter from prison on 31 March, Simon Mann told his wife, Amanda, and his legal team: > \\"Our situation is not good and it is very URGENT. It may be that getting us > out comes down to a large splodge of wonga! Of course investors did not > think this would happen. Did !? .... They [the lawyers] get no reply from > Smelly and Scratcher [who] asked them to ring back after the Grand Prix race > was over!......We need heavy influence of the sort that ... Smelly, > Scratcher ... David Hart and it needs to be used heavily and now. Once we > get into a real trial scenario we are fucked.\\" David Hart was ex-prime minister Margaret Thatcher's unofficial adviser during the miners' strike and served as special adviser to Michael Portillo and Malcolm Rifkind in subsequent Conservative administrations. \\"Scratcher\\" is thought to be Sir Mark Thatcher and \\"Smelly\\" Ely Calil. 'Wonga list' of the financial backers The names were allegedly on a so-called \\"Wonga List\\" by James Kershaw ‚Äì then 24-year-old, who was believed to have acted as Simon Mann's accountant. Kershaw is said to have been brought in by Nigel Morgan, a security consultant and former Irish Guards officer who had employed Kershaw as an IT expert and accountant at a diamond mine in the DR Congo operated by his then employer, MIBA. Morgan, a friend of Mann, refused to comment when asked whether he had been involved in the coup attempt, but was known for his connections to the South African Secret Service and was suspected of reporting on the plotters to the authorities. He may have installed Kershaw in the scheme to keep tabs on Mann and the other plotters. Kershaw entered a witness protection scheme after voluntarily surrendering to police on the advice of his lawyers. He was given 24-hour police protection because of assassination concerns. The list, said to have been handed over to South African police by Kershaw and other former colleagues of Mr Mann, who have turned state's evidence, has been seen by The Guardian. Johann Smith intelligence reports In December 2003 and January 2004 two separate highly detailed reports of the planned coup were sent to two senior officers in British intelligence and to Michael Westphal, then senior colleague of Donald Rumsfeld. The documents were from Johann Smith, a former commander in South African Special Forces and an internationally renowned security analyst who has been an occasional adviser to President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo. In a statement by Smith given to lawyers representing the government of Equatorial Guinea, he says he began hearing rumours of a coup in both Equatorial Guinea and Sao Tom√© in November 2003 from two ex-soldiers of the 32 Buffalo Battalion who told him they had been recruited for a coup by Nick du Toit: > Because I was continuing to work in Equatorial Guinea with government, it > was not in my interest that there be a coup d'etat.....'I therefore wanted > to warn the Equatorial Guinea authorities. I also considered it my duty to > warn the authorities in US and England because some of their nationals might > be killed. I submitted a report in December 2003 of what I had discovered to > Michael Westphal of the Pentagon (in Donald Rumsfeld's department). I > expected the US government to take steps to warn Equatorial Guinea or to > stop the coup. This was also my expectation as regard the British > government, which I warned through two SIS people I knew, and to whom I sent > the report by email, also in December 2003, to their personal email > addresses. The report named several major players arrested in March and now on trial for their involvement in the failed putsch. Smith said the group had hired two fishing trawlers to operate off the West African coast, despite the fact that all but one member of the group had no seagoing or fishing experience. The report concluded that the commercial fishing operation was a front for the movement of men and arms for a coup. The report also mentioned the group's connections with the Equatorial Guinea opposition leader Severo Moto and warned that any operation would pose a threat to stability in the region. Second report When Smith began to get more intelligence of the plot in January from his former military colleagues who were working for Nick du Toit's South African firm, he sent another report to the Pentagon and SIS marked strictly confidential: > 'After preparing and sending my December report I received further > information.... I put this in a second report, which I sent by email to the > same people as the first one: Michael Westphal of the US and to British SIS > contacts'. Documents seen by The Observer reveal that by the end of January, the Foreign Office was being told: > \\"According to the latest planning, Carlos Cardoso (ex-South African special > forces soldier) would, on his return, recruit a total of 75 ex-SADF [South > African Defence Force] members, mainly from within the former 32 Buffalo's > (battalions) and Special Forces ranks to launch simultaneous actions in STP > and EG. These actions are planned to take place in mid-March 2004 (The > alleged plotters were arrested on 7 March en route to Equatorial Guinea).... > Knowing the individuals as well as I do, this timeline is very realistic and > will provide for ample time to plan, mobile, equip and deploy the force.\\" Smith, who claims he has received death threats since the plot was thwarted, said there was no response from British or US authorities to his warnings: > The only thing that happened was that the US authorities froze the > Equatorial Guinea money with the Riggs Bank in USA. Network of support and financiers Sir Mark Thatcher, 2nd Baronet On 25 August 2004, Mark Thatcher, the son of the former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Margaret Thatcher, was arrested under anti-mercenary laws in South Africa after being accused of helping to finance the coup to remove President Obiang. Crause Steyl was one of the pilots picked to fly the key planners of the coup in a chartered King 200 twin turbo prop aircraft, registered ZS-NBJ, who later turned prosecution witness in South Africa.: > Crause Steyl: \\"I met Mark (Thatcher) three or four times. He was a partner > in the venture. He put in about $250,000. The money was wired to my company > account in various installments. The helicopters cost about $600 an hour > plus $5,000 each for the pilots and $10,000 a month for special insurance.\\" Thatcher has admitted putting money into Steyl's company, Triple A Aviation, but he has said it was to cover the cost of an air ambulance project. Steyl dismissed this explanation. \\"He knew what was going on,\\" he said. \\"I only knew him in the context of the Equatorial Guinea business. I didn't know him before and I haven't met him since.\\" On 13 October 2004 in London, a lawyer for the Equatorial Guinea government said that telephone records showed four calls between the homes of one of the alleged financiers behind the plot, Ely Calil, and Lord Archer in the run-up to the coup attempt in March. Another alleged plotter, Greg Wales, also made five calls to Sir Mark Thatcher in the days after the failed coup. On 13 January 2005, Mark Thatcher, in a South African court, pleaded guilty to helping finance a coup plot in Equatorial Guinea. South African police were able to prove that Mr Thatcher had transferred about US$285,000 to the mercenaries that were to execute the operation and had met and talked frequently to them prior to the coup attempt. After pleading guilty, he was given a four-year suspended sentence and a fine of about US$560,000. Ely Calil Ely Calil, the Chelsea-based Lebanese oil billionaire who is being sued in London by the Government of Equatorial Guinea, is alleged to have raised another $750,000. Mr Calil's solicitor said that he did not wish to respond to the claim that he had raised money for the plotters. But he denied any knowledge of the plot. Nigel Morgan, who is said to have interviewed Calil in the aftermath, claimed Calil offered to provide information about the plot to the South African government and betray the other plotters in exchange for staving off prosecution. David Tremain David Tremain, a South Africa-based British businessman, is alleged to have raised $500,000. Mr Tremain is alleged to have been \\"fronting\\" for a syndicate of South African and other minor investors. Tremain denies any involvement in the coup. Jeffrey Archer Bank details of Simon Mann's Guernsey firm, Logo Logistics, reveal that a JH Archer made a payment of $134,000 (¬£74,000) into his account in the days before the failed coup attempt. Lord Archer initially issued a statement through his lawyers stating that he had \\"no prior knowledge\\" of the alleged coup and that he had not spoken to Sir Mark for \\"approximately 10 years\\". In January, on the same day the plotters were meeting at Sandton in Johannesburg, Ely Calil called Lord Archer and the pair apparently spoke for 15 minutes. Other calls followed in the run-up to the coup attempt. A lawyer for the Equatorial Guinea government said in London that telephone records showed four calls between Ely Calil and Lord Archer in the run-up to the coup attempt in March. Severo Moto Prosecutors said Equatorial Guinea's opposition leader, Severo Moto, based in Spain, offered the group $1.8m and oil rights to overthrow the government. Tim Bell, Baron Bell Timothy Bell, Lady Thatcher's former spin doctor, is linked to the case by \\"advising\\" Mr Mann's friends. Baron Bell has said that as far as he was aware neither Sir Mark nor Mr Hart were involved in the alleged coup. Greg Wales / US administration President Obiang accused the US of backing the plot, but the Pentagon denies supporting it. US officials say it was Greg Wales who made all the approaches to them. Greg Wales, a London-based property dealer, is alleged to have raised $500,000. Equatorial Guinea official sources claim that in November 2003 wrong date?, when the plot was in its early stages, an Old Etonian mercenary, Simon Mann, paid Mr Wales about $8,000. Mr Wales denies any involvement in the coup. Theresa Whelan, a member of the Bush administration in charge of African affairs at the Pentagon, twice met a London-based businessman, Greg Wales, in Washington before the coup attempt. Mr Wales has been accused of being one of its organisers, but has denied any involvement. A US defence official told Newsweek magazine: > Mr Wales mentioned in passing [...] there might be some trouble brewing in > Equatorial Guinea. Specifically, he had heard from some business associates > of his that wealthy citizens of the country were planning to flee in case of > a crisis. UK prior knowledge Britain was given a full outline of the coup plot, including the dates, details of arms shipments and key players, months before the coup was launched. Until 9 November 2004, cabinet ministers had denied any prior knowledge of the attempted illegal coup. Jack Straw and minister for Africa Chris Mullin were however personally told of the plot on Friday, 30 January. After receiving news of the coup, Jack Straw ordered a change to evacuation plans for British citizens in Equatorial Guinea. President Obiang commented on the lack of warning despite admissions of prior knowledge: > This is particularly surprising in view of the fact that a number of British > citizens and residents of the UK appear to be central to the conspiracy to > overthrow the government of Equatorial Guinea. Jack Straw had told parliament that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office did investigate if there were any British companies involved in the plot after receiving confidential reports, but failed to find any evidence. British officials, and Jack Straw, were forced to apologise to The Observer after categorically denying they had prior knowledge of the coup plot.  Spain  President Obiang accused the Spanish government of supporting the plot. The allegation could explain the coincidental position of two Spanish warships off the coast of Equatorial Guinea, at the time of the arrests of the alleged plotters. Miguel Mifuno, special adviser to Equatorial Guinea's president, accused the Spanish government of funding opposition groups in exile and supporting the coup directly: > Our intelligence sources say that the warship was going to arrive on the > same date that the coup attempt was going to take place ‚Äì 8 March.....It > [the war ship] was already in our territorial waters with 500 soldiers > aboard. Meanwhile there was a team of foreign mercenaries already in > Equatorial Guinea who knew where we lived. They had plans to kill 50 people > and to arrest others. The Spanish foreign ministry spokeswoman denied the allegations; \\"There was no ship there, we deny any kind of implication in any attempted coup\\". However the Spanish foreign minister, Ana Palacio seemed to contradict the spokeswoman's statement; \\"They weren't on a mission of war, but one of cooperation.\\" See also *List of coups d'√©tat and coup attempts References Further reading  Pelton describes the inside story of the coup attempt and his efforts to get the coup plotters out of jail. *Blaisse, Mark 'Reconstitution du complot contre la Guin√©e-Equatoriale.

Another Big Step Pretty soon, they had another chance to work for the \\"‡∏ó‡πà‡∏≤‡∏°‡∏Å‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏á\\" Tam Glang (Among) project \\"Intro 2000\\", a various artists album from Genies Records which is a branch of GMM Grammy, the largest record label and entertainment company in Thailand. They were asked to sign with Genie Records afterwards. Since they did not have enough members to perform in the band, Ta had invited Saittaporn Kridakorn Na Ayadhaya (‡πÄ‡∏™‡∏£‡∏ê‡∏û‡∏£ ‡∏Å‡∏§‡∏î‡∏≤‡∏Å‡∏£ ‡∏ì ‡∏≠‡∏¢‡∏∏‡∏ò‡∏¢‡∏≤) or Joey, his relative who was also their temporary drummer, to officially become their full-time drummer.

Summer During 2000, their 2nd album, titled \\"Summer\\", was released.

Dance Ror Dor Dance (Military Dance) or ‡∏§‡∏î‡∏π‡∏£‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏ô Ru Du Ron (Summer) would big hits for the band. Paradox decided to break away from the indie world by releasing \\" ‡πÅ‡∏Ñ‡πâ‡∏ô‡∏ú‡∏µ‡∏ô‡∏£‡∏Å Khean Phee Na Rok (Hell Ghost Revenge) in 2000, after Summer had been released. Following their success with \\"Summer\\", \\"On The Beach\\", a special album was released. This album contained acoustic versions of the songs from both Lunatic Planet and Summer and 2 new special tracks, ‡∏î‡∏≤‡∏ß Dao (Stars) ‡∏™‡∏á‡∏™‡∏±‡∏¢ Song Sai (Curiosity), which also became one of their famous hit songs, especially ‡∏î‡∏≤‡∏ß Dao (Stars) which had been covered by many artists from time to time. Two years later, their 3rd album, \\"On The Rainbow\\", was released. This marked a change in Paradox's style as the band used a softer sound and more beautiful melodies, seen in songs such as ‡∏£‡∏∏‡πâ‡∏á Rung (Rainbow) and ‡πÄ‡∏®‡∏© Set (Pieces), a power ballad, or ‡πÑ‡∏ü Fai (Fire), a fast-paced song. Unfortunately, this album did not garner as much success as the previous album \\"Summer\\". First Concert Paradox had become one of the leading rock bands in Thailand, hosting their own first concert in 2003 by Fat Radio named Fat Live 4 : The Paradox Circus, the official full name of the concert. This concert was held at the Indoor Stadium Huamark on March 26, 2003. They also used this concert to promote their next album named \\"Free Style\\" by performing the first promotional single from this album \\"Sexy\\". Their 4th album Free Style also included a reworked version of ‡∏ô‡∏±‡∏Å‡∏°‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏≤‡∏Å‡∏• Nak Ma Ya Kol (The Magician), one of the hit songs from their 1st album Lunatic Planet. In that same year, Paradox joined the Little Rock Project, a special music project with other bands from the same record label, for instance Clash, ABNormal, Kala, to cover songs from Micro, a legendary Thai rock band, in \\"Rock Size S Concert in Freedom Sunday\\" at Impact Arena Mueang Thong Thani.

Plot Eight tells the story of the life of an eight-year-old soccer fan who has to come to terms with living in a strange new town and the loss of his father. Eight opens with a boy wearing what appears to be a homemade Liverpool F.C.-shirt standing on a beach with his football shouting \\"My name is Jonathan and I am eight!\\". Jonathan has no father, but says he was \\"a flower person who liked pots and world peas\\" (the knowing adult viewer appreciates this means flower power / hippie, pot (marijuana) and world peace). Jonathan's best friend is Terry, who is a Manchester United-supporter. Together they watch tapes of England in the 1998 FIFA World Cup at Terry's, since Jonathan's mum does not allow football in the house. Terry has a father that Jonathan think is \\"great\\". Jonathan has recently moved to an English coastal town. Before then he had lived in Liverpool, where his dad went regularly to the Kop. Jonathan's mum is fed up with her son's football fanaticism, and wants him to get a new hobby. Terry's father hits him when he gets angry. Terry wishes that he was Jonathan and had no father at all. Jonathan wonders what his dad's work was. He hopes that he was a train driver, a firefighter or maybe a pilot? Terry says he probably was a \\"stinky caretaker at a stinky school\\", Jonathan calls him a liar and they depart in anger. At home, alone with a football board game, Jonathan admits that he never knew his father, he died before he was born, at a football match he was watching, possibly referring to the Hillsborough disaster. The film ends with Jonathan sitting on the beach singing \\"You'll Never Walk Alone\\". Awards *Eight was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Short Film in 1999.

The satellite was designated to be used as an on-orbit, but was lost on launch failure. Satellite description The spacecraft was designed and manufactured by Lockheed Martin on the A2100AX satellite bus. It had a launch mass of and a 15-year design life. A near copy of JCSAT-3A, it was to be used as an on orbit spare. As most satellites based on the A2100 platform, it uses a LEROS-1C LAE for orbit raising. Its solar panels span when fully deployed and, with its antennas in fully extended configuration it is wide. Its payload is composed of eighteen 27 MHz and twelve 36 MHz Ku band plus twelve C band transponders, for a total bandwidth of 1,350 MHz. Its high power amplifiers had an output power of 127 Watts on Ku band and 48 Watts on C band. History On October 3, 2005, JSAT ordered an A2100AX based satellite from Lockheed Martin, JCSAT-11. It would be an almost copy of JCSAT-3A, with a C band and Ku band payload. It was expected to be launched in 2007 to act as a backup for the whole JSAT fleet. The almost 19-year streak of successful JCSAT launches was ended when a Proton-M/Briz-M failed to orbit JCSAT-11 on September 5, 2007. A damaged pyro firing cable on the interstage truss prevented the second stage from controlling its direction, and the rocket and its payload crashed into the Kazakhstan steppes. Being lucky in misfortune, JCSAT-11 was simply an on-orbit backup and thus it had no operational impact on the fleet. The same day of the launch failure, JSAT placed an order with Lockheed for an identical replacement, JCSAT-12, for launch in 2009. On September 19, 2007, they closed a deal with Arianespace for a launch slot with an Ariane 5 for its launch.

Founded in 1948, the club has won a record of 13 First Division titles, the last one being in the 2018‚Äì19 season. In 2000, when they won their tenth title, they became the first club to be awarded a Golden Star for Sport Excellence. The Club is popularly known by the Gozitans simply as il-Hotspurs, which literally means The Hotspurs. Early Days The Victoria Hotspurs Football Club was formed in December 1948 by Dr. Antoine Mercieca M.D. with the help of Mr. Gigi Xuereb and Mr. Alfred Attard. The Club‚Äôs original name was Victoria Hotspur, since its first Club President, Dr. Antoine Mercieca M.D., was a fervent supporter of Tottenham Hotspur, an English football club in London that competes in the Premier League. Nicknamed The Hospitals, Victoria Hotspur had its first premises in the old Gozo Hospital in St. Francis Square, Victoria. The first three matches were played with players wearing brand new white shirts borrowed from the Gozo Hospital. Later on, red shirts with white sleeves, together with white shorts, were bought from the sister island of Malta.

Since June 2016, the former grounds operate as the Peterhead Prison Museum. History Peterhead Convict Prison was built around 1888. It was designed to hold 208 prisoners and to be Scotland's only convict prison,Scraton, P., Sim, J. & Skidmore, P. (1991) Prisons Under Protest, Buckingham: Open University Press i.e for prisoners sentenced to ‚Äòhard labour‚Äô. Occupancy averaged at around 350 however, until peaking at 455 in 1911. Additional buildings were completed in 1909, 1960 and 1962, bringing capacity up to 362. According to the Scottish Prison Service, the prison could, in 2012, accommodate up to 142 prisoners.Peterhead Prison It closed in 2013, to be replaced by the new HMP Grampian, the first prison in Scotland to jointly house youths, men and women. The first inmates transferred on to site on 2 March 2014 having been temporarily housed at other sites and connected to family with virtual visits by videolink. Until the opening of Peterhead Convict Prison, Scots convicts were transported to England to serve their sentences. The first convicts were received in August 1888. Peterhead supplied the labour force to work in Stirlinghill Quarry and in the Admiralty Yard attached to the prison. These convicts supported the work of a civilian labour force employed by the Admiralty to construct the Harbour of Refuge breakwater. The Admiralty project was unique in Scotland as it was served by the only state-owned passenger-carrying railway in its day. On 28 September 1987, a riot in the prison's D wing resulted in prisoners taking over the building and taking a prison officer, 56-year-old Jackie Stuart, hostage. The rioters were serving life in prison for violent crimes. It was thought that they had nothing to lose and would not hesitate to make good on their threats to kill their hostage, whom they had taken up to the rafters. When negotiations broke down, thethen-Home Secretary, Douglas Hurd, dispatched the SAS to bring the riot to an end on 3 October. The operation was successful. The hostage was released unharmed and order in the prison was restored.

Wilhelm Reinhard Berger (9 August 1861 - 16 January 1911) was a German composer, pianist and conductor. Life Berger's father, originally a merchant from Bremen, worked in Boston (where Berger was born) as a music shopkeeper and made a name for himself as an author after the family had returned to Bremen in 1862. Early on, his son showed signs of musical interest and aptitude. By the time of his first concert, age fourteen, Wilhelm had already composed a large number of songs and works for the piano. Between 1878 and 1884, Berger studied at the Royal Conservatory in Berlin, under Ernst Rudorff (piano) and Friedrich Kiel (counterpoint). From 1888 to 1903, he was a teacher at the Klindworth-Scharwenka Conservatory, a function which he combined, from 1899, with the chief conductorship of the Berlin Musical Society. In addition, he was very active as a concert pianist. In 1903, Berger was made a member of the German Royal Academy of Arts, and in the same year he was appointed 'Hofkapellmeister' in Meiningen as successor of Fritz Steinbach. In 1911 he died at Jena, aged 49, due to complications after a stomach operation. Musical style Like most of the composers from the circle of the 'Berlin Academics', Berger developed a great mastery of music theory. Stylistically, his music is very close to that of Johannes Brahms, even though it almost hints at the later works of Max Reger (who was to become Berger's successor as Meiningen Kapellmeister) through its preference for dissonant harmony and counterpoint techniques. Berger was a prolific composer - his oeuvre numbers well over a hundred works. The Piano Quintet, Op. 95, the Second Symphony and the late compositions for choir are generally considered to be his masterpieces. Long after his death, his work was rated very highly, particularly among musical conservatives. Wilhelm Altmann wrote very positively about Berger in the third volume of his influential Manual for String Quartet Players (Handbuch f√ºr Streichquartettspieler).

The Library at the Royal Castle is a large building adjacent to the Royal Castle in Warsaw, Poland. It was built between 1779 and 1783 according to design of Dominik Merlini and Jan Chrystian Kamsetzer in order to accommodate the royal collection of books belonging to King Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski, the last King of sovereign Poland. The Library is an elongated building of total dimensions 56 x 9 m, with 15 windows along the entrance hall, and a terrace at the top. The library initially held about 7,500 items, which grew to about 20,000 volumes in 1795. After the King's death in 1798 the whole collection was sold to Tadeusz Czacki, who bequeathed it to the Liceum Krzemienieckie. Following the collapse of the 1830 November Uprising against the Russian occupation, by order of Tsar Nicholas I of Russia, the library was seized and transported to Kiev where it formed the brand new University Library.Agnieszka Kania, Monika Bryzek, Library of Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski. Wirtualna Historia KsiƒÖ≈ºki i Bibliotek, Krak√≥w 2006 The library holdings The main reason for founding a library at the Palace, was one of Stanislaus Augustus desire to meet the needs of Polish intellectuals, as well as, the creation of workshops for scientists developing political and economic reforms. The purchase of books from collectors included private libraries of Giuliani, Jan Beniamin Steinhauser, Mateusz Czarnek, Pawe≈Ç Czempi≈Ñski and Kajetan Ghigiottim. Some of the main suppliers were Warsaw booksellers: Piotr Dufour, Jan August Poser, J√≥zef Lex, Micha≈Ç Groell, and Korn√≥w company of Wroc≈Çaw, but also the Paris warehouse of Saint Len and Jan Franciszek Sellon, and the selected British booksellers. The King often personally directed the purchases and awarded his suppliers with the \\"Merentibus\\" gold medal for their efforts including the Parisian bookseller P.P. Piernes. The collections were divided into departments, including the Philosophy department represented by numerous works of ancient philosophers such as Socrates, Plato, Seneca, and Lucretius; modern (Erasmus, Francis Bacon, Michael Montaigne), mathematicians (Blaise Pascal, and Descartes); French philosophers of the Enlightenment and the Encyclopedists: Jean le Rond d'Alembert, Voltaire, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. The Fiction department was represented by many works belonging to the classical world, among them: Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, Comedies of Aristophanes, Ovid's Metamorphoses, Lodovico Ariosto's Mad Orland, Cyd by Pierre Corneille, Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes, Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe and many others, including the Complete Works of William Shakespeare, in 10 volumes; and the Collected works of Nicholas Boileau, in 5 volumes. The Palace complex including Library were utterly devastated by Nazi Germans during World War II. In 1945 it didn't even have a roof, which was reconstructed in the following years. Until 1989 during the Communist rule, the complex served as government offices and archives. After the collapse of the Soviet Empire the Palace and the Library buildings were made into a museum incorporated as part of the Warsaw Royal Castle. It went through further restoration between 2004‚Äì2008 and at present, its spacious rooms serve as convention and exhibition pavilions.S≈Çawomir Kosim, Jagoda Pietryszyn, Historia pa≈Çacu Pod BlachƒÖ.

The bright rainbow pattern is the result of thin-film interference. Miscibility is the property of two substances to mix in all proportions (that is, to fully dissolve in each other at any concentration), forming a homogeneous solution. The term is most often applied to liquids but also applies to solids and gases. For example, water and ethanol are miscible because they mix in all proportions. By contrast, substances are said to be immiscible if there are certain proportions in which the mixture does not form a solution. For one example, oil is not soluble in water, so these two solvents are immiscible. As another example, butanone (methyl ethyl ketone) is significantly soluble in water, but these two solvents are also immiscible because they are not soluble in all proportions.  Organic compounds  In organic compounds, the weight percent of hydrocarbon chain often determines the compound's miscibility with water. For example, among the alcohols, ethanol has two carbon atoms and is miscible with water, whereas 1-butanol with four carbons is not. Octanol, with eight carbons, is practically insoluble in water, and its immiscibility leads it to be used as a standard for partition equilibria. The straight-chain carboxylic acids up to butanoic acid (with four carbon atoms) are miscible with water, pentanoic acid (with five carbons) is partly soluble, and hexanoic acid (with six) is practically insoluble, as are longer fatty acids and other lipids; the very long carbon chains of lipids cause them almost always to be immiscible with water. Analogous situations occur for other functional groups such as aldehydes and ketones.  Metals  Immiscible metals are unable to form alloys with each other. Typically, a mixture will be possible in the molten state, but upon freezing, the metals separate into layers. This property allows solid precipitates to be formed by rapidly freezing a molten mixture of immiscible metals. One example of immiscibility in metals is copper and cobalt, where rapid freezing to form solid precipitates has been used to create granular GMR materials. There also exist metals that are immiscible in the liquid state. One with industrial importance is that liquid zinc and liquid silver are immiscible in liquid lead, while silver is miscible in zinc. This leads to the Parkes process, an example of liquid-liquid extraction, whereby lead containing any amount of silver is melted with zinc. The silver migrates to the zinc, which is skimmed off the top of the two-phase liquid, and the zinc is then boiled away, leaving nearly pure silver.  Effect of entropy  If a mixture of polymers has lower configurational entropy than the components, they are likely to be immiscible in one another even in the liquid state.  Determination  Miscibility of two materials is often determined optically. When the two miscible liquids are combined, the resulting liquid is clear. If the mixture is cloudy the two materials are immiscible. Care must be taken with this determination. If the indices of refraction of the two materials are similar, an immiscible mixture may be clear and give an incorrect determination that the two liquids are miscible.

It was first held in 1884, but has had various interruptions due to cotton crop failure, the Great Depression era, World War I & World War II years & the COVID-19 pandemic. From 1946 to 2019 and resuming in 2021, the fair has been held annually. It was a territory fair before Arizona was a state. The Arizona Exposition and State Fair (official name) is a self- supporting state agency, and receives no money from the state's General Fund. The fairgrounds serve as a host facility for a number of different tradeshows, events, and entertainment. The fairgrounds is the location for the Maricopa County Fair, the Arizona National Livestock Show, the Maricopa Home and Garden Show, and more. The Fair typically has around 75 amusement rides, 110 food booths, and 300 commercial sales booths. The Arizona State Fair is one of the top 5 state fairs by yearly attendance in the country, drawing over a million visitors annually. History 1884‚Äî1891 The origins of the Arizona State fair start in 1884, when residents of the Arizona Territory organized the Arizona Territorial Fair to provide family entertainment. The fair was held near the banks of the Salt River, just west of Central Avenue. Entertainment included horse, roosters, baby chicks, elephants, zebras, giraffes, ostriches, camels, lions, tigers, sharks, pigs, cats and dogs, pony and mule races, while agriculture, cattle (dairy and beef) and home economics were the common exhibits. The Territorial Fair continued annually at this location until 1891 when the Salt River flooded and wiped out the buildings and racetracks. 1892-1960 George Nicholas Goodman, multi-term mayor of Mesa, Arizona, was appointed executive secretary of the Arizona State Fair Commission in 1956 at an annual salary of $8,400 (). Executive secretary was the highest role and today the title would be president. Goodman died unexpectedly in 1959 while in office. Goodman's appointment came after each of the two immediate proceeding executive secretaries resigned, one holding the office for only two weeks. Both of those men were compensated $1,800 a year more than Goodman. Since 1961 In 2018 the Arizona State Governor's Office did a formal review of the future of the grounds and buildings of the Arizona State Fair. 2020 saw the COVID-19 pandemic as grounds for cancellation.

CSN was created by the European Maritime Safety Agency (ESMA) in 2007 to include services such as locating and following oil pollution, monitoring accidental or deliberate pollution, and identifying polluters through the use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite images. The information given from these images includes spill location, spill area and length, and source of the spill. As of 2017, CSN has become available in, ‚Äú23 European Union (EU) coastal member states, two EFTA coastal states, three EU candidate countries, the Dutch Caribbean, the French Antilles, Greenland and finally the European neighbourhood partner countries across the Mediterranean, Black and Caspian seas.‚Äù Access to this service is free to all those who accept to the Conditions of Use which state that the country must provide intel regarding verification of potential spills detected by CSN with follow up information, and that they provide information on spills that were not reported. The legal basis for the CSN service is Directive 2005/35/EC on ship-source pollution and on the introduction of penalties, including criminal penalties, for pollution offenses (as amended by Directive 2009/123/EC). The EMSA has been tasked to 'work with the member states in developing technical solutions and providing technical assistance in relation to the implementation of this directive, in actions such as tracing discharges by satellite monitoring and surveillance'.  History   Prelude  Monitoring European waters is particularly challenging being that EU is an inundated peninsula with extensive external coastlines and several significant semi-enclosed seas. Prior to the establishment of CSN, there were around 1400 satellite images taken per year used by 12 EU countries. These images were either bought from satellite providers or service providers under national contractors or were provided by the European Space Agency led MarCoast project. During this time, countries found the number of images to be insufficient in order to efficiently locate and deal with accidental or deliberate pollution caused by marine vessels. Manned aircraft were also frequently used for surveillance purposes on a small scale; however, it would be costly and inefficient to use them for comprehensive coverage of European waters. Two oil spills in particular caused by the tanker ships Erika and Prestige played influential roles in the need for a more efficient locating method due to the harsh environmental consequences they created. In December 1999, the tanker Erika departed from Dunkerque carrying 31,000 tons of heavy fuel oil. While crossing the Bay of Biscay in heavy weather, the tanker experienced structural damages resulting in the tanker breaking into two. Its fuel load was expelled into the surrounding French waters leaving serious environmental damage. When exposed to water for a period of time, the oil creates a water-in-oil emulsion causing an increase in volume and viscosity. During the cleanup process, between 190,000 and 200,000 tonnes of oil waste was collected from the surrounding 400 kilometers of shoreline. Because it left almost 42,000 birds dead, the spill caused by Erika was named the largest ecological disaster for Europe‚Äôs seabirds. In November 2002, the tanker Prestige departed from Ventspils, Latvia carrying 77,000 tons of two different grades of heavy fuel oil. Due to harsh weather conditions, the tanker took in water, resulting in a 50-foot hole in the side of the ship. French, Spanish, and Portuguese governments refused entry into their ports fearing pollution to their waters, resulting in the ship floating adrift for several days before it sank in Portuguese waters. In total, 20 million US gallons were expelled from the tanker leading to harsh environmental impacts. The consequences include 22,000 dead birds and a total loss of 296.96 million dollars to the Spanish fishing sector between the years 2002 and 2006. The Prestige oil spill remains Spain and Portugal‚Äôs worst ecological disaster to this day.  Formation  In September 2005, the European Parliament and the Council adopted Directive 2005/35/EC (since amended by Directive 2009/123/EC) in response to pollution caused by marine vessels. This directive established penalties including criminal offenses, for the improper dumping of wastes by ships. The directive tasked the EMSA to work with its member states to create technical solutions and provide technical assistance in order to implement the directive. In April 2007, the EMSA established an oil slick detection service using SAR satellite images in order to efficiently track and monitor oil spills in EU waters. This service would be available to all member states as well as authorities in all EU and EFTA states.  CleanSeaNet satellites  CSN uses images from a number of satellites in order to alert member states of potential oil spills. CSN offers near real-time (NRT) full resolution images of a 400 kilometer stretch of water in up to 30 minutes. Near real-time refers to the delivery time of images from the satellites to the operators. An additional 200 kilometers are added onto the images every five minutes after the initial thirty. The max length that can be obtained by these images is 1400 kilometers. CSN is able to achieve this through the use of SAR satellite images. The satellites use radar signals that are able to map a body of water based on the amount of disturbance on the surface from waves and ripples created by ocean winds. When oil is present on the water‚Äôs surface, it creates a glassy area free of ripples. SAR satellites send radar signals that bounce off the water‚Äôs surface measuring the amount of disturbance. Because oil creates less disturbance while present on the water‚Äôs surface, it appears darker than the surrounding area that is not exposed. This allows the satellites to map and locate an accumulation of oil. Not only are these satellites able to map oil slicks, but they are used for locating and identifying vessels. While oil slicks appear darker on the image, ships and other vessels appear a lighter color. Through the use of SeaSafeNet, the vessel can be identified almost immediately. CSN currently has three satellites in use which are ENVISAT, RADARSAT1, and RADARSAT 2. Through the use of these SAR satellites, CSN has been able to increase the of number of images to 2100 per year.  Protocol  CSN allows member states access to the images produced by SAR Satellites. These images, ‚Äúeither address sea areas not already covered, or which provide enhanced coverage for sea areas already under surveillance.‚Äù A network of receiving stations in Norway, Italy, and Azores download the satellite data and send it to control centers for processing and analysis by operators. Using precise methods, the trained operators are able to evaluate whether or not an area is being affected by an unprecedented pollution event. If detected, the information is sent to the affected member state(s) as well as to the EMSA. Coastal authorities are then sent to evaluate the scene and report back to the EMSA. If a large-scale pollution event is found, the national operational response mechanism is enacted. During this response, there is an alert level system used to judge the nature of the incident. The alert level is based on three distinct factors: likelihood, culprit, and impact. Likelihood refers to the confidence that the spill that occurred was oil. The next refers to how likely a culprit can be identified. Some of the factors used to measure this category include whether the possible culprit‚Äôs vessel track matches that of the spill‚Äôs shape, traffic density, whether a possible polluter has already been identified, and a culprit‚Äôs distance from the spill. The last factor is impact, which is measured by surface area, distance to sensitive areas, and distance to shoreline. Using these three factors, the EMSA can construct an Alert Matrix in order to describe the severity of the incident. Using an Alert Matrix, the EMSA identifies the severity using the colors red, yellow, and green. Green being low risk and red being high risk.  Examples of CleanSeaNet uses  In 2016, a CSN alert report was sent to authorities in the Netherlands and Germany concerning a possible spill. Because the spill area was split into both countries, both parties received alerts from CSN. Netherland officials flew over the area during the times that they were expecting services from CNS and were able to capture footage of the culprit while they were dumping palm oil off the vessel. When questioned by Netherland authorities, the captain proceeded to say that their actions did not break any guidelines. Netherland officials notified German officials, and upon further investigation of the vessel, it was found that the actions did in fact not follow guidelines resulting in a fine. In April 2015, the Oleg Naydenov sank 15 miles off the coast of Spain. This vessel was carrying, ‚ÄúThe vessel was carrying 1,409 tonnes of fuel, 30 tonnes of gasoil and 65 tonnes of luboil.‚Äù Directly following the incident, Spain received 13 images from CSN that allowed officials to more efficiently organize their relief efforts. In August 2011, 176 kilometers off the coast of Scotland, the Gannet F oil platform suffered an accident resulting in an oil spill. During the leak, the platform released 200 metric tonnes of oil into the surrounding body of water. Even days following the event, relief efforts still remained unsuccessful. Six days later, the UK‚Äôs Maritime and Coastguard Agency requested satellite support from the EMSA. Nine high resolution radar images and eight high resolution optical images were sent on the same day of the request. Five days later on August 21, the leak had been contained, and monitoring had been shut down only three days after this. In February 2010, two vessels collided entering the port of Genoa, 1.5 kilometers off the coast of northwest Italy. The tugboat called Francia collided into the CMA CGM Strauss, which was a container ship holding fuel oil. This resulted in a spillage of 184 tonnes into the area surrounding the port. French authorities requested assistance from CNS and received six satellite images within 30 hours to keep track of the oil slick that spanned between Genoa and Toulon. The spill was managed over the span of 10 days.

As the name suggests it is nucleated around a former heath (now park land). History Before the expansion of Maidstone, the heath was often used as a venue for a site for shire moots (or assemblies) during the Middle Ages. The most famous of these occurred shortly after the Norman Conquest of 1066 and involved a dispute between Odo bishop of Bayeux, half-brother of William the Conqueror and Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury (see below).A Report on the Penenden Trial by W. Levison, The English Historical Review, Vol. 27, No. 108 (Oct. 1912), pp. 717‚Äì720 The Domesday Book of 1086 subsequently recorded Pinnedenna as the place for the landowners of Kent to gather to receive notice in matters of administration at the shire court (and, if they did not attend, they should pay forfeiture of \\"one hundred shillings\\" to the King).Consuetudines Kanciae: A History of Gavelkind, and Other Remarkable Customs by Charles Sandys at page 304 (Google Books)England's Topographer Or A New and Complete History of the County of Kent by William Henry Ireland The heath was used for local administrative meetings and executions for several hundred years as well as a site for large gatherings of the populace.

James Coigly a United Irishman, was arrested en route to France. Upon his arrest, English authorities discovered a letter by the United Britons addressed to the French Revolutionary Government calling for an invasion of England, hidden in Coigly's garments. He was hanged at Penenden Heath, Maidstone on 7 June 1798. The last public execution on the heath took place in 1830 where John Dyke from the nearby village of Bearsted was hanged for burning a rick, although it later emerged he was innocent.John Dyke described at Bearsted village notes from Historic-Kent.co.ukPhotograph of John Dyke's grave New gallows were subsequently built outside Maidstone Prison.The Lonely Planet: Guide to Maidstone In 1828 the heath was again recorded as the site of a large gathering to debate the issue of \\"Protestant Ascendancy\\" before the passing of the Catholic Relief Act of 1829. A detailed report of the assembly on 24 October 1828 by Richard Lalor Sheil describes the heath as a \\"gently sloping amphitheatrical declivity\\" and still, in the 19th century, the principal venue in the area for massing the populace.Sketches of the Irish Bar by Richard Lalor Sheil and Robert Shelton Mackenzie at Google Books However during this time the heath was also used for recreation and was the venue for at least two early examples of county level cricket matches. Between 31 August and 2 September 1795, a team from Kent played England on the heath with England winning by five wickets.Scorecard at CricketArchive.co.uk Later, on 20 July 1807, \\"All England\\" again played Kent at Penenden, with the county winning by 162 runs.Cricketana from the New York Times 25 July 1880 During the 19th century the heath was slowly enveloped by the growth of the town of Maidstone, becoming a residential area at the junction of the main routes to Sittingbourne and Boxley. Following landscaping, the heath was presented to the people of Maidstone by the Earl of Romney in 1882 for use as a recreation ground.Penenden Recreation Ground at GardenHistory.org.uk Penenden Trial Odo de Bayeux was previously earl of Kent and the primary landowner of the region subsequent to his half-brother William the Conqueror's invasion of England in 1066. Several years after the invasion in 1070, Archbishop Lanfranc succeeded to the see of Canterbury and requested an inquiry into the activities of Odo (and Lanfranc's predecessor, Stigand) who had allegedly defrauded the Church (and possibly the Crown) during his tenure as Earl of Kent. Lanfranc demanded that the matter should be settled by the nobles of Kent and William I ordered that an assembly be formed at Penenden heath [sic] for the purpose.The Conquest and its Aftermath by Dr Mike Ibeji at BBC History Various prominent figures in the country at the time were called including Geoffrey de Montbray bishop of Coutances (who represented the King), Lanfranc (for the Church), Odo de Bayeux (defending himself), Arnost bishop of Rochester, √Üthelric II bishop of Chichester (an elderly bishop regarded as the authority on the laws of the realm), Richard de Tunibridge, Hugh de Montfort, William de Arsic, Hamo Vicecomes and many others. Precisely when the inquiry was held is unclear although many historians have determined it to be between 1075 and 1077.Feudal Empires: Norman and Plantagenet by John Le Patourel at Google Books The trial itself lasted three days and ended in the partial recovery of properties for the church from Odo and others. 20th century Today a residential suburb of Maidstone, Penenden Heath is situated between arterial roadways at junction 6 of the M20 motorway and the A249 Sittingbourne Road. The area includes a variety of shops, a public house and a playground. Toponymy The heath has been recorded under several names. First appearing in the Domesday Book as Pinnedenna, it has also been recorded as Pinnenden, Pickenden, Pinenden and Pennenden. It has been suggested that the name derives from the Saxon pinian meaning \\"to punish\\",A Handbook for Travellers in Kent and Sussex by John Murray (1858) at Google Books, p.87 which may date the site as a place for executions before the Norman Conquest. Environment Certain remnants of the heathland and its environment remain. Mature lime trees, with some younger replacements, line the boundaries to the recreation ground. In addition, large oak, chestnut, hawthorn, sycamore and ash trees feature. Heath Wood, which lies just beyond the suburb boundary, is a privately owned chestnut coppice. To the north, dense planting of native trees separates the Heath from the M20 motorway.Maidstone Green Spaces Strategy: Penenden Heath dated March 2006 Soil at the northern end of the recreation ground displays characteristics of heathland and dry acid grassland. Other areas evidence sheep's sorrel and common heath. Gorse and broom have been introduced in recent years.

This grants the projectile both greater speed and range than an ordinary shell, which is propelled only by the ballistic force of the gun's exploding charge. Some forms of rocket assisted projectiles can be outfitted with a laser-guide for greater accuracy. The German Sturmtiger (1944) used a 380 mm Rocket Propelled Round as its main projectile. These rounds had a maximum range of 6,000 m, and came with high explosive shells or shaped charges. A normal charge first accelerated the projectile to 45 m/s (150 ft/s), the 40 kg (88 lb) rocket charge then boosted this to about 250 m/s (820 ft/s). The North Korean M-1978 / M1989 (KOKSAN) 170mm self-propelled gun can use rocket assisted projectiles to achieve a range of around ; at one time this was the world's longest range tube field artillery piece.

Although they routinely give a fresh sound to 80-year-old songs, their repertoire and instrumentation categorizes them as a country blues or jug band. History Rick Sherry and Tom V. Ray first began playing together in the early 1990s as part of the Jake LaBotz Trio. After this unit broke up, the group began backing David \\"Honeyboy\\" Edwards, and performed as Devil in a Woodpile in between sets. The band first won acclaim locally in Chicago by playing frequent gigs at The Hideout. Signing with local folk/country label Bloodshot Records, the group released its first album in 1998 and a second in 2000. Soon after this they toured with Son Volt in the USA. Adding Madison, Wisconsin native Joel Paterson to the lineup in 2003, the group released its third record for Bloodshot in 2005. Gary Schepers (tuba) or Beau Sample (bass) often play with the band when Tom Ray is not available. In the summer of 2007, the group opened for the folk legend Ramblin' Jack Elliott in Cleveland. After more than ten years playing their weekly Tuesday slot at the Hideout, the group disbanded in 2009. That year, Rick Sherry joined with guitarist Eric Noden and bassist Beau Sample to form a new group, the Sanctified Grumblers.Sanctified Grumblers website This group plays in the same style, and eventually took over the old Hideout residency. Sherry has since re-reformed Devil in a Woodpile with Joel Paterson on guitar, banjo and kazoo, and Beau Sample on upright bass and jug. In 2015, Devil in a Woodpile/Sanctified Grumblers was inducted into the Jug Band Hall of Fame.Jug Band Hall of Fame website Music For the most part, Devil in a Woodpile perform cover tunes, playing and recording their own interpretation of an eclectic range of old songs. Their repertoire stretches from blues, jazz and ragtime, to traditional folk songs and some country influences. Their own compositions follow the same pattern.

The day use only park offers picnic tables and a hiking trail for views of the Willamette Valley and the Cascade Range. The state of Oregon acquired the in 1931 after Yamhill and Washington counties requested a park from the state. History Bald Peak was acquired by the state in 1931 after county officials in Washington and Yamhill counties lobbied the state parks commission for a state park for the two counties. The land was purchased from Samuel Otto on June 4, 1931, with the park originally named Bald Peak State Park. During the Great Depression, the Civilian Conservation Corps built picnic tables, restrooms, and a parking area at the site. In the mid-1930s an annual service on Easter began at the park, organized by local churches that continues to be held as of 2014. In 1939, the location was considered by the parks department as a memorial to the pioneer women of Oregon. State officials decided against this location due to the lack of water and its isolated location away from major roads. In 1996, the park was one of over 50 parks that the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department proposed closing due to a state budget deficit that reduced funding for the department. However, Bald Peak and the other parks remained open after political pressure forced the department to reconsider their plans. Details Forested section of the park. Bald Peak is on top of the Chehalem Mountains at an elevation of above sea level, the highest point in the mountain range. The closest community to the park is Laurelwood, Oregon, with the park generally situated between the cities of Hillsboro to the north and Newberg to the south near the county boundary line between Yamhill and Washington counties. At the park are restrooms, picnic tables, parking, a trail, a forest with Douglas fir trees, but no drinking water. In clear weather, the park offers views of Mount Hood, Mount St. Helens, Mount Jefferson, Mount Adams, and Mount Rainier. The viewpoint also gives panoramas of the Tualatin Valley to the north of the park and the Yamhill Valley to the south, with both valleys being parts of the larger Willamette Valley.

Principles SMM can, for example, use cylinders to model dielectric/metal objects in the domain. The total-field/scattered-field (TF/SF) formalism where the total field is written as sum of incident and scattered at each point in the domain: :E_{tot} = E_{inc} + E_{scatt} \\\\ By assuming series solutions for the total field, the SMM method transforms the domain into a cylindrical problem. In this domain total field is written in terms of Bessel and Hankel function solutions to the cylindrical Helmholtz equation. SMM method formulation, finally helps compute these coefficients of the cylindrical harmonic functions within the cylinder and outside it, at the same time satisfying EM boundary conditions. Finally, SMM accuracy can be increased by adding (removing) cylindrical harmonic terms used to model the scattered fields. SMM, eventually leads to a matrix formalism, and the coefficients are calculated through matrix inversion. For N-cylinders, each scattered field modeled using 2M+1 harmonic terms, SMM requires to solve a N(2M + 1) system of equations. Advantages SMM, is a rigorous and accurate method deriving from first principles. Hence, it is guaranteed to be accurate within limits of model, and not show spurious effects of numerical dispersion arising in other techniques like FDTD.
