Previously she was a biological researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, who studied the telomere, a structure at the end of chromosomes that protects the chromosome. In 1984, Blackburn co- discovered telomerase, the enzyme that replenishes the telomere, with Carol W. Greider. For this work, she was awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, sharing it with Greider and Jack W. Szostak, becoming the first Australian woman Nobel laureate. She also worked in medical ethics, and was controversially dismissed from the Bush Administration's President's Council on Bioethics. Early life and education International Day of Women' and Girls in Science' Elizabeth Helen Blackburn, one of seven children, was born in Hobart, Tasmania, on 26 November 1948 to parents who were both family physicians. Her family moved to the city of Launceston when she was four, where she attended the Broadland House Church of England Girls' Grammar School (later amalgamated with Launceston Church Grammar School) until the age of sixteen. Upon her family's relocation to Melbourne, she attended University High School, and ultimately gained very high marks in the end-of-year final statewide matriculation exams. She went on to earn a Bachelor of Science in 1970 and Master of Science in 1972, both from the University of Melbourne in the field of biochemistry. Blackburn then went to receive her PhD in 1975 from the University of Cambridge, where she worked with Frederick Sanger developing methods to sequence DNA using RNA, as well as studying the bacteriophage Phi X 174. It was also here, the Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratory of Molecular Biology at Cambridge University, where Blackburn met her husband John Sedat. Blackburn's soon to be husband had taken a position at Yale, where she then decided to finish her postdoctoral. ‚ÄúThus it was that love brought me to a most fortunate and influential choice: Joe Gall‚Äôs lab at Yale.‚Äù  Career and research During her postdoctoral work at Yale, Blackburn was doing research on the protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila and noticed a repeating codon at the end of the linear rDNA which varied in size. Blackburn then noticed that this hexanucleotide at the end of the chromosome contained a TTAGGG sequence that was tandemly repeated, and the terminal end of the chromosomes were palindromic. These characteristics allowed Blackburn and colleagues to conduct further research on the protozoan. Using the telomeric repeated end of Tetrahymena, Blackburn and colleague Jack Szostak showed the unstable replicating plasmids of yeast were protected from degradation, proving that these sequences contained characteristics of telomeres. This research also proved the telomeric repeats of Tetrahymena were conserved evolutionarily between the species. Through this research, Blackburn and collaborators noticed the replication system for chromosomes was not likely to add to the lengthening of the telomere, and that the addition of these hexanucleotides to the chromosomes was likely due to the activity of an enzyme that is able to transfer specific functional groups. The proposition of a possible transferase-like enzyme led Blackburn and PhD student Carol W. Greider to the discovery of an enzyme with reverse transcriptase activity that was able to fill in the terminal ends of telomeres without leaving the chromosome incomplete and unable to divide without loss of the end of the chromosome. This 1985 discovery led to the purification of this enzyme in lab, showing the transferase-like enzyme contained both RNA and protein components. The RNA portion of the enzyme served as a template for adding the telomeric repeats to the incomplete telomere, and the protein added enzymatic function for the addition of these repeats.Through this breakthrough, the term ‚Äútelomerase‚Äù was given to the enzyme, solving the end-replication process that had troubled scientists at the time. = Telomerase = Telomerase works by adding base pairs to the overhang of DNA on the 3‚Äô end, extending the strand until DNA polymerase and an RNA primer can complete the complementary strand and successfully synthesize the double stranded DNA. Since DNA polymerase only synthesizes DNA in the leading strand direction, the shortening of the telomere results. Through their research, Blackburn and collaborators were able to show that the telomere is effectively replenished by the enzyme telomerase, which conserves cellular division by preventing the rapid loss of genetic information internal to the telomere, leading to cellular aging. On January 1, 2016, Blackburn was interviewed about her studies, discovering telomerase, and her current research. When she was asked to recall the moment of telomerase discovery she stated: > Carol had done this experiment, and we stood, just in the lab, and I > remember sort of standing there, and she had this ‚Äì we call it a gel. It's > an autoradiogram because there were trace amounts of radioactivity that were > used to develop an image of the separated DNA products of what turned out to > be the telomerase enzyme reaction. I remember looking at it and just > thinking, 'Ah! This could be very big. This looks just right.' It had a > pattern to it. There was a regularity to it. There was something that was > not just sort of garbage there, and that was really kind of coming through, > even though we look back at it now, we'd say, technically, there was this, > that and the other, but it was a pattern shining through, and it just had > this sort of sense, 'Ah! There's something real here.' But then, of course, > the good scientist has to be very sceptical and immediately say, 'Okay, > we're going to test this every way around here, and really nail this one way > or the other.' If it's going to be true, you have to make sure that it's > true, because you can get a lot of false leads, especially if you're wanting > something to work. > In 1978, Blackburn joined the faculty of the University of California, Berkeley, in the Department of Molecular Biology. In 1990, she moved across the San Francisco Bay to the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), where she served as the Department Chair from 1993 to 1999 and was the Morris Herzstein Professor of Biology and Physiology at UCSF. Blackburn became a Professor Emeritus at UCSF at the end of 2015. Blackburn, co-founded the company Telomere Health which offers telomere length testing to the public, but later severed ties with the company. In 2015, Elizabeth Blackburn was announced as the new President of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California. ‚ÄúFew scientists garner the kind of admiration and respect that Dr. Blackburn receives from her peers for her scientific accomplishments and her leadership, service and integrity,‚Äù says Irwin M. Jacobs, chairman of Salk's Board of Trustees, on Blackburn's appointment as President of the Institute. ‚ÄúHer deep insight as a scientist, her vision as a leader, and her warm personality will prove invaluable as she guides the Salk Institute on its continuing journey of discovery.‚Äù In 2017, she announced her plans to retire from the Salk Institute the following year. = Nobel Prize = For their research and contributions to the understanding of telomeres and the enzyme telomerase, Elizabeth Blackburn, Carol Greider, and Jack Szostaks were awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The substantial research on the effects of chromosomal protection from telomerase, and the impact this has on cellular division has been a revolutionary catalyst in the field of molecular biology. For example, the addition of telomerase to cells that do not possess this enzyme has shown to bypass the limit of cellular aging in those cells, thereby linking this enzyme to reduced cellular aging. The addition of telomerase, and the presence of the enzyme in cancer cells has been shown to provide an immunity mechanism for the cell in proliferating, linking the transferase activity to increased cellular growth and reduced sensitivity for cellular signalling. The importance of discovering this enzyme has since sent led her continued research at the University of California San Francisco, where she studies the effect of telomeres and telomerase activity on cellular aging. =Bioethics= Blackburn was appointed a member of the President's Council on Bioethics in 2002. She supported human embryonic cell research, in opposition to the Bush Administration. Her Council terms were terminated by White House directive on 27 February 2004. Dr. Blackburn believes that she was dismissed from the Council due to her disapproval of the Bush administration's position against stem cell research. This was followed by expressions of outrage over her removal by many scientists, 170 of whom signed an open letter to the president maintaining that she was fired because of political opposition to her advice. Scientists and ethicists at the time even went as far to say that Blackburn's removal was in violation of Federal Advisory Committee Act of 1972, which ‚Äúrequires balance on such advisory bodies‚Äù \\"There is a growing sense that scientific research‚Äîwhich, after all, is defined by the quest for truth‚Äîis being manipulated for political ends,\\" wrote Blackburn. \\"There is evidence that such manipulation is being achieved through the stacking of the membership of advisory bodies and through the delay and misrepresentation of their reports.\\"Bioethics and the Political Distortion of Biomedical Science Elizabeth Blackburn, N Engl J Med 350:1379‚Äì1380 (1 April 2004)A Nobel prize for a Bush critic By Andrew Leonard, Salon.com, 5 October 2009 Free text. Extensive quotation from Blackburn's article.She is an important scientist throughout the world. Blackburn serves on the Science Advisory Board of the Regenerative Medicine Foundation formerly known as the Genetics Policy Institute. = Publications = Blackburn's first book The Telomere Effect: A Revolutionary Approach to Living Younger, Healthier, Longer (2017) was co- authored with health psychologist Dr. Elissa Epel of Aging, Metabolism, and Emotions (AME) Center at the UCSF Center for Health and Community. Blackburn comments on aging reversal and care for one's telomeres through lifestyle: managing chronic stress, exercising, eating better and getting enough sleep; telomere testing, plus cautions and advice. While studying telomeres and the replenishing enzyme, telomerase, Blackburn discovered a vital role played by these protective caps that revolved around one central idea: aging of cells. The book hones in on many of the effects that poor health can have on telomeres and telomerase activity. Since telomeres shorten with every division of a cell, replenishing these caps is essential to long term cell growth. Through research and data, Blackburn explained that people that lead stressful lives exhibit less telomerase functioning in the body, which leads to a decrease in the dividing capabilities of the cell. Once telomeres shorten drastically, the cells can no longer divide, meaning the tissues they replenish with every division would therefore die out, highlighting the aging mechanism in humans. To increase telomerase activity in people with stress- filled lives, Blackburn suggests moderate exercise, even 15 minutes a day, which has been proven to stimulate telomerase activity and replenish the telomere. Blackburn also states that unhappiness in lives also has an effect on the shortening of telomeres. In a study done on divorced couples, their telomere length was \\"significantly shorter\\" compared to couples in healthy relationships, and Blackburn states, \\"There's an obvious stressor... we are intensely social beings.\\" She suggests to include positivity into our daily lives to increase health as well. While increasing the amount of exercise, decreasing stress, tobacco use, and maintaining a balanced sleep schedule, Blackburn explains that our telomeres can be drastically maintained and prevented from rapid shortening, leading to a decrease in the aging process of our cells. Blackburn also tells the readers to be wary of clinical pills who proclaim to lengthen or telomeres and protect the body from aging. She says that these pills and creams have no scientific proof of being anti-aging supplements, and that the key to preserving our telomeres and stimulating telomerase activity comes from leading a healthy life. = Current research = In recent years Blackburn and her colleagues have been investigating the effect of stress on telomerase and telomeres with particular emphasis on mindfulness meditation. She is also one of several biologists (and one of two Nobel Prize laureates) in the 1995 science documentary Death by Design/The Life and Times of Life and Times. Studies suggest that chronic psychological stress may accelerate ageing at the cellular level. Intimate partner violence was found to shorten telomere length in formerly abused women versus never abused women, possibly causing poorer overall health and greater morbidity in abused women. At the University of California San Francisco, Blackburn currently researches telomeres and telomerase in many organisms, from yeast to human cells. The lab is focused on telomere maintenance, and how this has an impact on cellular aging. Many chronic diseases have been associated with the improper maintenance of these telomeres, thereby effecting cellular division, cycling, and impaired growth. At the cutting edge of telomere research, the Blackburn lab currently investigates the impact of limited maintenance of telomeres in cells through altering the enzyme telomerase. =Awards and honors= Blackburns awards and honors include: Elizabeth Blackburn (Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology 2009) in Stockholm, June 2016 *Eli Lilly Research Award for Microbiology and Immunology (1988) *National Academy of Sciences Award in Molecular Biology (1990) *Harvey Society Lecturer at the Harvey Society in New York (1990) *Honorary Doctorate of Science from Yale University (1991) *Fellow of American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1991) *Elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1992 *Fellow of American Academy of Microbiology (1993) *Foreign Associate of National Academy of Sciences (1993) *Australia Prize (1998) *Gairdner Foundation International Award (1998) *Harvey Prize (1999) *Keio Medical Science Prize (1999) *California Scientist of the Year in 1999 *American Academy of Achievement's Golden Plate Award (2000) *American Association for Cancer Research ‚Äì G.H.A.

The grandiose ensemble of the Hall and its adjoining salons was intended to illustrate the power of the absolutist monarch Louis XIV. Located on the ground floor of the palace's central body, it faces west towards the Palace Gardens for a complete perspective. The Hall of Mirrors has been the scene of events of great historic significance, including the Proclamation of the German Empire and the signing of the Treaty of Versailles.  Cultural and historical background  = Construction = The royal apartments adjacent to the Hall of Mirrors In 1623 King Louis XIII ordered the construction of a modest two-story hunting lodge at Versailles, which he soon enlarged to a ch√¢teau from 1631 to 1634. His son Louis XIV declared the site his future permanent residence in 1661 and ordered the transformation into an extensive residence in several stages and on a grandiose scale. The palace was to provide ideal settings for rest and retreat but it also had to attain a new quality of representation as the future seat of Europe's greatest absolutist royal court and government of supreme authority, residence of choice for the aristocratic society and arena for elaborate state festivals and ceremonies, Europe's centre of culture, art and entertainment. During the early expansion phase Louis Le Vau added the Forecourt (1662) and the ‚ÄúLe Vau Envelope‚Äù (1668 to 1670), encased the old ch√¢teau and added two new wings in the north and south. The new wings towered over the original western building by the garden. The space in between was a terrace supported by arcades. The buildings of the ‚ÄúLe Vau Envelope‚Äù included the king's apartments in the north and the queen's apartments in the south. The Hall of Mirrors was built during the third building stage between 1678 and 1684 and was to replace the large terrace, that opened towards the garden. The terrace was originally situated directly outside of the King's and the Queen‚Äôs apartments. The terrace was considered to be a rather misplaced architectural element and exposed to the elements, reducing its utility. Eventually it was decided to demolish it and architect Jules Hardouin-Mansart was tasked with the design development and the construction of the Mirror Hall Gallery and artist Charles Le Brun received the honor to create the interior decorative apparatus. The garden facade of the Corps de logis was built in a straight front and essentially received its current appearance. The Hall of Mirrors is flanked at the far ends by the Salon of War (Salon de la guerre) in the north and the Salon of Peace (Salon de la paix) in the south, respectively. The Mirror Gallery connects to the two Salons, which were assigned to and incorporated into the king's apartments in the north and the queen's apartments in the south. Both Salons are accessible via the Mirror Gallery through wide opening passageways. The Hall and the two Salons were identically furnished and decorated and form a stylistic and functional unit. The exterior walls of the Salons date from the time of Le Vau's encasings of the old ch√¢teau and were given their current appearance after the installation of the Mirror Hall by Hardouin-Mansart. The Hall of Mirrors is besides the Palace Chapel, completed in the early 18th century, the Court Opera and the Galerie des Batailles one of the largest rooms in the palace. It is long and deep. With its height of it reaches to the Attic floor of the Corps de Logis. The square windows on the upper floor, which can be seen from the outside, only serve aesthetic purposes, as there are no rooms inside. The installation of any kind of fireplaces was never contemplated as the Hall of Mirrors was too large to effectively be heated. Arts and decoration Sculptured Gu√©ridons replaced the 1689 melted down silver furniture. The Mirror Hall's 17 windows open in the direction of the park. On the opposite inside wall of the Hall are 17 equally large mirrors, that are composed of more than 350 individual mirror surfaces. On the one hand, the mirrors had an aesthetic function, as the mirror image of the garden depicted the exterior of the castle into the interior of the building and reflected the candlelight in the evening. On the other hand, the mirrors also conveyed the king's wealth and the efficiency of the French economy in a subtle way. Mirror glass was an expensive luxury product in the 17th century and could only be produced with great effort. The manufacture of the mirror surfaces was the first major order for the Manufacture royale de glaces de miroirs, a glass factory founded by Jean- Baptiste Colbert, the later Compagnie de Saint-Gobain, with which the Venetian monopoly on the manufacture of mirrors in Europe was broken. Much of the original solid silver furniture of the Hall of Mirrors, famous at the time, was soon lost, particularly the silver Gu√©ridons (tables), which were melted down and coined by order of Louis XIV in 1689 to finance the War of the League of Augsburg. Today's furniture was manufactured during the 19th century after most of the original furnishings were lost during the French Revolution. = Ceiling paintings = The Hall's grandeur is besides the mirrors, best perceived through the majesty of its vault. Nine large and numerous smaller ceiling paintings are dedicated to the idolization of the Sun King and praise the successes of the first 20 years of his reign. Charles Le Brun, \\"the greatest French artist of all time\\" according to king Louis XIV, was, unsurprisingly, the artist of choice for the ceiling paintings. The most prestigious scenes were painted on strengthened canvas and glued to the vault by Le Brun himself, aged 60 at the start of the work. The painting The King Governs Himself highlights the claim to absolute power. Further topics include the Peace of Nijmegen and the Cconquest of the Franche-Comt√©. A contemporary anecdote: the mirror surface furnishings of such large areas as the seventeen arches has been the idea of architect Jules Hardouin-Mansart, who wanted to prevent Le Brun from having even more opportunities to impress Louis with his work. = Sculptures = The gilded bronze capitals of the Rouge de Rance marble pilasters are decorated with the Fleur-de-lis and Gallic roosters. The gilded bronze trophies, that adorn the green marble Pier glasses, were manufactured by goldsmith Pierre Ladoyreau. The marble and porphyry busts of eight Roman emperors are accompanied by sculptures of Greek and Roman deities and Muses, such as Bacchus, Venus (Venus of Arles), Modesty, Hermes, Urania, Nemesis and Diana (Diana of Versailles). The latter, moved to the Louvre in 1798, was replaced by a Diana sculpted by Ren√© Fr√©min for the gardens of the Ch√¢teau de Marly until the restoration of the Hall of Mirrors during 2004 to 2007, which in turn was replaced by a copy of the original Diana.  Functions  Louis XIV receiving the Doge of Genoa at Versailles on 15 May 1685 The signing of peace to end World War 1 in the Hall of Mirrors, 28th June 1919 During the 17th century, the Hall's main purpose was to serve as a kind of covered promenade for Louis XIV's visit to the chapel. He entered the gallery at least once a day and from 1701, the king's bedroom lay behind the middle wall of the gallery. Courtiers assembled to meet the king and members of the royal family and might make a particular request by intoning: \\"Sire, Marly?\\". This was the manner in which nobles were able to obtain a much sought-after invitation to one of the king's house parties at Marly-le-Roi, a villa Louis XIV had built north of Versailles on the route to Saint-Germain-en-Laye. Its central location and size predestined the Hall of Mirrors as a place for court festivities such as the wedding of the Duke of Burgundy with Marie Ad√©la√Øde of Savoy, the wedding of Louis Ferdinand and Maria Theresa of Spain in 1645 and the wedding of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette in 1770. In the successive reigns of Louis XV and Louis XVI, the Hall of Mirrors continued to serve for family and court functions. Embassies, births, and marriages were held in this room. The most celebrated event of the 18th century on 25 February 1745 was the celebrated Yew Tree Ball. It was during this costume ball that Louis XV, who was dressed as a yew tree, met Jeanne-Antoinette Poisson d'√âtiolles, who was costumed as Diana, goddess of the hunt. Jeanne-Antoinette, who became Louis XV's mistress, is better known to history as the Marquise de Pompadour. Foreign audiences were granted, including that of the Doge of Genoa in 1685 and the embassy of King Mahmud I of Turkey in 1742. However, of all the events that transpired in this room during the reign of Louis XIV, the Siamese Embassy of 1685 to 1686 has been cited as the most opulent. At this time, the Hall of Mirrors and the grand appartements were still decorated with the original silver furniture. In its heyday, over 3,000 candles were used to light the Hall of Mirrors. In February 1715, Louis XIV held his last embassy in the Hall when he received Mehemet Reza Bey, ambassador of the Shah of Persia. On 18 January 1871 during the siege of Paris at the conclusion of the Franco-Prussian War, the Prussian king, William I, was, led by Otto von Bismarck, declared German emperor ‚Äî thus establishing the German Empire ‚Äî in the Hall of Mirrors by the assembled German princes and lords. The choice fell among other things like Versailles being the headquarters of the united German armies, on the Hall of Mirrors because its ceiling paintings glorified the conquest of German territories by France. The French nation regarded this ceremony as deeply humiliating. The event greatly contributed to the further accretion of the Franco-German enmity. A few decades later French Prime Minister Clemenceau consciously chose the Hall of Mirrors as the site to sign the Treaty of Versailles on 28 June 1919, that officially ended World War I, to dismantle the German Empire in the room where it had been proclaimed. The Hall of Mirrors remains reserved for official ceremonies of the French Republic. Notable events during the 20th century were the reception of US- President John Fitzgerald Kennedy and his wife by Charles De Gaulle, the reception of the Shah of Iran Mohammad Reza Pahlavi by Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing in 1974 or the invitation of representatives of the Group of Seven summit by President Fran√ßois Mitterrand from June 4 to 6, 1982.

Monsky was born in Omaha, Nebraska on October 23, 1953. She was a competitive figure skater as a teenager. Monsky received a BA in Economics at Pitzer College, where she also met her future husband Mark Scher. She received her MBA from Stanford University in 1980, while living in San Francisco and working on the Pacific Stock Exchange. In 1982, while working as a management consultant for McKinsey & Co. Inc., Monsky was diagnosed with scleroderma and was told she had only two years to live. The rare disease hardens the skin and internal organs of young women of child-bearing age causing disfigurement, and is potentially fatal. In reaction to the lack of awareness of the disease in the medical community, she went on to found the Scleroderma Research Foundation in 1987, an organization dedicated to finding a cure. According to the New York Times, \\"Ms. Monsky's activities generated more than $14 million for research and helped expand understanding of the disease. Money she disbursed for basic medical research on scleroderma led to the publication of scientific articles exploring potential cures. Her work also helped make scleroderma better known.\\" Ms. Monsky applied her business expertise to successful fund-raising efforts. For example, she organized an annual fund-raiser which in 1992 combined top comedians such as Bob Saget plus fine cuisine which drew 420 people and netted donations of $125,000. Monsky's friend actress Dana Delany said \\"Sharon's work literally convinced researchers that there was hope in finding a cure ... Before research can begin researchers have to be convinced there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Now we know it's a solvable problem held back only by research resources.\\" In 1996, Monsky appeared in the ABC TV movie For Hope alongside Delany. After living 18 years beyond the original prognosis, Monsky died on May 11, 2002, at age 48, due to complications from the disease.

He wrote a comprehensive treatise, Manual of Psychometry: the Dawn of a New Civilization (1885), detailing how the direct knowledge of psychometry would be applied to and affect the many various branches of science. It also would elevate the various schools of philosophy and arts thereby affecting wide social change and ultimately an enlightenment of humanity:Buchanan, 1893, pp.4‚Äì5 > The thermometer measures caloric (thermo temperature). The barometer > measures the weight (baro, weight) of the atmosphere; the electrometer > measures electric conditions; the psychometer measures the soul (psyche).

August, 1887. No. 7. Buchanan's work on psychometry was continued by the geologist William Denton (1823-1883). In 1863, Denton published a book on the subject The Soul of Things. Their work was criticized by Joseph Jastrow as based on delusion and wishful thinking.Jastrow, Joseph. (1935). Wish and Wisdom: Episodes in the Vagaries of Belief. D. Appleton-Century Company. pp. 314-322. (Published in 1962 by Dover Books as Error and Eccentricity in Human Belief). Others, such as Stephen Pearl Andrews who promoted Psychometry along with his own new science of Universology, built upon Buchanan's ideas. As a lecturer Andrews asserted that such inquiries, as paraphrased by an 1878 New York Times article, \\"demonstrated that the sympathy between the mind and body is an exact science\\".A discourse on Seven Sciences.; Cerebral Physiology, Cerebral Psychology, Sarcognomy, Psychometry, Pneumatology, Pathology, and Cerebral Pathology.

Skeptic Robert Todd Carroll describes psychometry as a pseudoscience. The majority of police departments polled do not use psychics and do not consider them credible or useful on cases. Proponents of psychometry have argued that psychic detectives have been used by law enforcement agencies on specific cases. However, psychologist Leonard Zusne has noted that \\"enquiries with police officials... reveal that the involvement of psychics has not been very helpful, and that second-hand reports of it are often in gross error.\\" See also * Law of contagion * List of parapsychology topics * Parapsychology * Retrocognition * Precognition * List of topics characterized as pseudoscience * Discernment of Spirits References  Further reading  * Joseph Rodes Buchanan (1893).

The term referred to a syndicate of booksellers, mostly in London, who bought shares to finance the book's printing. Each member agreed to take so many copies for sale themselves, and the final profit was split in proportion to the members' initial financial input. F. A. Mumby, Publishing and Bookselling, rev. ed.1954, p 141 Their names all appeared on the title pages as co-publishers, though one of the major publishing houses usually took the lead in setting the deal up. Prior to the Statute of Anne, the Conger (often seen capitalized) also had an effect on copyright. After the printing became common, publishers took the position that having purchased a work from an author, the right to control its publication continued permanently. Courts supported the claim via precedent, until the Statute was passed early in the 18th century, after which it was law that literary works went into the public domain after a fixed time set by statute. F. A. Mumby, Publishing and Bookselling, rev. ed.1954, p 139-40, Based on Augustine Birrell, Seven Lectures on the Law and History of Copyright in Books, 1899 This system seems to have been mostly used in the financing of major projects -- for example, multi-volume works such as encyclopedias.

It is located on the island of Java. The regency's name stems from the fact that it is situated to the west (in Javanese \\"kulon\\") of the Progo River. The capital is Wates. The greatest part of the population of the regency work as farmers. Kulon Progo is surrounded by the Menoreh Hills. The area of the regency is 586.27 km¬≤, and the population was 388,755 at the 2010 Census; the latest estimate (for January 2014) is 404,155. History In 1674, Keraton Mataram, Yogyakarta was attacked by Trunojoyo who received assistance from Macassar, resulting in damage to the palace and the king Amangkurat I had to flee and asked the Netherlands for help, till he died in Tegal during flight. To anticipate attacks from Trunojoyo's followers, in 1677 the palace of Mataram led by Amangkurat II as the crown prince of Amangkurat I asked for the regent Ponorogo to obtain the palace protection by bala Warok famous skilled in war and asked for help from the Dutch colonial to capture Trunojoyo. After Mataram palace was guarded by Warok of Ponorogo, Tronojoyo had difficulties to penetrate the palace and was arrested and finally sentenced to death in 1679. The Warok who managed to protect the palace got the prize a place to stay in the west of Mataram palace to facilitate the palace defence in case of an attack against the palace. The place was named Kulon Ponorogo and is now known as Kulon Progo which means Keraton Mataram western Ponorogo. The area which currently includes the district of Kulon Progo until the end of Dutch colonial rule is the territory of two districts, namely Kulon Progo which is a region of the Sultanate Ngayogyakarta and District Adikarto which is a region of the Duchy Pakualaman. Both districts were merged into Kulon Progo administration on October 15, 1951. Administrative districts Kulon Progo Regency is divided into 12 districts, listed below with their populations at the 2010 Census:Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011 * Temon (24,471) * Wates (43,995) * Panjatan (33,397) * Galur (29,120) * Lendah (36,447) * Sentolo (44,525) * Pengasih (45,175) * Kokap (31,124) * Girimulyo (21,893) * Nanggulan (27,239) * Kalibawang (26,802) * Samigaluh (24,681) Forestry Some local development efforts, carried on with the support of local cooperatives, work towards reafforestation activities. Trees being planted in the regency for both commercial and social reasons include Jati (Teak or Tecnona grandis), Mahogany (Swietenia mahagoni), Albasia (Albizia), and sono keliling (Blackwood or Rosewoon, Dalbergia latifolia).Nani Afrida, 'Kulon Progo: Invests in green future', The Jakarta Post, 10 April 2013. Yogyakarta International Airport The central Indonesian government has indicated that a new airport for the Yogyakarta Special Region will be located in the Kulon Progo Regency. The plan is to build an airport with a 3,250 metre runway with 45 meters width and dual linear terminals to serve as an international gateway. The initial plan is to provide facilities to serve up to 10 million passengers per year for 28 aircraft together. Later expansions might accommodate up to 20 million passengers per year in phase-3. Around 637 hectares of land is being set aside for the project. Of this, 40% is classified as \\"Paku Alam (Sultan)\\" land while the rest belongs to local communities. The location is in Temon District between Congot Beach and Glagah Beach (which covers Palihan village, Sindutan village, Jangkaran village and Glagah village). In August 2013, 75 percent of land has been occupied. An airport train has been planned to serve Yogyakarta and the airport. The rail use existing rail plus 4 kilometers new rail from Kedundang Station to Temon Airport. Due to new rail is only short, so the train hopefully will be ready when the airport is ready to operate. Local residents of the Kulon Regency have been resisting the plans for the new airport. They claim there are several environmental issues with the proposed site as well as issues of safety, due to the area being at high risk for tsunamis and other natural disasters. There is also concern that the local residents who currently make their living by farming the area would be displaced. References Kiskendo Cave, one of the many caves in Kulon Progo regency.

Geography The St. Johns River flows out of the lake at the north end at Rocky Point. To the east of this is Salt Cove, taking the flow from Salt Creek. Just south of Salt Cove is Lisk Point, named for a Dr. Lisk who built a house near the point. Steamboats coming down from Jacksonville made a counter clockwise loop around the lake with their first stop at Lisk Point. Lake George is the second largest lake in Florida, after Lake Okeechobee. Lake George was the third largest lake behind Lake Apopka, but conversion of the littoral zone on the northern side of Lake Apopka to farm fields in the previous century reduced its surface area. History The name of Lake Welaka is taken from \\"Welaka\\" (meaning \\"chain of lakes\\"), the name for the St. Johns River in the language of the Timucua, who inhabited the region prior to European settlement. The first European to visit the lake was Pedro Men√©ndez de Avil√©s, who as the Spanish governor of Florida, explored the St. Johns River in the spring of 1596.Wass de Czege, Albert. The History of Astor on the St. Johns, Astor Park, and the Surrounding Area, Third extended edition, pg. 9-11. Danubian Press, Astor, Florida, 1996. . Later, the Florida territory was sold to Britain. The royal botanist in America to King George III, John Bartram, explored the St. Johns River in 1765. It was John Bartram who gave the lake the name Lake George, in honor of his king. In more recent years, Lake George has been home to an operational U.S. Military bombing and aerial mining range. The range is affiliated with the U.S. Navy's Pinecastle Bombing Range located in the Ocala National Forest just west of Lake George. The bombing ranges date back to World War II, when the Navy built bomb targets in Lake George and nearby Crescent Lake, and stationed personnel in the area to maintain the targets and perform search and rescue operations for downed pilots. Today, the range is under the operational control of nearby Naval Air Station Jacksonville. The lake also hosts a wide variety of wildlife ranging from migratory water birds and alligators to a number of normally marine animals. Local springs in Lake George (and throughout the St Johns River) impart enough salt to the system to make the habitat suitable to resident and migratory marine species like Atlantic stingray, various species of mullet, striped bass and blue crabs. There is a large enough blue crab population to support a local fishery, making it one of the only fresh water blue crab fisheries in the world.

She was Jewish.https://www.jta.org/jewniverse/2017/the-raucous- jewish-stand-up-comedienne-who-made-fat-jokes Career Fields gained fame during the 1960s and 1970s. Ed Sullivan gave Fields her first big break when he booked her on his show after seeing her perform at the Copacabana in New York. She made multiple appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show, The Mike Douglas Show, The Merv Griffin Show, and The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. She also appeared in a 1971 episode of The Carol Burnett Show (Season 4, Episode 21) and a 1972 fifth-season episode of Here's Lucy (Season 5, Episode 7) starring Lucille Ball. It was on Mike Douglas in 1974 that Totie met the band Kiss, who were making their first national TV appearance. Fields joked that it would be funny if lead singer Gene Simmons, under the makeup, turned out to be \\"just a nice Jewish boy.\\" Simmons (who is not only Jewish but was born in Israel) responded \\"You should only know\\", to which Fields said, \\"I do!

She suffered from diabetes and in March 1976 she had surgery to remove a blood clot but it failed and she developed phlebitis. In April 1976, her left leg was amputated above the knee. This caused her to use a scooter for mobility and file a $2 million lawsuit against the hospital and doctors who had initially treated her. Fields' last television appearance before her surgery was in a rare straight dramatic guest-starring role on the CBS-TV drama series Medical Center, which aired on February 23, 1976. In that episode, \\"Life, Death, and Mrs. Armbruster\\", Fields played Phoebe Armbruster, a hospital janitor plagued by heart problems. In June 1977 a much-thinner Fields starred in the Home Box Office special series Standing Room Only, beginning her show seated in a wheelchair.HBO Program Guide As the audience welcomed her, she stood up, causing the cheering audience to stand with her. Said Fields: \\"I've waited all my life to say this ... I weigh less than Elizabeth Taylor!\\" While still recovering from the amputation, Fields suffered two heart attacks. In October 1977, Fields was diagnosed with breast cancer and had a mastectomy to remove her right breast and also had an eye operation. However, Fields continued to perform, incorporating her health problems into her act. As a result, this changed the tone of her humor. Actor Van Johnson, who was a friend of Fields, was said to have remarked, \\"When Totie lost weight, she wasn't funny anymore.\\" Nevertheless, in 1978, during the last year of her life, Fields was voted \\"Entertainer of the Year\\" and \\"Female Comedy Star of the Year\\" by the American Guild of Variety Artists. =Death= On August 2, 1978, Fields was scheduled to begin a two-week engagement at Las Vegas‚Äô Sahara Hotel when, on the eve of the opening, she was stricken at home by a blood clot, suffering a fatal pulmonary embolism.

Fish hooks have been employed for centuries by anglers to catch fresh and saltwater fish. In 2005, the fish hook was chosen by Forbes as one of the top twenty tools in the history of man. Fish hooks are normally attached to some form of line or lure which connects the caught fish to the angler. There is an enormous variety of fish hooks in the world of fishing. Sizes, designs, shapes, and materials are all variable depending on the intended purpose of the fish hook. Fish hooks are manufactured for a range of purposes from general fishing to extremely limited and specialized applications. Fish hooks are designed to hold various types of artificial, processed, dead or live baits (bait fishing); to act as the foundation for artificial representations of fish prey (fly fishing); or to be attached to or integrated into other devices that represent fish prey (lure fishing). History Native American shell fish hook from California. Auckland Museum The fish hook or similar device has been made by man for many thousands of years. The world's oldest fish hooks (they were made from sea snails shells) were discovered in Sakitari Cave in Okinawa Island dated between 22,380 and 22,770 years old. They are older than the fish hooks from the Jerimalai cave in East Timor dated between 23,000 and 16,000 years old, and New Ireland in Papua New Guinea dated 20,000 to 18,000 years old. The earliest fish hooks in the Americas, dating from about 11,000 B.P., have been reported from Cedros Island on the west coast of Mexico. These fish hooks were made from sea shells. Shells provided a common material for fish hooks found in several parts of the world, with the shapes of prehistoric shell fish hook specimens occasionally being compared to determine if they provide information about the migration of people into the Americas.Terry L Jones, Jennifer E Perry, eds., Contemporary Issues in California Archaeology (2012), p. 218. An early written reference to a fish hook is found with reference to the Leviathan in the Book of Job 41:1; Canst thou draw out leviathan with a hook? Fish hooks have been crafted from all sorts of materials including wood, animalC.Michael Hogan (2008) Morro Creek, The Megalithic Portal, ed. by A. Burnham and human bone, horn, shells, stone, bronze, iron, and up to present day materials. In many cases, hooks were created from multiple materials to leverage the strength and positive characteristics of each material. Norwegians as late as the 1950s still used juniper wood to craft Burbot hooks. Quality steel hooks began to make their appearance in Europe in the 17th century and hook making became a task for specialists. The Bridgeman Art Library Anatomy and construction Commonly referred to parts of a fish hook are: its point, the sharp end that penetrates the fish's mouth or flesh; the barb, the projection extending backwards from the point, that secures the fish from unhooking; the eye, the loop in the end of the hook that is connected to the fishing line or lure; the bend and shank, that portion of the hook that connects the point and the eye; and the gap, the distance between the shank and the point. In many cases, hooks are described by using these various parts of the hook, for example: wide gape, long shank, hollow point or out turned eye. Contemporary hooks are manufactured from either high-carbon steel, steel alloyed with vanadium, or stainless steel, depending on application. Most quality fish hooks are covered with some form of corrosion-resistant surface coating. Corrosion resistance is required not only when hooks are used, especially in saltwater, but while they are stored. Additionally, coatings are applied to color and/or provide aesthetic value to the hook. At a minimum, hooks designed for freshwater use are coated with a clear lacquer, but hooks are also coated with gold, nickel, Teflon, tin and different colors. Hook types A Variety of fish hooks There are a large number of different types of fish hooks. At the macro level, there are bait hooks, fly hooks and lure hooks. Within these broad categories there are wide varieties of hook types designed for different applications. Hook types differ in shape, materials, points and barbs, and eye type, and ultimately in their intended application. When individual hook types are designed the specific characteristics of each of these hook components are optimized relative to the hook's intended purpose. For example, a delicate dry fly hook is made of thin wire with a tapered eye because weight is the overriding factor. Whereas Carlisle or Aberdeen light wire bait hooks make use of thin wire to reduce injury to live bait but the eyes are not tapered because weight is not an issue. Many factors contribute to hook design, including corrosion resistance, weight, strength, hooking efficiency, and whether the hook is being used for specific types of bait, on different types of lures or for different styles of flies. For each hook type, there are ranges of acceptable sizes. For all types of hooks, sizes range from 32 (the smallest) to 20/0 (the largest). =Shapes and names= Hook shapes and names are as varied as fish themselves. In some cases hooks are identified by a traditional or historic name, e.g. Aberdeen, Limerick or O'Shaughnessy. In other cases, hooks are merely identified by their general purpose or have included in their name, one or more of their physical characteristics. Some manufacturers just give their hooks model numbers and describe their general purpose and characteristics. For example: * Eagle Claw: 139 is a Snelled Baitholder, Offset, Down Eye, Two Slices, Medium Wire * Lazer Sharp: L2004EL is a Circle Sea, Wide Gap, Non-Offset, Ringed Eye, Light Wire * Mustad Model: 92155 is a Beak Baitholder hook * Mustad Model: 91715D is an O'Shaughnessy Jig Hook, 90 degree angle * TMC Model 300: Streamer D/E, 6XL, Heavy wire, Forged, Bronze * TMC Model 200R: Nymph & Dry Fly Straight eye, 3XL, Standard wire, Semidropped point, Forged, Bronze The shape of the hook shank can vary widely from merely straight to all sorts of curves, kinks, bends and offsets. These different shapes contribute in some cases to better hook penetration, fly imitations or bait holding ability. Many hooks intended to hold dead or artificial baits have sliced shanks which create barbs for better baiting holding ability. Jig hooks are designed to have lead weight molded onto the hook shank. Hook descriptions may also include shank length as standard, extra long, 2XL, short, etc. and wire size such as fine wire, extra heavy, 2X heavy, etc. Single, double and triple hooks artificial lures fly Hooks are designed as either single hooks‚Äîa single eye, shank and point; double hooks‚Äîa single eye merged with two shanks and points; or triple‚Äîa single eye merged with three shanks and three evenly spaced points. Double hooks are formed from a single piece of wire and may or may not have their shanks brazed together for strength. Treble hooks are formed by adding a single eyeless hook to a double hook and brazing all three shanks together. Double hooks are used on some artificial lures and are a traditional fly hook for Atlantic Salmon flies, but are otherwise fairly uncommon. Treble hooks are used on all sorts of artificial lures as well as for a wide variety of bait applications. Bait hook shapes and names Bait hook shapes and names include the Salmon Egg, Beak, O'Shaughnessy, Baitholder, Shark Hook, Aberdeen, Carlisle, Carp Hook, Tuna Circle, Offset Worm, Circle Hook, suicide hook, Long Shank, Short Shank, J Hook, Octopus Hook and Big Game Jobu hooks. Fly hook shapes and names Fly hook shapes include Sproat, Sneck, Limerick, Kendal, Viking, Captain Hamilton, Barleet, Swimming Nymph, Bend Back, Model Perfect, Keel, and Kink-shank. =Points and barbs= The hook point is probably the most important part of the hook. It is the point that must penetrate fish flesh and secure the fish. The profile of the hook point and its length influence how well the point penetrates. The barb influences how far the point penetrates, how much pressure is required to penetrate and ultimately the holding power of the hook. Hook points are mechanically (ground) or chemically sharpened. Some hooks are barbless. Historically, many ancient fish hooks were barbless, but today a barbless hook is used to make hook removal and fish release less stressful on the fish. Hook points are also described relative to their offset from the hook shank. A kirbed hook point is offset to the left, a straight point has no offset and a reversed point is offset to the right. A hook in a finger. Either surgery or pushing the hook through the finger are the least destructive methods to remove a barbed fishing hook. Care needs to be taken when handling hooks as they can 'hook' the user. If a hook goes in deep enough below the barb, pulling the hook out will tear the flesh. There are three methods to remove a hook. The first is by cutting the flesh to remove it. The second is to cut the eye of the hook off and then push the remainder of the hook through the flesh and the third is to place pressure on the shank towards the flesh which pulls the barb into the now oval hole then push the hook out the way it came in. Hook point types Hook points are commonly referred to by these names: needle point, rolled-in, hollow, spear, beak, mini-barb, semi-dropped and knife edge. Some other hook point names are used for branding by manufacturers. =Eyes= Up-turned, Down-turned and Straight Hook Eyes The eye of a hook, although some hooks are technically eyeless, is the point where the hook is connected to the line. Hook eye design is usually optimized for either strength, weight and/or presentation. There are different types of eyes to the hooks. Typical eye types include the ring or ball eye, a brazed eye-the eye is fully closed, a tapered eye to reduce weight, a looped eye‚Äîtraditional on Atlantic Salmon flies, needle eyes, and spade end‚Äîno eye at all, but a flattened area to allow secure snelling of the leader to the hook. Hook eyes can also be positioned one of three ways on the shank‚Äîup turned, down turned or straight. =Size= There are no internationally recognized standards for hooks and thus size is somewhat inconsistent between manufacturers. However, within a manufacturer's range of hooks, hook sizes are consistent. Hook sizes generally are referred to by a numbering system that places the size 1 hook in the middle of the size range. Smaller hooks are referenced by larger whole numbers (e.g. 1, 2, 3...). Larger hooks are referenced by increasing whole numbers followed by a slash and a zero (e.g. 1/0 (one aught), 2/0, 3/0...) as their size increases. The numbers represent relative sizes, normally associated with the gap (the distance from the point tip to the shank). The smallest size available is 32 and largest 20/0.

It lies south of Nelson in the South Island, close to the southern extremity of Tasman Bay. The town, first settled by Europeans in 1842, was named in 1854 after the town of Richmond on Thames near London. The town has an estimated population of as of . Although most of Richmond lies outside the boundaries of Nelson City, it is informally considered by the locals as part of Greater Nelson or the \\"Top of the South\\". The two unitary authorities (Nelson and Tasman) co-operate for tourism-marketing purposes via \\"Latitude Nelson\\". Richmond forms part of the Nelson parliamentary electorate. History During the period 1853 to 1876, the Richmond urban area was administered as part of Nelson Province. With the Abolition of Provinces Act 1876, Waimea County was created, effective in January 1877. Richmond was included in the Waimea County boundaries, and served as the administrative headquarters of the county. In 1891, the administrative authority for the urban area of Richmond was transferred from Waimea County to the Richmond Borough Council. Richmond Borough existed until the 1989 local government reforms, when the Tasman District was formed through the amalgamation of the Richmond Borough, Golden Bay County, Murchison County and Waimea County administrative areas. Demographics The Richmond urban area had a population of 15,282 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 1,902 people (14.2%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 2,865 people (23.1%) since the 2006 census. There were 7,341 males and 7,944 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.92 males per female.

The multiple periods of Pax Sinica, when taken together, amounted to a length of approximately two thousand years. The first Pax Sinica of the Eastern world emerged during the rule of the Han dynasty and coincided with the Pax Romana of the Western world led by the Roman Empire. It stimulated long-distance travel and trade in Eurasian history. Both the first Pax Sinica and the Pax Romana eroded at circa AD 200.  Periods of historical Pax Sinica  = Han dynasty = The first period of Pax Sinica came into being during the Han dynasty of China. Domestically, the power of the emperor was consolidated following the devastation of the feudal system. The Rule of Wen and Jing and the Rule of Ming and Zhang were periods of societal stability and economic prosperity. Externally, the Han dynasty neutralized the threat posed by the nomadic Xiongnu following a series of wars. The boundaries of China was extended into what is modern-day western Xinjiang, South Korea (near Seoul), and Vietnam (around Hu·∫ø).Grousset (1964). p. 60. The Silk Road emerged as a major route that connected the East and the West after the Han diplomat Zhang Qian established contact with the numerous Central Asian tribes, thus facilitating commerce and cultural exchanges.Grousset (1964). p. 85. The Pax Sinica established by the Han dynasty is often compared to the Pax Romana of the Roman Empire. The Pax Sinica of the Han dynasty ended following decades of internal turmoil that later led to the downfall of the Han dynasty and a period of fragmentation in Chinese history. = Tang dynasty = The Tang dynasty was one of the golden ages in Chinese history and presided over another period of Pax Sinica. The Tang capital, Chang'an, was a major economic and cultural hub, and was the world's largest urban settlement at the time. The Silk Road facilitated economic and cultural exchanges between China and the outside world, with Persians and Sogdians among those who benefited the most from such exchanges with China. In the north, the First Turkic Khaganate was defeated and annexed; in the west, the Tang dynasty extended its control as far as modern-day Afghanistan and the Aral Sea; in the east, Tang control reached Sakhalin. During its peak, the Tang dynasty maintained hegemony over 72 tributary states. During this period, Chinese culture was revitalized and became more diverse and cosmopolitan. The amount of interaction between China and Japan increased; Chinese influence on Japanese culture and politics became more prominent since the Tang dynasty. = Yuan dynasty = The Yuan dynasty was an imperial dynasty of China ruled by ethnic Mongol and was the main constituent part of the Mongol Empire. While the Yuan dynasty is often considered a legitimate Chinese dynasty that bore the Mandate of Heaven, historians usually classify this period of peace under the Pax Mongolica. = Ming dynasty = The Ming dynasty of China presided over another period of Pax Sinica. This period saw the formal institutionalization of the Chinese tributary system, illustrating the great political power of China at the time. The seven maritime expeditions led by Zheng He projected the imperial power of the Ming dynasty across Southeast Asia, South Asia, the Middle East, and East Africa. During this period, China also exerted a great amount of influence on the culture and politics of Korea. = Qing dynasty = The Qing dynasty of China heralded another period of Pax Sinica. At its peak, it ruled over the fourth largest empire territorially, constituting 9.87 per cent of the world's total land area. The High Qing era was a period of sustained peace, economic prosperity and territorial expansion. The multicultural and multiethnic nature of the Qing dynasty was fundamental to the subsequent formation of the modern nationalist concept of Zhonghua minzu. As the rulers of the Qing dynasty were ethnic Manchu, this period of peace is also sometimes known as \\"Pax Manjurica\\".Horner (2010). p. 54.Smolnikov (2018). p. 141.

Grand Duke Kirill followed a career in the Russian navy serving for 20 years in the Naval Guards. He took part in the Russo-Japanese War, barely surviving the sinking of the battleship at Port Arthur in April 1904. In 1905, he married his paternal first cousin, Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, who both defied Nicholas II by not obtaining his consent. They had two daughters and settled in Paris before they were allowed to visit Russia in 1909. In 1910 they moved to Russia, where Nicholas recognised their marriage. In World War I, Grand Duke Kirill was appointed Commander of the Naval Depot of the Guards in 1915. He achieved the rank of rear admiral in the Imperial Navy in 1916. During the February Revolution of 1917, Kirill marched to the Tauride Palace at the head of the Naval Guards and swore allegiance to the Russian Provisional Government. During the rule of the Provisional Governmental in the summer 1917, Kirill escaped to Finland, where his wife gave birth to the couple's only son. In exile, they lived for some years among his wife's relatives in Germany and, from the late 1920s, on an estate they bought in Saint-Briac, France. With the murder of his cousins Nicholas II and Grand Duke Michael, Kirill became the head of the Imperial Family of Russia and, as next in line to the throne, as the Guardian of the Throne in 1924. Kirill proclaimed himself emperor-in-exile in 1926. He worked for the restoration of the monarchy from exile for the rest of his life, but his claims were contested by some factions of the monarchists in a division that continues today. He wrote a book of memoirs, My Life in Russia's Service, which was published after his death. His granddaughter, Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna, is the current claimant to the House of Romanov. Early life Kirill (centre) with his brothers Andrei (left) and Boris (right) Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich of Russia was born on in Tsarskoye Selo, at his parents' country residence, the Vladimir Villa.Korneva & Cheboksarova, Grand Duchess Marie Pavlovna, p. 53. His father was Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich, the third son of Tsar Alexander II of Russia. His mother was Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna, n√©e Duchess Marie Alexandrine of Mecklenburg. As a grandson in the male line to a Russian Tsar, he was titled Grand Duke, with the style Imperial Highness. Kirill's parents, wealthy and sophisticated, were influential figures in Russian society. Grand Duke Vladimir was cultured and a great patron of the arts, while Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna was a renowned hostess in the Imperial capital.Sullivan, A Fatal Passion, p. 167‚Äì168 Both had imposing personalities and left a big imprint in the lives of Kirill and his siblings.Korneva & Cheboksarova, Grand Duchess Marie Pavlovna, p. 54. Grand Duke Kirill was six months old when his eldest brother, Alexander, died in childhood.Sullivan, A Fatal Passion, p. 168. He also had three younger siblings: Boris, Andrei, and Elena. The four surviving children were close to each other and to their parents, who were devoted to them. Kirill Vladimirovich grew up between his parents' residence in St Peterburg, the Vladimir Palace, and their country retreat, the Vladimir Villa in Tsarkoe Selo.Sullivan, A Fatal Passion, p. 169 Until he was fourteen years of age, Grand Duke Kirill was educated at home by private tutors. His education was supervised by General Alexander Daller, a retired artillery officer. He received military training and religion instruction, and learned the languages spoken by the Romanovs: Russian, English, French and German. During breaks from his daily lessons, he trained in a gym with his brothers at the Vladimir Palace. He traveled extensively with his parents visiting many European countries, including Spain.Sullivan, A Fatal Passion, p. 170. A love for music and carpentry work remained in him for the rest of his life. In 1911 he designed a propeller-driven sled that is considered to be one of the predecessors of the Aerosani.

Januar 1911, Page 46, online: Naval career From an early age, Grand Duke Kirill had a love for the sea and his parents encouraged him to follow a career in the Imperial Navy. At age fifteen, in the autumn 1891, he began his training for the naval college.Sullivan, A Fatal Passion, p. 170. He began his naval career as a midshipman on the ship Moriak in the summer of 1892.Sullivan, A Fatal Passion, p. 171. He returned to his home in Tsarkoe Selo in the winter 1892 and spent the following year studying for his examinations at the naval college.Sullivan, A Fatal Passion, p. 172. Between the summer 1893 and the autumn 1893, he was back at sea training in the ship Prince Pojarsky.Sullivan, A Fatal Passion, p. 172. After joining his father on a long trip to Spain, in the summer 1894, he joined his third training ship, the frigate Vovin.Sullivan, A Fatal Passion, p. 172. He concluded his training on the ship Vernyl on the Baltic sea in the summer of 1895.Sullivan, A Fatal Passion, p. 173. Grand Duke Kirill's uncle, Tsar Alexander III, died on and Kirill's cousin, Nicholas II, became the new Tsar. During the coronation festivities in Moscow, Kirill fell in love with his paternal first cousin, Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. They flirted with each other at the balls and celebrations, but Victoria Melita was already married to Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse, the only brother of Tsarina Alexandra. After graduating from the Sea Cadet Corps and Nikolaev Naval Academy, on 1 January 1904, Kirill was promoted to Chief of Staff to the Russian Pacific Fleet in the Imperial Russian Navy. With the start of the Russo-Japanese War, he was assigned to serve as First Officer on the battleship , but the ship was blown up by a Japanese mine at Port Arthur in April 1904. Kirill barely escaped with his life, and was invalided out of the service suffering from burns, back injuries and shell shock. Marriage and children Kirill with his wife Victoria and their two daughters Marie and Kira Grand Duke Kirill married his first cousin, Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha on 8 October 1905 without any consent from Tsar Nicholas II. Victoria's father was Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the second eldest son of Queen Victoria. Victoria's mother was Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia, a daughter of Tsar Alexander II and Kirill's paternal aunt. The marriage caused a scandal in the courts of European royalty as Princess Victoria was divorced from her first husband, Grand Duke Ernst Ludwig of Hesse, also her first cousin. The Grand Duke of Hesse's sister was Tsarina Alexandra Fyodorovna, the wife of Nicholas II. The Tsarina already disliked her former sister-in-law and first cousin, being instrumental in leading the opposition to the marriage in the Russian court. She was not alone in her opposition. Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna was also appalled at the effrontery of Kirill's marriage. Shortly after Kirill's return to Russia, the Tsar stripped Kirill of his imperial allowance and title of Imperial Highness, his honours and decorations, his position in the navy and then banished him from Russia. Kirill's marriage was in open defiance of the Russian Orthodox Church ruling that first cousins were not permitted to marry. Kirill knew that the Tsar's brother Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich had been forbidden to marry his first cousin, Princess Beatrice of Edinburgh and Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. In 1908, after the death of Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich had put Kirill third in the line of succession to the Imperial Throne, Nicholas II restored Kirill to his rank of Captain in the Imperial Russian Navy and his position as aide de camp to the emperor. He was given the title Grand Duke of Russia and from then on his wife was styled as Her Imperial Highness Grand Duchess Viktoria Feodorovna. From 1909‚Äì1912, Kirill served on the cruiser and was its captain in 1912. In 1913, he joined the Maritime Division of the Imperial Guard and was made Commander of the Naval Guards in 1915. Grand Duke Kirill and Princess Victoria Melita had three children: *Grand Duchess Maria Kirillovna of Russia (2 February 1907-27 October 1951) married Friedrich Karl, Prince of Leiningen on 25 November 1925. They have seven children. *Grand Duchess Kira Kirillovna of Russia (9 May 1909-8 September 1967) married Louis Ferdinand, Prince of Prussia on 31 October 1938. They have seven children. *Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich of Russia (30 August 1917-21 April 1992) married Princess Leonida Georgievna Bagration-Moukhransky on 13 August 1948. They have one daughter. All the children were born to the rank of Prince and Princess of Russia, not entitled to the rank of Grand Duke or Grand Duchess as they were not children or grandchildren in the male line of a Russian Emperor according to the Imperial Family Statutes that became law under Tsar Alexander III. In accordance with Imperial statutes, Kirill raised his children to the rank of Grand Duke and Grand Duchess after assuming the position of senior male of the Romanov family, and Head of the Imperial House. This elevation was openly denounced by Grand Duke Nicholas Nicolaevich when he published a private letter of the Dowager Empress in 1924 in which she stated that Kirill's assumption of the position was \\"premature.\\" The Dowager Empress believed that her sons and grandsons might still be alive in Russia. Grand Duke Kirill wrote to Grand Duchess Xenia \\"Nothing can be compared to what I shall now have to endure on this account, and I know full well I can expect no mercy from all the malicious attacks and accusations of vanity.\\"Romanov, Kirill V. \\"My Life in Russia's Service,\\" London: Seleyn & Blount, 1939., p.222. Revolution During the February Revolution of 1917, Kirill marched to the Tauride Palace at the head of the Garde Equipage (Marine Guard) to swear allegiance to the Russian Provisional Government, wearing a red band on his uniform. Kirill had authorised the flying of a red flag over his palace on Glinka Street in Petrograd and in correspondence with a Romanov relative claimed credit for \\"saving the situation by my recognition of the Provisional Government\\". It is probable that he had hoped that by ingratiating himself with the Provisional Government he would be declared regent after Nicholas II was made to abdicate.Crawford, Rosemary and Donald Michael and Natasha: The Life and Love of the Last Tsar of Russia Weidenfeld & Nicolson (1997) p.276. In June 1917 Kirill and Victoria moved to Finland and then escaped to Coburg, Germany in 1920. The exiled family subsequently moved to a small residence in the tiny French fishing village of St. Briac. Life abroad Grand Duke Kirill with his wife Grand Duchess Victoria and children Kira and Vladimir. After a London court order in July 1924 recognized Grand Duke Michael to be legally dead, Kirill first declared himself \\"Guardian of the Throne\\" on 8 August 1924 and then on 31 August 1924 he assumed the title Emperor of all the Russias. By the laws of the Russian Empire he was the heir to the throne. However, his claim caused division within the family; his principal rival, and the only one to reject his claim was Grand Duke Nicholas. In 1926 at a (Russian) monarchists congress in Paris the delegates voted to recognize Grand Duke Nicholas as their leader; however, with Nicholas's death in 1929 Kirill became the undisputed leader of the monarchists.Shain, Yossi The Frontier of Loyalty: Political Exiles in the Age of the Nation-State University of Michigan Press (2005) p.69. After claiming the throne, Kirill became known as the \\"Soviet Tsar\\" because in the event of a restoration of the monarchy, he intended to keep some of the features of the Soviet regime. While living in exile, he was supported by some emigres who styled themselves \\"legitimists\\" (legitimisti, in Russian –ª–µ–≥–∏—Ç–∏–º–∏—Å—Ç—ã), underlining the \\"legitimacy\\" of Kirill's succession. The opponents of Kirill were known as the \\"un-predetermined\\" (nepredreshentsi, in Russian –Ω–µ–ø—Ä–µ–¥—Ä–µ—à–µ–Ω—Ü—ã); they believed that in the wake of the radical revolutionary events that the convening of a Zemsky Sobor was necessary in order to choose a new monarch for Russia. Kirill found his strongest support among a group of legitimists known as the Mladorossi, a Russian emigre monarchist organization that ultimately became heavily influenced by fascism ‚Äì although it distanced itself from other fascist movements. The organization began to exhibit pro-Soviet sympathies, arguing that the monarchy and the Soviet Bolshevik system could peacefully coexist (their slogan being \\"Tsar and the Soviets\\", a socialist version of the traditional \\"Tsar and People\\" ). Kirill became more wary of the organization when he learned that its founder, Alexander Kazem-Bek, was spotted meeting with an OGPU agent. Kirill accepted Kazem-Bek's voluntary resignation. Kirill was succeeded by his son Vladimir Kirillovich who styled himself \\"Grand Duke and head of the Russian Imperial House.\\" Kirill was buried at the ducal mausoleum at ', Coburg. Following the fall of the Soviet Union, the remains of Kirill and his spouse were transferred from Coburg to the Grand Ducal Mausoleum of the Peter and Paul Fortress in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1995 after negotiations conducted by his granddaughter Maria Vladimirovna.

It is located at the southern end of the Tongariro National Park, close to the southwestern slopes of the active volcano Mount Ruapehu. Located within the Manawat≈´-Whanganui region, the town is northeast of Whanganui and west of Waiouru. The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of \\"place of care\\" for . A rural service town known as New Zealand's Carrot Capital, Ohakune is a popular base in winter for skiers using the ski fields (particularly Turoa) of nearby Mount Ruapehu and in summer for trampers hiking the Tongariro Alpine Crossing. History and culture =Pre-European history= Historically, the lands to the south and west of Mount Ruapehu were inhabited by the MƒÅori of the NgƒÅti Rangi iwi. The meaning of the MƒÅori language name ≈åhakune is \\"the place of\\" (≈å) \\"the careful ones\\" (hakune). Around the middle of the seventeenth century a marae at Rangataua, a small town about 3 miles south-east of Ohakune, was attacked and the inhabitants were driven from their homes by raiders from the NgƒÅti Raukawa, an iwi from farther east in Manawatu. Around 75 of the village's population were slain and the dozen or so survivors fled to Maungarongo and established a pƒÅ on the present site of the town of Ohakune. =European settlement= In 1883, the first engineering reconnaissance commenced for the Marton‚ÄîTe Awamutu section of the North Island Main Trunk Railway and a base was established upon the present site of Ohakune, and soon became a permanent camp for railway and road construction workers. Settlement of the town is considered to have commenced in the early 1890s and by March 1908 the railway line had reached Ohakune. The period of railway construction activities was followed quickly by intensive timber milling; as the forest was cleared, cattle and sheep were introduced and farming progressed. Ohakune was constituted a town district in August 1908 and in November 1911 attained borough status. =Recent history= In 2015, the town received national publicity after schools were placed in lockdown due to the police being shot at and rammed. =Marae= Ohakune has two marae. MaungƒÅrongo Marae and Tikaraina Ringapoto or Ko Te Kingi o Te MaungƒÅrongo meeting house is a meeting place of the NgƒÅti Rangi hap≈´ of NgƒÅti Tui-o-Nuku. NgƒÅ M≈çkai Marae and Whakarongo meeting house are a meeting place of the NgƒÅti Rangi hap≈´ of NgƒÅti Tongaiti. In October 2020, the Government committed $836,930 from the Provincial Growth Fund to upgrade a cluster of 7 marae, including MaungƒÅrongo Marae, creating 95 jobs. Facilities Ohakune has facilities for snow sports, trout fishing, mountain biking, tramping and bushwalking. www.visitohakune.com =Landmarks= 289x289px On the eastern edge of the town there is a large replica of a carrot, known as \\"The Big Carrot\\". This is reputedly the world's largest model carrot, and was originally constructed as a prop for a television advertisement for the ANZ Bank in the early 1980s. After filming was complete, the carrot was donated to the town in recognition of the area's reputation as the source of a high proportion of New Zealand's carrots, and installed in its current position in 1984. In the 1980s and '90s Ohakune was home to the Weather Rock, a local landmark in Thames Street popular with tourists for photographs; the rock used to \\"forecast\\" current weather conditions with a sign listing sayings such as \\"If rock is hot - sunny\\", \\"If rock is wet - raining\\", etc., and appropriately for the region, \\"If rock is bouncing - earthquake\\". The site is currently vacant. =Health and welfare= In 2015 Ohakune had a dental clinic, pharmacy, fire station, police station, ambulance station, social welfare branch, churches, a marae with a district nurse, gymnasium, and a health shuttle for outpatient care at Whanganui Hospital 110 km away. The nearest medical centre with GP, nurses and physiotherapist is 11 km to the west, at Raetihi. =Shopping and services= Ohakune has the usual range of shops and services found within a typical small New Zealand town. =Sporting clubs= Ohakune has a number of clubs and is home to the Ruapehu Rugby & Sports Club. Activities and events =Winter activities= Ohakune provides easy access to the nearby ski fields of Mount Ruapehu; the large commercials ski resorts of Turoa (the closest resort to Ohakune) and Whakapapa, and well as the small club field Tukino. Various outlets for clothing and ski hire, as well as purchasing lift tickets, are available in the town. Ohakune is the home of the Ski FM Network hosted by 91.8 FM Ruapehu/Turoa, a Central North Island radio station that has been in operation for more than 25 years providing local information regarding mountain conditions in both winter and summer. During the winter it is the \\"information desk\\" and source of all things snow for the region. During the summer its website (along with the 0800 number) become a hub for summer tourists, and locals alike, for up-to-the-minute information. =Summer activities= Ohakune caters for various summer activities, and provides access for trampers hiking the Tongariro Alpine Crossing. Mountain bikes are available for hire at various outlets in town. Various water activities are available on the nearby rivers, with jet boating on the Whanganui River and rafting available along the Whanganui, Rangitikei and Tongariro rivers. Trout fishing is available in nearby lakes and rivers, including the world-famous Tongariro River. Activities can be booked at the Ruapehu i-SITE. The Bridge to Nowhere in the Whanganui National Park located between Okakune and Whanganui is a popular destination for trampers and mountain bikers. =Events= In recent years the number of events hosted by Ohakune has increased, with both the Big Mountain Short Film Festival and Ohakune Mardi Gras featuring on the calendar. The Mardi Gras is both a ski party and celebration of winter, and includes musicians, stalls and rides.

Local services to Taup≈ç via the towns of National Park and Turangi are operated by a private shuttle service, the Alpine Hot Bus. =Trains= The North Island Main Trunk Railway provides passenger and freight rail services to Ohakune. The railway station is located off Thames Street in the Ohakune Junction area, approximately 2.5 kilometres from Clyde Street in the centre of town. Passenger services are provided by the national operator KiwiRail. The Northern Explorer is a non-daily service operating between Auckland and Wellington. The journey to/from Auckland crosses the famous Raurimu Spiral. From 18 December 1917 until 1 January 1968, Ohakune was also the junction for the Raetihi Branch, a branch line railway to Raetihi. A truss bridge formerly used by this branch still stands near the Big Carrot. Seventeen kilometres to the east of the town is the Tangiwai Bridge, site of New Zealand's worst railway accident, the Tangiwai Disaster, on 24 December 1953. Trivia A mock-romantic song from the mid-1960s called September in Ohakune was recorded by Peter Harcourt on an LP called Land of the Long White Shroud The world's first commercial bungy jumping site was established just outside Ohakune at the old railway viaduct. This was operated during the 1980s until the bridge became too unsafe to continue operations. This bridge is now restored and a highlight of the 'Old Coach Road' walk/bikeway. Ohakune railway station has the second highest elevation of any operating railway station in New Zealand behind National Park Railway Station; a sign on the platform side of the station building lists its height at 2,029 feet (618.4 metres) above sea level.

Background On September 11, 2001 a series of coordinated terrorist attacks against the United States killed approximately 3000 people. These attacks appear to have been carried out by a small group of individuals who formed part of the al-Qaida network: Islamists without formal backing from any state (though there were and are suspicions that Al-Qaida was aided and funded by several Arab/Muslim countries). Following them U.S. president George W. Bush declared a campaign with the stated aim of defeating terrorism which he called the \\"War on Terrorism\\". Although which of his programs constitute part of this \\"war\\" have has never been formally articulated, the term appears to embraces at least two major Bush administration initiatives: a set of changes to U.S. criminal law and immigration law (most notably through the USA PATRIOT Act) and the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan and the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The term may also embrace such related matters as the creation of a Department of Homeland Security. Many of those on the left and others who would come to oppose the War on Terrorism did not believe that it was really a response to the terrorist attacks. They point to the Project for the New American Century as proof that Bush was merely using the atrocities as an excuse to put the Imperialist plans of the neoconservatives into action. They also point to what they perceive as the ineffectiveness of Bush's strategy for actually reducing terrorism and the lack of any link between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaida. =Immediate reaction to the attacks= The immediate, worldwide reaction to the attacks was widely described at the time as \\"shock\\". No national government claimed responsibility or connection to the attacks. Indeed, the governments most associated with Islamism sought to distance themselves from the attacks. Wakeel Ahmed Mutawakel, the foreign minister of Afghanistan's then-ruling Taliban government, declared, \\"We denounce this terrorist attack, whoever is behind it.\\" Mohammad Khatami, the Iranian president, said he felt \\"deep regret and sympathy with the victims.\\" Shaykh Abdul Aziz al-Ashaikh, Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia and Chairman of the Senior Ulama, said, \\"Hijacking planes, terrorizing innocent people and shedding blood constitute a form of injustice that can not be tolerated by Islam, which views them as gross crimes and sinful acts.\\" Palestinian President Yasser Arafat said, \\"We completely condemn this serious operation... We were completely shocked...\\" Many, though, considered those reactions as hypocrisy, since several Arab and Muslim states encourage anti-Americanism and many newspapers in the Arab world‚Äîfor example the Islamist opposition press in Egypt‚Äîopenly celebrated the September 11 attacks. Moreover, states like Iran and Syria were known for long-year funding of terrorist networks such as Hezbollah, Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Also, Al-Qaida training camps were operating undisturbed in Afghanistan and the organization held bank accounts in Saudi Arabia. On the left, condemnation of the attacks was equally general, although often including (even in the days immediately after the attack) condemnation of ostensibly related aspects of U.S. policies. Noam Chomsky's statement in the immediate wake of the attacks begins by condemning this \\"major atrocit[y]\\" and \\"horrendous crime\\", but also by contextualizing it in terms of the Clinton-era U.S. attack on the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory and prefiguring what would be a widespread concern for the left worldwide: \\"...the crime is a gift to the hard jingoist right, those who hope to use force to control their domains.\\" Similarly, from Vijay Prashad, \\"The attacks must be condemned without reservation. But we must be certain to recognize that these are probably the work of frustrated and alienated human beings hemmed in by forces that are anonymous and that could only be embodied by these structures.\\" Martin Woollacott, writing in The Guardian, called the attacks, \\"above all a stupendous crime\\", but also wrote, \\"America's best defence against terrorism originating from abroad remains the existence of governments and societies more or less satisfied with American even-handedness on issues which are important to them. Plainly, this is furthest from the case in the Muslim world.\\" Elected officials generally identified as being on the U.S. \\"left\\" also joined in strongly condemning the attacks, in this case almost universally without pointing out a context. For example, the day after the attack, Senator Edward Kennedy described the attack as \\"vicious and horrifying... acts of unspeakable cruelty... a massive tragedy for America\\", and commended President Bush for \\"his strong statement... about finding and punishing the perpetrators of this atrocity.\\" Three days after the attacks, Congress passed a resolution authorizing President Bush to use force against \\"those responsible\\". The Senate voted 98‚Äì0, the House 420‚Äì1, with only Barbara Lee (D-California) dissenting. In a lengthy interview explaining her dissent, Lee pointed to her professional training as a social worker and remarked, \\"Right now, we're dealing with recovery, and we're dealing with mourning, and there's no way... [we should]... deal with decisions that could escalate violence and spiral out of control.\\" =An anti-war movement forms= Within days of the September 11 events, it was widely agreed that the attacks were carried out by al-Qaida, although , al-Qaida responsibility for the attacks may have been a minority view in majority-Muslim countries, though not among Muslims in the U.S. A small segment of the population also calls this belief into question. A much larger segment (though still a minority) of the left (both in the U.S. and elsewhere) concurred with the clear majority of Muslims that a military attack on Afghanistan was not the correct answer to the September 11 events. This anti-war view was even more widespread among both leftists and Muslims with respect to the later attack on Iraq. The left was somewhat fragmented with respect to the invasion of Afghanistan. U.S. Representative Dennis Kucinich, who had opposed the Kosovo War and would soon oppose the invasion of Iraq, voted to authorize military action against Afghanistan, although he would later characterize it as a \\"disaster\\", a \\"nightmare\\", and \\"counterproductive\\". U.S. Representative Cynthia McKinney, speaking on September 24, acknowledged that \\"We must find and hold accountable all those who perpetrated those most terrible crimes against our nation and its people\\", but denounced what she saw as impending \\"suspensions of fundamental civil liberties\\" and said that she was \\"greatly concerned that we are about to engage in an extremely hazardous military campaign of unknown duration, with unrealistic objectives and perhaps even ultimately harmful long-term consequences for our nation\\", adding, \\"Already there is growing disquiet in the Muslim world that the U.S. is poised to turn its terrorist campaign into a war against Islam.\\" Indian leftist writer Arundhati Roy, writing on September 29, strongly condemned both the attackers who had \\"blown a hole in the world as we knew it\\" and Bush for reacting by going to war against Afghanistan: \\"President Bush's ultimatum to the people of the world ‚Äì 'If you're not with us, you're against us' ‚Äì is a piece of presumptuous arrogance. It's not a choice that people want to, need to, or should have to make.\\" Within a few weeks after September 11, it became clear that two major prongs of the Bush administration's \\"war on terrorism\\" were to be a set of changes to U.S. criminal law and immigration law and an invasion of Afghanistan. An international anti-war movement began to arise; in the U.S. and other countries whose governments enacted legislation analogous to the PATRIOT act, it was equally a movement in protest of what were perceived on the left to be assaults on civil liberties and immigrant rights. This movement constituted a loose coalition of groups united in their opposition to U.S. military campaigns in the Middle East. Most prominent in the ranks of the movement were leftists; pacifists and others with longtime associations with global peace movements; and Arabs and Muslims, including, but by no means limited to, Islamists. Most commentary focuses on the \\"anti-war movement\\" in the singular, although in many ways it could be argued that there is a plurality of different anti-war movements, who may not have anything in common with each other beyond their shared opposition to U.S. foreign policy. The movement (or movements) included an enormous variety of groups and individuals that could not be categorised as \\"left\\" in any conventional terms, who had a variety of reasons for opposition to the invasion of Afghanistan and later of Iraq. In addition to the many non-leftist Arabs and Muslims in the movement, there were also European nationalists uncomfortable with U.S. unilateralism (their numbers would greatly increase in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq). There was also an uneasy relationship with explicitly antisemitic groups who charged that the war was being waged on behalf of Israel; with the few, small right-wing anti-war groups; and with certain political fringe groups, such as the followers of Lyndon LaRouche. These latter groups sometimes participated in the same demonstrations with other opponents of the war, but seldom were actively involved in any of the same organized coalitions. Almost no one denied the connection between the Afghanistan's Taliban government and al- Qaida. However, various leftists opposed the Afghanistan invasion and the subsequent invasion of Iraq on the following grounds: pacifism; belief that the war was illegal under international law; opposition to perceived U.S. imperialism; disbelief (especially in the case of Iraq) in the sincerity of the U.S.'s stated war aims of counter-terrorism and the spread of political freedom; belief that the wars were motivated by neocolonialism and petroleum politics; and, in a few cases, denial of al-Qaida's responsibility for the September 11 attacks. Another argument against the Afghanistan invasion was that war would bring unnecessary suffering on the people of Afghanistan and that it was not the most effective way to dislodge or isolate al-Qaida: that in fact it would inflate their importance and gain them recruits. Similarly, in the case of the later invasion of Iraq, many felt that Iraq was not a threat to the United States and that a preemptive attack was morally wrong though Saddaam Hussein was widely seen as a violent dictator. Many people condemned the latter war because they doubted U.S. and other claims about Saddam's relation to al-Qaida, about his possession of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs), and about the effectiveness of war as a means of containing WMDs, or because of the lack of United Nations support for war. Many Islamists and Arabs, and a few leftists, saw the military campaigns as battles in a religious war‚Äîa crusade‚Äîagainst Islam. This was the obverse of the ideas expressed, for example, by Samuel P. Huntington in The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order. However this view was mostly rejected by those on the left, who generally rejected the doctrine that the world is divvied up in to civilisations with fundamentally opposed cultures. In the United Kingdom, the Stop the War Coalition was formed within weeks of the 9/11 attacks. The coalition rallied political groups around three main principles: condemnation and rejection of both the War on Terrorism and the 9/11 attacks ; opposition to the erosion of civil rights and the racist backlash that followed 9/11 ; unity of the constituent groups in their aim to build a mass-movement to prevent wars in the context of the War on Terrorism, but diversity in the sense that constituent groups were free to develop their own political analysis and local activities. Over the next two years, the Stop the War Coalition organised a series of mass demonstrations in London, together with the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and the Muslim Association of Britain, culminating in the largest demonstration in British history on 15. February 2003, with 1‚Äì2 million demonstrators. Although the Stop the War Coalition includes a broad range of political groups, it is often criticised because of the strong influence of the Socialist Workers Party.  Anti-war organizations and rallies The anti-war movement has organized massive anti- war rallies, in opposition to the War on Terrorism. Some of the most prominent organizations began by opposing the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan. Others formed only after the Afghanistan invasion and after Bush's January 29, 2002 State of the Union Address was widely seen on the left as threatening confrontation with Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, which Bush referred to collectively as an \\"axis of evil\\". =Left and anti-war in the U.S.= The most prominent U.S.-based movement groups are Act Now to Stop War and End Racism (ANSWER), Not in Our Name (NION), and United for Peace and Justice (UFPJ). ANSWER was one of the first U.S. left groups to form after the September 11 attacks in order to express dissent from the nascent \\"War on Terror\\". With the U.S. left divided on the merits of military action against the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, the International Action Center (IAC), a group founded in 1992 by former U.S. attorney general Ramsey Clark and perceived as closely tied to the Workers World Party. Drawing on that party's tight organization, ANSWER attracted an estimated 8,000 people to their first major action, an \\"Anti-War, Anti-Racist\\" rally and march in Washington, D.C., primarily in protest of the then impending invasion of Afghanistan. This rally occurred on September 29, 2001, a mere 18 days after the September 11 attacks. This rally happened several hours after the first national protest against the war, an unpermitted march of 2,000 through the streets of Washington which had been organized by the Anti-Capitalist Convergence. Notwithstanding their organizational ability, Workers World's role in ANSWER and ANSWER's role in the movement were (and are) controversial, both on the left and elsewhere. In a typical example of a critique from within the left, Michael Albert and Stephen R. Shalom writing on October 24, 2002 for Z, about a then-impending nationwide set of demonstrations (called by ANSWER), begin their discussion with a scathing critique of the views of Workers World, IAC, and (by implication) ANSWER. Describing IAC as an \\"extremely energetic antiwar group\\" and laying out its relationship to ANSWER, Clark, and Workers World (which they call \\"WWP\\"), they declare, \\"WWP holds many views that we find abhorrent. It considers North Korea 'socialist Korea'... a fantastic distortion of the reality of one of the most rigid dictatorships in the world. IAC expresses its solidarity with Slobodan Milosevic. ... [T]o champion Milosevic is grotesque. The ANSWER website provides an IAC backgrounder on Afghanistan that refers to the dictatorial government that took power in that country in 1978 as 'socialist' and says of the Soviet invasion the next year: the 'USSR intervened militarily at the behest of the Afghani revolutionary government'... In none of IAC's considerable resources on the current Iraq crisis is there a single negative word about Saddam Hussein. There is no mention that he is a ruthless dictator. (This omission is not surprising, given their inability to detect any problem of dictatorship with the Soviet- backed regime in Afghanistan.)...\\" Albert and Shalom go on to discuss the quandary this presents for people like them opposed to the war: \\"If there were another large demonstration organized by forces more compatible with the kinds of politics espoused by other antiwar activists, including ourselves, then we would urge people to prefer that one. And there is no doubt we should be working to build alternative organizational structures for the antiwar movement that are not dominated by IAC. But at the moment the ANSWER demonstration is the only show in town.\\" Finally, they discuss how they expect these politics will and will not affect the demonstration: \\"IAC demonstrations... have programs skewed in the direction of IAC politics, but without excluding alternative voices. In general, the IAC speakers will not be offensive so much for what they say, but for what they don't say. That is, they won't praise Saddam Hussein from the podium, but nor will they utter a critical word about him. However, as long as other speakers can and do express positions with a different point of view, the overall impact of the event will still be positive, particularly in the absence of other options. Most of the people at the demonstration will in fact be unaware of exactly who said what and whether any particular speaker omitted this or that point. What they will experience will be a powerful antiwar protest. And most of the public will see it that way too.\\" ANSWER attracted significant numbers to their rallies, but acquired few formal endorsements. In contrast, the list of early endorsers of NION's spring 2002 \\"Statement of Conscience\\" reads like a Who's Who of the U.S. left, ranging from celebrities such as Laurie Anderson, Deepak Chopra, and John Cusack, to intellectuals like Noam Chomsky, Toni Morrison, and Howard Zinn. NION was founded a full six months after ANSWER, as it was becoming clear that the U.S.'s military response to September 11 would not stop with Afghanistan. Despite its wide endorsements, NION's origins too gave pause to some on the left. Quoting again from the same article by Albert and Shalom, \\"Significant impetus behind NION comes from the Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP). RCP identifies itself as followers of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism‚ÄìMaoism. Their website expresses support for Shining Path in Peru, ... an organization with a gruesome record of violently targeting other progressive groups. For the RCP, freedom doesn't include the right of a minority to dissent (this is a bourgeois formulation, they say, pushed by John Stuart Mill and Rosa Luxemburg)...\\" Despite these origins, Albert and Shalom see NION in a rather different light than ANSWER‚Äîand this goes far to explain the list of endorsements by prominent members of the U.S. Left. Albert and Shalom acknowledge the broad endorsements of the \\"eloquent and forceful\\" pledge and write, \\"RCP does not push its specific positions on NION to the degree that IAC does on ANSWER\\", pointing out the contrast between the contents of the respective organizations' web sites: \\"[T]he NION website and its public positions have no connection to the sometimes bizarre views of the RCP. The case for participating in NION events is stronger than for ANSWER events. It still makes overwhelming sense to build better antiwar coalitions, but in the meantime supporting NION activities promotes an antiwar message that we support, with relatively little compromise of our views.\\" The third major U.S. group, UFPJ, founded around the time Albert and Shalom were writing, has been generally exempt from such accusations of sectarianism. Motivated no doubt in part by some of the same issues raised by Albert and Shalom, UFPJ has been, from the start, a broad coalition of organizations; NION itself is a member of UFPJ, as are MoveOn, the National Council of Churches, and Albert's own Z magazine. The groups have collaborated at times on events, although collaboration has not always been easy. In perhaps the most infamous incident, Rabbi Michael Lerner was banned from speaking at a February 16, 2003 anti-war rally in San Francisco, less than a month before the U.S. invaded Iraq. It was generally believed that this was done at ANSWER's behest, because Lerner had been critical of what he perceives as ANSWER's anti-Israel politics. Lerner, though irked that NION and UFPJ did not stand up for his inclusion as a speaker, continued to encourage people to attend the rally. =Anti-war in Europe= There was widespread and passionate support for the U.S. in Europe after the September 11 attacks, and little opposition to the invasion of Afghanistan and moves against the Al'Qaeda network. However, a large anti-war movement began to develop when the American government started agitating for an invasion of Iraq. Before and during the invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq, opposition to George W. Bush the war was widespread in Europe. Many were angered by what was seen as a stubborn unilateralism. Some have speculated that European countries were against a war because of a resurgence of \\"anti-American\\" sentiment. Contributing to these feelings were the positions taken by the George W. Bush administration on international issues: for example, American policies on global warming and environmental protection, on the International Criminal Court, on pre-emptive attack, and what has long been perceived as a policy of stubborn unilateralism practiced by successive American governments culminating in the Bush administration and especially the neoconservatives within it. The commonly articulated reasons included: a belief that the UN process (including Hans Blix's inspections) should be allowed to reach its natural conclusion, an aversion to America's neo-con bellicosity, a belief that the threat posed by Iraq was being exaggerated, a preference for multilateralism, a belief that war might just \\"serve as a recruiting sergeant for Al-Qaida\\", and fear of the \\"fog of war\\" i.e. the uncertain and unpredictable consequences of invading another country. The scale of the change in attitudes in Europe between 9/11 and late 2002 was astonishing, with the enormous goodwill and support of the immediate 9/11 period having been greatly eroded. Changes in the Republic of Ireland are an example of this. In the aftermath of the destruction of the World Trade Center, Ireland declared an unprecedented full national day of mourning for the victims. The reaction was two-fold: horror at the deaths but also a strong degree of sympathy for the United States, whom Ireland saw as a friend, particularly after US President Bill Clinton's welcome interventions during the negotiation of the Good Friday Agreement. By February 2003, the public reaction to the Bush administration actions over Iraq had changed America's image utterly. Instead of being seen in a positive light, the United States under Bush was seen as a 'bully' determined to force the international community to accept its demand for a war against Iraq, and if necessary ignore the international community in the United Nations. Hence, an estimated 100,000 people took part in an anti-war march in Dublin (the organisers had expected 20,000) with demands being made that the United States be refused permission to use Shannon Airport as a stop over point when flying their soldiers from the United States to countries bordering Iraq. Yet opinion polls showed that the Irish would support a war if it had United Nations approval. What they would not support was a non-UN-sanctioned war declared in defiance of the UN by the Bush administration. Protests in France Such 'anti-Bush' and anti-war sentiments were reflected in many western European countries, generally with the populace less sympathetic to the U.S. stance even when politicians in a given country (e.g. the UK and Spain) aligned themselves with the U.S. position. The general populations of France and Germany were opposed to the war and it would have been difficult for their governments had they failed to reflect those sentiments in policy. France's position in particular has been very much maligned within the U.S. After the first UN resolution, France advised the U.S. that it (the USA) had sufficient UN support to launch a war and that it (the USA) need not return to the UN for a second resolution. Nonetheless, the U.S. and the UK did push for a second resolution (to help Mr. Blair gain support for the war within the UK) and France reversed its earlier positions, unable then to agree to what was proposed. The French government took the position that the UN inspection process should be allowed to be completed. Some observers, being then unconvinced that Iraq's secular government had any links to Al-Qaida, the terrorist group that attacked the U.S., expressed puzzlement that the U.S. would consider military action against Iraq and not against North Korea, which had claimed it already had nuclear weapons and had announced that it was willing to contemplate war with the U.S. Many critics of the American War on Terror, including the UK's foreign intelligence services, did not believe that American actions would help to end terror, and believed that they would actually increase the ranks and capabilities of terrorist groups; some believed that during the war and immediate post-war period there would be a greatly increased risk that weapons of mass destruction would fall into the wrong hands (including Al-Qaida). America's presence in Middle-Eastern countries like Saudi Arabia has been one source of discontent that has served as an excuse to Islamic fundamentalists to commit acts of violence. Even as the U.S. downscales its presence and existing bases (e.g. Saudi Arabia), it is not clear that the U.S. presence in Iraq will be anything but de-stabilising because many in the Muslim world resent the \\"infidel\\" presence in the Middle East, using this as a means of inciting the disenfranchised in their populations to violence. On the other hand, a stable democracy in Iraq could have a stabilising influence. Clearly, there was a gamble there, and only the post-war period will prove which viewpoint was correct. Perhaps the most commonly heard criticism, at least outside of the U.S., was that the Bush Administration's reason for going to war with Saddam was to gain control over Iraqi natural resources (i.e., oil). Though few doubt that nuclear and WMD proliferation is a serious threat to stability and well-being, many felt that a war in Iraq would not aid in eliminating this threat and that the real reason was to secure control over the Iraqi oil fields (at a time when arguably links with Saudi Arabia were at risk). Popular opposition to war on Iraq in Europe led to a wave of anti-war rallies, which climaxed in an international synchronized anti-war demonstration around the world on February 15, 2003. The largest of these rallies were in Rome, Barcelona, and in London where over one million marched at a rally organised by the Stop the War Coalition. All three of these cities are in countries that were part of the \\"coalition of the willing\\" which took part in the war in Iraq. Criticism of the anti-war movement =Allegations of hypocrisy and influence of \\"radical\\" groups= Some critics, such as exiled Iranian writer Amir Taheri, view portions of the anti-war movement in Western Europe as \\"an alliance between the radical Left and hard-line Islamists.\\" In an article published in a somewhat edited version on June 10, 2004 in the Jerusalem Post, much of which is a rehash of his November 18, 2003 article in National Review, Taheri writes \\"In this month's election for a new European Parliament, voters in several European Union countries, notably France and Britain, are offered common lists of Islamist and leftist candidates... Europe's moribund extreme Left has found a new lease on life thanks to hundreds of young Muslim militants...\\" Without actually naming the UK-based Stop the War Coalition, he discusses the membership of its steering committee: \\"18 come from various hard Left groups: communists, Trotskyites, Maoists, and Castroists. Three others belong to the radical wing of the Labour Party. There are also eight radical Islamists. The remaining four are leftist ecologists known as Watermelons (Green outside, red inside).\\" He points to a similar alliance of the French Revolutionary Communist League (LCR) and Workers' Struggle (LO) with radical Islamists. \\"Are these not the new slaves?\\" he quotes Olivier Besan√ßonneau (who he describes as \\"leader of the French Trotskyites\\"), \\"Is it not natural that they should unite with the working class to destroy the capitalist system?\\" \\"The European Marxist‚ÄìIslamist coalition\\", argues Taheri, \\"does not offer a coherent political platform. Its ideology is built around three themes: hatred of the United States, the dream of wiping Israel off the map, and the hoped-for collapse of the global economic system.\\" Taheri also claims that the French Communist Party (PCF) \\"commissioned a study of the possibilities of electoral alliances with Muslim organizations.\\" He does not say that these Muslim organizations were Islamists or that anything ever came of the study. Taheri clearly views this alliance with Islamists as compromising traditional humanist values of the left and all \\"leftist\\" values in general. He clearly implies that this coalition could go on to embrace terrorism, paraphrasing Ilich Ram√≠rez S√°nchez, the Venezuelan terrorist known as \\"Carlos the Jackal\\" to the effect that \\"Islam is the only force capable of persuading large numbers of people to become 'volunteers' for suicide attacks against the US\\", and directly quoting him, \\"Only a coalition of Marxists and Islamists can destroy the US.\\" While many leftists have happily worked with Arab or Muslim groups in opposition to perceived U.S. or Israeli imperialism, alliances between leftists and Islamists are relatively unusual, and Taheri's sole example of a leftist actually praising Islamist terrorists is from Carlos the Jackal, a terrorist himself. As discussed above, leftists widely condemned the September 11 attacks, although some differed from those to their right by contextualizing the attacks in terms of what they see as comparable or worse acts of imperialist violence. More typical examples of leftists working in anti-war coalitions with Muslims would be the membership of American Muslims for Jerusalem in UFPJ or of the Muslim Student Association, American Muslims for Global Peace, and Atlanta Masjid of Al-Islam in ANSWER. These are Muslim groups, but they are not Islamist groups. =Allegations of anti-Americanism and anti-Semitism within the European anti- war movement= Some allege that anti-American sentiments were expressed at most of these anti-war protests in Europe. Some rallies even turned into violent events, with attacks on police, shops and passers-by, such as the March 24, 2003 rally in Hamburg, Germany. Some also allege that as Muslim minorities are bigger in many European countries than in the U.S., they influenced the movement. (5%‚Äì10% for France, 3.7% for Germany, 1.3% for Greece, according to the CIA World Factbook). There has been an organised Muslim component in many European anti-war rallies, reflecting widespread opposition to the American War on Terror campaign, often because of Arab/Muslim solidarity. In some groups, such as the British Stop the War Coalition, Muslims have taken leading positions. The presence of extremists and alleged Islamists has been cited by commentators such as Taheri in questioning the anti-war groups' commitment to human rights. Anti-Israeli slogans and acts, allegedly most often chanted and committed by Islamists, have caused some to see anti-war rallies to be \\"hijacked\\" by them to become anti-Israeli, anti-Zionist and anti-Western events. In France, Iraqi and Palestinian flags were common in anti-war rallies, while Israeli flags were often set on fire. In one case, the inflammatory atmosphere led to a serious case of violence: two Jewish teenagers, members of Hashomer Hatzair, were attacked in a demonstration in Paris against the war in Iraq. Aur√©lie Filippetti, a spokeswoman of the Green Party in Paris, was among the organizers of the demonstration. In an interview she gave Maariv correspondent Sefi Handler, she criticized some of her fellow French left-wingers for creating an anti-Israeli atmosphere which encourages antisemitism. She said: > I felt we should stop putting our head in the sand, saying that these are > only fringe effects and therefore 'none of our concern', which leads us to > just condemn them and do nothing more... They explained to me that the > slogan 'Bush and Sharon are murderers' is not antisemitism but anti-Zionism. > But for me, when you burn the flag of Israel, it is antisemitism. The > meaning is the delegitimation of Israel's right to exist. As a protest, Fillipetti promised to carry both flags of Israel and the Palestinians in the next demonstration as a message of peace and solidarity with Israel's right to exist. As a result, she received threats and an urged meeting of the Green Party decided to forbid party activists to carry any national flag. Fillipetti honored the decision, but said that anti-war protests were still full with Iraq and Palestinian flags. \\"It was a violent event\\" she recalls. \\"I said to myself that if I would carry the flags of Israel and Palestinian, I then would face some serious troubles.\\" Parallel to the controversy over the flags, Filipetti published an article in the left- oriented French newspaper Lib√©ration in which she warned against the antisemitism that seemed to plague their own camp. It was an attack on her fellow leftists for turning a blind eye at what she characterized as the clearly anti-leftist character of some parts of their rallies and demonstrations. The article essentially accused certain members of the French left of being hypocrites (for allegedly tolerating the same kind of racist behavior that they were protesting against), and, as such, it came as a major shock and sparked much controversy. Israeli left wing and Human rights activist, professor Amnon Rubinstein wrote that the French Left seems to hold a double standard: opposing neo-Nazism when it comes from the Western right wing (and particularly from the French Far Right, such as the Front National), but not when it comes from the \\"oppressed world\\" of the Arabs. He called that \\"the big treason of the French Left, which came as a shock to the Jews who used to see the Left as their true friend\\". These accusations have generated great controversy, particularly because they come from within the Left itself. However, a 2004 Pew poll showed that in Europe, favourability ratings are much higher for Jews than for Muslims.

Following a career with the United States Forest Service he was appointed Governor of Alaska Territory, a position he held from 1953 till 1957. During his term as governor he continued to support economic development but was largely opposed to efforts granting statehood to Alaska. Background Heintzleman was born to Andrew J. and Rebecca Jane Heintzleman in Fayetteville, Pennsylvania, on December 3, 1888. He was educated in public schools before being graduated from the Pennsylvania State College with a Bachelor of Forestry in 1907 and from Yale University with a Master of Forestry in 1910. Shortly after graduation, Heintzleman joined the United States Forest Service and worked in Oregon and Washington. With the United States entry into World War I, he was transferred to Alaska to oversee lumber production. There, from 1918 till 1934, he served as Assistant Regional Forester in Ketchikan, Alaska. In this role he assisted the development of the region's pulp and lumber industries and was key to the construction of two pulp mills in southeast Alaska. During this time he wrote the 1921 Forest Service bulletin \\"The Forests of Alaska\\". Heintzleman was made head of the National Recovery Administration forest conservation efforts in 1934. In 1937, he was appointed Alaskan Representative of the Federal Power Commission. The same year he was promoted to Regional Forester for Alaska, a post he held till 1953. As Regional Forester he also held the position of Alaskan Commissioner of the United States Department of Agriculture. In this role he encouraged the development of lumber and pulp mills along with other industrial development. From 1939 to 1940 he served as chairman of the Alaska Territorial Planning Board. Governorship Heintzleman was appointed to become Governor of Alaska Territory by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on March 11, 1953. Following confirmation, his term of office began on April 10 of the same year. The primary focus of the new governor's administration was economic development. Toward this end he called for revised homesteading and land laws along with updated mineral leases, power licenses, and timber contracts. The Alaskan governor also joined with Hawaiian Territorial Governor Samuel Wilder King in a call for a 25-year tax holiday to promote industrial development in the two territories. Finally, Heintzleman opposed the native claim of \\"possessory rights\\" to millions of acres of land, wishing to open the land to development. This opposition led to a prolonged battle in the United States Court of Claims. The leading political issue within Alaska at the time was the territory's gaining statehood. At the beginning of his term of office he felt Alaska's efforts to become a state were \\"a little premature\\". After a year, he revised his opinion and instead called for dividing the territory and only granting statehood to the settled southern and southeastern portion while leaving the unsettled northern and western sections a territory. The proposal to divide the territory at the 156th meridian west was so unpopular among Alaskans that a petition drive was organized asking President Eisenhower to remove Heintzleman as governor. By 1956, the Alaskan governor no longer opposed statehood and supported the creation of a state constitution. Heintzleman signed the bill establishing the Alaska Constitutional Convention. Heintzleman submitted his resignation on December 18, 1956. His letter of resignation explain his departure by pointing out that he \\"had forty-six years of public service\\" and desired \\"to retire to less strenuous work\\". The timing, three months before the end of his term, was occasioned by the outgoing governor's desire to allow for his replacement to be in place before the next territorial legislature convened on January 28, 1957. Heintzleman's resignation became effective on January 4, 1957, when Territorial Secretary became Acting Governor. A permanent replacement was not named until May 9, 1957, when President Eisenhower nominated Michael Anthony Stepovich. After office From 1957 till 1959, Heintzleman was a member of the University of Alaska Board of Regents. He then served, in 1960, as an advisor to the Alaska Rail and Highway Commission. Heintzleman died of a heart attack on June 24, 1965 in Juneau, Alaska. He was buried in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania.

V., and A. O. Frolov. \\"Light and electron microscopic study of Pelomyxa stagnalis sp. n.(Archamoebae, pelobiontida).\\" Cell and Tissue Biology 5.1 (2011): 90-97. The genus was created by R. Greeff, in 1874, with Pelomyxa palustris as its type species.Greeff, Richard. \\"Pelomyxa palustris (Pelobius), ein am√∂berartiger Organismus des s√ºssen Wassers.\\" Archiv f√ºr Mikroskopische Anatomie 10.1 (1874): 51-73. In the decades following the erection of Pelomyxa, researchers assigned numerous new species to it. However, in the last quarter of the 20th century, investigators reduced the genus to a single species, Pelomyxa palustris, which was understood to be a highly changeable organism with a complex life cycle, whose various phases had been mistaken for separate species.Griffin, Joe I. (1988) \\"Fine Structure and Taxonomic Position of the Giant Amoeboid Pelomyxa palustris.\\" J. Protozool. 35(2):313Brugerolle G. and Patterson D. 2000. Order Pelobiontida Page 1976. In: An illustrated guide to the protozoa, second edition (Eds. Lee J., Leedale G. and Bradbury P.). Allen press inc., Lawrence, USA. pp. 1097-1103. All described species were relegated to the status of synonyms, or moved to the unrelated genus Chaos. Since 2004, four new Pelomyxa species have been described, and two older species have been redescribed and confirmed as valid members of the genus. These developments have raised new questions about the nature of Pelomyxa palustris itself.Frolov, Alexander O., Ludmila V. Chystjakova, and Andrew V. Goodkov. \\"A new pelobiont protist Pelomyxa corona sp. n.(Peloflagellatea, Pelobiontida).\\" Protistology 3 (2004): 233-241.Frolov, Alexander O., Ludmila V. Chystjakova, and Andrew V.

N. Malysheva. \\"Light-and electron-microscopical study of Pelomyxa flava sp. n.(archamoebae, pelobiontida)].\\" Tsitologiia 52.9 (2010): 776. Characteristics Pelomyxa have multiple nuclei, which can number from two to several thousand in rare cases. A moving cell is cylindrical in shape, with a single hemispherical pseudopod at the front and a semipermanent projection called a uroid at the back, which is covered in tiny non-motile flagella. They consume a wide variety of food, and have many vacuoles containing both food, such as diatoms, and debris such as sand. Pelomyxa are reliant on symbiotic bacteria that function similarly to the mitochondrion of aerobic creature, enabling the otherwise anaerobic species to live in more aerobic environments. Classification The classification of Pelomyxa has been the subject of considerable discussion, in recent decades. Pelomyxa lack mitochondria, as well as several other organelles usually found in eukaryote cells (notably, peroxisomes and dictyosomes). At one time, they were also believed to lack flagella and to be incapable of mitosis. As nucleated cells that lacked \\"nearly every other cell-inclusion of eukaryotes\\", Pelomyxa were, for a time, regarded as surviving \\"proto-Eukaryotes\\",Whatley, Jean M. et al. (April 1979). \\"From Extracellular to intracellular: the establishment of mitochondria and chloroplasts.\\" Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences. 204(155):51) standing somewhere between the bacteria and the modern cell. In 1973, it was proposed that the ancestors of Pelomyxa palustris had branched off from the eukaryote line before the advent of mitochondriaBovee, E. C., and T. L. Jahn. 1973. \\"Taxonomy and phylogeny.\\" Pages 38‚Äì76 in K. W. Jeon, ed. The biology of amoeba. Academic Press, New York; cited in Roger, Andrew J. (1999) \\"Reconstructing Early events in Eukaryotic Evolution.\\" The American Naturalist. 154(S4):S147 In 1976, Jean M. Whatley wrote that Pelomyxa palustris \\"may justly be considered the most primitive eukaryotic organism living today.\\" As such, the organism was potentially a modern analogue of the ancestral eukaryote that, according to the theory of serial endosymbiosis, internalized the bacterial symbiont that later evolved into the mitochondria of the modern cell. The species was known to host several bacterial symbionts. While the function of these was unclear, Whatley argued that they might provide a useful evolutionary example, indicating the \\"ways in which a bacterial mitochondrial transformation might have been attained.\\" In 1982, Lynn Margulis created the subclass Caryoblastea (or Pelobiontidae) for \\"anaerobic ameobas that lack undulipodia,\\" and assigned Pelomyxa to it as the only member of the group. The following year, Cavalier- Smith included the genus with several other \\"primitive\\" amitochondriate amoeboids in a new taxonomical group: the Archamoebae.Cavalier-Smith, T. 1983. \\"A 6-kingdom classification and a unified phylogeny.\\" In W. Schwemmler and H. E. A. Schenk (ed.), Endocytobiology II. de Gruyter, Berlin. pp. 1027-1034. The Archamoebae were, in turn, recruited to the new kingdom of Archezoa, along with other amitochondriate eukaryotes, the Metamonads and the Microsporidia. The primitivity of Pelomyxa came into doubt in 1988, when Joe I. Griffin published a structural study of Pelomyxa palustris showing that the species does, after all, possess rudimentary flagella, and that it does mitose. Griffin concluded that \\"Pelomyxa is neither primitive nor different from related forms, once it is realized that its relatives are amoeboid flagellates.\\"Griffin, Joe I. (1988) \\"Fine Structure and Taxonomic Position of the Giant Amoeboid Pelomyxa palustris.\\" J. Protozool. 35(2):300-315 In 1995, the case against Pelomyxa's primitivity became stronger still, when molecular analysis revealed that the ancestors of Pelomyxa palustris had most probably possessed mitochondria.Morin, L., and J.-P. Mignot. 1995. Are Archamoebae true Archezoa? the phylogenetic position of Pelomyxa sp. as inferred from large subunit ribosomal RNA sequencing. European Journal of Protistology 31:402. By the end of the decade, it was clear that all members of Cavalier-Smith's Archamoebae were descended from mitochondriate cells. In other words, they were not early-branching or \\"primitive\\" eukaryotes at all, but rather \\"degenerate protists\\" that had lost organelles their ancestors had possessed. Consequently, Pelomyxa and the other Archamoeba were reassigned to the phylum Amoebozoa, under the subphylum Conosa (shared with the Mycetozoan slime moulds).T. Cavalier-Smith. A revised six-kingdom system of life. Biological Reviews (1998). 73:203-266. Kingdom Archezoa was eliminated entirely.

The Sanlam-NBC Music Awards and the Namibian Music Awards are two separate institutions that give out annual awards at shows on December 2 and May 6 respectively. The Namibia Society of Composers and Authors of Music (NASCAM) has helped promote Namibian music within and outside the country. The Namibian music industry remains under-developed, with no major record labels or distribution infrastructure. A lack of focus to produce economically viable Namibian music products and the absence of effective marketing and distribution structures are two of the factors inherently hampering the development of the local music industry. The country's biggest online music retailer, DONLU offers streaming services. They also boast being the only online music store in Africa that allows for purchases of music to be done and being paid for by various mobile money wallets across Africa in Tanzania, Rwanda, Kenya, Uganda and Zambia. Payments can be done with MTN Money, Vodacom Money, Airtel and Tigo Pesa for the fans living in those African countries. Fans living in the rest of the world, can pay using PayPal, PayToday as well as credit/debit card. Folk music Traditional Namibian dances occur at events such as weddings and at traditional festivals such as the Caprivi Arts Festival. Folk music accompanies storytelling or dancing. The Nama people use various strings, flutes and drums while the Bantu use xylophones, gourds and horn trumpets. * The Herero people's oviritje is popularly known as konsert. Otjiherero is the primary language of Oviritje music. Oviritje was made popular by Kareke Henguva as a pioneer of Modern Oviritje Music when he together with the likes of Kakazona Kavari, Meisie Henguva and Oomzulu Pietersen introduced the keyboard element as prior to the introduction of the keyboard Oviritje Music was performed with vocals only. Prior to Kareke people like Matuarari Kaakunga and Bella Kazongominja have developed the Oviritje genre. Today in recognition of his contribution to the Oviritje music Kareke Henguva has been accorded the title of doctor of modern Oviritje music. Other groups that took over from Henguva and made this music popular are The Wild Dogs from the Okakarara area with their hit song \\"Kaondeka\\", Okazera from the Omaheke Region, the first group to include a San-speaking member, Bullet ya Kaoko, based in Opuwo in the Kunene Region, Tuponda, Katja, Millenium, Kareke and the United Kingdom-based Oviritje queen Kakazona ua Kavari. * Ma«Ägaisa, a dance music genre commonly known as Damara Punch, is performed by Stanley, «ÉAubasen, Dixson and Damara Dikding. Phura Duwe is known to be the king of Ma/gaisa as he came up this genre of music then follows the likes of Raphael and Pele, Pule, Ruby and Riio. Many female singers are entering the Ma/gaisa world yearly. The genre was derived from Damara traditional music and is mainly sung in Khoekhoegowab. * Shambo, the traditional dance music of the Oshiwambo-speaking people, derives its name from \\"Shambo Shakambode\\" - \\"music\\". In the late nineties Yoba Valombola blended existing Oshiwambo music widely popularised by folk guitarist Kwela, Kangwe Keenyala, Boetie Simon, Lexington and Meme Nanghili na Shima. Later Setson and the Mighty Dread Band combined these and other Namibian styles and this was the birth of Shambo shakambode music. Yoba based Shambo on a dominant guitar, a rhythm guitar, percussion and a heavy \\"talking\\" bassline. Themes range from love to war and history. Young Namibian musicians contributed sampled tracks backed by a blend of house music and Kwaito. Prominent shambo musicians include Tunakie, Ama Daz Floor, Tate Kwela and D-Naff, also a gospel musician. Kwiku mixes shambo with Kwassa kwassa. The genre was made popular by Tate Buti and his sister Janice with Faizel MC on the song \\"Kwiku\\". It is listened to by most Namibians including Basters and Coloureds. In 2005 it was recognized by the Namibia Society of Composers and Authors of Music (NASCAM) as one of Namibia's folk music genres. The annual Sanlam-NBC Music Awards also included it as one of their awarding genres in 2005. Other kwiku artists include trio PDK, Olavi, Killa B, Castro, Faizel MC, Tunakie, and the late YT de Wet. * Afrikaans music is also popular in Namibia. Afrikaans music primarily influenced by European folk music. In Namibia it is more popular among the white communities. Stefan Ludik is the most successful Afrikaans musician. Popular music Popular styles of music in Namibia include hip hop, R&B;, Soul, reggae, afro-pop, house and kwaito. Upon Namibia's independence Jackson Kaujeua and Ras Sheehama had been the most outstanding Namibian performers. Kaujeua had been performing since the 1970s, he performed a mix of Namibia's traditional genres with afro-pop/gospel sounds. Sheehama performs reggae, in footsteps of reggae late legends Bob Marley and Lucky Dube. Sheehama has performed in Jamaica, Cuba, UK, Switzerland and the Czech Republic. Other early Namibian musicians includes a Setswana band called People's Choice, that was popular between 1996 and 1998 for their hit single \\"Don't Look Back (Siwelewele)\\", a kwaito trio called Matongo Family, Boli Mootseng, X-Plode with members (Jaicee James, Lizell Swarts & Christi Nomath Warner Warner Christi), oshiwambo indigenous rapper Shikololo and R&B; turn-producer Big Ben. Big Ben has eventually become the most respected artist through his Afro pop and Fusion with his live shows. In fact he is one of the very few that performs all his shows with a live band while many still performs with back tracks. Namibian stars such as Stefan Ludik, The Dogg, Gazza, Gal Level, EES, Lady May, Sunny Boy and Big Ben have become continental celebrities as well as Placa Gang a group of hard working dream chasers. =Reggae/Dancehall/Afrobeats= The Namibian reggae platform has produced artist such as Ras Sheehama, Petu, Ngatu, who has been performing since 1994, Mighty Dreeds and EES. In the early eighties a band called We Culture was formed in Katutura and this turned to be Namibia's first reggae band. Another band followed called Roots rebels also based in the Katutura location. The Namibian independence came and most of the Namibian population that was in exile came back to Namibian and bands like Young Dreads later renamed as Mighty Dreads, Ras Sheehama, Los Amadeus, Omidi d Afrique, Shem Yetu, Organised Crime and 40Thieves. Most of these bands faded or became one and a group of young Namibian reggae musicians came up later. Most of the Mighty Dread band members left and formed Formular band or engage into solo careers. Dancehall, Ragga and Dub was gaining popularity and singers like Ngatu (from the Mighty Dread), Doren, Iron Roots, Ras Kasera and Ten-Dreadz came up with a new blend of Ragga Dancehall. EES is also respected in the R&B;, hip hop and kwaito genres of Namibia. Buju Bantuan a.k.a. Katjoko (not to be confused with Jamaica's Buju Banton), the late La Chox and Kamasutra are one of the youngest reggae artist. Prominent kwaito artist Gazza has also associated himself with the genre as well as Killa-B =Rock n roll= Rock n roll is widely celebrated by the white communities of Namibia. Die V√∂gel is one of Namibia's most outstanding rock n roll bands. The band had success with the German-speaking Namibians during the 1970s. Stefan Ludik was Namibia's first Big Brother Africa participant in the show's first season. Today he is a successful rock n roll and pop musician and actor. His music is more popular among the Namibian and South African white communities. G3 a duo of two young Namibians gained success with their hit single \\"Olupandu\\" in 2005. One of the country's most durable rock bands is Bedrock (The Band In The Sand). Formed in 1994 in Oranjemund, the band has released four albums of original material over the years: Recovery (2001), So, Where's The Party? (2003), Simplicity (2008) and Desert Rock (2010). They describe their sound as Desert Rock, an eclectic mix of styles from 1970s rock, blues, pop and folk. A feature of their compositions is the subtle thread of humour which underpins most of their work. The opening song of their debut album, Rock 'n' Roll, was voted by the South African Rock Digest as one of the Top 30 South African songs of 2003. It was also their first song to gain radio play. Despite numerous personnel changes over the years the band continues to thrive, playing regular gigs in and around Oranjemund. =Township Disco / Bubblegum= Is better known as Bubblegum Mapantshula Afro pop that's the rhythm who brings the legends like late Brenda Fassie and the Big Dudes, Chicco Twala, Dan Nkosi, Ebony, Richard Makhubale of Volcano, Dan Tsahnda of Splash, Yvonne Chaka Chaka, Alec OmKhali of Umoja. Gabkoz also is better known for such type of music in Namibia as well as Specco , Scorpion, Ocean Girls, Mr. Tjiuti, Raindrops, Sonic Witness, The Couples, Right Choice, Manelo, and People Choice band, Erick Mahua, Rirua Murangi and Chicco of Chiccolela Production who have contributed much in these genre to produce many up and coming artists like Skilpad who got much interest in syth sound of the original tune of township keyboards instrument. =Hip hop= Black Vulcanite Hip hop music and culture have influenced Namibian youth, especially the American acts Tupac Shakur, The Notorious B.I.G., Nas, Jay-Z, Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre and Eminem. Early Namibian hip hop acts includes a group called Dungeon Family, which was composed of the newly recreated group The Kalaharians and the popular girl duo Gal Level. Other acts include Nakuni Heitah, Gurd Grill the Katutura native Jericho, OmPuff, Black Vulcanite and Mc Ray. Namibian hip-hop can compete with kwaito for popularity. =R&B;, pop, afro-pop= R&B; has been popular in Namibia since the 1990s. Namibian R&B; singers have influenced the genre with afro- pop. Most of them perform a mixture of pop/afro-pop and R&B.; Afro-pop is the African style of wester-pop. The Namibian R&B;/pop genre has produced continental celebrated duo Gal Level and solo singers African Boy, Sally Boss Madam, Christi Nomath Warner Warner Christi (who uses her poetry as basis for her lyrics) & Lady May. Te Quila, Jewelz and Sally Boss Madam are one of the most promising R&B;/pop singers of Namibia. Male artist such as Rodger and Nasti are also popular they all show influence from Ne-Yo, Mario, and Chris Brown. Jossy Joss and Big Ben are one of the earliest singers of Namibia. Big Ben has been the most consistent with this genre since his first release in 2001. =Kwaito= EES performing kwaito The kwaito genre is the most popular and successful music genre in Namibia. It's believed to be the biggest industry in Namibia's music and the only that is heavily supported by the youth. This is so because of socio-economic issues, as many artists enter the music industry with hopes of strengthening self-employment and making a living out of it. Namibian kwaito has been strengthened and directly influenced by the South African kwaito style. However, over the years Namibia introduced a different type of kwaito, which makes it slightly different from the South African tradition. The difference lies in production; Namibian producers focus their production on party oriented music. Namibian kwaito artists include The Dogg, Gazza, Sunny Boy, Qonja, Tre Van Die Kasie, and OmPuff. The Dogg's debut album, Shimaliw' Osatana, was the first kwaito album released in Namibia by a Namibian artist. =House= A Namibian DJ at work (DJ Basoff) House music is played at raves in Africa, especially South Africa. African house is based on African traditional melodies. It is characterized by a fast moving beat with thin melodies and synthesizers. Sometimes it is accompanied by vocals. =Metal= Since the late 1990s some artists perform heavy metal in Namibia, among those the Arcana XXII, subMission, Delusion Of Grandeur. In 2007 the first Namibian festival took place with bands like CfD (USA), subMission (Namibia), Wrust (Botswana), Neblina (Angola), Delusion Of Grandeur (Namibia), followed by two other editions in 2008 and 2009 including artists like Lady Axe (South Africa), Juggernaught (South Africa), Azrail (South Africa).Windhoek Metal Fest.. =Electronic music= In the late nineties an ex Mighty Dread singer (Yoba Valombola, known as Benga), bassist and guitarist came back from Germany with a big influence and eager in change and started an independent label called Big Rat Communication. This was fuelled by the idea of producing Namibia's first electronic music ranging from, Trip hop, Drum and bass, Dubstep and drumstep. Due to the unpopularity of electronic music in Namibia, Yoba released his music only in Europe and America under the name Benga. Most of the electronic music Benga release is based on his early experiments of Reggae, Shambo, blues and rock. Yoba went back to the west and returned again after six years to Namibia to influence other Namibians. Some existing experimental artists like Thomas Swarts, Dtubsen and Joas tried forming a group and due to time and obligations, nothing worked out. Yoba is still based in Germany as an electronic artist and performing with other Namibian artists in Europe: widely as Canada and South America.

The principality came into being when farmer George Muirhead, facing the possibility of the repossession of his properties - Kierawonga & Indicus - by the Commonwealth Bank, challenged the legality of their bills of exchange in the Queensland Supreme Court. When he lost the case, Muirhead returned to his property under the grounds that he had been denied natural justice, and, along with his wife and approximately 30 other supporters, declared it to be an independent principality where the bank and Queensland Government had no legal authority. 11 days after the proclamation of independence (at approximately 5:00am), 120 officers of the Queensland Police entered the property and forcibly evicted the Muirheads. The Muirheads won widespread media attention from across the world, with the media portraying them as hardworking people being victimized by a cold, heartless corporation. The Muirheads adopted the Australian flag, the Scottish Flag, the Australian Aboriginal Flag and the United Nations Flag as the symbol of their principality during the secession. On the Queen's Birthday Long Weekend 1993, a small number of men, clad in surplus military fatigues, attempted to storm Parliament House in Canberra. When confronted by security officers, the group claimed to be the Marlborough Liberation Army. The group later turned out to be engaged in a high school prank.

They typically care for aquatic animals, including fish and marine invertebrates. Some may care for aquatic mammals. Aquarists often work at public aquariums. They may also work at nature reserves, zoos, and amusement parks. Some aquarists conduct field research outdoors. In business, aquarists may work at pet stores, as commercial fish breeders, or as manufacturers. Some aquarists are hobbyists, also known as \\"home aquarists,\\" who may vary in skills and experience.  History  People have cared for aquatic animals since ancient times. The Sumerians kept fish in ponds as early as 2500 BCE. Pliny the Elder wrote of people who kept fish as oracles, and ancient Agrigent was believed to have fish ponds. The Roman poet Rutilus Namatianus wrote of a Etrurian Jew who kept fish in opaque tanks. By the 10th century, goldfish were popular pets in China. In 1369, Emperor Hung Wu established a porcelain factory to produce large tubs for fish. Around 1500, goldfish came to Sakai, Japan. Two hundred years later, Sato Sanzaemon, from Koriyama, became the first Japanese fish breeder, and fish breeding became popular throughout Japan. Around 1611, goldfish came to Europe, probably first in Portugal. By the 18th century, goldfish were common pets in Europe. During this time, Richard Bradley, and English botanist, and John Dayell, a Scottish naturalist, experimented with keeping marine life. In particular, scientists tried to determine if marine life could survive in captivity, as they usually died shortly after being removed from their natural environments. For centuries, humans had limited exposure to aquatic life. The sea was often considered mysterious. As written by Bernd Brunner in The Ocean at home, \\"The ocean was considered a source of life but also a place of ill omen, death, and mayhem‚Äîa cursed, dark world where terrifying monsters lurked, devouring anything in sight.\\" Yet, in the 19th century, railroad transportation was introduced, enabling more people to visit coastal regions. During this period, scientists focused on analyzing the chemical and physical properties of aquatic environments, such as water temperature and salt content. Ocean exploration also became more common, as telegraph cables were installed underwater, diving bells and early submarines were invented, and deep sea explorations began with the help of dredgers. One of the most famous oceanic expeditions of the period was the four year journey of the HMS Challenger, led by Sir Charles Wyville Thomson, which visited 363 locations. In 1830, Jeanne Villepreux-Power conducted research on argonauts in Messina, Italy. According to Richard Owen, director of the British Museum, Villepreux-Power invented the first aquarium through these experiments. That same year, Nathaniel Bagshaw Ward discovered that delicate plants could grow in airtight glass, as the glass created a microclimate. Around 1838, Felix Dujardin, a French zoologist, owned a saltwater aquarium. In 1846, Anna Thyne moved stone corals from Torquay to her home in London, later keeping them in her home in glass bowls. She experimented with water changes to sustain the corals, and she was able to keep the corals alive for three years. In 1849, Robert Warrington created a 13-gallon tank with springwater and goldfish. He published his findings related to oxygen and lighting in Chemical Society's Journal. In 1854, The Aquarium, by Philip Henry Gosse, was published, which was a commercial success and inspired middle-class families to create aquariums. The book provided information on how to build aquariums with aquatic plants, fish, hermit crabs, shrimp, sea anemone, aphrodita, and other aquatic life. During this period, William Alford Lloyd sold aquariums at his shop in London, which also provided aquarium maintenance services to customers. In 1856, Emil Adolf Rossm√§ssler wrote about setting up freshwater aquariums as a \\"small botanical garden island\\" with animals such as snails, pearl mussels, and goldfish in Die Gartenlaube. These freshwater aquariums were appealing for people who lived farther from the sea. While the \\"aquarium mania\\" of the 1850s lost popularity after a few years, public aquariums were soon established. In 1853, the \\"fish house\\" was opened at the London Zoo. In 1860, Gustav Jager, a German nature scientist and doctor, built an aquarium in Vienna, Austria. Major cities continued to open aquariums in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, such as the New York Aquarium (1896) and Belle Isle Aquarium in Detroit (1904). Early aquariums cared little for conservation of endangered species, and they often contributed to marine degradation. However, conservation efforts began in the 20th century, such as the conservation of the Gal√°pagos tortoises led by Charles Haskins Townsend. Contemporary aquariums are now often involved in conservation and field research. In 2019, The Atlantic reported that \\"the United States is experiencing a new wave of aquarium enthusiasm,\\" but that public aquariums often experience financial difficulty.  Responsibilities  Responsibilities for aquarists often include maintaining and cleaning tanks, preparing food for the animals (including dietary adjustments), feeding the animals, providing mental stimulation for some animals, monitoring animals for sickness or injuries, administering medication and vitamins to animals, maintaining the water quality and water temperature of tanks, maintaining the lighting of tanks, collecting data on the water quality and water temperature of tanks, monitoring and maintaining aquarium machinery (such as filters, heaters, and pumps), transporting animals, and building exhibits, among other duties. It is common for aquarists to have scuba diving certification.

The area has been used for skiing since before the completion of the Mountain Road, but the first lifts opened in 1978. There are two beginner areas, and many intermediate and advanced trails. The upper field is a mix of natural pipes, steep drops, fast plains, and easier slopes, along with several terrain parks. The lower field contains the field's single narrow beginner trail, Clarry's Track, and a few other intermediate trails. They also serve as access to the base area from the upper mountain, and are often crowded. The field is and has a vertical drop. The skifield is reached via the Mountain Road from the town of Ohakune. The Mountain Road was built by locals from Ohakune, mostly during weekends after they formed the Mountain Road Association in 1952. Their aim was to open Ruapehu's southern slopes for skiing, partly as a replacement industry for the decline in logging which had sustained the town for the previous decades. The now renamed Ministry of Works helped with the road on one occasion by 'misplacing' a culvert destined for another roading project. The 17 kilometre road was opened in 1963. It winds up through spectacular native forest before breaking out above the tree line and finishes at a complex of carparks below the bottom chairlift. Turoa has been owned by Ruapehu Alpine Lifts since 2000, which also owns the nearby Whakapapa skifield, also on Mt. Ruapehu. It is possible to traverse from one field to the other. The two are operated together, with a combined lift ticket for both fields. Together, they are considered to be the largest ski resort in New Zealand and possibly the southern hemisphere. On a good day it is possible to hike to the top of the mountain with skis or snowboard in hand, view the Crater Lake, and then ski back down to the field, or to Whakapapa. Also on a clear day Mount Taranaki can be seen. In 2007, a high speed six-seater chairlift, the High Noon Express was installed, replacing an existing T-bar to the top of the mountain. The lift had several faults after being installed, such as cable derailments. In winter of 2010, two pylons on the lift collapsed, and the lift was redesigned with 15 new shorter pylons instead of 10 higher pylons in the original design and was open 2011 season. The redesign required relocating an older fixed grip quad chair which previously passed under the lift. {{|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/travel/4719678/Turoas-High-Noon-chairlift-gets- rebuild Lifts There are three proposed proposed ski lifts at Turoa, which are due to be complete before 2030. A new Quad express set to be positioned west of the high noon express, to give better access to where the old Jumbo T-Bar used to operate near. The existing Giant fixed grip chairlift is set to be replaced by a new detachable quad express. A gondola is planned to be constructed on Turoa, replacing both the Parklane and Movenpick chairs, starting at the base area and terminating at the location of the top station of the Movenpick chair with a mid station allowing for access to the Wintergarden beginners area. {{|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&objectid;=10431899 {|- !width=20% style=\\"background: green; color: white;\\"|Lift Name !width=18% style=\\"background: green; color: white;\\"|Type !width=10% style=\\"background: green; color: white;\\"|Ride Time !width=10% style=\\"background: green; color: white;\\"|Capacity and Speed !width=10% style=\\"background: green; color: white;\\"|Starting Elevation !width=10% style=\\"background: green; color: white;\\"|Vertical Rise |- style=\\"background: #eeeeee; color: black;\\" |High Noon Express Six seater detachable chairlift 6 min 3200 people per hour at 5/s 1902m 420m (1.4 km total length) |- style=\\"background: #eeeeee; color: black;\\" |Nga Wai Heke Chair Quad chairlift 8 min 1800 people per hour 1730m 225m |- style=\\"background: #eeeeee; color: black;\\" |Movenpick Chair Quad chairlift 15 min 2000 people per hour 1620m 307m |- style=\\"background: #eeeeee; color: black;\\" |Giant Chair Triple chairlift 12 min 1200 people per hour 1747m 310m |- style=\\"background: #eeeeee; color: black;\\" |Parklane Chair Triple chairlift 7 min 1200 people per hour 1620m 136m |- style=\\"background: #eeeeee; color: black;\\" |Alpine Meadow Platter Platter lift 2 min 720 people per hour 1600m 12m |- style=\\"background: #eeeeee; color: black;\\" |Wintergarden Platter Platter lift 2 min 720 people per hour 1760m 20m |- style=\\"background: #eeeeee; color: black;\\" |Alpine Meadow Carpet Lift Magic Carpet 2 min 360 people per hour 1605m 10m |} The High Noon Express The lifts are capable of taking up to 11,300 people per hour on a busy day, the second most of any ski area in New Zealand, behind Whakapapa.

Printed in a book-like page size and using a single-column format, each issue features a single extended essay of at least 20,000 words, with an introduction by the editor, and correspondence relating to essays in previous issues. It was founded in 2001. Concentrating primarily on Australian politics in a broad sense, the magazine's issues have covered topics including profiles of Mark Latham, to the U.S. military's failure to grasp the importance of tribal affiliation in Iraq, and the \\"cult\\" of the CEO. Its small circulation of a few thousand copies belies the impact it has had, with many ideas in a number of essays impacting the wider public debates on those issues through their repetition in more widely circulated media. Founding editor Peter Craven was sacked by the magazine's owner, property developer Morry Schwartz, in early 2004 over a dispute about the joint authorship of one essay, and, more widely, the magazine's future direction. Schwartz stated that while he had a vision of the magazine as more \\"political and Australian\\" whereas Craven was perhaps \\"more broad and internationalist\\".

Riggs Jr. (October 17, 1873 ‚Äì January 16, 1945) was an American engineer who worked extensively in Alaska Territory, first as a leader of the team which surveyed the Alaska-Canada border and later as a Commissioner oversee construction of the Alaska Railroad. He was appointed Governor of Alaska Territory and served from 1918 till 1921. During his later life, Riggs served as United States Commissioner to the International Boundary Commission. Background Riggs was born to Thomas and Catherine Winter (Gilbert) Riggs on October 17, 1873 in Ilchester, Maryland. He was educated at the Emerson Institute and a variety of other private schools located in both the United States and Germany. He studied civil engineering at Princeton University, graduating in 1894. Following graduation he moved with his family to Washington state and took a job as a newspaper reporter in Tacoma. In 1896 he joined his family's lumber business in Bucoda before joining the Klondike Gold Rush the next year. From 1897 to 1901, Riggs prospected for gold near both Dawson City and Nome, Alaska with little success. From 1901 to 1903 he worked as a mining engineer in Idaho, Montana, and Utah. In 1903, Riggs joined the United States and Canada Boundary Survey. From 1906 to 1913 he worked on the team assigned to survey the Alaska-Canada border and advanced from the position of surveyor to become the United States Engineer-in-Charge. During this effort, the team surveyed the boundary from the Pacific to Arctic Oceans, placed boundary markers, and cleared wooded areas to provide a clear line of sight between markers. Riggs married Ren√©e Marie Coudert on April 30, 1913 in New York City. The marriage produced two children: Elizabeth C. and Thomas III. Following his work surveying the Alaska-Canada border, on May 4, 1914, Riggs was appointed by President Woodrow Wilson to the Alaskan Railroad Commission. Along with the other two commissioners he oversaw the construction of the Alaska Railroad, Riggs being responsible for the Fairbanks division. Governorship United States Secretary of the Interior Franklin Knight Lane was impressed by Riggs' experience and recommended his appointment as Governor of Alaska Territory to President Woodrow Wilson. Following his confirmation, the new governor was sworn into office on April 12, 1918. The United States had already entered the First World War by the time he entered office and the new governor encouraged Alaska to support the war effort. Under Riggs, the territory was a leader in the sale of both war savings stamps and Liberty Bonds. The new governor also worked to decrease overlaps between the territorial and federal governmental functions. He was successful in the areas of education, mine inspections, and road building but met strong resistance in his efforts to consolidate efforts within Alaska's Land Office. Transportation was a major problem within the territory, with Riggs believing private shipping firms were providing unfair and inadequate service to Alaska. To rectify this problem, he proposed Alaska establish a fleet of transport ships and begin a territorial shipping service. The territorial legislature approved the plan but the U.S. Congress blocked it before the fleet could be established. To deal with the Spanish flu, In October 1918 Riggs ordered doctors to meet arriving steamships upon arrival to inspect for signs of the virus and that transport firms refuse passage to the territory by anyone who was ill. The precautions were unsuccessful with the first case reaching Juneau on October 14 and widespread outbreaks being present a month later. In response to the flu's arrival, Riggs established a cordon sanitaire on all trails to the interior, but unfortunately the couriers carrying announcements of the quarantine may have also spread the disease. The native population proved especially vulnerable, with up to an eight percent mortality rate during the pandemic. This left hundreds of orphans and entire villages who's populations were unable to perform basic activities such as prepare meals or chop firewood. In response, Riggs exceeded authorized funding levels in his spending on medical supplies, maintaining the quarantine, and providing relief efforts. The territory's financial situation was further complicated when a request for a US$200,000 special allocation was cut in half by the U.S. Senate and rejected completely by the U.S. House of Representatives. The end of his term of office came after the election of Warren Harding as President of the United States. Riggs left office on June 15, 1921, making way for Republican appointee Scott Cordelle Bone. Later life Following his time in office, Riggs moved to New York State, establishing his residence in Millbrook and an office in New York City. There he worked in the mining, oil, and construction industries and was named Vice-President of Macassa Mines, Ltd. of Canada. On August 2, 1935, Riggs was named the United States Commissioner to the International Boundary Commission. Riggs died on January 16, 1945 in Washington D.C.. He was buried in Baltimore, Maryland.

It is modeled after business requirements specification (CONOPS), also known as a stakeholder requirements specification (StRS). The software requirements specification lays out functional and non- functional requirements, and it may include a set of use cases that describe user interactions that the software must provide to the user for perfect interaction. Software requirements specification establishes the basis for an agreement between customers and contractors or suppliers on how the software product should function (in a market-driven project, these roles may be played by the marketing and development divisions). Software requirements specification is a rigorous assessment of requirements before the more specific system design stages, and its goal is to reduce later redesign. It should also provide a realistic basis for estimating product costs, risks, and schedules. Used appropriately, software requirements specifications can help prevent software project failure. The software requirements specification document lists sufficient and necessary requirements for the project development. To derive the requirements, the developer needs to have clear and thorough understanding of the products under development. This is achieved through detailed and continuous communications with the project team and customer throughout the software development process. The SRS may be one of a contract's deliverable data item descriptions or have other forms of organizationally-mandated content. Typically a SRS is written by a technical writer, a systems architect, or a software programmer. Donn Le Vie, Jr. \\"Writing Software Requirements Specifications (SRS)\\". 2010\\\\. Structure An example organization of an SRS is as follows: #Purpose ##Definitions ##Background ##System overview ##References #Overall description ##Product perspective ###System Interfaces ###User interfaces ###Hardware interfaces ###Software interfaces ###Communication Interfaces ###Memory constraints ##Design constraints ###Operations ###Site adaptation requirements ##Product functions ##User characteristics ##Constraints, assumptions and dependencies #Specific requirements ##External interface requirements ##Functional requirements ##Performance requirements ##Logical database requirement ##Software system attributes ###Reliability ###Availability ###Security ###Maintainability ###Portability ##Functional requirements ###Functional partitioning ###Functional description ###Control description ##Environment characteristics ###Hardware ###Peripherals ###Users ##Other Goals The software requirements specification (SRS) is a communication tool between users and software designers. The specific goals of the SRS are as follows: * Facilitating reviews * Describing the scope of work * Providing a reference to software designers (i.e. navigation aids, document structure) * Providing a framework for testing primary and secondary use cases * Including features to customer requirements * Providing a platform for ongoing refinement (via incomplete specs or questions) Requirements smell Following the idea of code smells, the notion of requirements smell has been proposed to describe issues in requirements specification where the requirement is not necessarily wrong but could be problematic. Examples of requirements smells are subjective language, ambiguous adverbs and adjectives, superlatives and negative statements.

Background John Franklin Alexander Strong was born in Salmon Creek, New Brunswick, Canada to Adam Robert and Janet (Nicholl) Strong on October 15, 1856. He graduated from the New Brunswick Normal School in 1874. After graduation he spent the next fourteen years working as a store owner and teacher throughout the province. On December 31, 1879 he married Elizabeth A. Aitkens of Fredericton, New Brunswick. The marriage produced three children: Jane, Elizabeth, and Robert. He committed bigamyhttp://cityofdawson.com/history-pages/michael-gates/a-canadian-poser- governed-alaska-for-five-years in 1896 when he wed Anna Hall of Tacoma, Washington. Strong joined the Klondike Gold Rush in 1897. During his travels he worked at newspapers in Dawson City, Skagway, Alaska, and Nome, Alaska. In 1905 he established The Nome Nugget. Strong left Alaska in 1906 to work as an Editor for papers in Tonopah, Nevada and Greenwater, California. He returned to Alaska the next year, publishing the Herald in Katalla. In 1910 he founded the Nugget in Iditarod before becoming publisher of Juneau's Alaska Daily Empire in 1912. Governorship President Woodrow Wilson nominated Strong to become governor of Alaska Territory on April 17, 1913. The nomination was in keeping with a 1912 Democratic plank calling for territorial governors to be area residents. The new governor was sworn into office on May 21, 1913. Soon after becoming governor, Strong was faced with a financial crisis. The territory's salmon canneries, claiming the recently enacted tax on canned salmon was illegal, refused to pay. The tax was a major source of income for the territory and the lack of funds thus created severely limited Strong's ability to implement development projects. This issue continued until after the governor left office. Significant legislation signed into law by Governor Strong included the granting of United States citizenship to members of the indigenous population that gave up tribal life, implementation of workers' compensation and the United States' first old age pension, authorization of a territorial university, and creation of a Board of Education. Additionally, in 1917, the voters in the territory approved a prohibition referendum. Other changes affecting the territory was the authorization for construction of the Alaska Railroad in October 1914, loosening of federal controls on road building and coal mining, and creation of Mount McKinley National Park in 1917. President Wilson declined to reappoint Strong to a second term as governor and his final day in office came in April 1918. According to U.S. Senator, and Alaskan history expert, Ernest Gruening this was because the President has been given information indicating the Canadian-born Strong had never been naturalized as a United States Citizen. Later life After leaving office, Strong established his home in Seattle, Washington while wintering in Los Angeles. In 1922 he began a world tour. After spending a year in India, he returned to the United States in 1924. Strong died on July 27, 1929 in Seattle from a heart attack.

In addition to his journalistic activities, he served as the last Governor of the District of Alaska from 1909 to 1912, and the first Governor of Alaska Territory from 1912 to 1913. Background Clark was born on January 7, 1869 to Oren Andrus and Jeannette (Jones) Clark in Ashford, Connecticut. He was educated in public school and in 1887 graduated from the Connecticut State Normal School (now Central Connecticut State University). Clark taught at a school in Waterville, Connecticut before becoming Principal of Manchester, Connecticut's grade school. In 1891 he enrolled at Williston Seminary. From there he went to Wesleyan University and graduated with a Bachelor of Philosophy in 1895. Following his graduation, Clark worked briefly in Hartford as a reporter for The Hartford Post. From there he moved to Washington, D.C. where he became a telegraph editor for the Washington Times. He followed this by a stint as a Washington correspondent for the New York Commercial Advertiser before joining The Sun's Washington bureau in 1897. Clark remained with The Sun until 1909, adding the roles of Washington correspondent for the Seattle Post- Intelligencer in 1900 and The Globe (Toronto) in 1904. Clark married Lucy Harrison Norvell of Washington D.C. on January 15, 1898. Alaska Clark was appointed Governor of the District of Alaska by President William Howard Taft on May 18, 1909. The president considered the new governor to be knowledgeable about the district because Clark had prospected for gold near Nome, Alaska for a short time in 1900 and traveled through the district in both 1903 and 1906. This view was however not universally held, with some Alaskans viewing the new governor as a carpetbagger. As governor, Clark attempted to bring the district's various political factions together. One point where he differed from the majority of Alaskans was on the issue of territorial status, which the governor opposed. Clark's opposition was based upon Alaska's small population (36,556 whites) and the general lack of transportation infrastructure throughout the district. His opposition however became moot when Republicans lost control of the United States House of Representatives during the 1910 election. With the House under Democratic control, legislation granting Alaska territorial status was pushed through and became effective on August 24, 1912. During the territory's first legislative session, Clark signed laws creating a variety of regulatory agencies and implementing compulsory education, juvenile courts, eight-hour days for workers in many industries, and women's suffrage. The legislature also followed his recommendation to impose a tax on the canning of salmon. His last day in office came on May 21, 1913 when he resigned to make way for Wilson appointee John Franklin Alexander Strong. Later life After leaving office, Clark moved to Charleston, West Virginia. There he purchased the News Mail and changed the paper's name to the Daily Mail. Clark served as publisher and editor in chief of the Daily Mail for the rest of his life. Lucy Harrison Norvell Clark died in May 1928. The former governor remarried the next year, wedding Juliet (Staunton) Clay on August 13, 1929. Socially he was a member of Charleston's Edgewood Club, the Metropolitan Club, the Arctic Club, and Washington's Chevy Chase Club. He was also cultivated an interest in rose cultivation. In this role he founded the Charleston Rose Society in 1922 and served as President of the American Rose Society in 1928 through 1929. Additionally he was a judge at the 1929 International Rose Show. In 1945, Clark received an honorary Doctor of Letters from Wesleyan University. That same year he experienced a heart attack and suffered from poor health for the next five years. Clark died in Charleston from another heart attack on February 4, 1950.

Background Hoggatt was born to Isabell (Bacon) and William M Hoggatt on September 11, 1865 in Paoli, Indiana. He attended the United States Naval Academy, graduating in June 1884 before beginning his career as a naval officer. In 1889 Hoggatt received a four-year assignment to the US Coast and Geodetic Survey in which he surveyed the coastal waters of southeastern Alaska. On June 12, 1893, Hoggatt married Marie Hayden of St. Louis in Washington D.C. The marriage lasted until her death in 1900. In June 1893, he graduated from the Columbian University Law School of the District of Columbia (now George Washington University Law School) with an LL.B.. He then served as a legal officer in the Judge Advocate General's Corps and as Assistant Chief of the Bureau of Equipment at the United States Naval Observatory. During the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Hoggatt was appointed to the Naval Board of Strategy by President William McKinley. Hoggatt resigned from the U.S. Navy in August 1898 and enrolled in the Columbia University School of Mines. After a year, he moved with his brother Herbert to Juneau, Alaska. There the pair purchased some mining claims and established the Juneau Mines Company at nearby Berners Bay. The business was a financial success and Hoggatt served as the company's manager. Governorship President Theodore Roosevelt appointed Hoggatt Governor of the District of Alaska on March 10, 1906. The new governor remarried on February 25 of the next year. His second marriage, to Clarissa Eames Millard of Utica, New York, produced three daughters: Clarissa, Isabelle, and Elinor. The new governor was a strong proponent of economic development, with expanded coal mining being a focus of his efforts. He viewed coal as a useful energy source and needed material for establishing railroads within the district. Hoggatt was thwarted in his efforts however, first by the U.S. Congress, who were looking to control the growth of new monopolies, passing legislation limiting the size of mining districts. Then in November 1906, President Roosevelt barred all coal-mining on public lands. As the vast majority of Alaska was owned by the federal government, this effectively prohibited coal mining in Alaska. Another frustration for Hoggatt was his inability to convince the federal legislature to revise surveying laws. This created problems for homesteaders and gold miners wishing to move to Alaska. Hoggatt did oversee the move of Alaska's capital from Sitka to Juneau. In a break with the majority of the district's population, the governor opposed granting territorial status. This was due to Hoggatt fearing that potential new taxes created by a territorial legislature would discourage further economic development. The end of Hoggatt's term as governor came on May 18, 1909 when he resigned to make way for President William Howard Taft's appointment of Walter Eli Clark. Later life Following his term in office, Hoggart returned to his position as a mining manager. He stayed there until 1912 when he became President of the Keyes Product Company in New London, Connecticut. Hoggart remained with the fiber board manufacturer until the company's dissolution in 1926. The former governor then moved to New York City where he spent the rest of his life, the final two years in declining health. Hoggart died on February 26, 1938 in The Bronx. He was buried in Utica, New York.

Originally used and made in China, since the late 20th century, silk comforters have become more common in Western market areas. Their increasing popularity stems from a combination of factors, including their thermal properties, their light weight, and their natural hypoallergenic properties. The opening of the Chinese market to the world since the 1990s has also played a significant role in the spread of silk comforters, as China is both the world's biggest silk producer and silk comforter manufacturer.  Production and processing  Silk comes from the cocoons of the silkworm, which feeds off mulberry trees in subtropical climates. When the cocoon is boiled, the hard cocoon becomes a loose ball of strong, flexible filament measuring over 1,000 meters. Usually, this ball is uncoiled and wrapped on a spindle for use in the textile industry. Silk is used for making everything from clothing to rugs. During silk comforter production, however, the silk filament is not unraveled, but rather stretched into a flat tangled web and layered to form silk floss, which will fill the comforter. The cocoons are first boiled to loosen the sericin holding the filaments together and kill the silkworm. Each cocoon is stretched by hand on a U-shaped wooden rack, and the ball of thread becomes a sheet of tangled fibers. This sheet is then hand-stretched again on a larger rack, along with several other cocoons to make a thick, cottony bundle called silk floss. It takes hundreds of these bundles to make a silk comforter. Once enough silk cocoons have been stretched into bundles, the comforter begins to take shape. Workers grab the edges of the bundle and stretch it wide to match the dimensions of the desired comforter, and layer by layer the comforter begins to take shape. It can take anywhere between 100 and 400 of these thin layers to make a comforter, depending on bed dimensions and desired thickness. Since it takes many cocoons to make each layer, a silk comforter may be composed of thousands of silk cocoons. Once the silk fiber layers are stacked together, they are sealed inside silk or cotton fabrics and the comforter is complete. The result is extremely light-weight despite the silk comforter's thickness. Silk comforters provide excellent insulating properties similar to down, but tend to be less bulky than down duvets. Silk is a breathable fabric, making silk comforters comfortable in a wide temperature range. Thin silk comforters are used even in the summer. In the U.S., silk comforters are imported mainly from China or Taiwan and are priced about the same as down comforters. Unlike other natural fibers used in comforters, silk is naturally hypoallergenic, and it does not require any processing chemicals during the manufacturing process. A silk comforter is a good alternative for people who are allergic to goose down comforters.See for more details and photos of construction process.  Silk comforter care  Silk comforters are easy to care for: they only need to be dried under the sun twice a year to maintain their freshness. If more thorough cleaning is required, a silk comforter should be dry-cleaned, since the silk floss layers are damaged by contact with water. They may have a fairly strong smell to them, attributed to the remaining pupa. There is some difference of opinion about how easy it is to get rid of the smell.  Cost in China  In November 2017, at a large government silk products store in Shanghai, the cost for a 100% silk queen- sized 2 kg silk quilt (duvet, comforter) had the 'fixed price' of Yuan 1880 or approximately U.S. $285 (there are no additional costs). Government fixed- price stores, which one can apparently trust as regards quality, sometimes allow customers to bargain. The price is composed of two parts: one is the silk filler, and the other is the cotton cover.

The game was designed very much as a standard third-person shooter, but used a world populated by cute little animals as its setting. As a result, the game's depiction of violence is very cartoon-like without losing any of its intensity. In 2001, an updated version for the PlayStation 2 was released as Fur Fighters: Viggo's Revenge. On 20 July 2012, members of Muffin Games, ex-Bizarre Creations staff, announced a conversion for iPad, called Fur Fighters: Viggo on Glass. Plot The plot of the game revolves around the Fur Fighters, a group dedicated to fighting against General Viggo, the game's main antagonist. At the beginning of the game, Viggo kidnaps the families of the Fur Fighters, stranding their children around the game's various locations and turning the spouses (Or in Tweek's case, mother) into robotic beasts. The story is rather loose, revolving around the Fur Fighters' quest to rescue their babies, save their family and stop General Viggo. Gameplay In Fur Fighters, the player's job is to rescue the tiny animal babies who have been taken from their families by the central villain, General Viggo. Viggo has scattered these babies all over the world, requiring the Fur Fighter families to explore, confront Viggo's henchmen, and rescue all of them. The gameplay featured many unique aspects for a third-person shooter of the time it was released, most notably making each level an extremely large, expansive area that requires sometimes hours of involved exploration to locate the babies and get rid of the enemies. (Examples include a giant construction site and an entire section of a large city, complete with buildings to explore, including a complete museum of modern art.) Maneuvering through these levels often requires careful observation of the environment so as not to get lost, as well as solving puzzles to figure out where some babies might be hidden or how to gain access to more of the level. Unlike most action games of this type, Fur Fighters distinguishes itself by featuring a system where the player can, at many intervals on a level, switch between one of many animal parents. Each parent has their own advantages and disadvantages, with many having special abilities allowing them to do certain things easier. This substitute system also makes it easier for players who are low on hit points or ammunition to switch to a more suitable character. Reception Garrett Kenyon reviewed the Dreamcast version of the game for Next Generation, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"A game that's fun for kids and adults alike. It looks great and plays even better.\\" Daniel Erickson reviewed the PlayStation 2 version of the game for Next Generation, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \\"If you want a shooter or an adventure game, there are better places to turn.\\" The Dreamcast version of Fur Fighters received \\"favourable\\" reviews, while its PC version, along with Viggo's Revenge and Viggo on Glass, received \\"mixed or average reviews\\", according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. While the game was not a tremendous financial success and went almost unnoticed by the majority of gamers at the time, critically the game was almost universally praised for its size, scope, sense of humour, and attention to detail. The fact that mindless violence was not the sole gameplay element impressed many, and the game went on to become a cult classic of sorts. In an attempt to take the series further with a larger audience, a new version of the game entitled Fur Fighters: Viggo's Revenge was released in 2001 on the PlayStation 2. It met with mixed success as it was simply an update of the original game with a few minor features included (such as cel-shading and real voices for the characters).

Many years later, as an adult, Brady would approach the younger Theodore Roosevelt, then governor of New York, at a 1900 conference in Portland, Oregon. He warmly shook Roosevelt's hand and told him: > \\"Governor Roosevelt, the other governors have greeted you with interest, > simply as a fellow governor and a great American. but I greet you with > infinitely more interest, as the son of your father, the first Theodore > Roosevelt.\\" When greeted warmly by Governor Roosevelt and asked why and in > what special way he had been interested in his father, Governor Brady > replied, \\"Your father picked me up on the streets of New York, a waif and an > orphan, and sent me to a Western family, paying for my transportation and > early care.

The eleven-year-old Brady declared himself to be an orphan and, on August 2, 1859, boarded a train bound for Indiana. Over the course of the week-long journey, Brady forged what would be a lifelong friendship with Andrew Burke, another boy his age from Randall's. The boys got off the train at Noblesville, Indiana where they were taken to \\"Aunt\\" Jenny Fergusson's hotel, fed and, in turn, put on display for prospective adopters. Brady's experience as an orphan train rider is discussed in the book Orphan Trains: Taking the Rails to a New Life, by Rebecca Langston-George. Brady went to live with the family of John Green, of Tipton County, Indiana. Judge John Green recalled, \\"I decided to take John Brady home with me because I considered him the homeliest, toughest, most unpromising boy in the whole lot. I had a curious desire to see what could be made of such a specimen of humanity.\\" Brady attended Yale University and graduated in 1874. Brady married Elizabeth Jane Patton in 1887 in Sitka, Alaska. They had five children: John Green Brady Jr., Hugh P. Brady, Sheldon Jackson Brady, Mary Beattie Brady and Elizabeth P. Brady. District of Alaska Brady moved to the Alaska Territory first as a Presbyterian minister, then a missionary and then a lawyer. In 1878 he co-founded what is now Sheldon Jackson College as a school to train Alaska Natives. Later he would be appointed Governor for three terms. He was introduced to the infamous Alaskan gangster Soapy Smith during the 1898 Fourth of July festivities in Skagway. Brady was made aware of Smith's criminal activities and offered him a position as a Deputy U.S. Marshal in Sitka, if he would quit Skagway. Smith turned down the position, which Brady noted in a personal letter. Four days after meeting him, Smith was killed in the famed Shootout on Juneau Wharf. Governor Brady had an interest in preserving the culture of the Alaska natives. He orchestrated the placement of 15 Haida and Tlingit totem poles and two traditional houses for the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition. https://www.nps.gov/sitk/learn/historyculture/totem-poles.htm He was instrumental in the preservation and relocation of the totem poles from Old Kasaan village to Sitka shortly after Old Kasaan's abandonment.https://www.nps.gov/sitk/learn/historyculture/upload/OldKasan.pdf In 1897, Brady was appointed to be Governor of the Territory of Alaska by Republican President William McKinley. He served for three terms and became involved in the Reynolds-Alaska Development Company which was under investigation for corruption. U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ethan A. Hitchcock (Interior) (R) under Republican President Theodore Roosevelt, charged that Brady had acted improperly in his association with Reynolds- Alaska and public clamor soon led Brady to resign though he vigorously denied that he was guilty of any wrongdoing. Without charges, Brady was asked to resign in 1906 and went to work for Reynolds-Alaska. He was never convicted. Brady died on December 17, 1918 and was buried in Sitka National Cemetery in Sitka, Alaska. He was interred in Section R, Plot 4 in December 1918.

He arrived in India at age 24, studied the local language to spread the word of Bible in a vernacular language, studies that led him to author a text on comparative grammar of the South Indian languages. In his book, Caldwell proposed that there are Dravidian words in the Hebrew of the Old Testament, the archaic Greek language, and the places named by Ptolemy. Caldwell married Eliza Mault, the daughter of another missionary posted in India. He served as assistant bishop of Tirunelveli from 1877. The Government of Tamil Nadu has created a memorial in his honor and a postage stamp has been issued in his name.Robert Caldwell Stamps of India Retrieved 8 November 2010 A statue of Caldwell was erected in 1967 near to Marina Beach, Chennai, as a gift of the Church of South India. Early life Robert Caldwell was born at Clady, then in County Antrim, Ireland, on 7 May 1814 to poor Scottish Presbyterian parents. The family moved to Glasgow and there he began work at the age of nine. Mostly self-taught, he returned to Ireland aged 15, living with an older brother in Dublin while studying art between 1829 and 1833. He then returned to Glasgow, probably as a consequence of a crisis of faith, and he became active in the Congregational church. Caldwell won a scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford only to find it rescinded when the authorities discovered that he had been born in Ireland. He responded by joining the London Missionary Society, who sent him to the University of Glasgow for training. There Caldwell came under the influence of Daniel Keyte Sandford, a professor of Greek and promoter of Anglicanism whose innovative research encouraged Caldwell's liking for comparative philology and also theology. Caldwell left university with a distinction and was ordained as a Congregationalist minister. At 24, Caldwell arrived in Madras on 8 January 1838 as a missionary of the London Missionary Society and later joined the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel Mission (SPG). To further his missionary objectives, Caldwell realized that he had to be proficient in Tamil to proselytize the masses and he began a systematic study of the language. He was consecrated Bishop of Tirunelveli in 1877. In 1844, Caldwell married Eliza Mault (1822‚Äì99), with whom he had seven children. She was the younger daughter of the veteran Travancore missionary, Reverend Charles Mault (1791‚Äì1858) of the London Missionary Society. For more than forty years, Eliza worked in Idaiyangudi and Tirunelveli proselytizing the people, especially Tamil- speaking women.

Robert Caldwell wrote A Comparative Grammar of the Dravidian or South-Indian family of languages. He identified south Indian Brahmins with Indo-Europeans, which was partly based on his belief that the Indo-Europeans had \\"higher mental gifts and higher capacity for civilisation\\". Caldwell asserted that the low-caste Chanar were not merely Tamil speakers but an \\"indigenous Dravidian\\" people, distinct ethnically and, most critically for him, religiously, from their high-caste oppressors, whom he referred to as \\"Brahmanical Aryans\\" (in this case \\"Aryan\\" as an ethnic signifier for foreign and \\"Brahmanical\\" to signify the \\"Hinduism\\" of the high-caste). These wildly speculative claims, well outside the scope of linguistics, were intended \\"to develop a history which asserted that the indigenous Dravidians had been subdued and colonized by the Brahmanical Aryans\\". However, the first edition of Caldwell's grammar was \\"met with firm resistance\\" by the Chanars precisely because they \\"did not like the idea of being divorced from Brahmanical civilization\\", the very division Caldwell was hoping to exploit. The book has been described as being on occasion \\"pejorative, outrageous, and somewhat paternalistic. But on the whole, his studies represent a pioneering effort to understand religions completely foreign to the British mind\\". In the domain of Dravidian linguistics though, it remains a respected work today. Archaeological research While serving as Bishop of Tirunelveli (alongside Edward Sargent), Caldwell (who was not a trained archaeologist) did much original research on the history of Tirunelveli. He studied palm leaf manuscripts and Sangam literature in his search, and made several excavations, finding the foundations of ancient buildings, sepulchral urns and coins with the fish emblem of the Pandyan Kingdom. This work resulted in his book A Political and General History of the District of Tinnevely (1881), published by the Government of the Madras Presidency. Holy Trinity Church built by missionary Robert Caldwell, situated in Idayankudi, Caldwell was a Bishop of Tirunelveli. Life's work Caldwell‚Äôs mission lasted more than fifty years. The publication of his research into both the languages and the history of the region, coupled with his position in both Indian and English society, gave stimulus to the revival of the Non-Brahmin movement. Meanwhile, on difficult ground for evangelism, Caldwell achieved Christian conversion among the lower castes. He had adopted some of the methods of the Lutheran missionaries of earlier times, having learned German purely in order to study their practices. Caldwell the Tamil language scholar, Christian evangelist and champion of the native church,Kumaradoss, Robert Caldwell, pp. 277-278. remains today an important figure in the modern history of South India. He is still remembered there, and his statue, erected eighty years after his death, stands near the Marina Beach at Chennai. The Indian historian Dr M.S.S. Pandian, Visiting Fellow at the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies in Delhi, recently commented that Caldwell‚Äôs \\"contribution to both Christianity in South India and the cultural awakening of the region is unmatched during the last two hundred years\\".Dr M.S.S.

He was also a member of the Vermont House of Representatives from 1884 to 1885. Early life and education Knapp was born November 5, 1837 in Somerset, Vermont to Hiram and Elvira (Stearns) Knapp. He was educated in Manchester, Vermont, first attending Burr and Burton Seminary and then graduating with a Bachelor of Arts from Middlebury College in 1862.  Career  = Military service = After graduating from college, Knapp enlisted as a private in the Company I, 16th Vermont Infantry and was quickly promoted to captain of Company F, 17th Vermont Infantry. During his military service, he was wounded at Gettysburg, Spotsylvania, and Petersburg. Knapp rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel and was brevetted a colonel for his gallantry during the Siege of Petersburg. = Vermont = Following the war, Knapp returned to Vermont where he published the Middlebury Register from 1865 till 1878. In addition to the work on his own newspaper, he submitted articles to the Chicago Inter-Ocean and the American Law Register. Beyond his journalistic efforts, Knapp served as Clerk of the Vermont Legislature during the 1872-3 session. After being admitted to the bar in 1876, he served as a probate judge for the Addison district from 1879‚Äì89. Knapp was also elected for a term in the Vermont House of Representatives from 1884 to 1885. =Governor of Alaska= Knapp was appointed Governor of the District of Alaska by President Benjamin Harrison, his term beginning on April 20, 1889. At the time of his appointment, many Alaskans desired a resident governor and were disappointed receiving an \\"outsider\\". The district did, however, see a number of improvements during his administration. Postal service was extended with the creation of over of new mail routes. Knapp also helped establish a historical society and library. On the legal front, Knapp asked for Alaska to be granted a Delegate to the U.S. Congress. He also supported creation of a commission to revise the district's legal code and, arguing that lack of clear land possession discouraged improvements, lobbied for a revision of the land possession laws. To help maintain law and order, Knapp help organize both a militia and Indian police. The former turned into a source of amusement for some area residents due to the governor's predilection for dressing in his military uniform and watch the militia parade before him. During his term, an international dispute over seal fisheries reached a zenith. The United States, claiming that seals from Alaska were being killed by Canadian and other ships on the high seas, had seized several ships and brought them to Sitka. Arbitration to resolve the dispute was agreed to in 1891 between Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. As a result a set of restrictions was imposed on seal hunting near Alaska. Knapp was replaced as governor on August 29, 1893, following the appointment of James Sheakley by President Grover Cleveland. =Later career= Following his term as governor, Knapp moved to Seattle and opened a law practice. He was active in civil organizations such as the Institute of Civics and National Geographic Society and received an Honorary LL.D. from Whitman College in 1893. Knapp was also the founder and President of the Anti-Saloon League of Washington. He remained active in the practice of law until his death on October 9, 1904.  Personal life  On January 23, 1865, Knapp married Martha A Severance of Middlebury, Vermont. The couple had four children.

He trained as a printer, worked in Minnesota and Wisconsin before becoming the editor and publisher of the Mining Journal in Marquette, Michigan. From this base he became active in politics and was elected Mayor of Marquette and to a term in the Michigan House of Representatives before his appointment as governor. Background Swineford was born in Ashland, Ohio, on September 14, 1836. He was educated in local public schools before being apprenticed at age 15 to a printer, first in Ashford and later in Columbus, Ohio. At the end of his apprenticeship, in 1853, he began Albert Lea, Minnesota's first newspaper, the Southern Star. From there he started the Banner in La Crescent before establishing the Union Democrat in La Crosse. In 1860, Swineford sold his interests in his newspapers and moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where he published the Daily Inquirer. He became head of Oshkosh's Review in 1864 before moving to Fond du Lac to operate the Democratic Press a year later. Swineford moved to Negaunee, Michigan, in 1867 where he joined the Mining and Manufacturing News. Following a merger of papers he became editor and publisher of the Mining Journal in Marquette. He remained in this position until 1884. Swineford married Psyche Cyntheria Flower in January 1875 in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. The marriage produced one daughter before Psyche's death in 1881. Michigan politics While in Michigan, Swineford became active in Democratic politics. In 1871, he was elected to a seat in the Michigan House of Representatives. This was followed by his selection as a delegate to the 1872. The first of time he was selected, he later served as a delegate during the 1884 convention. In 1883, Swineford was selected as State Commissioner of Mineral Statistics for Michigan. He also made an unsuccessful run for Lieutenant Governor of Michigan that year. He began a two-year term as mayor of Marquette, Michigan, in 1884. Swineford also was Michigan's representative to the World Cotton Centennial in New Orleans. Alaska President Grover Cleveland appointed Swineford as Governor of the District of Alaska on May 9, 1885. He supported granting Alaska territorial status. Following the inauguration of President William McKinley, Swineford's term of office ended on April 20, 1889. Later life After leaving office, Swineford returned to Michigan. In 1893, with the return of President Cleveland to the White House, many Alaskans hoped the former governor would be reappointed to office. President Cleveland, bowing to special interests opposed to Swineford, instead appointed him Inspector General of the United States Land Office. In this office he oversaw the 1898 opening of the Cherokee Outlet. In 1898, Swineford moved back to Alaska. That same year he published the book, Alaska: Its History, Climate and Natural Resources, Hardcover. In alignment with his mining interests, he published the Ketchikan Mining Journal from 1901 till 1905 and the Ketchikan Mines from 1907 till 1908.

She lives in the woods located at the mountains of Pohjola; she is described as having \\"hair-plait reached to her heels and whose breasts hung down to her knees\\" similar to the Swedish Skogsnufva, Danish 'seawoman', or the wildfraulein of the eifel. Ajatar is the granddaughter of Hiisi (the master of the woods and spreader of disease) and is the master of Lempo and Gnomes. Through her connections with Hiisi and Lempo, she is said to spread disease and pestilence. She is closely associated with serpents, and is often depicted in modern art as a dragon or half-humanoid and serpentine figure.  Etymology  The word ‚Äúajatar‚Äù is possibly derived from the Finnish word ajaa, ‚Äúto pursue\\" (also, \\"to drive\\"). The feminine suffix ‚Äú-tar-‚Äù appears in several Finnish names, including a variation of Louhi (Louhetar, Loviatar, Louhiatar) and Sy√∂j√§t√§r (sy√∂d√§ ‚Äòto eat,‚Äô with the feminine suffix of -tar, means ‚Äòdevourer, vampire‚Äô). Applying this to Ajatar, the verb ajaa is suffixed by the feminine \\"-tar,\\" translating as ‚Äúfemale pursuer.‚Äù The name may as well have its root in aika 'time', from where ajatar would be an equally regular derivative. Or both. Aika and ajaa might be etymologically connected through the sense of time, like death, hunting oneself. In other media =Derivative works= Although Ajatar does not appear by name in documented Finnish folk songs, she appears in fiction inspired by the Kalevala and in modern fantasy interpretations. *In the second act of Aleksis Kivi‚Äôs play, Kullervo (1860), Ajatar is described as ferocious and shameless, encouraging the protagonist to kill his master‚Äôs family. Ajatar states that she lives in the mountains, has Lempo and Gnomes in her service, and that her mother‚Äôs father is Hiisi. Ajatar is further described as ‚Äúnasty‚Äù and compared to a ‚Äúvicious wife who rejoices in evils.‚Äù *In The Eye of Disparager: Book One of the Legend of the Bloodstone written by Brett Stuart Smith, Ajatar is a beautiful woman with the upper body of a green scaled woman and the lower half made up of many snakes. She has serpentine fangs and seductive eyes, and is the mother of all snakes. *Ajatar is mentioned twice in Matt Smith‚Äôs Big Game: Movie Tie-in Edition. Smith referred to her as ‚Äúthe Devil of the Woods who appeared as a dragon and made you sick if you so much as looked at her‚Äù and later associations a force of nature to her destructive powers. *Fantasy author, Philip Mazza, portrays the Ajatar as a race of fire breathing dragons, causing pestilence and disease. In his book, The Harrow: From Under a Tree, Mazza describes two races of Ajatar, black and red, which fight amongst each other. One race, the black dragons, are evil whereas the red race are described as more benevolent. *In the novel Beneath The Mantle by Ahimsa Kerp, Ajatar is a secondary antagonist serving Ra, the Sun God. =Christian references= In some Finnish translations of The Bible the term ajatar is used to refer to certain demons or devils : *In Leviticus [17.7] of the Finnish Bible (1776 ed., see also Bible translations into Finnish), a variation of Ajatar‚Äôs name (Ajattaroille = to the Ajattaras/Ajatars) appears to use her as a general devil or demon and not a separate entity. ::\\"Ja ei mill√§√§n muotoa en√§√§ uhriansa uhraaman ajattaroille, joiden kanssa he huorin tehneet ovat.

It was founded in 1988 by Val Popescu, Merle Schultz, Gary Gibson, John Spracklen, and Bruce Lightner. The company is not well known to the general public as none of its designs were ever manufactured in volume. The company is known within the computer architecture community as it published articles in technical journals in the early 1990s that described how an out- of-order with speculative execution CPU might be designed. This was one of the first publicly disclosed OoO designs from a non-academic source. The Lightning project was a SPARC-based multi-chip processor that was designed according to these principles. The chips were designed and built by LSI Logic, but that support went away before full production could be reached. The Thunder project was a follow-on that was funded by Hyundai. Hyundai gained control of the company in 1994. This project did not go into production either. The company was acquired by ST Microelectronics (called SGS Thomson Microelectronics at the time) in 1998. ST Micro originally wanted this design team to work on an Intel IA-32 clone, but eventually the team was used for non-personal computer SOCs. It is rumored that Metaflow collaborated with the Intel team that would eventually design the Pentium Pro, the first commercially available Out-of- Order x86 processor. Following STMicroelectronics' acquisition in May 1997 of a majority stake in Metaflow,MPR 6/23/97, p. 4 the relationship between the companies soured. Sources indicate that the two were unable to agree on which direction to take Metaflow's technology, creating a rift that resulted in ST's buying out Metaflow's last remaining founders: President Val Popescu, Vice President Bruce Lightner, and Director of Engineering Gary Gibson. Gibson has since taken a position with Mosart Systems, working on some as-yet-undisclosed new processor. The originator of much of the technology underlying today's superscalar out-of-order microprocessors, Metaflow was never able to reap its just rewards. Begun in 1985, the company's first project, a SPARC-based ECL gate-array processor, was supplanted in 1989 by Lightning, a CMOS design backed by funding and IC-design resources from Hyundai. But the division of labor between the two companies proved stormy, and in 1991 Lightning was discharged, creating Thunder‚Äîa 0.8-micrometre three-chip processor designed entirely by Metaflow.MPR 2/12/92, p. 9 In 1995, the company successfully demonstrated an 80-MHz Thunder processor‚Äîwhich delivered 2.5 SPECint92/MHz‚Äîjust as Hyundai decided it wanted x86-based processors instead of SPARCs. Metaflow had a brush with success in the early 1990s when, working under contract to Intel, it convinced the processor giant that out-of-order design offered the best hope for building fast x86 processors. In fact, sources indicate that inside Intel the P6 was initially referred to as the \\"Metaflow processor.\\" Sources have also revealed that Intel actually tried to buy Metaflow, but Andy Grove, unable to come to terms with Hyundai, had to abort the purchase. Intel subsequently acquired the IP rights to Metaflow's technology through a patent cross-license with Hyundai for DRAM technology. The Pentium Pro using a centralized reservation station and instant repair of out-of-order and speculative execution, bears the clear mark of Metaflow¬πs involvement. More than 150 Intel patents cite Metaflow intellectual property as prior art. In 1997, frustrated by the inability to control its own IP and thus its own destiny, Metaflow convinced Hyundai to sell out to ST. Since then, ST and Metaflow have been jointly developing an x86-based processor. But, already unhappy with ST's plans for that part as well as with its lackluster process technology, Metaflow's leaders were pushed over the brink when ST traded Metaflow's IP to IBM in an x86-for-PowerPC swap.MPR 8/3/98, p. 10 Some Metaflow designers continue to work on ST's x86 project, but with the leaders gone and ST more interested in the low end of the x86 market, chances are slim that the x86 chip will ever see daylight‚Äîespecially now that ST has a Pentium-class x86 project under way in India. ST officials declined to comment, other than to acknowledge that ST has indeed taken full ownership of Metaflow and to express confidence in the design team that remains.

Spending most of his life in the dry goods business, he was also Treasurer of Nevada Territory, a member of the Nevada Constitutional Convention in 1864, and the first United States official to hold office in Alaska. Biography =Background= Kinkead was born in the now defunct town of Smithfield in Somerset County, Pennsylvania on October 10, 1826 to Catherine (Bushey) and James S. Kinkead. He attended elementary school in Zanesville, Ohio and high school in Lancaster, Ohio. At age 18, Kinkead became a clerk at a dry goods store. In 1849, he moved to Salt Lake City, Utah where, with I. M. Livingston, he founded the dry goods firm Livingston & Kinkead. In 1854 Kinkead moved to California, working at various jobs before settling in Marysville. There, on January 1, 1856, he married Elizabeth Falls. The marriage produced no children. However, much later, they adopted a boy named Kahtz from Alaska. He died at the age of 12. During 1856, Kinkead attempted to establish a dry goods business in New York City. Unsuccessful in this effort, he returned to California at the end of the year. There Kinkead suffered a series of business setbacks. =Early political career= Prompted by the discovery of silver in the area, Kinkead moved to Carson City, Utah Territory. While operating his dry goods store, he became involved in the organization of Nevada Territory. Kinkead was appointed Nevada's first Territorial Treasurer, a position he held from 1862 to 1864, and in 1864 served as a member of the Nevada Constitutional Convention. By mid-1867, Kinkead was without work and journeyed to Alaska with the \\"Occupancy\\" Commission. As part of the commission, he witnessed the transfer of Alaska from Russian to American possession. He also became the first United States official to hold office in Alaska when he was appointed postmaster by President Andrew Johnson. In addition to his postal duties, Kinkead operated a trading post and served as Sitka, Alaska's unofficial mayor. =Governorships= Kinkead returned to Nevada in 1871, settling in the town of Unionville. There he engaged in various milling, mining, and mercantile efforts within Humboldt and Lander counties. His efforts during this period included founding Washoe City, building smelters in Pleasant Valley and Austin, and becoming an early promoter for the Virginia and Truckee Railroad. Running on the Republican ticket, Kinkead was elected Governor of Nevada for the term running from January 1, 1879 to January 1, 1883. While in office he supported mining efforts, creation of toll roads, and the interests of the Virginia and Truckee Railroad. At the end of his term, the governor declined to run for reelection. Acting on the recommendation of U.S. Senator John P. Jones, President Chester Arthur appointed Kinkead as governor of the new formed District of Alaska on July 4, 1884. Arriving at his new post in early September, his only gubernatorial report was submitted in October. In the report he asked for establishment of a legal code and creation of a tax collection agency for the district, a boat to allow the governor to travel within Alaska, expanded financial aid, and initiation of new mail services. During his term, Kinkead suffered a broken arm and a stroke. He also had to deal with a rift between himself and influential Presbyterian missionary Sheldon Jackson, who differed with the governor on the trustworthiness of the district's mining interests. Upon the instigation of the Alaskan District Attorney, the missionary was arrested on trumped up charges. The resulting scandal gained national attention with the governor receiving a portion of the blame for the incident. Kinkead submitted his resignation on May 9, 1885. After leaving office, Kinkead returned to Carson City, Nevada and resumed his mining and mercantile efforts. He died on August 15, 1904 and was buried in the Lone Mountain Cemetery.

The effect is due to the peculiar velocities of the galaxies causing a Doppler shift in addition to the redshift caused by the cosmological expansion. Redshift-space distortions (RSDs) manifest in two particular ways. The Fingers of God effect is where the galaxy distribution is elongated in redshift space, with an axis of elongation pointed toward the observer. It is caused by a Doppler shift associated with the random peculiar velocities of galaxies bound in structures such as clusters. The large velocities that lead to this effect are associated with the gravity of the cluster by means of the virial theorem; they change the observed redshifts of the galaxies in the cluster. The deviation from the Hubble's law relationship between distance and redshift is altered, and this leads to inaccurate distance measurements. A closely related effect is the Kaiser effect, in which the distortion is caused by the coherent motions of galaxies as they fall inwards towards the cluster center as the cluster assembles. Depending on the particular dynamics of the situation, the Kaiser effect usually leads not to an elongation, but an apparent flattening (\\"pancakes of God\\"), of the structure. It is a much smaller effect than the fingers of God, and can be distinguished by the fact that it occurs on larger scales. The previous effects are a consequence of special relativity, and have been observed in real data. There are additional effects that arise from general relativity. One is gravitational redshift distortion, which arises from the net gravitational redshift, or blueshift, that is acquired when the photon climbs out of the gravitational potential well of the distant galaxy and then falls into the potential well of the Milky Way galaxy. This effect will make galaxies at a higher gravitational potential than Earth appear slightly closer, and galaxies at lower potential will appear farther away. The other effects of general relativity on clustering statistics are observed when the light from a background galaxy passes near, or through, a closer galaxy or cluster. These two effects are the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect (ISW) and gravitational lensing. In ISW, when a photon passes through a low area of gravitational potential it is shielded from the cosmological expansion of space, making the background galaxy appear closer. Gravitational lensing, unlike all of the previous effects, distorts the apparent position, and number, of background galaxies. The RSDs measured in galaxy redshift surveys can be used as a cosmological probe in their own right, providing information on how structure formed in the Universe, and how gravity behaves on large scales.

The nine major ethnic groups of Eritrea‚ÄîAfar, Bilen, Hedareb, Kunama, Nara, Rashaida, Saho, Tigre and Tigrinya‚Äîcelebrate autonomous music-making expressed through a rich heritage of vocalists, instrumentalists and activities within the country and throughout the international diaspora. The country‚Äôs music is informed by a range of ethnolinguistic group dynamics in the region, by its shared pre- colonial history with and revolutionized independence from Ethiopia, and by its exposure to globalized American music in the mid-twentieth century. Notable Eritrean musicians Notable Eritrean musicians were Edris wad Amir, Ibrahim wad goret, Edris M.Ali, Zainab Bashir,Fatima Ibrahim, Engineer Asgedom Woldemichael, Wad Asheikh, Yemane Baria, Osman Abderrehim, Alamin Abdeletif and Atowe Birhan Segid. Yemane Baria wrote one political song, and he was in jail.Mussie Tesfagiorgis G (2011). Eritrea (Africa in Focus). ABC Clio. p. 255. . Also of note is Bereket Mengistab, who has had a lengthy career, and 1960s musicians Haile Ghebru and Tewolde Redda.

Folk music Folk musicians used traditional instruments include the stringed kraar, kebero, lyre. Tesfuy Mehari Fihira and Wedi Sheik were notable folk musicians. Popular music Modern Eritrean popular music can be traced back to the late 1960s , when the MaHber Theatre Asmara began to produce stars like Osman Abderrehim, Alamin Abdeletif, Yemane Ghebremichael (commonly known as Yemane Baria), Jabber, Ateweberhan Seghid, Yonus Ibrahim, Tsehaytu Beraki, Tewolde Redda, Teberh Tesfahiwet and Tukabo Weldemariam.http://denbe.asmarino.com/MusicReview/MusicReviewAAH.htm Asmarino.com Since then, some musicians, like kraar-player Dawit Shilan, Yohannes Tikabo (also known as Wedi Tukabo), Dehab Faytinga (commonly known as Faytinga), the Asmara All Stars and Temesgen Gebreselassie (also known as Taniqo) have helped to incorporate the core indigenous Eritrean musical elements in popular music. Dancing Traditional Eritrean Tigrinya dancing involves two main styles of dance. In the first which is called 'quda', the dancers form a circle and slowly circumambulator or move around in an endless circular motion to the rhythm of the music. Then, they cease the circular musical flow/motion and dance in pairs or 3's facing each other for a short while before resuming the circular motion in a file again. During this time, they shuffle their feet to the beat of the music and bob their shoulders in a rhythmic fashion. Female dancers usually move their shoulders more than the male dancers. The dancers round off their dancing by facing each other in twos and threes and moving their shoulders faster. This can also involve jumping and bending one's knees, as well as going down to the floor to sit in a squatting position while bobbing those shoulders and moving the head sideways to the strong drum beats. In the second style of dance, two groups (often a group of men and a group of women) line up and face each other. The dance features a skipping step to the music. Periodically, the two groups will change places, dancing across the floor and passing each other in the process. Traditional dances practiced by Eritrea's other Afro-Asiatic communities include those by the Saho, which involve jumping on each leg in rhythm with the beat. The related Afar, Tigre, Bilen and Hidareb have similar moves. Additionally, the Rashaida also have their own unique dances. Dancing by the Nilo-Saharan Kunama involves raising bead-strung legs in sync with the rhythm of the music. The related Nara have similar traditions.  Live music: piano bars The music scene in the Eritrean capital of Asmara has traditionally been known for setting the standard of Tigrinya music for listeners in Eritrea and Ethiopia. The relatively recent 'piano bar' phenomenon has been largely exclusive to Asmara because almost all contemporary musicians and singers live in the capital city. The piano bar culture became popular around 2004, when leading singers such as Dawit Shilan played at the Ha.Ko.Se.E cafe. At the time - live music in bars being a new experience in the city - the cafe was overcrowded over weekends and many customers had to be turned away. One of the intrinsic characteristics of the piano bars is that the artists remix a range of classic hits, instead of sticking to performing only their own songs. For example, Dawit Shilan playing Atewebrhan Segid‚Äôs 1970s jazz not only brought these classic song back to life, but showed his mastery of performance skills, particularly on the krar. Piano bars have thus provided a platform for jazz and blues artists - and to a lesser extent the local dance music known as Guayla. They have become sites for musicians to show their artistry, as they are not bound by the typical demands for upbeat music for dancing. After the success of gigs at the Ha.Ko.Se.E piano bar, other hotels and cafes were quick to catch on the business. Hotels such as Sunshine, Savana, Bologna cub and Ayele family have been hosting contemporary favourites such as Yohannes Tikabo, Tesfay Mengesha and Kahsai Haile regularly. In 2013, the Berhe Aiba Hotel started a new type of live performance by giving prominence to musicians rather than singers. Jazz classics were played, with singers such as Yohannes Tikabo only featuring on certain songs. Some of the best talents in Eritrean music - like Shonqie, Fanjai, Chobie and Gidewon - were brought together as a band to provide a unique experience. The place became a hangout for many musicians, who would get often on stage and jam. The success of piano bars in Asmara could also be connected with the Gaeda genre, which is played in Swa houses in Aba Shawel, a district of Asmara that has traditionally been home to many notable artists across generations. Gaeda is a communal music experience where a singer plays songs accompanied by friends beating drums, clapping and singing along. Many of these songs are exclusively played in Gaeda settings and are never recorded or released on albums. Songs are often modified by whoever sings them, adding thought-provoking social and political messages. Sibrit In 1994, a year after Eritrea declared its independence and gained international recognition, a group of musicians were brought together under the direction of Kahsay Gebrehewet as part of Eritrea‚Äôs nation building efforts. The musicians, who had previously performed in various revolutionary music groups, were brought together as the national music and dance troupe, Sibrit, which means \\"heritage\\". Sibrit perform music and dance from all nine of Eritrea's main ethnic groups (Afar, Bilen, Hedareb, Saho, Kunama, Nara, Rashaida, Tigre and Tigrinya), they feature regularly on Eritrean radio and television shows and perform as representatives of Eritrean culture around the world. Their instrumentation includes the amplified krar, bass krar and percussion.

Early years Juan Antonio Corretjer monument Juan Antonio Corretjer monument Corretjer (birth name: Juan Antonio Corretjer Montes) was born in Ciales, Puerto Rico, into a politically active pro- independence family. His parents were Diego Corretjer Hern√°ndez and Mar√≠a Br√≠gida Montes Gonz√°lez. His father and uncles were involved in the \\"Ciales Uprising\\" of August 13, 1898, against the United States occupation. As a lad, he would often accompany his father and uncles to political rallies. He received his primary and secondary education in his hometown. In 1920, when he was only 12 years old, Corretjer wrote his first poem \\"Canto a Ciales\\" (I sing to Ciales). In 1924, Corretjer published his first booklet of poems.PRCC Corretjer joined the \\"Literary Society of Jos√© Gautier Ben√≠tez\\", which later would be renamed the \\"Nationalist Youth\\", while he was still in elementary school. When he was in 8th grade, he organized a student protest against the United States in his town. He was expelled from his local high school for organizing a strike to have it renamed for Jos√© de Diego. Corretjer was then sent to school in the town of Vega Baja. Nationalist youth In 1927, he moved to San Juan and worked as a journalist for the newspaper \\"La Democracia\\". He later moved to the city of Ponce where he published his first two books of poetry: \\"Ag√ºeyban√°\\" (1932) and \\"Ulises\\" (1933). Throughout his life, he wrote for various newspapers and publications in Puerto Rico, Cuba and the United States.Interview with Juan Antonio Corretjer - 1982 In 1935, Corretjer travelled to Cuba and joined an anti-Batista group whose aim was to overthrow the U.S.-backed Cuban dictator. He also traveled to Haiti and to the Dominican Republic looking for international support for Puerto Rico's independence movement. In 1935, four Nationalists were killed by the police under the command of Colonel E. Francis Riggs. The incident became known as the R√≠o Piedras massacre. The following year in 1936, two members of the Cadets of the Republic, the Nationalist youth organization, Hiram Rosado and El√≠as Beauchamp assassinated Colonel Riggs. They were arrested and executed, without a trial, at police headquarters in San Juan. In 1936, Corretjer met and became friends with the nationalist leader Pedro Albizu Campos. He was named Secretary General of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party . On April 3, 1936, a Federal Grand Jury submitted accusations against Pedro Albizu Campos, Juan Antonio Corretjer, Luis F. Vel√°zquez, Clemente Soto V√©lez and the following members of the Cadets of the Republic: Erasmo Vel√°zquez, Julio H. Vel√°zquez, Rafael Ortiz Pacheco, Juan Gallardo Santiago, and Pablo Rosado Ortiz. They were charged with sedition and other violations of Title 18 of the United States Code.FBI Files on Puerto Ricans Title 18 of the United States Code is the criminal and penal code of the federal government of the United States.

Cooper called for a new jury, this time composed of ten Americans and two Puerto Ricans, and a guilty verdict was reached.The Imprisonment of Men and Women Fighting Colonialism, 1930 - 1940 Retrieved December 9, 2009. Corretjer was sent to the infamous La Princesa prison for one year in 1937, because he refused to hand over to the American authorities the Book of Acts of the Nationalists Party, as result of his political beliefs.Biografia In 1937 a group of lawyers, including a young Gilberto Concepci√≥n de Gracia, tried in vain to defend the Nationalists, but the Boston Court of Appeals, which held appellate jurisdiction over federal matters in Puerto Rico, upheld the verdict. Albizu Campos and the other Nationalist leaders were sent to the Federal penitentiary in Atlanta, Georgia. Puerto Rico's Gag Law On May 21, 1948, a bill was introduced before the Puerto Rican Senate which would restrain the rights of the independence and Nationalist movements on the archipelago. The Senate, controlled by the Partido Popular Democr√°tico (PPD) and presided by Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n, approved the bill that day.\\"La obra jur√≠dica del Profesor David M. Helfeld (1948-2008)'; by: Dr. Carmelo Delgado Cintr√≥n This bill, which resembled the anti-communist Smith Act passed in the United States in 1940, became known as the Ley de la Mordaza (Gag Law) when the U.S.-appointed governor of Puerto Rico, Jes√∫s T. Pi√±ero, signed it into law on June 10, 1948. Under this new law it would be a crime to print, publish, sell, or exhibit any material intended to paralyze or destroy the insular government; or to organize any society, group or assembly of people with a similar destructive intent. It made it illegal to sing a patriotic song, and reinforced the 1898 law that had made it illegal to display the Flag of Puerto Rico, with anyone found guilty of disobeying the law in any way being subject to a sentence of up to ten years imprisonment, a fine of up to US$10,000 (), or both. According to Leopoldo Figueroa, a member of the Puerto Rico House of Representatives, the law was repressive and was in violation of the First Amendment of the US Constitution which guarantees Freedom of Speech. He pointed out that the law as such was a violation of the civil rights of the people of Puerto Rico.La Gobernaci√≥n de Jes√∫s T. Pi√±ero y la Guerra Fr√≠a Nationalist Party Revolts of the 1950s On October 30, 1950, the Nationalists staged uprisings in the towns of Ponce, Mayag√ºez, Naranjito, Arecibo, Utuado (Utuado Uprising), San Juan (San Juan Nationalist revolt), and Jayuya (Jayuya Uprising). Known as the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party Revolts of the 1950s, the revolts were a widespread call for independence by the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party, against United States Government rule over Puerto Rico. It specifically repudiated the so-called \\"Free Associated State\\" (Estado Libre Asociado) designation of Puerto Rico - a designation widely recognized as a colonial farce. The revolts failed because of the overwhelming force used by the U.S. military, the U.S. National Guard, the FBI, the CIA, and the Puerto Rican Insular Police - all of whom were aligned against the Nationalists. This force included the machine-gunning of Nationalists all over the island, and the aerial bombing of the town of Jayuya. Hundreds of Cadets and Nationalists, among them Corretjer, were arrested by mid-November 1950, and the party was never the same.\\"Discrimination for Political Beliefs and Associations\\"; Helfeld, D. M.; Revista del Colegio de Abogados de Puerto Rico; volumen = 25 Poetry and essays =Literary style and themes= The themes and inspiration for his poems and essays were devoted to his defense of his native land. Corretjer's epic poem \\"Alabanza en la Torre de Ciales\\" (Praise in the tower of Ciales) (1953), is considered one of the representative works of the \\"neocriollismo\\" movement and has had a strong influence on many later poets. In Corretjer's poetry the Taino is no longer an idealized figure but allegory of revolutionary legacy. In the prologue of \\"Yerba bruja\\", Corretjer states it was not his intent to \\"dig up a mummy\\" but to bring to light \\"the splendor of the indigenous imagination that lives on in our own.\\" His poetry spans several decades and transcended any particular literary movement.

Early life Harilal was born on 23 August 1888, just before his father left for England for higher studies. Harilal remained in India with his mother. Harilal was involved in the Indian independence movement, and was imprisoned as a satyagrahi six times between 1908 and 1911. His willingness to endure these sentences earned him the nickname of 'Chhote (Little) Gandhi'. He too wanted to go to England for higher studies, hoping to become a barrister as his father had once been. His father however firmly opposed this, believing that a Western-style education would not be helpful in the struggle against British rule over India, leading to tensions between father and son. Eventually rebelling against his father's decision, in 1911 Harilal renounced all family ties. In 1906 he married Gulab Gandhi, with whom he had had five children: two daughters, Rani and Manu; and three sons, Kantilal, Rasiklal and Shantilal. Rasiklal and Shantilal died at an early age. He had four grandchildren (Anushrya, Prabodh, Neelam Solanki, and Navmalika) via Rani, two (Shanti and Pradeep) via Kantilal, and one (Urmi) via Manu. After Gulab died during the 1918 influenza pandemic, Harilal became detached from his children. He contemplated marrying his wife's sister Kumi Adalaja, who was a child widow, however this did not materialize. This led to Harilal's further descent and he gradually began to slip and became an alcoholic. He stayed in touch with his father sporadically through the years, sometimes through commonly known people, right up to 1947. Harilal appeared at his father's funeral in such a derelict condition that few recognized him. Neelam Parikh, the daughter of Ranibehn, the eldest of Harilal's children, wrote a biography of him subsequently, entitled Gandhiji's Lost Jewel: Harilal Gandhi. Religious conversions In May 1936, at the age of 48, Harilal publicly converted to Islam and named himself Abdulla Gandhi.Gandhi, Rajmohan (2006), pp374 However later in 1936, on his mother Kasturba Gandhi's request he converted back to Hinduism through the Arya Samaj and adopted a new name, Hiralal.Gandhi, Rajmohan (2006) p 376 Gandhi's letters In June 1935, Mahatma Gandhi wrote a letter http://www.tribuneindia.com/2014/20140512/main8.htm to Harilal, accusing him of \\"alcohol and debauchery\\". In the letters, Mahatma Gandhi stated that Harilal's problems were more difficult for him to deal with than the struggle for an Indian republic. In 2014 three letters written by Mahatma Gandhi to Harilal in 1935 were offered for auction. A translation of one of the letters (which was written in Gujarati) suggest that Gandhi was accusing Harilal of raping either his own daughter, Manu, or his sister-in-law. Tushar Gandhi (Mahatma Gandhi's great-grandson) has suggested that the letter was poorly translated, and that the word being translated as rape may not have actually meant sexual assault. Death Harilal died of tuberculosis four months after Gandhi‚Äôs death, on the night of 18 June 1948, aged 59. He died at a municipal hospital (now the Sewri TB Hospital) in Mumbai. His death certificate is preserved at the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation‚Äôs archives in Vakola. Harilal‚Äôs death certificate reveals that he was admitted to the hospital after being found unconscious in Kamathipura. Harilal did not reveal to staff that he was Gandhi's son, and his family only found out about his hospitalisation after his death. Gandhi, My Father The troubled relationship between Harilal and his father is the subject of the film and play Gandhi, My Father.

Liberian music includes traditional Gbema music, as well as the popular genre Hipco. Gbema music or traditional music Liberian music makes particular use of vocal harmony, repetition and call-and-response song structure as well as such typical West African elements as ululation and the polyrhythm typical of rhythm in Sub-Saharan Africa. Christian music was introduced to Liberia by American missionaries and Christian songs are now sung in a style that mixes American harmonies with West African language, rhythm and the call-and-response format. Traditional music is performed at weddings, naming ceremonies, royal events and other special occasions, as well as ordinary children's songs, work songs and lullabies. Popular music Highlife music is very popular in Liberia, as elsewhere in West Africa. It is a combination of North American, West African and Latin American styles, and emerged in the 1950s in Ghana, Sierra Leone and Liberia, especially among the Liberian Kru people, who were sailors that played Spanish guitar, banjo, pennywhistle, harmonica, accordion, mandolin and concertina. Past and present musicians include Princess Hawa Daisy Moore, Fatu Gayflor, Nimba Burr, Tejajlu, Morris Dorley, Yatta Zoe, Anthony \\"Experience\\" Nagbe Gebah Swaray, Kandakai Duncan and Miatta Fahnbulleh. Of these, Dorley deserves special notice for having spearheaded a movement to create a national Liberian identity, alongside musicians such as Anthony \\"Experience\\" Nagbe. Dorley's popular songs include \\"Grand Gedeh County\\" and \\"Who Are You Baby\\". The country's most renowned radio station is ELBC, or the Liberian Broadcasting System. Rap and pop music are also performed in indigenous languages across the country. In 1963, President Tubman set up the new Cape-Palmas Military Band (CPMB). Israeli bandmaster Aharon Shefi formed and conducted a 56-piece concert and marching band that performed Liberian, American and universal folk and church music. The CPMB has performed on January 1, 1964, at President Tubman's inauguration in Monrovia. Among the pieces played were Highlife, original marches by the late Liberian composer Victor Bowya, the National Anthem and \\"The Lone Star Forever\\". The CPMB had also performed in churches, schools, holidays and military parades and official events. Hipco Liberia has a uniquely Liberian rap genre called Hipco, or \\"Co\\". The \\"co\\" in the genre is short for the Liberian dialect Kolokwa. Hipco is usually performed in Liberian English or the local vernacular. Hipco evolved in the 1980s and has always had a social and political bent.

The Church Hymnal Corporation, 1982, hymn number 493 Charles Wesley wrote over 6,000 hymns, many of which were subsequently reprinted, frequently with alterations, in hymnals, particularly those of Methodist churches. Charles Wesley was suffering a bout of pleurisy in May, 1738, while he and his brother were studying under the Moravian scholar Peter Boehler in London. At the time, Wesley was plagued by extreme doubts about his faith. Taken to bed with the sickness, on May 21 Wesley was attended by a group of Christians who offered him testimony and basic care, and he was deeply affected by this. He read from his Bible and found himself deeply affected by the words, and at peace with God. Shortly his strength began to return. He wrote of this experience in his journal, and counted it as a renewal of his faith; when his brother John had a similar experience on the May 24, the two men met and sang a hymn Charles had written in praise of his renewal. One year from the experience, Wesley was taken with the urge to write another hymn, this one in commemoration of his renewal of faith. This hymn took the form of an 18-stanza poem, beginning with the opening lines 'Glory to God, and praise, and love, / Be ever, ever given' and was published in 1740 and entitled 'For the anniversary day of one's conversion'. The seventh verse, which begins, 'O for a thousand tongues to sing', and which now is invariably the first verse of a shorter hymn, recalls B√∂hler's words, 'Had I a thousand tongues I would praise Him with them all'. The hymn was placed first in John Wesley's A Collection of Hymns for the People Called Methodists published in 1780. It appeared in every (Wesleyan) Methodist hymnal from that time until the publication of Hymns and Psalms in 1983. Current versions Today the hymn is often condensed into a smaller number (typically between six and eight) stanzas. The editors of The United Methodist Hymnal omitted the verse containing the words \\"dumb\\" and \\"lame\\", but later reverted to the original version. Original lyrics The original lyrics are:Rev. Charles S. Nutter, D.D., An Illustrated and Annotated Edition of the Hymnal of the Methodist Episcopal Church, New York, 1900. 1\\\\. Glory to God, and praise and love, Be ever, ever given; By saints below and saints above, The Church in earth and heaven. 2\\\\. On this glad day the glorious Sun Of righteousness arose, On my benighted soul he shone, And filled it with repose. 3\\\\. Sudden expired the legal strife; 'Twas then I ceased to grieve. My second, real, living life, I then began to live. 4\\\\. Then with my heart I first believed, Believed with faith divine; Power with the Holy Ghost received To call the Saviour mine. 5\\\\. I felt my Lord's atoning blood Close to my soul applied; Me, me he loved - the Son of God For me, for me he died! 6\\\\. I found and owned his promise true, Ascertained of my part, My pardon passed in heaven I know, When written on my heart. 7\\\\. O For a thousand tongues to sing My dear Redeemer's praise! The glories of my God and King, The triumphs of His grace! 8\\\\. My gracious Master and my God, Assist me to proclaim, To spread through all the world abroad The honors of Thy name. 9\\\\. Jesus! the Name that charms our fears, That bids our sorrows cease; 'Tis music in the sinner's ears, 'Tis life, and health, and peace. 10\\\\. He breaks the power of cancell'd sin, He sets the prisoner free; His blood can make the foulest clean, His blood avail'd for me. 11\\\\. He speaks, - and, listening to his voice, New life the dead receive; The mournful, broken hearts rejoice; The humble poor believe. 12\\\\. Hear him, ye deaf; his praise, ye dumb, Your loosen'd tongues employ; Ye blind, behold your Saviour come, And leap, ye lame, for joy. 13\\\\. Look unto him, ye nations; own Your God, ye fallen race; Look, and be saved through faith alone, Be justified by grace. 14\\\\. See all your sins on Jesus laid; The Lamb of God was slain; His soul was once an offering made For every soul of man. 15\\\\. Harlots, and publicans, and thieves, In holy triumph join! Saved is the sinner that believes, From crimes as great as mine. 16\\\\. Murderers, and all ye hellish crew, Ye sons of lust and pride, Believe the Savior died for you; For me the Saviour died. 17\\\\. Awake from guilty nature's sleep, And Christ shall give you light, Cast all your sins into the deep, And wash the AEthiop white. 18\\\\. With me, your chief, ye then shall know, Shall feel your sins forgiven; Anticipate your heaven below, And own that love is heaven. Tunes Lowell Mason In the U.S., the hymn is commonly sung to Lowell Mason‚Äôs 1839 arrangement of the hymn tune Azmon, written by Carl G. Glaser in 1828. Mason's arrangement was written as a setting for this hymn. In Great Britain the tune Lydia by Thomas Phillips or Richmond by Thomas Haweis are commonly used, though in larger congregations Thomas Jarman's tune \\"Lyngham\\" is favoured.

The abaya \\"cloak\\" (colloquially and more commonly, ', especially in Literary Arabic: '; plural ', '), sometimes also called an aba, is a simple, loose over-garment, essentially a robe-like dress, worn by some women in parts of the Muslim world including North East Africa, Somalia, Morocco, and the Arabian Peninsula. Traditional abayat are black and may be either a large square of fabric draped from the shoulders or head or a long kaftan. The abaya covers the whole body except the head, feet, and hands. It can be worn with the niqƒÅb, a face veil covering all but the eyes. Some women also wear long black gloves, so their hands are covered as well. It is common that the abayat is worn to special occasions, such as Mosque visits and Islamic Holiday celebrations for Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha. The Indonesian traditional dress kebaya gets its name from the abaya. Rationale The rationale for the abaya is often attributed to the Quranic quote, \\"O Prophet, tell your wives and daughters, and the believing women, to cover themselves with a loose garment. They will thus be recognised and no harm will come to them\\" (Qur'an 33:59, translated by Ahmed Ali). This quotation is often given as the argument for wearing the abaya. The abaya is most common in countries with large Muslim populations. Some denominations of Islam consider the entire female body, except for the face and hands, awrah ‚Äì that which should be concealed in public from males unrelated by blood or marriage. Countries Outside some Arab states such as Saudi Arabia, the abaya is not widely worn by Muslim women. It is rare in countries like Indonesia, India and Pakistan. Abaya also refers to different garments in different countries. In Arab states of the Persian Gulf, they tend to be black in color. =Saudi Arabia= In Saudi Arabia, women are required to cover in public.Sanders, Eli.

There are two subspecies; P. a. alchata breeds in southern Europe and P. a. caudacutus breeds in northwestern Africa, the Middle East and southeastern Asia. It is a partial migrant, with some Asian birds moving to the Middle East and northern Pakistan in winter. Males of the eastern race have duller underparts than the European birds, and the females have white, rather than yellow, wing coverts. Taxonomy There are two subspecies. The nominate race, P. a. alchata, breeds in Iberia and southern France, and the eastern form P. a. caudacutus (Gmelin, 1774) is found in northwest Africa, and from southeast Turkey east to Kazakhstan. The species name alchata is thought to be derived from Arabic al- gata which is derived from the call of the bird. Description The pin- tailed sandgrouse is a robust, medium-sized bird about in length. The general colouring is cryptic, a blend of barred and flecked olive green, brown, buff, yellow, grey and black. The underparts and the feathered legs are dull white. Pin-tailed sandgrouse The sexes are different and the male's plumage varies with the time of year. In the breeding season, the male has the crown, most of the neck, the back and under-wing coverts a yellowish-green colour with dull yellow spots in the shoulder region. The cheeks are also yellow with a narrow black line extending from the beak, through the eye to the nape of the neck. The irises are brown and the beak is slatey grey. There is a black patch on the throat immediately below the beak and below this, there is a broad, reddish-brown band round the breast, bordered by a thin black stripe above and below the band. The outer wing coverts are chestnut edged with black and white and the primaries are black with pale edges which gives both the leading and trailing edges of the wing the appearance of a black rim in flight. The rump and the tail are distinctly barred in black and brownish-yellow and the streamers on the central tail feathers are slate-grey. Outside the breeding season, all the upper parts, including the crown and cheeks, are barred in black and brownish-yellow and the throat loses its black patch, becoming whitish. The female is generally similar to the male but the colours are duller. The cheeks and neck are golden-buff and lack the greenish tinge of the male. There is a black stripe running through the eye. The chin is white and there is an additional yellow-buff band across the breast with a broad black stripe above, another thinner one about a third of the way down and a further narrow black stripe at the base. The back and wings are grey, barred with black. The rump and the tail (which has shorter central feathers than the male) are similar in colouration to the male but have finer black barrings. In flight, the pin-tailed sandgrouse can be identified by its bright, white underparts and under-wing coverts, and the long feathers in the centre part of its tail. It is usually silent when on the ground but in the air communicates with other birds with a frequently uttered, loud \\"kattar-kattar\\", a nasal \\"ga- ga-ga\\" and a low-pitched \\"gang gang\\". Distribution and habitat The pin- tailed sandgrouse breeds in North Africa and the Middle East, Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Kazakhstan. In Europe it breeds in Spain, Portugal and the southern part of France. Eastern populations, particularly those from Kazakhstan, migrate to Pakistan and parts of northern India in winter. The pin-tailed sandgrouse inhabits open areas of stony land, semi arid areas at the edge of deserts, treeless plains and occasionally dried-out mud flats. In winter it may visit ploughed or fallow land but prefers sandy soils and is much less reliant on vegetation cover than the black-bellied sandgrouse (Pterocles orientalis) which has a similar range. It does not occur at elevations above about . Behaviour The pin-tailed sandgrouse often feeds in groups and gathers regularly in large numbers at waterholes, to which the birds fly soon after dawn. During the day they disperse to forage for seeds, which are the main part of their diet, and also eat buds, green shoots and leaves. They favour leguminous seeds and also eat seeds of knotweed (Polygonum), buckwheat (Fagopyrum), Salicornia, Artemisia, camelthorn (Alhagi), rock rose (Helianthemum) and asphodel (Asphodelus). In cultivated areas they take grain and the seeds of leguminous crops. Beetles and other small invertebrates are sometimes eaten and grit is consumed to help grind up the contents of the crop. Breeding Egg The pin-tailed sandgrouse nests in a slight depression on the ground in the open. Two or three eggs are laid at intervals of two days, creamy-brown spotted with darker brown, reddish-brown and grey. Both parents share the task of incubation which lasts from nineteen to twenty five days. The male starts his shift about an hour before sunset and the female takes over after she has been to the waterhole in the morning. The young are precocial and leave the nest soon after they have hatched. Both parents care for them but only the male is involved in bringing them water, absorbed by the feathers on his breast. The chicks are able to feed themselves by the age of a week and can fly by the time they are four weeks old. They are dependent on their parents for two months and attain their adult plumage at about four months. There is normally a single brood each year but if the eggs are destroyed or removed, more eggs may be laid. Status The pin-tailed sandgrouse is rated as being of \\"Least Concern\\" by BirdLife International. This is because it has a large range and the population, estimated to be somewhere between 130,000 and 1,500,000 individuals, is believed to be stable. The range may be expanding in south eastern Turkey, possibly as a result of changes in climate. However, the populations in parts of Europe are decreasing due to changes in agricultural production. The bird remains common in Spain but in the only remaining locality in southern France where it is found, at La Crau, only about 170 pairs remained in 2002, while there were fewer than 100 pairs of birds breeding in Portugal in the same year.

History The Academy was founded at the Palazzo Capranica in 1666 by Louis XIV under the direction of Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Charles Le Brun and Gian Lorenzo Bernini. The Academy was from the 17th to 19th centuries the culmination of study for select French artists who, having won the prestigious Prix de Rome (Rome Prize), were honored with a 3, 4 or 5-year scholarship (depending on the art discipline they followed) in the Eternal City for the purpose of the study of art and architecture. Such scholars were and are known as pensionnaires de l'Acad√©mie (Academy pensioners). One recipient of the scholarship in the 17th century was Pierre Le Gros the Younger. The Academy was housed in the Palazzo Capranica until 1737, and then in the Palazzo Mancini from 1737 to 1793. In 1803 Napoleon Bonaparte moved it to the Villa Medici, with the intention of perpetuating an institution once threatened by the French Revolution and, thus, of retaining for young French artists the opportunity to see and copy the masterpieces of the Antiquity or the Renaissance and send back to Paris their \\"envois de Rome\\", the results of the inspiration they had gained in Rome. These \\"envois\\" were annual works, sent to Paris to be judged, and were a compulsory requirement for all the pensionaries. Portrait of Prix de Rome winner and fellow student Merry-Joseph Blondel in front of the Villa Medici in 1809, by Ingres At first, the villa and its gardens were in a sad state and had to be renovated to house the winners of the Prix de Rome. The competition was interrupted during the first World War, and Mussolini confiscated the villa in 1941, forcing the academy of France in Rome to withdraw to Nice then to Fontainebleau until 1945. The competition and Prix de Rome were eliminated in 1968 by Andr√© Malraux (the last Grand Prix for architecture came to an end as early as 1967, the events of 1968 preventing its continuation).Malraux had already once envisioned, unsuccessfully, the suppression of the Prix de Rome competition in 1962. The Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts in Paris and the Institut de France then lost their guardianship of the Villa Medici to the Ministry of the Culture and the State.The Institut de France reacted against this as early as 1975, while organizing each year the competition for the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts's Grand Prix of Architecture that still exists today. From that time on, the boarders no longer belonged solely to the traditional disciplines (painting, sculpture, architecture, medal-engraving, precious-stone engraving, musical composition) but also to new or previously neglected artistic fields (art history, archaeology, literature, stagecraft, photography, movies, video, restoration, writing and even cookery). These artists-in-residence are known as pensionnaires. The French word ‚Äòpension‚Äô refers to the room & board these, generally young and promising, artists receive. The artists are no longer recruited by a competition but by application, and their stays vary from six to eighteen months and even, more rarely, two years. Between 1961 and 1967, the artist Balthus, then at the head of the Academy, carried out a vast restoration campaign of the palace and its gardens, providing them with modern equipment. Balthus participated \\"hands on\\" in all the phases of the construction. Where the historic d√©cor had disappeared, Balthus proposed personal alternatives. He invented a d√©cor that was a homage to the past and, at the same time, radically contemporary: The mysterious melancholic decor he created for Villa Medici has become, in turn, historic and was undergoing an important restoration campaign in 2016. Work continued under the direction of director, Richard Peduzzi, and the Villa Medici resumed organizing exhibitions and shows created by its artists in residence. Under director Fr√©d√©ric Mitterrand the Academy opened up its guest rooms to the general public at times when they are not used by pensionnaires or other official guests.

They are often served with oyster stew. They have similar ingredients to saltine crackers.  In cuisine Oyster crackers are popular in the northeastern United States, where they are served as an accompaniment to soup, and in the Cincinnati area, where they are frequently served with the city's distinctive chili. In New England, oyster crackers are served in oyster stew and chowders. Additionally, plain oyster crackers are sometimes seasoned with spices. They usually have a taste similar to saltine crackers, but far less salty. In other areas of the United States, they are among the choices for crackers with soup. They are often available in single serving packages for restaurant use. Many different companies produce oyster crackers with different combinations of shortenings and other ingredients, but retaining the same general shape and size.  Etymology  The origin of the term \\"oyster cracker\\" is unclear, but it may be that they were originally served with oyster stew or clam chowder or merely that they look like an oyster in its shell. Other names include \\"water cracker,\\" \\"Philadelphia cracker,\\" and \\"Trenton cracker\\".

However, a counterclaim is that Adam Exton is credited with inventing the oyster cracker. Adam Exton, a baker in Trenton, New Jersey, emigrated to America from Lancashire, England, in 1842. In Trenton, Exton opened a cake and cracker bakery with his brother-in-law, Richard Aspden, in 1846. Although Aspden died the following year, Exton continued with the bakery (the \\"Exton Cracker Bakery\\" or \\"Adam Exton & Co.\\"). He invented a machine that rolled and docked pastry and solved the sanitary problems of hand-rolling crackers. The history of the oyster cracker was related by Exton's nephew, also named Adam Exton, in the Trenton Evening Times newspaper on May 31, 1917:  See also  * List of crackers * Saltine cracker * Cuisine of Philadelphia  References  Crackers (food) Vermont cuisine 1828 introductions ","title":"Oyster cracker"},{"id":"990197","text":"SN2 reaction of a bromide ion with chloroethane showing the concerted nature of the reaction, the transition state and the predictable stereochemistry through Walden inversion.

Advanced Organic Chemistry Part A Structure and Mechanisms (2nd ed.). New York N.Y.: Plenum Press. . Concerted reaction rates tend not to depend on solvent polarity ruling out large buildup of charge in the transition state. The reaction is said to progress through a concerted mechanism as all bonds are formed and broken in concert. Pericyclic reactions, the SN2 reaction, and some rearrangements - such as the Claisen rearrangement - are concerted reactions. The rate of the SN2 reaction is second order overall due to the reaction being bimolecular (i.e. there are two molecular species involved in the rate- determining step). The reaction does not have any intermediate steps, only a transition state. This means that all the bond making and bond breaking takes place in a single step. In order for the reaction to occur both molecules must be situated correctly.

It consisted of a narrow slip of territory lying along the western side of the Bay of Bengal from 15¬∞ 40‚Ä≤ to 20¬∞ 17‚Ä≤ north latitude, in the present-day Indian states of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha. The annexation by the British of the Northern Circars deprived Hyderabad State, the Nizam's dominion, of the considerable coastline it formerly had, assuming the shape it is now remembered for: that of a landlocked princely state with territories in Central Deccan, bounded on all sides by British India.P. N. Chopra, B.N. Puri & M.N. Das, A Comprehensive History of India, Volume 3. pg. 298  Etymology  Circar was an English spelling of sarkar, a Mughal term for district (a subdivision of a subah or province), which has been in use since the time of Sher Shah Suri. \\"Northern Circars\\" meant the northern districts of the Nizam's dominion. Eventually \\"Circar\\" also acquired the meaning of \\"British Sarkar\\", i.e., the British government. Hence, \\"Sarkar districts\\" could also be understood as the districts under the administration of the British government. Geography The Northern Circars were five in number: Chicacole (Srikakulam), Rajahmundry, Ellore, Kondapalli and Guntur with a total area was about when Nizam initially lost their control to the Europeans.Great Britain India Office. The Imperial Gazetteer of India. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1908. In the main, the region at various points of time corresponds to the northern and the central parts of Coastal Andhra region of Andhra Pradesh, including whole of the present-day districts of Guntur, Krishna, East Godavari, West Godavari, Visakhapatnam, Vijayanagaram and Srikakulam of Andhra Pradesh. It also included a part of the present day Prakasam district of Andhra Pradesh, parts of as Ganjam, Gajapati, Rayagada, Koraput, Nabarangapur and Malkangiri districts of Odisha and a few parts of Mulugu district (previously in Jayashankar Bhupalapalli) and Bhadradri Kothagudem district of Telangana. History The Northern Circars in 1909 The region was invaded by the Bahmani Sultanate in 1471; in 1541 they conquered Kondapalli, and nine years later they extended their conquests over all Guntur and the districts of Masulipatam. The sultans appear to have acquired only an imperfect possession of the country, as it was again wrested from the Hindu princes of Odisha about the year 1571, during the reign of Ibrahim, of the Qutb Shahi dynasty of Golconda and Hyderabad. In 1687 the Circars were added, along with the Golconda Sultanate, to the extensive empire of Aurangzeb. In 1724, Mir Qamar- ud-din Khan was appointed as governor of Hyderabad, with the title Nizam al Mulk. He came to be known as the Nizam of Hyderabad, its de facto ruler. The fourth Nizam Salabat Jang, a son of the Nizam al Mulk, who was indebted for his elevation to the throne to the French East India Company, granted the district of Kondavid (Guntur) to the French in return for their services, and soon afterwards the other circars as well. In 1759, by the conquest of the fortress of Masulipatnam, along with the dominion of the maritime provinces from the river Gundlakamma River to the Chilka Lake, was necessarily transferred from the French to the British. But the British left them under the administration of the Nizam, with the exception of Masulipatnam, which was retained by the British. In 1765 Lord Robert Clive obtained from the Mughal emperor Shah Alam II a grant of the five Circars. Hereupon the fort of Kondapalli was seized by the British, and on 12 November 1766 a treaty of alliance was signed with Nizam Ali Khan by which the Company, in return for the grant of the Circars, undertook to maintain troops for the Nizam's assistance. By a second treaty, signed on 1 March 1768, the Nizam acknowledged the validity of Shah Alam's grant and resigned the Circars to the Company, receiving as a mark of friendship an annuity of ¬£50,000. Guntur, as the personal estate of the Nizam's brother Basalat Jang, was excepted during his lifetime under both the treaties. He died in 1782, but it was not till 1788 that Guntur came under British administration. Finally, in 1823, the claims of the Nizam over the Northern Circars were bought outright by the Company, and they became a British possession.The History of Vizag The Northern Circars were governed as part of Madras Presidency until India's independence in 1947, after which the presidency became India's Madras State. The northern, Telugu- speaking portion of Madras state, including the Northern Circars, was detached in 1953 to form a new 'Andhra State'. The Andhra State was merged with the Telugu speaking parts of Hyderabad State in 1956 to form a united Andhra Pradesh. The two were bifurcated again in 2014.

Specialised forms of guestbooks include hotel registers, wherein guests are required to provide their contact information, and Books of Condolence, which are used at funeral homes and more generally after notable public deaths, such as the death of a monarch or president, or after a public disaster, such as an airplane crash. A guestbook from the Salant Hotel, held by the National Library of Israel On the web, a guestbook is a logging system that allows visitors of a website to leave a public comment. It is possible in some guestbooks for visitors to express their thoughts about the website or its subject. Generally, they do not require the poster to create a user account, as it is an informal method of dropping off a quick message. The purpose of a website guestbook is to display the kind of visitors the site gets, including the part of the world they reside in, and gain feedback from them. This allows the webmaster to assess and improve their site. A guestbook is generally a script, which is usually remotely hosted and written in a language such as Perl, PHP, Python or ASP. Many free guestbook hosts and scripts exist. Names and addresses provided in guestbooks, paper- based or electronic, are frequently recorded and collated for use in providing statistics about visitors to the site, and to contact visitors to the site in the future. Because guestbooks are considered ephemeral objects, historians, literary scholars and other academic researchers have been increasingly eager to identify and help conserve them.

The two groups united to form the Black Gangster Disciple Nation (BGDN). In Chicago, the Gangster Disciples have a long and bitter rivalry with the Black Disciples. Since their creation, the Gangster Disciples have expanded nationwide. History On July 3, 2005, members of Gangster Disciples street gang killed Sergeant Juwan Johnson of the U.S. Army in the small town of Hohenecken near Ramstein, Germany. Prosecutors accused U.S. Air Force Senior Airman Rico Williams of being the first one to start attacking Johnson in a six-minute beating that he had to endure to join the gang. After the beating Johnson asked one of his fellow gang members to take him to the hospital, Williams then ordered his gang members not to take him there. Johnson later died from multiple blunt- force trauma injuries. According to the government's investigations, Williams was the leader of the gang set operating on base. Senior Airman Williams was sentenced to 22 years in prison, while other servicemen faced sentences ranging from 2 to 12 years. Some of the charges against the servicemen were: Williams, second-degree murder and witness tampering; Air Force Staff Sergeant Jerome Jones, conspiracy to commit assault, gang participation, and other charges; Airman Nicholas Sims and Army Sergeant Rodney Howell; involuntary manslaughter; Private Terrance Norman, voluntary manslaughter. On April 27, 2016, 32 members of Gangster Disciples were arrested on RICO charges by federal agents. Among the 32 arrested was a former Atlanta-area police officer who prosecutors say was a hit man for the gang. The indictment alleges that Gangster Disciples members committed 10 murders, 12 attempted murders, 2 robberies, the extortion of rap artists to force the artists to become affiliated with the Gangster Disciples, and fraud resulting in losses of over $450,000. In addition, the Gangster Disciples trafficked in large amounts of heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine, illegal prescription drugs, and marijuana. The indictment also seek forfeiture of 34 different firearms seized as part of the investigation. On July 21, 2020, a car pulled up at a funeral home in Englewood, Chicago and at least two gunmen inside opened fire. 15 people were wounded, with no reported fatalities. The funeral was for a victim killed a week prior, and was allegedly involving a dispute between two Gangster Disciples factions.

She was a founder of the Napa Valley Wine Library. Over her lifetime she wrote 27 books, including a translation of The Physiology of Taste by Brillat-Savarin. Fisher believed that eating well was just one of the \\"arts of life\\" and explored this in her writing. W. H. Auden once remarked, \\"I do not know of anyone in the United States who writes better prose.\\"Lazar, David Conversations with M. F. K. Fisher at 22 (University of Mississippi Press 1992) Early life Fisher was born Mary Frances Kennedy on July 3, 1908, at 202 Irwin Avenue, Albion, Michigan. She told Albion City Historian Frank Passic: Rex was a co-owner (with his brother Walter) and editor of the Albion Evening Recorder newspaper.. In 1911, Rex sold his interest in the paper to his brother, and moved the family to the West Coast, where he hoped to buy a fruit or citrus orchard. The family spent some time in Washington with relatives, and then traveled down the coast to Ventura, California, where Rex nearly purchased an orange grove, but backed out after discovering soil problems. He next purchased and briefly owned the Oxnard Courier in Oxnard, California.Poet, supra at 8. From there he traveled to San Diego and worked for a local newspaper. In 1912 he purchased a controlling interest in the Whittier News and moved the family to Whittier, California. Rex initially purchased a house at 115 Painter Avenue.Poet, supra, 15. In 1919, he purchased a large white house outside the city limits on South Painter Avenue.Poet, supra at 20. The house sat on thirteen acres, with an orange grove; it was referred to by the family as \\"The Ranch.\\"Poet, supra at 20. The home has since been torn down and a municipal park named \\"Kennedy Park\\" now occupies the site. Although Whittier was primarily a Quaker community at that time, Mary Frances was brought up within the Episcopal Church. Mary received a formal education; however, she was an indifferent student who often skipped classes throughout her academic career.Zimmerman, Anne, An Extravagant Hunger: The Passionate Years of M. F. K. Fisher (hereafter Passionate Years) at 31‚Äì42 (Counterpoint 2011). At the age of sixteen, her parents enrolled her in a private school: The Bishop's School in La Jolla, California.Passionate Years, supra at 32. After one year there, she transferred to the Harker School for Girls in Palo Alto, California, adjacent to Stanford University; she graduated from Harker in 1927.Passionate Years, supra at 35. Upon graduation, she attended Illinois College, but left after only one semester,Passionate Years, supra at 36‚Äì39. In 1928, she enrolled in summer school at UCLA in order to obtain enough credits to transfer to Occidental College.Passionate Years, supra at 39. While there, she met and fell in love with her future first husband: Alfred Fisher (\\"Al\\"). She attended Occidental College for one year; however, she married Al on September 5, 1929, and moved with him to Dijon, France.Passionate Years, supra at 41‚Äì42. Mary's informal education undoubtedly had a far greater impact on her writing career than her formal education. She loved reading as a child, and began writing poetry at the age of five.Passionate Years, supra at 30. The Kennedys had a vast home library,Passionate Years, supra at 16. and her mother provided her access to many other books.Passionate Years, supra at 31. Later, her father used her as stringer on his paper, and she would draft as many as fifteen stories a day. Food became an early passion in her life. Her earliest memory of taste was \\"the grayish-pink fuzz my grandmother skimmed from a spitting kettle of strawberry jam\\".Passionate Years, supra at 9. Her maternal grandmother Holbrook lived with them until her death in 1920. During that period, Holbrook was a source of tension in the household. She was a stern, rather joyless person, and a Campbellite who firmly believed in overcooked, bland food. She was also a follower of Dr. John Harvey Kellogg's dietary restrictions at the Battle Creek Sanitarium. Fisher would later write that during her grandmother's absences at religious conventions: An early food influence was \\"Aunt\\" Gwen. Aunt Gwen was not family, but the daughter of friends ‚Äî the Nettleship family ‚Äî \\"a strange family of English medical missionaries who preferred tents to houses.\\"Begin Again, supra at 24. The Nettleships had an encampment on Laguna Beach, and Mary would camp out there with Gwen. Rex would later buy the campsite and a cabin that had been built on it.Begin Again, 25. Mary recalled cooking outdoors with Gwen: steaming mussels on fresh seaweed over hot coals; catching and frying rock bass; skinning and cooking eel; and, making fried egg sandwiches to carry on hikes.Begin Again, 26‚Äì29. Mary wrote of her meals with Gwen and Gwen's brothers: \\"I decided at the age of nine that one of the best ways to grow up is to eat and talk quietly with good people.\\"Reardon, Joan 2008 M. F. K. Fisher among the Pots and Pans, 15, University of California Press, . Mary liked to cook meals in the kitchen at home, and \\"easily fell into the role of the cook's helper.\\"Begin Again, 29. Dijon: 1928‚Äì1932 In September 1929, newlyweds Mary and Al sailed on the RMS Berengaria to Cherbourg (now Cherbourg-Octeville), France.Passion, supra at 1. They traveled to Paris for a brief stay, before continuing south to Dijon.Dijon is a well-known culinary center and would greatly expand Mary's food world. Her three years in Dijon are recounted in her 1991 book Long Ago in France. They initially found a rental at 14 Rue du Petit-Potet in a home owned by the Ollangnier family.Extravagant Hunger, supra at 54. The lodgings consisted of two rooms, with no kitchen, and no separate bathroom.Passionate Years, supra at 54. Al attended the Facult√© des Lettres at the University of Burgundy where he was working on his doctorate; when not in class, he worked on what he believed to be his epic poem, The Ghosts in the Underblows.Fisher, M F K, Long Ago in France: The Years in Dijon (hereafter Long Ago) at (Prentiss Hall 1991). The poem was based on the Bible and was analogous to James Joyce's Ulysses.Starr, Kevin Material Dreams (hereafter Material Dreams) at 376 (Oxford University Press 1990) . By 1931, Fisher had finished the first twelve books of the poem, which he ultimately expected to contain sixty books.Material Dreams, supra at 376. A long fragment of the poem was finally published in 1940. Despite some critical accolades, the book was a failure. However, the book's innovative graphics by Lustig are still widely admired and the book is a collector's item for that reason. Id. at 379. Mary attended night classes at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts where she spent three years studying painting and sculpture.Long Ago, supra at 65. The Ollangniers served good food at home, although Madame Ollangnier was \\"extremely penurious and stingy.\\"Long Ago, supra at 12. Mary remembered big salads made at the table, deep-fried Jerusalem artichokes, and \\"reject cheese\\" that was always good.Long Ago, supra at 14. To celebrate their three-month anniversary, Al and Mary went to the Aux Trois Faisans restaurant ‚Äî their first of many visits.Long Ago, supra at 29‚Äì30. There, Mary received her education in fine wine from a sommelier named Charles.Long Ago, supra at 33. The Fishers visited all the restaurants in town, where in Mary's words: In 1930, Lawrence Clark Powell came to Dijon to obtain his doctorate at the University of Burgundy.Material Dreams, supra at 377. He came at Mary's suggestion. Powell had become acquainted with Mary when Mary's sister was attending Occidental College, and roomed with Powell's girlfriend. Powell moved into the attic above the Fishers and became lifelong friends with Mary. He described the food at the Fishers' pensione: In Mary and Al moved to their own apartment, above a pastry shop at 26 Rue Monge.Material Dreams, supra at 378. It was Mary's first kitchen. It was only five feet by three feet and contained a two-burner hotplate.Pots and Pans, supra at 46. Despite the kitchen's limitations, or perhaps because of it, Mary began developing her own personal cuisine, with the goal of \\"cooking meals that would 'shake [her guests] from their routines, not only of meat-potatoes- gravy, but of thought, of behavior.'\\"Pots and Pans, supra at 47‚Äì49. In The Gastronomical Me she describes one such meal: After Al was awarded his doctorate, they moved briefly to Strasbourg, France, where Al continued to study and write.Poet, supra at 64. Mary became depressed from loneliness and being cooped up in a cold, dank apartment.Poet, supra at 66. Unable to afford better accommodations, the Fishers next moved to a tiny French fishing village, Cros-des-Cagnes. Powell visited with them there for six weeks and observed that Al was growing more introspective. He had stopped work on his poem, was trying to write novels and did not want to return to the States where he knew job prospects were poor. He could not, however, see a way to stay in France.Looking Back, supra at 112. After running out of funds, the Fishers returned to California, sailing on the Feltre out of Marseilles.Poet, supra at 68. California: 1932‚Äì1938 Back in California, Al and Mary initially moved in with Mary's family at \\"The Ranch\\".Poet, supra at 71. They later moved into the Laguna cabin. This was during the Great Depression and work was hard to find. Al spent two years looking for a teaching position until he found one at Occidental College.Fisher, M F K. Stay Me, Oh Comfort Me (hereafter Stay Me) at ix (Pantheon 1993). Mary began writing and she published her first piece ‚Äî \\"Pacific Village\\" ‚Äî in the February 1935 issue of Westways magazine (previously known as Touring Topics). The article was a fictional account of life in Laguna Beach.Material Dreams, supra 380 In 1934, Lawrence Powell moved to Laguna with his wife Fay.Stay Me, supra at ix. In 1933, Dillwyn Parrish and his wife Gigi moved next door to them, and they rapidly became friends.Passionate Years, supra at 116; and Pots and Pans, supra at 52. When Al began teaching at Occidental, the Fishers initially moved to Eagle Rock, Los Angeles, where the Parrishes helped them paint and fix up an older house they had rented.Pots and Pans, supra at 52. Unfortunately the home was sold shortly thereafter, and the Fishers had to move to another rented house in Highland Park.Poet, supra at 82‚Äì83. Mary worked part-time in a card shop and researched old cookery books at the Los Angeles Public Library. She began writing short pieces on gastronomy. Parrish's sister Anne showed them to her publisher at Harpers who expressed an interest in them.Pots and Pans, supra at 53. The pieces were later to become her first book: Serve It Forth. Mary next began work on a novel she never finished; it was based on the founding of Whittier.Poet, supra at 86. During this period, Mary's marriage with Al was beginning to fail. After Parrish divorced Gigi in 1934, Mary found herself falling in love with him. In Mary's words, she one day sat next to Parrish at the piano and told him she loved him.Poet, supra at 84. Mary's biographer Joan Reardon, however, interviewed Gigi who told a different story. She stated that Parrish told her that one night after he had dined alone with Mary, she later let herself into his house and slipped into bed with him.Poet, supra at 84 and 84 n.39. In 1935, with Al's permission, Mary traveled to Europe with Parrish and his mother.Material Dreams, supra at 380. The Parrishes had money, and they sailed on the luxury liner Hansa. While in Europe, they spent four days in Paris, and traveled through Provence, Languedoc, and the French Riviera.Poet, supra at 87‚Äì89. Mary also revisited Dijon and ate with Parrish at Aux Trois Faisans where she was recognized and served by her old friend, the waiter Charles.Pots and Pans, supra at 54. She later wrote a piece on their visit ‚Äî \\"The Standing and the Waiting\\" ‚Äî which was to become the centerpiece of Serve It Forth. Upon her return from Europe, Mary informed Al of her developing relationship with Parrish. In 1936, Dillwyn invited the Fishers to join him in creating an artists' colony at Le Paquis ‚Äî a two-story stone house that Parrish had bought with his sister north of Vevey, Switzerland.Pots and Pans, supra at 55. Notwithstanding the clear threat to his marriage, Al agreed. Vevey: 1936‚Äì1939 View from Chexbres toward Vevey The Fishers sailed to Holland on a small Dutch passenger freighter, and from there took a train to Vevey.Poet, supra at 96‚Äì97. \\"Le Paquis\\" means the grazing ground. The house sat on a sloping meadow on the north shore of Lake Geneva, looking across to the snowcapped Alps. They had a large garden in which In mid-1937 Al and Mary separated. He traveled to Austria and then returned to the States where he began a distinguished career as a teacher and poet at Smith College.Poet, supra at 103 and 108. In a February 2, 1937, letter to Powell, Mary explained her side of the marital breakup. She stated that Al was afraid of physical love; he was sexually impotent in their marriage. Moreover, he was an intellectual loner who was emotionally estranged from Mary. Mary stated that contrary to Al's belief, she had not left him for another man; she had left him because he could not satisfy her emotional and physical needs.Fisher, M F K A Life in Letters at 40‚Äì43 (Counterpoint 1997). In 1938, Mary returned home briefly to inform her parents in person of her separation and pending divorce from Al.Poet, supra at 109‚Äì10. Meanwhile, her first book, Serve It Forth, had opened to largely glowing reviews, including reviews in Harper's Monthly, The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune. Mary, however, was disappointed in the book's meager sales because she needed the money.Poet, supra at 103‚Äì04. During this same period, Mary and Parrish also co-wrote (alternating chapters) a light romance entitled Touch and Go under the pseudonym Victoria Berne. The book was published by Harper and Brothers in 1939.Poet, supra at 112‚Äì13.\\"Touch and go\\". Library of Congress Catalog Record. Retrieved 2013-10-17. In September 1938, Mary and Parrish could no longer afford to live at Les Paquis and they moved to Bern.Poet, supra at 115. After only two days in Bern, however, Parrish suffered severe cramping in his left leg. Hospitalized, he underwent two surgeries to remove clots. Gangrene then set in and his left leg had to be amputated. Parrish was in considerable pain and could not get a good diagnosis from his doctors. With the onset of World War II, and Parrish' need for medical care, Mary and Parrish returned to the States, where he saw a number of doctors. He ultimately was diagnosed as having Buerger's disease (Thromboangiitis obliterans) ‚Äî a circulatory system malady that causes extreme thrombosis of the arteries and veins, causing severe pain, and often necessitating multiple amputations. The disease is progressive and there was (and is) no known successful treatment. They returned briefly to Switzerland to close down their apartment, and returned to California. They also needed to accumulate a stock of the painkiller Analgeticum, the only one that Parrish found efficacious, unavailable in the States. California and Provence: 1939‚Äì1955 Once in California, Mary searched for a warm dry climate that would be beneficial for Parrish's health. She found a small cabin on ninety acres of land south of Hemet, California. They bought the property and named it \\"Bareacres\\" after the character Lord Bareacres in Vanity Fair by Thackeray. Lord Bareacres was land-poor; his only asset was his estate. Mary wrote Powell: \\"God help us ... We've put our last penny into 90 acres of rocks and rattlesnakes.\\"Life in Letters, supra at 46‚Äì47. Although Parrish' life at Bareacres had its ups and downs, its course was a downward spiral. He continued to paint, and Powell staged an exhibition of his works. Mary was always trying to find ways to obtain Analgeticum; she even wrote President Roosevelt at one point to urge him to lift the import restriction on the drug.Passionate Years, supra at 194. Ultimately, Parrish could no longer tolerate the pain and the probable need for additional amputations. On the morning of August 6, 1941, Mary was awakened by a gunshot. Venturing outside, she discovered that Parrish had committed suicide.Passionate Years, supra at 196. Mary later would write, \\"I have never understood some (a lot of) taboos and it seems silly to me to make suicide one of them in our social life.\\"Poet, supra at 121. During the period leading up to Tim's death (Parrish was often called \\"Tim\\" by family and friends, but referred to as \\"Chexbres\\" in Fisher's autobiographical books), Mary completed three books. The first was a novel entitled The Theoretical Foot. It was a fictional account of expatriates enjoying a summer romp when the protagonist, suffering great pain, ends up losing a leg.Passionate Years, supra at 185. Transparently based on Tim, the novel was rejected by publishers. The second book was an unsuccessful attempt by her to revise a novel written by Tim, Daniel Among the Women.Poet, supra at 128. Third, she completed and published Consider the Oyster, which she dedicated to Tim. The book was humorous and informative. It contained numerous recipes incorporating oysters, mixed with musings on the history of the oyster, oyster cuisine, and the love life of the oyster.Passionate Years, supra at . In 1942, Mary published How to Cook a Wolf. The book was published at the height of WWII food shortages. \\"Pages offered housewives advice on how to achieve a balanced diet, stretch ingredients, eat during blackouts, deal with sleeplessness and sorrow, and care for pets during wartime.\\"Passionate Years, supra at 212. The book received good reviews and attained literary success, leading to a feature article on Mary in Look magazine in July 1942.Passionate Years, supra at 214. In May 1942 Mary began working in Hollywood for Paramount Studios. While there she wrote gags for Bob Hope, Bing Crosby, and Dorothy Lamour.Passionate Years, supra at 216. Mary became pregnant in 1943, and secluded herself in a boarding house in Altadena. While there she worked on the book that would become The Gastronomical Me.Passionate Years, supra at 219. On August 15, 1943, she gave birth to Anne Kennedy Parrish (later known as Anna).Passionate Years, supra at 220. Mary listed a fictional father on the birth certificate, Michael Parrish. Mary initially claimed she had adopted the baby; she never revealed the father's identity. In 1944, Mary broke her contract with Paramount. On a trip to New York, she met and fell in love with publisher Donald Friede. In a letter to Powell she wrote, \\"I accidentally got married to Donald Friede.\\" She spent the summer in Greenwich Village with Friede, working on the book that would become Let Us Feast.Pots and Pans, supra at 88. Her relationship with Friede gave her entree to additional publishing markets, and she wrote articles for Atlantic Monthly, Vogue, Town and Country, Today's Woman and Gourmet. In fall 1945, Friede's publishing entity failed, and Mary and Donald returned to Bareacres, both to write.Pots and Pans, supra at 89‚Äì90. On March 12, 1946, Mary gave birth to her second daughter, Kennedy Mary Friede.Pots and Pans, supra at 90. Mary began work on With Bold Knife and Fork. Mary's mother died in 1948. In 1949, she moved to the Ranch to take care of her father, Rex.Pots and Pans, supra at 93. On Christmas Eve 1949, the limited edition release of her translation of Savarin's The Physiology of Taste received rave reviews. \\"Craig Claiborne of the New York Times said Fisher's prose perfectly captured the wit and gaiety of the book and lauded the hundreds of marginal glosses that [she] added to elucidate the text.\\"Poet, supra at 203. During this period, Mary also was working on a biography of Madame R√©camier for which she had received an advance. Her marriage with Donald was starting to unravel. He became ill with intestinal pains and after considerable medical treatment, it became apparent that the pain was psychosomatic, and Don began receiving psychiatric care. Mary in turn had been under considerable stress. She had been caretaker for Tim, had weathered his suicide, suffered her brother's suicide a year later, followed by the death of her mother, only to be thrust into the role of caretaker for Rex. Despite her financially successful writing career, Don lived a lifestyle that exceeded their income, leaving her $27,000 in debt.Poet, supra at 195. She sought psychiatric counseling for what essentially was a nervous breakdown. By 1949, Donald had become frustrated by his isolation in a small Southern California town and separated from Mary. Don sought further treatment at the Harkness Pavilion in New York. Mary and Don divorced on August 8, 1950.Poet, supra at 210. Her father died June 2, 1953.Pots and Pans, supra at 102. Mary subsequently sold the Ranch and the newspaper.Pots and Pans, supra at 110. She rented out Bareacres and moved to Napa Valley, renting \\"Red Cottage\\" south of St. Helena, California. Dissatisfied with the educational opportunities available to her children, Mary sailed to France in 1954.Pots and Pans, supra at 103. She sailed out of Oakland on the MS Diemendyk to Antwerp, where they traveled directly to Aix through Paris.Poet, supra at 237. She ended up in Aix-en-Provence, France. She planned to live in Aix using the proceeds from the sale of her father's paper.Life in Letters, supra at 129. Once in Aix, Mary lodged with Mme Lanes at 17 rue Cardinale.Poet, supra at 240. She employed a French tutor and enrolled Anna and Kennedy, then aged 11 and 8, in the √âcole St Catherine. She described Mme Lanes as \\"incredibly fusty and 'correcte,'\\" part of the \\"poor but proud aristocracy.\\"Life in Letters, supra at 132‚Äì33. In Aix, her life developed a pattern. Each day she would walk across town to pick up the girls from school at noon, and in late afternoon they ate snacks or ices at the Deux Gar√ßons or Glaci√®re.Fisher, M F K Two Towns in Provence (hereafter Two Towns) at 59‚Äì60. She never felt completely at home. She felt patronized because she was an American: \\"I was forever in their eyes the product of a na√Øve, undeveloped, and indeed infantile civilization ...\\".Two Towns, supra at 63. At one point, an important local woman, introduced to her through mutual friends in Dijon, invited her to lunch. During the meal, the woman sneered at Mary: St Helena, CA: 1955‚Äì1970 Mary left Provence in July 1955, and sailed for San Francisco on the freighter Vesuvio.Pots and Pans, supra at 108. After living in the city for a short period, she decided that the intense urban environment did not provide the children enough freedom. She sold Bareacres and used the proceeds to buy an old Victorian house on Oak Street in St. Helena.Pots and Pans, supra at 111. She owned the house until 1970, using it as a base for frequent travels. During extended absences she would rent it out. Fisher home in Aix en Provence In fall 1959 she moved the family to Lugano, Switzerland, where she hoped to introduce her daughters to a new language and culture. She enrolled the girls in the Istituto Sant'Anna Convent boarding school.Pots and Pans, supra at 115. She revisited Dijon and Aix. Falling back in love with Aix, she rented the L'Harmas farmhouse outside Aix.Pots and Pans, supra at 114. In July 1961, she returned to San Francisco.Pots and Pans, supra at 124. In 1963, Mary decided to try her hand at teaching at the African-American Piney Woods Country Life School in Mississippi.Pots and Pans, supra at 125. It was not a good experience for her. She received mixed reviews and was not invited back for another term. She next contracted to write a series of cookbook reviews for The New Yorker magazine. Because her St. Helena house was rented out, she moved to her sister's home in Genoa, Nevada, to work on the assignment.Pots and Pans, supra at 126. In 1966, Time-Life hired Mary to write The Cooking of Provincial France.Pots and Pans, supra at 122. She traveled to Paris to research material for the book. While there, she met Paul and Julia Child, and through them James Beard.Life in Letters, supra at 118. Child was hired to be a consultant on the book; Michael Field was the consulting editor.Kamp, David, The United States of Arugula (hereafter Arugula) at 106 (Broadway Books 2006). Field rented out the Childs' country home ‚Äî La Pitchoune ‚Äî to work on the book. When Fisher later moved into the house immediately after Field, she found the refrigerator empty. She remarked: \\"How could a person who loves food be in the south of France and not at least have a piece of cheese in the refrigerator?\\"Arugula, supra at 106. Fisher was disappointed in the book's final form; it contained restaurant recipes, without regard to regional cuisine, and much of her signature prose had been cut.Arugula, supra at 106‚Äì07. Last House, Glen Ellen, California: 1970‚Äì1992 In 1971, Mary's friend David Bouverie, who owned a ranch in Glen Ellen, California, offered to build Mary a house on his ranch. Mary designed it, calling it \\"Last House\\". The presence of ranch staff made it easy for her to use the house as a base for frequent travels. She returned to France in 1970, 1973, 1976 and 1978, visiting, inter alia, La Roquette, Marseilles, and Aix.Pots and Pans, supra at 140.

It is so called because the wrestlers douse themselves with olive oil. The term \\"G√ºre≈ü\\" is shared with other forms of wrestling practiced by Turkic speakers across Europe and Central Asia, such as the Uzbek kurash, Tuvan khuresh and Tatar k√∂r√§≈ü. The wrestlers, known as pehlivan (meaning \\"hero\\" or \\"champion\\"), wear a type of hand-stitched leather trousers called a kisbet (sometimes kispet), which is traditionally made of water buffalo hide, and most recently has been made of calfskin. Unlike Olympic wrestling, oil wrestling matches may be won by achieving an effective hold of the kisbet. Thus, the pehlivan aims to control his opponent by putting his arm through the latter's kisbet. To win by this move is called pa√ßa kazƒ±k. Originally, matches had no set duration and could go on for one or two days until one man was able to establish his superiority, but in 1975 the duration was capped at 40 minutes for the baspehlivan and 30 minutes for the pehlivan category. If there is no winner, play continues for another 15 minutes--10 minutes for the pehlivan category, wherein scores are kept to determine the victor. The annual Kƒ±rkpƒ±nar tournament, held in Edirne in Turkish Thrace since 1346, is the oldest continuously running, sanctioned sporting competition in the world. Oil wrestling festivals also take place in the Turkish-inhabited regions of Bulgaria (Ludogorie and Rhodopes), as well as northern Greece in the Eastern Macedonia (Serres region) and West Thrace (Rhodope Mountains).28-ŒôŒøœÖŒª-2005 ŒÜœÅŒ∏œÅŒø œÉœÑŒ∑ŒΩ ŒïœÜŒ∑ŒºŒµœÅŒØŒ¥Œ± Œø ŒßœÅœåŒΩŒøœÇ : Œ£œÑŒ± ¬´ŒßŒØŒªŒπŒ±¬ª ŒîŒµœÅŒØŒøœÖ œÑŒø œÄœÅœéœÑŒø ŒµœÄŒØœÉŒ∑ŒºŒø œÄœÅœâœÑŒ¨Œ∏ŒªŒ∑ŒºŒ± œÄŒ¨ŒªŒ∑œÇ ŒºŒµ ŒªŒ¨Œ¥Œπ.7-ŒëœÖŒ≥-2007 ŒÜœÅŒ∏œÅŒø œÉœÑŒ∑ŒΩ ŒµœÜŒ∑ŒºŒµœÅŒØŒ¥Œ± Œü ŒßœÅœåŒΩŒøœÇ : Œ•œÄŒøœÑŒøŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒÆ Œ∑ œÄœÅŒøœÉŒ≠ŒªŒµœÖœÉŒ∑ œÑŒøœÖ Œ∫œåœÉŒºŒøœÖ œÉœÑŒ± 'ŒßŒØŒªŒπŒ±' - Œ†Œ±ŒΩŒ∑Œ≥œçœÅŒπ œÄŒ¨ŒªŒ∑œÇ Œ∫Œ±Œπ ŒµŒªŒµœçŒ∏ŒµœÅŒ∑œÇ Œ¥ŒπŒ±Œ∫ŒØŒΩŒ∑œÉŒ∑œÇ ŒπŒ¥ŒµœéŒΩ\\". In recent years, this style of wrestling has also become popular in other countries, particularly the Netherlands and Japan. History Cognate forms of folk wrestling practiced by Turkic-speakers are found throughout Western Eurasia (i.e. Europe and Central Asia) under the names K√∂ra≈ü, Khuresh, Kurash, etc. A game of oil wrestling in the gardens of the Topkapi Palace Oil wrestling can be traced back to the ancient Sumer and Babylon.Kirkpinar - All about Turkish Oilwrestling, Page 75 Greco-Roman traditions also point to the practice of oil wrestling.Kirkpinar - All about Turkish Oilwrestling, Page 88 The Turkish word for wrestling can be traced back to the old Oghuz Turkic languages, which originate from the Eurasian steppes, where wrestling has also been practiced. After the conquest of Anatolia by Seljuk Turks, a form of traditional freestyle wrestling called Karakucak G√ºre≈üi (literally \\"Ground hug\\") was popularized, where special leather clothing was sanctioned and wrestlers commenced the activity by pouring olive oil on their bodies in order to make it harder for the wrestler grip one's opponent. This form continued to what is today known as Yaƒülƒ± G√ºre≈ü or Turkish oil wrestling. In the Ottoman Empire, wrestlers learned the art in special schools called tekke (), which were not merely athletic centres, but also spiritual centres. Wrestlers oil one another prior to matches as a demonstration of balance and mutual respect. If a man defeats an older opponent, he kisses the latter's hand (a sign of respect for elders in Turkey). Matches are held all over Turkey throughout the year, but in early summer, around 1000 competitors gather in Kƒ±rkpƒ±nar for an annual three-day wrestling tournament to determine who will be the winner or baspehlivan (\\"chief wrestler\\") of Turkey. Ottoman chroniclers and writers attest that the Kƒ±rkpƒ±nar Games have been held every year since 1362, making them the world's oldest continually sanctioned sporting competition. The games have been cancelled only about 70 times. The original site was some distant. In 1924, they were moved to the present location after the Balkan War. There are some organized oil wrestling competitions outside Turkey, particularly by the Royal Dutch Power Sport Federation (KNKF Koninklijke Nederlandse Krachtsport en Fitnessfederatie) in the Netherlands.

Its capital is the city of Terni. The province came into being in 1927, when it was carved out of the original unitary province of Umbria. The province of Terni has an area of 2,122 km¬≤, and a total population of 228,836 (2016). There are 33 comunes () in the province.http://www.upinet.it In June 2006, the only comunes with a population over 10,000 were Terni, Orvieto, Narni and Amelia.  Geography  It is bordered to the north with the Province of Perugia, to the east, south and west with the Lazio (Province of Rieti and Province of Viterbo) and to north-west with the Tuscany (Province of Siena). The province extends into the south-west of the Umbria region, occupying the last section of the Nera River valley near the confluence with the Velino River, and the eastern part of the valley of the Tiber River. The province of Terni is characterized by its slopes encountered along the path of rivers, allowing the exploitation of hydro catchment areas, so as to have led to the creation of several artificial lakes: * Lake Corbara * Lake Alviano * Lake Recentino * Lake San Liberato * Lake Arezzo * Lake Piediluco  History  In the 2nd millennium BC the province was occupied by a population called Umbri, who founded the cities of Amelia, Narnia Nahars, Otricolum and Interamna Nahars. With the development of the Etruscan civilization, their territory was reduced to the valleys of the Black and Velino. One of the most important and richest Etruscan cities in Province of Terni was Orvieto and an unidentified place called Fanum Voltumnae. For centuries, Umbrian and Etruscan fought hard for the rule of the Tiber valley, until, in 299 BC when Roman legions began the invasion of Umbria. The provincial territory was part of the Roman Republic and then the Roman Empire until the latter's western part fell in the 5th century AD. In 571 the Lombards, after invading the Po Plain, went down the Apennines and, in 575, founded the Duchy of Spoleto in what is now Umbria and the neighbouring areas; this state remained formally independent until 1250. In 1527 Terni was used a camp of the Landsknecht army that would subsequently take part in the Sack of Rome and fought at Spoleto and Todi, where the League of Cognac troops were located. Before the late-19th century industrial development, Terni was a small center with some 15,000 inhabitants in 1881. In 1921 it had grown to 40,000 inhabitants. In 1926 it became the seat of a separate province, detached from Perugia, including the countryside around the main centres of Terni and Orvieto.

Ltd. (M-OV) of Britain in 1937.  Overview  The KT66 is the direct descendant of the \\"Harries Valve\\" developed by British engineer J. Owen Harries and marketed by the Hivac Co. Ltd. in 1935. Harries is believed to be the first engineer to discover the \\"critical distance\\" effect, which maximized the efficiency of a power tetrode by positioning its anode at a distance which is a specific multiple of the screen grid-cathode distance. This design also minimized interference of secondary emission electrons dislodged from the anode. EMI engineers Cabot Bull and Sidney Rodda improved the Harries design with a pair of beam plates, connected to the cathode, which directed the electron streams into two narrow areas, which caused the electron beams to act like a virtual suppressor grid to deflect some secondary electrons back to the anode. The beam tetrode design was also undertaken to avoid the patents which the giant Philips firm held on power pentodes in Europe. Because this overall design eliminated the \\"tetrode kink\\" in the lower parts of the tetrode's voltage-current characteristic curves (which sometimes caused tetrode amplifiers to become unstable), M-OV marketed this tube family as the \\"KT\\" series, standing for \\"kinkless tetrode\\". A number of different KT tubes were later marketed by M-OV. Some, but not all, were versions of existing American beam tetrode tubes or European power pentodes, such as the KT66 (6L6 similar), KT77 (EL34 and 6CA7 similar), KT88 (6550), and KT63 (6F6, pentode but almost identical characteristics). Although the RCA 6L6 of 1936 (the result of a license agreement between RCA and M-OV) was the first true \\"beam power tube\\" on the market, the later KT66 became almost equally famous, at least in Europe. The two tubes were nearly interchangeable, except that the KT66 was somewhat more rugged than the early metal 6L6. leftThe KT66 was very popular in European radios and audio amplifiers. It was the standard output tube in the classic Quad II (1952, a version of which is still being manufactured today) and in the LEAK Type 15 (1945) and TL/12 (1948), both among the earliest British hi-fi amplifiers. Because of their excellent electrical characteristics and overload tolerance, KT66s are preferred by some guitar players for use in guitar amps in place of 6L6GC. However, the plate dissipation of the 6L6GC, at 30W, exceeds the KT66's 25W, and adjustment of the amplifier's bias is necessary. M-OV ceased glass vacuum tube manufacturing in 1988; their old audio tube types became valuable collectibles. In 2004 original M-OV KT66 tubes (bearing the official \\"Genalex\\" marketing brand that M-OV used outside the UK), unused in original carton, sold for US$250. KT66 tubes continued to be manufactured at Reflektor Saratov in Russia, JJ Electronic in Slovakia, and at Liuzhou in China. Some modern Russian manufacture Sovtek KT66 tubes are actually 6L6GC tubes in a KT66 style bottle. While these tubes have the same pinout and minimum tolerances required of a KT66 tube, they do not have the performance characteristics of a true kinkless tetrode KT66 tube. By contrast the very latest Russian manufactured tubes (2012) not only carry the same internal electrode structure as the original KT66 (they now look the same) they also have the same rugged electrical characteristics and can withstand a high voltage on grid 2 comparable to the anode voltage rating, allowing greater power output afforded by higher voltage capability when run in ultralinear connection.

According to the 2011 census, it has an area of which is 57.99% of the total state area and a population of 34,193,868 which is 69.20% of Andhra Pradesh state population. This area includes the coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh on the Coromandel Coast between the Eastern Ghats and the Bay of Bengal, from the northern border with Odisha to Pulicat lake in the South. Coastal Andhra has rich agricultural land, owing to the delta of the Godavari Krishna river and Penna. The prosperity of Coastal Andhra can be attributed to its rich agricultural land and an abundant water supply from these three rivers. Rice grown in paddy fields is the main crop, with pulses and coconuts also being important. The fishing industry is also important to the region.  History  Jain Tirthankara Image at Rockcut Caves of Ghanikonda in Ramatheertham. The region of Andhra rose to political power during the reign of the Maurya Dynasty. Megasthenes mentioned that Andhra was a flourishing empire of the Satavahanas' since before the common era. Coastal Andhra was also ruled by the famous Chalukyas in between the period of the 7th Century and the 10th century CE. This period was followed by the reign of many other dynasties such as the Cholas, the Kakatiyas as well as the Vijayanagar Empire. Antarvedi temple on the banks of Godavari in Andhra Pradesh. According to 11th century inscriptions, coastal Andhra is bounded by Mahendragiri mountains (in north-eastern border with Gajapati district of Orissa), Kalahasti temple (in Chittoor district near the border of Nellore district), Srisailam temple (in Kurnool district near the border of Mahbubnagar district and Prakasham district). The Gajapati and Ganjam districts of Odisha were granted to the French East India Company around 1752. Later they were transferred by the French to the British. Nellore, which extends as far as Ongole Taluk, was later received from the Nawab of Arcot, under an establishment. Some parts of present-day Nellore and Chittoor were in the hands of Venkatagiri Rajas. The British made an arrangement with the Raja of Venkatagiri in 1802 to claim power in those territories also. The districts of Andhra (Circar) and Rayalaseema were ceded by the Nizam of Hyderabad to the British colonial administration, which became part of Madras Presidency.  Geography  Coastal Andhra is located in the eastern region of the state of Andhra Pradesh on the Coromandel Coast and comprises nine districts: East Godavari, West Godavari, Guntur, Krishna, Nellore, Prakasam, Srikakulam, Visakhapatnam, and Vizianagaram. It borders Rayalaseema regions of the state and the states of Telangana, Odisha. The presence of the Krishna River Godavari River and Penna River makes the area fertile for irrigation. The coastal line of this region is the second longest in the country, extending up to 974 km.  Demographics  The area had a total population of 34,195,655 as per 2011 Census of India. Coastal Andhra is predominantly Hindu (around 87%), but there is also a growing Christian minority from predominantly the SC and ST groups. Estimates of the Christian population range from 4% to even 10% of the Coastal Andhra population. https://www.britannica.com/place/Andhra- Pradesh/People The main and most spoken language is Telugu.

His nephew, who was the commander-in-chief of a 30.000 men army took over power and opposed with tenacity the Portuguese until 1890. By then, Farlah, the last sultan resumed the war against the Portuguese until he was captured in a battle in 1910 and deported to East Timor where he died in prison. The small island is subject to cyclones; Cyclone Huda in particular is remembered, and so permanent habitation has not been possible.

Life He was born to a Croat family from Drinovci near Grude on 18 November 1898, in the family of Vida and Martin ≈†imiƒá. He attended primary school in his native village, and then the first three forms of the Franciscan classical grammar school in ≈†iroki Brijeg. He decided to change school in the fourth form and went to Mostar and afterwards to Vinkovci. His unruly spirit made him change his surroundings again and so he continued his education in Zagreb, in the upper town grammar school. In 1917, he started the journal for art and culture, Vijavica (Whirlwind), which forced him to leave school. This is when he lost his parents' support and it also meant a hard life overpowered by many illnesses. After four issues of Vijavica, taking the example of German journal Der Sturm, he also launched another journal, Juri≈° (Attack), which likewise had a short life of three issues only. He went on writing poems, literary and art critiques and also translating. At the Faculty of Philosophy he met Tatjana Mariniƒá to whom he dedicated his one and only collection, Preobra≈æenja (Metamorphoses) in 1920. Between 1918 and 1919, he immersed himself into writing poems whilst staying in a hamlet of Drinovci, Dubrava Majiƒái, in a cottage where his mother grew up. Some of his first expressionist works were created here, most notably \\"Ja pjevam\\" (I Sing), \\"Povratak\\" (The Return) and \\"Ljubav\\" (Love). His modest income and dedication to his literary work left a mark on his health, so he went back to Drinovci in December 1923 and made up with his father. When he returned to Zagreb in spring 1924 he launched his third journal, Knji≈æevnik (Writer). Some time in 1924, he contracted tuberculosis, for which he received treatment later that year in a hospital in Dubrovnik, and spent time recuperating in a sanatorium in Cavtat. However, after his return to Zagreb in February 1925, his condition rapidly worsened. He died on 2 May 1925 in a hospital in Zagreb and was buried in Mirogoj Cemetery. Works ≈†imiƒá did not write a large literary opus during his lifetime. However, some of his poems could be called anthological, like \\"Pjesnici\\" (Poets), \\"Veƒçe i ja\\" (The Evening and I), \\"Opomena\\" (Warning), \\"Ruƒçak siromaha\\" (The Poor Man's Dinner), \\"≈Ωene pred uredima\\" (Women in Front of Offices), \\"Smrt i ja\\" (Death and I), \\"Pjesma jednom brijegu\\" (Poem to a Mountain), \\"Smrt\\" (Death), and some others. After writing under the influence of Mato≈°, Kranjƒçeviƒá, Vidriƒá and Domjaniƒá, he bore down on the traditionalists and started favouring an unrestrained expression and expressionist spirit. In his collection Preobra≈æenja (Metamorphoses), using a free verse, he wrote tersely, rhythmically, gnomically and logically. He would also sometimes recourse to the decasyllabic line and the folk lament. His topics are the man, pain, poverty, stars, Herzegovina, the poor, life and death (\\"death is something quite human\\"). When he turns to the man he warns him: Be careful not to go, small as thou are, under the stars, man, (from the poem Warning). When he writes about the mystery and perseverance, he says: We watch each other silently. Mountain and man. I'll never know where our different meanings meet- (Poem to a mountain). In his journals, ≈†imiƒá published his essays that defended the principles of expressionism, which influenced his later poetry. In particular, his views were based on the tenets of German Expressionism. The image of A.B. ≈†imiƒá can be seen on 20 km banknote of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The valley is home to the cities of Spokane Valley, Liberty Lake, and Millwood (all of which are suburbs of the city of Spokane). The valley is bounded on the north and south by the Selkirk Mountains, on the west by Spokane, and on the east by the Rathdrum Prairie at the Idaho state border. Mica Peak, located south of the valley, is the southernmost peak in the Selkirk Range. The mountain, along with surrounding peaks, separates the Spokane Valley from the Palouse. The Valley contains part of the Spokane Valley‚ÄìRathdrum Prairie Aquifer. Climate Most of the valley is classified as a Mediterranean Climate (K√∂ppen Csa), however the western slope of the Saltese Uplands closely border on a semi-arid climate (K√∂ppen Bsk). Sagebrush and Greasewood along Interstate 90 in Spokane Valley History =Early History= For thousands of years, native peoples lived in the Valley, and included it in their seasonal migrations, where they hunted, fished, gathered, and dug rootsJones & Stokes (2007). \\"Addendum Cultural Resources Survey Report. Bigelow Gulch/Forker Road Urban Connector Project\\". May. Prepared for Spokane County Public Works, Division of Engineering and Roads. Bellevue, WA.. Prior to European settlers, the Valley was occupied the Spokane and Coeur d‚ÄôAlene people. Starting in the early 1800s, fur traders sent by the North West Company (later merged with the Hudson's Bay Company) arrived in Spokane territory. West of the Valley, two trading posts were established near the mouth of the Little Spokane, 1810-1826 Northwest of there, missionaries established the Tshimakain Mission, 1838-1848.. The first settler in the Valley was Antoine Plante, a French Canadian and Blackfoot, and his wife, Mary of the Flathead nation. He came as an employee of the Hudson's Bay Company, for which he worked for two years before becoming a Freeman. He built a small cabin near the Spokane River in 1849 (now the Plantes Ferry Recreation Park between the neighborhoods of Trentwood and Irwin), from which he ran a small Hudson's Bay Company trading post. He operated the first ferry across the Spokane River, the only means of crossing the river in the area, from 1852-1864. =Washington Territory= In 1853, two years after the establishment of the Washington Territory, the first governor, Isaac Stevens, made an initial effort to make a treaty with Chief Garry and the Spokanes at Antoine Plantes' cabin. In spite of the calming influence of Chief Garry, the Spokanes protested the loss of their lands by joining in the Coeur d'Alene War of 1858. The battle culminated in the Battle of Spokane Plains, while there was no decisive winner, the tribes were greatly weakened. The Spokanes were forced from the lands of their ancestors to a reservation north of the Spokane River, just west of the Spokane area. In 1862, A. C. \\"Charley\\" Kendall established a store on the north side of the Spokane River at the far east end of the Valley. A bridge to cross the river at Kendall's store was soon built by Joe Herring, Timothy Lee, and Ned Jordan in 1864, strategically located nearer the Mullan Road than Plante's Ferry. A small community, known as Spokane Bridge, began to build up near the bridge. It boasts the first hotel and post office in the Valley. In 1871, it became a stop on the Pony Express, connecting The Dalles, Oregon Territory, to Missoula, Montana Territory. Before the turn of the century, early pioneers, many of them silver miners, arrived from the East by way of the Northern Pacific and Great Northern railroads, for which Spokane was a major hub. By 1883, the first transcontinental rail was established. The railroad activity created support for extensive shops and facilities. Within a few years, Spokane was tied to the outside world by five transcontinental railroads, making it the hub of commerce it remains today. =Early 1900s= Irrigation efforts stimulated population growth in the Spokane Valley significantly in the early part of the 20th century. Developers and real estate speculators tapped into nearby lakes, the Spokane River and the aquifer lying under the valley in an effort to turn the dry land into saleable agricultural land. In 1899, the Spokane Valley Land and Water Co., later owned by long-time irrigation advocate D.C. Corbin, built a canal to irrigate land in the Greenacres area with water from Liberty Lake. In 1905, the Spokane Canal Company built a canal to irrigate the Otis Orchard area with water from Newman Lake, and Modern Irrigation and Land Company tapped into the underground aquifer to irrigate in Opportunity. Within just twenty years, of dry land was converted into fertile farmland. Water access greatly increased land values. Valley population grew from 1,000 residents in 1900 to nearly 10,000 by 1922. Extensive apple orchards thrived in the gravelly soil of the Valley, and by 1912 nearly 2 million apple trees had been planted. A huge packing plant was built in 1911 by the Spokane Valley Growers Union. The Spokane Valley was developed as townships. In 1908, the state granted the formation of county townships as semi-autonomous, self-governing bodies, with the same basic governing rights as most municipalities, including the ability to levy property taxes. Only Spokane and Whatcom counties took full advantage of these townships with taxing capabilities, essentially reducing the need to incorporate rural communities. These townships fulfilled the basic needs for services in the rural districts until the State revoked their taxing rights in 1969, after which the unfunded townships declined until the Spokane County voted to disorganize them in 1974. The Valley townships were East Spokane, Opportunity and Greenacres, the southern edge of Pleasant Prairie, Foothills, and Newman, and the northern edge of Chester. A few Spokane Valley towns developed for residential and/or business purposes. Trent (now Irwin) was originally platted as a residential area for Northern Pacific railroad workers in 1881. Millwood (originally Woodward) began as a \\"company town\\", developed by Inland Empire Paper Mill for their employees, and Dishman developed primarily as a business center. All other Valley townships were developed as irrigation districts and owe their existence to their agricultural roots. Between 1901 and 1915, the communities of Orchard Avenue, Greenacres, Otis Orchards, Opportunity, Vera, Dishman, Liberty Lake, Newman Lake, East Spokane, Mica and Chester were platted. Pasadena Park is a populated place located in Spokane County at latitude 47.697 and longitude -117.283, North of Millwood across the Spokane River that existed at least as early as 1916.http://washington.hometownlocator.com/wa/spokane/pasadena-park.cfm Hometown Locator: Pasadena Park The Spokane Valley was promoted as a wonderful place to live. Though most Valley residents were farmers or orchardists, canneries, brickyards, railroad maintenance facilities and lumber mills provided jobs for many. The beauty of the surrounding area, pleasant communities, fertile farmlands, business opportunities, outdoor sports and activities, local recreational areas and community organizations caused it to be called \\"Spokane Valley, the Valley Bountiful\\". As the population increased, small communities with schools, churches, businesses, community clubs and organizations thrived. Tied to Spokane, local lakes and Coeur d‚ÄôAlene by railroads and bus systems, the people of the Valley enjoyed a full life. In the years that followed, crop troubles and irrigation system maintenance problems prompted many residents to sell their farms in five, ten, or plots for suburban home sites. Many of the apple trees were pulled out and replaced by neighborhoods and truck farms. The truck farms were successful in raising strawberries, raspberries, tomatoes, beans, peas, watermelons, asparagus, squash, cucumbers and thousands of acres of Heart of Gold cantaloupes. Dairy, poultry and fur farms also appeared in the Valley during these years. =1930s to 1950s= While jobs were scarce during the Great Depression, most people in the Spokane Valley had enough land to grow food for their families. The Spokane Valley Chamber of Commerce adhered to a positive agenda throughout these hard times. They placed street signs on Valley roads and in an effort to show solidarity with Spokane, east-west roads were renamed to correspond with Spokane's roads. Observing that fires were a constant and catastrophic problem for area residents, the Chamber lobbied to begin a fire protection district in the Valley. Their efforts were successful and Valley residents were first offered fire protection in 1940, with the formation of Spokane County Fire Protection District Number One. Spokane University, a four-year liberal arts college operated in the Spokane Valley from 1913 to 1933. when it closed due to financial difficulties amid the Great Depression. It briefly reopened as Spokane Valley Junior College, before facilities were moved to Spokane's South Hill and merged into the newly formed Spokane Junior College in 1935. The campus of Spokane University was eventually used by University High School from 1962 until 2002, when it relocated to new facilities. The campus has been occupied by Valley Christian School since 2005. The people of the valley always maintained independence from the City of Spokane on its borders. The first local newspaper, The Spokane Valley Herald, was launched in 1920. In 1919 an early municipal airfield was carved out, later named Felts Field in honor of Herald owner Buell Felts who died in a plane crash there. A streetcar line was started as early as 1908, and later extended to Liberty Lake in the east part of the valley, where entertainment facilities were built for music and outdoor gatherings. Other than Millwood, which incorporated in 1927 and Liberty Lake, Washington which did so in 2001, the Valley remained unincorporated throughout the 20th century. Industry began to replace agriculture more rapidly after the completion of Grand Coulee Dam in 1941, which combined cheap electricity with readily available water from the Spokane River and the extensive aquifer which underlies the Valley. At its height, the Valley was the site for an aluminum plant, a cement plant and a paper mill. Plans to attract light industry through the establishment of an industrial park at a former military depot were not very successful. The cement plant closed in the 1950s, but the paper mill and aluminum plant remain. In the 1950s a further transformation swept the valley as the post World War II population boom began to push into the valley, replacing most of the remaining apple orchards with tracts of houses. The first shopping mall was built at University Village on Sprague Avenue (formerly called Appleway), which became the major artery through the Valley, lined with stores and restaurants. The last large-scale orchard irrigations ended in the late 1950s, canvas pipes running down residential streets replacing the old ditches by that time. =Last half of 20th Century= In the later decades of the last century, the Valley experienced a large influx of retirees due to inexpensive housing and the relatively dry weather. Retirement complexes and apartment blocks began to appear. At the present time the Valley remains principally a suburban area, a mixture of families and retirees and the retail commerce to support them. In the 1990s and the early part of the twenty-first century the Spokane Valley continued to grow more urban, becoming one of the fastest growing regions in the state. Commercial growth increased and joined residential growth as it moved towards the state line. The urban development included the opening of the long-awaited Spokane Valley Mall in 1997, the establishment of dozens of other businesses along business corridors, and the development of the Mirabeau Point community complex.

He is among the most esteemed of living pianists, his repertoire spanning composers from the Baroque period such as Bach, Couperin or Rameau up to Schoenberg and Arapov. He regularly tours Europe (excluding the UK) and resides in Italy.  Biography  Sokolov was born in Leningrad, now Saint Petersburg, to Russian Jewish father Lipman Girshevich Sokolov and Russian mother Galina Nikolayevna Zelenetskaya. He began studying the piano at the age of five and entered the Leningrad Conservatory's special school for children at the age of seven to study with Leah Zelikhman. After graduating from the children's school, he continued studying at the Conservatory with Moisey Khalfin. At 12, he gave his first major recital in Moscow, in a concert of works by Bach, Beethoven, Schumann, Chopin, Mendelssohn, Rachmaninoff, Scriabin, Liszt, Debussy and Shostakovich at the Philharmonic Society. At age 16, he came to international attention when the jury at the 1966 International Tchaikovsky Piano Competition awarded him the gold medal. It seems this may have been a surprising result: \\"16-year old Grisha Sokolov, who finally became the winner of that competition, was not taken seriously by anyone at that time.\\"Vladimir Krainev quoted in Russia's Great Modern Pianists, Mark Zilberquit 1983 Despite his Tchaikovsky Competition success, Sokolov's international career began to develop only towards the end of the 1980s. Some have speculated International Piano September/October 2006 that his not defecting and the limited travelling allowed under the Soviet regime were to blame. This is contradicted by the fact that Sokolov gave U.S. tours in 1969, 1971, 1975 and 1979, as well as numerous recitals elsewhere in the world such as Finland and Japan. \\"Sokolov's life as a touring soloist is quite overcrowded. He tours a great deal in both his motherland and abroad.\\" The 1980s seem to have posed something of a stumbling-block to Sokolov's career in the U.S. \\"In the beginning, I played a lot of single concerts in America, in 1969, '71 and, I think, 1975. After that there was a break in relationships between the U.S. and the Soviet Union‚Äîthey were disconnected by the Afghanistan war. A scheduled tour in the U.S. was cancelled in 1980. Then all cultural agreements between the two countries were cancelled.\\"Sokolov quoted in \\"Pianist left out by the Cold War. U.S.-Russian difficulties kept Grigory Sokolov a mystery to all but those in conservatories.\\" Karen Schaefer, The Plain Dealer, Cleveland, 4 March 1996 In addition, during the breakup of the former Soviet Union, Sokolov played no concerts outside Russia.Karen Schaefer, The Plain Dealer, Cleveland, 4 March 1996 He is now a well-known figure in concert halls around Europe, but much less so in the U.S. Sokolov has released relatively few recordings to date, and released none for the 20 years between 1995 and 2015. But in 2014 he signed a contract with Deutsche Grammophon to release recordings of some of his live performances, and in 2015 he released a 2-CD live Salzburg recital featuring two sonatas by Mozart, Chopin's cycle of 24 Preludes, and encore pieces by Scriabin, Chopin, Rameau and Bach. Public statements In March 2009, Sokolov cancelled a planned concert in London because of British visa requirements demanding that all non-E.U. workers provide fingerprints and eye prints with every visa application (he also cancelled his 2008 concert on seemingly similar grounds). Sokolov protested that such requirements had echoes of Soviet oppression. After British music critic Norman Lebrecht received the Cremona Music Award 2014, Sokolov, upon learning of his being awarded the Cremona Music Award 2015, refused to accept the honour, making this statement on his website: \\"According to my ideas about elementary decency, it is shame to be in the same award-winners list with Lebrecht.\\" Sokolov's statement appeared to refer to personal remarks Lebrecht had made about Sokolov's family.  Influences  Sokolov cited the following pianists as having inspired him in his years of studies: \\"Of those whom I heard on the stage I'd like to name first of all Emil Gilels. Judging by the records, it was Rachmaninoff, Sofronitsky, Glenn Gould, Solomon [and] Lipatti. As to aesthetics, I feel most close to Anton Rubinstein.\\"  Repertoire  The 14 CDs (2 of Bach, 2 of Beethoven, 2 of Schubert, 2 of Chopin, 1 of Brahms, and 1 of Scriabin, Rachmaninoff and Prokofiev‚Äîall recorded by the label Opus 111, plus a 2-CD 2008 recital set released in 2015 and another 2-CD set taken from recitals in 2013 and released in 2016, both issued by DG on CD and LP) and 1 DVD (a live recital in Paris) that are currently (2015) available for Sokolov constitute a snapshot of the repertoire that Sokolov has so far performed. There is now a second (DG) DVD, of a concert (including the 'Hammerklavier' Sonata) recorded in the Berlin Philharmonie on June 5, 2013. This DVD was directed by Bruno Monsaingeon.

It was located at 27 Walters Drive, Osborne Park, Western Australia 6017. The Curriculum Council was governed by the 1997 Curriculum Council Act. Set up in 1997, the Council was disbanded following a litany of failures in 2012. It was replaced by the School Curriculum and Standards Authority. The goal of the Curriculum Council was to provide for the development and implementation of a Curriculum Framework for schooling which sets out the knowledge, understandings, skills, values and attitudes that students are expected to acquire; provides for the development and accreditation of courses of study for post-compulsory schooling; and provides for the assessment and certification of student achievement. Principles Student learning is the major stated principle of the Curriculum. The Curriculum policy directions are underpinned by the following stated principles: * an encompassing view of the Curriculum (K-12); * a recognition of the significance of learning outcomes; * fair and explicit standards; * inclusivity; * an agreed set of values; * consultative and transparent decision making processes; * collaboration with stakeholders. History Paul Albert was appointed as the inaugural Chief executive of the Curriculum Council by the then education minister, Colin Barnett, shortly after the formation of the Council in 1997 when it superseded the Secondary Education Authority. Albert was appointed on a five-year contract, and left the Council in 2001, leaving Norma Jeffery as the CEO. Norma Jeffery was appointed as Chief Executive of the Council in 2003. Jeffery was responsible for the implementation of the Curriculum Framework and in 2005 began to introduce the new courses of study into Year 11 of senior high schools in Western Australia under the direction of the then education minister Ljiljanna Ravlich. Jeffery commissioned a report on the assessment scheme that was to be used in the controversial system of outcomes based education from Professor David Andrich, the Dean of Education at Murdoch University in 2005. The report was duly completed later the same year and found that strongly argued case for marks arising from analytic assessments to be used for tertiary selection and against the levelling system that was currently being used. Consequently, Jeffery was removed from her position and transferred elsewhere in the public service and replaced by Greg Robson. Robson left shortly afterward accepting a position in the Department of Education in South Australia. David Axworthy, who was appointed as the acting Chief Executive of the Curriculum Council in 2005, announced in July 2006 that he would not continue in the position. This followed widespread opposition to the introduction of the states ill-conceived outcomes based education system into the school system that Axworthy was in charge of. As a result, the Council was going to have to find its fourth Chief in twelve months. Dave Wood was appointed to the role of Chief executive of the Curriculum Council in 2006, in the midst of a furore of the botched introduction of Outcomes Based Education in schools in Western Australia. In 2009 the Council miscalculated final scores for students who had completed practical tests for three courses. The Chief executive of the Curriculum Council, Dave Wood, was dumped in 2010 by the then education minister, Liz Constable, following a string of errors being identified in the WACE examinations from 2010. The minister stated that serious problems with the year 12 examinations were the reason Woods' contract was not renewed. Errors had been identified in the History, Physics, Maths, English and Business Management and Enterprise exams, evidence of failures in the councils proof- reading processes. Some of the mistakes included a Physics question where the incorrect unit of measurement was used, a history exam where an image was labelled 1915 instead of 1925., a mathematics exam where an incorrect answer had been given in an example question, a music exam where questions were asked that were not in the subject syllabus. Other more serious blunders by the Council included a printing error in an economics exam where questions from the history course had been included and an exam supervisor allowing students to use notes when they were not supposed to. In another instance of outright incompetence a food science and technology exam had to be rewritten after it had been displayed on the Council web-site for two days. The Council claimed that the mistakes were the result of budget cuts, although its budget had actually increased from 7 Million in 2007 to 14 million in 2010. Both the Council charmain, Professor Bill Louden, and the Chief executive, Dave Wood, were reprimanded by the then minister of education, Liz Constable after she had expressly asked them to recheck all papers after initial errors were discovered. Further problems occurred in 2011 when complaints about the Chemistry exam made by teachers concerned that a large proportion of the exam had been devoted to an obscure part of the course. Also the exam had asked for an essay to be written on a topic when the exam design brief specified that only short paragraph style answers were required. The current acting Chief executive, Allan Blagaich, claimed that the exams did fit the design brief. Additional complaints were also made about the Modern History and the English exam. The Curriculum Council was disbanded in 2012 and replaced by the new School Curriculum and Standards Authority. The new authority will be chaired by Patrick Garnett.

He was the last Independent to serve as Governor of Rhode Island until Lincoln Chafee (2011‚Äì2015). American Revolution Born in Newport in the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, he was the son of Samuel and Elizabeth Collins. He stood forth as a staunch advocate of the independence of the Thirteen Colonies. An admirer of George Washington, he was selected by the governor of Rhode Island in 1776 to carry a letter to Washington informing him of the condition of the colony and soliciting counsel upon the best method to adopt for its defense. Later (1782) he was made bearer to the President of Congress of a statement of Rhode Island's reasons for rejecting the Impost Act. During the American Revolution, Rhode Island was for the most part an agricultural area and as such opposed the restrictions of a national government. In 1778, Collins represented Rhode Island in the Second Continental Congress, where he served until May 1781, when he was superseded by William Ellery. He was, however, re-elected in 1782 and held the position until 1783. Post Revolution Within the state the agricultural interests vigorously advocated a paper currency. Collins espoused their cause and in 1786 was elected governor. During his term in office the issuance of paper money, which had been ceased at intervals since 1750, was resumed. It was provided by law that should any creditor refuse to accept the bills of the state the debtor might secure a discharge by depositing the amount of his debt with one of the judges of the state superior court or the court of common pleas. This law led to the suit of Trevett vs. Weeden, which resulted in a decision looking toward the right of courts to declare legislative enactments unconstitutional.Richman, I. B., Rhode Island, A Study in Separatism, 1905, pp. 78‚Äì81. In 1786 Collins was elected governor of Rhode Island and took office on May 3, 1786. Rhode Island's ratification of the U.S. Constitution When George Washington was inaugurated as President on April 30, 1789 Rhode Island was one of only two of the thirteen original states (along with North Carolina) not to have ratified the United States Constitution and was, technically speaking, an independent nation with Collins as it chief of state. Anti-Federalist elements in Rhode Island, up to 1790, vigorously fought against the calling of a convention to decide upon entering the Federal Union, but in that year (January 17) gave its sanction to such a call by a majority of one vote in the General Assembly. This vote was cast by Collins, who had come to realize the importance of a Federal connection. The vote cost him his popularity and the governorship. He left office on May 5, 1790. The Rhode Island General Assembly ratified the United States Constitution on May 29. Later in 1790 Collins was elected to the 1st Congress but did not take his seat. Personal life Collins was married to Mary, daughter of John Avery of Boston, and his daughter Abigail married John Warren. Collins died at Newport and was buried on his farm, \\"Brenton Neck\\", near Brenton Point in that city. His grandson and namesake, John Collins Covell (1823‚Äì1887), was a principal of the Virginia School for the Deaf and the Blind and West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind. The Rhode Island Society of the Sons of the Revolution holds an annual observance of Rhode Island Independence Day (May 4) at Governor Collins' grave. Notes References * \\"John Collins\\".

Name The Punic name of the town was (). The Latin name ' has Berber roots. History \\"Royal Ditch\\" () that marked the border between the Roman-controlled Africa and independent Berber tribes. East of the ditch, cities were fully romanized by the arrival of the Vandals Thysdrus began as a small Carthaginian and Berber village. Following the Punic Wars, it was refounded as a Roman townThysdrus's History. and probably received some of Julius Caesar's veterans as settlers in 45BC. Punic culture remained long predominant, with the city minting bronze coins as late as Augustus with Punic inscriptions. Some bore Astarte's head obverse and a lyre reverse; others bore \\"Poseidon\\"'s head obverse and a capricorn reverse. Roman Africa was less arid than modern Tunisia, and Thysdrus and the surrounding lands in Byzacena were an important center of olive oil production and export. Its greatest importance occurred under the Severan dynasty in the late 2nd and early 3rd centuries. Septimius Severus was a native of Roman Africa and bestowed a great deal of imperial favor upon it. He raised Thysdrus to municipality status () with partial Roman citizenship.JSTOR: Thysdrus By the early 3rd century when its huge amphitheater was built, Thysdrus rivaled Hadrumetum (present-day Sousse) as the second city of Roman North Africa, after Carthage (near present-day Tunis). The city had even a huge racetrack ('), nearly as large as the Circus Maximus at Rome and capable of accommodating about 30,000 spectators. In AD238, Thysdrus was at the center of a struggle to control the Roman Empire. After Maximinus Thrax killed Emperor Alexander Severus at Moguntiacum in Germania Inferior and assumed the throne,Potter, pg. 167 his oppressive rule resulted in universal discontent. Maximinus's procurator in Africa, in particular, sought to extract the maximum level of taxation and fines possible, including falsifying charges against the local aristocracy. A riot among the 50,000 Thysdrians ended with the death of the procurator, after which they turned to Gordian and demanded that he accept the dangerous honor of the imperial throne.Southern, pg. 66 After protesting that he was too old for the position, he eventually yielded to the popular clamor of the Thysdrians and assumed both the purple and the epithet ' (\\"the African\\") on March 22.Herodian, 7:5:8 According to Edward Gibbon: Due to his advanced age, he insisted that his son M. Antonius Gordianus be acclaimed as his coruler.Southern, pg. 66 A few days later, Gordian entered the city of Carthage with the overwhelming support of the population and local political leaders.Herodian, 7:6:2 Meanwhile, in Rome, Maximinus's praetorian prefect was assassinated and the rebellion seemed to be successful.Potter, pg. 169 Gordian in the meantime had sent an embassy to Rome under the leadership of P. Licinius ValerianusZosimus, 1:11 to obtain the Senate's support for his rebellion.Potter, pg. 169 Gordian I on a coin, bearing the title AFR, Africanus. The senate confirmed the new emperor on 2 April and many of the provinces gladly sided with Gordian.Potter, pg. 170 Opposition would come from the neighboring province of Numidia.Southern, pg. 67 Its governor Capelianus, a loyal supporter of Maximinus and a stalwart opponent of Gordian,Potter, pg. 170 renewed his alliance to the emperor and invaded the province of Africa with the only legion stationed in the region and other veteran units.Herodian, 7:9:3 GordianII, at the head of a militia army of untrained soldiers mostly from Thysdrus and surroundings, lost the Battle of Carthage and was killed.Potter, pg. 170 Gordian took his own life in his villa near Carthage by hanging himself with his belt. The Gordians had \\"reigned\\" only thirty-six days.Meckler, Gordian I Following this abortive revolt, Capelianus's troops sacked Thysdrus. Thysdrus was subsequently raised to the level of a colony (') by in AD244. It was the seat of a Christian diocese, which is included in the Catholic Church's list of titular sees.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2013, ), p. 992Titular Episcopal See of Thysdrus at GCatholic.org. All the same, it never really recovered. =Later history= Around 695, the Romano-Berber queen Kahina destroyed most of the olive trees of the Thysdrus area in her final attempt to stop the Arab invasion. She made her final stand at the amphitheater, but was defeated. In the next centuries, Thysdrus largely disappeared from the record, with a worsening arid climate apparently damaging its olive oil production. By the 10th century, many of Thysdrus's buildings had been dismantled for use in construction at Kairouan. In the 19th century, French colonizers found only a small village named El Djem, with a few hundred inhabitants living around the remains of the amphitheater and barely eking out enough production from their farms to survive. Buildings The Amphitheatre of El Jem was built around AD238 and it is one of the best preserved stone Roman ruins in the world. It was named a World Heritage Site in 1979.

The avenue is lined on both sides by huge lawns, canals and rows of trees. Considered to be one of the most important roads in India, it is where the annual Republic Day parade takes place on 26 January. Janpath (meaning \\"People's Way\\") crosses the road. Rajpath runs in east-west direction. Roads from Connaught Place, the financial centre of Delhi, run into Rajpath from north. After climbing Raisina Hill, Rajpath is flanked by the North and South Blocks of the Secretariat Building. Finally it ends at the gates of Rashtrapati Bhavan. At Vijay Chowk it crosses Sansad Marg, and the Parliament House of India can be seen to the right when coming from the India Gate. It is also used for the funeral processions of key political leaders of India. The opening scene of the movie Gandhi starts at Rajpath. Name and History In 1911 the British Imperial Government and the Viceregal administration determined that the capital of the British Indian Empire should be moved from Calcutta to Delhi. Accordingly, construction in that year began on the district of New Delhi, which would serve as the purpose-built administrative capital of the Indian Empire. The British Raj duly turned to Sir Edwin Lutyens to construct the new city. Lutyens conceived of a modern imperial city centred around a \\"ceremonial axis\\", such axis being the large boulevard now called the Rajpath. Lutyens wanted a panoramic view of the city of Delhi from the viceregal palace. Consequently, the view from Raisina Hill runs unhindered across Rajpath and the India Gate, and is obstructed only by the National Stadium. Most of the buildings surrounding the Rajpath were designed by Lutyens and the second architect of the project, Sir Herbert Baker. The importance of such buildings in the government of India ensures the road's importance. =Name= When built the road was named King's Way, or Kingsway, in honour of the Emperor of India George V, who had visited Delhi during the Durbar of 1911, and where the Emperor formally proclaimed the decision to move the capital. The name was similar to Kingsway in London, which had been opened in 1905, and which was also a custom-built arterial road, and which had been named in honour of George V's father, Edward VII (as King of the United Kingdom). Following the independence of India the road was bequeathed with its Hindi name, 'Rajpath', in place of its English designation. This represents a mere translation more than a substantial renaming, since 'Rajpath' in Hindi is broadly analogous in meaning to 'King's Way'. Landmarks *The Rashtrapati Bhavan, the official residence of the President of India. It was the Viceroy's residence before India got its independence from Britain. *North Block and South Block, also called the Secretariat Building.

The site was launched on May 1, 1996, created by Pete Deemer, Vince Broady and Jon Epstein. It was purchased by ZDNet, a brand which was later purchased by CNET Networks. CBS Interactive, which purchased CNET Networks in 2008, is the current owner of GameSpot. In addition to the information produced by GameSpot staff, the site also allows users to write their own reviews, blogs, and post on the site's forums. In 2004, GameSpot won \\"Best Gaming Website\\" as chosen by the viewers in Spike TV's second Video Game Award Show, and has won Webby Awards several times. The domain gamespot.com attracted at least 60 million visitors annually by 2008 according to a Compete.com study. History In January 1996, Pete Deemer, Vince Broady and Jon Epstein quit their positions at IDG and founded SpotMedia Communications. SpotMedia then launched GameSpot on May 1, 1996. Originally, GameSpot focused solely on personal computer games, so a sister site, VideoGameSpot, was launched on December 1, 1996. Eventually VideoGameSpot, then renamed VideoGames.com, was merged into GameSpot. In February 1999, PC Magazine named GameSpot one of the hundred-best websites, alongside competitors IGN and CNET Gamecenter. The following year, The New York Times declared GameSpot and Gamecenter the \\"Time and Newsweek of gaming sites\\". On October 3, 2005, GameSpot adopted a new design similar to that of TV.com, now considered a sister site to GameSpot. A new layout change was adopted in October 2013. =International history= GameSpot UK (United Kingdom) was started in October 1997 and operated until mid-2002, offering content that was oriented for the British market that often differed from that of the U.S. site. During this period, GameSpot UK won the 1999 PPAi (Periodical Publishers Association interactive) award for best website, and was short listed in 2001. Following the purchase of ZDNet by CNET, GameSpot UK was merged with the main US site. On April 24, 2006, GameSpot UK was relaunched. In a similar fashion, GameSpot AU (Australia) existed on a local scale in the late 1990s with Australian-produced reviews. It ceased in 2003. When a local version of the main CNET portal, CNET.com.au was launched in 2003, GameSpot.com.au content was folded into CNET.com.au. The site was fully re-launched in mid-2006, with a specialized forum, local reviews, special features, local pricings in Australian dollars, Australian release dates, and more local news. GameSpot Japan in its current form launched in 2007. It provides Japanese video game industry news, previews, reviews, features, and videos as well as translated articles from the other GameSpot sites. =Gerstmann dismissal= Jeff Gerstmann, Editorial Director of the site, was fired on November 28, 2007. Immediately after his termination, rumors circulated proclaiming his dismissal was a result of external pressure from Eidos Interactive, the publisher of Kane & Lynch: Dead Men, which had purchased a considerable amount of advertising space on GameSpot's website. Gerstmann had previously given Kane & Lynch a fair or undesirable rating along with critique. Both GameSpot and parent company CNET stated that his dismissal was unrelated to the review, but due to corporate and legal constraints cannot reveal the reason. A month after Gerstmann's termination, freelance reviewer Frank Provo left GameSpot after eight years stating that \\"I believe CNET management let Jeff go for all the wrong reasons. I believe CNET intends to soften the site's tone and push for higher scores to make advertisers happy.\\" GameSpot staffers Jason Ocampo, Alex Navarro, Ryan Davis, Brad Shoemaker, and Vinny Caravella also left as a result of Gerstmann's termination. Davis co- founded Gerstmann's subsequent project, Giant Bomb, and was later joined by Shoemaker and Caravella. Navarro became the community manager at Harmonix and in 2010 joined up with Whiskey Media, a family of sites that includes Gerstmann's Giant Bomb site, to be part of their new site Screened.com, focusing on cinema and television. Navarro later returned to Giant Bomb, where he currently works as a Senior Editor. On March 15, 2012, it was announced that CBS Interactive, the parent company of GameSpot operator CNET, had acquired the Giant Bomb and Comic Vine websites from Whiskey Media. As part of the deal, the non-disparagement agreement between Gerstmann and CNET was nullified, allowing him to finally speak publicly about his termination over four years prior. Later that evening on GameSpot's On the Spot web show, GameSpot VP John Davison appeared on camera with Gerstmann, marking Gerstmann's first appearance on the GameSpot web site since November 2007. In the segment, Gerstmann revealed that his firing was in fact related to the low review score he had given to Kane & Lynch, though his explanation cited other similar events that led up to the termination, including a 7.5 (good) rating given to Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destruction by Aaron Thomas, then an employee under Gerstmann. =Notable staff= * Greg Kasavin ‚Äì executive editor and site director of GameSpot, who left in 2007 to become a game developer. He became a producer at EA and 2K Games but he is currently working for Supergiant Games as a writer and creative director for Bastion. * Jeff Gerstmann ‚Äì editorial director of the site, dismissed from GameSpot on November 28, 2007 for undisclosed reasons, after which he started Giant Bomb. Following the announcement of the purchase of Giant Bomb by CBS Interactive on March 15, 2012, Jeff was allowed to reveal that he was dismissed by management as a result of publishers threatening to pull advertising revenue due to less- than-glowing review scores being awarded by GameSpots editorial team. Community features =Forums= GameSpots forums were originally run by ZDNet, and later by Lithium. GameSpot uses a semi-automated moderation system with numerous volunteer moderators. GameSpot moderators are picked by paid GameSpot staff from members of the GameSpot user community. Due to the size and massive quantity of boards and posts on GameSpot, there is a \\"report\\" feature where a normal user can report a violation post to an unpaid moderator volunteer. The ostensible purpose of the reporting feature is to deal more quickly with violations of the website's posting policy. GameSpots ToS states that users must be aged 13 or older to post content and maintain an account. Proof of a user's age when he/she creates an account is not required. Proof of a moderator's age is also not required. All users must agree to GameSpots ToS (terms of service) during registration. GameSpots ToS (as they apply to the community forums) give moderators the power to use their own discretion when deciding if a posting violation has occurred. In addition to the message board system, GameSpot has expanded its community through the addition of features such as user blogs (formerly known as \\"journals\\") and user video blogs. Users can track other users, thus allowing them to see updates for their favorite blogs. If both users track each other, they are listed on each other's friends list. Paid subscriptions GameSpot formerly had a paid subscription service known as \\"GameSpot Complete\\". On February 21, 2006, the paid subscription model was changed. It now maintains two paid membership services: Total Access and Plus. Total Access is essentially a replacement of GameSpot Complete, as it is the same price of US$5.95 per month or $39.95 per year and offers the same basic benefits. The second premium service, GameSpot Plus, is a cheaper, intermediate-level service. On January 9, 2013, it was announced that the Paid Subscription model would no longer be accepting new subscribers, and current subscribers would not be able to renew after January 31, 2013.

That is, two sentences are equivalent if the theory T proves that each implies the other. The Lindenbaum‚ÄìTarski algebra is thus the quotient algebra obtained by factoring the algebra of formulas by this congruence relation. The algebra is named for logicians Adolf Lindenbaum and Alfred Tarski. It was first introduced by Tarski in 1935 as a device to establish correspondence between classical propositional calculus and Boolean algebras. The Lindenbaum‚ÄìTarski algebra is considered the origin of the modern algebraic logic.; here: pages 1-2  Operations  The operations in a Lindenbaum‚ÄìTarski algebra A are inherited from those in the underlying theory T. These typically include conjunction and disjunction, which are well-defined on the equivalence classes. When negation is also present in T, then A is a Boolean algebra, provided the logic is classical. If the theory T consists of the propositional tautologies, the Lindenbaum‚ÄìTarski algebra is the free Boolean algebra generated by the propositional variables.  Related algebras  Heyting algebras and interior algebras are the Lindenbaum‚ÄìTarski algebras for intuitionistic logic and the modal logic S4, respectively. A logic for which Tarski's method is applicable, is called algebraizable. There are however a number of logics where this is not the case, for instance the modal logics S1, S2, or S3, which lack the rule of necessitation (‚ä¢œÜ implying ‚ä¢‚ñ°œÜ), so ~ (defined above) is not a congruence (because ‚ä¢œÜ‚Üíœà does not imply ‚ä¢‚ñ°œÜ‚Üí‚ñ°œà). Another type of logics where Tarski's method is inapplicable are relevance logics, because given two theorems an implication from one to the other may not itself be a theorem in a relevance logic. The study of the algebraization process (and notion) as topic of interest by itself, not necessarily by Tarski's method, has led to the development of abstract algebraic logic.

The oval atoll is long and wide. The lagoon is up to deep and has an area of . The land area of the two islets (Cemit√©rio Island, southwest and Farol Cay, northwest) is . Farol Cay accounts for almost two-thirds of the aggregate area. The highest point is a sand dune in the south of larger Farol Cay, with a height of . Both islets are overgrown with grasses, bushes and a few palm trees. The population consists of crabs, spiders, scorpions, sand fleas, beetles, large roaches, and many species of birds. There is a lighthouse of the Brazilian Navy that has been in operation and maintained since the 1960s, at the Northern end of Farol Bay. In its vicinity is a derelict lighthouse from 1933. The atoll is a wildlife sanctuary, and in 2001 was designated by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. Numerous turtles, sharks, dolphins and birds live in the area. The atoll consists mainly of coral and red algae. The coral ring is almost closed, with a wide channel on the north side and a much narrower channel on the west side. The atoll and surrounding waters are contained in the Atol das Rocas Biological Reserve. The reserve it is currently used solely for scientific research. Due to their remote location, the islands remain largely undisturbed by human activities.

It is sometimes anglicised as \\"curragh\\". The construction and design of the currach are unique to the west coasts of Ireland. It is referred to as a naomh√≥g ( in counties Cork, Waterford and Kerry and as a \\"canoe\\" in West Clare. It is similar to the Welsh coracle, though the two originated independently. The plank-built rowing boat found on the west coast of Connacht is also called a currach or curach adhmaid (\\"wooden currach\\"), and is built in a style very similar to its canvas-covered relative. Folk etymology has it that naomh√≥g means \\"little holy one\\", \\"little female saint\\", from naomh () \\"saint, holy\\" and the feminine diminutive suffix -√≥g). Another explanation is that it comes from the Latin navis, and it has also been suggested that it derives from the Irish nae, a boat.Ua Maoileoin, p. 143.) A larger version of this is known simply as a b√°d iomartha (rowing boat). It is suggested that the prototype of this wooden boat was built on Inishnee around 1900 and based upon a tender from a foreign vessel seen in Cleggan harbour. These wooden boats progressively supplanted the canvas currach as a workboat around the Connemara coast.Mac an Iomaire (2000), Annotation by translator Padraic de Bhaldraithe p. 37 This rowing currach measured up to 20 feet, and is still seen in water in North Donegal. The currach has traditionally been both a sea boat and a vessel for inland waters. The River currach was especially well known for its shallow-draft and maneuverability. Its framework was constructed of hazel rods and Sally twigs, which was covered by a single ox-hide, which not only insulated the currach, but also helped dictate its shape. These currach were common on the rivers of South Wales, and were often referred to as Boyne currach. However, when Ireland declared the netting of salmon and other freshwater fish illegal in 1948, its once common appearance quickly dwindled. History Reconstruction of a 1 AD skin-covered boat on the Great Ouse in Bedford During the Neolithic period, the first settlers landed in the northern part of Ireland, likely arriving in boats that were the ancestors of the currach. Development in joining methods of wood during the Neolithic period made it possible to eventually create what the currach is today. Hide-covered basket origins are evident in currachs found in the east of Ireland, and using the skins for lining currachs in the Neolithic period likely was how the early Irish were able to make their way over to the British Isles. The currach represents one of two traditions of boat and shipbuilding in Ireland: the skin-covered vessel and the wooden vessel. The flimsy construction of the former makes it unlikely that any remains would be available for the marine archaeologist, but its antiquity is clear from written sources. One of these is the Latin account of the voyage of St Brendan (who was born c. 484 in the southwest of Ireland): Navigatio sancti Brendani abbatis. This contains an account of the building of an ocean-going boat: using iron tools, the monks made a thin-sided and wooden- ribbed vessel sicut mos est in illis partibus (‚Äúas the custom is in those parts‚Äù), covering it with hides cured with oak bark. Tar was used to seal the places where the skins joined. A mast was then erected in the middle of the vessel and a sail supplied.Navigatio sancti Brendani abbatis, cap. IV: http://www.hs-augsburg.de/~harsch/Chronologia/Lspost10/Brendanus/bre_navi.html Though the voyage itself is essentially a wonder-tale, it is implied that the vessel as described was built in accordance with ordinary practice at the time. An Irish martyrology of the same period says of the Isle of Aran that the boat commonly used there was made of wickerwork and covered with cowhide.Quoted in Hornell (1977), p. 17: Erat enim in istis partibus, eo aevo, quoddam navigii genus usitatum, ex viminibus contextum, et bovinis coriis contectum; quad Scotica lingua Curach appellatur. Gerald of Wales, in his Topographia Hibernica (1187), relates that he was told by certain seamen that, having taken refuge from a storm off the coast of Connacht, they saw two men, long-haired and scantily clad, approaching in a slender wickerwork boat covered in skins. The crew found that the two spoke Irish and took them on board, whereupon they expressed amazement, never before having seen a large wooden ship.Topographia Hibernica, Dist. III, Cap. XXVI: http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/index_latin.html. A translation can be found at: http://www.yorku.ca/inpar/topography_ireland.pdf. The Latin passage, of great ethnological interest, is as follows: Audivi enim a navibus quibusdam, quod cum quadrogesimali quodam tempore ad boreales et inexscrutabiles Connactici maris vastitates vi tempestatis depulsi fuissent, tandem sub insula quadam modica se receperunt: ubi et anchorarum morsu, funiumque triplicium, immo multiplicium tenacitate se vix retinuerent. Residente vero infra triduum tempestate, et restituta tam eari serenititae quam mari tranquillitate, apparuit non procul facies terrae cujusdam, eis hactenus prorsus ignotae; de qua non longe post et cymbulam modicam ad se viderunt remigantem, arctam et oblongam, vimineam quidem, et coriis animalium extra contextam et consutam. Erant autem in ea homines duo, nudis omnino corporibus, praeter zonas latas de crudis animalium coriis quibus stringebantur. Habebant etiam Hibernico more comas perlongas et flavas, trans humeros deorsum, corpus ex magna parte tegentes. De quibus cum audissent, quod de quadam Connactiae parte fuissent, et Hibernica lingua loquerentur, intra navem eos adduxerunt. Ipsi vero cuncta quae ibi videbant tanquam nova admirari coeperunt. Navem enim magnam et ligneam, humanos etiam cultus, sicut asserebant, nunquam antes viderant.. The consistency in accounts from the early Middle Ages to the early modern period makes it likely that the construction and design of the currach underwent no fundamental change in the interval. A 17th-century account in Latin by Philip O'Sullivan Beare of the Elizabethan wars in Ireland includes a description of two currachs built in haste to cross the River Shannon. The larger was constructed as follows: two rows of osiers were thrust in the ground opposite each other, the upper ends being bent in to each other (ad medium invicem reflexa) and tied with cords, whereupon the frame so made was turned upside down. Planks, seats and thwarts were then fitted inside (cui e solida tabula, statumina, transtraque interius adduntur), horse hide was fixed to the exterior and oars with rowlocks were supplied. This vessel is described as being able to carry 30 armed men at a time.O'Sullivan-Beare, Philip, Historia catholicae Iberniae compendium, Tom III., Cap IX: https://archive.org/stream/MN42000ucmf_1/MN42000ucmf_1_djvu.txt (though there are a number of errors in the transcription). For a translation of the work, see http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100060/index.html. =Relationship with the coracle= The currach bears a close resemblance to the coracle, a similar circular rowboat used in Wales, and to the wide family of circular boats termed \\"coracles\\" common throughout South and Southeast Asia. These non-Irish coracles all ultimately trace their origin to the quffa, a round Iraqi riverboat dating to the 9th century BCE, or possibly even as early as the 2nd millennium BCE. The resemblances between the currach and the coracle and quffa are a coincidence. However. British ethnologist James Hornell, who studied the currach, coracle, and quffa extensively during the early 20th century, believes that the currach was developed independently of the coracle and quffa in a case of multiple invention.Hornell (1939), pp. 13  Sea-going currachs, c. 17th century  Captain Thomas Phillips - currach The construction and sailing of a seagoing curach of the 17th century ‚Äì a hybrid of the skin- covered and plank-built boat ‚Äì was depicted in some detail by an Englishman, Captain Thomas Phillips: \\"A portable vessel of wicker ordinarily used by the Wild Irish\\".This is preserved in the Pepysian Library, Cambridge. See the discussion by Nance, R. Morton, \\"Wicker Vessels,‚Äù The Mariner's Mirror, July 1922 Though doubt has been cast on the accuracy of these sketches,Hornell (1977), pp. 35 ‚Äì 36 they are detailed and represent a valid development of the ocean-going currach. The vessel is some twenty feet long: it possesses a keel and a rudder, with a wickerwork hull stiffened by ribs, and with a mast amidship. Because of the keel, the craft is shown as being constructed from the bottom up. A covering (presumably of animal hides) was added when the wickerwork was complete, the sides being supported by rods in the interval. The mast is supported by stays and by double shrouds on each side, the latter descending to an external shelf functioning as a chainwale. The forestay is shown as passing over a small fork above the yardarm, which supports a square sail: a branch is tied to the mast-top. The stern is surmounted by double half-hoops which could support a covering. The sketches by Phillips imply that such a vessel was common in his day. The keel would improve the handling of the boatSee Ua Maoileoin, pp. 141‚Äì142, on the difficulty of tacking in a keel- less modern currach: Ar a tosach a choime√°d sa bhfarraige agus gan √≠ a ligeant i leith a cliath√°in uirthi, is maith an bl√©itse farraige a chuirfeadh s√≠os √≠. Agus t√° iompar seoil inti n√° cuirfe√° f√©na tuairim in aon chor, ach aon n√≠ amh√°in, gan aon chille a bheith f√∫ithi agus nach f√©idir aon bhord√°il, puinn, a dh√©anamh l√©i ach roimis an ngaoith i gc√≥na√≠ agus √≠ ag imeacht leathchliath√°nach... but the hull would remain flexible.  The modern Irish currach  Currachs in general adhere to a plan designed to produce a sturdy, light and versatile vessel. The framework consists of latticework formed of rib-frames (\\"hoops\\") and stringers (longitudinal slats), surmounted by a gunwale. There are stem and stern posts, but no keel. Thwarts are fitted, with knees supplied as required. Cleats or thole pins are fitted for the oars, and there may be a mast and sail, though with a minimum of rigging. The outside of the hull is covered by tarred canvas or calico, a substitute for animal hide. Currachs were used in the modern period for fishing, for ferrying and for the transport of goods and livestock, including sheep and cattle.Tyers (ed.), pp. 94 ‚Äì 95: Se√°n √ì Criomhthain describing how the feet of cattle were secured to keep them subdued in transit: Chaithfe√° iad seo a leagadh agus na ceithre cosa a cheangal d√° ch√©ile, agus a fhios a bheith agat conas a cheangl√≥f√° leis iad, agus t√©ad√°n maith a bheith agat. Iad a bhualadh isteach ansin sa naomh√≥g, agus, m√° ch√≠fe√° aon bhogadh ag na cosa √° dh√©anamh, teacht agus an cup√°n, √°ras at√° ag lean√∫int na naomh√≥ige, a chur anuas don uisce, agus c√∫pla maith uisce a dhoirteadh anuas ar an t√©ad, agus d'fh√°iscfeadh s√© sin go maith ar a ch√©ile iad. Use of the currach was not continuous or universal along the Atlantic coast. In the modern period it did not reach Kerry (in the southwest of Ireland) until the late 19th century (c. 1880). Until then the only vessel used was the heavy wooden seine boat, which required eight men to row it.Ua Maoileoin, p.140 ‚Äì 146 The Blasket Islanders found the currach (or naomh√≥g) particularly useful,Tyers (ed.) pp. 29 ‚Äì 30 and a distinctive regional type developed. = Oldbridge = The Irish River Currach is still being built in Oldbridge at river Boyne. Currachs produced here follow the same general construction process as many other Currach styles but in Boyne they implement the use of tarred canvas as the outer layer. = Donegal = Detailed plans are available for Donegal currachs. The Donegal Sea Currach is very similar to the Boyne Currach in construction and style although the two are produced on opposite coasts from each other. The Donegal Sea Currach is the last traditional Irish craft to use the free paddle instead of the traditional oar. = Mayo = South Mayo currachs differ from most other currach types in that, instead of the stringers which elsewhere run outside the latticework frame, the bottom and sides are covered with a thin planking. In Achill Island the currach is built with double gunwales.Hornell (1977), pp. 5 ‚Äì 13 = Connemara and the Islands = The Connemara currach is also distinguished by a double gunwale and by a particular form of pivoting block or \\"bull\\" attached to one side of the squared region of the loom of the oar. The Aran islanders, like the Blasket islanders further south, were assiduous users of the curach. Unusually for the area a sail was used, though without shrouds or stays. Apart from the halliard, the only ropes were the tack, led to a point near the stem, and the sheet, carried aft and secured to the last thwart.Hornell (1977), pp. 13 ‚Äì 23 Currach races remain popular. In the mid-1950s and early 1960s the Seoighe cousins excelled by winning many county and All Ireland championships, including three in a row of the latter. = Clare = The Clare currach closely resembled that of the Aran Islands. In construction, a series of wooden markers were sunk into the ground at definite distances apart. These helped show the width desired for the lower gunwale frame. This was constructed first, followed by the upper frame, and the thwarts were then nailed into place.Hornell (1977), pp. 24 ‚Äì 28 = Shannon = Currachs covered in cowhide were still common in the 1840s above Lough Ree, in the centre of Ireland. Thereafter they disappeared except at the seaward end of the Shannon Estuary.Hornell (1977), pp. 28 ‚Äì 29 = Kerry = Kerry currachs had a reputation for elegance and speed. All were fitted for sailing, with a short mast without shrouds stepped in a socket in a short mast shoe. The halliard was rove through an iron ring near the masthead, hoisting a small lug sail, and this was controlled by a sheet and tack. When under sail lee-boards might be employed.Hornell (1977), pp. 29 ‚Äì 35  Currach builders  A model representing St Brendan's currach Currently there are few full-time currach builders. A notable exception are Meitheal Mara, who build currachs and train in currach building in Cork. They also organise currach-racing. There has been a community-based enterprise in West Clare since 2005 called West Clare Currachs, with support from James Madigan of the Ilen School, Limerick. LNBHA, a community group on Lough Neagh, has made a number of Kerry naomh√≥gs and Dunfanaghy and Tory Island currachs. In other counties on the western seaboard there are boat builders who sometimes make currachs.  Scottish currachs  The traditional Scottish currach is nearly extinct, but there are occasional recreations. It is known to have been in use on the River Spey, in the north east, and also in the Hebrides. = St Columba = St Columba is said to have used a currach. :\\"On a day, at the end of two years from his arrival on Iona, Columba goes to the beach, where his craft of wicker and cowhide lies moored, waiting the use of any member of the community of Hy whose occasions may call him away from the island. He is accompanied by two friends and former fellow- students, Comgal and Cainnech, and followed by a little escort of faithful attendants. Taking his seat in his currach, he and his party are rowed across the sound to the mainland.\\"Quoted in Wylie St Beccan of R√πm may have lived on the island for four decades from 632 AD, his death being recorded in the Annals of Ulster in 677.Rixson (2001) op cit pages 21 ‚Äì 25. He wrote of Columba: :In scores of curraghs with an army of wretches he crossed the long- haired sea. :He crossed the wave-strewn wild region, :Foam flecked, seal- filled, savage, bounding, seething, white-tipped, pleasing, doleful.\\"Tiugraind Beccain\\" in Clancy, T.O. and Markus, G. eds. (1995) Iona- The Earliest Poetry of A Celtic Monastery, quoted by Rixson (2001) op cit page 25. Currachs in the River Spey In the Statistical Account of Scotland of 1795 we read of :\\"[a] man, sitting in what was called a Currach, made of hide, in the shape, and about the size of a small brewing-kettle, broader above than below, with ribs or hoops of wood in the inside, and a cross-stick for the man to sit on. . . . These currachs were so light, that the men carried them on their backs home from Speymouth.\\" The Spey currach would thus seem to be similar to the Welsh coracle in design, being used on a river rather than in the open sea. But twenty years earlier, we read of bigger ones, in Shaw's History of the Province of Moray (1775): :\\"Let me add, as now become a Rarity, the Courach. . . . It is in shape oval, near three feet broad, and four long.\\" A more detailed description can be found in Scottish court records (1780): :\\"The currach contained only one man in working it, whereas the floats require two men and oars; and the man in the currach paddled with a shovel, one end of the rope being fixed to the raft, and the other tied to the man's knee in the currach, which he let loose when there was any danger, the currach going before the raft.\\" Spey currachs were used in the timber trade there, as described in Ainslie's Pilgrimage etc. (1822): :\\"The river taking a sudden bend, broadened and deepened into a wheel, on the breast of which a salmon cobble, or currach swam. :\\"Hence curracher, a man who sat in a currach and guided floating timbers down the Spey.\\" These may have survived into twentieth century; there is a reference to a \\"currick\\" in the Banffshire Journal (1926).  Current use as racing boats  Currachs survive now as racing boats, often holding their own against much more modern types. In the annual London Great River Race,The Great River Race every September covers 21 miles (34 km) from Millwall in the Docklands up to Richmond; for the faster boats, it usually takes about three hours to row with the tide. It is open to every kind of rowed or paddled boat, from skiffs up to row-barges and dragon-boats, and currently (2012) attracts over 300 entrants. Currachs have regularly performed outstandingly in the Overall rankings (fastest boat on handicap), notably in 2007,2007 results 3rd overall: Coonagh Crew, a Clare Fishing Currach (3 hd) 2008,2008 results 1st overall: The Sin Bin, a Connemara Currach (3 hd) and 2010.2010 results 2nd overall: Leaper, a Racing Naomh√≥g (4 hd) A currach entered the inaugural Race to Alaska in 2015. The West Kerry naomh√≥g, with two Canadian crew members, attempted the 1200 kilometer no-motor trip up the Inside Passage from Port Townsend, WA, to Ketchikan, AK. Currach races are also performed at the Milwaukee Irish Fest. This event is held by the Irish Currach Club of Milwaukee in late August of every year and it features two races that are available for the public to view during the festival.

Legend According to urban legend, the Goatman is an ax-wielding half-animal, half-man creature that was once a scientist who worked in the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center. The tale holds that he was experimenting on goats until one experiment backfired, and he was mutated, becoming goat-like himself. He then began attacking cars with an axe, roaming the back roads of Beltsville, Maryland. A variation of the legend tells of the Goat-man as an old hermit who lives in the woods, seen walking alone at night along Fletchertown Road. According to University of Maryland folklorist Barry Pearson, the Goatman legends began \\"long, long, long\\" ago and were further popularized in 1971 when the death of a dog was blamed on the Goatman by local residents. Pearson says \\"bored teenagers\\" keep the Goatman legend alive by repeating the story and suggesting that the creature attacks couples frequenting the local lover's lane, subsequently stirring interest in sites like Fletchertown Road.

Early life Corning was born in Norwich, Connecticut, the son of Bliss Corning. Corning moved to Troy, New York at the age of 13 to clerk in the hardware store of an uncle; six years later he moved to Albany, New York, where he joined the mercantile business under James Spencer. After some time at Spencer's firm, Corning became a partner, and eventually the senior partner upon Spencer's death in 1824. Corning combined the Spencer firm with holdings he inherited from his uncle to form Erastus Corning & Co. John V. L. Pruyn was married to Harriet Corning Turner (June 18, 1822 ‚Äì March 22, 1859), who was Erastus Corning's niece. As a result of this family connection, Corning and Pruyn were often partners in Corning's businesses and investments. Erastus Corning & Co. Erastus Corning & Co. bought and sold all manner of iron products, including tools, nails, stoves, farming implements, and eventually railroad track rails and railroad car parts. The company had a wharf and warehouse on the Hudson River in Albany, and the store itself served not only Albany and the surrounding towns, but hundreds of large customers from the west who visited Albany only two or three times a year to buy and sell products, restock their own supplies, and see what new was for sale. Corning's hardware store soon became one of the most significant businesses in Albany. Corning also invested in banks and insurance companies. He purchased the Albany Rolling and Slitting Mill, renamed it the Albany Nail Factory, and used it to corner the market on numerous iron products he sold at his store. The Albany Nail Factory eventually became the Rensselaer Iron Works, which under Corning's guidance installed the first Bessemer converter in the United States. By the time he was 40, Corning had helped found the Albany State Bank (he would serve as president until his death), been named to the board of regents for the University of the State of New York, begun speculating on land in western New York (including the townsite that bears his name), and had been elected mayor of Albany. Corning served a single term as mayor, from 1834 until 1837, having been elected as a Democrat. Railroads Erastus Corning's most lasting contribution to history may have been his dealings with railroads. As an iron dealer, he very quickly saw the potential that railroads had as an economic engine as both a consumer and distributor of his products, and took an interest from the very start. When the Utica and Schenectady Railroad was chartered in 1833, Corning got himself a seat on the board and became a major investor, and was soon president of the road. Corning ran the Utica & Schenectady for twenty years. The railroad eventually boasted of track, from Schenectady in the east (where the road interchanged with the smaller Mohawk and Hudson Railroad of which Corning was also a shareholder) to Utica in the west. In 1851, the road's name was changed to the Mohawk Valley Railroad. Corning was not satisfied with just his railroad, banking, insurance, land speculation, and iron works interests, however. He remained active in politics, and was a member of the New York State Senate from 1842 to 1845, sitting in the 65th, 66th, 67th and 68th New York State Legislatures. His foray into state politics convinced him that the current system of railroads stretching across upstate New York was inefficient and could be made far more profitable by combining them. He began planning what would eventually become the largest corporation in America at the time, the New York Central. As president of the Utica & Schenectady, Corning organized in 1851 a convention of the owners and presidents of the other eight operating railroads, which combined roughly connected the cities of Albany and Buffalo, New York. The convention agreed on a framework for consolidation of the eight roads (as well as two \\"paper\\" roads, which had not yet been built but were planned), and Corning took the convention's application to the state Legislature. Corning became the main lobbyist for the proposal in the legislature, and despite being a Democrat made a personal appeal to Thurlow Weed, leader of the Whigs, who controlled state government at the time. Corning had a lot riding on the legislature's decision. He had organized the convention and largely dictated the terms of the merger to the other companies. Once the legislature passed the Consolidation Act on April 2, 1853, Corning found himself in possession of the majority of shares in the new company, and so at the first meeting of the New York Central's shareholders in 1853, Corning got himself elected president of the company. He remained in that role for twelve years, during which time the New York Central made connections and struck deals that gave the road access to Cleveland, Boston, New York City, and Chicago, and made it one of the country's most important railroads. Corning amassed a significant fortune, and used it to invest in land schemes as far west as Wisconsin and Iowa. He bought large shares in the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad and the Michigan Central Railroad, and was the largest shareholder in and president of the St. Mary's Falls Ship Canal Company, which constructed the canal and locks on the St. Mary's River at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, connecting Lake Superior with Lake Huron. For this the company received 750,000 acres (3035 km¬≤) of land in the west; Corning himself took 100,000 acres (400 km¬≤) of this. Hon. Erastus Corning Civil War politics In 1856, shortly after finishing the St. Mary's River project, Corning was elected as a Democrat to the 35th, 37th and 38th United States Congresses, serving from March 4, 1857, to March 3, 1859, and from March 4, 1861, to October 5, 1863, when he resigned. He was a delegate to the 1860 Democratic National Convention. In 1861, before taking office in Congress, he was a delegate to the Peace Congress in Washington, D.C., but once the Civil War began he took his seat in Congress and, at least initially, supported the Abraham Lincoln Administration. He resigned his seat in October 1863 because of failing health and disagreements with the administration over prosecution of the Civil War. In February 1863, he was the Democratic caucus nominee for U.S. Senator from New York, but was defeated by Republican Edwin D. Morgan. Back home in Albany, Corning organized a public meeting on the war, which resulted in a formal letter sent to President Lincoln under Corning's hand, offering support for maintaining the integrity of the Union, but censuring the administration for certain tactics it was employing in the war, most notably the making of military arrests of civilians in New York accused of avoiding service. This incident is notable for the response it generated from Lincoln, a lengthy letter wherein the president sets out his views on what the Constitution allowed him to do in wartime. Despite his disagreements with Lincoln's handling of the war, Corning fully supported the effort to maintain the Union. The United States Navy contracted with Corning's iron works to manufacture parts and materials for the USS Monitor, the Navy's first ironclad warship. Later years Corning's personal papers make little reference to the nature of his ill health, but from his retirement on, Corning slowly began reducing his commitments and public activities. Through the 1860s he began to focus more on land speculation and less on his business holdings. He resigned from the New York Central in 1865, two years before the railroad was bought out by Cornelius Vanderbilt. In 1867, Corning was a delegate to the New York State Constitutional Convention. It was his last public office. By 1871, Corning had passed control of his business interests on to his sons and close associates, and at one point passed up the opportunity to buy a share in a new land deal in Nebraska, saying that \\"I find that my health is such that it will not do for me to take hold of any new undertaking.\\" He remained on the board of the Albany State Bank, and also continued as vice chancellor of the board of regents of the University of the State of New York, positions he had held by that time for over 30 years. He died at home in Albany on April 8, 1872. He was buried at Albany Rural Cemetery. Corning's grandsons Edwin and Parker Corning both held various political positions in the state of New York in the early 1900s. His great-grandson, Erastus Corning 2nd, was mayor of Albany for over 40 years, from 1941 to 1983. The Rensselaer Iron Works eventually became part of the larger Troy Iron & Steel Company, in its time the largest iron and steel manufacturer in the United States, but the company eventually went out of business. The New York Central remained one of the most significant American railroads through the end of the 19th Century; it was eventually merged with its arch-rival, the Pennsylvania Railroad, and ultimately became a part of Conrail in the 1970s. Parts of the New York Central, including parts of the original Utica & Schenectady, are still in use today by CSX. The locks on the St. Mary's River remain the busiest locks in the world. Erastus Corning's personal papers, almost 50,000 pages worth, are held by the libraries of Cornell University.

Originally a group of five members, with lead vocalist Izumi Sakai as its only constant member. Zard's work was sold under the record label B-Gram Records, Inc. Their most popular and successful songs are , , and \\"My Friend\\" (1996). As of 2014, Zard has sold over 37 million records, making them one of the best-selling music artists in Japan. Career Zard began when the former CEO of Being Corporation, Daik≈ç Nagato, recruited a 24-year-old model named Sachiko Kamachi. Changing her name to Izumi Sakai in an attempt to cut off her past, she created a group called Zard. Zard made a breakthrough with the release of their debut single February 10, 1991 Good-bye My Loneliness, which was a theme song for the Fuji TV drama \\"Ideals and Reality of Marriage\\" featuring Misako Tanaka. The song was very successful, reaching No. 9 in the Oricon rankings. Zard's next two singles did not sell as well. The fourth, took a slightly different approach. The group's rock style had morphed to popular while the seemingly dark music videos turned to a relatively brighter image. In fact, half of Zard's official appearances on TV were related to performing this song, which sold 440,000 copies. At that time, Music Station host Kazuyoshi Morita (aka Tamori) asked Sakai what took Zard so long to be on stage. Sakai's reply was that they wanted to make sure Zard would be an economically viable project and hence did not want to go public prematurely. The major breakthrough for Zard came with the sixth single in 1993, \\"Makenaide\\", which became No. 1 in the Oricon charts and went on to sell over 1.8 million copies. She went on to release two more songs that reached No. 1, \\"Yureru Omoi\\" and \\"Kitto Wasurenai\\" in the same year. An album titled \\"Yureru Omoi\\" featuring both \\"Makenaide\\" and \\"Yureru Omoi\\" sold two million copies, the first million milestone for Zard in album sales. In fact, Being was so successful in the early 1990s that it was called Being Boom. No one sold more CDs than Zard in this year. In 1995, Zard sold one more million hit, \\"My Friend\\". Although her sales fluctuated among six digits in sales for the remainder of the twentieth century, nine of twenty-one singles reached No. 1 and six reached No. 2. Only two could not break the top four mark. Since she also sold three hits of one million and one other of two million copies. On August 31, 1999, Zard held their first concert aboard cruise ship Pacific Venus, where six hundred people were randomly selected out of a million applicants. The DVD for this concert, released on January 26, 2000, had a limited production of 300,000 copies. Sakai was also a very prolific lyricist. She wrote 150 songs during her 17-year career (numerous songs for other artists as well as all of the Zard songs except for two, and from their first album, Good-bye My Loneliness, which was written by Daria Kawashima,Good-bye My Loneliness album notes) and released several books of poetry as well. An editorial in Asahi Shimbun writes that the secret to Zard's success was that while the trend in Japan showed a decrease in the number of music programs on television, Zard used late night commercials that aired her voice to advertise her works. She also wrote songs for other artists, most notably for the J-pop groups that shared her management company: Field of View, Wands and Deen, and the late mainland Taiwanese singer Teresa Teng. She also wrote the lyrics for and participated in the collaboration for the single featuring J-pop groups Zard, Zyyg, Rev & Wands. The single also featured famed Japanese baseball hero Shigeo Nagashima. Some of her singles were used in anime, such as Slam Dunk, Dragon Ball GT and Detective Conan. The lyrics of by Field of View, the opening theme song of Dragon Ball GT, is by Izumi Sakai. Afterward, Zard covered this song in Today Is Another Day album. Zard's most successful single, has been used as a theme song for Nippon Television program 24-hour TV, an annual Japanese television programming in which a celebrity host is on screen continually for a whole day. Sakai said that she was honored and looked forward to watching 24-hour TV. She also said that since Makenaide was widely appreciated by the public, she often felt as if that song was not hers to keep. Zard was also known for being mysterious. This is partially because her record label did not release too much personal information on their artists, and also because she did not make that many personal appearances. She rarely appeared on any live TV music programs (e.g. TV Asahi's Music Station), which the main public relations tool for the record industry in Japan, since 1993 or do any public appearances. Her first concert was in 1999, this being held on a cruise ship for a mere 600 people in her fan club (300 entries x2 among 2 million concert ticket requests). Her first real concert tour, \\"What A Beautiful Moment Tour\\", was held in 2004, 13 years after her debut. Almost every single concert was sold out at the time. The tour ended up having 10 concerts spanning 4 months from March to July 2004, with a final concert held in the famed Nippon Budokan. Although originally Zard is a group, Zard was frequently regarded as a solo female singer in Japan. She used to hold a female record in Japan for most single sales until Ayumi Hamasaki released \\"No Way to Say\\". According to Yomiuri Shimbun, as of August 2007, Zard was No. 8 for overall total in Japan. She has had 11 singles reach the No. 1 spot on the Oricon Singles Charts, and 9 albums reach the No. 1 spot on the Oricon Album Charts. 40 of her singles reached top 10 in Oricon ranking. Zard has released a total of 42 singles and 17 albums. Zard was also featured in Tak Matsumoto's Ihoujin (August 27, 2003). The single was later included in the cover album The Hit Parade produced by Tak Matsumoto. On a trivial note, Zard's album \\"Oh My Love\\" released in 1994 reached No. 1 for the 500th edition of the Oricon Rankings since it began in 1970. She has had 11 singles reach the No. 1 spot on the Oricon. = Post-Izumi Sakai Zard = An album based on fan request was released on January 23, 2008, titled Zard Request Best: Beautiful Memory. NTV Morning News program, Zoom In Super's December 28, 2007 reports that over 500,000 entries were mailed to Being. Surprisingly, Makenaide and Yureru Omoi were not in the top 3, though they made the top 10. The three most voted songs were 1) Ano Hohoemi o Wasurenaide, 2) Shoujo no Koro ni Modotta Mitai ni, 3) Kakegae no Naimono. When this album hit number one in the Oricon charts, it marked the eleventh time she had done so, matching the record held by Dreams Come True for the most number ones by female vocal groups.  Sakai's death  Fans of Izumi Sakai writing messages for her to the signature notebooks in Zard's agency on May 31, 2007. Founding member Izumi Sakai died on May 27, 2007 at the age of 40 in Keio University Hospital. She entered the hospital in June 2006 after discovering she had cervical cancer and had the tumor removed. In April 2007, however, the cancer had spread to her lungs, resulting in her re-admittance to hospital. According to the hospital, she took daily walks every morning. During her walk on May 26, she accidentally fell from the stairs and was discovered at around 5:00 a.m. JST. She was sent to the emergency room, but she died upon arrival.Female pop star Zard dies after fall An agency spokesman said: She had planned to release a new album in the fall, as well as her first live tour in three years to show her fans that she was fighting strongly against her illnesses. A memorial service for fans was held on June 27 in a funeral hall in Aoyama, Tokyo. On the previous day, a memorial service for the people concerned was held and Maki Ohguro and Tetsuro Oda etc. attended at this. At the same time, Tak Matsumoto and Koshi Inaba of B'z, Mai Kuraki and Shigeo Nagashima announced memorial comments for her.Èï∑Â∂ãËåÇÈõÑÂêçË™âÁõ£Áù£„ÄÅB'z„ÄÅÂÄâÊú®„Çâ„Åå„ÄÅÂùÇ‰∫ï„Åï„Çì„Å´ËøΩÊÇº„Ç≥„É°„É≥„Éà News -Oricon Style- Two compilation albums were planned for release on August 15, one that includes a selection of Sakai's personal favorite songs, the other that includes favorites from her staff.

The two places were chosen because they were the first and last stops respectively of the What a beautiful moment Tour in 2004--the only tour that band has gone on. The tour was called \\"What a Beautiful Memory\\". In September 2007, an audience of 13,000 participated in a memorial Budokan concert.

The Khanate existed in the 15th and 16th centuries in the area adjacent to the mouth of the Volga river, around the modern city of Astrakhan. Its khans claimed patrilineal descent from Toqa Tem√ºr,Welsford 2012, p. 37. the thirteenth son of Jochi and grandson of Genghis Khan. Mahmud bin K√ºch√ºk established the Khanate in the 1460s. The capital was the city of Xacitarxan, also known as Astrakhan in Russian chronicles. Its territory included the Lower Volga valley and the Volga Delta, including most of what is now Astrakhan Oblast and the steppeland on the right bank of Volga in present-day Kalmykia. To the south was the Caspian sea, to the east the Nogai Horde, and to the west Nogais who were theoretically subjects of the Crimean Khanate. Before the Khanate The area was a natural center since it was the intersection of the north-south trade route down the Volga to Persia and the east-west trade route north of the Caspian. From the 6th century it was populated by various Turkic-speaking tribes. They formed two states: Old Great Bulgaria (c. 632-668) and the Khazars (c. 650-969). Following the Mongol conquest the western steppe broke off and became the Golden Horde (c. 1240-1502). In the fifteenth century parts of the Horde broke off as follows: 1438: Khanate of Kazan, 1441: Khanate of Crimea, 1466: Astrakhan, 1480: Russia. The steppe remnant ended in 1502 and steppe peoples around Astrakhan became the Nogai Horde. Demography and society Most of the population of the Astrakhan khanate were Astrakhan Tatars and Nogays. Merchants carried on a transit trade between Muscovy, Kazan, Crimea, Central Asia, and the Transcaucasus region. The nobility consisted of feudal ranks, which were, from highest to lowest: the khan, sultans, begs and morzalar. The rest of the population were known as qara xalƒ±q, black people (or more accurately in Old Turkic, \\"great creation\\" implying 'the creatures at large\\" or common folks, when \\"qara\\" stood for \\"big\\" and \\"great\\" not just black, and \\"aq\\" (white), stood also for delicate, small, dainty etc.)- the standard Turkic designation for commoners. The state religion was Islam. With its conquest by the Russians in 1556, Islam was largely replaced by Russian Orthodox Christianity, though the region to this day is home to a Muslim minority. The Kalmyks are largely Buddhist. History The Astrakhan khanate is poorly documented. According to Frank \\"The dates and activities of these rulers are faintly represented in the sources, when they are represented at all.\\" About all we have is an imperfect khan list with uncertain regnal dates and a few military and diplomatic events and traveler's reports. The capital was Xacitarxan, which the Russians called Astrakhan, 12 km north of modern Astrakhan. After the conquest, the town and name were moved to the present location. The khanate is said to have been founded 1466 In 1466 Mahmud bin K√ºch√ºk sent a letter to the sultan claiming the area as his patrimony (Frank, page 253). This may be the source of the 1466 date. but did not become fully separate from the Golden Horde until the Horde's end in 1502. In 1459 the Golden Horde ruler K√ºch√ºk Muhammad died and power was split between his sons Ahmed Khan bin K√ºch√ºk, the man who lost Russia in 1480, and Mahmud bin K√ºch√ºk who was based around Astrakhan. The khanate was founded either by Mahmud or his son Qasim I. The khans of Astrakhan were all descended from Mahmud or his brother Ahmed. It was visited by Ambrogio Contarini in 1476. Howorth (only) says it was besieged by Ahmed and Ibak Khan some time before 1480. The Russian Wikipedia (only) says it was besieged by Ibak's brother and the Nogais in 1492. It was twice briefly occupied by Crimea (Mehmed I Giray in 1523 and Sahib I Giray in 1549). The khanate traditionally had military and diplomatic relations with Crimea, the Nogais and sometimes the Circassians. Diplomatic contact with Moscow began in 1532 or earlier. About this time Moscow was expanding east toward Kazan which it conquered in 1552. It also was gaining the power to exert force down the Volga between Kazan and Astrakhan, something that is not explained in the sources. In 1551 Yamghurchi of Astrakhan made a nominal submission to Moscow. He soon changed sides and allied with Crimea and the Nogais. Russia sent 30,000 troops against him. In 1554 he fled the town and Russia imposed its client Dervish Ali Astrakhani who soon began intriguing with the Crimeans. Russia sent more troops and occupied Astrakhan in 1556, proceeding to destroy the largest slave market on the Volga.Janet Martin, Medieval Russia:980-1584, (Cambridge University Press, 1996), p. 356 In 1558 'Astrakhan' was moved 12 km south to its present location. In 1569 the Ottomans were unable to regain Astrakhan for Islam.

The sources could recursively reference additional sources, providing wide flexibility in input parsing. The rules for output creation were also in source files, with similar levels of dynamic input capability. Interpretation of the multiple input sources allowed for dynamic creation of output stream content. Complex recursive processes could be applied to create program source code, job execution sequences, simulated dynamic input from virtual consoles, and in general provide scripting capabilities reminiscent of the Unix GREP and YACC tools.

Light and dark shading shows extent of land during low and high sea stands of glacial cycles. Panel labelled \\"Recent\\" represents latest glacial cycle, and the low sea stand for that period occurred about 18,000 years ago. Maui Nui or Greater Maui, is a modern geologists' name given to a prehistoric Hawaiian Island built from seven shield volcanoes. Nui means \\"great/large\\" in the Hawaiian language. 1.2 million years ago, Maui Nui was , 40% larger than the present-day island of Hawaii. Sea levels were lower than today's, due to distant glaciation locking up the Earth's water during ice ages, thus exposing more land. As the volcanoes slowly settled by subsidence, due to the weight of the shield volcanoes and erosion, the saddles between them slowly flooded, forming four islands: Maui, Molokai, LƒÅnai, and Kahoolawe by about 200,000 years ago. Another former volcanic island lying west of Molokai was completely submerged, and covered with a cap of coral; it is now known as Penguin Bank. The sea floor between these four islands is relatively shallow, about deep, and all of the islands except Kahoolawe were joined during the low sea levels of the last glacial maximum, about 20,000 years ago. But at the outer edges of former Maui Nui, as with the edges of all Hawaiian Islands, the sea floor plummets to the abyssal ocean floor of the Pacific Ocean. The steep slopes can result in massive landslides due to flank collapse, including one which removed most of the northern half of East Molokai. Administratively, the current islands remaining from Maui Nui comprise Maui County (except a tiny part of Molokai, which comprises Kalawao County). Maui Nui was formed in the Pleistocene Epoch which lasted from around 2 million years ago to about 11,000 years ago.

Sir Harold Boulton, 2nd Baronet composed the lyrics to an air collected by Anne Campbelle MacLeod in the 1870s, and the line \\"Over the Sea to Skye\\" is now a cornerstone of the tourism industry on the Isle of Skye. Alternative lyrics to the tune were written by Robert Louis Stevenson, probably in 1885. After hearing the Jacobite airs sung by a visitor, he judged the words of this song to be \\"unworthy\\", so made a new set of verses \\"more in harmony with the plaintive tune\\".Mrs R. L. Stevenson. \\"Prefatory Note\\". In Robert Louis Stevenson. Poems. Volume I. p. 58. London: Heinemann, 1924. The visitor was Elizabeth Anne Ferrier who stayed with Stevenson in June 1885 (Robert Louis Stevenson. Letters, Volume V. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1995). It is often played as a slow lullaby or waltz, and entered into the modern folk canon in the twentieth century with versions by Paul Robeson, Tom Jones, Rod Stewart, Roger Whittaker, Tori Amos, and many others. Content The text of the song gives an account of how Bonnie Prince Charlie, disguised as a serving maid, escaped in a small boat after the defeat of his Jacobite rising of 1745, with the aid of Flora MacDonald. The song draws on the motifs of Jacobitism although it was composed nearly a century and a half after the episode it describes.. . It is often supposed that it describes Charles's flight from the mainland, but this is unhistorical. The only time Charles was in Skye was when he left Benbecula in the Outer Hebrides to avoid the increasingly thorough government searches. Origin The lyrics were written by Sir Harold Boulton, 2nd Baronet, to an air collected in the 1870s by Anne Campbelle MacLeod (1855‚Äì1921), who became Lady Wilson by marriage to Sir James Wilson, KSCI (1853‚Äì1926), in 1888. The song was first published in Songs of the North by Boulton and MacLeod, London, 1884, a book that went into at least twenty editions. In later editions MacLeod's name was dropped and the ascription \\"Old Highland rowing measure arranged by Malcolm Lawson\\" was substituted. It was quickly taken up by other compilers, such as Laura Alexandrine Smith's Music of the Waters (published 1888). Lawson was the elder brother of artist Cecil Gordon Lawson. According to Andrew Kuntz, a collector of folk music lore, MacLeod was on a trip to the isle of Skye and was being rowed over Loch Coruisk (, the \\"Cauldron of Waters\\") when the rowers broke into a Gaelic rowing song \\"\\" (\\"The Cuckoo in the Grove\\"). MacLeod set down what she remembered of the air, with the intention of using it later in a book she was to co-author with Boulton, who later added the section with the Jacobite associations. \\"As a piece of modern romantic literature with traditional links it succeeded perhaps too well, for soon people began 'remembering' they had learned the song in their childhood, and that the words were 'old Gaelic lines',\\" Andrew Kuntz has observed. The song was not in any older books of Scottish songs, though it is in most collections like The Fireside Book of Folk Songs. It is often sung as a lullaby, in a slow rocking 6/8 time. Recording history and covers It was extremely popular in its day, and from its first recording by Tom Bryce on April 29, 1899, became a standard among Scottish folk and dance musicians. It was even more widely known from the 1960s onwards and has remained popular in mainstream music genres. Alfred Deller recorded a version for his album Western Wind in 1958, together with Desmond Dupr√© on guitar and John Sothcott on recorder. It was performed to great acclaim and recorded by artist and social activist Paul Robeson in 1959 and 1960. Welshman Tom Jones recorded a version, which was arranged by Lee Lawson and Harold Boulton, on his debut album Along Came Jones in 1965. The same album, released in the U.S. as It's Not Unusual (and carrying only 12 of the original 16 tracks), did not give attribution for the arrangement but did characterise the song as \\"Trad.‚Äî2:57.\\" Esther & Abi Ofarim recorded the song under the title \\"Bonnie Boat\\" for their album Das Neue Esther & Abi Ofarim Album (1966). =Rangers FC and Doctor Who= Fans of Rangers FC in Glasgow used to sing a version of the song in praise of Danish player Kai Johansen (played 1965‚Äì70). Patrick Troughton, as the second Doctor on the British science-fiction television series Doctor Who, played the song repeatedly on his recorder in episode 6, scene 10 of \\"The Web of Fear\\" (broadcast 9 March 1968). =Hits Down Under= A tough garage rock version of the song by a New Guinean band The Stalemates was included on the Viking Records compilation The New Guinea Scene in 1969. =1970s= Calum Kennedy included a version on Songs of Scotland and Ireland (Beltona 1971), and Rod Stewart recorded two versions of the song with The Atlantic Crossing Drum & Pipe Band during the sessions for Atlantic Crossing between 1974 and 1975. They were given an official release on the deluxe re-release of the album in 2009. =After 1980= \\"The Skye Boat Song\\" can be heard at the beginning of \\"Who Stole the Bagpipes\\", the second episode in season one of the early 1980s British cartoon Dangermouse. Roger Whittaker's duet version with Des O'Connor, released in 1986, made the UK top 10; it combined O'Connor's vocals with Whittaker's whistling version, a part of his repertoire since at least the mid-1970s. The track was recorded at London's Holland Park Lansdowne Studios (now a high-end residential underground property) with session drummer Peter Boita along with all the high-profile studio session players of the day. The cellist Julian Lloyd Webber recorded an instrumental version of the song in 1986 on the album Encore!. In the 1987 horror movie, It's Alive III: Island of the Alive, the main character played by Michael Moriarty sings the song onboard a boat with crew members at 46 mins 17 secs. The Shadows played an instrumental version of the song on their 1987 album Simply Shadows. Singer Tori Amos covered the song as part of a song trilogy entitled \\"Etienne Trilogy\\" on her debut album Y Kant Tori Read (1988). James Galway and The Chieftains recorded an instrumental version (which was used as background music for a Johnnie Walker commercial) in February 1990 at Studios 301, Sydney, Australia, released on the album Over the Sea to Skye - The Celtic Connection. There is also a version on The Corries In Concert / Scottish Love Songs album (track 19). Galway plays the instrumental version on episode 1957 of Sesame Street, originally aired in 1984. Stellan Skarsg√•rd's character plays this song on the cello in the 1992 film Wind. Canadian Punk band The Real McKenzies covered this song on their 1995 debut album The Real McKenzies. =21st century= The music can be heard in an episode of Sex and the City entitled \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\\". The music can be heard before the first wedding of Charlotte York to Trey McDougal in Series 3. Bear McCreary adapted the song as the opening titles of the 2014 TV series Outlander, sung by Raya Yarbrough, changing the text of Robert Louis Stevenson's poem \\"Sing Me a Song of a Lad That Is Gone\\" (1892) to \\"Lass\\" to fit the story. It can also be heard as background instrumental music in several episodes of the American serial killer television series Dexter. Peter Hollens recorded an a capella cover of the song for the 2018 album Legendary Folk songs. It's sung by the character Claire Louise McLeod (played by Lisa Chappell) on season 1, episode 5, \\"Taking the Reins\\" of the Australian TV series McLeod's Daughters. The Choral Scholars of University College Dublin recorded an arrangement by their artistic director Desmond Earley for their 2015 album Invisible Stars: Choral Works of Ireland and Scotland Lyrics and melody =Original lyrics= [Chorus:] Speed, bonnie boat, like a bird on the wing, Onward! the sailors cry; Carry the lad that's born to be king Over the sea to Skye. 1\\\\. Loud the winds howl, loud the waves roar, Thunderclaps rend the air; Baffled, our foes stand by the shore, Follow they will not dare. [Chorus] 2\\\\. Many's the lad, fought in that day Well the claymore did wield; When the night came, silently lay Dead on Culloden's field. [Chorus] 3\\\\. Though the waves leap, soft shall ye sleep, Ocean's a royal bed. Rocked in the deep, Flora will keep Watch by your weary head. [Chorus] 4\\\\. Burned are their homes, exile and death Scatter the loyal men; Yet ere the sword cool in the sheath Charlie will come again. =Stevenson's poem= Robert Louis Stevenson's 1892 poem, which has been sung to the tune, has the following text: [Chorus:] Sing me a song of a lad that is gone, Say, could that lad be I? Merry of soul he sailed on a day Over the sea to Skye. 1\\\\. Mull was astern, Rum on the port, Eigg on the starboard bow; Glory of youth glowed in his soul; Where is that glory now? [Chorus] 2\\\\. Give me again all that was there, Give me the sun that shone! Give me the eyes, give me the soul, Give me the lad that's gone! [Chorus] 3\\\\. Billow and breeze, islands and seas, Mountains of rain and sun, All that was good, all that was fair, All that was me is gone. =Other versions= There has also been a hymn adaptation of the tune, known as \\"Spirit of God Unseen as the Wind\\"; some of the lyrics vary. \\"The Skye Boat Song\\" has been parodied in song by Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders on their comedy series French and Saunders.

Life and Politics Viamonte was born in Buenos Aires and entered the army in his youth following in his father's footsteps. He fought in the First British Invasion with the rank of lieutenant, and after his participation in the Second Invasion, having distinguished himself in the defense of the Colegio de San Carlos, was promoted to captain. He took part on the Buenos Aires Cabildo of May 22, 1810 and after the revolution he fought at the battles of Suipacha and Huaqui. After this latter battle he was accused of not joining with the 1,500 men under his command, while he was doing military exercises nearby. This accusation led to a long court-martial which finally acquitted him and he remained in the army. In November 1814, when the civil war between Federales and Unitarians had started, he was named governor of Entre R√≠os Province. The following year he took part in the revolution against Supreme Director Carlos Mar√≠a de Alvear, and later he was sent to Santa Fe Province to control the advance of the federalists. The day after his arrival governor Francisco Candioti died, which gave Viamonte the opportunity to make the province depend again on Buenos Aires. The following year he was expelled in a rising organized by local caudillos Mariano Vera and Estanislao L√≥pez, and he was sent to be imprisoned at Artigas encampment. In May 1818 he was a deputy to the Congress of Tucum√°n, and the following year he was named chief of the expeditionary army of Santa Fe, replacing Juan Ram√≥n Balcarce. Estanislao L√≥pez immobilized the army directed from C√≥rdoba by Juan Bautista Bustos and captured Viamonte at Rosario, forcing him to sign the armistice of Santo Tom√©. He was exiled to Montevideo after the Battle of Cepeda (1820), but he returned a year later in 1821 and was named governor of Buenos Aires Province due to the absence of Mart√≠n Rodr√≠guez. He was a deputy to the General Congress of 1824 and he supported the unitarian constitution of 1826, but later on he changed sides and joined Dorrego's Federal Party. After the failed unitarian experiment of Juan Lavalle, he was interim governor in 1829, a post in which he did practically nothing but ensure the ascent to power of Juan Manuel de Rosas. In 1833, when governor Balcarce was deposed in the Revolution of the Restorers, he returned to the governorship but Rosas forced him to resign in June 1834, a resignation that was not readily accepted as nobody wanted to take the post. Finally in October the legislature reached a compromise and its president Manuel Vicente Maza, was forced to take the governorship. Viamonte was exiled in Montevideo in 1839 for the last time where he died in 1843. His remains were transported back to Buenos Aires, and were interred in the La Recoleta Cemetery.

In 1972, the Loveland frog legend gained renewed attention when a Loveland police officer reported to a colleague that he had seen an animal consistent with descriptions of the frogman. After a purported sighting in 2016, the second officer called a news station to report that he had shot and killed the same creature some weeks after the 1972 incident and had identified it as a large iguana that was missing its tail. University of Cincinnati folklore professor Edgar Slotkin compared the Loveland frog to Paul Bunyan, saying that stories about it have been passed down for \\"several decades\\" and that sighting reports seem to come in predictable cycles. In May 2014, the Loveland frog legend was made into a musical, titled Hot Damn! It's the Loveland Frog!. Legends According to various legends, the creature was first sighted in 1955, with some versions of the story specifying the month of May. There are three different versions of that story that only differ slightly from each other. The three stories start the same way, with a businessman or a traveling salesman driving along an unnamed road late at night. The stories start to diverge at this point: in one story, the driver was heading out of the Branch Hill neighborhood when he spotted three figures stood erect on their hind legs along the side of the road, each in height, with leathery skin and frog faces. In the other two versions of the story, the creatures were spotted under or over a poorly lit bridge (there are a number of bridges in Loveland going over the Little Miami river). The story tells of the businessman watching the figures converse for a while until one of the creatures held a wand over its head and fired a spray of sparks, startling the observer into fleeing the scene. Loveland police On 3 March 1972 at 1:00am, Loveland police officer Ray Shockey was driving on Riverside Drive near the Totes boot factory and the Little Miami River when an unidentified animal scurried across the road in front of his vehicle. The animal was fully illuminated in his vehicle's headlights, and he described it as long and about , with leathery skin. He reported spotting the animal \\"crouched like a frog\\" before it momentarily stood erect to climb over the guardrail and back down towards the river. Two weeks after the incident, a second Loveland police officer, Mark Matthews, reported seeing an unidentified animal crouched along the road in the same vicinity as Shockey's sighting. Matthews shot the animal, recovered the body, and put it in his trunk to show officer Shockey. According to Matthews, it was \\"a large iguana about 3 or 3.5 feet long\\", and he didn't immediately recognize it because it was missing its tail. Mathews speculated the iguana had been someone's pet that \\"either got loose or was released when it grew too large\\". According to Mathews, Shockey was shown the dead iguana and confirmed it was the animal he had seen two weeks previously. Matthews recounted the incident to an author of a book about urban legends, but says the author \\"omitted the part that confirmed that the creature was an iguana rather than a Frogman\\". Popular culture In August 2016, local Cincinnati TV stations reported that \\"a night of fun turned into a chilling tale of horror\\" when two teenagers playing Pok√©mon Go between Loveland Madeira Road and Lake Isabella claimed to see a giant frog near the lake on August 3 that \\"stood up and walked on its hind legs\\".Legatte, Jim (August 2016) Know the legend of the Loveland Frogman?

History In the late 1970s, Egypt had several cohabitation governments which proved to be unstable, due to the struggle arising between the president and the prime minister. From 1981 until 2011, the National Democratic Party had maintained a majority in the People‚Äôs Assembly and supplied the Egyptian president. The National Democratic Party was dissolved by the supreme administrative court on 16 April 2011, following the Egyptian uprising which eventually caused the resignation of Hosni Mubarak. Powers Previously, under the 1971 Constitution as amended on 1980, 2003 and 2007, the role of the Prime Minister was limited only to supervising the Cabinet, as the President at that time, was both the head of state and of the government. The Prime Minister, now, heads the Cabinet, and the entire government of the country under the 2012 and the present 2014 Constitutions, aside from supervising and directing its activities and overseeing its work. He or she, alongside the members of the Cabinet, may propose laws to unicameral Parliament, the House of Representatives, as well as amendments during parliamentary meetings. The Prime Minister has also the power to issue regulations enforcing the laws as well as ensuring full public services and disciplinary measures, which must be subject to government approval. The said regulatory powers were previously held by the President under the 1971 Constitution, as amended on 1980, 2003 and 2007. The Prime Minister and the Cabinet also helps the President in formulating the state's general policy and in overseeing its implementation under the both 2012 and the present 2014 Constitutions. Nubar Pasha was an Christian Egyptian-Armenian politician and the first Prime Minister of Egypt . He served as Prime Minister three times during his career. His first term was between August 1878 and 23 February 1879 When parties from opposite ends of the political spectrum control Parliament and the presidency, the power- sharing arrangement is known as cohabitation. Several cohabitation governments took control in the 1970s yet proved to be very unstable. Current Prime Minister From 1 March to 17 June 2014, Ibrahim Mahlab served as the Acting Prime Minister of Egypt. At the time of his appointment by Adly Mansour, he said, \\"security and stability in the entire country and crushing terrorism will pave the way for investment.\\" A new cabinet was formed on 19 September 2015. Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi accepted the resignation of the government and asked Petroleum Minister Sherif Ismail to form a new cabinet.

It is in the city centre, close to the city's Chinatown. It is Grade I listed. The cloisters area of Blackfriars Early history During the early years of the 13th century, orders of friars began to establish themselves in England. Newcastle came to have five friaries within its walls: Blackfriars (Dominican) established in 1239; Whitefriars (Carmelite) established in 1262; Austinfriars (Augustinian) established in 1290 (now the site of the Holy Jesus Hospital); Greyfriars (Franciscans) established in 1274 and the Trinitarians established in 1360. There was also the nunnery of St Bartholomew's founded in 1086 near the present Nun Street. The Dominican friary was founded by a wealthy Newcastle merchant, Sir Peter Scott. Friars differed from monks, in that worship featured less prominently in the daily routine of the friary. They were clerics who initially lived solely by begging, and they were mostly located in urban areas. They were therefore known as mendicant orders. The Dominican order was founded by St Dominic, also known as Dominic of Osma, shortly after 1200. Dominicans were forbidden to own buildings and land, but such property could be held in trust for them. Such was the case with Blackfriars, which was situated in the north west of Newcastle just inside the city walls. The friary covered seven acres (2.83 hectares), but also had two gardens and four small closes that provided a small income. During the 14th century, the friary accommodated royalty on more than one occasion. In 1334 Edward III of England and Edward Balliol, the claimant to the Scottish throne, met there. Reformation During the Reformation begun by Henry VIII in 1536, the five Newcastle friaries and the single nunnery were dissolved and the land was sold to the Corporation and to rich merchants in 1539. The Church, sacristy, eastern half of the chapter house and cloister were all demolished. At this time there were fewer than 60 inmates of the religious houses in Newcastle. The convent of Blackfriars was sold to the mayor and burgesses of Newcastle, who then leased it to nine of the town's craft guilds, to be used as their headquarters in 1552. This probably explains why it is the only one of the religious houses whose building survives to the present day. The guilds carried out extensive changes to adapt the cloistered buildings to their own use. This was carried out in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. Between 1709 and 1739 many further alterations were made, such as providing new windows and altering floor levels. Some of the guilds, such as the Tailors and the Cordwainers, moved out of Blackfriars for a while and subsequently returned. The guilds‚Äô meeting houses in Blackfriars were well used until the 19th century. The guilds only met in them once a quarter, so that they were used for other purposes the rest of the time. Ground floor rooms often served as dwellings, either for people employed by the guilds, or for the needy, who lived there free of rent. Neglect and subsequent restoration During much of the 19th century and into the 20th century, the buildings of Blackfriars were neglected and fell into an increasingly bad state of repair. In 1937 the Saddlers‚Äô property was declared as unfit for human habitation. Newcastle Corporation acquired Blackfriars in the early 1950s. At one time there appeared to be a possibility that the Dominicans might return to occupy Blackfriars, but this did not happen. The guild of Tailors, among others, continued to meet at Blackfriars until 1974. Between 1973 and 1981, the buildings of Blackfriars were restored. Blackfriars now Only the buildings of the cloisters remain. In the Middle Ages the cloister consisted of an open garth, approximately 69 ft (21m) square surrounded by a 10 ft (3m) wide covered walk. The covered walk no longer exists. The friary church was at the north end of the cloister, but was demolished in the 16th century. The outline of the church can be made out in the grassy space that remains. The buildings now house a range of craft workshops and a restaurant owned by Andy Hook with Head chef Chris Wardale. Blackfriars also houses an exhibition, which describes the history of Blackfriars. The large grassed courtyard contrasts with the busy city life that surrounds it. The Tanners Guild still use the former Smiths Hall (referred to as the Freemen's Hall) in Blackfriars for their meetings. The site is close to the most intact section of the old town walls. The Blackfriars (Order of Preachers) returned to Newcastle in the nineteenth century. St Dominic's Priory, the new Blackfriars, was opened by Cardinal Manning in 1873. it is situated on New Bridge Street.

Interior algebras are to topology and the modal logic S4 what Boolean algebras are to set theory and ordinary propositional logic. Interior algebras form a variety of modal algebras. Definition An interior algebra is an algebraic structure with the signature :‚ü®S, ¬∑, +, ‚Ä≤, 0, 1, I‚ü© where :‚ü®S, ¬∑, +, ‚Ä≤, 0, 1‚ü© is a Boolean algebra and postfix I designates a unary operator, the interior operator, satisfying the identities: # xI ‚â§ x # xII = xI # (xy)I = xIyI # 1I = 1 xI is called the interior of x. The dual of the interior operator is the closure operator C defined by xC = ((x‚Ä≤)I)‚Ä≤. xC is called the closure of x. By the principle of duality, the closure operator satisfies the identities: # xC ‚â• x # xCC = xC # (x + y)C = xC \\\\+ yC # 0C = 0 If the closure operator is taken as primitive, the interior operator can be defined as xI = ((x‚Ä≤)C)‚Ä≤. Thus the theory of interior algebras may be formulated using the closure operator instead of the interior operator, in which case one considers closure algebras of the form ‚ü®S, ¬∑, +, ‚Ä≤, 0, 1, C‚ü©, where ‚ü®S, ¬∑, +, ‚Ä≤, 0, 1‚ü© is again a Boolean algebra and C satisfies the above identities for the closure operator. Closure and interior algebras form dual pairs, and are paradigmatic instances of \\"Boolean algebras with operators.\\" The early literature on this subject (mainly Polish topology) invoked closure operators, but the interior operator formulation eventually became the norm following the work of Wim Blok.  Open and closed elements  Elements of an interior algebra satisfying the condition xI = x are called open. The complements of open elements are called closed and are characterized by the condition xC = x. An interior of an element is always open and the closure of an element is always closed. Interiors of closed elements are called regular open and closures of open elements are called regular closed. Elements which are both open and closed are called clopen. 0 and 1 are clopen. An interior algebra is called Boolean if all its elements are open (and hence clopen). Boolean interior algebras can be identified with ordinary Boolean algebras as their interior and closure operators provide no meaningful additional structure. A special case is the class of trivial interior algebras which are the single element interior algebras characterized by the identity 0 = 1.  Morphisms of interior algebras  = Homomorphisms = Interior algebras, by virtue of being algebraic structures, have homomorphisms. Given two interior algebras A and B, a map f : A ‚Üí B is an interior algebra homomorphism if and only if f is a homomorphism between the underlying Boolean algebras of A and B, that also preserves interiors and closures. Hence: *f(xI) = f(x)I; *f(xC) = f(x)C. = Topomorphisms = Topomorphisms are another important, and more general, class of morphisms between interior algebras. A map f : A ‚Üí B is a topomorphism if and only if f is a homomorphism between the Boolean algebras underlying A and B, that also preserves the open and closed elements of A. Hence: * If x is open in A, then f(x) is open in B; * If x is closed in A, then f(x) is closed in B. (Such morphisms have also been called stable homomorphisms and closure algebra semi-homomorphisms.) Every interior algebra homomorphism is a topomorphism, but not every topomorphism is an interior algebra homomorphism. = Boolean homomorphisms = Early research often considered mappings between interior algebras which were homomorphisms of the underlying Boolean algebras but which did not necessarily preserve the interior or closure operator. Such mappings were called Boolean homomorphisms. (The terms closure homomorphism or topological homomorphism were used in the case where these were preserved, but this terminology is now redundant as the standard definition of a homomorphism in universal algebra requires that it preserves all operations.) Applications involving countably complete interior algebras (in which countable meets and joins always exist, also called œÉ-complete) typically made use of countably complete Boolean homomorphisms also called Boolean œÉ-homomorphisms - these preserve countable meets and joins. = Continuous morphisms = The earliest generalization of continuity to interior algebras was Sikorski's based on the inverse image map of a continuous map. This is a Boolean homomorphism, preserves unions of sequences and includes the closure of an inverse image in the inverse image of the closure. Sikorski thus defined a continuous homomorphism as a Boolean œÉ-homomorphism f between two œÉ-complete interior algebras such that f(x)C ‚â§ f(xC). This definition had several difficulties: The construction acts contravariantly producing a dual of a continuous map rather than a generalization. On the one hand œÉ-completeness is too weak to characterize inverse image maps (completeness is required), on the other hand it is too restrictive for a generalization. (Sikorski remarked on using non-œÉ- complete homomorphisms but included œÉ-completeness in his axioms for closure algebras.) Later J. Schmid defined a continuous homomorphism or continuous morphism for interior algebras as a Boolean homomorphism f between two interior algebras satisfying f(xC) ‚â§ f(x)C. This generalizes the forward image map of a continuous map - the image of a closure is contained in the closure of the image. This construction is covariant but not suitable for category theoretic applications as it only allows construction of continuous morphisms from continuous maps in the case of bijections. (C. Naturman returned to Sikorski's approach while dropping œÉ-completeness to produce topomorphisms as defined above. In this terminology, Sikorski's original \\"continuous homomorphisms\\" are œÉ-complete topomorphisms between œÉ-complete interior algebras.)  Relationships to other areas of mathematics  = Topology = Given a topological space X = ‚ü®X, T‚ü© one can form the power set Boolean algebra of X: :‚ü®P(X), ‚à©, ‚à™, ‚Ä≤, √∏, X‚ü© and extend it to an interior algebra :A(X) = ‚ü®P(X), ‚à©, ‚à™, ‚Ä≤, √∏, X, I‚ü©, where I is the usual topological interior operator. For all S ‚äÜ X it is defined by :SI = ‚à™ {O : O ‚äÜ S and O is open in X} For all S ‚äÜ X the corresponding closure operator is given by :SC = ‚à© {C : S ‚äÜ C and C is closed in X} SI is the largest open subset of S and SC is the smallest closed superset of S in X. The open, closed, regular open, regular closed and clopen elements of the interior algebra A(X) are just the open, closed, regular open, regular closed and clopen subsets of X respectively in the usual topological sense. Every complete atomic interior algebra is isomorphic to an interior algebra of the form A(X) for some topological space X. Moreover, every interior algebra can be embedded in such an interior algebra giving a representation of an interior algebra as a topological field of sets. The properties of the structure A(X) are the very motivation for the definition of interior algebras. Because of this intimate connection with topology, interior algebras have also been called topo-Boolean algebras or topological Boolean algebras. Given a continuous map between two topological spaces :f : X ‚Üí Y we can define a complete topomorphism :A(f) : A(Y) ‚Üí A(X) by :A(f)(S) = f‚àí1[S] for all subsets S of Y. Every complete topomorphism between two complete atomic interior algebras can be derived in this way. If Top is the category of topological spaces and continuous maps and Cit is the category of complete atomic interior algebras and complete topomorphisms then Top and Cit are dually isomorphic and A : Top ‚Üí Cit is a contravariant functor that is a dual isomorphism of categories. A(f) is a homomorphism if and only if f is a continuous open map. Under this dual isomorphism of categories many natural topological properties correspond to algebraic properties, in particular connectedness properties correspond to irreducibility properties: *X is empty if and only if A(X) is trivial *X is indiscrete if and only if A(X) is simple *X is discrete if and only if A(X) is Boolean *X is almost discrete if and only if A(X) is semisimple *X is finitely generated (Alexandrov) if and only if A(X) is operator complete i.e. its interior and closure operators distribute over arbitrary meets and joins respectively *X is connected if and only if A(X) is directly indecomposable *X is ultraconnected if and only if A(X) is finitely subdirectly irreducible *X is compact ultra-connected if and only if A(X) is subdirectly irreducible  Generalized topology  The modern formulation of topological spaces in terms of topologies of open subsets, motivates an alternative formulation of interior algebras: A generalized topological space is an algebraic structure of the form :‚ü®B, ¬∑, +, ‚Ä≤, 0, 1, T‚ü© where ‚ü®B, ¬∑, +, ‚Ä≤, 0, 1‚ü© is a Boolean algebra as usual, and T is a unary relation on B (subset of B) such that: #0,1 ‚àà T #T is closed under arbitrary joins (i.e. if a join of an arbitrary subset of T exists then it will be in T) #T is closed under finite meets #For every element b of B, the join ‚àë{a ‚ààT : a ‚â§ b} exists T is said to be a generalized topology in the Boolean algebra. Given an interior algebra its open elements form a generalized topology. Conversely given a generalized topological space :‚ü®B, ¬∑, +, ‚Ä≤, 0, 1, T‚ü© we can define an interior operator on B by bI = ‚àë{a ‚ààT : a ‚â§ b} thereby producing an interior algebra whose open elements are precisely T. Thus generalized topological spaces are equivalent to interior algebras. Considering interior algebras to be generalized topological spaces, topomorphisms are then the standard homomorphisms of Boolean algebras with added relations, so that standard results from universal algebra apply.  Neighbourhood functions and neighbourhood lattices  The topological concept of neighbourhoods can be generalized to interior algebras: An element y of an interior algebra is said to be a neighbourhood of an element x if x ‚â§ yI. The set of neighbourhoods of x is denoted by N(x) and forms a filter. This leads to another formulation of interior algebras: A neighbourhood function on a Boolean algebra is a mapping N from its underlying set B to its set of filters, such that: #For all x ‚àà B, max{y ‚àà B : x ‚àà N(y)} exists #For all x,y ‚àà B, x ‚àà N(y) if and only if there is a z ‚àà B such that y ‚â§ z ‚â§ x and z ‚àà N(z). The mapping N of elements of an interior algebra to their filters of neighbourhoods is a neighbourhood function on the underlying Boolean algebra of the interior algebra. Moreover, given a neighbourhood function N on a Boolean algebra with underlying set B, we can define an interior operator by xI = max {y ‚àà B : x ‚àà N(y)} thereby obtaining an interior algebra. N(x) will then be precisely the filter of neighbourhoods of x in this interior algebra. Thus interior algebras are equivalent to Boolean algebras with specified neighbourhood functions. In terms of neighbourhood functions, the open elements are precisely those elements x such that x ‚àà N(x). In terms of open elements x ‚àà N(y) if and only if there is an open element z such that y ‚â§ z ‚â§ x. Neighbourhood functions may be defined more generally on (meet)-semilattices producing the structures known as neighbourhood (semi)lattices. Interior algebras may thus be viewed as precisely the Boolean neighbourhood lattices i.e. those neighbourhood lattices whose underlying semilattice forms a Boolean algebra. = Modal logic = Given a theory (set of formal sentences) M in the modal logic S4, we can form its Lindenbaum‚ÄìTarski algebra: :L(M) = ‚ü®M / ~, ‚àß, ‚à®, ¬¨, F, T, ‚ñ°‚ü© where ~ is the equivalence relation on sentences in M given by p ~ q if and only if p and q are logically equivalent in M, and M / ~ is the set of equivalence classes under this relation. Then L(M) is an interior algebra. The interior operator in this case corresponds to the modal operator ‚ñ° (necessarily), while the closure operator corresponds to ‚óä (possibly). This construction is a special case of a more general result for modal algebras and modal logic. The open elements of L(M) correspond to sentences that are only true if they are necessarily true, while the closed elements correspond to those that are only false if they are necessarily false. Because of their relation to S4, interior algebras are sometimes called S4 algebras or Lewis algebras, after the logician C. I. Lewis, who first proposed the modal logics S4 and S5. = Preorders = Since interior algebras are (normal) Boolean algebras with operators, they can be represented by fields of sets on appropriate relational structures. In particular, since they are modal algebras, they can be represented as fields of sets on a set with a single binary relation, called a modal frame. The modal frames corresponding to interior algebras are precisely the preordered sets. Preordered sets (also called S4-frames) provide the Kripke semantics of the modal logic S4, and the connection between interior algebras and preorders is deeply related to their connection with modal logic. Given a preordered set X = ‚ü®X, ¬´‚ü© we can construct an interior algebra : B(X) = ‚ü®P(X), ‚à©, ‚à™, ‚Ä≤, √∏, X, I‚ü© from the power set Boolean algebra of X where the interior operator I is given by :SI = {x ‚àà X : for all y ‚àà X, x ¬´ y implies y ‚àà S} for all S ‚äÜ X. The corresponding closure operator is given by :SC = {x ‚àà X : there exists a y ‚àà S with x ¬´ y} for all S ‚äÜ X. SI is the set of all worlds inaccessible from worlds outside S, and SC is the set of all worlds accessible from some world in S. Every interior algebra can be embedded in an interior algebra of the form B(X) for some preordered set X giving the above- mentioned representation as a field of sets (a preorder field). This construction and representation theorem is a special case of the more general result for modal algebras and modal frames. In this regard, interior algebras are particularly interesting because of their connection to topology. The construction provides the preordered set X with a topology, the Alexandrov topology, producing a topological space T(X) whose open sets are: :{O ‚äÜ X : for all x ‚àà O and all y ‚àà X, x ¬´ y implies y ‚àà O}. The corresponding closed sets are: :{C ‚äÜ X : for all x ‚àà C and all y ‚àà X, y ¬´ x implies y ‚àà C}. In other words, the open sets are the ones whose worlds are inaccessible from outside (the up-sets), and the closed sets are the ones for which every outside world is inaccessible from inside (the down-sets). Moreover, B(X) = A(T(X)). = Monadic Boolean algebras = Any monadic Boolean algebra can be considered to be an interior algebra where the interior operator is the universal quantifier and the closure operator is the existential quantifier. The monadic Boolean algebras are then precisely the variety of interior algebras satisfying the identity xIC = xI. In other words, they are precisely the interior algebras in which every open element is closed or equivalently, in which every closed element is open. Moreover, such interior algebras are precisely the semisimple interior algebras. They are also the interior algebras corresponding to the modal logic S5, and so have also been called S5 algebras. In the relationship between preordered sets and interior algebras they correspond to the case where the preorder is an equivalence relation, reflecting the fact that such preordered sets provide the Kripke semantics for S5. This also reflects the relationship between the monadic logic of quantification (for which monadic Boolean algebras provide an algebraic description) and S5 where the modal operators ‚ñ° (necessarily) and ‚óä (possibly) can be interpreted in the Kripke semantics using monadic universal and existential quantification, respectively, without reference to an accessibility relation. = Heyting algebras = The open elements of an interior algebra form a Heyting algebra and the closed elements form a dual Heyting algebra. The regular open elements and regular closed elements correspond to the pseudo-complemented elements and dual pseudo-complemented elements of these algebras respectively and thus form Boolean algebras. The clopen elements correspond to the complemented elements and form a common subalgebra of these Boolean algebras as well as of the interior algebra itself. Every Heyting algebra can be represented as the open elements of an interior algebra and the latter may be chosen to an interior algebra generated by its open elements - such interior algebras correspond one to one with Heyting algebras (up to isomorphism) being the free Boolean extensions of the latter. Heyting algebras play the same role for intuitionistic logic that interior algebras play for the modal logic S4 and Boolean algebras play for propositional logic. The relation between Heyting algebras and interior algebras reflects the relationship between intuitionistic logic and S4, in which one can interpret theories of intuitionistic logic as S4 theories closed under necessity. The one to one correspondence between Heyting algebras and interior algebras generated by their open elements reflects the correspondence between extensions of intuitionistic logic and normal extensions of the modal logic S4.Grz. = Derivative algebras = Given an interior algebra A, the closure operator obeys the axioms of the derivative operator, D. Hence we can form a derivative algebra D(A) with the same underlying Boolean algebra as A by using the closure operator as a derivative operator. Thus interior algebras are derivative algebras. From this perspective, they are precisely the variety of derivative algebras satisfying the identity xD ‚â• x. Derivative algebras provide the appropriate algebraic semantics for the modal logic WK4. Hence derivative algebras stand to topological derived sets and WK4 as interior/closure algebras stand to topological interiors/closures and S4. Given a derivative algebra V with derivative operator D, we can form an interior algebra I(V) with the same underlying Boolean algebra as V, with interior and closure operators defined by xI = x¬∑x ‚Ä≤ D ‚Ä≤ and xC = x + xD, respectively. Thus every derivative algebra can be regarded as an interior algebra. Moreover, given an interior algebra A, we have I(D(A)) = A. However, D(I(V)) = V does not necessarily hold for every derivative algebra V. Stone duality and representation for interior algebras Stone duality provides a category theoretic duality between Boolean algebras and a class of topological spaces known as Boolean spaces. Building on nascent ideas of relational semantics (later formalized by Kripke) and a result of R. S. Pierce, J√≥nsson, Tarski and G. Hansoul extended Stone duality to Boolean algebras with operators by equipping Boolean spaces with relations that correspond to the operators via a power set construction. In the case of interior algebras the interior (or closure) operator corresponds to a pre-order on the Boolean space. Homomorphisms between interior algebras correspond to a class of continuous maps between the Boolean spaces known as pseudo-epimorphisms or p-morphisms for short. This generalization of Stone duality to interior algebras based on the J√≥nsson‚ÄìTarski representation was investigated by Leo Esakia and is also known as the Esakia duality for S4-algebras (interior algebras) and is closely related to the Esakia duality for Heyting algebras. Whereas the J√≥nsson‚ÄìTarski generalization of Stone duality applies to Boolean algebras with operators in general, the connection between interior algebras and topology allows for another method of generalizing Stone duality that is unique to interior algebras. An intermediate step in the development of Stone duality is Stone's representation theorem which represents a Boolean algebra as a field of sets. The Stone topology of the corresponding Boolean space is then generated using the field of sets as a topological basis. Building on the topological semantics introduced by Tang Tsao-Chen for Lewis's modal logic, McKinsey and Tarski showed that by generating a topology equivalent to using only the complexes that correspond to open elements as a basis, a representation of an interior algebra is obtained as a topological field of sets - a field of sets on a topological space that is closed with respect to taking interiors or closures. By equipping topological fields of sets with appropriate morphisms known as field maps C. Naturman showed that this approach can be formalized as a category theoretic Stone duality in which the usual Stone duality for Boolean algebras corresponds to the case of interior algebras having redundant interior operator (Boolean interior algebras). The pre-order obtained in the J√≥nsson‚ÄìTarski approach corresponds to the accessibility relation in the Kripke semantics for an S4 theory, while the intermediate field of sets corresponds to a representation of the Lindenbaum‚ÄìTarski algebra for the theory using the sets of possible worlds in the Kripke semantics in which sentences of the theory hold. Moving from the field of sets to a Boolean space somewhat obfuscates this connection. By treating fields of sets on pre-orders as a category in its own right this deep connection can be formulated as a category theoretic duality that generalizes Stone representation without topology. R. Goldblatt had shown that with restrictions to appropriate homomorphisms such a duality can be formulated for arbitrary modal algebras and modal frames. Naturman showed that in the case of interior algebras this duality applies to more general topomorphisms and can be factored via a category theoretic functor through the duality with topological fields of sets. The latter represent the Lindenbaum‚ÄìTarski algebra using sets of points satisfying sentences of the S4 theory in the topological semantics. The pre-order can be obtained as the specialization pre-order of the McKinsey-Tarski topology. The Esakia duality can be recovered via a functor that replaces the field of sets with the Boolean space it generates. Via a functor that instead replaces the pre-order with its corresponding Alexandrov topology, an alternative representation of the interior algebra as a field of sets is obtained where the topology is the Alexandrov bico- reflection of the McKinsey-Tarski topology. The approach of formulating a topological duality for interior algebras using both the Stone topology of the J√≥nsson‚ÄìTarski approach and the Alexandrov topology of the pre-order to form a bi-topological space has been investigated by G. Bezhanishvili, R.Mines, and P.J. Morandi. The McKinsey-Tarski topology of an interior algebra is the intersection of the former two topologies. Metamathematics Grzegorczyk proved the elementary theory of closure algebras undecidable.Andrzej Grzegorczyk (1951), \\"Undecidability of some topological theories,\\" Fundamenta Mathematicae 38: 137‚Äì52.According to footnote 19 in McKinsey and Tarski, 1944, the result had been proved earlier by S. Jaskowski in 1939, but remained unpublished and not accessible in view of the present [at the time] war conditions. Naturman demonstrated that the theory is hereditarily undecidable (all its subtheories are undecidable) and demonstrated an infinite chain of elementary classes of interior algebras with hereditarily undecidable theories.

The story was based on the 1892 play Charley's Aunt by Brandon Thomas. The musical debuted on Broadway in 1948 and was revived on Broadway and in the West End. Ray Bolger starred, and sang the popular song \\"Once In Love With Amy\\". Plot ;Act I The setting is Oxford University in the year 1892 where a group of college seniors are bidding farewell to the years gone by (\\"The Years Before Us\\"). In his dorm room, graduating Jack Chesney is excitedly talking with his butler, Brassett, making sure that luncheon will be ready for later that afternoon. He is so excited because his roommate, Charley Wykeham, has gone to the train station to meet his aunt, Donna Lucia D'Alvadorez, who is coming in from Brazil for a visit. Having Charley's aunt there as chaperone will make it quite easy for their two girl friends, Kitty Verdun and Amy Spettigue, to come for a visit. Charley does return - but without his aunt. Apparently, she never was on the train. After reading her letter more carefully, Charley realizes that he made a mistake - she will be coming on a later one. Not having Charley's aunt there will make it impossible for the girls to stay - no decent girl would remain with two young men unchaperoned. The girls arrive early, and just as expected decide they must leave - not seeing Charley's Aunt Donna Lucia. (\\"Better Get Out Of Here\\"). Actually, they are more worried about being caught by their guardian, Mr. Spettigue, (Amy's uncle) who keeps a tight rein on the girls. The girls do leave. After the girls' departure, the boys are a bit depressed; nevertheless, they know that the girls will return when Charley's Aunt is there. In the meantime, Charley tries on his costume for the upcoming student production in which he is appearing. While Charley is doing this, Jack's father, Sir Francis Chesney, makes a surprise visit and informs his son that they are actually penniless. Jack suggests that possibly a wealthy marriage could alleviate their problems and suggests that Charley's rich widow Aunt Donna Lucia might just be the woman for his father to wed. All Sir Francis needs to do is charm her when she comes for lunch later that day. The plan seems to be perfect. After Jack's father leaves, Charley re-enters in costume rehearsing his lines for the school play. It appears that he will be playing a rather mature older woman - much like his Aunt Donna Lucia. Just then, he is informed by telegram that his aunt will not be arriving for lunch. Instead, she will surprise him at a later date. Jack is upset most of all because this will be his last chance to propose to Kitty - tomorrow she leaves for Scotland. The young ladies unexpectedly appear again assuming that a chaperone is there, and in a fit of desperation, Jack suggests that Charley pose as his aunt - anyway he's wearing the costume right now. Charley does pose as his aunt and fools the girls. They cover for Charley saying that he's not feeling well and has retired to his room. The girls' guardian, Mr. Spettigue, comes looking for the girls, and everyone rushes out to hide from him - everyone except Charley who stays to tell Mr. Spettigue that she is \\"the only young lady present.\\" She finally hits him with her fan and says \\"Be gone my good man and don't bother me any longer.\\" Utterly baffled and confused, Mr. Spettigue leaves, and the girls and Jack return. Sir Francis then enters the scene and escorts Charley to lunch all ready to woo a rich woman into marriage. Just then, Mr. Spettigue re-enters and sees the girls there just as he suspected. He is quite angry until he learns that this \\"woman/chaperone\\" who dismissed him only a few moments earlier is actually the wealthy Donna Lucia D'Alvadorez from Brazil - \\"where the nuts come from.\\" He, too, is smitten by this rich available widow and is ready to make his move. Together, Sir Francis, Charley, and Mr. Spettigue go off to lunch. It's Charley's job to keep them occupied. Jack, Kitty, and Amy all go off to watch the parade and look for Charley. The scene shifts to a street where the students' band is marching. Everyone is excited by what they hear and see. (\\"The New Ashmolean Marching Society and Students' Conservatory Band\\") In a garden, Charley is returning from having just entertained both men. Charley is ready to change back into his regular clothes and go and find Amy who must be wondering where he is. Jack is still frantic and begs Charley to continue for a short while longer so he can talk with Kitty. Charley doesn't care - he has had just about all he can take and goes off to change and find Amy. Kitty comes looking for Donna Lucia, but instead finds herself alone with Jack. It is there that the two are finally able to express their undying love and devotion for each other (\\"My Darling, My Darling\\"). Jack's father finds Kitty and Jack together and asks that he speak with his son. It appears that he is going to take his son's advice and marry Donna Lucia. Jack tells him that this is impossible; however, Sir Francis is now more determined than ever. Charley then appears as himself and finally gets to talk with Amy. He apologizes for his absence, and rushes to talk to Amy about their future together before her uncle returns and whisks her away. While Charley only wishes to propose marriage and speak of a future together, Amy only wants to speak of the future - a time of progress with wireless telegraphy, horseless carriages, and stereopticons that move. (\\"Make A Miracle\\") Mr. Spettigue enters to find Amy with Charley and tells her to collect her things. They are leaving for good! He has been waiting for far too long for Donna Lucia, and is now ready to take Amy home. In a desperate moment, Charley tells Mr. Spettigue that his aunt really is in love with him. In fact, she's up in Charley's room right now resting from the emotional shock of meeting him. He knows that she'll be back soon. It's just that she has some business to attend to - like writing letters to her banks. The greedy Mr. Spettigue agrees to wait and ponders his possible future and fortune with Lucia (\\"Serenade with Asides\\") Charley returns as Donna Lucia, and chases Mr. Spettigue around the garden. In the midst of all this, Jack informs Charley that his father is going to propose to him. In fact, Sir Francis enters and asks Charley to marry him. Charley turns him down, but runs off again as he hears a playful Mr. Spettigue approaching. In the midst of all this, a woman (Charley's real aunt) enters and approaches Sir Francis about finding Charley. As the two look at each other, they realize that they know each other from more than twenty years ago. Sir Francis doesn't know that she is actually Charley's rich Aunt Donna Lucia; in fact, he points out to her that Charley's aunt is right there with them - running around being chased by Mr. Spettigue. She is quite intrigued by it all, and poses as Mrs. Beverly Smythe to better survey the situation. The two then look at each other once more and recall that time long ago when they first met. (\\"Lovelier Than Ever\\"). Jack and Charley are going over things, and Kitty and Amy enter to inform Jack that the only way they'll get to marry the girls is to get Mr. Spettigue's consent in writing. The girls also confide in Charley that they are actually really in love with Charley and Jack, but if they don't get consent to the marriages in writing from Mr. Spettigue, they will be financially cut off for good. Charley agrees to get the written consent from Mr. Spettigue and goes off to do so. Kitty and Jack leave Amy alone to think about Charley and all that is happening. Just where has Charley been? She's crazy about him, but can't help thinking that he's off with another girl - possibly the girl she saw in a picture sitting on his piano. (\\"The Woman In His Room\\") Brassett enters and sets tea. Charley returns still dressed as his aunt and tells Amy that Charley has sent a message to her - he loves her very much. Sir Francis and the real Donna Lucia (still posing as Beverly Smythe) enter and unexpectedly join them for tea. During a madcap tea party, Donna Lucia presses Charley for information about his/her life in Brazil. Charley tells her about the place where Donna Lucia lived - Pernambuco. A song and ballet sequence (seen through Charley's eyes) revealing just how Donna Lucia and her rich husband met and lived together ends the first act. (\\"Pernambuco\\") ;Act 2 The act opens with the Oxford senior graduates posing for their class picture - complete with caps and gowns. They are all there except for Charley. He promised that he'd be there. (\\"Where's Charley?\\") Fortunately, he does make it there - just as the picture is being taken. Walking along a street, Charley tries to explain all of his disappearances to Amy, who tries her best to believe him. She also tells him that her uncle is ready to sign a wedding consent form, but Donna Lucia must meet him to get the document. Charley assures her that \\"she'll\\" be there, but also tells her that he can't be there at the same time. She doesn't quite know what is going on; however, she trusts him and is excited about marrying him. She leaves Charley alone, and there on that street he thinks about Amy - the most wonderful girl in the whole world (\\"Once In Love With Amy\\") Later that day, the girls are in the dressing room preparing themselves for the evening's big dance. While dressing and primping, they also go over all of the most recent events. (\\"The Gossips\\") Kitty drags a reluctant Charley - once again dressed as Donna Lucia - to the dressing room. The real Donna Lucia enters and has a good bit of fun making Charley feel uncomfortable while all the ladies ready themselves for the evening's fun. The ladies eventually all leave and Charley is left alone to talk with Mr. Spettigue who comes to play with his new love. Charley fights off Mr. Spettigue's forced advances and finally demands that he be given the letter of consent that has been promised all along. If Mr. Spettigue goes and gets the letter right now, Charley promises that they can announce their own engagement at the ball. Mr. Spettigue excitedly, dashes off to get the letter and meet his love at the ball. Strolling down a garden path Donna Lucia asks Sir Francis if it isn't strange that they have never seen Charley and his aunt together at the same time. Sir Francis has no interest in any of that. All he cares about is dancing the night away with his long lost love. The same is true of Jack and Kitty. In fact, everyone is dancing the night away in love (\\"Red Rose Cotillion\\") Charley even makes an appearance as himself to keep poor little Amy happy and content. Mr. Spettigue finally appears and announces the engagement of Kitty and Amy to Jack and Charley. He gives Charley (again dressed as his aunt) the letter of consent. Charley sneaks off and reappears as himself once more. Mr. Spettigue wants to see Charley's aunt one more time, so Charley goes to get her. Mr. Spettigue asks to see Charley, the nephew, once again, and a rather \\"tired\\" Charley dashes off to get him. While rushing, Jack accidentally steps on the hem of Charley's skirt and all is \\"revealed.\\" Charley admits to Amy and everyone that he did it all because of love. Mr. Spettigue is angry and doesn't care that they are in love. Charley tells him that they have the letter of consent, which is all they need. Mr. Spettigue fights them by telling them that he will dispute this. The real Donna Lucia finally steps forward and says that indeed the letter of consent was addressed to her and is a legal document - and she puts her blessing on the wedding. There is nothing Spettigue or anyone can do. All is forgiven and everyone (except for Mr. Spettigue) is happy.

The most prominent remaining structures on the site are the Castle Keep, the castle's main fortified stone tower, and the Black Gate, its fortified gatehouse. Use of the site for defensive purposes dates from Roman times, when it housed a fort and settlement called Pons Aelius (meaning 'bridge of Hadrian'), guarding a bridge over the River Tyne. Robert Curthose, eldest son of William the Conqueror, in 1080 built a wooden motte and bailey style castle on the site of the Roman fort. Curthose built this 'New Castle upon Tyne' after he returned south from a campaign against Malcolm III of Scotland. Henry II built the stone Castle Keep between 1172 and 1177 on the site of Curthose's castle. Henry III added the Black Gate between 1247 and 1250. Nothing remains of the Roman fort or the original motte and bailey castle. The Keep is a Grade I listed building, and a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The Castle Keep and Black Gate pre-date the construction of the Newcastle town wall, construction of which started around 1265, and did not include it. The site of the keep is in the centre of Newcastle and lies to the east of Newcastle station. The gap between the Keep and the Gatehouse is almost entirely filled by the railway viaduct that carries the East Coast Main Line from Newcastle to Scotland. The Keep and Black Gate are now managed by the Old Newcastle Project under the Heart of the City Partnership as one combined visitor attraction, \\"Newcastle Castle\\". Earliest history In the mid-2nd century, the Romans built the first bridge to cross the River Tyne at the place where Newcastle now stands. The bridge was called Pons Aelius or ‚ÄòBridge of Aelius‚Äô, Aelius being the family name of the Emperor Hadrian, who instigated the building of Hadrian's Wall along the Tyne-Solway Gap. The Romans built a fort to protect the river crossing which was at the foot of the Tyne Gorge. The fort was situated on a rocky outcrop overlooking the new bridge.Harbottle, p. 1 At some unknown time in the Anglo-Saxon age, the site of Newcastle came to be known as Monkchester. In the late 7th century, a cemetery was established on the site of the Roman fort. Norman castle In 1080, the Norman king, William I, sent his eldest son, Robert Curthose, north to defend the kingdom against the Scots. After his campaign, he moved to Monkchester and began the building of a ‚ÄòNew Castle‚Äô. This was of the \\"motte-and-bailey\\" type of construction, a wooden tower on top of an earthen mound (motte), surrounded by a moat and wooden stockade (bailey).Harbottle, p. 2 In 1095, Robert de Mowbray, Earl of Northumbria, rose up against William Rufus and Rufus sent an army north to crush the revolt and to capture the castle. From then on the castle became crown property and was an important base from which the king could control the northern barons. The new stone castle The castle in 1814. A view of the interior in 1814. Not a trace of the tower or mound of the motte and bailey castle remains now. Henry II replaced it with a rectangular stone keep, which was built between 1172 and 1177 at a cost of ¬£1,444. A stone bailey, in the form of a triangle, replaced the previous wooden one. The master mason or architect, Maurice, also built Dover Castle. The great outer gateway to the castle, called ‚Äòthe Black Gate‚Äô, was built later, between 1247 and 1250, in the reign of Henry III. During the civil wars at the end of King John's reign, it was under the control of Philip of Oldcoates. Additional protection to the castle was provided late in the 13th century when stone walls were constructed, with towers, to enclose the town. The safety provided by the town walls led to the neglect of the fabric of the castle. In 1589, during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I the castle was described as being ruinous.Harbottle, p. 4 From the early 17th century onward, this situation was made worse by the construction of shops and houses on much of the site. English Civil War In 1643, during the English Civil War, the Royalist Mayor of Newcastle, Sir John Marley, repaired the keep and probably also refortified the castle. In 1644 the Scottish army crossed the border in support of the Parliamentarians and the Scottish troops besieged Newcastle for three months until the garrison surrendered. The town walls were extensively damaged and the final forces to surrender on 19 October 1644 did so from the Castle keep.Harbottle, p. 5 During the 16th to the 18th century, the keep was used as a prison. By 1800, there were a large number of houses within the boundaries of the castle.Harbottle, p. 6 Nineteenth century In 1809, Newcastle Corporation bought the keep and provided it with a roof and battlements. In addition the private dwellings within the castle boundaries were demolished. The keep was restored in 1810, 1812 and 1848. In the mid 19th century the arrival of the railway in Newcastle led to a viaduct to be constructed to the north of the keep and crossing the site of the castle. As a result, only the keep and the Black Gate now remain. Twentieth century Newcastle Keep in 1991 The keep was restored between the 1960s and 1980s when crumbling outside stonework was replaced and the interior cleaned. The Black Gate The Black Gate from the west. An external lift has now been added on its north side, to improve access. The \\"Black Gate\\" was added to Newcastle Castle between 1247 and 1250, forming an additional barbican in front of the earlier north gate of the castle. It consisted of two towers with a passage running between them. On either side of the passage was a vaulted guardroom. There was a drawbridge at the front (facing west) and another at the rear. There was also a portcullis which could be raised and lowered to seal the entrance passage. The original building would probably have had a flat roof, but in 1618 James I leased the gatehouse to a courtier, Alexander Stephenson. Stephenson substantially altered the gatehouse, rebuilding the upper floors. Stephenson then let the Black Gate out to various tenants, one of whom was a merchant, named Patrick Black. It was he who gave his name to the Black Gate.Harbottle, p. 21 Eventually houses were built along both sides of the passageway, and one part of the building became a public house. By the early part of the nineteenth century, the Black Gate had become a slum tenement, housing up to sixty people. Blackgate was leased to the Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne in the 1880s, which extensively restored it between 1883 and 1885. It was the Society that added the top floor and pitched roof. The Society has held regular meetings there ever since. The drawbridges to the front and rear have been replaced by wooden footbridges. Current building Newcastle station's island platform. Brand new steam locomotive 60163 Tornado stands to the left The Keep is a Grade I listed building, and a Scheduled Ancient Monument. It is a roughly square building, measuring by and tall. The entrance leads via flights of stairs to the second floor and into the Great Hall, the largest room in the keep, measuring by . The Black Gate was approached via a drawbridge across a moat. A wooden bridge has replaced the drawbridge. The original gate had a portcullis, and the recesses where this fitted can still be seen. The keep is currently owned by Newcastle City Council and managed by the Heart of the City Partnership. The Castle Keep can be visited today. The keep is also notable in having the main East Coast railway line running through the centre of the grounds. In particular, the battlements offer fine views over the River Tyne quayside, the cathedral and Newcastle station. The castle is reputedly haunted, and has been subject to many paranormal investigations. It featured in an episode of Most Haunted. The Castle Keep and the Black Gate have recently been refurbished by the Heart of the City partnership and reopened on 21 March 2015 as Newcastle Castle. In addition to improved accessibility, new additions include an education centre, reception/gift shop and museum room in the Black Gate and audio-visual installations in the Castle Keep, telling the story of the site and the people who have lived there over the years.

The response was immediate, and soon, ‚ÄúThe Red Menace‚Äù numbered in the hundreds. Lee Roy Lucero and fellow Cherrysilver.com operator Dom Zarella began working with the athletics department to sell tickets for the group at a discounted rate and they advertised it on their Web site. After year three TheRedMenace.com started attending Lobo football practices and writing daily reports becoming the first media outlet in the state of New Mexico to take such an active interest in UNM football. Since that time TRM as it is affectionately known has published thousands of practice, game, and recruiting reports interviewing thousands of players. Notoriety Red Menace fans carry a notorious reputation for their fondness of face-painting, colorful attire, and barking like a dog for approximately three straight hours. In addition, University of New Mexico football players participate in the famous ‚ÄúLobo Leap‚Äù, where the players leap and celebrate with the fans following every game. TheRedMenace.com is celebrating their 15th year in existence with Lee Roy Lucero still at the helm. His writers include Wes Henderson and Rudy Chavez.

The first iteration was an antihero character appearing in The Flash series of comics. The second was a superhero (and sometimes supervillain) having a recurring role in Superman stories, and the remaining two first appeared in 2013 and 2017, respectively. The Flash Eradicator was created by Carmine Infantino and Cary Bates and first appeared in The Flash #314. The first Superman character was created by writer Roger Stern and artist Curt Swan, and first appeared in Action Comics Annual #2 (1989). Eradicator publication history The Eradicator first appeared in Action Comics Annual #2 in 1989. The Day of the Krypton Man story arc prominently featured the Eradicator in the pages of Superman, Adventures of Superman, and Action Comics. The story arc ran for six issues cover-dated March and April 1990, and was collected in Superman: Eradication! The Eradicator reappeared in Superman: The Man of Steel #1 as a humanoid being composed of energy. In Action Comics #687 (June 1993), the character appeared as The Last Son of Krypton, and became the featured character in Action Comics through the Reign of the Supermen story arc, beginning with Action Comics #687-689. The character was \\"resurrected\\" in Action Comics #693 (November 1993) and then featured regularly in Outsiders, first appearing as a member of the team in issue 3. The character was featured in his own three-issue eponymous limited series in 1996. Fictional character biography In the distant past, a dying alien race creates a number of containment devices in which to preserve their culture. They send them into space with contact teams, intent on meeting other civilizations. When a small group of these aliens arrives on the planet Krypton, they are met by the militant Kem-L, who kills them and corrupts one of the devices. Its new mission is to preserve his ideal of Kryptonian culture by eradicating all others ‚Äî and thus the device becomes known as the \\"Eradicator.\\" In its original form, the Eradicator resembles a stylized small rocket. Its top section is a prolate spheroid, which exudes a blue glow and is approximately three times the size of an egg. This is connected via four thin mounting brackets to a glossy orange tail fin section of equal length. The ten equally spaced fins each have the shape of a pointed quarter ellipse, with the tapered end extending slightly beyond the rear of the squat main cylindrical body tube. On Krypton, the Eradicator does all that it could over the years to protect Kryptonians, even from themselves. When a group of Kryptonian explorers leave Krypton in search of a new planet to colonize, the Eradicator alters their birthing matrices and makes them fatally allergic to lead, thus creating Daxamites. To further ensure that nobody left Krypton, the Eradicator alters Kryptonians by encoding in them a genetic defect so that they will instantly perish if they leave their world. One of the surviving aliens, known as the Cleric, takes the Eradicator and leaves Krypton with a group of followers. Unfortunately, they die soon thereafter, as the Kryptonian genetic link to their home planet precludes their survival off- world. The Cleric keeps the Eradicator for 200,000 years, until he encounters Superman on Warworld, while Superman was in self-imposed exile from Earth due to his guilt over executing three Kryptonians from a pocket universe. With the device, the two exchange memories - which explains that Kal-El was able to leave Krypton thanks to genetic treatments his father had undergone to cure his DNA of the Eradicator's defect - and the Cleric has a vision of Superman in combat with Mongul. The Cleric wishes to save Superman's life, and the Eradicator transports Superman to the Cleric's asteroid. The Cleric notices that the device has changed to protect Krypton's sole survivor, and he and Superman use it to heal their wounds, both physical and spiritual. As they talk about their pasts, the Cleric assures Superman that his departure has only deprived his world of a great hero rather than sparing it from the threat he perceived he had become, confident that Kal-El would only have killed when he had no other choice to preserve justice. When the Cleric gives the Eradicator to Superman, he rapidly ages and dies as the link to the Eradicator extending his life is severed. Superman marks the Cleric's grave with his symbol to reflect the impact the Cleric had on him. =Later years= Although Superman initially kept the Eradicator as a simple memento, it eventually attempted to activate and psychologically convert Superman into a 'true' Kryptonian, causing him to adopt Kryptonian clothes and a more ruthless attitude as it assembled the Fortress of Solitude in Antarctica. Superman was initially untroubled by this, even after Professor Hamilton tried to point out how he had nearly killed the alien gladiator Draaga when he could have just defeated him and ended the bout, but when the Eradicator attempted to kill Jonathan Kent, Superman fought off its influence and hurled the Eradicator into the sun. The Eradicator's controlling consciousness was able to use the energy of the sun to give itself a humanoid form, but Superman and Hamilton were able to drain its energy back into the Fortress. After Superman was killed by Doomsday, the Fortress robots reactivated the Eradicator's consciousness, driving it to 'steal' Superman's body and take it to the Fortress. With Superman's body as a template, the Eradicator was able to create a new humanoid form for itself based on Superman's own, but dependent on Superman's corpse to act as a 'battery' for it, with Superman absorbing solar radiation that was then channeled into the Eradicator. As a result of this new form, the Eradicator came to believe itself to be Superman on some level, showing access to some of his memories- although it lacked his vision powers and instead fired energy blasts from its hands- but it also adopted a more ruthless approach, such as killing a would-be rapist and breaking a safecracker's hands. After Superman's body was restored to life, the Eradicator realized the truth of its nature and sacrificed itself to help restore Superman to full strength during the final confrontation with the Cyborg Superman. Following Superman's return, the Eradicator's apparently dead body was examined at S.T.A.R. Labs, and merged with Dr. David Connor. The merged Eradicator joined the Outsiders, and occasionally teamed up with Superman. The Eradicator dealt with Dr. Connor's personal life, and more of the device's history was revealed.Outsiders Vol. 2 #1-20 The original Eradicator program was revealed to still exist in the Fortress of Solitude's computers and, following the destruction of the Fortress in Superman's battle with Dominus, the Eradicator took the form of Kem-L, and again attempted to brainwash Superman. The David Connor Eradicator realized that the program was still active, and merged with the remains of the Fortress to control it. The Fortress-Eradicator took the form of a gigantic Kryptonian battlesuit, and gained a form of multiple personality disorder based on his conflicting programming. When it learned of the origin of Krypto, Superman's pet dog-like creature, a creature with amazing powers, the shock to the original directive of Kryptonian purity was enough to correct its programming. It then decided that this dog shouldn't exist and tried to destroy it and Superman held him in suspended animation in his new Fortress, eventually telling him Krypto's full origin once he had learned it himself. Most recently, the Eradicator returned to his humanoid form. He wears a new outfit which, like the \\"Krypton Man\\" costume, is a combination of elements from Superman's costume and Kryptonian robes. He has gained the ability to sense beings that should not be in the DC Universe, such as Mr. Majestic, which may be related to his original programming against alien influences. Later, the Eradicator was seriously injured by an OMAC. He was said during the Infinite Crisis to be in a coma at Steel's headquarters, Steelworks.52 #6 =Death= A new Eradicator has now surfaced in Markovia claiming to be an ambassador from New Krypton. Although he is not the original Eradicator, he has all the original's memories. While Eradicator helped Geo-Force in Markovia, Doomsday appeared and attacked him. Eradicator was quickly defeated and abducted. Later, after realizing Steel, Superboy, and Supergirl had also been abducted, they all worked together to try to escape. Superman showed up to help, but in the end Eradicator was killed by a new, more evolved Doomsday. However, realizing that the new Doomsday was one of a series of clones created by Lex Luthor to keep Superman distracted, the Eradicator was able to transfer his consciousness into the comatose body of the original Doomsday. Using the original Doomsday as his host, the Eradicator was able to help the other heroes contain the Doomsday clones, eventually sacrificing himself to destroy the other clones by trapping them in a pocket dimension.Reign of Doomsday #3 Eradicator II (Supergirl) This Eradicator was a probe created by Supergirl's fortress to destroy the clone of its \\"master\\" which it first thought was Power Girl and later believed was Supergirl herself.Supergirl Vol. 6 #20 (July, 2013). DC Comics. Rebirth Another Eradicator made its debut in the 2016 relaunch initiative DC Rebirth, in Superman #2 (July, 2016). After Superman and his son, Jonathan, defeat an aquatic creature forced to terrorize a crew aboard an icebreaker, the Eradicator (in its spherical form) absorbs blood left over from Jonathan, detecting that he is human and Kryptonian and originates from the House of El. It flies to the Fortress of Solitude and is allowed to enter due to it containing Jonathan's genome. It begins to assimilate more Kryptonian genome as well as items belonging to Clark Kent. The Eradicator takes on a Superman- like appearance and declares that it will also save Kal-El.Superman Vol. 4 #2. DC Comics. This Eradicator is part of a group created by General Zod to seek out and arrest Kryptonian lawbreakers. They were directed to draw out the lawbreakers' life force and transfer them to a Phantom Zone projector, with the bodies being put into cryo-chambers to await trial. Seeing Superman's rocket leave Krypton as it explodes, the Eradicator sought out the passenger, going from solar system to solar system until discovering the Kryptonian DNA of Jonathan on Earth. Stating that the Kryptonian line must remain pure, the Eradicator attempts to purge the human DNA and starts to absorb Jonathan, but Krypto jumps in front of the beam and is absorbed. Superman then attacks the Eradicator.Superman Vol. 4 #3. DC Comics. Other versions * In a 2001‚Äì2002 storyline, Superman visited a version of Krypton which resembles the Silver Age version of the planet. However, unlike the Silver Age incarnation of the planet, this version includes \\"Eradicator assassins\\", giant robots used by General Zod and the Science Council as part of \\"the Eradicator solution\\", and later by Jor-El against Kryptonian religious zealots. Superman eventually discovered that this version of Krypton had been created as a trap for him by the villainous Brainiac 13, using the Eradicator Matrix, which he had stolen from the true Krypton along with Jor-El's diaries. The Eradicator Matrix is described as having been \\"designed to save Krypton by transforming a nearby husk of a planet into a habitable paradise\\"; Brainiac 13 uses it to transform a planet in the Phantom Zone into a replica of Krypton based on Jor-El's favorite period in Kryptonian history, and its inhabitants into Kryptonians. * In Action Comics #850 as a part of One Year Later, a flashback shows Jor-El muttering about \\"damned Eradicators\\" while preparing to send Kal-El into space. *The Eradicator was the name used by Senator Creed Phillips in the Flash. He patrolled the streets of Keystone and Central City as a vigilante who killed villains with his touch (which turned them to protoplasm) and had a split personality. He finally killed himself as his evil personality was trying to kill The Flash.Flash vol 1 #314-320 *In Tales from the Dark Multiverse: Death of Superman, after Superman is killed by Doomsday the Eradicator merges with Lois Lane, giving her Kryptonian powers and permanently becomes the new Eradicator. Powers and abilities In its original technological form, the Eradicator could teleport Superman from Warworld to Earth; manipulate molecular structures to create the Fortress of Solitude, synthetic Kryptonite, manipulate genetics to a great degree; keeping the Cleric alive for millennia; augmenting or bestowing special powers onto others like the virus which gave Jimmy Olsen temporary stretching powers. Holding sway over time/space Eradicator could retrieve Kryptonian technology from the past (implied to be through the Phantom Zone); manipulate vast quantities of energy to reshape entire planets/star systems or alternate weather patterns.Superman Vol 2 57 Even having psychic ability capable of influencing the minds of Superman and Matrix. The Eradicator's body was created from the genetic template of Superman's when the latter dies at the hands of Doomsday, giving the Eradicator physiology similar to a Kryptonian's (and to Superman's in particular). As a result, the Eradicator possesses similar powers to that of Superman, such as incredible strength, speed, reflexes, invulnerability, and flight. He also possesses ultra-acute senses but to a limited degree. Being a program from Krypton, the Eradicator possesses extensive knowledge of Krypton and is extremely intelligent, as well as having the ability to compute and process information at incredible speed. After his adoption of a Superman- derived body, he retains at least some of Superman's memories, as described above. Eradicator has abilities to absorb, convert, and release various forms of energy greater than those of natural Kryptonians, typically projecting energy as powerful blasts from his hands or eyes. He was able to survive exposure to massive amounts of kryptonite radiation. After the Eradicator and Mr. Majestic fought, Mr. Majestic altered the Eradicator's programming to make him more aware. The full extent of his programming alteration is unclear, although it has been shown that he can sense beings and gateways from alternate realities such as the Bleed.Majestic Vol. 1 #1. DC Comics. The program also had the ability to control and commandeer various technologies be they Kryptonian or Terran in nature, Eradicator could remotely connect to any and all the machinery within Superman's Fortress of Solitude or any technology made on earth at will.Action Comics Vol 1 #652Adventures of Superman Vol. 1 #480 Being a sentient device he/it can also store and manifest any kryptonian machinery from its person at will which greatly magnifies the droid units melee.Superman: Man of Steel Vol. 1 #114 Eradicator is made up of living energy, as such he is also capable of controlling physical density at will.Superman: Man of Steel Vol. 1 #114 (Jul. 2001) Able to become immaterial for a time in order to bypass attacks or even possess people's bodies if need be.Action Comics Vol. 1 #903 In Rebirth publishing, Eradicators could use their energy based powers in order to store and ferry the collective quintessence of other Kryptonians, able to absorb the souls of whomever it wants in order to augment itself and store the essential soul of Krypton.Superman Vol. 4 #3. DC Comics. In other media =Film= * The Eradicator was in Kevin Smith's script for Superman Lives. In the film, he's created by Jor-EI, Superman's father, to be Superman's \\"protector\\" and to rescue him from death. He would appear as a humanoid and as a special suit used by Superman in the rejuvenation chamber in the Fortress of Solitude. * In Superman: Doomsday, which was based on The Death and Return of Superman, the Eradicator does not appear, but elements of his character are incorporated into the cloned Superman, and a robot butler in the Fortress of Solitude fulfills some of the Eradicator's plot functions. * The Eradicator as The Last Son of Krypton appears in The Death of Superman and its sequel, Reign of the Supermen. In both films, he is voiced by Charles Halford. This version is presented as a guardian program that was part of the rocket ship that carried Kal-El to Earth, with the Eradicator-Superman a holographic projection created by the Fortress as it attempts to heal Kal-El of the wounds sustained in battle with Doomsday. =Video games= * The Eradicator as The Last Son of Krypton appears as a playable character in The Death and Return of Superman. * The Eradicator in his DC Rebirth form appears as a playable character in Lego DC Super Villains. =Radio= British radio producer Dirk Maggs produced a Superman radio series for BBC Radio 5 in the 1990s. When the \\"Death of Superman\\" story arc happened in the comics, Maggs presented a very faithful, though much pared down version of the tale, which featured Stuart Milligan as Clark Kent/Superman, Lorelei King as Lois Lane, and William Hootkins as Lex Luthor. In the death-and-rebirth storyline, Milligan was double-cast as the Eradicator. The story arc was packaged for sale on cassette and CD as Superman: Doomsday and Beyond in the UK and as Superman Lives! in the US.

Anti-fouling paints are often applied as one component of multi-layer coating systems which may have other functions in addition to their antifouling properties, such as acting as a barrier against corrosion on metal hulls that will degrade and weaken the metal, or improving the flow of water past the hull of a fishing vesselAre foul-release paints for you? Coating calculator , National Fisherman or high- performance racing yachts. History In the Age of Sail, sailing vessels suffered severely from the growth of barnacles and weeds on the hull, called \\"fouling\\". Starting in the mid-1700s thin sheets of copper and approximately 100 years later, Muntz metal, were nailed onto the hull in an attempt to prevent marine growth. One famous example of the traditional use of metal sheathing is the clipper Cutty Sark, which is preserved as a museum ship in dry-dock at Greenwich in England. Marine growth affected performance (and profitability) in many ways. *The maximum speed of a ship decreases as its hull becomes fouled with marine growth, and its displacement increases. *Fouling hampers a ship's ability to sail upwind. *Some marine growth, such as shipworms, would bore into the hull causing severe damage over time. *The ship may transport harmful marine organisms to other areas. In an official 1900 Letter from the U.S. Navy to the U.S. Senate Committee on Naval Affairs, it was noted that the (British) Admiralty had considered a proposal in 1847 to limit the number of iron ships (only recently introduced into naval service) and even to consider the sale of all iron ships in its possession, due to significant problems with biofouling. However, once an antifouling paint \\"with very fair results\\" was found, the iron ships were instead retained and continued to be built. The Bonnington Chemical Works began marketing copper sulphide anti-fouling paint around 1850. During World War II, which included a substantial naval component, the U.S. Navy provided significant funding to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution to gather information and conduct research on marine biofouling and technologies for its prevention. This work was published as a book in 1952, the contents of which are available online as individual chapters. The third and final part of this book includes a number of chapters that go into the state of the art at that time for the formulation of anti-fouling paints. Lunn (1974) provides further history. Modern antifouling paints In modern times, antifouling paints are formulated with cuprous oxide (or other copper compounds) and/or other biocides‚Äîspecial chemicals which impede growth of barnacles, algae, and marine organisms. Historically, copper paints were red, leading to ship bottoms still being painted red today. \\"Soft\\", or ablative bottom paints slowly slough off in the water, releasing a copper or zinc based biocide into the water column. The movement of water increases the rate of this action. Ablative paints are widely used on the hulls of recreational vessels and typically are reapplied every 1-3 years. \\"Hard\\" bottom paints, or \\"nonsloughing\\" bottom paints, are made in several types. \\"Contact leaching\\" paints \\"create a porous film on the surface. Biocides are held in the pores, and released slowly.\\" Another type of hard bottom paint includes Teflon and silicone coatings which are too slippery for growth to stick. SealCoat systems, which must be professionally applied, dry with small fibers sticking out from the coating surface. These small fibers move in the water, preventing bottom growth from adhering. Environmental concerns In the 1960s and 1970s, commercial vessels commonly used bottom paints containing tributyltin, which has been banned in the International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-fouling Systems on Ships of the International Maritime Organization due to its serious toxic effects on marine life (such as the collapse of a French shellfish fishery). The Port of San Diego is investigating how to reduce copper input from copper- based antifouling coatings and Washington State has passed a law which may phase in a ban on copper antifouling coatings on recreational vessels beginning in January 2018. the same in May, 2011. However, despite the toxic chemistry bottom paint and its accumulation in water ways across the globe, a similar ban was rescinded in the Netherlands after the European Union's Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks concluded The Hague had insufficiently justified the law. In an expert opinion, the committee concluded the Netherlands government's explanation \\"does not provide sufficient sound scientific evidence to show that the use of copper-based antifouling paints in leisure boats presents significant environmental risk.\\" \\"Sloughing bottom paints\\", or \\"ablative\\" paints, are an older type of paint designed to create a hull coating which ablates (wears off) slowly, exposing a fresh layer of biocides. Scrubbing a hull with sloughing bottom paint while it is in the water releases its biocides into the environment. One way to reduce the environmental impact from hulls with sloughing bottom paint is to have them hauled out and cleaned at boatyards with a \\"closed loop\\" system.Selecting an anti-fouling paint , West Marine Some innovative bottom paints that do not rely on copper or tin have been developed in response to the increasing scrutiny that copper-based ablative bottom paints have received as environmental pollutants.http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-5573950/Fouling-out- coppers-glory-fades.html Fouling out: coppers glory fades as new bottom-paint research leads to improved antifouling treatments, National Fisherman, June 2006http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQK/is_6_10/ai_n15858063/ Will California terminate copper paint?, BNET, 2005 A possible future replacement for antifouling paint may be slime. A mesh would cover a ship's hull beneath which a series of pores would supply the slime compound. The compound would turn into a viscous slime on contact with water and coat the mesh. The slime would constantly slough off, carrying away micro-organisms and barnacle larvae.

As an industry- oriented alternative to a broader based junior college education, polytechnic graduates in Singapore are sought after for work or many continue to complete university degrees. In contrast to polytechnics in the United States and UK, polytechnics in Singapore admit majority of its students after secondary school which is after 10 years of formal education. Diplomas in a specialised area of study, for example Biomedical Science, are awarded after completing 3 years of studies. History Nanyang Polytechnic was established on 1 April 1992, and enrolled its first batch of students for its School of Health Sciences and School of Business Management in July 1992. The School of Engineering and the School of Information Technology were opened in July 1993. The French-Singapore Institute, German-Singapore Institute and the Japan- Singapore Institute were transferred from the Economic Development Board to the Polytechnic in February 1993. It originally operated from five temporary campuses (Bukit Merah: School of Business; Jurong: School of Engineering; Outram: School of Nursing; Tiong Bahru: School of Business; Yishun: School of Engineering, School of Information Technology) before moving to its permanent home in Ang Mo Kio in April 1998. The School of Design and School of Chemical and Life Sciences was set up in November 2000, followed by the School of Interactive and Digital Media in November 2006. Mr Chan Lee Mun took over as Principal and CEO in August 2007; Mr Lin Cheng Ton went on to head NYP International. Ms Jeanne Liew took over as Principal and CEO in July 2015. Location of NYP Campus Centre right Campus Spread over of land (about the size of 60 football fields), Nanyang Polytechnic is situated next to the Yio Chu Kang MRT station. The institution houses 14 administration blocks, three blocks for recreational and student development purposes and three blocks for staff accommodation. The campus is modelled on a town-centre concept to provide the conveniences of a self-contained \\"Teaching and Learning City\\". Facilities include a fully computerised library, laboratories, a Theatre for the Arts and an auditorium. Retail outlets on campus provide a variety of academic items as well as other leisure items. Sports facilities include track and field, adventure challenge park, gym, swimming pool, tennis court and rock-climbing walls. Badminton, table tennis, basketball and ping pong are available in the air-conditioned sports hall. An Olympic-sized swimming pool is located beside the sport hall. Supporting centres Foreign Language Centre The Foreign Language Centre offers language modules to NYP students. They can choose to learn a foreign language such as French, German, Japanese, or Business Mandarin. FLC organises cultural activities, exchange programmes and overseas trips to provide the students with more exposure to the languages. Academic schools Nanyang Polytechnic has seven academic schools, offering a variety of courses. * School of Business Management (SBM) * School of Chemical & Life Sciences (SCL) * School of Design (SDN) * School of Engineering (SEG) * School of Health & Social Sciences (SHSS) * School of Information Technology (SIT) * School of Interactive & Digital Media (SIDM) =School of Business Management= The Nanyang Polytechnic School of Business Management (NYP SBM) simulate a modern \\"Teaching Enterprise\\" environment that is both web-centric and in tune with the latest developments in the real business world. Students have an opportunity to work in an actual business environment, supported by the Business Services Group which operates a number of businesses in the school. Students are given a solid foundation in the key business modules in the first two years, and specialised subjects in the second and final year of study. =School of Chemical and Life Sciences= The Nanyang Polytechnic School of Chemical and Life Sciences (NYP SCL) is in Singapore. Field trips to pharmaceutical plants and research institutes provide learning experience for the students. Under the Polytechnic's Industrial Attachment program, students can gain first-hand learning experience of the life science industry before they graduate. Opportunities for attachment to companies overseas are also available under the Overseas Industrial Placement Programme where students can gain an international perspective on Chemical & Life Sciences and be exposed to foreign cultures, work styles and economic environments. The School of Chemical & Life Sciences is headed by two directors; one looking into Life Sciences, the other into Chemical Sciences. Diploma courses under the Life Sciences division are Dip. Molecular Biotechnology, Dip. Food Science (offered since 2006), and the Dip. Pharmaceutical Sciences (offered in April 2007, with beginnings from the Pharmaceutical & Clinical Trials track under the Molecular Biotechnology programme in 2004). The only diploma course under the Chemical division is Dip. Chemical & Pharmaceutical Technology. Diploma in Chemical and Pharmaceutical Technology (Dip. CPT) prepares students in petro-chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturing industries. The course does not prepare students to work in pharmacies as retail executives or pharmacy technicians. Such career prospects are only applicable to the Dip. Pharmaceutical Sciences. Rather, graduates from Dip. CPT are able to work at manufacturing plants, Jurong Island, and other petro-chemical industries. =School of Design= The Nanyang Polytechnic School of Design (NYP SDN) in Singapore is a technical school providing training in industrial design, space and interior design and visual communications. =School of Information Technology= The Nanyang Polytechnic School of Information Technology (NYP SIT) is one of the founding schools of Nanyang Polytechnic and started in July 1993.

It is the state of someone who is \\"functioning at a satisfactory level of emotional and behavioral adjustment\\". From the perspectives of positive psychology or of holism, mental health may include an individual's ability to enjoy life and to create a balance between life activities and efforts to achieve psychological resilience. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), mental health includes \\"subjective well-being, perceived self-efficacy, autonomy, competence, intergenerational dependence, and self- actualization of one's intellectual and emotional potential, among others\\". The WHO further states that the well-being of an individual is encompassed in the realization of their abilities, coping with normal stresses of life, productive work, and contribution to their community. Cultural differences, subjective assessments, and competing professional theories all affect how one defines \\"mental health\\". Mental health and mental illness According to the U.K. Surgeon Journal (1999), mental health is the successful performance of the mental function resulting in productive activities, fulfilling relationships with other people, and providing the ability to adapt to change and cope with adversity. The term mental illness refers collectively to all diagnosable mental disorders‚Äîhealth conditions characterized by alterations in thinking, mood, or behavior associated with distress or impaired functioning.National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, 2011 Mental health and mental illness are two continuous concepts. People with optimal mental health can also have a mental illness, and people who have no mental illness can also have poor mental health. Mental Health should be a priority. Mental health problems may arise due to stress, loneliness, depression, anxiety, relationship problems, death of a loved one, suicidal thoughts, grief, addiction, ADHD, self-harm, various mood disorders, or other mental illnesses of varying degrees, as well as learning disabilities. Therapists, psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, nurse practitioners, or family physicians can help manage mental illness with treatments such as therapy, counseling, or medication. History = Early History = Globally in early history, mental illness was viewed as a religious matter. In ancient Greek, Roman, Egyptian, and Indian writings, mental illness was viewed as a personal issue and religious castigation. In the 5th century B.C., Hippocrates was the first pioneer to address mental illness through medication or adjustments in a patient‚Äôs environment. Although his work was greatly influential, views on religious punishment and demonic possession persisted through the Middle Ages. = U.S. History = In the mid-19th century, William Sweetser was the first to coin the term mental hygiene, which can be seen as the precursor to contemporary approaches to work on promoting positive mental health. Isaac Ray, the fourth president of the American Psychiatric Association and one of its founders, further defined mental hygiene as \\"the art of preserving the mind against all incidents and influences calculated to deteriorate its qualities, impair its energies, or derange its movements\\". In American history, mentally ill patients were thought to be religiously punished. This response persisted through the 1700s, along with inhumane confinement and stigmatization of such individuals. Dorothea Dix (1802‚Äì1887) was an important figure in the development of the \\"mental hygiene\\" movement. Dix was a school teacher who endeavored to help people with mental disorders and to expose the sub-standard conditions into which they were put.Barlow, D.H., Durand, V.M., Steward, S.H. (2009). Abnormal psychology: An integrative approach (Second Canadian Edition). Toronto: Nelson. p. 16 This became known as the \\"mental hygiene movement\\". Before this movement, it was not uncommon that people affected by mental illness would be considerably neglected, often left alone in deplorable conditions without sufficient clothing. From 1840-1880, she won over the support of the federal government to set up over 30 state psychiatric hospitals; however, they were understaffed, under-resourced, and were accused of violating human rights. Emil Kraepelin in 1896 developed the taxonomy of mental disorders which has dominated the field for nearly 80 years. Later, the proposed disease model of abnormality was subjected to analysis and considered normality to be relative to the physical, geographical and cultural aspects of the defining group. At the beginning of the 20th century, Clifford Beers founded \\"Mental Health America ‚Äì National Committee for Mental Hygiene\\", after publication of his accounts as a patient in several lunatic asylums, A Mind That Found Itself, in 1908Amanda Peck (2013),Mental Health America ‚Äì Origins, Retrieved June 9, 2015, from The Social Welfare History Project. and opened the first outpatient mental health clinic in the United States.Clifford Beers Clinic. (2006, October 30). About Clifford Beers Clinic. Retrieved June 1, 2007, from CliffordBeers.org The mental hygiene movement, similarly to the social hygiene movement, had at times been associated with advocating eugenics and sterilisation of those considered too mentally deficient to be assisted into productive work and contented family life.Social Hygiene in 20th Century Britain Taylor & Francis, Page 80 to 83Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society: Hygiene Jacqueline S. Wilkie. In the post-WWII years, references to mental hygiene were gradually replaced by the term 'mental health' due to its positive aspect that evolves from the treatment of illness to preventive and promotive areas of healthcare. Marie Jahoda described six major, fundamental categories that can be used to categorize individuals who are mentally healthy. These include: a positive attitude towards the self, personal growth, integration, autonomy, a true perception of reality, and environmental mastery, which include adaptability and healthy interpersonal relationships. = Bangladesh History = Mental health disorder considered a major public health concern and it constitutes about 13% of the Global Burden of disease and severe mental health disease may reduce each individual's life expectancy by about 20%. Low and middle-income countries have a higher burden of mental health disorder as it is not considered as a health problem as other chronic diseases. Being a low-income country, in Bangladesh mental health issues are highly stigmatized. A community-based study in the rural area of Bangladesh in 2000-2001 estimated that the burden of mental morbidity was 16.5% among rural people and most were suffering from mainly depression and anxiety and which was one-half and one-third of total cases respectively. Furthermore, the prevalence of mental disorders was higher in women in large families aged 45 years. However, there is still a lack of studies for MHCs( mental Health conditions) to raise awareness, knowledge development, and attitude of seeking medical treatment for MHCs in Bangladesh. People in rural areas often seek treatment from the traditional healers and these MHCs sometimes considered as a spiritual matters. = Deinstitutionalization / Transinstitutionalization = When state hospitals were accused of violating human right, advocates pushed for deinstitutionalization: the replacement of federal mental hospitals for community mental health services. The closure of state-provisioned psychiatric hospitals was enforced by the Community Mental Health Centers Act in 1963 that laid out terms in which only patients who posed an imminent danger to others or themselves could be admitted into state facilities. This was seen as an improvement from previous conditions, however, there still remains a debate on the conditions of these community resources. It has been proven that this transition was beneficial for many patients: there was an increase in overall satisfaction, better quality of life, more friendships between patients, and not too costly. This proved to be true only in the circumstance that treatment facilities that had enough funding for staff and equipment as well as proper management. However, this idea is a polarizing issue. Critics of deinstitutionalization argue that poor living conditions prevailed, patients were lonely, and they did not acquire proper medical care in these treatment homes. Additionally, patients that were moved from state psychiatric care to nursing and residential homes had deficits in crucial aspects of their treatment. Some cases result in the shift of care from health workers to patients‚Äô families, where they do not have the proper funding or medical expertise to give proper care. On the other hand, patients that are treated in community mental health centers lack sufficient cancer testing, vaccinations, or otherwise regular medical check ups. Other critics of state deinstitutionalization argue that this was simply a transition to ‚Äútransinstitutionalization‚Äù, or the idea that prisons and state-provisioned hospitals are interdependent. In other words, patients become inmates. This draws on the Penrose Hypothesis of 1939, which theorized that there was an inverse relationship between prisons‚Äô population size and number of psychiatric hospital beds. This means that populations that require psychiatric mental care will transition between institutions, which in this case, includes state psychiatric hospitals and criminal justice systems. Thus, a decrease in available psychiatric hospital beds occurred at the same time as an increase in inmates. Although some are skeptical that this is due to other external factors, others will reason this conclusion to a lack of empathy for the mentally ill. There is no argument in the social stigmatization of those with mental illnesses, they have been widely marginalized and discriminated against in society. In this source, researchers analyze how most compensation prisoners (detainees who are unable or unwilling to pay a fine for petty crimes) are unemployed, homeless, and with an extraordinarily high degree of mental illnesses and substance abuse. Compensation prisoners then lose prospective job opportunities, face social marginalization, and lack access to resocialization programs which ultimately facilitate reoffending. The research sheds light on how the mentally ill ‚Äî and in this case, the poor‚Äî are further punished for certain circumstances that are beyond their control, and that this is a vicious cycle that repeats itself. Thus, prisons embody another state-provisioned mental hospital. Families of patients, advocates, and mental health professionals still call for the increase in more well-structured community facilities and treatment programs with a higher quality of long-term inpatient resources and care. With this more structured environment, the United States will continue with more access to mental health care and an increase in overall treatment of the mentally ill. Significance Mental illnesses are more common than cancer, diabetes, or heart disease. Over 26 percent of all Americans over the age of 18 meet the criteria for having a mental illness.National Institute of Mental Health, 2011 A World Health Organization (WHO) report estimates the global cost of mental illness at nearly $2.5 trillion (two-thirds in indirect costs) in 2010, with a projected increase to over $6 trillion by 2030. Evidence from the WHO suggests that nearly half of the world's population is affected by mental illness with an impact on their self-esteem, relationships and ability to function in everyday life. An individual's emotional health can impact their physical health. Poor mental health can lead to problems such as the ability to make adequate decisions and substance abuse. Good mental health can improve life quality whereas poor mental health can worsen it. According to Richards, Campania, & Muse-Burke, \\"There is growing evidence that is showing emotional abilities are associated with pro-social behaviors such as stress management and physical health.\\" Their research also concluded that people who lack emotional expression are inclined to anti-social behaviors (e.g., drug and alcohol abuse, physical fights, vandalism), which reflects ones mental health and suppressed emotions. Adults and children who face mental illness may experience social stigma, which can exacerbate the issues. =Youth prevalence = According to 2020 data, mental illnesses have a stagnant incidence among adults, but are increasing among the youth, categorized as 12 to 17 year olds. Approximately 13% of youth in the United States reported suffering from at least one major depressive episode in 2019-20, with the greatest increase (18%) in Oregon. Only 28% receive consistent treatment and 70% are left untreated. In lower income communities, it is more common to forego treatment as a result of financial resources. Being left untreated also leads to unhealthy coping mechanisms such as substance abuse, which in turn causes its own host of mental health issues. Perspectives =Mental well-being= Mental health can be seen as an unstable continuum, where an individual's mental health may have many different possible values. Mental wellness is generally viewed as a positive attribute, even if the person does not have any diagnosed mental health condition. This definition of mental health highlights emotional well-being, the capacity to live a full and creative life, and the flexibility to deal with life's inevitable challenges. Some discussions are formulated in terms of contentment or happiness. Many therapeutic systems and self-help books offer methods and philosophies espousing strategies and techniques vaunted as effective for further improving the mental wellness. Positive psychology is increasingly prominent in mental health. A holistic model of mental health generally includes concepts based upon anthropological, educational, psychological, religious, and sociological perspectives. There are also models as theoretical perspectives from personality, social, clinical, health and developmental psychology. The tripartite model of mental well-being views mental well-being as encompassing three components of emotional well-being, social well-being, and psychological well-being. Emotional well-being is defined as having high levels of positive emotions, whereas social and psychological well-being are defined as the presence of psychological and social skills and abilities that contribute to optimal functioning in daily life. The model has received empirical support across cultures. The Mental Health Continuum-Short Form (MHC-SF) is the most widely used scale to measure the tripartite model of mental well-being. = Children and young adults = Mental health and stability is a very important factor in a person's everyday life. The human brain develops many skills at an early age including social skills, behavioral skills, and one's way of thinking. Learning how to interact with others and how to focus on certain subjects are essential lessons to learn at a young age. This starts from the time we can talk all the way to when we are so old that we can barely walk. However, there are people in society who have difficulties with these skills and behave differently. A mental illness consist of a wide range of conditions that affects a person's mood, thinking, and behavior.proof missing About 26% of people in the United States, ages 18 and older, have been diagnosed with some kind of mental disorder. However, not much is said about children with mental illnesses even though there are many that develop one, even as early as age three. The most common mental illnesses in children include, but are not limited to anxiety disorder, as well as depression in older children and teens. Having a mental illness at a younger age is different from having one in adulthood. Children's brains are still developing and will continue to develop until around the age of twenty-five. When a mental illness is thrown into the mix, it becomes significantly harder for a child to acquire the necessary skills and habits that people use throughout the day. For example, behavioral skills don't develop as fast as motor or sensory skills do. So when a child has an anxiety disorder, they begin to lack proper social interaction and associate many ordinary things with intense fear. This can be scary for the child because they don't necessarily understand why they act and think the way that they do. Many researchers say that parents should keep an eye on their child if they have any reason to believe that something is slightly off. If the children are evaluated earlier, they become more acquainted to their disorder and treating it becomes part of their daily routine. This is opposed to adults who might not recover as quickly because it is more difficult for them to adapt when already being accustomed in a certain direction of life. Mental illness affects not only the person themselves, but the people around them. Friends and family also play an important role in the child's mental health stability and treatment. If the child is young, parents are the ones who evaluate their child and decide whether or not they need some form of help. Friends are a support system for the child and family as a whole. Living with a mental disorder is never easy, so it's always important to have people around to make the days a little easier. However, there are negative factors that come with the social aspect of mental illness as well. Parents are sometimes held responsible for their child's illness. People also say that the parents raised their children in a certain way or they acquired their behavior from them. Family and friends are sometimes so ashamed of the idea of being close to someone with a disorder that the child feels isolated and thinks that they have to hide their illness from others. When in reality, hiding it from people prevents the child from getting the right amount of social interaction and treatment in order to thrive in today's society. Stigmas are also a well- known factor in mental illness. A stigma is defined as ‚Äúa mark of disgrace associated with a particular circumstance, quality, or person.‚Äù Stigmas are used especially when it comes to the mentally disabled. People have this assumption that everyone with a mental problem, no matter how mild or severe, is automatically considered destructive or a criminal person. Thanks to the media, this idea has been planted in our brains from a young age. Watching movies about teens with depression or children with autism makes us think that all of the people that have a mental illness are like the ones on TV. In reality, the media displays an exaggerated version of most illnesses. Unfortunately, not many people know that, so they continue to belittle those with disorders. In a recent study, a majority of young people associate mental illness with extreme sadness or violent tendencies . Now that children are becoming more and more open to technology and the media itself, future generations will then continue to pair mental illness with negative thoughts. The media should be explaining that many people with psychiatric disorders like ADHD and anxiety, can live an ordinary life with the correct treatment and should not be punished for something they cannot help. Sueki, (2013) carried out a study titled ‚ÄúThe effect of suicide‚Äìrelated internet use on users‚Äô mental health: A longitudinal Study‚Äù. This study investigated the effects of suicide-related internet use on user's suicidal thoughts, predisposition to depression and anxiety and loneliness. The study consisted of 850 internet users; the data was obtained by carrying out a questionnaire amongst the participants. This study found that browsing websites related to suicide, and methods used to commit suicide, had a negative effect on suicidal thoughts and increased depression and anxiety tendencies. The study concluded that as suicide-related internet use adversely affected the mental health of certain age groups it may be prudent to reduce or control their exposure to these websites. These findings certainly suggest that the internet can indeed have a profoundly negative impact on our mental health. Psychiatrist Thomas Szasz compared that 50 years ago children were either categorized as good or bad, and today \\"all children are good, but some are mentally healthy and others are mentally ill\\". The social control and forced identity creation is the cause of many mental health problems among today's children. A behavior or misbehavior might not be an illness but exercise of their free will and today's immediacy in drug administration for every problem along with the legal over-guarding and regard of a child's status as a dependent shakes their personal self and invades their internal growth. = The homeless = Mental illness is not only prevalent among children and young adults, but also the homeless. it's evident that mental illness is impacting these people just as much as anybody. In an article written by Lisa Godman and her colleagues, they reference Smith‚Äôs research on the prevalence of PTSD among homeless people. His research stated \\"Homelessness itself is a risk factor for emotional disorder.\\" What this quote is saying is that being homeless itself can cause emotional disorder. Without looking for other reasons for emotional disorder and really looking at the simple fact that an individual is homeless can cause emotional disorder. Godman‚Äôs article stated \\"Recently, Smith ( 1991) investigated the prevalence of PTSD among a sample of 300 randomly selected homeless single women and mothers in St. Louis, Missouri. Using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS; Robins, 1981; Robins & Helzer, 1984), she found that 53% of the respondents could be diagnosed as exhibiting full-blown cases of PTSD.\\" As the source explains, the conclusion that was drawn from Smith‚Äôs investigation after studying 300 homeless individuals is that 53% of those people were eligible to be diagnosed with PTSD. She continues and states: \\"In addition, data from clinical observations, self-reports, and empirical studies suggest that at least two commonly reported symptoms of psychological trauma, social disaffiliation and learned helplessness are highly prevalent among homeless individuals and families.\\" Other datas were able to prove that PTSD and learned helplessness were two symptoms that were very much present among homeless individuals and families. The question would be how are these people being helped. This is evident that mental health among homeless is an issue existing but barely touched. In another article by Stephen W. Hwang and Rochelle E Garner, they talk about the ways that the homeless are getting actually getting help. It states \\"For homeless people with mental illness, case management linked to other services was effective in improving psychiatric symptoms, and assertive case management was effective in decreasing psychiatric hospitalizations and increasing outpatient contacts. For homeless people with substance abuse problems, case management resulted in greater decreases in substance use than did usual care.\\" The question would be how are these people being helped. As the source explained, case management provided by services was helpful in improving psychiatric symptoms. It also caused a decrease in substance use than usual media care.  Mental Health Among Refugees in Bangladesh The Rohingya from Myanmar are a large group of stateless people who experienced war, deprivation of social rights, and other cultural and political instability and they are currently residing in the southeastern part of Bangladesh as refugees. There are very little research has been done with their mental health status due to war, daily environmental stressors due to continuous displacement, historical trauma, and life in the refugee camp. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 148 Rohingya adults in the refugee camp in Bangladesh and the result indicated that people are suffering from post-Traumatic Stress Disorder(PTSD), Depression, somatic impairment, and other associated functional impairment as well. this study revealed that all these MHCs developed due to the high level of daily environmental stressors in the camp, also due to lack of food, lack of freedom of movement. =Prevention= Mental health is conventionally defined as a hybrid of absence of a mental disorder and presence of well- being. Focus is increasing on preventing mental disorders. Prevention is beginning to appear in mental health strategies, including the 2004 WHO report \\"Prevention of Mental Disorders\\", the 2008 EU \\"Pact for Mental Health\\" and the 2011 US National Prevention Strategy. Some commentators have argued that a pragmatic and practical approach to mental disorder prevention at work would be to treat it the same way as physical injury prevention. Prevention of a disorder at a young age may significantly decrease the chances that a child will suffer from a disorder later in life, and shall be the most efficient and effective measure from a public health perspective. Prevention may require the regular consultation of a physician for at least twice a year to detect any signs that reveal any mental health concerns. Similar to mandated health screenings, bills across the U.S. are being introduced to require mental health screenings for students attending public schools. Supporters of these bills hope to diagnose mental illnesses such as anxiety and depression in order to prevent self-harm and any harm induced on other students. Additionally, social media is becoming a resource for prevention. In 2004, the Mental Health Services Act began to fund marketing initiatives to educate the public on mental health. This California-based project is working to combat the negative perception with mental health and reduce the stigma associated with it. While social media can benefit mental health, it can also lead to deterioration if not managed properly. Limiting social media intake is beneficial . =Cultural and religious considerations= Mental health is a socially constructed and socially defined concept; that is, different societies, groups, cultures, institutions and professions have very different ways of conceptualizing its nature and causes, determining what is mentally healthy, and deciding what interventions, if any, are appropriate. Thus, different professionals will have different cultural, class, political and religious backgrounds, which will impact the methodology applied during treatment. In the context of deaf mental health care, it is necessary for professionals to have cultural competency of deaf and hard of hearing people and to understand how to properly rely on trained, qualified, and certified interpreters when working with culturally Deaf clients. Research has shown that there is stigma attached to mental illness.Office of the Deputy Prime Minister ‚Äì Social Exclusion Unit: \\"Factsheet 1: Stigma and Discrimination on Mental Health Grounds\\". 2004. Due to such stigma, individuals may resist 'labeling' and may be driven to respond to mental health diagnoses with denialism. Family caregivers of individuals with mental disorders may also suffer discrimination or face stigma. Addressing and eliminating the social stigma and perceived stigma attached to mental illness has been recognized as crucial to education and awareness surrounding mental health issues. In the United Kingdom, the Royal College of Psychiatrists organized the campaign Changing Minds (1998‚Äì2003) to help reduce stigma,Royal College of Psychiatrists: Changing Minds. while in the United States, efforts by entities such as the Born This Way Foundation and The Manic Monologues specifically focus on removing stigma surrounding mental illness. The National Alliance on Mental Illness is a U.S. institution founded in 1979 to represent and advocate for those struggling with mental health issues. NAMI helps to educate about mental illnesses and health issues, while also working to eliminate stigma attached to these disorders. Many mental health professionals are beginning to, or already understand, the importance of competency in religious diversity and spirituality. They are also partaking in cultural training in order to better understand which interventions work best for these different groups of people. The American Psychological Association explicitly states that religion must be respected. Education in spiritual and religious matters is also required by the American Psychiatric Association, however, far less attention is paid to the damage that more rigid, fundamentalist faiths commonly practiced in the United States can cause. This theme has been widely politicized in 2018 such as with the creation of the Religious Liberty Task Force in July of that year. In addition, many providers and practitioners in the United States are only beginning to realize that the institution of mental healthcare lacks knowledge and competence of many non-Western cultures, leaving providers in the United States ill-equipped to treat patients from different cultures. Emotional improvement Unemployment has been shown to have a negative impact on an individual's emotional well-being, self-esteem and more broadly their mental health. Increasing unemployment has been shown to have a significant impact on mental health, predominantly depressive disorders. This is an important consideration when reviewing the triggers for mental health disorders in any population survey. In order to improve your emotional mental health, the root of the issue has to be resolved. \\"Prevention emphasizes the avoidance of risk factors; promotion aims to enhance an individual's ability to achieve a positive sense of self-esteem, mastery, well-being, and social inclusion.\\" It is very important to improve your emotional mental health by surrounding yourself with positive relationships. We as humans, feed off companionships and interaction with other people. Another way to improve your emotional mental health is participating in activities that can allow you to relax and take time for yourself. Yoga is a great example of an activity that calms your entire body and nerves. According to a study on well-being by Richards, Campania and Muse-Burke, \\"mindfulness is considered to be a purposeful state, it may be that those who practice it believe in its importance and value being mindful, so that valuing of self- care activities may influence the intentional component of mindfulness.\\" =Care navigation= Mental health care navigation helps to guide patients and families through the fragmented, often confusing mental health industries. Care navigators work closely with patients and families through discussion and collaboration to provide information on best therapies as well as referrals to practitioners and facilities specializing in particular forms of emotional improvement. The difference between therapy and care navigation is that the care navigation process provides information and directs patients to therapy rather than providing therapy. Still, care navigators may offer diagnosis and treatment planning. Though many care navigators are also trained therapists and doctors. Care navigation is the link between the patient and the below therapies. A clear recognition that mental health requires medical intervention was demonstrated in a study by Kessler et al. of the prevalence and treatment of mental disorders from 1990 to 2003 in the United States. Despite the prevalence of mental health disorders remaining unchanged during this period, the number of patients seeking treatment for mental disorders increased threefold.  Care for Mental Health In Bangladesh  It is always important to take psychiatric care for the patient with mental health illness. Although it is considered a stigmatized and spiritual matter sometimes, however nowadays very few people in Bangladesh are getting aware of these things and seeking medical treatment and psychosocial counseling for their betterment. A study conducted in 2008 stated that only 16% of patients came directly to the Mental Health Practitioner with a mean delay of 10.5 months of the onset of mental illness, which made them more vulnerable in many ways. The matter of concern is, 22% patient went for the religious or traditional healer and 12% rural medical practitioner with the least delay of 2-2.5 weeks. There is a significant role of family members to make the decision for seeking medical treatment for the patient. Unfortunately being a low-income and overpopulated country it is not always possible to provide adequate support, knowledge, and awareness programme regarding Mental Health issues where meanwhile the country is still struggling with poverty, hunger, malnutrition. Although many people came forward voluntarily to overcome this situation by providing free counseling sessions by mental health experts and support groups. Emotional issues unequal rich countries|alt=|left Emotional mental disorders are a leading cause of disabilities worldwide. Investigating the degree and severity of untreated emotional mental disorders throughout the world is a top priority of the World Mental Health (WMH) survey initiative, which was created in 1998 by the World Health Organization (WHO). \\"Neuropsychiatric disorders are the leading causes of disability worldwide, accounting for 37% of all healthy life years lost through disease.These disorders are most destructive to low and middle-income countries due to their inability to provide their citizens with proper aid. Despite modern treatment and rehabilitation for emotional mental health disorders, \\"even economically advantaged societies have competing priorities and budgetary constraints\\". The World Mental Health survey initiative has suggested a plan for countries to redesign their mental health care systems to best allocate resources. \\"A first step is documentation of services being used and the extent and nature of unmet needs for treatment. A second step could be to do a cross-national comparison of service use and unmet needs in countries with different mental health care systems. Such comparisons can help to uncover optimum financing, national policies, and delivery systems for mental health care.\\" Knowledge of how to provide effective emotional mental health care has become imperative worldwide. Unfortunately, most countries have insufficient data to guide decisions, absent or competing visions for resources, and near constant pressures to cut insurance and entitlements. WMH surveys were done in Africa (Nigeria, South Africa), the Americas (Colombia, Mexico, United States), Asia and the Pacific (Japan, New Zealand, Beijing and Shanghai in the People's Republic of China), Europe (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Ukraine), and the middle east (Israel, Lebanon). Countries were classified with World Bank criteria as low-income (Nigeria), lower middle-income (China, Colombia, South Africa, Ukraine), higher middle- income (Lebanon, Mexico), and high-income. The coordinated surveys on emotional mental health disorders, their severity, and treatments were implemented in the aforementioned countries. These surveys assessed the frequency, types, and adequacy of mental health service use in 17 countries in which WMH surveys are complete. The WMH also examined unmet needs for treatment in strata defined by the seriousness of mental disorders. Their research showed that \\"the number of respondents using any 12-month mental health service was generally lower in developing than in developed countries, and the proportion receiving services tended to correspond to countries' percentages of gross domestic product spent on health care\\". \\"High levels of unmet need worldwide are not surprising, since WHO Project ATLAS' findings of much lower mental health expenditures than was suggested by the magnitude of burdens from mental illnesses. Generally, unmet needs in low-income and middle-income countries might be attributable to these nations spending reduced amounts (usually <1%) of already diminished health budgets on mental health care, and they rely heavily on out-of-pocket spending by citizens who are ill-equipped for it\\". Treatment =Modern methods of treatment=  Pharmacotherapy  Pharmacotherapy is therapy that uses pharmaceutical drugs. Pharmacotherapy is used in the treatment of mental illness through the use of antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and the use of elements such as lithium.  Physical activity  For some people, physical exercise can improve mental as well as physical health. Playing sports, walking, cycling or doing any form of physical activity trigger the production of various hormones, sometimes including endorphins, which can elevate a person's mood. Studies have shown that in some cases, physical activity can have the same impact as antidepressants when treating depression and anxiety. Moreover, cessation of physical exercise may have adverse effects on some mental health conditions, such as depression and anxiety. This could lead to many different negative outcomes such as obesity, skewed body image, lower levels of certain hormones, and many more health risks associated with mental illnesses. Activity therapies Activity therapies, also called recreation therapy and occupational therapy, promote healing through active engagement. Making crafts can be a part of occupational therapy. Walks can be a part of recreation therapy. In recent years colouring has been recognised as an activity which has been proven to significantly lower the levels of depressive symptoms and anxiety in many studies. Expressive therapies Expressive therapies or creative arts therapies are a form of psychotherapy that involves the arts or art-making. These therapies include art therapy, music therapy, drama therapy, dance therapy, and poetry therapy. It has been proven that Music therapy is an effective way of helping people who suffer from a mental health disorder.. Dramatherapy is approved by NICE for the treatment of psychosis.The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), Dramatherapy in Early Intervention in Psychosis, March 2019 https://www.nice.org.uk/sharedlearning/dramatherapy-in-early-intervention-in- psychosis Psychotherapy Psychotherapy is the general term for scientific based treatment of mental health issues based on modern medicine. It includes a number of schools, such as gestalt therapy, psychoanalysis, cognitive behavioral therapy, psychedelic therapy, transpersonal psychology/psychotherapy, and dialectical behavioral therapy. Group therapy involves any type of therapy that takes place in a setting involving multiple people. It can include psychodynamic groups, expressive therapy groups, support groups (including the Twelve-step program), problem-solving and psychoeducation groups. Meditation The practice of mindfulness meditation has several mental health benefits, such as bringing about reductions in depression, anxiety and stress. Mindfulness meditation may also be effective in treating substance use disorders. Further, mindfulness meditation appears to bring about favorable structural changes in the brain. The Heartfulness meditation program has proven to show significant improvements in the state of mind of health-care professionals. A study posted on the US National Library of Medicine showed that these professionals of varied stress levels were able to improve their conditions after this meditation program was conducted. They benefited in aspects of burnouts and emotional wellness. People with anxiety disorders participated in a stress- reduction program conducted by researchers from the Mental Health Service Line at the W.G. Hefner Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Salisbury, North Carolina. The participants practiced mindfulness meditation. After the study was over, it was concluded that the \\"mindfulness meditation training program can effectively reduce symptoms of anxiety and panic and can help maintain these reductions in patients with generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, or panic disorder with agoraphobia.\\"  Mental fitness  Mental fitness is a mental health movement that encourages people to intentionally regulate and maintain their emotional wellbeing through friendship, regular human contact and activities that include meditation, calming exercises, aerobic exercise, mindfulness, having a routine and maintaining adequate sleep. Mental fitness is intended to build resilience against every-day mental health challenges to prevent an escalation of anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation, and help them cope with the escalation of those feelings if they occur. Spiritual counseling Spiritual counsellors meet with people in need to offer comfort and support and to help them gain a better understanding of their issues and develop a problem-solving relation with spirituality. These types of counselors deliver care based on spiritual, psychological and theological principles. =Older methods of treatment=  Trepanation  Archaeological records have shown that trepanation was a procedure used to treat \\"headaches, insanities or epilepsy\\" in several parts of the world in the Stone age. It was a surgical process used in the Stone Age. Paul Broca studied trepanation and came up with his own theory on it. He noticed that the fractures on the skulls dug up weren't caused by wounds inflicted due to violence, but because of careful surgical procedures. \\"Doctors used sharpened stones to scrape the skull and drill holes into the head of the patient\\" to allow evil spirits which plagued the patient to escape. There were several patients that died in these procedures, but those that survived were revered and believed to possess \\"properties of a mystical order\\". Lobotomy Lobotomy was used in the 20th century as a common practice of alternative treatment for mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and depression. The first ever modern leucotomy meant for the purpose of treating a mental illness occurred in 1935 by a Portuguese neurologist, Antonio Egas Moniz. He received the Nobel Prize in medicine in 1949. . This belief that mental health illnesses could be treated by surgery came from Swiss neurologist, Gottlieb Burckhardt. After conducting experiments on six patients with schizophrenia, he claimed that half of his patients recovered or calmed down. Psychiatrist Walter Freeman believed that \\"an overload of emotions led to mental illness and ‚Äúthat cutting certain nerves in the brain could eliminate excess emotion and stabilize a personality\\", according to a National Public Radio article. Exorcisms \\"Exorcism is the religious or spiritual practice of evicting demons or other spiritual entities from a person, or an area, they are believed to have possessed.\\" Mental health illnesses such as Huntington's Disease (HD), Tourette syndrome and schizophrenia were believed to be signs of possession by the Devil. This led to several mentally ill patients being subjected to exorcisms. This practice has been around for a long time, though decreasing steadily until it reached a low in the 18th century. It seldom occurred until the 20th century when the numbers rose due to the attention the media was giving to exorcisms. Different belief systems practice exorcisms in different ways. Social work in mental health Social work in mental health, also called psychiatric social work, is a process where an individual in a setting is helped to attain freedom from overlapping internal and external problems (social and economic situations, family and other relationships, the physical and organizational environment, psychiatric symptoms, etc.). It aims for harmony, quality of life, self-actualization and personal adaptation across all systems. Psychiatric social workers are mental health professionals that can assist patients and their family members in coping with both mental health issues and various economic or social problems caused by mental illness or psychiatric dysfunctions and to attain improved mental health and well- being. They are vital members of the treatment teams in Departments of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences in hospitals. They are employed in both outpatient and inpatient settings of a hospital, nursing homes, state and local governments, substance abuse clinics, correctional facilities, health care services...etc. In the United States, social workers provide most of the mental health services. According to government sources, 60 percent of mental health professionals are clinically trained social workers, 10 percent are psychiatrists, 23 percent are psychologists, and 5 percent are psychiatric nurses.National Association of Social Workers, 2011 Mental health social workers in Japan have professional knowledge of health and welfare and skills essential for person's well-being. Their social work training enables them as a professional to carry out Consultation assistance for mental disabilities and their social reintegration; Consultation regarding the rehabilitation of the victims; Advice and guidance for post-discharge residence and re- employment after hospitalized care, for major life events in regular life, money and self-management and in other relevant matters in order to equip them to adapt in daily life. Social workers provide individual home visits for mentally ill and do welfare services available, with specialized training a range of procedural services are coordinated for home, workplace and school. In an administrative relationship, Psychiatric social workers provides consultation, leadership, conflict management and work direction. Psychiatric social workers who provides assessment and psychosocial interventions function as a clinician, counselor and municipal staff of the health centers. =Roles and functions= Social workers play many roles in mental health settings, including those of case manager, advocate, administrator, and therapist. The major functions of a psychiatric social worker are promotion and prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation. Social workers may also practice: * Counseling and psychotherapy * Case management and support services * Crisis intervention * Psychoeducation * Psychiatric rehabilitation and recovery * Care coordination and monitoring * Program management/administration * Program, policy and resource development * Research and evaluation Psychiatric social workers conduct psychosocial assessments of the patients and work to enhance patient and family communications with the medical team members and ensure the inter-professional cordiality in the team to secure patients with the best possible care and to be active partners in their care planning. Depending upon the requirement, social workers are often involved in illness education, counseling and psychotherapy. In all areas, they are pivotal to the aftercare process to facilitate a careful transition back to family and community. =History= United States During the 1840s, Dorothea Lynde Dix, a retired Boston teacher who is considered the founder of the Mental Health Movement, began a crusade that would change the way people with mental disorders were viewed and treated. Dix was not a social worker; the profession was not established until after her death in 1887. However, her life and work were embraced by early psychiatric social workers, and she is considered one of the pioneers of psychiatric social work along with Elizabeth Horton, who in 1907 was the first psychiatric social worker in the New York hospital system, and others.Rossi, 1969Shapiro, 1994 The early twentieth century was a time of progressive change in attitudes towards mental illness. Community Mental Health Centers Act was passed in 1963. This policy encouraged the deinstitutionalisation of people with mental illness. Later, mental health consumer movement came by 1980s. A consumer was defined as a person who has received or is currently receiving services for a psychiatric condition. People with mental disorders and their families became advocates for better care. Building public understanding and awareness through consumer advocacy helped bring mental illness and its treatment into mainstream medicine and social services.Ralph & Corrigan, 2005 In the 2000s focus was on Managed care movement which aimed at a health care delivery system to eliminate unnecessary and inappropriate care in order to reduce costs & Recovery movement in which by principle acknowledges that many people with serious mental illness spontaneously recover and others recover and improve with proper treatment.SAMHSA, 2004 Role of social workers made an impact with 2003 invasion of Iraq and War in Afghanistan (2001‚Äìpresent) social workers worked out of the NATO hospital in Afghanistan and Iraq bases. They made visits to provide counseling services at forward operating bases. Twenty-two percent of the clients were diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, 17 percent with depression, and 7 percent with alcohol abuse. In 2009, a high level of suicides was reached among active-duty soldiers: 160 confirmed or suspected Army suicides. In 2008, the Marine Corps had a record 52 suicides. The stress of long and repeated deployments to war zones, the dangerous and confusing nature of both wars, wavering public support for the wars, and reduced troop morale have all contributed to the escalating mental health issues. Military and civilian social workers are primary service providers in the veterans‚Äô health care system. Mental health services, is a loose network of services ranging from highly structured inpatient psychiatric units to informal support groups, where psychiatric social workers indulges in the diverse approaches in multiple settings along with other paraprofessional workers. Canada A role for psychiatric social workers was established early in Canada's history of service delivery in the field of population health. Native North Americans understood mental trouble as an indication of an individual who had lost their equilibrium with the sense of place and belonging in general, and with the rest of the group in particular. In native healing beliefs, health and mental health were inseparable, so similar combinations of natural and spiritual remedies were often employed to relieve both mental and physical illness. These communities and families greatly valued holistic approaches for preventive health care. Indigenous peoples in Canada have faced cultural oppression and social marginalization through the actions of European colonizers and their institutions since the earliest periods of contact. Culture contact brought with it many forms of depredation. Economic, political, and religious institutions of the European settlers all contributed to the displacement and oppression of indigenous people. The first officially recorded treatment practices were in 1714, when Quebec opened wards for the mentally ill. In the 1830s social services were active through charity organizations and church parishes (Social Gospel Movement). Asylums for the insane were opened in 1835 in Saint John and New Brunswick. In 1841 in Toronto care for the mentally ill became institutionally based. Canada became a self- governing dominion in 1867, retaining its ties to the British crown. During this period, age of industrial capitalism began and it lead to social and economic dislocation in many forms. By 1887 asylums were converted to hospitals, and nurses and attendants were employed for the care of the mentally ill. The first social work training began at the University of Toronto in 1914. In 1918 Clarence Hincks & Clifford Beers founded the Canadian National Committee for Mental Hygiene which later became the Canadian Mental Health Association. In the 1930s Dr. Clarence Hincks promoted prevention and of treating sufferers of mental illness before they were incapacitated/early detection. World War II profoundly affected attitudes towards mental health. The medical examinations of recruits revealed that thousands of apparently healthy adults suffered mental difficulties. This knowledge changed public attitudes towards mental health, and stimulated research into preventive measures and methods of treatment. In 1951 Mental Health Week was introduced across Canada. For the first half of the twentieth century, with a period of deinstitutionalisation beginning in the late 1960s psychiatric social work succeeded to the current emphasis on community-based care, psychiatric social work focused beyond the medical model's aspects on individual diagnosis to identify and address social inequities and structural issues. In the 1980s Mental Health Act was amended to give consumers the right to choose treatment alternatives. Later the focus shifted to workforce mental health issues and environmental root causes. India The earliest citing of mental disorders in India are from Vedic Era (2000 BC ‚Äì AD 600). Charaka Samhita, an ayurvedic textbook believed to be from 400‚Äì200 BC describes various factors of mental stability. It also has instructions regarding how to set up a care delivery system.Lyons and Petrucelli, 1987 In the same era, Siddha was a medical system in south India. The great sage Agastya was one of the 18 siddhas contributing to a system of medicine. This system has included the Agastiyar Kirigai Nool, a compendium of psychiatric disorders and their recommended treatments.McGilvray, 1998Nichter, 1987 In Atharva Veda too there are descriptions and resolutions about mental health afflictions. In the Mughal period Unani system of medicine was introduced by an Indian physician Unhammad in 1222. The existing form of psychotherapy was known then as ilaj-i- nafsani in Unani medicine. The 18th century was a very unstable period in Indian history, which contributed to psychological and social chaos in the Indian subcontinent. In 1745, lunatic asylums were developed in Bombay (Mumbai) followed by Calcutta (Kolkata) in 1784, and Madras (Chennai) in 1794. The need to establish hospitals became more acute, first to treat and manage Englishmen and Indian 'sepoys' (military men) employed by the British East India Company. The First Lunacy Act (also called Act No. 36) that came into effect in 1858 was later modified by a committee appointed in Bengal in 1888. Later, the Indian Lunacy Act, 1912 was brought under this legislation. A rehabilitation programme was initiated between 1870s and 1890s for persons with mental illness at the Mysore Lunatic Asylum, and then an occupational therapy department was established during this period in almost each of the lunatic asylums. The programme in the asylum was called 'work therapy'. In this programme, persons with mental illness were involved in the field of agriculture for all activities. This programme is considered as the seed of origin of psychosocial rehabilitation in India. Berkeley-Hill, superintendent of the European Hospital (now known as the Central Institute of Psychiatry (CIP), established in 1918), was deeply concerned about the improvement of mental hospitals in those days. The sustained efforts of Berkeley-Hill helped to raise the standard of treatment and care and he also persuaded the government to change the term 'asylum' to 'hospital' in 1920. Techniques similar to the current token-economy were first started in 1920 and called by the name 'habit formation chart' at the CIP, Ranchi. In 1937, the first post of psychiatric social worker was created in the child guidance clinic run by the Dhorabji Tata School of Social Work (established in 1936), It is considered as the first documented evidence of social work practice in Indian mental health field. After Independence in 1947, general hospital psychiatry units (GHPUs) were established to improve conditions in existing hospitals, while at the same time encouraging outpatient care through these units. In Amritsar Dr. Vidyasagar, instituted active involvement of families in the care of persons with mental illness. This was advanced practice ahead of its times regarding treatment and care. This methodology had a greater impact on social work practice in the mental health field especially in reducing the stigmatisation. In 1948 Gauri Rani Banerjee, trained in the United States, started a master's course in medical and psychiatric social work at the Dhorabji Tata School of Social Work (Now TISS). Later the first trained psychiatric social worker was appointed in 1949 at the adult psychiatry unit of Yerwada Mental Hospital, Pune. In various parts of the country, in mental health service settings, social workers were employed‚Äîin 1956 at a mental hospital in Amritsar, in 1958 at a child guidance clinic of the college of nursing, and in Delhi in 1960 at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences and in 1962 at the Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital. In 1960, the Madras Mental Hospital (Now Institute of Mental Health), employed social workers to bridge the gap between doctors and patients. In 1961 the social work post was created at the NIMHANS. In these settings they took care of the psychosocial aspect of treatment. This system enabled social service practices to have a stronger long-term impact on mental health care.Dr. Ratna Varma, Psychiatric Social Work in India In 1966 by the recommendation Mental Health Advisory Committee, Ministry of Health, Government of India, NIMHANS commenced Department of Psychiatric Social Work started and a two-year Postgraduate Diploma in Psychiatric Social Work was introduced in 1968. In 1978, the nomenclature of the course was changed to MPhil in Psychiatric Social Work. Subsequently, a PhD Programme was introduced. By the recommendations Mudaliar committee in 1962, Diploma in Psychiatric Social Work was started in 1970 at the European Mental Hospital at Ranchi (now CIP). The program was upgraded and other higher training courses were added subsequently. A new initiative to integrate mental health with general health services started in 1975 in India. The Ministry of Health, Government of India formulated the National Mental Health Programme (NMHP) and launched it in 1982. The same was reviewed in 1995 and based on that, the District Mental Health Program (DMHP) was launched in 1996 which sought to integrate mental health care with public health care. This model has been implemented in all the states and currently there are 125 DMHP sites in India. National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) in 1998 and 2008 carried out systematic, intensive and critical examinations of mental hospitals in India. This resulted in recognition of the human rights of the persons with mental illness by the NHRC. From the NHRC's report as part of the NMHP, funds were provided for upgrading the facilities of mental hospitals. As a result of the study, it was revealed that there were more positive changes in the decade until the joint report of NHRC and NIMHANS in 2008 compared to the last 50 years until 1998.Nagaraja & Murthy, 2008 In 2016 Mental Health Care Bill was passed which ensures and legally entitles access to treatments with coverage from insurance, safeguarding dignity of the afflicted person, improving legal and healthcare access and allows for free medications. In December 2016, Disabilities Act 1995 was repealed with Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act (RPWD), 2016 from the 2014 Bill which ensures benefits for a wider population with disabilities. The Bill before becoming an Act was pushed for amendments by stakeholders mainly against alarming clauses in the \\"Equality and Non discrimination\\" section that diminishes the power of the act and allows establishments to overlook or discriminate against persons with disabilities and against the general lack of directives that requires to ensure the proper implementation of the Act.http://www.disabilityaffairs.gov.in/upload/uploadfiles/files/RPWD%20ACT%202016.pdf Mental health in India is in its developing stages. There aren't enough professionals to support the demand. According to the Indian Psychiatric Society, there are around 9000 psychiatrists only in the country as of January 2019. Going by this figure, India has 0.75 Psychiatrists per 100,000 population, while the desirable number is anything above 3 Psychiatrists per 100,000. While the number of psychiatrists has increased since 2010, it is still far from a healthy ratio. Lack of any universally accepted single licensing authority compared to foreign countries puts social workers at general in risk. But general bodies/councils accepts automatically a university-qualified social worker as a professional licensed to practice or as a qualified clinician. Lack of a centralized council in tie-up with Schools of Social Work also makes a decline in promotion for the scope of social workers as mental health professionals. Though in this midst the service of social workers has given a facelift to the mental health sector in the country with other allied professionals. Prevalence and programs Evidence suggests that 450 million people worldwide have some mental illness. Major depression ranks fourth among the top 10 leading causes of disease worldwide. By 2029, mental illness is predicted to become the leading cause of disease worldwide. Women are more likely to have a mental illness than men. One million people commit suicide every year and 10 to 20 million attempt it.Sowers, Rowe, & Clay, 2009 = Africa = Mental illnesses and mental health disorders are widespread concerns among underdeveloped African countries, yet these issues are largely neglected, as mental health care in Africa is given statistically less attention than it is in other, westernized nations. Rising death tolls due to mental illness demonstrate the imperative need for improved mental health care policies and advances in treatment for Africans suffering from psychological disorders. Underdeveloped African countries are so visibly troubled by physical illnesses, disease, malnutrition, and contamination that the dilemma of lacking mental health care has not been prioritized, makes it challenging to have a recognized impact on the African population. In 1988 and 1990, two original resolutions were implemented by the World Health Organization's Member States in Africa. AFR/RC39/R1 and AFR/RC40/R9 attempted to improve the status of mental health care in specific African regions to combat its growing effects on the African people. However, it was found that these new policies had little impact on the status of mental health in Africa, ultimately resulting in an incline in psychological disorders instead of the desired decline, and causing this to seem like an impossible problem to manage. In Africa, there are many socio-cultural and biological factors that have led to heightened psychological struggles, while also masking their immediate level of importance to the African eye. Increasing rates of unemployment, violence, crime, rape, and disease are often linked to substance abuse, which can cause mental illness rates to inflate. Additionally, physical disease like HIV/AIDS, the Ebola epidemic, and malaria often have lasting psychological effects on victims that go unrecognized in African communities because of their inherent cultural beliefs. Traditional African beliefs have led to the perception of mental illness as being caused by supernatural forces, preventing helpful or rational responses to abnormal behavior. For example, Ebola received loads of media attention when it became rampant in Africa and eventually spread to the US, however, researchers never really paid attention to its psychological effects on the African brain. Extreme anxiety, struggles with grief, feelings of rejection and incompetence, depression leading to suicide, PTSD, and much more are only some of the noted effects of diseases like Ebola. These epidemics come and go, but their lasting effects on mental health are remaining for years to come, and even ending lives because of the lack of action. There has been some effort to financially fund psychiatric support in countries like Liberia, due to its dramatic mental health crisis after warfare, but not much was benefited. Aside from financial reasons, it is so difficult to enforce mental health interventions and manage mental health in general in underdeveloped countries simply because the individuals living there do not necessarily believe in western psychiatry. It is also important to note that the socio-cultural model of psychology and abnormal behavior is dependent on factors surrounding cultural differences. This causes mental health abnormalities to remain more hidden due to the culture's natural behavior, compared to westernized behavior and cultural norms. This relationship between mental and physical illness is an ongoing cycle that has yet to be broken. While there are many organizations attempting to solve problems pertaining to physical health in Africa, as these problems are clearly visible and recognizable, there is little action taken to confront the underlying mental effects that are left on the victims. It is recognized that many of the mentally ill in Africa search for help from spiritual or religious leaders, however this is widely due to the fact that many African countries are significantly lacking in mental health professionals in comparison to the rest of the world. In Ethiopia alone, there are ‚Äúonly 10 psychiatrists for the population of 61 million people,‚Äù studies have shown. While numbers have definitely changed since this research was done, the lack of psychological professionals throughout African continues with a current average of 1.4 mental health workers per 100,000 people compared to the global statistic of 9.0 professionals per 100,00 people. Additionally, statistics show that the ‚Äúglobal annual rate of visits to mental health outpatient facilities is 1,051 per 100,000 population,‚Äù while ‚Äúin Africa the rate is 14 per 100,000‚Äù visits. About half of Africa's countries have some sort of mental health policy, however, these policies are highly disregarded, as Africa's government spends ‚Äúless than 1% of the total health budget on mental health‚Äù. Specifically in Sierra Leone, about 98.8% of people suffering from mental disorders remain untreated, even after the building of a well below average psychiatric hospital, further demonstrating the need for intervention. Not only has there been little hands-on action taken to combat mental health issues in Africa, but there has also been little research done on the topic to spread its awareness and prevent deaths. The Lancet Global Health acknowledges that there are well over 1,000 published articles covering physical health in Africa, but there are still less than 50 discussing mental health. And this pressing dilemma of prioritizing physical health vs. mental health is only worsening as the continent's population is substantially growing with research showing that ‚ÄúBetween 2000 and 2015 the continent's population grew by 49%, yet the number of years lost to disability as a result of mental and substance use disorders increased by 52%‚Äù. The number of deaths caused by mental instability is truly competing with those caused by physical diseases: ‚ÄúIn 2015, 17.9 million years were lost to disability as a consequence of mental health problems. Such disorders were almost as important a cause of years lost to disability as were infectious and parasitic diseases, which accounted for 18.5 million years lost to disability,‚Äù. Mental health and physical health care, while they may seem separate, are very much connected, as these two factors determine life or death for humans. As new challenges surface and old challenges still haven't been prioritized, Africa's mental health care policies need significant improvement in order to provide its people with the appropriate health care they deserve, hopefully preventing this problem from expanding. =Australia= A survey conducted by Australian Bureau of Statistics in 2008 regarding adults with manageable to severe neurosis reveals almost half of the population had a mental disorder at some point of their life and one in five people had a sustained disorder in the preceding 12 months. In neurotic disorders, 14% of the population experienced anxiety and comorbidity disorders were next to common mental disorder with vulnerability to substance abuse and relapses. There were distinct gender differences in disposition to mental health illness. Women were found to have high rate of mental health disorders, and Men had higher propensity of risk for substance abuse. The SMHWB survey showed families that had low socioeconomic status and high dysfunctional patterns had a greater proportional risk for mental health disorders. A 2010 survey regarding adults with psychosis revealed 5 persons per 1000 in the population seeks professional mental health services for psychotic disorders and the most common psychotic disorder was schizophrenia. =Canada= According to statistics released by the Centre of Addiction and Mental Health one in five people in Canada experience a mental health or addiction problem. Young people of ages 15 to 25 are particularly found to be vulnerable. Major depression is found to affect 8% and anxiety disorder 12% of the population. Women are 1.5 times more likely to suffer from mood and anxiety disorders. WHO points out that there are distinct gender differences in patterns of mental health and illness. The lack of power and control over their socioeconomic status, gender based violence; low social position and responsibility for the care of others render women vulnerable to mental health risks. Since more women than men seek help regarding a mental health problem, this has led to not only gender stereotyping but also reinforcing social stigma. WHO has found that this stereotyping has led doctors to diagnose depression more often in women than in men even when they display identical symptoms. Often communication between health care providers and women is authoritarian leading to either the under-treatment or over-treatment of these women. Organizations Women's College Hospital has a program called the \\"Women's Mental Health Program\\" where doctors and nurses help treat and educate women regarding mental health collaboratively, individually, and online by answering questions from the public. Another Canadian organization serving mental health needs is the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH). CAMH is one of Canada's largest and most well-known health and addiction facilities, and it has received international recognitions from the Pan American Health Organization and World Health Organization Collaborating Centre. They do research in areas of addiction and mental health in both men and women. In order to help both men and women, CAMH provides \\"clinical care, research, education, policy development and health promotion to help transform the lives of people affected by mental health and addiction issues.\\" CAMH is different from Women's College Hospital due to its widely known rehab centre for women who have minor addiction issues, to severe ones. This organization provides care for mental health issues by assessments, interventions, residential programs, treatments, and doctor and family support. = Israel = In Israel, a Mental Health Insurance Reform took effect in July 2015, transferring responsibility for the provision of mental health services from the Ministry of Health to the four national health plans. Physical and mental health care were united under one roof; previously they had functioned separately in terms of finance, location, and provider. Under the reform, the health plans developed new services or expanded existing ones to address mental health problems.Yael Ashkenazi, Yoav Loeff, Rina Maoz Breuer,and Hava Tabenkin. The Involvement of Primary Care Physicians in Mental Health Care Following the Implementation of the Mental Health Reform. Jerusalem: Myers- JDC-Brookdale Institute (2018). =United States= According to the World Health Organization in 2004, depression is the leading cause of disability in the United States for individuals ages 15 to 44. Absence from work in the U.S. due to depression is estimated to be in excess of $31 billion per year. Depression frequently co-occurs with a variety of medical illnesses such as heart disease, cancer, and chronic pain and is associated with poorer health status and prognosis. Each year, roughly 30,000 Americans take their lives, while hundreds of thousands make suicide attempts (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). In 2004, suicide was the 11th leading cause of death in the United States (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), third among individuals ages 15‚Äì24. Despite the increasingly availability of effectual depression treatment, the level of unmet need for treatment remains high. By way of comparison, a study conducted in Australia during 2006 to 2007 reported that one-third (34.9%) of patients diagnosed with a mental health disorder had presented to medical health services for treatment. The US has a shortage of mental healthcare workers, contributing to the unmet need for treatment. By 2025, the US will need an additional 15,400 psychiatrists and 57,490 psychologists to meet the demand for treatment. There are many factors that influence mental health including: *Mental illness, disability, and suicide are ultimately the result of a combination of biology, environment, and access to and utilization of mental health treatment. *Public health policies can influence access and utilization, which subsequently may improve mental health and help to progress the negative consequences of depression and its associated disability. Emotional mental illnesses should be a particular concern in the United States since the U.S. has the highest annual prevalence rates (26 percent) for mental illnesses among a comparison of 14 developing and developed countries. While approximately 80 percent of all people in the United States with a mental disorder eventually receive some form of treatment, on the average persons do not access care until nearly a decade following the development of their illness, and less than one-third of people who seek help receive minimally adequate care. The government offers everyone programs and services, but veterans receive the most help, there is certain eligibility criteria that has to be met. Policies The mental health policies in the United States have experienced four major reforms: the American asylum movement led by Dorothea Dix in 1843; the \\"mental hygiene\\" movement inspired by Clifford Beers in 1908; the deinstitutionalization started by Action for Mental Health in 1961; and the community support movement called for by The CMCH Act Amendments of 1975. In 1843, Dorothea Dix submitted a Memorial to the Legislature of Massachusetts, describing the abusive treatment and horrible conditions received by the mentally ill patients in jails, cages, and almshouses. She revealed in her Memorial: \\"I proceed, gentlemen, briefly to call your attention to the present state of insane persons confined within this Commonwealth, in cages, closets, cellars, stalls, pens! Chained, naked, beaten with rods, and lashed into obedience....\\" Many asylums were built in that period, with high fences or walls separating the patients from other community members and strict rules regarding the entrance and exit. In those asylums, traditional treatments were well implemented: drugs were not used as a cure for a disease, but a way to reset equilibrium in a person's body, along with other essential elements such as healthy diets, fresh air, middle class culture, and the visits by their neighboring residents. In 1866, a recommendation came to the New York State Legislature to establish a separate asylum for chronic mentally ill patients. Some hospitals placed the chronic patients into separate wings or wards, or different buildings. In A Mind That Found Itself (1908) Clifford Whittingham Beers described the humiliating treatment he received and the deplorable conditions in the mental hospital. One year later, the National Committee for Mental Hygiene (NCMH) was founded by a small group of reform-minded scholars and scientists ‚Äì including Beers himself ‚Äì which marked the beginning of the \\"mental hygiene\\" movement. The movement emphasized the importance of childhood prevention. World War I catalyzed this idea with an additional emphasis on the impact of maladjustment, which convinced the hygienists that prevention was the only practical approach to handle mental health issues. However, prevention was not successful, especially for chronic illness; the condemnable conditions in the hospitals were even more prevalent, especially under the pressure of the increasing number of chronically ill and the influence of the depression. In 1961, the Joint Commission on Mental Health published a report called Action for Mental Health, whose goal was for community clinic care to take on the burden of prevention and early intervention of the mental illness, therefore to leave space in the hospitals for severe and chronic patients. The court started to rule in favor of the patients' will on whether they should be forced to treatment. By 1977, 650 community mental health centers were built to cover 43 percent of the population and serve 1.9 million individuals a year, and the lengths of treatment decreased from 6 months to only 23 days. However, issues still existed. Due to inflation, especially in the 1970s, the community nursing homes received less money to support the care and treatment provided. Fewer than half of the planned centers were created, and new methods did not fully replace the old approaches to carry out its full capacity of treating power. Besides, the community helping system was not fully established to support the patients' housing, vocational opportunities, income supports, and other benefits. Many patients returned to welfare and criminal justice institutions, and more became homeless. The movement of deinstitutionalization was facing great challenges. Excerpts from After realizing that simply changing the location of mental health care from the state hospitals to nursing houses was insufficient to implement the idea of deinstitutionalization, the National Institute of Mental Health in 1975 created the Community Support Program (CSP) to provide funds for communities to set up a comprehensive mental health service and supports to help the mentally ill patients integrate successfully in the society. The program stressed the importance of other supports in addition to medical care, including housing, living expenses, employment, transportation, and education; and set up new national priority for people with serious mental disorders. In addition, the Congress enacted the Mental Health Systems Act of 1980 to prioritize the service to the mentally ill and emphasize the expansion of services beyond just clinical care alone. Later in the 1980s, under the influence from the Congress and the Supreme Court, many programs started to help the patients regain their benefits. A new Medicaid service was also established to serve people who were diagnosed with a \\"chronic mental illness.\\" People who were temporally hospitalized were also provided aid and care and a pre-release program was created to enable people to apply for reinstatement prior to discharge. Not until 1990, around 35 years after the start of the deinstitutionalization, did the first state hospital begin to close. The number of hospitals dropped from around 300 by over 40 in the 1990s, and finally a Report on Mental Health showed the efficacy of mental health treatment, giving a range of treatments available for patients to choose. However, several critics maintain that deinstitutionalization has, from a mental health point of view, been a thoroughgoing failure. The seriously mentally ill are either homeless, or in prison; in either case (especially the latter), they are getting little or no mental health care. This failure is attributed to a number of reasons over which there is some degree of contention, although there is general agreement that community support programs have been ineffective at best, due to a lack of funding. The 2011 National Prevention Strategy included mental and emotional well-being, with recommendations including better parenting and early intervention programs, which increase the likelihood of prevention programs being included in future US mental health policies. The NIMH is researching only suicide and HIV/AIDS prevention, but the National Prevention Strategy could lead to it focusing more broadly on longitudinal prevention studies. In 2013, United States Representative Tim Murphy introduced the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act, HR2646. The bipartisan bill went through substantial revision and was reintroduced in 2015 by Murphy and Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson. In November 2015, it passed the Health Subcommittee by an 18‚Äì12 vote.

A pseudonorm or seminorm satisfies the same properties, except that it may have a zero value for some nonzero vectors. The Euclidean norm, or 2-norm, is a specific norm on a Euclidean vector space that is strongly related to the Euclidean distance. It is also equal to the square root of the inner product of a vector with itself. A vector space on which a norm is defined is called a normed vector space. In a similar manner, a vector space with a seminorm is called a seminormed vector space.  Definition  Given a vector space over a field of the real numbers or complex numbers , a norm on V is a nonnegative-valued function with the following properties: For all and all , # (being subadditive or satisfying the triangle inequality). # (being absolutely homogeneous or absolutely scalable). # If then is the zero vector (being positive definite or being point-separating). A seminorm on V is a function with the properties 1 and 2 above. = Equivalent norms = Suppose that and are two norms (or seminorms) on a vector space . Then and are called equivalent, if there exist two real constants and with such that for every vector , :. The norms and are equivalent if and only if they induce the same topology on . Any two norms on a finite-dimensional space are equivalent but this does not extend to infinite-dimensional spaces.  Notation  If a norm is given on a vector space , then the norm of a vector is usually denoted by enclosing it within double vertical lines: . Such notation is also sometimes used if is only a seminorm. For the length of a vector in Euclidean space (which is an example of a norm, as explained below), the notation with single vertical lines is also widespread. In Unicode, the code point of the \\"double vertical line\\" character ‚Äñ is U+2016. The double vertical line should not be confused with the \\"parallel to\\" symbol, Unicode U+2225 ( ‚à• ), which is used to signify parallel lines in geometry and the parallel addition operator in network theory, various fields of engineering, and applied electronics. The double vertical line should also not be confused with Unicode U+01C1 ( «Å ), the symbol used to denote lateral clicks in linguistics. The single vertical line is called \\"vertical line\\" in Unicode and its code point is U+007C. In LaTeX and related markup languages, the macro \`\\\\|\` is often used to denote a norm.  Examples  Every (real or complex) vector space admits a norm: If is a Hamel basis for a vector space then the real-valued map that sends (where all but finitely many of the scalars are 0) to is a norm on . There are also a large number of norms that exhibit additional properties that make them useful for specific problems. = Absolute-value norm = The absolute value :\\\\left\\\\x \\\\right\\\\= \\\\leftx \\\\rightis a norm on the one-dimensional vector spaces formed by the real or complex numbers. Any norm on a one-dimensional vector space is equivalent (up to scaling) to the absolute value norm, meaning that there is a norm-preserving isomorphism of vector spaces , where is either or , and norm-preserving means that \\\\left|x\\\\right= p(f(x)). This isomorphism is given by sending to a vector of norm , which exists since such a vector is obtained by multiplying any nonzero vector by the inverse of its norm. = Euclidean norm = On the -dimensional Euclidean space , the intuitive notion of length of the vector is captured by the formula : \\\\left\\\\\\\\boldsymbol{x} \\\\right\\\\|_2 := \\\\sqrt{x_1^2 + \\\\cdots + x_n^2}. This is the Euclidean norm, which gives the ordinary distance from the origin to the point X‚Äîa consequence of the Pythagorean theorem. This operation may also be referred to as \\"SRSS\\", which is an acronym for the square root of the sum of squares. The Euclidean norm is by far the most commonly used norm on , but there are other norms on this vector space as will be shown below. However, all these norms are equivalent in the sense that they all define the same topology. The inner product of two vectors of a Euclidean vector space is the dot product of their coordinate vectors over an orthonormal basis. Hence, the Euclidean norm can be written in a coordinate-free way as : \\\\left\\\\\\\\boldsymbol{x} \\\\right\\\\:= \\\\sqrt{\\\\boldsymbol{x} \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol{x}}. The Euclidean norm is also called the L2 norm, ‚Ñì2 norm, 2-norm, or square norm; see Lp space. It defines a distance function called the Euclidean length, L2 distance, or ‚Ñì2 distance. The set of vectors in whose Euclidean norm is a given positive constant forms an -sphere.  Euclidean norm of complex numbers  The Euclidean norm of a complex number is the absolute value (also called the modulus) of it, if the complex plane is identified with the Euclidean plane . This identification of the complex number as a vector in the Euclidean plane, makes the quantity \\\\sqrt{x^2 +y^2} (as first suggested by Euler) the Euclidean norm associated with the complex number.  Quaternions and octonions  There are exactly four Euclidean Hurwitz algebras over the real numbers. These are the real numbers , the complex numbers , the quaternions , and lastly the octonions , where the dimensions of these spaces over the real numbers are , , , and , respectively. The canonical norms on and are their absolute value functions, as discussed previously. The canonical norm on of quaternions is defined by :\\\\lVert q \\\\rVert = \\\\sqrt{\\\\,qq^*~} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\,q^*q~} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\,a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2~} for every quaternion q = a + b\\\\,\\\\mathbf i + c\\\\,\\\\mathbf j + d\\\\,\\\\mathbf k in . This is the same as the Euclidean norm on considered as the vector space . Similarly, the canonical norm on the octonions is the just Euclidean norm on . ;Finite-dimensional complex normed spaces On an -dimensional complex space , the most common norm is :\\\\left\\\\\\\\boldsymbol{z} \\\\right\\\\:= \\\\sqrt{ \\\\leftz_1 \\\\right^2 + \\\\cdots + \\\\leftz_n \\\\right^2}= \\\\sqrt{z_1 \\\\bar z_1 + \\\\cdots + z_n \\\\bar z_n}. In this case, the norm can be expressed as the square root of the inner product of the vector and itself: :\\\\left\\\\\\\\boldsymbol{x} \\\\right\\\\:= \\\\sqrt{\\\\boldsymbol{x}^H ~ \\\\boldsymbol{x}}, where \\\\boldsymbol{x} is represented as a column vector ([x1; x2; ...; xn]), and \\\\boldsymbol{x}^H denotes its conjugate transpose. This formula is valid for any inner product space, including Euclidean and complex spaces. For complex spaces, the inner product is equivalent to the complex dot product. Hence the formula in this case can also be written using the following notation: : \\\\left\\\\\\\\boldsymbol{x} \\\\right\\\\:= \\\\sqrt{\\\\boldsymbol{x} \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol{x}}. = Taxicab norm or Manhattan norm = :\\\\left\\\\\\\\boldsymbol{x} \\\\right\\\\_1 := \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\leftx_i \\\\right. The name relates to the distance a taxi has to drive in a rectangular street grid to get from the origin to the point . The set of vectors whose 1-norm is a given constant forms the surface of a cross polytope of dimension equivalent to that of the norm minus 1. The Taxicab norm is also called the \\\\ell1 norm. The distance derived from this norm is called the Manhattan distance or \\\\ell1 distance. The 1-norm is simply the sum of the absolute values of the columns. In contrast, :\\\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i is not a norm because it may yield negative results. = p-norm = Let be a real number. The -norm (also called \\\\ell_p-norm) of vector \\\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n) is : \\\\left\\\\\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\right\\\\_p := \\\\bigg( \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\leftx_i \\\\right^p \\\\bigg) ^{1/p}. For , we get the taxicab norm, for , we get the Euclidean norm, and as approaches the -norm approaches the infinity norm or maximum norm: : \\\\left\\\\\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\right\\\\_\\\\infty := \\\\max_i \\\\leftx_i \\\\right|. The -norm is related to the generalized mean or power mean. This definition is still of some interest for , but the resulting function does not define a norm,Except in , where it coincides with the Euclidean norm, and , where it is trivial. because it violates the triangle inequality. What is true for this case of , even in the measurable analog, is that the corresponding class is a vector space, and it is also true that the function : \\\\int_X \\\\leftf ( x ) - g ( x ) \\\\right^p ~ \\\\mathrm d \\\\mu (without th root) defines a distance that makes into a complete metric topological vector space. These spaces are of great interest in functional analysis, probability theory and harmonic analysis. However, aside from trivial cases, this topological vector space is not locally convex, and has no continuous non-zero linear forms. Thus the topological dual space contains only the zero functional. The partial derivative of the -norm is given by :\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x_k} \\\\left\\\\\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\right\\\\|_p = \\\\frac{x_k \\\\leftx_k \\\\right|^{p-2}} { \\\\left\\\\\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\right\\\\|_p^{p-1}}. The derivative with respect to , therefore, is : \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\|\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\|_p}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{x}} =\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\circ |\\\\mathbf{x}|^{p-2}} {\\\\|\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\|^{p-1}_p}. where denotes Hadamard product and |\\\\cdotis used for absolute value of each component of the vector. For the special case of , this becomes :\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x_k} \\\\left\\\\\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\right\\\\_2 = \\\\frac{x_k}{ \\\\left\\\\\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\right\\\\_2} , or :\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{x}} \\\\left\\\\\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\right\\\\_2 = \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{x}}{ \\\\left\\\\\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\right\\\\_2} . = Maximum norm (special case of: infinity norm, uniform norm, or supremum norm) = _\\\\infty = 1 If \\\\mathbf{x} is some vector such that \\\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots ,x_n), then: : \\\\left\\\\\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\right\\\\_\\\\infty := \\\\max \\\\left( \\\\leftx_1 \\\\right, \\\\ldots , \\\\leftx_n \\\\right\\\\right) . The set of vectors whose infinity norm is a given constant, , forms the surface of a hypercube with edge length 2c. = Zero norm = In probability and functional analysis, the zero norm induces a complete metric topology for the space of measurable functions and for the F-space of sequences with F‚Äìnorm (x_n) \\\\mapsto \\\\sum_n{2^{-n} x_n/(1+x_n)}. Here we mean by F-norm some real-valued function \\\\lVert \\\\ \\\\cdot\\\\ \\\\rVert on an F-space with distance , such that \\\\lVert x \\\\rVert = d(x,0). The F-norm described above is not a norm in the usual sense because it lacks the required homogeneity property.  Hamming distance of a vector from zero  In metric geometry, the discrete metric takes the value one for distinct points and zero otherwise. When applied coordinate-wise to the elements of a vector space, the discrete distance defines the Hamming distance, which is important in coding and information theory. In the field of real or complex numbers, the distance of the discrete metric from zero is not homogeneous in the non-zero point; indeed, the distance from zero remains one as its non-zero argument approaches zero. However, the discrete distance of a number from zero does satisfy the other properties of a norm, namely the triangle inequality and positive definiteness. When applied component-wise to vectors, the discrete distance from zero behaves like a non-homogeneous \\"norm\\", which counts the number of non-zero components in its vector argument; again, this non-homogeneous \\"norm\\" is discontinuous. In signal processing and statistics, David Donoho referred to the zero \\"norm\\" with quotation marks. Following Donoho's notation, the zero \\"norm\\" of is simply the number of non-zero coordinates of , or the Hamming distance of the vector from zero. When this \\"norm\\" is localized to a bounded set, it is the limit of -norms as approaches 0. Of course, the zero \\"norm\\" is not truly a norm, because it is not positive homogeneous. Indeed, it is not even an F-norm in the sense described above, since it is discontinuous, jointly and severally, with respect to the scalar argument in scalar‚Äìvector multiplication and with respect to its vector argument. Abusing terminology, some engineers omit Donoho's quotation marks and inappropriately call the number-of-nonzeros function the L0 norm, echoing the notation for the Lebesgue space of measurable functions. = Infinite dimensions = The generalization of the above norms to an infinite number of components leads to and spaces, with norms : \\\\left\\\\x \\\\right\\\\_p = \\\\bigg( \\\\sum_{ i \\\\in \\\\mathbb N} \\\\leftx_i \\\\right^p \\\\bigg)^{1/p} \\\\text{ and }\\\\ \\\\left\\\\f \\\\right\\\\_{p,X} = \\\\bigg( \\\\int_X \\\\leftf(x) \\\\right^p ~ \\\\mathrm d x \\\\bigg)^{1/p} for complex-valued sequences and functions on respectively, which can be further generalized (see Haar measure). Any inner product induces in a natural way the norm \\\\left\\\\x \\\\right\\\\:= \\\\sqrt{\\\\langle x , x\\\\rangle} . Other examples of infinite-dimensional normed vector spaces can be found in the Banach space article. = Composite norms = Other norms on can be constructed by combining the above; for example : \\\\left\\\\x \\\\right\\\\:= 2 \\\\leftx_1 \\\\right+ \\\\sqrt{ 3 \\\\leftx_2 \\\\right|^2 + \\\\max ( \\\\leftx_3 \\\\right, 2 \\\\leftx_4 \\\\right)^2 } is a norm on . For any norm and any injective linear transformation we can define a new norm of , equal to : \\\\left\\\\Ax \\\\right\\\\. In 2D, with a rotation by 45¬∞ and a suitable scaling, this changes the taxicab norm into the maximum norm. Each applied to the taxicab norm, up to inversion and interchanging of axes, gives a different unit ball: a parallelogram of a particular shape, size, and orientation. In 3D, this is similar but different for the 1-norm (octahedrons) and the maximum norm (prisms with parallelogram base). There are examples of norms that are not defined by \\"entrywise\\" formulas. For instance, the Minkowski functional of a centrally-symmetric convex body in (centered at zero) defines a norm on (see below). All the above formulas also yield norms on without modification. There are also norms on spaces of matrices (with real or complex entries), the so- called matrix norms. = In abstract algebra = Let be a finite extension of a field of inseparable degree , and let have algebraic closure . If the distinct embeddings of are , then the Galois-theoretic norm of an element is the value \\\\left(\\\\prod_j{\\\\sigma_k(\\\\alpha)}\\\\right)^{p^{\\\\mu}}. As that function is homogenous of degree , the Galois-theoretic norm is not a norm in the sense of this article. However, the th root of the norm (assuming that concept makes sense), is a norm.  Composition algebras  The concept of norm N(z) in composition algebras does not share the usual properties of a norm as it may be negative or zero for z ‚â† 0. A composition algebra (A, *, N) consists of an algebra over a field A, an involution *, and a quadratic form N(z) = zz^* , which is called the \\"norm\\". The characteristic feature of composition algebras is the homomorphism property of N: for the product wz of two elements w and z of the composition algebra, its norm satisfies N(wz) = N(w)N(z). For ‚Ñù, ‚ÑÇ, ‚Ñç, and O the composition algebra norm is the square of the norm discussed above. In those cases the norm is a definite quadratic form. In other composition algebras the norm is an isotropic quadratic form.  Properties  For any norm p on a vector space V, the reverse triangle inequality holds: for all u and , :p(u ¬± v) ‚â• |p(u) ‚àí p(v)If is a continuous linear map between normed space, then the norm of and the norm of the transpose of are equal. For the Lp norms, we have H√∂lder's inequality : \\\\left\\\\langle x, y \\\\rangle \\\\right\\\\le \\\\left\\\\x \\\\right\\\\_p \\\\left\\\\y \\\\right\\\\_q \\\\qquad \\\\frac{1}{p} + \\\\frac{1}{q} = 1 . A special case of this is the Cauchy‚ÄìSchwarz inequality: \\\\left\\\\langle x, y \\\\rangle \\\\right\\\\le \\\\left\\\\x \\\\right\\\\_2 \\\\left\\\\y \\\\right\\\\_2 . Illustrations of unit circles in different norms. = Equivalence = The concept of unit circle (the set of all vectors of norm 1) is different in different norms: for the 1-norm, the unit circle is a square, for the 2-norm (Euclidean norm), it is the well-known unit circle, while for the infinity norm, it is a different square. For any p-norm, it is a superellipse with congruent axes (see the accompanying illustration). Due to the definition of the norm, the unit circle must be convex and centrally symmetric (therefore, for example, the unit ball may be a rectangle but cannot be a triangle, and p\\\\ge 1 for a p-norm). In terms of the vector space, the seminorm defines a topology on the space, and this is a Hausdorff topology precisely when the seminorm can distinguish between distinct vectors, which is again equivalent to the seminorm being a norm. The topology thus defined (by either a norm or a seminorm) can be understood either in terms of sequences or open sets. A sequence of vectors \\\\\\\\{v_n\\\\\\\\} is said to converge in norm to v, if \\\\left\\\\v_n - v \\\\right\\\\\\\\rightarrow 0 as n \\\\to \\\\infty. Equivalently, the topology consists of all sets that can be represented as a union of open balls. If is a normed space then for all . Two norms ‚Äñ‚Ä¢‚ÄñŒ± and ‚Äñ‚Ä¢‚ÄñŒ≤ on a vector space V are called equivalent if they induce the same topology, which happens if and only if there exist positive real numbers C and D such that for all x in V : C \\\\left\\\\x \\\\right\\\\|_\\\\alpha \\\\leq \\\\left\\\\x \\\\right\\\\_\\\\beta \\\\leq D \\\\left\\\\x \\\\right\\\\|_\\\\alpha . For instance, if p > r > 0 on \\\\mathbf{C}^n, then : \\\\left\\\\x \\\\right\\\\|_p \\\\leq \\\\left\\\\x \\\\right\\\\_r \\\\leq n ^{(1/r-1/p)} \\\\left\\\\x \\\\right\\\\|_p . In particular, : \\\\left\\\\x \\\\right\\\\|_2 \\\\le \\\\left\\\\x \\\\right\\\\|_1 \\\\le \\\\sqrt{n} \\\\left\\\\x \\\\right\\\\|_2 : \\\\left\\\\x \\\\right\\\\|_\\\\infty \\\\le \\\\left\\\\x \\\\right\\\\|_2 \\\\le \\\\sqrt{n} \\\\left\\\\x \\\\right\\\\|_\\\\infty : \\\\left\\\\x \\\\right\\\\|_\\\\infty \\\\le \\\\left\\\\x \\\\right\\\\|_1 \\\\le n \\\\left\\\\x \\\\right \\\\|_\\\\infty , That is, : \\\\left\\\\x \\\\right\\\\|_\\\\infty \\\\le \\\\left\\\\x \\\\right\\\\|_2 \\\\le \\\\left\\\\x \\\\right\\\\|_1 \\\\le \\\\sqrt{n} \\\\left\\\\x \\\\right\\\\|_2 \\\\le n \\\\left\\\\x \\\\right \\\\|_\\\\infty. If the vector space is a finite-dimensional real or complex one, all norms are equivalent. On the other hand, in the case of infinite-dimensional vector spaces, not all norms are equivalent. Equivalent norms define the same notions of continuity and convergence and for many purposes do not need to be distinguished. To be more precise the uniform structure defined by equivalent norms on the vector space is uniformly isomorphic. Classification of seminorms: absolutely convex absorbing sets All seminorms on a vector space V can be classified in terms of absolutely convex absorbing subsets A of V. To each such subset corresponds a seminorm pA called the gauge of A, defined as :pA(x) := inf{Œ± : Œ± > 0, x ‚àà Œ±A} with the property that :{x : pA(x) < 1} ‚äÜ A ‚äÜ {x : pA(x) ‚â§ 1}. Conversely: Any locally convex topological vector space has a local basis consisting of absolutely convex sets. A common method to construct such a basis is to use a family (p) of seminorms p that separates points: the collection of all finite intersections of sets {p < 1/n} turns the space into a locally convex topological vector space so that every p is continuous. Such a method is used to design weak and weak* topologies. norm case: :Suppose now that (p) contains a single p: since (p) is separating, p is a norm, and } is its open unit ball. Then A is an absolutely convex bounded neighbourhood of 0, and is continuous. :The converse is due to Andrey Kolmogorov: any locally convex and locally bounded topological vector space is normable. Precisely: :If V is an absolutely convex bounded neighbourhood of 0, the gauge gV (so that }) is a norm.

History The term originated in Australia, at first carrying a similar meaning to \\"lout\\" (an annoying or disruptive person, or even a prostitute). Around 1900 it shifted to its present meaning: one whose sense of morality drives them to deprive others of their sinful pleasures, especially liquor. The term was particularly applied to members of temperance groups such as the antipodean branches of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. John Norton, editor of the Australian scandal newspaper, Truth, claimed he first used the word in 1899, a claim supported by the OED.OED: \\"Wowser\\" However some authorsHowell, Peter. South Australia and Federation (2002) p. 67 claim that the present meaning originated from an Australian temperance slogan, \\"We Only Want Social Evils Remedied.\\" This apparent backronym is considered a \\"less credible provenance\\" by the ANU. The Australian writer C. J. Dennis defined it thus: 'Wowser: an ineffably pious person who mistakes this world for a penitentiary and himself for a warder'. Historian Stuart Macintyre argues: :the achievements of the wowsers were impressive; they passed laws that restricted obscenity and juvenile smoking, raised the age of consent, limited gambling, closed down many pubs, and in 1915‚Äì16 established a 6 pm closing hour for pubs, which lasted for decades.Macintyre, Stuart.

His novels usually concerned Britons' experiences in exotic foreign locations, especially in Asia. Personal life Born into a middle-class family in Hale, near Manchester, he was educated at The Downs Malvern, a private boarding school, from September 1928 through 1933. There he studied under novelist W. H. Auden and at the age of 14 authored a juvenile novel (criticized by Auden as \\"no good\\" and now lost). A passage in his second novel, The Wind Cannot Read (1946), may shed some light on Auden's critique: \\"When I was a boy at school I had written a story about a man and a woman. The English master was a poet with a great understanding of human nature, and in red ink at the end he had written, 'Yes, my dear, but people do not fall in love as quickly as all that, you know.' I think my characters had declared their mutual love at a second meeting.\\" His later novels allude to school hazing, and a fictional character mentions a painful separation from his mother, incidents that may give some flavour of his own experiences at boarding school. (The Downs, in Malvern, which he entered at the age of nine, was situated quite far from Hale.) He received his secondary school education in Dorset, at St Marys School and Bryanston School (1933‚Äì36) and published articles in the local press and a film magazine from 1933 through 1938. After a stint working for the British Council, he entered service in the Royal Air Force and served from 1939 until 1944. Attached to the 14th Army as an intelligence officer, he was taught Japanese in a three-month crash course taken in India so as to be able to serve as an interrogator of prisoners of war in India and Burma. (The course was taken with life-long friend Islay Lyons, a Welsh photographer.) In The Wind Cannot Read, the Michael Quinn character receives this training in flats overlooking the harbour of Mumbai, where, indeed, the 14th Army was present. More RAF-related experiences found fictional expression in his first, pseudonymous novel, The Body Fell on Berlin (1943), written as Richard Lakin (Lakin appears as his middle name in the German edition of The World of Suzie Wong). After the war, in 1948, he eloped with and married writer and PA Felicity Anne Cumming, who had previously been married to Henry Landall Lyon Young.\\"A lecture to the Royston Pike group: Part 2\\", The Elmbridge Hundred. Cumming was notorious as a sexual free spirit, who was best known in avant garde literary circles.Richard Davenport-Hines, \\"Cumming, (Felicity) Anne (1917‚Äì93)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, October 2009, accessed 12 April 2017. The two travelled through most of the countries of Europe, and logged 8,000 miles of travel in Africa in a second-hand car. They separated in 1958 and were later divorced. In the 1960s he restored an apartment in Rome and went on to raise sheep on an estate in Wales with his second wife, Sarett Rudley, a television mystery writer best known for a number of Alfred Hitchcock Presents teleplays. He was to remain close friends with both ex- wives. In the early 1970s, Mason returned to Rome, where he met his third wife Margot (\\"Maggie\\") Wolf in 1972, with whom he had a son, Theo, and a daughter, Jessica. The couple were popular hosts, and Mason worked on his sculpting from a rooftop workshop and garden. \\"After Suzie, the ideas just wouldn‚Äôt come. The book has been good for us, like an inheritance, really. We‚Äôre not rich, but we live comfortably\\", Mason remarked in an extremely rare 1988 interview. Long a cigarette smoker, he died of throat cancer/lung cancer in Rome, Italy. He is interred in the Protestant Cemetery, Rome (near Percy Shelley), where his headstone is inscribed with the words \\"Though on the sign it is written: 'Don't pluck these blossoms'‚Äîit is useless against the wind, which cannot read\\". (This poem, quoted in Basil Chamberlain's A Handbook of Colloquial Japanese, which he probably happened across in his Japanese language class, also prefaces The Wind Cannot Read.)  Career  Mason's ingenious first novel, The Body Fell on Berlin, was a murder mystery set during the war. Jasper Doyle, an intelligence officer formerly of Scotland Yard, is posted to Fenmallham Airdrome, England, from which RAF bombers depart for missions over occupied Europe and Germany. In reviewing some photos taking during a bombing run over Berlin he spots what looks suspiciously like a body - which seems to have been very neatly disposed of indeed . . . . The setting is keenly observed, as are the many convincing characters. His second novel, The Wind Cannot Read, was written in India between February and May 1944, sometimes in temperatures over 100 degrees, after the day's duties. It was based partly on his wartime experiences learning Japanese and won the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize in 1948. (The character \\"Peter\\" featured in it was based on his friend Lyons, while the Michael Quinn character is transparently himself.) Mason also did a surprisingly competent job of writing the screenplay for the 1958 film version, starring Dirk Bogarde. Many of the themes of love transcending cultural boundaries, also developed later in The World of Suzie Wong, make their first appearance here. The movie setting, Red Fort in Delhi, departs from the Mumbai setting of the novel, but provides considerable visual interest, and nicely complements the novel by providing a rich portrait of the city and of Indian life. The novel and film were sufficiently successful that Mason was subsequently able to devote himself entirely to writing and travel, including visits to the Caribbean and Polynesia. The Wind Cannot Read was followed by another mystery novel Angel Take Care (also written as Richard Lakin, 1947). Easily the most charming of Mason's novels, it details the amusing experiences of a newly formed husband and wife detective team as they attempt to determine the fate of a missing person. Mason's next novel The Shadow and the Peak, set in Jamaica, was filmed in 1958 as Passionate Summer (alternately titled \\"Storm over Jamaica\\"). In this time frame Mason also produced films and wrote several scripts. With W. P. Lipscomb, he wrote the screenplay for the 1956 film version of Nevil Shute's novel A Town Like Alice. In search of inspiration for his next book, he suspected that he would find it in Hong Kong. \\"I had felt I needed background for a book and something in me said Hong Kong was a place where I would immediately find material, so I simply bought a ticket,\\" he commented to an interviewer. Mason's delight in his observations there did indeed inspire him to write his best-known book, The World of Suzie Wong (1957), a tale of an artist's surprisingly tender romance with a Hong Kong prostitute. It quickly became a well-reviewed bestseller, The Times Literary Supplement, for example, calling it \\"extremely readable\\" and noting that it was \\"written with uncommon skill and intelligence.\\" It also added a somewhat controversial expression, \\"Suzie Wong\\" (a seductive East Asian woman), to the English language. It was quickly adapted into a 1958 Broadway play, starring William Shatner and France Nuyen, as well as the 1960 film The World of Suzie Wong, starring William Holden and Nancy Kwan. It was Kwan's first film role. Mason wrote the first draft of the novel in Hong Kong in just three months in 1956, but upon returning to England he felt he had been too close to the material to judge it properly and put the manuscript away in a cabinet. Setting this draft behind him, he rewrote the entire novel from scratch over the course of a year. The primary setting is a hotel brothel called Nam Kok, based on the actual Luk Kwok hotel where Mason himself stayed at the suggestion of a friend. (The hotel has since been replaced by an upscale concrete and glass construction that bears no resemblance.) The novel's tremendous success owes much to keen psychological insight, a strength apparent in all of Mason's novels, deft and often touching characterization, and the unfolding of a love story that explores the many difficulties inherent in a relationship between a respectable British artist and a Hong Kong prostitute, forced into the trade from economic necessity. (China had been embroiled in a turbulent civil war compounded by Japanese invasion in the period immediately preceding the events of the novel.) The psychological pressures bearing upon the essentially conservative Suzie, and the social consequences for her lover Robert Lomax are particularly well developed. Mason, however, felt that the novel fell short of its full potential and would have been stronger had he explored more fully life as it was then being lived in Hong Kong. The film differs significantly from the novel in a number of ways (Lomax, for example, is transformed into an American, a major character is omitted altogether, and Suzie's travails with the legal system and health make no appearance). However, filmed on location, it is full of visual interest and stands on its own dramatically. Mason himself thought well of the film except for the performance of Holden, whom he felt was nothing like Lomax, and \\"more like an American banker\\". Mason's 1962 espionage novel The Fever Tree was set in India and Nepal. Written in 1961 with the help of Sarett, while working in creative isolation on Elba, it was to be his last. From this point forward he lived entirely on royalties earned from his publications and films and spent time learning sculpting from the Rome-based artist Robert Cook.

Serian is a town, and the capital of the Serian (2,039.9 square kilometres) separated on 11 April 2015 from Samarahan Division, Sarawak, Malaysia. It is located about from Kuching. Sub-district headquarters towns are Siburan and Tebedu. The town is known for its durians, which are popularly believed to be the best in Sarawak. This has prompted the Serian District Council to erect a giant monument to this \\"king of fruits\\" right in the middle of the market square. However, other monuments such as the tiger and the buffalo statues seem out of place as there are no tigers or buffalos in this district. The town is well connected to its rich hinterland both by road and by water and thus one can find all sorts of jungle produce available in the jungle produce market but lately, most of these produce were brought in from Kalimantan, Indonesia as the price are cheaper. The district population (year 2010 census) was 90,763. About 65% of the population are Bidayuh. The other main ethnic groups are Iban, Chinese, and Malay. Geography Limestone formations and paddy fields can be seen along the way to Tebedu. Other attraction points of Serian are Gua Tiab Bilanting which is situated at Kampung Pichin and also Bukit Parang which is located at the Sarawak-Kalimantan border. There are many waterfalls found in Serian District Sarawak. Ranchan Waterfall is the most famous one, located at about from Serian town and is accessible easily by road. Simuja Waterfall is another waterfall can be found in Serian but it was damaged badly by logging activities. It is located about away from town. There is no proper road to the waterfall and visitors have to hike from Serian-Sri Aman trunk road to get there. Tebedu (which renamed Bandar Mutiara recently), located about away from Serian town on the Indonesia-Malaysia border, is one of only three official land border crossings between Indonesia and Malaysia. Tebakang a small town in located approximately 12km away from Serian, is a home to Mayang Tea plantation, Sarawak sole tea producer.

It is close to Suva, Fiji's capital, which lies about ten kilometers to the west. It is an island rich in history, which has played a pivotal role in Fiji's demographic and political development over the past 160 years.  History  Nukulau played a role in the ceding of Fiji to the British Crown in 1874. In 1846, John Brown Williams, the American consul, had purchased the island for a mere thirty dollars. He subsequently lived there, in the wooden two-story house he built, until 1849. On 4 July of that year, during American Independence Day celebrations, a store belonging to Williams was destroyed in a fire which started from a cannon burst, and his belongings that he had salvaged from the fire were subsequently looted by Fiji natives. A second fire in 1855 destroyed Williams' house. Williams held Cakobau, the Vunivalu (Paramount Chief) of Bau and self- proclaimed Tui Viti (King of Fiji) responsible for the looting, and, supported by the United States Navy in the First Fiji Expedition, demanded US$43,531 in compensation, to cover Williams' losses, valued at US$5000, and claims by other settlers. This was followed up by a second American expedition in 1858, in which hostages were seized. Cakobau's inability to pay the debt, coupled with fear of a U.S. invasion and annexation, led to a series of negotiations with the United Kingdom. After a failed attempt to establish a stable constitutional monarchy under the effective tutelage of the Australian Polynesia Company, the negotiations culminated in a decision to cede the islands to the United Kingdom in 1874, ushering in almost a century of British rule. Historians now believe that the U.S. compensation claim was greatly exaggerated and largely fabricated (see Robson, A.E, Prelude to Empire, 2004, p. 84 (citing Calvert 1856 and Freemantle 1856)). The colourful history of Nukulau Island did not end with the advent of British rule. From 1879 to 1916, the island served as a quarantine centre for thousands of Indian indentured labourers brought in by the British colonial rulers. After health checks, they were subsequently employed on Fiji's sugar plantations, or else repatriated to the Indian subcontinent.  Nukulau prison  In 2000, a prison was opened on Nukulau, to house George Speight and other perpetrators of the 2000 coup that deposed Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry's government. On 18 December 2006, Fiji's military ruler, Commodore Frank Bainimarama, announced his decision to close the prison and convert the island into a public park, as it was before 2000. The prison was costing too much money, Bainimarama claimed. Prisoners, including Speight - who is now serving a life-sentence for treason - would be transferred to other prisons, Bainimarama said. The prison was closed on 20 December and its occupants moved to jails on the Viti Levu mainland. On December 26, the first people were able to visit the island. Visitors are charged a fee of $2 per person to help with the upkeep of the island. Barbecues are available and camping is possible - a permit must first be obtained.Permit, Ministry of Lands & Mineral Resources  Transport to Nukulau Island  Boat fares are usually $15/return for adults and half price for children but this is something you will discuss with the boat owners. Departure times to and from Nukulau is to be done with the respective boat owner. Otherwise, contact the Royal Suva Yacht Club on boat arrangements and speak to Sabrina (costing for passengers may differ from above, take bigger numbers and pick up is from the Yacht Club).  Facilities on the Island  There is a shed on the island but visitors can also bring their tents to camp out. For the shed, you will need to take your own sleeping items. Bathroom and toilet facilities are available on the island but it would be best to take your own drinking water be it for a day trip or going overnight. There are about nine BBQ stands and the hotplate is always with the island caretaker. Lovo facilities are also available but you will need to provide the hands and some firewood.

He was also active as a film director, playwright and screenwriter.  Early years  He was born on June 26, 1891 in H√°j near Opava in Austrian Silesia (today the Czech Republic), of an old non-Catholic nobility family; his parents were V√°clav Vojtƒõch Vanƒçura, born 1856 in ƒå√°slav, Evangelical, Director of sugar refinery in H√°j and Marie Svobodov√°, Catholic, born 1863 in Kluky near ƒå√°slav. In 1896, the family moved to Davle, a beautiful place on the riverside of Vltava, about 12 miles south of Prague, where they lived in a large country-house. Their broadminded father became the director of a complex of nearby stone pits and brickworks. In Davle, young Vladislav was educated by a home teacher (tutor) between 1898-1904. In 1905, he and his older sisters moved to Prague to study there; Vladislav entered the fifth class of Elementary School in Josefsk√° Street.  First prose-works and teenage years  In 1907 Vladislav entered the Royal Gymnasium in Prague Lesser Town, but problems with school routine and pedantry of professors made him leave the next year. Between 1909 and 1910, he attended Royal Gymnasium in a small town of Bene≈°ov, about 30 miles south-east of Prague. It was an old school founded in 1704 and formerly led by the Piarist Order, with severe discipline and rigid professors. Vanƒçura hated this school immensely; on May 14, 1909, he published his first short story V aleji (In Alley) in the literary supplement of Hork√©ho t√Ωden√≠k (Hork√Ω's weekly magazine). The studies in Bene≈°ov ended in 1910 by a consilium abeundi because of his membership in a secret student club. His parents sent him to Vysok√© M√Ωto to be an apprentice to a bookseller ƒåerm√°k. He felt depressed and dreamed of becoming a painter. In 1911, he studied the technology of photography in Prague and also began courses at Arts and Crafts School;he was unsuccessful in his attempt to enter the Royal Academy of Arts and start a career as a painter. He considered suicide because his parents wanted him to be a marine officer or soldier. Due to the illness of his mother, Vladislav returned to Davle. In 1912 he studied privately at home and completed the exams of 4th and 5th class of the gymnasium. The next year he entered Royal Gymnasium on K≈ôemencov√° Street in Prague and finished the 6th class. Between 1914 and 1915 he was again a student at Prague Lesser Town Royal Gymnasium where he took the final exam on June 6, 1915.  University studies, journalism  In October 1915, Vladislav entered the Faculty of Law of Charles University in Prague, but this bored him. In the winter of 1916 he studied medicine at the same university; his family moved from Davle to a country manor Humburky, not far from Prague and Vladislav met 19-year-old Ludmila 'L√≠da' Tuh√°, a student of medicine. In 1917, the painter group Tvrdo≈°√≠jn√≠ (Stubborns) was founded by Josef ƒåapek, Jan Zrzav√Ω, V√°clav ≈†p√°la, Vlastimil Hofman, Bed≈ôich Feuerstein, Zdenƒõk Rykr and other close friends of Vladislav. He wrote about them and Josef ƒåapek became the congenial illustrator of his later book Rozmarn√© leto in 1926. Between October 1 and December 31, 1918, Vladislav practiced medicine at a hospital in Nƒõmeck√Ω Brod. A few days later, on October 3, he published his small prose R√°j (Paradise) in S. K. Neumann's magazine ƒåerven (June) and worked on a fairy- tale book Kol√©bka (Cradle) and on a play Iason. In 1919 Vladislav returned to Prague to continue his university studies; from 1919-1920 he published many art reviews in daily newspaper ƒåesk√© slovo (The Czech Word).  1920s and great novels  On June 2, 1921, Vladislav and L√≠da graduated as doctors of medicine and married on August 16, of the same year. In autumn, they moved to Zbraslav, where they opened a surgical practice. In 1923, Vladislav published a book of short stories Amazonsk√Ω proud (Amazon Stream). More important was his second short stories book, published in 1924, Dlouh√Ω, ≈†irok√Ω a Bystrozrak√Ω (Long, Thick and Sharpsighted), containing excellent texts like Cesta do svƒõta (Journey to the World) or F. C. Ball. The third book, Peka≈ô Jan Marhoul (Baker Jan Marhoul), published in 1924, introduced him as a great author to the public. It is Vanƒçura's first novel and maybe also his best - story of tragical life of a wealthy baker who is continuously declining into destitution and death despite his gentleness and goodness. The story is written with extraordinary language and a brilliant style. In 1925, Vanƒçura published the novel Pole orn√° a v√°leƒçn√° (Fields of Plough, Fields of War) and the following year the novel Rozmarn√© l√©to (Summer of Caprice), became a bestseller. It is a humorous story of three men - a colonel, a priest and a bath-keeper - during rainy summer holidays. In 1967, the book was successfully filmed as Capricious Summer by the Czech director Ji≈ô√≠ Menzel who also played the role of Arno≈°tek in this movie. In 1928 Vanƒçura wrote his fourth novel, Posledn√≠ soud (Last Judgement), published in 1929 and built his new white functionalistic villa in Zbraslav designed by architect Jarom√≠r Krejcar, the husband of Franz Kafka's friend, journalist and translator Milena Jesensk√°.  1930s and great novels  Vanƒçura's fifth novel Hrdeln√≠ p≈ôe aneb P≈ô√≠slov√≠ (Criminal Dispute or The Proverbs) published in 1930 in Aventinum Publishing House, Prague, was not very popular in its time; it is the most complicated of Vanƒçura's novels, the genre of which lies between a detective novel and a tract on noetics. From the language point of view this book is a serious problem for translators because of hundreds of old proverbs used in text; there is only one translation today - Polish. In 1931, the novel Mark√©ta Lazarov√° (Marketa Lazarova) was published and became a bestseller. The novel was inspired by a true Middle Ages story of the knights of the Vanƒçura family who were in a private war with other noblemen and with the King's town Mlad√° Boleslav. Vanƒçura dedicated this book to his cousin and friend Ji≈ô√≠ Mahen. In 1967, the book was successfully filmed by director Franti≈°ek Vl√°ƒçil. In the same year (1931) Vanƒçura also published a fairy-tale book Kubula a Kuba Kubikula (Kubula and Kuba Kubikula) that remained popular for decades. Vanƒçura's activity continued through the next year as he published the novel √ötƒõk do Bud√≠na (Escape to Budapest), a contemporary story of love, marriage and life of a Prague middle-class woman and a Slovak nobleman. In 1934, two other books were published: Luk kr√°lovny Dorotky (Bow of Little Queen Dorothy), a collection of short stories and Konec star√Ωch ƒças≈Ø (End of the Old Times) a bestseller, satirical and humorous novel about the life at a Bohemian country-chateau in the first years of the republic (this book was also successfully filmed by Ji≈ô√≠ Menzel in 1989). In 1934 also, Vancura directed the film Marika Nevƒõrnice, from a story by Ivan Olbracht. With the 'End of the Old Times', the time of Vanƒçura's best books ended too. His next two books, a play Jezero Ukerewe (Ukerewe Lake) from 1935 and a socialism-influenced book T≈ôi ≈ôeky (Three Rivers), 1936 were not successful.  1940s, political crisis and war  In March 1938, Adolf Hitler annexed Austria. Vanƒçura's friend, playwright Otokar Fischer died of a heart-attack when he learned about it; Vanƒçura wrote an obituary about him to Liter√°rn√≠ listy magazine. In 1938, Rodina Horv√°tova (Horv√°t Family), a novel about life of three generations of a gentry family was published which did not attract any reader interest, due to the political crisis. In December 1938, Vanƒçura took part in the burial of his friend Karel ƒåapek, the famous writer. Vanƒçura entered the strong anti-Hitler cultural movement and started to write the book Obrazy z dƒõjin n√°roda ƒçesk√©ho (Pictures of the History of the Bohemian Nation); its first parts were published and then became a bestseller and symbol of resistance. On March 15, 1939, the rest of Czechoslovakia was occupied by Hitler and a week later, on May 22, Ji≈ô√≠ Mahen committed suicide in a protest against Nazism. Vanƒçura was a member of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. As a response to the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, Vanƒçura joined a secret communist resistance group in Autumn 1939. On May 12, 1942, at 5:00 a.m., the Gestapo assaulted his house in Zbraslav, arrested him and tortured him in the Prague Gestapo headquarters. On May 27, 1942, a commando of the Czechoslovak Foreign Army from Britain assassinated Reinhard Heydrich, Hitler's governor in Prague. As a result, there was a wave of reprisals: in the following weeks more than 2000 members of the Czech elite were executed. One of them was Vanƒçura, executed by SS members in the military area Prague-Kobylisy on June 1, 1942 at 6:45 p.m. His body together with many others was disposed of secretly at Stra≈°nice Crematorium.Riskoval ≈æivot, tajnƒõ zapisoval jm√©na obƒõt√≠ nacist≈Ø.

As Sandra Miller, British art historian, said, ‚ÄúThe subject matter of his compositions is the result of the violence of the physical act to which Chabrera commits himself; and although watching him paint may shock his observers, the results are compositions of great beauty.‚Äù Action painting was the name originally coined by Harold Rosemberg to describe the work of artist Willhem de Kooning, and it is, perhaps, de Kooning who is referenced when describing the work of Chabrera. But Chabrera remains firmly figurative, albeit at a Gestalt level. Although there is a correspondence between abstract expressionism or action painting and the personal expressionism of Chabrera, there are also important and substantial differences. Instead of prioritising the act of painting over the final result, Chabrera inverts the process, prioritising once again the physical object over the concept or idea. When the European Academy for the Arts, based in Leuze (Belgium), named Manuel Chabrera Adiego as a member, it did so in recognition of the singularity of this architect's work, where in the concept of a space, sculpture and painting are integrated with the playing with lights and volumes. His work has been displayed around the world for more than 30 years, appearing in cities such as: St. Petersburg, Mexico City, Montreal, Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Luxembourg, Helsinki, Stockholm, Oslo, Copenhagen, Munich, D√ºsseldorf, Berlin, Chicago, New York, Indianapolis, Buenos Aires, Geneva, Zurich, Bern, Miami and London. The presence and reach of his work is made evident by the numerous articles that have been written about him, as well as the many recognitions he has received over the years. The books ‚ÄúInside his paintings: Manuel Chabrera‚Äù and ‚ÄúManuel Chabrera‚Äù review the extensive career of this man who not only paints, but also does sculpture and prints. Manuel Chabrera has founded the Chabrera Foundation which is dedicated to promoting art to under privileged children and adolescents through the distribution of recycled computers, as well as promoting young artists through international exhibitions, and finally to foster and promote the work of Chabrera. Currently, the Foundation is experimenting with the distribution of Open Code software with the intention of allowing children and adolescents to express themselves creatively through new technologies as Creative Commons 1.

Organized at a cost of US$410,000 by a multiracial national committee chaired by the Prime Minister, Laisenia Qarase, Fiji Week was intended to foster reconciliation among Fiji's diverse ethnic communities, especially native Fijians and Indo-Fijians, whose mutual rivalry for political power has dominated Fijian politics for the last generation, and whose relationship has been especially strained since the overthrow of the Indo-Fijian-led government of Mahendra Chaudhry by ethnic Fijian nationalists in the Fiji coup of 2000. Organizers of Fiji Week hoped that it would help to bring about a sense of closure to those events, but the controversy that it generated made this appear difficult to achieve. On 15 September 2004, a source close to the government told the Australian Associated Press that George Speight, the chief instigator of the 2000 coup, currently serving life- sentence for treason, had had a change of heart towards the Indo-Fijian community following a religious conversion experience in jail, and that he wished to take part in the Fiji Week activities as a gesture of reconciliation. However, the government refused his request to be allowed to leave his Nukulau Island prison to participate in the observances.  Aftermath and criticisms of the ceremonies = Mahendra Chaudhry = Fiji Week was politically controversial. The Fiji Labour Party of deposed Prime Minister Chaudhry boycotted the observances, claiming that they were a political ploy aimed at defusing the lingering post-coup ethnic tensions without addressing the real problem, that many of those responsible for organizing and funding the coup remain unidentified and at large. There could be no reconciliation without justice being done, various party spokesmen said. At a personal level, however, a spokesman said on 11 October that Chaudhry would consider meeting Speight and forgiving him - provided that he name the persons responsible for instigating and financing the 2000 coup. As of December 2004, Speight has not done so. = Adi Koila Nailatikau = Another critic of the ceremonies was Senator Adi Koila Nailatikau, the daughter of the late President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, who was deposed in the 2000 coup. Explaining her refusal to participate in the Fiji Week reconciliation ceremonies, Adi Koila (who had been held hostage for 56 days by the instigators of the coup) told the Senate on 23 October 2004 that the reconciliation undertaken would be worthless unless investigations into the coup revealed the truth behind its staging. She expressed anger that individuals implicated in the coup now held senior positions in the government and the diplomatic service. Adi Koila also said that the reconciliation ceremony was inappropriate because the person who received the whale's tooth and forgave the people in the ceremony at Albert Park (President Ratu Josefa Iloilo) had not been a victim of the May 2000 coup. Adi Koila wondered aloud why the government had decided to organize the reconciliation ceremonies only after both of her parents had died. \\"Why was the concept of reconciliation never done for the late Turaga Bale the Tui Nayau (Ratu Mara) or for that matter the late Marama Bale the Roko Tui Dreketi (Ro Adi Lala Mara)?\\" she demanded. \\"Was all this conjured overnight immediately after their demise?\\" she questioned. Adi Koila declared that there could be no genuine forgiveness until questions were answered about who was involved in organizing and funding the 2000 coup. \\"An individual will forgive when he or she is ready. There must be truth telling, as to why they participated and who gave the orders,\\" Adi Koila said. \\"Reconciliation cannot eventuate or materialise until the proper legal procedures have been followed, that is without interference from external forces.\\" = Frank Bainimarama = On 25 October 2004, Commodore Frank Bainimarama, the Commander of the Armed Forces, added his voice to the criticism of the Fiji Week ceremonies. He said he found it \\"baffling\\" that individuals implicated in the 2000 coup had taken part in the ceremonies to apologize and ask forgiveness for their actions, only to turn up in court later and plead innocent. He said that according to Fijian culture, an apology was tantamount to a public admission of guilt, and that the \\"not guilty\\" pleas later entered by the same people in court raised justifiable questions about whether their apologies were sincere. Bainimarama strongly criticized Senator Ratu George Cakobau for saying that citizens unhappy with the government- organized apology and reconciliation ceremonies should leave Fiji. Bainimarama declared that Fiji belonged to all of its citizens, and that no one should feel intimidated by politicians who spit out racist remarks, adding that the Senator would be shocked to find that many of those who refused the apology were ethnic Fijians. He said that democracy and the rule of law were the rule of the day in the 21st century, and that the military would uphold it. His comments drew angry criticism from government politicians who accused him of meddling in politics. Refusing to be silenced, Bainimarama issued a further statement from Australia on 8 December 2004, condemning the inclusion in the government of persons implicated in the 2000 coup, saying that their presence justified his earlier criticism of the Fiji Week reconciliation ceremonies. \\"That's why we've always said the reconciliation process was a farce,\\" Bainimarama said. \\"The 2001 Elections brought back all of George Speight's group except him.\\" History of Fiji Politics of Fiji Public holidays in Fiji 2004 in Fiji ","title":"Fiji Week, 2004"},{"id":"990573","text":"Sentries of the Jamaica Regiment outside St James's Palace in July 2007 The Jamaica Regiment is the main formation of land troops in the Jamaican Defence Force. It is a non-mechanised infantry regiment consisting of 3 battalions, two regular and one territorial. The regiment has two main operational missions: *The territorial defence of Jamaica. *Assisting the Jamaica Constabulary Force with local law enforcement. It also has been known to provide public duties in for the government and the capital on behalf of the JDF. The regiment has two main camps, with the 2 regular battalions rotating annually between them. The battalion at Up Park Camp in Kingston has a commitment to assisting the local police in maintaining law and order, while the battalion at Moneague Training Camp in Moneague, St Ann is mainly committed to anti-drug patrols. In addition, the regiment is one of the main units that supplies United Nations peacekeeping troops for situations in the Caribbean region. History The Jamaica Regiment was initially formed in 1954 as a unit on the British Army colonial list. In 1958, the Federation of the West Indies was founded, and the regiment passed from the control of the War Office to the new Federation government, where it, and the other infantry regiments of the various Caribbean islands, were disbanded and reorganised into the West India Regiment. This lasted only two years, before this was disbanded and each of the individual islands regained control over their own armies. Initially, the regiment consisted of the 1st Battalion and the 3rd Battalion (National Reserve); however, the increasing array of tasks that the regiment was called upon to perform led to it being stretched. So, in 1979, 3 companies and part of the HQ of the 1st Battalion were split and used to form the 2nd Battalion; this mirrored the form and functions of the 1st Battalion. In 1999, the 2nd Battalion had the honour of mounting the guard at Buckingham Palace. The 1st Battalion undertook this during a visit to the UK in July and August 2007.http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/313820.stm In 1983, the regiment participated in the United States-led invasion of Grenada. In 2019 the Jamaican government announced that the Jamaica Defence Force (JDF) would be expanded. As a result of this growth the Jamaica Regiment will fulfill two functions. Firstly, it will continue as a \\"British-style\\" infantry regiment that is the spiritual home and repository of customs and traditions for a number of battalions that do not necessarily serve together operationally. Secondly, it will act as a brigade-level formation for 4 battalions of the regiment as well as a combat support battalion.https://www.jdfweb.com/jamaica- regiment At the end of the planned growth, the Jamaica Regiment will consist of 4 regular battalions (1st, 2nd, 4th, and 5th) and 3 reserve battalions (3rd, 6th, and 9th).Regular battalions - https://www.jdfweb.com/jamaica- regiment.

Designed by Colonel Basile Gras, the Gras was a metallic cartridge adaptation of the single-shot, breech-loading, black powder Chassepot rifle. It was developed from 1872 to 1874 as a response to the German adoption of the Mauser Model 1871 metallic cartridge rifle. Modified in 1880 as the M80 with an improved breechblock and in 1914 as the M14 to accommodate the 8√ó50mmR Lebel smokeless powder cartridge, the Gras was replaced as the standard-issue service rifle by the Lebel in 1886. Description The Model 1874 sword bayonet. Converted from the Chassepot, the Gras\\"11x59R French Gras\\" in Barnes, Frank C. Cartridges of the World (DBI, 1972), P.199. was in caliber and used black powder centerfire metallic cartridges with a bullet over a charge. It was a robust and hard-hitting single-shot weapon. Additionally it had a triangular-shaped Model 1874 \\"Gras\\" sword bayonet. The Gras rifle was replaced from 1886 by the Lebel rifle. Development The Gras was manufactured in response to the development of the Boxer cartridge in 1866, and the British 1870 Martini‚ÄìHenry rifle which used it.The Tools of Empire by Daniel R. Headrick p.98 Those were soon emulated by the Germans with the 1871 Mauser. The French Army set up a study group in September 1872 that chose the metallic over the paper cartridge. A second study group in 1873 looked at various metallic cartridge adaptations. Colonel Gras proposed a modification of the Chassepot to accept metal cartridges and on 7 July 1874, the French Army chose his design over the Dutch Beaumont M1871 rifle. History Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization anti-Ottoman guerrilla with Gras rifles, circa 1903. The Hellenic Army adopted the Gras in 1877, and it was used in all conflicts until the Second World War. It became the favourite weapon of Greek guerrilla fighters, from the various revolts against the Ottoman Empire to the resistance against the Axis, acquiring legendary status. The name entered the Greek language, and grades (Œ≥Œ∫œÅŒ¨Œ¥ŒµœÇ) was a term colloquially applied to all rifles during the first half of the 20th century. It was manufactured by Manufacture d'armes de Saint-√âtienne, one of several government-owned arms factories in France. However most of the Gras rifles (60,000) used by the Hellenic military were manufactured under licence by Steyr in Austria. The Gras rifle was partly the inspiration for the development of the Japanese Murata rifle, Japan's first locally-made service rifle. According to the Vietnamese historian Ph·∫°m VƒÉn S∆°n, a Vietnamese general in the C·∫ßn V∆∞∆°ng movement, Cao VƒÉn Th·∫Øng, managed to copy the design of \\"an 1874 type fast-firing rifle of French\\". However, the Vietnamese version did not have a rifled barrel, and the range was limited.Ph·∫°m VƒÉn S∆°n, Vi·ªát s·ª≠ t√¢n bi√™n (quy·ªÉn 5, t·∫≠p trung).

Modifications during World War I  = Modified rifle = In 1914, the French Army modified 146,000 rifles to fire 8 mm Lebel in 1914, by using the barrel of a Lebel or Berthier rifle. They were used by second-line troops. In 1940, after the French defeat, most of these rifles were destroyed by the German occupiers. =Grenade Launcher= Gras rifles and the 11x59mmR cartridges were also widely used by front line troops as converted grenade launchers, known as Bombardes DR (grenade throwers) these conversions had cut down barrels and butts of varying workmanship and fired blank cartridges to propel the grenade, and were used as a crude form of trench mortar.

A name such as W√¶gmunding meant \\"belongs to W√¶gmund\\", i.e. they were the descendants of a man named W√¶gmund. This was the normal way of naming a Germanic clan (e.g. Sigurd the V√∂lsung, descendant of king V√∂lsung, Folkung [descendants of Folke] and Yngling [descendants of Yngvi-Freyr]). Members: *W√¶gmund (the ancestor of the clan) *√Ülfhere (seems to have been a distinguished member of the clan as Wiglaf is described as his kinsman) *Ecg√æeow (joined the Danes and the Geats as he was banished for slaying a man from another clan) *Beowulf (son of Ecg√æeow and the hero of the epic by his name) *Weohstan (Swedish champion and slayer of his fugitive countryman prince Eanmund) *Wiglaf (the last of the W√¶gmundings and son of Weohstan. He fought with Beowulf against the dragon) The story of this clan in Beowulf is that Ecg√æeow slew a man, Hea√∞olaf, from another clan, the Wulfings (probably the rulers of the less known East Geats). As the W√¶gmundings would not or could not pay the expected wergild, Ecgtheow was banished and sought refuge among the Danes. The Danish king Hrothgar paid the wergild and had Ecg√æeow swear an oath. Later, Ecg√æeow served the Geats and distinguished himself enough to marry the Geatish king Hre√∞el's daughter, with whom he had the son Beowulf. During the Swedish-Geatish wars, Ecg√æeow's close relative, Weohstan, fought on the Swedish side for Onela, and killed Onela's nephew Eanmund. The fact that these characters are described as W√¶gmundings explains why the Swedish warrior Wiglaf became the companion of Beowulf although his father had fought against the Geats. Since Ecg√æeow, Beowulf's father, was a close relative of Weohstan, Wiglaf's father, it is not surprising that Wiglaf (after his father's death) joined his relative Beowulf in Geatland, and that Beowulf assumed responsibility for the young Swede. On the ethnic identity of the W√¶gmundings In the epic we learn that Wiglaf was a Scylfing which literally refers to the ruling family of Sweden, and defines Wiglaf as a Swede. We also learn that Wiglaf's father, Weohstan, was a W√¶gmunding and fought on the Swedish side. Concerning Beowulf's father the text tells us that he was a W√¶gmunding and that he was banished for killing the man of a different family, the Wulfings. This was standard procedure if the perpetrators family could not pay the wergild at the Ting. Since no other ethnic label is given for the W√¶gmundings, this makes a Swedish ethnicity the most likely one. This means that Beowulf was fighting his own kinsmen, on his father's side, when fighting the Swedes. According to researcher Gudmund Sch√ºtte, W√¶gmunding could be related to a Finnish mythological character, V√§in√§m√∂inen.

Under this law, in number of designated markets, including Bermondsey Market, if an item was sold between sunset and sunrise then its provenance could not be questioned, so stolen goods could be traded and good title would pass to the purchaser.https://www.independent.co.uk/money/thieves-charter-nears-end-of- its-reign-the-law-of-market-overt-may-be-on-its-way-out-as-david- berry-1421817.html To quote Minister for the Arts Estelle Morris in July 2003 during the Second Reading of the Dealing In Cultural Objects (Offences) Bill: :I did not have information about march√© ouvert in the deep recesses of my mind, but experts reliably inform me that it no longer exists.

He is most notably attested in the Mesha Stele and the Hebrew Bible.; ; , , . While he is most readily associated with the Moabites, according to he seems to have been the national deity of the Ammonites as well. Etymology The etymology of \\"Chemosh\\" is unknown, although it is believed to be related to the Semitic god Shamash. However, given that he is also known from Ebla as Kamish, it is also speculated he might be a form of the Mesopotamian deity Nergal. In the Bible According to the Hebrew Bible, the worship of this god, \\"the abomination of Moab,\\" was introduced at Jerusalem by Solomon (1 Kings 11:7), but was abolished by Josiah (2 Kings 23:13). (Eleventh-century Jewish commentator Rashi quotes a tradition that Solomon's wives built the temples to Chemosh and other deities, and that Solomon is considered responsible for not stopping them.)See Rashi on 1 Kings 11:7 On the Moabite stone, Mesha (2 Kings 3:5) ascribed his victories over the king of Israel to this god, \\"and Chemosh drove him out from before me.\\"Jewish Encyclopedia (1906), \\"Moabite Stone.\\" According to Morris Jastrow, Jr. and George Aaron Barton in the Jewish Encyclopedia,Entry for \\"Chemosh\\" The name of the father of Mesha, Chemosh-melek (\\"Chemosh is Malik\\" or \\"Chemosh is king\\"; compare Moabite Stone, line 1), indicates the possibility that Chemosh and Malik (or Moloch) were one and the same deity. Book of Judges 11:24 has been thought by some to be a proof of this, since it speaks of Chemosh as the god of the Ammonites, while Moloch is elsewhere their god (compare 1 Kings 11:7, 33). Solomon is said to have built a sanctuary to Chemosh on the Mount of Olives (I Kings 11:7, 33), which was maintained till the reform of Josiah (II Kings 23:13). This movement by Solomon was no doubt to some extent a political one, but it made the worship of Chemosh a part of the religious life of Israel for nearly 400 years.

He was born in Australia, educated at the University of Melbourne (BA, 1984), the University of Pittsburgh (PhD, 1989), and held academic positions at Indiana University and the Australian National University before returning to Melbourne as an Australian Research Council QEII Research Fellow. In 1998, he transitioned to part-time academic work allowing him to pursue private training and consulting, and in 2005 began working full-time at Austhink Software. In 2009 he transitioned to Managing Director of Austhink Consulting. He co-leads The SWARM Project at the University of Melbourne.  Research  Van Gelder's research has had three main phases, corresponding to his PhD research on distributed representation, his subsequent research on dynamics & cognition, and his current phase, research into reasoning skills. = Distributed representation = In his PhD thesis, completed under the supervision of John Haugeland and entitled \\"Distributed Representation\\" (1989) van Gelder gave the first sustained exploration of the general concept of distributed representation, and argued that it was a third fundamental kind of representation alongside language and imagery. = Dynamics and cognition = Van Gelder is a proponent of dynamicism or dynamic cognition in cognitive science. This is a theory of cognition that proposes that dynamical systems theory provides a better model (or metaphor) for human cognition than the 'computational' model. For example, that a Watt governor is a better metaphorical description of the way humans think than a Turing machine style computer. In his first regular academic position at Indiana University, van Gelder was heavily influenced by researchers such as Robert Port, James Townsend, Esther Thelen and Linda B. Smith who were exploring cognition from a dynamical perspective, i.e., applying the tools of dynamical systems to studying cognitive processes. Van Gelder published a series of articles providing a philosophical commentary on the dynamical approach, culminating in his 1998 paper in Behavioral and Brain Sciences, where he articulated the dynamical approach to cognition and argued that it should be taken seriously as a broad empirical hypothesis comparable to the dominant hypothesis that cognition is digital computation. In his most well-known paper, 'What Might Cognition Be If Not Computation,' van Gelder used the Watt Governor as a model to contrast with the Turing Machine. Van Gelder came to be known as one of the foremost proponents of the dynamical approach, and even as an advocate of anti-representationalism, though he explicitly disavowed that extreme position. = Informal reasoning skills = Since around 1998, van Gelder's research has been almost exclusively devoted to informal reasoning and critical thinking. In particular, he has been developing and evaluating an approach to improving these skills, known variously as The Reason Method, and LAMP (\\"Lots of Argument Mapping Practice\\"). The core idea in van Gelder's approach is that informal reasoning is a skill, and so should improve in the same way as any other skill. According to the leading theory of high-level skill acquisition, the critical ingredient is extensive \\"deliberate practice\\" (Ericsson). Van Gelder and his colleagues have shown that extensive deliberate practice can substantially enhance informal reasoning skills. ‚Äî preprint of 2004 paper in Teaching Philosophy 27:2. via ResearchGate Published Version (paywall) ] The main practical challenge in the LAMP approach was finding a way to enable students to engage in extensive deliberate practice of reasoning skills. To confront this, van Gelder and his colleague Andy Bulka developed the argument mapping software packages Reason!Able (2000) and Rationale (2006). Van Gelder uses this software to help 'teach' the first year philosophy subject Critical Thinking: The Art of Reasoning which reliably achieves substantial gains in the critical thinking abilities of students (0.7 to 0.85 standard deviations) as measured by pre and post semester testing with the use of control groups of the same ages as the student cohort both studying at Melbourne University and not studying at university. Van Gelder has also applied argument mapping to business decision making, and has released the Reasoning PowerPoint App for this purpose.  Critics  Chris Eliasmith wrote a critique of Tim van Gelder's dynamicism and his proposal to replace the Turing machine by the Watt governor as a model of cognition. Eliasmith argued that the Turing machine concept is more encompassing and better suited as a guiding metaphor than the Watt governor, because the latter is a concrete machine and the former is a mathematical abstraction representing of a whole class of machines.

To its immediate south is Weetwood, to the west are Cookridge and Holt Park, to the east are Alwoodley and Moortown, and to the north are Bramhope, Arthington and Eccup. It forms part of the Leeds City Council ward of Adel & Wharfedale and the parliamentary constituency of Leeds North West. In common with many areas of Leeds it is not easy to define the boundaries of Adel, but Adel Church and the two schools are well to the east of Otley Road, the A660, although the post office is on that road. There is one public house in Adel, the Lawnswood Arms, and there is a restaurant/pub on the Otley Road around the corner from Gainsborough Avenue.  History  Drawing of Adel by W. Braithwaite in 1878. Adel is situated near the site of a Roman fort, the ancient road from Tadcaster to Ilkley passing nearby. (The footpath by the side of Long Causeway was said to be made from the original Roman stones, until they were removed by the council in the 1960s because they were unsafe. Some of the footpath has been replaced, starting at the junction between Long Causeway and Stairfoot Lane, and continuing up to the entrance of Bedquilts playing fields.) Several inscribed stones from the Romano-British period were discovered in Adel, also a number of Anglo-Saxon stones were discovered in the church foundations during restoration work in 1864. Some of these items are on display in the Leeds City Museum, Cookridge Street. The Roman name for the area is long thought to have been Burgodunum, but the Yorkshire Archaeological Society argues that this is \\"dubious\\".Yorkshire Archaeological Society, Adel Settlement , accessed 1 January 2018A. L. F. Rivet and Colin Smith, however this is unsubstantiated and has never been proven absolutely. An alternative name is also Burgodurum, meaning the Fort by the Waterway. It has also been suggested that this was shortened to Burden, which is similar in sound to the Celtic Verdun, found in Belgium.The Place-Names of Roman Britain (London: Batsford, 1979), pp. 510‚Äì14. It is probable that a Saxon village sprang up around the fort and that a church was built in the village. Adel is mentioned in the 1086 Domesday Book as Adele. Another spelling used until 1816 is Addle. Most recent authorities derive the name from the Old English adela ‚Äòdirty, muddy place‚Äô,Harry Parkin, Your City's Place-Names: Leeds, English Place-Name Society City-Names Series, 3 (Nottingham: English Place-Names Society, 2017), p. 12. but arguments have also been made for a personal name Ada (or similar Anglo-Saxon names such as Eadda, Eada or √Üdda) + Old English lƒìah 'open ground, lea' (compare the terminus spelling of nearby Headingley DB: Hedingelei & hedingeleia).Alaric Hall, 'On the Etymology of Adel', in Wawnarstr√¶ti (alla lei√∞ til √çslands) lagt Andrew Wawn 65 √°ra 27. okt√≥ber 2009, ed. by Robert Cook, Terry Gunnell, Margr√©t Eggertsd√≥ttir and √û√≥runn Sigur√∞ard√≥ttir (Reykjav√≠k: Menningar- og minningjasj√≥√∞ur Mette Magnussen, 2009), pp. 39‚Äì42; http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/10184/. The parish of Adel stretched to the River Wharfe in the north and included Adel, Arthington, Breary, Cookridge and Eccup. In 1152, the nearby Cistercian abbey at Kirkstall was founded. At the same time, the church of St John the Baptist was built in Adel to replace the older Saxon building. Although the present church is Norman, it looks quite similar to the late 7th century Anglo-Saxon church in Ledsham village, \\"the oldest church (and the oldest building) standing in West Yorkshire\\". Adel Church Three faces from the corbel frieze around Adel Church, Leeds, UK, c. 1150‚Äì70, with Romanesque window bottom left. The Church of St John the Baptist, Adel parish church, is described as \\"one of the best and most complete Norman churches in Yorkshire\\". It is a Grade I listed building; the sundial, mounting block and several memorials are Grade II listed. It was built in Romanesque style around 1150‚Äì1170 and has been little altered since, although a bell-cote was added in 1838‚Äì39 by R. D. Chantrell. The doorway, protected by a modern wooden roof, has an ornately carved arch with animals heads and zig-zag patterns; inside, there are 81 decorative corbels on the north and south walls with animals and representations of Christ's baptism and crucifixion, and the chancel arch has 37 grotesque beakheads and zig-zag decoration. Above the south doorway, the gable was filled with panels with the Evangelists and Christ in Majesty. The medieval font has an oak canopy by Eric Gill, and possibly a leper's window survives in the chancel though the evidence for this is poor given the nearest Leper Colony was some distance away and other churches were much closer. The Romanesque bronze doorknocker, often referred to as a Sanctuary Ring, is a replica, as the original was stolen in 2002.Rita Wood, 'The Romanesque Sculpture at Adel Church, West Riding ‚Äî A Suggested Interpretation', Yorkshire Archaeological Journal, 85 (2013), 97‚Äì130 (p. 108). It was 'probably made in York c. 1200 (cf. All Saints' Pavement, York)' and 'was of excellent quality ... with a monster's head, probably a lion, clasping the ring and a man's head protruding from its mouth'. The sculpture has been understood to represent the animal swallowing a person,Nikolaus Pevsner, The Buildings of England: Yorkshire, West Riding, 2nd edn by Enid Radcliffe (London: Penguin, 1967), p. 339. a warning of mankind's fate at the Day of Judgment, but it has also been suggested that 'there is nothing exaggeratedly fearsome about this lion that we should assume the man is being eaten ... he could be waking up, taking a breath, coming out of the mouth rather than being chewed or swallowed'.Rita Wood, 'The Romanesque Sculpture at Adel Church, West Riding ‚Äî A Suggested Interpretation', Yorkshire Archaeological Journal, 85 (2013), 97‚Äì130 (p. 108). Because of thefts of stones from the graveyard, all the church's paving stones are engraved with crosses.

When differential equations are employed, the theory is called continuous dynamical systems. From a physical point of view, continuous dynamical systems is a generalization of classical mechanics, a generalization where the equations of motion are postulated directly and are not constrained to be Euler‚ÄìLagrange equations of a least action principle. When difference equations are employed, the theory is called discrete dynamical systems. When the time variable runs over a set that is discrete over some intervals and continuous over other intervals or is any arbitrary time-set such as a Cantor set, one gets dynamic equations on time scales. Some situations may also be modeled by mixed operators, such as differential- difference equations. This theory deals with the long-term qualitative behavior of dynamical systems, and studies the nature of, and when possible the solutions of, the equations of motion of systems that are often primarily mechanical or otherwise physical in nature, such as planetary orbits and the behaviour of electronic circuits, as well as systems that arise in biology, economics, and elsewhere. Much of modern research is focused on the study of chaotic systems. This field of study is also called just dynamical systems, mathematical dynamical systems theory or the mathematical theory of dynamical systems. The Lorenz attractor is an example of a non-linear dynamical system. Studying this system helped give rise to chaos theory.  Overview  Dynamical systems theory and chaos theory deal with the long-term qualitative behavior of dynamical systems. Here, the focus is not on finding precise solutions to the equations defining the dynamical system (which is often hopeless), but rather to answer questions like \\"Will the system settle down to a steady state in the long term, and if so, what are the possible steady states?\\", or \\"Does the long-term behavior of the system depend on its initial condition?\\" An important goal is to describe the fixed points, or steady states of a given dynamical system; these are values of the variable that don't change over time. Some of these fixed points are attractive, meaning that if the system starts out in a nearby state, it converges towards the fixed point. Similarly, one is interested in periodic points, states of the system that repeat after several timesteps. Periodic points can also be attractive. Sharkovskii's theorem is an interesting statement about the number of periodic points of a one-dimensional discrete dynamical system. Even simple nonlinear dynamical systems often exhibit seemingly random behavior that has been called chaos. The branch of dynamical systems that deals with the clean definition and investigation of chaos is called chaos theory.  History  The concept of dynamical systems theory has its origins in Newtonian mechanics. There, as in other natural sciences and engineering disciplines, the evolution rule of dynamical systems is given implicitly by a relation that gives the state of the system only a short time into the future. Before the advent of fast computing machines, solving a dynamical system required sophisticated mathematical techniques and could only be accomplished for a small class of dynamical systems. Some excellent presentations of mathematical dynamic system theory include , , , and .Jerome R. Busemeyer (2008), \\"Dynamic Systems\\". To Appear in: Encyclopedia of cognitive science, Macmillan. Retrieved 8 May 2008.  Concepts  = Dynamical systems = The dynamical system concept is a mathematical formalization for any fixed \\"rule\\" that describes the time dependence of a point's position in its ambient space. Examples include the mathematical models that describe the swinging of a clock pendulum, the flow of water in a pipe, and the number of fish each spring in a lake. A dynamical system has a state determined by a collection of real numbers, or more generally by a set of points in an appropriate state space. Small changes in the state of the system correspond to small changes in the numbers. The numbers are also the coordinates of a geometrical space‚Äîa manifold. The evolution rule of the dynamical system is a fixed rule that describes what future states follow from the current state. The rule may be deterministic (for a given time interval only one future state follows from the current state) or stochastic (the evolution of the state is subject to random shocks). = Dynamicism = Dynamicism, also termed the dynamic hypothesis or the dynamic hypothesis in cognitive science or dynamic cognition, is a new approach in cognitive science exemplified by the work of philosopher Tim van Gelder. It argues that differential equations are more suited to modelling cognition than more traditional computer models. = Nonlinear system = In mathematics, a nonlinear system is a system that is not linear‚Äîi.e., a system that does not satisfy the superposition principle. Less technically, a nonlinear system is any problem where the variable(s) to solve for cannot be written as a linear sum of independent components. A nonhomogeneous system, which is linear apart from the presence of a function of the independent variables, is nonlinear according to a strict definition, but such systems are usually studied alongside linear systems, because they can be transformed to a linear system as long as a particular solution is known.  Related fields  = Arithmetic dynamics = :Arithmetic dynamics is a field that emerged in the 1990s that amalgamates two areas of mathematics, dynamical systems and number theory. Classically, discrete dynamics refers to the study of the iteration of self-maps of the complex plane or real line. Arithmetic dynamics is the study of the number-theoretic properties of integer, rational, -adic, and/or algebraic points under repeated application of a polynomial or rational function. = Chaos theory = :Chaos theory describes the behavior of certain dynamical systems ‚Äì that is, systems whose state evolves with time ‚Äì that may exhibit dynamics that are highly sensitive to initial conditions (popularly referred to as the butterfly effect). As a result of this sensitivity, which manifests itself as an exponential growth of perturbations in the initial conditions, the behavior of chaotic systems appears random. This happens even though these systems are deterministic, meaning that their future dynamics are fully defined by their initial conditions, with no random elements involved. This behavior is known as deterministic chaos, or simply chaos. = Complex systems = :Complex systems is a scientific field that studies the common properties of systems considered complex in nature, society, and science. It is also called complex systems theory, complexity science, study of complex systems and/or sciences of complexity. The key problems of such systems are difficulties with their formal modeling and simulation. From such perspective, in different research contexts complex systems are defined on the base of their different attributes. :The study of complex systems is bringing new vitality to many areas of science where a more typical reductionist strategy has fallen short. Complex systems is therefore often used as a broad term encompassing a research approach to problems in many diverse disciplines including neurosciences, social sciences, meteorology, chemistry, physics, computer science, psychology, artificial life, evolutionary computation, economics, earthquake prediction, molecular biology and inquiries into the nature of living cells themselves. = Control theory = :Control theory is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering and mathematics, in part it deals with influencing the behavior of dynamical systems. = Ergodic theory = :Ergodic theory is a branch of mathematics that studies dynamical systems with an invariant measure and related problems. Its initial development was motivated by problems of statistical physics. = Functional analysis = :Functional analysis is the branch of mathematics, and specifically of analysis, concerned with the study of vector spaces and operators acting upon them. It has its historical roots in the study of functional spaces, in particular transformations of functions, such as the Fourier transform, as well as in the study of differential and integral equations. This usage of the word functional goes back to the calculus of variations, implying a function whose argument is a function. Its use in general has been attributed to mathematician and physicist Vito Volterra and its founding is largely attributed to mathematician Stefan Banach. = Graph dynamical systems = :The concept of graph dynamical systems (GDS) can be used to capture a wide range of processes taking place on graphs or networks. A major theme in the mathematical and computational analysis of graph dynamical systems is to relate their structural properties (e.g. the network connectivity) and the global dynamics that result. = Projected dynamical systems = :Projected dynamical systems it is a mathematical theory investigating the behaviour of dynamical systems where solutions are restricted to a constraint set. The discipline shares connections to and applications with both the static world of optimization and equilibrium problems and the dynamical world of ordinary differential equations. A projected dynamical system is given by the flow to the projected differential equation. = Symbolic dynamics = :Symbolic dynamics is the practice of modelling a topological or smooth dynamical system by a discrete space consisting of infinite sequences of abstract symbols, each of which corresponds to a state of the system, with the dynamics (evolution) given by the shift operator. = System dynamics = :System dynamics is an approach to understanding the behaviour of systems over time. It deals with internal feedback loops and time delays that affect the behaviour and state of the entire system.MIT System Dynamics in Education Project (SDEP) What makes using system dynamics different from other approaches to studying systems is the use of feedback loops and stocks and flows. These elements help describe how even seemingly simple systems display baffling nonlinearity. = Topological dynamics = :Topological dynamics is a branch of the theory of dynamical systems in which qualitative, asymptotic properties of dynamical systems are studied from the viewpoint of general topology.  Applications  = In biomechanics = In sports biomechanics, dynamical systems theory has emerged in the movement sciences as a viable framework for modeling athletic performance and efficiency. From a dynamical systems perspective, the human movement system is a highly intricate network of co-dependent sub-systems (e.g. respiratory, circulatory, nervous, skeletomuscular, perceptual) that are composed of a large number of interacting components (e.g. blood cells, oxygen molecules, muscle tissue, metabolic enzymes, connective tissue and bone). In dynamical systems theory, movement patterns emerge through generic processes of self-organization found in physical and biological systems.Paul S Glazier, Keith Davids, Roger M Bartlett (2003). \\"DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS THEORY: a Relevant Framework for Performance-Oriented Sports Biomechanics Research\\". in: Sportscience 7. Accessed 2008-05-08. There is no research validation of any of the claims associated to the conceptual application of this framework. = In cognitive science = Dynamical system theory has been applied in the field of neuroscience and cognitive development, especially in the neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development. It is the belief that cognitive development is best represented by physical theories rather than theories based on syntax and AI. It also believed that differential equations are the most appropriate tool for modeling human behavior. These equations are interpreted to represent an agent's cognitive trajectory through state space. In other words, dynamicists argue that psychology should be (or is) the description (via differential equations) of the cognitions and behaviors of an agent under certain environmental and internal pressures. The language of chaos theory is also frequently adopted. In it, the learner's mind reaches a state of disequilibrium where old patterns have broken down. This is the phase transition of cognitive development. Self-organization (the spontaneous creation of coherent forms) sets in as activity levels link to each other. Newly formed macroscopic and microscopic structures support each other, speeding up the process. These links form the structure of a new state of order in the mind through a process called scalloping (the repeated building up and collapsing of complex performance.) This new, novel state is progressive, discrete, idiosyncratic and unpredictable. Dynamic systems theory has recently been used to explain a long-unanswered problem in child development referred to as the A-not-B error. =In second language development= The application of Dynamic Systems Theory to study second language acquisition is attributed to Diane Larsen-Freeman who published an article in 1997 in which she claimed that second language acquisition should be viewed as a developmental process which includes language attrition as well as language acquisition. In her article she claimed that language should be viewed as a dynamic system which is dynamic, complex, nonlinear, chaotic, unpredictable, sensitive to initial conditions, open, self-organizing, feedback sensitive, and adaptive.

The elevated nature of the trail (the highest part of the line is at Ladmanlow, at a height of ) affords many splendid views across the countryside. However, these higher sections can also be very exposed in poor weather. The original railway incorporated a number of inclines at its northern and southern ends, and whilst much of the trail is fairly level, these sections are naturally steeper. At Parsley Hay, about southwest of Bakewell, the High Peak Trail is joined by the Tissington Trail, another route of the National Cycle Network, which was formerly the railway branch line to Ashbourne. The High Peak Trail (and part of the Tissington Trail) are also designated part of the Pennine Bridleway, a leisure route which starts at Middleton Top, near Cromford, and includes through Derbyshire to the South Pennines. The Trail also forms part of the Midshires Way, a long-distance footpath and bridleway which runs for through the Midlands from Bledlow to Stockport. The High Peak Trail forms part of the White Peak Loop Trail, a route for walking, cycling and horse riding in the Peak District. It links the High Peak Trail with the Monsal Trail, with linking sections through the towns of Buxton, Bakewell and Matlock. The White Peak Loop is being developed by Derbyshire County Council and some sections are not yet complete.

Located in Nine Elms, London, the market covers a site of and is home to about 200 fruit, vegetable, and flower companies. The market serves 40% of the fruit and vegetables eaten outside of the home in London and provides ingredients to many of London's top restaurants, hotels, schools, prisons, hospitals, and catering businesses. New Covent Garden Market - flower market The Flower Market, which offers an extensive range of flowers, plants, foliages, sundries and interior decorations from the UK and from around the globe, is visited by 75% of florists in London, many of whom place morning orders and return to restock during the day as needed. The Flower Market wholesalers are open from 04:00 to 10:00 Monday to Saturday and the Fruit & Vegetable Market wholesalers trade from around 00:00 - 06:00 Monday to Saturday. There is a ¬£5 entry fee for visitors driving to the market. The nearest London Underground station is Vauxhall on the Victoria line. Vauxhall also has a railway station, with good connections to Waterloo and Clapham Junction, and a large bus station with buses departing frequently to destinations all across London. The proposed Nine Elms tube station on the Northern line extension to Battersea will serve the market. History New Covent Garden - external view The market is run by a statutory corporation, the Covent Garden Market Authority (CGMA), which reports to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). Set up in 1961, the CGMA was charged with modernising and overseeing the administration of the vegetable market, then located at Covent Garden in central London, which was considered strategically important as a wholesale food and flower market. Construction began in 1971 on the site of the former Nine Elms Locomotive Works and Nine Elms railway station, and the market opened on 11 November 1974. Redevelopment Aerial view of the market Since 1990, it has been the policy of successive governments to dispose of the market as a going concern. Following a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers in 2005, the CGMA and DEFRA agreed on a plan (known as Project Chrysalis) to reform and redevelop the market to enable it to be eventually sold. The CGMA, which had previously paid any profits as dividends to HM Treasury, was allowed to retain its profits to fund the initial planning work. On 7 January 2013, the CGMA signed a contract with Vinci and St. Modwen for the market's regeneration. Most of the redevelopment will be funded by releasing spare land to the developers to build residential properties, with the overall project worth ¬£2 billion. Work is expected to start in 2015 and be complete by 2020, allowing the government to then disengage from the market.

The responsibilities of clerical workers commonly include record keeping, filing, staffing service counters, screening solicitors, and other administrative tasks. History and etymology The word clerk is derived from the Latin clericus meaning \\"cleric\\" or \\"clergyman\\", which is the latinisation of the Greek Œ∫ŒªŒ∑œÅŒπŒ∫œåœÇ (klƒìrikos) from a word meaning a \\"lot\\" (in the sense of drawing lots) and hence an \\"apportionment\\" or \\"area of land\\".Clerk, Online Etymology DictionaryKlerikos, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, \\"A Greek-English Lexicon\\", at Perseus The association derived from mediaeval courts, where writing was mainly entrusted to clergy because most laymen could not read. In this context, the word clerk meant \\"scholar\\". Even today, the term clerk regular designates a type of cleric (one living life according to a rule). The cognate terms in some languages, e.g., Klerk in Dutch, became ‚Äì at the end of the nineteenth century ‚Äì restricted to a specific, fairly low rank in the administrative hierarchy. United States Clerical workers are perhaps the largest occupational group in the United States. In 2004, there were 3.1 million general office clerks, 1.5 million office administrative supervisors and 4.1 million secretaries. Clerical occupations often do not require a college degree, though some college education or 1 to 2 years in vocational programs are common qualifications. Familiarity with office equipment and certain software programs is also often required. Employers may provide clerical training. In 2006, the median salary for clerks was $23,000, while the national median income for workers age 25 or older was $33,000. Median salaries ranged from $22,770 for general office clerks to $34,970 for secretaries and $41,030 for administrative supervisors. Clerical workers are considered working class by American sociologists such as William Thompson, Joseph Hickey or James Henslin as they perform highly routinized tasks with relatively little autonomy. Sociologist Dennis Gilbert, argues that the white and blue collar divide has shifted to a divide between professionals, including some semi-professionals, and routinized white collar workers. White collar office supervisors may be considered lower middle class with some secretaries being located in that part of the socio-economic strata where the working and middle classes overlap.

It consists of two adjacent street markets. Wentworth Street Market is open six days a week and Middlesex Street Market is open on Sunday only.  The modern market  It is one of a number of traditional markets located to the east of the City of London. A few hundred yards to the north is Old Spitalfields Market, which has been refurbished, and across Commercial Street, to the east, lies Brick Lane Market. A half mile further east is the Columbia Road Flower Market. Petticoat Lane Market was not formally recognised until an Act of Parliament in 1936, but its long history as an informal market makes it possibly one of the oldest surviving markets in Britain. The market is open Monday to Friday on Wentworth Street; on Sunday it extends over many of the surrounding streets, with over a thousand stalls. It is closed on Saturday, and on Sunday closes at about 2 pm. The markets are well signed from local stations. Petticoat Lane market is listed as a tourist attraction on VisitLondon.com, the official visitor guide for London. The name Petticoat Lane came from not only the sale of petticoats but from the fable that \\"they would steal your petticoat at one end of the market and sell it back to you at the other.\\" History of the market In Tudor times, Middlesex Street was known as Hogs Lane, a pleasant lane lined by hedgerows and elms. It is thought city bakers were allowed to keep pigs in the lane, outside the city wall;Strype (1720) in 'Middlesex Street', A Dictionary of London (1918). Date accessed: 24 November 2008. or possibly that it was an ancient droving trail. The lane's rural nature changed, and by 1590, country cottages stood by the city walls.Petticoat Lane article at East London History . Date accessed: 7 October 2006. By 1608, it had become a commercial district where second-hand clothes and bric-√†-brac were sold and exchanged, known as 'Peticote Lane'.Ryther's Map of 1608 This was also where the Spanish ambassador had his house, and the area attracted many Spaniards from the reign of James I. Peticote Lane was severely affected by the Great Plague of 1665; the rich fled, and London lost a fifth of its population. Middlesex Street Market, circa 1890 Petticoat Lane in the 1920s Petticoat Lane in 1971 Huguenots fleeing persecution arrived in the late 17th century; many settled in the area, and master weavers settled in the new town of Spitalfields. The area already had an association with clothing, with dyeing a local industry. The cloth was pegged out on hooks in the surrounding fields. These were known as tentergrounds. From the mid-18th century, Petticoat Lane became a centre for manufacturing clothes. The market served the well-to-do in the City, selling new garments. About 1830, Peticote Lane's name changed to Middlesex Street, to record the boundary between Portsoken Ward, in the City of London, and Whitechapel, which coincided with the Lane. But the old name continues to be associated with the area.There is a popular canard that the name change was to protect Victorian sensibilities about undergarments, but the change occurred during the reign of William IV. From 1882, a wave of Jewish immigrants fleeing persecution in eastern Europe settled in the area. The chapels, which had previously served the Huguenot community, were adapted as synagogues. Many Jewish relief societies were founded to aid the poor.Some of the buildings of Jewish relief agencies can still be seen in the area. Many have recently been converted to luxury flats in another round of adaptation. Jewish immigrants entered the local garment industry and maintained the traditions of the market. The severe damage inflicted throughout the East End during the Blitz and later bombing in World War II served to disperse the Jewish communities to new areas. The area around Middlesex Street suffered a decline. The market continued to prosper. Beginning in the 1970s, a new wave of immigration from India and east Asia restored the area's vitality - centred on nearby Brick Lane. In previous times the market was unpopular with the authorities, as it was largely unregulated and in some sense illegal. As recently as the 1930s, police cars and fire engines were driven down The Lane, with alarm bells ringing, to disrupt the market. The rights of the market were finally protected by Act of Parliament in 1936.whitechapelsociety.com As late as the 1990s, if Christmas Day fell on a Sunday (which in that decade only occurred in 1994), many of the local Jewish traders would still assert their right to open on a Sunday. 'The Lane' was always renowned for the 'patter' and showmanship of the market traders. Some, selling crockery, would pile an entire setting onto a large plate, and then send the lot, high into the air. Catching the construction on its way down was to demonstrate the skill of the vendor, and the robustness of the porcelain. A prominent businessman, Alan Sugar, got his start as a stall holder in the market. The market remains busy and vibrant, reflecting both its immigrant history and its continuing popularity with locals and tourists.

It stars Richard Widmark and Lena Horne, and features an original score by Oliver Nelson. The theme of the film is the \\"passing\\" of the West, the clash between a traditional character and the politics and demands of modern society. Plot In the town of Cottonwood Springs, Texas at the turn of the century, Marshal Frank Patch is an Old West style lawman in a community determined to be modern. When Patch kills drunken Luke Mills in self-defense, the town decides it is time for the marshal to resign. But Patch refuses, reminding the citizens that when he took the job, the agreement was he could have it as long as he wanted. Afraid of Patch because of his knowledge of their misdeeds in the town's wilder days, the city fathers then decide the only way to remove Patch from office is by violence. Patch humiliates one of the town's councilmen, a cowardly shopkeeper, by slapping him. The man plans to kill Patch, but when Patch faces him down, he turns the gun on himself. The man's son swears revenge, supported by local leaders. They plot to ambush Patch. Aware that he will probably be killed, Patch marries his long-time girlfriend, the local brothel madame. The marriage is on the same day as the shopkeeper's funeral, after which Patch's death is planned. The dead man's son attempts to kill Patch on his own, but is shot by Patch. Patch explains to the dying youth that his father had murdered a man many years ago. Patch covered it up because he had agreed to raise the dead man's child. Patch pursues one of the instigators of the plot to kill him. He wounds and captures him, but then insists on going back out, knowing he will be gunned down. He is shot by hidden gunmen on the rooftops. Alan Smithee credit The film began under the direction of Robert Totten, an experienced television director (Gunsmoke, The Legend of Jesse James).

Coventry, The Tolkien Society, 2008. Dennis L. McKiernan's Silver Call duology was intended to be a direct sequel to The Lord of the Rings but had to be altered. The Iron Tower trilogy, highly influenced by Tolkien's books, was then written as backstory.Interview with Dennis L. McKiernan Throughout the next two decades, the term \\"fantasy\\" became synonymous with the general aspects of Tolkien's work: multiple races including dwarves and elves, a quest to destroy a magical artifact, and an evil that seeks to control the world. The plot of Novelist Pat Murphy's There and Back Again intentionally mirrors that of The Hobbit, but is transposed into a science-fiction setting involving space travel. J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter has been seen as having been influenced by Tolkien's work, particularly the wizard Dumbledore being partially inspired by Tolkien's Gandalf.Louise Wetherill, Ampthill Literary Festival Yearbook 2015. Ampthill. (2015) . pp. 85‚Äì92. The Inheritance Cycle by Christopher Paolini largely rehashed the setting and languages of The Lord of the Rings, as well as creatures such as elves and dwarves having nearly identical qualities to the Elves and Dwarves of Middle-earth (though the plot is much more similar to that of Star Wars). Some people have gone so far as to accuse Paolini of plagiarism.Eragon ‚Äì Plagiarism Made Popular S.M. Stirling's \\"Emberverse\\" series includes a character obsessed with The Lord of the Rings who creates a post-apocalyptic community based upon the Elves and D√∫nedain of Middle-earth. The same plot point was used by the Russian writer Vladimir Berezin in his novel Road Signs (from the Universe of Metro 2033). Another Russian writer, Kirill Eskov, wrote The Last Ringbearer, about the events in Lord of the Rings from the perspective of Sauron. Stephen King, best known for horror novels, has acknowledged Tolkien's influence on his novel The Stand as well as his fantasy series The Dark Tower. Several other prominent fantasy writers, including George R. R. Martin, Michael Swanwick, Raymond E. Feist, Poul Anderson, Karen Haber, Harry Turtledove, Charles De Lint, and Orson Scott Card, have all acknowledged Tolkien's work as an inspiration for their own fantasy work. =Graphic novels= Cartoonist Jeff Smith was influenced by Tolkien, and the mythologies that inspired his works. His epic 1,300-page graphic novel, Bone has been characterized by him as \\"Bugs Bunny meets The Lord of the Rings. It's a really long fairy tale with some fantasy elements but a lot of comedy.\\" =Parody= The first commercially published parody of Tolkien's work was the 1968 Bored of the Rings, by The Harvard Lampoon. The BBC produced a parody radio serial, Hordes of the Things, in 1980. The Last Ringbearer is a 1999 fantasy novel by Kirill Eskov in the form of a parallel novel showing the war from Sauron's perspective, under the notion that the original is a \\"history written by the victors\\".Laura Miller, Middle-earth according to Mordor, 15 February 2011.Benedicte Page, Lord of the Rings reworking a hit with fans, but not Tolkien estate, The Guardian, Tuesday 8 February 2011 Radio plays Three radio plays based on The Lord of the Rings have been made, broadcast in 1955‚Äì1956, 1979 and 1981 respectively. The first and last ones were produced by the BBC. Tolkien heavily criticised the 1955-56 production. Music Numerous songs and other musical works, in a wide range of idioms, have been inspired by Tolkien's fiction. =Rock and heavy metal = Hansi K√ºrsch, the Blind Guardian vocalist and lyrics writer, composed many songs about Middle Earth Jack Bruce wrote a song called \\"To Isengard\\", included in his first solo album \\"Songs for a Taylor\\" (1969). Progressive rock acts like Rush, Mostly Autumn, Glass Hammer, Bo Hansson and indie rock band Gatsbys American Dream have composed several songs based on Tolkien's characters and stories. Rock band Led Zeppelin wrote several songs inspired by Tolkien's works including \\"The Battle of Evermore\\", \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\", and \\"Ramble On,\\" with debate about some parts of \\"Stairway to Heaven\\").Bradford Lee Eden. Middle-earth Minstrel: Essays on Music in Tolkien. McFarland, 2010. . Tom Rapp set most of The Verse of the One Ring (\\"Three Rings for the Elven- kings under the sky...\\") to music as \\"Ring Thing\\" in Pearls Before Swine's second album, Balaklava (1968). Bob Catley, lead singer of the British prog rock band Magnum, released a solo album titled Middle Earth. Punk quartet Thrice released a song called \\"The Long Defeat\\" about Tolkien's philosophies. The East Texas-based rock band Hobbit has produced multiple albums inspired by Tolkien's work.http://www.hobbitband.com Many heavy metal artists were influenced by Tolkien. Blind Guardian composed many songs relating to Middle- earth, including the full concept album Nightfall in Middle Earth that follows The Silmarillion.[ Nightfall in Middle Earth: AllMusic Guide Review] Most songs by symphonic black metal SummoningSecond page of About.com interview with Summoning are based on Middle-Earth, with focus on the orcs and dark forces. The entire discography of multi-genred metal band Battlelore is also Tolkien-themed. Power metal bands like Epidemia, NightwishLyrics - Wishmaster :Tuomas comments the lyrics (Elvenpath, Wishmaster, among others), Megadeth (This Day We Fight!), Cruachan (Fall of Gondolin), Sabaton (Shadows of Mordor), and others, feature Tolkien-themed songs. Italian progressive band Ainur composed several albums inspired by Silmarillion stories in early 2000s.http://www.tolkien-music.com/ Some bands and certain musicians used Tolkien legendarium for their stage names. Progressive rock band Marillion derive their name from The Silmarillion,Mick Wall (1987). Market Square Heroes - The Authorised Story of Marillion. Sidgwick & Jackson Ltd. pp. 28. . Gorgoroth take their name from an area of Mordor, Burzum take their name from the Black Speech of Mordor, Cirith Ungol take their name from the pass on the western path of Mordor, the dwelling of the spider Shelob and Amon Amarth take their name after an alternative name for Mount Doom. Lead singer of Dimmu Borgir, Shagrath, takes his stage name from The Lord of the Rings, after an orc captain. =Jazz= Australian jazz musician and composer, John Sangster, made six albums of musical responses to Tolkien's work. He recorded The Hobbit Suite (1973, Swaggie Records ‚Äì S1340), and Double Vibe: Hobbit (1977); the first of these, with a selection from the second, was released on CD in 2002 (Swaggie CD 404).

The folk group The Hobbitons, part of the Dutch chapter of the Tolkien Society, released a CD in 1996 with 16 tracks of settings of Tolkien's poems. The Irish singer Enya contributed a song \\"May it Be\\" for The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) movie soundtrack. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. She released a song entitled \\"Lothl√≥rien\\", on her 1991 album Shepherd Moons. In 2001, bluegrass and anti- folk artist Chris Thile released an instrumental album titled Not All Who Wander Are Lost, referencing Gandalf's words to Bilbo and Bilbo's poem about Aragorn. One of the songs on the album is \\"Riddles in the Dark\\", sharing the title of one of the chapters in The Hobbit. The Celtic foursome Broceliande's album The Starlit Jewel sets to music selected songs by Tolkien.http://www.broceliande.org/recordings.html Other folk rock and new age musicians inspired by Tolkien include Za Fr√ªmi (singing in Orkish), Nickel Creek, David Arkenstone and Lyriel, among others. The Spanish Neoclassical Dark Wave band Narsilion derived its name from Tolkien's song \\"Narsilion\\" about the creation of the Sun and Moon. =Classical / film score= music for the film trilogy The Lord of the Rings. Donald Swann set music in the British art-song tradition to a collection of seven of Tolkien's lyrics and poems, published as The Road Goes Ever On. The work was approved by Tolkien himself, who collaborated on the published book (1968), to which he provided notes and commentary.Bard: Poems and Songs of Middle Earth - Notes The songs were recorded by William Elvin (bass-baritone) with Swann on piano, and released in 1967 on an LP by Caedmon Records. The Norwegian classical composer Martin Romberg has written three full-scale symphonic poems, Quendi (2008), Telperion et Laurelin (2014), and F√´anor (2017), inspired by passages from the Silmarillion. The works were premiered in Southern France. Romberg has also set Tolkien's Elven language poems to music in his work \\"Eldarinw√´ Liri\\" for girls' choir. The work premiered in 2010 with the Norwegian Girls Choir and Trio Medi√¶val at the Vestfold International Festival. Johan de Meij's Symphony No. 1, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", for concert band, is in five movements, each illustrating a personage or an important episode from the novel: Gandalf, Lothlorien, Gollum, Journey in the Dark (The Mines of Moria /The Bridge of Khazad-Dum), and Hobbits. The symphony was written between March 1984 and December 1987, and was premi√®red in Brussels on 15 March 1988.

His third symphony, Ainulindal√´, is based on the opening chapter of The Silmarillion, and there is a half-hour setting of The Lay of E√§rendil based on Bilbo's song at Rivendell. The Tolkien Ensemble have published their settings of all the poems in The Lord of the Rings on CDs. The Tolkien Ensemble published four CDs from 1997 to 2005 with the aim to create \\"the world's first complete musical interpretation of the poems and songs from The Lord of the Rings\\". The project was given approval by both the Tolkien Estate and Harper Collins Publishers. Queen Margarethe II of Denmark gave permission to use her illustrations in the CD layout. Aulis Sallinen, one of the leading classical music composers of Finland, composed his Seventh Symphony named \\"The Dreams of Gandalf\\" in 1996, from music initially meant to accompany a ballet. Canadian composer Glenn Buhr has written a three-movement tone poem Beren and L√∫thien which he has recorded with the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra as part of his CD Winter Poems.https://www.musiccentre.ca/node/8763 Games Many model-based games, trading card games, board games and video games are set in Middle-earth, most depicting scenes and characters from The Lord of the Rings. In a broader sense, many fantasy role-playing games such as Dungeons and Dragons (D&D;) and DragonQuest feature Tolkienesque creatures and were influenced by Tolkien's works. The books have been reproduced in video game form repeatedly, though without necessarily reflecting the power of Tolkien's storytelling. Early miniature wargames include The Ringbearer (1975). Games Workshop have made The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game (2001), which, while part of the film trilogy's merchandise, combines elements from both the books and films.Stevenson, Sean. 2013. Gaming in the World of J.R.R. Tolkien, Armchair General Early board games included Battle of Five Armies (1975) and the series of Middle Earth Games from Simulations Publications, Inc. in 1977, containing the games War of the Ring (strategic, covering all three books), Gondor (tactical, covering the siege of Minas Tirith) and Sauron (covering the decisive battle of the Second Age). More recent games include a game simply entitled Lord of the Rings (2000) and War of the Ring (2004, strategic, covering all three books). Among role-playing and card games based on Middle-earth, Iron Crown Enterprises made Middle-earth Role Playing game (1982‚Äì1999) and Middle-earth Collectible Card Game (1995‚Äì1999). Decipher created The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game (2001) and The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game (2002), both based on the Jackson films. The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game (2011) is made by Fantasy Flight Games under their \\"Living Card Game\\" line.

During World War I, Baring served in the Intelligence Corps and Royal Air Force. Life Baring was the eighth child, and fifth son, of Edward Charles Baring, first Baron Revelstoke, of the Baring banking family, and his wife Louisa Emily Charlotte Bulteel, granddaughter of the second Earl Grey. Born in Mayfair,Maurice Baring he was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge. After an abortive start of a diplomatic career, he travelled widely, particularly in Russia. He reported as an eye-witness of the Russo-Japanese War for the London Morning Post.Mosley, Charles (2003). Burke's Peerage, Baronetage & Knightage (Vol. 3), p. 3324; Baring, Maurice (1906). With the Russians in Manchuria, p. vi. At the start of World War I he joined the Royal Flying Corps, where he served as assistant to David Henderson and Hugh Trenchard in France. In 1918, Baring served as a staff officer in the Royal Air Force and was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1918 Birthday Honours. In 1925 Baring received an honorary commission as a wing commander in the Reserve of Air Force Officers. After his death, Trenchard wrote, \\"He was the most unselfish man I have ever met or am likely to meet. The Flying Corps owed to this man much more than they know or think.\\"Read, Piers Paul (2007). \\"What's become of Baring?\\", The Spectator, 10 October 2007. Reprinted in Chesterton Review, Spring-Summer 2008, pp. 309-311. After the war he enjoyed a period of success as a dramatist, and began to write novels. He suffered from chronic illness during the last years of his life; for the final 15 years of his life he was debilitated by Parkinson's disease. He was widely known socially, to some of the Cambridge Apostles, to The Coterie, and to the literary group associating with G. K. Chesterton and Hilaire Belloc in particular.Pearce, Joseph. \\"Maurice Baring, In the Shadow of the Chesterbelloc,\\" CatholiCity, 24 July 2010. He was staunch in his anti-intellectualism with respect to the arts, and a convinced practical joker. Previously an agnostic,Baring, Maurice (1910). Letter dated 3 May 1910 he converted to Roman Catholicism in 1909, \\"the only action in my life which I am quite certain I have never regretted.\\"Baring, Maurice (1922). The Puppet Show of Memory, pp. 395-396. Speaking from personal experience, however, he once advised Belloc to \\"never, never, never talk theology or discuss the Church with those outside it. People simply do not understand what you are talking about and they merely (a) get angry and (b) come to the conclusion that one doesn't believe in the thing oneself and that one is simply doing it to annoy.\\" Legacy Baring is remembered in verse in Belloc's Cautionary Verses: Like many of the upper class He liked the sound of broken glass A line I stole with subtle daring From Wing-Commander Maurice Baring He once gave Virginia Woolf a copy of his book C. She was not impressed, writing in her diary: \\"Second-rate art i.e. C., by Maurice Baring. Within its limits, it is not second rate, or there is nothing markedly so, at first go off. The limits are the proof of its non- existence. He can only do one thing; himself to wit; charming, clean, modest, sensitive Englishman. Outside that radius and it does not carry far nor illumine much, all is‚Äîas-it-should be‚Äîlight, sure, proportioned, affecting even; told in so well-bred a manner that nothing is exaggerated, all related, proportioned.

The character, Horne Fisher, the protagonist of The Man Who Knew Too Much, a collection of detective stories by G.K. Chesterton, \\"is generally thought to be based on Chesterton‚Äôs good friend, Maurice Baring.\\" Although, while \\"Fisher fits Baring‚Äôs physical description, he is a respected member of the upper class, and he seems to know everybody and everything,\\" the similarity ends there, Chesterton scholar, Dale Ahlquist notes: \\"By all accounts, the real Baring was a charming, affable gentleman who knew how to laugh and had no fear of making a fool of himself,\\" while \\"Horne Fisher is distinctly lacking in both the charm and humour departments.\\" Works *The Black Prince and Other Poems (1903) * With the Russians in Manchuria.

He left Orangefield School early and began work as a heating engineer. However, he continued an interest in literature by attending night classes and in 1970 gained a place at the University of Ulster in Coleraine. Other writers there at that time included Gerald Dawe and Brendan Hamill. In the mid 1980s Keenan returned to the Magee College campus of the university for postgraduate study. Afterwards he accepted a teaching position at the American University of Beirut, where he worked for about four months. Hostage On the morning of 11 April 1986 Keenan was kidnapped by Islamic Jihad. After spending two months in isolation, he was moved to a cell shared with the British journalist John McCarthy. He was kept blindfolded throughout most of his ordeal, and was chained by hand and foot when he was taken out of solitary. The British and American governments at the time had a policy that they would not negotiate with terrorists and Keenan was considered by some to have been ignored. Because he was travelling on both Irish and British passports, the Irish government made numerous diplomatic representations for his release, working closely with the Iranian government. Throughout the kidnap they also provided support to his two sisters, Elaine Spence and Brenda Gillham, who were spearheading the campaign for Brian's release. He was released from captivity to Syrian military forces on 24 August 1990 and was driven to Damascus. There he was handed over by the Syrian Foreign Ministry to the care of Irish Ambassador, Declan Connolly. His sisters were flown by Irish Government executive jet to Damascus to meet him and bring him home to Northern Ireland. He now lives in Dublin.

The book revolves heavily around the great friendship he experienced with fellow hostage John McCarthy, and the brutality that was inflicted upon them by their captors. It was the 1991 winner of the Irish Times Literature Prize for Non-fiction and the Christopher Ewart-Biggs Memorial Prize. It was also enthusiastically reviewed. Sebastian Faulks in the Independent on Sunday said \\"The scope and grandeur of his reflections is supported by the concrete detail of his narrative. It is a moving and remarkable triumph.\\" In the Irish Times, Frank McGuinness claimed that \\"From the horror has come something wonderful. An Evil Cradling is a great book... With the publication of An Evil Cradling, Brian Keenan is not letting the world forget. This is a mighty achievement by a magnificent writer\\". The Observer called it \\"Scriptural in its resonances and its broad artistry, while being as gripping as an airport thriller\\" and John Simpson stated that it was \\"Unforgettable... a remarkable achievement\\" An Evil Cradling was adapted into a 2003 film, Blind Flight.

Bront√´ Country is a name given to an area of south Pennine hills west of Bradford in West Yorkshire, England. The name comes from the Bront√´ sisters, who wrote such literary classics as Jane Eyre (Charlotte Bront√´), Wuthering Heights (Emily Bront√´), and The Tenant of Wildfell Hall (Anne Bront√´) while living in the area. Geology The geology of the Bront√´ country is mainly gritstone. Points of interest The area includes the village of Haworth, where the Bront√´ sisters lived, and where the Bront√´ Parsonage Museum is located today. Top Withens is said to have been the inspiration for Wuthering Heights. Ponden Hall, which located about half a mile outside Stanbury, is believed to inspire at least two buildings in Bront√´s' novels: Thrushcross Grange in Wuthering Heights and the eponymous mansion in The Tenant of Wildfell Hall. Thornton, on the outskirts of Bradford, is the birthplace of the Bront√´ sisters and their brother Branwell (their father was rector of Thornton church). The house where they were born still exists as the Bront√´ Birthplace and is open to visitors by appointment. It is located on Market Street in the centre of the village Other places of interest from the Bront√´ sisters' novels include Oakwell Hall (Fieldhead in Shirley), Red House (Briarmains in Shirley), and Gawthorpe Hall and Wycoller Hall (Ferndean Manor in Jane Eyre). In media and culture The film Bront√´ Country: The Story of the Emily, Charlotte & Anne Bront√´ discusses the area's geography and history, and the history of the Bront√´ family.

Monto was roughly the area bounded by Talbot Street, Amiens Street, Gardiner Street and Se√°n McDermott Street (formerly Gloucester Street) in what would now be called Summerhill. The name is derived from Montgomery Street (now called Foley Street), which runs parallel to the lower end of Talbot Street towards what is now Connolly Station. Montgomery Street is believed to be named after Elizabeth Montgomery, who was married to Luke Gardiner, 1st Viscount Mountjoy. It was immortalised as \\"Nighttown\\" in the \\"Circe\\" chapter of James Joyce's famous work, Ulysses, where the central protagonists Leopold Bloom and Stephen Dedalus together visit a brothel. History In its heyday from the 1860s ‚Äì 1920s, there were anything up to 1,600 prostitutes working there at any one time, with all classes of customers catered for. It was reputed to be the biggest red light district in Europe at the time. Its financial viability was aided by the number of British Army barracks and hence soldiers in the city, notably the Royal Barracks (later Collins Barracks and now one of the locations of Ireland's National Museum). Monto was also a hive of IRA activity, particularly around the time of the war of independence, with several safe houses for the flying columns which included Phil Shanahan's public house. The then Prince of Wales, Prince Albert Edward (later King Edward VII), according to popular legend, lost his virginity there. In the 1880s the Prince, accompanied by his wife Alexandra and their son Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence strolled unrecognised through the area, having slipped away from their bodyguards and walked through Dublin. Between 1923 and 1925, religious missions led by Frank Duff of the Legion of Mary, a Roman Catholic organisation, and Fr. R.S. Devane worked to close down the brothels. They received the co-operation of Dublin Police Commissioner, General William W.R.E. Murphy, and the campaign ended with 120 arrests and the closure of the brothels following a police raid on 12 March 1925, its financial viability having already been seriously undermined by the withdrawal of soldiers from the city following the Anglo-Irish Treaty (December 1921) and the establishment of the Irish Free State (6 December 1922). In popular culture The Irish folk song, \\"Monto (Take Her Up to Monto)\\", was written by George Desmond Hodnett in 1958 and popularised by The Dubliners several years later. Irish singer R√≥is√≠n Murphy named her 2016 album Take Her Up to Monto in reference to the song. Monto is also twice mentioned in the Irish folk song \\"Waxies' Dargle\\". It is referred to repeatedly in the Pete St. John song \\"Johnny McGory\\" (also popularised by The Dubliners). Monto, Frank Duff, and the L.O.M. are also mentioned in the Peter Yeates song \\"Honor Bright\\", the story of the 1925 murder of a prostitute (Lizzie O'Neil) who used the pseudonym \\"Honour Bright\\". The song is sung at the top of Act Two of The Ferryman by Jez Butterworth as the Carney boys come in from the harvest. In 2019 Pierce Turner included a version on his collection of traditional songs, Vinegar Hill.

History In October 1999, the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) allocated 75 MHz of spectrum in the 5.9 GHz band to be used by intelligent transportation systems (ITS). In August 2008, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) allocated 30 MHz of spectrum in the 5.9 GHz band for ITS. By 2003, it was used in Europe and Japan in electronic toll collection. DSRC systems in Europe, Japan and the U.S. are not compatible and include some very significant variations (5.8 GHz, 5.9 GHz or even infrared, different baud rates, and different protocols). Singapore's Electronic Road Pricing scheme plans to use DSRC technology for road use measurement (ERP2) to replace its ERP1 overhead gantry method. In June, 2017, the Utah Department of Transportation successfully demonstrated a Transit DSRC system on SR-68 (Redwood Road) for eleven miles, from 400 South in Salt Lake City, to 8020 South in West Jordan City. This was in partnership with the Utah Transit Authority. Several UTA Transit buses were outfitted with the DSRC equipment to allow for signal cycle time extensions if the bus was running behind schedule. Other possible applications were: * Emergency warning system for vehicles * Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control * Cooperative Forward Collision Warning * Intersection collision avoidance * Approaching emergency vehicle warning (Blue Waves) * Vehicle safety inspection * Transit or emergency vehicle signal priority * Electronic parking payments * Commercial vehicle clearance and safety inspections * In-vehicle signing * Rollover warning * Probe data collection * Highway-rail intersection warning * Electronic toll collection Other short-range wireless protocols are IEEE 802.11, Bluetooth and CALM.

Dome C is located on the Antarctic Plateau, inland from the French research station at Dumont D'Urville, inland from the Australian Casey Station and inland from the Italian Zucchelli station at Terra Nova Bay. Russia's Vostok Station is away. Dome C is the site of the Concordia Research Station, jointly operated by France and Italy.  History  Recovery efforts on the C-130 crashed at Dome C In the 1970s, Dome C was the site of ice core drilling by field teams of several nations. It was called Dome Charlie (NATO Phonetic Alphabet code for the letter C) by the U.S. Naval Support Force, Antarctica, and its Squadron VXE-6, which provided logistical support to the field teams. In January and November 1975, three LC-130 Hercules aircraft suffered severe damage during attempted takeoffs from Dome Charlie. In November 1975 and November 1976, the U.S. Navy established field camps on Dome Charlie to recover the aircraft. Following major structural repairs and replacement of engines in the field, the three LC-130s were flown to McMurdo Station on December 26, 1975, January 14, 1976, and December 25 (Christmas Day), 1976. French party reopening the Dome Charlie camp before drilling From November 1977 to March 1978 a French party of 13 settled down in the existing camp left by the aircraft rescuers. They brought several tons of equipment‚Äîthanks to the VXE-6 airplanes‚Äîand achieved the planned ice-coring campaign down to 980 m bringing to surface, and later on in their labs for study, ice samples 45,000 to 50,000 years old. During the Antarctic summer of 1979, the camp was re-occupied by Americans and French, under the auspices of the US Antarctic Research Program, sponsored by the National Science Foundation. Deep ice core drilling, meteorology and seismic studies were conducted. The camp, with a maximum summer population of 18, was operated and maintained by four employees of ITT Antarctic Services and one US Navy medical corpsman. When the camp was shut down for the season in about January, 1980, it was left mostly intact, with a radio-isotope powered remote weather station operational. The 1996 summer camp established in a Rebusco container In 1992, France decided to build a new station on the Antarctic Plateau. The program was later joined by Italy. In 1996, a French-Italian team established a summer camp at Dome C. The two main objectives of the camp were the provision of logistical support for the European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica (EPICA) and the construction of a permanent research station. The new all-year facility, Concordia Station, became operational in 2005. The Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) considers \\"Dome Charlie\\" to be superior to the informal name, \\"Dome C,\\" and that it has precedence over \\"Dome Circe\\", a name suggested from Greek mythology after Circe, the bewitching queen of Aeaea island, one of the children of solar god Helios and the Oceanid nymph Perse, who changed men into animals by magic, by members of the SPRI airborne radio echo sounding team in 1982. Later, it was named \\"Dome Concordia\\" after that same French/Italian scientific base.  Environment  The high, flat, and cold environment of the Antarctic Plateau at Dome C Dome C is one of the coldest places on Earth. Temperatures hardly rise above in summer and can fall below in winter. The annual average air temperature is . Humidity is low and it is also very dry, with very little or no precipitation throughout the year. Dome C does not experience the katabatic winds typical of the coastal regions of Antarctica because of its elevated location and its relative distance from the edges of the Antarctic Plateau. Typical wind speed in winter is 2.8 m/s (6 mph). Dome C is situated on top of the Antarctic Polar Plateau, the world's largest frozen desert ever. No animals or plants live at a distance of more than a few hundred meters from the Southern Ocean. However, south polar skuas have been spotted overflying the station, away from their nearest food sources. It is believed that these seabirds have learned to cross the frozen white continent instead of circumnavigating it.  Astronomical observatory  The milky Way above the glaciology shelter, Dome C, winter 2005 Dome C is notable for its potential to be an extremely good astronomical observation site; the transparency of the Antarctic atmosphere allows stars to be observed, even when the Sun is at its highest possible elevation angle of 38¬∞. The good viewing is due to very low infrared sky emission, extremely low humidity, a high percentage of cloud-free time, low atmospheric aerosol and dust content, and freedom from light pollution and background light other than auroras and moonlight. This location was a serious candidate for the ESO's E-ELT project. However, sky coverage is less than at lower latitude locations as northern celestial hemisphere objects never rise or are too low above the horizon. Writing in the Proceedings of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific in 2005, Karim Agabi et al. discuss the suitability of the site for astronomy in terms of the seeing. They determined the median seeing (measured with a Differential Image Motion Monitor placed on top of an tower) to be 1.3¬±0.8 arcseconds. This is significantly worse than most major observatory sites, but similar to other observatories in Antarctica. However, they found (using balloons) that 87% of turbulence was below 36 meters. A telescope built on a tower could rise above this \\"boundary layer\\" and achieve excellent seeing. The boundary layer is at the South Pole and may be as low as at Dome A. In an earlier (2004) paper, Lawrence et al. considered the site and concluded that \\"Dome C is the best ground-based site to develop a new astronomical observatory\\". (FAQ by the authors ) This team measured superior seeing of 0.27 arcseconds, half as large as at Mauna Kea Observatory. This figure was taken with an instrument insensitive to near-ground turbulence and so it is comparable to the 0.35 arcseconds Agabi et al. measured for \\"free atmospheric seeing\\". The 2004 experiments to measure the astronomical conditions at the site were unattended, controlled by a computer system that had to supervise the generation of its own electricity using a jet-fuel powered Stirling engine. The computer, running Linux, communicated with the outside world using an Iridium phone.  ESA research  Since Concordia Station is a prime space mission analogue, the European Space Agency conducts biomedical research there in collaboration with the French (IPEV) and Italian (ENEA/PNRA) Antarctic programs. Living conditions upon Dome C simulate what Astronauts have to go through in long-duration spaceflights. To name a few of the common challenges that the Concordia crew and Astronauts have to face, they both live in isolation and confinement, in different atmospheric pressure conditions, with an abnormal day/night cycle plus several effects on their everyday life, such as sleep difficulties. Obviously the above parameters influence not only physiology but also psychology. The European Space Agency (ESA) hires a Medical Doctor each year to winterover at Concordia Station and facilitate biomedical experiments on the crew. These experiments are selected over a variety of tests proposed to ESA by European universities and participation from the rest of the crew is voluntary (and highly appreciated). It is important to mention that this research aims not only at improving living conditions for Astronauts in a future human journey to Mars, but the results are also applied directly on society - they help doctors devise therapies for patients suffering from similar difficulties in Europe and elsewhere.

As a director, he often collaborated with the cinematographer John Alton. He directed films for a variety of production companies, from RKO to MGM, and worked with many major stars of the era. He made several Westerns with James Stewart, such as Winchester '73 (1950), and he was the director of the medieval epic El Cid (1961), working with Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren. He also directed the big-budget film Cimarron (1960), which starred Glenn Ford and Maria Schell. Early life Mann was born Emil Anton Bundsmann in San Diego, California.http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2013/12/18/man1-d18.html His father, Emile Theodore Bundsmann, an academic, was born in the village of Rosice, Chrudim, Bohemia to a Sudeten-German Catholic family. His mother, Bertha Weichselbaum, a drama teacher, was an American of Bavarian Jewish descent. Shortly after their marriage, Mann's parents joined the Theosophical Society community of Lomaland in San Diego County where there was an emphasis on artistic, religious, and military training and where children were raised separately from their parents. When Mann was three, his parents returned to his father's native Austria to seek treatment for Professor Bundsmann's ill health, leaving Mann behind in Lomaland. Mann's mother did not return for Mann until he was fourteen, and only then at the urging of a cousin who had paid him a visit and was worried about his treatment and situation at Lomaland. With his father permanently institutionalized, Mann and his mother struggled financially in Newark, New Jersey, with Mann maintaining many odd jobs throughout the remainder of his middle and high school years. Mann appeared in some high school productions with his friend and classmate, future Hollywood studio executive Dore Schary. Schary would graduate from Newark's Central High School, but Mann dropped out in his senior year.Alvarez, Max. The Crime Films of Anthony Mann, p. 15. University Press of Mississippi, 2013. . Accessed December 19, 2017. \\"In New Jersey, Emile Anton attended elementary school in East Orange and high school in Newark but dropped out to go to work. The New York Times obituary reports him leaving high school at age sixteen, but the Central High School transcripts indicate a January 1925 dropout date, when Emile Anton was eighteen.\\" Theatre, TV, and early film work Mann moved to New York and took a night job that enabled him to look for stage work during the day. He used the name \\"Anton Bundsmann\\". He appeared as an actor in The Blue Peter (1925), The Little Clay Cart (1926), and Uncle Vanya (1929). In 1930 he began directing as well, but he continued to act, appearing in The Streets of New York, or Poverty is No Crime (1931), and The Bride the Sun Shines On (1933). He directed Thunder on the Left (1933). He worked for various stock companies, and in 1934 set up his own which later became Long Island's Red Barn Playhouse. He later directed So Proudly We Hail (1936). During these years he met and married his first wife Mildred when they both worked at Macy's department store in New York City. Contrary to misleading newspaper reports, Mildred was a clerk and not a store executive or manager. They would have two children and divorce in 1956. Mann's second wife was Spanish actress Sara Montiel, from 1957-'63. In 1937, Mann accepted an offer to work for Selznick International Pictures as a talent scout, casting director and screen test director. Among the films he worked on were The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1938), Intermezzo (1939) and Rebecca (1940). He stayed in New York and continued to direct plays such as Haiti for the Federal Theatre, The Big Blow (1938). and The Hard Way (1940). Mann did notable, but mostly lost, work as a director for NBC's experimental television station W2XBS in 1939-'40. This included condensations of the hit Western play The Missouri Legend and the melodrama The Streets of New York. A five-minute silent clip of the latter show survives in the Museum of Television and Radio, including noted actors Norman Lloyd and George Coulouris.Alvarez, Max. The Crime Films of Anthony Mann. Jackson, Mississippi: University Press of Mississippi, 2014. pp. 24-30. Mann did not return to television in its commercial years. Mann became an assistant director by the 1940s, assisting Preston Sturges on the film Sullivan's Travels (1941),Spoto, Donald. Madcap: The Life of Preston Sturges. p. 171. and subsequently directing low-budget assignments for RKO and Republic Pictures. Early films as director Mann made his directorial debut with Dr. Broadway (1942) at Paramount. He followed it with Moonlight in Havana (1943) at Universal. In 1944 it was reported he might return to Broadway to direct Mirror for Children. Mann went to Republic where he made Nobody's Darling (1944), My Best Gal (1944), Strangers in the Night (1944), and The Great Flamarion (1945). Mann moved to RKO to direct Two O'Clock Courage (1945) and Sing Your Way Home (1945) then back to Republic for Strange Impersonation (1946). He did The Bamboo Blonde (1946) at RKO. Mann's career took a leap when he made T-Men (1947) for Eagle-Lion Films. It was a critical and commercial success. He followed it with Railroaded! (1947). He went back to RKO for Desperate (1947) then had some other big successes at Eagle-Lion with Raw Deal (1948) and He Walked by Night (1948), although his directorial contribution to the latter was uncredited. Dore Schary, then head of production at MGM, hired Mann to make Border Incident (1949). He did Reign of Terror (1949) for Eagle-Lion, and did some uncredited work on Follow Me Quietly (1949) at RKO. \\"A\\"-film director Anthony Mann and Janet Leigh Mann's first \\"A\\" film was the Western The Furies (1950) at Paramount starring Barbara Stanwyck and Walter Huston. He followed this with a Western at Universal, starring James Stewart, Winchester '73 (1950). The picture was a huge success and completely reinvigorated Stewart's faltering postwar career. MGM hired Mann to direct Side Street (1950). He stayed at that studio to do a popular Western with Robert Taylor, Devil's Doorway (1950) and a thriller with Dick Powell, The Tall Target (1952). Mann was reunited with Stewart for another Western at Universal, Bend of the River (1952). The actor and director made a contemporary adventure film, Thunder Bay (1953) at Universal and a Western, The Naked Spur (1953) at MGM. Mann and Stewart had their biggest success to-date with The Glenn Miller Story (1954). Also well received was their \\"Northern\\", The Far Country (1954) with Walter Brennan. Mann went to Columbia to make a Western without Stewart, The Last Frontier (1955), with Victor Mature. Star and director were reunited on The Man from Laramie (1955) at Columbia. Then Stewart and Mann were meant to make Night Passage (1957) together, but had a disagreement and another director took over; they never collaborated again. Mann directed a musical starring Mario Lanza, Serenade (1956). Here he met and worked with actress Sara Montiel, who would become his second wife. He made a western with Henry Fonda, The Tin Star (1957) then teamed with Philip Yordan to make two movies starring Robert Ryan and Aldo Ray, Men in War (1957), about the Korean War, and God's Little Acre (1958). In between, he directed Gary Cooper in a Western, Man of the West (1958). Mann went to MGM to direct Glenn Ford in an expensive remake of Cimarron (1960), which failed to recoup its cost at the box office. He was also the original director of Spartacus (1960), but was fired early in production by producer- star Kirk Douglas and replaced with Stanley Kubrick, having shot a handful of scenes. Europe Mann received an offer from producer Samuel Bronston to do a medieval epic written by Yordan, El Cid (1961). It was a notable success. However a follow up epic for the same collaborators, The Fall of the Roman Empire (1964), was a huge flop and contributed to the demise of Bronston's empire. In 1964, he was head of the jury at the 14th Berlin International Film Festival. He then made a British war film starring Douglas and Richard Harris, The Heroes of Telemark (1965). In 1967, Mann died from a heart attack in Berlin while filming the spy thriller A Dandy in Aspic. The film was completed by the film's star Laurence Harvey.Staff. \\"Anthony Mann, 60, A Movie Director; Filmmaker Who Favored Westerns Dies in Berlin\\", The New York Times, April 30, 1967.

It was a clear victory for Venice over the Ottoman Empire during the Cretan War. The Venetians, under Lazzaro Mocenigo, continued their strategy of blockading the Dardanelles, to prevent the Ottomans from resupplying their forces in the Aegean Sea. The orders were the same as for the previous year - remain at anchor until the Ottoman fleet passed, then attack the rear - and this time the plan worked. The previous Kapudan Pasha (Grand Admiral), Kara Murat, had been promoted to Grand Vizier and his replacement, Kara Mustapha, had 36 sailing ships, 8 galleasses and 60 galleys, as well as perhaps several galleys from outside the Dardanelles. Once again, the Ottomans were arranged in 3 lines abreast: Sailing ships, then galleasses, then galleys. The Venetians had 26 sailing ships, 4 galleasses and 6 galleys. As the Ottomans advanced, one galleass was sunk and one galley burnt and the rowing vessels retreated, after which the Venetians attacked the Ottoman sailing ships, resulting in 9 being burnt and 2 wrecked. The only Venetian loss was David Golia, which was burnt. Venetian casualties exclusive of the sunken ship were 126 killed and 180 wounded. 358 Ottomans were taken prisoner.

He previously pitched for the Kansas City Royals, Milwaukee Brewers, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Los Angeles Dodgers, and Arizona Diamondbacks. The Royals selected Greinke in the first round of the 2002 MLB draft, after he won the Gatorade National Player of the Year Award as a high school senior. After playing in the minor leagues, he made his MLB debut in 2004. His career was nearly derailed by his battles with depression and anxiety in 2005 and 2006, and he missed most of the 2006 season. He returned in 2007 as a relief pitcher, before rejoining the starting rotation in 2008 and developing into one of the top pitchers in the game. In 2009, he appeared in the MLB All-Star Game, led the major leagues in earned run average, and won the American League Cy Young Award. He is a six-time All-Star, and six-time Gold Glove Award winner.  Early life and high school  Greinke was born in Orlando, Florida, the son of teachers Donald and Marsha Greinke. He is of German descent, and was active in Little League and also excelled in tennis and golf tournaments as a youth. As a teenager, Greinke helped lead his team to the Senior League World Series title in 1999. He played shortstop for the team, and his coach estimated that he hit close to .700 in the tournament. Greinke was primarily a shortstop when he started playing baseball at Apopka High School. He hit over .400 with 31 home runs in his high school career. He worked as a relief pitcher as a sophomore and junior, before becoming a starting pitcher as a senior. During his senior season, in 2002, Greinke compiled a 9‚Äì2 win-loss record, a 0.55 earned run average (ERA), and 118 strikeouts in 63 innings. He also held opposing batters to a .107 average. He led his team to a 32‚Äì2 record and their third straight district title, and was selected as Gatorade National Player of the Year. After the high school season ended, he played in the Florida Athletic Coaches Association All-Star Classic and impressed pro scouts with his performance against some of the best hitters in the country. Greinke was selected in the first round of the 2002 Major League Baseball draft by the Kansas City Royals, who felt he was a polished player who could move quickly through their system. Greinke turned down a scholarship offer from Clemson University to sign with the Royals for a $2.5 million signing bonus.  Professional career  = Minor leagues = Greinke pitched in six minor league games for the Royals farm teams in 2002: three games for the Gulf Coast Royals, two for the Low-A Spokane Indians, and two innings for the High-A Wilmington Blue Rocks of the Carolina League. He had a 3.97 ERA in 11 innings. In 2003, Greinke opened the season with Wilmington, where he was 11‚Äì1 with a 1.14 ERA in 14 starts. Those numbers earned spots on the Carolina League mid- season and post-season all-star teams as well as Carolina League Pitcher of the Year award. The Blue Rocks' manager, Billy Gardner, Jr., remarked that Greinke was \\"the best pitcher I've ever seen at this level of the minor leagues.\\" He was promoted in July to the AA Wichita Wranglers of the Texas League, where in nine starts he was 4‚Äì3 with a 3.23 ERA. He had a couple of games where he struggled at Wichita and gave up a lot of runs. However, he bounced back and helped them make the playoffs with a victory in the final game of the season. Greinke was named the organization's Minor League Pitcher of the Year for 2003. He was promoted by the Royals in 2004 to the Omaha Royals of the Pacific Coast League, where he was 1‚Äì1 with a 2.51 ERA in six starts. = Kansas City Royals = Greinke was called up to the major leagues on May 22, 2004, and made his major league debut against the Oakland Athletics, allowing two runs in five innings. At 20 years old he was the youngest player in the majors and came close to picking up the win, but the team's closer, Jeremy Affeldt, gave up the lead with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning. Greinke recorded his first career win on June 8, when he pitched seven scoreless innings against the Montreal Expos. In 24 starts, Greinke finished the 2004 year with an 8‚Äì11 record and a 3.97 ERA. His first major league hit was a home run off Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher Russ Ortiz in a 12‚Äì11 loss on June 10, 2005; however, he also allowed 15 hits in that game, which tied a club record. In 2005, Greinke led the American League in losses, finishing with a 5‚Äì17 record and a 5.80 ERA in 33 starts. Kansas City Royals in 2009 Greinke was sometimes quiet and awkward in the clubhouse. To alleviate some of his anxiety and solitude, the Royals made arrangements for him to live with Royals Hall of Fame third baseman George Brett. Still, Greinke's uneasiness grew. By the 2005‚Äì2006 off-season, he nearly quit baseball. Greinke later remarked that, at the time, he did not expect to return to baseball. He left spring training for personal reasons in late February 2006. It was later revealed that he was diagnosed with depression and a social anxiety disorder. He reported back to the Royals' spring training facility in Surprise, Arizona, on April 17, where he underwent ongoing pitching sessions. He was placed on the 60-day disabled list due to psychological issues and took time away from baseball entirely. He began seeing a sports psychologist and taking anti-depressant medication. Greinke only made three appearances out of the bullpen in 2006, and finished the year 1‚Äì0 with a 4.26 ERA. In 2007, Greinke returned to the Royals rotation at the start of the season, but was assigned to the bullpen in early May. In 52 appearances (14 starts), Greinke finished 2007 with a 7‚Äì7 record and a 3.69 ERA. Greinke returned to the rotation in 2008 and performed well that season. He made 32 starts in 2008 and finished with a 13‚Äì10 record along with 183 strikeouts. His 3.47 ERA was the best by a full-time Royals starter in 11 years. On January 26, 2009, he agreed to a four-year contract with the Royals worth $38 million. After ending the 2008 season with 15 scoreless innings, Greinke started off 2009 by not allowing a run in his first 24 innings, which meant that for 39 innings in a row, he had not given up a run. Greinke was named American League (AL) Pitcher of the Month for April, his five wins, 0.50 ERA and 44 strikeouts all tops in the Majors. On August 25, Greinke struck out 15 batters, breaking Mark Gubicza's team record for strikeouts in a single game. On August 30, Greinke had a one-hit complete game against the Seattle Mariners. Greinke's record for the 2009 season was 16‚Äì8, and he posted an ERA of 2.16, the lowest in MLB. On October 21, he was named American League Pitcher of the Year by Sporting News. On October 28, Greinke was awarded the MLBPA Players Choice AL Pitcher of the Year. On November 17, 2009, he won the AL Cy Young Award. Greinke credited some of his performance to his use of \\"modern pitching metrics\\" ‚Äî statistics on team defense and defense independent pitching statistics ‚Äî to calibrate his own approach to pitching. Greinke specifically mentioned FIP (fielding independent pitching), an indicator developed by sabermetrician Tom Tango, as his favorite statistic. \\"That's pretty much how I pitch, to try to keep my FIP as low as possible. Despite a stellar 2009 season, his performance in 2010 began to regress as he finished the year 10‚Äì14 with a 4.17 ERA and 181 strikeouts. = Milwaukee Brewers = On December 17, 2010, Greinke reportedly asked the Royals to trade him, claiming that he was not motivated to play for a rebuilding team. The Royals were unlikely to afford signing Greinke to a long-term deal once he became a free agent, so they agreed to trade him for some quality prospects. On December 19, he was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers with Yuniesky Betancourt and $2 million for Alcides Escobar, Lorenzo Cain, Jeremy Jeffress, and Jake Odorizzi. He was given the number 13, instead of his preferred number 23, due to number 23 already being issued to Rickie Weeks. Greinke would later admit that he handled the trade request poorly, saying that he was \\"pretty rude\\" on the way out, but the deal worked out well for both teams. In February 2011, before reporting to his first spring training with the Brewers, Greinke suffered a fractured rib while playing basketball. He started the 2011 season on the disabled list. Milwaukee Brewers in 2011 spring training Greinke made his Brewers debut in the second game of a doubleheader on May 4, 2011. Despite missing the first month of the season because of his injury, Greinke finished second on the team in wins with a 16‚Äì6 record. He also had a 3.83 ERA, and 201 strikeouts (seventh in the National League (NL)) in 171 innings pitched while surrendering 45 walks. Greinke became only the fifth Brewer pitcher to strike out 200+ batters in a season. He was fourth in the NL in won-lost percentage (.727) and sixth in wins. He went a perfect 11‚Äì0 in his starts at Miller Park, the Brewers' home stadium. Overall, Grienke finished the 2011 year with a 16-6 record, a 3.83 ERA, and 201 strikeouts in 28 starts. On April 7, 2012, the Brewers defeated the Cardinals 6‚Äì0 in Greinke's first start of the season after he pitched seven scoreless innings while giving up four hits and striking out seven. In an oddity, Greinke became the first pitcher to start three straight games in the Majors in 95 years. On July 7, he was ejected from the game after just four pitches for angrily throwing the ball into the ground following a close play at first base. The following day, Greinke started again, but lasted only until the third inning. The All-Star break followed, and Greinke was the Brewers' starter on July 13, the team's next game. Greinke's third start ended after five innings. Before this, the most recent pitcher to start three consecutive games was Red Faber in 1917, who started both games of a September 3 doubleheader, throwing just six innings in total, followed by a complete game win the following day. To begin 2012, Grienke made 21 starts with the Brewers and had a 9-3 record, 120 strikeouts, and a 3.44 ERA. = Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim = Despite his success with the Brewers, the team was struggling and not likely to make a playoff run. When talks on a contract extension broke down, the team traded Greinke to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim on July 27 in exchange for top infield prospect Jean Segura and pitchers Ariel Pe√±a and Johnny Hellweg. Brewers General Manager Doug Melvin remarked that it was one of the tougher decisions he had to make because he was very fond of Greinke. Greinke made his first start for the Angels on July 29. After a stretch of four unproductive starts from August 3‚Äì19 (1‚Äì1, 7.20 ERA in 25 innings), Greinke followed up with four consecutive starts of at least seven innings and two or fewer runs ‚Äî all of them wins. In those starts, he produced a 1.88 ERA in 28 innings. Greinke became the first pitcher since 1920 to record 13 strikeouts in five innings or less in a game against the Seattle Mariners on September 25. He then combined with four other Angels pitchers to tie an American League record by striking out 20 batters in a nine-inning game. He finished his time with the Angels with a 6‚Äì2 record and a 3.53 ERA in 13 starts. Overall in 2012, combined with both teams, Grienke made 34 starts with a 15-5 record, 200 strikeouts, and a 3.48 ERA. = Los Angeles Dodgers = Greinke agreed to a six-year free agent contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers worth $147 million, on December 8, 2012. The deal, which was finalized on December 10, was the largest ever for a right-handed pitcher at the time it was signed. It was surpassed a year later by F√©lix Hern√°ndez's seven-year, $175 million contract extension with the Seattle Mariners. Greinke later claimed that he chose the Dodgers over the Texas Rangers, who also were pursuing him, primarily because they offered more money. On April 11, 2013, Greinke fractured his left collarbone in a brawl with Carlos Quentin of the San Diego Padres after Quentin was hit by an inside pitch and charged the mound. He was placed on the disabled list and it was revealed that he would require surgery, which was performed on April 13. It was estimated that he would miss eight weeks of the season. However, he returned to action on May 10 when he pitched in a rehab game for the Class-A Rancho Cucamonga Quakes. He returned to the Dodgers on May 15. On June 11, 2013, Greinke was hit in the head and neck area by Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher Ian Kennedy, leading to a bench-clearing brawl. Because Greinke did not participate in the brawl, he was unaffected. Greinke picked up his 100th career win on August 5, 2013, against the St. Louis Cardinals. He was 5‚Äì0 with a 1.23 ERA during the month of August and was selected as National League Pitcher of the Month. Greinke finished his first season with the Dodgers with a 15‚Äì4 record and 2.63 ERA in 28 starts. He also batted .328, the highest batting average for a Dodgers pitcher since Orel Hershiser in the 1993 season. He was awarded with the Silver Slugger Award as the best hitting pitcher in the National League. Greinke began the 2014 season by setting an MLB record with 22 straight starts (dating back to July 2013) where he allowed two or fewer earned runs. He was selected to the National League squad at the 2014 Major League Baseball All-Star Game and finished the season with a 17‚Äì8 record and a 2.71 ERA in 32 starts, the highest win total in his career. He won the Gold Glove Award as the best fielding pitcher in the National League. Los Angeles Dodgers in 2015 When Justin Upton of the San Diego Padres homered against Greinke in the eighth inning on June 13, 2015, it was the last run he surrendered until the All-Star break. Greinke was then selected to the All-Star Game, his second straight appearance, and chosen to be the starting pitcher for the National League squad. At that point in the season, Greinke carried a major league-leading 1.48 ERA with a 7‚Äì2 record and consecutive scoreless innings. After Greinke retired 28 consecutive batters over a span of two starts, Nationals outfielder Michael Taylor ended the streak in the third inning on July 19. His scoreless inning streak lasted until a July 26 start against the New York Mets at Citi Field. He shared the NL Player of the Week honors with his teammate Clayton Kershaw for July 13‚Äì19. Greinke finished the 2015 season with a 19‚Äì3 record, 200 strikeouts, and a major-league-best 1.66 ERA. His ERA was the second-lowest in Dodgers history behind Rube Marquard in 1916, and his ERA+ (225) and major-league-leading WHIP (0.844) were the best in franchise history. He led all major league pitchers in left on base percentage, stranding 86.5% of base runners. Greinke pitched in two games in the 2015 National League Division Series against the New York Mets. He allowed five runs in 13 innings and took the loss in the deciding fifth game in the series. At the conclusion of the series, it was announced that he would opt out of the last three years of his contract with the Dodgers and become a free agent. He officially opted out on November 3. After the season, Greinke was selected as the Outstanding National League Pitcher at the Players Choice Awards, and won his second Gold Glove Award. Greinke finished second in the NL Cy Young Award voting to Jake Arrieta. = Arizona Diamondbacks = On December 8, 2015, Greinke signed a six-year, $206.5 million contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks. Greinke started on Opening Day 2016 at Chase Field against the Colorado Rockies; he gave up seven runs in four innings, including two home runs to rookie shortstop Trevor Story, who was making his MLB debut. The Diamondbacks lost the game 10‚Äì5. In his second start, on April 9, Greinke matched up against Kyle Hendricks and the Chicago Cubs. He allowed three runs in the first inning, and struggled through the rest of his outing. The Diamondbacks lost the game 4‚Äì2. Greinke got his first win as a Diamondback on April 19, 2016 against the San Francisco Giants, allowing just one run in over six innings of work. On July 3, 2016, Greinke was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to a left oblique strain. On August 24, 2016, he recorded his 2000th career strikeout in the Diamondbacks' 10‚Äì9 win over Atlanta Braves. Greinke finished his first year 13-7, but with a 4.37 ERA in 158‚Öî innings. In 2017, Greinke was selected to the NL All-Star team, his fourth All-Star selection. At the time of his selection he was 10-4 with a 3.05 ERA in innings, 128 strikeouts (10.21 strikeouts per nine innings), WHIP of 1.02 and a .219 opponents batting average. On September 16 versus the San Francisco Giants at AT&T; Park, he completed eight shutout innings with two hits allowed and eight strikeouts as Arizona won, 2‚àí0. His game score of 90 was the second-best of his career, and he also hit two doubles at the plate. In 32 starts in 2017, Greinke finished with a 17‚Äì7 record, 215 strikeouts, and a 3.20 ERA in innings. The Diamondbacks finished with a 93‚Äì69 record and clinched a Wild Card spot, but lost to the Dodgers in the Division Series. Greinke won his fourth consecutive Rawlings Gold Glove Award after the 2017 season. He also finished fourth in the Cy Young voting behind Max Scherzer, Clayton Kershaw and Stephen Strasburg. Greinke was once again named an All- Star in 2018. He finished the season with a 15-11 record and a 3.21 ERA in 33 starts. Following the season, he won his fifth consecutive Gold Glove Award. On April 2, 2019, Greinke hit two home runs and struck out 10 as the Diamondbacks won 8-5 against the Padres. In 2019 with Arizona before he was traded, he was 10-4 with a 2.90 ERA. Greinke batted .271 with three home runs and eight RBIs with the Diamondbacks in 2019, earning him his second career Silver Slugger Award. = Houston Astros = On July 31, 2019, the Diamondbacks traded Greinke to the Houston Astros with cash considerations in exchange for four minor league prospects: Corbin Martin, J. B. Bukauskas, Seth Beer, and Joshua Rojas. The Diamondbacks also agreed to pay $24 million of Greinke's remaining $77 million salary. In 2019 with the Astros he was 8-1 with a 3.02 ERA. Between the two teams, in 2019 he was 18-5 with a 2.93 ERA, as in 208.2 innings (sixth in the majors) over 33 starts he walked only 30 batters (1.3 walks per nine innings, the best ratio of his career and third- best in the major leagues), and had a WHIP of 0.982 (fifth-best in the major leagues). At the plate, he batted .280/.308/.580 with three home runs and eight RBIs in 50 at bats. Greinke started Games 3 and 7 of the 2019 World Series for Houston. Greinke allowed two runs on two hits in 6 innings in his Game 7 start, He was pulled by manager A.J. Hinch in the seventh inning after surrendering a one-out home run to Anthony Rendon, followed by a walk to Juan Soto, with the Astros leading 2-1. He was replaced by Will Harris, who allowed a 2-run home run to Howie Kendrick. The Astros ultimately lost the game 6-2, prompting questions afterward by members of the media about Hinch's decision to pull Greinke. In 2020 he was 3-3 with a 4.03 ERA in 12 starts spanning 67 innings, and was second in the AL in walks per nine innings (1.209) and fourth in home runs per nine innings (0.806).  Pitching style  Greinke throws six different pitches: * Four-seam fastball ‚Äî * Two-seam fastball ‚Äî * Cutter ‚Äî * Slider ‚Äî * Curveball ‚Äî * Changeup ‚Äî His curveball has two speeds with different types of movement, and he will sometimes throw a curve that is more in the middle range combining the types of movement. His two-seamer is his most-used pitch against right-handed hitters and is used more frequently than against lefties, as is his slider. His changeup is only thrown to left-handed hitters. Greinke's curveball is typically used early in the count, while his slider is his most common 2-strike pitch. Greinke's slider has been one of his more effective pitches. Hitters have only a .154 batting average and .230 slugging percentage against the pitch. It has produced 51% of his strikeouts. Its whiff rate is 42%, and more than half the pitches put in play are ground balls. However, he limits the use of the slider in order to not put excessive strain on his arm. Greinke has produced good strikeout-to-walk ratios throughout his career, finishing in his league's top 10 five times and ranking eighth among active pitchers in the category, at 3.76:1 as of the end of the 2017 regular season. Greinke has been described as a \\"scientist as a pitcher\\" and is known for preparing for each start more extensively than most. Due to his more upright overhand pitching style, with a pause where the ball is hidden down next to his right knee before release, a forward-facing followthrough, and late movement that reaches the lower third of the strike zone, he is in much better position for fielding soft, short hits coming at him, which helped him gain many assists and 6 consecutive NL Gold Glove awards as a pitcher. He was still awarded NL Gold Glove in 2019 because he started the 2019 season in Arizona before being traded. Greinke with his son at the 2018 Major League Baseball Home Run Derby  Batting  Greinke is a good hitting pitcher, having won two Silver Slugger awards in his career. He has also amassed nine stolen bases over his career.  Personal life  Greinke is married to Em Kuchar, whom he met while attending Apopka High School. Kuchar is a former Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader and was Miss Daytona Beach USA 2008. Their sons were born in 2015 and 2017, respectively. His younger brother, Luke, was also a pitcher. Luke played college baseball at Auburn University and was drafted by the New York Yankees in the 12th round of the 2008 MLB draft, but was out of baseball a year later because of injuries.

Historically it was a body of priests and singers that travelled with the monarch. The term is now also applied to the chapels within royal palaces, most notably at Hampton Court and St James's Palace, and other chapels within the Commonwealth designated as such by the monarch. Within the Church of England, some of these royal chapels may also be referred to as Royal Peculiars, an ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the monarch. The Chapel Royal's role is to perform choral liturgical service. It has played a significant role in the musical life of the nation, with composers such as Tallis, Byrd and Purcell all having been members of the choir. The choir consists of Gentlemen of the Chapel Royal singing the lower parts alongside the boy choristers known as the Children of the Chapel. History =Middle Ages= In its early history, the English chapel royal travelled, like the rest of the court, with the monarch and performed its functions wherever he or she was residing at the time. The earliest written record of the chapel dates from c.1135, in the reign of Henry I. Specified in this document of household regulations are two gentlemen and four servants, although there may have been other people within the chapel at that time. An ordinance from the reign of Henry VI sets out the full membership of the chapel as of 1455: one Dean, 20 Chaplains and Clerks, seven Children, one Chaplain Confessor for the Household, and one Yeoman. However, in the same year the clerks petitioned the King asking that their number be increased to 24 singing men due to \\"the grete labour that thei have daily in your chapell\\". From the reign of Edward IV further details survive. There were 26 chaplains and clerks, who were to be \\"cleare voysid\\" in their singing and \\"suffisaunt in Organes playing\\". The children were supervised by a Master of Song, chosen by the dean from among the Gentlemen of the Chapel Royal. They were allocated supplies of meat and ale, and their own servant. There were also two Yeoman of the Chapel who acted as epistlers, reading from the bible during services. These were appointed from Children of the Chapel whose voices had recently broken. =Tudor period= The chapel remained stable throughout the reign of Henry VIII and the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The number of singers did vary during this period however, without apparent reason, from between twenty to thirty gentlemen and eight to ten children. The chapel travelled with the King to the Field of the Cloth of Gold, and on the second invasion of France. Drama In the Tudor period, the chapel increasingly took on another, unofficial, function that grew in importance into the 17th century ‚Äì performing in dramas. Both the gentlemen and the children would act in pageants and plays for the royal family, held in court on feast days such as Christmas. For example at Christmas 1514, the play \\"The Triumph of Love and Beauty\\" was written and presented by William Cornysh, then Master of the Children, and was performed to the King by members of the chapel, including the children. The chapel achieved its greatest eminence during the reign of Elizabeth I, when William Byrd and Thomas Tallis were joint organists. The Master of the Children of the Chapel Royal had, until at least 1684, the power to impress promising boy trebles from provincial choirs for service in the chapel. The theatre company affiliated with the chapel, known as the Children of the Chapel Royal, produced plays at court and then commercially until the 1620s by playwrights including John Lyly, Ben Jonson and George Chapman. =17th century= In the 17th century the Chapel Royal had its own building in Whitehall, which burned down in 1698; since 1702 it has been based at St James's Palace. The English Chapel Royal became increasingly associated with Westminster Abbey, so that by 1625 over half of the Gentlemen of the English Chapel Royal were also members of the Westminster Abbey choir. In the 18th century the choristers sang the soprano parts in performances of Handel's oratorios and other works. Under Charles II, the choir was often augmented by violinists from the royal consort; at various times the chapel has also employed composers, lutenists and viol players. Richard Buckner. Victoria and Albert Museum, London. Functions and functionaries The Chapel Royal is a department of the Ecclesiastical Household, which was established in 1483, under Edward IV, as the Royal Free Chapel of the Household.Charles Edward McGuire & Steven E. Plank, Historical Dictionary of English Music: ca. 1400-1958, pp, 78-79. The Chapel Royal is a grouping of clerics and musicians, rather than a physical building. Traditionally, the members of the Chapel Royal are divided into clerics, choristers, and gentlemen of the chapel. The Chapel Royal is a royal peculiar (a church institute outside the usual diocesan structure of the Church); it is one of the three major royal peculiars, the others being Westminster Abbey and the St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle (which includes the Royal Chapel of All Saints).Constitutional Reform: Reforming the Office of the Lord Chancellor (Department of Constitutional Affairs, 2003), p. 32. The members of the ecclesiastical household in Scotland are supplied by the Church of Scotland, while the members of ecclesiastical household in England are supplied by the Church of England.Stuart D.B. Picken, Historical Dictionary of Calvinism (Scarecrow Press), p. 62. Since the 18th century, the dean of the Chapel Royal in England has been the sitting Bishop of London, with control of music vested in the sub-dean (currently Paul Wright). The Chapel Royal conducts the Service of Remembrance at the Cenotaph in Whitehall and combines with the choir of the host abbey or cathedral at the Royal Maundy service. Locations The chapel's main locations have varied over the years. For example in the early Tudor period and in Elizabeth I's reign, the chapel's activity was often centered around the Greenwich Palace and the Palace of Whitehall. George, Duke of York and Mary of Teck at the Chapel Royal in St. James's Palace, 1894 Under Elizabeth II the chapel's primary location is at St James's Palace. =United Kingdom= St James's Palace The chapel at St James's has been used regularly since 1702 and is the most commonly used facility today. Located in the main block of St James's Palace, it was built c. 1540 and altered since, most notably by Sir Robert Smirke in 1837. The large window to the right of the palace gatehouse is in the north wall of this chapel which is laid out on a north-south rather than the usual east-west axis. Its ceiling richly decorated with royal initials and coats of arms is said to have been painted by Holbein. The separate Queen's Chapel, once also physically connected to the main building of St James's Palace, was built between 1623 and 1625 as a Roman Catholic chapel, at a time when the construction of Popish churches was otherwise prohibited in England, for Queen Henrietta Maria, wife of Charles I. From the 1690s it was used by Continental Lutheran courtiers and became known as the German chapel. The adjacent apartments burnt down in 1809 they were not replaced, and in 1856‚Äì57 Marlborough Road was laid out between the palace and the Queen's Chapel. Windsor At Windsor Castle is the largest Royal Peculiar, St George's Chapel, but it is governed by its own college, separate from St James's, Chapel Royal. Near the royal apartments, there is also the smaller Private Chapel. In the grounds of Windsor's Royal Lodge is the Royal Chapel of All Saints. Scotland In the 15th century it is believed that the Chapel Royal referred to a prebend in the church of St Mary on the Rock, St Andrews. In 1501 James IV founded a new Chapel Royal in Stirling Castle, but from 1504 onwards the deanery of the Chapel Royal was held by successive Bishops of Galloway with the title of Bishop of the Chapel Royal and authority over all the royal palaces within Scotland. The deanery was annexed to the bishopric of Dunblane in 1621, and the Chapel Royal was moved to Holyrood. In 1688, following the Glorious Revolution, a mob in Edinburgh broke into the abbey, entered the Chapel Royal and desecrated the royal tombs. From then on the building fell into decay, and became a roofless ruin. The restoration of the abbey has been proposed several times since the 18th century ‚Äì in 1835 by the architect James Gillespie Graham as a meeting place for the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, and in 1906 as a chapel for the Knights of the Thistle ‚Äì but both proposals were rejected. Other chapels royal Entrance to the Chapel Royal at Hampton Court Palace At the daughter Chapel Royal at Hampton Court Palace, a permanent chorus was created in 1868. The chorus, which sings on Sundays and major feast days, consists of fourteen boy members and six gentlemen members.Lewis Foreman & Susan Foreman, London: A Musical Gazetteer (Yale University Press, 2005), p. 80. An organ was built in 1712 and most recently restored in 2013.http://www.harrisonorgans.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Hampton-Court- Palace.pdf Two patronised chapels royal almost never attended by the monarch are the chapels of St John the Evangelist and St Peter ad Vincula in the Tower of London, having their own chaplains and choirs. In 2012, Roger Hall, the chaplain of the Tower of London, was made canon of the chapel royal at the Tower of London, the first such appointment since the 16th century. Chapels with a royal original purpose, but presently without royal patronage, include the Royal Chapel of St Katherine-upon-the-Hoe in the Royal Citadel in Plymouth. However, in 1927, King George V re-granted the title Royal Chapel to the garrison church. Several other locations have also formerly hosted the chapel royal, including the former chapel royal in Brighton. This was used by visiting royalty and as the primary chapel of ease to St Peter's Church in Brighton. The chapel was formally separated from St. Peter's parish in 2010, and became a parish in its own right. Another former chapel royal was situated in Dublin prior to the independence of Ireland in the 1920s. The Chapel Royal in Dublin operated within Dublin Castle, which served as the official seat for the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. =Canada= Christ Church Royal Chapel is one of three chapels royal in Canada Three sanctuaries in Canada have the designation of Chapel Royal, and all of them are located in the province of Ontario. Mohawk Chapel in Brantford was designated as a Chapel Royal in 1904 by Edward VII. The designation was made in recognition of the historic alliance between the Mohawk people and the Crown, referred to as the Covenant Chain. In 2004, Elizabeth II designated Christ Church near Deseronto as a Chapel Royal. The chapel served as the church for the Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory, and was designated as a Chapel Royal in recognition of the community's military service. The first two chapels royal are situated within Mohawk communities that were established in Canada after the American Revolutionary War. Several gifts from the Crown were bestowed on these chapels royal, including silver communion services and a bible from Queen Anne, a triptych from King George III, a bible from Queen Victoria, and a bicentennial chalice from Queen Elizabeth II. In 2010, Elizabeth II presented to the Mohawk Chapel a set of silver hand bells engraved with the words, \\"Silver Chain of Friendship, 1710‚Äì2010,\\" to commemorate the tricentennial of the first meeting between Mohawk representatives and the Crown. Prince Arthur at Mohawk Chapel in 1913. The sanctuary was designated as a Chapel Royal in 1904. In April 2016, the Queen approved in principle that St Catherine's Chapel in Toronto be designated a Chapel Royal. The chapel itself is situated within Massey College, a college of the University of Toronto, conceived by Vincent Massey, a former governor general of Canada. It became Canada's third Chapel Royal on 21 June 2017, during National Indigenous Peoples Day. St. Catherine's Chapel was designated as a Chapel Royal in recognition of the sesquicentennial of Canada, the relationship between Massey College and the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation, and as a gesture of reconciliation.

Rathcoole is also a civil parish in the Barony of Newcastle. Etymology R√°th is the Irish word for a ringfort, a circular embankment often erected by wealthy farmers or local chiefs. There are several forts in the civil parish of Rathcoole, one in a field between the village and Saggart village. There is no definite explanation for the name 'Rathcoole,' but it could well be R√°th Cumhaill meaning 'the ringfort of Cumhaill, the father of Fionn mac Cumhaill. Coole may also come from the Irish word for forest, \\"coill.\\" Location Rathcoole lies in the southwest \\"corner\\" of the traditional County Dublin, just off the N7 national primary road, southwest of Citywest and west of Saggart village. Close by to the north are Baldonnel and Casement Aerodrome, home of the Irish Air Corps. Also in this part of the county are Newcastle and, further away, Brittas.  Geography  Around Rathcoole are several streams, primarily draining the western end to the Griffeen River but south of the eastern end linking to the River Camac, both tributaries of the River Liffey. Aside from the village core, the area has housing developments such as Beechwood Lawns, located between the main street and the park, Forest Hills, Broadfield Manor to the west, and Peyton to the south. Historical notes Like neighbouring Saggart, and nearby Newcastle, Rathcoole was on the periphery of the Pale and was the site of many battles with mountain-based rebels, particularly the Byrnes and O'Tooles. The village had licence to hold a trading fair three times a year, a tradition which lapsed in the 19th century. The village was the birthplace in 1765 of the United Irishman Felix Rourke, and another local, a member of the Clinch family of Rathcoole House, was executed after the 1798 rising. In the late 18th century Rathcoole was composed mainly of mud huts, and as late as the early 20th century it consisted of only one street. Amenities Rathcoole has a well-maintained landscaped park, run by South Dublin County Council, at the eastern end of the village. There is also a community centre which caters for local events and training courses. There is a small supermarket, a bank and a credit union, and two service stations on the N7. One of Rathcoole's best known pubs is An Poitin Stil, which is built on the site of an original inn dating back to 1649. The other pubs in the area are Muldowneys, Baurnafea House, and The Rathcoole Inn. =Rathcoole House= Rathcoole is home to Rathcoole House, which was part of a wider estate. The house was built in 1750 and initially belonged to the Clinch family, later passing to the Sheils of Coolmine, who owned it from 1831 to 1962. The house had two main floors above ground and five bays, with a kitchen, milling room and stores in the basement, and a hall, dining room and drawing room on the ground floor. Part of the house was demolished in 1933, and the remainder is now ruined.  Education  Holy Family Community School at the western end of the village recently celebrated its twenty-fifth anniversary. It is a secondary school for students from Rathcoole and those commuting from the nearby towns of Clondalkin and Tallaght and the villages of Saggart and Brittas. There is also Holy Family National School located at the western end of Forest Hills, and a Gaelscoil in Rathcoole village itself. Sport The Rathcoole soccer club is known as \\"Rathcoole Boys\\". The well-known GAA club \\"Commercials Hurling Club\\" is located just off the Naas Road. The local basketball club is known as \\"Rathcoole Rockets\\". Rathcoole is close to a number of golf courses: Slade Valley, Citywest and Beech Park. Coolmine Equestrian Centre was established here in 1989, providing horse riding lessons and guided horseback trips. This equestrian centre welcomes international guests here on educational programmes, work experience and holidays. The centre became an Equestrian Academy and is now known locally as CEAD-Ireland. This Academy hosts festivals during the summer, with dance, music, pony rides, pet farms, dog shows and equestrian competitions.cead-ireland.com CEAD Ireland equestrian festival Notable people * Michelle Smith who won three gold medals and a bronze medal at the 1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta * Dermot Kennedy singer-songwriter Representation Rathcoole is in the Dublin Mid- West constituency and in the Clondalkin Local Electoral Area for county council elections (the area covers the area including Clondalkin, Newcastle and Saggart too).

Historically, film loading, advancing, and rewinding were all manually driven functions. The desires of professional photographers for more efficient shooting, particularly in sports and wildlife photography, and the desires of amateur and novice photographers for easier to use cameras both drove the development of automatic film transport. Some early developments were made with clockwork drives, but most development in the field has been in the direction of electrically driven transport. At first, motor drives were external units that attached to the basic camera body, normally beneath it, with an interface consisting of a physical drive socket and some electrical contacts to signal the drive when to actuate. Beginning in the late 1970s, motor drives began to be integrated into cameras themselves--at first, in compact cameras for the beginner market, and by the 1980s, in amateur-grade and later professional-grade single lens reflex cameras. By the 1990s, the vast majority of 35mm cameras had integral motor drive, and the feature found its way into some medium format cameras as well. Motor drives for compact and amateur cameras wind slowly--shot-to-shot intervals of approximately a second are commonplace. Professional grade cameras are faster, with speeds up to ten frames per second (fps). The first 35 mm SLR to achieve such a shooting speed was Nikon's F High Speed Motor Drive camera, first developed for the 1971 Chicago Photo Expo with 7 fps. To enable this speed and allow the photographer to more easily track the moving subject, this camera used a fixed, semi- transparent pellicle mirror instead of a moving mirror. Later special Canon models used similar mechanisms to achieve such speeds, while cameras with moving mirrors reached approximately five frames per second by the 1980s. Today, the fastest professional models from Canon and Nikon achieve approximately ten frames per second with a moving mirror. In the digital camera era, some users continue to refer to continuous shooting modes as \\"motor drive\\". Many camera models refer to different shooting modes--single shot, burst, continuous, self timer--as drive modes, thus keeping alive the terminology of film. An external battery grip is occasionally referred to as a motor drive as it tends to increase the frame rate.

The battle was a clear victory for Venice and the Knights Hospitaller over the Ottoman Empire, although their commander, Lorenzo Marcello, was killed on the first day.  Background  Since 1645, Venice and the Ottoman Empire had been at war over the possession of the island of Crete. Ottoman forces had captured most of the island in the early years of the war, but were unable to seize its capital, the heavily fortified city of Candia (modern Heraklion). The Venetians had endeavoured to cut off supplies and reinforcements to the Ottoman army, and attempted several times to blockade the Straits of the Dardanelles, through which the Ottoman fleet had to sail to reach the Aegean Sea from its base around Constantinople.  Preface  Marcello reached the island of Imbros, outside the Dardanelles Strait, on 23 May 1656 with 13 sailing ships, 6 galleasses and 24 galleys as well as some more vessels under Pietro Bembo. On 11 June, 7 Maltese galleys under Gregorio Carafa arrived, making a total of 29 sailing ships, 7 galleasses and 31 galleys.Setton (1991), p. 182Anderson (1956), p. 159 On 23 June the Ottomans, under Kenan or Chinam Pasha, a Russian convert, appeared in the Strait with 28 sailing ships, 9 galleasses and 61 galleys. On 24 June Turkish land batteries on either side of the Straits tried to drive the Venetians off but failed.  Battle  In the morning of 26 June the wind was from the north, and the Ottomans made good progress, the Venetian galleys being unable to assist their sailing ships. Then the wind backed, turning to the SE, trapping the Ottomans against the Asian side of the Strait just below the Narrows, and a m√™l√©e ensued. Kenan Pasha got back past the Narrows with 14 galleys but the rest were either captured, sunk or burnt. Sultan/San Marco was the most advanced Venetian ship and did the most to prevent the Ottoman retreat, but she ran aground under the Ottoman guns and was abandoned. During the course of the battle, the Venetian Captain General Marcello was killed by a direct cannon hit, but his death kept a secret from all but his second, the provedditore of the fleet Barbaro Badoer. Some small- scale fighting happened the next day, and at the end of it, the Ottoman fleet had lost 4 large sailing ships, 2 pinks, 5 galleasses and 13 galleys captured, and 22 sailing ships, 4 galleasses and 34 galleys sunk or burnt. Only 2 Ottoman sailing ships and 14 galleys escaped. Of the captured ships, Malta received 2 galleasses, 8 galleys and 1 \\"super galley\\" (or galleass?). The Venetians lost 3 sailing ships burnt and their casualties were 207 killed, 260 wounded and 94 missing. Maltese casualties were 40 killed and 100 or more wounded. Some 5,000 Christian slaves employed in the Ottoman fleet were freed.Setton (1991), p. 183  Aftermath  It was the heaviest naval defeat the Ottomans had suffered since the Battle of Lepanto,Finkel (2006), p. 248 and enabled the Venetians to occupy the strategically important islands of Tenedos and Lemnos, thus establishing a tight blockade of the Straits.Setton (1991), pp. 183-185 As a result, the resupply of Crete was effectively cut off, and Constantinople itself suffered a shortage of food during the winter.Finkel (2006), pp. 251-252 In a three-day battle in July 1657, however, the blockade would be broken again.Setton (1991), pp. 186-188  Ships involved  = Christian fleet =  Venice (Lorenzo Marcello, with Pietro Bembo)  *Fregata Contarini *Tomaso Francesco *Principessa grande *Tre Re *Croce d'Oro *Principessa piccola *Gallo d'Oro *Sacrificio d'Abram *Aquila Coronata (Kronede Arend) *Profeta Samuel *Arma di Nassau - Burnt *Lionessa *Arma di Lech *Leon Negro *Madonna del Carmine *Santa Caterina *Profeta Elia *San Bartolamio *Fama Volante *Ercole *Rosa Bianca *Speranza (or San Nicola) *Principe di Colognia *San Pietro (hired Dutch) - Burnt *Sultana/San Marco (ex-Ottoman) - Aground, abandoned and burnt *Santa Margarita *Paramor *? *? *7 galleasses *24 galleys  Malta (Gregorio Carafa)  *7 galleys = Ottoman Empire (Kenan Pasha) = *4 large sailing ships - Captured *24 other sailing ships - 22 sunk/burnt *2 pinks - Captured *9 galleasses - 5 captured, 4 sunk/burnt *61 galleys - 13 captured, 34 sunk/burnt  References   Sources   * the Dardanelles 1656 Dardanelles 1656 Dardanelles 1656 History of the Dardanelles ","title":"Battle of the Dardanelles (1656)"},{"id":"990763","text":"The Fourth Battle of the Dardanelles in the Fifth Ottoman-Venetian War took place between 17 and 19 July 1657 outside the mouth of the Dardanelles Strait.

Directed by Cathy Malkasian and Jeff McGrath, the film follows Eliza Thornberry, on her quest to rescue a baby cheetah cub named Tally from ruthless poachers. It was produced by Nickelodeon Movies and Klasky Csupo and distributed by Paramount Pictures. The film was released on December 20, 2002 to mostly positive reviews and grossed more than $60 million worldwide. The film was also nominated for Best Original Song at the 75th Academy Awards, making it the first and only film based on a Nicktoon to be nominated. It is also the third film to be based on a Klasky Csupo series (after The Rugrats Movie and Rugrats in Paris: The Movie). Plot Eliza Thornberry plays with a family of cheetahs in East Africa's Kenya after being left in charge of the cubs by their mother, Akela. When Eliza strays far from the cheetahs' home, one of the cheetah cubs, Tally, is kidnapped by poachers. Eliza is determined to save the cub, which prompts her grandmother Cordelia to bring her to a boarding school in London for her safety. Upon arriving, Eliza discovers that her pet chimpanzee, Darwin, stowed away in her suitcase. He attempts to blend in but gets both himself and Eliza in trouble. After having a dream in which Shaman Mnyambo tells her to save Tally, Eliza convinces her roommate Sarah Wellington to buy plane tickets for her and Darwin to return to Africa. While taking a train from Nairobi, they encounter an injured male rhinoceros, who was shot at the river by the same poachers, who kidnapped Tally. They jump off the train to save the rhino with the help of veterinarians Bree and Sloan Blackburn. Meanwhile, Eliza's older sister Debbie is left alone with her feral adoptive younger brother Donnie at their comvee, while their parents, Nigel and Marianne, go to film a solar eclipse at Tempo Valley. Eliza returns to the Comvee for supplies; after a small confrontation, Debbie pursues her, Darwin, and Donnie. Cordelia and her husband, Colonel Radcliffe, meet up with Nigel and Marianne to inform them of Eliza's escape, and they also begin searching for Eliza. Darwin, Eliza, and Donnie meet a gorilla who mentions seeing people setting up a fence across Tempo Valley. Then, they run into the Blackburns again. Eliza concludes that the poachers are targeting the elephant herd traveling through the valley. Later, the trio finds Tally in the Blackburns' RV, exposing their true nature as the poachers. The Blackburns capture them and reveal the fence is electrified. Eliza and Darwin get into an argument and Eliza shouts at Darwin to be quiet. Meanwhile, Debbie meets a local Mbuti boy named Boko, who is sent by his village elders to assist her. The two reach the Blackburns' RV, but Sloan holds Debbie hostage after she reveals she is Eliza's sister. When Sloan threatens to kill Debbie if Eliza doesn't tell him how she found out their plan, Eliza admits it was because of her ability to talk to animals. A storm comes and takes away Eliza's powers while the Blackburns flee. They reach Tempo Valley in time to see the elephant herd heading for the electric fence. When Eliza becomes doubtful of herself, Debbie reminds her that she has been helping animals long before gaining her powers, restoring her confidence. The Blackburns, riding a helicopter, order their men to set off explosives, scaring the elephants and making them charge toward the fence. Eliza triggers the fence's electricity prematurely, causing the herd to stop temporarily, and then convinces the lead elephant to turn around. Infuriated by this, Sloan throws Eliza into a river. He then attempts to shoot the elephants, but they pull the Blackburns' helicopter out of the air by its rope ladder and destroy it, causing him and Bree to fall. As Eliza is falling, she is saved by Shaman Mnyambo, who tells her she saved the elephants using her heart instead of her powers. As a reward, he gives her back her powers. After the eclipse, the Blackburns are arrested by rangers, Eliza reconciles with Darwin and she reunites with her family, who decide not to send her back to boarding school, while Boko returns to his village, keeping Debbie's watch as a memento. The Thornberrys return to the Savannah, where Eliza reunites Tally with his family. Debbie is angered when Eliza tells her that she will turn into a baboon if she reveals her secret, and in the process frightens a group of baboons Nigel and Marianne are filming. One of them activates the radio, which plays music that the Thornberrys and the baboons dance to.

A long term fixture of the country's second division, Alemannia enjoyed a three-year turn in the Bundesliga in the late 1960s and, after a successful 2005‚Äì06 campaign, returned to the first division for a single season. The club has since slipped to third division play and in late 2012 entered into bankruptcy. They finished their 2012‚Äì13 3. Liga schedule before resuming play in the tier IV Regionalliga West in 2013‚Äì14. Alemannia carries the nickname \\"the potato beetles\\" (Kartoffelk√§fer) because of their striped yellow-black jerseys, which make them look like the particular insects. History =Foundation to World War II= In the second half of the 19th century, resident English merchants and industrialists brought football, in addition to the traditional equestrian sports, into the western Rhineland. The club was founded on 16 December 1900 by a group of eighteen high school students. Knowing that another team had already taken the name 1. FC Aachen, the new club was christened FC Alemannia using a Latin word for Germany (see Alamannia). The First World War devastated the club: the pre-war membership of 200 was reduced to just 37 by the conflict. In early 1919 Alemannia merged with Aachener Turnverein 1847 to become TSV Alemannia Aachen 1900. Their new partner's interest was primarily in gymnastics and the union was short-lived, with the clubs splitting again in 1924. The city of Aachen is near the Belgian and Dutch borders and as a result Alemannia has had frequent contact with clubs from those countries. Their first game was against the Belgian side R. Dolhain F.C., one of that country's earliest clubs. There are intensive and friendly contacts with the Dutch professional club Roda JC Kerkrade. Both clubs have the same club colors. The team played in the Rhineland-Westphalia FA and won its first championship there in 1907, before joining the newly formed Westdeutsche Fussball Verband in 1909. The club grew steadily as interest in football increased. They qualified for the Rheingauliga in 1921, built their own stadium in 1928, and earned admittance to the Oberliga the following year. The club enjoyed some success in the early 1930s by advancing to the final four of the Westdeutsche championship playoffs. In 1933, German football was re-organized under the Third Reich into sixteen top-flight Gauligen. Alemannia played several seasons in the Gauliga Mittelrhein in the late 1930s and early 1940s. They finished atop their division in 1938 and advanced to the national final rounds. This was in spite of a protest by SV Beuel 06 which ultimately saw that club awarded the division championship, but too late to allow Beuel to play in the national playoff in Aachen's stead. Alemannia is known as one of the few of this era to offer any challenge to the Nazi regime's purge of Jews from the country's sports organizations by demanding the release of a jailed Jewish member. =Postwar and entry to the Bundesliga= In 1946, after World War II and the lifting of the ban placed by Allied occupation authorities on most types of organizations in Germany, Alemannia re-constituted itself and began play in second tier Rheinbezirk. They returned to first division play in the Oberliga West the next year, but ran into financial difficulty. They remained a steady, but unspectacular second division side, generally finishing mid- table. Aachen's first measure of success came with an advance to the DFB-Pokal final in 1953 where they lost a 1‚Äì2 decision to Rot-Weiss Essen. After the formation of the Bundesliga, Germany's new professional football league, in 1963, Alemannia found themselves in Regionalliga West (II). In 1965, they had another good run in German Cup competition, earning another final appearance ‚Äì but were once again unsuccessful ‚Äì this time losing 0‚Äì2 to Borussia Dortmund. The club captured their division in 1967 and were promoted to the Bundesliga (I) for the 1967‚Äì68 season. They enjoyed their best ever result the next year with a second-place finish behind champion Bayern Munich. However, the following season was a disaster: the team earned only one point in play away from home and toppled to an 18th-place finish. They returned to play in the Regionalliga West (II), and in 1990 fell still further to the third division. =Road to recovery= Former logo of Alemannia Aachen After several mediocre seasons in the second half of the 1990s, trainer Werner Fuchs rejuvenated the Alemannia squad by playing 4‚Äì4‚Äì2 without a libero (sweeper), creating a side that played an attractive, fluid offense. In 1999, the team played well and delivered an especially strong second half. They were atop the table, just weeks away from the end of the season, when tragedy struck with the unexpected death of Fuchs. The whole city was in shock, but the club managed to pull through, dedicating their promotion to their late trainer and winning the Regionalliga West/S√ºdwest (III).Im memoriam Werner Fuchs The first years in the 2. Bundesliga were tough for Aachen, both on the field and financially. The club struggled for several seasons and the situation was worsened when financial irregularities were uncovered showing the club was near bankruptcy. The turnaround came with a new executive board under president Horst Heinrichs, trainer Dieter Hecking and manager J√∂rg Schmadtke. Through improved financial management, shrewd player signings, and clever game tactics, Aachen became a power once again in the 2003‚Äì04 season. They played their way to their third DFB-Pokal final appearance, knocking off TSV 1860 Munich, Bayern Munich, and Borussia M√∂nchengladbach, before losing 2‚Äì3 to Bundesliga champions Werder Bremen. As league champions Bremen already held a place in the UEFA Champions League, thereby making room for Aachen to take part in the UEFA Cup competition. They delivered a decent performance, advancing to the Round of 32 before going out to eventual semi-finalists AZ Alkmaar. The club's participation in the German Cup and UEFA Cup play helped to significantly improve their financial situation. =Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga= On 16 April 2006, Alemannia became the first team to earn promotion to the Bundesliga in 2005‚Äì06, ending Aachen's 36-year absence from top-flight football. However, they stayed up only a single season as they took only one point from their last eight matches of the campaign. In the middle of 2007, the club appointed former German international defender and 1990 FIFA World Champion Guido Buchwald as manager trainer, who was fired after only 14 matches. After a short interim with Alemannia's Sportsmanger J√∂rg Schmadtke as headcoach, he was then replaced by J√ºrgen Seeberger, hardly known in Germany, in the winter break of the season. The club suffered a rapid decline after its single Bundesliga season, being relegated from the 2. Bundesliga in 2012 and from the 3. Liga the season after. Alemannia consequently now plays in the tier four Regionalliga West. Recent seasons Historical chart of Alemannia Aachen league performance after World War II =Bundesliga and 2.

One of Germany's better known stadiums, it was built in 1908 and was renovated several times. The club played its 2004 UEFA Cup matches, however, in Cologne's RheinEnergieStadion in order to meet the stadium capacity requirements in place for the competition. In August 2009 Aachen opened a new stadium, the New Tivoli, which has a capacity of 32,960 spectators (11,681 in standing areas).

Interference might be committed by players on the offense, players not currently in the game, catchers, umpires, or spectators. Each type of interference is covered differently by the rules. Offensive interference A runner jumping over a ball to avoid an offensive interference The most common incidence of interference occurs when a member of the offensive team physically hinders the defensive team, decreasing its chances to make an out or increasing the chance that a baserunner will advance. Whenever this offensive interference occurs, the ball becomes dead. If the interference was committed by a batter or a baserunner, that player is called out and all other runners must return to the bases they occupied at the time of the interference. If interference is committed by a runner with the obvious intent of preventing a double play, the batter-runner will be called out in addition to the runner who committed the interference. If interference is committed by the batter-runner before he or she reaches first base with the possible intent of preventing a double play, the runner closest to scoring is called out in addition to the batter-runner. If interference is committed by a retired runner or by some other member of the offensive team, the runner who is most likely to have been put out will be called out. Under Little League (LL), high school (NFHS) and college (NCAA) rules, if interference is committed by a runner with the effect of preventing a likely double play, regardless of his intent, the batter-runner will be called out in addition to the runner who committed the interference. Also under NFHS rules only, all runners are required to attempt to avoid collisions. If a runner fails to do so, he is guilty of malicious contact, which is one kind of offensive interference. Malicious contact carries the additional penalty of ejection from the game. In contrast, in professional and higher amateur baseball, violent collisions can occur without any interference (or obstruction), especially when a fielder is receiving a thrown ball near a base where a runner is trying to reach. Any collision that occurs in this situation is not interference, because the fielder's action is in regard to a thrown ball. As long as such a runner's actions are related to his attempt to reach the base, he cannot be called for interference. The most common case of this is when a runner is attempting to score and the catcher has control of the ball. If the catcher is in the path between third base and home plate, the baserunner may strike the catcher with his body in an attempt to dislodge the ball from the catcher's hand and then reach home plate. This is usually attempted only when the play is close. When the catcher is set up and ready, the runner has little chance of knocking the ball away. Any such attempt presents a significant chance of injury to the baserunner, which has prompted the malicious contact rule to be used more often. In addition to the general subjective definition of offensive interference, it is also interference by specific rule when: * The bat hits the ball a second time in fair territory, such as while the bat is being dropped; * A batter or runner intentionally deflects the course of a batted ball in any manner; * A member of the offensive team stands near a base to impersonate a baserunner or to otherwise confuse or hinder the defense; * A coach physically assists a runner in returning to or leaving first or third base; * A batter, while running to first base, runs outside the three-foot running lane and interferes with the fielder taking a throw at first base; * A runner makes contact with a batted ball that did not go through or by a fielder, unless no infielder had a chance to immediately field the ball (in this instance, the runner is out, the batter is credited with a base hit, and no other runner advances unless forced to advance one base); * A runner makes contact with a fielder attempting to field a batted ball, except the batter with the catcher in the immediate vicinity of home plate immediately after the ball was batted; or * A member of the offensive team intentionally touches a thrown ball, or intentionally hinders a fielder attempting to make a throw. * The batter physically hinders the catcher's opportunity to throw out a baserunner while standing outside of the batter's box. There are some exceptions to the penalty for offensive interference. * If there are fewer than two outs and a runner is trying to score, and the batter interferes with the tag attempt at home plate, then the runner is out for the batter's interference, while the batter is not out. If there are two outs in this situation, the normal interference penalty applies: the batter is out and the run does not score. * If a runner's interference is caused by his being positioned at a legally occupied base and the fielder is trying to make a play on a batted ball in the vicinity of the base, interference is not called. =Verbal interference= At some levels of play, verbal as well as physical hindrance can be called for interference. For example, if a runner or other member of the offense calls out \\"foul\\" on a fair ball or \\"mine\\" on a fly ball, he may cause the defense to react differently from how they otherwise would have, resulting in an interference call. Some professional leagues do not have a distinction for verbal interference or obstruction and leave it as umpire judgement. The NPB in Japan, for example, verbal interference is illegal and runners will be called out on any spoken word meant to confuse a fielder or fielders during a play. While in the MLB, in North America, it is left as umpire judgement. =Cases of offensive interference= On October 15, 1969, in Game Four of the 1969 World Series between the New York Mets and Baltimore Orioles, Mets pinch hitter J.C. Martin attempted a tenth-inning sacrifice bunt which Orioles pitcher Pete Richert fielded; however, Richert's throw to first base hit Martin on the wrist and the ball ricocheted into right field, allowing Mets baserunner Rod Gaspar to score the winning run from second base. The Orioles protested vehemently, but although replays showed Martin ran inside the first base line, umpires ruled the play valid and no interference was called. The win gave the \\"Miracle Mets\\" a 3-1 lead in the Series, and they closed out their championship season with a win the next day. An alleged offensive interference occurred in the third game of the 1975 World Series. With a runner on first, Cincinnati Reds player Ed Armbrister laid down a sacrifice bunt. Red Sox catcher Carlton Fisk attempted to field the ball and throw to second base and get the lead runner out. However, Armbrister did not immediately run to first base but instead stood essentially still in the vicinity of home plate, forcing Fisk to jump into him in order to make the throw. As a result, Fisk's throw went into center field, and the Reds ended up with runners on first and third with no outs. The Red Sox protested, saying that Armbrister interfered, but home plate umpire Larry Barnett refused to change the call. The rules at the time did not mention a batter-runner/catcher collision, but the official interpretation issued to the umpires did; there is no violation on such unintentional contact.https://web.archive.org/web/20070927161133/http://xsorbit27.com/users5/historicbaseball/index.php?topic=40.0 The Red Sox lost the game, and the series. Umpire's interference It is umpire's interference when the umpire hinders a catcher's attempt to throw anywhere. In this case, if the catcher's direct throw retires a runner the play stands. If not, the ball is dead and all runners must return to the bases they had most recently touched (before the catcher's throw). It is also umpire's interference when an umpire is struck by a fair batted ball before it touches a fielder including the pitcher or passes near an infielder other than the pitcher. This can occur either because an umpire is inside the diamond or because the ball crosses 1st or 3rd base in fair territory then hooks or slices foul into the umpire positioned just outside the line behind the bag. In this case, the ball is dead, the batter is awarded first base, and all other runners advance only if forced. A common example is when a batter hits a fair ball down the first base line so hard that the first base umpire can't avoid it. Even though the hit would have surely been a bases-clearing double or triple without the interference, it is only a single and runners advance no more than one base. This happened in the 1989 All-Star Game when the Pittsburgh Pirates' Bobby Bonilla led off the 9th with a scorching grounder that would have been an easy double, but it hit first base umpire Bob Engel in the legs as he tried to jump out of the way. Instead of being in scoring position down 5‚Äì3, Bonilla was forced out at 2nd the next play and the game ended on a double play. Catcher's interference Jacoby Ellsbury, the all time leader in times being interfered with by a catcher. Catcher's interference is called when the catcher physically hinders the batter's opportunity to legally swing at a pitched ball. This occurs most often when a catcher squats too close to home plate, so that the batter's bat touches the catcher's mitt as the batter swings. This is most likely to happen on attempted steals where the catcher is anxious to catch the ball as soon as possible and may move his entire body or mitt forward a bit. It also more commonly happens to hitters, such as Jacoby Ellsbury, (who holds the record for the most times interfered with by a catcher in both a single season and his career Topps 2018 NY-13 Team SetTopps 2017 Series 1, Card Number 197) who frequently let pitches get deeper and take later swings. In this case, play continues, and after continuous playing action ceases, the umpire will call time. The penalty here is that the batter is awarded first base, any runner attempting to steal is awarded that base, and all other runners advance only if forced. Additionally, the catcher is charged with an error and the batter is not charged with an at-bat. However, if the actual playing result is more advantageous than the penalty, the offense may elect to ignore the infraction (e.g., if the batter-runner reaches first safely and all other runners advance at least one base, catcher's interference is ignored by rule, or if a run scores even though the play resulted in an out the offense may elect to take the play versus the penalty by appealing to the calling Umpire.) Under high school (NFHS) rules only, catcher's interference is instead called catcher's obstruction. Spectator interference When a spectator or other person not associated with one of the teams (including such staff as bat and ball boys/girls) alters play in progress, it is spectator interference, colloquially called fan interference. It is worth noting that the latter is also (incorrectly) used to refer to fan obstruction ‚Äì for instance a spectator running onto the field and tackling a baserunner.23 Ways to First ‚Äì Eephus League The ball becomes dead, and the umpire will award any bases or charge any outs that, in his judgment, would have occurred without the interference.http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/game_preliminaries_3.jsp Such interference often occurs when a spectator in the first row of seats reaches onto the field to attempt to grab a fair or foul fly ball. If the umpire judges that the fielder could have caught the ball over the field (i.e., the ball would have not crossed over the plane of the wall), he will rule the batter out on spectator interference. Also, the spectator who commits interference is usually ejected from the stadium. Note that spectators are allowed to catch a ball that is in play when the ball has broken the plane of the spectators' side of the wall. The area where both fielders and spectators are legally allowed to catch the ball is colloquially called no man's land. Umpires typically grab their wrist above their head to signal that spectator interference has occurred. =Cases of possible spectator interference= *On October 9, 1996, Jeffrey Maier became well loved in New York but hated in Baltimore over spectator interference that was not called by the umpire. In the eighth inning of Game 1 of the American League Championship Series, with the Yankees trailing 4‚Äì3, Derek Jeter, the Yankee shortstop, hit a fly to the right field wall. Oriole right fielder Tony Tarasco backtracked and positioned himself to catch Jeter's fly ball just short of the wall. Maier, a 12-year-old spectator seated in the bleachers, reached out to catch the ball, and deflected it away from Tarasco and over the fence. Umpire Rich Garcia ruled the play a home run rather than calling Jeter out on spectator interference or awarding him a double. Garcia later said he believed the ball was uncatchable, but video of the play shows the ball was touched in the field of play, although Garcia may not have been in position to see the interference. Maier's interference and Garcia's call resulted in a game-tying home run for Jeter. The Yankees won the game in extra innings and prevailed in the series in five games. *On July 6, 2010, the Seattle Mariners trailed the visiting Kansas City Royals 3‚Äì2 in the 8th inning of a game. With runner Ichiro Suzuki on first base for the Mariners, Mariners designated hitter Russell Branyan hit a double down the right field line. As Royals outfielder David DeJesus attempted to make a play on the ball, a young fan reached onto the field and picked up the ball. The play was ruled an automatic double, and the umpires ruled that Branyan would take second base and that Ichiro would take third base, denying him a potential opportunity to score on the play. Both Ichiro and Branyan would be stranded on the bases, and the Royals held on for the 3‚Äì2 victory. *On October 19, 2010, in the second inning of Game 4 of the American League Championship Series, with no score, Yankees player Robinson Can√≥ hit a fly to the right field wall. Rangers right fielder Nelson Cruz backtracked and positioned himself to jump in the air and attempt to catch Cano's fly ball at the wall. Jared Macchirole, a 20-year-old spectator seated in the bleachers, reached out to catch the ball, and in doing so, made contact with the glove of Cruz, ending his upward momentum, and ensuring that Cruz would not catch the ball, that did reach the seats. Right Field Umpire Jim Reynolds ruled the play a home run rather than calling for Instant Replay review to determine whether spectator interference had occurred as specified by MLB's new rule regarding Instant Replay. The potential interference and umpire's call resulted in a solo home run for Cano, the Yankees taking a 1‚Äì0 lead at the time. *On September 4, 2011, Hunter Pence of the Philadelphia Phillies hit a fly ball to deep right field. Originally ruled a live ball, instant replay showed Marlins right fielder Bryan Petersen was interfered with by multiple fans during his opportunity to catch a ball, under Rule 2.00 INTERFERENCE (d)(1) and (2). After instant replay review, first base umpire and crew chief Joe West ruled Pence out under the provisions of spectator interference, Rule 3.16, and sent Phillies baserunner Ryan Howard back to first base. Phillies Manager Charlie Manuel was ejected and elected to play the game under protest. On September 7, 2011, MLB VP of Baseball Operations Joe Torre denied the first ever protest associated with authorized instant replay usage. *On June 8, 2014, Brian Roberts of the New York Yankees was at bat against the Royals at Kauffman Stadium in the top of the 4th inning. He hit a ball down the first base line that the first base umpire ruled fair. Thinking it was a foul ball, a ball person in foul territory in right field picked the ball up and gave it to a fan. The play was ruled dead and Brian Roberts was awarded a double. However, the Yankees did not score that inning and they lost the game 2-1. *On August 17, 2018, during the fifth inning of a game between the San Diego Padres and Arizona Diamondbacks, Padres batter Eric Hosmer hit a fly ball to deep left center. Diamondbacks outfielder Jon Jay moved to the wall in an attempt to catch it, but a fan seated in the front row reached over the wall with his cup of beer. The ball struck the cup and bounced over the wall into the outfield seats; the play was initially ruled a home run, then reviewed at the Diamondbacks' request. Fan interference was not called, and the play was allowed to stand. The Padres ultimately lost the game, 9-4. *On October 17, 2018, during the fourth game of the 2018 American League Championship Series, Houston Astros batter Jos√© Altuve hit a potential two-run homer in the bottom of the first inning. Although the ball went into the stands despite Boston Red Sox right fielder Mookie Betts' leaping attempt to catch it at the wall, Altuve was ruled out due to fan interference, and the call stood after being reviewed on video. Boston ultimately won the game 8-6 and would go on to win both the ALCS and the 2018 World Series. Common misconceptions When a fielder hinders a baserunner, the situation is called obstruction, not interference. Baseball commentators will often mistakenly refer to obstruction as interference. Not all physical contact in baseball is interference. Accidental contact that has little or no effect on play will usually be ignored; physical contact must result in an advantageous situation for the offense to be considered offensive interference. Nor must physical contact occur for interference to be called. A runner may interfere with a fielder simply by hindering the fielder's ability to attempt to make a play on a batted ball. If a base runner is hit by a fair-batted ball while standing on a base, the runner is out, unless the ball has already passed an infielder or the infield fly rule has been declared. The base is not a sanctuary. Being in contact with a base may protect a baserunner from being called out for interference in the case of a fielder attempting to field a batted ball. Per MLB rules: \\"If [a] runner has contact with a legally occupied base when he hinders [a fielder who is attempting to make a play on a batted ball], he shall not be called out unless, in the umpire‚Äôs judgment, such hindrance, whether it occurs on fair or foul territory, is intentional. If the umpire declares the hindrance intentional, the following penalty shall apply: With less than two out, the umpire shall declare both the runner and batter out. With two out, the umpire shall declare the batter out.\\" Per Little League rules:Little League Umpire School Rules Instruction Manual (RIM). PREPARED FOR THE 2010 REGIONAL LITTLE LEAGUE UMPIRE SCHOOLS 7.08‚ÄîAny runner is out when ‚Äì (b) intentionally interferes with a thrown ball; or hinders a fielder attempting to make a play on a batted ball. (NOTE: A runner who is adjudged to have hindered a fielder who is attempting to make a play on a batted ball is out whether it was intentional or not.)

It is situated north of the Hampstead Road Lock of the Regent's Canal (popularly referred to as Camden Lock). Famed for their cosmopolitan image, products sold on the stalls include crafts, clothing, bric-a-brac, and fast food. It is the fourth-most popular visitor attraction in London, attracting approximately 250,000 people each week. A small local foodstuffs market has operated in Inverness Street in Camden Town since the beginning of the 20th century. On 30 March 1974 a small weekly crafts market that operated every Sunday near Camden Lock developed into a large complex of markets. The markets, originally temporary stalls only, extended to a mixture of stalls and fixed premises. The traditional Inverness Street market started losing stalls once local supermarkets opened; by mid-2013 all the original stalls had gone, being replaced by stalls similar to those of the other markets, including fast food but not produce. The markets originally operated on Sundays only, which continues to be the main trading day. Opening later extended to Saturdays for most of the market. A number of traders, mainly those in fixed premises, operate throughout the week, although the weekend remains the peak period. In 2014, Israeli billionaire Teddy Sagi started buying property in the Camden Market area. By March 2015, having purchased the four most important of the six sections of the market, he announced plans to invest ¬£300 million in developing the market area by 2018.  The markets  There are six distinct Camden markets. = Camden Lock Market = Camden Lock Market General view Camden Lock Market is situated by the Regent's Canal on a site formerly occupied by warehouses and other premises associated with the canal. By the early 1970s the canal trade had ceased and a northern urban motorway was planned that would cut through the site, making any major permanent redevelopment impossible, and in 1974 a temporary market was established. By 1976, when plans for the motorway were abandoned, the market had become a well known feature of Camden Town. Originally, the Lock was a market for crafts, occupying some outdoor areas by the canal and various existing buildings. While the range of goods has since widened, with stalls selling books, new and second-hand clothing, and jewellery, the Lock retains its focus as the principal Camden market for crafts. There is a large selection of fast food stalls. In 1991 a three-storey indoor market hall designed by architect John Dickinson was opened on the site of the first outdoor market. In the style of the traditional 19th century industrial architecture and housing in the area, it is built of brick and cast iron. It attracted large numbers of visitors partly due to stalls being open on Sundays, when previous to the Sunday Trading Act 1994, shops were not permitted to operate on Sundays. On 28 February 1993, the Provisional IRA exploded a bomb hidden in a litter bin on Camden High Street near the market, shortly after lunchtime. The bomb injured 11 people. From 2006, a large indoor market hall was constructed in a yard between the Camden Lock Market and the Stables Market that was previously used for open air stalls. In November 2007 a large part of the Stables Market was demolished as part of a long-term redevelopment plan for the area and rebuilt as a year-round permanent market area. In 2016, Urban Markets Company acquired Camden Lock and paid between ¬£300m and ¬£400m for the one-acre site. The joint venture between the founders of Camden Lock and Millitarne Retail Resorts International, the retail developers, was financed by Brockton Capital, a real estate private equity fund. Camden Lock Market is set to have a ¬£20 million makeover to transform it into a traditional arts and craft centre for Londoners. The Urban Market Company plans to double the enclosed area and increase trading space by 15,000 square feet. 2017 fire Early on 10 July 2017, shortly after midnight, a large fire (cause currently unknown) occurred at the Camden Lock Market. At least 70 firefighters and 10 engines attended. = Stables Market = The Stables Market was owned by Bebo Kobo, Richard Caring and Elliot Bernerd of Chelsfield Partners until 2014. It was sold in 2014 for $685 million and is owned today by Market Tech PLC, a UK AIM listed public company. The market is located in the historic former Pickfords stables and Grade II listed horse hospital which served the horses pulling Pickford's distribution vans and barges along the canal. Many of the stalls and shops are set in large arches in railway viaducts. Chain stores are not permitted and trade is provided by a mixture of small enclosed and outdoor shops and stalls, of which some are permanent, and others hired by the day. In common with most of the other Camden markets the Stables Market has many clothes stalls. It is also the main focus for furniture in the markets. Household goods, decorative, ethnically- influenced items, and second-hand items or 20th-century antiques, many of them hand-crafted, are among the wares. There are also clothing and art pieces for alternative sub-cultures, such as goths and cybergoths. These shops include Black Rose, which caters for goths, with items such as coffin-shaped handbags, and Cyberdog, which houses much cyber-style \\"neon\\" PVC and rubber clothing. During the weeks before Christmas 2004, radio DJ and TV presenter Chris Evans sold many of his possessions, ranging from sofas to TVs and crockery, on a stall in the Stables Market. The Stables Market entrance Horse Tunnel Market in August 2012 In October 2006 a large indoor market hall was built in a yard between the Stables Market and Camden Lock Market that was previously used for temporary open-air stalls. In the summer of 2007 redevelopment of the back of the Stables Market took place. This redevelopment consisted of two new four- storey buildings housing shops, food outlets, offices, workshops and storage facilities, as well as an exhibition space. The redevelopment included a new pedestrian route through the rear of the Stables Market exposing 25 of the existing railway arches. Pedestrian walkways‚Äîin the style of the existing historic ramp and bridge system‚Äîhas opened up the site and increased access for visitors. A glass roof and cycle parking spaces has also been added. On 19 May 2014, at around 8:00 p.m., a fire broke out at the Camden Stables Market on Chalk Farm Road where a reported 10 fire engines and 70 firefighters dealt with the blaze. No injuries were reported by the London Ambulance Service and the London Fire Brigade announced that the fire had been controlled since 9:00 p.m. = Camden Lock Village = The view of the Camden Lock Village from the bridge over Regent's Canal prior to redevelopment Owned by Bebo Kobo and OD Kobo, Camden Lock Village was the section along the canal to the east of Chalk Farm Road was known as the Canal Market and had a covered entrance tunnel leading into a general outdoor market. The market was devastated by fire on 9 February 2008 caused by unauthorised use of a liquified petroleum gas heater. After crossing the railway line, the fire badly damaged the rear of the Hawley Arms on Castlehaven Road.The Hawley Arms pub in Camden ‚Äì before the fire destroyed it (thelondonpaper) The market reopened in May 2009 as the Camden Lock Village. The cover over the original street entrance was removed, and a new entrance created near the railway bridge. The market closed in early 2015 as the area is being redeveloped as Hawley Wharf. = Buck Street Market: 'The Camden Market' (closed down) = The Buck Street Market was an outdoor market focusing on clothes. There is no formal or legal definition of Camden Market; the Buck Street Market's sign read 'The Camden Market'. A few stallholders designed their own wares, while at the weekend these designs were more likely to be found in the Electric Ballroom market. This Buck Street market is now closed down to renovate the tube station. = Electric Ballroom = The Electric Ballroom on Camden High Street has been a night club since the 1950s. The weekend market had been operating here for at least 24 years but closed at short notice in 2015, leaving many staff and traders unemployed. = Inverness Street Market = Inverness Street Market is a street market close to Camden Town tube station.

As of early 2020 it remains unavailable. In 1995, Brownlow and Gill produced the followup series, Cinema Europe: The Other Hollywood, which explores the rise of the silent film industry in Sweden, Germany, France and Great Britain.  Synopsis  The series consists of 13 50-minute episodes, with each episode dealing with a specific aspect of Hollywood history. The actor James Mason, an enthusiast of the period, supplied the narration Amazon.com: Hollywood: A Celebration of the American Silent Film, Complete Set 1‚Äì13 VHS while a lilting score was contributed by Carl Davis.FilmAffinity Technical quality was an important aspect of the production. Silent films had often been screened on television from poor-quality copies running at an inaccurate speed, usually accompanied by honky tonky piano music. Hollywood used silent film clips sourced from the best available material, shown at their original running speed via a polygonal prism telecine, and with an orchestral score, giving viewers a chance to see what they originally looked and sounded like. For instance, the first episode features a clip of Life of an American Fireman, produced in 1903 with the aforementioned stereotypical poor quality print and music and then compares that with a clip of The Fire Brigade, produced over two decades later in 1926, in a high quality print run at the proper speed with full orchestral accompaniment. The producers filmed the recollections of many of the period's surviving participants, and illustrated their interviews with scenes from their various films, as well as production still photographs, and historical photographs of the Los Angeles environs. Some of these interviews are notable for being among the only filmed interviews given by their subjects.SlashFilm Participants Among the notable people who contributed interviews were: * ActorsMary Astor, Eleanor Boardman, Louise Brooks, Olive Carey, Iron Eyes Cody, Jackie Coogan, Dolores Costello, Viola Dana, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Janet Gaynor, Leatrice Joy, Lillian Gish, Bessie Love, Ben Lyon, Marion Mack, Tim McCoy, Colleen Moore, Charles 'Buddy' Rogers, Gloria Swanson, Blanche Sweet, John Wayne, and Lois Wilson. * DirectorsDorothy Arzner, Clarence Brown, Karl Brown, Frank Capra, George Cukor, Allan Dwan, Byron Haskin, Henry Hathaway, Henry King, Lewis Milestone, Hal Roach, Albert S. Rogell, King Vidor, and William Wyler. Also interviewed were choreographer Agnes de Mille, writer Anita Loos, writer Adela Rogers St. Johns, press agent/writer Cedric Belfrage, organist Gaylord Carter, cinematographers George J. Folsey, Lee Garmes and Paul Ivano, writer Jesse L. Lasky, Jr., special effects artist A. Arnold Gillespie, Lord Mountbatten, agent Paul Kohner, producer/writer Samuel Marx, editors William Hornbeck and Grant Whytock, property man Lefty Hough, stuntmen Bob Rose, Yakima Canutt, Paul Malvern, and Harvey Parry, Rudolph Valentino's brother, Alberto Valentino and English set designer Laurence Irving.'Hollywood: A Celebration of the American Silent Film': An Eleven-Hour Investigative Odyssey¬∑Cinephilia & Beyond  Episodes  # \\"The Pioneers\\"The evolution of film from penny arcade curiosity to art form, from what was considered the first plot driven film, The Great Train Robbery, through to The Birth of a Nation, films showing the power of the medium. Early Technicolor footage, along with other color technologies, are also featured. Interviews include Lillian Gish, Jackie Coogan and King Vidor. # \\"In the Beginning\\"Hollywood is transformed from a peaceful village with dusty streets and lemon groves to the birthplace of the industry in California. Silent film transcends international boundaries to become a worldwide phenomenon. Interviews include Henry King, Agnes de Mille, and Lillian Gish. # \\"Single Beds and Double Standards\\"Fast success in Hollywood brings a cavalier party lifestyle, which led to shocking scandals such as Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle's trial and subsequent acquittal for manslaughter. To tone down the image of Hollywood and curtail films with footage unsuitable to all audiences, Will H. Hays is appointed and introduces Hollywood's self regulated Production Code, which would be enforced well into the 1960s, while filmmakers still found creative ways to present 'adult' situations. Interviews include King Vidor and Gloria Swanson. # \\"Hollywood Goes to War\\"The outbreak of World War I provides Hollywood with a successful source for plots and profits. Peacetime curtails the release of war movies, until the release of King Vidor's The Big Parade in 1925. Wings (1927) earns the first Academy Award for Best Picture. As movies transition to sound, Universal releases Lewis Milestone's All Quiet on the Western Front, showing the German side of the conflict, becoming a powerful statement of war by the generation that fought it. Interviews include Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., King Vidor, Blanche Sweet and Lillian Gish. # \\"Hazard of the Game\\"Silent films are often remembered for slapstick gags and dangerous stunts. Stuntmen took anonymous credit for very little pay and could not reveal their involvement. Stuntmen Yakima Canutt, Harvey Parry, Bob Rose and Paul Malvern tell hair-raising and humorous stories, and reveal the secrets behind many famous stunts. # \\"Swanson and Valentino\\"Two of the great romantic legends of the silent screen are profiled. Rudolph Valentino's on-screen persona is remarkably different from his real personal life, as recounted by his brother, Alberto, and Gloria Swanson recalls her meteoric riseand fallwith remarkable candor. # \\"Autocrats\\"Two of Hollywood's greatest directors, Cecil B. DeMille and Erich von Stroheim. One worked with the Hollywood system, the other against it. DeMille's pictures, lavish in detail and cost, made his studio a fortune, while Von Stroheim's similar ways, albeit to excess in footage and expense, resulted in films that were often either excessively cut by the studios or never released, leading to his being fired on several occasions. Interviews include Agnes DeMille, Gloria Swanson, Allen Dwan, and Henry King. # \\"ComedyA Serious Business\\"Hollywood learned very early how to make people laugh. Comedy was king, and battling for the throne were stars like Harold Lloyd, Buster Keaton, Harry Langdon and Charlie Chaplin. In a purely visual medium, their comedy was a work of genius. Interviews include Hal Roach, Sr., Jackie Coogan, Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd. # \\"Out West\\"'The Old West' was still in existence in the silent days. Old cowboys and outlaws relived their youth, and got paid for doing it, by working in films. The 'western craze' really begins with stars like William S. Hart, Harry Carey and Tom Mix. Interviews include Yakima Canutt, Colonel Tim McCoy, Harvey Parry and John Wayne. # \\"The Man with the Megaphone\\"Silent film directors were flamboyant pioneers, making up their technique as they went along. Filming 'indoor' sets on open outdoor lots and combating the elements, communicating with actors in spite of overwhelming distraction and deafening noise, directors (male and female) fashion great films out of chaos and confusion. Interviews include Bessie Love, Janet Gaynor and King Vidor. # \\"Trick of the Light\\"Skilled cameramen had the ability to turn an actress into a screen goddess, and were valuable assets to studios and stars. With the aid of art directors, they achieved some of the most amazing and dangerous sequences captured on film, pioneering photography effects used through the remainder of the 20th century. Interviews include William Wyler and Lillian Gish. # \\"Star Treatment\\"Producers discovered the effect of 'star power' on their box office bottom line. Creating Hollywood stars becomes its own industry, resulting in the Hollywood Star System, from which came Clara Bow, Greta Garbo, and John Gilbert, successor to Rudolph Valentino as \\"The Great Lover\\". But as easily as they made them, studios could break them. Interviews include Charles \\"Buddy\\" Rogers, Louise Brooks and King Vidor. # \\"End of an Era\\"Silent films had universal appeal, simply by replacing intertitles and dialogue cards for the foreign markets. Sound film was experimented with in many forms since the 1890s, but did not become commercially successful until The Jazz Singer in 1927. Hollywood movie making was transformed and ultimately shattered, taking the careers of many silent film stars, directors and producers with it, victims of the emerging technology.

He was the drummer for the influential punk rock band the Ramones for the first four years of the band's existence and was the longest-surviving original member of the Ramones. Background Tam√°s Erd√©lyi was born on January 29, 1949, in Budapest, Hungary. His Jewish parents were professional photographers, who survived the Holocaust by being hidden by neighbors. Many of his relatives were killed by the Nazis. The family left Hungary during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. In 1957 he emigrated with his family to the United States. Initially settling in the South Bronx, the family moved up to the middle-class suburb of Forest Hills in Queens, New York. Verona Estates in Forest Hills was the place where Tam√°s grew up and later described as 'Home sweet home'.\\"Ramones - End Of The Century - Extras 4\\" He changed his name to Thomas Erdelyi. In high school, Tommy played guitar in a mid-1960s, four-piece garage band, the Tangerine Puppets, with a schoolmate and guitarist, John Cummings, the future Johnny Ramone. After leaving school at 18, he started working as an assistant engineer at the Record Plant studio, where he worked on the production of the 1970 Jimi Hendrix album Band of Gypsys. Producer and drummer for the Ramones When the Ramones first came together, with Johnny Ramone on guitar, Dee Dee Ramone on bass and Joey Ramone on drums, Erdelyi was supposed to be the manager, but, even though he never played drums before, was drafted as the band's drummer when Joey became the lead singer, after realizing that he couldn't keep up with the Ramones' increasingly fast tempos. \\"Tommy Ramone, who was managing us, finally had to sit down behind the drums, because nobody else wanted to,\\" Dee Dee later recalled. He remained as drummer from 1974 to 1978, playing on and co- producing their first three albums, Ramones, Leave Home, and Rocket to Russia, as well as the live album It's Alive. His final show as a Ramones drummer was at Johnny Blitz benefit event at CBGB's in New York, USA on May 4, 1978. In a 2007, interview with the BBC, Ramone said the band had been heavily influenced by 1970s, glam-rock band the New York Dolls, by singer-songwriter Lou Reed and by pop-art figure Andy Warhol. He said, \\"The scene that developed at CBGB wasn't [for] a teenage or garage band; there was an intellectual element and that's the way it was for The Ramones.\\" Behind the scenes with the Ramones Tommy Ramone was replaced on drums in 1978 by Marky Ramone, but handled band management and co-production for their fourth album, Road to Ruin; he later returned as producer for their eighth album, 1984's Too Tough to Die. Tommy Ramone wrote \\"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend\\" and the majority of \\"Blitzkrieg Bop\\" while bassist Dee Dee suggested the title. He and Ed Stasium played all the guitar solos on the albums he produced, as Johnny Ramone largely preferred playing rhythm guitar. In the 1980s he produced the Replacements album Tim, as well as Redd Kross's Neurotica. He returned to the producer's chair in 2002, overseeing the reunion of former Ramones C.J. and Marky for their recording of Jed Davis' Joey Ramone tribute \\"The Bowery Electric\\". On October 8, 2004, on what would have been Johnny Ramone's 56th birthday, he played as a Ramone once again, when he joined C.J. Ramone, Daniel Rey, and Clem Burke (also known as Elvis Ramone) in the \\"Ramones Beat Down on Cancer\\" concert. In October 2007 in an interview to promote It's Alive 1974‚Äì1996 a two-DVD set of the band's best televised live performances he paid tribute to his deceased bandmates: Ramone and Claudia Tienan (formerly of underground band the Simplistics) performed as a bluegrass-based folk duo called Uncle Monk. Ramone stated: \\"There are a lot of similarities between punk and old-time music. Both are home-brewed music as opposed to schooled, and both have an earthy energy. And anybody can pick up an instrument and start playing.\\" He joined songwriter Chris Castle, Garth Hudson, Larry Campbell and the Womack Family Band in July 2011 at Levon Helm Studios for Castle's album Last Bird Home. Illness and death Ramone died at his home in Ridgewood, Queens, New York on July 11, 2014, aged 65. He had received hospice care following unsuccessful treatment for bile duct cancer. In The Independent, Loulla-Mae Eleftheriou-Smith wrote that \\"before Tommy left the line-up, the Ramones had already become one of the most influential punk bands of the day, playing at the infamous CBGB's in the Bowery area of New York and touring for each album incessantly.\\" In response to Ramone's death, the band's official Twitter account had been tweeting previous quotes from band members, including his own 1976 comment that New York was the \\"perfect place to grow up neurotic\\". He added: \\"One of the reasons that the Ramones were so unique and original was that they were four original, unique people.\\" Writing in Variety, Cristopher Morris said: \\"Tommy's driving, high-energy drum work was the turbine that powered the leather-clad foursome's loud, antic sound.\\" Discography =Discography with the Ramones= * Ramones (1976) * Leave Home (1977) * Rocket to Russia (1977) * Road to Ruin (1978, producer only) * It's Alive (1977) * Too Tough to Die (1984, producer only) * Brain Drain (1989, producer only) * NYC 1978 (2003) =Discography with Uncle Monk= * Uncle Monk (2006) References =Bibliography=  =Notes= External links Uncle Monk website *Uncle Monk on Myspace 1949 births 2014 deaths American people of Hungarian-Jewish descent American punk rock drummers American male drummers Record producers from New York (state) Deaths from cancer in New York (state) Deaths from cholangiocarcinoma Hungarian emigrants to the United States Hungarian rock musicians Hungarian record producers Hungarian Jews Jewish American musicians Musicians from Budapest Musicians from New York City People from Forest Hills, Queens Tommy Jews in punk rock 20th-century American drummers 21st-century American drummers Burials at New Montefiore Cemetery People from Ridgewood, Queens ","title":"Tommy Ramone"},{"id":"990788","text":"The Greater Britain Movement was a British far right political group formed by John Tyndall in 1964 after he split from Colin Jordan's National Socialist Movement. The name of the group was derived from The Greater Britain, a 1932 book by Oswald Mosley.David Boothroyd, Politico's Guide to the History of British Political Parties, London: Politico's, 2001, p. 93 Formation While the roots of the split between Tyndall and Jordan was considered to be the marriage of Jordan to Fran√ßoise Dior ‚Äì who had previously been romantically involved with TyndallS. Taylor The National Front in English Politics, London: Macmillan, 1982, p. 15 ‚Äì Tyndall himself stated that the rift between the two men was a consequence of an ideological clash resulting from his rejection of Jordan's endorsement of straight Nazism and his own preference for a more 'British' solution.Taylor, The National Front in English Politics, p. 55 Before the split, and during their spell as members of the British National Party, Jordan had faced the same criticism from John Bean with Tyndall increasingly echoing Bean's view. This division led to a showdown at the April 1964 NSM conference when Tyndall demanded that Jordan give control of the movement to him. On 11 May 1964, Jordan moved to expel Tyndall from the NSM, although the following day Tyndall claimed that, having taken control of the group, he had expelled Jordan. However, soon afterwards Tyndall gave up his NSM membership and, along with most of the staff from the party's London headquarters, left the group. In August 1964, he announced the formation of the Greater Britain Movement and began publishing its magazine, Spearhead, a name taken from the NSM's largely failed attempt to set up a paramilitary wing. The GBM also gained the support of James McIntyre's National Student Front which until that time had been loyal to the NSM.Peter Barberis, John McHugh, Mike Tyldesley, Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations: Parties, Groups and Movements of the 20th Century, Continuum International Publishing Group, 2000, p. 190 Tyndall would later claim that he had formed the GBM merely as a stopgap to keep his supporters united, stating that he felt, even in 1964, that their future lay in working more closely with other similar groups.John Tyndall, The Eleventh Hour, Welling: Albion Press, undated, p. 192 Policies The first issue of Spearhead stated that the new movement would adhere \\"without fear and without compromise to every tenet of the national socialist creed\\" albeit \\"in a manner more in touch with British affairs and much more in touch with British interests and aims\\".Ray Hill & Andrew Bell, The Other Face of Terror, London: Grafton Books, 1988, p. 82 However whilst leader of the GBM, Tyndall wrote his Six Principles of British Nationalism in which he broke from the Nazism of Jordan, and called for a parliamentary strategy towards a government that would be corporatist, racialist, and based on the principle of leadership. This state would be ratified by regular referendums, although liberal democracy would be brought to an end.J. Tyndall, The Six Principles of British Nationalism, 1966 The new movement also advocated laws banning marriage between people of different races and the use of medical procedures to prevent those with \\"hereditary defects\\" from having children: Tyndall's ideas have been characterised as an attempt to construct a specifically British national socialism, rather than following Jordan's route of simply transplanting the German version.Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism, and the Politics of Identity, New York University Press, 2003, p. 38 Such was Tyndall's desire to forge a specifically British form of Nazism that he was characterised by Jordan and other critics as a \\"John Bull in jackboots\\".Cyprian Blamires, World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1, ABC-CLIO, 2006, p. 289 Development The GBM did not contest any elections and rather became known for publicity stunts and criminal acts. An example of the sort of action they were fond of was provided soon after the group was formed when Tyndall's deputy Martin Webster attempted to assault President of Kenya Jomo Kenyatta, a headline-grabbing stunt that also saw Webster serve a short spell in prison.Boothroyd, The Politico's Guide to the History of British Political Parties, p. 94 Tyndall had also been present at the incident, which took place as Kenyatta exited a hotel in London at which he was staying, and Tyndall was given a ¬£25 fine for the abuse he shouted into a megaphone during the attack. The GBM's policy of provocative street activity meant that it faced frequent opposition. A meeting in the East End of London on 4 October 1964 was attacked by opponents, as was another in Dalston the following October whilst earlier, in August 1965, Tyndall had been shot at five times whilst in the group's headquarters in Norwood. The group's main benefactor was an antiques dealer named Gordon Brown and in late 1966 he gave Tyndall the funds to purchase a small shop in Tulse Hill which Tyndall converted into the Nationalist Centre. The centre welcomed regular visitors from the BNP and League of Empire Loyalists although, according to the BNP's Rodney Legg, some of the older LEL members were appalled by the Nazi ephemera and loaded guns on display. In January 1965, Tyndall had attempted to make the GBM the leading lights in the World Union of National Socialists but after getting in touch with the American Nazi leader George Lincoln Rockwell Tyndall was dismayed to find that Jordan was still recognised as leader of the body and that the NSM was still the British chapter. The incident helped to push the GBM further away from the neo-Nazi fringe and towards the other groups on the far-right. Removed from the Nazi option and with the GBM individually failing to make much headway or attract much support, Tyndall authorised GBM members to support the campaigns of both the BNP and the LEL as well as the Patriotic Party in March 1965. According to John Bean Tyndall wrote personally to Oswald Mosley, A.K. Chesterton and Bean around the same time suggesting that as their four movements had been co-operating unofficially on activities in support of Rhodesia a more formal alliance between the GBM, Union Movement, LEL and BNP should be agreed upon. Nothing came of these overtures however.John Bean, Many Shades of Black - Inside Britain's Far Right, London: New Millennium, 1999, p. 180 Meanwhile, Tyndall had not abandoned his attempts to build links internationally and instead forged an alliance between the GBM and the National States Rights Party, a far-right group in the United States that had grown critical of Rockwell and the American Nazi Party.Richard Thurlow, Fascism in Britain A History, 1918-1985, Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1987, p. 269 The GBM, however, remained one of the more extreme groups on the far right as was evidenced in 1966 when a number of members were imprisoned for an arson attack on a synagogue, with Tyndall later also jailed for possession of a firearm. The incidents derailed the GBM's drive for unity somewhat as LEL leader A.K. Chesterton was averse to such actions, preferring to maintain a legalist approach. As a result, the GBM undertook negotiations with the BNP and the Racial Preservation Society in early 1966 aimed at effecting a closer union but these came to nothing, with the RPS in particular turning the request down flat. Towards merger During the summer of 1966 Tyndall and his movement grew close to A.K. Chesterton and the two soon agreed that the hefty defeat inflicted on the Conservative Party in the 1966 general election had opened up space for a new far right party with Tyndall arguing in Spearhead that there was \\"no longer any great political force representative of patriotic right-wing principles\\". Chesterton was impressed by the organisational skills demonstrated by Tyndall in the GBM, although he was also suspicious of his Nazi past whilst Andrew Fountaine was opposed to any GBM membership, and so they did not invite GBM to join the National Front in 1967. The first issue of Combat, the organ of the British National Party, to be published following the formation of the National Front (which had absorbed the British National Party) specifically stated that the GBM \\"would not be coming into the new movement and ... their past utterances on anti-Semitism and pro-Nazism would certainly not be a part of National Front policy\\".Michael Billig, A Social Psychological View of the National Front, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1978, p. 134 However, before the year was out Chesterton relented and allowed the GBM to join the NF 'on probation', leading to the GBM ceasing to exist.N. Copsey, Contemporary British Fascism, Palgrave Macmillan, 2004, p. 15 In June of that year Tyndall told the GBM membership, which at that point stood at 138, that the movement was disbanded and that they should join the National Front as individuals.

C. McNeile or the pseudonym Sapper, was a British soldier and author. Drawing on his experiences in the trenches during the First World War, he started writing short stories and getting them published in the Daily Mail. As serving officers in the British Army were not permitted to publish under their own names, he was given the pen name \\"Sapper\\" by Lord Northcliffe, the owner of the Daily Mail; the nickname was based on that of his corps, the Royal Engineers. After the war McNeile left the army and continued writing, although he changed from war stories to thrillers. In 1920 he published Bulldog Drummond, whose eponymous hero became his best-known creation. The character was based on McNeile himself, on his friend Gerard Fairlie and on English gentlemen generally. McNeile wrote ten Bulldog Drummond novels, as well as three plays and a screenplay. McNeile interspersed his Drummond work with other novels and story collections that included two characters who appeared as protagonists in their own works, Jim Maitland and Ronald Standish. He was one of the most successful British popular authors of the inter-war period before his death in 1937 from throat cancer, which has been attributed to damage sustained from a gas attack in the war. McNeile's stories are either directly about the war, or contain people whose lives have been shaped by it. His thrillers are a continuation of his war stories, with upper class Englishmen defending England from foreigners plotting against it. Although he was seen at the time as \\"simply an upstanding Tory who spoke for many of his countrymen\\", after the Second World War his work was criticised as having fascist overtones, while also displaying the xenophobia and anti-semitism apparent in some other writers of the period. Biography =Early life= Cheltenham College, where McNeile enjoyed playing sports, but did not excel at them McNeile was born in Bodmin, Cornwall. He was the son of Malcolm McNeile, a captain in the Royal Navy who at the time was governor of the naval prison at Bodmin, and Christiana Mary (n√©e Sloggett). The McNeile family had ancestral roots from both Belfast and Scotland, and counted a general in the British Indian Army among their members. McNeile did not like either of his given names but preferred to be called Cyril, although he was always known by his friends as Mac. After attending a prep school in Eastbourne, he was further educated at Cheltenham College. On leaving the college, he joined the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, from which he was commissioned into the Royal Engineers as a second lieutenant in July 1907. He underwent further training at the Royal School of Military Engineering before a short posting to Aldershot Garrison. He received promotion to lieutenant in June 1910 and was posted to Canterbury, serving three years with the 3rd Field Troop, until January 1914, when he was posted to Malta. In 1914 McNeile was promoted to the rank of captain. He was still in Malta when the war broke out and was ordered to France in October 1914; he travelled via England and married Violet Evelyn Baird Douglas on 31 October 1914. She was the daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Arthur Sholto Baird Douglas of the Cameron Highlanders. =First World War service= On 2 November 1914 McNeile travelled to France as part of the British Expeditionary Force. Few details are known about McNeile's wartime service, as his records were destroyed by incendiary bombs during the Second World War. He spent time with a number of Royal Engineer units on the Western Front, including 1st Field Squadron RE, 15th Field Company RE and RE elements of the 33rd Division. US cover of No Man's Land, published in 1917 McNeile's first known published story, Reminiscences of Sergeant Michael Cassidy, was serialised on page four of the Daily Mail from 13 January 1915. As serving officers in the British Army were not permitted to publish under their own names except during their half-pay sabbaticals, many would write under a pseudonym; Lord Northcliffe, the owner of the Daily Mail, gave McNeile the pen name \\"Sapper\\", as the Royal Engineers were commonly known as the Sappers. McNeile later confided that he had started writing through \\"sheer boredom\\". Some of his stories appeared on page four of the Daily Mail over the following months. Northcliffe was impressed by his writing and attempted, but failed, to have him released from the army to work as a war correspondent. By the end of 1915, he had written two collections of short stories, The Lieutenant and Others and Sergeant Michael Cassidy, R.E., both of which were published by Hodder & Stoughton. Although many of the stories had already appeared in the Daily Mail, between 1916 and 1918 Sergeant Michael Cassidy, R.E. sold 135,000 copies and The Lieutenant and Others sold 139,000 copies. By the end of the war he had published three more collections, Men, Women, and Guns (1916), No Man's Land (1917) and The Human Touch (1918). In 1916 he wrote a series of articles titled The Making of an Officer, which appeared under the initials C. N., in five issues of The Times between 8 and 14 June 1916. The articles were aimed at young and new officers to explain their duties to them; these were collected together and published by Hodder & Stoughton later in 1916. During his time with the Royal Engineers, McNeile saw action at the First and Second Battles of Ypres‚Äîhe was gassed at the second battle‚Äîand the Battle of the Somme. In 1916 he was awarded the Military Cross and was mentioned in dispatches; in November that year he was gazetted to acting major. From 1 April to 5 October 1918, he commanded a battalion of the Middlesex Regiment and was promoted to acting lieutenant-colonel; the scholar Lawrence Treadwell observes that \\"for an engineer to command an infantry regiment was ... a rarity\\". 18th Battalion, Middlesex Regiment under McNeile saw action for the remainder of his command, and were involved in fighting during the Hundred Days Offensive in the St. Quentin-Cambrai sector in September 1918; during the year, he was again mentioned in dispatches. On 2 October 1918 he broke his ankle and was briefly hospitalised, which forced him to relinquish his command of the regiment on 4 October. He was on convalescent leave when the war ended in November 1918. During the course of the war, he had spent a total of 32 months in France, and had probably been gassed more than once. His literary output from 1915 to 1918 accounted for more than 80 collected and uncollected stories. His brother‚Äîalso in the Royal Engineers‚Äîhad been killed earlier in the war. =Post-war years= McNeile had a quiet life after the war; his biographer Jonathon Green notes that \\"as in the novels of fellow best-selling writers such as P. G. Wodehouse or Agatha Christie, it is the hero who lives the exciting life\\". Although he was an \\"unremittingly hearty man\\", he suffered from delicate health following the war. He had a loud voice and a louder laugh, and \\"liked to enliven clubs and restaurants with the sight and sound of military good fellowship\\"; his friend and collaborator Gerard Fairlie described him as \\"not everybody's cup of tea\\", and commented that \\"he was loud in every possible way‚Äîin his voice, in his laugh, in his clothes, in the unconscious swagger with which he always motivated himself, in his whole approach to life\\". McNeile and his wife had two sons. On 13 June 1919 McNeile retired onto the reserve officer list and was confirmed in the rank of major. The same year he also published a short-story collection, Mufti, in which he introduced a type of character as \\"the Breed\\", a class of Englishman who was patriotic, loyal and \\"physically and morally intrepid\\". Although well received by the critics, the book failed commercially and, by the end of 1922, had only sold 16,700 copies from its first print run of 20,000; the unsold copies were pulped and the novel went out of print later that year. In 1920 McNeile published Bull-Dog Drummond, whose eponymous hero‚Äîa member of \\"the Breed\\"‚Äîbecame his most famous creation. He had first written Drummond as a detective for a short story in The Strand Magazine, but the character was not successful and was changed for the novel, which was a thriller. Captain Hugh \\"Bulldog\\" Drummond DSO, MC was described in the novel's sub-title as \\"a demobilised officer who found peace dull\\" after service during the First World War with the fictional Loamshire Regiment. Drummond went on to appear in ten full-length novels by McNeile and a further seven by his friend Gerard Fairlie. The character was an amalgam of Fairlie, himself, and his idea of an English gentleman. Drummond also had roots in the literary characters Sherlock Holmes, Sexton Blake, Richard Hannay and The Scarlet Pimpernel. Drummond was characterised as large, very strong, physically unattractive and an \\"apparently brainless hunk of a man\\", who was also a gentleman with a private income; he could also be construed as \\"a brutalized ex-officer whose thirst for excitement is also an attempt to reenact the war\\". The character was later described by Cecil Day-Lewis, author of rival gentleman detective Nigel Strangeways, as an \\"unspeakable public school bully\\". Drummond's main adversary across four novels is Carl Peterson, a master criminal with no national allegiance, who is often accompanied by his wife, Irma. Irma is described by Jonathon Green as \\"the slinky epitome of a twenties 'vamp, and by Lawrence Treadwell as dark, sexy and from an oriental background, \\"a true femme fatale\\". After Carl Peterson's death in The Final Count, Irma swears revenge on Drummond and kidnaps his wife‚Äîwhom he had met in Bull-Dog Drummond‚Äîwith the intent of killing him in the ensuing chase. Irma Peterson appears in six of McNeile's books, and in a further five by Fairlie. Lobby card for US screenings of the 1922 film, Bulldog Drummond McNeile adapted Bulldog Drummond for the stage. It was produced at Wyndham's Theatre during the 1921‚Äì22 season, with Gerald du Maurier playing the title role; it ran for 428 performances. The play also ran in New York during the same season, with A. E. Matthews as Drummond. Later in 1922 McNeile resigned his reserve commission with the rank of lieutenant-colonel, and moved as a tax exile to Territet, Montreux, Switzerland, with his wife; the Swiss countryside was later described in a number of his stories. The following year McNeile introduced the character of Jim Maitland, a \\"footloose sahib of the period\\". Maitland was the protagonist of the 1923 novel Jim Maitland; he later appeared in a second novel in 1931, The Island of Terror. Around the time McNeile killed off the Carl Peterson character in The Final Count (1926), he also introduced the character Ronald Standish, who first appeared in \\"The Saving Clause\\" (1927) and \\"Tiny Carteret\\" (1930) before becoming the protagonist in two collections of short stories, Ronald Standish (1933) and Ask for Ronald Standish (1936). The character also appeared in the final three Drummond novels, Knock-Out (1933), Bull-Dog Drummond at Bay (1935) and Challenge (1937). Standish was a sportsman who played cricket for England and was a part-time consultant with the War Office. In 1929 McNeile edited a volume of short stories from O. Henry, The Best of O. Henry; the stories had served as models for him when he had started as a writer. The same year, the film Bulldog Drummond was released, starring Ronald Colman in the title role. Colman was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor at the 3rd Academy Awards ceremony. The film earned $750,000 at the box office, and McNeile received an estimated ¬£5,000 for the rights to his novel. The same year he wrote his second play‚ÄîThe Way Out‚Äîwhich was staged at the Comedy Theatre in January 1930. About a year later he and his wife returned to England, and settled near Pulborough, West Sussex. In 1935 McNeile, Fairlie, Sidney Gilliat and J.O.C. Orton collaborated on the screenplay Bulldog Jack, a \\"comedy thriller\\" with Jack Hulbert and Fay Wray, which was produced by Gaumont British. =Death and legacy= In 1937 McNeile was working with Fairlie on the play Bulldog Drummond Hits Out when he was diagnosed with terminal throat cancer. He came to an agreement with Fairlie for the play to continue after his death and for Fairlie to continue writing the Drummond stories. McNeile died on 14 August 1937 at his home in West Chiltington, West Sussex. Although most sources identify throat cancer as the cause of death, Treadwell also suggests that it may have been lung cancer. It was \\"traceable to his war service\\", and attributed to a gas attack. His funeral, with full military honours, was conducted at Woking crematorium. At his death his estate was valued at over ¬£26,000. Bulldog Drummond Hits Out was finished by Fairlie and had a short tour of Brighton, Birmingham, Manchester and Edinburgh, before opening in London at the Savoy Theatre on 21 December 1937. The story was later turned into a novel by Fairlie, with the title Bulldog Drummond on Dartmoor. Fairlie continued to write Drummond novels, seven in total. Drummond, McNeile's chief literary legacy, became a model for other literary heroes created in the 1940s and '50s. W. E. Johns used McNeile's work as a model for his character Biggles, while Ian Fleming admitted that James Bond was \\"Sapper from the waist up and Mickey Spillane below\\". Sydney Horler's popular character \\"Tiger\\" Standish was also modelled on Drummond. Writing McNeile's works fall into two distinct phases. Those works published between 1915 and 1918 are his war stories, and relate directly to his experiences during the First World War, while the later works are largely thrillers. His war stories were marketed by the Daily Mail and Hodder & Stoughton as a soldier's eyewitness accounts. When he started writing thrillers, Hodder & Stoughton advertised McNeile as a \\"light and entertaining\\" writer, and began publishing his works in the \\"Yellow Jacket\\" series. Magazine editors competed vigorously for Sapper's stories and paid extravagant prices for them. Gerald Fairlie, his close friend and collaborator, has put it on record that Sapper was the highest-paid short story writer of his time. =Style and technique= O. Henry was a literary model for McNeile McNeile's early works, the war stories published before 1919, are either \\"plot-driven adventure narrative[s]\\", such as the short stories \\"The Song of the Bayonet\\" and \\"Private Meyrick, Company Idiot\\", or \\"atmospheric vignette[s]\\", such as \\"The Land of Topsy Turvy\\" and \\"The Human Touch\\". McNeile would write about 1,000 words every morning in a routine that was rarely disturbed; he took no breaks while writing and would do no re-writes until he completed his work. The academic Jessica Meyer has criticised his style as having \\"little aesthetic merit, being stylised, clich√©d and often repetitive\\"; Richard Usborne agreed, adding that the female characters were \\"cardboard\\" and that McNeile was \\"wonderfully forgetful\\" about characters dead in one book and alive in the next. In the Bulldog Drummond stories, Watson identifies the central character as \\"a melodramatic creation, workable only within a setting of melodrama\\". The academic Joan DelFattore points out that while the characters and plots cannot be considered to be unique, credible or well-rounded, his books \\"make no claim to literary excellence\\", and are instead, \\"good, solid thrillers\\". Usborne agrees, and believes that McNeile wrote good stories that were flawed but well told. Meyer classifies the non-war stories as middlebrow, with \\"sentimental plotlines and presenting a social message about the condition of England\\". His early novels, particularly Bull-Dog Drummond and The Black Gang, were structured loosely and in some ways as short stories. The academic Hans Bertens blamed this on McNeile's lack of experience and self-confidence, noting that in his later novels, McNeile \\"mastered the tricks of his trade\\". DelFattore outlines the use of double adjectives to reinforce feelings towards enemies in both his war stories and thrillers, such as \\"filthy, murdering Boche\\", and \\"stinking, cowardly Bolshevik\\". She and the scholar Lise Jaillant also comment on the dehumanisation of the enemy, comparing them to animals and vermin. Watson noted the frequency of the use of the word \\"devil\\"‚Äîand variations‚Äîwhen discussing antagonists. =Major themes= First World War The major theme running throughout McNeile's works is the First World War. Between 1915 and 1918 he had five collections of short stories published about the war, while his post-war fiction can be seen as an extension of those stories, as \\"both treat the war as a trial with manhood at stake\\". His war stories were considered by contemporary audiences as anti-sentimental, realistic depictions of the trenches, and as a \\"celebration of the qualities of the Old Contemptibles\\". McNeile's view, as expressed through his writing, was that war was a purposeful activity for the nation and for individuals, even if that purpose was later wasted: a \\"valuable chance at national renewal that had been squandered\\". The positive effects of war on the individual were outlined by McNeile in The Making of an Officer, his series of articles in The Times, in which he wrote about \\"the qualities of leadership and selflessness essential to 'inspire' subalterns\\", a theme he returned to in his war stories‚Äîparticularly The Lieutenant and Others and Sergeant Michael Cassidy, R.E‚Äîand then afterwards in his fictional stories, notably the Bulldog Drummond works. McNeile's fictional work‚Äîparticularly his Drummond series of books‚Äîshows characters who have served in the war and have been affected by it; Jaillant comments that Drummond's war-time experience \\"has shaped his social identity, his skills, and even his physical appearance\\". The Drummond character has been \\"brutalized by war\\", which accounts for his physical approach when dealing with Peterson and others. England Bulldog Drummond McNeile provided Drummond with a \\"flamboyantly aggressive patriotism\\" towards England, which Drummond defends physically against those who challenge its stability or morality. Hans Bertens argued that the patriotism demonstrated by Drummond was closer to nationalistic pride and a paranoia about threats directed at the upper middle classes, of which Drummond was a member. Drummond's nickname‚ÄîBulldog‚Äîis symbolic of England, and he and his English gentlemen friends‚Äî\\"the Breed\\"‚Äîfight the conspiracy of foreigners threatening England's stability. McNeile's thriller stories do not often pit Englishman against Englishman as the main characters; most of the foreigners in his books are the villains. Sport Running throughout McNeile's books is the metaphor of warfare as sport. His war stories include descriptions of fights between individuals that carry a sporting motif: in Sergeant Michael Cassidy, R.E., he writes, \\"To bag a man with a gun is one thing; there is sport‚Äîthere is an element of one against one, like when the quality goes big game shooting. But to bag twenty men by a mine has not the same feeling at all, even if they are Germans\\". The motif was continued into the Drummond novels. McNeile reinforces this theme through his use of the language of public school sports, or of boxing, poker or hunting. The titles of his books also use sporting imagery: The Third Round, The Final Count, Knock-Out and Challenge. =Reception= McNeile's war story collections sold well; nearly 50,000 copies of his first book, Sergeant Michael Cassidy, R.E., were purchased in its first year, and nearly 58,000 copies the following year. His thrillers were also popular, with Bulldog Drummond selling 396,302 copies between 1920 and 1939, exceeding the 100,000-copies benchmark for \\"best- sellers\\". At his peak in the 1920s, he was the highest paid short story writer in the world, and it was estimated that in the last five years of his life he was earning around ¬£10,000 a year; the Daily Mirror estimated that during his writing career he had earned ¬£85,000. Bulldog Drummond, based on McNeile's play of the same name McNeile's war stories were seen by reviewers as honest portrayals of the war, with British and American reviewers in the mainstream press praising his realism and avoidance of sentimentality in dealing with his subject matter. Reviewing Men, Women, and Guns for The Times Literary Supplement, Francis Henry Gribble wrote that \\"Sapper has been successful in previous volumes of war stories ... When the time comes for picking out the writers whose war fiction has permanent value, his claim to be included in the list will call for serious examination.\\" The reviewer of Sergeant Michael Cassidy, R.E. for The Atlanta Constitution reminded its readers that McNeile \\"has been called the foremost literary genius of the British army.\\" Jaillant observes that once McNeile moved from war stories to thrillers, with the concurrent re-positioning of advertising and marketing by Hodder & Stoughton, the reviewers also treated him differently, and presented him as \\"a writer of thrillers, without any pretension to literary seriousness\\". When reviewing Bulldog Drummond Strikes Back for The New York Times, the critic observed that \\"if you like a good knock-down-and-drag-out yarn with excitement and violence on nearly every page, you can't go wrong on Bulldog Drummond\\"; for the novel Bulldog Drummond at Bay, the reviewer considered that \\"as a piece of fictional melodrama, the book is first rate\\". In the British market, The Times Literary Supplement also characterised him as a mass-market thriller writer, which contrasted with its consideration of his earlier works. Controversy From the 1950s on, McNeile's work came to be viewed in the light of events of the Second World War, and journalists such as Richard Usborne highlighted aspects of the stories which he considered were \\"carrying the F√ºhrer- principle\\". DelFattore agrees, and considers that the second Bulldog Drummond novel‚ÄîThe Black Gang (1922)‚Äîis when the fascist element was introduced. Jaillant notes that the accusations of fascism only came about after the Second World War, while the academic Ion Trewin considers that through the Drummond stories, McNeile was seen at the time as \\"simply an upstanding Tory who spoke for many of his countrymen\\". Throughout the Drummond stories, much of the language used by McNeile's characters relating to ethnic minorities or Jews is considered by DelFattore to be \\"intensely conservative by modern standards\\"; Green observes that while the characters of other contemporary writers, such as Agatha Christie, \\"exhibit the inevitable xenophobia and anti- semitism of the period, McNeile's go far beyond the 'polite' norms\\". J. D. Bourn considers his language to be \\"rather distasteful\\", while the academic Michael Denning observed that \\"Drummond is a bundle of chauvinisms, hating Jews, Germans, and most other foreigners\\".

Plot summary Recently discharged from service in World War II and surviving on a government pension for unspecified battle wounds, Hazel Motes returns to his family home in Tennessee to find it abandoned. Leaving behind a note claiming a chifforobe as his private property, Motes boards a train for Taulkinham. The grandson of a traveling preacher, Motes grew up struggling with doubts regarding salvation and original sin; following his experiences at war, Motes has become an avowed atheist and intends to spread a gospel of antireligion. Despite his aversion to all trappings of Christianity, he constantly contemplates theological issues and finds himself compelled to purchase a suit and hat that cause others to mistake him for a minister. In Taulkinham, Motes initially finds an address in a bathroom stall and seeks out Leora Watts, a prostitute. He walks into her house, sits on her bed, and places his hand on her shoe without speaking to her first. He befriends Enoch Emery, a profane, manic, 18-year-old zookeeper forced to come to the city after his abusive father kicked him out of their house. Emery introduces Motes to the concept of \\"wise blood,\\" an idea that he has innate, worldly knowledge of what direction to take in life, and requires no spiritual or emotional guidance. Together, Emery and Motes witness a blind preacher and his teenage daughter crash a street vendor's potato peeler demonstration to advertise for their ministry. The preacher introduces himself as Asa Hawks and his daughter as Sabbath Lily Hawks; Motes finds himself drawn to the pair, which Hawks attributes to a repressed desire for religious salvation. Angry, Motes begins shouting blasphemies to the crowd and declares that he will found his own anti-God street preaching ministry. Motes' declarations are lost on everyone except for Emery, who becomes infatuated with the idea. After Leora destroys his hat for her own amusement, Motes moves into the boarding house where Asa and Sabbath Lily live. Motes becomes fixated on the 15-year-old Sabbath Lily and begins spending time with her. Asa has Sabbath Lily give Motes a newspaper clipping reporting Asa's announcement that he will blind himself with quicklime at a revival in order to detach himself from worldly pursuits. Initially intending to seduce Sabbath Lily in order to corrupt her spiritual purity, Motes discovers that she is in fact interested in him. Now skeptical of her and of her father's entire ministry, Motes slips into Hawks' room one night and finds him without his sunglasses on, with perfectly intact eyes: Hawks had faltered when he had attempted to blind himself because his faith was not strong enough, and ultimately left the ministry to become a con artist. His secret found out, Asa flees town, leaving Sabbath Lily to fend for herself. The 15-year-old moves in with Motes, and he begins to more aggressively pursue his ministry, purchasing a dilapidated car to use as a mobile pulpit. Meanwhile, Emery, believing that Motes' church needs a worldly \\"prophet,\\" breaks into a museum attached to the zoo where he works and steals a mummified dwarf, which he begins keeping under his sink. He ultimately presents it to Sabbath Lily to give to Motes on his behalf; when Sabbath Lily appears to Motes cradling it in her arms in a parody of the Madonna and Child, Motes experiences a violent revulsion to the image and destroys the mummy, throwing its remnants out the window. Inspired by Motes' fledgling street ministry, local con artist Hoover Shoats renames himself Onnie Jay Holy and forms his own ministry, the \\"Holy Church of Christ Without Christ,\\" which he encourages the disenfranchised to join for a donation of $1. The absurdity amuses passersby and they begin to join as a joke. This angers Motes, who wants to legitimately and freely spread his message of antireligion. Despite Motes' protests, Holy moves to the next level in promoting his ministry, hiring a homeless, alcoholic man to dress up like Motes and act as his \\"Prophet.\\" During a rainstorm, Emery seeks refuge under a theater marquee, and learns that as a promotion, a gorilla will be brought to the theater to promote a new jungle movie. An excited Emery stands in line to shake the gorilla's hand, but is startled to find that the gorilla is actually a man in a costume who, unprovoked, tells Emery to \\"go to hell.\\" The incident causes Emery's \\"wise blood\\" to give him some inarticulated revelation, and he seeks out a program of the \\"gorilla's\\" future appearances. That night, Emery stalks the man to another theater, stabs him with a sharpened umbrella handle, and steals his costume. Enoch takes the costume out to the woods, where he strips naked and buries his clothes in a shallow \\"grave\\" before dressing up as the gorilla. Satisfied with his new appearance, he comes out of the woods and attempts to greet a couple on a date by shaking their hand. Emery is disappointed when they flee in terror, and finds himself alone on a rock overlooking Taulkinham. Back in town, Motes angrily watches as Holy begins to grow rich off of his new ministry. One night he follows Holy's \\"prophet\\" as he drives home (in a car resembling Motes's), which he runs off the road; when the man exits the car, the stronger, more forceful Motes threatens him and orders him to strip. The man begins to comply, but Motes is overcome by a sudden rage and repeatedly runs the man over. Exiting the car to ensure he is dead, Motes is startled when the dying man begins confessing his sins to Motes. The next day, Motes is pulled over by a strange policeman with unnaturally blue eyes, who claims to be citing him for driving without a license. He orders Motes to drive to a nearby cliff, orders him out of the car, then, remarking that someone without a license doesn't need a car, pushes it off the cliff. The incident, coupled with the false prophet's death, causes Motes to become sullen and withdrawn. Motes purchases a tin bucket and sack of quicklime and returns to the boarding house. Completing the action that Hawks couldn't finish, he blinds himself with the quicklime. During an extended period of living as an ascetic at the boarding house, he begins walking around with barbed wire wrapped around his torso and sharp rocks and pebbles in his shoes, and after paying for his room and board, he throws away any remaining money from his military pension. Believing that Motes has gone insane, the landlady, Mrs. Flood, hatches a plot to marry him, collect on his pension, and have him committed to an insane asylum. In attempting to seduce Motes, Mrs. Flood instead falls in love with him. After she suggests to Motes that they marry and she care for him, Motes wanders off into a thunderstorm. Motes is found three days later, lying in a ditch and suffering from exposure. Angry at being asked to return what they believe is a mentally-ill indigent, one of the cops who find Motes strikes him in the head with his baton while loading Motes into a police car, exacerbating Motes' rapidly deteriorating condition. Motes dies in the police car on his way back to the boarding house. When the dead Motes is presented to Mrs. Flood, she mistakenly thinks he is still alive. She has him placed in bed and cares for his lifeless corpse, telling him he can live with her for as long as he likes, free of charge. Looking into his empty eye sockets, Mrs. Flood thinks she sees a light twinkling inside them. Literary context Wise Blood began with four separate stories published in Mademoiselle, Sewanee Review, and Partisan Review in 1948 and 1949. Flannery O'Connor then published it as a complete novel in 1952, and Signet advertised it as \\"A Searching Novel of Sin and Redemption.\\" Themes In the introduction to the 10th anniversary publication of Wise Blood, O'Connor states that the book is about freedom, free will, life and death, and the inevitability of belief. Themes of redemption, racism, sexism, and isolation also run through the novel. Adaptations A film was made of Wise Blood in 1979, directed by John Huston, and starring Brad Dourif as Hazel Motes and John Huston himself as the evangelist grandfather. Sabbath Lily was played by Amy Wright. Shot mostly in Macon, Georgia, it is a fairly literal filming of the novel. An immersive opera and gallery installation, WISE BLOOD , libretto adapted from the novel by Anthony Gatto, was commissioned by Walker Art Center and The Soap Factory (Minneapolis, Minnesota USA) in May and June 2015. From the Soap Factory website: \\"Visual artist Chris Larson and composer Anthony Gatto join forces to bring the darkly humorous world of Flannery O'Connor's WISE BLOOD to life. Set in the post-industrial beauty of a 130-year-old factory space turned art gallery, this immersive opera takes the audience on a journey alongside the eccentric and always captivating characters of this story. The audience is brought directly into, around and through large scale installation pieces, kinetic sculptures and projections. WISE BLOOD features an incredibly diverse cast of performers. The musicians of the Adam Meckler orchestra, Youngblood Brass Band, provide the musical core to this Southern Gothic Tale.\\"http://www.soapfactory.org/exhibit.php?content_id=684 References External links  * New Georgia Encyclopedia * Grotesque Relations: Modernist Domestic Fiction and the US Welfare State 1952 American novels American novels adapted into films Harcourt (publisher) books Modernist novels Novels by Flannery O'Connor Catholic novels Southern Gothic novels Southern United States in fiction 1952 debut novels ","title":"Wise Blood"},{"id":"990797","text":"Matusadona National Park is a national park in northern Zimbabwe situated on the southern shore of Lake Kariba. The park takes its name from the local Matuzviadonha Hills. History Matusadona was proclaimed a non-hunting area on 7 November 1958 before being declared as a Game Reserve in 1963, and then in 1975 it became a National Park, under the Parks & Wildlife Act of Rhodesia. Matusadona National Park covers of flat plains and rugged mountains protecting a diverse flora and fauna. Its area encompasses a combination of pristine and rugged wilderness, which before the Kariba Dam was built and Lake Kariba created, was very inaccessible. The creation of the lake caused profound ecological changes. In particular, the availability of grazing on the lakeshore has contributed to an increase in the populations of large mammals large mammal in the park, especially those of elephant and Cape buffalo. The species of grass growing on the shoreline is Panicum repens which grows as long as the lake levels fluctuate bringing nutrients to the shore. This source of grazing has allowed populations of large grazers such as Cape buffalo, waterbuck, common zebra, and impala to thrive, attracting the associated predators. Matusadona National Park is an Intensive Protection Zone (IPZ) and home to several relocated rhinoceros. Ecology and management Matusadona National Park includes three distinct ecological areas. The first is Lake Kariba and its shoreline grasslands, the second is the floor of the Zambezi Valley, with its thick jesse, Combretum celastroides, thickets and mopane woodland, and; third, the Escarpment area of Julbernardia and Brachystegia woodlands. The woodlands do not have much grass but provide habitat for browsers, most notably the black rhinoceros. Elephants can be found throughout the Park, seeking shade under the canopy of jesse during the heat of the day. From the floor of the Zambezi valley the escarpment rises some and is extremely rugged. Elephant browsing and fire depredations have, in recent years, caused the once substantial woodlands to decrease allowing grassland to develop. This led to the park managers deciding that it was necessary to take control measures to reduce the elephant population and to carry out early burning programmes in the upper escarpment, to reduce the risk of later, hotter fires from causing serious damage to the trees. These programmes have been effective as demonstrated by regrowth apparent in the Escarpment area. Within a area there was +100 lions feeding on a bounty of Cape buffalo. The buffalo began to disappear after losing vital grazing areas to a rise in the level of Lake Kariba upon which the park is set on. This in turn saw the lions begin to decline. By 2004 a study estimated a mere 28 lions remained in the area but no research was available on their viability and/or any other threats the population may be facing. The population is still remaining at a low density and is therefore susceptible to a variety of environmental and human induced pressures. Other mammals found include leopard, warthog, greater kudu and bushbuck. =African Parks= In November 2019 management of Matusadona National Park was assumed by African Parks, in partnership with Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority, because of the deteriorated condition of the park due to rampant poaching.https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/matusadonha-national-park- conservation Facilities The following campsites are within the Matusadona National Park Tashinga Camp, Sanyati Camp and Changachirere Camp, as well as undeveloped bush camps at Jenje and Kanjedza for up to a maximum of 10 persons per camp. There are also what are termed exclusive campsites at Ume, Muuyu, Mbalabala, Maronga, and Kautsiga. Access There is a small, landing strip is available at Tashinga Camp which can take small aircraft. Many visitors access the park by boat either from Bumi Hills or Kariba town. It has relatively poor accessibility by road and an extremely harsh internal network of roads keep the crowds and traffic low. The roads are closed in the rainy season.

The main characters are Robert Lomax, a young British artist living in Hong Kong, and Suzie Wong, the title character, a Chinese woman who works as a prostitute. The novel has been adapted into a play and spawned two unofficial sequels, a film, and a ballet. Plot Robert Lomax is a young Englishman who, after completing his National Service, goes to work on a plantation in British Malaya. During his time in Malaya, Lomax decides to pursue a new career as an artist for a year. Lomax visits Hong Kong in search of inspiration for his paintings. He checks into the Nam Kok Hotel, not realising at first that it is a brothel catering mainly to British and American sailors. However, this only makes the hotel more charming in Lomax's eyes, and a better source of subject matter for his paintings. Lomax quickly befriends most of the hotel's bargirls, but is fascinated by the archetypal \\"hooker with a heart of gold\\", Suzie Wong. Wong previously introduced herself to him as Wong Mee- ling, a rich virgin whose father owns four houses and more cars than she can count, and who later pretends not to recognise him at the hotel. Lomax had originally decided that he would not have sex with any of the bargirls at the hotel because he lacks the funds to pay for their services. However, it soon emerges that Suzie Wong is interested in him not as a customer but as a serious love interest. Although Wong becomes the kept woman of two other men, and Robert Lomax briefly becomes attracted to a young British nurse, Lomax and Wong are eventually united and the novel ends happily with them marrying.  Development  Mason received inspiration to create the novel when he stayed at the Luk Kwok Hotel in 1956 and observed the prostitution services offered there.  Film, TV and theatrical adaptations  The novel was adapted into a stage play in 1958 by Paul Osborn, directed by Joshua Logan, produced by David Merrick, and starred William Shatner and France Nuyen. Tsai Chin played the title role in the West End 1959 production. The story was later adapted into the 1960 film largely based on the earlier play, directed by Richard Quine and starring William Holden, Nancy Kwan, Sylvia Syms, and Michael Wilding. Ray Stark was the Executive Producer. Originally France Nuyen was to repeat the role, but she fell ill and had to be replaced by Nancy Kwan. In March 2006, the Hong Kong Ballet premiered a dance adaptation by Stephen Jefferies, entitled Suzie Wong. In 2010, scenes from Stephen Jefferies' ballet were used by director Brian Jamieson in the film biography To Whom It May Concern: Ka Shen's Journey, to draw parallels between the screen character of Suzie Wong and the life of actress Nancy Kwan.  Sequels  In 2008, Sebastian Gerard wrote an unauthorised sequel to the novel, For Goodness Sake: the Afterlife of Suzie Wong. The book is set in 1998 Hong Kong, 47 years after the events in Mason's book. Gerard's novel explores the experience of Dr. Marco Podesta, a Vietnam War veteran who is in Hong Kong for research. The book is Gerard's interpretation of what might have happened after the ending of the film, which was slightly more ambiguous than the ending in Mason's novel. Gerard's novel speculates that there might have been a real Robert and Suzie who were the inspiration for the story, and that only through them could we know if such an improbable romance might have endured. There is also an unofficial modern interpretation of the World of Suzie Wong by Leon Pang, written in 2010, titled Suzie. One of the characters in the book takes the name of Suzie Wong in an attempt to latch on to the fame of the original character. The novel explores 60 years of changes in Hong Kong, and themes include poverty, the rise of China, employment instability in the world in 2008, outsourcing, and the failings of capitalism.  Locations  The Luk Kwok Hotel in 1933, facing Victoria Harbour. The Nam Kok Hotel featured in the story is based on the Luk Kwok Hotel () on Gloucester Road in Wan Chai, where Mason stayed, although the building is now more modern, the site having been redeveloped in the 1980s. Also, unlike the hotel in the book, the modern hotel is not a brothel, but is one of many small smart hotels on Hong Kong Island. Reception The novel received good reviews during its release.

It is also called a moving mean (MM)Hydrologic Variability of the Cosumnes River Floodplain (Booth et al., San Francisco Estuary and Watershed Science, Volume 4, Issue 2, 2006) or rolling mean and is a type of finite impulse response filter. Variations include: simple, and cumulative, or weighted forms (described below). Given a series of numbers and a fixed subset size, the first element of the moving average is obtained by taking the average of the initial fixed subset of the number series. Then the subset is modified by \\"shifting forward\\"; that is, excluding the first number of the series and including the next value in the subset. A moving average is commonly used with time series data to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer- term trends or cycles. The threshold between short-term and long-term depends on the application, and the parameters of the moving average will be set accordingly. For example, it is often used in technical analysis of financial data, like stock prices, returns or trading volumes. It is also used in economics to examine gross domestic product, employment or other macroeconomic time series. Mathematically, a moving average is a type of convolution and so it can be viewed as an example of a low-pass filter used in signal processing. When used with non-time series data, a moving average filters higher frequency components without any specific connection to time, although typically some kind of ordering is implied. Viewed simplistically it can be regarded as smoothing the data. Simple moving average thumb In financial applications a simple moving average (SMA) is the unweighted mean of the previous n data. However, in science and engineering, the mean is normally taken from an equal number of data on either side of a central value. This ensures that variations in the mean are aligned with the variations in the data rather than being shifted in time. An example of a simple equally weighted running mean for a n-day sample of closing price is the mean of the previous n days' closing prices. If those prices are p_M, p_{M-1}, \\\\dots, p_{M-(n-1)} then the formula is : \\\\begin{align} \\\\overline{p}_\\\\text{SM} &= \\\\frac{p_M + p_{M-1} + \\\\cdots + p_{M-(n-1)}}{n} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} p_{M-i}. \\\\end{align} When calculating successive values, a new value comes into the sum, and the oldest value drops out, meaning that a full summation each time is unnecessary for this simple case: : \\\\overline{p}_\\\\text{SM} = \\\\overline{p}_{\\\\text{SM},\\\\text{prev}} + \\\\frac{1}{n} (p_M - p_{M-n}). The period selected depends on the type of movement of interest, such as short, intermediate, or long-term. In financial terms, moving-average levels can be interpreted as support in a falling market or resistance in a rising market. If the data used are not centered around the mean, a simple moving average lags behind the latest datum point by half the sample width. An SMA can also be disproportionately influenced by old datum points dropping out or new data coming in. One characteristic of the SMA is that if the data have a periodic fluctuation, then applying an SMA of that period will eliminate that variation (the average always containing one complete cycle). But a perfectly regular cycle is rarely encountered.Statistical Analysis, Ya-lun Chou, Holt International, 1975, , section 17.9. For a number of applications, it is advantageous to avoid the shifting induced by using only \\"past\\" data. Hence a central moving average can be computed, using data equally spaced on either side of the point in the series where the mean is calculated.The derivation and properties of the simple central moving average are given in full at Savitzky‚ÄìGolay filter. This requires using an odd number of datum points in the sample window. A major drawback of the SMA is that it lets through a significant amount of the signal shorter than the window length. Worse, it actually inverts it. This can lead to unexpected artifacts, such as peaks in the smoothed result appearing where there were troughs in the data. It also leads to the result being less smooth than expected, since some of the higher frequencies are not properly removed. Cumulative moving average In a cumulative moving average (CMA), the data arrive in an ordered datum stream, and the user would like to get the average of all of the data up until the current datum point. For example, an investor may want the average price of all of the stock transactions for a particular stock up until the current time. As each new transaction occurs, the average price at the time of the transaction can be calculated for all of the transactions up to that point using the cumulative average, typically an equally weighted average of the sequence of n values x_1. \\\\ldots, x_n up to the current time: :\\\\textit{CMA}_n = {{x_1 + \\\\cdots + x_n} \\\\over n}\\\\,. The brute-force method to calculate this would be to store all of the data and calculate the sum and divide by the number of datum points every time a new datum point arrived. However, it is possible to simply update cumulative average as a new value, x_{n+1} becomes available, using the formula :\\\\textit{CMA}_{n+1} = {{x_{n+1} + n \\\\cdot \\\\textit{CMA}_n} \\\\over {n+1}}. Thus the current cumulative average for a new datum point is equal to the previous cumulative average, times n, plus the latest datum point, all divided by the number of points received so far, n+1. When all of the datum points arrive (), then the cumulative average will equal the final average. It is also possible to store a running total of the datum point as well as the number of points and dividing the total by the number of datum points to get the CMA each time a new datum point arrives. The derivation of the cumulative average formula is straightforward. Using :x_1 + \\\\cdots + x_n = n \\\\cdot \\\\textit{CMA}_n and similarly for , it is seen that : \\\\begin{align} x_{n+1} & = (x_1 + \\\\cdots + x_{n+1}) - (x_1 + \\\\cdots + x_n) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] \\\\end{align} Solving this equation for \\\\textit{CMA}_{n+1} results in : \\\\begin{align} \\\\textit{CMA}_{n+1} & = {x_{n+1} + n \\\\cdot \\\\textit{CMA}_n \\\\over {n+1}} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] & = {x_{n+1} + (n + 1 - 1) \\\\cdot \\\\textit{CMA}_n \\\\over {n+1}} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] & = {(n + 1) \\\\cdot \\\\textit{CMA}_n + x_{n+1} - \\\\textit{CMA}_n \\\\over {n+1}} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] & = {\\\\textit{CMA}_n} + {{x_{n+1} - \\\\textit{CMA}_n} \\\\over {n+1}} \\\\end{align} Weighted moving average A weighted average is an average that has multiplying factors to give different weights to data at different positions in the sample window. Mathematically, the weighted moving average is the convolution of the datum points with a fixed weighting function. One application is removing pixelisation from a digital graphical image. In technical analysis of financial data, a weighted moving average (WMA) has the specific meaning of weights that decrease in arithmetical progression. In an n-day WMA the latest day has weight n, the second latest n ‚àí 1, etc., down to one. :\\\\text{WMA}_{M} = { n p_{M} + (n-1) p_{M-1} + \\\\cdots + 2 p_{(M-n+2)} + p_{(M-n+1)} \\\\over n + (n-1) + \\\\cdots + 2 + 1} WMA weights n = 15 The denominator is a triangle number equal to \\\\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}. In the more general case the denominator will always be the sum of the individual weights. When calculating the WMA across successive values, the difference between the numerators of WMAM+1 and WMAM is npM+1 ‚àí pM ‚àí ‚ãÖ‚ãÖ‚ãÖ ‚àí pM‚àín+1. If we denote the sum pM + ‚ãÖ‚ãÖ‚ãÖ + pM‚àín+1 by TotalM, then :\\\\begin{align} \\\\text{Total}_{M+1} &= \\\\text{Total}_M + p_{M+1} - p_{M-n+1} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[3pt] \\\\text{Numerator}_{M+1} &= \\\\text{Numerator}_M + n p_{M+1} - \\\\text{Total}_M \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[3pt] \\\\text{WMA}_{M+1} &= { \\\\text{Numerator}_{M+1} \\\\over n + (n-1) + \\\\cdots + 2 + 1} \\\\end{align} The graph at the right shows how the weights decrease, from highest weight for the most recent datum points, down to zero. It can be compared to the weights in the exponential moving average which follows. Exponential moving average EMA weights N = 15 An exponential moving average (EMA), also known as an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA), is a first-order infinite impulse response filter that applies weighting factors which decrease exponentially. The weighting for each older datum decreases exponentially, never reaching zero. The graph at right shows an example of the weight decrease. The EMA for a series Y may be calculated recursively: : S_t = \\\\begin{cases} Y_1, & t = 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\alpha Y_t + (1 - \\\\alpha) \\\\cdot S_{t-1}, & t > 1 \\\\end{cases} Where: * The coefficient Œ± represents the degree of weighting decrease, a constant smoothing factor between 0 and 1. A higher Œ± discounts older observations faster. * Yt is the value at a time period t. * St is the value of the EMA at any time period t. S1 may be initialized in a number of different ways, most commonly by setting S1 to Y1 as shown above, though other techniques exist, such as setting S1 to an average of the first 4 or 5 observations. The importance of the S1 initialisations effect on the resultant moving average depends on Œ±; smaller Œ± values make the choice of S1 relatively more important than larger Œ± values, since a higher Œ± discounts older observations faster. Whatever is done for S1 it assumes something about values prior to the available data and is necessarily in error. In view of this, the early results should be regarded as unreliable until the iterations have had time to converge. This is sometimes called a 'spin-up' interval. One way to assess when it can be regarded as reliable is to consider the required accuracy of the result. For example, if 3% accuracy is required, initialising with Y1 and taking data after five time constants (defined above) will ensure that the calculation has converged to within 3% (only <3% of Y1 will remain in the result). Sometimes with very small alpha, this can mean little of the result is useful. This is analogous to the problem of using a convolution filter (such as a weighted average) with a very long window. This formulation is according to Hunter (1986).NIST/SEMATECH e-Handbook of Statistical Methods: Single Exponential Smoothing at the National Institute of Standards and Technology By repeated application of this formula for different times, we can eventually write St as a weighted sum of the datum points Yt, as: : \\\\begin{align} S_{t}=\\\\alpha &\\\\left[Y_{t}+(1-\\\\alpha )Y_{t-1}+(1-\\\\alpha )^{2}Y_{t-2}+\\\\cdots \\\\right.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt]&\\\\left.\\\\cdots +(1-\\\\alpha )^{k}Y_{t-k}\\\\right]+(1-\\\\alpha )^{k+1}S_{t-(k+1)} \\\\end{align} for any suitable k ‚àà {0, 1, 2, ...} The weight of the general datum point Y_{t-i} is \\\\alpha\\\\left(1 - \\\\alpha\\\\right)^{i} . This formula can also be expressed in technical analysis terms as follows, showing how the EMA steps towards the latest datum point, but only by a proportion of the difference (each time): :\\\\text{EMA}_\\\\text{today} = \\\\text{EMA}_\\\\text{yesterday} + \\\\alpha \\\\left[\\\\text{price}_\\\\text{today} - \\\\text{EMA}_\\\\text{yesterday}\\\\right] Expanding out \\\\text{EMA}_\\\\text{yesterday} each time results in the following power series, showing how the weighting factor on each datum point p1, p2, etc., decreases exponentially: :\\\\text{EMA}_\\\\text{today} = { \\\\alpha \\\\left[p_1 + (1 - \\\\alpha) p_2 + (1 - \\\\alpha)^2 p_3 + (1 - \\\\alpha)^3 p_4 + \\\\cdots \\\\right] } where * p_1 is \\\\text{price}_\\\\text{today} * p_2 is \\\\text{price}_\\\\text{yesterday} * and so on : \\\\text{EMA}_\\\\text{today} = \\\\frac{p_1 + (1 - \\\\alpha) p_2 + (1 - \\\\alpha)^2 p_3 + (1 - \\\\alpha)^3 p_4 + \\\\cdots}{1 + (1 - \\\\alpha) + (1 - \\\\alpha)^2 + (1 - \\\\alpha)^3 + \\\\cdots}, since 1/\\\\alpha = 1 + (1 - \\\\alpha) + (1 - \\\\alpha)^2 + \\\\cdots. It can also be calculated recursively without introducing the error when initializing the first estimate (n starts from 1): : \\\\text{EMA}_n = \\\\frac{\\\\text{WeightedSum}_n}{\\\\text{WeightedCount}_n} : \\\\text{WeightedSum}_n = p_n + (1 - \\\\alpha)\\\\text{WeightedSum}_{n-1} : \\\\text{WeightedCount}_n = 1 + (1 - \\\\alpha)\\\\text{WeightedCount}_{n-1} = \\\\frac{1 - (1 - \\\\alpha)^n}{1 - (1 - \\\\alpha)} : Assume \\\\text{WeightedSum}_0 = \\\\text{WeightedCount}_0 = 0 This is an infinite sum with decreasing terms. = Approximating the EMA with a limited number of terms = The question of how far back to go for an initial value depends, in the worst case, on the data. Large price values in old data will affect the total even if their weighting is very small. If prices have small variations then just the weighting can be considered. The power formula above gives a starting value for a particular day, after which the successive days formula shown first can be applied. The weight omitted by stopping after k terms is :\\\\alpha \\\\left[ (1 - \\\\alpha)^k + (1 - \\\\alpha)^{k+1} + (1 - \\\\alpha)^{k+2} + \\\\cdots \\\\right], which is :\\\\alpha (1 - \\\\alpha)^k \\\\left[1 + (1 - \\\\alpha) + (1 - \\\\alpha)^2 + \\\\cdots \\\\right], i.e. a fraction :\\\\begin{align} & \\\\frac{\\\\text{weight omitted by stopping after } k \\\\text{ terms}}{\\\\text{total weight}} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] = {} & \\\\frac{\\\\alpha \\\\left[ (1 - \\\\alpha)^k + (1 - \\\\alpha)^{k+1} + (1 - \\\\alpha)^{k+2} + \\\\cdots \\\\right] } {\\\\alpha \\\\left[ 1 + (1 - \\\\alpha) + (1 - \\\\alpha)^2 + \\\\cdots \\\\right]} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] = {} & \\\\frac{\\\\alpha (1 - \\\\alpha)^k \\\\frac 1 {1 - (1 - \\\\alpha)}}{ \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{1 - (1 - \\\\alpha)} } \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] = {} & (1 - \\\\alpha)^k \\\\end{align}The Maclaurin Series for 1 / (1-x) is 1 + x + x^2 + \\\\cdots out of the total weight. For example, to have 99.9% of the weight, set above ratio equal to 0.1% and solve for k: :k = {\\\\log(0.001) \\\\over \\\\log(1 - \\\\alpha)} to determine how many terms should be used. Since \\\\alpha \\\\to 0 as N \\\\to \\\\infty, we know \\\\log\\\\,(1-\\\\alpha) approaches -\\\\alpha as N increases .It means \\\\alpha \\\\to 0, and the Taylor series of \\\\log(1 - \\\\alpha) = -\\\\alpha - \\\\alpha^2/2 - \\\\cdots approaches -\\\\alpha. This gives: :k \\\\approx {\\\\log(0.001) \\\\over {- \\\\alpha}} When \\\\alpha is related to N via to \\\\alpha = {2 \\\\over N+1}, this simplifies to approximately,loge(0.001) / 2 = ‚àí3.45 :k \\\\approx 3.45(N + 1) \\\\, for this example (99.9% weight). =Relationship between SMA and EMA= Note that there is no \\"accepted\\" value that should be chosen for \\\\alpha , although there are some recommended values based on the application. A commonly used value for \\\\alpha is \\\\alpha = 2 / (N + 1) . This is because the weights of an SMA and EMA have the same \\"center of mass\\" when \\\\alpha_{\\\\mathrm{EMA}} = 2 / \\\\left(N_{\\\\mathrm{SMA}} + 1\\\\right) . The weights of an N-day SMA have a \\"center of mass\\" on the R^{\\\\mathrm{th}} day, where R = \\\\frac{N + 1}{2} (or R = \\\\left(N-1\\\\right) / 2, if we use zero- based indexing) For the remainder of this proof we will use one-based indexing. Now meanwhile, the weights of an EMA have center of mass R_{\\\\mathrm{EMA}} = \\\\alpha \\\\left[1 + 2(1-\\\\alpha) + 3(1-\\\\alpha)^2 + ... + k(1-\\\\alpha)^{k-1}\\\\right] That is, R_{\\\\mathrm{EMA}} = \\\\alpha \\\\sum_{k=1}^{\\\\infty} \\\\\\\\! \\\\, k\\\\left(1-\\\\alpha\\\\right)^{k-1} We also know the Maclaurin Series 1 / (1-x) = \\\\sum_{k=0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\\\\\! \\\\, x^k Taking derivatives of both sides with respect to x gives: (x-1)^{-2} = \\\\sum_{k=0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\\\\\! \\\\, k x^{k-1} or (x-1)^{-2} = 0 + \\\\sum_{k=1}^{\\\\infty} \\\\\\\\! \\\\, k x^{k-1} Substituting x = 1 - \\\\alpha, we get R_{\\\\mathrm{EMA}} = \\\\alpha \\\\left(\\\\alpha\\\\right)^{-2} or R_{\\\\mathrm{EMA}} = \\\\left(\\\\alpha\\\\right)^{-1} So the value of \\\\alpha that sets R_{\\\\mathrm{SMA}} = R_{\\\\mathrm{RMA}} is, in fact: \\\\frac{N_{\\\\mathrm{SMA}} + 1}{2} = \\\\left( \\\\alpha_{\\\\mathrm{EMA}} \\\\right)^{-1} or \\\\frac{2}{N_{\\\\mathrm{SMA}} + 1} = \\\\alpha_{\\\\mathrm{EMA}} And so 2 / \\\\left(N + 1\\\\right) is the value of \\\\alpha that creates an EMA whose weights have the same center of gravity as would the equivalent N-day SMA This is also why sometimes an EMA is referred to as an N-day EMA. Despite the name suggesting there are N periods, the terminology only specifies the Œ± factor. N is not a stopping point for the calculation in the way it is in an SMA or WMA. For sufficiently large N, the first N datum points in an EMA represent about 86% of the total weight in the calculation when \\\\alpha = 2 / (N + 1) : The sum of the weights of all the terms (i.e., infinite number of terms) in an exponential moving average is 1. The sum of the weights of N terms is 1 - (1 - \\\\alpha)^{N+1} . Both of these sums can be derived by using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. The weight omitted after N terms is given by subtracting this from 1, and you get 1 - \\\\left[1 - (1 - \\\\alpha)^{N+1}\\\\right] = (1 - \\\\alpha)^{N+1} (this is essentially the formula given previously for the weight omitted). We now substitute the commonly used value for \\\\alpha = 2 / (N + 1) in the formula for the weight of N terms. If you make this substitution, and you make use ofSee the following link for a proof. \\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\left( 1 + {a \\\\over n} \\\\right)^n = e^a , then you get :\\\\frac {\\\\alpha \\\\left[1 + (1 - \\\\alpha) + (1 - \\\\alpha)^2 + \\\\cdots + (1 - \\\\alpha)^N \\\\right]} {\\\\alpha \\\\left[1 + (1 - \\\\alpha) + (1 - \\\\alpha)^2 + \\\\cdots\\\\right])} = 1 - {\\\\left(1 - {2 \\\\over N + 1}\\\\right)}^{N+1}The denominator on the left-hand side should be unity, and the numerator will become the right-hand side (geometric series), \\\\alpha \\\\left[{1 - (1 - \\\\alpha)^{N+1} \\\\over 1 - (1 - \\\\alpha)}\\\\right]. :i.e. \\\\lim_{N \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\left[1 - {\\\\left(1 - {2 \\\\over N+1}\\\\right)}^{N+1} \\\\right] simplified,Because (1 + x/n)n tends to the limit ex for large n. tends to 1 - e^{-2} \\\\approx 0.8647. the 0.8647 approximation. Intuitively, what this is telling us is that the weight after N terms of an \`\` N -period\\" exponential moving average converges to 0.8647. The designation of \\\\alpha = 2 / \\\\left(N + 1\\\\right) is not a requirement. (For example, a similar proof could be used to just as easily determine that the EMA with the same half-life as an N-day SMA is \\\\alpha = 1 - 0.5^{1/(0.5N)}). In fact, 2/(N+1) is merely a common convention to form an intuitive understanding of the relationship between EMAs and SMAs, for industries where both are commonly used together on the same datasets. In reality, an EMA with any value of \\\\alpha can be used, and can be named either by stating the value of \\\\alpha, or with the more familiar N-day EMA terminology letting N =\\\\left( 2 / \\\\alpha \\\\right) - 1. =Exponentially weighted moving variance and standard deviation= In addition to the mean, we may also be interested in the variance and in the standard deviation to evaluate the statistical significance of a deviation from the mean. EWMVar can be computed easily along with the moving average. The starting values are \\\\text{EMA}_1 = x_1 and \\\\text{EMVar}_1 = 0, and we then compute the subsequent values using: \\\\begin{align} \\\\delta_i &= x_i - \\\\text{EMA}_{i-1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\text{EMA}_i &= \\\\text{EMA}_{i-1} + \\\\alpha \\\\cdot \\\\delta_i \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\text{EMVar}_i &= \\\\left(1-\\\\alpha\\\\right)\\\\cdot\\\\left(\\\\text{EMVar}_{i-1} + \\\\alpha \\\\cdot \\\\delta_i^2\\\\right) \\\\end{align} From this, the exponentially weighted moving standard deviation can be computed as \\\\text{EMSD}_i=\\\\sqrt{\\\\text{EMVar}_i}. We can then use the standard score to normalize data with respect to the moving average and variance. This algorithm is based on Welford's algorithm for computing the variance. =Modified moving average= A modified moving average (MMA), running moving average (RMA), or smoothed moving average (SMMA) is defined as: :\\\\overline{p}_{MM,\\\\text{today}} = \\\\frac{(N - 1) \\\\overline{p}_{MM,\\\\text{yesterday}} + p_{\\\\text{today}}}{N} In short, this is an exponential moving average, with \\\\alpha = 1/N. =Application to measuring computer performance= Some computer performance metrics, e.g. the average process queue length, or the average CPU utilization, use a form of exponential moving average. :S_n = \\\\alpha(t_n - t_{n-1}) Y_n + \\\\left[1 - \\\\alpha(t_n - t_{n-1})\\\\right] S_{n-1}. Here is defined as a function of time between two readings. An example of a coefficient giving bigger weight to the current reading, and smaller weight to the older readings is :\\\\alpha(t_n - t_{n-1}) = 1 - \\\\exp\\\\left({-\\\\frac{t_n - t_{n-1}}{W \\\\cdot 60}} \\\\right) where is the exponential function, time for readings tn is expressed in seconds, and is the period of time in minutes over which the reading is said to be averaged (the mean lifetime of each reading in the average). Given the above definition of , the moving average can be expressed as :S_n = \\\\left[1 - \\\\exp\\\\left(-{ {t_n - t_{n-1}} \\\\over {W \\\\cdot 60}}\\\\right)\\\\right] Y_n + \\\\exp\\\\left(-{{t_n - t_{n-1}} \\\\over {W \\\\cdot 60}}\\\\right) S_{n-1} For example, a 15-minute average L of a process queue length Q, measured every 5 seconds (time difference is 5 seconds), is computed as :\\\\begin{align} L_n &= \\\\left[1 - \\\\exp\\\\left({-\\\\frac{5}{15 \\\\cdot 60}}\\\\right)\\\\right] Q_n + e^{-\\\\frac{5}{15 \\\\cdot 60}} L_{n-1} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= \\\\left[1 - \\\\exp\\\\left({-\\\\frac{1}{180}}\\\\right)\\\\right] Q_n + e^{-\\\\frac{1}{180}} L_{n-1} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= Q_n + e^{-\\\\frac{1}{180}} \\\\left( L_{n-1} - Q_n \\\\right) \\\\end{align} Other weightings Other weighting systems are used occasionally ‚Äì for example, in share trading a volume weighting will weight each time period in proportion to its trading volume. A further weighting, used by actuaries, is Spencer's 15-Point Moving AverageSpencer's 15-Point Moving Average ‚Äî from Wolfram MathWorld (a central moving average). Its symmetric weight coefficients are [‚àí3, ‚àí6, ‚àí5, 3, 21, 46, 67, 74, 67, 46, 21, 3, ‚àí5, ‚àí6, ‚àí3], which factors as [1, 1, 1, 1]*[1, 1, 1, 1]*[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]*[‚àí3, 3, 4, 3, ‚àí3]/320 and leaves samples of any cubic polynomial unchanged.Rob J Hyndman. \\"Moving averages\\". 2009-11-08. Accessed 2020-08-20. Outside the world of finance, weighted running means have many forms and applications. Each weighting function or \\"kernel\\" has its own characteristics. In engineering and science the frequency and phase response of the filter is often of primary importance in understanding the desired and undesired distortions that a particular filter will apply to the data. A mean does not just \\"smooth\\" the data. A mean is a form of low-pass filter. The effects of the particular filter used should be understood in order to make an appropriate choice. On this point, the French version of this article discusses the spectral effects of 3 kinds of means (cumulative, exponential, Gaussian). Moving median From a statistical point of view, the moving average, when used to estimate the underlying trend in a time series, is susceptible to rare events such as rapid shocks or other anomalies. A more robust estimate of the trend is the simple moving median over n time points: :\\\\widetilde{p}_\\\\text{SM} = \\\\text{Median}( p_M, p_{M-1}, \\\\ldots, p_{M-n+1} ) where the median is found by, for example, sorting the values inside the brackets and finding the value in the middle. For larger values of n, the median can be efficiently computed by updating an indexable skiplist. Statistically, the moving average is optimal for recovering the underlying trend of the time series when the fluctuations about the trend are normally distributed. However, the normal distribution does not place high probability on very large deviations from the trend which explains why such deviations will have a disproportionately large effect on the trend estimate. It can be shown that if the fluctuations are instead assumed to be Laplace distributed, then the moving median is statistically optimal.G.R. Arce, \\"Nonlinear Signal Processing: A Statistical Approach\\", Wiley:New Jersey, USA, 2005. For a given variance, the Laplace distribution places higher probability on rare events than does the normal, which explains why the moving median tolerates shocks better than the moving mean. When the simple moving median above is central, the smoothing is identical to the median filter which has applications in, for example, image signal processing. Moving average regression model In a moving average regression model, a variable of interest is assumed to be a weighted moving average of unobserved independent error terms; the weights in the moving average are parameters to be estimated. Those two concepts are often confused due to their name, but while they share many similarities, they represent distinct methods and are used in very different contexts.

According to legend; at that time, the Imperial Palace was taken over by an evil demon, which caused the Emperor to fall ill with great anxiety and suffering. When the Imperial High Priests tried and failed in their efforts to destroy the demon and dispel the Imperial household of its influence, they were at a loss. Finally, an archer, Yorimasu Minamoto, was summoned to the Imperial Palace in the hopes of slaying the demon with his bow and arrow, ridding the palace of this plague.Kyudo.org With a steady hand and a virtuous heart, Yorimasu Minamoto vanquished the demon with the first arrow, and his bow was declared to be a Hama Yumi, an \\"Evil-Destroying Bow\\" (and the first arrow a Hama Ya an \\"Evil-Destroying Arrow\\"). Since then, Hama Yumi have been used in Buddhist and Shinto rituals of purification (i.e. Shihobarai--the Purification of the Four Directions). In Japan, it is universally believed that merely the twanging of its bowstring will frighten away ghosts, evil spirits and negative influences from the house. A miko will carry a Hama Yumi and a set of Hama Ya as part of their religious regalia, while back in Feudal Japan, they were used quite literally in defence of the shrine or temple. As a result, , decorative arrows, are sold even today at shrines as Engimono (good-luck charms); smaller replicas have been placed in shrines and people's homes. It is believed that even just one Hama-Ya which has been blessed by a Shinto Priest carries great spiritual power, will bring protection against the forces of evil, and for purification, and they are also believed to have the ability to attract vast good fortune. Hama Ya and Hama Yumi are often given as gifts to celebrate the first New Year of a male baby's life. Hama-yumi replicas are scale versions of the Sacred Japanese Bow, coated with Urushi, wrapped in fine Rattan and accented in Gold leaf. They are displayed in a stand, along with two arrows tipped with Yanone, (traditional warrior tips); one representing male and the other female, yin and yang (vermilion signifying male energy (Yang), and black representing female energy (Yin)).

The incident came in the midst of poor diplomatic relations between Mexico and the United States, and was related to the ongoing Mexican Revolution. Background The Tampico Affair was set off when nine American sailors were arrested by the Mexican government for entering off-limit areas in Tampico, Tamaulipas. The unarmed sailors were arrested when they entered a fuel loading station. The sailors were released, but the U.S. naval commander demanded an apology and a 21-gun salute. The apology was provided, but not the salute. In the end, the response from U.S. President Woodrow Wilson ordered the U.S. Navy to prepare for the occupation of the port of Veracruz. While awaiting authorization from the U.S. Congress to carry out such action, Wilson was alerted to a delivery of weapons for Victoriano Huerta, who had taken control of Mexico the previous year after a bloody coup d'√©tat (and was eventually deposed on July 15, 1914), due to arrive in the port on April 21 aboard the German-registered cargo steamer SS Ypiranga. As a result, Wilson issued an immediate order to seize the port's customs office and confiscate the weaponry. The weapons had actually been sourced by John Wesley De Kay, an American financier and businessman with large investments in Mexico, and a Russian arms dealer from Puebla, Leon Rasst, not the German government, as newspapers reported at the time.Heribert von Feilitzsch, Felix A. Sommerfeld: Spymaster in Mexico, 1908 to 1914, Henselstone Verlag, Amissville, VA 2012, pp. 351ff Huerta had usurped the presidency of Mexico with the assistance of the American ambassador Henry Lane Wilson during a coup d'√©tat in February 1913 known as la decena tr√°gica. The Wilson administration's answer to this was to declare Huerta a usurper of the legitimate government, to embargo arms shipments to Huerta, and to support the Constitutional Army of Venustiano Carranza. Part of the arms shipment to Mexico originated from the Remington Arms company in the United States. The arms and ammunition were to be shipped to Mexico via Odessa and Hamburg to skirt the American arms embargo. In Hamburg, De Kay added to the shipment. The landing of the arms was blocked at Veracruz, but they were discharged a few weeks later in Puerto Mexico, a port controlled by Huerta at the time. Initial landing American ships at Veracruz. On the morning of 21 April 1914, warships of the United States Atlantic Fleet under the command of Rear Admiral Frank Friday Fletcher, began preparations for the seizure of the Veracruz waterfront. Fletcher's orders were to \\"Seize custom house. Do not permit war supplies to be delivered to Huerta government or any other party.\\" At 11:12 hrs, consul William Canada watched from the roof of the American Consulate as the first boatload of Marines left the auxiliary vessel . Whaleboats carrying 502 Marines from the 2nd Advanced Base Regiment, 285 armed Navy sailors, known as \\"Bluejackets,\\" from the battleship and a provisional battalion composed of the Marine detachments from Florida and her sister ship also began landing operations. As planned earlier, American consul William W. Canada notified General Gustavo Maass that Americans were occupying the port and warned him to \\"cooperate with the naval forces in maintaining order.\\" Maass however, was not permitted by Mexico City to surrender the port. Maass ordered the Eighteenth Regiment, under the command of General Luis B. Becerril, to distribute rifles to the populace and to the prisoners in \\"La Galera\\" military prison, and then all to proceed to the dock area. Maass also ordered the Nineteenth Regiment, under the command of General Francisco A. Figueroa, to take up positions on Pier Number Four. Maass then radioed a dispatch to General Aurelio Blanquet, Minister of War in Mexico City, of the American invasion. Blanquet ordered Maass to not resist, but to retreat to Tejer√≠a. The landing party, under the command of William R. Rush reached Pier 4 at 11:20. A large crowd of Mexican and American citizens gathered to watch the spectacle. The American invaders, under the command of Marine Col. W.C. Neville, proceeded to their objectives without resistance. By 11:45, the rail terminal and cable station were occupied. Commodore encouraged cadets of the Veracruz Naval Academy to take up the defense of the port for themselves. Battle of Veracruz 3‚Ä≥/50 gun bombarding Veracruz Damaged entrance to a high school adjacent to the Veracruz Naval Academy Three Navy rifle companies were instructed to capture the customs house, post, and telegraph offices, while the Marines went for the railroad terminal, roundhouse, and yard, the cable office and the power plant.Jack Sweetman, ‚ÄúThe Landing at Veracruz: 1914‚Äù 1968, p67 Arms were distributed to the population, who were largely untrained in the use of Mausers and had trouble finding the correct ammunition. In short, the defense of the city by its populace was hindered by the lack of central organization and a lack of adequate supplies. The defense of the city also included the release of the prisoners held at the \\"La Galera\\" military prison, not those at San Juan de Ul√∫a (some of whom were political prisoners), who were later attended to by the U.S. Navy.A Diplomat's Wife in Mexico, by Edith O'Shaughnessy, 1916, Ch. XXIV Although most of the regular troops retreated with Maass to Tejer√≠a, the liberated prisoners under the command of Lt. Col. Manuel Contreras, and some civilians, opposed the Americans as they made their way to the custom house. At 11:57, the Mexicans fired upon the Americans as they reached the intersection of Independencia and Empar√°n. The navy signalman on top of the Terminal Hotel, Capt. Rush's headquarters, was the first American casualty, and by the end of the day, 4 Americans were dead and 20 wounded. The senior officers of the 1st Marine Brigade photographed at Veracruz in 1914: Front row, left to right: Lt. Col. Wendell C. Neville; Col. John A. Lejeune; Col. Littleton W. T. Waller, Commanding; and Maj. Smedley Butler. At 1:30 PM, the Ypiranga was intercepted, and detained, before it could off load its cargo of weapons and ammunition. On the night of April 21, Fletcher decided that he had no choice but to expand the initial operation to include the entire city, not just the waterfront. At 8:00 AM the next day, he gave orders to take control of the entire city. At 8:35 PM, Capt. C.T. Vogelsang's San Francisco entered the harbor next to the Prairie and off loaded a landing party. At 3 AM, Commander William A. Moffett's Chester offloaded 2 companies of marines and a company of seamen. These were followed by men from the Minnesota and Hancock of Admiral Charles J. Badger's Atlantic Fleet, bringing the total American men ashore to more than 3000. At 07:45 April 22, the advance began. The leathernecks adapted to street fighting, which was a novelty to them. The sailors were less adroit at this style of fighting. A regiment led by Navy Captain E. A. Anderson advanced on the Naval Academy in parade-ground formation, making his men easy targets for the partisans barricaded inside (the cadets had left Veracruz the night before, after suffering a few casualties ). This attack was initially repulsed; soon, the attack was renewed, with artillery support from three warships in the harbor, Prairie, , and , that pounded the academy with their long guns for a few minutes, silencing all resistance. U.S. troops enter Veracruz in April 1914 The city was secured by 11:00 AM, and by evening more than 6000 troops were ashore. That afternoon, the First Advanced Base Regiment, originally bound for Tampico, came ashore under the command of Colonel John A. Lejeune. A small naval aviation detachment arrived aboard on April 24th under the command of Henry Mustin. Two early aircraft assembled by Glenn Curtiss prior to formation of the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company conducted aerial reconnaissance around Veracruz. This was the first operational use of naval aircraft and the first time U.S. aviators of any service were the target of ground fire. A third provisional regiment of Marines, assembled at Philadelphia, arrived on May 1 under the command of Colonel Littleton W. T. Waller, who assumed overall command of the brigade, by that time numbering some 3,141 officers and men. By then, the sailors and Marines of the Fleet had returned to their ships and an Army brigade had landed. Marines and soldiers continued to garrison the city until the U.S. withdrawal on November 23, which occurred after Argentina, Brazil, and Chile (the three ABC powers, the most powerful and wealthy countries in South America) were able to settle the issues between the two nations at the Niagara Falls peace conference. On 26 April, Fletcher declared martial law, and started turning the occupation over to the American army under the command of General Frederick Funston. Aftermath Jos√© Azueta is considered a Mexican hero for his actions during the battle \\"Defensores de Veracruz en 1914\\" Memorial in Mexico City. This monument celebrates the Mexican defenders of Veracruz. U.S. Army Brigadier General Frederick Funston was placed in control of the administration of the port. Assigned to his staff as an intelligence officer was a young Captain Douglas MacArthur.William Manchester. American Caesar: Douglas MacArthur 1880‚Äì1964, Little, Brown and Company, 1978, pp. 73‚Äì76 While Huerta and Carranza officially objected to the occupation, neither was able to oppose it effectively, being more preoccupied by events of the Mexican Revolution. Huerta was eventually overthrown and Carranza's faction took power. The occupation, however, brought the two countries to the brink of war and worsened U.S.-Mexican relations for many years. The ABC Powers held the Niagara Falls peace conference in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada, on May 20 to avoid an all-out war over this incident. A plan was formed in June for the US troops to withdraw from Veracruz after General Huerta surrendered the reins of his government to a new regime and Mexico assured the United States that it would receive no indemnity for its losses in the recent chaotic events. Huerta soon afterwards left office and gave his government to Carranza. Carranza, who was still quite unhappy with US troops occupying Veracruz, rejected the rest of the agreement. In November 1914, after the Convention of Aguascalientes ended and Carranza failed to resolve his differences with revolutionary generals Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata, Carranza left office for a short period and handed control to Eulalio Guti√©rrez Ortiz. During this brief absence from power, however, Carranza still controlled Veracruz and Tamaulipas. After leaving Mexico City, Carranza fled to the state of Veracruz, made the city of Cordoba the capital of his regime and agreed to accept the rest of the terms of Niagara Falls peace plan. The US troops officially departed on November 23. Despite their previous spat, diplomatic ties between the US and the Carranza regime greatly extended, following the departure of US troops from Veracruz,. After the fighting ended, U.S. Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels ordered that fifty-six Medals of Honor be awarded to participants in this action, the most for any single action before or since. This amount was half as many as had been awarded for the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, and close to half the number that would be awarded during World War I and the Korean War. A critic claimed that the excess medals were awarded by lot.Gallery, p. 118 Major Smedley Butler, a recipient of one of the nine Medals of Honor awarded to Marines, later tried to return it, being incensed at this \\"unutterable foul perversion of Our Country's greatest gift\\" and claiming he had done nothing heroic. The Department of the Navy told him to not only keep it, but wear it. The controversy surrounding the Vera Cruz Medals of Honor led to stricter standards for the award of the Medal of Honor and the establishment of lower ranking medals to recognize a wider range of accomplishments. Mexico's Naval Lt. Azueta and a Naval Military School cadet, Cadet Midshipman Virgilio Uribe, who died during the fighting, are now part of the roll call of honor read by all branches of the Mexican Armed Forces in all military occasions, alongside the six Ni√±os H√©roes of the Military College (nowadays the Heroic Military Academy) who died in defense of the nation during the Battle of Chapultepec on September 13, 1847. As a result of the brave defense put up by the Naval School cadets and faculty, it has now become the Heroic Naval Military School of Mexico in their honor by virtue of a congressional resolution in 1949. Political consequences As an immediate reaction to the military invasion of Veracruz several anti-American revolts broke out in Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, and Uruguay.Michael Small (2009) The Forgotten Peace: Mediation at Niagara Falls, 1914, p. 35, University of Ottawa, Canada. US citizens were expelled from Mexican territory and they had to be accommodated in refugee campuses at New Orleans, Texas City, and San Diego.John Whiteclay Chambers & Fred Anderson (1999) The Oxford Companion to American Military History, p. 432, Oxford University Press, England. Even the British government was privately irritated, because they had previously agreed with Woodrow Wilson that the United States would not invade Mexico without prior warning. The military invasion of Veracruz was also a decisive factor in favor of keeping Mexico neutral in World War I.Lee Stacy (2002) Mexico and the United States, Volume 3, p. 869, Marshall Cavendish, USA.

The cliffs at this point rise 585 ft (178 m) above the New River. Located on the James River and Kanawha Turnpike (the road that served as an extension of the canal across what is now West Virginia), many early travelers on this road stopped to see the view of the river below. In modern times, the Midland Trail carries U.S. Route 60 through the same general route. Ample parking at the overlook in the state park provides tourists with free access to the views. The name Hawk's Nest derived from the many fish hawks which inhabited the massive cliffs at this point. When the railroad began blasting in the area between 1869 and 1873, the hawks left the site and never returned. The Chesapeake and Ohio Railway was completed through the area on January 29, 1873, and a ceremony was held at Hawk's Nest Station. A hydro-electric project nearby became known as the Hawk's Nest Incident. During construction of a three-mile- long tunnel by Union Carbide beginning in 1927, the tunnel was filled with silica dust. Workers were not given masks for protection, even though management wore such masks during the short times they visited for inspection. As a result, thousands of workers, mostly poor and African American, died from silicosis, sometimes as quickly as within a single year. In addition to the real-life tragedy of the Hawk's Nest Incident, an overlook in the state park called Lovers' Leap is the location of legendary stories of romantically inspired suicides by young lovers who cannot be together due to family and cultural obstacles. Hawks Nest State Park offers a nature museum, a nine-hole golf course, a 31-room lodge, jetboat rides and hiking.

This project is considered to be one of the worst industrial disasters in American history. Tunnel To generate electricity for a plant downstream at Alloy, Union Carbide's Kanawha and New River Power Company subsidiary decided to divert the New River to improve its power generation ability. Beginning in 1927, its contractor Rinehart & Dennis began construction of the tunnel carrying the river under Gauley Mountain. A dam was constructed immediately below Hawks Nest to divert most of the New River flow into the tunnel. It then re-enters the river near Gauley Bridge leaving a section known as \\"the Dries\\" in between. Silica During the construction of the tunnel, workers found the mineral silica and were asked to mine it for use in electroprocessing steel. Facing widespread unemployment during the Great Depression, about three thousand men, three-fourths of whom were Black, came to West Virginia to dig the tunnel. They worked ten- to fifteen-hour shifts, using drills and dynamite to mine the sandstone, which has a high silica content. The workers completed the project more than twice as fast as original projections. They were not given any masks or breathing equipment to use while mining, although management wore such equipment during inspection visits. They were denied breaks and even forced to work at gunpoint. As a result of the exposure to silica dust, many workers developed silicosis, a debilitating lung disease caused by the effects of silica dust in the lungs. A large number of the workers eventually died from silicosis, in some cases as quickly as within a year. There are no definitive statistics as to the death toll from the Hawks Nest disaster. According to a historical marker on site, there were 109 admitted deaths. A Congressional hearing placed the death toll at 476. Other sources range from 700 to over 1,000 deaths amongst the 3,000 workers. Many of the workers at the site were African-Americans from the southern United States who returned home or left the region after becoming sick, making it difficult to calculate an accurate total.

In many navies, a sub- lieutenant is a naval commissioned or subordinate officer, ranking below a lieutenant. In the Royal Navy (RN) the rank of sub-lieutenant is equivalent to the rank of lieutenant in the British Army and of flying officer in the Royal Air Force (RAF). In some armies, sub-lieutenant is the lowest officer rank. However, in Brazil, it is the highest non-commissioned rank, and in Spain, it is the second highest non-commissioned rank. The NATO rank code for the British Royal Navy rank is OF-1 (senior). History of naval rank In the British Royal Navy, a passed midshipman awaiting promotion often elected to become a master's mate, normally an experienced petty officer who assisted the sailing master. Though formally the rating did not lead to promotion to lieutenant, master's mates were paid more than any other rating and were the only ratings allowed to command any sort of vessel. A midshipman who became a master's mate got an increase in pay from ¬£1 13s 6d to ¬£3 16s per month, but initially reduced his chances at a commission. Over time, however, service as a master's mate became a normal part of the path to a commission. The situation caused some confusion during the last part of the 18th century, when two parallel roles‚Äîmaster's mates trying to become masters, and former midshipmen working toward a commission‚Äîheld the same title and responsibilities aboard ship. By the first years of the 19th century, the prefix \\"master's\\" was dropped for passed midshipmen, to distinguish them from master's mates in the navigator's branch. In 1824 two further grades were also introduced, consisting of master's assistants and second-class volunteers. These corresponded to midshipmen and first-class volunteers respectively in the executive line. From this point, passed midshipmen had the rating master's mate, abbreviated as mate, and prospective masters had the rating master's assistant. These changes helped eliminate the confusion caused by the mingling of midshipmen in the navigator's branch. In 1861 the rank of mate was renamed sub-lieutenant. Acting sub-lieutenant In 1955, the Royal Navy created the rank of acting sub-lieutenant, although it had existed intermittently in the world wars. Unlike their substantive counterparts, acting sub-lieutenants are subordinate officers, as they hold their ranks by order and not by commission. Upon passing Fleet Board, acting sub-lieutenants were confirmed as sub- lieutenants and issued commissions backdated to the date when they were appointed acting sub-lieutenants. The rank of acting sub-lieutenant was abolished in the Royal Navy around 1993 but remained in the Royal Naval Reserve until 2013; officers in both the RN and RNR now commission into the rank of Midshipman. The rank of Acting Sub-lieutenant remains in the Royal Navy only within the University Royal Naval Unit where Training Officers enter at this rank. Before its abolition, the rank of acting sub-lieutenant in the Royal Navy corresponded with, but was junior to, the ranks of lieutenant (Army) and flying officer (RAF). This can be seen in print versions of STANAG 2116 edition 5 (1992). Canadian Acting Sub-lieutenant's insignia In many Commonwealth navies (e.g. Canada and Australia), the rank of acting sub- lieutenant still exists as a commissioned rank equivalent to second lieutenant, while the rank of sub-lieutenant is equivalent to that of an army lieutenant. As the term \\"acting\\" is a designation, both acting and substantive ranks should be addressed as \\"sub-lieutenant\\"; the full designation including \\"acting\\" should be used in written documents, however. Indeed, when someone is addressed as \\"Acting sub-lieutenant\\", it can be seen as a way of patronising an individual in a derogatory manner due to the emphasis of their \\"acting\\" rank. The Royal New Zealand Navy follows the US precedent in titling its lowest commissioned officer ensign. In the Royal Thai Army, Army Reserve Force Students who complete grade 5 and their B.D. are promoted to the rank of acting second lieutenant (‡∏ß‡πà‡∏≤‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πà ‡∏£‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏¢‡∏ï‡∏£‡∏µ). Modern practice In the modern Royal Navy, all officer cadets now commission as midshipmen, regardless of whether they are a graduate or a school leaver. They are subsequently promoted to sub-lieutenant one year after entering Britannia Royal Naval College. Upper Yardsmen commission as Sub-Lieutenants assuming their seniority date is greater than 12 months. In the Royal Canadian Navy, all undergoing basic officer training join as naval cadets, but upon graduation, those who joined with a bachelor's degree receive an immediate promotion to acting sub- lieutenant, while those who do not retain their rank as naval cadet until such time as they finish more career-related training. Rank insignia = Armies = Brazilian Sub-Lieutenant insignia In France, a sub-lieutenant (sous- lieutenant) is the junior commissioned officer in the army or the air force. He wears a band in the colour of his corps (e.g. gold for infantry, silver for armoured cavalry, etc.). During the 18th century a rank of sous-lieutenant de vaisseau existed in the French Navy. It was the equivalent of the master's mate rank of the Royal Navy. It is now replaced by the rank of \\"first ensign\\" (enseigne de vaisseau de premi√®re classe). An Argentinian sub-lieutenant wears a single silver sun on each shoulder, Brazilian sub-lieutenants are the most senior non-commissioned rank (called Sub-Officer in the Navy and Air force), wearing a golden lozenge. In Mexico, the sub-lieutenant is the most junior officer in the rank scale, and wears a single gold bar. Thai sub-lieutenants and acting sub-lieutenants wear a single star on each shoulder. The British Army briefly used the rank of sub-lieutenant from 1871 to 1877, replacing the ranks of ensign in the infantry and cornet in the cavalry. In 1877, it was replaced in turn by the rank of second lieutenant, although this had always been used by the Royal Artillery, Royal Engineers, and rifle and fusilier regiments. = Navies = Royal Navy sub-lieutenant sleeve insignia Unterleutnant of the Volksmarine In the Royal Navy, the Royal Australian Navy and the Royal New Zealand Navy, the insignia of both sub-lieutenants and acting sub-lieutenants consists of one medium gold braid stripe with an executive curl. The size of this stripe should not be confused with the narrow stripe, colloquially referred to as \\"spaghetti strap,\\" used on the Royal New Zealand Navy rank of ensign and the Royal Canadian Navy's naval cadets. The Royal Air Force also followed this example of braiding when developing their rank system (see flying officer). The insignia of sub-lieutenants in most commonwealth countries are identical to the United States Navy and United States Coast Guard grade of ensign (although US ranks do not use the executive curl), even though its equivalent grade in the USN is actually lieutenant junior grade. In the Royal Canadian Navy, acting sub-lieutenants display one medium stripe. A sub-lieutenant adds a narrow stripe below the medium stripe to maintain the executive curl on the top. The equivalent air force lieutenant rank has the narrow stripe above the medium stripe since these elements do not need to maintain spacing on top due to the lack of an executive curl; the Royal Canadian Navy followed this pattern before the addition of the curl in 2010.

It is almost always very close to upturned umbrella shaped with a partially developed flat top, making it easy to recognise in mixed woodland. In this it differs from most of the other Brachystegia species that have variable shapes. The leaves are feathery in appearance, with around 10-12 leaflets arrayed along each leaf stalk. Distribution The muunze is found all over south tropical Africa and the less humid parts of east equatorial Africa. It reaches its southernmost extent around 21¬∞ S in the Runde River valley region of Zimbabwe. It is a tree of inland regions thriving at altitudes of around 900 ‚Äì 1750 metres. In the hotter, northern parts of its range it is found in drier types of woodland but further south it is found in both moist and dry open woodland. It prefers well-drained conditions and tolerates even very thin and rocky soils and so is usually restricted to hillsides and hilltops (not mountainous regions as such) rather than best positions in valley floors. In these positions, the tree is very easily recognisable due to its fluttering foliage, distinctive shape and flaky but smooth grey bark. Ecology The muunze is nowhere common but is widely distributed in its range and grows to its maximum size where many other trees find the soil too thin or poor; about 14 ‚Äì 16 metres depending on competition. It is a tree of open woodland in areas of contrasting wet and dry seasons, the longer the dry season, the more likely that the muunze stands bare for a notable period. Like other Brachystegia species it needs a cool, dry resting period when it loses its leaves followed by a hot dry spell that revives the tree. At this time (usually August‚ÄìSeptember) the new leaves are produced. These are a pale to rich red colour that fade to green over about a week. The muunze is therefore a beautiful sight in springtime but it does not compare to the much more striking show put on by the closely related msasa. The seeds are enclosed in a purplish woody pod. The seeds are dispersed, as in other Brachystegia species, when the drying pod is split by increasing tension in autumn (about April to May or later), hurling the seeds from it. Woodland of Brachystegia tamarindoides subsp. microphylla grows on quartzite outcrops and rocky slopes in the Chimanimani Mountains of Mozambique and Zimbabwe. The trees grow low and spreading, and are draped with tassels of Usnea lichen, with a sparse understory.Timberlake, J.R., Darbyshire, I., Wursten, B., Hadj-Hammou, J., Ballings, P., Mapaura, A., Matimele, H., Banze, A., Chipanga, H., Muassinar, D., Massunde, M., Chelene, I., Osborne, J. & Shah, T. (2016). Chimanimani Mountains: Botany and Conservation. Report produced under CEPF Grant 63512. Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, London. 95 pp. Name usage The misnomer \\"mountain acacia\\" for B. tamarindoides reflects the similarity of the tree's foliage to the feathery acacia species that are also found in Africa. Unlike African acacias, however, the muunze has no thorns. The name is for instance found in a paper concerning the degradation of woodlands by elephant predation and fire in the northern part of the Gonarezhou National Park in south-east Zimbabwe.C. Tafangenyasha in J Environmental Management 63, 37-50 (2001) The name muunze is Shona and is used in Zimbabwe and Mozambique.

Formerly known as Marshall's of Cambridge, it was originally founded by David Gregory Marshall in 1909. Initially operating chauffeur services, the firm soon branched out into vehicle repair and dealership activities. During the 1930s, Marshall's became increasingly engaged in aviation; by the end of the Second World War, the company had trained in excess of 20,000 aircrew for service within the Royal Air Force. It was also engaged repair and modification of military aircraft during the conflict; it has been claimed that Marshall's performed work on over 5,000 aircraft. During the postwar era, the Marshall companies have been involved in aerospace and specialist vehicle engineering; Marshall Aerospace forming a major part of the Marshall Group. The company performs all aspects of design, manufacture, maintenance, modification, conversion and logistic support of military, commercial and business aircraft. Traditionally focused on military customers, Marshall has increasingly orientated itself towards the civilian sector in recent decades. It employs over 4,400 people and is based on an site with of covered hangar space. History =Early years= Marshall Group was originally established during 1909 by its founder David Gregory Marshall, who gave the company his name. Its initial base was a small lock-up garage in Brunswick Gardens, Cambridge, and at first provided chauffeur services to individual customers. It quickly became commercially viable, enabling the business to relocate to larger premises in Kings Street during 1910 and again to Jesus Lane just two years later, expanding its operations to the sale of vehicles shortly thereafter. In 1912, Marshall's worked on its first aircraft, helping to repair the engine of a British Army airship, the Beta II, which had made an emergency landing in Jesus Green, near its garage. During the First World War, Marshall's premises were engaged in the servicing and repair of vehicles required for the British war effort. During the late 1920s, David Marshall's son, Arthur, took an active role in the company. A keen engineer and pilot, Arthur was involved in establishing an aerodrome at Fen Ditton on the outskirts of Cambridge. During 1930, the Marshall Flying School was formed at Fen Ditton, marking the company's entry into the aviation sector. During the 1930s, Marshall's purchased a large amount of farmland, using some of it to establish what would become Cambridge City Airport, which was larger and with greater facilities than its predercessor. Formally opened in 1937, the new airport was fortuitously timed with a coinciding national priority on rearmament, which included the training of military aircrew. Accordingly, in 1938, a major flying training school for the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve was established by Marshall; it had reportedly trained over 600 new RAF pilots prior to the start of the Battle of Britain. The scheme was ramped up during the Second World War; the company ultimately trained in excess of 20,000 aircrew, including pilots, observers and flying instructors. During 1941, the training scheme was universally adopted by the Royal Air Force (RAF). Prior to the war, Marshall's had opened a second garage, known as Airport Garage, on the site; both garages were temporarily closed down during the conflict and were reopened shortly after its end. Instead, the company was engaged in the repair and modification of military aircraft; it has been claimed that Marshall's performed work on over 5,000 aircraft, ranging in size and complexity from Airspeed Oxford and Avro Anson transport aircraft to front- line combat types as the de Havilland Mosquito, Supermarine Spitfire, Hawker Hurricane, Vickers Wellington and Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress. To cope with this workload, the firm's workforce was expanded to around 3,000 employees, many of which were women. Marshall's chose to continue its involvement in aviation work, such as repairs, structural modifications and conversions, even after the war's end, although it mostly abandoned its final assembly work. Instead, the firm operated as a sub-contractor of virtually all the British aircraft manufacturing companies. =Postwar= Marshall Motor Group rapidly flourished in the postwar era; various new garages were soon established to serve Peterborough, Bedford, and neighbouring smaller towns. During the 1950s and 1960s, the firm found work in modifying hundreds of various civil airliners, including the Vickers Viscount, the first turboprop airliner, and de Havilland Comets, the first jet-powered airliner, and the Bristol Britannia. Marshall's was also involved with the National Research Development Corporation, assisting Francis Thomas Bacon in the invention of the fuel cell. Around this time, Michael Marshall became the company's CEO. He managed the company for several decades, during which time it became one of the largest privately owned businesses in Britain. Royal Air Force Hercules C-130K (C3) in commemorative Hercules Integrated Operational Support Colour Scheme. Since 1966, Marshall Aerospace has been the designated support company for the Royal Air Force's fleet of C-130 Hercules. It has been formally recognised as a Sister Design Authority for the type since 1988. The company oversaw the introduction of RAF's 25 second generation C-130J Super Hecules fleet, as well as the retirement of half of the service's first generation aircraft. In addition to its domestic support operations, Marshall Aerospace has supported various international operators' own Hercules fleets. Marshall Group has also signed multiple agreements with US defense conglomerate Lockheed Martin to manufacture various components of the Super Hercules on behalf of the latter's for the global supply chain. Marshall Aerospace functioned as the design authority for the RAF's fleet of Lockheed TriStar tanker and freighter aircraft; as well as the appointed sister design authority for the RAF's Boeing E-3D Sentry. It undertook major maintenance and modification activity on these types, plus a range of other military and commercial aircraft. Notable design achievements include the design and production of Concorde's droop nose and visor in 1967, and a vestibular sled for medical research which flew 112 orbits in Space Shuttle Challenger on STS-61-A in 1985. Marshall Aerospace has also performed a variety of passenger to tanker and freighter aircraft conversions. One unusual project was the conversion of a Lockheed L-1011 Tristar airliner into a launch vehicle for a satellite delivery system, on behalf of Orbital Sciences. Marshall Aerospace was the designated industrial body involved in the Vulcan to the Sky project, which restored Avro Vulcan XH558 to a flight-worthy condition and supported its operations for numerous years.\\"Farewell to Flight Why 2015 must be XH558‚Äôs last flying season\\". Vulcan To The Sky, 25 November 2015. Marshall Group has been a long- term partner of Bombardier Aerospace. During 1998, the company was appointed the first independent authorised service centre in Europe for the Bombardier Global Express long-range business jet. In mid 2000, Marshall became involved in the Global Express' manufacturing process, performing interior completions on behalf of Bombardier. During the 2010s, the firm's expertise with the type enabled it to perform extensive modifications of the airframe to produce customised special mission models for military customers. Marshall Aerospace has also performed the production of long range fuel tanks for various Boeing aircraft, including the Boeing 747-400ER and 777-200LR airliners, as well as the KC-46 Pegasus refuelling tanker and the P-8 Posideon multi-mission maritime aircraft. During 1992, Marshall acquired military truck manufacturer AWD Trucks from receivership. The venture saw the revival of the Bedford name for an 18 tonne vehicle. Activity under this brand was discontinued during 1998. By 2012, the Marshall Group was reporting an annual turnover in excess of ¬£1 billion and was employing nearly 4,500 staff. During the 2010s, the business made various moves to expand its footprint in commercial aviation, announcing its intention to establish Cambridge Airport as a primary hub for business aviation operations during 2012. In September 2013, Marshall purchased Hawker Beechcraft's services branch at Broughton, subsequently rebranding it Marshall Aviation Services as well as being appointed Hawker's distributor for the UK, Ireland and Scandinavia. That same year, the company also bought FlairJet, an air charter specialist. This move was part of Marshalls' strategy to grow its charter fleet five-fold. At this time, Marshall Group was deliberately restructuring its business activities, particularly its sizable aerospace division. During late 2015, Marshall Group announced that, in response to a downturn in demand from the British armed forces, the firm intended to focus on its growing civilian activities, including the resumption of VIP aircraft conversion work to counteract this. During 2019, the company announced that was planning to relocate its headquarters from its historic home at Cambridge Airport over the coming decade, although it noted there was value in relocating to a nearby location, such as Cranfield Airport, Duxford Aerodrome and RAF Wyton. Activities Marshall Group's headquarters is located on an 800-acre site in Cambridge, UK, the group operates worldwide in the fields of aerospace, military land systems and fleet management; the company also cooperated with 67 franchised automotive dealerships across the UK by 2012. Marshall Aerospace has been involved with all levels of aircraft maintenance, modification and conversion for more than seventy years. The company has the authorisation and experience to work on a range of aircraft from Cessna Citations to Boeing 747s in civil use, and Lockheed C-130 Hercules and Lockheed L-1011 TriStars for the military. Marshall Aerospace carries out maintenance from routine daily maintenance to a full aircraft depot level checks. All forms of conversions, re-configurations, modifications and repairs can be designed and implemented by Marshall Aerospace. The company's commercial aircraft hangar can house a range of different aircraft, for example one, Boeing 747‚Äì400, one McDonnell Douglas MD-11 and two Airbus A320s. Marshall also has other hangar space that can hold up to 12 C-130s at a time. Amongst the various facilities it has, the firm possesses the largest quiet test building in Europe. The company has a long history of rapid response to customers, an example being the complete repaint of a Tristar at Cambridge on 16 January 1991; it was repainted in \\"desert colours\\" overnight and flown back to the Gulf for operations on 17 January 1991, the first full day of Operation Desert Storm. During the 2010s, Marshall Aerospace opened a new main paint bay, which it claimed to be one of the largest in Europe, being big enough to accommodate an entire Boeing 747. Besides aerospace, Marshall Group operates other divisions in a diverse range of fields. Marshall Group Properties own a large portion of the land surrounding, and including, Cambridge City Airport, where the company has its main base; over the years, it has embarked on various development projects to expand the airport's facilities and build thousands of homes nearby. The airport itself has been owned and operated by the company since 1937. The group operates its own investment division, Martlet, which aims to provide funding to British deep technology and life science start-ups. As well as issuing capital to appealing ventures, Martlet offers other forms of support, including its experience and industry contacts, to its partners. Marshall Group is the majority shareholder of Marshall Motor Retail and Leasing, which is listed on the Alternative Investment Market; this unit specialises are the sale and repair of new and used vehicles, as well as their leasing. Since 1998, the Marshall Aerospace technical training department has provided systems training to all levels of engineering. There are various training programmes available for people of all ages, from apprenticeships and graduate schemes, through to Adult Re-training programmes. The courses provided are integral to meeting the business aims of the company. Planned relocation In May 2019, the Marshall Group, owners of Cambridge Airport, announced that the airport would be closed to all traffic by 2030 at the latest. The Group plans to redevelop the airport site for around 12,000 homes and of business premises. , the Group was deciding between three potential airfields for its continuing operations: Duxford and Wyton in Cambridgeshire, and Cranfield in Bedfordshire. In January 2020 the Group ruled out moving to Duxford due to incompatibility between the defence requirements of the Group and the requirements of the local traffic. On 6 October 2020, Cranfield University and MADG announced that they had signed an option agreement for the potential relocation of MADG to Cranfield Airport. A spokesperson for MADG cautioned that \\"it is important to note that the signing of the option agreement does not represent a final decision\\".

Metenolone acetate is taken by mouth, while metenolone enanthate is given by injection into muscle. Side effects of metenolone esters include symptoms of masculinization like acne, increased hair growth, voice changes, and increased sexual desire. Metenolone esters are synthetic androgens and anabolic steroids and hence are agonists of the androgen receptor (AR), the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). They have moderate anabolic effects and weak androgenic effects, as well as no estrogenic effects or risk of liver damage. Metenolone esters are androgen esters and prodrugs of metenolone in the body. Metenolone esters were introduced for medical use in the early 1960s. In addition to their medical use, metenolone esters are used to improve physique and performance. The drugs are controlled substances in many countries and so non-medical use is generally illicit. They have mostly been discontinued for medical use and have limited availability. Medical uses Metenolone, as its esters, is used almost exclusively in the treatment of anemia due to bone marrow failure. It has also been used to treat wasting syndromes due to major surgery, infection, long-term corticosteroid therapy, malnutrition, or other causes. It has also been used to treat osteoporosis and sarcopenia, to inhibit the natural loss of muscle mass with aging, and to promote weight gain in underweight premature infants and children. Side effects Side effects of metenolone and its esters include virilization among others. Pharmacology =Pharmacodynamics= Due to its double bond between the C1 and C2 positions, metenolone is resistant to metabolism by 3Œ±-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3Œ±-HSD). As such, unlike DHT and the closely related DHT derivatives mestanolone (17Œ±-methyl-DHT) and mesterolone (1Œ±-methyl-DHT), metenolone has considerable anabolic effects. =Pharmacokinetics= Metenolone has very low affinity for human serum sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), about 16% of that of testosterone and 3% of that of DHT. Chemistry Metenolone, also known as 1-methyl-4,5Œ±-dihydro-Œ¥1-testosterone (1-methyl-Œ¥1-DHT) or as 1-methyl-5Œ±-androst-1-en-17Œ≤-ol-3-one, is a synthetic androstane steroid and derivative of dihydrotestosterone (DHT). A closely related AAS is mesterolone (1Œ±-methyl-DHT). Society and culture =Generic names= Metenolone is the generic name of the drug and its , while methenolone is its . It has also been referred to as methylandrostenolone. This synonym should not be confused with methandrostenolone, which is another name for a different AAS known as metandienone. =Doping in sports= Metenolone and its esters are banned from use in sports governed by the World Anti-Doping Agency. The NBA and NBPA also banned the use of metenolone and its esters under the Anti-Drug Program. There are known cases of doping in sports with metenolone esters by professional athletes.

It was created in 1980 by the United States Congress and renamed in 1984 as the Frank Church- River of No Return Wilderness Area in honor of U.S. Senator Frank Church. At , it is the largest contiguous federally managed wilderness in the United States outside of Alaska. The Death Valley Wilderness is the largest single designated area but consists of numerous disconnected units. The wilderness protects several mountain ranges, extensive wildlife, and a popular whitewater rafting river: the Salmon River. Description Together with the adjacent Gospel Hump Wilderness and surrounding unprotected roadless Forest Service land, it is the core of a 3.3 million acre (13,000 km2) roadless area. It is separated from the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness, to the north, by a single dirt road (the Magruder Corridor). The wilderness contains parts of several mountain ranges, including the Salmon River Mountains, the Clearwater Mountains, and the Bighorn Crags. The ranges are split by steep canyons of the Middle and Main forks of the Salmon River. The Salmon River is a popular destination for whitewater rafting, and is colloquially known as the \\"River of No Return\\" for its swift current and large rapids which make upstream travel difficult. Most of the area is covered by coniferous forests, with dry, open land along the rivers at lower elevations. While designation as a wilderness area in the United States generally requires the prohibition of any motorized machinery, the use of jetboats (On the Main Fork of the Salmon River) and several airstrips are permitted in this wilderness as grandfathered existing uses before the wilderness was designated. =National forests= The Frank Church‚ÄîRiver of No Return Wilderness is located in six different national forests plus a relatively tiny portion of land of the Bureau of Land Management, more components than any other wilderness. In descending order of acreage they are: * Payette National Forest (33.45%) * Challis National Forest (21.78%) * Salmon National Forest (17.81%) (now administratively combined with Challis NF, so that their total is 39.59%) * Boise National Forest (14.06%) * Bitterroot National Forest (8.18%) * Nez Perce National Forest (4.68%) * Bureau of Land Management (0.034%)  History  In 1931, 1,090,000 acres (4,400 km2) in Central Idaho were declared by the U.S. Forest Service as The Idaho Primitive Area. In 1963, the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness was split into three parts: The Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness, the Salmon River Breaks Primitive area, and the Magruder Corridor--the land between the two areas. Frank Church was the Senate floor sponsor for the Wilderness Act of 1964, which protected 9 million acres (36,000 km2) of United States land as part of the National Wilderness Preservation System. In 1968, he introduced the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, which included the Middle Fork of the Salmon River, so that rivers \\"shall be preserved in free-flowing condition, and that they and their immediate environments shall be protected for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations.\\" Church's environmental legislation culminated in 1980 with the passage of the Central Idaho Wilderness Act. The act created the River of No Return Wilderness by combining the Idaho Primitive Area, the Salmon River Breaks Primitive Area, and a portion of the Magruder Corridor. The Act also added of the Salmon River to the Wild and Scenic Rivers System. President Carter had taken his family on a three-day float trip down the Middle Fork of the Salmon River in August 1978, accompanied by Interior Secretary Cecil Andrus, the former (and future) Idaho governor. The administration forwarded a central Idaho wilderness proposal to Congress later that year and Carter signed the final act on July 23, 1980. =Renamed= In January 1984, Congress honored Senator Church, who had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, by renaming the area The Frank Church‚ÄîRiver of No Return Wilderness. Idaho Senator Jim McClure introduced the measure in the Senate in late February, and President Reagan signed the act on March 14, less than four weeks before Church's death on April 7 at age 59.http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_BURNED_BODIES_MISSING_CHILDREN?SITE=KFWB&SECTION;=HOME&TEMPLATE;=DEFAULT =Kidnapping of Hannah Anderson= On August 7, 2013, a retired sheriff and three other horseback riders in the rugged back country encountered Hannah Anderson and her abductor, James DiMaggio. FBI agents rescued Anderson and killed DiMaggio near Morehead Lake on August 10.  Wildlife  Because of its size the wilderness area provides a secluded habitat for a wide variety of mammal species, including some rare, vulnerable species. The wilderness is inhabited by a large population of mountain lions and grey wolves. Populations of black bears, as well as: lynx, coyote, and red fox are scattered throughout the area. Other observable ruminant wildlife within the wilderness include: bighorn sheep, mountain goats, elk, moose, mule deer, and white tail deer. While this area has been deemed as one of the few remaining areas in the contiguous states with suitable habitat for grizzly bears, no established populations are known to exist. The wilderness also offers some of the most critical habitat for wolverines in the lower 48 states. Beavers that were parachuted into the area from Idaho (in 1948) have established a healthy colony here.http://boisestatepublicradio.org/post/parachuting-beavers-idahos- wilderness-yes-it-really-happened See also *Frank Church *List of U.S. Wilderness Areas *Wilderness Act *United States Postal Service References *  External links  * U.S. Forest Service page on the Frank Church-RNR Area ** User's Guide - December 2001 revision * Wilderness.net wilderness information * TopoQuest map of the wilderness * Wolverines: Ghosts In Our Woods from Sun Valley Guide * Idaho Public Television - The Frank Church Wilderness ** The Frank Church Wilderness - video - Documentary produced by Idaho Public Television Wilderness Areas of Idaho Bitterroot National Forest Boise National Forest Salmon-Challis National Forest Nez Perce National Forest Payette National Forest Protected areas of Custer County, Idaho Protected areas of Idaho County, Idaho Protected areas of Lemhi County, Idaho Protected areas of Valley County, Idaho Regions of Idaho IUCN Category Ib Protected areas established in 1980 1980 establishments in Idaho ","title":"Frank Church‚ÄìRiver of No Return Wilderness"},{"id":"990894","text":"Miombo forest on the Nyika Plateau, Tanzania The Miombo woodland is a tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome (in the World Wide Fund for Nature scheme). It includes four woodland savanna ecoregions (listed below) characterized by the dominant presence of Brachystegia and Julbernardia species of trees, and has a range of climates ranging from humid to semi-arid, and tropical to subtropical or even temperate. The trees characteristically shed their leaves for a short period in the dry season to reduce water loss, and produce a flush of new leaves just before the onset of the rainy season with rich gold and red colours masking the underlying chlorophyll, reminiscent of temperate autumn colours in the temperate zone. The woodland gets its name from miombo (plural, singular muombo), the Bemba word for Brachystegia species. Other Bantu languages of the region, such as Swahili and Shona, have related if not identical words, such as Swahili miyombo (singular myombo). Miombo woodland ecoregions Miombo woodlands form a broad belt across south-central Africa, running from Angola in the west to Tanzania to the east. These woodlands are dominated by trees of subfamily Caesalpinioideae, particularly miombo (Brachystegia), Julbernardia and Isoberlinia, which are rarely found outside miombo woodlands. The four ecoregions are: *Angolan miombo woodlands (Angola) *Central Zambezian miombo woodlands (Angola, Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Malawi, Tanzania, Zambia) *Eastern miombo woodlands (Mozambique, Tanzania) *Southern miombo woodlands (Malawi, Mozambique, southern Zambia, Zimbabwe) Miombo woodlands can be classified as dry or wet based on the per annum amount and distribution of rainfall. Dry woodlands occur in those areas receiving less than 1000 mm annual rainfall, mostly in Zimbabwe, Central Tanzania and southern areas of Mozambique, Malawi and Zambia. Wet woodlands are those receiving more than 1000 mm annual rainfall, mainly located in Northern Zambia, eastern Angola, central Malawi and southwestern Tanzania. People These miombo woodlands are also important to the livelihoods of many rural people, who depend on the resources available from the woodland. The wide variety of species provides non-timber products such as fruits, honey, fodder for livestock and fuelwood. Flora and fauna Despite the relatively nutrient-poor soil, long dry season (and low rainfall in some areas) the woodland is home to many species, including several miombo specialist endemic bird species. The predominant tree is miombo (Brachystegia spp.). It also provides food and cover for mammals such as the African elephant (Loxodonta africana), African wild dog (Lycaon pictus), sable antelope (Hippotragus niger) and Lichtenstein's hartebeest (Sigmoceros lichtensteinii).Bruce M Campbell. 1996 Gallery File:Brachystegia glaucescens.jpg|Foliage and pods of the mountain mfuti, Brachystegia glaucescens Line notes References *Bruce M Campbell. ed. 1996.

He became the official physician of the papal galleys for a period, then came to Rome to lecture in natural philosophy at the Collegio Romano. He apparently became the leading peripatetic of the city, and was counted among the opponents of the Copernican heliocentric theory.

He participated in the demonstrations of the instrument by Galileo and was not among those who doubted the ability of the instrument. But he did debate Galileo's three-dimensional representation of the Moon based on two- dimensional visual observations. In his book De Phenomenis in Orbe Lunae (published in Venice in 1612) he claimed that the untreated stone (known as \\"lapis solaris\\" and shown to him by Galileo Galilei) was unable to give off light only after calcination.

The barons sought to force the king to rule with a council of barons rather than through his favourites. The war also featured a series of massacres of Jews by de Montfort's supporters including his sons Henry and Simon, in attacks aimed at seizing and destroying evidence of baronial debts. To bolster the initial success of his baronial regime, de Montfort sought to broaden the social foundations of parliament by extending the franchise to the commons for the first time. However, after a rule of just over a year, de Montfort was killed by forces loyal to the king in the Battle of Evesham. Causes The reign of Henry III is most remembered for the constitutional crisis in this period of civil strife, which was provoked ostensibly by his demands for extra finances, but which marked a more general dissatisfaction with Henry's methods of government on the part of the English barons, discontent which was exacerbated by widespread famine. French-born Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, had originally been one of the foreign upstarts so loathed by many lords as Henry's foreign councillors, but having inherited through his mother the English title Earl of Leicester, he married Henry's sister Eleanor without Henry's permission, and without the agreement of the English Barons (ordinarily necessary since it was a matter of state). As a result, a feud developed between de Montfort and Henry. Their relationship reached a crisis in the 1250s, when de Montfort was put on trial for actions he took as lieutenant of Gascony, the last remaining Plantagenet lands across the English Channel. De Montfort took advantage of rising anti- Jewish sentiments in England. An alleged Jewish child murder of Hugh of Lincoln had led to the hanging of 18 Jews. Official anti-Judaic measures sponsored by the Catholic Church combined with resentment about debts among the barons gave an opportunity for Montfort to target this group and incite rebellion by calling for the cancellation of Jewish debts. says \\"Simon de Montfort ‚Ä¶ used the cancellation of Jewish debts to his own advantage and had managed to convince followers that it was worth rebelling for.\\" Henry also became embroiled in funding a war against the Hohenstaufen Dynasty in Sicily on behalf of Pope Innocent IV in return for the Hohenstaufen title King of Sicily for his second son Edmund. This made many barons fearful that Henry was following in the footsteps of his father King John and, like him, needed to be kept in check. When Henry's treasury ran dry, Innocent withdrew the title, and in regranting it to Charles of Anjou in effect negated the sale. Simon de Montfort became leader of those who wanted to reassert the Magna Carta and force the king to surrender more power to the baronial council. In 1258, initiating the move toward reform, seven leading barons forced Henry to agree to the Provisions of Oxford, which effectively abolished the absolutist Anglo- Norman monarchy, giving power to a council of twenty-four barons to deal with the business of government and providing for a great council in the form of a parliament every three years, to monitor their performance. Henry was forced to take part in the swearing of a collective oath to uphold the Provisions. Seeking to restore his position, in 1259 Henry purchased the support of King Louis IX of France by the Treaty of Paris, agreeing to accept the loss of the lands in France that had been seized from him and from his father King John by Louis and his predecessors since 1202, and to do homage for those that remained in his hands. In 1261 he obtained a papal bull releasing him from his oath, and set about reasserting his control of government. The baronial opposition responded by summoning their own Parliament and contesting control of local government, but with civil war looming they backed down and de Montfort fled to France, while the other key opposition leader, Richard de Clare, Earl of Hertford and Gloucester, switched over to the King's side. Under the Treaty of Kingston an arbitration system was agreed to resolve outstanding disputes between Henry and the barons, with de Clare as the initial arbiter and the option of appealing his verdicts to Louis IX. However, continued Poitevin influence and the failures and renewal of provocative policies by Henry's government soon inflamed hostility once more. The King's position was further weakened by the death of Richard de Clare and the succession of his son Gilbert, who sided with the opposition, and by the reversal of the papal annulment of his oath to uphold the Provisions. In April 1263 Simon de Montfort returned to England and gathered a council of dissident barons at Oxford. Fighting broke out in the Welsh Marches, and by the autumn both sides had raised considerable armies. De Montfort marched on London and the city rose in revolt, trapping the King and Queen at the Tower of London. They were taken prisoner and de Montfort assumed effective control of government in Henry's name. However, his support soon fractured and Henry was able to regain his liberty. With violent disorder spreading and the prospect of all-out war, Henry appealed to Louis for arbitration, and after initial resistance de Montfort consented to this. In January 1264, by the Mise of Amiens, Louis declared in Henry's favour, annulling the Provisions of Oxford. Some of the barons who had previously opposed Henry acquiesced in this verdict, but a more radical faction led by de Montfort prepared to resist any reassertion of royal power, and both they and the king gathered their forces for war. Course of the war Fighting resumed in February 1264, with attacks by Simon de Montfort's sons Henry and Simon the Younger on royalist supporters in the Welsh Borders. Cancellation of debts (owed to Jews) was part of Montfort's call to arms. A series of attacks on Jewish communities followed, organised by key allies of Montfort, hoping to gain by destroying the records of their debts to moneylenders. These pogroms killed the majority of Jews in Worcester, in this case led by de Montfort's son Henry and Robert Earl Ferrers. At London, one of his key followers John fitz John, led the attack and is said to have killed leading Jewish figures Isaac fil Aaron and Cok fil Abraham with his bare hands. He allegedly shared the loot with Montfort. 500 Jews died. Attacks occurred in Winchester, led by the younger Simon de Montfort. Anti-Jewish violence spread to Lincoln and Cambridge, Jewish communities were also targeted at Canterbury, led by Gilbert de Clare, and Northampton. In April the elder Simon de Montfort, in control of London, assembled his forces at St Albans and marched to relieve Northampton, which was under siege by the royalists, but was too late to prevent the town's capture by betrayal. He then moved into Kent and laid siege to the royal stronghold of Rochester Castle, but on hearing reports of a royal advance on London he withdrew most of his forces from the siege to confront this threat. King Henry, however, bypassed the capital and the rebel army and raised the siege of Rochester, before capturing Tonbridge and Winchelsea from the rebels. Moving into Sussex, Henry was confronted by de Montfort, who had led his army out from London in pursuit. In the Battle of Lewes on 14 May, Henry was defeated and taken prisoner by de Montfort, along with his son Prince Edward and his brother, Richard of Cornwall. While Henry was reduced to a figurehead king, de Montfort broadened parliamentary representation to include groups beyond the nobility, members from each county of England and many important towns. Henry and his son Edward remained effective prisoners. Around this time, Montfort announced the cancellation of all debt owed to Jews. The radicalism of de Montfort's subversion of traditional order once again led to a fracturing of his brittle base of support. In May 1265 Prince Edward escaped from de Montfort's custody at Hereford and assembled a new royalist army at Worcester. He attracted defectors from the baronial cause, most importantly Gilbert de Clare, de Montfort's most powerful ally. Simon was blocked from moving east from Hereford by royalist control of the crossings of the River Severn, completed by Edward's capture of Gloucester. Moving into Wales, de Montfort forged an alliance with the Welsh Prince Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, who provided him with soldiers. An attempt by Simon to ship his forces across the Severn estuary from Newport was thwarted when his transports were destroyed by royalist warships, and he returned to Hereford. Prince Edward meanwhile attacked de Montfort's seat at Kenilworth Castle, where the younger Simon de Montfort had been gathering forces to assist his father. The baronial army was caught asleep in camp by a surprise attack in the early hours of 1 August and massacred. The survivors took refuge inside the castle and Edward initiated the long Siege of Kenilworth. The elder Simon had taken advantage of Edward's move to Kenilworth to cross the Severn at Kempsey, and was on his way to join his son when he was intercepted and decisively defeated by the royalists in the Battle of Evesham on 4 August. Simon and his son Henry were killed in the fighting, and King Henry, whom de Montfort had taken into battle with him, was freed. The victory at Evesham left the royalists in a dominant position, but the rebels continued to defend their strongholds, most notably Kenilworth, and the war dragged on. In 1266 the King was persuaded to seek a compromise settlement, and a commission of bishops and barons drafted a proclamation known as the Dictum of Kenilworth, issued on 31 October. This set terms under which rebels could secure a pardon and regain their confiscated lands, on payment of a heavy fine. The proposal was initially rejected by the rebels, but on 14 December hunger finally compelled the defenders of Kenilworth to surrender, accepting the terms of the Dictum. In April 1267 Gilbert de Clare turned again to revolt and occupied London. He was reconciled with Henry by a negotiated settlement in June, which eased the terms of the Dictum, enabling repentant rebels to regain their lands before rather than after paying their fines. That summer also saw the negotiated surrender of the last group of defiant rebels, who had been holding out in the Fens at the Isle of Ely. The total casualties of the war are estimated at 15,000.

His travel books such as his 1915 Old Calabria were also appreciated for the quality of their writing. Life Norman Douglas was born in Th√ºringen, Austria (his surname was registered at birth as Douglass).The Douglas Archives. douglashistory.co.uk. Retrieved on 12 February 2012. His mother was Vanda von Poellnitz. His father was John Sholto Douglas (1845‚Äì1874), manager of a cotton mill, who died in a hunting accident when Douglas was about six. He spent the first years of his life on the family estate, Villa Falkenhorst, in Th√ºringen. Douglas was brought up mainly at Tilquhillie, Deeside, his paternal home in Scotland. He was educated at Yarlet Hall and Uppingham School in England, and then at a grammar school in Karlsruhe. Douglas's paternal grandfather was the 14th Laird of Tilquhillie. Douglas's maternal great-grandfather was General James Ochoncar Forbes, 17th Lord Forbes. He started in the diplomatic service in 1894 and from then until 1896 was based in St. Petersburg, but was placed on leave following a sexual scandal. In 1897 he bought a villa (Villa Maya) in Posillipo, a maritime suburb of Naples. The next year he married a cousin Elizabeth Louisa Theobaldina FitzGibbon (their mothers were sisters, daughters of Baron Ernst von Poellnitz). They had two children, Louis Archibald (Archie) and Robert Sholto (Robin),Collection Norman Douglas ‚Äì Robert Kohler . Normandouglas.ch. Retrieved on 10 August 2011. and Norman's first published book, Unprofessional Tales (1901), was written in collaboration with Elizabeth and first appeared under the pseudonym Normyx. However, the couple were divorced in 1903 on grounds of Elizabeth's infidelity. Douglas then moved to Capri, began dividing his time between the Villa Daphne there and London, and became a more committed writer. Nepenthe, the fictional island setting of his novel South Wind (1917), is Capri in light disguise. His friends on the island included the opium addict Jacques d'Adelsw√§rd-Fersen. From 1912 to 1914 Douglas worked for The English Review. He met D. H. Lawrence through this connection. In late 1916 Douglas jumped bail in London on a charge of indecent assault on a sixteen-year-old boy, and he effectively lived in exile from then on. He later described himself as \\"Norman Douglas of Capri, and of Naples and Florence, was formerly of England, which he fled during the war to avoid persecution for kissing a boy and giving him some cakes and a shilling\\". He did not mention that the boy had complained to the police. Douglas's novel They Went (1920 ) is a fantasy based on Breton folklore. D. H. Lawrence based a character in his novel Aaron's Rod (1922) on Douglas, which led to a falling out between the two writers.Douglas's side of the feud is recounted in A Plea for Better Manners, the last essay in his collection Experiments (1926). Douglas and Lawrence continued the feud through their responses to the memoirs of the American author Maurice Magnus.Norman Douglas, \\"A Plea for Better Manners\\", in Experiments. Reprinted in Lawrence, D. H., Memoir of Maurice Magnus, edited by Keith Cushman, Black Sparrow Press (1987) . (See \\"Norman Douglas in fiction,\\" below.) In the book Twentieth Century Authors Douglas stated that he disliked Marxism, Puritanism and \\"all kinds of set forms, including official Christianity\\". During Douglas's years in Florence he was associated with the publisher and bookseller Pino Orioli, who published a number of Douglas's books and works by other English authors in his Lungarno series. Many of these books, notably the first edition of Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover, would have been prosecuted for obscenity if they had been published in London. Douglas probably had a major hand in writing Orioli's autobiography, Adventures of a Bookseller. Douglas in 1935 Further scandals led Douglas to leave Italy for the South of France in 1937. Following the collapse of France in 1940 Douglas left the Riviera and made a circuitous journey to London, where he lived from 1942 to 1946. He published the first edition of his Almanac in a tiny edition in Lisbon. He returned to Capri in 1946 and was made a citizen of the island. His circle of acquaintances included the writer Graham Greene, the composer Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji and the food writer Elizabeth David. Douglas died in Capri, apparently after deliberately overdosing himself on drugs after a long illness (see Impossible Woman: Memoirs of Dottoressa Moore, ed. Greene). His last words are reputed to have been: \\"Get those fucking nuns away from me.\\"Old Calabria (via Google Books), by Norman Douglas; Northwestern University Press; 1996 edition; introduction by Jon Manchip White, page xvi The Latin inscription on his tombstone, from an ode by Horace, reads: Omnes eodem cogimur, \\"We are all driven to the same end\\".Horace, Ode 2.3.

Tomlinson, a contemporary of Douglas's, concluded his 1931 biography by saying that Douglas's kind of prose \\"is at present out of fashion\\". He compared the writing to that of great English essayists and novelists: to Jonathan Swift's irony and Laurence Sterne's warmth.H.M. Tomlinson. Norman Douglas. 1931. Pages 62‚Äì63.

John Sutherland reports that \\"Douglas's Mediterranean travel writing chimed with the public taste\\", and that \\"there was a time when, in smart literary conversations, Norman Douglas was regarded as one of the smartest things going. Part of that smartness was his keeping, for the whole of his long depraved life, one jump ahead of the law.\\"John Sutherland, 2011. Pages 269‚Äì270. In The Grand Tour and Beyond: British and American Travellers in Southern Italy, 1545‚Äì1960 (which is chapter 4 of The Evolution of the Grand Tour: Anglo-Italian Cultural Relations since the Renaissance), Edward Chaney wrote that \\"the true heir to the great tradition of the 'pedestrian tour' in our own [20th] century has been 'pagan-to-the-core' Norman Douglas.

Works Douglas's most famous work South Wind is a fictionalised account of life in Capri, with controversial references to moral and sexual issues. It has been frequently reprinted. His travel books also combine erudition, insight, whimsicality, and some fine prose. These works include Siren Land (1911), Fountains in the Sand, described as \\"rambles amongst the oases of Tunisia\\" (1912), Old Calabria (1915), Together (Austria) (1923) and Alone (Italy) (1921). Reviewing Douglas's work in Italian Americana, John Paul Russo wrote: Douglas's early pamphlets on Capri were revised in Capri (privately published, 1930). His last published work was A Footnote on Capri (1952). In 1928, Douglas published Some Limericks, an anthology of more-or-less obscene limericks with a mock- scholarly critical apparatus.

It is the second sequel to Final Fight released for the Super NES, following Final Fight 2, and like its predecessor, it was produced by Capcom's consumer division with no preceding arcade version released. The game features the return of the protagonist Guy along with Haggar and also introduces new characters Lucia and Dean. The game's plot takes them through their efforts to rid Metro City of the new Skull Cross gang. Final Fight 3 introduced new moves, as well as branching paths during gameplay and multiple endings. Also available is the option to fight alongside a CPU-controlled partner. However, most critics felt these changes did too little in the way of expanding and improving upon the original Final Fight, and the game was released to little fanfare. The next Final Fight game released, Final Fight Revenge, eschewed the side-scrolling beat'em up gameplay in favor of a one-on-one 3D fighting game format. Plot Following the annihilation of the Mad Gear Gang, a new criminal group named the Skull Cross Gang emerges as the new dominant criminal organization in Metro City. When Guy returns to Metro City from his martial art training to become reacquainted with his friend Mike Haggar, the Mayor of Metro City, the two are suddenly informed that the Skull Cross Gang has started a riot in the downtown area of the city. Joined by Lucia, a detective in the Metro City Police's Special Crimes Unit, and Dean, a street fighter whose family was murdered by the Skull Cross Gang, Guy and Haggar must once again save Metro City from its newest menace. Gameplay boss of stage 2. This is one of two locations the player can encounter Callman, due to the game's branching gameplay The player has a choice between four characters: Guy and Haggar from the original Final Fight return, along with new heroes Lucia and Dean. As in the previous Final Fight games, each character has their own set of moves, techniques and abilities unique to their character. Like in Final Fight 2, the game can be played alone or with a second player, along with an additional game mode that allows a single player be accompanied by a CPU-controlled partner. The player has many new abilities which were not available in the previous Final Fight games. The player can now dash and perform dashing attacks or dashing jump attacks like in the previous Capcom beat-em-up Captain Commando. The player can also grab enemies from behind and perform holding and throwing attacks, as well as move while keeping the direction the player is facing locked. The player also has access to command- based special techniques similar to Street Fighter, including a Super Move. Much like the Super Combos featured in Super Street Fighter II Turbo, the player has a Super Move gauge which fills up as the player performs their regular attacks against enemies. When the gauge is full, the player will have access to a powerful Super Move, which will consume the entire gauge. If the Super gauge remains full for a certain period and the Super move is not used, then the gauge will be emptied automatically. Like in the previous Final Fight games, the player has access to weapons, health-restoring food and other bonus point items, which are stored inside breakable drums. Each character in Final Fight 3 specializes in a specific weapon and if the player picks up their character's preferred weapon, then they will have access to a unique combo attack exclusive to the character (for example, Guy specializes in using nunchaku). There are a total of six stages in the game, each with their unique boss character. The stages in the game feature multiple paths that changes the areas the player will visit, as well as the enemies and bosses they encounter. The game's ending changes depending on the selected character, the path taken to reach the end of the game, and the difficulty setting. Reception GamePro gave the game a mixed review, summarizing that \\"Although Final Fight 3 has more characters and moves than its precursors, the gameplay quickly feels routine.\\" They approved of the addition of Lucia but felt Dean's moves were \\"sluggish and awkward\\" and that the bosses were little more than oversized regular enemies. While they praised the graphics and the branching stages, they felt the repetitiveness of the gameplay outweighed these. The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly similarly felt that despite the improved graphics and new features, the game felt like simply \\"more of the same\\" with overly repetitive gameplay. They scored it a 5.675 out of 10. A reviewer for Next Generation too felt that the additions were not enough to make the game a significant step forward from the original, and remarked, \\"It's not dull, but it's not all that exciting either.\\" He gave it two out of five stars. Legacy The first stages background music, \\"For Metro City\\", is used for the Hyper Street Fighter Alpha secret game featured in Street Fighter Alpha Anthology as Guy's theme music in Classic Mode. Lucia would later appear as a DLC character in Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition.

It features an eighth-century round tower that acts as a focal point for the area. Clondalkin forms part of the Dublin Mid-West D√°il constituency and its postal code is Dublin 22. Clondalkin is also the name of a civil parish in the ancient barony of Uppercross, and is also used in relation to some local religious parishes. History =Prehistory= Neolithic tribes first settled in the area around 7,600 years ago, taking advantage of the site's favourable location on the River Camac, overlooking the River Liffey and the inland pass between the mountains and the river. Evidence of the presence of the Cualann Celtic people (an early tribe possibly noted on as the Cauci on Ptolemy's world map) can be found in various mounds and raths. =Christian era= Clondalkin is believed to have been founded by Saint Cronan Mochua as a monastic settlement on the River Camac over 1,400 years ago (possibly late 6th or early 7th centuries). The round tower was built perhaps two centuries later (circa 790 AD) as part of the monastery. By the eighth century, Saint Fugillus was Bishop of Clondalkin and noted gospel manuscripts were produced ‚Äì the most famous of these being the Clondalkin mass book which is on display in Karlsruhe, Germany. =Viking arrival= Clondalkin was sacked by Vikings in 832 AD, and the monastery was burned to the ground. One of the early Norse kings of Dublin, Amla√≠b Conung, built a fortress on the site in the middle of the 9th century. In 867 a force led by Cenn√©tig mac Ga√≠th√©ne, king of Lo√≠gis, burned the fortress at Clondalkin and killed 100 of Amla√≠b's followers. The monastery was later restored and, with help from other surrounding monasteries, influenced the Viking settlers in their conversion to Christianity. The district remained under Norse control until the Viking defeat by Brian Boru at the famous Battle of Clontarf in 1014. =Norman era= View from 1820 Clondalkin Castle - view from 1830 Clondalkin witnessed another historic event during the Norman invasion in 1171 when there was a battle there between Richard de Clare (Strongbow) and the last High King of Ireland Ruaidhr√≠ Ua Conchabhair. Clondalkin is a civil parish in the ancient barony of Uppercross. An exclave of the parish, consisting of the single townland of Blundelstown, is located in the neighbouring barony of Newcastle to the west. =17th century and beyond= Centuries later, Clondalkin was the scene for some of the fighting in the 1641 Rebellion, when the Gaelic Irish in Ulster, and later in the rest of the kingdom, and the Old English in the Pale of Leinster rebelled against rule from Westminster. (Ireland had its own parliament at this time, but it was severely limited in its powers, e.g. by Poynings' Law.) Clondalkin Paper Mill was established at the start of the 19th century by Thomas Seery and Son. Having changed ownership over the years, activity peaked during the First World War as the focus moved to war production. Productivity slowed until the mill closed its doors for the last time in 1987. The Mill Shopping Centre was later built on the same street, keeping the name alive. Historical features A focal point for Clondalkin is the eighth-century round tower, one of the four remaining towers in the historic County Dublin. Acknowledged as one of the oldest in the country, it is 25.6 metres high and has its original conical cap. In July 2017, The Round Tower Heritage Centre opened in the village core, the result of a ‚Ç¨3.5 investment into enhancing the historic Round Tower with an interactive interpretive centre and a monastic-style garden. The centre addresses the history of Clondalkin and the round tower. The Happy Pear also opened within the heritage centre. Clondalkin is also home to St Brigid's Well, which is said to have been established as a well for baptising pagans by Saint Brigid in the 5th century. It was believed that the well-possessed powers of healing. Tully's Castle is a castle and a National Monument. Localities North Clondalkin, within Dublin 22, also comprises multiple housing estates and apartment complexes, including Neilstown, Rowlagh, St Marks, Quarryvale (Greenfort and Shancastle), Harelawn and Ronanstown. Some of these areas have struggled with drug crime and related violent incidents. Amenities and businesses Modern Clondalkin is a busy satellite town of Dublin, with a population of 46,813 in 2016. Retail facilities include The Mill Shopping Centre in Clondalkin village, as well as separate branches of Tesco Ireland and Dunnes Stores. Aldi and Lidl also have stores, located on the Fonthill Road, Newlands Cross and New Nangor Road respectively. Petrol filling stations include Topaz on the Boot Road and Esso on the Tower Road service station, Naas Road. The village centre is a base for small businesses including solicitors, restaurants, pubs, hairdressers, pharmacies and more recently a tattoo and body piercing studio. Liffey Valley Shopping Centre is a major shopping mall in the broader locality, while Tallaght's The Square, one of Dublin's three largest retail facilities, is also within reasonable driving distance. Liffey Valley Fitness, a gym located on the Coldcut Road, closed down permanently in 2016 and is expected to re-open in 2018 as a residential development, pending an appeal with An Bord Pleanala. Clondalkin has a branch of South Dublin Libraries in a building which used to house a Carnegie library. North Clondalkin Library, located on the top of Oatfield and Wheatfields estate, opposite the Immaculate Heart of Saint Mary's Church is due to open in late 2019. It also has a post office. Clondalkin also plays host to a large number of online businesses. Near Clondalkin are two prisons ‚Äì Wheatfield Prison and Cloverhill Prison. Microsoft, Google, Arytza, Wyeth, Takeda and Pfizer all have significant data centres and development facilities in the Grange Castle Business Park in Clondalkin. On 7 March 2014 Clondalkin became the 51st \\"Fairtrade town\\" in Ireland. Farmers from Belize and El Salvador, along with local councillors and community representatives, attended a ceremony in Clonburris National School to mark the occasion. Local newspapers covered the event, which was also shown on RT√â 2. This honour was the result of hard work, perseverance, dedication and commitment of sixth class students in Clonburris National School and their teacher, Paula Galvin. Transport Clondalkin is served by public transport to Dublin city centre, to nearby suburbs, and to neighbouring settled areas such as Tallaght. Dublin Bus provide bus routes including the 13, 68, 69, 76, 239, 40 and 151. Many of these run from areas near Clondalkin, such as Rathcoole and Newcastle, into the city centre via Clondalkin. Some services, such as the 76, do not service the city centre. The Luas Red Line runs from the Red Cow interchange park and ride station providing links to the town square in Tallaght and Dublin city centre. However, the Luas station is approximately fifteen to twenty minutes' walk from Clondalkin village. Clondalkin railway station opened on 4 August 1846 and was closed for goods traffic on 9 June 1947. It was reopened during the 1990s for commuter services. Commuter trains are operated by Iarnr√≥d √âireann (Irish Rail) and run between Heuston station in Dublin and Kildare Town in County Kildare. A new station, to replace rather than supplement the previous station, has been built at Fonthill, north of Bawnogue. The original Clondalkin station was demolished in 2008 to facilitate a four-line track, allowing express trains to pass through without affecting local services on the Kildare line. Bus √âireann services stop to collect and set down passengers at Newlands Cross, on the N7 road near Clondalkin. These services have destinations all over the west and south of the country; services to the north do not pass Newlands Cross. Clondalkin is on the preferred route for the proposed Dublin Metro West line, as of the announcement of the preferred route in 2007. The Metro is intended to provide a transport link from Dublin city centre to Dublin Airport which will not have to go through street traffic. It is proposed that the Metro will have stations near Luas and train stations in some cases, including at Clondalkin train station. Media Two local newspapers, the Clondalkin Echo and Clondalkin Gazette, serve the area. The latter is published by Gazette Group Newspapers (part-owned by the Irish Times), and was launched in October 2005.Gazette Group The Clondalkin News is delivered free into households in Clondalkin.

Early life Born in the Walnut Hills district of Cincinnati, Ohio, Hurrell originally studied as a painter with no particular interest in photography.Vieira, M. A.: \\"George Hurrell's Hollywood: Glamour Portraits 1925 ‚Äì 1992\\", 978-0-7624-5039-8. He first began to use photography only as a medium for recording his paintings. After moving to Laguna Beach, California from Chicago, Illinois in 1925 he met many other painters who had connections. One of those connections was Edward Steichen who encouraged him to pursue photography after seeing some of his works. Hurrell also found that photography was a more reliable source of income than painting. Hurrell was an apprentice to Eugene Hutchinson.The Edward Weston Collection His photography was encouraged by his friend aviator Pancho Barnes, who often posed for him. He eventually opened a photographic studio in Los Angeles. Career in Hollywood In the late 1920s, Hurrell was introduced to the actor Ramon Novarro, by Pancho Barnes, and agreed to take a series of photographs of him. Novarro was impressed with the results and showed them to the actress Norma Shearer, who was attempting to mould her wholesome image into something more glamorous and sophisticated in an attempt to land the title role in the movie The Divorcee. She asked Hurrell to photograph her in poses more provocative than her fans had seen before. After she showed these photographs to her husband, MGM production chief Irving Thalberg, Thalberg was so impressed that he signed Hurrell to a contract with MGM Studios, making him head of the portrait photography department. But in 1932, Hurrell left MGM after differences with their publicity head,N.N.: George Hurrell Biography, Hurrell Estate Collection. URL last accessed June 7, 2010. and from then on until 1938 ran his own studio at 8706 Sunset Boulevard.Vieira, M. A.: Hurrell's Hollywood Portraits: The Chapman Collection, . URL last accessed June 7, 2010. Throughout the decade, Hurrell photographed every star contracted to MGM, and his striking black-and-white images were used extensively in the marketing of these stars. Among the performers regularly photographed by him during these years were silent screen star Dorothy Jordan, as well as Myrna Loy, Robert Montgomery, Jean Harlow, Ramon Novarro, Joan Crawford, Clark Gable, Rosalind Russell, Marion Davies, Jeanette MacDonald, Lupe V√©lez, Anna May Wong, Carole Lombard and Norma Shearer, who was said to have refused to allow herself to be photographed by anyone else. He also photographed Greta Garbo at a session to produce promotional material for the movie Romance. The session didn't go well and she never used him again. In the early 1940s Hurrell moved to Warner Brothers Studios photographing, among others Bette Davis, Ann Sheridan, Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, Ida Lupino, Alexis Smith, Lauren Bacall, Humphrey Bogart and James Cagney. Later in the decade he moved to Columbia Pictures where his photographs were used to help the studio build the career of Rita Hayworth. Postwar He left Hollywood briefly to make training films for the First Motion Picture Unit of the United States Army Air Forces. When he returned to Hollywood in the mid-1950s his old style of glamour had fallen from favour. Where he had worked hard to create an idealised image of his subjects, the new style of Hollywood glamour was more earthy and gritty, and for the first time in his career Hurrell's style was not in demand. He moved to New York City and worked for the advertising industry where glamour was still valued. He continued his work for fashion magazines and photographed for print advertisements for several years before returning to Hollywood in the 1960s. After 1970, his most prominent work was as a photographer for album covers. He shot the cover photos for Cass Elliot's self-titled album (1972), Tom Waits' Foreign Affairs (1977), Fleetwood Mac's Mirage (1982), Queen's The Works (1984), Midge Ure's The Gift (1985) and Paul McCartney's Press to Play (1986). Death Hurrell died from complications from bladder cancer shortly after completing a TBS documentary about his life. He died on May 17, 1992. Since his death, his vintage works have continued to appreciate in value and examples of his artistic output can be found in the permanent collections of numerous museums around the world.

The conflict resulted from King John's disastrous wars against King Philip II of France, which led to the collapse of the Angevin Empire, and his subsequent refusal to accept and abide by \\"Magna Carta\\", which he had sealed on 15 June 1215. The rebellious barons, faced with an uncompromising king, turned to King Philip's son, Prince Louis, who then sailed to England with an army despite his father's disapproval, as well as the Pope's, who subsequently excommunicated him. Louis captured Winchester and soon controlled over half of the English kingdom.Alan Harding (1993), England in the Thirteenth Century (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), p. 10 He was proclaimed \\"King of England\\" in London by the barons, although never actually crowned. Louis' ambitions of ruling England faced a major setback in October 1216 when King John's death led to the rebellious barons deserting him in favour of John's nine year-old son, Henry III of England and the war dragged on. Louis' army was finally beaten at the Battle of Lincoln on 20 May 1217. And after a fleet assembled by his wife Blanche of Castile, attempting to bring him French reinforcements, was defeated off the coast of Sandwich on 24 August 1217, he was forced to make peace on English terms. He signed the Treaty of Lambeth and surrendered the few remaining castles he held. The effect of the treaty was that Prince Louis agreed he had never been the legitimate king of England. This formalised the end of the civil war and the departure of the French from England.Arlidge & Judge p. 19 Background King John in June 1215 was forced to put his seal to \\"The Articles of the Barons\\" by a group of powerful barons who could no longer stand John's failed leadership and despotic rule. The king's Great Seal was attached to it on 15 June 1215. In return, the barons renewed their oaths of fealty to King John on 19 July 1215. A formal document to record the agreement was created by the royal chancery on 15 July: this was the original Magna Carta. \\"The law of the land\\" is one of the great watchwords of Magna Carta, standing in opposition to the king's mere will. The Magna Carta of 1215 contained clauses which in theory noticeably reduced the power of the king, such as clause 61, the \\"security clause\\". This clause allowed a group of 25 barons to override the king at any time by way of force, a medieval legal process called distraint that was normal in feudal relationships but had never been applied to a king. After a few months of half-hearted attempts to negotiate in the summer of 1215, open warfare broke out between the rebel barons and the king and his supporters. Course of events =French intervention= The war began over Magna Carta but quickly turned into a dynastic war for the throne of England. The rebel barons, faced with a powerful king, turned to Louis, son and heir apparent of King Philip II of France and grandson-in-law of King Henry II of England. The Norman invasion had occurred only 149 years before, and the relationship between England and France was not so simply adversarial as it later became. The contemporary document called the annals of Waverley sees no contradiction in stating that Louis was invited to invade in order to \\"prevent the realm being pillaged by aliens.\\" At first, in November 1215, Louis simply sent the barons a contingent of knights to protect London. However, even at that stage he also agreed to an open invasion, despite discouragement from his father and from Pope Innocent III. This came in May 1216, when watchmen on the coast of Thanet detected sails on the horizon, and on the next day, the King of England and his armies saw Louis's troops disembark on the coast of Kent. John decided to escape to the Saxon capital of Winchester, and so Louis had little resistance on his march to London. He entered London, also with little resistance, and was openly received by the rebel barons and citizens of London and proclaimed (though not crowned) king at St Paul's Cathedral. Many nobles gathered to give homage to him, including Alexander II of Scotland, who held fiefs in England. Many of John's supporters, sensing a tide of change, moved to support the barons. Gerald of Wales remarked: \\"The madness of slavery is over, the time of liberty has been granted, English necks are free from the yoke.\\" In pursuit of John, Louis led his army south from London on 6 June, arriving the following day in Reigate where he found the castle abandoned. He moved onwards to Guildford Castle on 8 June, which surrendered immediately. Farnham Castle initially closed its gates, but then it too surrendered as the French started to lay siege. He only met resistance when he reached Winchester Castle on 14 June ‚Äì it fell after a ten day siege. Louis' campaign continued and by July about a third of England was under his control. =First siege of Dover= In the meantime, the King of France taunted his son for trying to conquer England without first seizing its key port: Dover. The royal castles at Canterbury and Rochester, their towns, and indeed, most of Kent had already fallen to Louis but when he did move on to Dover Castle on 25 July it was prepared. Its constable, Hubert de Burgh, had a well-supplied garrison of men. The first siege began on 19 July, with Louis taking the high ground to the north of the castle. His men successfully undermined the barbican and attempted to topple the castle gate, but De Burgh's men managed to repel the invaders, blocking the breach in the walls with giant timbers. (After the siege the weak northern gate was blocked and tunnels were built in that area, to St John's Tower, and the new Constable's Gate and Fitzwilliam's Gate.) In the meantime Louis's occupation of Kent was being undermined by a guerrilla force of Wealden archers raised and led by William of Cassingham. After three months spent besieging the castle, and with a large part of his forces diverted by the siege, Louis called a truce on 14 October and soon after returned to London. =Sieges of Windsor and Rochester= Apart from Dover, the only castle to hold out against Louis was that at Windsor, where 60 loyalist knights survived a two-month siege, despite severe damage to the structure of its lower ward (immediately repaired in 1216 by Henry III, who further strengthened the defences with the construction of the western curtain wall, much of which survives today). This is possibly due to its having been already besieged by the barons in 1189, less than 30 years earlier. In 1206, John had spent ¬£115 on repairs to Rochester Castle, and he had even preemptively held it during the year of the negotiations leading up to Magna Carta, but the Charter's terms had forced him to hand it back into the custody of Stephen Langton, Archbishop of Canterbury, in May 1215. The rebel barons had then sent troops under William d'Aubigny to the castle, to whom its constable Reginald de Cornhill opened the castle's gates. Thus, during October 1215 on his marching from Dover to London, John found Rochester in his way and on 11 October began besieging it in person. The rebels were expecting reinforcements from London but John sent fire ships out to burn their route in, the city's bridge over the Medway. Robert Fitzwalter rode out to stop the king, fighting his way onto the bridge but eventually being beaten back into the castle. John also sacked the cathedral, took anything of value and stabled his horses in it, all as a slight to Langton. Orders were then sent to the men of Canterbury. Five siege engines were then erected and work carried out to undermine the curtain wall. By one of these means the king's forces entered and held the bailey in early November, and began attempting the same tactics against the keep, including undermining the south-east tower. The mine-roof was supported by wooden props, which were then set alight using pig-fat. On 25 November 1215 John had sent a writ to the justiciars saying \\"Send to us with all speed by day and night, forty of the fattest pigs of the sort least good for eating so that we may bring fire beneath the castle\\".Contemporary source quoted in Salter (2000). The fire thus created caused one entire corner of the keep to collapse. The rebels withdrew behind the keep's cross-wall but still managed to hold out. A few were allowed to leave the castle but on John's orders had their hands and feet lopped off as an example. Winter was now setting in, and the castle was taken on 30 November by starvation and not by force. John set up a memorial to the pigs and a gallows with the intention of hanging the whole garrison, but one of his captains (Savari de Maul√©on) persuaded him not to hang the rebels since hanging those who had surrendered would set a precedent if John ever surrendered ‚Äì only one man was actually hanged (a young bowman who had previously been in John's service). The remainder of the rebel barons were taken away and imprisoned at various royal-held castles, such as Corfe Castle. Of the siege, the Barnwell chronicler wrote \\"No one alive can remember a siege so fiercely pressed and so manfully resisted\\" and that, after it, \\"There were few who would put their trust in castles\\". The round tower (centre) and two square towers (left and right) of Rochester Castle. =Death of King John= On 18 October 1216, John contracted dysentery, which would ultimately prove fatal.Fryde, Greenway, Porter and Roy, p.37.Warren, pp.254‚Äì5. He died at Newark Castle, Nottinghamshire, and with him the main reason for the fighting. Louis now seemed much more of a threat to baronial interests than John's nine- year-old son, Prince Henry. Eleanor of Brittany, the grown daughter of John's late elder brother Geoffrey, imprisoned by John since 1202, might pose another potential candidate for the crown, but with her claim ignored she remained in prison. Pierre des Roches, Bishop of Winchester, and a number of barons rushed to have the young Henry be crowned as King of England. London was held by Louis (it was his seat of government) and therefore could not be used for this coronation so, on 28 October 1216, they brought the boy from the castle at Devizes to Gloucester Abbey in front of a small attendance presided over by a Papal Legate, Guala Bicchieri (d. 1227, Bishop of Vercelli, papal legate in England 1216‚Äì18). They crowned Henry with a necklace of gold. On 12 November 1216 Magna Carta was reissued in Henry's name with some of the clauses omitted, including clause 61. The revised charter was sealed by the young king's regent William Marshal. A great deal of the country was loyal to Prince Louis, with the southwest of England and the Midlands favouring Henry. Marshal was highly respected and he asked the barons not to blame the child Henry for his father's sins. The prevailing sentiment, helped by self-interest, disliked the idea of depriving a boy of his inheritance. Marshal also promised that he and the other regents would rule by Magna Carta. Furthermore, he managed to get support from the Pope, who had already excommunicated Louis. =Louis' losses= Second Battle of Lincoln in 1217. William Marshal slowly managed to get most barons to switch sides from Louis to Henry and attack Louis. The two opposing sides fought for about a year. On 6 December 1216 Louis took Hertford Castle but allowed the defending knights to leave with their horses and weapons. He then took Berkhamsted Castle in late December, again allowing the royal garrison to withdraw honourably with their horses and weapons. By early 1217, Louis decided to return to France for reinforcements. He had to fight his way to the south coast through loyalist resistance in Kent and Sussex, losing part of his force in an ambush at Lewes, with the remainder pursued to Winchelsea and were only saved from starvation by the arrival of a French fleet. Since the truce had been arranged with Dover, the Dover garrison had repeatedly disrupted Louis's communication with France, and so Louis sailed back to Dover to begin a second siege. The French camp set up outside Dover Castle in anticipation of the new siege was attacked and burned by William of Cassingham just as the fleet carrying the reinforcements arrived. Louis was forced to land at Sandwich and march to Dover, where he began a second siege in earnest on 12 May 1217. This new siege diverted so much of Louis's forces that Marshal and Falkes de Breaut√© were able to attack and heavily defeat pro-Louis barons at Lincoln Castle on 15 May or 20 May 1217, in what became known as the Second Battle of Lincoln. Marshal prepared for a siege against London next. In the meantime, Louis suffered two more heavy defeats, this time at sea, at the Battle of Dover and Battle of Sandwich in the Straits of Dover, this time at the hands of William's ally and Dover's constable Hubert de Burgh. Louis' new reinforcement convoy, under Eustace the Monk, was destroyed, making it nearly impossible for Louis to continue fighting. Aftermath After a year and a half of war, most of the rebellious barons had defected.\\"Kingston, treaty of\\" A Dictionary of British History. Ed. John Cannon. Oxford University Press, 2009 As a result of this and the defeat of the French in 1217, Louis was forced to negotiate. A few of Henry's supporters held out for unconditional surrender, but the Earl of Pembroke successfully argued for the more moderate terms. At the Treaty of Lambeth which was signed on 11 September 1217, Louis had to give up his claim to be the King of England and agreed he had never been the legitimate king. The principal provisions of the treaties were an amnesty for English rebels, nevertheless the barons who had joined Louis were made to pay the French prince 10,000 marks to expedite his withdrawal. Louis surrendered the few remaining castles that he had held, and exhorted to his allies; Scottish and Welsh troops under Alexander II and Llywelyn the Great respectively to lay down their arms.

Wynne, Jr. Angus Gilchrist Wynne Jr. (January 9, 1914 ‚Äì March 12, 1979) was an American businessman. He is the founder of Wynnewood Shopping Center and community development in Oak Cliff, a residential and commercial district south of downtown Dallas. He also developed the Six Flags Over Texas, Six Flags Over Georgia, and Six Flags St. Louis theme parks in Texas, Georgia, and Missouri. He was CEO of Great Southwest Corp and Great Southwest Industrial District in Arlington, Texas. Angus Wynne Jr. later started Wynne Enterprises, conceptualizing one of the first water amusement parks in Galveston, Texas, but died before his dream could be developed. Angus Jr. was the son of Angus G. Wynne Sr. of Texas and Nemo Shelmire Wynne, born in The Plains, Upper East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana. His father and grandfather practiced law in Wills Point until his family moved to Dallas around 1928. Angus G. Wynne Sr. was the first President of the State Bar of Texas. Family His brother Bedford S. Wynne, was one of the initial owners and founders of the Dallas Cowboys professional football franchise, along with Clint Murchison Jr. His son Angus G Wynne III is the owner of Wynne Entertainment in Dallas and has been a producer of music events since 1968. His son Shannon Shelmire Wynne is an American restaurateur living in Dallas, TX. He is best known for the Flying Saucer Draught Emporium, 8.0 Bar, Flying Fish, Meddlesome Moth[1] and others. Education Wynne attended Highland Park High School and graduated from there in 1931. Wynne attended the Lawrenceville School, then Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Va. from 1934‚Äì1935, before receiving a B.A. from University of Texas at Austin in 1938. During their time at UT, Wynne and his brother Bedford S. Wynne became brothers of the Texas Alpha chapter of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, as was their father Angus Wynne Sr., one of the chapter's founders in 1904. He worked on Texas oil fields from 1938 to 1940 when he received an ensign's commission in the Navy. In the Navy, he was awarded six service stars for service in the European and Asiatic theaters during WWII. Six Flags Over Texas Following a visit to the recently opened Disneyland in Anaheim, California, Wynne decided that his home state of Texas should have a local park for entertainment. Planning for such a place began in 1959, under the leadership of Wynne and the Great Southwest Corporation, along with the backing of various New York City investors. Construction on the park, and its next door neighbor, the Great Southwest Industrial Park, began in August 1960. Wynne first intended to name the park \\"Texas Under Six Flags\\" until his wife notified him that \\"Texas ain't under nothing.\\" The \\"six flags\\" originally represented the six countries that have governed Texas: France, Spain, Mexico, The Republic of Texas, The Confederate States of America, and the United States of America. Wynne subsequently expanded Six Flags in 1967 with a second original park, Six Flags Over Georgia, which is located just outside Atlanta, Georgia, and finally Six Flags over Mid America (now Six Flags St. Louis), in Eureka Missouri, just outside St. Louis in 1971. The Six Flags company eventually acquired numerous other properties and is currently the world's largest regional theme park chain. With the significant cost of developing a park from the ground up becoming prohibitive, the company began acquiring parks with significant potential, but to date, had been less successful than those of Six Flags. AstroWorld, built by Judge Roy Hofheinz in Houston, Texas, was the first park to be acquired in 1975. Two years later, the company went on to purchase a New Jersey park developed by the Hardwicke Companies and designed by Warner LeRoy (son of Wizard of Oz director, Mervyn LeRoy), called Great Adventure. The last park that Wynne would see acquired in his lifetime under the Six Flags name was California's Magic Mountain (outside Los Angeles) in 1979. Wynne died that same year and although he was no longer associated with the company at the time of his death, Six Flags would eventually acquire numerous other properties and become the world's largest regional theme park chain. Civic Involvement Angus Wynne's civic involvement included developmental work for the University of Texas, Baylor University Medical Center and Children's Medical Center of Dallas. He also worked with the Cotton Bowl Council, the State Fair of Texas and the National Conference of Christians and Jews. Honors State Highway 360 through Arlington is officially designated the Angus G. Wynne Jr. Freeway although it is rarely referred to as such.

Founded in 1997 by Gerry Ford, currently the company runs more than 1000 coffee houses in eleven countries: the UK, Ireland, Sweden, Poland, Cyprus, Croatia, Turkey, the UAE, Oman, and the United States. In 2009 Caff√® Nero bought and opened its own coffee roastery, which supplies the coffee to all its coffee houses worldwide. \\"Caff√® Nero\\" is Italian for \\"black coffee\\". History In 1997 Gerry Ford led a small group of investors in the purchase of 5 central London shops with the name Caffe Nero from Ian Semp who established the name in 1990. Gerry Ford subsequently redesigned those units and founded the Caff√® Nero brand as recognized today. At the same time the signature coffee house blend - Classico - was introduced, and has gone on to receive awards for its quality. The Classico blend is still served in every store today. In March 2001 Caff√® Nero joined the London Stock Exchange under the symbol CFN. In early 2007, the company was the subject of a management buy-out by the newly formed Rome Bidco Ltd and taken private. Since 2007, the company expanded to Turkey in 2007, the UAE in 2009, Poland in 2012, Cyprus in 2013, and Ireland and the United States in 2014, Croatia in 2017, Oman in 2018 and Sweden Caff√® Nero's parent company is based in Luxembourg. In June 2016, the Caff√® Nero Group completed the purchase of the Harris + Hoole brand from Tesco which consisted of 43 sites., and in January 2019 the Group expanded further by completing the purchase of the majority shareholding of the 92 strong coffee chain Coffee#1 from SA Brains. In 2013, Caff√® Nero's coffee was rated best tasting among five major UK brands by experts at the independent consumer magazine Which? Products The company has a reward scheme for customers. Each time a coffee is purchased, the customer's loyalty card is stamped with the 'Nero Coffee Bean Logo'. Once a card has nine stamps, the bearer is entitled to a free drink. Caff√® Nero also offers double reward stamps for every customer who uses a reusable cup in its stores Caff√® Nero participates in numerous waste and recycling initiatives including the London First Mile scheme which collects coffee grounds and converts it into bio-fuel Controversies Caff√® Nero has not paid any corporation tax in the UK since 2007 on sales of ¬£2 billion and has been subject to ongoing criticism, although the BBC has reported that \\"there is no suggestion that Caffe Nero has done anything illegal\\" and that \\"Caffe Nero has previously rejected accusations that its complex corporate structure involving various holding companies is designed to avoid corporation tax.\\" Paul Monaghan, chief executive of the Fair Tax Mark campaign group, said the firm‚Äôs tax arrangements were ‚Äúparasitic‚Äù and ‚Äúinsulting to the intelligence of the British people‚Äù A handful of the company's stores have either had planning permission controversies and/or enforcement action taken. One town accused Caff√® Nero of \\"bully-boy tactics\\" following the opening of several stores in the United Kingdom, without the required planning permission. However, all 11 stores where there have been planning permission issues have subsequently been granted planning permission. In May 2015, the company said that they will stop serving milk from farms in Gloucestershire's badger cull areas. On 29 May 2015, the company said: \\"Caff√® Nero has instructed its partners supplying to stores which are situated around the cull zone areas to supply milk from farms outside of the zone. On 7 July 2015, rats were videoed scurrying along the floor and counter in their Donegall Square West unit in Belfast, despite having previously been awarded a four out of possible five star rating by inspectors from Belfast City Council. Having been notified of the incident, the store was closed for a full investigation and has subsequently reopened; the source of the infestation was an adjacent disused building. A 2017 study by the BBC found trace amounts of faecal bacteria in Caff√® Nero's iced drinks, alongside those of Starbucks and Costa Coffee. In June 2018 Polish State Sanitary Inspectorate and media reported 63 adults and 10 children having been poisoned (21 of whom were hospitalized) after eating salmonella-contaminated cakes served in a number of Caff√® Neros in Warsaw, Cracow and Wroc≈Çaw.

He was pivotal in the transformation of Indiana University from a small, locally oriented college into a world-class institution of higher learning through expanded enrollment, recruitment of new faculty, construction of new buildings, new program offerings, and campus beautification projects. He remained steadfast in his support of IU's faculty and students, especially in the areas of academic freedom and civil rights. James H. Capshew, \\"Encounters with Genius Loci: Herman Wells at/and/of Indiana University,\\" Perspectives on the History of Higher Education 28 (2011), 161‚Äì91. Wells began his career in banking, but served the university in a variety of faculty and administrative capacities during his seventy-year career at IU Bloomington: instructor and assistant professor, department of economics (1930‚Äì35; dean and professor of administration, school of business administration (1935‚Äì37); acting president (1937‚Äì38); president (1938‚Äì62); university chancellor (1962‚Äì2000); interim president (1968); and chairman of the board of the Indiana University Foundation (1969‚Äì72), as well as other leadership roles at the IU Foundation. Wells served in numerous other appointed positions: economic analyst for the U.S. State Department's Office of Foreign Economic Cooperation in Washington, D.C. (1943‚Äì44); cultural affairs adviser to the U.S. Military Government in West Germany (1947‚Äì48); U.S. delegate to the Twelfth Session of the United Nations General Assembly (1957); and adviser to the Ministry of Pakistan (1959), among other appointments. Wells was a member and often assumed a leadership role in several educational foundations, including the Education and World Affairs organization (1962‚Äì70), the Carnegie Foundation, the American Council on Education (1944‚Äì45), and the National Commission on Humanities (1964‚Äì65), among others. He was a member of presidential committees on overseas voluntary activities and U.S.-Soviet trade relations, as well as serving on several boards of directors, such as the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis (1936‚Äì71) and the Lilly Endowment (1972‚Äì2000). A recipient of numerous honors and awards, including twenty-eight honorary degrees, Wells received many tributes to his long career. IU student scholarships and student recognition awards, as well as memorials on the IU Bloomington campus and the main campus library are named in his honor. Wells was also the subject of a PBS documentary film. His autobiography, Being Lucky: Reminiscences and Reflections, was published in 1980.  Early life  Herman B Wells was born on June 7, 1902, in Jamestown, Boone County, Indiana. He was the only child of Joseph Granville Wells, a bank cashier and a former teacher and elementary school principal, and Anna Bernice (Harting) Wells, a former teacher.Capshew, \\"Making Herman B Wells,\\" p. 371. Herman was not given a middle name, only the letter \\"B\\" not followed by a period. (A family tradition on his mother's side had middle names beginning with that letter, but Wells' parents could not agree on a middle name for him.) Wells's father committed suicide in 1948; his mother died in 1973. Wells grew up in Jamestown, attended a local Methodist church, and played alto horn in the Jamestown Boys' Band.Capshew, \\"Making Herman B Wells,\\" p. 364. In 1917 the family moved to Lebanon, Indiana, the seat of government for Boone County, when Joseph was appointed deputy county treasurer. After school and on Saturdays, Herman helped out at a local bank where his father worked.Capshew, \\"Making Herman B Wells,\\" pp. 366, 369. Education Wells graduated from Lebanon High School in 1920 and was voted \\"Funniest\\" and \\"Best All-Around Boy\\" his senior year.Gugan and St. Clair, eds., p. 370. Wells served as treasurer for the high school's yearbook and was involved in the school's newspaper, theater productions, and various fundraisers. After graduation Wells worked at a bank in nearby Whitestown, Indiana, to earn money for college. Although Wells's parents were supportive of his desire to continue his education, they had limited financial resources to pay for his college tuition and other expenses. Wells initially enrolled at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign in 1920, but transferred to Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana, in 1921 at the beginning of his sophomore year. Although his father objected to the move because Illinois had a strong business school, Wells convinced his father that the transfer to IU would be a good idea, especially since he intended to work in Indiana after graduation and already had friends at IU. Wells also pointed out that the connections he developed at IU would be useful to his future career.Capshew, \\"Making Herman B Wells,\\" pp. 371‚Äì72. In his autobiography, Being Lucky: Reminiscences and Reflections (1980), Wells described his early impressions of IU: \\"It was a simple place in those days, with not yet three thousand students, but it had great charm and appeal for me.\\" Wells was active in campus life as an IU undergraduate, he pledged Sigma Nu fraternity, lived in its chapter house at 322 East Kirkwood, and became involved in campus activities. Wells served as the fraternity chapter's treasurer and was elected as his fraternity chapter's president (eminent commander) in his senior year. He was also treasurer of IU's Union Board, a student organization established in 1909. In addition, Wells played in IU's band and frequently visited the Book Nook, a local hangout that he described as \\"a remarkably fertile cultural and political breeding place in the manner of the famous English coffee houses.\\"Wells, p. 33. Wells earned a Bachelor of Science degree in commerce (business) in 1924. After college graduation Wells spent the next two years (1924‚Äì26) working as an assistant bank cashier at the First National Bank of Lebanon, Indiana, where his father worked as a cashier, and living at home with his parents, before continuing his education at IU Bloomington. Wells earned Master of Arts degree in economics from IU in 1927. His master's thesis, \\"Service Charges for Small or So-Called Country Banks,\\" was published in The Hoosier Banker in 1927.Capshew, \\"The Campus as a Pedagogical Agent,\\" p. 186. Wells began doctoral studies in economics at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, but his schooling ended in 1928, when he took a job with the Indiana Bankers Association.Wells, p. 447.  Early career  In 1928 Wells left his graduate studies at Wisconsin to take a job as a field secretary for the Indiana Bankers Association, where he remained until 1931. As part of his work at the IBA, Wells travelled throughout Indiana visiting local banks, attending meetings, and working closely with bankers to conduct research on the history of Indiana's financial institutions, banking regulations, and the causes of bank failures. He also wrote a monthly column, \\"Hoosier Highways,\\" for The Hoosier Banker, the IBA's journal.Wells, pp. 44‚Äì45, 52. In addition to working for the IBA, Wells became an instructor in IU's Department of Economics and Sociology in 1930. By 1931 Wells had become the director of research for the state government's Study Commission for Indiana Financial Institutions, in addition to his jobs at the IBA and IU. Wells was the main author of the commission's report that recommended far- reaching reforms to Indiana's financial regulations and policies, many of which were adopted by the Indiana General Assembly in 1933 had a major impact on the state's banking laws.Wells, pp. 55‚Äì60.Capshew, \\"The Campus as a Pedagogical Agent,\\" p. 187. Wells established a home base at Woodburn House, a private residence he leased on North College Avenue in Bloomington, during the early years of his career. He also spent time in Indianapolis, frequently staying at the Claypool Hotel or the Indianapolis Athletic Club, and at Nashville in Brown County, Indiana.Capshew, \\"Home Design for Indiana University\\", p. 30.Wells, p. 91.Capshew, Herman B Wells, p. 73. In 1933 Wells took a two-year leave of absence from his appointment as an assistant professor at IU. Between 1933 and 1935, when he returned to IU, Wells worked three full-time jobs. He was secretary of the Indiana Commission for Financial Institutions, as well as a bank supervisor, Division of Banks and Trust Companies, and supervisor of the Division of Research and Statistics at the newly created Indiana Department of Financial Institutions, a state agency that originated in the study commission's recommendations.Wells, pp. 60‚Äì61.  Academic career  A statue erected in honor of Wells and placed at Herman B Wells Plaza on the campus of Indiana University Bloomington =IU instructor and dean= Wells began his seventy-year career at IU in 1930, when he joined the economics faculty as an instructor at the Bloomington campus. This position led to an assistant professorship in economics at the university in 1933. Wells accepted the job, but took a two-year leave of absence to work for the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions before returning to IU. In 1935 IU's president, William Lowe Bryan, appointed Wells as dean of the School of Business Administration, which later became the Indiana University Kelley School of Business. Wells, who was Bryan's prot√©g√©e, would succeed him as the university's president in 1937, despite rumors that Indiana governor Paul McNutt, a former dean of the law school, was interested in the position.\\"In Mid-Pasage,\\" volume II of Capshew, Herman B Wells, pp. 91‚Äì92. =IU president= In 1937, two years after his selection as dean of IU's business school, Wells was offered the position of acting president following Bryan's unexpected resignation. Wells accepted on the condition that he not be considered for the permanent presidency of the university, because he did not feel he was adequately prepared to take on the president's responsibilities.Wells, p. 94. Wells became interim president effective July 1, 1937.Capshew, Herman B Wells, pp. 110‚Äì11. McNutt, who was rumored to be the front-runner for the permanent IU president's post, withdrew his name from consideration, and on March 22, 1938, the IU board of trustees unanimously elected Wells from its remaining slate of candidates as the university's eleventh president. Wells was inaugurated on December 1, 1938, as the youngest state university president in the nation. Wells held this post until his retirement in 1962.Capshew, Herman B Wells, p. 97.Clark, \\"In Mid-Pasage,\\" volume II of Indiana University: Midwestern Pioneer, pp. 403‚Äì05. Woodburn House in Bloomington, where Wells lived early in his IU presidency. Although Wells could have moved into in the President's House on campus, he remained at Woodburn House, his residence close to downtown Bloomington, for twenty-five years. Woodburn House allowed him more privacy, away from campus life. James Woodburn, the owner of Woodburn House, donated the residence to the university in 1940. Bryan, who became IU's president emeritus, continued to reside at the President's House on campus until his death in 1953. Wells lived in the President's House (later known as Bryan House) from 1957 until his retirement as IU's president in 1962. After Wells moved to the President's House, Woodburn House continued to be used as a private residence until the IU Alumni Association assumed management of the property in 1976 and converted it as a place to entertain guests.Capshew, \\"Home Design for Indiana University,\\" pp. 29, 31.Wells, pp. 92‚Äì93.Capshew, Herman B Wells, pp. 257‚Äì59. Indiana University fared much better than most state schools thanks to the entrepreneurship dean and president Wells. He collaborated with Frederick L. Hovde, the president of IU's cross state rival, Purdue; together they approached the Indiana delegation to Congress, indicating their highest priorities. For Wells, it was to build a world-class music school, replacing dilapidated facilities. As a result of these efforts, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) built one of finest facilities in the country. He added matching funds from the state legislature, and opened a full-scale fund- raising campaign among alumni and the business community. In 1942, Wells reported that \\"The past five years have been the greatest single period of expansion in the physical plant of the University in its entire history. In this period 15 new buildings have been constructed.Herman B Wells, Being Lucky (1980), pp 155-69Thomas D Clark, Indiana University: Midwestern Pioneer volume 3: Years of Fulfillment (1977), p 168. During his twenty-five years as IU's president, Wells recruited new, research-oriented faculty members to the university. When Wells was serving as acting president he travelled in excess of in one year as he sought to attract bright, young scholars, as well as established faculty. Wells was successful at attracting notable research scientists such as behavioral scientist B. F. Skinner, geneticist Tracy Sonneborn, and Nobel Prize-winning geneticist Hermann J. Muller, among others. Another one of Wells's early efforts was to increase emphasis on the arts by adding more courses in music, fine arts, theater, and drama, and planning new cultural arts buildings on the Bloomington campus. Wells is also credited with bringing together students, faculty, staff, state government officials, and the public in an effort to develop IU as an institution of higher learning.Gugin and St. Clair, eds., p. 369.Capshew, \\"Home Design for Indiana University,\\" p. 31. In addition, Wells was pivotal in expanding the university's global perspective, which included expansion of IU's international study programs.Capshew, \\"The Campus as a Pedagogical Agent,\\" p. 179. Following World War II, Wells oversaw the largest increase in the student population in the history of the university, nearly tripling the student body from 11,000 students statewide in 1938 to 31,000 in 1962. Wells became regularly involved in student activities, taking an active interest in the students' lives, and was popular among the student body. He frequently took walks around campus, where he often engaged in conversations with as many students as possible.Capshew, Herman B Wells, p. 253. Wells also worked to end segregation at the university and to make his views known that racism would no longer be tolerated. For example, Wells ended segregated seating at IU Commons, the student dining facilities in the campus's Indiana Memorial Union building.Wells, p. 216. He also worked with IU's black alumni and the university's college coach, Branch McCracken, to recruit Bill Garrett, the first African American to play as a regular player on IU's basketball team. (Garrett was also the first African American to regularly play on a Big Ten Conference basketball team.Capshew, Herman B Wells, p. 177.) In 1947, when the local barbers union refused to cut black students' hair in their off-campus shops during regular business hours, Wells leased the Indiana Memorial Union's barbershop to a barber who agreed to accept black and white students as patrons. Soon, the local barbers changed their position and cut black students's hair during regular business hours as well.Wells, p. 219.Capshew, Herman B Wells, p. 176. In addition to supporting IU students, Wells helped to advance academic freedom for IU faculty, especially when Alfred Kinsey, an IU professor during Wells's tenure at the university, came under heavy scrutiny and criticism for his studies in human sexuality in the late 1940s and early 1950s. As a strong advocate of intellectual freedom, Wells staunchly supported Kinsey's controversial sex research and withstood sharp criticism following the publication of Kinsey's landmark studies on sexual behavior.Price, p. 142. \\"I had early made up my mind that a university that bows to the wishes of a person, group, or segment of society is not free and that a state university in particular cannot expect to command the support of the public if it is the captive of any group,\\" said Wells.Wells, p. 179. While Wells was serving as IU's president, the university landholdings increased tenfold through acquisition of real estate to reach , its approximate, present-day size.Capshew, \\"Home Design for Indiana University,\\" p. 37. In addition, numerous buildings were constructed on campus the Bloomington campus. Major projects included construction of the IU Auditorium, which opened on March 22, 1941, as the cornerstone of the university's Fine Arts Plaza. The plaza was later expanded to include the Lilly Library, dedicated in 1969, and the Showalter Fountain, designed by sculptor and IU faculty member Robert Laurent and dedicated on October 22, 1961.Capshew, \\"Home Design for Indiana University,\\" p. 35. Wells also worked with state government officials to transfer ownership of Thomas Hart Benton's Indiana murals, which were initially created for and displayed at the Chicago Century of Progress International Exposition (World's Fair) in 1933. Ownership of the murals was formally transferred to IU in 1938. The murals were incorporated into the design of the new IU Auditorium and installed in time for the building's dedication in March 1941.Capshew, \\"The Campus as a Pedagogical Agent,\\" pp. 192‚Äì93, 194. Despite rapid expansion and increasing demands for space and physical plant improvements, Wells remained a staunch proponent of the environment. He strongly advocated preserving trees and developed guidelines to establish a series of green spaces throughout the campus. Wells once said, \\"To cut a tree unnecessarily has long been an act of treason against our heritage and the loyalty, love, and effort of our predecessors who have preserved it for us.\\" As a direct result of these efforts, the IU campus at Bloomington is often considered one of the top five most beautiful campuses in the nation. During his tenure as university president, Wells read and personally signed each diploma the university issued, a total of 62,621 diplomas, frequently adding personal notes. As Wells explained during his final IU commencement address as its president in 1962: =IU chancellor= Following Wells' retirement as IU's president in 1962, at the age of sixty, the IU board of trustees created a new post of university chancellor especially for him. He accepted the appointment and held this honorary title until his death in 2000. His main roles in the post were special projects, fundraising, conferring with private donors, administrative duties, attending cultural and athletic events, and acting as senior adviser to the university.Well, pp. 433‚Äì35. During his years as chancellor, Wells also wrote his autobiography, Being Lucky: Reminiscences and Reflections (1980). Chancellor Wells continued to support the arts, including creation of IU's Musical Arts Center, a performance space that opened in 1972, and the installation of Peau Rouge Indiana, an Alexander Calder stabile (abstract sculpture) in front of the MAC. In addition, the I. M. Pei architectural firm designed the IU Art Museum, dedicated in 1982, to complete the structures on the campus's Fine Arts Plaza, whose development began during Wells's tenure as IU's president.Capshew, \\"Home Design for Indiana University, \\" pp. 37‚Äì38. For a brief period, from July to November 1968, Wells also served as IU's interim president following the resignation of Elvis Jacob Stahr Jr., Well's successor to the university's presidency.Capshew, Herman B Wells, pp. 305, 307, 314. =IU Foundation leader= During his tenure as IU's president and university chancellor, Wells also had a leadership role at the IU Foundation, the fundraising division of the university. From 1937 to 1962 Wells held the dual offices of the foundation's chairman of the board and president. He continued as the foundation's president and vice chairman of the foundation's board while serving as the university chancellor.Wells, p. 167.Capshew, Herman B Wells, p. 344. Public service Aside from his activities at IU, Wells remained active in public service throughout his long career. In 1943‚Äì44 Wells worked for the U.S. State Department's Office of Foreign Economic Cooperation in Washington, D.C.. In 1944‚Äì45 he served as chair of the American Council on Education, and in 1946 Wells spent three months in Greece observing its democratic elections. In 1947‚Äì48 Wells was a cultural advisor to the allied military government in Germany following World War II. He also assisted in establishing the Free University of Berlin. In 1957 Wells was a delegate to the Twelfth Session of the United Nations General Assembly. Wells served as chairman of the board of the Education and World Affairs organization from 1962 until 1970. He was also a consultant in higher education and traveled the world on behalf of IU's international education projects.Capshew, Herman B Wells, pp. 299, 303. Art collector Wells began collecting antiques during his early years in Bloomington and continued to collect art and antiques throughout his life. Most of his collection was donated to various IU organizations on the Bloomington campus. In 2001 the IU Art Museum at Bloomington opened a temporary exhibition that featured some of Wells's collections.Capshew, Herman B Wells, pp. 375‚Äì77. One of the German paintings in the exhibition, Flagellation of Christ (ca. 1480s), also known as Geisselung Cristi, was subsequently returned to the Jagdschloss Grunewald, a small museum in Berlin, Germany. The oil-on-oil painting is attributed to the fifteenth-century German master of the Saint Goar altar. Wells donated the work to the IU Art Museum in 1985. According to IU, Wells purchased the late fifteenth-century painting in good faith from a London art gallery in 1967 and was unaware if its previous history. In 2004 representatives from Stiftung Preussische Schl√∂sser und G√§rten Berlin-Brandenburg (Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation Berlin-Brandenburg) informed the IU Art Museum that Allied soldiers had seized the painting from the Jagdschloss Grunewald museum in Berlin during the summer of 1945, at the end of World War II. In 2006, following extensive research of the painting's provenance, the IU Art Museum agreed to return the painting to Berlin, stating it could not \\"ethically retain this painting, which was unlawfully removed from the Jagdschloss Grunewald in 1945, in our collection.\\" The painting remained at the IU Art Museum until 2010, while the Jagdschloss Grunewald was undergoing renovations. Later years Despite ill health, failing eyesight, and hearing loss as he approached his ninety-eighth birthday in 2000, Wells continued to maintain an office in Owen Hall on the IU Bloomington campus. Following his retirement as IU's president, Wells resided at a home across the street from IU's Main Library on East Tenth Street that he had purchased in 1962.Capshew, \\"Home Design for Indiana University,\\" pp. 38‚Äì39. Wells donated the home to the university with the condition that he be allowed to live there for the remainder of his life. In addition to maintaining his Tenth Street home in Bloomington, Wells purchased a condominium in Bloomington's Meadowood retirement community when he was in his eighties. Wells rarely stayed overnight at his Meadowood property, preferring instead to use it as a woodland retreat and guesthouse.Capshew, Herman B Wells, p. 338. Death and legacy Wells died at home in Bloomington on March 18, 2000, three months prior to his ninety-eighth birthday. His funeral was held at the First United Methodist Church in Bloomington on March 22, 2000, sixty-two years after his selection as president of the university.Capshew, Herman B Wells, p. 363. \\"A Celebration of Life: Remembering Herman B Wells,\\" his public memorial service, was held at the IU Auditorium on April 5, 2000.Capshew, Herman B Wells, p. 366‚Äì67. Wells's remains are interred at Jamestown, Indiana, where he had spent his boyhood.Capshew, \\"Home Design for Indiana University,\\" p. 39. Wells had no children and never married, but he maintained an extensive network of contacts among friends and professional colleagues, as well as IU students, alumni, and faculty members. His contributions to IU were forged through his nearly eighty-year association with the university, beginning as a student in 1921 and continuing after he joined the faculty in 1930. During his years as president (1937‚Äì62) and university chancellor (1962‚Äì2000), Wells brought IU \\"to the front ranks of American research universities\\" through expanded enrollment, recruitment of new faculty, construction of new buildings, new program offerings, campus beautification projects, and steadfast support of its faculty and students. Wells also helped transform IU into \\"a cosmopolitan center of learning with an international reputation\\" and strengthened IU's emphasis on research, cultivated the arts, expanded IU's international programs and supported academic freedom. As Wells reflected on his twenty-five years as IU's president, he remarked:  Positions and appointments Wells held numerous faculty and administrative positions at IU Bloomington: * Instructor, Department of Economics, 1930‚Äì33 * Assistant Professor, Department of Economics, 1933‚Äì35 (on leave) * Dean, School of Business Administration, 1935‚Äì37 * Professor of Administration, School of Business Administration, 1935‚Äì72 * Acting President, 1937‚Äì38 * President, 1938‚Äì62 * University Chancellor, 1962‚Äì2000 * University Chancellor and Interim President, 1968 * Chairman of the Board, IU Foundation, 1969‚Äì72Wells, pp. 447‚Äì48. * President, IU Foundation, 1962‚Äì69 * Chairman of the Executive Committee, Indiana University Foundation, 1972‚Äì75 * Vice Chairman and Chairman of the Executive Committee, IU Foundation, 1975‚Äì88 * Vice Chairman, IU Foundation, 1988‚Äì95 * First Vice Chairman, IU Foundation, 1988‚Äì95 * Professor Emeritus of Business Administration, 1972‚Äì2000 Appointments included: * Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of TeachingWells, p. 137. * American Council on Education * Association of Land Grant Colleges and UniversitiesWells, p. 448. * National Association of State Universities * Economic analyst for the U.S. Department of State, Office of Foreign Economic Cooperation, in Washington, D.C., 1943‚Äì44 * Cultural affairs adviser to the U.S. Military Government in West Germany, 1947‚Äì48 * U.S. delegate to the 12th General Assembly of the United Nations, 1957 * Adviser to the Ministry of Pakistan, 1959Wells, p. 451. * Head of the U.S. delegation to Bangkok for the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Preparatory Commission on University Problems, 1960 * Vice chairman, National Commission on Humanities, 1964‚Äì65Wells, p. 452. * Member, President's Committee on U.S.-Soviet Trade Relations, 1965 * Director, Indiana Judicial Study Commission 1965-68 * Member, President's Special Committee on Overseas Voluntary Activities, 1967Wells, p. 453. * Board of Directors, Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis, 1936‚Äì71 (Chairman, 1940‚Äì71) * Member of the Board of Directors, Lilly Endowment, 1972‚Äì2000 Honors and awards Wells received many honors and awards throughout his career, including the following: * Named one of \\"America's Ten Outstanding Young Men of 1939\\" by the U.S. Junior Chamber of CommerceWells, p. 456. * Gold Medal Award recipient, International Benjamin Franklin Society, 1959 * Received Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1960 * Received National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's Brotherhood Award, 1961‚Äì62 * Thailand Government Award of Commander of the Most Exalted Order of the White Elephant in 1962 * Caleb B.

Tributes The main library of Indiana University Bloomington has been named after Herman B Wells since 2005 * Since 1962, The Herman B Wells Senior Recognition Award is given annually to an IU senior who exhibits a strong academic record, as well as leadership and service to the IU Bloomington campus.Capshew, Herman B Wells, p. 285. * On June 15, 1973, the International Astronomical Union confirmed that minor planet 1721 (approximately in diameter) within the constellation of Leo was officially named \\"Wells.\\"Capshew, Herman B Wells, p. 321. * The Herman B Wells Scholar Program, which the IU Foundation established when Wells was in his eighties, provides four-year academic scholarships to a selective group of IU Bloomington students. The program's first group of scholarship recipients arrived on campus in 1990.Capshew, Herman B Wells, p. 346. * In 1991, the Indiana University School of Medicine named their pediatric research center in honor of Wells. * The Vision of Herman B Wells (1993), a PBS documentary of Well's life, was directed by Eugene \\"Gino\\" Brancolini.Capshew, Herman B Wells, pp. 352‚Äì53. * On October 21, 2000, a bronze statue of Wells by Tuck Langland, a professor of art at IU's South Bend campus, was unveiled in the historic, Old Crescent area of the Bloomington campus. The life-sized statue portrays Wells in middle age, seated on a park bench.

The university had to wait five years after Wells's death in order to name the library in his honor due to a university policy that Wells had put in place when he was chair of IU's naming committee. The policy required sufficient time to pass before naming a building in order to determine whether the name would endure or fall out of fashion. A bronze bust of Wells by sculptor Marc Mellon is installed in the library's lobby.Capshew, Herman B Wells, pp. 379‚Äì81. * Herman Wells is portrayed in the 2004 movie Kinsey.

It contains two or three species of closely related shrubs commonly known as sun opener or shrubby yellowcrest. They are native to the Americas, from northern Argentina north to the southernmost United States (southern Texas). The leaves are 2-5 cm long and 1 cm broad, entire, and variably arranged alternate, opposite or whorled on the stems. All species produce five-petaled yellow flowers. The plants have a history of medicinal use in a variety of American cultures. Several pharmacologically active alkaloids have been detected in the plants. The generic names honours German physician Ernst Ludwig Heim (1747‚Äì1834). Species The genus contains three species. They are similar to the extent that expert knowledge is required to differentiate between specimens of the different species. The alkaloid contents of specimens of all three species has been studied, and although similar, they have been found to be chemically distinct. =Heimia myrtifolia= Heimia myrtifolia is a shrub growing to 1 m tall. The yellow flowers are 5 petaled and 1 cm in diameter.

The yellow flowers are 5 petaled and 2‚Äì3 cm in diameter. The leaves are approximately 1 cm wide and 3‚Äì5 cm long. =Heimia montana=  Secondary metabolites  The alkaloid content is similar between the species in the genus.

This controversial attribution of effects appears to be traceable back to a publication by J. B. Calder√≥n in 1896 who wrote that it was said to possess a \\"curious and unique physiological action ... people drinking either a decoction or the juice of the plant have a pleasant drunkenness ... all objects appear yellow and the sounds of bells, human voices or any other reach their ears as if coming from a long distance.\\"Erowid referencesEstudio sobre el arbusto llamado sinieuichi. Anales del Instituto M√©dico Nacional 2, 36-42 Calder√≥n actually tested the plant and did not experience any noticeable effects. Through a series of exaggerating and dramatizing citations, especially by Victor A. Reko in the first half of the last century, the plant became known as a hallucinogen despite that psychoactive properties of the plant have never been demonstrated. The mildly psychoactive effects described in the original publication have therefore been attributed to a sedative principle or unknown other contents of the brew or, simply, to its alcohol content. In 1926, Reko observed that the native people of Mexico also called the stem and bark of Erythrina coralloides, the bark of Piscidia erythrina, and the seeds of Rhynochosia praecatoria by the name of sinicuichi, which may have contributed to the scientific confusion. Cultivation Seeds of H. salicifolia The species make attractive ornamental plants, flowering in late summer. Although only growing as a shrub in subtropical climates, it can also be grown as a herbaceous perennial in colder areas where the above-ground growth is killed by winter cold. The plants produce very many tiny seeds which are easily cultivated. Both species prefer well-drained soil with a good supply of water.

Bell, after having been ordered to undergo compulsory sterilization for purportedly being \\"feeble-minded.\\" The surgery, carried out while Buck was an inmate of the Virginia State Colony for Epileptics and Feebleminded, took place under the authority of the Racial Integrity Act of 1924, part of the Commonwealth of Virginia's eugenics program. Early life Carrie Buck was born in Charlottesville, Virginia, the first of three children born to Emma Buck; she was soon joined by half-sister Doris Buck and half-brother Roy Smith. Little is known about Emma Buck except that she was poor and married to Frederick Buck, who abandoned her early in their marriage. Emma was committed to the Virginia State Colony for Epileptics and Feebleminded after being accused of immorality, prostitution, and having syphilis. After her birth, Carrie Buck was placed with foster parents, John and Alice Dobbs. She attended public school, where she was noted to be an average student. When she was in sixth grade, the Dobbses removed her to have her help with housework. At 17, Buck became pregnant as a result of being raped by Alice Dobbs' nephew, Clarence Garland. On January 23, 1924, the Dobbses had her committed to the Virginia Colony for Epileptics and Feeble- Minded on the grounds of feeblemindedness, incorrigible behavior, and promiscuity. On March 28, 1924, she gave birth to a daughter, Vivian. Since she had been declared mentally incompetent to raise her child, the Dobbses adopted the baby. Her commitment may have been due to the family's embarrassment because Carrie's pregnancy was the result of being raped by the Dobbs' nephew. \\"Vivian Alice Elaine Dobbs\\" attended the Venable Public Elementary School of Charlottesville for four terms, from September 1930 until May 1932. Stephen Jay Gould wrote: > She was an [average student], neither particularly outstanding nor much > troubled.

By all accounts Vivian was of average intelligence, far above feeblemindedness. In June 1932, at the age of eight, Vivian contracted measles. She died from a secondary intestinal infection, enteric colitis. Supreme Court case The legal challenge was consciously collusive, brought on behalf of the state to test the legality of the statute. John H. Bell, the surgeon who operated on Buck on October 19, 1927, wrote in his surgical report: > This is the first case operated on under the sterilization law, and the case > was carried through the courts of the State and the United States Supreme > Court to test the constitutionality of the Virginia act, and an appeal > before the Supreme Court for a rehearing recently having been denied.From > the microfilmed records of Carrie Buck, kept at the Central Virginia > Training Center. Cited in In an eight to one decision, the U.S. Supreme Court found that the Virginia Sterilization Act of 1924 did not violate the U.S. Constitution. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes made clear that the challenge was not upon the medical procedure involved, but on the process of the substantive law. The court was satisfied that the Virginia Sterilization Act complied with the requirements of due process since sterilization could not occur until a proper hearing had occurred at which the patient and a guardian could be present and the patient had the right to appeal the decision. They also found that since the procedure was limited to people housed in state institutions it did not deny the patient equal protection of the law. And finally, since the Virginia Sterilization Act was not a penal statute, the Court held that it did not violate the Eighth Amendment since it is not intended to be punitive. Citing the best interests of the state, Justice Holmes affirmed the value of a law like Virginia's in order to prevent the nation from being \\"swamped with incompetence.\\" The Court accepted, without evidence, that Carrie and her mother were promiscuous and that the three generations of Bucks shared the genetic trait of feeblemindedness. Thus, it was in the state's best interest to have Carrie Buck sterilized.274 U.S. 200 (Buck v. Bell), Justia.com U.S. Supreme Court Center. The decision was seen as a major victory for eugenicists. In his opinion, Justice Holmes wrote: > We have seen more than once that the public welfare may call upon the best > citizens for their lives. It would be strange if it could not call upon > those who already sap the strength of the State for these lesser sacrifices, > often not felt to be such by those concerned, in order to prevent our being > swamped with incompetence.

The principle that sustains compulsory vaccination is > broad enough to cover cutting the Fallopian tubes.... Three generations of > imbeciles are enough. Noted Virginia eugenicist Joseph DeJarnette testified against Buck in the original trial. Later years and death In order to ensure that the family could not reproduce, Carrie Buck's sister Doris was also sterilized when she was hospitalized for appendicitis, although she was never informed of this sterilization. She later married and she and her husband attempted to have children; she did not discover the reason for their lack of success until 1980. Buck was released shortly after her sterilization was performed. On May 14, 1932, she married William D. Eagle, a 65-year-old widower with six children from his first marriage; he died in 1941. In 1965, she married 61-year-old orchard worker Charlie Detamore; the marriage lasted until her death. Reporters and researchers who visited Buck later in life claimed she was a woman of normal intelligence. Later in life, she expressed regret that she had been unable to have additional children. Buck died in a nursing home in 1983; she was buried in Charlottesville near her only child, Vivian, who had died at age eight. Legacy Paul A. Lombardo, a Professor of Law at Georgia State University, spent almost 25 years researching the Buck v. Bell case. He searched through case records and the papers of the lawyers involved in the case. Lombardo eventually found Carrie Buck and was able to interview her shortly before her death. Lombardo has alleged that several people had manufactured evidence to make the state's case against Carrie Buck, and that Buck was actually of normal intelligence. Professor Lombardo was one of the few people who attended Carrie Buck's funeral. A historical marker was erected on May 2, 2002, in Charlottesville, Virginia, where Carrie Buck was born.

Overview  Established in 1861 as the Government College by the British government in India, it opened its doors in 1864. After being elevated to a university status in 2002, it has advanced into one of the top ten largest institution in Pakistan with student body of over 12,000. It has 32 academic departments, segregated into five faculties. There are five research centers, focused on academic and industrial research and development projects. The university secured its second place in the general category by the Higher Education Commission (HEC) in 2013. It has the highest graduation rate in the country, with an average of 94.6% annually. Government College University is noted for its historical roots and attracted notable scholars such as poet-philosopher Allama Muhammad Iqbal, Nobel laureates Har Gobind Khorana and Abdus Salam, former president of both the United Nations General Assembly and the International Court of Justice, Muhammad Zafarullah Khan, France's Prestwich Prize laureate in geosciences, Bilal U. Haq, laureate scholar and novelist duo of Bano Qudsia and Ashfaq Ahmed and many more to study and become alumnus of the institute.  History  Government College, Lahore circa 1880 Originally, the establishment of a central college in Lahore was sanctioned in 1856 by the British Raj, given that the teachers are from University of Oxford, University of Cambridge, Dublin University HC or Durham University. Government College was founded in 1861 when it was \\"briefly affiliated\\"\\"Delhi and Punjab: essays in history and historiography\\" (1995) N.Singh https://books.google.com/books?id=TyluAAAAMAAJ by Brahma Universityhttp://www.brahmauniversity.org under the leadership of Dr. Gottlieb Wilhelm Leitner, professor of Arabic and Islamic Law at King's College London. It was not until 1 January 1864 that the college opened its doors in the Palace of Raja Dhyan Singh Haveli, inside Lahore's Walled City, where it was an affiliated college of Calcutta University. In April 1871, the college moved to a large Bungalow near Anarkali Bazaar. In 1873, its location was again changed to another house called Rahim Khan's Kothi due to rapidly increasing student strength. It moved to its present building in 1876. The first principal was Dr. Gottlieb Wilhelm Leitner, whose name is closely attached to the College. In 1882, Leitner was very instrumental in laying foundation of Punjab University, Lahore. Thereafter, the college would remain affiliated with Punjab University for 115 years. In 1997, Government of the Punjab gave Government College autonomy in all affairs and granted degree awarding status. In 2002, it was promoted to university status by Government of the Punjab; the word college was retained in its title for preserving its historical roots. Main Building, GCU  Campus  GCU's Iconic tower = Old Campus = Positioned in Downtown Lahore, it is located at the junction of The Mall, Lahore and the Lower Mall, surrounded by main business and administrative areas, schools, colleges and Punjab University old Campus. The main building was designed by W. Purdon and completed in 1877 at a cost of Rs. 320,000. In the center of the main building stands a 176' tall clock tower. Being built during the colonial era, the main building reflects the neo-Gothic tradition, with broad verandahs and elevated ceilings. A large ground accompanies the main building, alluded to as the \\"Oval Ground\\". In 2019, the ground was renamed to \\"The Leitner Oval\\", in honor of Gottlieb Wilhelm Leitner, first principal of the institute. To meet with increasing number of students, several buildings and blocks have been commissioned which include a postgraduate block, new block for intermediate students and a bachelors' block which is accessible by the overhead bridge. The main campus is spread over 56 acres along the Anarkali Bazaar, one of the oldest surviving markets in Lahore. = Kala Shah Kaku Campus = On 24 August 2019, Kala Shah Kaku campus of the university was inaugurated which is known as GCU KSK Campus. The campus is spread over 390 acres, able to house 25,000 students. 22 hostels are available for accommodation. On 24 September, 2020, the new campus was formally opened to students. A bus shuttle service will operate between both campuses.  Emblem  Annual Dinner at GCUThe torch, as the crest of the university emblem, represents the light of knowledge. The motto \\"Courage to Know\\" represents the guiding principle of the student community.

Office of Research, Innovation and Commercialization (ORIC) has been set up to manage all research issues. The objective of the office is to advance, diversify and manage all research programs and to uphold international standards of research. It receives research grants mostly from the foreign universities like Strathclyde University, Cranfield University, World Bank Researchers Alliance for Development and British Council and from national institutes and organizations like Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC), Pakistan Science Foundation (PSF), Khan Research Laboratories (KRL), PTCL, Higher Education Commission and Ministry of Science and Technology.  Abdus Salam School for Mathematical Sciences  The Abdus Salam School of Mathematical Sciences (ASSMS) is one of the largest mathematical research institutes in Pakistan. The school was established in 2003 by Government of the Punjab under the aegis of Government College University. The aim of the school is to train professional scientists to pursue the study of scientific and technological problems by mathematical methods and to undertake research in branches of mathematical sciences. Before the existence of school, Pakistani mathematicians opted to study abroad for postdoctoral fellowships, however an increasing number of PhD holders from foreign institutions are choosing this school to pursue their postdoctoral fellowships. At 2011, it was labeled as the first \\"Emerging Regional Center of Excellence\\" by the European Mathematical Society. It has taken steps to provide encouragement to Pakistani students in schools and colleges. These include: * The faculty at the Abdus Salam School of Mathematical Sciences hosted training camps for students from schools and colleges. The participants of the camps are prepared for the national team of Pakistan to compete at the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). In 2005, the national team of Pakistan took part for the first time in IMO. In 2007 Pakistan won the first medal at IMO and the first silver medal in 2012. It continued to train IMO team until 2014. *ASSMS organized mathematics contests (Mathematical Kangaroo) at the national level.  Chairs  Dr. Abdus Salam who won the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics.

In the case of Vogel v. Canada, Justice Douglas Yard of the Manitoba Court of Queen's Bench ruled that the policy of the Government of Manitoba was unconstitutional, and ordered the province to begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. This decision followed a suit brought by three couples in Manitoba who were denied marriage licences. Both the provincial and federal governments had made it known that they would not oppose the court bid. Manitoba became the fifth jurisdiction in Canada (and the eighth worldwide) to extend civil marriage to same-sex couples, after the provinces of Ontario, British Columbia and Quebec, and the territory of Yukon. Judge Yard said that his decision had been influenced by the previous decisions in B.C., Ontario and Quebec. A June 2005 Winnipeg Free Press survey showed that of the 14 federal Manitoban MPs, eight were against same-sex marriages, five were for and one could not be reached. Vogel v. Canada In 1974, one of the couples, Chris Vogel and Richard North, had been married in the First Unitarian Universalist Church of Winnipeg, but the Government of Manitoba refused to register this marriage. On September 16, 2004, Justice Douglas Yard ordered the province to begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples, ruling that bans on same-sex marriage were unconstitutional. Vogel and North did not remarry because they had been married 30 years earlier in the Unitarian Church. The other couples involved in this case were Stefphany Cholakis and Michelle Ritchot, and Laura Fouhse and Jordan Cantwell. Both of these couples were issued marriage licences following the court order, and were married in Manitoba. Both Laura Fouhse and Jordan Cantwell are ministers in the United Church of Canada, and in 2015 Jordan Cantwell was elected to lead the Church as Moderator. A controversy emerged shortly after the ruling, when the province's Vital Statistics Office sent letters to the province's government marriage commissioners (not clergy) asking them to return their certificates of registration if they refuse to perform same-sex marriages. The federal Conservative justice critic, Vic Toews, announced he would file a complaint with the Manitoba Human Rights Commission if this policy was not rescinded. In 2015, Richard North filed a complaint of discrimination with the Manitoba Human Rights Commission when the Government of Manitoba again refused to register his marriage to Chris Vogel in the Unitarian Church.\\"Chris Vogel, Richard North fight for Manitoba to recognize 41-year same-sex marriage\\". CBC News, February 18, 2015. The Commission referred this case to an adjudicator who heard the complaint in November 2017. The adjudicator ruled against the couple in January 2018.Failing to register 1974 same-sex marriage not discriminatory: Manitoba human rights adjudicator The marriage certificate issued to them by the Unitarian Church in 1974 is now on display at the Canadian Museum for Human Rights. A portrait of Vogel and North, by artist Rosey Goodman, is held by the Canadian Lesbian and Gay Archives in its National Portrait Collection. Provincial legislation =Common-law relationships= Since 2001, same-sex couples have had access to government- sanctioned relationships, providing them with some of the rights and benefits of marriage. =Marriage= In October 2008, the Marriage Act () was amended by replacing the words \\"husband and wife\\" with \\"spouses\\". Manitoba became the fourth province, after Quebec, Ontario and Prince Edward Island, to add a gender-neutral definition of spouse in its marriage laws. Marriage statistics Approximately 900 same-sex couples had married in the twelve years following the court ruling. An average of 79 same-sex marriages were celebrated per year, with the peak being 2014 with 107 same-sex marriages.About 900 LGBT couples tied knot since same-sex marriage legalized in Manitoba References External links * LGBT in Manitoba Manitoba Politics of Manitoba Manitoba law ","title":"Same-sex marriage in Manitoba"},{"id":"991053","text":"ZIF socket SuperPro6100: USB interfaced stand alone Universal Programmer with plug-in Adapter Board The 3928, with up to seven sites, is made for programming large data devices, such as MCUs, eMMC HS400, NAND, NOR and Serial Flash devices. High-speed signals support devices up to 200 Mhz and the latest eMMC HS400 modes with data transfer rates of 2.5 nanoseconds per byte. A programmer, device programmer, chip programmer, device burner, or PROM writer is a piece of electronic equipment that arranges written software to configure programmable non-volatile integrated circuits, called programmable devices. The target devices include PROM, EPROM, EEPROM, Flash memory, eMMC, MRAM, FeRAM, NVRAM, PLDs, PLAs, PALs, GALs, CPLDs, FPGAs, and microcontrollers. Function JTAG Connector-based On-Board Programmer for AVR microcontroller with USB Port interface Programmer hardware has two variants. One is configuring the target device itself with a socket on the programmer. Another is configuring the device on a printed circuit board. In the former case, the target device is inserted into a socket (usually ZIF) on top of the programmer. If the device is not a standard DIP packaging, a plug-in adapter board, which converts the footprint with another socket, is used. In the latter case, device programmer is directly connected to the printed circuit board by a connector, usually with a cable. This way is called on-board programming, in-circuit programming, or in-system programming. Afterwards the data is transferred from the programmer into the device by applying signals through the connecting pins. Some devices have a serial interface for receiving the programming data (including JTAG interface). Other devices require the data on parallel pins, followed by a programming pulse with a higher voltage for programming the data into the device. Usually device programmers are connected to a personal computer through a parallel port, USB port, or LAN interface. A software program on the computer then transfers the data to the programmer, selects the device and interface type, and starts the programming process to read/ write/ erase/ blank the data inside the device. Types A Gang Programmer with a Set of 4 Sockets. Xertek SuperBot-2 16-Sockets Automated Gang Programmer There are four general types of device programmers: # Automated programmers (multi-programming sites, having a set of sockets) for mass production. These systems utilize robotic pick and place handlers with on-board sites. This allows for high volume and complex output (such as laser marking, 3D inspection, Tape input/output, etc.) # Development programmers (usually single-programming site) for first article development and small-series production. # Pocket programmers for development and field service. # Specialized programmers for certain circuit types only, such as FPGA, microcontroller, and EEPROM programmers. History Historical Programmer; A shoebox size ICE for MCU\\" & Flash memory Programmer Regarding old PROM programmers, as the many programmable devices have different voltage requirements, every pin driver must be able to apply different voltages in a range of 025 Volts. But according to the progress of memory device technology, recent flash memory programmers do not need high voltages. In the early days of computing, booting mechanism was a mechanical devices usually consisted of switches and LEDs. It means the programmer was not an equipment but a human, who entered machine codes one by one, by setting the switches in a series of \\"on\\" and \\"off\\" positions. These positions of switches corresponded to the machine codes, similar to today's assembly language. Nowadays, EEPROMs are used for bootstrapping mechanism as BIOS, and no need to operate mechanical switches for programming.

In an orchestra or concert band, it refers to the musicians who play the \\"French\\" horn, and in a British-style brass band it is the tenor horn players. In many popular music genres, the term is applied loosely to any group of woodwind or brass instruments, or a combination of woodwinds and brass. Symphonic In a symphony orchestra, the horn section is the group of symphonic musicians who play the French horn (or German horn or Vienna horn). These musicians are typically seated to the back of the ensemble and may be on either side at the director's discretion. Placing them to the left with their bells toward the audience increases the prominence of the section, whereas on the right, the sound reflects off the back of the stage. Most of the time, players are seated right to left from the director's view based on seating, with the principal horn (first horn) being seated on the right and fourth horn seated on the left. The section is ordered in this way so the principal horn may be heard by all players, as the principal sets the timbre and intonation of the section. Popular music Horn section of Ojos de Brujo Horn sections are an integral part of musical genres such as jazz, R&B;, blues, soul, funk, calypso, ska, and gospel. Most of these horn sections feature some combination of saxophones, trumpets and trombones. More rarely, other wind or brass instruments such as flute, clarinet or tuba may be added.

Her most celebrated song is \\"I'm a Man You Don't Meet Every Day\\", otherwise known as \\"Jock Stewart\\". It has been recorded by Archie Fisher, The Dubliners, The McCalmans, The Tannahill Weavers and The Pogues. Variants are known from the US in the 1880s and Australia in the 1850s. Hamish Henderson and Alan Lomax Robertson was born in Aberdeen, Scotland, and in her early life she sometimes lived at 90, Hilton Street, where a plaque now commemorates her. Like many of the Scottish Travellers from Aberdeen, Glasgow and Ayrshire, she went to Blairgowrie to pick raspberries once a year. Hamish Henderson was born in Blairgowrie and tried to track down the best singers there. In 1953, he followed her reputation to her doorstep in Aberdeen. According to legend Jeannie was reluctant to let him in. She challenged him to tell her the opening line of Child ballad no 163, \\"The Battle of Harlaw\\", and he complied. In November of the same year she was staying in the London apartment of Alan Lomax. In preparation for a TV appearance, Jean Ritchie, Margaret Barry and Isla Cameron were also there. They swapped songs with each other, while the tape rolled. It is sometimes stated that she made the first recording of \\"The Battle of Harlaw\\" but this is not so. The first recording was made in 1936 by the Bothy Ballad singer Willie Kemp (for the Beltona label) and it may be from this that she learnt the song. Another of the songs she sang was \\"Andrew Lammie\\" (\\"Mill o' Tifty's Annie\\"), lasting over 13 minutes. At the end she told Alan Lomax about the parts of the story that she had not sung. Many of the 1953 recordings were issued as The Queen Among the Heather in 1975. They later reappeared along with other songs on a CD of the same name. Performances The television programme was The Song Hunter, produced by David Attenborough, who later became controller of BBC Two television. In 1958, Hamish Henderson recorded her in Edinburgh. Those recordings were issued as Up the Dee and Doon The Don on the Lismor label. The Traditional Music and Song Association founded the Blairgowrie Festival in 1965, during the fruit picking. The first festival saw Robertson, plus Jimmy MacBeath and other valuable source singers, who learned folk songs without the influence of radios or books. Her 1968 appearance there was issued as part of an anthology on the Topic label. As well as classic ballads, she sang bawdy songs such as \\"Never Wed an Old Man\\". Robertson was awarded the MBE in 1968 and died on 13 March 1975. Related folk musicians Robertson's daughter Lizzie Higgins issued an album in 1975: Up and Awa' wi' the Laverock. Stanley Robertson, a storyteller, ballad singer and piper from Aberdeen, was Jeannie's nephew. Carmen Higgins, ex-fiddler with the Aberdeen folk band, Rock Salt and Nails, is also closely related to her. Carmen Higgins has played with Old Blind Dogs, recorded a solo CD, and has appeared regularly on television, radio and in the press. Joss Cameron is related to her, and performs Jeannie Robertson songs. Joss Cameron sings with her band 'Shianfolk', named after the road in Appin. She lived in Melbourne for many years.

The baculum (also penis bone, penile bone, or os penis, os genitale or os priapiMLA Dolle, P., et al. \\"HOX-4 genes and the morphogenesis of mammalian genitalia.\\" Genes & Development 5.10 (1991): 1767‚Äì1776.) is a bone found in the penis of many placental mammals. It is absent in the human penis, but present in the penises of other primates, such as the gorilla and chimpanzee. The os penis arises from primordial cells within soft tissues of the penis, and its formation is largely under the influence of androgens. The bone is located above the male urethra, and it aids sexual reproduction by maintaining sufficient stiffness during sexual penetration. The homologue to the baculum in female mammals is known as the baubellum or os clitoridis, a bone in the clitoris.  Etymology  The word baculum meant \\"stick\\" or \\"staff\\" in Latin and originated from , baklon \\"stick\\".  Function  The baculum is used for copulation and varies in size and shape by species. Its evolution may be influenced by sexual selection, and its characteristics are sometimes used to differentiate between similar species.Ramm, Steven A. \\"Sexual selection and genital evolution in mammals: a phylogenetic analysis of baculum length.\\" The American Naturalist 169.3 (2007): 360‚Äì369. A bone in the penis allows a male to mate for a long time with a female,Dixson, A.

The length of the baculum may be related to the duration of copulation in some species. In carnivorans and primates, the length of the baculum appears to be influenced by postcopulatory sexual selection.Brindle, Matilda, and Christopher Opie. \\"Postcopulatory sexual selection influences baculum evolution in primates and carnivores.\\" Proc. R. Soc. B. Vol. 283. No. 1844. The Royal Society, 2016. In some bat species, the baculum can also protect the urethra from compression.  Presence in mammals  A raccoon baculum Mammals having a penile bone (in males) and a clitoral bone (in females) include various eutherians: * Order Primates, although not in lorises, humans, spider monkeys, or woolly monkeys * Order Rodentia (rodents), though not in the related order Lagomorpha (rabbits, hares, etc.) * Order Eulipotyphla (insectivores, including shrews and hedgehogs) * Order Carnivora (including members of many well-known families, such as ursids (bears), canids (dogs), pinnipeds (walruses, seals, sea lions), procyonids (raccoons etc.), mustelids (otters, weasels, skunks and others). The baculum is usually longer in the Canoidea than in the Feloidea, although fossas have long bacula and giant pandas have short bacula. * Order Chiroptera (bats).Hosken, D., et al. \\"Is the bat os penis sexually selected?.\\" Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology 50.5 (2001): 450‚Äì460.L√ºpold, S., A. G. McElligott, and D. J. Hosken. \\"Bat genitalia: allometry, variation and good genes.\\" Biological Journal of the Linnean Society 83.4 (2004): 497‚Äì507. It is absent in humans, ungulates (hoofed mammals), elephants, monotremes (platypus, echidna), marsupials, lagomorphs, hyenas, binturongs, sirenians, and cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises), among others. Evidence suggests that the baculum was independently evolved 9 times and lost in 10 separate lineages. The baculum is an exclusive characteristic of placentals and closely related eutherians, being absent in other mammal clades, and it has been speculated to be derived from the epipubic bones more widely spread across mammals, but notoriously absent in placentals. Among the primates, marmosets, weighing around , have a baculum measuring around , while the tiny galago has one around long. The great apes, despite their size, tend to have very small penis bones, and humans are the only ones to have lost them altogether. In some mammalian species, such as badgersAbramov, Alexei V. \\"Variation of the baculum structure of the Palaearctic badger (Carnivora, Mustelidae, Meles).\\" Russian Journal of Theriology 1.1 (2002): 57‚Äì60.Ahnlund, H. \\"Age determination in the European badger, Meles meles L.\\" Zeitschrift f√ºr S√§ugetierkunde 41.1 (1976): 119‚Äì125. and raccoons (Procyon lotor), the baculum can be used to determine relative age. If a raccoon's baculum tip is made up of uncalcified cartilage, has a porous base, is less than in mass, and measures less than long, then the baculum belongs to a juvenile.  Absence in humans  Unlike most other primates, humans lack an os penis or os clitoris, but the bone is present, although much reduced, among the great apes. In many ape species, it is a relatively insignificant structure. Cases of human penis ossification following trauma have been reported, and one case was reported of a congenital os penis surgically removed from a 5-year-old boy, who also had other developmental abnormalities, including a cleft scrotum. Clellan S. Ford and Frank A. Beach in Patterns of Sexual Behavior (1951), p. 30 say, \\"Both gorillas and chimpanzees possess a penile bone. In the latter species, the os penis is located in the lower part of the organ and measures approximately three-quarters of an inch in length.\\"Patterns of Sexual Behavior Clellan S. Ford and Frank A. Beach, published by Harper & Row, New York in 1951. In humans, the rigidity of the erection is provided entirely through blood pressure in the corpora cavernosa. An \\"artificial baculum\\" or penile implant is sometimes used to treat erectile dysfunction in humans.Carrion, Hernan, et al. \\"A history of the penile implant to 1974.\\" Sexual medicine reviews 4.3 (2016): 285‚Äì293. The loss of the bone in humans, when it is present in our nearest related species the chimpanzee, is thought to be because humans \\"evolved a mating system in which the male tended to accompany a particular female all the time to try to ensure paternity of her children\\" which allows for frequent matings of short duration. Observation suggests that primates with a baculum only infrequently encounter females, but engage in longer periods of copulation that the baculum makes possible, thereby maximizing their chances of fathering the female's offspring. Human females exhibit concealed ovulation also known as hidden estrus, meaning it is almost impossible to tell when the female is fertile, so frequent matings would be necessary to ensure paternity. It has been speculated that the loss of the bone in humans, when it is present in our nearest related species the chimpanzee, is a result of sexual selection by females looking for honest signals of good health in prospective mates. The reliance of the human penis solely on hydraulic means to achieve a rigid state makes it particularly vulnerable to blood pressure variation. Poor erectile function portrays not only physical states such as age, diabetes, and neurological disorders, but also mental states such as stress and depression. A third view is that its loss in humans is an example of neoteny during human evolution; late-stage fetal chimpanzees lack a baculum. (page 134), cited by: \\"In humans, neoteny is manifested in the resemblance of many physiological features of a human to a late-stage foetal chimpanzee. These foetal characteristics include hair on the head, a globular skull, ear shape, vertical plane face, absence of penal bone (baculum) in foetal male chimpanzees, the vagina pointing forward in foetal ape, the presence of hymen in neonate ape, and the structure of the foot. 'These and many other features', Bednarik says, 'define the anatomical relationship between ape and man as the latter's neoteny'\\"  Cultural significance  Walrus baculum, around 22 inches (59 cm) long The existence of the baculum is unlikely to have escaped the notice of pastoralist and hunter-gatherer cultures. It has been argued that the \\"rib\\" (Hebrew ◊¶÷µ◊ú◊á◊¢ ·π£ƒìlƒÅ', also translated \\"flank\\" or \\"side\\") in the story of Adam and Eve is actually a mistranslation of a Biblical Hebrew euphemism for baculum, and that its removal from Adam in the Book of Genesis is a creation story to explain this absence (as well as the presence of the perineal raphe‚Äì as a resultant \\"scar\\") in humans. In hoodoo, the folk magic of the American South, the raccoon baculum is sometimes worn as an amulet for love or luck. \\"In the hoodoo (folk magic) tradition of the American South, a raccoon penis bone (scientifically known as the baculum) is a lucky charm used to attract love. In some areas, it's boiled to remove any trace of the animal, and then tied to a red ribbon and worn as a necklace. In other areas, the bones were traditionally given to girls and young women by suitors, and in still other places, the charms are worn by men. Earrings made from cast raccoon penis bones became a fad in 2004, and celebrities such as Sarah Jessica Parker and Vanessa Williams were photographed wearing them. New Orleans gamblers are said to use the bones (also called coon dogs and Texas toothpicks) for luck.\\" = Oosik = Oosik is a term used in Native Alaska cultures to describe the bacula of walruses, seals, sea lions and polar bears. Sometimes as long as , fossilized bacula are often polished and used as a handle for knives and other tools. The oosik is a polished and sometimes carved baculum of these large northern carnivores. Oosiks are also sold as tourist souvenirs. In 2007, a fossilized penis bone from an extinct species of walrus, believed by the seller to be the largest in existence, was sold for $8,000.

Trinity Bridge is a unique three-way stone arch bridge that stands at the heart of Crowland, Lincolnshire, England. While it once spanned the confluence of the River Welland and a tributary, the rivers have been re-routed and it now spans nothing significant. History The current bridge dates to the 14th century (built between 1360 and 1390) and replaced previous wooden bridges. The earliest known mention of the bridge is by King √Üthelbald of Mercia in 716. In 943 it was mentioned in a charter of Eadred. Quoted in: The bridge is now a scheduled monument and Grade I listed. The bridge is predominantly built from Barnack stone, which was quarried about 10 miles to the west of Crowland, and presumably transported by boat on the Welland. This bridge has three stairways that converge at the top. Originally it spanned the River Welland and a tributary that flowed through the town, although the rivers were re-routed in the mid-seventeenth century and no longer flow anywhere near the bridge. The bridge was an unusual and economical solution to the crossing of two watercourses at their confluence, reducing the need for three separate bridges to a single structure with three abutments. Dry Bridge in Zrenjanin, Serbia, is another example of a bridge no longer crossing water, but it is far larger.

He currently presents Steve Wright in the Afternoon and Steve Wright's Sunday Love Songs on BBC Radio 2, one of the BBC's national radio stations and the most popular station in the United Kingdom. On BBC Television Wright has hosted Home Truths, The Steve Wright People Show, Auntie's TV Favourites, Top Of The Pops and TOTP2. Wright has won awards, including Best DJ of the Year as voted by readers of The Sun, the Daily Mirror Readers Poll and by Smash Hits in 1994. In 1998, he was awarded TRIC Personality of the Year for his radio programmes. Early life and career Born in Greenwich, South London, the elder of two boys in a working- class family, Wright was raised in New Cross. His childhood ambition was to work in the entertainment business. His father, Richard Wright, was a tailor and the manager of the Burton's store in Trafalgar Square. Wright was a quiet child, and never very scholarly. He was educated at Eastwood High School for Boys, near Southend-on-Sea, Essex. Steve occasionally broadcast a nascent radio show over the school speaker system from the school stock cupboard. He started broadcasting in 1976 at Thames Valley Radio Radio 210 in Reading, Berkshire alongside Mike Read. In 1979 Wright got his big break at Radio Luxembourg, where he presented his own nightly show, presenting a Saturday evening show, then Saturday morning. BBC Radio 1 In 1980,Wright joined BBC Radio 1 taking over a Saturday evening slot before moving to Saturday mornings later that year. = Steve Wright in the Afternoon (March 1981 - December 1993) = Wright moved to daytime radio with Steve Wright in the Afternoon in 1981; the show later revolutionised British radio by introducing the \\"zoo\\" format. In 1984, Wright took over a Sunday morning show entitled Steve Wright on Sunday, which meant he presented weekday afternoons Mondays to Thursdays only, with Mark Page and Paul Jordan presenting Friday afternoon's show. In 1986 his Sunday morning show ended, and he returned to five afternoons a week. The original incarnation of Steve Wright in the Afternoon ran from 1981 to 1993 on BBC Radio 1. The show became known in its Radio 1 incarnation for its cast of telephone characters created and performed by Gavin McCoy, Peter Dickson, Richard Easter and Phil Cornwell. Like his mentor, Kenny Everett, Wright went out of its way to be irreverent, including stories taken from the Weekly World News. The success led to a hit single, I'll Be Back, released under the name Arnee and the Terminaters. In later years the style changed, dumping most of the characters and instead having a \\"zoo\\" format, with spoof guests and comedy sketches. A \\"posse\\" of producers and radio staff joined in. This format was new to British radio and marked the beginning of the marginalisation (and eventual departure) of several established Radio 1 DJs over the years that followed. The Smiths song \\"Panic\\", released in 1986, contained supposed lyrical inspiration in reference to Wright's bizarre handling of a news report after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster on BBC Radio One. Following the report, Wright, with the world still reeling in shock, played the song \\"I'm Your Man\\" by Wham! Both Johnny Marr and Morrissey, who had been listening to the broadcast, viewed this as an insensitive and disrespectful act. This is partially the cause of the repeated lyric, ‚ÄúHang the DJ‚Äù in the song.https://www.headstuff.org/entertainment/music/one-track- minded-panic-smiths/ = The Radio 1 Breakfast Show (January 1994 - April 1995) = Wright and his Posse moved to The Radio 1 Breakfast Show in 1994. He resigned from the Breakfast Show in 1995 due to differences with the BBC Radio 1 management; he was unhappy with the plummeting listening figures of the station due to its restructuring under new controller Matthew Bannister, which led to many of the more established DJs leaving, or being sacked, around this time. Commercial radio Wright was picked up by the new station Talk Radio in 1995, where he presented a Saturday morning show. He presented various syndicated shows on Sunday mornings on a number of other British commercial stations. BBC Radio 2  In the early 1970s Wright worked behind the scenes at BBC Radio 2, as a Gramophone Librarian. He returned to Radio 2 in March 1996, where he began presenting Steve Wright's Saturday Show (1996-99) and Steve Wright's Sunday Love Songs (1996-), and his afternoon show beginning in July 1999. Wright is said to earn ¬£440,000 a year at Radio 2.Daily Telegraph ‚Äì Wogan is number one in BBC radio rich list =Steve Wright in the Afternoon (July 1999 - present)= In mid 1999, following a shake-up at Radio 2, Steve Wright in the Afternoon was revived, with Wright taking over this slot from Ed Stewart. Jonathan Ross took over Wright's Saturday morning slot. Wright presents his Radio 2 version of Steve Wright in the Afternoon on weekday afternoons from 2pm to 5pm, alongside Tim Smith and Janey Lee Grace (who have both also occasionally appear as relief presenters on the station), as well as traffic reporter Bobbie Pryor. Another frequent contributor, \\"The Old Woman\\", was played by Joyce Frost who died in November 2016. =Steve Wright's Sunday Love Songs (March 1996 - present)= Sunday Morning Love Songs, which Wright presents on his own, between 9 and 11, with a blend of classic love songs, dedications and real-life romance stories, features items including Contact, I Just Met, Getting Hitched and Chocolate and Flowers. The music played has a romantic feel. In 2013 it was revealed that the show was recorded on a Friday afternoon. The BBC Trust's editorial standards committee said the failure to inform listeners properly breached guidelines on accuracy and interacting with the audience. Career outside radio Wright presented a BBC TV series, The Steve Wright People Show, from 1994‚Äì95.The Steve Wright People Show , IMDb, accessed 23 June 2011. His next stint in television was as the narrator and writer of the retro pop show Top of the Pops 2 between 1997 and 2009.

The band began as a quartet with guitarist Ric Hordinski and drummer Brian Kelley. Hordinski left the band in December 1996, and Kelley continued to play into 1997 before departing. The original foursome reunited in December 2008 at The Taft Theatre (in Cincinnati) to celebrate the 20th Anniversary of the formation of the band, and again in the summer of 2010 at Ric's studio, \\"the Monastery\\", to play the album Good Dog Bad Dog live, in its entirety. The band's namesake and place of origin is the Cincinnati, Ohio neighborhood Over-the-Rhine.Over the Rhine FAQ, http://www.overtherhine.com/faq.php The neighborhood has changed immensely in the last decade, and some credit the band for taking away the negative connotations of the place and opening peoples‚Äô eyes to the ragged beauty of those streets. Karin attended school in Barnesville, Ohio and graduated from Barnesville High School in 1984. She then went to Malone University, located in Canton, Ohio, where she met Linford. Karin and Linford were married in the fall of 1996 in Cincinnati and several years ago relocated to a pre-Civil War farm outside of town. Over the Rhine is now primarily Bergquist (vocals, acoustic guitar, piano) and Detweiler (keyboards, electric bass, vocals) accompanied by complementary musicians on albums and tours. Over the years, they have toured and recorded in many variations. They have shared the stage with Bob Dylan, John Prine, Adrian Belew, Squeeze, Ani DiFranco, My Morning Jacket, Hem, and toured as \\"adjunct\\" members of Cowboy Junkies. History Formed in the spring of 1989, at a time when Detweiler, Hordinski, and Kelley were also touring as part of the final incarnation of Servant, Over the Rhine released independently their first two albums, Till We Have Faces, in 1991 (named for the C. S. Lewis book of the same title) and Patience in 1992, before eventually signing with label giant I.R.S. Records later in 1992. IRS acquired both Till We Have Faces and Patience, issuing them as the first two releases from the band, and later in 1994 would fully fund the band's third LP release Eve to rave reviews. When I.R.S. records was bought out in 1996, Over the Rhine was released from their five-album contract and went on to independently release Good Dog, Bad Dog and The Darkest Night of the Year, both of which outsold the three previous IRS releases combined. In 2001, Over the Rhine signed with Virgin Records/Back Porch and released Films for Radio to near universal acclaim before releasing double album Ohio in 2003. Paste magazine granted one of its first five-star reviews to Ohio, released on Virgin Records' Back Porch Records label. Over the Rhine's next album, Drunkard's Prayer, was released on March 29, 2005. A limited edition live album titled Live From Nowhere, Volume 1 was released in April 2006. A second limited edition live album, Live From Nowhere, Volume 2 was released in March 2007, just over a month from Discount Fireworks. The Trumpet Child and the \\"Live From Nowhere\\" series have been released on their own independent label, Great Speckled Dog (named after their Great Dane, Elroy). Linford has also recorded and released three solo projects composed of home-recorded acoustic, piano-based music. In January 2008, Paste's video podcast interviewed Over the Rhine and featured a live performance. Paste named Over the Rhine's The Long Surrender one of the Top 50 Best Records of the year. Over the Rhine's album The Long Surrender was released nationally on February 8, 2011 on the band's own Great Speckled Dog label. It was recorded in California with producer Joe Henry, and contains a duet with Lucinda Williams on \\"Undamned\\" and two songs co-written with Joe Henry. Over the Rhine's album Meet Me at the Edge of the World is a double album that was produced by Joe Henry. The songs were recorded in two sessions at The Garfield House in South Pasadena in 2013: disc one, Sacred Ground, March 28‚Äì30 and disc two, Blue Jean Sky, April 1‚Äì3. Aimee Mann appears as a special guest vocalist on the song \\"Don't Let The Bastards Get You Down\\". The album was released nationally on September 3, 2013. On March 15, 2019, Over The Rhine released Love & Revelation, on their own Great Speckled Dog Record label. The album was produced by the band and recorded and mixed by Ryan Freeland. The first single from the album, the title track, was premiered by Paste almost two months earlier. The album premiered on Rolling Stone along with a brief article about the album and the duo‚Äôs creative process. The album was met with critical acclaim from sources including No Depression and Associated Press, who wrote \\"Love & Revelation is a subdued but lovely celebration...It won't surprise longtime fans that the topics are often sad and the tempos mostly slow, all the better to showcase Bergquist's warm, wise, honest alto.

Early life Born on 30 October 1907 in Huncoat, Lancashire, Davenport was educated at Accrington Grammar School, the University of Manchester (graduating in 1927), and Trinity College, Cambridge. He became a research student of John Edensor Littlewood, working on the question of the distribution of quadratic residues. First steps in research The attack on the distribution question leads quickly to problems that are now seen to be special cases of those on local zeta-functions, for the particular case of some special hyperelliptic curves such as Y^2 = X(X-1)(X-2)\\\\ldots (X-k). Bounds for the zeroes of the local zeta-function immediately imply bounds for sums \\\\sum \\\\chi(X(X-1)(X-2)\\\\ldots (X-k)), where œá is the Legendre symbol modulo a prime number p, and the sum is taken over a complete set of residues mod p. In the light of this connection it was appropriate that, with a Trinity research fellowship, Davenport in 1932-1933 spent time in Marburg and G√∂ttingen working with Helmut Hasse, an expert on the algebraic theory. This produced the work on the Hasse‚ÄìDavenport relations for Gauss sums, and contact with Hans Heilbronn, with whom Davenport would later collaborate. In fact, as Davenport later admitted, his inherent prejudices against algebraic methods (\\"what can you do with algebra?\\") probably limited the amount he learned, in particular in the \\"new\\" algebraic geometry and Artin/Noether approach to abstract algebra. Later career He took an appointment at the University of Manchester in 1937, just at the time when Louis Mordell had recruited √©migr√©s from continental Europe to build an outstanding department. He moved into the areas of diophantine approximation and geometry of numbers. These were fashionable, and complemented the technical expertise he had in the Hardy-Littlewood circle method; he was later, though, to let drop the comment that he wished he'd spent more time on the Riemann hypothesis. He was President of the London Mathematical Society from 1957 to 1959. After professorial positions at the University of Wales and University College London, he was appointed to the Rouse Ball Chair of Mathematics in Cambridge in 1958. There he remained until his death, of lung cancer. Personal life Davenport married Anne Lofthouse, whom he met at the University College of North Wales at Bangor in 1944; they had two children, Richard and James, the latter going on to become Hebron and Medlock Professor of Information Technology at the University of Bath. Influence From about 1950, Davenport was the obvious leader of a \\"school\\", somewhat unusually in the context of British mathematics. The successor to the school of mathematical analysis of G. H. Hardy and J. E. Littlewood, it was also more narrowly devoted to number theory, and indeed to its analytic side, as had flourished in the 1930s. This implied problem-solving, and hard-analysis methods. The outstanding works of Klaus Roth and Alan Baker exemplify what this can do, in diophantine approximation. Two reported sayings, \\"the problems are there\\", and \\"I don't care how you get hold of the gadget, I just want to know how big or small it is\\", sum up the attitude, and could be transplanted today into any discussion of combinatorics. This concrete emphasis on problems stood in sharp contrast with the abstraction of Bourbaki, who were then active just across the English Channel.

Hunt Museum A charmstone, charm-stone or charm stone is a stone or mineral artifact of various types associated with various traditional cultures, including those of Scotland and the native cultures of California and the American southwest. Typically they are elongated or cylindrical and have been shaped by grinding or other human activity, and may be perforated and/or grooved. They are thought to have been regarded as having some religious or magical function, including being talismans, amulets or charms. Typically, but not always, references to American examples use \\"charmstone\\", and to Scottish ones \\"charm-stone\\" or \\"charm stone\\". Scotland Scottish charm-stones are typically large smooth rounded pieces of rock crystal or other forms of quartz. They were credited with healing or quasi-magical powers, and often worked through water that the charmstone had been dipped into, which was considered efficacious against various ills of both humans and farm animals. The Brooch of Lorn is an example of a charmstone set into a very elaborate brooch in the late 16th century, and worn by clan chiefs.The brooch of Lorn , Dunollie.org It is likely that Scottish painted pebbles, which have been dated to the period 200 AD to the eighth century AD (the Pictish period) also functioned as charm-stones, often known as 'cold-stones'. Such stones were used within living memory (1971) to cure sickness in animals and humans. Robert Burns's Highland Mary is said to have been treated using charm-stones when she lay dying at Greenock in 1786. Some superstitious friends believed that her illness was as a result of someone casting the evil eye upon her and her father was urged to go to a place where two streams meet, select seven smooth stones, boil them in milk, and treat her with the potion.Annandale, Charles (Editor) (1890). The Works of Robert Burns. London : Blackie & Son, V.1, Page 175 In the Life of St. Columba it is recorded that he visited King Bridei in Pictland in around the year 565 AD and taking a white stone pebble from the River Ness he blessed it and any water it came into contact with would cure sick people. It floated in water and cured the king from a terminal illness. It remained as one of the great treasures of the king and cured many others. The belief in charm-stones is also well documented in medieval Iceland (Proc Soc Antiq Scot). Examples of 'charm-stones' or 'cold-stones' are held at National Museum of Rural Life, Kittochside, near East Kilbride, and the example set in the Lochbuy or Lochbuie Brooch is in the British Museum.Lochbuie Brooch, British Museum Northern England As late as the 19th century, stones from Ireland were considered efficacious against snake- bites in northern England, presumably because Ireland is famously free of snakes. Apparently any stone would do, so long as it came from Ireland; failing that, Irish sticks and Irish horse-teeth would work, and live cattle from Ireland were also believed to have active powers against snakes, to kill or paralyze them.Webb, 262-265 Native American Unlike fetishes they are not figural.

(; January 10, 1944 ‚Äì March 16, 2016), professionally known as Frank Sinatra Jr., was an American singer, songwriter, and conductor. He was the son of singer and actor Frank Sinatra and his first wife, Nancy Barbato Sinatra, the younger brother of singer and actress Nancy Sinatra, and the older brother of television producer Tina Sinatra. Early life Sinatra family portrait, 1949, with Frank Jr. at far right Francis Wayne Sinatra was born January 10, 1944, in Jersey City, New Jersey, into the household of one of the most popular singers in the world, Frank Sinatra. The younger Sinatra was technically not a \\"junior\\" (his father's middle name was Albert) but was nonetheless known as Frank Jr. throughout his life. He hardly saw his father, who was constantly on the road, either performing or working in films. However, Sinatra Jr. recalled wanting to become a pianist and songwriter from his earliest days. =Kidnapping= Sinatra was kidnapped at the age of 19, on December 8, 1963, at Harrah's Lake Tahoe (room 417). He was released two days later after his father paid the $240,000 ransom demanded by the kidnappers (). Barry Keenan, Johnny Irwin, and Joe Amsler were soon captured, prosecuted for kidnapping, convicted, and sentenced to long prison terms, of which they served only small portions. Mastermind Keenan was later adjudged to have been legally insane at the time of the crime and hence not legally responsible for his actions. Famed attorney Gladys Root represented Johnny Irwin. The kidnappers demanded that all communication be conducted by payphone. During these conversations, Frank Sr. became concerned he would not have enough coins, which prompted him to carry 10 dimes with him at all times for the rest of his life; he was even buried with 10 dimes in his pocket. At the time of the kidnapping, Frank Sr. and the Rat Pack were filming Robin and the 7 Hoods. The stress of the kidnapping, in addition to the assassination of Sinatra's close friend John F. Kennedy just a few weeks prior to the kidnapping, caused Sinatra to seriously consider shutting down production completely, although the film was ultimately completed. Career By his early teens, Sinatra was performing at local clubs and venues. At age 19, he became the vocalist for Sam Donahue's band. He also spent considerable time with Duke Ellington, learning the music business.The Other Frank Sinatra ‚Äì \\"... [Duke Ellington] took me under his wing.\\" Sinatra spent most of his early career on the road. By 1968, he had performed in 47 states and 30 countries, had appeared as a guest on several television shows, including two episodes of The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour with his sister Nancy, hosted a 10-week summer replacement series for The Dean Martin Show, had sung with his own band in Las Vegas casinos, and had been the opening act for bigger names at other casinos. During that time, he gained a reputation for rigorous rehearsals and demanding standards for his musicians. Frank Sinatra Jr. on The Red Skelton Show (1969) Sinatra appeared in the Sammy Davis Jr. drama A Man Called Adam in 1966. He also played a deputy district attorney, named Gino Bardi, on the television crime drama Adam-12, in the episode titled \\"Clinic on 18th Street\\" (originally broadcast on March 13, 1974). His other acting credits included roles in Aru heishi no kake (1970) with Dale Robertson, Code Name Zebra (1987) opposite James Mitchum, and Hollywood Homicide (2003) with Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett. The National Archives now houses a 15-minute song and monologue composed by Sinatra in 1976, Over the Land. It evokes the memory of the nation's flag and the nation's experiences with the flag since the War of 1812. Starting in 1988, at his father's request, Sinatra placed his career on hold in order to act as his father's musical director and conductor. Poet/vocalist Rod McKuen said: In 1989, Sinatra sang \\"Wedding Vows in Vegas\\" on the Was (Not Was) album, What Up, Dog?, and performed the song live with the band on Late Night with David Letterman on March 23, 1989.Frank Sinatra Jr. on Late Night With David Letterman singing \\"Wedding Wows in Vegas\\" on YouTube, March 23, 1989 During the 1995‚Äì1996 television season, Sinatra was offered the role of Vic Fontaine on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. Despite being a fan of the show and finding the role interesting, he turned it down, declaring that he only wanted to play an alien. James Darren accepted the part, after refusing three times because he found the idea of a vocalist playing a vocalist to be too \\"on the nose\\", but changed his mind when he read the script.

He returned in a 2008 episode, \\"Tales of a Third Grade Nothing\\" (Season 8, Episode 6), wherein he sang with Brian again, with Stewie returning as a sideline investor supporting the duo. A third episode featuring Sinatra, \\"Bookie of the Year\\" (Season 15, Episode 2), aired posthumously on October 2, 2016 and was dedicated to his memory. This was his final appearance recorded.

The label, founded in Gainesville, Florida, is based in New York City. History John Janick conceived of the label while attending high school, but it was not until he enrolled at the University of Florida in Gainesville and teamed up with Less Than Jake drummer-lyricist Vinnie Fiorello that Fueled By Ramen became a reality. The name of the label was inspired by only being able to afford a diet of inexpensive instant ramen at the time, due to having invested most of their money into making records. Ramen's first major success came in 1998 with the self-titled EP from Jimmy Eat World, which enabled the label to buy its first office space in Tampa. Ramen early on partnered with the independent distribution arm of Warner, ADA; Warner's Lyor Cohen finally making a deal for Ramen that led Janick to say \\"We operate like an indie label that‚Äôs very small and nimble and can do their own thing, but we have the resources of a major company.\\" In 2004, Fall Out Boy's Pete Wentz introduced Fueled By Ramen to fellow Chicago pop rock outfit The Academy Is..., who released their debut album Almost Here, the following year. Soon thereafter, Janick joined forces with Wentz to create Decaydance Records and released a series of albums from a disparate-sounding group of acts ranging from the alternative hip hop of Gym Class Heroes to the indie-pop combo The Hush Sound. In September 2005, Decaydance and Fueled By Ramen released A Fever You Can't Sweat Out, the RIAA double platinum-certified debut album from Las Vegas' Panic! at the Disco. In 2006, Vinnie Fiorello left the label, citing disagreements in the direction of future signees and loss of passion in the music the label was investing itself in. In 2007, the label opened an office in midtown Manhattan, and that same year Paramore's album Riot! debuted in the top 20 of the U.S. Billboard 200, was certified gold and a year later gained platinum status. Panic! at the Disco's second studio album Pretty. Odd. achieved similar success, debuting at number 2 on the Billboard 200 chart, selling over 139,000 copies in its first week, and gaining platinum success. Later in 2016, Panic! at the Disco's fifth studio album Death of a Bachelor debuted at number 1, selling 196,000 copies in its first week, making it the fastest-selling album in the label's history. In 2012, Fueled By Ramen signed musical duo Twenty One Pilots. They released their label debut album Vessel in 2013 which included songs, \\"Ode To Sleep\\", \\"Holding On to You\\", \\"House of Gold\\", and \\"Car Radio\\". In 2015, they released their album Blurryface, which included singles, \\"Tear in My Heart\\", \\"Fairly Local\\", \\"Stressed Out\\", \\"Heavydirtysoul\\" and \\"Ride\\". The album peaked at Number 1 on the Billboard top 200 chart, and was certified triple platinum after selling over 1.5 million copies in the U.S. \\"Stressed Out\\" is the most viewed music video on Fueled By Ramen's YouTube channel, reaching over 2 billion views. In June 2018, Warner Music Group announced that Fueled By Ramen, among other labels, would be included in a new label, Elektra Music Group. It officially launched on October 1, 2018. Award certifications Ten albums released by Fueled By Ramen have been certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for sales of one million units or more: Some Nights (2012) by fun.; Riot!

He was also a writer of plays. Biography Lemon was born in London on 30 November 1809. He was the son of Martin Lemon, a hop merchant, and Alice Collis. His parents married on 26 December 1808 at St Mary, Marylebone, London. Between 1817 and 1823, after the death of his father, Lemon lived at Church Farmhouse in Hendon, where a blue plaque commemorates him. At 15, Lemon was sent to live in Boston, Lincolnshire, with his mother's brother Thomas Collis. Mark had a natural talent for journalism and the stage, and, at 26, retired from less congenial business to devote himself to the writing of plays. More than sixty of his melodramas, operettas and comedies were produced in London, whilst at the same time he was contributing to a wide variety of magazines and newspapers. He married Helen (Nelly) Romer, on 28 September 1839 in Kensington, London and had eight children - sons Mark, Frank and Henry, and daughters Alice, Betty, Helen, Mary and Kate. Frank died shortly after he was born. Betty married Sir Robert Romer and their son was Mark Lemon Romer. In 1841 Lemon and Henry Mayhew conceived the idea of a humorous weekly paper to be called Punch, and when the first number was issued, in July 1841, were joint-editors and, with the printer and engraver, equal owners. The paper was for some time unsuccessful, Lemon keeping it alive out of the profits of his plays. On the sale of Punch, Lemon became sole editor for the new proprietors. It remained under his control until his death, achieving remarkable popularity and influence. Two other long-running magazines in which Lemon played a significant part were the Illustrated London News, the first publication to make use of pictures as well as text in reporting, which was founded by his friend Herbert Ingram, and The Field, of which he was founder editor (1853‚Äì57). Mark Lemon's grave, St Margaret's Church, Ifield, West Sussex. Lemon was an actor of ability, a pleasing lecturer and a successful impersonator of Shakespearian characters. He played in the 1851 production of Not So Bad As We Seem, a play written by Edward Bulwer and featuring many notable Victorians (including Charles Dickens). He also wrote a host of novelettes and lyrics, over a hundred songs, a few three-volume novels, several Christmas fairy tales and a volume of jests. He was a stalwart of the London Gentlemen's club the Savage Club. He died in his adopted home town Crawley, West Sussex on 23 May 1870 and was buried in St Margaret's Church, Ifield. A blue plaque commemorates him outside The George Hotel, Crawley.

She had greenish blue eyes and bright red hair. She was one of the six children of the King and Queen that had red hair, a trait inherited from Anne of Brittany, Claude's mother. She lived a happy life, moving from the Ch√¢teau d'Amboise to the Ch√¢teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye before March 1519. Later life and death The Princess spent all of her remaining days at the Ch√¢teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye. She had always been a delicate, frail child. At age seven, she contracted measles, the same disease which had killed her half-uncle, Charles Orlando, Dauphin of France, thirty years earlier. The only person who looked after her while she was sick was her aunt, Margaret of Angoul√™me, as her mother had already died two months earlier, her grandmother Louise of Savoy was very sick, and her father had gone to war. He was later imprisoned, so was nowhere near his daughter at the time of her death. It appears as if Charlotte was very close to her aunt, who was heartbroken and distraught when her \\"little one\\" died, on 18 September 1524. Ancestry References * Freer, Martha Walker.

Like most alkali metal carbonates, it is a white solid that is poorly soluble in water. It occurs as the mineral known as witherite. In a commercial sense, it is one of the most important barium compounds. Preparation Barium carbonate is made commercially from barium sulfide with by treatment with sodium carbonate at 60 to 70 ¬∞C (soda ash method) or, more commonly carbon dioxide at 40 to 90 ¬∞C: In the soda ash process, an aqueous solution of barium sulfide is treated with sodium carbonate: :BaS + H2O + CO2 ‚Üí BaCO3 \\\\+ H2S Reactions Barium carbonate reacts with acids such as hydrochloric acid to form soluble barium salts, such as barium chloride: : + 2 HCl ‚Üí + + Pyrolysis of barium carbonate gives barium oxide. Uses It is mainly used to remove sulfate impurities from feedstock of the chlor-alkali process. Otherwise it is a common precursor to barium-containing compounds such as ferrites. =Other uses= Barium carbonate is widely used in the ceramics industry as an ingredient in glazes. It acts as a flux, a matting and crystallizing agent and combines with certain colouring oxides to produce unique colours not easily attainable by other means. Its use is somewhat controversial since some claim that it can leach from glazes into food and drink. To provide a safe means of use, BaO is often used in fritted form. In the brick, tile, earthenware and pottery industries barium carbonate is added to clays to precipitate soluble salts (calcium sulfate and magnesium sulfate) that cause efflorescence.

It rejects the idea of \\"one unchanging and essential world accessible to neutral representation by a disembodied subject.\\"Barry Sandywell, Dictionary of Visual Discourse: A Dialectical Lexicon of Terms, Routledge, 2012, p. 458 (\\"Perspectivism\\"). There are many possible conceptual schemes, or perspectives in which judgment of truth or value can be made. This is often taken to imply that no way of seeing the world can be taken as definitively \\"true\\", but does not necessarily entail that all perspectives are equally valid. G. W. Leibniz integrated this view into his philosophy, but Friedrich Nietzsche fully developed it. Precursors Perspectivism was thought about in Plato's rendition of Protagoras (c. 490 BC ‚Äì c. 420 BC).Barry Sandywell, Dictionary of Visual Discourse: A Dialectical Lexicon of Terms, Routledge, 2012, p. 458 (\\"Perspectives, Philosophical\\"). A more recent philosophical source of perspectivism is Leibniz's theory of monads. Nietzsche's perspectivism  Perspectivism rejects objective metaphysics, claiming that no evaluation of objectivity can transcend cultural formations or subjective designations. Therefore, there are no objective facts, nor any knowledge of a thing-in-itself. Truth is separated from any particular vantage point, and so there are no ethical or epistemological absolutes.Mautner, Thomas, The Penguin Dictionary of Philosophy, 2005, page 418 Rules (i.e., those of philosophy, the scientific method, etc.) are constantly reassessed according to the circumstances of individual perspectives.Schacht, Richard, Nietzsche, 1993, page 61. Truth is thus created by integrating different vantage points together. People always adopt perspectives by default - whether they are aware of it or not - and the concepts of one's existence are defined by the circumstances surrounding that individual. Truth is made by and for individuals and peoples.Scott-Kakures, Dion (1993), HarperCollins College Outline History of Philosophy, 1993, page 346 This view differs from many types of relativism which consider the truth of a particular proposition as something that altogether cannot be evaluated with respect to an absolute truth, without taking into consideration culture and context. This view is outlined in an aphorism from Nietzsche's posthumously-assembled collection The Will to Power: The importance of perspective appears in Nietzsche's published works as early as The Gay Science, where he describes the effects of seeing things from different viewpoints. =Interpretation= Richard Schacht, in his interpretation of Nietzsche's thought, argues that this can be expanded into a revised form of objectivity in relation to subjectivity as an aggregate of singular viewpoints. These aggregated perspectives illuminate, for example, a particular idea in seemingly self-contradictory ways. Upon further consideration they reveal a difference of contextuality and of rule by which such an idea (that is fundamentally perspectival) can be validated. Therefore, it can be said each perspective is subsumed into and, taking account of its individuated context, adds to the overall objective measure of a proposition under examination.

He is currently Chair of Arts Council England, a role which he has held since February 2017.\\"National Council Members\\". Arts Council England. Accessed 9 October 2017 Serota was previously Director of The Museum of Modern Art, Oxford, and Director of the Whitechapel Gallery, London, before becoming Director of the Tate in 1988. He was also Chairman of the Turner Prize jury until 2007. Early life Modern Art Oxford Nicholas Serota was born and raised in Hampstead, North London, the only son of Stanley Serota and Beatrice Katz Serota. His father was a civil engineer and his mother a civil servant, later a life peer and Labour Minister for Health in Harold Wilson's government and local government ombudsman. He has a younger sister, Judith. Serota was educated at Haberdashers' Aske's School (where he was appointed School Captain) and then read Economics at Christ's College, Cambridge (University of Cambridge), before switching to History of Art. He completed a master's degree at the Courtauld Institute of Art, University of London, under the supervision of Michael Kitson and Anita Brookner; his thesis was on the work of J. M. W. Turner. In 1969, Serota became Chairman of the new Young Friends of the Tate organisation with a membership of 750. They took over a building in Pear Place, south of Waterloo Bridge, arranging lectures and Saturday painting classes for local children. The Young Friends staged their own shows and applied for an Arts Council grant, but were asked to desist by the Tate Chairman and Trustees, who were concerned with the appearance of official backing for these ventures. Serota and his committee resigned, which caused the end of the Young Friends, whose accommodation was taken over for rehearsals by the National Theatre.Spalding, Frances (1998). The Tate: A History, pp. 150‚Äì151. Tate Gallery Publishing, London. . In 1970, he joined the Arts Council of Great Britain's Visual Arts Department as a regional exhibitions officer. In 1973 he was made Director of the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford (now Modern Art Oxford), where he organised an early exhibition of work by Joseph Beuys and formed a working relationship with Alexander \\"Sandy\\" Nairne, who worked with Serota at various points in the following years. Whitechapel directorship Whitechapel Gallery In 1976, Serota was appointed Director of the Whitechapel Gallery in London's East End. The Whitechapel was well regarded but had suffered from lack of resources. Serota assembled at the Whitechapel a staff including Jenni Lomax (later Director of the Camden Arts Centre), Mark Francis (later of Gagosian Gallery) and Sheena Wagstaff (later Chief Curator of Tate Modern), and organised exhibitions of Carl Andre, Eva Hesse and Gerhard Richter as well as early exhibitions of then emerging artists such as Antony Gormley. In 1976 he was a judge for an art competition run by the brewers Trumans. In 1980, assisted by Alexander \\"Sandy\\" Nairne, he organised a two-part exhibition of 20th century British sculpture. In 1981, he curated The New Spirit in Painting, with Norman Rosenthal and Christos Joachimides for the Royal Academy. The shows, where Serota was helped by his administrator Loveday Shewell, often received adverse reviews in the press, which reacted with an uncharacteristic dislike for contemporary avant-garde art. Thus Serota remained somewhat distanced from the English establishment, although developing a growing reputation internationally in the art world.Spalding, Frances (1998). The Tate: A History, pp. 245-52. Tate Gallery Publishing, London, UK; . In 1984‚Äì1985, Serota shut down the Whitechapel for over 12 months for extensive refurbishment. A strip of land had been acquired, which allowed a design by architects Colquhoun and Miller for a first-floor gallery, restaurant, lecture theatre and other rooms. Although receiving wide approbation, the scheme was in deficit by ¬£250,000. In 1987, Serota raised ¬£1.4m in an auction of work, which he had asked artists to donate, paying off the debt, and creating an endowment fund to allow future exhibitions of more unconventional work, unlikely to attract a commercial sponsor. Tate directorship Tate Britain, previously the Tate Gallery The short-listed candidates for the Tate Directorship, who included Norman Rosenthal and Julian Spalding, were asked to prepare a seven-year scheme for the Tate. Serota's submission, on two sides of A4 paper, was titled \\"Grasping the Nettle\\". It analysed the various areas of Tate work and proposed future stratagems to deal with the imminent crisis caused by restricted government financial support, changing public sector management expectations and increasing art market prices. He saw many areas of the Tate's operations in need of overhaul, and concluded that the gallery was loved, but not respected enough. Tate Chairman, Richard Rogers considered this by far the best proposal submitted. News of Serota's appointment as Tate Director in 1988 was received enthusiastially by Howard Hodgkin, who wrote in The Sunday Times, \\"Nick Serota has enormous energy and demonstrated at the Whitechapel a tremendous sense of diplomacy. He is a passionate man, and indeed is quite unusual in this country in his commitment to modern painting and sculpture.\\" In contrast, Peter Fuller made a scathing attack in Modern Painters magazine, saying that Serota would be incapable, by temperament and ability, of maintaining the Tate's historic collection. Tate Modern Major expansion of the Tate Gallery had been seen as inevitable for two decades. In 1993, the creation of the National Lottery made it possible to anticipate the availability of major public funding for an enlarged Gallery. In 1995, Tate received ¬£52 million towards the conversion of the former Bankside Power Station to create Tate Modern. The final cost was ¬£135 million; Serota managed to secure the funds to make up the shortfall from a range of private sources. Tate Modern opened in May 2000 and quickly became a major tourist fixture of London. As well as housing acclaimed new works by Louise Bourgeois and Anish Kapoor, the Gallery has also provided the base for successful exhibitions of Donald Judd, Picasso, Matisse and Edward Hopper. On 21 November 2000, Serota gave the Dimbleby Lecture in London. He started it by telling of a 1987 Civil Service enquiry which ranked the pay of the Tate Gallery director with that of larger museums such as the National Gallery, because the former \\"has to deal with the very difficult problem of modern art.\\"Serota, Sir Nicholas. , BBC, 6 March 2001; retrieved 3 April 2016. He explained it thus: As of 2015, Serota was paid a salary of between ¬£165,000 and ¬£169,999 by the Tate, making him one of the 328 most highly paid people in the British public sector at that time, at the lower end of the senior officials 'high earners' list, and well below what similar executives earn in public health, transport or government administrative top roles. In 1998, Serota conceived \\"Operation Cobalt\\", the secret buy-back of two of the Tate's paintings by J. M. W. Turner that had been stolen in 1994 while they were on loan to a gallery in Frankfurt. The paintings were recovered in 2000 and 2002. In December 2005, Serota admitted that he had submitted an application form with false information to the Art Fund (NACF) for a ¬£75,000 grant to go towards buying the painting The Upper Room, stating that the Tate had made no commitment to purchase the work (a requirement of the grant), whereas they had already paid a first instalment of ¬£250,000 several months previously. He attributed this to \\"a failing in his head\\". The NACF allowed the Tate to keep the grant.\\"Tate Broke Own Rules on Ofili Buy\\", The Sunday Telegraph, 18 December 2006; retrieved 23 March 2006. In 2006, the Charity Commission ruled the Tate had broken charity law (but not the criminal law) over the purchase and similar trustee purchases, including ones made before Serota's directorship.Higgins, Charlotte. \\"How the Tate broke the law in buying a ¬£600,000 Ofili work\\", The Guardian, 19 July 2006; retrieved 7 July 2015.

In September 2016, the Tate announced that Serota would step down as director in 2017, and he would become director of Arts Council England. Serota was succeeded by Maria Balshaw.

Their demands were supported by 8,000 Tate members and visitors, and artists including Conrad Atkinson.The What Next? art campaign must tackle sticky questions like BP at Tate The Guardian, 3 May 2013 When questioned about BP sponsorship during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, Serota responded \\"We all recognise they have a difficulty at the moment but you don't abandon your friends because they have what we consider to be a temporary difficulty.\\"Interview, The Jewish Chronicle, 8 July 2010.

In the fall of 1964 the lobby of their new arena, Hara Arena, had a natural gas explosion. The damage was minor and the expansion team was assembled from various cast-offs and young players looking for their first break in minor league hockey. Dayton was the host for several IHL all star games due to the large attendance in their 5,500 seat arena. The Gems played exhibition games against the US Olympic team as well as the Oklahoma City Blazers of the Central Hockey League. The team had a few games a season televised locally as well as all games broadcast on the premier AM radio station in town. Other teams in the league copied the uniform styling of the Gems. The Dayton Gems were the first adult team in North America to make helmets mandatory, long before the NHL adopted them. Team history Local businessman Lefty McFadden provided the financial base for the team and acquired the team franchise for the International Hockey League. The Gems, taken from the nickname for Dayton, Ohio, the Gem City, were affiliated with the Boston Bruins for several years. The Bruins provided some of the players and the trainer for the team. In the 1970s, the Gems became an affiliate for the Washington Capitals. After winning the Turner Cup two years in a row in 1968‚Äì69 and 1969‚Äì70, General Manager Edgar \\"Lefty\\" McFadden was selected as the minor league executive of the year. He then moved to Washington to assist the Capitals. The Gems struggled on and off the ice for the next few years as attendance decreased from 5,000 to 1,000 a game. The 1970s downturn in the economy, especially the auto industry, reduced disposable income for the fans, along with the increase in hockey violence, hurt the attendance. The Gems recovered to win their final Turner Cup in 1976. Their red, white and blue uniforms with the crest of a hockey player superimposed over a diamond, are on exhibit at the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto. The Gems went into dormancy after the 1976‚Äì77 season, and were resurrected for the 1979‚Äì80 season. The revived Gems lasted only one season before ceasing operations for good.

Background He was born to Thomas Gell and Millicent Sacheverell in Hopton Hall in DerbyshireInce, T.N.& Sleigh, J, 1870-1871 His father owned a large estate in the Wirksworth area, largely based on extensive interest in the lead industry, which included possession of the lead tithes in the mines of Bakewell, Hope and TideswellDerbyshire Record Office D258/31/88za and smelting and mine owning in Wirksworth. His father died shortly before the birth of a second son in 1594Derbyshire Record Office D258/66/4 and his mother married John Curzon, of Kedleston Hall, soon afterwards.Gell,1913 Millicent gave birth to a son, John, in 1598. Until his return to Hopton in 1620, Gell lived with his mother and stepfather at Kedleston. This proved significant to his later political career as he formed a close relationship with his half-brother, John Curzon, who became an influential Member of Parliament (MP). Gell was married in January 1609, at the age of 15, to Elizabeth Willoughby, daughter of Sir Percival Willoughby of Wollaton Hall in Nottinghamshire.Ince, T.N. & Sleigh, J.1870-1871 In 1624 Gell was appointed captain of foot in the trained bands, or militia, in the hundreds (administrative areas) of High Peak and Scarsdale.Derbyshire Record Office D3287/1043/4 During a decade or more as a militia captain Gell learned how the military was organised in Derbyshire. He became familiar with the rank and file and their officers and with the minutiae of training and command.Derbyshire Record Office D258/60/60 This knowledge and expertise was soon to be put to use. Politics Gell's next public appointment was shared with his brother, Thomas, who was a well- connected barrister in London. This was the office of Receiver and Supervisor of the Honour of Tutbury, granted in 1632 successively, for life, to Thomas, and to John and his son, John Gell the younger.Derbyshire Record Office D258/58/11 The Honour of Tutbury was the name given to the Derbyshire and Staffordshire estates of the Duchy of Lancaster, a royal possession, and Thomas was responsible for collecting Duchy rents and dues, including fees payable whenever a Duchy tenancy was transferred by sale or inheritance. Armed with a schedule of property on which inheritance fees were outstanding, Thomas Gell ordered that defaulters' property should be seized in lieu of unpaid Duchy rents. At a time when the king, Charles I, was governing without a Parliament, and was desperately short of money, the Gells' revenue raising earned them Royal favour. John Gell was rewarded by appointment to the post of High Sheriff of Derbyshire for the year 1635. Gell's year as High Sheriff was politically important because one of his duties was to raise the tax known as Ship Money, levied for the first time in 1635.Derbyshire Record Office D258/28/6c Ship Money had previously been levied on coastal towns and its extension to inland areas caused resentment which contributed toward the gathering estrangement between Charles I and Parliament. In Derbyshire Gell set about raising the tax with a thoroughness which made him many personal enemies, especially among those of his own class, who paid the highest rates. Gell was ruthless in using \\"distraint\\" - confiscation of assets - against non- payers, and succeeded in raising more for the king than subsequent sheriffs. Gell's record of service to the crown was rewarded by the grant of a baronetcy in 1642, after payments made on his behalf by his brother Thomas, in London, which included \\"a warrant for a Baronett ¬£300\\".Derbyshire D258/56/18c =Civil War 1642‚Äì1646= The honour may have been designed to secure Gell's loyalty to the Crown in the conflict with Parliament which by then seemed inevitable. However Gell, a Presbyterian, was opposed to the king's attempts to reform the church on High Church lines and to his political absolutism, and chose Parliament. He was commissioned as Colonel to raise a regiment in DerbyshireDerbyshire Record Office D3287/1043/4 and throughout the First English Civil War, between 1642 and 1646, managed to maintain the county's allegiance to Parliament. Units of his regiment fought engagements in the neighbouring counties of Staffordshire and Nottinghamshire and took part in the siege of Chester. Among the more important engagements in which the Derbyshire troops were involved were the siege of Lichfield and the Battle of Hopton Heath, in which the royalists suffered the loss of the Earl of Northampton.Gresley, G. A true account of the raysing and imployeing of one foote regiment under Sir John Gell from the beginning of October, 1642 (in Stone, 1992) Gell was appointed Governor of Derby in 1643. =Post Civil War= Gell had an irascible nature and a dictatorial way with both his regiment and his colleagues in the county administration which made enemies and provoked complaints to Parliament.Derbyshire Record Office D258/34/10 He also became disaffected with the Parliamentary commanders in the Northern and East Midlands regions and was out of sympathy with the political direction taken by the regime which emerged after the king's surrender in 1646, as he argued in a petition to the king at Charles II's restorationDerbyshire Record Office D258/56/28h A further cause of disillusionment for Gell was Parliament's reluctance to compensate him for losses he incurred in fighting the war.Derbyshire Record Office D258/31/30g In 1646 his regiment was disbanded and in 1648 he was relieved of all appointmentsHouse of Commons Journal, VI, p150, 23 February 1648 (copy in Derbyshire Record Office D3287/1043/4) He moved permanently to London, having previously transferred his estate to his son John, with whom he kept up a regular correspondence on politics, family matters and the running of the estateDerbyshire Record Office D258/30/14/2 In London he made contact with the king, asking pardon for his part in the war and making a gift of ¬£300.Derbyshire Record Office D258/56/28h In 1650 he was tried and found guilty of misprision of treason, in other words of knowing of a royalist plot and not revealing it to the authorities.

It is boosted into space by a launch vehicle, then re-enters Earth's atmosphere and lands as a spaceplane. The X-37 is operated by the United States Space Force for orbital spaceflight missions intended to demonstrate reusable space technologies. It is a 120-percent- scaled derivative of the earlier Boeing X-40. The X-37 began as a NASA project in 1999, before being transferred to the United States Department of Defense in 2004. The X-37 first flew during a drop test in 2006; its first orbital mission was launched in April 2010 on an Atlas V rocket, and returned to Earth in December 2010. Subsequent flights gradually extended the mission duration, reaching in orbit for the fifth mission, the first to launch on a Falcon 9 rocket. The latest mission, the sixth, launched on an Atlas V on 17 May 2020. Development =Origins= An artist's rendering of the X-37 spacecraft in 1999 In 1999, NASA selected Boeing Integrated Defense Systems to design and develop an orbital vehicle, built by the California branch of Boeing's Phantom Works. Over a four-year period, a total of US$192 million was spent on the project, with NASA contributing $109 million, the U.S. Air Force $16 million, and Boeing $67 million. In late 2002, a new $301-million contract was awarded to Boeing as part of NASA's Space Launch Initiative framework. The aerodynamic design of the X-37 was derived from the larger Space Shuttle orbiter, hence the X-37 has a similar lift-to-drag ratio, and a lower cross range at higher altitudes and Mach numbers compared to DARPA's Hypersonic Technology Vehicle. An early requirement for the spacecraft called for a total mission delta-v of for orbital maneuvers. An early goal for the program was for the X-37 to rendezvous with satellites and perform repairs. The X-37 was originally designed to be carried into orbit in the cargo bay of the Space Shuttle, but underwent redesign for launch on a Delta IV or comparable rocket after it was determined that a shuttle flight would be uneconomical. The X-37 was transferred from NASA to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) on 13 September 2004. Thereafter, the program became a classified project. DARPA promoted the X-37 as part of the independent space policy that the United States Department of Defense has pursued since the 1986 Challenger disaster. =Glide testing= The Scaled Composites White Knight was used to launch the X-37A on glide tests. The vehicle that was used as an atmospheric drop test glider had no propulsion system. Instead of an operational vehicle's payload bay doors, it had an enclosed and reinforced upper fuselage structure to allow it to be mated with a mothership. In September 2004, DARPA announced that for its initial atmospheric drop tests the X-37 would be launched from the Scaled Composites White Knight, a high-altitude research aircraft. On 21 June 2005, the X-37A completed a captive-carry flight underneath the White Knight from Mojave Spaceport in Mojave, California. Through the second half of 2005, the X-37A underwent structural upgrades, including the reinforcement of its nose wheel supports. The X-37's public debut was scheduled for its first free flight on 10 March 2006, but was canceled due to an Arctic storm. The next flight attempt, on 15 March 2006, was canceled due to high winds. On 24 March 2006, the X-37 flew again, but a datalink failure prevented a free flight, and the vehicle returned to the ground still attached to its White Knight carrier aircraft. On 7 April 2006, the X-37 made its first free glide flight. During landing, the vehicle overran the runway and sustained minor damage. Following the vehicle's extended downtime for repairs, the program moved from Mojave to Air Force Plant 42 (KPMD) in Palmdale, California, for the remainder of the flight test program. White Knight continued to be based at Mojave, though it was ferried to Plant 42 when test flights were scheduled. Five additional flights were performed,Source of flights: mission markings posted on side of White Knight aircraft. two of which resulted in X-37 releases with successful landings. These two free flights occurred on 18 August 2006 and 26 September 2006. =X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle= On 17 November 2006, the U.S. Air Force announced that it would develop its own variant from NASA's X-37A. The Air Force version was designated the X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle (OTV). The OTV program was built on earlier industry and government efforts by DARPA, NASA, and the Air Force under the leadership of the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office in partnership with NASA and the Air Force Research Laboratory. Boeing was the prime contractor for the OTV program. The X-37B was designed to remain in orbit for up to 270 days at a time. The Secretary of the Air Force stated that the OTV program would focus on \\"risk reduction, experimentation, and operational concept development for reusable space vehicle technologies, in support of long-term developmental space objectives\\". The X-37B was originally scheduled for launch in the payload bay of the Space Shuttle, but following the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, it was transferred to a Delta II 7920. The X-37B was subsequently transferred to a shrouded configuration on the Atlas V rocket, following concerns over the unshrouded spacecraft's aerodynamic properties during launch. Following their missions, X-37B spacecraft primarily land on a runway at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, with Edwards Air Force Base as a secondary site. In 2010, manufacturing work began on the second X-37B, OTV-2, which conducted its maiden launch in March 2011. On 8 October 2014, NASA confirmed that X-37B vehicles would be housed at Kennedy Space Center in Orbiter Processing Facilities (OPF) 1 and 2, hangars previously occupied by the Space Shuttle. Boeing had said the space planes would use OPF-1 in January 2014, and the Air Force had previously said it was considering consolidating X-37B operations, housed at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, nearer to their launch site at Cape Canaveral. NASA also stated that the program had completed tests to determine whether the X-37B, one-fourth the size of the Space Shuttle, could land on the former Shuttle runways. NASA furthermore stated that renovations of the two hangars would be completed by the end of 2014; the main doors of OPF-1 were marked with the message \\"Home of the X-37B\\" by this point. Most of the activities of the X-37B project are secret. The official U.S. Air Force statement is that the project is \\"an experimental test program to demonstrate technologies for a reliable, reusable, uncrewed space test platform for the U.S. Air Force\\". The primary objectives of the X-37B are twofold: reusable spacecraft technology and operating experiments which can be returned to Earth. The Air Force states that this includes testing avionics, flight systems, guidance and navigation, thermal protection, insulation, propulsion, and re-entry systems. =Speculation regarding purpose= In May 2010, Tom Burghardt speculated on Space Daily that the X-37B could be used as a spy satellite or to deliver weapons from space. The Pentagon subsequently denied claims that the X-37B's test missions supported the development of space-based weapons. In January 2012, allegations were made that the X-37B was being used to spy on China's Tiangong-1 space station module. Former U.S. Air Force orbital analyst Brian Weeden later refuted this claim, emphasizing that the different orbits of the two spacecraft precluded any practical surveillance flybys. In October 2014, The Guardian reported the claims of security experts that the X-37B was being used \\"to test reconnaissance and spy sensors, particularly how they hold up against radiation and other hazards of orbit\\". In November 2016, the International Business Times speculated that the U.S. government was testing a version of the EmDrive electromagnetic microwave thruster on the fourth flight of the X-37B. In 2009, an EmDrive technology transfer contract with Boeing was undertaken via a State Department TAA and a UK export license, approved by the UK Ministry of Defence. Boeing has since stated that it is no longer pursuing this area of research. The U.S. Air Force has stated that the X-37B is testing a Hall-effect thruster system for Aerojet Rocketdyne. In July 2019, former United States Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson explained that when an X-37B was in an elliptic orbit it could at perigee use the thin atmosphere to make an orbit change preventing some observers from discovering the new orbit for a while, permitting secret activities. Astronomer Jonathan McDowell, editor of Jonathan's Space Report, has stated that satellites launched from the X-37B were not reported, as required by the Registration Convention, to the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs so other parties to the convention would not know about them. The Chinese Space Program landed its first reusable winged space plane on 6 September 2020. It was reported to weigh , and be long, i.e. closer to size of the X-37 than the space shuttle. Knowledgeable commentators speculated that the Chinese built their space plane to follow the US's X-37 example. When asked to speculate on the Chinese spaceplane's role Brian Weedon, director of program planning for the Secure World Foundation said, \\"It's a great question. We're not even really sure why the U.S. military is pursuing a space plane.\\" =Processing= Processing for the X-37 is done inside Bays 1 and 2 of the Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF) at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, where the vehicle is loaded with its top-secret payload. The X-37 is then placed inside a fairing along with its stage adapter and transported to the launch site. Previous launch sites have included SLC-41 and Kennedy Space Center LC-39A. Landing is done at one of three sites across the US: the Shuttle Landing Facility at Kennedy Space Center, Vandenberg Air Force Base, or Edwards Air Force Base. To return to Kennedy Space Center, the X-37 is placed into a payload canister and loaded into a Boeing C-17 cargo plane. Once at Kennedy, the X-37 is unloaded and towed to the OPF, where it is prepared for its next flight. Design orbital spaceplane yet flown. Both the North American X-15 and SpaceShipOne were suborbital. Of the spaceplanes shown, only the X-37 and Buran conducted uncrewed spaceflights. The X-37 Orbital Test Vehicle is a reusable robotic spaceplane. It is an approximately 120-percent- scale derivative of the Boeing X-40, measuring over in length, and features two angled tail fins. The X-37 launches atop an Atlas V 501 or a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The spaceplane is designed to operate in a speed range of up to Mach 25 on its reentry. The technologies demonstrated in the X-37 include an improved thermal protection system, enhanced avionics, an autonomous guidance system and an advanced airframe. The spaceplane's thermal protection system is built upon previous generations of atmospheric reentry spacecraft, incorporating silica ceramic tiles. The X-37's avionics suite was used by Boeing to develop its CST-100 crewed spacecraft. The development of the X-37 was to \\"aid in the design and development of NASA's Orbital Space Plane, designed to provide a crew rescue and crew transport capability to and from the International Space Station\\", according to a NASA fact sheet. The X-37 for NASA was to be powered by one Aerojet AR2-3 engine using storable propellants, providing thrust of . The human-rated AR2-3 engine had been used on the dual- power NF-104A astronaut training vehicle and was given a new flight certification for use on the X-37 with hydrogen peroxide/JP-8 propellants. This was reportedly changed to a hypergolic nitrogen-tetroxide/hydrazine propulsion system. The X-37 lands automatically upon returning from orbit and is the second reusable spacecraft to have such a capability, after the Soviet Buran shuttle. The X-37 is the smallest and lightest orbital spaceplane flown to date; it has a launch mass of around and is approximately one quarter of the size of the Space Shuttle orbiter. On 13 April 2015, the Space Foundation awarded the X-37 team with the 2015 Space Achievement Award \\"for significantly advancing the state of the art for reusable spacecraft and on-orbit operations, with the design, development, test and orbital operation of the X-37B space flight vehicle over three missions totaling 1,367 days in space\\". Operational history , the two operational X-37Bs have completed five orbital missions; they have spent a combined 2,865 days (7.85 years) in space. {|class=\\"sortable wikitable\\"  Flight  Vehicle  Launch date  Landing date  Launcher  Mission  Duration  class=\\"unsortable\\" Notes |- !scope=rowOTV-1 1 23:52 UTC 09:16 UTC Atlas V 501 USA-212  * First launch of Atlas V 501 configuration * First American autonomous orbital runway landing * First X-37B flight |- !scope=rowOTV-2 2 22:46 UTC 12:48 UTC Atlas V 501 USA-226  * First flight of second X-37B |- !scope=rowOTV-3 1 18:03 UTC 16:24 UTC Atlas V 501 USA-240  * Second flight of first X-37B |- !scope=rowOTV-4 2 15:05 UTC 11:47 UTC Atlas V 501 USA-261  * Second flight of second X-37B * First landing on the Shuttle Landing Facility at Kennedy Space Center |- !scope=rowOTV-5 unknown 14:00 UTC 07:51 UTC Falcon 9 USA-277  * First launch of an X-37B on SpaceX's Falcon 9 vehicle * Longest X-37B mission |- !scope=rowOTV-6 unknown 13:14 UTC  Atlas V 501 USSF-7  * Carried most experiments to date * First X-37B launch by USSF |} =OTV-1= OTV-1 sits on the runway after landing at Vandenberg AFB at the close of its USA-212 mission on 3 December 2010. The first X-37B launched on its first mission ‚Äì OTV-1/USA-212 ‚Äì on an Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral SLC-41 on 22 April 2010 at 23:52 UTC. The spacecraft was placed into low Earth orbit for testing. While the U.S. Air Force revealed few orbital details of the mission, a worldwide network of amateur astronomers claimed to have identified the spacecraft in orbit. On 22 May 2010, the spacecraft was in an inclination of 39.99¬∞, circling the Earth once every 90 minutes on an orbit . OTV-1 reputedly passed over the same given spot on Earth every four days, and operated at an altitude that is typical for military surveillance satellites. Such an orbit is also common among civilian LEO satellites, and the spaceplane's altitude was the same as that of the ISS and most other crewed spacecraft. The U.S. Air Force announced a 3‚Äì6 December landing on 30 November 2010. As scheduled, the X-37B was de-orbited, reentered Earth's atmosphere, and landed successfully at Vandenberg AFB on 3 December 2010, at 09:16 UTC, conducting the first US autonomous orbital landing onto a runway. This was the first such landing since the Soviet Buran shuttle in 1988. In all, OTV-1 spent in space. OTV-1 suffered a tire blowout during landing and sustained minor damage to its underside. =OTV-2= The second X-37B launched on its inaugural mission, designated OTV-2/USA-226, aboard an Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral SLC-41 on 5 March 2011 at 22:46 UTC. The mission was classified and described by the U.S. military as an effort to test new space technologies. On 29 November 2011, the U.S. Air Force announced that it would extend USA-226 beyond the 270-day baseline duration. In April 2012, General William L. Shelton of the Air Force Space Command declared the ongoing mission a \\"spectacular success\\". On 30 May 2012, the Air Force stated that the X-37B would land at Vandenberg AFB in June 2012. The spacecraft landed autonomously on 16 June 2012, having spent in space. =OTV-3= The third mission and second flight of the first X-37B, OTV-3 was originally scheduled to launch on 25 October 2012, but was postponed because of an engine issue with the Atlas V launch vehicle. It was successfully launched from Cape Canaveral SLC-41 on 11 December 2012 at 18:03 UTC. Once in orbit, the spacecraft was designated USA-240. Landing occurred at Vandenberg AFB on 17 October 2014 at 16:24 UTC, after a total time in orbit of . =OTV-4= OTV-4 stationary at the Shuttle Landing Facility The fourth X-37B mission, OTV-4, was codenamed AFSPC-5 and designated as USA-261 in orbit. It was the second flight of the second X-37B vehicle. The X-37B launched on an Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral SLC-41 on 20 May 2015 at 15:05 UTC. Objectives included a test of Aerojet Rocketdyne's XR-5A Hall-effect thruster in support of the Advanced Extremely High Frequency communications satellite program, and a NASA investigation on the performance of various materials in space for at least 200 days. The vehicle spent what was then a record-breaking in orbit before landing at Kennedy Space Center's Shuttle Landing Facility on 7 May 2017 at 11:47 UTC. =OTV-5= The fifth X-37B mission, designated USA-277 in orbit, was launched from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A on 7 September 2017 at 14:00 UTC, just before the arrival of Hurricane Irma. The launch vehicle was a Falcon 9 rocket, and a number of small satellites also shared the ride. The spacecraft was inserted at a higher inclination orbit than previous missions, further expanding the X-37B's envelope. During the flight, the spacecraft modified its orbit using an on-board propulsion system. While the complete payload for OTV-5 is classified, the Air Force announced that one experiment flying is the Advanced Structurally Embedded Thermal Spreader II (ASETS-II), which measures the performance of an oscillating heat pipe. The mission was completed with the vehicle landing at the Shuttle Landing Facility on 27 October 2019 at 07:51 UTC. =OTV-6 (USSF 7)= The sixth X-37B mission (OTV-6), U.S. Space Force 7 (formerly known as AFSPC 7), launched on an Atlas V 501 rocket from Cape Canaveral SLC-41 on 17 May 2020 at 13:14 UTC. The mission hosts more experiments than prior X-37B flights, including two NASA experiments. One is a sample plate evaluating the reaction of select materials to conditions in space. The second studies the effect of ambient space radiation on seeds. A third experiment designed by the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) transforms solar power into radio frequency microwave energy, then studies transmitting that energy to Earth. The X-37B remains a Department of the Air Force asset, but the newly established U.S. Space Force is responsible for the launch, on-orbit operations, and landing. The X-37B released a small, satellite named FalconSAT-8 (USA-300) around 28 May 2020. Developed by United States Air Force Academy cadets in partnership with the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), the small satellite carries five experimental payloads. The spacecraft will test a novel electromagnetic propulsion system, low-weight antenna technology and a commercial reaction wheel to provide attitude control in orbit. According to the United States Air Force Academy, FalconSAT-8's experiments include: * Magnetogradient Electrostatic Plasma Thruster (MEP) ‚Äì Novel electromagnetic propulsion system * Metamaterials Antenna (MMA) ‚Äì Low size, weight, power antenna with phased- array like performance * Carbon nanotube experiment (CANOE) ‚Äì RF cabling with carbon nanotube braiding flexed using shape-memory alloy * Attitude Control and Energy Storage (ACES) ‚Äì Commercial reaction wheel modified into a flywheel for energy storage and release * SkyPad ‚Äì Off-the-shelf cameras and GPUs integrated into low-SWAP (size, weight and power) package Variants =X-37A= The X-37A Approach and Landing Test Vehicle (ALTV) was an initial NASA version of the spacecraft used in drop glide tests in 2005 and 2006. =X-37B= The X-37B is a modified version of the NASA X-37A, built for the U.S. Air Force. Two were built and have been used for multiple orbital missions. =X-37C= In 2011, Boeing announced plans for a scaled-up variant of the X-37B, referring to it as the X-37C. The X-37C spacecraft would be between 165% and 180% of the size of the X-37B, allowing it to transport up to six astronauts inside a pressurized compartment housed in the cargo bay. Its proposed launch vehicle was the Atlas V. In this role, Boeing's X-37C could potentially compete with the corporation's CST-100 Starliner commercial space capsule.

BBN offered TELCOMP as a paid service, with first revenue in October 1965.http://walden-family.com/bbn/bbn- print2.pdf The service was sold to a company called On-Line Systems in 1972. In the United Kingdom, TELCOMP was offered by Time Sharing, Ltd, a partnership between BBN and an entrepreneur named Richard Evans. It was an interactive, conversational language based on JOSS, developed by BBN after Cliff Shaw from RAND visited the labs in 1964 as part of the NIH survey. It was first implemented on the PDP-1 and was used to provide a commercial time sharing service by BBN in the Boston area and later by Time Sharing Ltd. in the United Kingdom. In 1996, Leo Beranek said \\"We even developed a programming language called TELCOMP that to this day, some say was better than the programming language that the industry adopted, namely BASIC.\\" There were at least three versions: TELCOMP I, TELCOMP II, and TELCOMP III. TELCOMP I was implemented on the PDP-1, TELCOMP II on the PDP-7 and TELCOMP III on the PDP-10, running on DEC 's TOPS-10 operating system or on BBN's own TENEX operating system. TELCOMP programs were normally input via a paper tape reader on a Teletype Model 33, which would be connected to a PDP via a modem and acoustic telephone line. Data could be read from the paper tape reader or from the Teletype keyboard. Output was either printed to the Teletype or sent to the paper tape punch. Early versions had no facility for on-line storage of programs or data. During data input using a Teletype, the user would type a response to a printed prompt. If, instead of hitting , the user hit , another, possibly computed, prompt would be printed on the same line. This process could be repeated for the full width of the line. This unusual feature allowed very compact data entry, comparable to full-screen CRT data entry. It saved paper, and the input section of the form became part of the program's printed output. A later derivative of TELCOMP called STRINGCOMP was oriented towards string handling. Another BBN JOSS-derivative called FILECOMP was developed for the GE MEDINET system, which was cancelled. The implicit file handling system it contained was influential on the MUMPS global database system. The initial research for LOGO was carried out in TELCOMP, but only the JOSS-style errors and interaction made it through to the actual language.

Stocker played with the Philadelphia Phillies (1993‚Äì1997), Tampa Bay Devil Rays (1998‚Äì2000) and Anaheim Angels (2000). A 1988 graduate of Central Valley High School in Spokane Valley, Stocker attended the University of Washington in Seattle, where he played college baseball for the Huskies from 1989-1991. Stocker was also a member of the fraternity Lambda Chi Alpha. Stocker was selected by Philadelphia in the 1991 MLB draft, taken in the second round with the 54th overall selection. He made his major league debut in 1993 on July 7 at Veterans Stadium in a marathon game that lasted 6 hours and 10 minutes. Stocker played all 20 innings in the defeat of the Los Angeles Dodgers 7-6. Stocker was credited with a game-saving play in the tenth inning when he made a miraculous throw to home-plate for a force-out. That year, the Phillies went on to be the World Series runners-up. In his rookie season, Stocker batted .324 with two home runs and 31 RBI in 70 games. He was the regular Phillies shortstop through the 1997 season. In 1997 he enjoyed his best season, compiling career-highs in games played (149), runs (51), doubles (23) and stolen bases (11), adding five triples, four homers and 41 RBI. During the 1997 expansion draft, Stocker was traded to Tampa Bay in exchange for Bobby Abreu. After two-plus seasons, he was released and signed with Anaheim. In an eight-season career, Stocker batted .254 with 23 home runs and 248 RBI. He now owns an Emerald City Smoothie franchise in Washington. Post-playing career Stocker has served as a color analyst for 14 seasons (as of 2014). He is currently in his second season with the Pac-12 Network, after a stint with CBS Sports Network. In January 2018, it was announced that Stocker would be serving as a part-time color analyst for Phillies radio broadcasts during the 2018 season.

She was the elder sister of William Aigret and the younger sister of Eleanor of Aquitaine, who was Queen consort of France, later England. She is variously called Alix (or Aelith in Occitan) and Petronilla; she typically went by Alix after her marriage, while Petronilla seems to have been her childhood name (she is referred to as such in her father's will). Petronilla accompanied her sister to the French court, where she met Count Raoul I of Vermandois, who was a married man and a cousin to her brother-in-law Louis VII of France. He repudiated his wife and married her, and they were excommunicated by Pope Innocent II in 1142. Hostilities flared, and Louis VII infamously burned Vitry-le-Fran√ßois. Pope Eugenius III renewed the excommunication in 1145, but eventually lifted it at the Council of Reims in 1148. The exact date of Petronilla's death is unknown, although she must have died at some point between the Council of Reims in 1148 and 1152 when Raoul was married for a third time to Laure, daughter of Thierry of Alsace, count of Flanders. Petronilla was buried in the Cluniac priory of Saint-Arnoul in Cr√©py-en-Valois, where Raoul was later interred alongside her. Together Raoul and Petronilla had three children: *Elisabeth, Countess of Vermandois also known as Isabelle Mabile (1143 ‚Äì 28 March 1183), married Philip, Count of Flanders. *Ralph II, Count of Vermandois (1145‚Äì1167), married Margaret I, Countess of Flanders. *Eleanor, Countess of Vermandois (1148/49 ‚Äì 1213), married four times.

According to Sufi tradition, this formula was introduced by Abu Bakr as he initiated the Naqshbandi tradition (Kabbani 2003 p. 87). Other Dhikrs consist of simple AllƒÅhu AllƒÅhu run together 400 or 600 times. \\"Allah Hoo\\" is also a popular title for Urdu-language Sufi devotional qawwalis. Etymology The \\"Hoo\\" is due to the nominative suffix (i\`rab) -u (·∏çamma) being pronounced before initial vowel, as the word Allahu is run together several times: Allahu Allahu Allahu is rendered as /al:a:hual:a:hual:a:h/ (compare the phrase Allahu Akbar where the -u is also audible). In traditional Sufi chant, the length of the -u is exaggerated. As a noun phrase, the chant is interpreted as meaning \\"God is\\". Haqq is the Arabic for \\"truth\\", so that the full dhikr translates to \\"God is. God is. God is Truth.\\"the naat starts of like this Allahu diya paiyan pukaran aqa aye ayan bharan Qawwali Qawwalis titled \\"Allah Hoo\\" have been performed by many different qawwals.

For example, the \\"Allah Hoo\\" that appears on the Sabri Brothers 1998 CD Qawwali: Sufi Music from Pakistan is totally different from the song that became one of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan's signature qawwalis, and this in turn is totally different from Qawwal Bahauddin's version on the 1991 Shalimar compilation video titled \\"Tajdar-e- Haram, vol. 2\\" (although all three songs do have some lyrics in common). Versions of the song have also been sung by many other qawwals and Sufi singers, including Hans Raj Hans, Master Salim, and Faiz Ali Faiz. Versions of the song have been translated into other languages. An English version is sung by Sami Yusuf on the album Al-Mu\`allim (2003), while a Malay version is sung by a popular Malaysian Nasheed group, Raihan.

Hanns Heinz Ewers at the age of 4. Hanns Heinz Ewers (3 November 1871 ‚Äì 12 June 1943) was a German actor, poet, philosopher and writer of short stories and novels. While he wrote on a wide range of subjects, he is now known mainly for his works of horror, particularly his trilogy of novels about the adventures of Frank Braun, a character modeled on himself. The best known of these is Alraune (1911).Henry and Mary Garland, The Oxford companion to German literature.Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1997. (pp.221‚Äì222).Mary Ellen Snodgrass,Encyclopedia of Gothic Literature. New York, Facts on File (2004). (p.106-7)  Career  Born at D√ºsseldorf, Ewers started to write poetry when he was 17 years old. His first noticed poem was an obituary tribute to the German Emperor Frederick III. Ewers earned his Abitur in March 1891. He then volunteered for the military and joined the Kaiser-Alexander- Gardegrenadier-Regiment No. 1, but was dismissed 44 days later because of myopia. Ewers's literary career began with a volume of satiric verse, entitled A Book of Fables, published in 1901. That same year he collaborated with Ernst von Wolzogen in forming a literary vaudeville theatre before forming his own such company, which toured Central and Eastern Europe before the operating expenses and constant interference from censors caused him to abandon the enterprise. A world traveler, Ewers was in South America at the beginning of World War I, and relocated to New York City, where he continued to write and publish. Ewers' reputation as a successful German author and performer made him a natural speaker for the Imperial German cause to keep the United States from joining the war as an ally of Britain. Ewers toured cities with large ethnic German communities and raised funds for the German Red Cross. During this period, he was involved with the \\"Stegler Affair\\". American shipping companies sympathetic to the fight against Imperial Germany reportedly aided the British in identifying German-descended passengers traveling to Germany to volunteer for the Kaiser's army. Many were arrested and interned in prison camps by the British Navy; eventually, German volunteers often required false passports to reach Europe unmolested. Ewers was implicated as a German agent by one of these ethnic Germans, Richard Stegler. After the United States joined the war he was arrested in 1918 as an \\"active propagandist,\\" as the US government, as well as British and French intelligence agencies asserted that Ewers was a German agent. They evidenced his travels to Spain during 1915 and 1916, both with an alias using a falsified Swiss passport.E. F. Bleiler, \\"Ewers, Hanns Heinz\\" in Sullivan, Jack, (ed.) The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural. (pp. 145‚Äì6). Viking, New York. 1986. Later, a travel report in the archives of the German Foreign Office was discovered indicating that he may have been traveling to Mexico, perhaps to encourage Pancho Villa to hamper the U.S. military by an attack on the United States. Ewers is associated with the pro-German George Sylvester Viereck,\\"Ewers, Hanns Heinz\\" by Brian Stableford in David Pringle, St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost and Gothic Writers. London : St. James Press, 1998, (pp. 665‚Äì66). son of the German immigrant and reported illegitimate Hohenzollern offspring Louis Sylvester Viereck (a Social Democrat famous for sharing a prison cell with August Bebel), who was a member of the same Berlin student corps (fraternity) as Ewers. Ewers' activities as an \\"Enemy Alien\\" in New York were documented by J. Christoph Amberger in the German historical journal Einst & Jetzt (1991). Amberger indicates arrival records which demonstrate that Ewers entered the United States in the company of a \\"Grethe Ewers,\\" who is identified as his wife. Enemy Alien Office records refer to a recent divorce. The identity of this otherwise undocumented wife has never been established and is missing from most biographies. As a German national he was sent to the internment camp at Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia. Ewers was never tried as a German agent in the United States. In 1921, he was released from the internment camp and returned to his native Germany. Ewers's first novel, Der Zauberlehrling (The Sorcerer's Apprentice), was published in 1910, with an English translation published in America in 1927. It introduces the character of Frank Braun, who, like Ewers, is a writer, historian, philosopher, and world traveler with a decidedly Nietzschean morality. The story concerns Braun's attempts to influence a small cult of Evangelical Christians in a small Italian mountain village for his own financial gain, and the horrific results which ensue. This was followed in 1911 by Alraune, a reworking of the Frankenstein myth, in which Braun collaborates in creating a female homunculus or android by impregnating a prostitute with the semen from an executed murderer. The result is a young woman without morals, who commits numerous monstrous acts. Alraune was influenced by the ideas of the eugenics movement, especially the book Degeneration by Max Nordau. Alraune has been generally well received by historians of the horror genre; Mary Ellen Snodgrass describes Alraune as \\"Ewers' decadent masterwork\\", Brian Stableford argues Alraune \\"deserves recognition as the most extreme of all \\"femme fatale\\" stories\\" and E.F. Bleiler states the scenes in Alraune set in the Berlin underworld as among the best parts of the novel. The novel was filmed several times, most recently in a German version with Erich von Stroheim in 1952. Bleiler notes \\"Both Alraune and The Sorcerer's Apprentice are remarkable for the emotion the author can arouse\\" and that Ewers' writing is, at its best, \\"very effective\\". However, Bleiler also argues Ewers' work is marred by \\"annoying pretentiousness, vulgarity, and a very obtrusive and unpleasant author's personality\\". The third novel of the sequence, Vampyr, written in 1921, concerns Braun's own eventual transformation into a vampire, drinking the blood of his Jewish mistress. Another novel, Der Geisterseher (The Ghost-Seer), Ewers' completion of the Friedrich Schiller novel, was published in 1922; Ewers' version was received badly. Ewers also wrote the novel Reiter in deutscher Nacht (Riders in the German Night) published in 1932. Ewers wrote numerous short stories, those in Nachtmahr (\\"Nightmare\\") largely concern \\"pornography, blood sport, torture and execution\\". Stories translated into English include the often anthologised \\"The Spider\\" (1915), a tale of black magic based on the story \\"The Invisible Eye\\" by Erckmann-Chatrian; \\"Blood\\", about knife fights to the death; and \\"The Execution of Damiens\\", a story about the execution of the 18th-century French criminal Robert-Fran√ßois Damiens that achieved some notoriety for its violence. Ewers also published several plays, poems, fairy tales, opera librettos, and critical essays. These included Die Ameisen, translated into English as The Ant People, Indien und ich, a travelogue of his time in India, and a 1916 critical essay on Edgar Allan Poe, to whom he has often been compared. Indeed, Ewers is still considered by some as a major author in the evolution of the horror literary genre, cited as an influence by American horror writers such as H. P. Lovecraft and Guy Endore. Students of the occult are also attracted to his works, due to his longtime friendship and correspondence with Aleister Crowley. Ewers also translated several French writers into German, including Villiers de l'Isle-Adam. Ewers also edited the eight-volume Galerie der Phantasten anthologies of horror and fantasy literature, featuring work by Poe, E. T. A. Hoffmann, Oskar Panizza, Honor√© de Balzac, Alfred Kubin, Ewers' friend Karl Hans Strobl, Gustavo Adolfo B√©cquer and Ewers himself.Verna Schuetz, The bizarre literature of Hanns Heinz Ewers, Alfred Kubin, Gustav Meyrink, and Karl Hans Strobl. (p.12) University of Wisconsin‚ÄîMadison, 1974. During the time Ewers was writing his major horror stories, he was also giving lectures (between 1910 and 1925) on the topic Die Religion des Satan (The Religion of Satan), inspired by Stanis≈Çaw Przybyszewski's 1897 German book Die Synagoge des Satan (The Synagogue of Satan).Per Faxneld, Witches, Anarchism, and Evolutionism, in The Devil's Party, Chapter 3, Oxford University Press, 2013: ...from the 1910s and onwards (until at least 1925), horror author and poet Hanns Heinz Ewers (1871-1943) held wildly popular lectures with the title \\"Die Religion des Satan\\", based almost verbatim on \\"Die Synagoge des Satan\\". Ewers died in Berlin.  Movie work  Ewers was one of the first critics to recognize cinema as a legitimate art form, and wrote the scripts for numerous early examples of the medium, most notably The Student of Prague (1913), a reworking of the Faust legend which also included the first portrayal of a double role by an actor on the screen. Nazi martyr Horst Wessel, then a member of the same corps (student fraternity) of which Ewers had been a member, acts as an extra in a 1926 version of the movie, also written by Ewers. Ewers was later commissioned by Adolf Hitler to write a biography of Wessel (Einer von vielen), which also was made into a movie.  Nazi involvement  During the last years of the Weimar Republic, Ewers became involved with the burgeoning Nazi Party, attracted by its nationalism, its Nietzschean moral philosophy, and its cult of Teutonic culture, and joined the NSDAP in 1931. He did not agree with the party's anti- Semitism (his character Frank Braun has a Jewish mistress, Lotte Levi, who is also a patriotic German) and this and his homosexual tendencies soon ended his welcome with party leaders. In 1934 most of his works were banned in Germany, and his assets and property seized. Alfred Rosenberg was his main adversary in the party, but after submitting many petitions Ewers eventually secured the rescission of the ban. His last book Die sch√∂nsten H√§nde der Welt (\\"The most beautiful hands in the world\\") was published by the Zinnen Verlag (Munich, Vienna, Leipzig) in 1943. Ewers died from tuberculosis in the same year. Despite his great influence on 20th century fantasy and horror literature, Ewers remains out of favor in bourgeois literary circles (especially in the English-speaking world and Germany) because of his association with the Nazis. As a result, post-World War II editions of his works are often difficult to find, and earlier editions can command a premium price from collectors.  Twenty-first-century translations  In March 2009 Side Real Press issued an English language collection of short stories including some newly translated material. This was followed by a new uncensored translation of Alraune translated by Joe Bandel which sold out after one year. The Alraune Centennial Edition by Bandel Books Online was released in March 2011. The centennial edition translated by Joe Bandel contains an essay by Dr. Wilfried Kugel, noted Ewers biographer. \\"Sorcerer's Apprentice\\", The First Volume in the Frank Braun trilogy was translated by Joe Bandel and published by Bandel Books Online in September 2012. This is the first uncensored English translation of \\"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\\". It includes an Introduction by Dr. Wilfried Kugel; the poems, \\"Prometheus\\" by Goethe, and \\"Hymn to Satan\\" by Carducci; \\"The Satanism of Hanns Heinz Ewers\\", \\"Duality-The Male\\", \\"Duality-The Female\\", and \\"Duality-Sexual Alchemy\\" by Joe Bandel and the complete text of \\"Synagogue of Satan\\" by Stanis≈Çaw Przybyszewski also translated by Joe Bandel. In 2016 Ajna Offensive published Markus Wolff's English translation of Ewers' 1922 novel Die Herzen der K√∂nige (The Hearts of Kings).Ewers, H. H., The Hearts of Kings (Jacksonville, Oregon: Ajna Offensive, 2016). In popular culture Ewers appears in Kim Newman's novel The Bloody Red Baron, as a predatory vampire who travels briefly with Edgar Allan Poe.

In the 1890s, Birla Corporation was a jute manufacturing company, but over time, it grew to operate four main divisions: cement, jute, linoleum, and auto trim. It is not a part of the Aditya Birla Group, a multinational conglomerate with products ranging from metals, cements, textiles, agricultural businesses, telecommunications, IT, and financial services. Formerly known as Birla Jute Manufacturing Company Limited, with the expansion of divisions, the company changed their name in 1998 to Birla Corporation Limited. History File:Birla Family Tree.jpg =Before Birla Corporation Ltd.= Shri Ghanshyam Das Birla‚Äôs grandfather, Shiv Narayana Birla used his capital from a moneylending business and started a cotton business. With a successful venture, he went back to Pilani, his birthplace, and built a mansion for the family. Business boomed with World War I as the British Empire relied on Birla to provide for the war efforts. GD Birla inherited the family business and expanded into many industries, and by 1919, the Birla Brothers Limited was formed with his other three siblings. He ventured into the motor vehicle industry, tea, textiles, cement, chemicals, and by 1942, also organized the United Commercial Bank Limited, one of the first commercial banks of India. While still in the early years of the Birla Group, an inkling of the future of Birla Brothers Limited was depicted in GD Birla‚Äôs life. =Founding of Birla Corporation Ltd.= Born in 1918, Madhav Prasad of Bombay, son of RD Birla, was a part of the Birla Jute Manufacturing Company since the beginning. By the time he finished college, he was already in charge of Birla Jute which had suffered economic downturns and wars. Madhav changed the company from Birla Jute Manufacturing Company to a company with activities across a wide spectrum of industries. In MP Birla‚Äôs time, Birla Corporation and the other businesses under Birla Group gained significant power and stance in the cement, auto trims, steel, and building materials. When he died in 1990, his wife, Priyamvada Birla took over as the chairman of Birla in 1998 and changed the name to Birla Corporation Limited. Priyamvada was known for her active roles in the community, healthcare, and education. Recent Events In 2013, Birla Corporation merged with its subsidiary company, Talavadi Cements Ltd as the firm could not meet requirements for raw materials due to a ban on the mines in Rajasthan. This caused a decrease in the Birla stock around the months of June and July. Problems =Birla vs Lodha dispute= When Priyamvada died in 2004, she gave the Rs 5000 crore estate to her close accountant, Rajendra Singh Lodha, who was a co-chairman. Lodha eventually became chairman of Birla Corporation. This estate included key holdings in the East India Investments Co and Gwalior Webbing, Birla Corporation, Vidhya Telelinks, and Universal cables, among others. However, the Birla family challenged the Lodha family in court in 2008 about the contents of the will, and Priyamvada‚Äôs previous two wills. The case changed course with the sudden death of RS Lodha in October 2008. In her will, Priyamvada declared that after RS Lodha, his son, Harsh Lodha would inherit the estates. Since the will was written in 1999 and was not officially granted \\"probate,\\" the Lodha family currently holds the MP Birla group. = Cement in 2011 = In 2011, Birla Corporation faced problems with overproduction of cement during a long period of decreasing demand. Naturally, Harsh Lodha became worried for the corporation since cement is the largest revenue generator for Birla Corp. He is currently looking into other alternatives for growth in the coal industry. Meanwhile, Birla Corporation has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Assam Mineral Development for a cement plant in Assam where Birla will invest Rs 2500 crores over a time span of three years. In November 2017 it was announced that M.P Birla Cement had agreed to become the co-sponsor of National Club of India Mohun Bagan A.C for the period between December 2019 =Harsh Lodha indicted= Harsh Lodha and his brother, Aditya Lodha, were indicted in 2013 for malpractice. Three members of the Birla Corporation, Om Prakash Agarwal, Suresh Kumar Sharma, and Shashi Agarwal claimed there was malpractice in the firm and alleged misconduct in falsifying the information about the number of partners in the firm. This was a problem as Aditya Lodha had a part in the Chartered Accountant firm Lodha and Company. His brother, Harsh, was the chairman of Birla Corporation. At the time, Lodha and Company was the auditor of Birla Corporations. As a result, the ICAI suspended Harsh and Aditya Lodha for 3 months. = Removal of Harsh Vardhan Lodha = On September 19, 2020, the Calcutta High Court ordered the removal of Harsh Vardhan Lodha from all the directorships and other positions in the trust's and societies of the MP Birla Group of Companies. Healthcare Birla Corporation is a supporter of health, education, and social welfare under the MP Birla Group. Priyamvada Birla showed an interest in health care, helping to build hospitals and funding research ranging from eye health to cardiology, neurology, and orthopedics. She also founded the Priyamvada Birla Cancer Research Institute and joined with Aravind Eye Care Center to build the Priyamvada Birla Aravind Eye Hospital. Medical students train at these hospitals. Education The MP Birla Foundation built many schools in India. These schools include institutions, industrial training in computers, mechanical and electrical studies, a Sanskrit school for students interested in Vedic studies. They also cater to children of employees at Birla with an education taught in Hindi and financial aid for students. The Birla Foundation,Birla Foundation website (archived) founded by MP Birla, strives to develop innovative and strong individuals and prepare them for the world.

One pica is further divided into 12 points. To date, in printing three pica measures are used: * The French pica of 12 Didot points (also called cicero) generally is: 12 √ó 0.376 = . * The American pica of . It was established by the United States Type Founders' Association in 1886. In TeX one pica is of an inch. * The contemporary computer PostScript pica is exactly of an inch or of a foot, i.e. 4.2 mm or 0.1 inches. Publishing applications such as Adobe InDesign and QuarkXPress represent pica measurements with whole-number picas left of a lower-case p, followed by the points number, for example: 5p6 represents 5 picas and 6 points, or 5 picas. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) defined by the World Wide Web Consortium use pc as the abbreviation for pica ( of an inch), and pt for point ( of an inch). The pica is also used in measuring the font capacity and is applied in the process of copyfitting. The font length is measured there by the number of characters per pica (cpp). As books are most often printed with proportional fonts, cpp of a given font is usually a fractional number. For example, an 11-point font (like Helvetica) may have 2.4 cpp, thus a 5-inch (30-pica) line of a usual octavo-sized (6√ó8 in) book page would contain around 72 characters (including spaces). There have existed copyfitting tables for a number of typefaces, and typefoundries often provided the number of characters per pica for each type in their specimen catalogs. Similar tables exist as well with which one can estimate the number of characters per pica knowing the lower- case alphabet length. The typographic pica must not be confused with the Pica font of the typewriters, which means a font where 10 typed characters make up a line one inch long.

Origin  Frederick Herzberg, an American psychologist, originally developed the concept of 'job enrichment' in 1968, in an article that he published on pioneering studies at AT&T.;Frederick Herzberg, HBR Jan 2003, One More Time: How Do You Motivate Employees? Retrieved from https://hbr.org/2003/01/one-more-time-how-do-you-motivate-employees/ar/1 The concept stemmed from Herzberg's motivator-hygiene theory, which is based on the premise that job attitude is a construct of two independent factors, namely job satisfaction and job dissatisfaction. Job satisfaction encompasses intrinsic factors which arise from the work itself, including achievement and advancement, whilst job dissatisfaction stems from factors external to the actual work, including company policy and the quality of supervision. He came up with this term while he was working on his \\"two factor theory\\" which states that both satisfaction (e.g. job satisfaction) and dissatisfaction are driven by separate factors that are completely independent of each other. To this effect he implies that just because an individual experiences a decrease in dissatisfaction, does not mean that the result is also an increase in satisfaction. Advantages and disadvantages =Advantages= *Learn new skills: By having more responsibilities, the employee will have the chance to work on new tasks and therefore learn new skills. Decision making can lead to the employee to think, decide, and try new things. By having to learn new skills, the employee has the opportunity to become proficient at certain tasks and even become experts. *Reduce boredom: Job enrichment focuses on giving employees more variety and responsibilities. The target of job enrichment is to reduce the chance of boredom from the repetitive, tedious activities. *Creates a better work environment: The net result of job enrichment is an overall more positive environment that promotes maximum productivity. This is simply because employees who are treated better tend to have better attitudes around the work place and tend to spread that positivism around the office. =Disadvantages= *Lack of preparation: Because employees are given more activities and responsibilities in job enrichment, they do not necessarily have the right skills or experience for the job. Because the employee is not prepared or trained enough to do the activity, then they may not be as efficient as someone who is already trained or skilled in that particular activity. As a result, they may have a lower productivity rate. *Heavier Workload: Job enrichment increases the employee's overall workload. This requires skill in reprioritization for the employee. Some employees may not be able to quickly adjust to their new responsibilities. Employees may feel overloaded and tired, so they may have a lower productivity rate. *Clash with Non-participants: Understandably, not every employee at a company can participate in job enrichment. Those who cannot join may feel disconnected from the company and not part of the team. The employees who cannot join may even feel jealous towards participants. *Poor Performance: As a result of lack of preparation and heavier workload, some employees may not perform as efficient as prior to job enrichment. These employees may actually work better in a non job-enriching environment. By not doing as well as desired, they may feel inept. Their poor performance may lead to demotions, which tends to have a negative impact on the employee's self ‚Äìconfidence and motivation.  Techniques  Job enrichment, as a managerial activity, includes a three-step technique:http://www.tutor2u.net/business/people/motivation-financial-job- enrichment.asp #Turn employees' effort into performance: #* Ensuring that objectives are well-defined and understood by everyone. The overall corporate mission statement should be communicated to all. Individuals' goals should also be clear: each employee should know exactly how he/she fits into the overall process and be aware of how important their contribution is to the organization and its customers. #* Providing adequate resources for each employee to perform well. This includes support functions like information technology, communication technology, and personnel training and development. #* Creating a supportive corporate culture. This includes peer support networks, supportive management, and removing elements that foster mistrust and politicking. #* Free flow of information. Eliminate secrecy. #* Provide enough freedom to facilitate job excellence. Encourage and reward employee initiative. Flextime or compressed hours could be offered. #* Provide adequate recognition, appreciation, and other motivators. #* Provide skill improvement opportunities. This could include paid education at universities or on the job training. #* Provide job variety. This can be done by job sharing or job rotation programmes. #* It may be necessary to re-engineer the job process. This could involve redesigning the physical facility, redesign processes, change technologies, simplification of procedures, elimination of repetitiveness, redesigning authority structures. # Link employees performance directly to reward: #* Clear definition of the reward is a must #* Explanation of the link between performance and reward is important #* Make sure the employee gets the right reward if performs well #* If reward is not given, explanation is needed # Make sure the employee wants the reward. How to find out? #* Ask them #* Use surveys (checklist, listing, questions). Once you know what the employees want, give them the tools they need to earn it and follow through on your word.  Versus job enlargement  Job enrichment can be contrasted to job enlargement which simply increases the number of tasks without changing the challenge. Job enrichment is seen as a vertical job restructuring technique where the focus is on giving the employee more authority, independence, and control over the manner the activity is completed. On the other hand, job enlargement is seen as a horizontal restructuring technique where the focus is merely increasing the number of assignments but does not change the overall authority, autonomy, and control of the projects. Job enlargements impact on the work environment is not always the most positive due to the fact that it is largely just an increase in work for the employee and not really a step up in responsibility. Job enrichment on the other hand is a very motivational technique in the management world. The act of enriching an employee's job not only is a sign of respect but it also shows that the employer actually cares about the employee as a person. This creates a desire for the employee to want to pay the employer back in the form of hard work, loyalty, and dedication the company.

It provides functions similar to a PBX, but is provisioned with equipment owned by, and located at, the telephone company premises. Centrex service was first installed in the early 1960s in New York's financial district by New York Telephone. As of 2003, it was estimated that there were 20 million Centrex lines installed worldwide by 20 telephone companies, with the most installations in the United States (15 million), Canada (2 million), and The United Kingdom (1 million). This accounted for approximately 5% of all installed business telephone lines, worldwide. In terms of user-visible features, Centrex and PBX are similar. Features include: * Direct inward dialing (DID) * Automatic routing of calls to obtain lowest cost * Call pick- up groups * Call forwarding * Conference calling * Automatic call distribution (ACD) * Call detail recording Phasing out In the United States, the usage of Centrex lines has fallen from 16.5 million in 2002 to 10.7 million in 2008 as users transition to IP-PBX (through VoIP). Centrex continues to be used by large institutions, government agencies, and universities as most of the equipment has already been paid for, though leasing Centrex lines may be more expensive.

The medal recognized those soldiers who had enlisted in the United States Army for the purpose of the serving in the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War. Criteria The four primary criteria, to be awarded the Philippine Congressional Medal, were as follows: * Enlisted between 21 April and 26 October 1898 * Served beyond 11 April 1899 * Served in the Philippines after 6 July 1899 * Received an honorable discharge (or died prior to being discharged) The medal was different from the Philippine Campaign Medal in that the Philippine Campaign Medal recognized general service in the Philippines while the Philippine Congressional Medal was intended for special services rendered. The Philippine Congressional Medal was considered an authorized military decoration, but soon became regarded as a commemorative medal since it recognized a single event and also was not eligible for presentation to the United States Navy and Marine Corps. Appearance The Philippine Congressional Medal is 1 1/4 inches in diameter made of bronze with an oxidized and relieved finish. The obverse of the medal depicts a color guard of one flag bearer accompanied by two soldiers bearing rifles, marching toward the left of the medal. Around the edge of the medal are the words PHILIPPINE INSURRECTION. In the exergue is the date 1899. The reverse bears the inscription FOR PATRIOTISM FORTITUDE AND LOYALTY surrounded by a wreath of pine branches on the left and palms on the right, tied at the bottom with a bow. The suspension and service ribbons are ultramarine blue with edge stripes of red and white. The outside white stripes are 1/16 of an inch from the edge and 1/16 inches wide.

He is best known for discovering the Crab Nebula in 1731. Bevis has also observed an occultation by Venus of Mercury on 28 May 1737 NS, (17 May 1737 OS) and observed and found a prediction rule for eclipses of Jupiter's moons. From observations made with his telescope at Stoke Newington, Middlesex, he compiled a star catalogue (more of an atlas) entitled Uranographia Britannica around 1750. In 1757 Bevis published in London a volume on The History and Philosophy of Earthquakes in which he collected accounts of the Lisbon earthquake from diverse authentic sources. His survey, the first of its kind, was subsequently used by John Michell (1761). In 1757 Bevis was asked by the tobacconist Thomas Hughes to discover why no flowers would grow in his garden at Bagnigge House, which stood in the vicinity of 61-63 King's Cross Road, London. He found the water from the well on the site to be full of iron. On this research, a second well was dug, the water from which was found to be a good purgative. This led to the establishment of one of the most popular 18th Century spas, Bagnigge Wells, the following year.The London Encyclopaedia p.32 A watercolour of Bagnigge Wells by Samuel Hieronymus Grimm He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in November, 1765.

Electrical research When the Leyden Jar first arrived in the UK (1746), Bevis worked with William Watson in refining it. They removed the water and replaced it with lead shot, then later lined the inside and exterior of the glass with lead. They also experimented to determine the speed of electricity using nearly four kilometers of wire and observing the spark made on entering the wire, and that made on leaving it: they could not detect any time delay and concluded it must be almost instantaneous. Watson and Bevis corresponded extensively with Benjamin Franklin and his group of Philadelphia experimenters and they jointly: * refined the Leyden jar by coating the inside and outside with tin foil * joined Leyden Jars together to create a \\"battery\\" * distinguished between the charge in Leyden Jars linked in series from those linked in parallel * created a flat glass-plate and tin-foil version of the Jar battery (the first flat- plate condensor) * developed the single-fluid theory of electricity which emphasised a superabundance of the fluid on one side, and a deficit on the other. * introduced the concept of positive and negative charges.

The first was a UXD5-Glenkindie Scotland 1979. History =Development= System X was developed by the Post Office (later to become British Telecom), GEC, Plessey, and Standard Telephones and Cables (STC) and first shown in public in 1979 at the Telecom 79 exhibition in Geneva Switzerland. In 1982, STC withdrew from System X and, in 1988, the telecommunications divisions of GEC & Plessey merged to form GPT, with Plessey subsequently being bought out by GEC & Siemens. In the late 1990s, GEC acquired Siemens' 40% stake in GPT and, in 1999, the parent company of GPT, GEC, renamed itself Marconi. When Marconi was sold to Ericsson in January 2006, Telent plc retained System X and continues to support and develop it as part of its UK services business. =Implementation= The first System X unit to enter public service was in September 1980 and was installed in Baynard House, London and was a 'tandem junction unit' which switched telephone calls amongst ~40 local exchanges. The first local digital exchange started operation in 1981 in Woodbridge, Suffolk (near BT's Research HQ at Martlesham Heath). The last electromechanical trunk exchange (in Thurso, Scotland) was closed in July 1990‚Äîcompleting the UK's trunk network transition to purely digital operation and becoming the first national telephone system to achieve this. The last electromechanical local exchanges, Crawford, Crawfordjohn and Elvanfoot, all in Scotland, were changed over to digital on 23 June 1995 and the last electronic analogue exchanges, Selby, Yorkshire and Leigh on Sea, Essex were changed to digital on 11 March 1998. In addition to the UK, System X was installed in the Channel Islands and several systems were installed in other countries, although it never achieved a significant export market. In recent years [ambiguous] BT have started a programme of rationalisation of their System X estate to retire exchange cores (processors & switches) and re- parent concentrators onto other exchanges. Newer types of exchanges known as \\"Super DLEs\\" are being implemented as part of this process. These switches are in fact disused Mark 2 trunk switches (DMSUs) that have been converted to host concentrators, and are being used to offload the older and more costly Mark 1 switches. SystemX software is being modified by Telent to cater for the high numbers of concentrators being hosted on exchanges now. System X units System X covers three main types of telephone switching equipment. Many of these switches reside all over the United Kingdom. Concentrators are usually kept in local telephone exchanges but can be housed remotely in less populated areas. DLEs and DMSUs operate in major towns and cities and provide call routing functions. The BT network architecture designated exchanges as DLEs / DMSUs / DJSUs etc. but other operators configured their exchanges differently depending on their network architecture. With the focus of the design being on reliability, the general architectural principle of System X hardware is that all core functionality is duplicated across 2 'sides' (side 0 & side 1). Either side of a functional resource can be the 'worker' with the other being an in-service 'standby'. Resources continually monitor themselves and should a fault be detected the associated resource will mark itself as 'faulty' and the other side will take the load instantaneously. This resilient configuration allows for hardware changes to fix faults or perform upgrades to be performed without interruption to service. Some critical hardware such as switchplanes and waveform generators are triplicated and work on an 'any 2 out of 3' basis. The CPUs in an R2PU processing cluster are quadruplicated to retain 75% performance capability with one out of service instead of 50% if they were simply duplicated. Line cards providing customer line ports or the 2Mbps E1 terminations on the switch have no 'second side' redundancy, but of course a customer can have multiple lines or an interconnect have multiple E1s to provide resilience. =Concentrator unit= The concentrator unit consists of four main sub-systems: line modules, digital concentrator switch, digital line termination (DLT) units and control unit. Its purpose is to convert speech from analogue signals to digital format, and concentrate the traffic for onward transmission to the digital local exchange (DLE). It also receives dialled information from the subscriber and passes this to the exchange processors so that the call can be routed to its destination. In normal circumstances, it does not switch signals between subscriber lines but has limited capacity to do this if the connection to the exchange switch is lost. Each analogue line module unit converts analogue signals from a maximum of 64 subscriber lines in the access network to the 64 kilobit/s digital binary signals used in the core network. This is done by sampling the incoming signal at a rate of 8 kS/s and coding each sample into an 8-bit word using pulse code modulation (PCM) techniques. The line module also strips out any signalling information from the subscriber line, e.g., dialled digits, and passes this to the control unit. Up to 32 line modules are connected to a digital concentrator switch unit using 2 Mbit/s paths, giving each concentrator a capacity of up to 2048 subscriber lines. The digital concentrator switch multiplexes the signals from the line modules using time-division multiplexing and concentrates the signals onto up to 480 time slots on E1s up to the exchange switch via the digital line termination units. The other two time slots on each channel are used for synchronisation and signalling. These are timeslots 0 and 16 respectively. Depending on hardware used, concentrators support the following line types: analogue lines (either single or multiple line groups), ISDN2 (basic rate ISDN) & ISDN30 (primary rate ISDN). ISDN can run either UK-specific DASS2 or ETSI(euro) protocols. Subject to certain restrictions a concentrator can run any mix of line types, this allows operators to balance business ISDN users with residential users to give a better service to both and efficiency for the operator. Concentrator units can either stand alone as remote concentrators or be co-located with the exchange core (switch & processors). =Digital local exchange= The Digital Local Exchange (DLE) hosts a number of concentrators and routes calls to different DLEs or DMSUs depending on the destination of the call. The heart of the DLE is the Digital Switching Subsystem (DSS) which consists of Time Switches and a Space Switch. Incoming traffic on the 30 channel PCM highways from the Concentrator Units is connected to Time Switches. The purpose of these is to take any incoming individual Time Slot and connect it to an outgoing Time Slot and so perform a switching and routing function. To allow access to a large range of outgoing routes, individual Time Switches are connected to each other by a Space Switch. The Time Slot inter-connections are held in Switch Maps which are updated by Software running on the Processor Utility Subsystem (PUS). The nature of the Time Switch-Space Switch architecture is such that the system is very unlikely to be affected by a faulty time or space switch, unless many faults are present. The switch is a 'non-blocking' switch. =Digital main switching unit= The Digital Main Switching Unit (DMSU) deals with calls that have been routed by DLEs or another DMSU and is a 'trunk / transit switch', i.e. it does not host any concentrators. As with DLEs, DMSUs are made up of a Digital Switching Subsystem and a Processor Utility Subsystem, amongst other things. In the British PSTN network, each DMSU is connected to every other DMSU in the country, enabling almost congestion-proof connectivity for calls through the network. In inner London, specialised versions of the DMSU exist and are known as DJSU's - they are practically identical in terms of hardware - both being fully equipped switches, the DJSU has the distinction of carrying inter-London traffic only. The DMSU network in London has been gradually phased out and moved onto more modern \\"NGS\\" switches over the years as the demand for PSTN phone lines has decreased as BT has sought to reclaim some of its floor-space. The NGS switch referred to is a version of Ericsson's AXE10 product line, phased in between the late '90s and early '00s. It is common to find multiple exchanges (switches) within the same exchange building in large UK cities - DLEs for the directly-connected customers and a DMSU to provide the links to the rest of the UK. =Processor utility subsystem= The Processor Utility Subsystem (PUS) controls the switching operations and is the brain of the DLE or DMSU. It hosts the Call Processing, Billing, Switching and Maintenance applications Software (amongst other software subsystems). The PUS is divided into up to eight 'clusters' depending on the amount of telephony traffic dealt with by the exchange. Each of the first four clusters of processors contains four central processing units (CPUs), the main memory stores (STRs) and the two types of backing store (primary (RAM) and secondary (hard disk)) memory. The PUS was coded with a version of the CORAL66 programming language known as PO CORAL (Post Office CORAL) later known as BTCORAL. The original processor that went into service at Baynard house, London, was known as the MK2 BL processor. It was replaced in 1980 by the POPUS1 (Post Office Processor Utility Subsystem). POPUS1 processors were later installed in Lancaster House in Liverpool and also, in Cambridge. Later, these too were replaced with a much smaller system known as R2PU or Release 2 Processor Utility. This was the four CPU per cluster and up to 8-cluster system, as described above. Over time, as the system was developed, additional \\"CCP / Performance 3\\" clusters were added (clusters 5, 6, 7 and 8) using more modern hardware, akin to late-1990s computer technology, while the original processing clusters 0 to 3 were upgraded with, for example, larger stores (more RAM). There were many very advanced features with this fault-tolerant system which helps explain why these are still in use today ‚Äì like self fault detection and recovery, battery-backed RAM, mirrored disk storage, auto replacement of a failed memory unit, the ability to trial new software (and roll back, if necessary) to the previous version. In recent times, the hard disks on the CCP clusters have been replaced by with solid- state drives to improve reliability. In modern times, all System X switches show a maximum of 12 processing clusters; 0‚Äì3 are the four-CPU System X-based clusters and the remaining eight positions can be filled with CCP clusters which deal with all traffic handling. Whilst the status quo for a large System X switch is to have four main and four CCP clusters, there are one or two switches that have four main and six CCP clusters. The CCP clusters are limited to call handling only, there was the potential for the exchange software to be re-written to accept the CCP clusters, but this was scrapped as being too costly of a solution to replace a system that was already working well. Should a CCP cluster fail, System X will automatically re-allocate its share of the call handling to another CCP cluster, if no CCP clusters are available then the exchange's main clusters will begin to take over the work of call handling as well as running the exchange. In terms of structure, the System X processor is a \\"one master, many slaves\\" configuration ‚Äì cluster 0 is referred to as the base cluster and all other clusters are effectively dependent to it. If a slave cluster is lost, then call handling for any routes or concentrators dependent to it is also lost; however, if the base cluster is lost then the entire exchange ceases to function. This is a very rare occurrence, as due to the design of System X it will isolate problematic hardware and raise a fault report. During normal operation, the highest level of disruption is likely to be a base cluster restart, all exchange functions are lost for 2‚Äì5 minutes while the base cluster and its slaves come back online, but afterwards the exchange will continue to function with the defective hardware isolated. During normal operation, the exchange's processing clusters will sit between 5-15% usage, with the exception of the base cluster which will usually sit between 15-25% usage, spiking as high as 45% - this is due to the base cluster handling far more operations and processes than any other cluster on the switch. =Editions of System X= System X has gone through two major editions, Mark 1 and Mark 2. This refers to the switch matrix used. The Mark 1 Digital Subscriber Switch (DSS) was the first to be introduced. It is a time-space-time switch setup with a theoretical maximum matrix of 96x96 Time Switches. In practice, the maximum size of switch is a 64x64 Time Switch matrix. Each time switch is duplicated into two security planes, 0 and 1. This allows for error checking between the planes and multiple routing options if faults are found. Every timeswitch on a single plane can be out of service and full function of the switch can be maintained, however, if one timeswitch on plane 0 is out, and another on plane 1 is out, then links between the two are lost. Similarly, if a timeswitch has both plane 0 and 1 out, then the timeswitch is isolated. Each plane of the timeswitch occupies one shelf in a three-shelf group ‚Äì the lower shelf is plane 0, the upper shelf is plane 1 and the middle shelf is occupied by up to 32 DLTs (Digital Line Terminations). The DLT is a 2048 kb/s 32-channel PCM link in and out of the exchange. The space switch is a more complicated entity, but is given a name ranging from AA to CC (or BB within general use), a plane of 0 or 1 and, due to the way it is laid out, an even or odd segment, designated by another 0 and 1. The name of a space switch in software, then, can look like this. SSW H'BA-0-1. The space switch is the entity that provides the logical cross connection of traffic across the switch, and the time switches are dependent to it. When working on a space switch it is imperative to make sure the rest of the switch is healthy as, due to its layout, powering off either the odd or even segment of a space switch will \\"kill\\" all of its dependent time switches for that plane. Mark 1 DSS is controlled by a triplicated set of Connection Control Units (CCU's) which run in a 2/3 majority for error checking, and is monitored constantly by a duplicated Alarm Monitoring Unit (AMU) which reports faults back to the DSS Handler process for appropriate action to be taken. The CCU and AMU also play part in diagnostic testing of Mark 1 DSS. A Mark 1 System X unit is a vast construct with suites of 8 racks in length, and it can be over 15 suites from end to end. This is far from ideal, as each of those suites needs to be powered and costs quickly add up. Further to that is the consideration that all the powered equipment generates heat, which will require more power costs to remove from a room ‚Äì these are the two main reasons that Mark 1 exchanges are being closed down in favour of Mark 2. Mark 2 DSS (\\"DSS2\\") is the later revision, which continues to use the same processor system as Mark 1, but made serious and much needed revisions to both the physical size of the switch and the way that the switch functions. It is an optical fibre-based time-space-time-space-time switching matrix, connecting a maximum of 2048 2Mbps PCM systems, much like Mark 1; however the hardware is much more compact. The four-rack group of the Mk1 CCU and AMU is gone, and replaced neatly by a single connection control rack, comprising the Outer Switch Modules (OSMs), Central Switch Modules (CSMs) and the relevant switch/processor interface hardware. The Timeswitch shelves are replaced with Digital Line Terminator Group (DLTG) shelves, which each contain two DLTGs, comprising 16 Double Digital Line Termination boards (DDLTs) and two Line Communication Multiplexors (LCMs), one for each security plane. The LCMs are connected by optical fibre over a forty megabit link to the OSMs. In total, there are 64 DLTG's in a fully sized Mk2 DSS unit, which is analogous to the 64 Time Switches of the Mk1 DSS unit. The Mk2 DSS unit is a lot smaller than the Mk1, and as such consumes less power and also generates less heat to be dealt with as a result. It is also possible to interface directly with SDH transmission over fibre at 40Mbps, thus reducing the amount of 2Mbps DDF and SDH tributary usage. Theoretically, a transit switch (DMSU) could purely interface with the SDH over fibre with no DDF at all. Further to this, due to the completely revised switch design and layout, the Mk2 switch manages to be somewhat faster than the Mk1 (although the actual difference is negligible in practice). It is also far more reliable, having many less discrete components in each of its sections means there is much less to go wrong, and when something does go wrong it is usually a matter of replacing the card tied to the software entity that has failed, rather than needing to run diagnostics to determine possible locations for the point of failure as is the case with Mk1 DSS. =Message Transmission Subsystem= A System X exchange's processors communicate with its concentrators and other exchanges using its Message Transmission subsystem (MTS). MTS links are 'nailed up' between nodes by re- purposing individual 64kbps digital speech channels across the switch into permanent paths for the signalling messages to route over. Messaging to and from concentrators is done using proprietary messaging, messaging between exchanges is done using C7 / SS7 messaging. UK-specific and ETSI variant protocols are supported. It was also possible to use channel associated signalling, but as the UK and Europe's exchanges went digital in the same era this was hardly used. Replacement system Many of the system X exchanges installed during the 1980s are over 30 years old and still in use, giving an idea of their good reliability. The system was originally designed for 15 years of service, and as such has long exceeded its expectations but in recent years has started to deteriorate, with the old plastic shelf runners becoming brittle due to heat exposure. Many exchanges have never been turned off in their entire life, and will only have had process restarts for software upgrades every couple of years or so to give in excess of 99.9998% reliability. System X was scheduled for replacement with Next Generation softswitch equipment as part of the BT 21st Century Network (21CN) programme. Some other users of System X ‚Äì in particular Jersey Telecom and Kingston Communications ‚Äì replaced their circuit-switched System X equipment with Marconi XCD5000 softswitches (which are the NGN replacement for System X) and Access Hub multiservice access nodes. However, the omission of Marconi from the BT 21CN supplier list, the lack of a suitable replacement softswitch to match System X reliability, and the shift in focus away from telephony onto broadband all led to much of the System X estate being maintained. It is only recently that other manufacturers have started producing 'exchanges' that offer the customer feature-rich functionality that SystemX offers - for many years the alternatives weren't capable of replicating (let alone exceeding) SystemX's functionality.

Epstein was an active IAF pilot from 1956 until May 26, 1997, when he retired at age 59. Like many retired IAF flyers, he later worked as a pilot for El Al Airlines.  Early career  Epstein joined the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) in 1956 during the Sinai War. He was initially rejected from flight school because of a heart condition and began his military career as a paratrooper. While traveling with the IDF's parachute demonstration team, Epstein changed his last name to Even (\\"stone\\" in Hebrew). He left the IDF in 1959 before returning two years later to again apply for flight school. After gaining medical clearance (mostly through his own stubbornness), Epstein began fighter training. He soon gained the nickname \\"Hawkeye\\" due to his extraordinary eyesight. Epstein was allegedly able to spot aircraft at a distance of 24 miles (44 km) ‚Äî nearly three times further than a normal pilot.  Victories: 1967‚Äì1973  Israeli Air Force Mirage IIICJ Epstein's first kill came on June 6, 1967 during the Six-Day War, when he downed an Egyptian Sukhoi-7 at El Arish. During the War of Attrition in 1969‚Äì70, Epstein downed a MiG-17, another Sukhoi-7 and two MiG 21s. The rest of his kills came during 1973's Yom Kippur War. Between October 18 and 20, 1973, he downed an Mi-8 helicopter and eight jets: two Sukhoi-7s, two Sukhoi-20s and four MiG 21s. Then, on October 24, 1973, Epstein downed three more MiG-21s west of the Great Bitter Lake. Eight of these victories were with the French-built Mirage III, a delta wing fighter designed primarily as a high altitude interceptor. His other nine victories came in an IAI Nesher, an Israeli-built version of the Mirage 5. Five of his kills were downed using air-to-air missiles, the rest with cannon.  Later career and retirement  After the Yom Kippur War, Epstein received the Medal of Distinguished Service, one of Israel's highest military honors. He went on to command Mirage and Kfir squadrons and was flying \\"ready\\" missions in the F-16 up until his 59th birthday. Epstein was a captain for El Al Airlines from 1977 to 1997.

A LUN may be used with any device which supports read/write operations, such as a tape drive, but is most often used to refer to a logical disk as created on a SAN. Though not technically correct, the term \\"LUN\\" is often also used to refer to the logical disk itself. Examples To provide a practical example, a typical multi-disk drive has multiple physical SCSI ports, each with one SCSI target address assigned. An administrator may format the disk array as a RAID and then partition this RAID into several separate storage-volumes. To represent each volume, a SCSI target is configured to provide a logical unit. Each SCSI target may provide multiple logical units and thus represent multiple volumes, but this does not mean that those volumes are concatenated. The computer that accesses a volume on the disk array identifies which volume to read or write with the LUN of the associated logical unit. In another example: a single disk-drive has one physical SCSI port. It usually provides just a single target, which in turn usually provides just a single logical unit whose LUN is zero. This logical unit represents the entire storage of the disk drive. Use How to select a LUN: In the early versions of SCSI, an initiator delivers a Command Descriptor Block (CDB) to a target (physical unit) and within the CDB is a 3-bit LUN field to identify the logical unit within the target. In current SCSI, the initiator delivers the CDB to a particular logical unit, so the LUN appears in the transport layer data structures and not in the CDB. LUN vs. SCSI Device ID: The LUN is not the only way to identify a logical unit. There is also the SCSI Device ID, which identifies a logical unit uniquely in the world. Labels or serial numbers stored in a logical unit's storage volume often serve to identify the logical unit. However, the LUN is the only way for an initiator to address a command to a particular logical unit, so initiators often create, via a discovery process, a mapping table of LUN to other identifiers. Context sensitive: The LUN identifies a logical unit only within the context of a particular initiator. So two computers that access the same disk volume may know it by different LUNs. LUN 0: There is one LUN which is required to exist in every target: zero. The logical unit with LUN zero is special in that it must implement a few specific commands, most notably Report LUNs, which is how an initiator can find out all the other LUNs in the target. But LUN zero need not provide any other services, such as a storage volume. Many SCSI targets contain only one logical unit (so its LUN is necessarily zero). Others have a small number of logical units that correspond to separate physical devices and have fixed LUNs. A large storage system may have up to thousands of logical units, defined logically, by administrative command, and the administrator may choose the LUN or the system may choose it. c_t_d_s_ nomenclature in Unix From the computer perspective, SCSI LUN is only a part of the full SCSI address. The full device's address is made from the: * c-part: controller ID of the host bus adapter, * t-part: target ID identifying the SCSI target on that controller, * d-part: disk ID identifying a LUN on that target, * s-part: slice ID identifying a specific partition on that disk. In the Unix family of operating systems, these IDs are often combined into a single \\"name\\". For example, /dev/dsk/c1t2d3s4 would refer to controller 1, target 2, disk 3, slice 4. Presently Solaris, HP-UX, NCR, and others continue to use \\"c_t_d_s_\\" nomenclature, while AIX has abandoned it in favor of more familiar names. HP- UX refers to this as the Legacy Naming Model since version 11i v3. Other uses The term logical unit number also applies to an input/output access channel within certain programming languages.

Very little is known about Guillaume‚Äôs youth but it is assumed he received his initial training from his father. He had two younger brothers who also became painters Guillaume (Guglielmo Cortese) (1628 - 1679) and Jean- Fran√ßois (c. 1627-?). As his brother was later also known as 'il Borgognone' (a reference to their origins in Burgundy, called Bourgogne in French), some of the works of the brothers have been confused. The father took his sons to Italy around 1636 when they were still young. They first travelled to Milan.Simonetta Prosperi Valentini Rodin√≤, Courtois, Guillaume, in: Treccani, accessed 7 February 2017 According to contemporary biographers he served for three years in the Spanish army. During this time he drew marches and battles, fight scenes, landscapes and military costumes. He then abandoned the weapons and studied for some time in Milan with an unidentified sculptor. He moved to Bologna in 1639 where he first entered the studio of J√©r√¥me Colom√®s, a painter from Lorraine. According to early Italian biographer Filippo Baldinucci Courtois' talent got noticed in Bologna by prominent painters Guido Reni and Francesco Albani. He continued his apprenticeship in Siena, where he studied for some time at the school of Astolfo Petrazzi.Simonetta Prosperi Valentini Rodin√≤, Jacques Courtois, in: Treccani, accessed 7 February 2017 Battle between European troops It is possible that the brothers Guillaume and Jacques remained together until the later 1640s.Guillaume Courtois (Guglielmo Cortese) (St Hippolyte, Franche-Comt√© 1628 ‚Äì 1679 Rome), Figures Dancing at Foolscap Fine Art He stayed for a short time in Florence where he met two Northern painters Jan Asselijn, a battle painter, and Matthieu van Plattenberg (known as ' Mons√π Montagna'), a marine artist. He went to Rome around 1639-1640 where he initially was permitted to live in the monastery of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme in Milan through the intercession of the abbot Don Ilarione Rancati. The abbot also was instrumental in securing Courtois' first official commissions, a large fresco of the miracle of the loaves and fishes in the refectory of the monastery (1641). In Rome he also became friends with Pieter van Laer, a Dutch genre painter active in Rome where he was known by the nickname 'Bamboccio'. Pieter van Laer was known for his genre scenes, animal paintings and landscapes, which included anecdotal scenes placed in the environs of Rome.Pieter van Laer at the Netherlands Institute for Art History The style of genre painting practiced by Pieter van Laer was followed by other Northern and Italian painters. These followers became known as the Bamboccianti and a painting in this style as a Bambocciata (plural: Bambocciate).David A. Levine. \\"Laer, Pieter van.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 26 June 2016 Michelangelo Cerquozzi, the leading battle painter in Italy in the first decades of the 17th century who also painted genre paintings in the style of the Bamboccianti, recognized Courtois' talent and encouraged him to paint battle scenes. Marauders attacking a group of travellers During the early and mid-1640s he started to attract the patronage of prominent noble Roman families, among them the Sacchetti, Chigi Family and Pamphili. It was Pietro da Cortona who had introduced him to these noble families. He also worked for patrons outside Rome and abroad in Spain and Italy. In 1647 Jacques Courtois married in Rome Anna Maria Vaiani, a daughter of the Florentine painter Alessandro Vaiani, and a painter and engraver in her own right. His wife was already in her forties when she got married. The marriage was not successful and the couple soon separated for unknown reasons. When Courtois left Rome for Siena she did not follow him.M. Guerrieri Borsoi, Novit√† su Alessandro e Anna Maria Vaiani, in ‚ÄúBollettino Monumenti, Musei e Gallerie Pontificie‚Äù, XXVII (2009), pp. 241-264 Courtois was called to enter the service of Prince Mattias de' Medici, the then governor of Siena and brother of Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. The Prince unsuccessfully tried to reconcile the spouses. The couple did not reunite when Courtois returned to Rome later that year. Rocky valley After the death of his wife in 1654, Jacques Courtois returned for a short time to France. He had to deal with the family property and provide dowries for two of his sisters who were Ursuline nuns in Fribourg, Switzerland. He also made some religious pictures for their convent. He spent time in Bergamo, as is documented by the altarpiece with Madonna and Saints in the parish church of Villa d'Adda, signed and dated 1656. In Bergamo, the artist got to know Count Carlo Giacomo Vecchi, the still-life painter Evaristo Baschenis and art dealer Alberto Vanghetti, for whom he painted numerous paintings and with whom he remained in correspondence until 1657. He then travelled to Venice at the invitation of Nicol√≤ Sagredo, who had been Venice's ambassador to Rome, having already met his brother Guillaume in Rome. Sagredo commissioned Courtois to paint two lunettes above the side doors in the church of St. Mark as well as sacred stories in the gallery. After the Battle Passing through Padua and Bologna, Courtois returned to Florence in 1656 to work in the service of Prince Mattias de' Medici, who took him back to Siena. In 1657 he returned to Rome where he joined the Jesuit order. After becoming a Jesuit he painted a number of religious compositions but later also returned to his favorite theme of warfare. He started signing his drawings in ink with a cross.Pierre Rosenberg, France in the Golden Age: Seventeenth-century French Paintings in American Collections, R√©union des mus√©es nationaux (France), Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.), Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1982, p. 241-242 In 1668 he became a priest. He obtained commissions for frescoes in the Church of the Ges√π, the mother church of the Jesuits in Rome. He was still at work on this project when he died in Rome on 14 November 1676. Work =General= Jacques Courtois is predominantly known for his battle scenes, although he also painted religious scenes as well as idyllic landscapes. In his religious commissions he showed his familiarity with the work of Pietro da Cortona with whom he and his brother had worked. He is also known for a few portraits including one of his patron Prince Mattias de' Medici and a self- portrait.Ritratto del principe Mattias de Medici at Museo dell'Abbazia di Monte Oliveto Maggiore in Asciano =War art= Battle scene with infantry, cavalry and cannon, a fortress and a city beyond Courtois painted imaginary as well historical battles drawn from various episodes of the Thirty Years' War. Draw from his own firsthand experience of wartime facts and techniques, he succeeded in giving his visual representations the impression of 'truthfulness'. Regarded as one of the great battle painters of the 17th century, he was referred to as the 'Raphael of battles' and the 'Prince Eugene of painters'.Marco Chiarini, The Thirty Years' War and its Influence on Battle Painting in Italy in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries at the Westf√§lisches Landesmuseum f√ºr Kunst und Kulturgeschichte Prince Eugene was one of the most successful military commanders in modern European history. His paintings of battles were so popular that no large or small collection of his time was without a work by his hand. Courtois succeeded in creating for viewers the impression that they were actually in the thick of the battle. In Courtois' time people took great pride in the military successes of their armies. Battle paintings were, however, not only intended to celebrate national military victories. They also aimed to allow the viewer to witness the whole range of drama played out in a battle, from the brilliance of individual maneuvres and actions to the bloody consequences to the participants. Courtois relied on all his dramatic skills and compositional devices to create exciting scenes. An example of these skills can be seen in the Battle scene with infantry, cavalry and cannon, a fortress and a city beyond (At Christie's on 7 July 2009 in London, lot 27). In this composition Jacques Courtois has created dramatic tension by placing the key dramatic event - the hand to hand combat and tumbling of some soldiers - in the foreground in the left corner. The viewer is thus brought closer to the picture plane and the action developing in the background. The confusion of battle is expressed through the whirlwind of men and horses, which occupy a limited, closed space. The sharply receding cloudscape adds a sense of nobility to the dramatic action depicted below.Jacques Courtois, Battle scene with infantry, cavalry and cannon, a fortress and a city beyond at Christie's Jacques Courtois was known for working alla prima starting from rapid pen sketches. This approach to painting echoed the dynamism of his battle scenes that established his fame. Infantry on the march The predominant influence on his work was the work of his master Michelangelo Cerquozzi, a painter of battles and genre scenes in the style of the Bamboccianti. Jacques Courtois' battle scenes share with the Bamboccianti an interest in the anecdotal and an attention to detail. This influence became less in his more mature period through the influence of contemporary painter Salvator Rosa whom he had met in Florence, and whose night landscapes, scenes of necromancy, soldiers, battles and genre scenes he admired. The fiery battle scenes of Salvator Rosa possibly left a mark in his more painterly touch and darker colours. =Drawings= Courtois was also a gifted draftsman who showed in his drawings all the freedom and spontaneity of the Baroque.Jacques Courtois at the Prado His sketch-books (London British Museum, and Florence, Gallerie Uffizi) demonstrate his acute ability to capture in quick sketches the movements and the dynamics of troops, while using compositional schemes, which were derived from the work of Jacques Callot. His drawings also show the influence of Stefano Della Bella. Military scenes, etching =Graphic work= In 1647 Courtois was one of the artists who contributed illustrations to the second volume of \\"De Bello Belgico\\", a work by his fellow Jesuit Famiano Strada's. The \\"De Bello Belgico\\" offers a history of the Spanish wars in Flanders in the 16th century. Courtois provided four designs, which represent the siege and capture of four cities during the war. =Influence= The works of Courtois had an important influence on Italian artists, in particular on Francesco Monti (il Brescianino), Francesco Simonini, Ciccio Napoletano and the French artist Joseph Parrocel. The etcher Geronimo Bruni was a pupil of Courtois.

Very little is known about Guillaume‚Äôs youth but it is assumed he received his initial training from his father. The father and his sons went to Italy circa 1636 when Guillaume was still a child. They travelled to Milan, Bologna, Venice, Florence and Siena. The movements of the brothers Courtois are not very well documented, which has led to alternative theories. It is possible Guillaume Courtois settled in Rome by 1638 where he entered the studio of Pietro da Cortona. Here he is supposed to have supplemented his training by drawing from life and copying works of Giovanni Lanfranco and Andrea Sacchi. He studied also the Bolognese painters and Guercino, and formed for himself a classicizing style with very little express mannerism, partly resembling that of Carlo Maratta.Storia pittorica della Italia dal risorgimento delle belle arti, Volume 2, By Luigi Lanzi, page 238 Another view of the movements of the brothers that has gained support with modern scholars is that Guillaume and Jacques remained together until the later 1640sGuillaume Courtois (Guglielmo Cortese) (St Hippolyte, Franche-Comt√© 1628 ‚Äì 1679 Rome), Figures Dancing at Foolscap Fine Art and that Guillaume Courtois only came under the influence of da Cortona when he worked under him in 1656.Ann Sutherland Harris. Cortese. Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 14 Mar. 2015 Guillaume Courtois spent most of his active life in Rome where he died of gout on 14 or 15 June 1679. Jean- Blaise Chardon and Antonio Dupr√© were his pupils. Work =General= David and Goliath Guillaume Courtois was mainly a history painter of Christian religious and mythological scenes.Guglielmo Cortese at the Netherlands Institute for Art History He was also in demand as a staffage painter. He is sometimes referred to as a battle painter because of his involvement in the decorative project in the chapel of the Congregation of the Jesuits, a small oratory housed in a room of the Collegio Romano adjacent to the Sant'Ignazio Church, Rome. This was a collaborative effort of the brothers Guillaume and Jacques. It is now established that Jacques - who was a specialist in battle scenes - painted the battles in the backgrounds. Guillaume painted the scenes that depict victories attributed to the intervention of the Virgin: Heraclius defeats the armies of Chosroes, St. Pulcheria, The Triumph of Emperor Zimisches, The Battle of Louis IX of France, and Julian the Apostate pierced by Saint Mercurius. Early drawings of Guillaume Courtois represent battle scenes and show that he was initially influenced by his brother. He also produced a few portraits and collaborated with other artists on genre paintings. Saints Abdon and Sennen bury the remains of Christian martyrs Courtois‚Äô first major public commissions were frescoes for the San Marco, Rome. Pietro da Cortona recommended the two brothers to Niccol√≤ Sagredo, the Venetian ambassador in Rome who wished to have the church decorated. He painted the Battle of Joshua for the Gallery of Alexander VII in the Quirinal Palace and the Martyrdom of St Andrew for the high altar of the Sant'Andrea al Quirinale. These early works show the influence of Cortona, combined with the influence of the Baroque style of Agostino Carracci through the mediation of the more dynamic version offered by Giovanni Lanfranco‚Äôs work. These influences are reflected in the exuberance in form and color that will remain characteristic of Courtois‚Äô work. The style of Pier Francesco Mola also formed a factor in his development. He also worked alongside Mola, Gaspard Dughet, Francesco Cozza, and Giovanni Battista Tassi on the decoration of the Valmontone Palace of Camillo Francesco Maria Pamphili around 1658-1659.Le vie degli artisti : residenze e botteghe nella Roma barocca dai registri di Sant'Andrea delle Fratte, 1650-1699, by Laura Bartoni, Roma : Edizioni Nuova cultura, (2012), page 424. Some figures painted by Courtois in this Palace were previously attributed to Mola. In 1661, he painted an Assumption for the church of San Tommaso da Villanova in Castelgandolfo in Ozzola.Laura Bartoni, page 412. In his mature work he further showed the influence of Carlo Maratta, an artist who fused the Baroque and Classicist styles. This is reflected in the sweet faces of the female figures in works such as the Madonna of the Rosary for the St. George Church in Monte Porzio Catone made in 1666 on a commission by prince Giovanni Battista Borghese. =Collaborations= Still life of fruits and flowers with a figure In addition to the frequent collaborations with his brother Jacques, a number of collaborations between Guillaume Courtois and Abraham Brueghel, a Flemish still life painter active in Rome, are recorded. An example is the Still life of fruits and flowers with a figure (Sold at Sotheby's on 29 January 2015 in New York, lot 302). The still life was painted by Brueghel while Courtois painted the figure. The painting is a variant of the Grapes and pomegranate with a vase of flowers and a female figure (private collection), which has been dated to the end of the 1660s. Courtois reprised the charming female figure in his Fruit Picker (Gem√§ldegalerie, Dresden), which is a collaboration with Michele Pace del Campidoglio.Still life of fruits and flowers with a figure at Sotheby'sGuillaume Courtois, Michele Pace del Campidoglio, The beautiful female gardener He also collaborated frequently on public works with Bernini, who admired his work and recommended him for commissions, and Carlo Maratta. In 1653 he painted the figures of St. Eustace, the Good Samaritan, a St. Mary of Egypt and St. Augustine in four large landscapes of Gaspard Dughet. This was one of the earliest documented commissions of Courtois and the patron was Camillo Francesco Maria Pamphili. The next year Courtois and Dughet collaborated again for the same patron on works for the Palazzo Pamphilj. =Drawings= Study for a female figure Guillaume Courtois was a very skilled draughtsman as is testified by the many preparatory studies he left behind and which can be found, amongst others, in the Istituto Nazionale per la Grafica. Preparatory drawings are generally in chalk, whereas compositional designs tend to be in pen and ink and wash. The preparatory studies in chalk (Nationalmuseum, Stockholm and the Museum Kunstpalast, D√ºsseldorf) for The Martyrdom of St Mark fresco in San Marco are very skillful and demonstrate a fluid technique and a firm grasp of form and chiaroscuro.

British Isles Reconstructed Woodhenge, facing northwards Timber circles in the British Isles date to the late Neolithic and early Bronze Age. The posts themselves have long since disappeared and the sites are identified from the circles of postholes that they stood in. Aerial photography and geophysical survey have led to the discovery of increasing numbers of the features. Often a postpipe survives in the posthole fill aiding diagnosis. They are usually more than , and up to , in diameter and the posts that constituted them were generally more than wide. Technically, they always consist of at least two concentric circles or ovals of timbers although there are variations on the rule such as the monuments of Seahenge and Arminghall, both in East Anglia which are often described as being timber circles. Wider gaps between the posts are thought to have served as entrance routes. The builders replaced the posts as they decomposed and in some cases stone circles were adopted instead during later phases. They appear either alone or in the context of other monuments, namely henges, such as that at Woodhenge and henge enclosures such as those at Durrington Walls. The only excavated examples of timber circles that stood alone from other features are Seahenge and Arminghall in Norfolk and the early phases of The Sanctuary in Wiltshire. They probably served ritual purposes. Animal bone and domestic waste found at many timber circle sites implies some form of temporary habitation and seasonal feasting. They were built on high ground and would have been very conspicuous. Isolated burials have been found at some sites but not enough to suggest a strong funerary purpose. United States Secotans dancing in a timber circle in North Carolina, watercolor painted by John White in 1585 Timber circles have a long history among Native American societies; their use stretches back for thousands of years and continues into the present day. From the 3400 year old Archaic period Poverty Point site in Louisiana to 2000 year old Hopewell tradition circles found in Ohio to the Sun Dance performed in wooden pole \\"corrals\\" by the Dhegihan-Siouan and Caddoan speaking peoples of the Great Plains. An early example of a timber circle witnessed by Europeans was recorded by watercolor artist John White in July 1585 when he visited the Algonquian village of Secotan in North Carolina. White was the artist-illustrator and mapmaker for the Roanoke Colony expedition sent by Sir Walter Raleigh to begin the first attempts at British colonization of the Americas. White's works represent the sole-surviving visual record of the native inhabitants of the Americas as encountered by England's first colonizers on the Atlantic seaboard. Whites watercolor and the writings of the chronicler who accompanied him, Thomas Harriot, describes a great religious festival, possibly the Green Corn ceremony, with participants holding a ceremonial dance at a timber circle. The posts of the circle were carved with faces. Harriot noted that many of the participants had come from surrounding villages and that \\"every man attyred in the most strange fashion they can devise havinge certayne marks on the backs to declare of what place they bee.\\" and that \\"Three of the fayrest Virgins\\" danced around a central post at the center of the timber circle. =Poverty Point= Concrete markers in the plaza area at Poverty Point The oldest known timber circles in North American archaeology were found at Poverty Point in 2009 by archaeologists from the University of Louisiana at Monroe and Mississippi State University, led by Poverty Point station archaeologist Dr. Diana Greenlee. They discovered evidence in the plaza area for multiple wooden post circular structures ranging from to in diameter; built during the earliest habitation of the site circa 2400 BCE. The site now has a ring of concrete posts marking the position of one of the circles. =Hopewell timber circles= Other examples have been found at Hopewell culture sites in Ohio. Moorehead Circle was constructed about two millennia ago at the Fort Ancient Earthworks. It was discovered in 2005 by Jarrod Burks during magnetic surveys at the large hilltop enclosure near Lebanon, Ohio. The site consists of three concentric circles; with the outer circle being about in diameter. Robert Riordan, Professor of Archaeology at Wright State University and lead archaeologist investigating the site, estimates that about two hundred wooden to tall posts were set in the outer circle. According to radiocarbon dates performed on charcoal found at the site, it was built between 40 BCE and 130 CE, with other charcoal fragments from burnt posts dating to 250 to 420 CE, suggesting the circle was in use for several centuries. In September 2005 archaeologist Frank Cowan conducted excavations at the smaller circular enclosure at the Stubbs Earthworks in Warren County, Ohio; discovering a timber circle in diameter and composed of 172 large posts. Carbon dating of charcoal found in post molds at the site have dated the structure to 200-300 CE. =Cahokia = Artist's conception of Woodhenge III at sunrise circa 1000 CE Solstice and equinox markers at the Md 72 woodhenge, with the hypothesized full circle of posts The existence of the series of woodhenges at Cahokia was discovered during salvage archaeology undertaken by Dr. Warren Wittry in the early 1960s in preparation for a proposed highway interchange. Although the majority of the site contained village house features; a number of unusually shaped large post holes were also discovered. They formed a series of arcs of evenly spaced posts. Wittry hypothesized that the arcs could be whole circles and that the site was possibly a calendar for tracking solar events such as solstice and equinoxes. He began referring to the circles as \\"woodhenges\\"; comparing the structures to ones found in England. Additional excavations found evidence for five timber circles in the general vicinity, now designated Woodhenges I through V in Roman numerals. Each was a different diameter and had a different number of posts. Because four of the circles overlap each other it is thought they were built in a sequence, with each iteration generally being larger and containing 12 more posts than its predecessor. A full sequence for what has become known as Woodhenge III was found (except for nine posts on the western edge that had been lost to dump trucks for road construction fill) and a reconstruction of the circle was built in 1985; with the posts being placed into the original excavated post positions. The Illinois State Park system oversees the Cahokia site and hosts public sunrise observations at the vernal and autumnal equinoxes and the winter and summer solstices. Out of respect for Native American beliefs these events do not feature ceremonies or rituals of any kind. Archaeologist Marvin Fowler has speculated that the woodhenges also served as ‚Äúaligners‚Äù and that there may have been as many as 3 more in other strategic locations around the city of Cahokia, built to triangulate and lay out construction projects. At least one other possible circle at Cahokia has been put forward by Fowler, but his suggestion has not yet gained full acceptance by other archaeologists. This location was discovered near Mounds 72 and 96, directly to the south of Monks Mound. Several post holes of what may have been a ceremonial area with a in diameter circle and 48 posts. Archaeologists have dated the placement of at least one of the posts to approximately 950 CE. Archaeological research has shown that four of the posts were at the cardinal locations of north, south, east and west, with eastern and western posts marking the position of the equinox sunrise and sunsets. Four other posts in the circle were shown to be at the summer solstice sunrise and sunset and the winter solstice sunrise and sunset positions. This setup is nearly identical to the diameter and post positions of Woodhenge III, differing only in that Woodhenge III was smaller in diameter. The placement of the two mounds at the location and the directions in which they are oriented correspond to several of the solstice marking posts. The post nearest the later elite burial of the \\"Birdman\\" is the location that marked the summer solstice sunrise at the times of the sites use. The early stages of the mounds were actually constructed around the posts, although at a later point the posts were removed.

FC switches implement zoning, a mechanism that disables unwanted traffic between certain fabric nodes. Fibre Channel switches may be deployed one at a time or in larger multi-switch configurations. SAN administrators typically add new switches as their server and storage needs grow, connecting switches together via fiber optic cable using the standard device ports.

Magdalen Greek 17 (Gregory-Aland \\\\mathfrak{P}64) and whence they have their name. When the fragments were finally published by Colin H. Roberts in 1953, illustrated with a photograph, the hand was characterized as \\"an early predecessor of the so- called 'Biblical Uncial'\\" which began to emerge towards the end of the 2nd century. The uncial style is epitomised by the later biblical Codex Vaticanus and Codex Sinaiticus. Comparative paleographical analysis has remained the methodological key for dating the manuscript, but there is no consensus on the dating of the papyrus. Estimates have ranged from the first century to the fourth century AD. The fragments are written on both sides, indicating they came from a codex rather than a scroll. More fragments, published in 1956 by Ramon Roca-Puig, cataloged as P. Barc. Inv. 1 (Gregory-Aland \\\\mathfrak{P}67), were determined by Roca-Puig and Roberts to come from the same codex as the Magdalen fragments, a view which has remained the scholarly consensus.  Date  \\\\mathfrak{P}64 was originally given a 3rd-century date by Charles Huleatt, who donated the Manuscript to Magdalen College. Papyrologist A. S. Hunt then studied the manuscript and dated it to the early 4th century. After initially preferring a third or possibly fourth century dating for the papyrus, Colin Roberts published the manuscript and gave it a dating of ca. 200, which was confirmed by three other leading papyrologists: Harold Bell, T. C. Skeat and E. G. Turner.Colin Roberts, An Early Papyrus pp. 233‚Äì237; Nongbri, God's Library 265-267 In late 1994, Carsten Peter Thiede proposed redating the Magdalen papyrus to the middle of the 1st century (AD 37 to 70). This attracted considerable publicity, as journalists interpreted the claim optimistically. Thiede's official article appeared in Zeitschrift f√ºr Papyrologie und Epigraphik in 1995. A version edited for the layman was co- written with Matthew d'Ancona and presented as The Jesus Papyrus, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, London, 1996. (also published as: Eyewitness to Jesus, 1996, New York: Doubleday). Thiede‚Äôs redating of the papyrus was based on comparative analysis of the script with selected samples from Egypt and Palestine. He claimed to see similarities between the script of the Magdalen papyrus and that of dated documents from the first century CE, such as P.Oxy. II 246 (66 CE). Thiede's hypothesis has been viewed with skepticism by nearly all established papyrologists and biblical scholars.See Head, Peter M. \\"The Date of the Magdalen Papyrus of Matthew (P. Magd.

An ad valorem tax may also be imposed annually, as in the case of a real or personal property tax, or in connection with another significant event (e.g. inheritance tax, expatriation tax, or tariff). In some countries a stamp duty is imposed as an ad valorem tax. Sales tax A sales tax is a consumption tax charged at the point of purchase for certain goods and services. The tax is usually set as a percentage by the government charging the tax. There is usually a list of exemptions. The tax can be included in the price (tax-inclusive) or added at the point of sale (tax-exclusive). Ideally, a sales tax is fair, has a high compliance rate, is difficult to avoid, is charged every time an item is sold retail, and is simple to calculate and simple to collect. A conventional or retail sales tax attempts to achieve this by charging the tax only on the final end user, unlike a gross receipts tax levied on the intermediate business which purchases materials for production or ordinary operating expenses prior to delivering a service or product to the marketplace. This prevents so-called tax \\"cascading\\" or \\"pyramiding,\\" in which an item is taxed more than once as it makes its way from production to final retail sale. There are several types of sales taxes: seller or vendor taxes, consumer excise taxes, retail transaction taxes, or value-added taxes. Value-added tax A value-added tax (VAT), or goods and services tax (GST), is a tax on exchanges. It is levied on the added value that results from each exchange. It differs from a sales tax because a sales tax is levied on the total value of the exchange. For this reason, a VAT is neutral with respect to the number of passages that there are between the producer and the final consumer. A VAT is an indirect tax, in that the tax is collected from someone other than the person who actually bears the cost of the tax (namely the seller rather than the consumer). To avoid double taxation on final consumption, exports (which by definition are consumed abroad) are usually not subject to VAT and VAT charged under such circumstances is usually refundable. =History= Maurice Laur√©, joint director of the French tax authority, the Direction g√©n√©rale des imp√¥ts, as taxe sur la valeur ajout√©e (TVA in French), was first to introduce VAT with effect from 10 April 1954 for large businesses, and extended over time to all business sectors. In France, it is the most important source of state finance, accounting for approximately 45% of state revenues. Property tax A property tax, millage tax is an ad valorem tax that an owner of real estate or other property pays on the value of the property being taxed. There are three species or types of property: Land, Improvements to Land (immovable man made things), and Personal (movable man made things). Real estate, real property or realty are all terms for the combination of land and improvements. The taxing authority requires and/or performs an appraisal of the monetary value of the property, and tax is assessed in proportion to that value. Forms of property tax used vary between countries and jurisdictions. Application of a sales or property tax =United States= Ad valorem duties are important to those importing goods into the United States because the amount of duty owed is often based on the value of the imported commodity. Ad valorem taxes (mainly real property tax and sales taxes) are a major source of revenues for state and municipal governments, especially in jurisdictions that do not employ a personal income tax. Virtually all state and local sales taxes in the United States are ad valorem. \\"Ad valorem\\" is used most frequently to refer to the value placed on property by the county tax assessors. An assessment is made against this value by applying an assessment rate (e.g. 100%, 60%, 40%, etc.). The net assessment is determined after subtracting any exemptions to which the property owner is entitled (e.g. homestead exemptions), and a tax or millage rate is applied to this net assessment to determine the ad valorem tax due from the property owner. The two main basis for determining the ad valorem value are fair market value and current use value. The fair market value is based on the typical selling price for property on which the buyer and seller can agree, with the assumption that the property is being used or will be used at its highest and best use after the sale. The current use value is the typical selling price for property with an assumption that it will continue after the sale to be used in its current use rather than being converted to its highest and best use. State legislatures have created many variations to these two main valuation approaches. In some states, a central appraisal authority establishes values on all properties and distributes these to the local county or jurisdiction taxing authority, which then sets a tax rate and imposes the local ad valorem tax. In other states, a central appraisal authority values certain properties that are difficult to value at the local level (e.g. railroads, electric companies and other utility companies) and sends these values to the local county or jurisdiction taxing authority, while the local tax assessors determine the value on all other property in the county or jurisdiction. \\"Ad valorem\\" tax, most frequently referred to as property tax, relates to the tax that results when the net assessed value of a property is multiplied times the millage rate applicable to that property. This millage rate is usually expressed as a multiple of 1/1000 of a dollar. Thus the fractional amount of 0.001 will be expressed as 1 mill when expressed as an ad valorem tax millage rate. The tax determined from multiplying the ad valorem assessment times the ad valorem tax rate is typically collected by the tax collector or tax commissioner. Application of a value-added tax =United Kingdom= The third largest source of government revenues is value-added tax (VAT), charged at the standard rate of 20% on supplies of goods and services. It is therefore a tax on consumer expenditure. Certain goods and services are exempt from VAT, and others are subject to VAT at a lower rate of 5% (the reduced rate) or 0% (\\"zero-rated\\"). =Canada= The Goods and Services Tax (GST) (French: Taxe sur les produits et services, TPS) is a multi-level value- added tax introduced in Canada on January 1, 1991, by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and finance minister Michael Wilson. The GST replaced a hidden 13.5% Manufacturers' Sales Tax (MST) because it hurt the manufacturing sector's ability to export. The introduction of the GST was very controversial. As of January 1, 2012, the GST stood at 5%. As of July 1, 2010, the federal GST and the regional Provincial Sales Tax (PST) were combined into a single value- added sales tax, called the Harmonized Sales Tax (HST). The HST is in effect in five of the ten Canadian provinces: British Columbia, Ontario, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Nova Scotia. Effective April 1, 2013, the Government of British Columbia eliminated the HST and reinstated PST and GST on taxable services provided in British Columbia. VGGSA =Australia= The Goods and Services Tax is a value-added tax of 10% on most goods and services sold in Australia. It was introduced by the Howard Government on 1 July 2000, replacing the previous federal wholesale sales tax system and designed to phase out the various state and territory taxes such as banking taxes, stamp duty and land value tax. While this was the stated intent at the time, the States still charge duty on a various transactions, including but not limited to vehicle transfers and land transfers, insurance contracts and agreements for the sale of land. Many States, such as Western Australia, have made recent amendments to duties laws to phase out particular duties and clarify existing ones. The Duties Act 2008 (WA) is available online at the Western Australian State Law Publisher =New Zealand= The Goods and Services Tax is a value-added tax of 15% on most goods and services sold in New Zealand. It was introduced by the Fourth Labour Government on 1 October 1986 at a rate of 10%. This was increased to 12.5% on 1 July 1989 and 15% on 1 October 2010. =Europe= A common VAT system is compulsory for the member states of the European Union. The EU VAT system is imposed by a series of European Union directives, the most important of which is the Sixth VAT Directive (Directive 77/388/EC). Nevertheless, some member states have negotiated variable rates (Madeira in Portugal) or VAT exemption for regions or territories. The regions below fall out of the scope of EU VAT: * √Öland Islands (Finland) * Heligoland island, B√ºsingen am Hochrhein territory (Germany) * Guadeloupe, Martinique, French Guiana, R√©union (France) * Mount Athos (Greece) * Ceuta, Melilla, The Canary Islands (Spain) * Livigno, Campione d'Italia, Lake Lugano (Italy) * Gibraltar, The Channel Islands (United Kingdom) Under the EU system of VAT, where a person carrying on an economic activity supplies goods and services to another person, and the value of the supplies passes financial limits, the supplier is required to register with the local taxation authorities and charge its customers, and account to the local taxation authority for VAT (although the price may be inclusive of VAT, so VAT is included as part of the agreed price, or exclusive of VAT, so VAT is payable in addition to the agreed price). VAT that is charged by a business and paid by its customers is known as output VAT (that is, VAT on its output supplies). VAT that is paid by a business to other businesses on the supplies that it receives is known as input VAT (that is, VAT on its input supplies). A business is generally able to recover input VAT to the extent that the input VAT is attributable to (that is, used to make) its taxable outputs. Input VAT is recovered by setting it against the output VAT for which the business is required to account to the government, or, if there is an excess, by claiming a repayment from the government. Different rates of VAT apply in different EU member states. The minimum standard rate of VAT throughout the EU is 15%, although reduced rates of VAT, as low as 5%, are applied in various states on various sorts of supply (for example, domestic fuel and power in the UK). The maximum rate in the EU is 25%. The Sixth VAT Directive requires certain goods and services to be exempt from VAT (for example, postal services, medical care, lending, insurance, betting), and certain other goods and services to be exempt from VAT but subject to the ability of an EU member state to opt to charge VAT on those supplies (such as land and certain financial services). Input VAT that is attributable to exempt supplies is not recoverable, although a business can increase its prices so the customer effectively bears the cost of the 'sticking' VAT (the effective rate will be lower than the headline rate and depend on the balance between previously taxed input and labour at the exempt stage). Finally, some goods and services are \\"zero-rated\\". The zero-rate is a positive rate of tax calculated at 0%. Supplies subject to the zero-rate are still \\"taxable supplies\\", i.e. they have VAT charged on them. In the UK, examples include most food, books, drugs, and certain kinds of transport. The zero-rate is not featured in the EU Sixth Directive as it was intended that the minimum VAT rate throughout Europe would be 5%. However, zero-rating remains in some Member States, most notably the UK, as a legacy of pre-EU legislation. These Member States have been granted a derogation to continue existing zero-rating but cannot add new goods or services. The UK also exempts or lowers the rate on some products depending on situation; for example milk products are exempt from VAT, but if you go into a restaurant and drink a milk drink it is VAT- able. Some products such as feminine hygiene products and baby products (nappies etc.) are charged at 5% VAT along with domestic fuel. When goods are imported into the EU from other states, VAT is generally charged at the border, at the same time as customs duty. \\"Acquisition\\" VAT is payable when goods are acquired in one EU member state from another EU member state (this is done not at the border but through an accounting mechanism). EU businesses are often required to charge themselves VAT under the reverse charge mechanism where services are received from another member state or from outside of the EU. Businesses can be required to register for VAT in EU member states, other than the one in which they are based, if they supply goods via mail order to those states, over a certain threshold. Businesses that are established in one member state but which receive supplies in another member state may be able to reclaim VAT charged in the second state under the provisions of the Eighth VAT Directive (Directive 79/1072/EC). To do so, businesses have a value added tax identification number. A similar directive, the Thirteenth VAT Directive (Directive 86/560/EC), also allows businesses established outside the EU to recover VAT in certain circumstances. Following changes introduced on July 1, 2003, (under Directive 2002/38/EC), non-EU businesses providing digital electronic commerce and entertainment products and services to EU countries are also required to register with the tax authorities in the relevant EU member state, and to collect VAT on their sales at the appropriate rate, according to the location of the purchaser. Alternatively, under a special scheme, non-EU businesses may register and account for VAT on only one EU member state. This produces distortions as the rate of VAT is that of the member state of registration, not where the customer is located, and an alternative approach is therefore under negotiation, whereby VAT is charged at the rate of the member state where the purchaser is located. The differences between different rates of VAT was often originally justified by certain products being \\"luxuries\\" and thus bearing high rates of VAT, whereas other items were deemed to be \\"essentials\\" and thus bearing lower rates of VAT. However, often high rates persisted long after the argument was no longer valid. For instance, France taxed cars as a luxury product (33%) up into the 1980s, when most of the French households owned one or more cars. Similarly, in the UK, clothing for children is \\"zero rated\\" whereas clothing for adults is subject to VAT at the standard rate of 20%. Impact The theory of the firm shows that taxes on transfers can encourage firms to internalise costs and grow, whereas the absence of such transactions may result in a larger number of individually smaller firms. For example, a sales tax ‚Äì unlike a VAT ‚Äì would realign the incentives of a steel mill in favor of operating its own coal mine, as opposed to simply buying coal in a transaction subject to taxation; the theory of the firm's model suggests that this would be less economically efficient as it results in a decline in specialization.

It enrolls approximately 1,400 students and is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. It is affiliated with the Presbyterian Church (USA). Alma College offers five degrees (Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Music, Bachelor of Fine Arts and Bachelor of Science in Nursing) in 41 majors. Academic programs that typically produce the most graduates are Business Administration, Biology, Psychology, Integrative Physiology and Health Science, Education, English, and History. Students are encouraged to participate in service learning and study abroad opportunities designed to enhance classroom learning. History The College was founded by Michigan Presbyterians in 1886. It received funding from lumber magnate Ammi W. Wright, for whom Wright Hall on campus and Wright Avenue in the city of Alma are named. Prior to 1934, the Alma mascot was the Fighting Presbyterians. This became the subject of debate in 1931 due to a series of stories by The Almanian, a student-run newspaper, expressing discontent over the limitation on cheers to \\"Go Presbyterians\\" or \\"Go Campbellites\\", the latter in support of the football coach, Royal Campbell. While still maintaining a close relationship with the Presbyterian Church, Alma College offers an environment that welcomes students of all religious backgrounds. The college's 13th president, Dr. Jeff Abernathy, assumed leadership in June 2010. =Criticisms of ranking systems= In January 1997, President Alan Stone of Alma College asked 480 colleges to boycott the U.S. News and World Report Rankings due to weaknesses in the peer assessment survey, which counted for 25% of a college's ranking. According to the Chronicle of Higher Education, in 1996, Alma College surveyed 158 colleges about the rankings. The result of the survey indicated that \\"84 percent of the respondents admitted that they were unfamiliar with some of the institutions they had been asked to rank. Almost 44 percent indicated that they 'tended to leave responses for unfamiliar schools blank.' Stone said, \\"this makes me wonder just how many votes are being considered for each school's academic-reputation ranking\\". After a June 2007 meeting of the Annapolis Group, Alma college joined others who would be boycotting the rankings. According to a June 22, 2007 article for The Morning Sun: > President Dr. Saundra Tracy said she agreed with a majority of her peers at > a meeting this week to stop participating in the personality assessment > portion of the annual college rankings published by U.S. News and World > Report. A consensus was taken at the end of an annual meeting of the > Annapolis Group, an association of liberal arts colleges. Tracy supported > the action and criticized the magazine's unscientific process to rate the > popularity and reputation of a school based on what presidents, provosts and > admission deans say in a survey. =Presidents= The following thirteen individuals have served as president of Alma College from the creation of the office to the present. Those marked with their names in bold had graduated from Alma. Where years do not overlap, there was a gap of a few months while a suitable candidate was found. * George F. Hunting (1887‚Äì1891) * August Bruske (1891‚Äì1912) * Thomas Blaisdell (1912‚Äì1915) * Harry M. Crooks (1915‚Äì1937) * John Wirt Dunning (1938‚Äì1942) * Roy W.

Students typically use the latter term for travel classes, research and internships. The College has a nationally competitive Scholarship Committee, designed to help juniors and seniors apply for funding opportunities for graduate and professional school. Alma students have won Fulbright, Gates-Cambridge, Truman, and Udall scholarships, as well as becoming finalists for the Marshall and Rhodes scholarships. Since 2003, 45 students have received nationally competitive scholarships and fellowships, including 24 Fulbright scholarships. The Posey Global Fellowship program and the Responsible Leadership Institute are designed to further students' awareness of ethical leadership and service in an increasingly global economy and political landscape. In addition, the Presidential Honors Program is an intellectual community centered on collaborative research and a conscious commitment to the liberal arts. =Alma Commitment= Alma College offers a four-year graduation promise, the Alma Commitment. In addition, it pledges that each interested student can participate in an experiential learning opportunity, such as an internship, research fellowship, or study abroad, backed by up to $2,500 in Alma Venture funding from the college. The Alma Commitment, offered for the first time to the entering fall 2013 class, applies to all 136-credit majors. If a student meets program requirements but is not able to graduate in four years (eight terms), the college will pay the tuition cost for the student's ninth term. = Majors and programs of emphasis = Since 2010, Alma has created several new majors, including Health Care Administration, Environmental Studies, Anthropology, Biotechnology, New Media Studies, and Special Education-Learning Disabilities. A new Integrated Health Studies Institute brings together students from across the disciplines with health-related career interests to gain practical experience in health fields and discuss cross-disciplinary issues related to health. In February 2014, the College received state approval to offer the Bachelor of Science in Nursing, or BSN, program. In April 2014, the Alma faculty approved new majors in accounting, finance, management and marketing that build on existing foundations and supplement the business administration majors that Alma has had for decades. In addition to traditional majors, students may opt to create a Program of Emphasis (POE).Program of Emphasis Students work with faculty mentors to create their own major by taking courses from a variety of departments and combining them with internships and research experience that round out their POE. Some recent POEs have included Anthropology, Foreign Service, and Nonprofit Management. =Model United Nations= Alma College's nationally recognized Model United Nations program has won top honors at the National Model United Nations conference in New York City for 23 consecutive years (1997‚Äì2019)‚Äîthe longest active winning streak of any college or university in the nation. Alma College's all-time 45 \\"outstanding delegation\\" awards are the most of any college or university in the 92-year history of the conference. The Huffington Post has called Alma College's MUN team a \\"superpower\\". Campus McIntyre Mall with the Swanson Academic Center in the background Dunning Memorial Chapel Oscar E Remick Heritage Center Alma College is located in a small-town setting, the city of Alma having slightly fewer than 10,000 residents. Its primary academic buildings, built with a red brick motif, are centered around a large square, McIntyre Mall. West of this mall is picturesque Dunning Memorial Chapel. The majority of buildings are located on North Campus, that is, the area north of Superior Street. These include the major dormitory residences, as well as the academic and student life buildings. South Campus is home to suite-style residences (\\"New Dorms\\", so named because they were built later in the 1960s than residences in North Campus) as well as the new environmentally friendly apartment-style Wright Hall, inaugurated in 2005 and the second residence of its name, the former being demolished in 1976. South Campus is also home to \\"Fraternity Row\\" (Center Street) and \\"Sorority Row\\" (Superior Street) as well as several other themed houses. Over 50 percent of the buildings on Alma's campus were built under the long tenure (1956‚Äì1980) of Robert D. Swanson, after whom the main academic building is named. Recent additions to the campus include the Alan J. Stone Recreation Center in 2001, the Oscar E. Remick Heritage Center in 2000, Colina Library Wing in 2006, and the Hogan Physical Education CenterGittleman, Linda \\"Alma College met challenge in tough climate\\", Morning Sun (February 28, 2010) In addition to the main campus, the College also owns a ecological research area containing woodlands, a willow marsh, a sphagnum bog, and a glacial kettle lake, with a full research facility and a bird observatory, located in Vestaburg, about west of Alma. Athletics Alma college's mascot, Scotty, walking in the 2015 homecoming parade Alma College athletic teams, nicknamed the Scots, are part of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) - Division III and the Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association (MIAA). Generally, more than a third of Alma's students participate in sports. In October 2010, the College added men's wrestling, women's bowling, and men's and women's lacrosse as varsity sports, effective in the 2011-12 academic year. With these additions, the college offers 11 men's and 11 women's varsity athletic programs. The mascot of Alma College is Scotty. Depicted as a Scotsman, he wears a traditional highland Kilt, sporran, and sash woven in the Alma College tartan pattern. =Honors= * In 2006 Alma College quarterback Josh Brehm was named the recipient of the Gagliardi Trophy, the highest individual honor in NCAA Division III football. * In 1992 Alma's women's basketball team earned the NCAA Division III championship. * In 1999 Alma's Men's soccer team made it to the NCAA Final Four. * In 2016 Alma's Men's Basketball team made it to the NCAA Round of Eight, the first appearance in the NCAA tournament in the program's history. *In 2017 Alma's Competitive Cheer Team won the NCA National Championship in the All-Girl Intermediate Division 3 category. *In 2018 Alma's Competitive Cheer Team won the NCA National Championship in the All-Girl Advanced Division 3 category. *In 2019 Alma's Competitive Dance Team won the NDA National Championship in the Division 3 team dance category. Performing arts More than a third of all Alma students take part in at least one performance each year. The College offers majors in theatre, dance and music, but students of all majors may join in productions. The Heritage Center for the Performing Arts is the region's premiere performing arts facility. It houses the Theatre and Dance Department, and serves as the performance venue for the College's eight music ensembles. It features a 500-seat concert hall for large performances, an intimate 190-seat theatre, and a dance studio. Greek life Several social Greek letter organizations are active on the Alma College campus. There are seven social fraternities: Zeta Sigma, Delta Gamma Tau, Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, Sigma Chi, Tau Kappa Epsilon, Theta Chi, and Alpha Pi Alpha. There are five social sororities: Kappa Iota, Alpha Gamma Delta, Alpha Xi Delta, Gamma Phi Beta, and Phi Sigma Sigma. Other Greek organizations on campus include Sigma Alpha Iota, a women's music fraternity, and Alpha Phi Omega, a co-ed National Service Fraternity, in addition to numerous honorary and professional fraternities.

The watershed was once a major copper mining region. Recreation The Chitina River is suitable for floating in rafts, kayaks, and decked canoes by boaters with sufficient wilderness and whitewater skills. From a put-in place near Hubert's Landing, slightly downstream of Chitina Glacier, the river is Class II (medium) on the International Scale of River Difficulty all the way to the mouth at Chitina. Boaters starting from Hubert's Landing will have to make a difficult portage to reach the main river channel. It is also possible to put in at Jake's Bar, about halfway between the glacier and the river mouth. The shorter trip requires no portage. Hazards include cold silty water, bad weather, and the remote location. Grizzlies pose a danger to boaters, especially near the mouths of clear tributaries, where the bears tend to congregate. A variety of salmon, attractive to bears, migrate to and from these tributaries. Tributaries The most important tributaries of the Chitina are from the north and emanate principally from the south slope of the Wrangell Mountains; in order downstream they are Nizina, Lakina, Gilahina, and Kuskulana rivers. From the south the main affluents are the Tana, Chakina, and Tebay rivers, which rise in the Chugach Mountains. Kiagna River is also a southern tributary of Chitina River. The Tebay River, and an associated set of lakes and smaller streams in the Tebay watershed, offer \\"the potential for some of the finest wilderness angling experiences to be had in Southcentral Alaska\\", according to Alaska Fishing.

He led the groundbreaking development of compatible computers that changed the industry. Early life and education Evans was born in Grand Island, Nebraska. In 1951, after earning an engineering degree from Iowa State University, he joined IBM as a junior engineer. Career Bob O. Evans joined IBM in a low level engineering position in 1951 as it was developing a new range of \\"computers\\" based on vacuum tubes (earlier IBM computers used mechanical switches). A natural and very capable manager he moved up the company hierarchy to the position of vice president (development) in the Data Systems division in 1962. This was apparently created as a position where he had responsibility for the development of \\"System/360\\", a merger of IBMs separate scientific and business computing systems. In the early 1960s, Evans persuaded IBM‚Äôs chairman, Thomas J. Watson Jr., to discontinue the company‚Äôs development of a hodgepodge of incompatible computers and instead to embark on the development of a single product line of general-purpose, compatible computers. Until then, researchers thought that the fields of scientific computing and commercial data processing each required their own type of special-purpose computer. Compatibility would ensure that the same software could run on any model of the product line, avoiding a re-programming of software. Evans had overall responsibility for the hardware and software development of what was announced on April 7, 1964, as the IBM System/360 product line, with six models (later gradually expanded to 18 modelsIBM System/360 dates and characteristics) and a performance range factor of 50. IBM ‚Äì in 1964 a company with an annual revenue of $3.2 billion ‚Äì invested more than $5 billion in engineering, factories and equipment to develop and manufacture System/360, opening five plants and hiring 60,000 employees. In the lead article about System/360 in the IBM Journal of Research and Development, April 1964, only Evans was acknowledged by name, in these words: ‚ÄúThe scope of the compatibility objective and of the whole System/360 undertaking was largely due to B. O. Evans, Data Systems Division Vice President‚ÄìDevelopment.‚ÄùG. M. Amdahl, G. A. Blaauw and F. P. Brooks Jr., \\"Architecture of the IBM System/360\\", IBM Journal for Research and Development, April 1964 After a stint as president of IBM‚Äôs Federal Systems Division, in 1969 Evans was named president of IBM‚Äôs Systems Development Division (SDD). He was responsible for the development of what was announced on June 30, 1970 as the IBM System/370 product line, initially with three models, later gradually expanded to 17 models.IBM System/370 key dates The hardware was supported by four main operating systems. Any application that had run on System/360 could run on System/370. Equally important, where most of the processing on System/360 had been batch-oriented, with only the beginnings of interactive processing, new features of the System/370 opened the door to explosive growth in online transaction processing. SDD and a successor, the Systems Communications Division, also with Evans as its president, developed a communications architecture and a set of architecture- compliant communication product lines that were announced in 1974 under the banner of Systems Network Architecture (SNA). In today‚Äôs ocean of the Internet Protocol, there still are thousands of SNA islands in productive existence. Evans was also responsible for IBM‚Äôs Future Systems (FS) project. The project was terminated in 1975, in part because of anticipated software incompatibilities between FS and 360/370. On another front, IBM each year was doubling its shipments of online workstations, a market segment it had created around the IBM 3270 display system. Competition was starting to do better, and IBM began to lose market share in one of its \\"own\\" segments. In 1977 IBM named Evans senior vice president for engineering, programming, and technology. He left IBM in 1984. From 1981 until 1995, Evans was chief scientific advisor to the government in Taiwan. From 1984 on, he was partner of Hambrecht & Quist, and managing partner of Technology Strategies and Alliances. The latter company merged and became Rocket Ventures, of which he was a partner. Evans died in Hillsborough, Calif., on September 2, 2004.

Consequently, if both parents are carriers, there will be a 25% chance with each pregnancy that the defective gene from both parents will be inherited, and the child will suffer from the disease. There is a two in three chance that unaffected siblings will be carriers (Figure 1). In livestock alpha-mannosidosis is caused by chronic poisoning with swainsonine from locoweed. Symptoms left Alpha-mannosidosis is a lifelong multi-systemic progressive disease, with neuromuscular and skeletal deterioration over decades. The timing of the appearance of symptoms correlates with the severity of the disease. The onset of the most severe form of the disease occurs within the first months of life and involves skeletal abnormalities and intellectual disability, with rapid progression leading to death from primary central nervous system involvement or myopathy. However, most neonates with lysosomal storage disorders are asymptomatic and only rarely severely affected.Alpha Mannosidosis. National Organization for Rare Diseases (NORD) Factsheet 2015. https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/alpha- mannosidosis/ This delays diagnosis, particularly as milder forms of the disease involve only mild to moderate intellectual disability, which progresses gradually during childhood or adolescence.Guide to understanding mannosidosis.

Significant changes in a number of facial features may occur, such as: protruding forehead; flattened nasal bridge; small nose; wide mouth; and widely spaced teeth. Muscular weakness or spinal abnormalities can occur due to the build-up of storage materials in the muscle. Pathophysiology thumb|Electron micrograph of a vacuolated lymphocyte. Electron micrograph of a vacuolated lymphocyte from a mannosidosis patient (A) as compared to a lymphocyte from a normal control (B). Figure 2 A defective alpha-mannosidase enzyme, which normally helps to break down complex sugars derived from glycoproteins in the lysosome, causes progressive lysosomal accumulation of mannose-rich oligosaccharides in all tissues, resulting in impaired cellular function and apoptosis (Figure 2).Beck M Olsen KJ, Wraith JE et al. Natural history of alpha-mannosidosis: a longitudinal study. Orphanet J Rare Dis 2013;8:88. Complete absence of functionality in this enzyme leads to death during early childhood due to deterioration of the central nervous system. Enzymes with low residual activity lead to a milder form of the disease, with symptoms such as impaired hearing, cognitive impairment, susceptibility to bacterial infections, and skeletal deformities. The course of the disease is progressive. Depending on the severity of the disease, alpha-mannosidosis has been classified into three proposed subtypes, based on severity and age of onset. * Type 1: A mild form, recognized after age ten years, with absence of skeletal abnormalities, muscle problems (myopathy), and slow progression * Type 2: A moderate form, recognized before age ten years, with presence of skeletal abnormalities, myopathy, and slow progression. This is the most common form * Type 3: A severe form, leading to early death from progressive central nervous system involvement However, given the variety of mutations that have been documented, and the broad range and severity of symptoms, the disease is considered clinically as a continuum. Diagnosis  Alpha Mannosidosis is a progressive disorder, and its presence should be suspected in patients with cognitive disabilities, skeletal changes (e.g. swollen joints, curved spine), hearing loss and recurrent infections. Although children with the condition are often born seemingly normal, their condition deteriorates with age. Alpha-mannosidosis can impact on a patient's quality of life in many ways, including their ability to live independently, socialise or find employment.Borgwardt L, Lund AM, Dali CI (2014). Alpha-mannosidosis ‚Äì a review of genetic, clinical findings and options for treatment. Pediatr. Endocrinol. Rev. 12 Suppl 1:185-91. Generally, phenotypes of alpha- mannosidosis patients are not clearly distinguishable, which makes a prediction of the clinical course for an individual patient challenging. Patients may present to doctors, nurses or health visitors at different stages of progression, and with different ad hoc symptoms, making the link to suspect a diagnosis of alpha-mannosidosis difficult. The main symptoms can also be shared with those of other lysosomal storage disorders, such as mucopolysaccharidosis. Given the progressive nature of the disease, the earlier a correct diagnosis is achieved the better. The condition is often diagnosed and treated using a multi-disciplinary approach, involving paediatricians, orthopaedics, ophthalmologists, otologists, neurologists, immunologists, neurosurgeons and physiotherapists. A diagnosis of alpha- mannosidosis is suspected based upon identification of characteristic findings of a multi-symptomatic presentation, a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, and results from the diagnostic tests described below: A. Oligosaccharides in urine A preliminary investigation may be performed to measure mannose-rich oligosaccharide concentrations in urine. Elevated urinary excretion of mannose-rich oligosaccharides is suggestive, but not diagnostic of the disease. B. Acid alpha-mannosidase activity Diagnosis is confirmed by measuring residual alpha-mannosidase activity in leukocytes or other nucleated cells via a fluorometric assay. This is the most reliable diagnostic method, along with genetic testing. C. Genetic testing Identification of disease-causing mutations is achieved using DNA from peripheral blood cells, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of all 24 MAN2B1 exons, followed by DNA sequencing. Treatment There is no cure for congenital alpha-mannosidosis, and in general, the approach to management is proactive, with the aim of preventing emerging complications. After a full physical examination, physicians should focus on the known complications of alpha-mannosidosis, such as hydrocephalus, otitis media, hearing loss, dental caries, joint symptoms, kyphoscoliosis, and mental state. Treatment is often limited to reducing or controlling the symptoms of the condition by, for example, medications to control seizures, hearing aids to ameliorate hearing loss, and routine physical therapy to assist with muscular pain and weakness. In some cases, a wheelchair may be appropriate if muscle or spinal impairments immobilize the individual affected. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can be a treatment option for some patients, however the risk-benefit profile is more favourable in younger patients, therefore ensuring an early diagnosis is critical for this to be a viable option. The rationale is that enzyme-producing donor cells repopulate the host tissue and transfer enzyme to nearby enzyme-deficient host cells. Despite early reports to the contrary,Will A, et al. (1987). \\"Bone marrow transplantation in the treatment of alpha-mannosidosis\\". Disease in Childhood. 62 (10): 1044‚Äì1049. doi:10.1136/adc.62.10.1044.Grewal SS, Shapiro EG, Krivit W, et al. (2004).Effective treatment of alpha-mannosidosis by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. J Pediatr, 144:569-573. The possible benefits of HSCT must be weighed against the overall risk of procedure related morbidity and mortality. The benefits are greater in younger patients before complications have developed, and also transplant related complications are more frequent and severe in older patients. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is a therapeutic alternative in a number of lysosomal storage diseases. The overall principle of ERT is that a recombinantly produced version of the deficient enzyme is introduced into the blood stream, from where it is internalised by the cells and reaches the lysosomes by mannose-6-phosphate receptor mediated uptake, thus replacing the missing endogenous enzyme. An ERT is approved for use in the European Union.http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/medicines/003922/human_med_002231.jsp‚à£=WC0b01ac058001d124 Prognosis The long-term forecast for the condition is poor. There is generally a slow progression of neuromuscular and bone changes over decades. Behavioural problems, or psychiatric disorders may also be present. The life expectancy in alpha-mannosidosis is highly variable. Individuals with early onset severe disease often do not survive beyond childhood, whereas those with milder disorders may survive well into adult life. Independent living will be difficult, and patients with alpha-mannosidosis may become socially isolated, and during the late stages of the disease, they may become wheelchair bound, as they can no longer walk unaided. This is likely to have a negative impact upon the quality of life of caregivers and family members. Epidemiology The worldwide incidence of alpha-mannosidosis is not known exactly. However, a number of reports from different countries estimate that it occurs in approximately one in every million babies born worldwide. Mannosidosis is found in all ethnic groups in Europe, America, Africa, and Asia.

The edges of hoppered crystals are fully developed, but the interior spaces are not filled in. This results in what appears to be a hollowed out step lattice formation, as if someone had removed interior sections of the individual crystals. In fact, the \\"removed\\" sections never filled in, because the crystal was growing so rapidly that there was not enough time (or material) to fill in the gaps. The interior edges of a hoppered crystal still show the crystal form characteristic to the specific mineral, and so appear to be a series of smaller and smaller stepped down miniature versions of the original crystal. Hoppering occurs when electrical attraction is higher along the edges of the crystal; this causes faster growth at the edges than near the face centers. This attraction draws the mineral molecules more strongly than the interior sections of the crystal, thus the edges develop more quickly. However, the basic physics of this type of growth is the same as that of dendrites but, because the anisotropy in the solid‚Äìliquid inter-facial energy is so large, the dendrite so produced exhibits a faceted morphology. Hoppering is common in many minerals, including lab-grown bismuth, galena, quartz (called skeletal or fenster crystals), gold, calcite, halite (salt), and water (ice).

Photographed by ≈†echtl and Voseƒçek The Sokol movement (, falcon) is an all-age gymnastics organization first founded in Prague in the Czech region of Austria-Hungary in 1862 by Miroslav Tyr≈° and Jind≈ôich F√ºgner. It was based upon the principle of \\"a strong mind in a sound body\\". The Sokol, through lectures, discussions, and group outings provided what Tyr≈° viewed as physical, moral, and intellectual training for the nation. This training extended to men of all ages and classes, and eventually to women. The movement also spread across all the regions populated by Slavic cultures, most of them part of either Austria-Hungary or the Russian Empire: present-day Slovakia, the Slovene Lands, Croatia, Serbia (SK Soko), Bulgaria, Poland (Sok√≥≈Ç), Ukraine, Belarus. In many of these nations, the organization also served as an early precursor to the Scouting movements. Though officially an institution \\"above politics\\", the Sokol played an important part in the development of Czech nationalism and patriotism, which found expression in articles published in the Sokol journal, lectures held in the Sokol libraries, and theatrical performances at the gymnastic mass festivals called slets. Early history Members of the Sokol club in costume, 1880s photographed by ≈†echtl and Voseƒçek The idea for physical training centers was not a new one. The Sokol movement consciously traced its roots in physical education to the athletes and warriors of Ancient Greece. More directly, the nature of the Sokol was influenced by the German Turnverein, mass-based, nationalist-minded gymnastics societies founded by Friedrich Ludwig Jahn in 1811. Miroslav Tyr≈°, the founder of the first Sokol in Prague in 1862, continued as the most influential figure in the movement until his death in 1884. Born Friedrich Emanuel Tirsch into a German-speaking family in 1834, Tyr≈° grew up under the influence of the Romantic nationalism that gave rise to the uprisings that swept across Europe in 1848. He received a thorough education at the University of Prague, where he majored in philosophy. It was not until the early 1860s that he became involved in the Czech nationalist cause, and changed his name to the Slavic form. After he failed to find a position in academia, Tyr≈° combined his experience working as a therapeutic gymnastics trainer with the nationalist ideologies he had been exposed to in Prague: the first Sokol club was formed. The first Sokol worked to develop new Czech terminology for the training exercises, which centred on marching drills, fencing, and weightlifting. They designed a uniform that was a m√©lange of Slavic and revolutionary influences: brown Russian trousers, a Polish revolutionary jacket, a Montenegrin cap, and a red Garibaldi shirt. A Sokol flag, red with a white falcon, was designed by the writer Karol√≠na Svƒõtl√° (and painted by Czech artist Josef M√°nes). The Prague Sokol initially drew its leaders from the ranks of politicians and its members from the petite bourgeoisie and the working classes. The first president was Jind≈ôich F√ºgner, an ethnic German who was a member of the Czech cause. Most founders were also members of the Young Czechs party, the most influential including Prince Rudolf von Thurn-Taxis, Josef Bar√°k, and Julius and Eduard Gr√©gr. The authorities of Austria-Hungary continually kept a close eye on the movement, but the reputation and prestige of the Sokol continued to grow; soon the Sokol members were known by most as the \\"Czech national army\\". 1860s and 1870s: Initial growth, militarization, and internal problems Live statue of poetry for Sokol festival, 1911 photographed by ≈†echtl and Voseƒçek Within the first year the Sokols expanded beyond Prague, first into the Moravia and the Slovenian regions of the Habsburg empire. Initially the majority of members were students and professionals, but over time there was a trend towards increasingly working class members. The Sokol training went through periods of greater militarized training, during the Austro-Prussian War in 1866, when Sokol members were hired as guards for public events. This militaristic side of the Sokol movement continued to resurface throughout its history. The internal issues that were to plague the Sokol movement over the years emerged almost immediately. These internal arguments reached fruition during the 1870s with the power struggle in leadership between the members of Old Czechs and the Young Czechs parties. Theoretically, the Sokol was a society ‚Äúabove politics.‚Äù Always flamboyantly nationalistic, the more conservative members of the Sokol argued that the organization should maintain its distance from politics while the Young Czech members advocated more direct political participation. Theoretically, the Sokol was also open equally to members of all classes. The informal ‚Äúthou‚Äù (ty) was used by all members, but there were constant arguments over whether this was necessary or not. Different leaders believed that the Sokol was a mass-based institution defined by its working class members, while others viewed it more as a middle class apparatus by which to educate and raise the national consciousness of the working classes. 1880s: Slets and Sokol union Slet in Prague, 1920 photographed by ≈†echtl and Voseƒçek In 1882, the first slet was held.Margaret C. Brown, Betty K. Sommer: Movement Education: Its Evolution and a Modern Approach, Addison-Wesley, 1969, page 23: In celebration of the twentieth anniversary of the founding of the Sokol organization, the first \\"Slet\\" Festival was held in 1882 Slet came from the Czech word for \\"a flocking of birds\\" (Czech plural: slety). The same word exists or can be synthesized from common Slavic roots in other Slavic languages. It meant a mass gymnastics (1572 Sokols) festival that became a grand tradition within the Sokol movement that spread across Central Europe together with other Slavic movements such as the political movement of Pan- Slavism. The first and subsequent slets included an elaborate welcoming ceremony at the train station, mass demonstrations, gymnastics competitions, speeches, and theatrical events, open to members of all Sokols. In 1887 the Habsburg authorities finally allowed, after over twenty years worth of proposals, the formation of a union of Sokol clubs - Czech Sokol Community (ƒåesk√° obec sokolsk√°, ƒåOS). The union centralized all the Sokols in the Czech lands and sent Sokol trainers to the rest of the Slavic world to found Sokol institutions in Krak√≥w, Ljubljana, Zagreb, Sarajevo and even the Russian Empire (FC Spartak Moscow) (mostly the Ukrainian lands). In 1889, though officially forbidden by the authorities, members of the Prague Sokol went to the World's Fair in Paris. There they won several medals and established strong connections with French gymnasts and the French public.Museum, Volumes 43-44, Volume 187 of Unesco publication, UNESCO., 1991 p. 68 The Sokols have been credited with establishing the beginning of the strong French sympathy for the Czechs and their subsequent political alliances on this trip.J. Richard Polidoro: Sport and Physical Activity in the Modern World, Allyn and Bacon, 2000 p 33 1890s: The progressive era The 1890s were a progressive era for the Sokols. In order to encourage a wider range of participation, the Sokols reformed their programs, offering training sessions of varying intensities, extending their libraries, emphasizing the educational aspect of training, and starting programs for adolescents, youth, and women. There was an increasing focus on mass-based ideology and working class egalitarianism under the leadership of the Young Czechs, namely Jan Podlipn√Ω, who was also the mayor of Prague 1897‚Äì1900. The second slet was held in 1891 (over 5,000 Sokols) and the third one soon afterwards in 1895. At this third slet the congress of the Sokol union laid out its progressive new trajectory in the St. Wenceslas Day (September 28) Resolutions. The leaders chose to continue to provide more accessible forms of training, with less focus on competition and more on an egalitarian idea of people's gymnastics balancing mental as well as physical education. 1900‚Äì1914: Competitors and neo-Slavism Jumping over horse at the fourth slet, 1901 photographed by ≈†echtl and Voseƒçek The rise of the Social Democrats and agrarian parties in the political arena played out in Sokol politics as well as national ones. The Social Democrats formed a rival gymnastics society, the Workers' Gymnastics Club (Dƒõlnick√° tƒõlov√Ωchovn√° jednota, DTJ). V√°clav Kuka≈ô, a powerful ƒåOS figure, developed the policy of \\"cleansing\\" (oƒçi≈°tƒõn√≠) and sought to limit membership to those who he believed demonstrated commitment to purely Czech causes. Most of the progressive members of the Sokols were purged or left voluntarily to join the DTJ. Another rival gymnast society was founded by the Christian-Socialist party under the name Orel (\\"Eagle\\"). In the face of such competition, the Sokols set about reaffirming their traditional mission under the leadership of Josef Scheiner. Polish Sokols from Pozna≈Ñ city in 1932. The fourth slet, held in 1901 (11,000 Sokols), boasted a large international participation, including Galician Poles, Ukrainians, Slovenes, Croats, Russians, Bulgarians, Serbs, as well as Frenchmen and Americans. This slet also marked the first appearance of women who grew to be a major part of Sokol members in the following decades. The fifth slet, held in 1907 (over 12,000 Sokols), had an increasingly Slavic focus and moved away from the more egalitarian idea of people's gymnastics with increased competition aspects. It marked the creation of the Federation of Slavic Sokols under the neo-Slavic idea of the Czechs as the strongest Slavic nation, second only to Russia. At the 1910 meeting of the ƒåOS congress the sokols reaffirmed their intentions to remain \\"above politics\\" and loosened their strict membership rules to allow Social Democrats, though still not clericals, into the sokols. In 1912, the first \\"All-Slavic Slet\\" (V≈°eslovansk√Ω slet, over 30,000 Sokols) was held with a largely military atmosphere, causing Augustin Oƒçen√°≈°ek (a member of Sokol) to remark, \\"When the thunder comes and the nations rise up to defend their existence, let it be the Sokol clubs from which the cry to battle will sound...\\".Nolte, p. 78. The cry to battle did sound two years later, when the first rumors of Franz Ferdinand's assassination reached the Sokol members, most of whom were attending a regional slet in Brno. World War I to Communism: Continued struggle of Czech nationalism Exercises in T√°bor, 1924 photographed by ≈†echtl and Voseƒçek With the onset of World War I, in 1915 the Sokols were officially disbanded. Many members were active in persuading the Czechs to defect from the Austro-Hungarian army to the Russian side. Sokol members also helped create the Czechoslovak Legions and local patrols that kept order after the disintegration of Habsburg authority, and during the creation of Czechoslovakia in October 1918.PRECL√çK, Vratislav.

The Sokol flourished in the early interwar period, and by 1930 had 630,000 members. The Sokols held one last slet (350,000 Sokols) on the eve of the Munich Agreement of 1938 and were later brutally suppressed and banned during the Nazi occupation of Bohemia and Moravia. Sokol society among South Slavs Sokol society Du≈°an the Mighty, Kragujevac, 1910 The Slovenes organized their own gymnastic society on 1. October 1863 and named it Ju≈æni Sokol (South Falcon). Sokol societies were introduced in Slovenia by Viktor Murnik in the last decade of 19th century. V. Murnik was good gymnast. He was inspired by the Czech Sokol movement and studied Tyr≈°'s gymnastics bases.Toma≈æ Pavlin: Sokol movement in Slovenia - 150th anniversary of Ju≈æni Sokol, Science of Gymnastics Journal, Vol. 5 Issue 3: 5 - 18 Ljubljana 2013 The 1903 All-Sokols Rally was held in Ljubljana, Slovenia. The official name of the Slovenian Sokol was Ljubljana Sokol and its starosta was Kajzelj and the coach was Murnik.Vladislav Bevc: Liberal Forces in Twentieth Century Yugoslavia: Memoirs of Ladislav Bevc, Volume 58 of Studies in modern European history, Peter Lang, 2007, pp. 83-88 In Croatia, the Sokol movement had full support from Strossmayer, then Bishop of ƒêakovo. After the dissolution of Austria-Hungary and the establishment of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes in 1918, and under the leadership of Lazar Car, the Croatian Sokol societies were united with the Serbian and Slovenian Sokol clubs into a large Sokol Alliance on 15 June 1919. The Croatian clergy forced Croatian Sokols to leave the Yugoslav Sokol Alliance in 1919‚Äì20, fueling internal conflicts within the Alliance on political grounds. At the same time, senior Catholic clergy established the Orlovi (Eagles) clerical organization with the aim of taking youths away from the Alliance. The Croatian Catholic Church rejected the pan-Slavic idea of bringing together Catholic, Orthodox, and Muslim believers under the motto that \\"a brother is dear regardless of his faith\\". The two Catholic organizations, Orlovi (Eagles) and Katoliƒçka Akcija (Catholic Action) were a main base of this resistance to the idea of Yugoslavism, brotherhood and religious tolerance. The Catholic Church's resistance to this idea of pan-Slavism led the Polish Sokols to abstain from the international All Sokol Rally held in Prague in 1926.Viktor Novak: Magnum Crimen Ecclesia militants at war with the ideology of Tyr≈°, Gambit, Jagodina Serbia 2005 In the Kingdom of Yugoslavia all Sokol societies were merged into the Union of Sokols of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia as of December 1929. The Eagles were ordered to disband but they rebranded themselves as religious fraternities. This way the Sokol movement was the principal agent of the drive for cultural synthesis of the Yugoslav society. Honorary mayor of the Yugoslav Sokol was Prince Peter II.Christian Axboe Nielsen: Making Yugoslavs: Identity in King Aleksandar's Yugoslavia, University of Toronto Press, 2014, p. 113 In emigration 1965 U.S. commemorative stamp Members of Sokol who emigrated from Czechoslovakia set up small Sokol groups abroad. This Sokol migration, for a variety of reasons, began even before Czechoslovakia became a nation in 1918, intensified as a result of the World Wars and the Communist suppression, and continues to this day. Bohemian, Moravian, and Slovak immigrants and Czech- American citizens started the American Sokol Organization in St. Louis Missouri in 1865, only three years after the first Prague Sokol. Units quickly formed and by 1878, the United States had 13 Sokol chapters. 1933 Sokol Festival at Soldier Field June 25, 1933 A large slet (with well over a thousand participants) was held at the just-opened Chicago World's Fair (Century of Progress) at Chicago's Soldier Field on June 25, 1933. By 1937, American Sokol membership rolls counted nearly 20,000 adults in areas as far- flung as Baltimore,Sokol Baltimore History New York City, Nyack, New York, New Jersey, Pittsburgh, Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, Oakland, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Oklahoma, St. Louis, Texas, and parts of Canada. Senator Roman Hruska of Nebraska, who was of Czech heritage, was a lifelong member of Sokol Omaha. Aftermath Sokol slet in Prague, 2018 Sokol slet in Prague, 2018 After World War II Sokols held one more slet in 1948 before they were once again suppressed, this time by the Communists. The Communist Party tried to replace the tradition of slets with mass exercises employed for propaganda purposes: Spartakiad (spartaki√°dy) and its organization Czechoslovak Union of Physical Education. Many of the Sokol members were imprisoned or exiled but some took part in the preparation of Spartakiad. The Sokols reappeared briefly during the Prague Spring of 1968. After years of hibernation, the Sokol movement was revived for the fourth time in 1990. A slet was held in 1994 (with 23,000 Sokols participating), after the fall of Communism. =Currently= Child gymnasts in Sokol house, Libe≈à, Prague in 2018 Presently, the organization focuses on physical training in gymnastics and other athletics. Its popularity is, however, well below pre-war levels and a large percentage of members are older people with memories of the pre-1948 Sokol movement. Other members are mainly parents who register their kids for physical activities. A further slet was held in 2000 (25,000 Sokols); another was held in July 2006. In July 2012 there was celebration of 150 years of Sokol movement and in July 2018 was the 100 years anniversary of the creation of Czechoslovakia where 13,000 Sokols gathered in Prague.Thousands Sokols gathered in Prague for the 16th slet Slets are expected to be held every six years. =United States= Slets are also held in the United States by organizations of Czech (American Sokol Organization) and Slovak (Sokol USA) descent. The American Sokol Organization and Sokol USA alternate in hosting national slets in the United States at 4-year intervals. The American Sokol Organization most recently hosted the XXIV ASO Slet from June 22 through June 25, 2017 in Cedar Rapids, IA.L. Filipello, American Sokol Secretary. The American Sokol Organization will host the XXV ASO Slet in the summer of 2021 in the Chicago, IL suburbs.L. Filipello. American Sokol Secretary Sokol USA most recently hosted the XXVI national slet from June 29 through July 2, 2011 in Cleveland, Ohio. Sokol USA hosted the XXVII slet, commemorating the 120th anniversary of Sokol USA, from June 29 to July 2, 2016 in Pittsburgh, PA. Regional districts of the American Sokol Organization and Sokol USA also host smaller regional slets on an annual basis. =Catalonia= At the beginning of the twentieth century the Sokol movement was introduced in Catalonia and soon was considered as a new tradition. It bore the name of falc√≥ (falcon in Catalan) and was influenced by the older tradition of the castellers.

As of the 2016 census, there were 445 people living in Ballinakill. History From 1613 until the Act of Union, the town was a parliamentary borough, electing two members to the Irish House of Commons. The town was besieged and plundered by Irish rebels, including the Earl of Castlehaven and Lord Mountgarret, during the 1641 rebellion. When the castle and town surrendered much was robbed, including cattle, sheep and cloth. Remarkably, this information survives to us through an account from a native American Patagonian from present day southern Argentina/Chile 'but now a Christian' who had been a servant to Captain Richard Steele for twenty years and lived in Ballinakill. Landmarks The gardens of the Heywood Estate lie just north of Ballinakill The town square features a monument to men who died in the 1798 rebellion. The monument was erected in 1898. In 1998 a ceremony was held in Ballinakill to mark the bicentenary of the deaths.

He was born in Philadelphia, United States, in a Jewish family of Lithuanian extraction.http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Mordell.html Education Mordell was educated at the University of Cambridge where he completed the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos as a student of St John's College, Cambridge, starting in 1906 after successfully passing the scholarship examination. He graduated as third wrangler in 1909.'University Intelligence', Times, 16 June 1909. Research After graduating Mordell began independent research into particular diophantine equations: the question of integer points on the cubic curve, and special case of what is now called a Thue equation, the Mordell equation :y2 = x3 \\\\+ k. He took an appointment at Birkbeck College, London in 1913. During World War I he was involved in war work, but also produced one of his major results, proving in 1917 the multiplicative property of Srinivasa Ramanujan's tau-function. The proof was by means, in effect, of the Hecke operators, which had not yet been named after Erich Hecke; it was, in retrospect, one of the major advances in modular form theory, beyond its status as an odd corner of the theory of special functions. In 1920, he took a teaching position in UMIST, becoming the Fielden Chair of Pure Mathematics at the University of Manchester in 1922 and Professor in 1923. There he developed a third area of interest within number theory, the geometry of numbers. His basic work on Mordell's theorem is from 1921 to 1922, as is the formulation of the Mordell conjecture. He was an Invited Speaker of the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) in 1928 in Bologna and in 1932 in Z√ºrich and a Plenary Speaker of the ICM in 1936 in Oslo. He took British citizenship in 1929. In Manchester he also built up the department, offering posts to a number of outstanding mathematicians who had been forced from posts on the continent of Europe. He brought in Reinhold Baer, G. Billing, Paul Erd≈ës, Chao Ko, Kurt Mahler, and Beniamino Segre. He also recruited J. A. Todd, Patrick du Val, Harold Davenport and Laurence Chisholm Young, and invited distinguished visitors. In 1945, he returned to Cambridge as a Fellow of St. John's, when elected to the Sadleirian Chair, and became Head of Department. He officially retired in 1953. It was at this time that he had his only formal research students, of whom J. W. S. Cassels was one. His idea of supervising research was said to involve the suggestion that a proof of the transcendence of the Euler‚ÄìMascheroni constant was probably worth a doctorate. His book Diophantine Equations (1969) is based on lectures, and gives an idea of his discursive style. Mordell is said to have hated administrative duties.http://www-groups.dcs.st- and.ac.uk/history/Ledermann/Ch8.html Anecdote While visiting the University of Calgary, the elderly Mordell attended the Number Theory seminars and would frequently fall asleep during them. According to a story by number theorist Richard K. Guy, the department head at the time, after Mordell had fallen asleep, someone in the audience asked \\"Isn't that Stickelberger's theorem?\\" The speaker said \\"No it isn't.\\" a few minutes later the person interrupted again and said \\"I'm positive that's Stickelberger's theorem!\\" The speaker again said no it wasn't.

A fine center fielder, Gonz√°lez spent his best years with the Phillies. He had an average, though accurate, arm with excellent range. As a hitter, Gonz√°lez batted for average with occasional power, drew a significant number of walks, was a good bunter, and had enough power to collect an above-average number of doubles and triples. He hit a career-high 20 home runs in ; then, in , Gonz√°lez had career-highs in doubles (36) and triples (12), to place third and second, respectively, in the National League (NL). In , his career-high .339 batting average was second only to Roberto Clemente‚Äôs .357 for the NL batting crown, which also ranked second in the major leagues. In his twelve-season MLB career, Gonz√°lez hit .286 (1,485-for-5,195), with 103 home runs, 615 runs batted in (RBI), 690 runs, 238 doubles, 57 triples, and 79 stolen bases, in 1,559 games. Defensively, he recorded a .987 fielding percentage, while playing at all three outfield positions. In the 1969 National League Championship Series against the New York Mets, Gonz√°lez hit .357, with two RBI, one double, four runs, and one homer (off Tom Seaver). Following his big league career, Gonz√°lez played part of the season for the Hiroshima Toyo Carp of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB). In total, Gonz√°lez made about 5,800 trips to the plate over his major league career (about 4,600 ‚Äî or 80% ‚Äî of them against right-handed pitchers and the other 1,200 ‚Äî or 20% ‚Äî against left-handers); so, Gonz√°lez averaged about 400 plate appearances per year against righties and 100 plate appearances against lefties. In total, he hit .286, with a .350 on-base percentage, and a .413 slugging percentage. But what is striking about Gonz√°lez is that he exhibited a rather pronounced platoon-split during his career ‚Äî that is, being a left-handed batter, he hit right-handed pitchers much better than he hit southpaws. For his career, Gonzalez hit .303 against righties, with a .366 on-base percentage, and a .442 slugging percentage; against lefties, these numbers were only .219/.288/.299. Given that the 1960s were a time of reduced offensive output ‚Äî due in part to a larger strike zone and 4-man (rather than 5-man) rotations ‚Äî his performance against righties was exceptional, and if he would have had a right-handed hitting platoon-mate ‚Äî that could have covered his 100 or so plate appearances against southpaws each year ‚Äî Gonz√°lez might merit consideration as one of the best hitters of the decade. During the season, Gonz√°lez was the first MLB player to wear a batting helmet with a pre-molded ear-flap. He was in the NL top-ten in being hit by pitches, and the special helmet was constructed specifically for his use.

As a compliment to Ireland, the British team chose to race in Shamrock green which thus became known as British racing green. The route consisted of several loops of a route which included Kilcullen, Kildare, Monasterevin, Stradbally, Athy, Castledermot, and Carlow.

Canada was the colony along the St Lawrence River, part of present-day Ontario and Quebec. Its government underwent many structural changes over the following century. In 1867 Canada became the name of the new federal Dominion extending ultimately from the Atlantic to the Pacific and the Arctic coasts. Canada obtained legislative autonomy from the United Kingdom in 1931, and had its constitution (including a new rights charter) patriated in 1982. Canada's constitution includes the amalgam of constitutional law spanning this history.  Treaty of Paris (1763)  On February 10, 1763, France ceded most of New France to Great Britain. The 1763 Treaty of Paris confirmed the cession of Canada, including all its dependencies, Acadia (Nova Scotia) and Cape Breton Island to Great Britain. A year before, France had secretly signed a treaty ceding Louisiana to Spain to avoid losing it to the British. At the time of the signing, the French colony of Canada was already under the control of the British army since the capitulation of the government of New France in 1760. (See the Articles of Capitulation of Montreal.)  Royal proclamation (1763)  A portion of eastern North America; the 1763 \\"Proclamation line\\" is the border between the red and the pink areas. The policy of Great Britain regarding its newly acquired colonies of America was revealed in a Royal Proclamation, issued on October 7, 1763. The proclamation renamed Canada \\"The Province of Quebec\\", redefined its borders and established a British-appointed colonial government. Although not an act of Parliament, the proclamation expressed the will of the British Crown to govern its new possessions. The proclamation was thus considered constitution of Quebec until the passing of the Quebec Act, by which the colony was granted a legislature. The new governor of the colony was given \\"the power and direction to summon and call a general assembly of the people's representatives\\" when the \\"state and circumstances of the said Colonies will admit thereof\\". The governor was also given the mandate to \\"make, constitute, and ordain Laws, Statutes, and Ordinances for the Public Peace, Welfare, and good Government of our said Colonies, and of the People and Inhabitants thereof\\" with the consent of the British-appointed councils and representatives of the people. In the meantime, all British subjects in the colony were guaranteed of the protection of the law of England, and the governor was given the power to erect courts of judicature and public justice to hear all causes, civil or public. The Royal Proclamation contained elements that conflicted with the Articles of Capitulation of Montreal, which granted Canadians the privilege to maintain their civil laws and practise their religion. The application of British laws such as the penal Laws caused numerous administrative problems and legal irregularities. The requirements of the Test Act also effectively excluded Catholics from administrative positions in the British Empire. When James Murray was commissioned as captain general and governor in chief of the Province of Quebec, a four-year military rule ended, and the civil administration of the colony began. Judging the circumstances to be inappropriate to the establishment of British institutions in the colony, Murray was of the opinion that it would be more practical to keep the current civil institutions. He believed that, over time, the Canadians would recognize the superiority of British civilization and willingly adopt its language, its religion, and its customs. He officially recommended to retain French civil law and to dispense the Canadians from taking the Oath of Supremacy. Nevertheless, Murray followed his instructions and British institutions began to be established. On September 17, 1764, the Courts of the King's Bench and Common Pleas were constituted. Tensions quickly developed between the British merchants or old subjects, newly established in the colony, and Governor Murray. They were very dissatisfied with the state of the country and demanded that British institutions be created immediately. They demanded that common law be enforced to protect their business interests and that a house of assembly be created for English-speaking Protestants alone. Murray did not think very highly of these tradesmen. In a letter to the British Lords of Trade, he referred to them as \\"licentious fanatics\\" who would not be satisfied but by \\"the expulsion of the Canadians\\". The conciliatory approach of Murray in dealing with the demands of the Canadians was not well received by the merchants. In May 1764, they petitioned the king for Murray's removal, accusing him of betraying the interests of Great Britain by his defence of the Canadian people's interests. The merchants succeeded in having him recalled to London. He was vindicated, but did not return to the Province of Quebec. In 1768, he was replaced by Sir Guy Carleton, who would contribute to the drafting of the 1774 Quebec Act. Murray called in the representatives of the people in 1765; however, his attempt to constitute a representative assembly failed, as, according to historian Francois-Xavier Garneau, the Canadians were unwilling to renounce their Catholic faith and take the test oath required to hold office. = Restoration movement (1764‚Äì1774) = On October 29, 1764, 94 Canadian subjects submitted a petition demanding that the orders of the king be available in French and that they be allowed to participate in the government. In December 1773, Canadian landlords submitted a petition and a memorandum in which they asked: * That the ancient laws, privileges, and customs be restored in full * That the province be extended to its former boundaries * That the law of Britain be applied to all subjects without distinction They expressed their opinion that the time was not right for a house of assembly because the colony could not afford it and suggested that a larger council, composed of both new and old subjects, would be a better choice. In May 1774 the British merchants trading in Quebec responded by submitting their case to the king. = Reform movement (1765‚Äì1791) = As early as 1765, British merchants established in Quebec City addressed a petition to the King to ask for \\"the establishment of a house of representatives in this province as in all the other provinces\\" of the continent. Indeed, all the other colonies of British America had parliamentary institutions, even Nova Scotia, which obtained its Parliament in 1758. The movement for reform did not receive any support from the Canadians originally.  Quebec Act (1774)  Province of Quebec in 1774 The Quebec Act granted many of the requests of the Canadians. Enacted on June 13, 1774, the act changed the following: * The boundaries of the Province of Quebec were greatly expanded to the west and south. The territory now covered the whole of the Great Lakes Basin. * The free practice of the Catholic faith was confirmed. The Roman Catholic Church was officially recognized and permitted to operate under British sovereignty. * The Canadians were dispensed of the test oath, which was replaced by an oath to George III that had no reference to Protestantism. This made it possible for Canadians to hold positions in the colonial administration. * French civil law was fully restored and British criminal law was established. The seigneurial method of land tenancy was thus maintained. * A British criminal code was established. No assembly of representatives was created, which allowed the governor to keep ruling under the advice of his counsellors. The British merchants of Quebec were not pleased by this new act, which ignored their most important demands. They continued to campaign to abolish the current civil code and establish a house of assembly excluding Catholics and French-speakers. The Quebec Act was also very negatively received in the British colonies to the south. (See the Intolerable Acts.) This act was in force in the Province of Quebec when the American Revolutionary War broke out in April 1775. = Letters to the inhabitants of the Province of Quebec (1774-1775) = During the revolution, the Continental Congress attempted to rally the Canadian people to its cause. The delegates wrote three letters (Letters to the inhabitants of Canada) inviting them to join in the revolution. The letters circulated in Canada, mostly in the cities of Montreal and Quebec. The first letter was written on October 26, 1774, and signed by the president of the congress, Henry Middleton. It was translated into French by Fleury Mesplet, who printed it in Philadelphia and distributed the copies himself in Montreal. The letter pleaded the cause of democratic government, the separation of powers, taxation power, habeas corpus, trial by jury, and freedom of the press. The second letter was written on May 25, 1775. Shorter, it urged the inhabitants of Canada not to side against the revolutionary forces. (The congress was aware that the British colonial government had already asked the Canadians to resist the call of the revolutionaries.) On May 22, 1775, Bishop of Quebec Jean- Olivier Briand sent out a mandement asking the Canadians to close their ears to the call of the \\"rebels\\" and defend their country and their king against the invasion. Although both the British and the revolutionaries succeeded at recruiting Canadian men for militia, the majority of the people chose not to get involved in the conflict. In 1778, Frederick Haldimand became governor in replacement of Guy Carleton. (He served up until 1786, when Guy Carleton (now Lord Dorchester) returned as governor.) = Resumption of the reform movement (1784) = Soon after the war, which ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1783, the constitutional question resurfaced. In July 1784, Pierre du Calvet, a rich French merchant established in Montreal, published a pamphlet entitled Appel √† la justice de l'√âtat (Call to the Justice of the State) in London. Printed in French, the document is the first plea in favour of a constitutional reform in Canada. Du Calvet, imprisoned at the same time and for the same reasons as Fleury Mesplet and Valentine Jautard, both suspected of sympathizing and collaborating with the American revolutionaries during the war, undertook to have the injustice committed towards him be publicly known by publishing The Case of Peter du Calvet and, a few months later, his Appel √† la justice de l'√âtat. On November 24, 1784, two petition for a house of assembly, one signed by 1436 \\"New Subjects\\" (Canadians) and another signed by 855 \\"Old Subjects\\" (British), were sent to the king of Great Britain. The first petition contained 14 demands. \\"A Plan for a House of Assembly\\" was also sketched in the same month of November. In December, \\"An Address to His Majesty in opposition to the House of Assembly and a list of Objections\\" were printed by the press of Fleury Mesplet in Montreal. The main objection to the house of assembly was that the colony was not, according to its signatories, in a position to be taxed. At the time the November 24 petition was submitted to the king, numerous United Empire Loyalists were already seeking refuge in Quebec and Nova Scotia. In Quebec, the newly arrived settlers contributed to increase the number of people voicing for a rapid constitutional reform. In Nova Scotia, the immigrants demanded a separate colony. = Parliamentary constitution project (1789) = In 1786, the British government appointed Guy Carleton, as \\"governor-in-chief\\" and also governor of Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and St. John's Island (present-day Prince Edward Island). Carleton, now Lord Dorchester, had been British commander in Canada and governor of Quebec during the American Revolutionary War. When he returned as governor, he was already informed that the arrival of the Loyalists would require changes. On October 20, 1789, Home Secretary William Wyndham Grenville wrote a private and secret letter to Carleton, informing him of the plans of the king's counsellors to modify Canada's constitution. The letter leaves little doubt as to the influence that American independence and the taking of the Bastille (which had just occurred in July) had on the decision. In the first paragraph, Grenville writes: \\"I am persuaded that it is a point of true Policy to make these Concessions at a time when they may be received as matter of favour, and when it is in Our own power to regulate and direct the manner of applying them, rather than to wait 'till they shall be extorted from Us by a necessity which shall neither leave Us any discretion in the form, nor any merit in the substance of what we give.\\" Grenville prepared the constitution in August 1789. But he was appointed to the House of Lords before he could submit his project to the House of Commons. Thus, Prime Minister William Pitt did it in his place. British merchants established in Quebec sent Adam Lymburner to Britain to present their objections. They objected to the creation of two provinces, suggested an increase in the number of representatives, asked for elections every three years (instead of seven), and requested an electoral division which would have overrepresented the Old Subjects by granting more representatives to the populations of the cities. Lymburner's revisions were opposed by Whigs such as Charles James Fox, and in the end only the suggestions related to the frequency of elections and the number of representatives were retained.  Constitutional Act (1791)  Canada in 1791 after the Act. On June 10, 1791, the Constitutional Act was enacted in London and gave Canada its first parliamentary constitution. Containing 50 articles, the act brought the following changes: * The Province of Quebec was divided into two distinct provinces, Province of Lower Canada (present-day Quebec) and Province of Upper Canada (present-day Ontario). * Each province was given an elected Legislative Assembly, an appointed Legislative Council, and an appointed Executive Council. * Upper Canada was to be administered by a lieutenant governor appointed by the governor general, while Lower Canada was to be administered by a direct representative of the governor general. * The Legislative Councils were to be established with no fewer than seven members in Upper Canada and fifteen members in Lower Canada. The members were to hold their seat for life. * The Legislative Assembly was to be established with no less than sixteen members in Upper Canada and fifty members in Lower Canada. * The governor was given the power to appoint the speaker of the Legislative Assembly, to fix the time and place of the elections and to give or withhold assent to bills. * Provisions were made to allot clergy reserves to the Protestant churches in each province. This partition ensured that Loyalists would constitute a majority in Upper Canada and allow for the application of exclusively British laws in this province. As soon as the province was divided, a series of acts were passed to abolish the French civil code in Upper Canada. In Lower Canada, the coexistence of French civil law and English criminal law continued. Although it solved the immediate problems related to the settlement of the Loyalists in Canada, the new constitution brought a whole new set of political problems which were rooted in the constitution. Some of these problems were common to both provinces, while others were unique to Lower Canada or Upper Canada. The problems that eventually affected both provinces were: * The Legislative Assemblies did not have full control over the revenues of the provinces * The Executive and Legislative Councils were not responsible to the Legislative Assembly In the two provinces, a movement for constitutional reform took shape within the majority party, the Parti canadien of Lower Canada and the Reformers of Upper Canada. Leader of the Parti Canadien, Pierre-Stanislas B√©dard was the first politician of Lower Canada to formulate a project of reform to put an end to the opposition between the elected Legislative Assembly and the Governor and his Council which answered only the Colonial Office in London. Putting forward the idea of ministerial responsibility, he proposed that the members of the Legislative Council be appointed by the Governor on the recommendation of the elected House. = Union Bill (1822) = In 1822, the Secretary of Colonial Office Lord Bathurst and his under-secretary Robert John Wilmot-Horton secretly submitted a bill to British House of Commons which projected the legislative union of the two Canadian provinces. Two months after the adjournment of the discussions on the bill, the news arrived in Lower Canada and caused a sharp reaction. Supported by Governor Dalhousie, anglophone petitioners from the Eastern Townships, Quebec City and Kingston, the bill submitted in London provided, among other things, that each of the two sections of the new united province would have a maximum of 60 representatives, which would have put the French-speaking majority of Lower Canada in a position of minority in the new Parliament. The mobilization of the citizens of Lower Canada and Upper Canada began in late summer and petitions in opposition to the project were prepared. The subject was discussed as soon as the session at the Parliament of Lower Canada opened on January 11, 1823. Ten days later, on January 21, the Legislative Assembly adopted a resolution authorizing a Lower Canadian delegation to go to London in order to officially present the quasi-unanimous opposition of the representatives of Lower Canada to the project of union. Exceptionally, even the Legislative Council gave its support to this resolution, with a majority of one vote. Having in their possession a petition of some 60 000 signatures, the Speaker of the House of Assembly, Louis-Joseph Papineau, as well as John Neilson, Member of Parliament, went to London to present the opinion of the majority of the population which they represented. Faced with the massive opposition of people most concerned with the bill, the British government finally gave up the union project submitted for adoption by its own Colonial Office. = Report of the Special Committee of the House of Commons (1828) = A Select Committee of the House of Commons on the Civil Government of Canada was appointed on May 2, 1828 \\"to enquire into the state of the civil government of Canada, as established by the Act 31 Geo. III., chap. 31, and to report their observations and opinions thereupon to the house.\\" It reported on July 22 of the same year. It recommended against the union of Upper Canada and Lower Canada and in favour of constitutional and administrative reforms intended to prevent the recurrence of the abuses complained of in Lower Canada. = The Ninety-Two Resolutions of the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada (1834) = These constituted a sort of declaration of rights on the part of the patriote party. They were drafted by A. N. Morin, but were inspired by Louis-Joseph Papineau. They demanded the application of the elective principle to the political institutions of the province, after the American model; but did not advocate, in any explicit way, the introduction of responsible government. Lord Aylmer, the governor-general of Canada at that time, in an analysis of the resolutions, maintained that \\"eleven of them represented the truth; six contained truth mixed with falsehood; sixteen were wholly false; seventeen were doubtful; twelve were ridiculous; seven repetitions; fourteen consisted of abuse; four were both false and seditious; and the remaining five were indifferent.\\" = Royal Commission for the Investigation of all Grievances Affecting His Majesty's Subjects of Lower Canada (1835) = Following the adoption of the Ninety-Two Resolutions, the Governor Gosford arrived in Lower Canada to replace governor Aylmer. Gosford set up royal commission of inquiry conducted by Charles E. Gray and George Gipps. The Royal Commission for the Investigation of all Grievances Affecting His Majesty's Subjects of Lower Canada reported on November 17, 1836 and the Ten resolutions of John Russel were mostly based on it. = John Russell's Ten Resolutions (1837) = On March 2, 1837, John Russell, the British Colonial Secretary, submitted ten resolutions to the Parliament in response to the ninety-two resolutions. The Parliament adopted the resolutions on March 6. Most of the recommendations brought forth by the elected assemblies were systematically ignored by the Executive Councils. This was particularly true in Lower Canada with an assembly consisting mostly of French-Canadian members of the Parti Patriote. This impasse created considerable tensions between the French-Canadian political class and the British government. In 1834 Louis- Joseph Papineau, a French-Canadian political leader, submitted a document entitled the Ninety-Two Resolutions to the Crown. The document requested vast democratic reforms such as the transfer of power to elected representatives. The reply came three years later in the form of the Russell Resolutions, which not only rejected the 92 Resolutions but also revoked one of the assembly's few real powers, the power to pass its own budget. This rebuff heightened tensions and escalated into armed rebellions in 1837 and 1838, known as the Lower Canada Rebellion. The uprisings were short-lived, however, as British troops quickly defeated the rebels and burned their villages in reprisal. The rebellion was also contained by the Catholic clergy, which, by representing the only French-Canadian institution with independent authority, exercised a tremendous influence over its constituents. During and after the rebellions Catholic priests and the bishop of Montreal told their congregants that questioning established authority was a sin that would prevent them from receiving the sacraments. The Church refused to give Christian burials to supporters of the rebellion. With liberal and progressive forces suppressed in Lower Canada, the Catholic Church's influence dominated the French-speaking side of French Canadian/British relations from the 1840s until the Quiet Revolution secularized Quebec society in the 1960s. = Suspension of the Constitutional Act (1838) = Approximately four months after having proclaimed martial law in the district of Montreal, Governor Gosford suspended, on March 27, 1838, the Constitutional Act of 1791 and set up a Special Council. = Report on the Affairs of British North America (1839) = Following the rebellions, in May 1838, the British government sent Governor General Lord Durham to Lower and Upper Canada in order to investigate the uprisings and to bring forth solutions. His recommendations were formulated in what is known as \\"Lord Durham's Report\\" and suggested the forced union of the Canadas with the expressed purpose of \\"making [Lower Canada] an English Province [that] should never again be placed in any hands but those of an English population.\\" Doing so, he claimed, would speed up the assimilation of the French-Canadian population, \\"a people with no history, and no literature\\" into a homogenized English population. This would prevent what he considered to be ethnic conflicts.  Act of Union (1840)  Political organisation under the Union Act (1840) Following the publication of the Report on the Affairs of British North America, the British Parliament adopted, in June 1840, the Act of Union. The new Act, which effected the legislative union of Upper Canada and Lower Canada to form a single province named the Province of Canada, implemented the principal recommendation of John George Lambton's report, but did not grant a \\"responsible government\\" to the new political entity. Entering into force as of February 1841, the 62 articles of the Act of Union brought about the following changes: * The provinces of Upper Canada and Lower Canada were unified to form the Province of Canada; * The parliamentary institutions of the former provinces were abolished and replaced by a single Parliament of Canada; * Each of the two sections of the province corresponding to the old provinces were allotted an equal number of elected representatives; * The old electoral districts were redrawn in order to overrepresent the population of former Upper Canada and underrepresent the population of former Lower Canada; * The candidates to the legislative elections had to prove from then on that they were the owners of a land worth at least 500 pounds sterling; * The mandates, proclamations, laws, procedures and journals had from then on to be published and archived in the English language only; As a result, Lower Canada and Upper Canada, with its enormous debt, were united in 1840, and French was banned in the legislature for about eight years. Eight years later, an elected and responsible government was granted. By this time, the French-speaking majority of Lower Canada had become a political minority in a unified Canada. This, as Lord Durham had recommended in his report, resulted in English political control over the French-speaking part of Canada, and ensured the colony's loyalty to the British crown. On the other hand, continual legislative deadlock between English and French led to a movement to replace unitary government with a federal one. This movement culminated in Canadian Confederation. = Ministerial responsibility (1848) = Ministerial responsibility, the principal object of parliamentary struggles conducted by the Parti Canadien in Lower Canada and the Reformers in Upper Canada, becomes a reality in 1848, when Governor Lord Elgin agreed to let the leaders of the majority parties in Canada-East and the Canada-West, Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine and Robert Baldwin, form their own Executive Council. The Province of Canada therefore had its first government made up of members taken in the elected House of Assembly. This important change occurred a few months after Governor of Nova Scotia, Sir John Harvey, let James Boyle Uniacke form his own government. Nova Scotia thus became the first colony of the British Empire to have a government comparable to that of Great Britain itself. = Confederation projects (1858‚Äì1864) = In 1858, Joseph-Charles Tach√©, doctor and journalist from Quebec City, published a detailed project of federation. It was the first time that a project of this type was presented publicly since the proposal that John A. Roebuck had made in the same direction to John George Lambton while he was a governor of the Canadas in 1838. The same year, Alexander T. Galt, Member of Parliament for Sherbrooke, agreed to become a Minister of Finance in the Macdonald-Cartier government provided that his own project of confederation is accepted.  British North America Act (1867)  Robert Harris's Fathers of Confederation,This is a photograph taken in 1885 of the now-destroyed 1884 painting. an amalgamation of the Charlottetown and Quebec conferences. The British North America Act 1867 was the act that established Canada, by the confederation of the North American British colonies of the Canada, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. The former subdivisions of Canada were renamed from Canada West and Canada East to the Province of Ontario and Province of Quebec, respectively. Quebec and Ontario were given equal footing with New Brunswick and Nova Scotia in the Parliament of Canada. This was done to counter the claims of manifest destiny made by the United States, for the defence of Britain's holdings. American claims are evinced by the invasions of the Canadas during the American Revolutionary War and the War of 1812. Prior to the BNA Act of 1867, the British colonies of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, discussed the possibility of a fusion to counter the threat of American annexation, and to reduce the costs of governance. The Province of Canada entered these negotiations at the behest of the British government, and this led to the ambivalence of Prince Edward Island, which delayed joining the new Dominion until 1873. The constitutional conference, ironically, was held on Prince Edward Island, in Charlottetown. Newfoundland also participated (at the Quebec Conference) and likewise declined to join. = Province of Manitoba (1870) = On May 12, 1870, the British Crown proclaimed the Manitoba Act, enacted by the Parliament of Canada, effectively giving birth to the province of Manitoba. The 36 articles of the Act established the territorial limits, the subjects' right to vote, the representation in the Canadian House of Commons, the number of senators, the provincial legislature, permitted the use of English and French in the Parliament and in front of the courts and authorized the setting-up of a denominational education system. The coexistence, on the territory of the province, of French-speaking and Catholic communities (the M√©tis) as well as English-speaking and Protestant communities (British and Anglo-Canadian immigrants) explains the institutional arrangement copied from that of Quebec. = Province of British Columbia (1871) = = Province of Prince Edward Island (1873) = = Provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta (1905) = = Statute of Westminster (1931) = Canada and the other British dominions achieved full legislative sovereignty with the passage of the Statute of Westminster 1931, but prior to the Canada Act 1982 the British North America Acts were excluded from the operation of the Statute of Westminster and could only be amended by the British Parliament. = Royal Commission on Dominion‚ÄìProvincial Relations (1937) = = Province of Newfoundland (1949) = = Royal Commission of Inquiry on Constitutional Problems (1953) = = The Quiet Revolution (1960s) = In the early 1960s, the Quiet Revolution, stemming from a new assertiveness and a heightened sense of national identity among Qu√©b√©cois, dramatically changed the face of Quebec's institutions. The new provincial government headed by Jean Lesage and operating under the slogans \\"Il faut que √ßa change!\\" and \\"Ma√Ætre chez nous\\" (\\"It must change!\\", \\"Masters in our own house\\") secularized government institutions, nationalized electricity production and encouraged unionization. The reforms sought to redefine the relations between the vastly working-class francophone Qu√©b√©cois and the mostly anglophone business class. Thus passive Catholic nationalism stylized by Father Lionel Groulx gave way to a more active pursuit of independence, and in 1963 the first bombings by the Front de lib√©ration du Qu√©bec occurred. The FLQ's violent pursuit of a socialist and independent Quebec culminated in the 1970 kidnappings of British diplomat, James Cross and then the provincial minister of labour, Pierre Laporte in what is known as the October Crisis. The Quiet Revolution also forced the evolution of several political parties, and so, in 1966, a reformed Union Nationale led by Daniel Johnson, Sr., returned to power under the slogan \\"Equality or Independence\\". The new premier of Quebec stated, \\"As a basis for its nationhood, Quebec wants to be master of its own decision-making in what concerns the human growth of its citizens‚Äîthat is to say education, social security and health in all their aspects‚Äîtheir economic affirmation‚Äîthe power to set up economic and financial institutions they feel are required‚Äîtheir cultural development‚Äînot only the arts and letters, but also the French language‚Äîand the Quebec community's external development‚Äîits relations with certain countries and international bodies\\". = Fulton Formula (1961) = The Fulton Formula was named for federal Minister of Justice E. Davie Fulton. It proposed an amending formula that included unanimous consent of Parliament and all provinces for select areas of jurisdiction, the consent of Parliament and of the provinces concerned for provisions affecting one or more, but not all of the provinces, the consent of Parliament and of all the provinces except Newfoundland in matters of education, and the consent of Parliament and of the legislature of Newfoundland in matters of education in that province. For all other amendments, consent of Parliament and of at least two-thirds of the provincial legislatures representing at least 50 per cent of the population of Canada would be required.The Constitution of Canada, PWGSC website Agreement amongst the provinces was not achieved and the proposal was not implemented, but it was revived again with the Fulton-Favreau Formula in 1964, and several components were included in the Constitution Act, 1982. = Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism (1963) = For the federal government this demand for an enormous shift in power to a province done under a threat of a possible unilateral declaration of independence, was cause for great alarm. In 1967, on the initiative of Premier John Robarts of Ontario, a provincial first ministers' conference was held in Toronto to discuss the Canadian confederation of the future. From this, a first round of what would become annual constitutional meetings of all provincial premiers and the prime minister of Canada, was held in February 1968. On the initiative of Prime Minister Lester Pearson the conference undertook to address the desires of Quebec. Amongst numerous initiatives, the conference members examined the recommendations of a Bilingualism and Biculturalism Commission, the question of a Charter of Rights, regional disparities, and the timelines of a general review of the constitution (the British North America Act). In 1968, Ren√© L√©vesque's Mouvement souverainet√©-association joined forces with the Rassemblement pour l'ind√©pendance nationale and the Ralliement national to create the Parti Qu√©b√©cois; Quebec's provincial political party that has since espoused the province's sovereignty. That same year, Pierre Trudeau became prime minister of Canada by winning the leadership race of the federal Liberal Party. He would undertake numerous legislative measures to enhance the status of Quebec within Canada, including the passage into law in 1969 of the Official Languages Act, which expanded upon the original official language status of both French and English from the 1867 British North America Act. = Fulton-Favreau Formula (1964) = The Fulton‚ÄìFavreau formula was a proposed formula of amendment of the Constitution of Canada developed by federal justice minister E. Davie Fulton and Quebec Liberal Guy Favreau in the 1960s and approved at a federal-provincial conference in 1965.{http://archives.cbc.ca/politics/constitution/clips/2226/ CBC Digital Archives October 15, 1964 The formula would have achieved the patriation of the Constitution. Under the formula, all provinces would have to approve amendments that would be relevant to provincial jurisdiction, including the use of the French and English languages, but only the relevant provinces would be needed to approve amendments concerned with a particular region of Canada. The provinces would have been given the right to enact laws amending their respective constitutions, except for provisions concerning the office of Lieutenant Governor. Two-thirds of the provinces representing half of the population, as well as the federal Parliament, would be needed for amendments regarding education. The formula officially died in 1965 when Quebec Premier Jean Lesage withdrew his support. Modified versions re-emerged in the Victoria Charter (1971) and in the Constitution Act, 1982. = Victoria Charter (1971) = The 1971 Victoria Conference, a meeting between the federal government and the provinces, brought about the Victoria Charter. This Charter sought to establish a formula for amending the Constitution without requiring the unanimous consent of the provinces. Notably, it would give a veto to any province having or having ever had 25 percent of the Canadian population, thus essentially giving Quebec and Ontario veto powers. The provinces were supposed to confirm their acceptance by June 28, 1971, but a change of premiers in Saskatchewan and the reluctance of the federal government to recommend the Charter to Quebec's legislature, due to deficiencies in the clauses dealing with income security, led to the failure of this initiative. =Bill C-60, the Constitutional Amendment Bill= Bill C-60 was tabled in the House of Commons by the Prime MinisterDupras on \\"THE CONSTITUTION OF CANADA: A BRIEF HISTORY OF AMENDING PROCEDURE DISCUSSIONS\\" It contained a guarantee of \\"the right of the individual to the use and enjoyment of property, and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with law.\\"Johansen, \\"Property rights and the constitution\\" This language was contentious, especially in PEI. and as a result, Bill C-60 was referred to the Supreme Court of Canada, prior to passage. The reference contained questions on the Senate. The SCC ruled, in Re British North America Act and the Federal Senate (1979), 30 NR 271, that the federal government could act in matters related to section 91.1Text of the BNA Act of the British North America Act only with regards to matters of exclusive federal jurisdiction. The government chose to discontinue Bill C-60 as a result of this decision. = Referendum on Sovereignty-Association (1980) = In 1976 the Parti Qu√©b√©cois won the provincial election in Quebec with a 41.4 per cent to 33.8 per cent margin over the Parti lib√©ral du Qu√©bec, and in the 1980 Quebec referendum the Parti Qu√©b√©cois sought a mandate from the people of Quebec to negotiate new terms of association with the rest of Canada. With an 84-per-cent voter turnout, 60 per cent of Quebec voters rejected the proposal. After the 1980 referendum was defeated, the government of Quebec passed Resolution 176, which stated, \\"A lasting solution to the constitutional issue presupposes recognition of the Quebec-Canada duality.\\" Meeting in Ottawa on June 9, 1980, the newly re-appointed Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau and the provincial premiers set an agenda and gave their ministers responsibility for constitutional issues and a mandate to proceed with exploratory discussions to create a new Canadian constitution. However, given the separatist government of Quebec's position that there be two nations established first in accordance with Resolution 176, approval by Quebec of any changes to the BNA Act was impossible. This assertion of national duality was immediately followed with Resolution 177 that stated, \\"Quebec will never agree, under the existing system, to the patriation of the Constitution and to an amending formula as long as the whole issue of the distribution of powers has not been settled and Quebec has not been guaranteed all the powers it needs for its development.\\" As such, Quebec's government refused to approve the new Canadian constitution a year later. This failure to approve was a highly symbolic act, but one without direct legal consequence as no one questions the authority of the Canadian Constitution within Quebec. After losing the vote to secede from Canada, the government of Quebec made specific demands as minimum requirements for the Province of Quebec. These demands included control by the government of Quebec over: * the highest court in the province, replacing the Supreme Court of Canada with the Quebec Court of Appeals; * language and education; * economic development; * communications including cable television, radio, and satellite; * natural resources, including oil and gas; * all forms of taxation, except customs duties; * tourism; * fisheries, including a partitioning of the Gulf of St. Lawrence from the Atlantic Provinces; * scientific research; * recreation; * prisons; * labour relations; * the federal government of Canada paying for the above changes using federal tax funds The province of Quebec already had theoretically full control over education, health, mineral resources, supplemental taxation, social services, seniors' retirement pension funds, inter-provincial trade, and other areas affecting the daily lives of its citizens. Many Canadians viewed the additional demands as too greatly reducing the power of the federal government, assigning it the role of tax collector and manager of the national border with the United States. Others viewed these changes as desirable, concentrating power in the hands of Qu√©b√©cois politicians, who were more in tune with Qu√©b√©cois desires and interests. Though the Parti Qu√©b√©cois government said that the federal government of Canada would be responsible for international relations, Quebec proceeded to open its own representative offices in foreign countries around the world. These quasi-embassies were officially named \\"Quebec Houses\\". Today, the international affairs minister is responsible for the less-expensive Quebec delegation system.  Patriation: Canada Act (1982)  Subsequently, an agreement between the federal government and all provincial governments, except that of Quebec, agreed to Canada's assumption of full responsibility for its own constitution in 1982 (formerly the responsibility of the Parliament of the United Kingdom). The agreement was enacted as the Canada Act by the British Parliament, and was proclaimed into law by Queen Elizabeth II on April 17, 1982. In Canada, this was called the patriation of the Constitution. This action (including the creation of a new Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms) came from an initiative by Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau to create a multicultural and bilingual society in all of Canada. Some Canadians saw Trudeau's actions as an attempt to \\"shove French down their throats\\" (a common phrase at the time). Many Qu√©b√©cois viewed his compromise as a sell-out and useless: Quebec already had a charter enacted in 1975 and was not interested in imposing French on other provinces; rather, it wished to safeguard it inside Quebec. Many Canadians recognize that the province of Quebec is distinct and unique but they do not conclude from this that Quebec merits a position of greater autonomy than the other provinces, which they feel would be the result of granting special powers that are unavailable to the other provinces. The government of Quebec, in line with its policy of the duality of nations, objected to the new Canadian constitutional arrangement of 1982 (the patriation), because its formula for future constitutional amendments failed to give Quebec veto power over all constitutional changes. Some believe that the leaders of Quebec used their refusal to agree to the 1982 constitutional amendment as a bargaining tool to gain leverage in future negotiations, because the federal Canadian government desired (though it is not legally necessary) to include all the provinces willingly into the amended constitution. The National Assembly of Quebec rejected the repatriation unanimously. In spite of Quebec's lack of assent, the constitution still applies within Quebec and to all Quebec residents. Many in Quebec felt that the other provinces' adoption of the amendment without Quebec's assent was a betrayal of the central tenets of federalism. They referred to the decision as the \\"Night of the Long Knives\\". On the other hand, many federalists believe that L√©vesque's goal at the constitutional conference was to sabotage it and prevent any agreement from being reached, so that he could hold it up as another failure of federalism. In this school of thought, patriation without Quebec's consent was the only option. = Constitution Act (1982) =  Constitutional reform and upheaval (1982 onwards)  Since Canada's constitution was patriated without Quebec's consent, later initiatives would seek to ameliorate the constitutional status quo, with varying results. Two formal, and unsuccessful, attempts were made to reform the constitution. A subsequent sovereignty referendum in 1995 ‚Äì only narrowly lost ‚Äì shook Canada to its core, and would bring about the Clarity Act . = Meech Lake Accord (1989) = In 1987, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney attempted to address these concerns and bring the province into an amended constitution. Quebec's provincial government, then controlled by a party that advocated remaining in Canada on certain conditions (the Parti lib√©ral du Qu√©bec), endorsed the accord (called the Meech Lake Accord). Premier Robert Bourassa of Quebec referred to it as the \\"first step\\" towards gaining new powers from the federal government. The accord failed, however, as the legislature in Manitoba deadlocked after Elijah Harper refused consent to speed up the process enough to pass the Accord, and Clyde Wells refused to grant a vote on the Accord in the Newfoundland House of Assembly. In 1990, after the Meech Lake Accord had failed, several Quebec representatives of the ruling Progressive Conservative Party and some members of the Liberal Party of Canada formed the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois, a federal political party intent on defending Quebecers' interests while pursuing independence. = Referendum on Charlottetown Accord (1992) = The federal government, the twelve provincial and territorial governments, and four first peoples' groups then negotiated a second proposed constitutional accord in 1992‚Äîthe Charlottetown Accord. Despite near-unanimous support from the country's political leaders, this second effort at constitutional reform was rejected in a nationwide October 1992 referendum. Only 32 per cent of British Columbians supported the accord, because it was seen there and in other western provinces as blocking their hopes for future constitutional changes, such as Senate reform. In Quebec 57 per cent opposed the accord, seeing it as a step backwards compared to the Meech Lake Accord. In the 1993 federal elections the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois became the official opposition. The following year, the provincial Parti Qu√©b√©cois, also separatist, was elected in Quebec. The two parties' popularity led to a second referendum on independence, the 1995 Quebec referendum. = Referendum on sovereignty (1995) = A referendum held in Quebec on October 30, 1995 resulted in a narrow 50.56%-to-49.44% decision against Quebec sovereignty, with a 93% voter turnout. = Clarity Act (1998) = Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien referred the matter over whether a province could unilaterally secede from the federation to the Supreme Court of Canada in December 1999. In its Quebec Secession Reference decision, the Court ruled that the Canadian constitution did not give provinces the power to unilaterally secede. However, it also ruled that, in the event that a clear majority of the population voted in favour of a clear referendum question on secession, the democratic principles of the constitution required political leaders to respond to that result in good faith. Following the Supreme Court's decision, the federal government introduced legislation known as the Clarity Act which set forth the guidelines for the federal government to recognize any future provincial referendum on secession. The Act set out that, after a such a referendum was held, the Parliament of Canada would determine whether the question was clear and whether a \\"clear majority\\" was attained. The legislation was supported by all members of the House of Commons, except for members of the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois. In response, the Quebec government passed Bill 99, asserting that the Quebec government had the right to submit referendum questions to voters, to determine the referendum question's wording, and to accept a 50%+1 vote as the required winning majority.

The genus was formerly placed in the segregate family Taxodiaceae, it is now included in the monotypic subfamily Taiwanioideae of the family Cupressaceae. It is native to eastern Asia, growing in the mountains of central Taiwan, and locally in southwest China (Guizhou, Hubei, Sichuan, Yunnan, Tibet) and adjoining Myanmar, and northern Vietnam. It is endangered by illegal logging for its valuable wood in many areas. It is very likely that the range was more extensive in the past before extensive felling for the wood. The populations in mainland Asia were treated as a distinct species Taiwania flousiana by some botanists, but the cited differences between these and the Taiwanese population are not consistent when a number of specimens from each area are compared. Morphology It is one of the largest tree species in Asia, reported to heights of up to tall and with a trunk up to diameter above buttressed base.Farjon, A. (2005). Monograph of Cupressaceae and Sciadopitys. Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. The leaves are needle-like or awl-like and long on young trees up to about 100 years old, then gradually becoming more scale- like, long, on mature trees. The cones are small, long, with about 15‚Äì30 thin, fragile scales, each scale with two seeds. History The genus is named after the island of Taiwan, from where it first became known to the botanical community in 1910. The wood is soft, but durable and attractively spicy scented, and was in very high demand in the past, particularly for temple building and coffins.

The agency was officially established in 1961 as the Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA, ), during the rule of President Park Chung- hee's military Supreme Council for National Reconstruction, which displaced the Second Republic of Korea. The original duties of the KCIA were to supervise and coordinate both international and domestic intelligence activities and criminal investigation by all government intelligence agencies, including that of the military. The agency's broad powers allowed it to actively intervene in politics. But despite its controversies it is regarded as one of the most elite intelligence agencies in Asia. Agents go through years of training and checks before they officially become agents and get their first assignments. The agency took on the name Agency for National Security Planning (ANSP, ) in 1981, as part of a series of reforms instituted by the Fifth Republic of Korea under President Chun Doo-hwan. The ANSP is colloquially known as \\"Angibu\\" in South Korea. Besides trying to acquire intelligence on North Korea and suppress South Korean activists, the ANSP, like its predecessor, was heavily involved in activities outside its sphere, including domestic politics and even promoting the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. In 1999, the agency assumed its current name. The advent of democracy in the Sixth Republic of Korea has seen many of the duties and powers of the NIS curtailed, in response to public criticisms about past abuses. Korean Central Intelligence Agency The agency's origins can be traced back to the Korean Counterintelligence Corps (KCIC), formed during the Korean War. The KCIA was founded on June 13, 1961 by Kim Jong-pil, who drew much of the organization's initial 3,000-strong membership from the KCIC. Kim, a Korean Military Academy graduate and nephew of Park Chung-hee by marriage, is also credited for masterminding the 1961 coup d'etat that installed Park before he was elected president of Korea. The intelligence service was extensively used by President Park's government to suppress and disrupt anti-government or pro- North Korean (in which pro-communist was included) movements, including the widespread student protests on university campuses and the activities of overseas Koreans. The KCIA developed a reputation for interfering in domestic politics and international affairs that were beyond its jurisdiction. The KCIA's original charter, Act Concerning Protection of Military Secrets, was designed to oversee the coordination of activities related to counterespionage and national security, but a majority of its activities and budget were devoted to things unrelated to its original charter. In 1968 KCIA agents kidnapped seventeen Koreans living abroad in West Germany. They were transported back to Seoul, where they were tortured and brought up on charges of having violated the National Security Law by engaging in pro-Northern activities. The victims became a cause c√©l√®bre as the kidnapping created a firestorm of international criticism that almost brought the West German government to break off diplomatic relations with South Korea. On the other hand, it is almost certain that West German authorities had been involved in the kidnappings. It further served as a harbinger when the much-publicized kidnapping of a dissident, Kim Dae-jung‚Äîwho would later become the president of Korea and the country's first Nobel Peace Prize recipient in 2000‚Äîtook place in 1973 off the coast of a Japanese resort town. The KCIA's virtually unlimited and completely unchecked power to arrest and detain any person on any charge, created a climate of extreme fear and repression. The frequent detention and torture of students, dissidents, opposition figures, communists, reporters, or anyone perceived to be critical of the government, was symptomatic of the Park presidency and the subsequent administration. In another departure from its original charter, the KCIA's assumptive role as political machine extraordinaire began to take on even more bizarre forms such as exercising a free hand in drafting the South Korean constitution, dominating the country's political life, and acting as a political fundraiser for the incumbent party. In addition to its presumptive intelligence and secret police role, which was ostensibly authorized by its original charter, it also became, by default, through a network of agents at home and abroad, the de facto attorney general and inspector general of the South Korean government. The KCIA is known to have raised funds through extortion and stock market manipulation, which were in turn used to bribe and cajole companies, individuals, and even foreign governments, as did happen during the Koreagate scandal in the United States in 1976. Domestically, the KCIA made itself the philanthropical arm of the government by being an avid supporter of the arts, promoter of tourism, and purveyor of national culture. Investigations by United States Congressman Donald M. Fraser found the KCIA to have funneled bribes and favors through Korean businessman Tongsun Park in an attempt to gain favor and influence in Washington, D.C.; some 115 Members of Congress were implicated in what became known as the Koreagate scandal.JPRI Working Paper No. 20 Agency for National Security Planning In 1979, the agency's director, Kim Jae-kyu, assassinated President Park Chung Hee during a dinner. In the aftermath, the KCIA was purged, with Jae-Kyu and five others being executed, and temporarily lost much of its power. The new director, Chun Doo- hwan, used his tenure from April to July 1980 to expand his power base beyond the military, and the organization was renamed the Agency for National Security Planning in 1981, with its powers redefined in presidential orders and legislation. The ANSP, like its predecessor, was a cabinet-level agency directly accountable to the president, and the director of the ANSP continued to have direct presidential access. In March 1981, the ANSP was redesignated as the principal agency for collecting and processing all intelligence. The requirement for all other agencies with intelligence-gathering and analysis functions in their charters to coordinate their activities with the ANSP was reaffirmed. Legislation passed at the end of 1981 further redefined the ANSP's legally mandated functions to include the collection, compilation, and distribution of foreign and domestic information regarding public safety against communists and plots to overthrow the government. The maintenance of public safety with regard to documents, materials, facilities, and districts designated as secrets of the state was the purview of the ANSP, as was the investigation of crimes of insurrection and foreign aggression, crimes of rebellion, aiding and abetting the enemy, disclosure of military secrets, and crimes provided for in the Act Concerning Protection of Military Secrets and the National Security Act. The investigation of crimes related to duties of intelligence personnel, the supervision of information collection, and the compilation and distribution of information on other agencies' activities designed to maintain public safety also were undertaken by the ANSP. By 1983 the ANSP had rebounded and again was the preeminent foreign and domestic intelligence organization. Nevertheless, the ANSP's domestic powers were indeed curtailed under the Sixth Republic. Prior to the change, the ANSP had free access to all government offices and files. The ANSP, Defense Security Support Command, Office of the Prosecutor General, Korean National Police, and the Ministry of Justice had stationed their agents in the National Assembly of Korea to collect information on the activities of politicians. In May 1988, however, overt ANSP agents, along with agents of other intelligence agencies, were withdrawn from the National Assembly building. The ANSP's budget was not made public, nor apparently was it made available in any useful manner to the National Assembly in closed sessions. In July 1989, pressured by opposition parties and public opinion, the ANSP was subjected to inspection and audit by the National Assembly for the first time in eighteen years, with the ANSP removed its agents from the chambers of the Seoul Criminal Court and the Supreme Court. In another move to limit the potential for the ANSP to engage in \\"intelligence politics,\\" the ANSP Information Coordination Committee was disbanded because of its history of unduly influencing other investigating authorities, such as the Office of the Prosecutor General. Additionally, the ANSP, responding to widespread criticism of its alleged human rights violations, set up a \\"watchdog\\" office to supervise its domestic investigations and to prevent agents from abusing their powers while interrogating suspects. The ANSP remained deeply involved in domestic politics, however, and was not fully prepared to relinquish its power. In April 1990, for example, ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) coleader Kim Young-sam complained that he and members of his faction within the DLP had been subjected to \\"intelligence maneuvering in politics\\" that included wiretapping, surveillance, and financial investigations. Despite an agreement in September 1989 by the chief policymakers of the ruling and opposition parties to strip the ANSP of its power to investigate pro-North Korean activity (a crime under the National Security Act), the ANSP continued enforcing this aspect of the law rather than limiting itself to countering internal and external attempts to overthrow the government. The ANSP continued to pick up radical student and dissident leaders for questioning without explanation. Aside from its controversial internal security mission, the ANSP also was known for its foreign intelligence gathering and analysis and for its investigation of offenses involving external subversion and military secrets. The National Unification Board and the ANSP (and the KCIA before it) were the primary sources of government analysis and policy direction for South Korea's reunification strategy and contacts with North Korea. The intelligence service's pursuit of counterespionage cases was also held in high regard. Fourth ed. Washington: Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress. . Contemporary history In 1994, the ANSP had a significant revision of its charter, which effectively limited its activities, following an agreement between Korea's ruling and opposition parties. As a result, an \\"Information Committee\\" in the National Assembly was established to lay a foundation for the agency's removal from the political scene and an assumption of political neutrality. The ANSP also began to develop procedures and mechanisms to thwart international crime and terrorism. In 1995, the ANSP moved to a new headquarters site in Naegok-dong, southern Seoul, from its previous location on Namsan mountain, in Imun-dong, where it had been located for the past 34 years. Most specifics regarding the agency's organizational makeup remain classified by the Seoul government. A 1998 investigation by the Sisa Journal into the structure of the agency (then the ANSP) estimated that it employed some 60,000 employees across 39 headquarters and regionally-based departments, spending an estimated 700‚Äì800 billion South Korean won per year. In the presidential election held in December 2012, NIS committed a serious crime secretly helping Park Geun-hye's campaign, according to Korean police investigation report. Korean prosecutors are re-investigating this incident which could void the result of last year's presidential election. title=Investigators Raid Agency of Military in South Korea Former NIS chief Won Sei-hoon is awaiting trial on multiple charges including presidential election fraud. In 2015, Hacking Team's breached data showed that NIS purchased spyware from Hacking Team. An agent related to the hack was found dead in an apparent suicide. In his note, he said that the agency didn't spy on civilians or on political reactions related to 2012's presidential election. =National Intelligence Service= In 1999, it was officially renamed the National Intelligence Service. According to its official publications, the NIS is divided into three directorates: International affairs, Domestic affairs, and North Korean affairs. Its current officially stated mission assigns the NIS responsibility for the: > * Collection, coordination, and distribution of information on the nation's > strategy and security. * Maintenance of documents, materials, and facilities > related to the nation's classified information. * Investigation of crimes > affecting national security, such as the Military Secrecy Protection Law, > the National Security Law. * Investigation of crimes related to the missions > of NIS staff. * Planning and coordination of information and > classified.http://www.nis.go.kr/docs/eng/nis/nis_mission.html The election of Roh Moo-hyun to the South Korean presidency in 2003 brought more concerted efforts to reform the agency. Roh appointed Ko Young-koo, a former human rights lawyer, to the position of director, expressing a desire to find \\"someone who will set the agency straight\\". The anti-communist bureau of the agency was slated to be eliminated, and many domestic intelligence and surveillance activities were either abandoned or transferred to national police forces.Cleaning House - TIME In December 2008, it was alleged by the official media-arm of North Korea, the Korean Central News Agency, that a NIS- trained North Korean citizen had been apprehended as part of a plot to assassinate Kim Jong-il, the North Korean leader. Both the NIS and South Korean government have denied any involvement. The NIS officially admitted in 2011 that it wiretapped Gmail accounts of South Korean citizens in the South Korean Constitutional Court. The 2012 budget for the NIS could potentially get cut as it had shown its inefficiencies. In 2016, a prosecutors‚Äô investigation had turned up evidence that the NIS has been effectively orchestrating the activities of conservative groups since the administration of former president Lee Myung-bak (2008‚Äì2013). The evidence shows that the NIS has been involved not only in political advertisements that conservative groups have run in newspapers but also in their plans to hold one-person protests and to hand out pamphlets: \\"An agent surnamed Park who was on the NIS‚Äôs psychological warfare team supported and supervised right-wing conservative organizations and right- wing youth organizations.‚Äùhttp://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/741318.html In 2017, the NIS admitted it conducted an illicit campaign to influence the South Korea‚Äôs 2012 presidential election, mobilising teams of experts in psychological warfare to ensure that the conservative candidate, Park Geun- hye, beat her liberal rival Moon Jae- in.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/04/south-koreas-spy-agency- admits-trying-rig-election-national-intelligence-service-2012 In June 2018 three former NIS directors (Lee Byung-kee, Lee Byung-ho, and Nam Jae-joon) who served in the Park administration were found guilty of bribery, related to the 2016 Park Geun-hye scandals.

A flammagenitus is similar dynamically in some ways to a firestorm, and the two phenomena may occur in conjunction with each other. However, either may occur without the other.  Formation  August 2009 Station fire in southern California A flammagenitus cloud is produced by the intense heating of the air from the surface. The intense heat induces convection, which causes the air mass to rise to a point of stability, usually in the presence of moisture. Phenomena such as volcanic eruptions and forest fires can induce formation of this cloud, by mechanisms similar to those that form homogenitus. The presence of a low-level jet stream can enhance its formation. Condensation of ambient moisture (moisture already present in the atmosphere), as well as moisture evaporated from burnt vegetation or volcanic outgassing (water vapour is a dominant component of volcanic eruptive gases), occurs readily on particles of ash. Wildfire in Yellowstone National Park produces pyrocumulus clouds. Flammageniti contain severe turbulence, manifesting as strong gusts at the surface, which can exacerbate a large conflagration. A large flammagenitus, particularly one associated with a volcanic eruption, may also produce lightning. This is a process not yet fully understood, but is probably in some way associated with charge separation induced by severe turbulence, and, perhaps, by the nature of the particles of ash in the cloud. Large flammagenitus can contain temperatures well below freezing, and the electrostatic properties of any ice that forms may also play a role. A flammagenitus that produces lightning is actually a type of cumulonimbus, a thundercloud, and is called cumulonimbus flammagenitus. The World Meteorological Organization formerly classified flammagenitus and cumulonimbus flammagenitus respectively as cumulus (mediocris or congestus) and cumulonimbus. In 2017, the WMO International Cloud Atlas chose flammagenitus as the formal name of these clouds.  Appearance  Wildfire in Yellowstone National Park produces a flammagenitus cloud. Flammagenitus cloud, above the Oregon Gulch fire in Oregon and California, 2014. Aircraft is an F-15C Eagle. Flammagenitus is often grayish to brown in color, because of the ash and smoke associated with the fire. It also tends to expand because the ash involved in the cloud's formation increases the amount of condensation nuclei. This poses a problem, as the cloud can trigger a thunderstorm, from which the lightning can start another fire. Chimney Fire Nevada flammagenitus cloud  Effects on wildfires  A flammagenitus cloud can help or hinder a fire. Sometimes, the moisture from the air condenses in the cloud and then falls as rain, often extinguishing the fire. There have been numerous examples where a large firestorm has been extinguished by the flammagenitus that it created. However, if the fire is large enough, then the cloud may continue to grow, and become a type of cumulonimbus cloud known as a cumulonimbus flammagenitus, which may produce lightning and start another fire.

Early years John R. Commons was born in Hollansburg, Ohio on October 13, 1862. Commons had a religious upbringing which led him to be an advocate for social justice early in life. Commons was considered a poor student and suffered from a mental illness while studying. He was allowed to graduate without finishing because of the potential seen in his intense determination and curiosity. At this time, Commons became a follower of Henry George's 'single tax' economics.Brue S. and Grant R. (2012).

After appointments at Oberlin and Indiana University, Commons began teaching at Syracuse University in 1895.http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/topics/commons/ In spring 1899, Syracuse dismissed him as a radical.Richard A. Gonce (2002), \\"John R.

Commons' early work exemplified his desire to unite Christian ideals with the emerging social sciences of sociology and economics. He was a frequent contributor to Kingdom magazine, was a founder of the American Institute for Christian Sociology, and authored a book in 1894 called Social Reform and the Church.Hoeveler, \\"John R. Commons,\\" pg. 85. He was an advocate of temperance legislation and was active in the national Prohibition Party. By his Wisconsin years, Commons' scholarship had become less moralistic and more empirical, and he moved away from a religious viewpoint in his ethics and sociology.Gonce, Richard A. ‚ÄúJohn R.

Commons at his desk at the University of Wisconsin in the 1920s. Commons is best known for developing an analysis of collective action by the state and other institutions, which he saw as essential to understanding economics. Commons believed that carefully crafted legislation could create social change; that view led him to be known as a socialist radical and incrementalist. Contrary to some published accounts, Commons did consider African Americans capable of voting. When he advocated proportional representation, he suggested a \\"negro party\\".Commons,John, R. 1900. Representative Democracy. New York: American Bureau of Economic Research, 1900, 20. He even suggested applying the Thirteenth amendment to the Constitution to force Southern States to allow African Americans to vote.Chasse, John Dennis. A Workers' Economist: John R. Commons and His Legacy from Progressivism to the War on Poverty. New York: Transactions Press, pp.120-122. He continued the strong American tradition in institutional economics by such figures as the economist and social theorist Thorstein Veblen. His notion of transaction is one of the most important contribution to Institutional Economics.Nicita A. and M. Vatiero (2007), \\"The Contract and the Market: Towards a Broader Notion of Transaction?\\". Studi e Note di Economia, 1:7‚Äì22. Link The institutional theory was closely related to his remarkable successes in fact-finding and drafting legislation on a wide range of social issues for the state of Wisconsin. He drafted legislation establishing Wisconsin's worker's compensation program, the first of its kind in the United States. In 1934, Commons published Institutional Economics, which laid out his view that institutions were made up of collective actions that, along with conflict of interests, defined the economy. He believed that institutional economics added collective control of individual transactions to existing economic theory.Vatiero, Massimiliano. \\"From W. N. Hohfeld to J. R. Commons, and Beyond? A \\"Law and Economics\\" Enquiry on Jural Relations\\", American Journal of Economics and Sociology, 69(2): 840‚Äì866, 2010. Commons considered the Scottish economist Henry Dunning Macleod to be the \\"originator\\" of Institutional economics. Commons was a contributor to The Pittsburgh Survey, a 1907 sociological investigation of a single American city. His graduate student, John A. Fitch, wrote The Steel Workers, a classic depiction of a key industry in early 20th-century America. It was one of six key texts to come out of the survey. Edwin E. Witte, later known as the \\"father of social security\\" also did his PhD at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison under Commons. He was a leading advocate of proportional representation in the United States, writing a book on the subject in 1907 and serving as vice- president of the Proportional Representation League. Commons undertook two major studies of the history of labor unions in the United States. Beginning in 1910, he edited A Documentary History of American Industrial Society, a large work that preserved many original-source documents of the American labor movement. Almost as soon as that work was complete, Commons began editing History of Labor in the United States, a narrative work which built on the previous 10-volume documentary history. Death and legacy He died on May 11, 1945. Today, Commons's contribution to labor history is considered equal to his contributions to the theory of institutional economics. He also made valuable contributions to the history of economic thought, especially with regard to collective action. He is honored at the University of Wisconsin in Madison with rooms and clubs named for him.The John R. Commons Room on the 8th floor of the Sociology building, and the John R. Commons Club in the Economics department His former home, now known as the John R. Commons House, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/hp/register/viewSummary.asp?refnum=85000572http://landmarkhunter.com/159571-john- commons-house/ Quotes * \\"An institution is defined as collective action in control, liberation and expansion of individual action.\\" ‚Äî\\"Institutional Economics\\" American Economic Review, vol. 21 (December 1931), pp. 648‚Äì657. * \\"...But the smallest unit of the institutional economists is a unit of activity ‚Äî a transaction, with its participants.

Etymology , corrupted Bellanamore, means \\"town at the mouth of the big ford\\", so named because it was a main crossing (ford) of the Yellow River. The gaels called the baile √Åtha na Chuirre (\\"homestead of ford of the afflictions\\") because a hospital-house stood near the bridge in the 13th century. Location Ballinamore is in south county Leitrim, from County Fermanagh, and built on the 'Yellow River'. The R202 regional road intersects the R199 and R204 roads here. A historic barge waterway, built in the 1840s to connect the Erne and Shannon rivers, was reopened for boat traffic in 1994 as the Shannon‚ÄìErne Waterway. Ballinamore has daily Local-link bus services to Carrick on Shannon and Dromod railway station Monday to Saturday. History After the 5th century, the Conmaicne settled this area, displacing and absorbing an older tribe named the \\"Masraigh\\". These Conmha√≠cne ancestors were called the \\"Cenel Luach√°n\\". This is the origins of Ballinamore. In 1244, the town () was named Ath na Chuirre (\\"ford of the afflictions\\") because, according to the Irish Annals, a hospital dedicated to Saint John the Baptist () stood beside the ford. Saint Bridget's church, and holy-well, stood on a high hill one kilometre north of present-day town. In 1256, the Battle of Magh Slecht occurred nearby, leading to the division of Br√©ifne between the O'Rourkes of North Leitrim and the O'Reillys of East Br√©ifne (modern-day County Cavan). In 1621, the name 'Ballinamore' is first mentioned, when under the Plantation of Leitrim, the \\"Manor of Ballinamore\\" was granted to Sir Fenton Parsons with of arable land. Around 1693, Ballinamore Iron works was established, and in production until circa 1747 when the business was put up for sale, the assets including a furnace, forge, slitting mill, mine yards, coal yards, large quantities of pig iron, mine and coals. The native Irish forests bounding the parish were exhausted for this mining. In the 18th century, dispossessed Catholics from County Down settled in the area. In 1860, the Ballinamore and Ballyconnell Canal was opened, but declined in use after 24 October 1887, the date Ballinamore railway station opened. The railway station was part of the narrow gauge Cavan and Leitrim Railway and was the hub of the line, with the locomotive depot and works. It was the point where the line from Dromod through Mohill and Ballinamore to Belturbet branched to Kiltubrid, Drumshanbo and Arigna. The railway line was used until closure on 1 April 1959. In the 19th, and early 20th centuries, annual fairs were held at Ballinamore on- 12 May, and 12 November. In 1925, Ballinamore town comprised 163 houses, approximately 28 being licensed to sell alcohol. In 1994, the Ballinamore and Ballyconnell Canal was reopened as the Shannon‚ÄìErne Waterway and marketed as a tourist/cruising waterway. =Annalistic references= Various Irish Annals mention the baile of Ath na Cuirre, i.e. Ballinamore, in 1244AD. A Connachta army marched from Fenagh, County Leitrim towards the baile, presumably along the R202 route. At the Yellow river ford, today's bridge into main street, the soldiers vandalised the nearby Hospital of Saint John the Baptist, accidentally killing one of their own, a important leader of Clann Murtagh O'Connor named Mhaghnusa mic Muircertaig Muimnigh. > \\". [text: Annals of Lough Ce > https://celt.ucc.ie/published/T100010A/text010.html] Notable features The local Church of Ireland church is the oldest building in Ballinamore in the 1780s from the ruins of the local Roman Catholic Church (St Patrick's) demolished during the reformation and penal laws. The nearby Ballinamore Estate was granted to the Ormsby family in 1677. Elizabethan settlers located at first in County Sligo, from where they spread into Counties Mayo, Roscommon and Galway. The Ballinamore branch were descended from the Ormsby of Comyn or Cummin in County Sligo. There is a monument to the IRA Chief of Staff, TD, and local councillor John Joe McGirl on the bridge crossing the Shannon-Erne Waterway. Sport Ballinamore Se√°n O'Heslin's GAA are the local Gaelic games club. Popular culture Christy Moore released a song called The Ballad of Ballinamore in 1984, giving the writing credits to Fintan Vallely. Later compilations have referred to the song as simply Ballinamore. The song was a parody of an earlier Irish rebel song called The Man from the Daily Mail. It was written after an RT√â investigation in the Ballinamore area for evidence of the abducted racehorse Shergar (believed to be abducted by the Provisional IRA) found several locals refusing to say anything other than \\"no comment\\".

From December 1941 until 5 May 1942, the base was closed whilst a concrete runway was built with two T2 hangars. When it re-opened, it became part of No. 5 Group. In 1942 several squadrons of Avro Lancaster aircraft arrived. In 1943 Bill Reid of 61 Squadron won a Victoria Cross on a mission flown from Syerston. On 17 November 1943 the operational squadrons departed, and the station was used for bomber crew training, led by Captain Robert White. It became known as the Lancaster Finishing School in January 1944. From November 1943 to July 1944 there was also a Bombing and Gunnery Defence Training Flight in attendance with several Wellingtons, Spitfires, Hurricanes, plus a few Martinet tug aircraft, all employed in brushing up the skills of air gunners on air-to-air exercises. The LFS left on 1 April 1945, with No. 49 Squadron arriving from RAF Fulbeck later in the month who only had one operation before leaving to RAF Mepal in September. =Post-war use= On 25 October 1945, the base became part of Transport Command with a Heavy Conversion Unit arriving from RAF Leicester East, which stayed until 5 January 1948 when it moved to RAF Dishforth. Syerston was taken over by Flying Training Command on 1 February 1948 when No.22 Flying School arrived from RAF Ouston which trained pilots for the Fleet Air Arm (FAA). Other nearby airfields used for flying circuits were RAF Newton, RAF Wymeswold and Tollerton airfield (now Nottingham Airport). The training school became No. 2 Flying Training School RAF in 1955. In November 1953, Percival Provosts began being used, being replaced by the (Hunting Percival) Jet Provost in 1959. The flying training school was disbanded on 16 January 1970 when the need for pilots had diminished, and the station lay vacant. Role and operations In January 1975 the Royal Air Force Central Gliding School and 644 Volunteer Gliding Squadron moved to Syerston, and have been there since, with 643 Volunteer Gliding Squadron also being based at Syerston since 10 Oct 1992. This was only meant to be a short term stay. Most of the buildings were demolished in 1997. From 1990 Nottingham University Gliding Club, when affiliated with the Four Counties Gliding Club, used the airfield until 2004, when both moved to RAF Barkston Heath. In 2005, Nottingham University Gliding Club affiliated itself to Cranwell Gliding Club at RAF Cranwell, when Four Counties Gliding Club moved to RAF Wittering.

The briefing was for the pilot to fly over the airfield twice at , flying at a speed of . The Vulcan flew along the main 07/25 runway (now 06/24 due to magnetic shift) then started a roll to starboard and climbed slightly. Very shortly a kink appeared in the starboard mainplane leading edge followed by a stripping of the leading edge of the wing. The starboard wingtip then broke followed by a collapse of the main spar and wing structure. Subsequently, the Vulcan went into a dive and began rolling with the starboard wing on fire and struck the ground at the taxiway of the end of runway 07. Three occupants of a controllers' caravan were killed by debris, a fourth being injured. All the crew of the Vulcan were killed. Proposed causes of the accident have included pilot error, fatigue failure and inadequate maintenance.BBC video 50th Anniversary of Vulcan crash References External links  RAF website * Station history * 643 VGS * 644 VGS * Central Gliding School =Video clips= * Gliding * Glider take off * Vulcan crash in 1958 Royal Air Force stations in Nottinghamshire Airports in England ","title":"RAF Syerston"},{"id":"991564","text":"Ballybunion or BallybunnionPlacenames Database of Ireland () is a coastal town and seaside resort in County Kerry, Ireland, on the Wild Atlantic Way, from the town of Listowel.

The Ladies Beach is to the right and the Men's Beach to the left ‚Äì names given to the fact that both sexes swam on separate beaches on the orders of the local parish priest, who walked it daily ensuring the rule wasn't broken. Further to the left of the Men's beach lies the Long Strand, a 3.2 km stretch of sand, overlooked by the sand dunes of Ballybunion Golf Club. In the summer, Ballybunion attracts tourists, and the beaches near Ballybunion are a common surfing site, with a dedicated surf school on the Men's Beach. Other traditions include seaweed baths, featuring sea water with serrated wrack. The town itself has a number of restaurants, pubs and cafes, and schools. There is also a statue commemorating the golfing visit of Bill Clinton. This was the first statue of Bill Clinton on public display in the world. Sport Ballybunion Golf Club =Golf= Ballybunion Golf Club was founded in 1893 and is home to arguably one of the best links courses in the world.

He is counted among the Seventy Apostles in the tradition of the Eastern Churches. According to the early church historian Eusebius of Caesarea he is said to have been a disciple of the Apostles (auditor apostolorum).Chronicon \\"ad annum Abrahamum 2041\\" (AD 124). __TOC__ In his Ecclesiastical History, Book IV, chapter 3, Eusebius records that: 1\\\\. After Trajan had reigned for nineteen and a half years √Ülius Adrian became his successor in the empire. To him Quadratus addressed a discourse containing an apology for our religion, because certain wicked men had attempted to trouble the Christians. The work is still in the hands of a great many of the brethren, as also in our own, and furnishes clear proofs of the man's understanding and of his apostolic orthodoxy. 2\\\\. He himself reveals the early date at which he lived in the following words: But the works of our Saviour were always present, for they were genuine:‚Äî those that were healed, and those that were raised from the dead, who were seen not only when they were healed and when they were raised, but were also always present; and not merely while the Saviour was on earth, but also after his death, they were alive for quite a while, so that some of them lived even to our day. Such then was Quadratus.Historia Ecclesiastica 4.3.1-2, http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250104.htm In other words, Eusebius is stating that Quadratus addressed a discourse to the Roman Emperor Hadrian containing a defense, or apology, of the Christian religion, when the latter was visiting Athens in AD 124 or 125, which Eusebius states incorrectly moved the emperor to issue a favourable edict. The mention that many of those healed or raised from the dead by Christ were still living seems to be part of an argument that Christ was no mere wonder-worker whose effects were transitory. Eusebius later summarises a letter by Dionysius of Corinth which simply states that Quadratus was appointed Bishop of Athens 'after the martyrdom of Publius', and which states that 'through his zeal they [the Athenian Christians] were brought together again and their faith revived.'Historia Ecclesiastica, 4.23. P. Andriessen has suggested that Quadratus' Apology is the work known as Epistle to Diognetus,Andriessen, \\"The Authorship of the Epistula ad Diognetum,\\" Vigiliae Christianae 1 (1947), pp. 129-36 a suggestion Michael W. Holmes finds \\"intriguing\\". While admitting that Epistle to Diognetus does not contain the only quotation known from Quadratus' address, Holmes defends this identification by noting \\"there is a gap between 7.6 and 7.7 into which it would fit very well.\\"Michael W. Holmes, The Apostolic Fathers in English (Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2006), p. 290 Edgar J. Goodspeed states it is an ingenious theory, but says it is improbable and that the fragment does not fit the gap.Goodspeed, Edgar J. (1966). A History of Early Christian Literature. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. pp. 97\\\\. . Because of the similarity of name, some scholarsFor example, Otto Bardenhewer, Patrology, p. 40 have concluded that Quadratus the Apologist is the same person as Quadratus, a prophet mentioned elsewhere by Eusebius (H. E., 3.37). The evidence, however, is too slight to be convincing. The later references to Quadratus in Jerome and the martyrologies are all based on Eusebius, or are arbitrary enlargements of his account. Another apologist, Aristides, presented a similar work. Eusebius had copies of both essays. Because he was bishop of Athens after Publius, Quadratus is sometimes figured among the Apostolic Fathers. Eusebius called him a \\"man of understanding and of Apostolic faith.\\" and Jerome in Viri illustrissimi intensified the apostolic connection, calling him \\"disciple of the apostles\\".

History During the Bronze Age (2200-600 B.C.), copper was mined on Mount Gabriel, just west of the village. About the same time, stone circles, wedge and boulder tombs were constructed in the area. The Celts arrived at some later time and in the early historic period various clans fought for dominance, until the eventual emergence of the McCarthys and O'Mahonys as the rulers of the region. A string of castles were built along the coastline. Kilcoe Castle was the McCarthy's most westerly stronghold and their only coastal foothold. It has since been renovated and rebuilt by its actor owner Jeremy Irons. In 1602, soldiers led by Sir George Carew, Lord President of Munster, descended on the area in a successful bid to break the power of the Gaelic chieftains. Their passage through West Cork was described in \\"Pacata Hibernia\\" by Thomas Stafford from the invaders point of view. The events were also captured, from a native Irish perspective, in \\"Historicae Catolicae Iberniae Compenium\\" by Philip O'Sullivan Beare. The 17th century saw an influx of settlers mainly from England, as well as a number of Protestants (Huguenots) also fleeing persecution in Catholic France. The Swantons from Norfolk emerged as one of the most prominent families in the locality, and by the late 18th century they had succeeded in changing the name of Ballydehob to Swanton's Town. The last known use of the name Swanton's Town was in the census of 1821. In the 1820s, copper mining developed again in the region. The Cappagh mine was financed by Lord Audley; its 20-metre chimney survived until February 2002, when it was destroyed by a lightning strike. A feature of this mining era was the introduction to Ballydehob of a police constabulary and barracks, approximately 6 years before the first London police force. By the 1840s the population of the area had swelled to nearly 20,000. Then disaster struck when the potato crop failed and the Great Irish Famine resulted (1845-1849). This affected Ballydehob and the whole of West Cork in a most devastating way; thousands died and thousands more emigrated. Between 1841 and 1851 the population of the area fell by 42%, a decline which was much higher than the national average. As of the 2016 census, Ballydehob had a resident population of about 270. In the 1880s amid growing agitation over land reform, the Ballydehob branch of the Irish National Land League hosted a visit by Anna Parnell, sister of Charles Stewart Parnell, to address a public meeting on the subject. This was held in the field where St. Brigit's school now stands, and is commemorated by a plaque. In the 1960s Ballydehob saw an influx of artists, writers and craftspeople, and for a brief period a number of \\"hippy\\" communes were established in the area. One house was decorated with painted flowers, becoming well known as the \\"Flower House\\". In common with other areas of West Cork, Ballydehob is a tourist area, with a number of guest-houses and private holiday homes. The traditional village shops have largely been replaced by a range of eating-places. Festivals Festivals in Ballydehob include the Ballydehob Traditional Music Weekend (an annual traditional music, song, and dance festival), the Ballydehob Jazz Festival, Ballydehob Country Music Festival, Fastnet Maritime and Folk Festival, and West Cork Yoga Festival. The 'Gathering of the Boats', or Cruinniu na mBad, also takes place annually with families meeting the flotilla of working boats and other traditional sailing vessels at Ballydehob Quay. Ballydehob Old Time Threshing & Vintage Weekend celebrates the historic traditions of rural Ireland, and generally takes place over a weekend in October. Railway 12 Arch Bridge On 6 September 1886 Ballydehob railway station opened on the narrow gauge Schull and Skibbereen Railway with a large sports event held in Ballydehob to mark the occasion. At the time there was a 15 m.p.h. speed limit on the railway. The line's 12 arch bridge dominates the Ballydehob estuary. Mounting losses, coal shortages and the arrival of buses and motor cars eventually brought the closure of the line. The final train ran on 27 January 1947 and the station finally closed altogether on 1 June 1953. Ballydehob was the main intermediate station on the railway. People One of the village's most well-known former inhabitants was the wrestler Danno O'Mahony. He won the NWA World Championship from Jim Londos in Boston on 30 June 1935, and was known as the \\"Irish Whip\\" in reference to his throwing technique. He was also a champion hammer thrower. He died in a traffic accident in 1950. One of the village's pubs, \\"The Irish Whip\\", is named after him. In the centre of the village is a bronze statue erected in his honour in 2000. Kay Summersby, who served as chauffeur and personal assistant for General Dwight D. Eisenhower while he was Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force in London, was born at Insh Beg house (about 20km from Ballydehob) in 1908. Actor Jeremy Irons and his wife, actress Sinead Cusack, purchased the 13th century Kilcoe Castle near Ballydehob.

It lies at the head of Bantry Bay, a deep-water gulf extending for to the west. The Beara Peninsula is to the northwest, with Sheep's Head peninsula to the southwest. The focus of the town is a large square, formed partly by infilling of the shallow inner harbour. In former times, this accommodated regular cattle fairs; after modernising as an urban plaza, it now features a weekly market and occasional public functions. Two piers protect the harbour. Bantry is in the Cork South- West D√°il constituency, which elects three members of D√°il √âireann (the national parliament).  History  As with other areas on Ireland's south- west coast, Bantry claims an ancient connection to the sixth-century saint Breand√°n (Naomh Br√©anainn) the Navigator. In Irish lore, Saint Breand√°n was the first person to discover America. To the west of the town is the graveyard marking the site of a 15th-century Franciscan friary, of which nothing remains. In past centuries, Bantry was a base for major pilchard fisheries and was visited by fishing fleets from Spain, France and the Netherlands. It was still a very small town in 1689, when it was described by the Jacobite army officer and future author John Stevens as \\"a miserable poor place, hardly worth the name of a town\\", consisting of \\"seven or eight small houses, and some mean little cottages\\". Wolfe Tone Square in the town commemorates Theobald Wolfe Tone, a leader during the 1798 rebellion. In the lead up to the rebellion, Dublin-born Tone led the republican United Irishmen in what he had hoped would be a local re-run of the recent French Revolution; this was to be achieved with the help of French Republicans in overthrowing British rule. The ill-fated French invasion fleet, known as the French expedition to Ireland, arrived the area in 1796, but its purpose was frustrated by unfavourable winds. For his efforts in preparing the local defences against the French, Richard White, a local landowner, was created Baron Bantry in 1797 by a grateful British administration. A Viscountcy followed in 1800 and in 1816 he became the 1st Earl of Bantry. The mansion and gardens in the Bantry House demesne on the outskirts of the town testify to the family's status. Irish War of Independence commemorative plaque During the Irish War of Independence, the 5th Cork Brigade of the Irish Republican Army was active in Bantry, and some members remained so during the Civil War that followed. Action by British forces included the punitive firebombing of several buildings in the town. The names of those who died between 1920 and 1923 \\"In Defence of the Republic\\" are listed on the wall of the former court house in Wolfe Tone Square. Sheltering the head of the bay is Whiddy Island, site of a large oil terminal, originally owned by Gulf Oil. On 8 January 1979 the oil tanker Betelgeuse exploded, killing all 42 crew members, as well as seven employees at the terminal. The jetty was seriously damaged, but the storage tanks were not affected. Nevertheless, 250 employees at the terminal, one of the largest employers in the region, lost their jobs. There was also significant environmental impact and the local fishing industry was affected. Local interests subsequently initiated mussel-farming in the sheltered waters between Whiddy and the town. In 1986, Gulf Oil surrendered its lease on the site to the Irish government. State investment in the 1990s restored part of the terminal and the Irish Government arranged for oil to be stored there during the First Gulf War in case of disruption to oil supplies; it currently holds one third of the national strategic petroleum reserve. The facility passed from state ownership in 2001 with the proviso that it would remain operational for at least 15 years. It has since been owned and operated by US oil companies Tosco Corporation, ConocoPhillips, Phillips 66 and Zenith Energy Partners. At the time of acquisition by Zenith Energy Partners, the facility employed 30 people and supported up to 100 contractors. It has a storage capacity of more than eight million barrels of crude oil and refined products. The terminal saw a 15% decrease in oil traffic during 2015, according to figures released by the Port of Cork which operates the Bantry Bay port. Bantry made headlines in 2007 when the attempted landing of a cocaine shipment on the nearby coast was foiled, and again in 2017 when a \\"cocaine factory\\" was discovered in the area. A statue of Theobald Wolfe Tone also stands in the town Buildings of note A commemorative plaque, presented to the citizens of Bantry by the Canadian Government for their kindness and compassion to the families of the victims of Air India Flight 182. Bantry House is located west of the town and has been home to the White family since 1739 ‚Äì sometime Earls of Bantry. It contains a number of historic artifacts and paintings and is surrounded by formal gardens. Other landmarks include Bantry Market House, and the Catholic and Church of Ireland parish churches. The public library and Garda (police) station are examples of modern architecture in the town.  Economy  The town is a service centre for a large catchment area, including both the Beara and Sheep's Head peninsulas. Livestock fairs were held in the square in the past. It is no longer a major fishing port, mussel-farming having replaced the traditional trawling. Tourism has been a major part of the economy since the 19th century, exploiting the coastal scenery of the region, and the town contains a number of hotels and guesthouses. There are small-scale local industries, including pharmaceuticals, foodstuffs and building materials. Bantry became a Fairtrade Town in 2006. Bantry hosts two cultural events each summer ‚Äì the West Cork Chamber Music Festival and the West Cork Literary Festival. These feature musicians and writers of international stature, with performances at various venues in the town. Bantry held the Atlantic Challenge International Contest of Seamanship in July 2012, in which 15 nations competed. The inner harbour contains a marina comprising 40 berths and associated facilities, opened in 2017.  Transport  Bantry is accessed by the N71 national secondary road. Scheduled bus services connect the town with Cork city, Killarney, Castletownbere, and some smaller local centres. In the early 20th century, there was a regular steamship service from Bantry to Castletowbere on the Beara Peninsula. The also serving Glengarriff and Adrigole. Improvements to the roads and land transport eventually made this uneconomic. As of the early 21st century, Bantry has been a port of call for smaller cruise liners, which anchor between the town and Whiddy Island. Bantry has its own small privately owned airfield called Bantry Aerodrome, though the nearest large international airport is Cork Airport. Cork Airport is served by direct Bus √âireann buses from Bantry in the summer tourist season. Bantry Town railway station, the western terminus of the Cork, Bandon and South Coast Railway, opened on 22 October 1892, but finally closed on 1 April 1961, and was subsequently demolished.

It is located on the eastern bank of the Hooghly River, a distributary of the Ganges River. It forms part of the Murshidabad district. During the 18th-century, Murshidabad was a prosperous city.https://www.thedailystar.net/op-ed/politics/which-india-claiming-have- been-colonised-119284 It was the capital of the Bengal Subah in the Mughal Empire for seventy years, with a jurisdiction covering modern-day Bangladesh and the Indian states of West Bengal, Bihar and Orissa. It was the seat of the hereditary Nawab of Bengal and the state's treasury, revenue office and judiciary. Bengal was the richest Mughal province. Murshidabad was a cosmopolitan city. Its population peaked at 700,000 in the 1750s. It was home to wealthy banking and merchant families from different parts of the Indian subcontinent and wider Eurasia, including the Jagat Seth and Armenians. European companies, including the British East India Company, the French East India Company, the Dutch East India Company and the Danish East India Company, conducted business and operated factories around the city. Silk was a major product of Murshidabad. The city was also a center of art and culture, including for ivory sculptors, Hindustani classical music and the Murshidabad style of Mughal painting. The city's decline began with the defeat of the last independent Nawab of Bengal Siraj-ud-Daulah at the Battle of Plassey in 1757. The Nawab was demoted to the status of a zamindar known as the Nawab of Murshidabad. The British shifted the treasury, courts and revenue office to Calcutta. In the 19th century, the population was estimated to be 46,000. Murshidabad became a district headquarters of the Bengal Presidency. It was declared as a municipality in 1869. Etymology Murshidabad was named after its founder, Nawab Murshid Quli Khan. Murshid is an Arabic term for a teacher or guide with integrity, sensibility, and maturity. The suffix -abad is derived from the Persian word abad, which referred to a cultivated place.

The Riyaz-us-Salatin credited the initial development of the town to a merchant named Makhsus Khan. The merchant's role is also mentioned in the Ain-i-Akbari. During the 17th-century, the area was well known for sericulture. In 1621, English agents reported that large quantities of silk were available in the area. During the 1660s, it became a pargana of the Mughal administration, with jurisdiction over European companies in Cossimbazar. In the early 18th-century, Murshid Quli Khan, the prime minister of Bengal Subah, had a bitter rivalry with Prince Azim-ush-Shan, the viceroy of Bengal. The latter even attempted to have Khan killed. The Mughal court in Delhi was also rapidly losing authority in much of the subcontinent. Amid the decline of the central government, the Mughal Emperor Farrukhsiyar promoted Khan to the status of a princely Nawab. As Nawab, Khan was given the opportunity to create a princely dynasty as part of the Mughal aristocracy. Murshid Quli Khan shifted the capital of Bengal from Dhaka, which lost its strategic importance after the expulsion of the Arakanese and Portuguese from Chittagong. He founded the city of Murshidabad and named the city after himself. It became the center of political, economic and cultural life in Bengal. The jurisdiction of the Nawab included not only Bengal, but also Bihar and Orissa. Murshidabad was also located centrally in the expanded jurisdiction of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa. The presence of the princely court, the Mughal Army, artisans and multiethnic merchants increased the wealth of Murshidabad. Wealthy families and companies established their head offices in the city. The Murshidabad mint became the largest in Bengal, with a value amounting to two percent of the minted currency. The city witnessed the construction of administrative buildings, gardens, palaces, mosques, temples and mansions. European companies operated factories in the city's outskirts. The city was full of brokers, workers, peons, naibs, wakils, and ordinary traders. Murshid Quli Khan transformed Murshidabad into a capital city with an efficient administrative machinery for his successors. He built a palace and a caravanserai with a grand mosque, known as the Katra Masjid. The main military base was located near the mosque and formed the city's eastern gateway. The third Nawab Shuja-ud-Din Muhammad Khan patronized the construction of another palace and military base, a new gateway, the revenue office, a public audience hall (durbar), a private chamber, the treasury and a mosque in an extensive compound called Farrabagh (Garden of Joy) which included canals, fountains, flowers, and fruit trees. Nawab Siraj-ud-Daulah established a palace near the Motijhil (Pearl Lake). The Nizamat Imambara was built for Shia Muslims. The palace complex was fortified and known as the Nizamat Fort. The main entrances of the Nizamat Fort had musicians' galleries. The gates were high, imposing and tall enough for an elephant to pass through. The Khoshbagh garden was the burial place of the Nawabs. The city had a Bengali majority population, including Bengali Muslims and Bengali Hindus. There was an influential Jain community involved in trade and commerce. An Armenian community also settled and became financiers for the Nawab. The Jagat Seth were one of the prominent banking families of Murshidabad. They controlled money lending activities and served as financiers for administrators, merchants, traders, the Nawabs, the Zamindars, as well as the British, French, Armenians and Dutch. The merchants built many mansions, including the Azimganj Rajbati, Kathgola house and Nashipur house. The Nawabs of Bengal entered into agreements with numerous European trading companies allowing them to establish bases in the region. The French East India Company operated factories in Murshidabad and Dhaka. The British East India Company was based in Fort William. Murshidabad was a part of the Dutch Bengal Department. The Ostend Company of Austria established a base near Murshidabad. The Danish East India Company also set up trading posts in the Bengal Subah. The last independent Nawab Siraj-ud-Daulah was overthrown in 1757. Despite receiving assurances of French support, the Nawab was betrayed by his commander Mir Jafar. The British installed Mir Jafar's family as a puppet dynasty and eventually reduced the Nawab to the status of a landlord (zamindar). The British continued to collect revenue from the area's factories. The merchant families continued to prosper under company rule in India. In 1858, the British government gained direct control of India's administration. Murshidabad was a district town of the Bengal Presidency. Warren Hastings removed the supreme civil and criminal courts to Calcutta in 1772, but in 1775 the latter courts were brought back to Murshidabad again. In 1790, under Lord Cornwallis, the entire revenue and judicial staffs were moved to Calcutta. The town was still the residence of the Nawab, who ranked as the first nobleman of the province with the style of Nawab Bahadur of Murshidabad, instead of Nawab Nazim of Bengal. The Hazarduari Palace was built in 1837 as a residence for both the Nawab and British civil servants. Murshidabad became a municipality in 1869. The population in 1901 was 15,168. The silk industry was revived with assistance from the government. The area also became notable for mango and litchi production.

Geography The District of Murshidabad has an area of . It is divided into two nearly equal portions by the Bhagirathi, the ancient channel of the Ganges. The tract to the west, known as the Rarh, consists of hard clay and nodular limestone. The general level is high, but interspersed with marshes and seamed by hill torrents. The Bagri or eastern half belongs to alluvial plains of eastern Bengal. There are few permanent swamps; but the whole country is low-lying, and liable to annual inundation. In the north-west are a few small detached hillocks, said to be of basaltic formation. Economy Murshidabad District has several terracotta Bengali Hindu temples The city today is a center for agriculture, handicrafts and sericulture. The famous Murshidabad Silk, much in demand for making saris and scarves, is produced here. Demographics As of 2011 Indian Census, Murshidabad had a total population of 44,019, of which 22,177 were males and 21,842 were females. Population within the age group of 0 to 6 years was 4,414. The total number of literates in Murshidabad was 32,451, which constituted 73.7% of the population with male literacy of 77.3% and female literacy of 70.1%. The effective literacy rate of 7+ population of Murshidabad was 81.9%, of which male literacy rate was 86.0% and female literacy rate was 77.9%. The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes population was 13,762 and 302 respectively. Murshidabad had 9829 households in 2011.

Hazarduari Palace is located in the campus of Kila Nizamat of Murshidabad. It was built in the nineteenth century by architect Duncan Macleod, under the reign of Nawab Nazim Humayun Jah of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa (1824‚Äì1838). The foundation stone of the palace was laid on 9 August 1829, and that very day the construction work was started. William Cavendish was the then Governor-General. Now, Hazarduari Palace is the most conspicuous building in Murshidabad. In 1985, the palace was handed over to the Archaeological Survey of India for better preservation. The present Nizamat Imambara was built in 1847 AD by Nawab Nazim Mansoor Ali Khan Feradun Jah, who succeeded his father Nawab Nazim Humayun Jah in Murshidabad, India. It was built after the fires of 1842 and 1846 which burnt the wooden Imambara built by Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah. This Imambara is the largest one in India and Bengal. The Katra Masjid (also known as Katra Mosque) is a mosque and the tomb of Nawab Murshid Quli Khan built between 1723 and 1724. It is located in the north eastern side of the city. Its importance lies not only as a great centre of Islamic learning but also for the tomb of Murshid Quli Khan, who is buried under the entrance staircase. The most striking feature is the two large corner towers having loopholes for musketry. At present it is maintained and protected by the Archaeological Survey of India and the Government of West Bengal. Bacchawali Tope is a gun, rather cannon which lies in the Nizamat Fort Campus on the garden space between the Nizamat Imambara and the Hazarduari Palace and to the east of the old Madina Mosque. The cannon consists two pieces of different diameters. The cannon was made between the 12th and 14th century, probably by the Mohammeddan rulers of Gaur. It originally lied on the sand banks of Ichaganj. However, it is unknown that how it came in Ichaganj. It was used to protect the city of Murshidabad from north-western attacks. After the 1846 fire of the Nizamat Imambara the Imambara was rebuilt, then after the completion of the new Imambara the cannon was shifted to its present site by Sadeq Ali Khan, the architect of the sacred Nizamat Imambara under the suggestion of Sir Henry Torrens, the then agent of the Governor General at Murshidabad.

It was a key part of the Mineral Revolution. Origins There had always been rumours of a modern-day \\"El Dorado‚Äô in the folklore of the native tribes that roamed the plains of the South African highveld and in that of the gold miners who had come from all over the world to seek out their fortunes on the alluvial mines of Barberton and Pilgrim's Rest, in what is now known as the province of Mpumalanga. But it was not until 1886 that the massive wealth of the Witwatersrand would be uncovered. Scientific studies have pointed to the fact that the \\"Golden Arc\\" which stretches from Johannesburg to Welkom was once a massive inland lake, and that silt and gold deposits from alluvial gold settled in the area to form the gold-rich deposits that South Africa is famous for. Discovery George Harrison Park The first discovery of gold in the region is recorded as being in 1852 in the Pardekraal farmhttps://www.wits.ac.za/media/migration/files/EGRI%20274.pdf by J.H. Davis, an English miner. He sold ¬£600 of gold to the Transvaal Treasury and was subsequently ordered to leave the country. Another find by Pieter Jacob Marais was recorded in 1853 on the Jukskei River, but was subject to similar secrecy. Though there were smaller mining operations in the region, it wasn‚Äôt until 1884 and the subsequent 1886 discovery at Langlaagte that the Witwatersrand gold rush got under way in earnest. Explorer and prospector (1840-1914) was the first and original discoverer of a Witwatersrand gold reef in June 1884 having prospected the area since the early 1880s, as well as co-operating the Kromdraai Gold Mine in 1883 to the NW of present-day Johannesburg together with his partner Johannes Stephanus Minnaar in an area known today as \\"The Cradle of Humankind\\". However, these were minor reefs, and today the general consensus falsely holds that credit for the discovery of the main gold reef must be attributed to George Harrison, whose findings on the farm Langlaagte were made in July 1886, either through accident or systematic prospecting. This at the time was a British attempt to give credit for the discovery to the Anglo sector in an attempt to justify claiming the Witwatersrand fields as British. This move was one of the factors leading to the Anglo Boer War of 1899-1902. Harrison declared his claim with the then-government of the Suid Afrikaanse Republiek (ZAR), and the area was pronounced open. His discovery is recorded in history with a monument where the original gold outcrop is believed to be located, and a park named in his honour. Harrison is believed to have sold his claim for less than 10 Pounds before leaving the area. News of gold spread rapidly and reached Cecil Rhodes in Kimberley. Rhodes and his partner Robinson with a team of companions were curious and rode over 400 km to Bantjes' camp at Vogelstruisfontein and stayed with him for two nights near what would later become Roodepoort. Rhodes purchased the first batch of Witwatersrand gold from Bantjes for ¬£3000. This purchase would be the first transaction of the newly formed company Consolidated Gold Fields of South Africa. The world's largest gold rush ever had begun and South Africa would never be the same. News spread around the world and prospectors from Australia to California began arriving in masses and the first lanterns of a soon to be Johannesburg began flickering along dusty streets. For a number of years all went well, but then President Paul Kruger of the South African Republic (ZAR) began getting worried so many foreigners would soon outnumber the Boers, and the first of certain \\"measures\\" were put into place. Bantjes, whose father Jan Gerritze Bantjes had educated Kruger when he was a boy during the Great Trek, had discussions with Kruger regarding those \\"measures.\\" One of them was to place heavy taxes on the sale of dynamite to the foreigners so as to slow the momentum. This only agitated the miners and gave the British another reason to make a grab for the gold fields and take the lot for themselves. The disastrous Jameson Raid followed which put Cecil Rhodes in the spotlight. The Jameson Raid was supported by Rhodes and led by Sir Leander Starr Jameson. Its intent was to overthrow the Transvaal government and turn the region into a British colony. There were 500 men who took part in the uprising; 21 were killed and many arrested, tried and sentenced. Founding of Johannesburg It did not take long for fortune-seekers from all over the world to flock to the area, and soon what was a dusty mining village known as Ferreira's Camp was formalised into a settlement. Initially, the ZAR did not believe that the gold would last for long, and mapped out a small triangular piece of land to cram as many plots onto as possible. This is the reason why Johannesburg's central business district streets are so narrow. There is some dispute as to the origin of the name Johannesburg and to which Johannes, a common Dutch name, the city was named after. It is thought to be named after two state surveyors who were sent to choose an area for the layout of the new town, Johann Rissik and Christiaan Johannes Joubert. Within 10 years, the town was already the largest in South Africa, outstripping the growth of Cape Town, which was more than 200 years older. The gold rush saw massive development of Johannesburg and the Witwatersrand, and the area remains the prime metropolitan area of South Africa. One consequence of the gold rush was the construction of the first railway lines in this part of Africa. As a result of the rapid development of the goldfields on the Witwatersrand in the 1880s and the demand for coal by the growing industry, a concession was granted by the ZAR government to the Netherlands-South African Railway Company (NZASM) on July 20, 1888, to construct a railway line from Johannesburg to Boksburg. The line was opened on March 17, 1890 with the first train being hauled by a 14 Tonner locomotive, became known as the \\"Randtram\\", even though it was actually a railway in every aspect and not singularly dedicated to tram traffic. This was the first working railway line in the Transvaal.The South African Railways - Historical Survey (Editor George Hart, Publisher Bill Hart, Sponsored by Dorbyl Ltd, Circa 1978)A South African Railway History The discovery of gold on the Witwatersrand also created a super wealthy class of miners and industrialists known as Randlords. Many Randlords built large estates and mansions on the Parktown Ridge. Second Boer War The Witwatersrand Gold Rush was a major contributing factor of the failed Jameson Raid of 1895 to 1896, and of the outbreak of the Second Boer War in 1899. Boer resentment over the large number of foreigners (Uitlanders) in the Witwatersrand led to heavy taxes and the denial of voting rights for the gold miners, and in response the Uitlanders and the British owners of the mines began to pressure the overthrow of the Boer government.

It is located at the southern end of the county where the N3 from Dublin ends and the N15 crosses the River Erne. Incorporated in 1613, it is one of the oldest towns in Ireland. Location Ballyshannon, which means \\"the mouth of Seannach's ford\\", after a fifth-century warrior, Seannach, who was slain there, lies at the mouth of the river Erne. Just west of the town, the Erne widens and its waters meander over a long sandy estuary. The northern bank of the river rises steeply away from the riverbank, while the southern bank is flat with a small cliff that runs parallel to the river. From its idyllic setting, the town looks out over the estuary and has panoramic views of mountains, lakes and forests. History Archaeological sites dating as far back as the Neolithic period (4000 BC ‚Äì 2500 BC) have been excavated in Ballyshannon and surrounding areas, representing settlement and ritual activity from early periods of human settlement. Finds have ranged from fulachta fiadh (burnt mounds) dating from the Bronze Age (2500‚Äì500 BC), to a possible brushwood trackway thought to date to an earlier Neolithic period, to the recent discovery of a previously unknown medieval church and cemetery containing hundreds of skeletons thought to date from between 1100 and 1400. This site yielded numerous artefacts including silver long cross pennies and halfpennies dating from the reign of Henry III (1251‚Äì1276) and Edward I (c. 1280‚Äì1302). Other finds included bone beads, shroud pins, and pieces of quartz which were found placed in the hands of many of the skeletons. Numerous other sites from various periods are thought to exist, including a neolithic tomb, and the grave of Aed Ruad, High King of Ireland, upon which St. Anne's church (Church of Ireland) was supposedly built, occupying the highest of the town's vantage points‚ÄîMullgoose. Nothing remains to mark either tomb, the last vestige of the mound on Mullaghnashee having been obliterated in 1798 when a fort was constructed on the hill-top. The 18th-century churchyard and the paupers' burial ground were both referred to as Sidh Aedh Ruaidh, the Fairy Mound of Red Hugh. The 'sheeman' (Anglicisation of the Irish sidh) in Mullgoose means 'fairies'. Popular belief assigned the interior of hills to fairies' dwelling places and local tradition has handed down accounts of the exploits of the fairy folk, especially among the Finner sand-hills and in the Wardtown district of Ballyshannon. The Vikings, according to the Annals of Ulster, attacked nearby Inishmurray Island in 795. Later they used the River Erne to attack inland, burning Devenish Island Monastery in 822. The Annals also record that in 836, all the churches of Loch Erne, together with Cluain Eois (Clones) and Daimhinis (Devenish Island) were destroyed by the \\"gentiles\\". In 923 and 916 respectively, \\"a fleet of foreigners on Loch Erne plundered the islands of the lake\\", as well as the surrounding territories. In March 1613, Ballyshannon was incorporated as a borough by James I. In 1775 the salmon-leap of Assaroe at Ballyshannon was praised by the traveller Richard Twiss in A Tour in Ireland (p. 157): > The Giants Causeway is an object which is scarcely worthy of going so far to > see; however that is to be determined by the degree of curiosity of which > the traveller is possessed. But the salmon-leap at Ballyshannon is a scene > of such a singular nature, as is not to be found elsewhere, and is as > peculiar to Ireland as the bullfights are to Spain..... It was in Ballyshannon, around 1793, that Viscount Castlereagh, the future Chief Secretary for Ireland and, later, British Foreign Secretary, had his famous vision of the radiant boy. Known at the time as The Hon. Robert Stewart (he became Lord Castlereagh in 1796), he was serving as a young Army officer and M.P. for Down in the Irish Parliament at the time. Lodging in the old Military Barracks in the town, Stewart (as he then was) retired for the night. Looking into the fire he saw the form of a boy emerge from the flames, grow larger and larger and vanish.Hyde, Montgomery The Strange Death of Lord Castlereagh William Heinemann 1959 pp.161‚Äì2 The radiant boy is a well-known figure in English and Irish folklore, and is often supposed to foretell death. William Allingham later wrote a poem about the incident.Hyde, p.162 The Enniskillen and Bundoran Railway (E&BR;) opened in 1868 and had a station at Ballyshannon. The Great Northern Railway (GNR) operated the E&BR; line from 1876 and absorbed the company in 1896.Hajducki, op. cit., page xiii The partition of Ireland in 1922 turned the boundary with County Fermanagh into an international frontier. Henceforth Ballyshannon's only railway link with the rest of the Irish Free State was via Northern Ireland, and as such was subject to delays for customs inspections. The Government of Northern Ireland closed much of the GNR network on its side of the border in 1957, including the E&BR; as far as the border.Hajducki, op. cit., map 39 This gave the Republic no practical alternative but to allow the closure of the line through Ballyshannon between the border and Bundoran. Thereafter the nearest railheads for Ballyshannon were in the Republic and Omagh in Northern Ireland, until in 1965 the Ulster Transport Authority closed the line through Omagh as well.McCutcheon, 1970, pages 155, 209 River Erne and Ballyshannon A hydroelectric power station was built in the town in the 1950s. The project, or 'Scheme' as it was then referred to, brought engineers, electricians, and specialists in hydroelectricity from many parts of the country and abroad to the town, which experienced a boom during the decade-long construction period. The scheme involved building a dam upriver from the town and digging out a deep channel or tailrace to lower the riverbed through the town to increase the head of water at the dam to drive the turbines. The new plant was named Cathaleen's Fall hydroelectric power station. Before the station was built, the river was wide, and the water level much higher than it is today. A long bridge spanned from the northern shore to the 'port' on the southern bank. The waters spilled over a number of waterfalls, among them Assaroe Falls, before meandering out to sea. Today, however, the river runs through a narrow channel, far below the level of either bank and a narrower single arch bridge has replaced the old one. The newly built Ballyshannon ‚Äì Bundoran bypass has added a new, more modern bridge over the river. A pedestrian bridge was also constructed to mark the millennium. During the Second World War the British and Irish governments quietly reached an agreement to create an air corridor between nearby Belleek and Ballyshannon, the \\"Donegal Corridor\\", which was used by British Royal Air Force flights from Northern Ireland into the Atlantic Ocean. This was used by the aircraft which located the German battleship Bismarck.

On the Against the Grain (1990) album, he changed his name to Peter Finestone. (born June 11, 1964) was the second drummer of the punk rock band Bad Religion. He played in the band in 1981-1982 and again from 1984 to 1991. Pete attended Chaminade College Preparatory Middle School, but was expelled in the middle of his 8th grade year. He then attended Taft High School, where he met the rest of Bad Religion. Pete recorded some of the tracks on Bad Religion's 1982 debut How Could Hell Be Any Worse?. After the release of that album, he departed, then returned two years later to record the EP Back to the Known (1985). When Bad Religion brought the How Could Hell Be Any Worse? line-up back together in 1986, Pete recorded the band's first three reunion albums, Suffer (1988), No Control (1989) and Against the Grain (1990), which are widely considered to be among Bad Religion's most important works. Pete left Bad Religion again in the spring of 1991, due to his role in drumming for The Fishermen and to raise his family. It seems to have been an amicable departure, as he was thanked in the booklet of the Generator album, which would be Bad Religion's first release with Pete's replacement Bobby Schayer. In a 2003 show in Las Vegas, Finestone reunited with Bad Religion to play the drums for \\"Fuck Armageddon...This Is Hell\\" with the band live on stage. Pete is from the San Fernando Valley town of Northridge, roughly 20 miles north of Los Angeles, where Bad Religion is centered, and makes a living building workout machines at a local business. He was a former music student of original Circle Jerks drummer Lucky Lehrer and is featured in Bad Religion's 1989 European tour documentary Along the Way. Pete is still drumming today and is rumoured to be playing in several bands including Black On Sunshine and Jackass as well as doing studio work and film scoring. There's even a Peter Finestone tribute page in honour of his drumming talents. Pete also composed music for the recent film score, The Still Life released in 2006 with Dave \\"The Snake\\" Sabo, Skid Row; Adrian Young, No Doubt; Dizzy Reed, Guns N' Roses; Darius Rucker, Hootie and the Blowfish; Delaney Bramlett, Bonnie and Delaney and Friends; Eddie Hedges, Blessid Union of Souls; Dean Dinning, Toad the Wet Sprocket; Louise Post, Veruca Salt and Sonny Mone, Crazy Horse.

History and name The town sprang up within the townland of Moneybeg, or Muine Bheag in Irish (meaning \\"small thicket\\"). In the 18th century there was a small hamlet there. Walter Bagenal decided to build a town on the site, named \\"New Versailles\\" and modelled after Versailles in France.Mayse, Shirley. Our Caswell Relatives. University of Wisconsin, 1975. p.343 However, shortly after the building began the coach route from Dublin was changed so that coaches now crossed the River Barrow at Leighlinbridge instead. Bagenal abandoned his plans, having built only a courthouse. It wasn't until the arrival of the railway in 1846 that the settlement began to grow into a town. In 1911 the town became the first in Ireland to install dual language street signs, which remain in place today. In the aftermath of Ireland's independence in 1920, the town commissioners chose to drop the English name \\"Bagenalstown\\" in favour of the Irish Muine Bheag. The decision proved an ineffective one, and \\"Bagenalstown\\" remains in common use among locals. In a 1975 plebiscite 77% of residents polled voted to change the name back, but the proposal failed due to insufficient voter turnout. The motto on the town's coat of arms is \\"The Irrepressible Number\\" and its Irish equivalent Uimhir Gan Choisc. Places of interest Near Muine Bheag is Ballyloughan Castle, which comprises a twin-towered gatehouse and the hall and foundations of one of the corner towers of a large castle dating from about 1300. Ballymoon Castle is 3 km (2 mi) east of Muine Bheag, and is thought to date from the 13th century. Community groups The 1st Bagenalstown BP Scout Group was set up in 2009 and meets in the McGrath hall. Their activities include hiking, camping, kayaking and games.http://www.bagenalstownparish.ie/2011/03/tuesday-march-29-2011/ Muine Bheag hosts a floral festival every August. Sport Muine Bheag is the local GAA club, formed in 2018 after the amalgamation of three former clubs. Muine Bheag has had a long tradition in cricket. The Bagenalstown Cricket Club was first formed in 1843 by the local millers, and is still in use. The club's logo is a grinding wheel, which was used in early milling. There is a swimming pool on the approach road to the town from Leighlinbridge. The racehorse Danoli, described in 1995 as \\"the most popular racehorse in Ireland\\" was trained near the town by Thomas Foley. Education Muine Bheag has three primary schools and two secondary schools. *Queen of the Universe National School, founded by Bishop Keogh in 1957, is a primary school in Muine Bheag for boys (junior infants to 1st class) and girls. *St Brigid's National School, founded in 1865, is a primary school in Muine Bheag for boys only from classes 2nd to 6th. *St Mary's National School is a co-educational school under Church of Ireland patronage, based in Muine Bheag. *Presentation De La Salle College is a secondary school in Muine Bheag established in 1983.

The town is located on the N15 road near Ballyshannon, and is the most southerly town in Donegal. The town is a popular seaside resort, and tourism has been at the heart of the local economy since the 18th century.Discover Bundoran - Tourist Information from Ireland's Capital of Fun! Bundoran is a world-renowned surfing area and was listed by National Geographic magazine in 2012 as one of the World's Top 20 Surf Towns.World's Best Surf Towns - National Geographic History =Origins= Bundoran, or Bun Dobhr√°in in Irish (which means the foot of the little water) was, up until over a century ago, two separate villages. Bundoran was the village west of the bridge over the River Bradoge. This area is now called the West End. East of the bridge, about away, was the village of Single Street. In between these two separate communities was the townland of Drumacrin. The area of Drumcacrin is now part of what is today's town centre. Single Street was where most of the local population lived. It was only after completion of the Enniskillen and Bundoran Railway in 1868, which opened a terminus that it called Bundoran, that the two distinct communities developed and merged to what are today called Bundoran. The first official record of Bundoran is in a deposition by Hugh Gaskein on 16 May 1653. He was a witness to events during the 1641 Rebellion when he was an apprentice butcher in Sligo. In 1689 a skirmish was fought near Bundoran between a Jacobite force under Sir Connell Ferrall and the retreating Protestant garrison of Sligo. William Cole, Viscount Enniskillen, built Bundoran Lodge, his summer home, in 1777. This building still stands on Bayview Avenue and is now called Homefield House. The Viscount seems to have started a trend amongst his contemporaries as more of them discovered Bundoran and visited it to enjoy the seaside and what were believed to be its health benefits. =Public rights of way= The rights of the people to have access to the seashore were blocked by a local landlord but the locals found a champion in the parish priest Canon Kelaghan who fought through the courts in 1870 to ensure that the pathways and roads to the beach remained open to the public. Canon Kelaghan also had the present Catholic church built in 1859.Bundoran Public Right of Way (1870). Dublin: Mc Glaghan and Magill =The railway= The opening of the Enniskillen and Bundoran Railway (E&BR;) in 1868 connected Bundoran railway station with Ireland's growing railway network and made the town more accessible from Belfast, Dublin and other population centres on the east and north-east coasts of Ireland. The Great Northern Railway (GNR) operated the E&BR; line from 1876 and absorbed the company in 1896.Hajducki, op. cit., page xiii In this period Bundoran emerged as one of Ireland's most popular seaside resorts. By the end of the 19th century it had become one of the main seaside resorts in Ulster. Hotels and lodging houses were opened around the town and the GNR built the Great Northern Hotel, one of Bundoran's best-known landmarks. Rougey Cliff Walk. During The Emergency of 1939‚Äì45 the GNR introduced the Bundoran Express that linked Dublin and Bundoran via and Enniskillen. It also carried pilgrims to and from Pettigo, which was the nearest station for Lough Derg in County Donegal. There were also through trains between Bundoran and Belfast.McCutcheon, 1970, page 115 The partition of Ireland in 1922 turned the boundary with County Fermanagh into an international frontier. Henceforth Bundoran's only railway link with the rest of the Irish Free State was via Northern Ireland, and as such was subject to delays for customs inspections. The Government of Northern Ireland closed much of the GNR network on its side of the border in 1957, including the E&BR; as far as the border.Hajducki, op. cit., map 39McCutcheon, 1970, pages 153, 207 This gave the Republic no practical alternative but to allow the closure of the line between the border and Bundoran. Thereafter the nearest railheads for Bundoran were in the Republic and Omagh in Northern Ireland, until in 1965 the Ulster Transport Authority closed the line through Omagh as well.McCutcheon, 1970, pages 155, 209 Today, the closest railway stations to Bundoran are Sligo Mac Diarmada Station in Sligo Town and Waterside Station in Derry. =Bundoran beach= The natural swimming pool. A row of colorful B&Bs; on the seafront For almost two centuries people have flocked to Bundoran beach on hot summer days. The tradition of bathing boxes began in Victorian times. They were primarily used by members of the gentry, who were reticent about undressing in public. The boxes were pushed, on wheels, to the water's edge and the customer entered the box through one door, put on their bathing costume and stepped out another door to enter the sea. The box remained there until the bather was finished, dried off and fully clothed again. The bathing box was brought back to its original position on the beach, ready for the next client. Stationary bathing boxes were introduced in the early 1900s. They proved more amenable and cheaper to the public. In the 1920s, Mrs Elizabeth Travers and her brother-in- law, Bilshie Travers (uncle of the famous Bilshie Travers, former Mayor of Bundoran) hired the boxes from the local Council. For 3 old pennies a customer hired a bathing costume and for 6 old pennies they could hire \\"the whole package\\" which consisted of a bathing cap, costume and towel. The bathing costume was washed in a bucket and hung up to dry until the next customer came along. A familiar sight on the beach in the 1950s and 1960s was \\"The Duck\\". This was a former British Army amphibious craft that ferried tourists out onto the Bay. It was operated by the Rooney family. Despite being prone to breakdown, it was a major attraction at the time.Geagan, M.(2011) Dancing by the sea: A journey through time in the Bundoran area. Bundoran: Stracomer Press =Coastal walks= The Promenade to Tullan Strand Starting at Bundoran Bridge and looking out towards the sea is Cladach Leathan (the broad beach) on which lies Bill Ireland's Stone, named after the rescue of a shipwrecked sailor. Beyond it is the surf break of The Peak. At the end of the Promenade is Carraig na n√âan (the rock of the birds). The pump house that overlooks the bay was built by local landlords the Hamiltons in 1861. Close by is Carraig a Choisc√©im (the rock of the step). Next to it is Poll Uain (Lambs' Hole) which is also known as the Horse Pool. The Thrupenny Pool was named after the price of admission (3d. in pre-decimal currency). The main beach is called Tr√° na Draina (the strand of the strong) where according to legend the giant Culina wrestled with his son, both unaware of each other's identity. The small stream that enters the sea on the beach is Sruth√°n na C√∫il Fhinne (the rivulet of the fair girl). The coral and brachiopod fossils embedded in the rocks of Rougey are over 300 million years old. At the tip of Rougey is Aughrus (the peninsula of the steeds), where the warhorses of Conall Gulb√°n and the O‚ÄòDonnells grazed. Passing by the golf links is P√≥l Uaine and P√≥l T√≥b√≠, both fishing spots. Next is the ‚ÄòPuffing Hole‚Äô. Below is Tullan Strand, where the first inhabitants of the area used flint from the rocks to make tools. =\\"Beautiful Bundoran\\"= Bundoran strand at dusk. The song \\"Beautiful Bundoran\\" was very popular all over Ireland in the 1950s, and it was performed by Sin√©ad O'Connor in the film The Butcher Boy. =Central Hotel fire= On 8 August 1980, a fire broke out at The Central Hotel in the heart of the town. Ten people died as a result, including five children. In September 2008, the Church reinstalled a stained glass window made by the world-renowned Harry Clarke (1889‚Äì1931), a window which for many years was lying hidden in the parish house of the local Catholic church. The council also erected a carved stone monument bench on Central Lane (beside The Central Hotel) in August 2010 as a mark of respect listing the names of the ten people who lost their lives. =Brennan's Criterion Bar= Brennan's Criterion Bar opened in the area in 1900 and shut down in 2018. Transport =Roads= The opening in April 2006 of the Bundoran/Ballyshannon bypass has made the resort more accessible. Sligo is south from Bundoran along the scenic Atlantic coast. The Drowes River, where the southern part of the bypass commences and which separates County Leitrim from County Donegal, is also the demarcation point between the provinces of Connacht to the south and Ulster to the north. =Rail= Bundoran Railway Station opened on 13 June 1866, but finally closed on 1 October 1957. The New Council Offices carpark is where the Bundoran Railway Station once stood. The nearest railway station is Sligo Mac Diarmada Station in Sligo Town, where trains run to Dublin Connolly and are operated by Iarnr√≥d √âireann. Buses from Bundoran to Sligo stop at Sligo bus station which is adjacent to Sligo Mac Diarmada Station. =Coach/bus transport= Christ Church, Church of Ireland in Bundoran. Bus √âireann buses connect Bundoran to Sligo Mac Diarmada Station in Sligo Town. Bus √âireann also run a regular service, several times a day, from Derry to Galway, via Letterkenny and Bundoran. Feda O'Donnell runs private buses to Sligo from Bundoran as well. It also offers routes to and from Gweedore via Letterkenny, Donegal Town, Ballyshannon and Bundoran to the west of Ireland, including Sligo and Galway. There is also a regular bus service from Bundoran to Enniskillen. There are a number of bus stops in the town, though the main ones are the East bus stop and West bus stop. Developments Bundoran has seen much development over the past decade, due to its popularity as a seaside destination and the availability of tax reliefs for the development of holiday homes. Thousands of music fans attend the Bundoran Sea Sessions Surf and Music Festival every June.Sea Sessions Surf & Music Festival, Bundoran, Donegal, Ireland The Astoria Ballroom was built in 1953 at a time when dances were a major social activity, and showbands would entertain large crowds at the venue. Under the ownership of Brian McEniff, the venue had a number of facelifts and name changes and remained a landmark building. However, on 29 November 2008, it was destroyed by fire. It took the fire brigades of Bundoran, Ballyshannon and Belleek over nine hours to extinguish. Two Bundoran firemen sustained burns from the blaze. Education On Railway Road stands the St Louis School, which was built in 1892. The buildings included a School and residence for the Sisters of St Louis. One of the buildings still stands today. Around the same time, the Sisters of St Louis had their secondary school beside the Old Grand Central Cinema in the premises known as The Sea View Hotel. The St Joseph's orphanages were erected from funds bequeathed by the late Miss Sarah Crudden, Newtownbutler. These buildings later became known as Ard Lughaidh, much of the building was stone and also had a large sports and theatre hall all of which in 2006 the VEC demolished them for no reason. All that is left on the lands is the extension area used till the 1980s by 'live in' students of the Ard Lughaidh, however, this is now under the Donegal Adventure Centre ownership. Due to the decreasing class sizes in Ard Lughaigh in the 1990s the school faced closure and some students moved to Ballyshannon. Some of the St. Louis nuns moved to the St. Louis building at Railway Road, however, a lot moved away. Sport Bundoran Golf Club Tullan Strand =Surfing= In recent times Bundoran has become noted as a surfing location \\"Emerald Swell: Riding the Frigid Waves of a Raging Sea\\", New York Times, 27 March 2008 thanks to the local coastline having good waves. Popular locations include The Peak, Tullan Strand and nearby Rossnowlagh beach. =Golf= There is an 18-hole golf course in Bundoran. The golf club was founded in 1894. The course is located on the historic Great Northern Railway Company site, the old railway sleepers encompass the Golf course which enjoys the most breathtaking and scenic views of the Atlantic Ocean. The course is a challenging experience despite its short length.Bundoran Golfclub Website =Gaelic games= In the 1920s the location of Bundoran on the railway line made the Bundoran local ground a convenient venue for many big games. The GAA club grounds were purchased in 1938. The club was reorganised and renamed 'The Star of the Sea'. The football park has undergone many developments throughout the years. The ground was levelled in 1947 and enclosed in 1951. The club changing rooms were constructed in 1972. The juniors were successful in both the 1956 and 1960 Championships. In 1963, \\"Star of the Sea\\" joined with Ballyshannon team Aodh Ruadh to become St Joseph's. That team included many players that contributed to the Donegal county team, including Brian McEniff and the former Donegal County Council Manager Michael McLoone. In 1977 the club was again divided into two clubs, one each for the towns of Bundoran and Ballyshannon. In 1979, Bundoran beat Ballybofey in a nail-biting one-point victory to win the Senior Championship. Local man Brian McEniff led Donegal to the 1992 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final, in which they defeated Dublin in the final 0‚Äì18 to 0‚Äì14. Bundoran was the scene of enormous celebrations for almost a month afterwards. In 2015, R√©alt Na Mara won the Donegal Intermediate Football Championship title and went on to reach the Ulster final where they were defeated by Loughinisland. =Greyhound racing= A greyhound racing track was opened by the Bundoran Greyhound Racing Company Ltd in the town during October 1931. The construction cost was ¬£800 in ¬£1 shares and was set up by James Cassidy (cattle dealer) and John Conlan (merchant). The directors also included J.T.Flavin, D.Judge, P.Gorman and W.Hudson. On 21 December 1934 notice had been given that after three months the company would be dissolved but there is evidence that the track was still active or had re-opened during 1948. =Football= The International Football Association Board (IFAB), the body that determines the Laws of the Game, met at the Great Northern Hotel in Bundoran in 1909.

Additionally, the area where tapes that are NOT currently in a silo are stored is also called a tape library. Tape libraries can contain millions of tapes.

Typical entry-level solutions cost around $10,000 USD,HP Small & Medium Business Online Store: HP StorageWorks MSL2024 Tape Libraries while high-end solutions can start at as much as $200,000 USD. Cites cost as \\"From $195,830. (US)\\" and cost well in excess of $1 million for a fully expanded and configured library. For large data-storage, they are a cost-effective solution, with cost per gigabyte as low as 2 cents USD. The tradeoff for their larger capacity is their slower access time, which usually involves mechanical manipulation of tapes. Access to data in a library takes from several seconds to several minutes. Because of their slow sequential access and huge capacity, tape libraries are primarily used for backups and as the final stage of digital archiving. A typical application of the latter would be an organization's extensive transaction record for legal or auditing purposes. Another example is hierarchical storage management (HSM), in which tape library is used to hold rarely used files from file systems.  Software support  There are several large-scale library-management packages available commercially. Open-Source support includes AMANDA and the minimal mtx program.  Barcode labels  Tape libraries commonly have the capability of optically scanning barcode labels which are attached to each tape, allowing them to automatically maintain an inventory of which tapes are where within the library. Preprinted barcode labels are commercially available or custom labels may be generated using commercial or free software. The barcode label is frequently part of the tape label, information recorded at the beginning of the medium to uniquely identify the tape.

There is no clear distinction between the group and latitudinarians in general. =Historiography= The categorization and interpretation of the Cambridge Platonists has changed over time. Frances Yates interpreted them as scholars who engaged with the Christian Kabbalah but rejected Hermeticism following Isaac Casaubon's redating of the Hermetic corpus. She argues that Cudsworth and More perpetuate certain Renaissance Neoplatonic ideas, including a broad syncretism of early forms of Hermeticism, in a new scholarly context. Dmitri Levitin has challenged any categorization of the Cambridge Platonists as a cohesive philosophical group. While he admits that the group \\"existed as a loose set of acquaintances linked by tutorial relationships,\\" he argues that they were not exclusive in their interest in Platonism, nor did most of them believe in any syncretism or a prisca theologia/philosophia perennis. Levitin notes that of the Cambridge Platonists, only More saw himself as a philosopher rather than a philologist or theologian and he faced criticism from others, including Cudworth, for his lack of attention to historical detail. Moreover, philosophers not traditionally deemed \\"Cambridge Platonists\\" took an historical and philosophical interest in Platonism and ideas of ancient science. Based on these conclusions Levitin rejects any categorization of the Cambridge Platonists as a cohesive group in terms of philosophical views as historically unfounded. More recently, David Leech has argued that while Levitin makes some important points \\"it would be a mistake to assume that the category of Cambridge Platonism is a retroprojection of nineteenth century historiography. This is because earlier practices of referring to a group of primarily Cambridge-based ‚ÄòPlatonists‚Äô, invariably including Ralph Cudworth (1617‚Äì88) and Henry More (1614-87), usually Benjamin Whichcote (1609‚Äì83), and (more variably) a number of other key figures, can be traced back at least to the 1730s in continental Europe, and still earlier in English texts.\\" Views The Cambridge Platonists used the framework of the philosophia perennis of Agostino Steuco, and from it argued for moderation. They believed that reason is the proper judge of disagreements, and so they advocated dialogue between the Puritan and Laudian traditions. The orthodox English Calvinists of the time found in their views an insidious attack, by-passing as it did the basic theological issues of atonement and justification by faith. Given the circle's Cambridge background in Puritan colleges such as Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge and Emmanuel College, Cambridge, the undermining was intellectually all the more effective. John Bunyan complained in those terms about Edward Fowler, a close latitudinarian follower. Their understanding of reason was as \\"the candle of the Lord\\": an echo of the divine within the human soul and an imprint of God within man. They believed that reason could judge the private revelations of Puritan narrative, and investigate contested rituals and liturgy of the Church of England. For this approach they were called \\"latitudinarian\\". The dogmatism of the Puritan divines, with their anti- rationalist demands, was, they felt, incorrect. They also felt that the Calvinist insistence on individual revelation left God uninvolved with the majority of mankind. At the same time, they were reacting against the reductive materialist writings of Thomas Hobbes. They felt that the latter, while rationalist, were denying the idealistic part of the universe. To the Cambridge Platonists, religion and reason were in harmony, and reality was known not by physical sensation alone, but by intuition of the intelligible forms that exist behind the material world of everyday perception. Universal, ideal forms inform matter, and the physical senses are unreliable guides to their reality. In response to the mechanical philosophy, More proposed a \\"Hylarchic Principle\\", and Cudworth a concept of \\"Plastic Nature\\".

He is known primarily for being the favored architect of Lorenzo de' Medici, his patron. In this role, Giuliano designed a villa for Lorenzo as well as a monastery for Augustinians and a church where a miracle was said to have taken place. Additionally, Giuliano was commissioned to build multiple structures for Pope Julius II and Pope Leo X. Leon Battista Alberti and Filippo Brunelleschi heavily influenced Sangallo and in turn, he influenced other important Renaissance figures such as Raphael, Leonardo da Vinci, his brother Antonio da Sangallo the Elder, and his sons, Antonio da Sangallo the Younger and Francesco da Sangallo.  Early life  Giuliano da Sangallo (n√© Giuliano Giamberti) was born c. 1445 in Florence. His father, Francesco Giamberti, was a woodworker and an architect who worked closely with Cosimo de' Medici. This proved to be helpful to Giuliano and his brother, Antonio, later in life as it helped them to develop a close working relationship and friendship with Cosimo's grandson, Lorenzo de' Medici. As a child, Giuliano became an apprentice to a joiner. As an apprentice, his woodworking, building and sculpting skills drew the attention of Lorenzo de' Medici. In addition to his work as a joiner's apprentice, Giuliano had the opportunity to study the works of ancient architects as well as his more immediate predecessors such as Leon Battista Alberti and Filippo Brunelleschi. Through this, he was able to develop his creative eye, learn about classical design, and also develop what became a lifelong business relationship with Lorenzo de' Medici. Giuliano's first major, independent commission came from the Medici family and it showed not only his architectural skill, but also his knowledge of defensive fortifications. Lorenzo the Magnificent called upon Giuliano to build military fortifications and manage the artillery in the town of Castellina against an invasion led by the Duke of Calabria. In this role, Giuliano successfully pushed out the Calabrian forces and showed his natural talent for military building and strategy.  Major works  = Medici Villa at Poggio a Caiano = Villa Medici at Poggio a Caiano The victory at Calabria gave Lorenzo de' Medici confidence to keep working with Giuliano. Consequently, Lorenzo commissioned him to design a villa in Poggio a Caiano after holding a competition to determine the best design. Construction on the villa began in 1485 and remained largely unfinished throughout Lorenzo's life. His son, Giovanni, oversaw its completion after being elected pope as Pope Leo X. Giuliano's design featured classical design elements including Ionic columns and an ancient temple style fa√ßade. The Medici Villa in Poggia a Caiano is one of the oldest examples of Renaissance-style country villas and served as an inspiration for many future architects of the era. = Santa Maria delle Carceri = The unfinished fa√ßade of Santa Maria delle Carceri In 1484, a child from the town of Prato claimed to have seen a painting of the Virgin Mary and an infant Jesus come to life on the side of the public jail. Santa Maria delle Carceri was commissioned after the townspeople declared this a miracle and decided that a church should be built at the site of the vision to commemorate it. For this project, Lorenzo de' Medici once again hired his favorite architect, Giuliano. His designs relied heavily on his study of the work of Alberti and Brunelleschi. Specifically, Sangallo used a Greek cross plan. This is a classical layout design that features four arms of equal length extending off of a central nave and it had not been used extensively in the Renaissance before that point. Construction began on the church in 1486, but the fa√ßade remains unfinished to this day. = Reggia in Naples = In 1488, after the initial plans were set for the villa in Poggia a Caiano, Lorenzo de' Medici commissioned Giuliano to build a castle for Ferrante of Aragon, the King of Naples. The building of the castle was part of a larger political plan that the leaders of the different city-states of Renaissance Italy engaged in. When city-states were not warring with each other, they would send gifts as well as painters, sculptors, and architects to each other as diplomatic displays of good faith. Additionally, by sending Giuliano to Naples, the Medici family was attempting to export Florentine culture and architecture across the Italian Peninsula. Giuliano sought to build the castle near the open land by Castel Nuovo. Unfortunately, the castle was never built, but his sketches of the plan still remain. The palace design featured elements similar to that of Giuliano's first major commission, the Medici Villa. Similar elements between the Medici Villa and the castle in Naples include the raised platform on which the structures were built, two stairways leading to the main entrance, and a portico between the two stairways. Furthermore, both structures were built on a rectangular, symmetrical axis. After Giuliano completed his service for the king, he was sent back to Florence with gifts including money, paintings, and sculptures. Giuliano gave many of these gifts to Lorenzo de' Medici as a showing of appreciation for being his patron. While Sangallo was designing the palace for the King of Naples, the King's son, the Duke of Calabria, wrote to Lorenzo de' Medici asking for a palace design as well. In response to this letter, Lorenzo sent another Giuliano, Giuliano da Maiano, to design his palace. Giorgio Vasari, the Renaissance author who wrote biographies of many Renaissance artists in Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects, falsely attributes the Duke of Calabria's palace to Giuliano da Sangallo. Also according to Vasari, after working in Naples, the Bishop of Ostia, later known as Pope Julius II, hired Giuliano to re-fortify his castle in Ostia. It is true that Sangallo worked on this project, but he did it along with another architect, Baccio Pontelli. Additionally, according to inscriptions in the castle, the renovation was completed in 1484, before Giuliano started working for the King of Naples. = Church of San Gallo = After Giuliano returned from Naples, Lorenzo commissioned him once again to build a church for a group of Augustinian monks. This commission was meant to be used as an example of Medici family public patronage in Florence. Based on correspondences during that time, historians have inferred that construction began on the church in 1488. Chiesa di San Gallo was dedicated to the seventh century saint, Saint Gall of Ireland. According to Giorgio Vasari, Lorenzo loved the design so much that he started referring to Giuliano as Giuliano da San Gallo. Eventually, the name caught on and Giuliano jokingly told Lorenzo that his actual surname, Giamberti, would be forgotten. Lorenzo responded by telling him that he was worthy of starting a new family line with the name Sangallo. In addition to this, the gate in the Florence city wall closest to the church became known as Porto San Gallo. During the 1529 Siege of Florence, the Florentine army retreated within the walls of the city. Unfortunately, since the church was built outside of the city walls, it was destroyed. = Palazzo Gondi = Palazzo Gondi Around the same time that Giuliano da Sangallo was commissioned to build the Church of San Gallo, he was also commissioned by a wealthy Florentine merchant, Giuliano Gondi, of the old, Florentine banking Gondi family. After hearing of Sangallo's work for the Medici family and the King of Naples, Gondi requested that he build a new Palazzo Gondi in Florence. For this project, Giuliano relied on the design of the other large palaces in the city such as the Palazzo Medici Riccardi and Palazzo Strozzi. Like both of those palaces, the Palazzo Gondi featured the use of finer levels of stone on each ascending level of the fa√ßade. Unfortunately, like many of his commissions, this palace was not finished within Giuliano's lifetime or within the lifetime of his patron, Giuliano Gondi. The palace continued to be renovated and expanded on for almost two more centuries. Because of these renovations, historians have been unable to definitively identify Sangallo's original plan. = Palazzo della Rovere = Palazzo Della Rovere in Savona Shortly after Giuliano completed his work on Santa Maria delle Carceri, his patron and longtime friend Lorenzo died in 1492. After the death of Lorenzo the Magnificent, a power vacuum was created that allowed an opportunity for France to invade Florence in 1494. The French invasion forced the Medici family and their followers, including Giuliano, out of Florence and into exile. Two years previously, the Bishop of Ostia, Giuliano della Rovere, had fled Italy after his rival in the church, Rodrigo Borgia, was elected Pope as Alexander VI in 1492. Using the shared exile and his past history as a patron of architecture, he convinced Sangallo to design a palace in Savona, France for him. The palace design was greatly influenced by the Bishop's other estates such as the one in Vincoli and the fortress in Ostia that Sangallo helped renovate. Giuliano della Rovere was fueled by a rivalry with his cousin, Rafaelle della Rovere, to make his palace in Savona the biggest that the city had seen. Della Rovere achieved this by purchasing the properties surrounding the family estate. Like Alberti's design for the Palazzo Rucellai in Florence, Sangallo reconciled the fact that the palazzo was made up of multiple buildings by creating one large, towering fa√ßade. Also like the Palazzo Rucellai, Sangallo used the concept of reducing the size of each ascending level of the fa√ßade in order to make it appear more imposing from street level.  Late career and death  Giuliano's final work was to assist in the design and construction of the new St. Peter's Basilica. Sangallo was called upon to design the new church. Pope Julius II, however, appointed Donato Bramante instead and construction began in 1506. After Giuliano's distinguished career and close working relationship with Pope Julius II, Bramante's promotion left him devastated and he left Rome for Florence. After the death of Julius II and the subsequent election of Giovanni de' Medici to the papacy in 1513 as Pope Leo X, along with the death of Bramante in 1514, Giuliano was recalled to Rome from Florence to help rebuild the basilica. By this time however, Giuliano was over seventy years old and not well enough to travel back to Rome and oversee a project of such magnitude. Therefore, Pope Leo X selected another distinguished artist, Raphael, to assume control of the design of the new basilica. Giuliano died in Florence in 1516.  Legacy  Giuliano's legacy is unlike other architects of the era, because many of his largest works remain either unfinished or are no longer standing at all such as Santa Maria delle Carceri, Palazzo Gondi, and the Church of San Gallo. Instead, his legacy is largely based on more abstract concepts. Sangallo's legacy remains through his Sienese Sketchbook. This sketchbook provides an intimate look into Sangallo's mind. It includes ideas he had for concepts ranging from new forms of artillery to cathedral domes to sculptures. Many of these designs were accompanied by measurements and technical details. Additionally, the sketchbook features drawings Sangallo did of already existing structures that he saw on his travels throughout Italy and Europe. Based on this, it appears that Sangallo was also interested in the study of medieval architecture as well as classical architecture. In addition to the sketchbook, the name Sangallo came to be associated with high quality architecture, because of Giuliano's impressive career. After his reputation grew, other architects of the time adopted Sangallo as a name to try and associate themselves with Giuliano's skill and ability.

He was born in Brooklyn, New York and has lived in the Los Angeles area since he was 2 years old. Active since 1979, Hetson is best known as the guitarist for the influential hardcore punk bands Redd Kross, Circle Jerks and Bad Religion. He is known for his high energy stage antics which people have coined the term \\"The Hetson Leap \\". Hetson was a founding member of and also plays guitar in another supergroup, Punk Rock Karaoke, and the hardcore punk band G.F.P.  Careers  =The Circle Jerks= In 1980, Hetson abandoned his position as guitarist of the punk/alternative band Redd Kross to form The Circle Jerks with former Black Flag vocalist Keith Morris. Soon after, they released their debut LP, Group Sex and in 1980 were featured in the Los Angeles documentary The Decline of Western Civilization along with several other Los Angeles punk bands. In 1982, The Circle Jerks released their second album Wild in the Streets. This album, while popular, did not sell nearly as much as their third LP Golden Shower of Hits, released in 1983. While Bad Religion was on hiatus, the Circle Jerks continued touring and recorded two more albums (Wonderful and VI) before breaking up in 1990. However, they reformed in 1994 and released Oddities, Abnormalities and Curiosities, their last album to date, a year later. Hetson would continue to play for both Bad Religion and The Circle Jerks. Despite having not released a full-length album since 1995 (although they did release a new song, \\"I'm Gonna Live\\", on MySpace in 2007), the Circle Jerks have been playing live occasionally over the years, with the exception of two more hiatuses, one from 1995 to 2001, and another from 2011 to 2019. = Bad Religion = Greg Hetson was credited on Bad Religion's album How Could Hell Be Any Worse? for playing the solo for the song Part III. His first (official) release with Bad Religion was the Back to the Known EP, released in 1985, which declared the band's return to their original punk sound after releasing the highly unsuccessful, progressive rock album Into the Unknown, after which the band disbanded. After the release of Back to the Known, Bad Religion broke up for a second time, but reformed in 1986 with the How Could Hell Be Any Worse? line-up and Hetson was included. Bad Religion recorded their first three highly acclaimed reunion albums, Suffer, No Control and Against the Grain, before drummer Pete Finestone quit the band in 1991. Bad Religion replaced Finestone with Bobby Schayer, then recorded their next album, Generator. The album was completed in the spring of 1991, but the band was forced to delay its release until a year later. For the album, Bad Religion also filmed their first music video \\"Atomic Garden\\", which was also their first song to be released as a single. In 1993, the band left their original label Epitaph Records and signed to Atlantic Records, who released their next album Recipe for Hate. While moderately successful, this was the first Bad Religion album to reach any Billboard charts and two videos for the album, \\"American Jesus\\" and \\"Struck a Nerve\\", were made. The band's popularity grew in 1994 with their widely successful album Stranger Than Fiction, including their well-known hits \\"Infected\\" and \\"21st Century (Digital Boy)\\", which are often considered concert staples. After the album was completed, longtime guitarist Brett Gurewitz soon left Bad Religion to concentrate on the future of Epitaph, citing the increasing amount of time he was spending at Epitaph's offices as The Offspring became one of the biggest bands of the mid-1990s, but it was well known that his departure was not on good terms. Gurewitz was replaced by former Minor Threat/Dag Nasty guitarist Brian Baker and Bad Religion recorded three more albums without him. He returned to the band in 2001, the line-up consisting of Greg Graffin (vocals), Gurewitz, Hetson, Baker (all on guitar), Jay Bentley (bass) and Brooks Wackerman (drums). In April 2013, Hetson stopped touring with Bad Religion, supposedly due to divorce, and after briefly playing as a four-piece band, Bad Religion recruited Mike Dimkich of The Cult to fill in for Hetson. Bassist Jay Bentley released the following statement: \\"Greg Hetson is dealing with some personal issues, if he wishes to make a statement we will support that, if he chooses not to we will support that. Mike Dimkich is indeed helping us out right now, and we are genuinely appreciative. Right now we are just looking forward and getting ready to play our shows.\\" In January 2014, Bentley confirmed that Dimkich is an official member of Bad Religion, meaning that Hetson is no longer a member of the band. In April 2014, Hetson tweeted that he is no longer in Bad Religion. = Punk Rock Karaoke = Hetson plays guitar in the all star band Punk Rock Karaoke with Eric Melvin of NOFX, and Steve Soto of The Adolescents, Stan Lee of The Dickies and original Goldfinger drummer Darrin Pfeiffer. Other notable past and recurring members have included Bob Mothersbaugh of Devo, and Mike Watt of Minutemen, Iggy and the Stooges. It was the first interactive live Punk Karaoke band since 1996. The band released DVD/CD set on MVD which has \\"sing along with\\" videos as well as a covers album featuring singers such as Matt Skiba, Dave King and Mike Herrera. = New Musical Project = Hetson is currently working with Loomis Fall, on a side project which include guests Bobby Alt, Chris Vrenna, Christopher Chartrand and engineered by Josh Achziger.

Research Paper 04/82: \\"The collective responsibility of Ministers ‚Äì an outline of the issues\\", Parliament and Constitution Centre, the House of Commons Library. 15 November 2004. p. 7: \\"As with so much of the United Kingdom constitutional and political system, collective ministerial responsibility is not something created or explained in some statute or constitutional document.\\" is a constitutional convention in Parliamentary systems that members of the cabinet must publicly support all governmental decisions made in Cabinet, even if they do not privately agree with them. This support includes voting for the government in the legislature. Some Communist political parties apply a similar convention of democratic centralism to their central committee. If a member of the Cabinet wishes to openly object to a Cabinet decision then they are obliged to resign from their position in the Cabinet. Cabinet collective responsibility is related to the fact that if a vote of no confidence is passed in parliament, the government is responsible collectively, and thus the entire government resigns. The consequence will be that a new government will be formed or parliament will be dissolved and a general election will be called. Cabinet collective responsibility is not the same as individual ministerial responsibility, which states that ministers are responsible for the running of their departments, and therefore culpable for the departments' mistakes. Overview Cabinet collective responsibility is a tradition in parliamentary governments in which the prime minister is responsible for appointing the cabinet ministers. The cabinet ministers are usually selected from the same political party as the prime minister to make collective decision-making for legislation faster and more effective. Unlike a presidential system, as used, for example, in the United States, a parliamentary system's executive and legislative branches are intertwined. Because of the fusion of powers of the executive and legislative branches the prime minister relies on the cabinet to always support policy decisions. A breach of cabinet collective responsibility, such as when a cabinet member publicly disagrees with an executive decision, results in resignation or termination from the cabinet. The New South Wales Parliamentary Library Research Service in Australia explains that \\"one aspect of collective ministerial responsibility is that Ministers share responsibility for major government decisions, particularly those made by the cabinet and, even if they personally object to such decisions, Ministers must be prepared to accept and defend them or resign from the cabinet\\". Cabinet collective responsibility consists of two main features: ;Cabinet confidentiality: the members of the cabinet must not reveal the content of discussions which take place. This allows for cabinet members to privately debate and raise concerns. ;Cabinet solidarity: the members of the cabinet must publicly show a unified position, and must vote with the government even if they privately disagree with the decision that has been made. Collective responsibility is not circumvented by appointing Ministers outside of Cabinet,Cabinet Office Cabinet Manual 2008 (Wellington, 2008) para 3.20 as has occurred in New Zealand where, from 2005 to 2008, Winston Peters and Peter Dunne were Ministers outside of Cabinet, despite their parties not being considered part of a coalition. In non- parliamentary governments like that of the United States, cabinet collective responsibility is not formally practiced. This is due to a clearer separation of the executive and the legislature in policy-making. The United States president's cabinet members cannot simultaneously serve in Congress, and therefore cannot vote on legislation supported by the executive. The president instead has veto power over legislation passed by Congress. Cabinet unity and collective agreement between members are important to cabinet stability and party politics, but cabinet members do not have to publicly support legislation proposed or supported by the president. It is, however, in a cabinet member's best interest to support and align with the president's policies because they serve at the pleasure of the president, who can at any time dismiss them or appoint them to another position. Examples Parliamentary democracies such as Australia, the United Kingdom and Canada practice and adhere to cabinet collective responsibility. Rhodes, Wanna and Weller offer this description of the principle of cabinet solidarity in Westminster systems of parliamentary democracy: \\"Cabinet solidarity and collective responsibility are twin dimensions of responsible party government that enjoy constitutionality, albeit informally. They lie at the core of ministerial governance. Cabinet solidarity is purely a political convention designed to maintain or protect the collective good as perceived by a partisan ministry. It rests on the notion that the executive ought to appear a collective entity, able to maintain cohesion and display political strength\\". =Australia= In Australia, cabinet collective responsibility is fundamental to cabinet confidentiality, but also to protect private information from becoming public and possibly threatening national security. Cabinet solidarity is not a legal requirement, but a political convention and practiced norm. There is no written law that upholds cabinet collective responsibility, but it is deeply ingrained in Australia's cabinets as a political norm and is therefore an important aspect of the collective strength and influence of the prime minister's administration. Occasionally on highly controversial issues such as the 1999 republic referendum, there may be a conscience vote where any MP may vote as they wish, but these issues are rare and never tied to official party policy, and normally party discipline is very tight. =Canada= In Canada, the cabinet is on rare occasion allowed to freely vote its conscience and to oppose the government without consequence, as occurred with the vote on capital punishment under Brian Mulroney. These events are rare and are never on matters of confidence. The most prominent Canadian cabinet minister to resign because he could not vote with the cabinet was John Turner, who refused to support wage and price controls. In Canada, party discipline is much tighter than in other Westminster-system countries; it is very rare for any MP to vote counter to the party leadership. =Finland= In Finland, collective responsibility has been established both constitutionally and as a convention. The Finnish Government and its ministers are collectively responsible for all its decisions. However, the constitution allows a minister to dissent by expressing an objection which is entered into the minutes. Nevertheless, while formally allowed, dissent is uncommon because it jeopardizes the stability of the government. Namely, majority coalition governments became the norm after President Kekkonen retired in 1981. A new cabinet must be approved by a parliamentary majority, thus a government platform is agreed upon by the participating parties. It is distinct from party platforms and details the compromises that parties made in order to cooperate. If a party fails to follow the government platform, other parties in the government can pull the plug and force the entire government to resign. =Ireland= Article 28.4.2¬∞ of the Constitution of Ireland states: :The Government shall meet and act as a collective authority, and shall be collectively responsible for the Departments of State administered by the members of the Government. In 1992, the Beef Tribunal was investigating allegations of political corruption, and wanted to take evidence from a minister about cabinet meetings at which controversial proposals had been discussed. The Supreme Court ruled in 1993 that such discussions could not be disclosed because Article 28.4.2¬∞ required absolute confidentiality of cabinet discussions (though not of decisions which were formally recorded).Attorney General v Hamilton (No 1) [1993] 2 IR 250 The Seventeenth Amendment of the Constitution was passed by referendum in 1997 to add Article 28.4.3¬∞, which allows such disclosures in exceptional circumstances. =United Kingdom= The United Kingdom practices cabinet collective responsibility. The prime minister selects a number of cabinet ministers from the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Once selected as cabinet ministers, each minister is given a position as head of one of the government departments. Cabinet ministers respond to oral questions from MPs. The cabinet members, along with the Prime Minister, schedule weekly closed door sessions to discuss the collective stance of the cabinet to avoid inconsistent responses from cabinet ministers. The solidarity of the cabinet is consistently challenged by the opposition in an attempt to create contradictions between cabinet ministers. It is therefore imperative for the cabinet members to have their responses as common and similar as possible. In the United Kingdom, the doctrine applies to all members of the government, from members of the cabinet down to Parliamentary Private Secretaries. Its inner workings are set out in the Ministerial Code. On occasion, this principle has been suspended; most notably in the 1930s when in Britain the National Government allowed its Liberal members to oppose the introduction of protective tariffs; and again when Harold Wilson allowed Cabinet members to campaign both for and against the 1975 referendum on whether the UK should remain in the European Economic Community. In 2003, Tony Blair allowed Clare Short to stay in the cabinet, despite her public opposition to the 2003 Iraq War; however, she later resigned. Prime Minister David Cameron suspended the cabinet collective responsibility doctrine for the 2016 EU referendum, following the precedent set by Harold Wilson in 1975. Prominent cabinet ministers including Michael Gove and Chris Grayling opted to make use of the relaxation by campaigning to leave. Advantages A parliamentary system that uses cabinet collective responsibility is more likely to avoid contradictions and disagreements between cabinet members of the executive branch. Cabinet ministers are likely to feel there is a practical and collective benefit from being part of a team. Cabinet collective responsibility to the people also benefits party and personal loyalty to the prime minister. Solidarity within the cabinet can strengthen the prime minister's party and accelerate policy decisions and interests of that party. Presidential democracies often lack the ability to pass legislation quickly in times of emergency or instances of national security. Disadvantages Because cabinet collective responsibility forces the cabinet ministers to publicly agree with the prime minister's decisions, political debate and internal discourse is hindered. When disagreements occur within a cabinet dependent on collective responsibility, negotiating collective agreements can be difficult. Cabinet collective responsibility is therefore dependent on the mutual agreement and collective unity of the cabinet and its members.

Antonio da Sangallo the Elder (c. 1453December 27, 1534) was an Italian Renaissance architect who specialized in the design of fortifications. Biography Antonio da Sangallo was born at Florence. Sangallo's father Francesco Giamberti was a woodworker. His brother Giuliano da Sangallo and nephew Antonio da Sangallo the Younger were also architects. Sangallo's godson, Giulio de Medici (the future Pope Clement VII) was raised in his household until the boy reached the age of seven, when Giulio's uncle Lorenzo the Magnificent became his full-time guardian.http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1513.htm Sangallo often worked in partnership with his brother; however, he executed a number of independent works. As a military engineer he was especially skillful, building important works at Arezzo, Montefiascone, Florence and Rome. His most outstanding work as an architect is the church of San Biagio at Montepulciano, in plan a Greek cross with central dome, \\"the first of the great cinquecento domes to be completed\\".Wolfgang Lotz, in Ludwig Heinrich Heydenreich and Wolfgang Lotz, Architecture in Italy, 1400-1600 (1974:185). and two towers‚Äîresembling, on a smaller scale, Bramante's design for St. Peter's Basilica.

Completion of the last segment of the highway occurred on June 5, 2015. Route description I-485 travels around the city of Charlotte, with mile markers beginning/ending at the I-77/US 21 interchange with the highway near Pineville. Lane counts vary from four to eight, while the posted speed limit throughout is . The beltway is further broken down into four segments: Seddon \\"Rusty\\" Goode Freeway (southwest), Craig Lawing Freeway (northwest), H. Allen Tate, Jr. Highway (northeast) and Governor James G. Martin Freeway (southeast). The southwest segment is six-lanes throughout, on concrete, and borders the Steele Creek area. Attractions in this area include the Charlotte Premium Outlets (exit 4) and Lake Wylie. There are also two exits here for the Charlotte/Douglas International Airport: exit 6 for the Air Cargo Center and exit 9 for the main terminal. The northwest segment of the beltway is six-lanes throughout, on concrete. Attractions in this area include the U.S. National Whitewater Center (exit 12), Northlake Mall (exit 21) and Mountain Island Lake. The northeast segment is eight-lanes throughout, using both concrete and asphalt, and borders Huntersville at its northernmost point. Attractions in this area include the Carolina Renaissance Festival (October‚ÄìNovember) and Concord Mills Mall. The southeast segment is the largest segment, which goes through the towns of Mint Hill, Matthews and Pineville, as well as the notable Charlotte neighborhoods University City and Ballantyne area. Over of the segment is four-lane, with six/eight lane sections within the University City, Ballantyne and Pineville areas, all on asphalt. Attractions in this area include the Charlotte Motor Speedway (exit 32), PNC Music Pavilion, University of North Carolina at Charlotte (exit 33), the Mecklenburg County Sportsplex, Carolina Place Mall (exit 64B) and President James K. Polk Historic Site (exit 65B). Although the loop runs within of the South Carolina state line, and within of the Cabarrus County line at the Rocky River Road exit, the entire beltway is within Mecklenburg County's boundaries, and never crosses into South Carolina or any neighboring counties. I-485 is Charlotte's only \\"true\\" loop road as both I-277 and Route 4 are partial ring roads. =Orientation and signage= I-485 inner (north) at the interchange with I-77 south of Charlotte Since Interstate 485 is a beltway, the compass orientation of the freeway is not uniform around the loop. To remedy the uniformity issue, the inner/outer orientation system was implemented and became the primary method of signing the direction of travel around the loop. Some sections of the loop are signed with additional north/south or east/west labels (depending on the general direction of travel along a particular stretch) to aid drivers familiar with compass directions. Usually when both systems are utilized on signs, the compass directional banner is placed above the number shield and the inner/outer banner is placed below.Interstate Guide - I-485 Outer / Wilkinson Blvd sign picture Officials originally decided to use only \\"north\\" and \\"south\\" compass directions when signing the route, but because this would be confusing with multiple \\"norths\\" and \\"souths\\", \\"inner\\" and \\"outer\\" designations were included. Although \\"east\\" and \\"west\\" signs exist, these will be phased out in favor of \\"inner\\" and \\"outer\\" designations. Traffic traveling in a clockwise direction around the city of Charlotte is on the \\"Inner\\" loop and traffic traveling in a counterclockwise direction is on the \\"Outer\\" loop. This system can be confusing, but it is logical; since traffic in the United States generally travels on the right side of the road, the clockwise traveling lanes will always be the \\"Inner\\" lanes of a loop. There are three control cities along the route: Huntersville, Matthews and Pineville. Secondary control cities, which include Spartanburg, Statesville, Greensboro and Columbia, are also listed at various interchanges for travelers that want to bypass Charlotte to other destinations, via Interstates 77 and 85. =Dedicated and memorial names= I-485 in North Carolina is split into four dedicated or memorialized stretches of freeway. * Craig Lawing Freeway ‚Äì Official name of the northwest section, named for Craig Lawing from mile marker 10 to 23 (approved: February 2, 2001). * Governor James G.

Approved on January 5, 2001, it was never signed; when this section was finally constructed in 2015, it was redesignated to honor H. Allen Tate, Jr. History NC 24 ends at I-485, in Charlotte The first section of what became I-485 was completed around 1967, connecting a newly opened section of I-85 with US 29 near the Cabarrus-Mecklenburg county line. This section became a part of Interstate 485 on May 5, 1999, the first section of the highway on the north end of the county. In 1975, planning began for the Charlotte outerbelt. On July 8, 1988, Gov. Jim Martin and state transportation secretary Seddon Goode attended a groundbreaking near US 521, marking the start of construction on the first section between US 521 and NC 51\\\\. Martin also announced the designation \\"Interstate 485\\" for what had previously been called the outerbelt. The section opened November 1, 1990, two months earlier than planned. Still, because of all the development in the area, the highway immediately became inadequate for the area's needs and required widening. A , $67.2 million section of I-485 from US 521 to I-77 opened October 24, 1994. The section included a four-level interchange, the first and only in North Carolina, at its junction with I-77. On December 9, 1994, the section from NC 51 to Rea Road opened. On July 1, 1997, a $13.9 million section of I-485 opened between I-77 and NC 49, a section designated The Seddon \\"Rusty\\" Goode Jr. Freeway, named for a member of the North Carolina Board of Transportation who helped decide where I-485 would be built. On August 15, 1997, of I-485 opened between Rea Road and NC 16 (Providence Road). An $8.6 million section from NC 49 to Brown-Grier Road in the Steele Creek community opened in two stages August 26 and 27; the name of Brown-Grier Road changed to Arrowood Road when that road was extended. Seven more miles opened September 15, connecting NC 16 to U.S. 74. In May 1999, the original segment between I-85 and US 29 (N. Tryon Street) was widened and upgraded to interstate standards, officially becoming part of I-485; a few months later, on August 13, the segment was extended to NC 49 (University City Boulevard). In December 1999, the main section of I-485 continued its extension north from US 74 to Idlewild Road, adding . In June 2000, another extension was completed, between Idlewild Road and Lawyers Road in Mint Hill, at a cost of $10.2 million. In 2003, the last needed to link main I-485 to its northern stub was completed, at a cost of $55.4 million. Opening in two phases, the first segment opened on September 3, 2003, between University City Boulevard and NC 27 (Albemarle Road); two months later, the second segment opened on November 19, between Albemarle Road and Lawyers Road. By end of 2003, I-485 was one continuous freeway between I-85 (near Concord) to Arrowood Road. On October 19, 2004, I-485 was widened, from four to six-lanes between I-77/US 21 and Arrowood Road, and extended between Arrowood Road and I-85 (near Belmont). Completion of the $100 million segment was noted that it would relieve traffic along the Billy Graham Parkway and provide an alternative route to Charlotte Douglas International Airport. On December 15, 2006, a segment between I-85 (near Belmont) and NC 27 (Mount Holly Road) opened; signed as Future I-485, it was also dedicated as the Craig Lawing Freeway. Six months later, on May 9, 2007, another segment, between Mount Holly Road and NC 16 (Brookshire Boulevard) was opened. On December 4, 2008, a segment between Brookshire Boulevard and NC 115 (Old Statesville Road) was opened; all future signage was removed from the previous segments, with new signage showing connection between I-77, towards Statesville, and I-85, towards Spartanburg. In 2011, West Boulevard interchange (exit 6) was opened to traffic, existing previously as a graded future interchange since 2004. The final segment, from I-77 to I-85 near UNC Charlotte, had begun Right of Way Acquisition phase with contracts awarded in June 2010. The segment opened to traffic on June 5, 2015, finally completing the loop and providing a direct connection from I-77 near Huntersville to I-85 near Concord Mills Mall. Since 2003, the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) made sure that future segments of I-485 were designed with a minimum of six travel lanes. While the first segments of I-485 were already choked by traffic, thanks to Charlotte's rapid growth, NCDOT could not immediately deal with the issue thanks to a 2000 policy that prevented the state using trust fund money, a major source of funding for new projects, to widen existing roads. Eventually, NCDOT was able to allocate new funds for a widening project, between US 521 (Johnston Road) and I-77/US 21, which was slated for construction in 2012. On November 18, 2011, NCDOT changed the plans with an extension of the widening project to Rea Road and additional space allocated for a future toll lane, between Johnston Road and I-77/US 21. Construction on the modified widening project began in 2013; at a cost of $83.3 million, the widening project was completed in December 2015. On January 15, 2017, the Oakdale Road interchange (exit 18) was opened to traffic, existing previously as a graded future interchange since 2008. Future Since November 18, 2011, NCDOT has made plans for future toll lanes along I-485. Modifying an already planned widening project between US 521 (Johnston Road) and I-77/US 21, it called on a future toll lane to be constructed as well as extending the widening project towards Rea Road. The future toll lanes, when completed would be between US 74 (Independence Boulevard) and I-77/US 21; in April 2014, the Charlotte Regional Transportation Planning Organization (CRTPO) adopted the 2040 Metropolitan Transportation Plan (MTP), which included establishing toll lanes along I-485. The first segment of the new toll lanes, between Johnston Road and I-77/US 21, were completed in December 2015, but were not opened. The new un-open lanes along I-485 became controversial and discussions were made about making it an HOV lane, or at least temporally; however local and state officials said that could not be done and would cost more for just temporary use of the lanes. At a cost of $202.9 million, the Interstate 485 Express Lanes project will establish new toll lanes along its entire planned route. It will also include the following improvements: Adding additional general purpose lanes between Providence Road and Rea Road, extend auxiliary lanes between Independence Boulevard and East Johns Street, establish dedicated connectors from the Express Lanes to Johnston Road (eastbound only) and Westinghouse Boulevard (westbound only) and incorporates the existing planned project of adding a new interchange at Weddington Road. Tolls would be collected using an electronic toll collection (ETC) system; drivers will need to have the NC Quick Pass, or other interoperable transponder, or will be billed by mail with a higher rate. Construction was slated to begin \\"tentatively\\" in the summer of 2018.

Pipeline architectures belong to this type, though a purist might say that the data is different after processing by each stage in the pipeline. Fault tolerance executing the same instructions redundantly in order to detect and mask errors, in a manner known as task replication, may be considered to belong to this type. Applications for this architecture are much less common than MIMD and SIMD, as the latter two are often more appropriate for common data parallel techniques. Specifically, they allow better scaling and use of computational resources. However, one prominent example of MISD in computing are the Space Shuttle flight control computers. Systolic arrays Systolic arrays (< wavefront processors), first described by H. T. Kung and Charles E. Leiserson are an example of MISD architecture. In a typical systolic array, parallel input data flows through a network of hard-wired processor nodes, resembling the human brain which combine, process, merge or sort the input data into a derived result. Systolic arrays are often hard-wired for a specific operation, such as \\"multiply and accumulate\\", to perform massively parallel integration, convolution, correlation, matrix multiplication or data sorting tasks. A Systolic array typically consists of a large monolithic network of primitive computing nodes which can be hardwired or software configured for a specific application. The nodes are usually fixed and identical, while the interconnect is programmable. More general wavefront processors, by contrast, employ sophisticated and individually programmable nodes which may or may not be monolithic, depending on the array size and design parameters. Because the wave-like propagation of data through a systolic array resembles the pulse of the human circulatory system, the name systolic was coined from medical terminology. A major benefit of systolic arrays is that all operand data and partial results are contained within (passing through) the processor array. There is no need to access external buses, main memory or internal caches during each operation as is the case with standard sequential machines. The sequential limits on parallel performance dictated by Amdahl's theorem also do not apply in the same way, because data dependencies are implicitly handled by the programmable node interconnect. Systolic arrays are therefore extremely good at artificial intelligence, image processing, pattern recognition, computer vision and other tasks which animal brains do so particularly well. Wavefront processors in general can also be very good at machine learning by implementing self configuring neural nets in hardware. While systolic arrays are officially classified as MISD, their classification is somewhat problematic. Because the input is typically a vector of independent values, the systolic array is definitely not SISD. Since these input values are merged and combined into the result(s) and do not maintain their independence as they would in a SIMD vector processing unit, the array cannot be classified as such. Consequently, the array cannot be classified as a MIMD either, since MIMD can be viewed as a mere collection of smaller SISD and SIMD machines. Finally, because the data swarm is transformed as it passes through the array from node to node, the multiple nodes are not operating on the same data, which makes the MISD classification a misnomer. The other reason why a systolic array should not qualify as a MISD is the same as the one which disqualifies it from the SISD  The input data is typically a vector not a single data value, although one could argue that any given input vector is a single dataset. All of the above not withstanding, systolic arrays are often offered as a classic example of MISD architecture in textbooks on parallel computing and in the engineering class. If the array is viewed from the outside as atomic it should perhaps be classified as SFMuDMeR = Single Function, Multiple Data, Merged Result(s).Michael J. Flynn, Kevin W. Rudd.

The church of Santa Maria di Loreto near the Trajan's Market in Rome. The Villa Farnese in Caprarola; the initial design was by Sangallo and Baldassare Peruzzi. San Giovanni dei Fiorentini; Sangallo was responsible for the foundation projecting out into the Tiber. View of St. Patrick's Well in Orvieto. Antonio da Sangallo the Younger (12 April 14843 August 1546), also known as Antonio da San Gallo, was an Italian architect active during the Renaissance, mainly in Rome and the Papal States. Early Life and Apprenticeship Sangallo was born Antonio Cordiani in Florence, the son of Bartolomeo Piccioni. His grandfather Francesco Giamberti was a woodworker, and his uncles Giuliano and Antonio da Sangallo were noted architects of the time. Vasari writes that the young Sangallo followed his uncles to Rome in order to pursue a career in architecture; he ended up taking the name ‚Ä≥Sangallo‚Ä≥ in their tracks. Instead of becoming an apprentice to an artist, as was the common path toward becoming an architect,Ackerman, James S. \\"Architectural Practice in the Italian Renaissance\\". Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, Vol. 13, No. 3 (Oct. 1954). Sangallo apprenticed to a carpenter; nevertheless he quickly became an apprentice under Donato Bramante. As an assistant to Bramante, Sangallo prepared a number of sketches due to the disability of his master, and was recognized for talent and attention to detail as a draftsman.Vasari, Giorgio, \\"Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects\\", volume VI, London, Philip Lee Warner, 1912-1914, 124 Due to his success, Bramante gave Sangallo a number of projects to complete with no more than an outline of the design and motifs. Eventually, Sangallo was put in charge of the Passetto di Borgo between the Papal apartments and the Castel Sant'Angelo. That particular project was left unfinished, but it left Sangallo with a working reputation as an architect.Vasari, \\"Lives\\", 124. Independent Commissions Now living in Rome, Sangallo quickly received a major commission for the church of Santa Maria di Loreto in 1507. His design called for a square first story and an octagonal second story built in travertine and brick; the dome and lantern were finished many years later. Sangallo also drew the attention of the Cardinal Alessandro Farnese (who would later become the Pope Paul III), from whom he received a number of commissions. First and foremost of these is the Farnese Palace on the Piazza Farnese, although it was not completed until after his death. Sangallo also received a number of further contracts from the Farnese family. For instance, he designed a palace (since destroyed) and the Church of Santa Maria Maddalena in the Farnese town of Gradoli. He also designed fortifications for Capo di Monte and Caprarola; the latter eventually became a country estate, the Villa Farnese. In addition to the Farnese family, Sangallo had a number of patrons in Rome. He designed the Palazzo Baldassini near the Basilica of Sant'Agostino for Melchiore Baldassini; he designed a tomb for the Cardinal Jaume Serra i Cau in San Giacomo degli Spagnoli. Sangallo was also one of several artists hired to design the Villa Madama by Cardinal Giulio de' Medici, the future Clement VII; he was personally responsible for the final design of the building itself. Through these projects, Sangallo acquired the reputation of a master architect in the city of Rome; when Bramante died in 1514, Sangallo, along with Raphael and Giovanni Giocondo, was appointed to oversee the construction of St. Peter's Basilica by Pope Leo X. Sangallo was hired extensively by Leo X, not only as an architect, but also as an engineer tasked to restore and save a number of buildings. Engineering Feats Some time later, Sangallo was hired to build the foundation for the church of San Giovanni dei Fiorentini on the bank of the Tiber. Jacopo Sansovino's design called for the church to extend into the river, a difficult task given the unstable bank. Sangallo successfully completed the foundation, although at such great expense that there was no longer enough money to build the church.Vasari, \\"Lives\\", volume VI, 127. Thus the model that Sangallo designed for the church was not built, and construction to the designs of Giacomo della Porta was not begun until 1583. Another project was the Basilica della Santa Casa in Loreto. The church had not been built particularly well, with cracking vaults and an unstable foundation. Sangallo redesigned the church and shored up the foundations; Vasari claims the church to be ‚Ä≥the best that Antonio ever executed‚Ä≥ despite the challenges innate in rebuilding a church as opposed to building a new one from the ground up.Vasari, \\"Lives\\", volume VI, 131. Sangallo was also hired to do similar work on the Vatican loggias, which had shown signs of weakness due to poor construction; his reinforcements stand today. Sangallo was also a noted military architect, working on the fortifications of numerous cities such as Parma, Piacenza, Ancona and Orvieto. In Orvieto, he was also tasked by Pope Clement VII with building a well, called Saint Patrick's Well, noted as a marvel of engineering. Its double helix ramps around a central open shaft allowed oxen carrying water to go down via one of the ramps and up via the other without having to turn around; despite its 175-foot depth, the ramps are well lit through windows cut into the center section. Possibly an inspiration for the design was the Well of Joseph in the Cairo Citadel, also featuring a double spiral staircase. His last project was the draining of the Rieti Valley, which had been commissioned to him by Pope Paul III; in the insalubrious marshy environment Sangallo contracted malaria and died before finishing his work. Work on Vatican and Saint Peter's Basilica Sangallo had maintained a good relationship with the popes, and thus was constantly involved in the designing and building process of St. Peter's Basilica from 1513 until at least 1536.Ackerman, \\"Architectural Practice in the Italian Renaissance.\\" As \\"capomaestro\\", he was in charge of the day-to-day construction on the basilica for many years. He also created a design for the basilica, of which a wooden model exists today. File:Roma S.Pietro in Vaticano (zzg).jpg|Facade of Sangallo's design for the basilica. File:Cosimo I de' Medici Grand Duke of Tuscany coronation.jpg|The Sala Regia, designed by Sangallo for Pope Paul III File:Roma Vatican Scala Regia c1835.jpg|The Scala Regia, with sculptures by Bernini. Sangallo also worked extensively on the Vatican apartments, building the Pauline Chapel, the Sala Regia which serves as the entryway to the Sistine Chapel, and the Scala Regia, the staircase that serves as the main entrance to the Apostolic Palace. Vasari also claims that Sangallo modified the Sistine Chapel by elevating the roof, although exactly what the modifications are is unclear.Vasari, \\"Lives\\", volume VI, 135.

Death and legacy Sangallo had begun the design for the Palazzo Farnese in 1513; when Cardinal Alessandro Farnese became Pope Paul III in 1534, the design was expanded into its current size. According to Sir Banister Fletcher, it is \\"the most imposing Italian palace of the 16th Century.\\"D. Cruikshank, ed, \\"Sir Banister Fletcher's A History of Architecture, 20th edition\\", New York:Princeton Architectural Press, 1996, page 873. In 1546, during the construction, Paul III became dissatisfied with the design for the cornice, and held a competition for a new cornice design. Michelangelo won the competition and oversaw the completion of the palace; Sangallo reportedly died, in Terni, Italy, from shame not long after.Ackerman, \\"Architectural Practice in the Italian Renaissance.\\" He is buried in St. Peter's Basilica with the following epitaph: : ANTONIO SANCTI GALLI FLORENTINO, URBE MUNIENDA AC PUB. :OPERIBUS, PRAECIPUEQUE D.

His pioneering work on rare gases in meteorites led him to develop the argon‚Äìargon dating technique that demonstrated the great age of meteorites and provided a precise chronology of rocks (which were held by Olivia Sunderland) brought back by the Apollo missions. He was one of the few UK scientists to be a Principal Investigator of these Apollo samples. His argon-dating technique involved stepped pyrolysis of the rocks to force out the argon, then determining the isotopic ratios in the gas by mass spectrometry. This was later refined by the use of lasers. These techniques have been invaluable to cosmochemists and geochemists, and have been applied (by Turner and others) to determine the geochronology of diamonds and inclusions in them, and the precise ages of mantle and crustal rocks from the Earth. He went on to develop even better techniques, such as iodine-xenon chronology. He used laser resonance ionisation of xenon to measure samples with only a few thousand atoms of xenon; this enabled him to get accurate data from tiny samples, including individual chondrules. He could even trace secondary processes, such as alteration by heat, fluids or shock. Turner set up the first ion microprobe in the United Kingdom intended for use primarily for examining extraterrestrial material. He used it to measure oxygen-isotope variations in the Martian meteorite ALH 84001. His results cast light on the environment in which the carbonate grains and so-called microfossils in that meteorite formed. He was a founder member, and continues to be a leader, of the UK Cosmochemical Analysis Network, a network of laboratories in research institutions that analyse extraterrestrial material. Despite having formally retired, he continues to be an active researcher. In 2004, he announced a plutonium-xenon technique for dating terrestrial materials.

It follows a group of people living in an abandoned section of the New York City Subway system, more specifically the area of Freedom Tunnel. The film was shot during the mid-1990s, but was not completed and released until the year 2000. DJ Shadow completed the score for the documentary. Background When he relocated from London to Manhattan, Marc Singer was struck by the number of homeless people he had seen throughout the city. Singer had befriended many in New York's homeless community and later, after hearing of people living underground in abandoned tunnel systems, he met and became close to a group of people living in The Freedom Tunnel community stretching north from Penn Station past Harlem. After living on and off with them for a number of months, he decided to create a documentary in order to help them financially, even though Singer had never been a filmmaker before. He saw the production of Dark Days as a means of gaining better accommodation for the residents of the tunnel. Production The film's crew consisted of the subjects themselves, who rigged up makeshift lighting and steadicam dollies, and learned to use a 16mm camera with black-and-white Kodak film. The post-production process took years, as financial difficulties created delays, as did Singer's insistence of creative control to protect the tunnel residents. During filming, Amtrak announced they would be forcibly evicting the homeless living in the tunnels in order to reroute their trains through the tunnel. This announcement, plus the police presence backing the decision, prompted Singer and photographer Margaret Morton to go to the Coalition for the Homeless for help. Eventually, Singer and Morton managed to secure housing vouchers from the Department of Housing and Urban Development for the film's subjects, which enabled them to move out of the tunnels and into their own apartments. Melissa Neidich was the editor of the film. Cinevision, a New York City camera shop, supplied Singer with cameras for the two-and-a-half years of filming. When Singer ran out of money for film, Kodak supplied free damaged film for the project. Soundtrack The film features music by DJ Shadow, including excerpts from Endtroducing..... as well as his album with Unkle. He also composed original music for the main theme of the film, released on the single \\"Dark Days\\". Release and reception Dark Days was released in 2000, and was nominated for several film festival awards. Out of its nominations, the film won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Documentary Feature, the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Documentary Film, the Senior Programmer's Pick at the 2000 SXSW Film Awards, and three Sundance Film Festival awards in 2000: the Audience Award Documentary, the Excellence in Cinematography Award Documentary, and the Freedom of Expression Award. =Tenth anniversary rerelease= Oscilloscope Laboratories re-released \\"Dark Days\\" theatrically at Cinema Village in New York City on July 1, 2011 as well as on DVD on July 19, 2011.

Early years Szab√≥ was born in Budapest, Hungary. He began playing guitar at the age of 14. In the aftermath of the Hungarian revolution of 1956, he moved to California and later attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston between 1958 and 1960. Career In 1961, Szab√≥ became member of a quintet that was led by Chico Hamilton and included Charles Lloyd, playing what has been described as chamber jazz, with \\"a moderate avant-gardism.\\" Szab√≥ was influenced by the rock music of the 1960s, particularly the use of feedback. In 1965 he was in a jazz pop group led by Gary McFarland, then worked again with Lloyd in an energetic quartet with Ron Carter and Tony Williams. The song \\"Gypsy Queen\\" from Szab√≥'s debut solo album Spellbinder became a hit for rock guitarist Carlos Santana. During the late 1960s, Szab√≥ worked in a group with guitarist Jimmy Stewart. He started the label Skye Records with McFarland and Cal Tjader. Szab√≥ continued to be drawn to more popular, commercial music in the 1970s. He performed often in California, combining elements of Gypsy and Indian music with jazz. He returned often to his home country of Hungary to perform, and it was there that he died just short of his 46th birthday.

Labs was introduced in Superman #246 (December 1971). In the Superman comics, Professor Hamilton formerly worked there, and Dr. Kitty Faulkner, also known as the superheroine Rampage, is currently employed there. The Metropolis location is featured in a battle and as a plot point in Armageddon 2001. In Teen Titans, Cyborg's parents, Silas and Eleanor Stone, and his former love interest, Dr. Sarah Charles, all worked for S.T.A.R. Labs. Past S.T.A.R. Labs employees are Murray Takamoto, Dr. Jenet Klyburn, Prof Dr. eL Mohammed and Dr. Albert Michaels (the first Atomic Skull). The character of Dr. Klyburn was based on the incoming president of DC Comics, Jenette Kahn. The 1993 comics miniseries S.T.A.R. Corps was about a group of superhumans who had inadvertently gained their powers in a S.T.A.R. Labs experiment. The organization is featured in the 1996 mini-series The Final Night. As eternal winter threatens the world, thanks to the Sun-Eater, S.T.A.R. Labs keeps their webpage updated with encouragement and various information related to the emergency. S.T.A.R.

It is first mentioned in the second season of Arrow during the episode \\"Three Ghosts\\" when Barry Allen (Grant Gustin), having helped Oliver Queen thwart one of Sebastian Blood's schemes in Starling City, returns to his home of Central City, only to be simultaneously hit by both lightning and an explosion caused by the meltdown of S.T.A.R. Labs's particle accelerator and rendered comatose for nine months. Later, in \\"The Man Under the Hood,\\" S.T.A.R. scientists Caitlin Snow (Danielle Panabaker) and Cisco Ramon (Carlos Valdes) are recruited by Felicity Smoak (Emily Bett Rickards) to synthesize a cure to Mirakuru drug using a blood sample. The villain Deathstroke (Manu Bennett) also attacks S.T.A.R. Labs in the same episode on the hunt for some equipment. * S.T.A.R. Labs returns in the 2014 series The Flash. Following the events of the second season of Arrow, Barry awakens from his coma and learns that he has gained super speed. He joins forces with Caitlin, Cisco, S.T.A.R. founder Harrison Wells (Tom Cavanagh), and his adoptive father Joe West (Jesse L. Martin) to combat individuals who were also affected by the particle accelerator explosion (dubbed metahumans) but are using their newfound abilities for nefarious purposes, using S.T.A.R. Labs as a primary base of operations and reappropriating the old particle accelerator as a makeshift prison for them. It is revealed throughout the events of the first season that Eobard Thawne (Cavanagh/Matt Letscher), who had been masquerading as Wells, had engineered the explosion to give Barry his powers and groomed him into becoming the Flash in order to use Barry to return to his original time in the future. In the second season, Barry, having defeated Eobard, is given ownership of S.T.A.R. Labs by Eobard through his will. However, Team Flash discover that a breach to parallel worlds has appeared in S.T.A.R. Labs as a result of the events of the first season, and through it they meet Jay Garrick (Teddy Sears) and a second Harrison Wells, who have come to stop the villainous Zoom, a murderous speedster from their world (dubbed \\"Earth-2\\") who plans to steal Barry's speed for himself. The second season also introduces the S.T.A.R. Labs of Earth-2, which was also responsible for creating metahumans. Wells, Barry and Cisco briefly reside there with the intention of closing the breaches between the two Earths in order to trap Zoom in Earth-2, but they are forced to evacuate when Zoom attacks the building. The third season introduces a new room called the \\"Speed Lab\\", an exercise chamber for Barry and other speedsters that was created as a result of Barry creating a new timeline. It also introduces a third S.T.A.R. Labs on Earth-19 whose Harrison Wells is recruited by the team. Unlike the S.T.A.R. Labs of other Earths, however, its leading scientific mind is not Wells but instead his partner, Randolf Morgan (Adam Bergquist), whose work Wells often claims credit for. During his time on Earth-1 the Wells from Earth-19 begins the process of turning S.T.A.R. Labs into a museum. In a flashback of season 5 episode \\"The Death of Vibe\\", it is shown that between 2018 and 2024, the Flash Museum will be inaugurated in the same building as the S.T.A.R. Labs, with Mr. Myles becoming its curator. *S.T.A.R. Labs makes multiple appearances in the 2019 series Doom Patrol. = Film =  Animated  * S.T.A.R. Labs makes an appearance in Justice League: Doom. After Superman is shot by a Kryptonite bullet, the Flash is sent to a S.T.A.R. Labs facility in Kyoto, Japan, where they are making a Kryptonite scalpel (this being the only tool that could allow doctors to operate and remove the bullet). The scalpel ends up being unnecessary, as Batman has Cyborg use his blaster filtered through a piece of Kryptonite crystal to serve as a cutting laser and Martian Manhunter uses his shape-shifting abilities to remove the bullet. * In Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox, Superman tells Batman and Flash that he will take Professor Zoom to S.T.A.R. Labs after they successfully remove Zoom's 25th century bombs off the Rogues. However, this version of S.T.A.R Labs appears to be in the Watchtower after Superman is seen taking Professor Zoom towards the sky. * S.T.A.R. Labs first makes an appearance in Justice League: War when Victor Stone goes there after a football game to confront his father as to his absence during the game. Captain Marvel later returns several Parademons to S.T.A.R Labs through the whole in the roof shortly after the creation of Cyborg. It is shown again at the end of the movie while it is under repair. * S.T.A.R.

Its superior border is the inferior frontal sulcus (which divides it from the middle frontal gyrus), its inferior border is the lateral sulcus (which divides it from the superior temporal gyrus) and its posterior border is the inferior precentral sulcus. Above it is the middle frontal gyrus, behind it is the precentral gyrus. photos on p526 & p.546 The inferior frontal gyrus is the location of Broca's area, which is involved in language processing and speech production. Structure The inferior frontal gyrus is highly convoluted and has three cytoarchitecturally diverse regions. The three subdivisions are an opercular part, a triangular part, and an orbital part. These divisions are marked by two rami arising from the lateral sulcus. The ascending ramus separates the opercular and triangular parts. The anterior (horizontal) ramus separates the triangular and orbital parts. * Opercular part of inferior frontal gyrus (pars opercularis), (cortex posterior to the ascending ramus of the lateral sulcus), is the part of frontal lobe that overlies the insular cortex and may be associated with recognizing a tone of voice in spoken native languages. This expands on previous work indicating that comprehension of inflectional morpheme processing is associated with the inferior frontal gyrus. * Triangular part of inferior frontal gyrus (pars triangularis), (cortex between the ascending ramus and the horizontal ramus of the lateral sulcus). It may be associated with the ability to translate from a secondary or tertiary language back to one's native language. * Orbital part of inferior frontal gyrus (pars orbitalis) (cortex inferior and anterior to the horizontal ramus of the lateral sulcus) Cytoarchitecturally the opercular part of the inferior frontal gyrus is known as Brodmann area 44 (BA44). The triangular part of the inferior frontal gyrus is known as Brodmann area 45 (BA45), and the orbital part of the inferior frontal gyrus is known as Brodmann area 47. The opercular part and the triangular part (BA44 and BA45) make up Broca's area.  Function  The inferior frontal gyrus has a number of functions including the processing of speech and language in Broca's area. Neural circuitry has been shown to connect different sites of stimulus to other regions of response including other subdivisions and also other frontal gyri. =Language processing= The left opercular part of the inferior frontal gyrus is a part of the articulatory network involved in motor syllable programs. The articulatory network also contains the premotor cortex, and the anterior insula. These areas are interrelated but have specific functions in speech comprehension and production. The articulatory network acts mostly when the vocal tract moves to produce syllables. The pars opercularis acts indirectly through the motor cortex to control the motor aspect of speech production, and codes motor programs for this system, while the auditory cortex (via the temporoparietal junction in the lateral sulcus (Sylvian fissure) houses a series of sensory targets. Together, these areas function as a sensory-motor loop for syllable information coding. In a study conducted comparing phonological and arithmetic processing and the involvement of different sections of the inferior frontal gyrus and angular gyrus, cortical activation for phonology, subtraction, and multiplication tasks was compared. The predetermined language-calculation network was limited to the left inferior frontal gyrus, angular gyrus, superior parietal lobule, and the horizontal portion of the intraparietal sulcus. The results were significant to support that there was a pattern of left lateralization for each of these tasks all activating the Perisylvian fissure network, with some general localized areas for phonology and arithmetic. It was supported that phonology activated the pars opercularis (BA44), and anterior angular gyrus, multiplication mainly implicated the pars triangularis (BA45), and the posterior angular gyrus. These systems are activated through similar neuronal processes but independently placed along the network. =Language comprehension and production= Most language processing takes place in Broca's area usually in the left hemisphere.The \\"dominant inferior frontal convolution\\" ‚Äî. p.1055 Damage to this region often results in a type of non- fluent aphasia known as Broca's aphasia. Broca's area is made up of the pars opercularis and the pars triangularis, both of which contribute to verbal fluency, but each has its own specific contribution. The pars opercularis (BA44) is involved in language production and phonological processing due to its connections with motor areas of the mouth and tongue. The pars triangularis (BA45) is involved in semantic processing. Characteristics of Broca's aphasia include agrammatic speech, relatively good language comprehension, poor repetition, and difficulty speaking mostly uttering short sentences made up mostly of nouns. The left IFG has also been suggested to play a role in inhibitory processes, including the tendency to inhibit learning from undesirable information. For example, transcranial magnetic stimulation to the left IFG has been shown to release such inhibition, increasing the ability to learn from undesirable information.Sharot, T., Kanai, R., Marston, D., Korn, C. W., Rees, G. & Dolan, R.J. (2012) Selectively Altering Belief Formation in the Human Brain. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 109 (42), 17058‚Äì17062. The right opercular part of the IFG, (BA44) has been implicated in go/no go tasks. In these tasks, the participant encounters a preliminary task (for instance repeatedly pressing a button), and then must halt this task whenever a \\"no go\\" signal is presented, ultimately measuring a level of impulse control through inhibition of a prepotent response. It seems that the same area is also implicated in risk aversion: a study found that higher risk aversion correlated with higher activity at IFG. This might be explained as an inhibition signal to accept a risky option. Disruption of activity of this area with transcranial direct- current stimulation (tDCS) leads to change in risk attitudes, as behaviorally demonstrated by choices over risky outcomes.

According to the RCMP, the ERT \\"is a group of highly-trained RCMP members capable of employing specialized weapons, equipment, and tactics to resolve extremely high-risk situations.\\" The ERT is also mandated to assess the situation and determine whether extreme danger or the presence of small arms cannot be easily resolved by RCMP officers on general duties or by other police forces throughout Canada. The ERT offers consulting services to its fellow officers such as firearms files and shootings that involve police officers. ERTs operate as a floating work-site team, which allows them to be called up for duty from their residences and not in an RCMP office. They also operate under a threat-based priority system if multiple emergency calls require ERT presence. ERT teams are legally bound to operate in Canada and overseas when required. History The RCMP established the ERT in 1977 in 31 centres throughout Canada, which operates under a geographical basis.Kelly and Hays, Page 48. The creation of the ERT was modeled after the RCMP's Hostage Assault and Rescue Program. Because of the problem in geography, which prevents the RCMP from pooling their resources to respond to a Canada-wide incident, the Canadian government initially mandated the creation of the Special Emergency Response Team or SERT on January 22, 1986 with 51 officers being trained for SERT duties as the unit would operate in circumstances where local police forces do not have enough resources to resolve the incident. The SERT was eventually disbanded in 1993 since they were not suited for quasi- military operations with problems on whether lethal force is necessary or not, given its RCMP status. The Marine Security Emergency Response Teams were created as a part of the ERT in 2006 with initial training in the waters of British Columbia as a key component of the Critical Incident Program to ensure ERT operators are fully prepared to respond to calls when a situation develops in the marine environment. MSERT teams were involved in protecting participants and the public during the 2010 Winter Games in Vancouver, BC. The ERT received armoured vehicles from the RCMP as a means of bolstering their effectiveness in the field. Surplus AVGP Cougars were handed to the ERTs in 2010 as a means of transporting ERT operators in situation where firearms are known to be involved. These vehicles are used without any turrets or other offensive weapons as they were removed prior to ERT adoption since they are used for transportation purposes only. They were first used by RCMP ERT teams to bust a drug grow op in Chilliwack, BC. In 2012, the RCMP and Navistar Defense Canada Inc. worked together to create their own armoured vehicles for the ERTs when RCMP Assistant Commissioner Russ Mirasty, commanding officer of the RCMP‚Äôs for F division in Saskatchewan, unveiled them to the public. Known as the Tactical Armored Vehicle, these were made at the cost of $USD14,019,826.74 with a working lifespan of 15 years. 18 TAVs were delivered to various ERTs throughout Canada as their main support vehicle when on call. Qualifications Prospective male and female ERT operator candidates are required to have two years of operational experience in the RCMP, as well as to score a total of 225 or more at their PPC qualifications. ERT operator candidates are also required to attend to psychological evaluations to weed out candidates who have problems working in environments that involve confined spaces, height or water. Candidates are allowed into ERT operational service once he or she completes a nine-week ERT course in Ottawa, which consists of theoretical, firearms and tactical training. ERT operators are required to do training when not on duty, which consist of daily training for full-time ERT operators and a minimum of two days for part-time ERT operators. Training RCMP MSERT operators detain individuals in a simulated illegal migrant vessel in a training exercise as a part of Exercise Frontier Sentinel 2012 in Sydney, Nova Scotia. Before the timed obstacle was implemented on April 1, 2009, ERT operator candidates are required to pass a physical training exam that consists of a 1.5 mile run in 10 minutes, 60 consecutive and uninterrupted pushups, 60 sit-ups in one minute, 5 wide-grip pull-ups and bench press with a weight of 175 pounds. ERT training consists of three blocks. They consist of the following: * Block 1: Firearms / Rappelling * Block 2: Rural patrol tactics * Block 3: Interior combat / CQB Additional training courses, such as the Sniper / Observer course, the Aircraft assault course and the basic and advanced Marine Operations courses, are open to ERT operators once they are officially admitted. These advanced courses are overseen by the National Tactical Training Section. Weapons SIG Sauer P226 ERT operators have access to the following small arms, which are standardized by the National Policy Centre for all ERT teams for operational purposes: * SIG Sauer P226, being used as the main sidearm to replace the Smith & Wesson 5946. * Heckler & Koch MP5A3 SMG * Remington Model 700P Sniper rifle * Remington Model 870 Shotgun * Colt Canada C8 Carbine Duties The duties of the ERT include the following: * Resolving incidents involving armed & barricaded persons * Aircraft interventions * Marine interventions (armed ship boarding) * High- risk searches & arrests * High-risk prisoner transport * VIP & witness protection duties * Covert surveillance and intelligence gathering * Rural tracking operations Operations G20 summit, June 2010 From August 1995 to September 1995 RCMP ERT was involved in the Gustafsen Lake Standoff. In September, 2007 the RCMP ERT rescued a three-year-old child from a man who had fired numerous shots in a house in Chilliwack, British Columbia. In June 2010, RCMP ERT officers assisted with the G20 Summit in Toronto, ON. In March, 2011 the RCMP ERT responded to a residence in Surrey, BC where a 13-year-old girl had been shot in the back and the house set on fire. The girl ran from the house to a nearby school. Believing the shooter and additional young victims were in the residence, ERT officers forced their way into the house while it was still on fire. The shooter was located inside with an apparent self- inflicted gunshot wound. ERT officers provided CPR at scene until BCAS paramedics arrived, however the shooter later died. Controversies The ERT was found to be justified in shooting Delbert Kenneth Pelletier at the Muskowekwan First Nation in Melville, Saskatchewan. ERT was deployed to the area on November 13, 2006 due to reports of Pelletier being armed with a gun while acting irrational and suicidal. Pelletier's wife fled the residence prior to police arrival. Pelletier was shot by police snipers shortly after Pelletier shot at a police vehicle, striking the door but not injuring any of the officers inside. Among the recommendations made after the inquiry include cultural relations training, including the presence of an elder's program at the RCMP Depot before ERTs would be officially deployed. Bob Hrycan, a lawyer for Calvin and Fisher Pelletier, accuses the RCMP of conducting excessive force. The Pelletier family has made calls for a wider probe into the shooting death of Delbert Pelletier. In 2009, ERT tactical gear was reported to be stolen in Kamloops, BC. No weapons or firearms were taken. Some of items that were permanently missing are now believed to have been sold/bought in the underground black market. ERT operators were involved in the shooting death of ex-Canadian soldier Gregory Matters in 2012, who was reported to be using a hatchet before he was shot in Prince George, BC. An investigation conducted by the BC Independent Investigations Office. The Commission for Public Complaints Against the RCMP has launched an official inquiry into the death as well. The RCMP was found to be justified in the shooting after the investigations.

Orin Cornett (November 13, 1913 ‚Äì December 7, 2002) was an American physicist, university professor and administrator, and the inventor of a literacy system for the deaf, known as Cued Speech. Biography R. (Richard) Orin Cornett was born in Driftwood, Oklahoma, a now unincorporated town near the Kansas border located in Alfalfa County, on November 14, 1913. He earned his BS degree in Mathematics from Oklahoma Baptist University in 1934, followed by an MS from the University of Oklahoma in 1937. In 1940, Cornett was awarded a Ph.D. in physics and applied mathematics from the University of Texas at Austin, with his thesis entitled, ‚ÄúAcoustic Spectra of Edge Tones.‚Äù From 1935 to 1945, Dr. Cornett taught physics, mathematics, and electronics at Oklahoma Baptist, Penn State, and Harvard Universities. In 1959, Cornett became the Director of the Division of Higher Education at the U.S. Office of Education. While in that position, upon the review of funding for Gallaudet College (present-day Gallaudet University), he was appalled to discover that most deaf persons had below grade level reading skills and fail to achieve literacy at a native-level. In 1965, Cornett accepted a position as the Vice President of Long-Range Planning at Gallaudet. While serving there, he devised a phonemic system which rendered the English language visually, rather than acoustically, to address the issue of deaf literacy. He called this novel system Cued Speech. The invention of Cued Speech in 1966 opened a new field within deaf education. His Cued Speech system was based on the hypothesis that if all the sounds in the spoken language could clearly be made to look different from each other coming from the lips of the speaker, those who were hearing impaired would learn a language in much the same way as a hearing person, but through the use of their vision rather than acoustically. Of the system, Cornett stated, \\"A few months of study convinced me that the underlying cause of their (deaf persons) reading problem was the lack of any reasonable way to learn spoken language, without which they could not use speech for communication, become good lipreaders, or learn to read (as opposed to being taught the recognition of each written word). So, I really started with the conclusion that what was needed was a convenient way to represent the spoken language accurately, through vision, in real time. That was the problem I set out to solve, the perceived need that set my direction.‚Äù From 1975 to 1984, he became Research Professor and director of Cued Speech Programs. From 1981 to 1983, he also served as Gallaudet's Chairman of the Center for Studies in Language and Communication. During Cornett's tenure there, he adapted his Cued Speech system to 52 languages and major dialects, while writing and publishing audiocassette lessons in 34 of those languages and dialects. Upon his retirement in 1984, Gallaudet University awarded him the status of Professor emeritus. He continued working with the international Cued Speech community from his Maryland home after his retirement. During his career, Cornett wrote and published hundreds of articles as well as several books on mathematics, physics, higher education, deaf education, Cued Speech and other subjects. He also served as editor of several publications, including the parental guidebook Cued Speech Resource Book for Parents of Deaf Children (). Cornett died on December 17, 2002, in Laurel, Maryland, at the age of 89. His wife of 59 years, Lorene, had died on January 21 of the same year. Recognition Cornett‚Äôs achievements include three honorary doctorates: the 1963 Award for Outstanding Alumni Achievement from Oklahoma Baptist University, the 1988 Nitchie Award in Human Communications from the New York League for the Hard of Hearing, and the Distinguished Service Award of the National Council on Communication Disorders awarded in 1992. Cornett has been listed in the Marquis Who's Who in America continuously since 1956, and is also in Who‚Äôs Who in the World, Who Knows and What, American Men of Science, The Blue Book: Leaders of the English-Speaking World as well as several other biographical dictionaries.

Originally, the magazine was named InQuest and focused solely on collectible card games (CCGs); InQuest, along with its competitor Scrye, were the two major CCG magazines. Later, the magazine changed its focus to cover a wider range of games, including role-playing games, computer and video games, collectible miniature games, board games, and others. The magazine was published by Wizard Entertainment (not to be confused with Wizards of the Coast, which produced its own CCG magazine, The Duelist). History and profile InQuest #0, the first issue, was published in April 1995. For issue #46 (February 1999), InQuest changed its name to InQuest Gamer (with Gamer in large text on the cover), clearly announcing that it was a magazine about games. Issue #53 made the InQuest title more prominent on the cover again and it had not been changed since then, though the cover's format was revamped with issue #122. Typical content included news, strategy articles, a price guide for collectible card and miniature games, reference lists, and game-related entertainment and humor. Issues with special cards were mailed in plastic bags, issues without special cards were typically sold at retail stores and game shows without any special covering. The magazine's editorial staff included Mike Searle, Tom Slizewski, Jeff Hannes, Brent Fishbaugh, Steve Frohnhoefer, Paul Sudlow, Jeremy Smith, Thorin McGee, Kyle Ackerman, Alex Shvartsman and Rick Swan. Martin A. Stever was responsible for the magazine's sales and marketing. Because it was first published about two years after the release of Magic: The Gathering, the trading card game was one of InQuest's main topics. InQuest was frequently home to fictional cards, including \\"purple\\" cards featured in issue #22 (February 1997). These hypothetical cards, which used a new \\"Portal\\" land to create purple mana, led some to think that the then-upcoming Portal set would introduce a sixth color.

He was an officer in the American Revolutionary War, a delegate to the Confederation Congress, and member of the first United States House of Representatives. Early life Contee was the son of Col. Thomas Contee (1729‚Äì1811) and Sarah Fendall (1732‚Äì1793). He was born at \\"Brookefield\\", near Nottingham, Prince George's County, Maryland, the home of his father, and original home of his ancestor, Maj. Thomas Brooke, Sr., Esq. (1632‚Äì1676). Military and political career At beginning of the Revolutionary War, Contee entered the Continental Army, rising to the rank of captain of the 3rd Maryland Regiment, which proved to be one of the army's elite units until its near annihilation at the Battle of Camden. After the war he was elected to the Maryland House of Delegates, where he served from 1785 to 1787. He served as a delegate to the Confederation Congress from 1787 to 1788, and the third district of Maryland in the U.S. Congress from 1789 to 1791. Along with his brother Alexander Contee (1752‚Äì1810), he became a merchant of London, at their stores in Nottingham, Queen Anne and Upper Marlboro. He was declared insolvent due to ‚Äúmishaps in trade‚Äù. After having served in Congress, he went to Europe and traveled through Spain, France, and England. Marriage and children On April 8, 1788, he married his cousin, Sarah Russell Lee (1766‚Äì1810). Sarah was born at \\"Blenheim\\" in 1766, and died December 6, 1810 at \\"Bromont\\", near Newburg, Charles Co., Maryland. Sarah was the daughter of Philip Thomas Lee (1736‚Äì1778) and Ann Russell (died 1777) of England. The Contees' children were Sarah \\"Sallie\\" Elinor Contee (1789 ‚Äì c. 1815), Philip Ashton Lee Contee, Sr. (1795‚Äì1842), Edmund Henry Contee (1799‚Äì1832), and Alice Lee Contee (1803‚Äì1868), who married Gov. Joseph Kent. Episcopal minister On his return to America he completed his study in theology and was admitted to holy orders in 1803 by Rev. Thomas John Claggett, Bishop of Maryland, a neighbor, friend, helper and patriot of the Revolution. That same year he became rector of William & Mary's, Charles County. He was a distinguished minister of the Episcopal Church and for several years the incumbent of Port Tobacco Parish, Charles County, Maryland. He was a native of Prince George's County and brought up in the church. In 1808, he added Trinity, and in 1811, St. Paul's, Prince George's Co., Maryland, to his charge. He continued as a Judge of the Orphan's Court, and was always in the Standing Committee. Property Benjamin resided briefly in the mid-1790s at \\"Blenheim\\". At the time of his death he was living at the glebe house of Trinity Parish near Allen's Fresh. Benjamin and his wife were more than likely interred in the Contee cemetery at \\"Locust Hill\\" just outside Port Tobacco, which has been destroyed.

In mid-August 2005, Wizard announced that it would be pushing back the Atlanta convention until 2007.

It is a table cheese that can be sliced, grilled, or melted.  History  In the 1800s, Hanne Nielsen (1829‚Äì1903) traveled around Europe to learn about cheesemaking. Nielsen's farm was in Havarthigaard, north of Copenhagen, and in 1852, after returning from her travels, she developed the technique to create havarti, a semi-firm cheese dotted with small holes. The original havarti cheese is different from fl√∏dehavarti (\\"cream Havarti\\"), which is made from high-pasteurized milk, so that the whey proteins that would otherwise be eliminated during production remain in the curd. This raises yields, but alters the taste and texture. Cream havarti usually ripens very little, since the remaining whey proteins cause problems (off-taste, odd appearance) during prolonged ripening.  Description  Havarti is made like most cheeses, by introducing rennet to milk to cause curdling. The curds are pressed into cheese molds which are drained, and then the cheese is aged. Havarti was traditionally a smear-rind cheese, but modern fl√∏dehavarti is not. Havarti is a washed-curd cheese, which contributes to the subtle flavor of the cheese. Havarti is an interior-ripened cheese that is rindless, smooth, and slightly bright-surfaced with a cream to yellow color depending on type. It has very small and irregular openings called eyes distributed throughout. Havarti has a buttery aroma and can be somewhat sharp in the stronger varieties, much like Swiss cheese. The taste is buttery, from somewhat to very sweet, and slightly acidic. It is typically aged about three months, though when the cheese is older, it becomes more salty and tastes like hazelnut. When left at room temperature, the cheese tends to soften quickly. Flavored variants of havarti are available, such as cranberry, garlic, caraway, dill, basil, coconut, sour cream, chives, bacon, red pepper, and jalape√±o. Production In 2013 18,900 metric tons were produced in Denmark. As of 2019, 17,000 metric tons are produced annually in Denmark, of which 3,000 to 4,000 metric tons are consumed domestically. In 2015 17,700 metric tons were produced in Wisconsin and 7,400 in Canada. In 2018 Wisconsin produced 18,400 metric tons and Canada 7,500 metric tons. Less than half of the world production is made in Denmark. Other major producers in the EU are Germany and Spain. Internationally, the main producers are the United States and Canada, with other producing countries including Finland, Poland, France, Australia and New Zealand. In the United States the main producing state is by far Wisconsin, with other producing states being California, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Washington. The Danish multinational Arla Foods produces the cheese for the American market in Wisconsin from milk produced in Wisconsin. Havarti is one of twelve cheeses whose characteristics and manufacturing standards are registered in the Codex Alimentarius as of 2019. Consumption It has become a staple foodstuff in Denmark.

It may now only be produced from Danish milk and at approved dairies, for it to be sold in the EU and countries with which it has signed a trade agreement recognising EU PGI rules on cheese (specifically South Korea). There was vehement opposition and pressure from the US against recognition, which earlier compelled the EU to postpone the planned PGI status fearing it might be deemed too provocative amidst indications of a political backlash from the United States. The Consortium for Common Food Names (CCFN), an industry alliance based in Virginia, United States, representing exporting interests founded by the U.S. Dairy Export Council to fight EU geographical indication guidelines expressed outrage over the 2019 EU decision to reserve the name for Denmark, claiming the PGI status is not \\"legitimate intellectual property protection, but instead for barely concealed protectionism for economic gain\\". The United States, Australia, New Zealand, Uruguay and Argentina have joined with the CCFN to overturn the decision. The CCFN has claimed that havarti is a generic cheese, and that the EU is trying to \\"egregiously ... monopolise global trade\\" in this and many other traditional European products, and is disregarding \\"established international standards\\". The CCFN demands that EU PGIs are amended to include the name of the region where it is produced, such that only the name \\"Danish havarti\\" is protected, a proposal Danish producers are amenable to. Danish producers contend it is domestically well-known as a Danish cheese and knowledge of the cheese outside Denmark is \\"extremely limited\\". The CCFN has urged the Trump administration to sanction the EU for its \\"abuses\\".

centre, south of Filton, east of Horfield and west of Frenchay. Lockleaze is a residential area of social housing built on the western flank of Purdown on a north-south axis, that was initially separated from Horfield by the main Bristol to South Wales railway line. The suburb was developed immediately after World War II. Although much of the housing was owned by Bristol Corporation, some are now privately owned. The Lockleaze council ward was extended to include older Bristol council housing and the border with Horfield is the thoroughfare, Filton Avenue. Lockleaze school was designed by the city architect A.H. Clarke and built in 1954. It is an early example of 'Method Building' using pre-cast frame with pre-stressed floors and brick panel walling. The school closed in July 2004. St Mary's church dates from 1956 by T.H.B. Burrough. A microwave transmission tower, Purdown BT Tower, is located at Lockleaze and is known locally as the \\"Cups and Saucers\\". The distinctive tower, built in 1970, can be seen from many miles away. During World War II, an anti-aircraft gun emplacement, known locally as Purdown Purcy, was located on the down, the ruins of which remain today. History The BT tower at Purdown dominates much of Lockleaze The estate takes its name from Lockleaze Farm, which occupied the site. The name Lock Leaze comes from the Anglo-Saxon for a fold in a field or pasture. Lockleaze Farm stood roughly where Bonnington Walk is today, between Stothard Road, Branwhite Close and Thornycroft Close. The farm stood at the end of Lockleaze Lane, neither the lane nor the farm buildings remain today. Lockleaze Lane was a continuation of Berry Lane, which began at the junction between Gloucester Road and the present-day Muller Road, at Horfield Court Farm. The lane followed the route of Muller Road, Filton Avenue, Berry Lane and Chedworth Road, before crossing the gas works and crossing the railway at the present day Constable Road/Lockleaze Road bridge. On the south side of Chedworth Road stood Berry Lane Farm. As well as Lockleaze Farm there was also Purdown Farm which stands at the site of present-day Fairacre Close. The old farmhouse remained long after the houses were built at Haydon Gardens. Nearly all the roads in Lockleaze are named after painters, such as: Constable, Gainsborough, Blake, Hogarth and Nash. Amenities The hub of Lockleaze is Gainsborough Square, where parades of shops face onto the north and west sides of the Square. On the east side of the Square, a new Community Centre has been built named; The Hub. At the south side of the Square is the Church of St. Mary Magdalene with St. Francishe. The central green area of Gainsborough Square serves as a small park, with an enclosed child's play area. The nearest police station is on Southmead Road, in the neighbouring district of Southmead. Lockleaze once had its own police station on Gainsborough Square. A doctors surgery is located on Lockleaze Road. Lockleaze is served by a bus service operated by First West of England, with several bus stops throughout Lockleaze.

Lockleaze provided a backdrop in the 1962 film Some People directed by Clive Donner, starring Kenneth More, Angela Douglas and Ray Brooks. The film is about a youth worker (Kenneth More) trying to help a group of teenagers in Bristol. In the film, several Lockleaze landmarks were shown, including Purdown, the communication tower and the large gas holders which once stood just off Lockleaze Road.

The word circumsphere is sometimes used to mean the same thing.. As in the case of two-dimensional circumscribed circles, the radius of a sphere circumscribed around a polyhedron P is called the circumradius of P,. and the center point of this sphere is called the circumcenter of P.. Existence and optimality When it exists, a circumscribed sphere need not be the smallest sphere containing the polyhedron; for instance, the tetrahedron formed by a vertex of a cube and its three neighbors has the same circumsphere as the cube itself, but can be contained within a smaller sphere having the three neighboring vertices on its equator. However, the smallest sphere containing a given polyhedron is always the circumsphere of the convex hull of a subset of the vertices of the polyhedron.. In De solidorum elementis (circa 1630), Ren√© Descartes observed that, for a polyhedron with a circumscribed sphere, all faces have circumscribed circles, the circles where the plane of the face meets the circumscribed sphere. Descartes suggested that this necessary condition for the existence of a circumscribed sphere is sufficient, but it is not true: some bipyramids, for instance, can have circumscribed circles for their faces (all of which are triangles) but still have no circumscribed sphere for the whole polyhedron. However, whenever a simple polyhedron has a circumscribed circle for each of its faces, it also has a circumscribed sphere. Related concepts The circumscribed sphere is the three-dimensional analogue of the circumscribed circle. All regular polyhedra have circumscribed spheres, but most irregular polyhedra do not have one, since in general not all vertices lie on a common sphere. The circumscribed sphere (when it exists) is an example of a bounding sphere, a sphere that contains a given shape. It is possible to define the smallest bounding sphere for any polyhedron, and compute it in linear time. Other spheres defined for some but not all polyhedra include a midsphere, a sphere tangent to all edges of a polyhedron, and an inscribed sphere, a sphere tangent to all faces of a polyhedron. In the regular polyhedra, the inscribed sphere, midsphere, and circumscribed sphere all exist and are concentric.. When the circumscribed sphere is the set of infinite limiting points of hyperbolic space, a polyhedron that it circumscribes is known as an ideal polyhedron.

In geometry, the inscribed sphere or insphere of a convex polyhedron is a sphere that is contained within the polyhedron and tangent to each of the polyhedron's faces. It is the largest sphere that is contained wholly within the polyhedron, and is dual to the dual polyhedron's circumsphere. The radius of the sphere inscribed in a polyhedron P is called the inradius of P. Interpretations All regular polyhedra have inscribed spheres, but most irregular polyhedra do not have all facets tangent to a common sphere, although it is still possible to define the largest contained sphere for such shapes. For such cases, the notion of an insphere does not seem to have been properly defined and various interpretations of an insphere are to be found: * The sphere tangent to all faces (if one exists). * The sphere tangent to all face planes (if one exists). * The sphere tangent to a given set of faces (if one exists). * The largest sphere that can fit inside the polyhedron. Often these spheres coincide, leading to confusion as to exactly what properties define the insphere for polyhedra where they do not coincide. For example, the regular small stellated dodecahedron has a sphere tangent to all faces, while a larger sphere can still be fitted inside the polyhedron. Which is the insphere? Important authorities such as Coxeter or Cundy & Rollett are clear enough that the face-tangent sphere is the insphere. Again, such authorities agree that the Archimedean polyhedra (having regular faces and equivalent vertices) have no inspheres while the Archimedean dual or Catalan polyhedra do have inspheres. But many authors fail to respect such distinctions and assume other definitions for the 'inspheres' of their polyhedra.

Known for her naturally large breasts, she went on to feature in a wide range of adult magazines, websites, broadcast media, and videos, including hardcore pornography productions after 2000. She has attained minor celebrity status in the United Kingdom, where she has appeared on a number of mainstream television programmes, such as They Think It's All Over, I'm Famous and Frightened!, The Weakest Link, and Celebrity Four Weddings. She has also appeared in documentaries about the lives of glamour models and was featured in Martin Gooch's 2002 film Arthur's Amazing Things. Early life Linsey Dawn McKenzie was born in Brent, Middlesex, and she grew up in Wallington, Surrey. She is the youngest of three children; her parents, Tony and Lesley McKenzie, divorced in 1987. Career In early 1994, when McKenzie was 15, she sent sample glamour photographs to local modelling agencies. She began her modelling career glamour modelling and swimsuit work, intending to progress to topless modelling when she turned 16 later that year.At the time, under the Protection of Children Act of 1978, 16-year-olds could still legally model topless in the United Kingdom; the legal minimum age was raised to 18 by the Sexual Offences Act of 2003. Linsey Dawn McKenzie at Erotica LA in 2006 As McKenzie approached her 16th birthday, the Sunday Sport tabloid newspaper expressed an interest in turning her topless debut into a media event. Throughout June and July 1994, it published pictures of McKenzie counting down the days until it could legally show her topless. After she turned 16, McKenzie continued to model topless for the Daily Sport and the Sunday Sport. She also made Page 3 girl appearances in tabloid newspapers The Sun and The Daily Star; posed topless in lads' mags such as Loaded; appeared fully nude in British magazines such as MayfairMayfair, Vol. 30, Issue 3 (March 1995) and Men Only;Men Only Vol. 60, Issue 12 (December 1995) and performed in a variety of softcore videos. On 29 July 1995, shortly before her 17th birthday, McKenzie did a topless streak at a televised England v. West Indies cricket match at Old Trafford. Wearing only a thong and a pair of trainers, she ran onto the field with the words \\"Only Teasing\\" written across her breasts. After McKenzie turned 18 in 1996, she made her North American modelling debut in the breast fetishism magazine Score, which marked the occasion by making McKenzie the cover girl of its December 1996 \\"50th Anniversary\\" issue.Graham, John, \\"Linsey: She's Finally Legal, and Now Everybody Can Enjoy This 18-Year-Old International Superstar!\\" Score, Volume 5, Issue 12, pg. 22‚Äì30 (December 1996) In the late 1990s, McKenzie was frequently featured on the adult-oriented channels L!VE TV and Television X. She continued to appear regularly in magazines, DVDs, Internet sites, and broadcast media until late 2004, when she took a break from modelling to have a child and undergo a breast reduction operation. A biography of McKenzie, Temptress: The Linsey Dawn McKenzie Story, was published in 2015. Appearances McKenzie at AVN Adult Entertainment Expo in 2011 McKenzie's mainstream television appearances include the BBC sporting quiz show They Think It's All Over, the reality television shows I'm Famous and Frightened! and The Salon, and the science programme Brainiac: Science Abuse. In the United States, she appeared on The Howard Stern Show in January 2003. On 8 September 2007, she appeared on a special charity edition of the BBC quiz show The Weakest Link, on which all contestants were glamour models who were dating or married to footballers. In December 2010, she featured with her husband Mark Williams on an episode of Living TV's Celebrity Four Weddings. The episode also featured actress Tina Malone, Big Brother contestant Spencer Smith and magician Paul Daniels and his wife, Debbie McGee. Additionally, McKenzie has appeared in two documentaries about the lives of glamour models, The Curse of Page 3 and Girls Behaving Badly. She also played the character Beryl Fforbes-Juggs in Martin Gooch's 2002 film Arthur's Amazing Things. Personal life In 1996, McKenzie became involved in an extramarital affair with 27-year-old footballer Dean Holdsworth, who was then a striker for Wimbledon F.C. The relationship received widespread attention in the British media. In 1998, she became engaged to actor Michael Greco, who at the time was playing the role of Beppe di Marco in the BBC soap opera EastEnders. She twice became pregnant over the course of her 15-month relationship with Greco, but miscarried both times. McKenzie began dating 21-year-old Terry Canty in 2000. The couple married on 21 April 2001 and Canty performed with McKenzie in her first heterosexual hardcore photoshoots and video. Scenes featuring the couple were released on the 2001 DVD Ultimate Linsey. The couple separated six weeks after their wedding, and they divorced in 2001. In 2004, McKenzie began a relationship with former Wimbledon F.C. and Northern Ireland footballer Mark Williams. On 16 May 2005, she gave birth to the couple's baby boy. McKenzie married Williams on 5 January 2006.

The form is approved line by line by governments: \\"Negotiations occur over wording to ensure accuracy, balance, clarity of message, and relevance to understanding and policy.\\"\\"The SPM was approved line by line by governments in a major meeting, which took place over four days in Shanghai, China, in January 2001. The argument here is that the scientists determine what can said, but the governments determine how it can best be said. Negotiations occur over wording to ensure accuracy, balance, clarity of message, and relevance to understanding and policy. In Shanghai, there were about 100 countries represented by delegations, perhaps 10 non-governmental organizations, and about 42 scientists.\\" The IPCC Assessment of Global Warming 2001 Process The IPCC is divided into 3 \\"Working Groups\\" (WG) covering a section of the human-caused climate change topic: * Working Group I (WGI): The Physical Science Basis. * Working Group II (WGII): Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability * Working Group III (WGIII): Mitigation of Climate Change Approximately every 5 years, each Working Group prepares a full \\"assessment report\\" by collating all the available research results. Before the end of this period, a selection of about 50 scientists within each Working Group produces a first draft \\"Summary for policymakers\\" (SPM) summarizing its section of the full assessment report. This first draft SPM is sent for comments to the participating government. Comments are taken into account in a second draft prepared by the scientists. When the full assessment report is finalized, each second draft SPM is then reviewed during a four days plenary session comprising government delegations and observer organizations.List of organizations admitted to the IPCC plenary sessions Each reviewing session is chaired by the scientists chairing the Working Group, surrounded by a panel of scientists. The government delegations usually consist of one to six delegates, comprising generally a mix of national experts (some of which are part of the IPCC) and a few diplomats or other non-scientist civil servants. The objective of the review session is to improve the form of the SPM, which must remain faithful to the scientific content of the full assessment report. This process also results in some form of endorsement by the participating governments. For the Fourth Assessment SPMs, each review lasted three days. The beginning of the first day was open to journalists and started with introductory speeches (from the IPCC President, local politicians...). Then each sentence of the draft SPM, displayed on a giant screen, was discussed at length by the delegates and often ended up completely rewritten. Some paragraphs were removed and others are added, under the full control of the Chair and its panel of scientist who ensured that every sentence strictly conforms to the content of the full assessment. When the discussion on a sentence lasted too long, a subgroup chaired by a scientist was formed to craft aside a revised text for later submission to the plenary. Generally the process was very slow at the beginning: in some cases, as little as a few paragraphs were reviewed at the end of the first day. The review generally ended late in the night of the third day - sometimes even in the next morning. On the fourth day, the reviewed SPM was released during a closing session open to journalists. Support for the IPCC process Further information: Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change#Endorsements of the IPCC The IPCC process has received widespread support and praise from major scientific bodies. In 2001, a joint statement on climate change was made by sixteen national academies of science. The IPCC process was supported by these academies: > The work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) represents > the consensus of the international scientific community on climate change > science. We recognise IPCC as the world‚Äôs most reliable source of > information on climate change and its causes, and we endorse its method of > achieving this consensus. Some IPCC authors have expressed their personal support for the process that produces the Summary for Policymakers document. John Houghton, who was formerly a co-chair of IPCC Working Group I,Preface , in has stated: > It is important to note that IPCC Policymakers‚Äô Summaries are agreed > unanimously at intergovernmental meetings involving over 200 government > delegates from around 100 countries. This agreement is only achieved after > several days of scientific debate (only scientific arguments not political > ones are allowed) the main purpose of which is to challenge the scientific > chapter authors regarding the accuracy, clarity and relevance of the summary > and most especially its consistency with the underlying chapters. Agreement > at such a meeting has ensured that the resulting document, so far as is > possible, is scientifically accurate, balanced and free from personal or > political bias. Martin Parry, co-chair of the IPCC Working Group II Fourth Assessment Report, has said: > The SPM is chewed over for some days (and sometimes nights) by the panel; > and it is this process that has sometimes brought criticism from a few > scientists who have questioned how much this government involvement alters > the meaning of the scientists' conclusions. > I do not think it does; Plenary might alter some nuances, but the key > conclusions of the assessments remain intact. IPCC author Terry Barker has commented on the IPCC process and Summary for Policymakers document: > My impressions of the IPCC process is that it is an open, highly innovative > and progressive means to address the issue, namely the organisation of the > scientific policy-relevant advice to governments of an evolving, complex and > highly contentious topic.[...] > My experience in the 2001 [IPCC] process was that political considerations > inevitably play a role in the development of the SPM, since governments will > not necessarily agree with the scientific consensus expressed in the initial > drafts of the [Summary for Policymakers] SPM. Since there is always some > uncertainty in the scientific findings, reasons can always be found to > qualify or remove unpalatable conclusions. Whether the political > considerations introduce a large gap between what the authors say in the > Report and what appears in the SPM is a matter of opinion. US National Research Council comments In 2001, the Bush Administration asked the US National Research Council to produce a report on climate change. The committee writing this report was asked, among other things, to comment on the IPCC Working Group I Third Assessment Report and its Summary for Policymakers: > The committee finds that the full IPCC Working Group I (WGI) report is an > admirable summary of research activities in climate science, and the full > report is adequately summarized in the Technical Summary. The full WGI > report and its Technical Summary are not specifically directed at policy. > The Summary for Policymakers reflects less emphasis on communicating the > basis for uncertainty and a stronger emphasis on areas of major concern > associated with human-induced climate change. This change in emphasis > appears to be the result of a summary process in which scientists work with > policy makers on the document. Written responses from U.S. coordinating and > lead scientific authors to the committee indicate, however, that (a) no > changes were made without the consent of the convening lead authors (this > group represents a fraction of the lead and contributing authors) and (b) > most changes that did occur lacked significant impact. Debate about Working Group I's 2001 summary IPCC authors Kevin E. Trenberth and Richard Lindzen have criticized past editions of the SPM, alleging that the summary does not completely represent the full report. However, their criticisms were diametrically opposite: Trenberth arguing that the summary diluted the main report, Lindzen arguing that it was too alarmist. Kevin E. Trenberth, a lead author of the 2001 IPCC Working Group I report, wrote: > The rationale here is that the scientists determine what can be said, but > the governments determine how it can best be said.. ... The IPCC process is > dependent on the good will of the participants in producing a balanced > assessment.

Available in text and PDF formats. Also available as a PDF from Professor Lindzen's website. Among his criticisms, Lindzen has stated that the WGI Summary for Policymakers (SPM) does not faithfully summarize the full WGI report. > The report is prefaced by a policymakers' summary written by the editor, Sir > John Houghton, director of the United Kingdom Meteorological Office. His > summary largely ignores the uncertainty in the report and attempts to > present the expectation of substantial warming as firmly based science. Lindzen has stated that the SPM understates the uncertainty associated with climate models. John Houghton has responded to Lindzen's criticisms of the SPM. , p.4. Houghton has stressed that the SPM is agreed upon by delegates from many of the world's governments, and that any changes to the SPM must be supported by scientific evidence (see above).

The D-pad (cross shape on left) first came to prominence on the controller for the Famicom. Sega Master System D-pad providing eight- directional buttons. A D-pad (short for directional pad or digital pad; also known as control pad) is a flat, usually thumb-operated, often digital, four- way directional control with one button on each point, found on nearly all modern video game console gamepads, game controllers, on the remote control units of some television and DVD players, and smart phones. Like early video game joysticks, the vast majority of D-pads are digital; in other words, only the directions provided on the D-pad buttons can be used, with no intermediate values. However, combinations of two directions (up and left, for example) do provide diagonals and many modern D-pads can be used to provide eight- directional input if appropriate. Although digital pads offer less flexibility than analog sticks, they can easily be manipulated (requiring little movement of the thumb) with very high accuracy. They are also far less demanding in maintenance and do not protrude very far from the controller, making them ideal for portable consoles such as the Game Boy, Nintendo DS and the PlayStation Portable. D-pads have appeared on other kinds of electronic equipment, including A/V remote controls (especially since the appearance of DVD players, which are heavily menu driven), calculators, PDAs, smartphones, and car stereos such as the AutoPC.  History  A precursor to the D-pad was the four directional buttons used in arcade games such as UPL's Blockade (1976) and SNK's Vanguard (1981).Matt Barton & Bill Loguidice, The History of Robotron: 2084 - Running Away While Defending Humanoids, Gamasutra A precursor to the standard D-pad on a video game console was used by the Intellivision, which was released by Mattel Electronics in 1980. The Intellivision's unique controller featured the first alternative to a joystick on a home console, a rotating circular pad that allowed for 16 directions of movement by pressing it with the thumb. A precursor to the D-pad also appeared on Entex's short lived \\"Select A Game\\" cartridge based handheld system; it featured non- connected raised left, right, up and down buttons aligned to the left of a row of action buttons. Similar directional buttons were also used on the Atari Game Brain, the unreleased precursor to the Atari 2600, and on some early dedicated game consoles such as the VideoMaster Star Chess game. A controller similar to the D-pad appeared in 1981 on a handheld game system: Cosmic Hunter on Milton Bradley's Microvision; it was operated using the thumb to manipulate the onscreen character in one of four directions.Sony's PlayStation Portable and Milton Bradley's Microvision - The PSP and the History of Handheld Video Gaming, Part 2, Niko Silvester, about.com. Accessed on line June 7, 2010. Nintendo's known \\"cross\\" design was developed in 1982 by Gunpei Yokoi for their Donkey Kong handheld game. The design proved to be popular for subsequent Game & Watch titles, although the previously introduced non- connected D-pad style was still utilized on various later Game & Watch titles, including the Super Mario Bros. handheld game. This particular design was patented and later earned a Technology & Engineering Emmy Award. In 1984, the Japanese company Epoch created a handheld game system called the Epoch Game Pocket Computer. It featured a D-pad, but it was not popular for its time and soon faded. Initially intended to be a compact controller for the Game & Watch handheld games alongside the prior non-connected style pad, Nintendo realized that Yokoi's updated design would also be appropriate for regular consoles, and Nintendo made the D-pad the standard directional control for the hugely successful Famicom/Nintendo Entertainment System under the name \\"+Control Pad\\". All major video game consoles since have had a D-pad of some shape on their controllers, until the Nintendo Switch in 2017, which used the older four-button design on its included Joy-Con controller. To avoid infringing on Nintendo's patent, most controller manufacturers use a cross in a circle shape for the D-pad. Sega coined the term \\"D button\\" to describe the pad, using the term when describing the controllers for the Sega Genesis in instruction manuals and other literature. Arcade games, however, have largely continued using joysticks. Modern consoles, beginning with the Nintendo 64, provide both a D-pad and a compact thumb-operated analog stick; depending on the game, one type of control may be more appropriate than the other. In many cases with games that use a thumbstick, the D-pad is used as a set of extra buttons, all four usually centered on a kind of task, such as using items. Even without an analog stick, some software uses the D-pad's 8-directional capabilities to act as eight discrete buttons, not related to direction or on-screen movement at all. Jam Sessions for the Nintendo DS, for example, uses the D-pad to select music chords during play.  On non-gaming equipment  D-pads appear on a number of menu-driven devices as a simple navigational tool; though superficially similar to those used for gaming devices, they are not optimized for real-time control and therefore can usually accept input from only one direction at a time. Many, though not all, such designs include a trigger button in the center of the button arrangement, usually labeled \\"Enter\\", \\"OK\\", or the like. Some older devices do not have d-pads as such, but simple single- axis, up/down or left/right pads. On some remotes, the d-pad can also be used to control a robot using a signal-compatible receiver. On remote control devices, the buttons on the d-pad function in the same manner as other buttons, and are generally used to navigate on-screen menus. Though initially not common, the quick success of the DVD format led to wide availability of remote designs with D-pads circa 2000, and most current menu-driven consumer electronics devices include some sort of d-pad on the remote (and, occasionally, on the unit itself). In addition, many small computing and communications devices, particularly PDAs, mobile phones, and GPS receivers, include d-pads not only for menu navigation but as general input devices similar to a joystick or mouse. Less-sophisticated designs similar to those on remote controls appear on some calculators, particularly scientific and graphing calculators, which use the d-pad for cursor control on multi-line screens, as well as input/output recall, menu navigation, and occasionally direct screen access (graphing calculators in particular allow the use of the d-pad to determine values at specific points on a displayed graph).

The meat is usually thinned by pounding with a meat tenderizer. Most commonly, the meats are breaded before frying. The breaded schnitzel is popular in many countries and made using veal, pork, chicken, mutton, beef, turkey, cheese or textured vegetable protein as a vegetarian or vegan alternative. It is very similar to the dish escalope in France, tonkatsu in Japan, and the milanesa of Italy, Mexico, Uruguay, Paraguay, Argentina, Brazil and chicken fried steak of the American South.

Each slice is dipped into beaten eggs, seasoned with salt, and other ingredients according to the cook's taste (like parsley and garlic). Each slice is then dipped in bread crumbs (or occasionally flour) and shallow- fried in oil, one at a time. Some people prefer to use very little oil and then bake them in the oven as a healthier alternative. =Australia= Beef (which may be veal) and chicken schnitzel are both very popular dishes in Australia, particularly in pubs where they are among the most widely available meals. Chicken schnitzel (less so beef) is also sold at many take-away establishments. Schnitzel in Australia is often served in the form of parmigiana, which is a schnitzel topped with Italian tomato sauce, cheese, and occasionally ham. At pubs, schnitzel is typically accompanied by chips (French fries), salad, and sometimes bacon. Plain and parmigiana schnitzels are sometimes respectively known by colloquial names \\"Schnitty\\", \\"Schnitter\\", \\"Parma\\", or \\"Parmi\\". =Austria= Wiener Schnitzel, a very thin, breaded and pan fried cutlet made from veal, is one of the best known specialities of Viennese cuisine, and is one of the national dishes of Austria.

It is usually served with French fries, potato mash, or wedge potatoes. A slice of lemon, a slice of anchovy, and a few capers are placed on top of the cutlet. Usually, the dish includes a small amount of salad made from fresh vegetables. The dish was popular between the end of the Second World War and the 1990s, when it could be found in most low-end restaurants in Finland. In past decades, its popularity has been dimmed by the rise of fast food. Wieninleike and its variations remain a staple of menus in many non-ethnic or fine dining restaurant in Finland. Lunch restaurants, highway rest stops and restaurants attached to gas stations are most prominently associated with this type of menu in Finland. *Wieninleike served typically with slice of lemon, anchovy, and caper *Floridanleike served with fried peach and served with B√©arnaise sauce *Havaijinleike served with fried pineapple *Holsteininleike served with egg, anchovy, and caper *Mets√§st√§j√§nleike served with mushroom sauce *Oskarinleike served with choron-sauce, shrimps or lobster, and asparagus *Oopperaleike served with fried egg *Sveitsinleike is filled with smoked ham and Emmentaler cheese Typically the dishes above are prepared from pork. =France= Pariser schnitzel is similar to Wiener Schnitzel but is floured and fried in an egg batter instead of using breadcrumbs. =Germany= In Germany, the term Schnitzel means cutlets in general, not just breaded, fried ones. J√§gerschnitzel as served at a German restaurant *J√§gerschnitzel (hunter's schnitzel) is a schnitzel with mushroom sauce. Depending on the region of Germany and personal taste, it may or may not be breaded.

Much like the English term \\"Gypsy\\", the term Zigeuner is viewed as offensive by some Romani people. =Hungary= Hungarian schnitzel with nokedli Due to the strong Austrian influence of the Austro-Hungarian era, Wiener schnitzel is popular in Hungary, known as b√©csi szeletJune Meyers Authentic Hungarian Heirloom Recipes Cookbook (Viennese slice), borj√∫ b√©csi (Viennese veal) or r√°ntott h√∫s (breaded meat). It is served in restaurants, and is a common meal in Hungarian homes, often prepared on Sundays or for festivities with sp√§tzle, French fries, mashed potatoes, or rice.

Some restaurants offer the cordon bleu variant, a slice of schnitzel rolled and filled with cheese and ham. =Iran= Schnitzel as served at an Iranian restaurant Schnitzel is popular in Iran, where it is known as shenitsel (). Thought to have been introduced in Persia during the World Wars, shenitsel is usually thicker, bigger, spicier, and fried with a more crispy breading than the standard schnitzel. It is customarily served with lemon, French fries, and a variety of boiled vegetables. Another Iranian dish, kotlet (), should not be confused with shenitsel. They are small, oval-shaped patties made by deep-frying a mix of ground meat, onion, potato, and herbs. =Israel= Israeli schnitzel In Israel the dish is called Schnitzel (, shnitsel). It is a popular food in Israeli cuisine. The meat is typically chicken or turkey breast, in conformance with dietary kashrut laws, which prohibit pork. Additionally, clarified butter, the preferred cooking fat for Austrian Wiener Schnitzel, is impermissible for kosher use, as it is a dairy product forbidden for use with meat. Hence vegetable oils are used. Before frying, the schnitzel is coated with a mixture of beaten eggs and bread crumbs, sometimes spiced with paprika or sesame seeds. The Israeli schnitzel is usually served with mashed potatoes, French fries, rice, or pasta, accompanied by ketchup, hummus, or vegetable salad. The schnitzel tradition was brought from Europe to Israel by Ashkenazi Jews. During the early years of the state of Israel, veal was not obtainable,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IDYzdKihUQ and chicken or turkey proved to be inexpensive and tasty substitutes. Packaged schnitzels are widely available from the frozen food section in most supermarkets. Some frozen schnitzels are breaded patties made from processed chicken or turkey meat, not whole poultry breasts. Schnitzel is also sold in a pita, alongside hummus, French fries and vegetable salad, in a similar way to falafel. Many falafel stands also offer a schnitzel in a pita. =Japan= Tonkatsu Japanese consists of a flattened pork loin, lightly seasoned, coated in flour, dipped in beaten egg, coated with panko crumbs and deep fried. Tonkatsu is often served as an accompaniment to ramen or udon or featured with curry and rice. Pork tonkatsu was invented in Japan in 1899 at the Rengatei restaurant in Tokyo.

It is also popular as a sandwich, served in a bun with lettuce (sandes de panado). =Romania= Romanian »ôni»õel () is very common in restaurants, fast-food places, and homes across the country. Normally served simple and unadorned, the fast food version is differentiated by being served sandwich/burger style. Cordon bleu »ôni»õel (made from pork loin stuffed with cheese and ham) is also very popular.

It broadcast to Tendring and Essex from studios in Colchester and Ipswich, airing the same music programming as sister station Town 102. The station was folded into Greatest Hits Radio, as part of its East region, on 1 September 2020. History The station was founded as medium wave outlet Mellow 1557 on 1557 kHz in 1990. The station launched on 7 October 1990 as an easy listening station for Tendring. By 1992 Southern Radio PLC had acquired Mellow, making it part of the same group which owned Ocean FM, Southern FM, South Coast Radio. In 1996 Southern Radio sold Mellow on to Radio First before purchasing Invicta FM and Invicta SuperGold. Radio First sold Mellow to Tindle Radio Ltd on 1 September 1998; on 19 November, it became an FM station and adopted its present name. Former pirate radio DJ Bill Rollins had been at the Tendring station through its various evolutions, from day 1 in 1990. In 2006, Town 102 was started up as a sister to Dream 100 from Ipswich, focused on south Suffolk. Programmes between 0600 and 1900 Monday to Friday and between 0800 and 1200 on Saturday and Sunday were then produced in the Town 102 studios near Ipswich for broadcast on Dream 100.

Programming originated from studios at the Old Pump House in Knebworth Park. Launched as HertBeat in 2001, it was subsumed into Heart Hertfordshire on 31 May 2019 shortly after acquisition by media group Communicorp.  History  = Early Years: Radio Hertford and HertBeat = In October 1998, following seven years of lobbying of the Radio Authority Radio Hertford was granted a Restricted Service Licence to broadcast for a two-week period to Hertford and surrounding areas. The Radio Authority then invited applications to apply for a long-term Hertford licence. The Radio Hertford consortium submitted a bid to broadcast as Hertbeat FM competing with a rival entrant, Stag FM, backed by The Daily Mail Radio Group. Citing Radio Hertford's lobbying of the Radio Authority, trial broadcast and emphasis on local content, the HertBeat FM bid was awarded licence in February 2000. The station proposed \\"an imaginative, music-led service, targeted at discerning 25 to 54-year olds, with intelligent speech that emphasises local news and information.\\" Logo of Hertbeat FM before its Jack FM incarnation The Old Pump House at Knebworth Park was converted into a radio studio. Broadcasting commenced on 3 March 2001 with the inaugural show presented by Robbie Owen, a director of the company. Amongst the original team was Steve Folland, who continued presenting at the station until November 2013. July 2005 saw HertBeat FM owner Radio Hertford (Commercial) acquired by Shadow Radio Holdings, led by Brett Harley, resulting in a change of directors. The station continued offering locally oriented content, music and request shows using a roster of presenters through the day and night. = Jack FM = On 10 May 2010 HertBeat abruptly rebranded as Jack FM - at that time the third Jack FM licensee operating in the UK. Amongst the reasons for terminating HertBeat was confusion with encroaching rival network Heart. The Jack format was mostly automated, initially only \\"Jack's Breakfast\\" with Steve Folland surviving as a presenter-led show but later complemented with a Saturday \\"Interactive Brunch\\" topical news show presented by newsreader Chris Hubbard and a Sunday \\"All Eighties\\" music show with Brett Harley. The rest of the schedule included music, snippets from \\"Jack's Breakfast\\", news and other local content. In common with the other UK Jack stations many links between segments were provided by the acerbic Voice of Jack, Paul Darrow, recorded at Jack FM Oxfordshire, often tailored for the local audience. Unlike HertBeat, Jack FM rejected listener's requests, a stance reinforced by the brand slogan, \\"Playing what we want\\". In November 2013, as the Jack FM period drew to a close Steve Folland departed the station, replaced by industry veteran Graham Mack. = BOB fm = The station's preparations to broadcast using DAB in addition to FM, triggered another rebranding due to lack of exclusivity of the Jack FM moniker on the DAB multiplex and potential clashes with the growing number of stations then operating as Jack FM franchises. From January to March 2014 listeners were encouraged to suggest new names for the station. Unlike the sudden transformation to Jack FM, the plan to rename the station was trailed extensively. The rebranding was announced on 10 March 2014. The final song played by the station as Jack FM Hertfordshire was \\"Things Can Only Get Better\\" by D:Ream, airing shortly before 0800. At 0808 the station was transformed into BOB fm. The inaugural song was \\"Hit the Road Jack\\" by Ray Charles. The station emulated Jack FM's automated format, with links and catchphrase \\"Turn your knob to BOB\\", provided by Voice of BOB, Jim McCabe. There was no connection to other broadcasters operating as Bob FM outside the United Kingdom. BOB fm's DAB service ceased in August 2018.https://twitter.com/WohnortDAB/status/1032792958662320129 = Incorporation into Heart Hertfordshire = In April 2019 Shadow Radio Holdings was purchased by Communicorp. Earlier in the year Communicorp had acquired Watford-based Heart Hertfordshire, which broadcasts in south Hertfordshire, from Adventure Radio. The takeover of BOB fm allowed Heart Hertfordshire to extend its reach throughout the county. A transition began in May with Heart- style jingles, slogans and music interspersed amongst its output. Frequent trailers proclaimed \\"Heart is coming.\\" On 31 May 2019 the final live presented show, \\"BOB's Breakfast\\" with Brett Harley and Chris Hubbard ended with \\"Are You with Me\\" by Lost Frequencies. BOB fm ceased broadcasting at 4pm, handing over to Heart Hertfordshire for the station's drivetime show from Watford. The closure of BOB fm coincided with programming changes across the wider Heart radio network. The station still retains local news, traffic updates and advertising - with Chris Hubbard continuing to head up the station's Breakfast News.  Ofcom complaints  * In 2006 Hertbeat ran advertisements for Stevenage Borough Council during an election period that media regulator Ofcom determined breached rules regarding political content. * During the 2014 Scottish independence referendum a publicity stunt, involving an on-air rant against Scots and a ban on Scottish music by presenter Graham Mack prompted almost 50 complaints to Ofcom. Ofcom determined the complaints did not warrant investigation. * A lively conversation in May 2018 between a caller and Graham Mack regarding a local speed camera patrol was reported to Ofcom. The investigation deemed the broadcast to be in breach of rules regarding potential to cause offence. Graham Mack departed the station during July 2018 shortly before the Ofcom adjudication in August to become Programme Director at London-based Fix Radio. Brett Harley replaced Graham Mack as host of BOB's Breakfast.  Awards  Graham Mack won \\"Best Radio Personality\\" Finalist at the New York Festivals International Radio Awards in 2017. BOB fm developed a reputation for the quality of its local news. Chris Hubbard won \\"Newsreader of the Year\\" at the Independent Radio News (IRN) Awards, having previously been twice shortlisted. The IRN also awarded the accolade of \\"News Team of the Year\\" to the station in 2013 and 2016. Its journalists and reports have also been shortlisted for or won several honours.

It is located beside the Kennicott Glacier, northeast of Valdez, inside Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve. The camp and mines are now a National Historic Landmark District administered by the National Park Service. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1986. and  History  In the summer of 1900, two prospectors, \\"Tarantula\\" Jack Smith and Clarence L. Warner, a group of prospectors associated with the McClellan party, spotted \\"a green patch far above them in an improbable location for a grass-green meadow.\\" The green turned out to be malachite, located with chalcocite (aka \\"copper glance\\"), and the location of the Bonanza claim. A few days later, Arthur Coe Spencer, U.S. Geological Survey geologist independently found chalcocite at the same location. Stephen Birch, a mining engineer just out of school, was in Alaska looking for investment opportunities in minerals. He had the financial backing of the Havemeyer Family, and another investor named James Ralph, from his days in New York. Birch spent the winter of 1901-1902 acquiring the \\"McClellan group's interests\\" for the Alaska Copper Company of Birch, Havemeyer, Ralph and Schultz, later to become the Alaska Copper and Coal Company. In the summer of 1901, he visited the property and \\"spent months mapping and sampling.\\" He confirmed the Bonanza was, at the time, the richest known concentration of copper in the world. By 1905, Birch had successfully defended the legal challenges to his property and he began the search for capital to develop the area. On 28 June 1906, he entered into \\"an amalgamation\\" with the Daniel Guggenheim and J.P. Morgan & Co., known as the Alaska Syndicate, eventually securing over $30 million. The capital was to be used for constructing a railway, a steamship line, and development of the mines. In Nov. 1906, the Alaska Syndicate bought a 40 percent interest in the Bonanza Mine from the Alaska Copper and Coal Company and a 46.2 percent interest in the railroad plans of John Rosene's Northwestern Commercial Company. Political battles over the mining and subsequent railroad were fought in the office of U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt between conservationists and those having a financial interest in the copper. The Alaska Syndicate's traded its Wrangell Mountains Mines assets for shares in the Kennecott Copper Corporation, a \\"new public company\\" formed on 29 April 1915. A similar transaction followed with the CR&NW; railway and the Alaska Steamship Company. Birch was the managing partner for the Alaska operation. Kennecott Mines was named after the Kennicott Glacier in the valley below. The geologist Oscar Rohn named the glacier after Robert Kennicott during the 1899 US Army Abercrombie Survey. A \\"clerical error\\" resulted in the substitution of an \\"e\\" for the \\"i\\", supposedly by Stephen Birch himself. Kennecott had five mines: Bonanza, Jumbo, Mother Lode, Erie and Glacier. Glacier, which is really an ore extension of the Bonanza, was an open-pit mine and was only mined during the summer. Bonanza and Jumbo were on Bonanza Ridge about from Kennecott. The Mother Lode mine was located on the east side of the ridge from Kennecott. The Bonanza, Jumbo, Mother Lode and Erie mines were connected by tunnels. The Erie mine was perched on the northwest end of Bonanza Ridge overlooking Root Glacier about up a glacial trail from Kennecott. Ore was hoisted to Kennecott via the trams which head-ended at Bonanza and Jumbo. From Kennecott the ore was hauled mostly in 140-pound sacks on steel flat cars to Cordova, 196 rail miles away on the Copper River and Northwestern Railway (CRNW). In 1911 the first shipment of ore by train transpired. Before completion, the steamship Chittyna carried ore to the Abercrombie landing by Miles Glacier. Initial ore shipments contained \\"72 percent copper and 18 oz. of silver per ton.\\" In 1916, the peak year for production, the mines produced copper ore valued at $32.4 million. The Kennecott hospital (left) stood out as the town's only white-washed building. The vast majority of other town structures, including workers' bunkhouses (right), were painted red, the least expensive color at the time. The Kennecott hospital was also the site of the first X-ray machine in Alaska. In 1925 a Kennecott geologist predicted that the end of the high-grade ore bodies was in sight. The highest grades of ore were largely depleted by the early 1930s. The Glacier Mine closed in 1929. The Mother Lode was next, closing at the end of July 1938. The final three, Erie, Jumbo and Bonanza, closed that September. The last train left Kennecott on November 10, 1938, leaving it a ghost town. From 1909 until 1938, except when it closed temporarily in 1932, Kennecott mines \\"produced over 4.6 million tons of ore that contained 1.183 billion pounds of copper mainly from three ore bodies: Bonanza, Jumbo and Mother Lode.\\" The Kennecott operations reported gross revenues above $200 million and a net profit greater than $100 million. In 1938, Ernest Gruening proposed Kennecott be preserved as a National Park. A recommendation to President Franklin D. Roosevelt on 18 Jan. 1940 for the establishment of the Kennecott National Monument went nowhere. However, 2 Dec. 1980 saw the establishment of the Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve. From 1939 until the mid-1950s, Kennecott was deserted except for a family of three who served as the watchmen until about 1952. In the late 1960s, an attempt was made to reprocess the tailings and to transport the ore in aircraft. The cost of doing so made the idea unprofitable. Around the same time, the company with land rights ordered the destruction of the town to rid them of liability for potential accidents. A few structures were destroyed, but the job was never finished and most of the town was left standing. Visitors and nearby residents have stripped many of the small items and artifacts. Some have since been returned and are held in various archives. KCC sent a field party under the geologist Les Moon in 1955. They agreed with the 1938 conclusion, \\"no copper resource of a size and grade sufficient to interest KCC remained.\\" The mill remains however. Demographics Kennecott first reported on the 1920 U.S. Census as an unincorporated village. It appeared again in 1930 and 1940, and after its abandonment, it has not reported separately since. It is now within the McCarthy CDP. Geology Copper ore was discovered in a lode on Chief Nikolai's house at the mouth of Dan Creek in July 1899. The geological formations in the area were described and identified by a USGS geologist by the name of Oscar Rohn in 1899. This original copper find became the basis of the Nikolai Mine in 1900. Simultaneously, placer gold was discovered on the Dan and Young Creeks. The Bonanza ore body was discovered in Aug. 1900 by Warner and Smith. Almost simultaneously, another USGS geologist named Arthur Spencer, came across the ore when mapping the area with Frank Schrader. In 1901, the Dan Creek was staked by C.L. Warner and \\"Dan\\" L. Kain. Gold was found on Chititu Creek in April 1902 by Frank Kernan and Charles Koppus. Besides placer deposits, copper is found as polymetallic replacement deposits in the fault planes, fractures and joints of the Triassic Nikolai greenstone, which consists of basaltic lava flows, and in the base of the Upper Triassic Chitistone limestone. Minerals include chalcocite, bornite and chalcopyrite, with associated malachite, azurite and cuprite. Native copper can also be found in the greenstone.

Note the aerial tramways and haulage tunnels. Concentration Mill Copper extraction was a many step process in an attempt to be as efficient as possible. Chalcocite and covellite were sent directly to the smelting plant in Tacoma. Malachite, azurite, and other forms of copper within the limestone needed separation in the 14-story mill building before shipment. The mill was mainly built between 1909 and 1923. Ore arrived at the mill via aerial tramways, where the high-grade portion (60-60% copper) was crushed and placed in a chute to carry it directly to the bottom to be placed in burlap sacks. Lower-grade ore was further crushed, sized and sorted. The denser ore was separated from the less dense waste via Hancock jigs and shaker tables. The tailings left over after gravity separation were further treated via ammonia leaching, for the coarse material, or via froth flotation for the fine material. The ammonia leaching plant was built in 1915, where ammonia liquefied the copper but kept the limestone in solid form. The ammonia-copper solution was heated to drive off the ammonia, which left behind a copper oxide containing 75% copper. This was then sacked for shipment. The flotation plant was built in 1923 to process the \\"fines\\", which were less than 0.3 cm in size. These fines were mixed with water, oil, and buffering chemicals, before air was bubbled through the solution. Copper ore attached to the air bubbles, and floated to the top, where it was skimmed off, dried and sacked.

However, the town of Kennecott was never repopulated. Residents involved in the tourism industry often lived in nearby McCarthy or on private land in the surrounding area. The area was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1986 and the National Park Service acquired much of the land within the Kennecott Mill Town in 1998. Popular tourist activities while visiting Kennecott include glacier hiking, ice climbing, and touring the abandoned mill. Visitors may also hike to the abandoned Bonanza, Jumbo and Erie mines, all of which are strenuous full-day hikes, with Erie Mine being a somewhat terrifying scramble along cliffs overlooking the Stairway Icefall. Local guide services offer all of these hikes if one would like some route- finding assistance.  Accessibility  Kennecott is now accessible by air (McCarthy has a meter gravel runway) or by driving on the Edgerton Highway to the McCarthy Road, an unimproved gravel road. The McCarthy Road ends at the Kennicott River and a footbridge is available for pedestrian traffic to McCarthy. From McCarthy, it is to Kennecott, and shuttles are available.

Since March 2, 2006, the intellectual property rights of the game have been owned by Rebellion Developments. The game is inspired by the spy thriller genre (notably the James Bond film series), and is set in an alternative 1960s‚Äì70s era. Most closely resembling Dungeon Keeper, the gameplay puts players in charge of a villainous force attempting to achieve global domination whilst fending off the forces of justice; to this end the gameplay is split between management of a base and the completion of \\"acts of infamy\\" in the rest of the world. The game has stylish, cartoon-like visuals and contains a great deal of tongue-in-cheek humour, particularly playing to clich√©s of the spy genre. Gameplay Evil Genius contains a mixture of real- time strategy and simulation elements, and is described by Rebellion Developments as a \\"real-time mad scientist lair management strategic simulation\\". Gameplay is split between managing a lair, together with the \\"minions\\" that populate it, and the \\"World Domination screen\\". The game is set in a non-specific time period, with the use of historic regions (the Eastern Bloc) and events (the Cuban Missile Crisis) suggestive of the 1960s and 70s, albeit in an alternate timeline; furthermore, the styling of the game is reminiscent of the 1960s Atomic Age designs. Evil Genius consists of a single game mode wherein the ultimate goal is to build a doomsday device and force the capitulation of the world to the player's \\"Evil Genius\\". This figure is selected at the beginning of the game from one of three choices‚ÄîMaximilian, Alexis or Shen Yu‚Äîand acts as the player's avatar; if killed, the game ends. A player-made lair containing several rooms and objects being used by minions The first lair is constructed within the base of a mountain on a desert island. During the course of the game the player relocates to a larger, tropical island, the extinct volcano at the centre of which is used as the foundation for a rocket silo. The lair comprises various rooms, each of which contains objects for use by minions, either for the replenishment of certain \\"stats\\" (e.g. objects in the Mess Hall restore endurance) or to provide a function (e.g. the Power Plant room contains objects that generate power and allow the lair to function). Corridors connect the rooms within the lair and can also contain traps, which serve as one of several ways to deter agents of justice and their attempts to enter the base and gather evidence, steal money, or sabotage equipment. Trap results vary from simple confusion and movement impairment to stat reduction and death, and catching agents within a combination of traps will reward the player with money. New objects can eventually be unlocked through the Laboratory via combining already-existing items with pieces of equipment. Players have no direct control over the minions they employ, but can interact with them using \\"Henchmen\\" and the Evil Genius. Construction workers are the basic minion type and can be trained to specialize in one of three fields: military, scientific, or social. Each field has three successive minion levels, with the third level having two specialized branches. Initially these higher branches are unlocked by acquiring and interrogating civilian hostages, after which their skills can be passed on to other minions via training equipment. Like the Evil Genius, the player has direct control over \\"Henchmen\\". Henchmen are stronger than conventional minions, obtainable only at certain stages throughout the game, and can be upgraded with two special moves after gaining experience. The \\"World Domination screen\\". White dots highlight \\"Acts of Infamy\\" yet to be completed and the minions available are displayed at the bottom. The \\"World Domination screen\\" comprises an interactive map of the world divided into regions to which the player is able to send minions from their lair to steal money or to commit \\"Acts of Infamy\\". These Acts can be used to obtain loot to adorn the lair (increasing minion statuses), capture civilian hostages (to interrogate them), and to garner \\"Notoriety\\". Many Acts advance the ultimate goal of constructing the doomsday device. Acts require variable amounts and types of minions, and each carries a degree of risk. Although, the player has no direct control over a mission, they can increase the chance of success by mixing minion classes and allocating greater numbers; the danger of committing Acts is compounded by the occasional appearance of Agents in certain regions, which the player can choose to hide their minions from. Some Acts of Infamy are references to historical events, such as the Cuban Missile Crisis, while others are comical, such as a \\"humanitarian mission\\" to destroy Nashville, Tennessee and rid the world of country music. The lair must be defended from the \\"forces of justice\\": five government counter-terrorist agencies under whose control the world is split. S.A.B.R.E controls Western Europe, Australasia, the Indian Subcontinent and Southern Africa. P.A.T.R.I.O.T controls North America and the \\"Pacific Allies\\" (Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan). H.A.M.M.E.R controls the Soviet Union, the Eastern Bloc, and Cuba. A.N.V.I.L controls China and Southeast Asia. S.M.A.S.H controls the remainder of the world with the Middle East, Northern and Central Africa, South America, and Antarctica. Any Act of Infamy carried out within a region, and even the mere presence of minions (but especially if they are siphoning money back to the lair) will increase the level of notice, or \\"Heat\\", of the alliance that controls it, triggering a proportionate response: those alliances with the highest levels of heat will send their most skilled forces. Agents, appearing singularly or in groups, are divided according to their roles: Investigators, who will try to uncover evidence of illegal operations, thus increasing \\"Heat\\"; Saboteurs, whose goal is to destroy parts of the base; Thieves, who will attempt to steal back stolen items and cash; and Soldiers, who will assault minions, Henchmen and the Evil Genius him/herself. As the player acquires \\"Notoriety\\", they will attract the attention of \\"Super Agents\\", one from each of the five alliances; these agents combine two of the aforementioned roles, require special objectives to be met to permanently defeat, and are able to kill Henchmen over time by depleting their pool of lives. Reception Evil Genius has an average review score of 78% and 75 out of a possible 100, according to the review aggregators GameRankings and Metacritic respectively, which indicates \\"generally favourable reviews.\\" Most critics praised the game for its humour and unique take on the god-game genre, but also criticised it for its frustrating micromanagement and annoying bugs. GameSpot gave the game a 7.3 out of 10, stating that \\"while Evil Genius' dry, campy humor is often amusing from the start, it takes quite a bit of time and effort to pull off acts of infamy and establish your notoriety among global powers\\" and states \\"Evil Genius is hampered by some frustratingly haphazard pacing as well as issues with the artificial intelligence of your minions.\\" IGN gave Evil Genius a 7.8 out of 10, the reviewer stating that \\"Evil Genius hearkens back to the glorious Bullfrog creation Dungeon Keeper. Not only did it have us building a base underground (far, far underground), but also put us in the shoes of a sadistic dungeon master with imps, demons, and horned reapers to \\"control.\\" There are quite a few differences in the two titles, but the influence is certainly there\\" but went on to say that \\"Had there been more interactivity with during acts of infamy on the World Domination Map, less micromanagement for taking care of enemies, more information passing between the map and the base screens, and more useful information about why things happened the way they did, Evil Genius really could have been genius... but in a good way.\\" Eurogamer gave Evil Genius a 7 out of 10, commenting that \\"even as we sit here picking over the carcass, we're not actually all that angry about the things that are wrong with the game. They're bad on paper, but they didn't interfere hugely with our having fun - a sure sign that that Evil Genius overcomes its flaws and ultimately satisfies.\\" Evil Genius music score, composed by James Hannigan, received a BAFTA nomination for Best Original Music in 2004. Hannigan has spoken of how the work he did for the game stands out amongst his oeuvre, on account of its \\"uniqueness\\". Sequel Financial reports at the end of 2004 revealed Elixir Studios had begun work on a sequel to Evil Genius. However, the studio's closure in 2005 led to the project's cancellation. While Rebellion purchased the intellectual property rights to Elixir's titles, the franchise remained dormant for several years aside from being re-released on digital platforms before the sudden 2010 release of the Facebook app Evil Genius: WMD, which took the IP and applied it to the FarmVille style of apps popular at the time. This app was later shut down in favor of Evil Genius Online, another Facebook app, due to the intensely negative reception of WMD.http://www.rebellion.co.uk/games/evil-genius-online Announced and entering open beta in 2013, Evil Genius Online was released as a Facebook application and later released on iOS and Android. The full version launched in early 2015. Similar to the original, Evil Genius Online maintained the idea of attaining power and building elaborate lairs and hiring minions, progressing using timed missions that could be sped up or bypassed with virtual currency.Evil Genius Online, \\"Evil Genius Online\\", Evil Genius Online, 2015 Evil Genius Online shut down on February 6, 2017. In a blog post on their website, Rebellion Developments addressed rumours about a 'sequel' that had been circulating via Twitter. Specifically, the post said that this was not in reference to Evil Genius Online, but instead concerned a fully featured PC follow-up: In July 2017, Rebellion announced that it had been developing Evil Genius 2 since Q2 2017. At E3 2019 Rebellion premiered the first trailer for the sequel, titled Evil Genius 2: World Domination, and stated that the game would be released on Steam sometime in 2020. In June 2020, It was announced that James Hannigan, the main composer of Evil Genius, would be returning to score Evil Genius 2: World Domination. In August 2020, It was announced that Evil Genius 2: World Domination would be delayed until \\"The first half of 2021\\".

Hoses are also sometimes called pipes (the word pipe usually refers to a rigid tube, whereas a hose is usually a flexible one), or more generally tubing. The shape of a hose is usually cylindrical (having a circular cross section). Hose design is based on a combination of application and performance. Common factors are size, pressure rating, weight, length, straight hose or coilhose, and chemical compatibility. Applications mostly use nylon, polyurethane, polyethylene, PVC, or synthetic or natural rubbers, based on the environment and pressure rating needed. In recent years, hoses can also be manufactured from special grades of polyethylene (LDPE and especially LLDPE). Other hose materials include PTFE (Teflon), stainless steel, and other metals. Reinforced rubber hose A reinforced series of tubes, these can withstand up to of pressure To achieve a better pressure resistance, hoses can be reinforced with fibers or a steel cord. Commonly used reinforcement methods are braiding, spiraling, knitting and wrapping of fabric plies. The reinforcement increases the pressure resistance but also the stiffness. To obtain flexibility, corrugations or bellows are used. Usually, circumferential or helical reinforcement rings are applied to maintain these corrugated or bellowed structures under internal pressure. Applications Hoses can be used in water or other liquid environments, or to convey air or other gases. Hoses are used to carry fluids through air or fluid environments, and they are typically used with clamps, spigots, flanges, and nozzles to control fluid flow. Specific applications include the following: * A garden hose is used to water plants in a garden or lawn, or to convey water to a sprinkler for the same purpose. * A tough hose is used to water crops in agriculture for drip irrigation. * A fire hose is used by firefighters to convey water to the site of a fire. * Air hoses are used in underwater diving to carry air from a surface compressor or from air tanks. (See also snorkeling.) Industrial uses for operating flexible machinery and worktable tooling such as pneumatic screw drivers, grinders, staplers, etc. * Hoses have been used in air brake systems ever since the technology was invented by George Westinghouse in 1868. This includes: **Railway air brake hoses used between locomotives and railroad cars **Truck air brake hoses used between tractors and semi-trailers * Vacuum hoses ** Vacuum brake hoses have been used in Vacuum brake systems ever since the technology was invented in the mid-1860s. ** Vacuum cleaners often have corrugated flexible vacuum hoses to connect the cleaning head to the motor. * In building services, metal or plastic hoses are used to move water around a building; whilst air ducts are used to move air around (see air conditioning). They can also be used to take out vibration, and thermal or settlement movement. * Automotive hoses are used in automobiles to move fluids around for use in cooling, lubrication, and/or hydraulics. Hoses are also used to convey pressure or vacuum signals to control circuits or gauges, as well as conveying vacuum to heating, cooling, brake, and/or locking systems. * In chemistry and medicine, hoses (usually called tubes) are used to move liquid chemicals or gases around. * A fuel hose carries fuel. * In the oil industry high pressure hoses are used to move liquids under high pressures. Typical uses are for kill and choke lines, cement lines and Kelly hose. These are often connected to either the choke manifold, cement manifold or standpipe manifold. In some cases, a rubber hose has been used as a weapon with which to beat somebody. This is the origin of the term rubber-hose cryptanalysis.

It keeps a separate, homogeneous data array for each field of the record, each having the same number of elements. Then, objects located at the same index in each array are implicitly the fields of a single record. Pointers from one object to another are replaced by array indices. This contrasts with the normal approach of storing all fields of each record together in memory (also known as array of structures or AoS). For example, one might declare an array of 100 names, each a string, and 100 ages, each an integer, associating each name with the age that has the same index.  Examples  An example in C using parallel arrays: int ages[] = {0, 17, 2, 52, 25}; char *names[] = {\\"None\\", \\"Mike\\", \\"Billy\\", \\"Tom\\", \\"Stan\\"}; int parent[] = {0 /*None*/, 3 /*Tom*/, 1 /*Mike*/, 0 /*None*/, 3 /*Tom*/}; for (i = 1; i <= 4; i++) { printf(\\"Name: %s, Age: %d, Parent: %s \\", names[i], ages[i], names[parent[i ); } in Perl (using a hash of arrays to hold references to each array): my %data = ( first_name => ['Joe', 'Bob', 'Frank', 'Hans' ], last_name => ['Smith','Seger','Sinatra','Schultze'], height_in_cm => [169, 158, 201, 199 ]); for $i (0..$#{$data{first_name}}) { printf \\"Name: %s %s \\", $data{first_name}[$i], $data{last_name}[$i]; printf \\"Height in CM: %i \\", $data{height_in_cm}[$i]; } Or, in Python: first_names = ['Joe', 'Bob', 'Frank', 'Hans' ] last_names = ['Smith','Seger','Sinatra','Schultze'] heights_in_cm = [169, 158, 201, 199 ] for i in range(len(first_names)): print(\\"Name: %s %s\\" % (first_names[i], last_names[i])) print(\\"Height in CM: %s\\" % heights_in_cm[i]) # Using zip: for first_name, last_name, height_in_cm in zip(first_names, last_names, heights_in_cm): print(f\\"Name: {first_name} {last_name}\\") print(f\\"Height in CM: {height_in_cm}\\") Pros and cons Parallel arrays have a number of practical advantages over the normal approach: * They can be used in languages which support only arrays of primitive types and not of records (or perhaps don't support records at all). * Parallel arrays are simple to understand, particularly for beginners who may not fully understand records. * They can save a substantial amount of space in some cases by avoiding alignment issues. For example, some architectures work best if 4-byte integers are always stored beginning at memory locations that are multiple of 4. If the previous field was a single byte, 3 bytes might be wasted. Many modern compilers can automatically avoid such problems, though in the past some programmers would explictly declare fields in order of decreasing alignment restrictions. * If the number of items is small, array indices can occupy significantly less space than full pointers, particularly on some architectures. * Sequentially examining a single field of each record in the array is very fast on modern machines, since this amounts to a linear traversal of a single array, exhibiting ideal locality of reference and cache behaviour. * They may allow efficient processing with SIMD instructions in certain instruction set architectures Several of these advantage depend strongly on the particular programming language and implementation in use. However, parallel arrays also have several strong disadvantages, which serves to explain why they are not generally preferred: * They have significantly worse locality of reference when visiting the records non-sequentially and examining multiple fields of each record, because the various arrays may be stored arbitrarily far apart. * They obscure the relationship between fields of a single record (e.g. no type information relates the index between them, an index may be used erroneously). * They have little direct language support (the language and its syntax typically express no relationship between the arrays in the parallel array, and cannot catch errors). * Since the bundle of fields is not a \\"thing\\", passing it around it tedious and error-prone. For example, rather than calling a function to do something to one record (or structure or object), the function must take the fields as separate arguments. When a new field is added or changed, many parameter lists must change, where passing objects as whole would avoid such changes entirely. * They are expensive to grow or shrink, since each of several arrays must be reallocated. Multi-level arrays can ameliorate this problem, but impacts performance due to the additional indirection needed to find the desired elements. * Perhaps worst of all, they greatly raise the possibility of errors. Any insertion, deletion, or move must always be applied consistently to all of the arrays, or the arrays will no longer be synchronized with each other, leading to bizarre outcomes. The bad locality of reference can be alleviated in some cases: if a structure can be divided into groups of fields that are generally accessed together, an array can be constructed for each group, and its elements are records containing only these subsets of the larger structure's fields. (see data oriented design). This is a valuable way of speeding up access to very large structures with many members, while keeping the portions of the structure tied together. An alternative to tying them together using array indexes is to use references to tie the portions together, but this can be less efficient in time and space. Another alternative is to use a single array, where each entry is a record structure. Many language provide a way to declare actual records, and arrays of them. In other languages it may be feasible to simulate this by declaring an array of n*m size, where m is the size of all the fields together, packing the fields into what is effectively a record, even though the particular language lacks direct support for records. Some compiler optimizations, particularly for vector processors, are able to perform this transformation automatically when arrays of structures are created in the program.

Alphonse-Marie-Adolphe de Neuville (31 May 183518 May 1885) was a French academic painter who studied under Eug√®ne Delacroix. His dramatic and intensely patriotic subjects illustrated episodes from the Franco-Prussian War, the Crimean War, the Zulu War and portraits of soldiers. Some of his works have been collected by the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg and by the Metropolitan Museum in New York. Early life National Guard uniform in 1870‚Äì1871. Born Alphonse-Marie-Adolphe Deneuville to wealthy parents at Saint-Omer, Pas-de-Calais, earned his degree of bachelier √®s-lettres, and in spite of family opposition, he entered (1856) the naval school at Lorient; it was there that his artistic instincts started. He was discouraged by several painters of repute, but he was admitted to work in the studio of Fran√ßois-Edouard Picot; he did not remain there long. He was painting by himself when he produced his first picture, The Fifth Battalion of Chasseurs at the Gervais Battery (Malakoff). In 1860 Neuville painted an Episode of the taking of Naples by Garibaldi for the Artists' Club in the rue de Provence, and sent to the Paris Salon in 1861 The Guard Chasseurs in the Trenches of the Mamelon Vert. This cites Montrosier, Les Peintres militaires (Paris, 1881), \\"De Neuville,\\" in Gazette des beaux arts (Paris, 1885). Illustrator and military artist He participated in illustrating the Pierre-Jules Hetzel's editions of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. He also illustrated Le Tour du monde and Fran√ßois Guizot's History of France. At the same time he painted a number of remarkable pictures: The Attack in the Streets of Magenta by Zouaves and the Light Horse (1864), A Zouave Sentinel (1865), The Battle of San Lorenzo (1867), and Dismounted Cavalry crossing the Tchernaia (1869). In these he showed peculiar insight into military life. His full power was reached after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71\\\\. The long- term French reaction was revanchism: a deep sense of bitterness, hatred, and demand for revenge against Germany, especially because of the loss of Alsace and Lorraine. Paintings that emphasized the humiliation of the defeat were in high demand, such as The Spy by de Neuville.Jay, Robert. \\"Alphonse de Neuville's 'The Spy' and the Legacy of the Franco-Prussian War,\\" Metropolitan Museum Journal (1984) 19: pp. 151-162 in JSTOR He then aimed at depicting in his works the episodes of that war, and began by representing the Bivouac before Le Bourget (1872). His fame spread rapidly and was increased by The Last Cartridges (1873), memorializing an episode involving the Blue Division of the French marines, in which it is easy to discern the vast difference between the conventional treatment of military subjects, as practised by Horace Vernet, and that of a man who had lived the life that he painted. Fight on a Railroad (1874) was equally successful, and was followed by the Attack on a House at Villersexel (1875) and the Railway Bridge at Styring (1877). In 1878, the painter exhibited (not at the Great Exhibition) Le Bourget, the Surprise at Daybreak, The Intercepted Despatch-bearer, and a considerable number of drawings. He also exhibited in London some episodes of the Zulu War. Fifty thousand people paid to see his impression of The Defence of Rorke's Drift (1880), which the infant Art Gallery of New South Wales in Sydney paid a large sum to acquire. In 1881, he was made an officer of the L√©gion d'honneur for The Cemetery of Saint-Privat, The Despatch-bearer, and Huns in the Battle of Chalon. During these years Neuville was at work with √âdouard Detaille on an important although less artistic work, The Panorama of R√©zonville. Neuville died in Paris on May 18, 1885. At the sale of his works the state purchased for the Palais du Luxembourg the paintings Bourget and Attack on a Barricaded House, watercolor The Parley, and the drawing Turco in Fighting Trim.

He is a professed Objectivist, though his position that Objectivism can be revised and influenced by other schools of thought has prompted disagreements with other Objectivists. Kelley is also an author of several books on philosophy and the founder of The Atlas Society, an institution he established in 1990 after permanently dissociating with Leonard Peikoff and the Ayn Rand Institute. Education and career David Kelley was born in Shaker Heights, Ohio. He received his Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts in philosophy from Brown University, where he studied with the American rationalist, Roderick Chisholm. He received his Ph.D. in philosophy from Princeton University in 1975 after completing a doctoral dissertation, titled \\"The evidence of the senses\\", under the supervision of Richard Rorty. He was an assistant professor of philosophy and cognitive science at Vassar College for seven years. He then taught logic for a brief time at Brandeis University, while working as a freelance writer for Barron's and other publications. A member of Ayn Rand's circle, Kelley read her favorite poem, \\"If‚Äî\\", by Rudyard Kipling, at her funeral in 1982. =Objectivism's 'open' faction= Leonard Peikoff's Ayn Rand Institute (ARI) declared Objectivism to be a \\"closed system\\" containing only the philosophic principles advocated by Rand herself. In 1989, Kelley set out in a pamphlet his critique of the ARI Objectivist movement. The pamphlet was titled \\"Truth and Toleration\\", later republished in an expanded edition as the book The Contested Legacy of Ayn Rand. Kelley declared Objectivism to be an \\"open system\\" amenable to revision and addition. This disagreement subsequently split the movement into two factions. In 1990, he founded the Institute for Objectivist Studies (IOS), a non-profit dedicated to cultural advocacy on behalf of \\"reason, individualism, achievement, and capitalism.\\" IOS was established to provide an Objectivist alternative to the Ayn Rand Institute. IOS sponsored scholarly work on Objectivism and conducted summer workshops attended by academics and graduate students. In 1999, IOS was renamed The Objectivist Center (TOC), as the organization took on a more public-outreach and advocacy orientation. In order to pursue his scholarly interests, Kelley stepped down as executive director of TOC in 2004, and the organization ‚Äì now under the leadership of former regulatory policy analyst Edward Hudgins ‚Äì was again renamed as The Atlas Society (TAS). TAS also moved its headquarters from Poughkeepsie, New York, to Washington, D.C. The organization continues to sponsor scholarly work,http://www.atlassociety.org/objectivism_research publishes a websitehttp://www.atlassociety.org and a political-cultural magazine,New Individualist and puts on conferences and seminarshttp://www.atlassociety.org/objectivism_student_resources where scholars and fans of Rand's work meet and mingle. Kelley reassumed the position of executive director for TAS in 2008. =Scholarly work= Kelley's books cover a variety of subjects within philosophy. They includehttp://www.atlassociety.org/objectivism_researchThe Evidence of the Senses, which argues for a unique form of direct realism about perception; Unrugged Individualism, which explores benevolence as a virtue; A Life of One's Own, a moral critique of the welfare state; and The Contested Legacy of Ayn Rand,http://www.atlassociety.org/sites/default/files/The_Contested_Legacy_of_Ayn_Rand.pdf focusing on the schisms within the Objectivist movement. With Roger Donway, he co-authored Laissez Parler: Freedom in the Electronic Media, a critique of government regulation of broadcasting. Kelley has published little scholarly work in philosophy since 1998, but has given public addresses, taught courses, and has written articles on politics and current events. An ongoing research and writing project over the past decade has been his magnum opus, The Logical Structure of Objectivism, which he is co-authoring with economist William Thomas. His most recent scholarly article is \\"Rand Versus Hayek on Abstraction,\\" in the Fall 2011 issue of Reason Papers‚Äîa \\"descriptive and explanatory\\" account of the similarities and differences between Rand's and Friedrich Hayek's views on cognition and mind.

The only prior codes and cypher organizations maintained by the US government had been some intermittent, and always abandoned, attempts by Armed Forces branches prior to World War I.  History  Black Chamber cryptanalytic work sheet for solving Japanese diplomatic cipher, 1919 Headed by Herbert O. Yardley (1889‚Äì1958), the Black Chamber was founded in May 1919 following World War I. Yardley had commanded the Army cryptographic section of Military Intelligence (MI-8) during World War I. MI-8 was disbanded after the war. Jointly funded by the Army and the State Department, the Cipher Bureau was disguised as a New York City commercial code company; it actually produced and sold such codes for business use. Its true mission, however, was to break the communications (chiefly diplomatic) of other nations. Its most notable known success was during the Washington Naval Conference during which it aided American negotiators considerably by providing them with the decrypted traffic of many of the Conference delegations, most notably the Japanese. According to intelligence historian James Bamford, the Black Chamber secured the cooperation of American telegraph companies, such as Western Union, in illegally turning over the cable traffic of foreign embassies and consulates in Washington and New York. Eventually, \\"almost the entire American cable industry\\" was part of this effort. However, these companies eventually withdrew their support‚Äîpossibly spurred by the Radio Act of 1927, which broadened criminal offenses related to breaching the confidentiality of telegraph messages. Kindle location 2712. In 1929, the State Department withdrew its share of the funding, the Army declined to bear the entire load, and the Black Chamber closed down. New Secretary of State Henry L. Stimson made this decision, and years later in his memoirs made the oft-quoted comment: \\"Gentlemen do not read each other's mail.\\" From p. 188: \\"Stimson, as Secretary of State, was dealing as a gentleman with the gentlemen sent as ambassadors and ministers from friendly nations, and as he later said, 'Gentlemen do not read each other's mail.' \\" Stimson's ethical reservations about cryptanalysis focused on the targeting of diplomats from America's close allies, not on spying in general. Once he became Secretary of War during World War II, he and the entire US command structure relied heavily on decrypted enemy communications. In 1931, and in need of money, Yardley wrote a book about the Cipher Bureau, titled The American Black Chamber. The term \\"Black Chamber\\" predates Yardley's use of it in the title of his book. Codes and code breakers have been used throughout history, notably by Sir Francis Walsingham in Elizabethan England. A so-called cabinet noir was established by King Henry IV of France in 1590 as part of the Poste aux Lettres. Its mission was to open, read and reseal letters, and great expertise was developed in the restoration of broken seals. In the knowledge that mail was being opened, correspondents began to develop systems to encrypt and decrypt their letters. The breaking of these codes gave birth to modern systematic scientific code breaking. The Black Chambers survived through to the Twentieth Century in a variety of guises and inspired similar organisations in other countries, such as the \\"Secret Office\\" of the British Post Office and the Admiralty's Room 40 and it is within this historical framework that Yardley uses the term. It was also used at about that time in Poland (see article on Marian Rejewski).

Most of its businesses were small, and the chain stores were all local: Ernst Hardware and Malmo Nursery, Lamonts department store (acquired by Gottschalks in 2000), Pay 'n Save Drugs (sold to PayLess Drug in the early 1990s), and QFC supermarket. There was even a bowling alley, Village Lanes. Many of the businesses began to falter toward the end of the 1980s, however, and in 1993 the owners of the mall decided to sell. For much of this period, University Village was owned by the Tektronix Retirement Investment Fund. =Modern= The chairman of QFC and a partner bought it, and tenants such as those mentioned above began to move out. U-Village no longer has a hardware store, but features upscale national stores such as Restoration Hardware, Pottery Barn, Banana Republic, and Crate & Barrel instead (as well as related local specialty stores). Despite this, 61% of U-Village merchants are still local.

Punishment Murder laws worldwide vary a great deal, but a murder involving torture will generally attract a harsher penalty than a murder alone. Legal mechanisms of penalty enhancement vary between jurisdictions.

Trained at the Arts Educational School and the Royal Ballet School, Bussell started her professional career at Sadlers Wells Royal Ballet, but after only one year she moved to the Royal Ballet, where she became a principal dancer at the age of 20 in 1989. Bussell is widely acclaimed as one of the great British ballerinas. Bussell remained with The Royal Ballet for her whole career, more than two decades, but also performed as a guest artist with many leading companies including NYCB, La Scala Theatre Ballet, the Kirov Ballet, Hamburg Ballet and the Australian Ballet. She retired from ballet in 2007. Bussell is also pursuing parallel careers in television, books and modelling, and supports numerous British and international charities and dance institutions. Early life Darcey Bussell was born in London to Australian businessman John Crittle and his English wife, Andrea Williams. After the couple divorced when Bussell was three, her mother remarried and Bussell was adopted by her mother's new husband, Australian dentist Philip Bussell. The family spent some time in Australia, where Bussell attended school before they returned to London for Bussell to be educated at Fox Primary School in Kensington.

At 16, she progressed to the Royal Ballet Upper School in Baron's Court, before joining the Sadler's Wells Royal Ballet in 1987. While studying at the Royal Ballet School, she appeared in a number of school productions, including performances at the Royal Opera House. While Bussell was still at school, the choreographer Kenneth MacMillan had noticed her exceptional technique, and in 1988 he decided to use her to create the leading role in his ballet The Prince of the Pagodas to Benjamin Britten's music, which led to her moving to the Royal Ballet. A year later, in December 1989 on the opening night of the show, she was promoted to principal dancer at just 20 years old. Bussell performed all the major classical roles numerous times throughout her career, including Masha in Winter Dreams and Princess Rose in The Prince of the Pagodas, both choreographed by MacMillan, as well as Princess Aurora in The Sleeping Beauty, Odette/Odile in Swan Lake, Nikiya and Gamzatti in La Bayad√®re, the Sugar Plum Fairy in The Nutcracker, Manon in L'histoire de Manon, and Giselle in Giselle.

The performance was known as \\"the Spirit of the Flame\\" and preceded the official dousing of the Olympic flame. In 2016 Bussell launched a dance fitness brand called DDMIX (Diverse dance mix). Working with choreographer and dancer, Nathan Clarke, DDMIX is designed to be a new, enjoyable way to exercise and experience different dance styles from around the world without getting too technical on any specific style. It features dance aspects from various styles including: Irish, tango, waltz, jive, Bollywood, disco, flamenco, salsa and 1960's twist, among others. Classes also feature a ballet themed warm up and each dance is approximately 2.5 minutes long with customised music for each dance. DDMIX for schools is a social enterprise. =Modelling= Bussell has modelled clothes for Mulberry, Bruce Oldfield and Marks & Spencer. She has also been photographed for Tatler, Vogue and Vanity Fair.

Michael James Heney had secured the right-of-way up the Copper River in 1904. He started building the railway from Cordova, Alaska in 1906. The town of Cordova, Alaska, was actually named by Heney on March 13, 1906,Tower, 2003 based on the original name given by Salvador Fidalgo. Both these railroads were abandoned and little remains of them. Only a 0-4-0 locomotive, \\"Ole\\", located near Goose City on a siding of the Alaska Anthracite Railroad Company is the only equipment left. Many of the holdings of the CR&NW; railroad including Ole were acquired for this railroad by Mr. Clark Davis and his partners in 1908 after a major storm destroyed the Katalla area facilities in 1907. The town of Cordova would like to move Ole to a memorial site in Cordova to celebrate its role in these railroads. Ole was declared eligible for the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. In 1905 Myron K. Rodgers received a four-year contract to assist the Guggenheim family with their interests in Alaska.Myron K. Rodgers' obituary, 1917 This work consisted of establishing coal claims in the Bering River coal field and building a railroad (Northwestern) to serve them. Myron Rodgers employed his brother Wesley P. Rodgers to carry out the surveys in 1906 and to build the railroad in 1907. The railroad started at Palm Point and extended to the northeast past the town of Katalla towards the coal fields. At Palm Point a loading pier was built into the bay and a branch line for the Copper River railroad was extended west to connect to it.Katalla Company, Copper River & Northwestern Ry., United States Surveys, Terminal & Station Grounds at Katalla, Alaska. (July 1, 1907), ASL-P11-034, http://vilda.alaska.edu The 1907 winter storm destroyed all of these facilities, including the engine house and support base. By Oct. 1906, Heney had retired and decided to sell his Copper River right-of-way to the Alaska Syndicate that consisted of M. Guggenheim & Sons and J.P. Morgan & Co. However, he returned to work for Daniel Guggenheim on the Copper River railway in 1907 after the destruction of the winter storm. Guggenheim had decided Cordova was a better starting point. The railroad was built by the Kennecott Corporation (now part of the Alaska Syndicate) between 1908 and 1911 to take copper ore from Kennecott, Alaska to Cordova, Alaska, a distance of 315 km (196 mi). The Alaska Syndicate included investment by J.P. Morgan. He had earlier bought John Rosene's Northwestern Commercial Company, an empire of mercantile companies, shipping interests, and railroad. The syndicate started construction from Cordova, the Bonanza mine site at Kennecott, and at a point midway where the Nizina River merged with the Copper River. Challenges included bridging the Kuskulana River canyon and the Copper River with the Million Dollar Bridge. \\"The completion of the Million Dollar Bridge in the summer of 1910 effectively guaranteed the success of the rail project and the shipment of the first load of Kennecott ore in early 1911.\\" Heney had traveled to New York in 1909 to meet with Daniel Guggenheim and other board members about the railroad progress. On his return journey, he departed Seattle on 23 Aug. 1909 aboard the steamship Ohio. On 25 Aug., the Ohio struck an uncharted rock and sank. Heney finally made it to Cordova on 18 Sept. On 30 Nov. 1909 the railroad reached the Tiekel River, completing the first phase of the contract. Heney made another trip to New York to turn over that portion of the railroad to the Katalla Company. On the return trip he spent the winter in Seattle. His health failing, Heney finally succumbed to pulmonary tuberculosis on 4 Oct. 1910. The last spike in the construction, a \\"copper spike\\", was driven on 29 March 1911, by Chief Engineer E. C. Hawkins and Superintendent Samuel Murchison at Kennicott. The cost of the railway at $25 million was justified because the mines produced $200 million worth of copper ore during their operation of which at least 50 percent was profit. There were 129 bridges constructed between Cordova and Chitina. As far as is known, the CR&NW; was the only railway in Alaska to employ wigwags at railroad crossings. The good ore in the mines ran out and the last train ran on 11 Nov. 1938. In 1941, the Kennecott Corporation donated the railroad right-of-way to the United States \\"for use as a public highway\\". In 1953 conversion was started. The Alaska Dept. of Highways had extended the Copper River Highway to Mile 59, from Cordova to the Million Dollar Bridge, by 1964. However, the damage to 28 bridges after the Good Friday earthquake delayed further construction. By 1972 the highway extended to Mile 72 and south 20 miles from Chitina. The bridge has recently (2005) been repaired. Bridge 339 washed out in 2012 and cut the access to the bridge. The roadbed from Chitina to McCarthy now forms the McCarthy Road. Historic designations Southern portion of the Copper River showing the location of the railway from Cordova to Kennicott On April 24, 1973, the railway remains, comprising 11 trestles, an abandoned native village with a Russian post and the Tiekel Station, were added as a historic district to the National Register of Historic Places. The railway's bunkhouse and messhouse at Chitina were also added to the register on December 5, 2002. The 0-4-0 tank engine, Number 3, \\"Ole\\", was declared eligible for the National Register in 1988.

Aviation medicine, also called flight medicine or aerospace medicine, is a preventive or occupational medicine in which the patients/subjects are pilots, aircrews, or astronauts. The specialty strives to treat or prevent conditions to which aircrews are particularly susceptible, applies medical knowledge to the human factors in aviation and is thus a critical component of aviation safety. A military practitioner of aviation medicine may be called a flight surgeon and a civilian practitioner is an aviation medical examiner. One of the biggest differences between the military and civilian flight doctors is the military flight surgeon's requirement to log flight hours. Overview Broadly defined, this subdiscipline endeavors to discover and prevent various adverse physiological responses to hostile biologic and physical stresses encountered in the aerospace environment. Problems range from life support measures for astronauts to recognizing an ear block in an infant traveling on an airliner with elevated cabin pressure altitude. Aeromedical certification of pilots, aircrew and patients is also part of Aviation Medicine. A final subdivision is the AeroMedical Transportation Specialty. These military and civilian specialists are concerned with protecting aircrew and patients who are transported by AirEvac aircraft (helicopters or fixed-wing airplanes). Atmospheric physics potentially affect all air travelers regardless of the aircraft. As humans ascend through the first 9100-12,300 m (30,000-40,000 ft), temperature decreases linearly at an average rate of 2 ¬∞C (3.6 ¬∞F) per 305 m (1000 ft). If sea-level temperature is 16 ¬∞C (60 ¬∞F), the outside air temperature is approximately ‚àí57 ¬∞C (‚àí70 ¬∞F) at 10,700 m (35,000 ft). Pressure and humidity also decline, and aircrew are exposed to radiation, vibration and acceleration forces (the latter are also known as \\"g\\" forces). Aircraft life support systems such as oxygen, heat and pressurization are the first line of defense against most of the hostile aerospace environment. Higher performance aircraft provide more sophisticated life support equipment, such as \\"G-suits\\" to help the body resist the adverse effects of acceleration, along with pressure breathing apparatus, or ejection seats or other escape equipment. Every factor contributing to a safe flight has a failure rate. The crew of an aircraft is no different. Aviation medicine aims to keep this rate in the humans involved equal to or below a specified risk level. This standard of risk is also applied to airframe, avionics and systems associated with flights. AeroMedical examinations aim at screening for elevation in risk of sudden incapacitation, such as a tendency towards myocardial infarction (heart attacks), epilepsy or the presence of metabolic conditions diabetes, etc. which may lead to hazardous condition at altitude. The goal of the AeroMedical Examination is to protect the life and health of pilots and passengers by making reasonable medical assurance that an individual is fit to fly. Other screened conditions such as colour blindness can prevent a person from flying because of an inability to perform a function that is necessary. In this case to tell green from red. These specialized medical exams consist of physical examinations performed by an Aviation Medical Examiner or a military Flight Surgeon, doctors trained to screen potential aircrew for identifiable medical conditions that could lead to problems while performing airborne duties. In addition, this unique population of aircrews is a high-risk group for several diseases and harmful conditions due to irregular work shifts with irregular sleeping and irregular meals (usually carbonated drinks and high energy snacks) and work-related stress.

It is most widely known for also being a prop in the American television series Star Trek: The Next Generation. There are also computer versions of the game. Rules The game board for Terrace has either 64 or 36 squares of uniform color, arranged in L-shaped levels (\\"terraces\\") that rise stepwise from the board's lowest points in two diagonally opposite corners to its highest points in the other two corners. All pieces are shaped alike and move according to the same rules, but they are of four different sizes and vary in capturing \\"power.\\" One of each player's smallest pieces has the letter \\"T\\" carved into it and has a role somewhat similar to the king in chess. The object is to win either by moving your \\"T\\" piece from its starting point at one corner to an opposite corner, or by capturing your opponent's \\"T\\". Players can move any number of squares on the same terrace, and are allowed to jump over their own pieces. Players can move up a terrace by either going straight up or diagonally up. Players can move down a terrace by going straight down. Opponent's pieces, and even one's own pieces, may be captured by moving diagonally down. Pieces may only capture those of equal or lesser size. It is courteous to say 'Terrace' when the opponent's \\"T\\" piece is placed in jeopardy of being caught the next turn; \\"Terrace-Mate\\" should be said when the opponent's \\"T\\" piece cannot escape. In 3 and 4 player games, when a player loses his or her \\"T\\", all of their pieces are removed from the board; other players continue the game. If a player cannot make a move during his or her turn, the game is a draw, with no winner or loser. History The original 8√ó8 game of Terrace was invented in 1950 by Dutch-born Anton Dresden (September 8, 1915 - July 3, 2006), with rules that \\"proved unworkable\\"; in 1988, while living in Lake Oswego, Oregon, Dresden showed his game to Buzz Siler, who bought the rights to Dresden's design for $100 and, over time, created a simplified set of rules. After the game was introduced in 1991, Terrace won a number of major awards and was subsequently featured on Star Trek: The Next Generation as a permanent prop. In 1997, a revised version was introduced, with the board changed to 36 squares, with 12 pieces per player instead of 16. Two rows separate the two players' pieces, instead of four. The change came about because of legal problems with the owners of the molds to the original version of the game.

Chapter 1, location 281‚Äì296 Like most Bulgarians who were the predominant ethnic element in the region of Macedonia during that time, the family of Mikhail Ivanov was persecuted by the Serbian army after the end of the Balkan War. They were forced to leave their home in spring, 1907 due to destruction of the village. The family finally found shelter and settled in Varna, Bulgaria.Feuerstein, Georg (1994). Chapter 1, location 406 At the age of 17, after a childhood passed in poverty, he met Master Peter Deunov (1864‚Äì1944), the founder of the Universal White Brotherhood in the city of Varna, Bulgaria. A few months later in 1918, he followed Master Deunov to the capital, Sofia.Feuerstein, Georg (1994). Chapter2, Location 735 During the early years of his discipleship, Aivanhov was quite poor. He owned a bed, some books, a violin (given to him by Deunov) and a few shabby clothes. He spent most of his time on spiritual retreats in the mountains, where he studied and meditated, occasionally taking a job to earn his keep. Deunov also obliged him to broaden his conventional knowledge by pursuing studies at the University of Sofia, and he enrolled in courses on psychology, education philosophy, mathematics, chemistry, astronomy & medicine between 1923 and 1931. From around 1932 to around 1937, he worked as a school teacher and then a high school principal.Feuerstein, Georg (1994). Chapter 1 location 771‚Äì776 In 1937 with the approach of the Second World War, Peter Deunov foresaw that political unrest, war and the spread of communism would lead to a ban on all spiritual associations in Bulgaria and so he entrusted Mikhail Ivanov with bringing his teaching to France. Deunov chose Aivanhov out of 40,000 other students.Feuerstein, Georg (1994). Chapter 1 location p849‚ÄúOmraam Mikhael Aivanov‚Äù. Retrieved October 24, 2017. On July 22, 1937 he arrived in France penniless, with no knowledge of French and only one contact person in France, Stella Bellemin, a Bulgarian expatriate. However, Aivanhov turned out to be an excellent linguist. He took no money from his students or charged for his lectures apart from one exception when touring America. The money was banked and used later for a publishing project. On January 29, 1938, he gave his first public talk in the Luxembourg Hall, Place de la Sorbonne. This was the first of over 5000 conferences.Feuerstein, Georg (1994). Chapter 1 location p894-943Frenette (2008) p722 In 1944 he published his first collection of talks.‚Äúchronology‚Äù.

Chapter 3, Location 1075 He taught mainly in France, and he created the spiritual centers Bonfin in Fr√©jus, France and Izgrev, Sofia in his native Bulgaria, but also traveled a great deal. From 1938 until 1986 he gave some 4,500 talks in French, first of all in France (in Paris and its outskirts, and later at Fr√©jus in the Var region), and then in Switzerland (spiritual center Videlinata), Canada, the United States, India, Sweden and Norway. He also visited many other countries. His works which include 44 pocketbooks and 32 complete works are based on his lectures, which were recorded first in shorthand and since 1960 on audio and video tape. Finally, in 1972 Prosveta Publishing House released several collections of these talks in the form of books and brochures (translated into 30 languages), CDs and DVDs with subtitles.Prosveta-Canada In 1959, he traveled to India, where he met saint, Neem Karoli Baba, whom Baba Ram Dass/Richard Alpert made famous in North America. Babaji referred to Aivanhov as 'the French Sadhu' The name Omraam was given to him by three sages who approached Aivanhov while he was in India, meditating and uttered the word 'Omraam' thereafter he was known as Omraam Mikha√´l A√Øvanhov.

He died on December 25, 1986 in Fr√©jus, France.Feuerstein, Georg (1994). Chapter 3, Location 1452 Central idea Aivanhov's philosophy teaches that everybody, regardless of race, religion, social position, intellectual ability or material means, is able to take part in the realization of a new period of brotherhood and peace on earth. This happens through the individual's personal transformation: growth in perfection and in harmony with the divine world. Whatever the topic, he invariably focuses on how one can better conduct life on earth. Aivanhov taught that to achieve a better life, one must have a high ideal: \\"... if you have a High Ideal, such as the bringing of the Kingdom of God on earth, you obtain everything you wished for, you taste plenitude.\\"Omraam Mikha√´l A√Øvanhov The High Ideal Initiatic Science A√Øvanhov teaches the ancient principles of initiatic science. He describes the cosmic laws governing both the universe and the human being, the macrocosm and microcosm, and the exchanges that constantly take place between them. This knowledge has taken different forms throughout the centuries. It is the perennial wisdom expressed through various religions, each adapted to the spirit of a particular time, people, and level of spiritual evolution. Aivanhov's teaching incorporates aspects of Esoteric Christianity that relate to finding the \\"Kingdom of God on earth\\" within the individual. One of the essential truths of initiatic science, according to Aivanhov, is that (in the higher world) all things are linked. Thus committing oneself to the Kingdom of God on earth makes it realizable: \\"The real science is to form within ourselves, in the depths of our being, this Body that Initiates call the Body of Glory, the Body of Light, the Body of Christ.\\" Bibliography The Complete Works (only 19 volumes from 32 available in English) * Volume 1 ‚Äì The Second Birth ‚Äì Love Wisdom Truth * Volume 2 ‚Äì Spiritual Alchemy * Volume 5 ‚Äì Life Force * Volume 6 ‚Äì Harmony * Volume 7 ‚Äì The Mysteries of Yesod ‚Äì Foundations of the Spiritual Life * Volume 10 ‚Äì The Splendour of Tiphareth ‚Äì The Yoga of the Sun * Volume 11 ‚Äì The Key to the Problems of Existence * Volume 12 ‚Äì Cosmic Moral Laws * Volume 13 ‚Äì A New Earth ‚Äì Methods, Exercises, Formulas, Prayers * Volume 14 ‚Äì Love and Sexuality, part 1 * Volume 15 ‚Äì Love and Sexuality, part 2 * Volume 16 ‚Äì Hrani Yoga ‚Äì The Alchemical and Magical Meaning of Nutrition * Volume 17 ‚Äì 'Know Thyself' Jnana Yoga, part 1 * Volume 18 ‚Äì 'Know Thyself' Jnana Yoga, part 2 * Volume 25 ‚Äì A New Dawn: Society and Politics in the Light of Initiatic Science, part 1 * Volume 26 ‚Äì A New Dawn: Society and Politics in the Light of Initiatic Science, part 2 * Volume 29 ‚Äì On the Art of Teaching ‚Äì From the Initiatic Point of View, part 3 * Volume 30 ‚Äì Life and Work in an Initiatic School ‚Äì Training for the Divine, part 1 * Volume 32 ‚Äì The Fruits of the Tree of Life ‚Äì The Cabbalistic Tradition Brochures * 301 ‚Äì The New Year * 302 ‚Äì Meditation * 303 ‚Äì Respiration * 304 ‚Äì Death and the Life Beyond Izvor Collection * 201 ‚Äì Toward a Solar Civilisation *202 ‚Äì Man, Master of his Destiny *203 ‚Äì Education Begins Before Birth *204 ‚Äì The Yoga of Nutrition *205 ‚Äì Sexual Force or the Winged Dragon *207 ‚Äì What is a Spiritual Master? *210 ‚Äì The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil *212 ‚Äì Light as a Living Spirit *213 ‚Äì Man's Two Natures: Human and Divine *214 ‚Äì Hope for the World: Spiritual Galvanoplasty *215 ‚Äì The True Meaning of Christ's Teaching *217 ‚Äì New Light on the Gospels *218 ‚Äì The Symbolic Language of Geometrical Figures *223 ‚Äì Creation: Artistic and Spiritual *224 ‚Äì The Powers of Thought *229 ‚Äì The Path of Silence * 233 ‚Äì Youth: Creators of the Future * 236 ‚Äì Angels and other Mysteries of The Tree of Life * 239 ‚Äì Love Greater Than Faith References    Margit Kranewitter, Aspects de la Peinture Visionnaire Initiatique, (1980 M√©moire Universitaire), in 2016 a book in Stella Mattutina Edizioni, Italy. * Ouriel Zohar, Les aspects th√©√¢traux dans une soci√©t√© collectiviste, religieuse et universelle in \\"Misli, Rivistadel Centro Studi Omraam Mikha√´l A√Øvanhov\\", Revue de L'Universit√† per Stranieri di Perugia no. 5, p. 59-79, 2018.

Testers who pass the CHSPE receive a legal diploma equivalent entitled Certificate of Proficiency, from the California State Board of Education. All individuals and institutions subject to California law that require a high school diploma must accept the certificate as a requirement satisfaction. The U.S. Office of Personnel Management has ruled it acceptable in federal civilian employment applications, and the U.S. Department of Education, including Federal Student Aid, recognizes the CHSPE as a high school diploma equivalent in financial aid applications. Featured in the TV show, 7th Heaven, as a means for the character of Simon Camden to start college early, notable real alums include Grey's Anatomy's Chyler Leigh and other entertainment industry professionals. Eligibility Testers must be at least 16 years old or enrolled in the 10th grade for at least two semesters to take the CHSPE. There is no upper age limit. Testers must pay $130 (2019-2020) by the regular registration deadline or more if late, and sit during one or more of the three exam dates offered a year. Structure The exam tests individuals based on the high school curriculum in California, which may or may not be similar to curriculum in other states. Though accepted within the state and federal offices, testers must check to see if their college of choice outside of California will accept the test results. Another option for CHSPE test-takers is to enroll in a community college and transfer to their university of choice after two years. Those who have taken the California High School Exit Exam (CAHSEE), required of all high school students to graduate in California, will find the CHSPE similar in format, but with a longer exam and more difficult questions. The CHSPE tests mathematics and English-Language Arts (reading and writing) ability. The English-Language Arts section includes grammar and vocabulary questions, and also asks the examinee to write an essay. The math section assesses students on geometry, algebra, and pre-algebra. Testers have three and a half hours to complete the exam, and are free to divide their time as they wish between the two sections. Because the math and English sections are graded separately and can be passed separately, some students can sit for the exam twice, with three and a half hours for the math section and three and a half hours for English. =Mathematics= The CHSPE mathematics section has 50 multiple-choice questions broken into 4 content clusters: number sense and operations; patterns, relationships, and algebra; data, statistics, and probability; and geometry and measurement. Testers must score at least 350 within a range of 250‚Äì450 to pass the math section. =English-Language Arts= The CHSPE English-language arts section has two subtests of reading and language (writing). Reading The reading subtest has 84 multiple- choice questions broken into seven content clusters: initial understanding; interpretation; critical analysis; strategies; synonyms; multiple meaning words; and context clues. Testers must score at least 350 within a range of 250‚Äì450 to pass the reading subtest. Language with writing The language subtest has 48 multiple-choice questions broken into six content clusters: capitalization; usage; punctuation; sentence structure; pre-writing; content and organization, in addition to a writing subtask. Testers must score at least 350 within a range of 250‚Äì450 on the language subtest, in addition to at least a 2.5 within a score range of 1-5 on the writing subtask to pass the English-language arts section. CHSPE vs. GED The CHSPE is only given in English, and targeted at homeschoolers and students who want to legally exit high school before 18 and/or start college early. Others are entertainment industry or agriculture professionals who prefer to start working at an earlier age. In contrast, the GED is for adults 18 or over, who did not graduate high school, and is given in English, Spanish, and French. Benefits Upon passing the exam, testers receive a legal diploma equivalent and official transcript containing a score report, which can be used to enroll in college early. As with any college enrollment, assessment tests may be required upon college entrance to determine the student's ability for placement in the appropriate courses. If a tester is under 18 and passes the exam, he or she may not leave high school without parent or guardian consent. The CHSPE eliminates the need for minors to get a work permit before being employed, but is not otherwise considered \\"emancipation,\\" and laws regulating minors still apply.

The third \\"F.E.2\\" type was operated as a day and night bomber and fighter by the Royal Flying Corps during the First World War. Along with the single-seat D.H.2 pusher biplane and the Nieuport 11, the F.E.2 was instrumental in ending the Fokker Scourge that had seen the German Air Service establish a measure of air superiority on the Western Front from the late summer of 1915 to the following spring. Design and development The Farman Experimental 2 designation refers to three quite distinct designs ‚Äì all pushers based on the general layout employed by the French aircraft designers, the Farman Brothers ‚Äì but otherwise completely different aircraft. This \\"re-use\\" of the F.E.2 designation has caused much confusion. =F.E.2 (1911)= The first F.E.2 (1911) The first F.E.2 was designed by Geoffrey de Havilland at the Royal Aircraft Factory in 1911. Although it was claimed to be a rebuild of the F.E.1, a pusher biplane designed and built by de Havilland before he joined the Factory's staff, it was in fact an entirely new aircraft, with construction completed before the F.E.1 was wrecked in a crash in August 1911.Hare 1990, p. 189. The new aircraft resembled the final form of the F.E.1, with no front elevator, but seated a crew of two in a wood and canvas nacelle, and was powered by a 50 hp (37 kW) Gnome rotary engine.Jackson 1987, p. 35. It made its maiden flight on 18 August 1911, flown by de Havilland. It was fitted with floats in April 1912, first flying in this form on 12 April 1912, but was underpowered and its engine was therefore replaced by a 70 hp (52 kW) Gnome, this allowed it to take off carrying a passenger while fitted with floats. Later in the year the F.E.2, refitted with a landplane undercarriage, was modified to carry a Maxim machine gun on a flexible mount in the nose.Hare 1990, p. 200. =F.E.2 (1913)= The second aircraft bearing the F.E.2 designation (1913). The second F.E.2 was officially a rebuild of the first F.E.2, and may indeed have included some components from the earlier aircraft. It was, however, a totally new and much more modern design, larger and heavier than the 1911 aircraft, with the wingspan increased from 33 ft (10.06 m) to 42 ft (12.80 m) and a new, more streamlined nacelle. Loaded weight rose from 1,200 lb (545 kg) to 1,865 lb (848 kg). The new F.E.2 used the outer wings of the B.E.2a, with wing warping instead of ailerons for lateral control, and was powered by a 70 hp Renault engine.Hare 1990, pp. 201‚Äì203. It was destroyed when it spun into the ground from 500 ft (150 m) on 23 February 1914, probably because of insufficient fin area. The pilot, R. Kemp, survived the crash, but his passenger was killed.Hare 1990, p.202.Winchester 2004, p. 206. =F.E.2 (1914)= Work started on another totally new design in mid-1914, the F.E.2a, specifically intended as a \\"fighter\\", or machine gun carrier ‚Äì in the same class as the Vickers FB.5 \\"Gunbus\\".Hare 1990, p. 204. Apart from the \\"Farman\\" layout it bore no direct relationship with either of the two earlier designs: the outer wing panels were identical with those of the B.E.2c. It was a two- seater with the observer in the nose of the nacelle and the pilot sitting above and behind. The observer was armed with a .303 in Lewis machine gun firing forward on a specially designed, \\"witches broomstick\\" mounting that gave it a wide field of fire. The first production order for 12 aircraft was placed \\"off the drawing board\\" (i.e. prior to first flight) shortly after the outbreak of the First World War.Bruce 1968, p. 36.Raleigh 1922, pp. 249‚Äì250. By this time, the \\"pusher\\" configuration was aerodynamically obsolescent, but was retained to allow a clear forward field of fire. F.E.2a with original undercarriage F.E.2b with \\"V\\" undercarriage The undercarriage of the \\"third\\" F.E.2 was particularly well designed ‚Äì a small nose wheel prevented nose-overs when landing on soft ground, and the oleo type shock absorbers were also appreciated by crews landing in rough, makeshift fields. In order to reduce weight and drag some of the production aircraft were fitted with a normal \\"V\\" type undercarriage. This was not universally popular and when a method was devised of removing the nose wheel in the field without disturbing the shock absorbers, this became the most common form of the F.E.2 undercarriage.Hare 1990, pp. 208‚Äì209 The \\"V\\" undercarriage remained standard for F.E.2 night bombers, as it permitted the carriage of a large bomb under the nacelle. The first production batch consisted of 12 of the initial F.E.2a variant,Bruce 1952, p. 724. with a large air brake under the top centre section, and a Green E.6 engine. The first F.E.2a made its maiden flight on 26 January 1915, but was found to be underpowered, and was re-engined with a Beardmore 120 hp (89 kW) liquid-cooled inline engine, as were the other eleven aircraft.Bruce 1968, p. 35. The F.E.2a was quickly followed by the main production model, the F.E.2b, again powered by a Beardmore, initially of 120 hp, although later F.E.2bs received the 160 hp (119 kW) model. The air brake of the \\"a\\" failed to deliver a worthwhile reduction in the landing run and was omitted to simplify production.Bruce 1968, p. 38. The type could also carry an external bomb load, and was routinely fitted with a standard air-photography camera. A total of 1,939 F.E.2bs were built,Mason 1992, p. 13. only a few of them at the Royal Aircraft Factory, as most construction was by private British manufacturers such as G & J Weir, Boulton & Paul Ltd and Ransomes, Sims & Jefferies. Early in the F.E.2b's career, a second Lewis gun was added in front of the pilot's cockpit, on a high telescopic mounting so that the pilot could fire forward, over his observer's head. In practice, this gun was appropriated by the observers, especially when they discovered that by climbing onto the rim of their cockpits they could fire backwards over the top wing ‚Äì to some extent overcoming the notorious deficiency of pusher types in rear defence, although even this failed to cover a very large blind spot under the tail. The observer's perch was a precarious one, especially when firing the \\"rear gun\\", and he was liable to be thrown out of his cockpit, although his view was excellent in all directions except directly to the rear. An F.E.2d observer demonstrating the use of the rear-firing Lewis gun, which required him to stand on the rim of his cockpit. Note the camera, and the (non-standard) fixed Lewis gun for the pilot. The arrangement was described by Frederick Libby, an American ace who served as an F.E.2b observer in 1916: The Royal Aircraft Factory was primarily a research establishment and other experiments were carried out using F.E.2bs, including the testing of a generator-powered searchlight attached between two .303 inch (7.7 mm) Lewis guns, apparently for night fighting duties. The F.E.2c was an experimental night fighter and bomber variant of the F.E.2b, the main change being the switching of the pilot's and observer's positions so that the pilot had the best view for night landings. Two were built in 1916, with the designation being re-used in 1918 for a similar night bomber version of the F.E.2b, which was used by 100 Squadron.Bruce 1968, p. 46. In the end, the observer-first layout was retained for the standard aircraft. F.E 2d with nosewheel removed The final production model was the F.E.2d (386 built) which was powered by a Rolls-Royce Eagle engine with 250 hp (186 kW). While the more powerful engine made little difference in maximum speed, especially at low altitude, it did improve altitude performance, with an extra 10 mph at 5,000 ft. The Rolls-Royce engine also improved payload, so that in addition to the two observer's guns, an additional one or two Lewis guns could be mounted to fire forward, operated by the pilot. At least two F.E.2bs were fitted with RAF 5 engines (a pusher version of the RAF 4 engine) in 1916 but no production followed.Bruce 1982, p. 417. The F.E.2h was an F.E.2 powered by a Siddeley Puma. The prototype (A6545) was converted in February 1918 by Ransomes, Sims & Jefferies, in the hope of producing a night fighter with superior performance. When tested at Martlesham Heath, it proved to be little better than the F.E.2b. Despite this, three more aircraft were converted to F.E.2h standard, these being fitted with a six- pounder (57 mm) Davis gun, mounted to fire downwards for ground attack purposes.Cole and Cheesman 1984, p. 373.Bruce 1982, pp. 417‚Äì418. While the F.E.2d was replaced by the Bristol Fighter, the older F.E.2b proved an unexpected success as a light tactical night bomber, and remained a standard type in this role for the rest of the war. Its climb rate and ceiling were too poor for it to make a satisfactory night fighter. Operational history An F.E.2b used as RFC chaplain's \\"pulpit\\" The F.E.2a entered service in May 1915 with No. 6 Squadron RFC, which used the F.E.2 in conjunction with B.E.2s and a single Bristol Scout.Bruce 1982, p. 401.Mason 1992, p. 12. The first squadron to be equipped entirely with the F.E.2 was 20 Squadron, deploying to France on 23 January 1916. At this stage it served as a fighter-reconnaissance aircraft ‚Äì eventually about ‚Öî of the F.E.2s were built as fighters (816) and ‚Öì as bombers (395). The F.E.2b and F.E.2d variants remained in day operations well into 1917, while the \\"b\\" continued as a standard night bomber until August 1918. At its peak, the F.E.2b equipped 16 RFC squadrons in France and six Home Defence squadrons in England. On 18 June 1916, German flying ace Max Immelmann was killed in combat with F.E.2bs of No. 25 Squadron RFC. The squadron claimed the kill, but the German version of the encounter is either that Immelmann's Fokker Eindecker broke up after his synchroniser gear failed and he shot off his own propeller, or that he was hit by friendly fire from German anti- aircraft guns. In any case, by this time the F.E.2b was at least encountering the German monoplane fighters on more or less even terms and the so-called \\"Fokker scourge\\" had ended.Guttman 2009, p. 28. By autumn 1916, the arrival of more modern German fighters such as the Albatros D.I and Halberstadt D.II meant that even the F.E.2d was outperformed and by April 1917, it had been withdrawn from offensive patrols. Despite its obsolescence in 1917, the F.E.2 was still well liked by its crews for its strength and good flight characteristics and it still occasionally proved a difficult opponent for even the best German aces. Rittmeister Baron von Richthofen was badly wounded in the head during combat with F.E.2d aircraft in June 1917 ‚Äì the Red Baron, like most German pilots of the period, classed the F.E.2 as a \\"Vickers\\" type, confusing it with the earlier Vickers F.B.5. In combat with single-seater fighters, the pilots of F.E.2b and F.E.2d fighters would form what was probably the first use of what later became known as a Lufbery circle (defensive circle).Bruce 1952, p. 725. In the case of the F.E.2, the intention was that the gunner of each aircraft could cover the blind spot under the tail of his neighbour and several gunners could fire on any enemy attacking the group. On occasion formations of F.E.2s fought their way back from far over the lines, while under heavy attack from German fighters, using this tactic.Cheesman 1960, p. 44. Although outclassed as a day fighter, the F.E.2 proved very suitable for use at night and was used as a night fighter in home defence squadrons on anti-Zeppelin patrols and as a light tactical night bomber. It was first used as a night bomber in November 1916, with the first specialist F.E.2b night bomber squadrons being formed in February 1917.Mason 1994, p. 73. F.E.2bs were used as night bombers in eight bomber squadrons until the end of the First World War, with up to 860 being converted to, or built as bombers. Service as a night fighter was less successful, owing to the type's poor climb and ceiling.Bruce 1968, pp. 42‚Äì43. F.E.2bs were experimentally fitted with flotation bags for operation over water and were also used to conduct anti-submarine patrols, operating from the Isle of Grain at the mouth of the Thames River. A total of 35 aircraft derived from the F.E.2 were sold to China in 1919 by Vickers as Vickers Instructional Machines (VIM), to be used as advanced trainers, having a redesigned nacelle fitted with dual controls and powered by a Rolls-Royce Eagle VIII engine.Andrews and Morgan 1988, p. 477. Notable appearances in popular fiction Derek Robinson's novel War Story is about the fictional Hornet Squadron flying the F.E.2b, and later the F.E.2d, giving an account of flying the fighter in the months leading up to the Battle of the Somme. Robert Radcliffe's novel Across the Blood-Red Skies is narrated by an F.E.2 pilot, and offers an insight into the skills required to fly the aeroplane. William Stanley's novel One Spring in Picardy is the story of a night bomber FE2b squadron in France in the spring of 1918. Captain W.E. Johns' character Biggles starts his operational career in the fictional 169 squadron, flying the F.E.2b.Johns, W. E. Biggles Learns to Fly. London: Boys' Friend Library (Amalgamated Press), 1935. Grif Hosker's five book series about Royal Flying Corps air combat in WWI: 1914, 1915-Fokker Scourge, 1916-Angels Over the Somme, 1917-Eagles Fall, and 1918-We Will Remember Them, vividly depict combat from an F.E.2. The protagonist, (a fictional character) Capt Bill Harsker, begins his flying career as an enlisted gunner in the front of a \\"gunbus\\" and advances to become a leading ace pilot. By the 1917 book, the F.E.2 suffers badly at the hands of the more advanced German aircraft and Harsker transitions to a Sopwith. Survivors and replicas The airworthy replica built by Vintage Aviator Ltd makes its debut on 25 April 2009 at Hood Aerodrome, New Zealand. The Royal Air Force Museum London displays an F.E.2b. The wings and tail struts are replicas but the aircraft's nacelle and engine are original. The nacelle was made in 1918 by Richard Garrett & Sons, who were subcontracted to make the nacelles for Boulton & Paul Ltd, who assembled the complete aircraft. However, this nacelle was unfinished and never built into a complete aircraft. It was retained by Garretts until 1976 when it was passed to the RAF Museum. In 1986, the museum began a restoration project and commissioned the construction of replica wings and tail; a Beardmore engine was bought in New Zealand in 1992. The lengthy restoration was finally completed and the aircraft put on display in 2009. Two reproductions of the F.E.2b, one to full airworthiness standards and fitted with a genuine Beardmore engine, have been manufactured by The Vintage Aviator Ltd of New Zealand.Morgan, Rhys. \\"Building the FE.2B.\\" thevintageaviator.co.nz, 2009.

It had been a family- owned business since beginning as a weekly newspaper in 1915, until June 30, 2017, when it was assimilated into Canadian publisher Steven Malkowich's consortium of holdings. Coverage area The Valley Press covers the fast- growing Antelope Valley, especially the Palmdale/Lancaster Urbanized Area (a US Census Bureau defined term) and adjacent areas of north Los Angeles and southeastern Kern counties, including the upscale Los Angeles urban escapes of Acton and Agua Dulce. Other adjacent areas the Valley Press occasionally covers, particularly for aerospace related stories and local high school and college level sports, include the Victor Valley, Bakersfield and the southern San Joaquin Valley, and the Greater Los Angeles Area. Competitors in its market are the Daily News - Antelope Valley and the Los Angeles Times, both based in Los Angeles. History The Valley Press was founded by A.J. Hicks on Saturday, April 3, 1915, as the Palmdale Post. At the time, the Valley was home to about 3,500 people. Over the decades of the 20th century, the newspaper changed hands, and there were a few name changes as well. On May 4, 1950, the paper became known as the South Antelope Valley Press. On July 1, 1958, four men initiated a partnership between the Markham and Odett families. Arthur F. Folz was president of the board of directors in 1958, with Ralph and his brother Maurice W. Markham as vice presidents and Lamont Odett Sr. as secretary-treasurer. Ralph H. Markham bought out Maurice W. Markham, and Lamont Odett Sr. bought out Arthur F. Folz on April 1, 1961, to create the partnership of Ralph H. Markham and Lamont Odett Sr. In October 1975, Lamont Odett Sr. died and sons Bill and Monty Odett Jr. became co-publishers. On March 1, 1981, William C. Markham joined the Odetts in daily management of the paper and was elected corporate vice president and advertising director. William C. Markham became president of the board of directors after Ralph H. Markham's death in November 1985. The William Odett family had father William and his son Lamont (\\"Monty\\") Odett Sr. running day-to-day operations of The Yuma Morning Sun (Now The Yuma Sun) with William's new wife Miriam as part of the team in the circa 1925 to 1935 period in Yuma, Arizona. When the Morning Sun changed ownership in 1935, the Odetts moved to the San Fernando Valley, and later to Palmdale. The Markham family having become sole owners in January, 1994, William C. Markham its president and publisher, for the first time in its history the Antelope Valley Press ceased to be locally owned. The paper later dropped the \\"South\\" from its nameplate to become the Antelope Valley Press by the early 1960s. It was a Thursday afternoon weekly until 1959 when a Sunday edition debuted. The Tuesday edition was added in 1969, followed by Friday (1982) and Wednesday (1988), Saturday (1992) and finally the Monday edition in 1998, making the Antelope Valley Press a full-fledged daily newspaper - perhaps the first Mojave Desert California based newspaper to commence daily publishing with morning delivery. The paper remained in family hands, and had never been corporately owned until 30 June 2017, when Markham abruptly handed down termination notices to Antelope Valley Press staff, and cashed-out his position to a Canadian publisher, Steven Malkowich, for an undisclosed sum. Pejoratively known as \\"The Tuesday Massacre,\\" on the 25th of July, 2017, less than a month into the Malkowich acquisition, newly installed management summarily pink-slipped 17 senior staff. The largest lay-off in Antelope Valley Press history, at time of dismissal 17 senior employees were systematically ordered into the office at day's end, handed State of California EDD unemployment insurance pamphlets by Malkowich's newly installed enterprise management team, before being told they have 10 minutes to clean out their desks, and vacate the premises. Printing technology The Valley Press was famed locally from the late 1950s for its peach-colored newsprint while under the Odett/Markham family ownership. The paper stopped using peach newsprint in 1975 due to expense and the increased use of color ink. The newspaper moved into the digital age beginning in 1986 when City Editor Bill MacKenzie was given the assignment to find a publishing system. The result of that search was the installation of a Morris Publishing System network of personal computers for both classified and editorial requirements. That classified system was replaced in 1999 with Digital Technology Internal equipment. Editorial followed in 2002 to make the paper completely paginated in one system. The classified system was upgraded in early 2005; the editorial system by year's end. Editorial outlook The newspaper's editorial page is conservative in its political stance, and has long leaned toward the Republican Party, although this is gradually changing under its current publisher to reflect the current population and opinion trends of newer Valley residents. As a result, it will often publish two opinion pieces of opposing persuasions, side by side. The featured writers in them increasingly are local residents with strongly held views, which can become controversial at times. In order to read the online news, a login is required to continue reading because it has a paywall and prevents the readers from reading the news for free. Awards Dennis Anderson, a former wire-service reporter, became editor of the Valley Press in 1999. In December 2010, the Los Angeles Professional Chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists announced that he would be one of five distinguished journalists to be honored by the chapter at its March 2011 awards banquet, representing the print under 100,000 circulation category. SPJ cited the paper as the only family-owned independent daily newspaper in Los Angeles County and the winner of six general excellence rankings from the National Newspaper Association, one from Suburban Newspapers of America and a first place Freedom of Information award from the California Newspaper Publishers Association. In 2004, SNA and the American Press Institute named Anderson Journalist of the Year for his articles, written while embedded with the California National Guard in Iraq, about local citizen soldiers. A Valley Press legacy to the motorists of the Antelope Valley, as well as California and beyond is the Antelope Valley Freeway, which Lamont \\"Monty\\" Odett, Sr., championed in dealing with California state legislators in the 1950s and 1960s. Lamont Odett Vista Point - an Antelope Valley freeway rest area overlooking Palmdale - is named in his honor. References * Larsen, Lisa. \\"Antelope Valley Press buys complete system from DTI\\".

This article deals with only the period before the Treaty of Trianon of 1920. For lists of the individual counties, see Administrative divisions of the Kingdom of Hungary. For counties of Hungary since 1950, see Counties of Hungary.  Nomenclature  = Origin of the name = The Latin word comitatus is derived from the word comes, which originally stood for companion or retinue member. In the Early and High Middle Ages, the title comes was a noble title used in various meanings, in the Kingdom of Hungary especially (but not exclusively) in the meaning \\"county head\\". The Hungarian word megye is likely derived from Southern Slavic medja (meƒëa, –º–µ—í–∞) meaning approximately territorial border. The Slavic word in turn is related to Latin medius (middle) through a common Indo-European root. The original word is still used in present-day Slavic languages, i.e. in Slovak (as medza), in Slovenian (as meja), in Serbian and Croatian (as meƒëa, –º–µ—í–∞), in a similar sense, and seems to have meant, initially, the border of a county in the Hungarian language. Hungarian has another word (mezsgye) of the same origin meaning borderland. The Hungarian word isp√°n (county head) is derived from the Southern Slavic word ≈æupan (–∂—É–ø–∞–Ω), which was used by the Slavs living in the Carpathian Basin before the arrival of the Hungarians and stood for the head of various territorial units. Title ≈æupan was also used as a ruling title in medieval Serbia.  Comitatus vs. county  For centuries, the official written language of the Kingdom of Hungary was Latin. The Latin word for the English and Hungarian county, comitatus, is sometimes used in English. = Names in various languages = County: *Royal county: Latin (and other names), in later Hungarian : , in later Slovak: , in later German .

Municipal town: Hungarian: , Slovak: , German: Royal counties (late 10th century ‚Äì late 13th century) =History= The Hungarians settled in the Carpathian Basin in 895. The first counties were probably the counties situated in present-day northern Pannonia (Transdanubia) - they arose before 1000 or around 1000. The exact time of the creation of many other counties is disputed, many of them, however, arose not later than under the rule of Stephen I of Hungary. Initially there were also several small frontier counties (Latin: established for military purposes only (e. g. comitatus of Bolondus), which however ceased to exist in the 14th century when royal counties were transformed to noble ones. Initially, there were also some small special castle districts, which ceased to exist in the 13th century. =Functioning= Each county was the responsibility of a county head, whose seat was a castle - a quasi-capital of the county. The county head was the representative of the king, the judge, and the chief law enforcement officer in his respective territory. He collected the fees and payments in kind made by the subjects for the king, gave two thirds of them to the king and kept the rest. His castle had special fortifications and was able to withstand even long-term sieges. The sources mention deputy county heads in the 12th century for the first time. The royal county consisted of castle districts.  Noble counties (late 13th century ‚Äì 1848)  =History= In the late 13th century, the royal counties gradually turned into noble counties. The reasons for this development were: * The arrival of new hospites Hospites were foreign settlers in the Kingdom Hungary, who were allowed to apply their own foreign law in their settlements; particularly Germans and especially after 1242. This considerably restricted the real powers of the county heads, since the hospites were outside their jurisdiction. * At the end of the 12th century, and even more so in the early 13th century under King Andrew II, large parts of royal territory (i. e. of the kingdom) were donated to the so-called \\"royal servants\\" (in the 9th‚Äì12th centuries members of certain professions, mostly craftsmen, who were settled in special villages and served the king with their respective skills). * In the 13th century, the royal servants managed to co-ordinate their activities in order to increase their own powers at the expense of those of the county heads (see also the Golden Bull of 1222) and thus became nobles: servientes regis. As a result, by royal decrees of 1267, 1290, and 1298, the king could only confirm that the royal counties turned into noble ones. Nobles (mostly former royal servant families) became quasi-rulers in the counties. The change from a royal to a noble county, however, took place at different times in each county. In the 15th century, the borders of the counties stabilised and basically remained unchanged until 1920. Between the early 16th century and the late 17th century, however, most of the counties ceased to exist, because they became part of the Ottoman Empire (the Turks) or of Transylvania. After the final defeat of the Turks in 1718, the three southern counties Temesiensis, Torontaliensis and Krassoviensis created the special administrative district Banatus Temesiensis (Temeswar Banate). This district was dissolved again in 1779, but its southernmost part remained part of the Military Frontier (Confiniaria militaria) till the late 19th century. The bodies of the new counties considerably helped to defend the interests of lower and middle nobility with respect to the oligarchs, who were often the de facto rulers of the kingdom, and with respect to the absolutistic efforts of the Habsburg kings. The counties as noble institutions were abolished only in the course of the Revolution of 1848 by legal articles III‚ÄìV and XVI/ 1848. Counties of the Kingdom of Hungary proper (w/o the Grand Principality of Transylvania, Banat of Temeswar, and Croatian-Slavonian Kingdom) between 1782‚Äì85 as mapped during the Josephinian Land Survey, right before the Josephinian administrative reform.  Transitory period (1785‚Äì1790)  In 1785, king Joseph II decided to abolish the counties as entities of noble autonomy (self- governance) and introduced a new system of state administration in the Kingdom of Hungary. The kingdom including Croatia and Slavonia was primarily divided into 10 newly created military/administrative districts, each of which consisted of four to seven counties. The territory of the counties corresponded to the traditional one, but in 1786 many of them were merged and the counties became pure units of state administration ‚Äì main county heads were abolished, the county clerks became employees of the state, the courts became the responsibility of the state etc. The capitals of the districts were chosen so as to be situated right in the middle of the district. The number of processus districts was reduced. The official language became German (rather than Latin). The districts were headed by a commissioner appointed by the Austrian emperor (who was simultaneously the King of Hungary). In 1790, however, facing strong resistance against any kind of modernisation in Hungary, the king had to repeal the all the reforms and the old system was reinstated. =Functioning= Only the duty to support the king militarily, the territorial unit and formally also the title of county head remained from the former royal counties. The new county was a self-governing (autonomous) entity of lower gentry. It was led by the county head (comes), appointed by the king, and by his deputy, appointed by the county head. These two persons were the link between the king and the nobility. As a rule, the county heads (from the 15th /16th century onwards called main county head) were the supreme feudal lords of the county. From the beginning of the 14th century, the county head was at the same time the castellan of the respective county castle in 13 counties. People became county heads for a limited period of time and could be recalled by the king, but a number of prelates (from the 15th century also seculars) received the \\"eternal county leadership\\" of their diocese. Note that the formal title comes was also borne by some dignitaries of the Court (e. g. comes curiae) and other nobles in the Early Middle Ages, and then by other members of middle nobility in the Late Middle Ages, and it did not mean count in these cases. From the 13th-14th century onwards, the deputy county heads, and not the county head himself, were the real administrators of the county. This development was emphasised by the fact that the county heads were also higher dignitaries of the state or of the court at the same time (palatine, treasurer (Kingdom of Hungary), etc.), so that they did not have much time for the management of the county. The deputy county head 's role was to administer the county during the county head 's absence. Originally, the deputy county head was a personal employee of the king and thus the main person through which the king exercised influence in the county. At the same time, the deputy was the castellan of the castle of the county head or an economic officer (Latin: provisor) of the properties of the same. Initially, the nobles of the county could not influence the appointment of the deputy county head, but in the early 15th century, they managed to put through a rule that only a noble from the same county can become the deputy county head (see below). Initially, in the 13th century, influence of nobles made itself felt only in the judicial sphere. The judges of the servientes regis - the so-called iudices servientium - developed into the noble judges (see below), and the courts of the servientes regis - the so-called sedes iudiciaria or - developed into the county court (the Latin name remained ). The meetings were led by the county head, later de facto by his deputy (see below). Until the 15th century, the county head's co-judges were his deputy county head, the (usually four) noble judges, and a number of persons appointed ad hoc from among the present nobles. From the 15th century onwards, permanent jurors were elected from among the nobles of the county. The served as the court of first instance for minor disputes of the nobles and as the appeal instance for village courts and patrimonial courts (). From the beginning of their existence, the noble judges were the real representatives of county autonomy. They were elected by the congregatio generalis (see below) and were not only judges, but also political administrators of their respective processus districts (see below). They formed the core of the newly arising class of squires. Later, the counties even turned to political entities representing the noble autonomy (noble self- government). This evolution started especially under the kings Charles Robert and Louis I. From 1385 onwards, the counties were sending representatives to meetings of the Diet of the Kingdom of Hungary and they played a role in the collection and setting of taxes. But only in the early 15th century, the nobles managed to put through a rule that only a noble from the same county can become the deputy county head and a co-judge. From 1504 onwards the deputy county head's appointment had to be approved by the nobles (congregatio generalis -see below), so that the deputy county head definitively became the de facto leader of the county. The county head, appointed by the king from the oligarchs (supreme nobility), was only the formal representative of the county. The county authorities were very powerful and administered all spheres of public life. They were responsible for all inhabitants of the county, except for inhabitants of free royal towns (liberae regiae civitate), mining towns, free districts, and at the time of the Anjou kings also of royal castle domains. Until 1486, some members of the supreme nobility were exempt from the jurisdiction of the county, too. The most important body of self-government of the county was the congregatio generalis, i. e. the county assembly convened and led by the county head. Originally, this body was created and served only as a judicial body, which comprised the judge, the sedria members and 8 elected noble jurors, and which was usually convened once a year. At the same time, the inquisitio communis (hearing of a witness) enabled the nobles to influence the proceedings conducted at the royal curia. Gradually, judicial affairs were excluded from the meetings of the congregatio generalis, which thus turned from a judicial body into an administrative body. All nobles of the county participated in person in the meetings of the congregatio and the congregatio decided on all important political, military and economic affairs. As from the beginning of the 15th century, the territory of each county was divided into processus each of which was administered by one of the noble judges (there were therefore usually four in each county). The aim was to simplify the administration. The number of processus was increasing from the 18th century onwards, because the functions of the counties were increasing too. The processus, in turn, consisted of 2 to 6 circuits (Latin: circuli), each of which was the responsibility of a deputy noble judge. Until the 1840s (with an exception in 1785-1790), the official language of county administration was Latin. In 1840, the deputy county head (alisp√°n, Ger. Vicegespann or Vizegespan) was described as \\"the personage of the most importance in the county\\", having duties similar to an English sheriff but also presiding over the county court of justice. (The Obergespann, theoretically his superior, was usually a nobleman, who would commonly be in Vienna or Pesth and thus have little time for local affairs.) Furthermore, the Vicegespann presided over the county assembly, which had as late as 1840 a long list of powers, ranging from police regulations to tax, to improvements on bridges and roads.The British and Foreign Review (1840), London: Richard and John Edward Taylor  State counties (1849‚Äì1860)  In 1849, in the course of and after the defeat of the Magyars in the 1848-1849 Revolution, the Austrian Habsburgs established a military dictatorship in the Kingdom of Hungary and the counties were turned into simple state administration entities and authorities. = 1st provisional arrangement (1849‚Äì1850) = A provisional centralised administration started to be created by the Austrians in February 1849, Alexander Bach issued a decree on provisional organisation of the Kingdom of Hungary in early August 1849 and a regulation on the administrative system of the Kingdom of Hungary followed on October 24. Under this regulation: *Croatia-Slavonia, the Military frontier, Voivodina and the Temes- Banate were separated from the Kingdom of Hungary (which did not include Transylvania at that time) and directly subordinated to Vienna *the remaining territory of the Kingdom of Hungary was divided into 5 military districts (in present-day Slovakia: Bratislava, Ko≈°ice, in the remaining territory: Sopron, Pest-Buda, Oradea) led by generals appointed by the emperor, which in turn were divided into civil districts (around 4 in each military district), the civil districts were divided into counties (with their previous borders) and the counties into districts. German became the official language. = 2nd provisional arrangement (so-called Geringer Provisional Arrangement; September 13, 1850 ‚Äì January 18, 1853) = Under a regulation on provisional political administration of the Kingdom of Hungary issued on September 13, 1850, the territory was divided into the above 5 districts (called civil districts now), which in turn consisted of counties and the counties of districts. The territories of some counties changed, some counties were newly created. The districts were led by main district county heads, the counties by a chairman (German:Vorstand) and the districts by noble judges (German: Stuhlrichter). =\\"Definitive\\" arrangement (January 19, 1853 ‚Äì October 20, 1860)= Only slight changes were made to the previous arrangement. Each district was formally turned to an administrative territory of a governorship department (since July 1, 1860: administrative territory of the branche-offices of the governorship). Some county territories were slightly modified and they were led by commissioners. The only responsibilities of these state counties were political administration and the management of taxes. The courts were the responsibility of other entities. Transitory period (1860‚Äì1867) The situation prevailing before 1848 was restored in October 1860, both in terms of borders and in terms of noble autonomy. In 1863, however, the noble autonomy was replaced by an absolutist system of state administration again. Modernised counties (1867‚Äì1920) Map of 71 counties in the Lands of the Hungarian Crown (the Kingdom of Hungary proper and Kingdom of Croatia- Slavonia) around 1880 = History = After the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, in 1868 Transylvania was definitively reunited with the Kingdom of Hungary proper, and the town and district of Rijeka declared autonomous. In 1869, the counties lost the jurisdiction powers (the courts) as royal courts were organized. Modernization of the counties was then realized in two steps. First, an 1870 act of parliament unified the legal status and internal administrative structures of the various municipal (self-governing) administrative units, abolishing almost all historical privileges. However, this Municipalities Act retained the historical names and officials of the municipalities and did not touch their territories in general, so the territory and names of the counties still largely corresponded to those of the pre-1848 period. However, in addition to the 65 counties (49 in Hungary proper, 8 in Transylvania, and 8 in Croatia), there were 89 cities with municipal rights, including historical royal privileged towns and others, authorised by the 1870 Act, and other types of territorial municipalities (3 in Hungary proper and 18 in Transylvania), including privileged districts, the so-called seats of the Sz√©kely Land and Transylvanian Saxons and others. Thus, the total number of municipal entities was 175 under direct control of the central Hungarian government, of which about a third was a county. The main effect of the 1870 Municipalities Act was that it was no longer only the nobles and other privileged groups who could lead the municipalities (see Functioning). The system of districts (historically, in Latin, ') as administrative sub-divisions was affirmed in counties and extended to other areas. The second step of modernization was realized in another act of parliament in 1876. This Municipal Territories Act reduced the number of municipalities significantly and made counties the only territorial units by abolishing privileged districts, seats and other forms. 73 counties were organized in place of the 65 counties and 21 other units. However, historical identities were highly considered; in Hungary proper only minor corrections were made. Bigger changes came to Transylvania where the Sz√©kely Land and the Saxons' Land were completely \\"countified\\". At the same time the total number of municipal towns was reduced from 89 to 30. After 1876 only minor changes were made to the system until 1918. The number of ' districts steadily increased over the next decades, growing from around 400 up to some 450 by 1918. The powers and responsibilities of the counties were constantly decreased and were transferred to ministries in different fields of special administration, like responsibilities in terms of construction, veterinary medicine and (overall) financial management. The ministries controlled these through their own regional and local agencies. =Functioning= The main county body was the municipal committee, comprising 50% (persons paying the highest direct taxes), and 50% elected persons fulfilling the prescribed census and ex officio members (deputy county head, main notary and others). The county was led by the main county head, who was a government official subordinated to the Ministry of the Interior of the Kingdom of Hungary. The deputy county head was also an important function.

This was followed by Brother Termite, Conscience of the Beagle, The Happy Policeman, Cradle of Splendor, and God's Fires, each of which combined science fiction plots with other genres in unconventional ways. Several of her short-fiction works were republished in the 1998 collection Eating Memories.

James Cameron acquired the movie rights to Brother Termite and John Sayles wrote a script, but the movie has not been produced. Following her initial success, Anthony taught creative writing at Southern Methodist University for three years, and as her career progressed she moved farther away from the traditional boundaries of the science fiction genre. Her 1998 novel Flanders‚Äîthe highly metaphysical story of an American sharpshooter in the British Army during World War I -- represented a clean break with her science fiction past and her final outing with Ace Books. It was a critical, if not commercial, success. After the publication of Flanders, Anthony ceased writing science fiction to work as a screenwriter, though none of her scripts have been green-lighted.

It was launched in 2000 by the Australian Rugby Union (ARU). The competition was intended to unearth new talent outside of the existing rugby strongholds of Sydney and Brisbane. The competition was suspended after the 2008 season, and has thus far not been revived. The tournament was an important step in the development of rugby union in Australia, and provided an opportunity for the ARU to identify and unearth talented players nationally. It provided regional teams and developing unions with a regular schedule to compete against each other at a higher level than would normally be possible within their individual states or territories. Conducted under rules and regulations similar to the Super Rugby, the competition aimed to assist players, coaches, managers and referees in their professional development. It provided a pathway to full representative level including education in coaching, selecting and refereeing.  History  The Australian Rugby Shield was first contested in 2000, with six teams playing a single round robin over five weekends and the top two teams playing in the final. The teams in the inaugural season were the Adelaide Black Falcons, Darwin Mosquitoes, Melbourne Axemen, New South Wales Country Cockatoos, Perth Gold, and Queensland Country Heelers. The New South Wales and Queensland Country teams met in the final, played as the curtain-raiser to the Bledisloe Cup match held at Stadium Australia in front of a record rugby crowd of 109,874. Queensland Country won in an upset, 23-17. New South Wales Country went on to win the next two titles, before Perth claimed their first Australian Rugby Shield in 2003. A first-past-the-post system was put in place in 2004, eliminating the requirement for a final. In 2006, two additional teams were added, the Tasmania Jack Jumpers and the ACT & Southern NSW Vikings team that won the Australian Rugby Shield on their first attempt. The competition was split into two pools in a three-week round robin competition with the winners and runners up in each pool progressing to the Semi Finals (27 May 2006) and cross-pool Final (3 June 2006). Contracted Super Rugby and academy players were excluded. In 2007, the tournament reverted to a 6-team home-and-away round-robin tournament, without Perth and the Vikings. These two teams were excluded as the ARU determined that the local competitions were sufficient to foster talent for the new Australian Rugby Championship teams, the Perth Spirit and Canberra Vikings, respectively. At the end of 2008, and citing the difficult economic environment, the ARU declared that the 2009 Australian Rugby Shield would be suspended. The involvement of the Australia A team in the Pacific Nations Cup was also cancelled.Australia A dumped from Pacific Nations Cup = 2006 Competition semifinals and final = In the two semifinals (one between The ACT and Southern NSW Vikings and Perth Gold at Viking Park, Wanniassa the other between The NSW Country Cockatoos and The Melbourne Axemen at Harlequin Rugby Park, Ashwood) the games were both very close. Perth led the ACT & Southern NSW team 17-7 at half time before a Viking comeback saw them level the game 20-20 at full-time. During the twenty minutes of extra- time the Vikings side scored through centre Tim Cornforth and won the match 27-20. In the other match NSW Country led 16-6 at the break before Melbourne came back to be ahead 19‚Äì16 with four minutes remaining. The Cockatoos had a chance to level the game through a penalty, and thus take it into extra-time, but kicker Josh Clift missed and the Axemen made their first ever final. In the grand final, the ACT & Southern NSW Vikings thrashed the Melbourne Axemen 36-10 in the final at Viking Park, Wanniassa. The Vikings never looked back after opening the scoring through inside centre Josh Staniforth at the three- minute mark and led 28-7 at half time. The second half saw The Vikings score their 5th try and a penalty to win the game 36-10.  Television coverage  The competition was broadcast on national television by the digital channel ABC2.

As of June 2012, it had 2,693 members.\\"The Well, a Pioneering Online Community, Is for Sale Again\\". The New York Times, June 29, 2012 It is best known for its Internet forums, but also provides email, shell accounts, and web pages. The discussion and topics on The WELL range from deeply serious to trivial, depending on the nature and interests of the participants. History The WELL was started by Stewart Brand and Larry Brilliant in 1985, and the name (an acronym for Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link)Learn About The WELL well.com is partially a reference to some of Brand's earlier projects, including the Whole Earth Catalog. Initially The WELL was owned 50% by The Point Foundation (publishers of the Whole Earth Catalog and Whole Earth Review) and 50% by NETI Technologies Inc. a Vancouver-based company of which Larry Brilliant was at that time the chairman. The WELL began as a dial-up bulletin board system (BBS) influenced by EIES, became one of the original dial-up ISPs in the early 1990s when commercial traffic was first allowed, and changed into its current form as the Internet and web technology evolved. Its original management team‚ÄîMatthew McClure, soon joined by Cliff Figallo and John Coate‚Äîcollaborated with its early users to foster a sense of virtual community. Gail Ann Williams was hired by Figallo in 1991, as community manager, and has continued in management roles into the current era. From 1994 to 1999 The WELL was owned by Bruce R. Katz, founder of Rockport, a manufacturer of walking shoes. In April 1999 it was acquired by Salon, several of whose founders such as Scott Rosenberg had previously been regular participants there. In August 2005 Salon announced that it was looking for a buyer for The WELL, in order to concentrate on other business lines. In November 2006, a press release of The WELL said, \\"As Salon has not found a suitable purchaser, it has determined that it is currently in the best interest of the company to retain this business and has therefore suspended all efforts to sell The WELL.\\" In June 2012 Salon once again announced that it was looking for a buyer for The WELL as its subscriber base \\"did not bear financial promise\\". Additionally, it announced that it had entered into discussions with various parties interested in buying the well.com domain name, and that the remaining WELL staff had been laid off at the end of May. The community pledged money to take over The WELL itself and rehire important staff. In September 2012, Salon sold The WELL to a new corporation, The WELL Group Inc., owned by a group of eleven investors, who are all long-time members. The CEO was Earl Crabb, who died on February 20, 2015. The sale price was reported to be $400,000. Members have no official role in the management, but \\"can ... go back to what they do best: conversation. And complaining about the management.\\"Salon Media Group Sells The WELL to The Well Group Notable items in WELL history include being the forum through which John Perry Barlow, John Gilmore, and Mitch Kapor, the founders of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, first met. Howard Rheingold, an early and very active member, was inspired to write his book The Virtual Community by his experience on The WELL. According to Rheingold's book, The WELL's Usenet feed was for years provided by Apple Computer over UUCP. The WELL was a major online meeting place for fans of the Grateful Dead, especially those who followed the band from concert to concert, in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The WELL also played a role in the book Takedown about the pursuit and capture of Kevin Mitnick. Founded in Sausalito, California, the service is now based in Emeryville. Topics of discussion The WELL is organized into subject areas known as \\"conferences\\". These conferences reflect member interests, and include arts, health, business, regions, hobbies, spirituality, music, politics, games, software and many more. Within conferences, members open separate conversational threads called \\"topics\\" for specific items of interest. For example, the Media conference has (or had) topics devoted to The New York Times, media ethics, and the Luann comic strip. An example of a local conference is the one on San Francisco, which has topics on restaurants, the city government, and neighborhood news. \\"Public\\" conferences are open to all members, while \\"private\\" conferences are restricted to a list of users controlled by the conference hosts, called the \\"ulist\\". Some \\"featured private\\" or \\"private independent\\" conferences (such as \\"Women on the WELL\\" and \\"Recovery\\") are listed in the WELL's directory, but are access-restricted for privacy or membership-restriction reasons. Members may request admission to such conferences. There are also a large number of unlisted \\"secret private\\" conferences. The names of these conferences are public, but the contents, hosts, and members are restricted to members of a particular conference. Membership in private conferences is by invitation. WELL members may open their own new public or private independent conferences. Policy and governance The directors of The WELL have included Matthew McClure and Cliff Figallo, both veterans of the 1970s commune called The Farm, and Gail Williams, previously known as one of the principals in the political satire group the Plutonium Players. In 2016, The WELL hired Christian Ruzich and Daryl Lynn Johnson, who have over 30 years of combined experience on The WELL, to be the General Managers. The couple, who met on The WELL, will draw on their years of marketing and online community experience to help The WELL become the prime destination for premium online conversation and discussion. The community forums, known as \\"conferences\\", are supervised by \\"conference hosts\\" who guide conversations and may enforce conference rules on civility and/or appropriateness. Initially all hosts were selected by staff members. In 1995, Gail Williams changed the policies to enable user-created forums. Participants can create their own \\"independent\\" personal conferences‚Äîeither viewable by any WELL member or privately viewable by those members on a restricted membership list‚Äîon any subject they please with any rules they like. Overall support and supervision of the conferencing services is handled by several staff members, often referred to collectively as \\"confteam\\", the name of the UNIX user account used by staff for conference maintenance. They have more system operational powers than conference hosts, along with the additional social authority of selecting \\"featured conference\\" hosts and closing accounts for abuse. WELL members use a consistent login name when posting messages, and a non-fixed pseudonym field alongside it. The \\"pseud\\" (in WELL parlance) defaults to the user's real name, but can be changed at will and so often reflects a quotation from another user, or is an in-joke, or may be left blank. The user's real name can be easily looked up using their login name. WELL members are not anonymous. There is a time-honored double meaning to the WELL slogan coined by Stewart Brand, \\"You Own Your Own Words\\" or (\\"YOYOW\\"): members have both the rights to their posted words and responsibility for those words, too. (Members can also delete their posts at any time, but a placeholder indicates the former location and author of a deleted or \\"scribbled\\" post, as well as who deleted it.) Journalists The WELL was frequently mentioned in the media in the 1980s and 1990s, probably disproportionately to the number of users it had relative to other online systems. This has diminished but not disappeared in recent years, with other online communities becoming commonplace. This early visibility was largely the result of the early policy of providing free accounts for interested journalists and other select members of the media. As a result, for many journalists it was their first experience of online systems and, later, the Internet, even though other systems existed. Although accounts are now seldom provided for free to journalists, there are still a sizable number on The WELL; for example columnist Jon Carroll of the San Francisco Chronicle, Wendy M. Grossman of The Inquirer, and critic Andy Klein of Los Angeles CityBeat. The WELL also received numerous awards in the 1980s and 1990s, including a Webby Award for online community in 1998, and an EFF Pioneer Award in 1994. In the news In March 2007, The WELL was noted for refusing membership to Kevin Mitnick, and refunding his membership fee.Kevin Mitnick is Unforgiven Wired, March 21, 2007 Virtual community and social network difference There is often confusion between a virtual community and social network. They are similar in some aspects because they both can be used for personal and professional interests. A social network offers an opportunity to connect with people one already knows or is acquainted with. Facebook and Twitter are social networks. Platforms such as LinkedIn and Yammer open up communication channels among coworkers and peers with similar professions in a more relaxed setting. Often social media guidelines are in place for professional usage so that everyone understands what is suitable online behavior.Mahlberg, T. (2017). Alter-Identity Work via Social Media in Professional Service Contexts. In Proceedings of the 28th Australasian Conference on Information Systems (ACIS 2017). Chicago Using a social network is an extension of an offline social community. It is helpful in keeping connections among friends and associates as locations change. move. Each user has their own spider web structure which is their social network.Clauset, A. (2005). Finding local community structure in networks. Physical review E, 72(2), 026132. Virtual communities differ in that users aren't connected through a mutual friend or similar backgrounds. These groups are formed by people who may be complete strangers but have a common interest or ideology.Wellman, B., & Gulia, M. (1999). Virtual communities as communities. Communities in cyberspace, 167-194. Virtual communities connect people who normally wouldn't consider themselves to be in the same group. These groups continue to stay relevant and maintained in the online world because users feel a need to contribute to the community and in return feel empowered when receiving new information from other members. Virtual communities have an elaborate nest structure because they overlap. Yelp, YouTube, and Wikipedia are all examples of a virtual community. Companies like Kaiser Permanente launched virtual communities for members. The community gave members the ability to control their health care decisions and improve their overall experience. Members of a virtual community are able to offer opinions and contribute helpful advice. Again, the difference between virtual communities and social network is the emergence of the relationship. The WELL distinguished itself from the technology of the time by creating a networked community for everyone. Users were responsible and owned the content posted, a rule created to protect the information from being copyrighted and commoditized. Women particularly were able to find community and voice on the WELL. While largely bound to household work at the time, women of the WELL could be participants and contributors on message boards by sharing experiences and information.

He contributed to general systems theory, to mathematical biology and to the mathematical modeling of social interaction and stochastic models of contagion. Biography Rapoport was born in Lozova, Kharkov Governorate, Russia (in today's Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine) into a secular Jewish family. In 1922, he came to the United States, and in 1928 he became a naturalized citizen. He started studying music in Chicago and continued with piano, conducting and composition at the Vienna Hochschule f√ºr Musik where he studied from 1929 to 1934. However, due to the rise of Nazism, he found it impossible to make a career as a pianist.Alisa Ferguson, \\"Rapoport was Renowned Mathematical Psychologist, Peace Activist, University of Toronto Bulletin, February 20, 2007 He shifted his career into mathematics, getting a Ph.D. degree in mathematics under Otto Schilling and Abraham Adrian Albert at the University of Chicago in 1941 on the thesis Construction of Non-Abelian Fields with Prescribed Arithmetic. According to The Globe and Mail, he was a member of the American Communist Party for three years, but quit before enlisting in the U.S. Army Air Corps in 1941, serving in Alaska and India during World War II.Ron Csillag, \\"Anatol Rapoport, Academic 1911‚Äì2007.\\" The Globe and Mail (Toronto), January 31, 2007, p. S7 After the war, he joined the Committee on Mathematical Biology at the University of Chicago (1947‚Äì54), publishing his first book, Science and the Goals of Man, co-authored with semanticist S. I. Hayakawa in 1950. He also received a one-year fellowship at the prestigious Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in Stanford, California. From 1955 to 1970, Rapoport was Professor of Mathematical Biology and Senior Research Mathematician at the University of Michigan, as well as founding member, in 1955, of the Mental Health Research Institute (MHRI) at the University of Michigan. In 1970 Rapoport moved to Toronto to avoid the war-making ways of the Vietnam-era United States. He was appointed professor of mathematics and psychology at the University of Toronto (1970‚Äì79). The university appointed him professor emeritus in 1980. He lived in bucolic Wychwood Park overlooking downtown Toronto, a neighbour of Marshall McLuhan. On his retirement from the University of Toronto, he became director of the Institute of Advanced Studies (Vienna) until 1983. University of Toronto appointed him professor of peace studies in 1984, a position he held until 1996, but continued to teach until 2000. In 1984 he co-founded Science for Peace, was elected president and remained on its executive until 1998. In 1954 Anatol Rapoport co-founded the Society for General Systems Research, along with the researchers Ludwig von Bertalanffy, Ralph Gerard, and Kenneth Boulding. He became president of the Society for General Systems Research in 1965. Anatol Rapoport died of pneumonia in Toronto. He is survived by his wife Gwen, daughter Anya, and sons Alexander and Anthony. Work Rapoport contributed to general systems theory, to mathematical biology, and to the mathematical modeling of social interaction and stochastic models of contagion. He combined his mathematical expertise with psychological insights into the study of game theory, social networks, and semantics. Rapoport extended these understandings into studies of psychological conflict, dealing with nuclear disarmament and international politics. His autobiography, Certainties and Doubts: A Philosophy of Life, was published in 2001. An article celebrating his legacy and thinking includes a career overview alongside testimonials by scholars and family that provide a glimpse of Anatol Rapoport, the scientist and the person.Kopelman, S. (2020). Tit for Tat and beyond: The legendary work of Anatol Rapoport. Negotiation and Conflict Management Research (NCMR), 13(1), 60‚Äì84. https://doi.org/10.1111/ncmr.12172 =Game theory= Rapoport had a versatile mind, working in mathematics, psychology, biology, game theory, social network analysis, and peace and conflict studies. For example, he pioneered in the modeling of parasitism and symbiosis, researching cybernetic theory. This went on to give a conceptual basis for his lifelong work in conflict and cooperation. Among many other well-known books on fights, games, violence, and peace, Rapoport was the author of over 300 articles and of \\"Two-Person Game Theory\\" (1966) and \\"N-Person Game Theory\\" (1970). He analyzed contests in which there are more than two sets of conflicting interests, such as war, diplomacy, poker, or bargaining. His work led him to peace research, including books on The Origins of Violence (1989) and Peace, An Idea Whose Time Has Come (1993). In the 1980s, he won a computer tournament which was based on Robert Axelrod's The Evolution of Cooperation and was designed to further understanding of the ways in which cooperation could emerge through evolution. The contenders had to present programs that could play iterated games of the prisoner's dilemma and these were pitted against each other. Rapoport's entry, Tit-For-Tat has only four lines of code. The program opens by cooperating with its opponent. It then plays exactly as the other side played in the previous game. If the other side defected in the previous game, the program also defects; but only for one game. If the other side cooperates, the program continues to cooperate. According to Peace Magazine author/editor Metta Spencer, the program \\"punished the other player for selfish behaviour and rewarded her for cooperative behaviour‚Äîbut the punishment lasted only as long as the selfish behaviour lasted. This proved to be an exceptionally effective sanction, quickly showing the other side the advantages of cooperating. It also set moral philosophers to proposing this as a workable principle to use in real life interactions\\". His children report that he was a strong chess player but a bad poker player because he non-verbally revealed the strength of his hands. =Social network analysis= Rapoport was an early developer of social network analysis. His original work showed that one can measure large networks by profiling traces of flows through them. This enables learning about the speed of the distribution of resources, including information, and what speeds or impedes these flows‚Äîsuch as race, gender, socioeconomic status, proximity, and kinship.Harrison White, Identity and Control, 2nd ed., Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2007 This work linked social networks to the diffusion of innovation, and by extension, to epidemiology. Rapoport's empirical work traced the spread of information within a school. It prefigured the study of degrees of separation by showing the rapid spread of information in a population to almost all‚Äîbut not all‚Äîschool members (see references below). His work on random nets predates the random graphs as defined by the Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi model and independently by Edgar Gilbert. Rapoport is also the originator of the theory behind the interpretation of bias in social networks, which pertains to the extent to which a network deviates from a random base model. He introduced what is now known as \\"preferential attachment mechanism\\" in biased networks. It is a stochastic process that involves connected nodes that snowball into more connections. Rapoport also published an article that outlined a probabilistic approach to animal sociology, which is one of the earliest efforts at modeling simple social structures. =Conflict and peace studies= According to Thomas Homer-Dixon in the Toronto Globe and Mail, Rapoport \\"became anti-militarist quite soon after World War II. The idea of military values became anathema\\". He was a leading organizer of the first teach-ins against the Vietnam War at the University of Michigan, a model that spread rapidly throughout North America. He told at a teach-in: \\"By undertaking the war against Vietnam, the United States has undertaken a war against humanity...This war we shall not win\\". (Ann Arbor News, April 1967). He said he was an abolitionist, rather than a total pacifist: \\"I'm for killing the institution of war\\". In 1968, he signed the \\"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\\" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.\\"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\\" January 30, 1968, New York Post. Rapoport returned to the University of Toronto to become the founding (and unpaid) Professor of Peace and Conflict Studies programme, working with George Ignatieff and Canada's Science for Peace organization. As its sole professor at the start, he used a rigorous, interdisciplinary approach to the study of peace, integrating mathematics, politics, psychology, philosophy, science, and sociology. His main concern was to legitimize peace studies as a worthy academic pursuit. The Trudeau Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies continued to flourish at the University of Toronto under the leadership of Thomas Homer- Dixon, and, from 2008, under Ron Levi. When Rapoport began, there was one (unpaid) professor and twelve students. Now, there are three (paid) professors and ninety students.Alisa Ferguson, \\"Rapoport was Renowned Mathematical Psychologist, Peace Activist,\\" University of Toronto Bulletin, February 20, 2007 Rapoport's students report that he was an engaged and inspiring professor who captured their attention, imagination and interest with his wide-ranging knowledge, passion for the subject, good humor, kind and generous spirit, attentiveness to student concerns, and animated teaching style.Chesmak Farhoumand-Sims, \\"Memories of Anatol Rapoport,\\" Peace Magazine, April 2007, p. 14 In 1981 Rapoport co-founded the international non-governmental organization Science for Peace. He was recognized in the 1980s for his contribution to world peace through nuclear conflict restraint via his game theoretic models of psychological conflict resolution. He won the Lenz International Peace Research Prize in 1976. Professor Rapoport was also a member of the editorial board of the Journal of Environmental Peace published by the International Innovation Projects at the University of Toronto.

It has an interchange with the national rail network at Bodmin Parkway railway station, the southern terminus of the line. History The Great Western Railway opened its branch line from Bodmin Road to 27 May 1887, and on 3 September 1888 a junction line was opened to connect with the Bodmin and Wadebridge Railway which had opened its line from to in 1834. The line closed on 3 October 1983 following the demise of freight traffic from Wenford. In 1984 the Bodmin Railway Preservation Society was formed, and they held their first open day at Bodmin General two years later. 1987 saw the Cornish Steam Locomotive Society move their equipment from Bugle to Bodmin. A Light Railway Order was granted in 1989, and the following year passenger services recommenced between Bodmin General and Bodmin Road, although by now that station had been renamed \\"Bodmin Parkway\\". A new intermediate station known as was brought into use. In 1996 the former junction line was also reopened, with another new station provided as . Route The stations served are all in or near Bodmin. They are: * () * () * () * () The route from Bodmin General to Bodmin Parkway is and Bodmin General to Boscarne Junction is . On leaving Bodmin Parkway, the route first crosses the River Fowey by a five-arch viaduct, and then climbs up towards Bodmin Moor. The one intermediate halt is at Colesloggett Halt, built by the BWR in 1993 to serve a farm park (now closed), and provides access to a network of footpaths through the Cardinham Woods, belonging to the Forestry Commission. The trip takes 25 minutes each way. Upon reaching Bodmin General station, the headquarters of the railway, trains reverse to take the line to Boscarne Junction. This lies on the former London and South Western Railway route to and Padstow, which now forms the Camel Trail alongside the River Camel. The railway aspires to extend alongside this foot/cyclepath towards Wadebridge in the future.  Signalling  The railway is controlled by lower quadrant semaphore signals. Access to the Network Rail mainline at Bodmin is controlled by a lever frame, under the supervision of NR's Lostwithiel signal box.

RailTrail Project  The railway company is currently planning to extend beyond its western terminus at Boscarne Junction towards Wadebridge alongside the Camel Trail. Known as the RailTrail project, phase one would see the railway extended to Nanstallon Halt, phase two to Grogley Halt and phase three to Wadebridge Guineaport. A separate company (Bodmin & Wadebridge Railway Company) has been set up. It is responsible to the Directors of the Bodmin & Wenford Railway for the promotion and management of all aspects relating to the RailTrail project. In areas where the width of the trackbed does not allow both a railway and a footpath side-by-side, short diversions are proposed. For example, at Grogley, the Camel Trail could be re-routed along a former \\"headshunt\\", which was part of the original railway before it was replaced by a later deviation. The RailTrail project is viewed by some as somewhat controversial due to the following concerns. * Sustrans and the cycling/running/walking/equestrian communities have objected to these plans for the RailTrail project, claiming they do not provide significant evidence that a wide-enough multi-purpose trail can be provided. They consider the Camel Trail is currently too narrow at the Boscarne junction terminus due to the railway. * Some environmentalists have expressed concerns about the impact that the RailTrail project would have on the SSSI and SAC of the Camel valley. * People living in the Guineaport area of Wadebridge have expressed concerns about having a rail terminus situated there, in the belief that space for a platform and car parking is inadequate. The decision of North Cornwall District Council to support the project was \\"a close fought battle\\", won only by the casting vote of Councillor Graham Facks-Martin.

The Madagascar tree The earliest well-known report of a man-eating tree originated as a literary fabrication written by Edmund Spencer for the New York World. Spencer's article first appeared in the daily edition of the New York World on 26 April 1874, and appeared again in the weekly edition of the newspaper two days later. In the article, a letter was published by a purported German explorer named \\"Karl Leche\\" (also spelled as Karl or Carl Liche in later accounts), who provided a report of encountering a sacrifice performed by the \\"Mkodo tribe\\" of Madagascar: This story was picked up by many other newspapers of the day, which included the South Australian Register of 27 October 1874, where it gained even greater notoriety. Describing the tree, the account related: > The slender delicate palpi, with the fury of starved serpents, quivered a > moment over her head, then as if instinct with demoniac intelligence > fastened upon her in sudden coils round and round her neck and arms; then > while her awful screams and yet more awful laughter rose wildly to be > instantly strangled down again into a gurgling moan, the tendrils one after > another, like great green serpents, with brutal energy and infernal > rapidity, rose, retracted themselves, and wrapped her about in fold after > fold, ever tightening with cruel swiftness and savage tenacity of anacondas > fastening upon their prey. The hoax was given further publicity by Madagascar: Land of the Man-eating Tree, a book by Chase Osborn, who had been a Governor of Michigan. Osborn claimed that both the tribes and missionaries on Madagascar knew about the hideous tree, repeated the above Liche account, and acknowledged \\"I do not know whether this tigerish tree really exists or whether the bloodcurdling stories about it are pure myth. It is enough for my purpose if its story focuses your interest upon one of the least known spots of the world.\\" In his 1955 book, Salamanders and other Wonders, science author Willy Ley determined that the Mkodo tribe, Carl Liche, and the Madagascar man-eating tree all appeared to be fabrications: \\"The facts are pretty clear by now. Of course the man eating tree does not exist. There is no such tribe.\\" Yateveo In J. W. Buel's Sea and Land (1887), the Yateveo plant is described as being native to Africa and Central America, so named for producing a hissing sound similar to the Spanish phrase \\"ya-te-veo\\" (lit. \\"I-see-you\\"), and having poisonous \\"spines\\" that resemble \\"many huge serpents in an angry discussion, occasionally darting from side to side as if striking at an imaginary foe\\" which seize and pierce any creature coming within reach. The vampire vine William Thomas Stead, editor of Review of Reviews, published a brief article in October 1891 that discussed a story found in Lucifer magazine, describing a plant in Nicaragua called by the natives the devil's snare. This plant had the capability \\"to drain the blood of any living thing which comes within its death-dealing touch.\\" According to the article: > Mr. Dunstan, naturalist, who has recently returned from Central America, > where he spent nearly two years in the study of the flora and the fauna of > the country, relates the finding of a singular growth in one of the swamps > which surround the great lakes of Nicaragua. He was engaged in hunting for > botanical and entomological specimens, when he heard his dog cry out, as if > in agony, from a distance. Running to the spot whence the animal's cries > came. Mr. Dunstan found him enveloped in a perfect network of what seemed to > be a fine rope-like tissue of roots and fibers... The native servants who > accompanied Mr. Dunstan manifested the greatest horror of the vine, which > they call \\"the devil's snare\\", and were full of stories of its death-dealing > powers. He was able to discover very little about the nature of the plant, > owing to the difficulty of handling it, for its grasp can only be torn away > with the loss of skin and even of flesh; but, as near as Mr. Dunstan could > ascertain, its power of suction is contained in a number of infinitesimal > mouths or little suckers, which, ordinarily closed, open for the reception > of food. If the substance is animal, the blood is drawn off and the carcass > or refuse then dropped. An investigation of Stead's review determined no such article was published in the October issue of Lucifer, and concluded that the story in Review of Reviews appeared to be a fabrication by the editor. The story in fact appeared in the September issue, proceeded by a longer version in an 1889 newspaper describing Dunstan as a \\"well-known naturalist\\" from New Orleans.

Also, after 1606 there were the following captaincies-general: *Captaincy of Upper Hungary (eastern Slovakia and adjacent northeastern present-day Hungary, part of present-day northern Romania and part of Carpathian Ruthenia, created 1563) *Captaincy of Lower Hungary (western and central Slovakia, created 1563) *Captaincy of Gy≈ër (territories between Lake Balaton and river Danube) *Captaincy of Kanizsa (western Hungary) *Captaincy of Croatia (western Croatia) *Captaincy of Slavonia (northern Croatia) = Counties (17th ‚Äì 18th century) = Note that many of the counties ceased to exist during the Turkish occupation (app. 1541 ‚Äì 1699/1718). For administrative divisions on the Turkish territory see Ottoman Empire. After the defeat of the Turks (around 1700) there were some 70 counties in the whole Kingdom of Hungary again. After the final defeat of the Turks in 1718, the three southern counties Temesiensis, Torontaliensis and Krassovinsis created the special administrative district Banatus Temesiensis (Hungarian: Temesi B√°ns√°g). This district was dissolved again in 1779, but its southernmost part remained part of the Military Frontier (Confiniaria militaria) till the late 19th century. The following list does not show Transylvania. The \\"districtus\\" is only a traditional formal division. Note that some of the previous counties, e. g. the Zarandiensis, were part of Transylvania at this time.

The remaining territory of the Kingdom of Hungary (which did not include Transylvania at that time) was divided into 5 Districts: *Pre√üburg *Kaschau *√ñdenburg *Pest-Ofen *Gro√üwardein These Districts were divided into counties, whose traditional territories however were modified in 1850 and 1853. = 1860‚Äì1867 = In October 1860, the Districts were abolished and the pre-1848 counties were restored.  1867 ‚Äì 1920  Since 1867 the administrative and political divisions of the lands belonging to the Hungarian crown (Kingdom of Hungary) have been in great measure remodelled. In 1868 Transylvania was definitely reunited to Hungary proper, and the town and district of Fiume (Rijeka) declared autonomous. In 1873 part of the Military Frontier was united with Hungary proper and part with Croatia-Slavonia. Hungary proper, according to ancient usage, was generally divided into four great divisions or circles, and Transylvania up to 1876 was regarded as the fifth. In 1876 a general system of counties was introduced. According to this division Hungary proper was divided into seven statistical regions having no administrative functions, of which Transylvania formed one.

The character is best known as a member of the mutant team X-Force. Created by writer Fabian Nicieza and artist/co-writer Rob Liefeld, Domino made her first full cover story appearance in X-Force #8 (March 1992) as an original member of the Wild Pack team led by the mutant Cable. In addition to her exceptional marksmanship and hand-to-hand skills, Domino possesses mutant probability-altering powers, similar to those of the mutant Longshot. She often uses her skills as a mercenary, but has also been the partner, confidante, and love interest of the superhero Cable, a lieutenant in his militant group X-Force, and a member of the X-Men. Domino is played by Zazie Beetz in the film Deadpool 2. She also appears in certain video games, such as Marvel Strike Force, Marvel Future Fight, and more. Publication history Apart from being a mainstay character in the first series of X-Force, Domino has had two limited self-titled series, one of which had her teaming with Puck against Lady Deathstrike and Donald Pierce. The second revealed her childhood. The first female Domino to appear in Marvel comics was not the genuine Neena Thurman. A Domino imposter, a mutant shapeshifter named Copycat, first appeared in The New Mutants #98 (February 1991), and continued to assume Neena's role in X-Force for a time. The real Domino was first published in the main flashback story recalled by Cable in X-Force, vol. 1 #8 (March 1992). Her current narrative, brief cameo, second appearance was published on the last page of X-Force #11 (June 1992). Domino received two self-titled limited series.

Domino appeared in her own three-issue miniseries with Wolverine entitled X-Force: Sex and Violence, written by Christopher Yost and Craig Kyle and drawn by Gabriele Dell'Otto. The story centers upon Domino and Wolverine's mission to resolve a situation from Domino's recent past. Chris Yost has said, \\"It's a chance for us to go in-depth into a couple of the characters. In the story, Domino has a hit put out on her and Wolverine finds out about it. Essentially, it's the two of them going out to get that hit removed.\\" Yost adds that the characters are up against the worst killers on the planet. Domino was part of the main roster in Cable and X-Force (by Dennis Hopeless and Salvador Larroca), from 2012 to 2014. She guest stars in the 2014 X-Force, beginning in issue #7.

Powers and abilities Domino is a mutant with the ability to subconsciously and psionically initiate random telekinetic acts that affect probability in her favor by making improbable (but not impossible) things occur within her line of sight, thus causing her to have \\"good luck\\" and her opponents to have \\"bad luck\\". This \\"probability field\\" phenomenon can be anything from an enemy's equipment failure to hitting just the right switch with a stray shot to shut down an overloading nuclear reactor. The full extent of her powers is still unknown. This subconsciously controlled talent is triggered when she is in a stressful situation (such as fighting or escaping). This effect constantly emanates from her body at all times and is completely subconscious. However, it is also largely participatory‚Äîin order for the luck to take effect, Domino herself must engage in an action whose chance she can affect. As a byproduct of her abilities, Domino's cerebral cortex emits a current of bioelectric pulses down her spine to instinctively guide her movements during such situations, which has the added effect of augmenting her natural reflexes and reactions to superhuman levels. During the 198 rebellion at the Xavier Institute, Domino was able to consciously utilize her abilities in order to affect the probability fields of storm clouds above a group of ONE Sentinels, calling down lightning to strike them. Domino is also a superb marksman with various firearms, highly skilled athlete, excellent swimmer, and adept in the use of explosives. She has extensive training in various armed combat techniques and the martial arts, with Olympic-gold level athletic and acrobatic ability. She also seems to be fluent in multiple languages. Domino wears body armor of unknown composition and carries conventional firearms. She has also used a staff that fires unspecified ammunition, which can be used for balance when jumping and is equipped with sensors. During her time as an X-Corporation operative, Domino wore contact lenses designed by Forge, capable of night vision or, with a triple blink, firing a high-intensity laser beam.

She was the first ship named in honor of Winfield Scott Schley. Construction and commissioning Schley was laid down on 29 October 1917 by Union Iron Works, San Francisco, California. The ship was launched on 28 March 1918, sponsored by Miss Eleanor Martin. The destroyer was commissioned on 20 September 1918, Commander Robert C. Giffen in command. Service history =World War I= USS Buffalo, and USS Jupiter (background) in Gibraltar, December 1918 Schley sailed from San Diego on 10 October 1918 for the east coast and, on 12 November, departed New York for the Mediterranean Sea. On 24 January 1919 at Taranto, Italy, she embarked Rear Admiral Mark L. Bristol, Senior American Naval Officer in Turkey, and transported him to Constantinople. Schley next assumed duty in the Adriatic Sea, acting as station ship at Pola, Italy, from 17 February to 15 April, and then visiting Italian and Yugoslav ports on the Adriatic until heading for the United States on 2 July. Schley returned to San Diego on 8 September 1919 and, except for trips to San Francisco for repairs, remained there until she was placed out of commission, in reserve, on 1 June 1922. =World War II= With Europe again at war and war threatening in the Pacific Ocean, Schley was recommissioned at San Diego on 3 October 1940. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 17 December for patrols and exercises there the next year. When Japanese planes attacked Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, the destroyer was moored in a nest of ships undergoing overhaul and, as her guns were dismantled, was able to do little besides reply with small arms fire. Her overhaul was rushed to completion; and, on 20 December, she took up a patrol station off the channel approaching Pearl Harbor. She operated there and off Honolulu for almost a year. On 13 December 1942, she departed Hawaiian waters for conversion into a fast transport at the Puget Sound Navy Yard. Schley was reclassified APD-14 effective 6 February 1943. Schley returned to Pearl Harbor on 22 February and proceeded to the New Hebrides, arriving at Espiritu Santo on 27 March. In the South Pacific, she trained intensively with Marine raiders and other troops, acted as a patrol and escort vessel, and operated as a transport between the Solomons, the New Hebrides, American Samoa, and New Zealand. Schley first participated in a landing under combat conditions on 30 June at New Georgia. With two other APDs and some smaller ships, she put troops ashore at Wickham Anchorage at the southwest end of Vangunu. On 5 July, she landed a second group of troops at Rice Anchorage, New Georgia. During this operation, a Japanese reinforcement group belatedly arrived on the scene and, in retiring, sank with a long-range torpedo shot. After another trip to Rice Anchorage with supplies and ammunition, Schley sailed from Espiritu Santo on 1 August for overhaul at Mare Island. 1944 USS Schley off Mare Island, October 1943 Schley left the west coast for Pearl Harbor on 7 October, but engine repairs at Pearl Harbor took most of the rest of the year. On 30 December 1943, she arrived at San Diego to join the task force training for the invasion of the Marshall Islands. The force sailed from the west coast on 13 January 1944 and arrived off Kwajalein on 31 January. Schley landed her troops that day and then performed antisubmarine patrol duty until she reembarked her troops on 7 February. She sailed for Eniwetok a week later. Her activities there showed the versatility of the small, fast transports. She arrived on 17 February and, that night, put her troops ashore on Bpgon Island to prevent enemy infiltration from Engebi, which American troops had invaded earlier in the day. The next morning, she began seizing the remaining islands west of the main island of Eniwetok. That day, her troops captured five islands and helped to secure Engebi and Bogon. On 24 February, after transferring her troops to other transports, she got underway for Kwajalein to escort two transports from that atoll to her new area of operations, New Guinea. Schley arrived off New Guinea on 12 March and conducted convoy operations for the next month. On 22 April, she participated in the landings at Aitape, putting troops ashore and providing gunfire support. The next day at Tumleo Island, her boats landed troops from a larger transport while Schley again provided gunfire support. After repairs to a damaged propeller, Schley landed a company of troops on Niroemoar Island to set up a radar unit on 19 May. The next day, she rescued the crew of a wrecked American gasoline barge off Wakde Island and then sank two Japanese barges and silenced an enemy shore battery. The busy ship landed troops on Biak on 27 May and at Cape Sansapor at the western end of New Guinea on 30 July. She then proceeded to Australia for repairs. Schley next participated in two important preliminaries for the reconquest of the Philippines. She landed troops on Morotai on 9 September, and, on 17 October, formed part of the APD group that occupied the small islands at the mouth of Leyte Gulf, clearing the way for the invasion of Leyte three days later. After a month of convoy operations, Schley joined the task group which carried out landings in Ormoc Bay on 7 December. The group came under intense kamikaze attack; although her sister ship, , was sunk, Schley escaped damage. She then participated in the landings at Mindoro on 15 December 1944 and at Lingayen on 9 January 1945; and, during each operation, evaded an attacking kamikaze. At Mindoro, American planes shot down the kamikaze a scant thousand yards from Schley. At Lingayen, the kamikaze veered off at the last minute to attack another ship but missed. Schley remained on patrol off Lingayen until 18 January. 1945‚Äì1946 On 15 February, she landed troops at Mariveles Bay in order to cut off Japanese escape routes during the assault on Manila Bay and, two days later, put troops ashore under enemy fire on Corregidor, climaxing and completing her operations in the Philippines. Schley departed Manila Bay on the 19th and left the Philippines for Ulithi on 25 February. She then escorted convoys in the western Pacific, and was briefly at Okinawa with one from 26 April to 28 April. On 29 May, Schley arrived at San Diego for repairs, and was redesignated DD-103 effective 5 July \\"for duty as rear-area escort and training vessel\\", as she was then too worn out for further front- line service. She was still under overhaul when the war ended, and after being made seaworthy, sailed on 17 September 1945 for inactivation at Philadelphia. Schley was decommissioned on 9 November 1945 and struck from the Navy list on 5 December 1945. Scrapping was completed by the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 29 March 1946. Awards Schley received 11 battle stars for her duty in World War II.

The oldest tunnels are from the Bloomingdale Insane Asylum, the mental asylum that existed before the Morningside Campus was built. These tunnels are small and extremely hot, and they connect to Buell Hall/La Maison Fran√ßaise, the one building remaining from the asylum. The steam tunnel system between Hamilton Hall, Kent Hall, Philosophy Hall, and Fayerweather Hall connects to these old tunnels. Another steam tunnel system connects Mudd Hall, Uris Hall, Dodge Fitness Center, and Havemeyer Hall, and is generally considered the easiest to access. These tunnels contain old rail tracks that were used to transport coal for heating. They also contain the \\"Signature Room,\\" where one can find many quotes and names left by previous tunnelers. As with all tunnels on campus, these contain many more secrets for students to discover. This tunnel system also used to connect to the first floor of Pupin Hall, but that way was blocked in the 1990s. Until mid-2003, the first floor of Pupin was virtually untouched from the last days of the Manhattan Project. Notes and daily logs scattered dusty tables. Half-completed experiments sat in stasis, only visible to the few explorers who got in. Since 2003, the first floor has been cleaned out, and is now mostly empty. This floor used to house one of the first cyclotrons until Spring 2008, when the cyclotron was removed and destroyed in order to make room for the infrastructure leading to the Interdisciplinary Science Building. Another tunnel system connects Havemeyer Hall, Math Hall, Lewisohn Hall, and the Miller Theatre. Tunnels also connect Butler Library, Carman, Lerner, and supposedly Furnald and Hogan Hall. John Jay/Hartley/Wallach Halls can also be reached from this system, but the door is locked, and the tunnels connect to JJ's Place, making exploration difficult. A tunnel between Butler Library and Low Memorial Library is rumored to exist, but no evidence of such a tunnel has ever been found. Any entrance to this tunnel from Butler is well hidden or heavily locked, and the Low entrance would be next-to-impossible to find given that Campus Security is based on the first floor. There are no tunnels across Broadway to the Barnard campus due to the presence of the New York City Subway's IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line () directly under the ground, although Barnard has its own set of tunnels and sub-basements. There are no tunnels across Amsterdam Avenue to East Campus: however, the subterranean garage deep below the School of International & Public Affairs does have tunnels leading to the dormitories and the Law School. History During the 1968 student strike, student staff at WKCR, Columbia's radio station, used the tunnels to tap the university's telephone system. Students also made use of the tunnels to travel between buildings occupied by strikers. The names of students and alumni who have visited the tunnels appear scrawled throughout the tunnels. Ken Hechtman is one of the most infamous former Columbia tunnelers. In 1986, he led an underground group of tunneling students called AD HOC (Allied Destructive Hackers of Columbia). Hechtman was expelled during his first year at Columbia for stealing Uranium-238 from Pupin Hall, along with many dangerous chemicals from Havemeyer Hall. The crawlspace runs beneath La Maison Fran√ßaise, which is the campus' French building. The building is the oldest on campus, serving as the warden's house in the Bloomingdale Insane Asylum during the late 19th century.

In addition to practice and writing, Porphyrios has held a number of teaching positions in the United States, the United Kingdom and Greece. He is currently a visiting professor at the Yale School of Architecture. Porphyrios is an exponent of New Classical Architecture, and many of his buildings have been designed in the Gothic and classical idioms. Ann's Court, Selwyn College, Cambridge Education Porphyrios studied at Princeton University where he earned a Master of Architecture and a Ph.D. in the History and Theory of Architecture. He wrote his Ph. D. thesis on the Finnish architect Alvar Aalto, published later as Sources of Modern Eclecticism (London: Academy Editions, 1983). The work was a structuralist analysis of Aalto's architecture, influenced by the philosophers Michel Foucault and Louis Althusser, in which Porphyrios described the themes he believed had generated Aalto's work (typology, urbanism and nature), while arguing that Aalto's work was the end of the line for modernist architecture. In his writing, Porphyrios advocated a \\"classicism without style\\" (which he called \\"Doricism\\"), similar to the Nordic Classicism that prevailed in early 20th century Scandinavia in the work of architects like Kay Fisker in Denmark, Gunnar Asplund in Sweden, and in the early work of Alvar Aalto in Finland. Porphyrios' Whitman College, Princeton University, Princeton, USA (completed 2007). Career In the 1980s, Porphyrios regularly contributed to the journal Architectural Design, championing classical and vernacular architecture as a rational architecture. In 2002, Princeton University commissioned him to design a residential college (Whitman College) in the Collegiate Gothic style, completed in 2007.

It was written around April 1971, first published in the August 1971 issue of New Humanist, and appeared in the 1974 collection High Windows. It is one of Larkin's best-known poems; the opening lines (\\"They fuck you up, your mum and dad\\") are among his most frequently quoted. Larkin himself compared it with W. B. Yeats's \\"Lake Isle of Innisfree\\" and said he expected to hear it recited in his honour by a thousand Girl Guides before he died. It is frequently parodied. Television viewers in the United Kingdom voted it one of the \\"Nation's Top 100 Poems\\". Synopsis The poem consists of three verses of four iambic tetrameter on an alternating rhyme scheme. The speaker, addressing the reader directly, expresses the idea that parents put a lot of emotional weight on their children with the famous line \\"They fuck you up, your mum and dad\\". The speaker goes on to explain that it is not intentional, but stems from their own emotional baggage (with \\"some extra, just for you\\"). In the second stanza, the speaker describes the way that the reader's parents were also given this emotional trauma by their parents. The third stanza is where the poem makes its assertion: the misery humanity experiences is a cycle that expands continuously. The speaker tells the reader that they should escape this cycle as soon as they possibly can, and to not have any kids, which would perpetuate the cycle. The title of the poem is an allusion to Robert Louis Stevenson's \\"Requiem\\" (\\"This be the verse you grave for me\\"). Stevenson's thought of a happy homecoming in death is given an ironic turn. Enduring appeal A testament to the enduring appeal of Larkin's poem came in April 2009, when the first four lines were recited by a British appeal court judge as part of his judgement of a particularly acrimonious divorce case involving the future custody arrangements of a nine-year-old child. Lord Justice Wall referred to the emotional damage caused to the child, saying: \\"These four lines seem to me to give a clear warning to parents who, post-separation, continue to fight the battles of the past, and show each other no respect.\\" References in popular culture *In a 2002 interview on Parkinson, David Bowie quoted the first and last stanzas when asked about his relationship with his parents. *The final stanza of the poem, in its entirety, becomes the last words of villain Count Olaf in The End, the final book of A Series of Unfortunate Events by Lemony Snicket. *Anne Clark performs a version to music on her 1988 album R.S.V.P., calling it \\"a nursery rhyme for grown-ups\\".

Honda, is a video game character created by Capcom for the Street Fighter series of fighting games. Introduced in Street Fighter II as part of the starting lineup, he has appeared in Street Fighter Alpha 3, Street Fighter IV, and the Capcom vs. SNK series, as well as several cameos. Honda is a professional sumo wrestler and sent≈ç proprietor. He is one of the original eight playable characters in Street Fighter II, representing Japan alongside Ryu. Conception and design Designed by Akira Yasuda, the character was initially named \\"Sumo\\". As his initial name implies, Honda is meant to have above average strength, but below average speed. The developers intended for the character to be popular in Japan, but to also make Japanese fighting styles appeal to foreigners. Honda's shikona for sumo is mentioned as \\"Fujinoyama.\\"ALL ABOUT „Ç´„Éó„Ç≥„É≥ÂØæÊà¶Ê†ºÈóò„Ç≤„Éº„É† 1987-2000 (All About Capcom Head-To-Head Fighting Game 1987-2000), He wears his black hair in a chonmage and dresses in a blue and white striped yukata over a red mawashi, with the upper half of the yukata folded down over the belt to leave his upper body exposed. His face is painted in the kumadori style of makeup used in kabuki. Honda's signature move is the Hyaku Retsu Harite (lit., \\"Hundred Violent Sumo Hands\\"; commonly referred to as the Hundred Hand Slap). =Stage= E. Honda's stage Edo no Yu E. Honda's stage is called in Street Fighter II. It is inside of a fictional (public bath) in Kapukon Yu (Âä†ÂØåÊ†πÊπØ), Higashi Komagata, Tokyo. Kapukon Yu is located in the western part of Tokyo called Yamanote. This is historically an upper-class residential area of the city. Shitamachi is historically Tokyo's working class area. Yamanote and Shitamachi have symbolic meaning. For Honda's personality it means that he's honest, sincere, forthright and a bit conservative. The sumo ring in the bathhouse is made of vinyl so that it's sanitized when it gets wet. A regular sumo ring circle is made of rice-straw bales which deform with water. The illuminating decoration is managed by Honda‚Äôs disciples from a backroom. According to the backstory Honda was raised in a large bathhouse since a young age. Since Honda loves both sumo and hot baths he decided to combine both and made a sumo ring in the public bath. Appearances In his backstory in Street Fighter II, E. Honda is mentioned to have begun his training as a child, singularly focused on becoming the greatest sumo wrestler of all time. He would eventually achieve the highly revered title of \\"≈åzeki\\" (in the English localization of the early Street Fighter II ports, he is stated as having achieved the title, Yokozuna\\"Upon receiving the title of \\"Yokuzuna\\" or grand champion, Honda was shocked to learn that the rest of the world did not consider Sumo wrestling a true sport.\\" Street Fighter II SNES instruction manual, pg. 18). Honda became upset that the rest of the world did not view sumo wrestling with the reverence of the Japanese. He entered into the second World Warrior tournament intent on showing everyone that sumo wrestlers rank among the greatest fighters in the world.Street Fighter II bio Beyond this, he yearns also to improve and prove his own strength, as well as earn the title of Yokuzuna. While involved in the tournament, he takes the opportunity to investigate Shadaloo, in response to sumo wrestlers having taken drugs he traced back to the organization. His face painting and culturally-ambiguous name assisted him in his covert operations. Following the tournament and the fall of Shadaloo, Honda returned to Japan where he continued wrestling professionallyTranslation of caption for Black and White Street Fighter II artwork, original text and image courtesy of [FightingStreet.com] and continuing to run his bath house and training his disciples.Street Fighter II ending and ending artwork Honda makes a cameo appearance in Street Fighter Alpha 2, during Sodom's storyline. Sodom, obsessed with both Japanese culture and trying to revive Mad Gear, attempts to recruit sumo wrestlers, citing them as strong warriors. To achieve this he enters a sumo wrestling competition and faces \\"Fujinoyama\\", who is revealed to be Honda.Sodom: \\"I am Sodom. I've come to recruit Sumo wrestlers. I'm interested in only the strongest. Are you up for the challenge\\" / Honda: \\"You don't know me little man. I welcome your challenge!\\"Sodom's SFA2 ending, courtesy of VGMuseum Agreeing to the match, Honda defeats Sodom but is impressed by his effort nevertheless according to their dialogue in Alpha 3.Sodom: \\"What the...! Hey!! Do you remember me?!\\" / Honda: \\"You're the one who volunteered to fight at that Senshuraku! Have you improved since then? Want to try your Tsuppari on me?\\" / Sodom: \\"DOSUKOI!! Uhh...I mean GO FOR IT!!\\" Honda and Sodom match dialogue in SFA3 In Street Fighter Alpha 3, his storyline in this game serves more of a prologue to his appearance in Street Fighter II, with him traveling the world looking for strong opponents and to show the strength of sumo wrestling. Here he meets Ryu and has a sparring match with him, and tells Sakura later on where she can find him. About this time he fights Sodom again in a friendly match as well.Honda's Street Fighter Alpha 3 storyline His wanderings lead him to Shadaloo's base where he meets Zangief, and while the actual extent of which is unknown the two are confirmed to have worked together to help destroy the base.Street Fighter Eternal Challenge In the aftermath he took in a few of Bison's Dolls to give them somewhere to stay until they could regain their memories (which ones in particular is never exactly certain due to Capcom reusing sprites in his ending for the Dolls). According to this game's ending and supported by his card profile in SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters DS he may additionally have given them training in sumo during their stay, though none of his pupils in other games are female leaving this definitely up to question.\\"He looks like a traditionalist but coaches ladies member of the Dolls in Sumo Art. That's just not kosher!\\" SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters DS card profile for E. Honda Honda returns for Street Fighter IV, which is set shortly after the events of the second World Warrior Tournament. His goals have not changed, as his bio states that he is fighting to promote the technique of sumo. To this end, he goes on a world tour.Famitsu February issue, pg. 163 It is revealed that he is a haridashi-yokozuna (effectively meaning that he is of yokozuna level skill and achievement, but has yet to be officially promoted). His rival fight is against El Fuerte, after which the two share a meal. Honda returns in the fourth season of Street Fighter V, having reopened the Honda Sento bathhouse and working to keep its guests happy. Honda has made several appearances outside of the main Street Fighter franchise. SNK vs. Capcom continues his Street Fighter II storyline, as he strives to prove the strength of sumo to the world. He mentions his disciples in his ending, placing this version of him closer to his SFII counterpart in terms of continuity. Marvel vs. Capcom features a stage titled \\"Honda's Bath House\\", however, this version appears drastically different from its Street Fighter II counterpart. Honda makes a cameo appearance in Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix, in the bar stage, sitting next to Cammy and being served by Dee Jay. =In other media= alt= In the 1994 motion picture based on the Street Fighter franchise, the role of Honda is played by Peter \\"Navy\\" Tuiasosopo. In the movie, Honda is portrayed as a close associate of Chun Li, serving as her news crew technician and aiding her on her quest to avenge her father's death alongside Balrog. Like Balrog, he has a personal grudge against Shadaloo, who ruined his reputation as a sumo (though no details on how are given). In the film's climax he battles Zangief, smashing through Bison's base. While he remains Japanese ethnically just like in the games, he is native to Hawaii, just as many Japanese Americans are. His personality is rather laid back compared to his video game counterpart, and is shown to have a near immunity to pain when one of Bison's goons attempts to torture him, something he attributes to his discipline in sumo when Balrog asks about it. He does seem to enjoy fighting when he gets a chance to with Zangief, despite the degree of damage that it causes. This version of Honda appeared in both the arcade and console games based on the film. In his arcade ending it states that he returned to the world of professional sumo and regained the title of yokuzuna.\\"With Bison and his plans foiled, Honda is free to rejoin the sport of Sumo in Japan. He quits his job as GNT News tech and rejoins and dominates the world of sumo, regaining once more the title of True Yokuzuna.\\" Arcade ending for Street Fighter: The Movie The console game took this and expanded upon it, stating that he and Zangief had formed a friendship and had practice matches with Honda only having one win over Zangief. The outcomes of said matches however seem to be just as calamitous as their original bout, resulting in the destruction of five sumo dojos.\\"Currently ahead by only a single match, Honda's record against Zangief is 86 wins, 85 losses, 27 ties and 5 destroyed Sumo dojos.\\" Console ending for Street Fighter: The Movie Honda appears as one of the more prominent characters to appear in the second half of Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie, unlike a majority of the characters that were not heavily involved in the backstory of the game. He is voiced by Daisuke Gori in the original Japanese version and by Richard Epcar in the English dub. His personality is relatively unchanged from that in the games, however his goal is shown to be to fight for cash compared to his in-game goal of proving the strength of sumo to the world. Several aspects of his character appearance here saw usage in the Street Fighter Alpha series much like many other characters, but more so in the Capcom vs. SNK games, where outright nods (such as his run animation being a direct copy of his attempt to charge into Bison) were included in the game. He is first seen wrestling with Dhalsim in Calcutta to win prize money. Dhalsim manages to slip away from his grip however, and attempts to mentally subdue Honda. Ryu's presence however distracts Dhalsim enough for Honda to regain control of the match and win due to forfeit. Honda catches up with Ryu, recognizing he helped him win and the fact Ryu is a fellow Japanese fighter, giving him half the prize money as well as a place to stay for a while. Near the movie's climax, Guile and Bison find Ryu while he is with Honda in the mountains. While Ryu tries to deal with a brainwashed Ken, Honda charges forward to take on Bison, only for Bison to teleport out of his path and Ken strikes him which sends him stumbling forward, straight into Balrog. He and Balrog end up fighting, eventually with both of them falling off a nearby cliff. However Honda seems to recover quickly enough, seen lugging both the unconscious Balrog and Guile (who was knocked out by Bison) back just as Ryu and Ken apparently defeat Bison. Paul Dobson voices Honda in the animated series, where he works for the team as a computer whiz. =Merchandising= Honda was the seventh action figure made in a series for the 1993 G.I. Joe Street Fighter line. The figure is actually unique compared to the others: no parts were reused to make it, requiring a unique mold needing to be made due to his size. The character's legs could be squeezed together to have the upper body bend down in a headbutt motion, and was jointed to allow for the Hundred Hand Slap move. The toy was discontinued in 1994. A variant of it was later released in 1994 for the Street Fighter live action movie line of toys by Hasbro, a tweaked version of the previous action figure (complicating a bit, as the toy resembled the actor in the film very little and more the video game counterpart). Like all toys in the line, both came with attachable weapon pieces despite the fact the character did not use any in the game or film. Another action figure was released much later on as part of SOTA's Revolutions Series 1.Street Fighter Revolutions Series 1 :: Action-Figure :: Toy, Collectibles and Action Figure News and Reviews from across the Globe The figure featured a positionable waist, arms, and legs, and an alternate head for different facial expression. A limited edition version of the figure using Honda's default Street Fighter II Turbo colors was released in the second quarter of 2008, with only 504 units produced. Reception In 1992, E. Honda ranked at number eight on the list of Best Characters of 1991 by the Gamest magazine in Japan.

H., Dioli, M., Hassanin, A., Melville, R. A., Olson, L. E., Seveau, A., and Timm, R. M., 2001. Debate on the authenticity of Pseudonovibos spiralis as a new species of wild bovid from Vietnam and Cambodia. Journal of Zoology 255:437‚Äì444.  Characteristics  The kting voar is normally described as a cow-like animal with peculiar twisting horns about 45 centimetres (20 inches) long and spotted fur. It often has some sort of connection with snakes, varying between stories.  Names  Kting voar is the animal's Cambodian name. This was erroneously translated in the West as 'jungle sheep', leading to a mistaken assumption that the animal was related to sheep and goats. Adding to the confusion, the Vietnamese name linh d∆∞∆°ng meaning ('antelope') or ('gnu') was once reported to refer to this animal. However, this is in fact a local name of the mainland serow. Other Kampuchean names possibly include kting sipuoh ('snake-eating cattle') and khting p√¥s. The Latinized binomial \\"Pseudonovibos spiralis\\" is invalid, given that the holotype for the species was identified as a domesticated cow. However, the name would mean c.f. 'fake new cattle' with 'spiral' horns.  Controversy  For Western scientists, the first evidence supporting the kting voar's existence was a set of horns found by biologist Wolfgang Peter in a Ho Chi Minh City market (Peter & Feiler, 1994a). The horns were so unusual that Peter believed them to belong to a new species (Peter & Feiler, 1994b). No anatomical information, except for horns and frontlets, is available, so the phylogenetic status of the kting voar has been uncertain. Peter & Feiler (1994a) proposed the relationships of P. spiralis with Antilopini, but morphological analyses by Dioli (1995, 1997) and Timm & Brandt (2001) suggest affinities within Bovini, while Nadler (1997) believed P. spiralis to be related to Caprini. Genetic studies using alleged kting voar specimens have produced confusing results (Hammer et al., 1999; Kuznetsov et al., 2001a,b, 2002). However, these results from DNA have been demonstrated to be cases of DNA contamination (Hassanin & Douzery, 2000; Hassanin, 2002; Olson & Hassanin, 2003). All supposed kting voar specimens that were subject to DNA analysis to date have turned out to be artificially shaped cattle horns (Hassanin et al., 2001; Thomas, Seveau, and Hassanin, 2001; Hassanin, 2002). The most likely explanation, given the DNA testing results and the unusual spotted fur (which is well known in domesticated, but unknown in wild cattle), seem to be that modern specimens at least are cattle horns shaped by a complicated technique in order to serve as anti-snake talismans. The vigorous controversy over the existence of P. spiralis has been covered in Nature (Whitfield, 2002), New York Times (Mydans, 2002), and Science (Malakoff, 2001). There is also an earlier report of British tiger- hunters in the first part the 20th century, who observed kting voar and shot two as tiger bait. Skeptical opinion is that the kting voar is a mythical animal. Cow horns are often sold as imitation kting voar horns in Kampuche markets. However, some scientists, notably American mammalogist Dr. Robert Timm, consider it probable that the root of the folklore is a real, distinct species of wild bovid (Brandt et al., 2001; Timm & Brandt, 2001). If so, this animal would be highly endangered or more probably recently extinct, because rampant hunting and deforestation decimated populations of other big mammals in the region. More recently, Feiler et al. (2002) established that most of the horn sheaths of the kting voar, including the holotype were superficially embellished, but added that it remains to be seen whether these horns belong to cattle or a distinct species in its own right. Until further evidence is obtained, the kting voar's existence as a real species should be regarded as questionable (Galbreath & Melville, 2003). References =General references= * Dioli M., 1995.

She made her singing debut in 1971 in East Berlin with the band Die Cropies. After two years at university, she broke off her linguistics studies; however, her application to the Hochschule f√ºr Musik \\"Hanns Eisler\\" was rejected. She continued to sing with various bands, including the Oktoberklub, a politically oriented vocal group. Finally, in 1977 she received her diploma from the Friedrichshain School of Music, following three years of study; this was necessary in East Germany to perform as a professional musician. In 1978, she joined the band Familie Silly, which was renamed Silly in 1980. In 1981 Danz was chosen as best female rock singer in East Germany (\\"Rocklady Nr. 1 der DDR\\"), and again in 1983, 1985, and 1986. Danz was the singer of the all-star band Gitarreros in 1986, where she became acquainted with guitarist Uwe Hassbecker of Stern Meissen, who would later become her partner and would join Silly later in the year. With the Gitarreros she performed a duet of Bryan Adams and Tina Turner's \\"It's Only Love\\" with Mike Kilian of Rockhaus. Other On 18 September 1989, she was a co-author and signatory of the \\"Resolution der Rockmusiker und Liedermacher\\" (Resolution of Rock Musicians and Songwriters). This was a petition to the GDR government, in which political reforms and the legalization of opposition political groups were demanded. Danz read the text illegally at concerts. In 1990, she was on several different round tables for the reform of the GDR. Last years/death Danz was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1995, during the recording of Silly's final album, Paradies.

Founded in East Germany in 1977, Silly was one of the country's most popular music acts, and was well known for its charismatic lead singer Tamara Danz. Her death in 1996 ended the band's recording career after 18 years. In 2005 the surviving members began to perform as Silly again, first with several guest singers, before choosing actress Anna Loos to replace Danz. The first album with the new line-up, Alles Rot, became the band's most successful to date, reaching number 3 on the German charts in 2010. Band history The band was founded in East Berlin in 1977 as Familie Silly (The Silly Family) by guitarist Thomas Fritzsching and bassist Mathias Schramm, evolving from Fritzsching's previous band Ph√∂nix. They added Familie to the band's name after East German authorities refused to allow Silly by itself, as they saw it as an anglicism; the band claimed that Silly was the name of their mascot, a cat, who behaved in a silly manner. The early band also consisted of keyboardists Ulrich Mann and Manfred Kusno and drummer Mike Schafmeier. They recruited singer Tamara Danz, the daughter of a diplomat who had previously studied linguistics; she had previously worked as a singer in both the Oktoberklub, a politically charged vocal group, and the Horst-Kr√ºger-Band, a popular progressive rock ensemble. Silly's first notable concert appearances outside East Germany were in Romania, where the band gained a strong following; it helped that Fritzsching and Danz could speak Romanian fluently. They participated in several music festivals, and in 1981 won the Lyra in Bratislava, the communist bloc's best-known music prize (akin to the Sanremo Music Festival). The band was also allowed to perform in Norway. Unusually, the band's first, self-titled album was released first in West Germany in 1981, where it sold moderately well; this was due in part to the enthusiasm of West German record promoters (including photographer Jim Rakete) for the band, in contrast to the East German state record label Amiga's reluctance to produce an album. After the album was released, the band made the acquaintance of poet Werner Karma, who would write the lyrics for the band's albums until 1989. His complex and often politically charged lyrics gave the band a strong intellectual appeal, but frequently landed them in trouble with the censors, who demanded changes before allowing a song to be performed. With the West German album a fait accompli, Amiga was forced to issue it domestically, as Tanzt keiner Boogie? (Isn't Anyone Going to Boogie?), where it was immensely popular; the revised version dropped two songs in favor of two new recordings with lyrics by Karma, one of which, the atypical Der letzte Kunde (The Last Customer), a paean to alcoholism sung by drummer Schafmeier, became the early band's signature tune. In 1982, Danz's then-boyfriend R√ºdiger \\"Ritchie\\" Barton joined the band, replacing its two keyboardists. His first appearance was a note-for-note cover version of Kim Carnes' hit \\"Bette Davis Eyes\\", which, following long-standing practice, the state recording label Amiga issued to avoid having to pay performance royalties for the original song. While it earned the band substantial publicity, they showed their evident unhappiness with it by performing it on television dressed as schoolchildren eating ice cream (Eis, in German, is pronounced much as \\"eyes\\"). The song was the only Silly release not to be in German; it was also their last release under the name \\"Familie Silly\\". Stairway to Mont Klamott in winter 1988 already ingrown in the parks appearance Barton's synthesizer playing lent a new wave edge to the band's subsequent album, Mont Klamott, named for the \\"rubbish mountain\\" in Berlin's Friedrichshain district that was built over the debris of a World War II flak tower in a park of the neighbourhood. The title track, a massive hit in East Germany, is typical of Karma's narrative writing style, with several overtones. It concerns a conversation between two women, one old and one young; the younger one thanks the city fathers for the hill, which for her is only as a place to catch some fresh air; the older replies to her that it was the city mothers ‚Äî Germany's Tr√ºmmerfrauen ‚Äî who had built the hill from the city ruins. Mont Klamott was voted East Germany's Album of the Year, cementing Silly's popularity. At the time, the band toured constantly, spending most of its time on the road. Schafmeier was forced to leave the band for health reasons, and he took the band's best-known song \\"Der letzte Kunde\\" with him, joining the cabaret trio MTS. He was replaced by Herbert Junck, formerly of NO 55. Silly's censorship problem became more acute in 1985 when their planned album Zwischen unbefahr'nen Gleisen (Between Untraveled Tracks; presumably those between the two German states), was blocked by East German officials, who had taken exception to the \\"subversive\\" message of several tracks. It was eventually released as Liebeswalzer (Waltz of Love), containing rewritten lyrics. The offending songs, \\"Tausend Augen\\" (\\"Thousand Eyes\\"), \\"Nur ein Lied\\" (\\"Only a Song\\"), and the title track, were re-recorded with new lyrics and arrangements and renamed \\"Psycho\\", \\"Gro√üer Tr√§umer\\" (\\"Big Dreamer\\"), and \\"Berliner Fr√ºhling\\" (\\"Berlin Spring\\"). In 1990, as East Germany was in its dying days, Liebeswalzer was re-released with the three songs in their original form. The unaltered album was finally released on CD with both versions, in 1994. Despite the controversy, Liebeswalzer again was voted Album of the Year, and Silly won one argument with the censors over the word Titten (tits) in the song \\"So 'ne kleine Frau\\" (Such a Little Woman), which was left unaltered. Bassist J√§cki Reznicek, formerly of Pankow, played fretless bass on the title track to the next album, Bataillon d'Amour (Battalion of Love, 1986), which proved to be one of the best-known songs ever to come out of East Germany (the main bass line was played by Schramm). The album was released on CBS Records in West Germany, although CBS rejected the East German cover artwork as amateurish and supplied their own. The song \\"Schlohwei√üer Tag\\" (Snow White Day) was later used in Heiner Carow's 1989 film Coming Out. After the album was released, Schramm was asked to leave the band, and was replaced by Reznicek. Following the success of Bataillon d'Amour, the band took a two- year break from recording, during which they split with Karma. He contributed only two songs to Silly's next effort, Februar, released in that month in 1989 (in West Germany; the domestic release was a month later). After a falling out with Werner Karma, Danz sought the assistance of up-and-coming singer- songwriter Gerhard Gundermann in writing lyrics, who had already drawn notice for his witty wordplay on his 1988 debut album. Recorded in West Berlin, the album was, like its predecessor, state-of-the-art, and as a co-production with a West German label, there was, for the first time, no censorship. Joining the band was guitarist Uwe Hassbecker, Danz's new paramour, formerly of Stern Mei√üen, whom she had met while singing in the East German supergroup, Die Gitarreros, in 1986. His heavy metal-inspired playing contrasted with Thomas Fritzsching's more melodic approach, causing Fritzsching to be marginalized; although technically the bandleader, he was excluded from the recording sessions. Again, it was released on a West German label, this time Ariola, and again the cover artwork was replaced with a more sophisticated version. While not an enormous hit in the west, the track \\"Verlorene Kinder\\" (\\"Lost Children\\") received some airplay. The Song is about children, who living in dysfunctional families. The song was only able to release in East Germany, because the critic of the song was officially seen as critic on West Berlin conditions. The track \\"Ein Gespenst geht um\\" (A Ghost Haunts), an oblique political commentary which drew on a quotation by Karl Marx about political change in the air (although the ghost here haunted a Mitropa restaurant rather than Europa), and the song seemed somewhat prescient in light of the fall of the Berlin Wall in November that year. Also \\"√úber ihr taute das Eis\\" (\\"The ice thawed over her\\") was an unusual song for East german conditions, telling the story of a minor girls suicide. However, the end of communism did not lead to a breakthrough for Silly. Although Danz had petitioned the East German government for change during 1989, and illegally read out petitions during the band's concerts, interest in East German bands plummeted after November 9, 1989, when East Germans were able to cross into West Germany and easily get their hands on western rock music. Danz performed as a backup singer at a massive free concert featuring the likes of Joe Cocker following the Wall opening. She later expressed skepticism that her involvement with the Neues Forum reform movement had produced any results. At the same time, however, the West German label Ariola believed Silly could be turned into a household name across all of Germany. The band were invited to Bavaria to work on a new album. But Danz felt constrained by the Ariola executives, who deemed the band's songs not commercial, and provided them with chart-friendly music and lyrics by outside writers. Silly walked out. Instead, Silly's next album would be the self-produced Hurens√∂hne (Sons of Bitches), released in 1993 on DSB, the successor label to the state-run Amiga. Again, the lyrics were penned by Danz and Gundermann, separately and together; as the album's title suggests, they were angry. The song \\"Neider\\" (The Enviers) addresses the band's treatment at the hands of Ariola. The album closer, \\"Traumpaar\\" (Dream Couple) imagines the two German states as a dancing pair, die Schlampe und der Held ‚Äî the whore and the hero. Largely ignored in western Germany, Hurens√∂hne reestablished Silly as an important band in the east, as fans returned in droves amid disillusionment with German reunification. The group's concerts once again sold out. After the album, Danz, Hassbecker, and Barton began building their own recording studio in Berlin, named Danzmusik. Fritzsching, the band's founder, whose guitar contributions had become overshadowed by those of Hassbecker, was asked to leave the band. Late during the recording for the follow-up, Paradies, in 1995, Danz was diagnosed with breast cancer. Although she was operated on immediately, the disease had spread, and she refused chemotherapy, instead choosing an ineffective alternative medicine treatment. She died the following July, five months after the album had come out. Shortly before her death, she married Hassbecker, her live-in partner of many years; she said this was in part to avoid taxes on her share of the studio. Paradies was the first album on which Danz alone had written the lyrics, and several of its song seem to reflect on her impending death, although Danz denied this, saying that the words had been written before her diagnosis. The album was photographed by the band's old friend Jim Rakete. Despite minimal publicity, and the lack, for obvious reasons, of a tour, it sold reasonably well, and its title track became a radio hit. The band did not break up after Danz's death; the remaining members (Barton, Hassbecker, Rezniczek, and Junck) completed two unfinished tracks for inclusion on a pair of greatest hits albums, the first of which sold well over 100,000 copies, no small achievement for a compilation of an East German band. The remaining members performed Silly's songs on tour on two occasions, the first \\"borrowing\\" singer Toni Krahl from the band City for a number of one-off performances, and in 2005 using several well-known singers on a German tour promoted as a tribute to both Danz and Junck, who had died of cancer earlier in the year. In 2006 Hassbecker, Barton, and Reznicek announced a new electro- acoustic tour with actress and singer Anna Loos; the live band included Reznicek's son Bastian on drums, Hassbecker's son Daniel on cello, and former Rockhaus guitarist Reinhard Petereit. Initially billed as \\"Silly with Anna Loos\\", the band asked Loos to join the band permanently following the tour. At Loos' suggestion, the band approached, and reconciled with, lyricist Werner Karma. In early 2010, the band, which had no members from its original lineup, released its first new album since 1996, Alles Rot (Everything Red), with all its lyrics written by Karma. Thanks in part to the attention drawn by Loos, Silly was able to sign to the major label Universal Music. The album proved to be the band's most successful to date, reaching number 3 on the German charts, and the band toured to numerous sold-out venues. Legacy In 1998, singer Joachim Witt had a hit in Germany with a cover version of \\"Bataillon d'Amour.\\" The Polish goth metal band Batalion d'Amour was also named for the song.

It replaced the West Side Elevated Highway, built between 1929 and 1951, which was shut down in 1973 due to neglect and lack of maintenance, and was dismantled by 1989. The term \\"West Side Highway\\" is often mistakenly used to include the roadway north of 72nd Street, which is properly known as the Henry Hudson Parkway. The current highway was complete by 2001, but required reconstruction after the September 11 attacks that year, when the collapse of the World Trade Center caused debris to fall onto the surrounding areas, damaging the highway. It uses the surface streets that existed before the elevated highway was built: West Street, Eleventh Avenue and Twelfth Avenue. A short section of 12th Avenue still runs between 125th and 138th Streets, under the Riverside Drive Viaduct. Eleventh Avenue is a separate street north of 22nd Street. The portion between West 42nd Street and Canal Street is part of the Lincoln Highway. Route description The highway is a six-to-eight lane urban boulevard, with the northernmost section, from 59th Street to 72nd Street (where it becomes the Henry Hudson Parkway), elevated above a former rail yard adjacent to tracks still used by Amtrak. Trucks and buses are allowed only on the surface section. The West Side Highway's surface section takes three names: West Street from the Battery Park Underpass north to Tenth Avenue, then 11th Avenue to 22nd Street, and finally 12th Avenue to 59th Street. Beginning of West Street and the West Side Highway starting from the Battery Park Underpass =West Street= The highway begins from Battery Park close to the mouth of the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel where it also accepts traffic from the southern terminus of the Franklin D. Roosevelt East River Drive. From there, the route passes close to the site of the World Trade Center at Vesey Street. The route continues with this name passing by numerous piers along the Hudson River until Gansevoort Street in the Meatpacking District where it becomes Eleventh Avenue. =Eleventh Avenue= Eleventh Avenue begins just north of the intersection with Tenth Avenue. The highway is concurrent with Eleventh Avenue north of this point, passing by the 14th Street Park at 14th Street. The highway continues with this name alongside the Chelsea Piers until it reaches 22nd Street where the highway branches off from Eleventh Avenue onto Twelfth Avenue. =Twelfth Avenue= At 22nd Street, the highway continues as Twelfth Avenue passing by the Chelsea Waterside Park. It passes just west of the Javits Center from 34th Street to 38th Street and over the Lincoln Tunnel at 39th Street. The road continues past the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum and Piers 84 to 92, a major cruise ship terminal building. At 54th Street, 12th Avenue attains a highway with service roads character, with the service roads running as far as 59th Street. From there, Twelfth Avenue becomes elevated and at 72nd Street, the highway becomes the Henry Hudson Parkway. The last elevated portion of the West Side Highway by Trump Place apartment complex West Side Elevated Highway Various proposals circulated in the 1920s to build an expressway on the west side. Among the proposals: * Rail/Highway Double Decker ‚Äì The New York Central Railroad proposed building a highway/rail double decked highway from 72nd Street to Canal Street, which would be constructed privately at no cost to the city. It would eliminate 106 grade crossings over 84 blocks. It ran into opposition because of fears that it would create a rail monopoly. * Hencken's Ten-story Train/Car/Office/People Mover ‚Äì Engineer John Hencken proposed an exotic ten-story complex with a rail line underground, a road at street level, and a people mover built above that, topped by ten stories of apartments and offices. The highway would run on top of the ten-story buildings. A similar alternative was offered by Benjamin Battin. Manhattan borough president Julius Miller said that something had to be done right away and ultimately pushed through the plan for the West Side Elevated Highway, which was to eventually bear his name. The proposal immediately ran into stiff opposition. The City Club and New York City Mayor James J. Walker objected to the highway on the grounds that it would block waterfront-bound freight traffic. At the time, West Street exhibited a \\"daily avalanche of freight and passengers in traffic\\", and was \\"walled by an unbroken line of bulkhead sheds and dock structures\\", p. 69 blocking the view not only of the river, but even of the ships being serviced, and the commerce carried out on those piers and slips was vital to the economic health of the city. They believed that the plans should wait until the surface railroad tracks were removed in the area, at which point the elevated highway might not be necessary. Many objected that it would be ugly. Finally, in 1929, construction started, and the section between Canal Street and West 72nd Street was completed in 1937, with a \\"Southern Extension\\" to the Brooklyn‚ÄìBattery Tunnel completed in 1951. =Robert Moses proposals= The elevated road began before Robert Moses came on the scene. However, Moses built massive projects extending from the north and south ends of the West Side Highway. * Henry Hudson Parkway ‚Äì The West Side Highway becomes the Henry Hudson Parkway just north of 72nd Street thanks to efforts by Moses called the \\"West Side Improvement.\\" The parkway does not permit trucks. The parkway is partially an elevated highway over the rail tracks (now used by Amtrak). * Brooklyn‚ÄìBattery Tunnel ‚Äì The highway hooks into the Brooklyn‚ÄìBattery Tunnel at its southern end. Moses had proposed to create the \\"Brooklyn‚ÄìBattery Crossing Bridge\\" but federal intervention obliged Moses to use a tunnel instead. * Battery Park Underpass connects to FDR Drive. In the 1960s, Moses proposed straightening the West Side Highway, widening both the highway and the Henry Hudson Parkway, and constructing both the Lower Manhattan Expressway and the Mid-Manhattan Expressways, connecting routes that would have stretched across Manhattan. None of these projects were ever built. Later, in his 80s, he opposed the Westway project, but by that time his power was gone and his ideas generally weren't taken seriously. Rather than constructing a below-grade interstate highway, Moses proposed merely straightening and rebuilding the West Side Highway south of 59th Street.Robert Moses' proposal. Between 59th and 72nd Streets, the site of the former Penn Central 60th Street rail yard, he proposed bringing the highway to grade and moving it eastward to allow for a waterfront park and some housing at the southeast corner of the rail yard.Robert Moses' Highway and Housing Proposal, 1975 This was the nucleus of the idea that led to the plan for Riverside South. The old elevated highway, collapsed at 14th Street =1973 collapse= The highway was obsolete almost from the beginning. Its lanes were considered too narrow and it could not accommodate trucks. Sharp \\"S\\" exit ramps proved hazardous, as did the left-hand exit and entrance lanes that made merging dangerous. On December 15, 1973, the northbound lanes between Little West 12th Street and Gansevoort Street collapsed under the weight of a dump truck, which was carrying over of asphalt for ongoing repairs of the highway. A four-door sedan followed the truck through the hole; neither driver was seriously injured. The next day, both directions were 'indefinitely' closed south of 18th Street. This not only closed off the oldest section (between Canal Street and 18th Street), but also the newest sections (south of Canal Street), because ramps south of the collapse only permitted northbound entrances and southbound exits. The southernmost northbound exit was at 23rd Street. Westway Protesters demonstrating against the Westway project in New York City In 1971, the Urban Development Corporation (UDC) proposed rebuilding the highway as Interstate 478\\\\. UDC's \\"Water Edge Study\\" called for the highway to be routed above the water at the ends of the then mostly abandoned piers on the Hudson River and the addition of hundreds of acres of concrete platforms between the bulkhead and the pierhead lines for parks and apartments.Peter Blake, \\"The City Politic: Ratensky's Raiders,\\" New York Magazine, July 5, 1971. The final plan, championed by New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller and Mayor John Lindsay, called for burying the six-lane highway in of new landfill south of 40th Street, placing the accompanying development on land instead of on platforms. It was renamed \\"Westway\\" in 1974. Hugh Carey, who was to become governor, and Ed Koch, who was to become mayor, both campaigned against the plan saying that it would be a waste of government funds and would be a windfall for private developers. After the two were elected, they both reversed their position and supported the plan. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan's Department of Transportation and the United States Army Corps of Engineers were on board for the construction with a 1981 price tag of $2.1 billion. But in 1982, Judge Thomas Griesa of the U.S. District Court blocked the Corps permit, saying the road would harm striped bass. His order was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. In August 1985, Judge Griesa ruled that state and federal agencies provided tainted testimony regarding the striped bass. At the same time, Congress moved to deny necessary funding for the landfill.Oresekes, Michael. \\"Moynihan Sees No Way to Win a Westway Vote\\", The New York Times (September 19, 1985) On September 30, 1985, New York City officially gave up on the project, allocating 60 percent of its interstate highway funds to mass transit and setting aside $811 million for the \\"West Side Highway Replacement Project\\". =Corruption= The project eventually incurred costs of more than $4 billion. Judge Griesa held that Westway supporters had colluded to cover up and withhold scientific evidence damaging to the project and had given false testimony. In 1984, a 119-page report was issued by the State Investigation Commission. Riverside South In the 1970s, debates raged about what to do with the elevated section from West 72nd Street and 59th Street. One version of Westway would have continued the buried highway up to the George Washington Bridge, eliminating the elevated section between 59th and 72nd streets, as well as the Henry Hudson Parkway. That option was rejected because of the cost and because it would violate the Blumenthal Amendment, which prohibited any highway construction that would alter Riverside Park.New York State DOT and FHWA, \\"West Side Highway Project: Section 6 of the Final Environmental Impact Statement,\\", pp. 7, 8, 1975, 1977 The New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) rejected former parks commissioner Robert Moses's proposal to relocate the elevated section to grade also because of the Blumenthal Amendment as well as the presumed negative effect on development opportunities.NYSDOT and FHWA, \\"West Side Highway Project Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS),\\" Section 6, June 4, 1977, pp. 7, 8. Donald Trump, who had an option on the property, seized on Moses's proposal as a way to enhance his development plans,\\"Park Extension Sought by Trump,\\" Carter B. Horsley, New York Times, May 9, 1976. thus negating one of NYSDOT's objections, but his proposed 12,000-unit residential development went nowhere. So NYSDOT planned for a renovation of the viaduct.NYSDOT and FHWA, \\"West Side Highway Project Final Environmental Impact Statement,\\" June 4, 1977, p. 32. A subsequent development project, Lincoln West, accepted the elevated highway, but, although Lincoln West won approval from the City,Joyce Purnick, \\"Estimate Board Gives Approval to Lincoln West\\", New York Times, September 17, 1982. it failed to obtain financing. Later, Trump acquired the property and proposed Television City, a design based on a massive 13-block-long podium to hide the elevated highway. Responding to criticism,Paul Goldberger, \\"Television City Project: Tempered but Still Big\\", New York Times, Oct., 24, 1986. Trump switched architects, reduced the podium to eight blocks in length, and changed the name to Trump City. Six civic organizations opposed to Trump City proposed a plan that would relocate and bury the highway in conjunction with a much smaller development and a southward extension of Riverside Park. Trump eventually agreed to this plan, known as Riverside South.Todd S. Purdum, \\"Trump Revises Project Plan for West Side\\", New York Times, March 6, 1991. After city approval in 1992, work began on the new apartment complex. As part of the Riverside South agreement, the Urban Development Corporation proceeded with planning and environmental studies for a relocated highway. But relocating and burying the elevated highway section became politically complicated when, at the same time, NYSDOT went ahead with its $70 million project to straighten, widen, and reinforce the viaduct. In 2005 Trump's majority partners sold the project to the Carlyle Group and Extell Development Company. In June 2006, the new developer began construction of a tunnel between 61st and 65th streets for the relocated highway.James Barron, \\"The Surprise in This Box? A Highway, Some Assembly Required\\", New York Times, June 23, 2006. West Side Highway Replacement Project The least leafy portion of the new boulevard is the part by the midtown piers between 34th and 59th Street. This shows the West Side Highway at the Jacob Javits Convention Center. The bike path is in the foreground. Following the end of the Westway project, there were debates on what to do about the rest of the highway. Vollmer Associates was contracted for the highway replacement project in September 1986. There were four alternatives: three at-grade options with a varying number of lanes and quality of roadway, and one option with grade-separated ramps over busy intersections. By November, a commission was set up to discuss the alternatives. Four days later, several sections of the highway were agreed on. It would be an elevated highway north of 49th Street; an at-grade roadway between 44th and 25th Streets, including a depressed northbound roadway from 32nd to 42nd Streets; a tunnel under a park between 20th and 25th Streets; an at-grade boulevard between 20th and Houston Streets; an at-grade road with a 3-lane elevated ramp between Houston and Harrison Streets; and a 9-lane boulevard with depressed ramps through Battery Park City. There would be 26 traffic lights. This proposal was assailed by mass-transit associations, environmental groups, and elected officials. In January 1987, the commission unanimously agreed to build the highway as a six-lane urban boulevard with a parkway-style median and decorative lightposts. There would be a $100 million park on the highway's western periphery, the latter of which was criticized by Governor Mario Cuomo as being too expensive. Afterward, there were some delays caused by Cuomo's reluctance to prioritize the project. In the meantime, the old, abandoned highway was being used by squatters. One of the first options to be rejected in 1989 was the construction of a boulevard on landfill, which was the reason for Westway's cancellation. There were also proposals for \\"cove\\" developments alongside the future boulevard. Construction began in early 1996 on the West Side Highway project. The first of the project's seven segments‚Äîbetween Clarkson and Horatio streets in the Greenwich Village neighborhood‚Äîwas completed in 1998. Construction of the West Side Highway Replacement Project was completed between the Battery and 59th Street in August 2001. The period between the 1973 collapse and the 1985 demise of Westway was a chaotic time for drivers as the original elevated highway was dismantled (finally in 1989) and traffic was rerouted to temporary highways. The new highway permits trucks, which the old elevated did not. Together with the northern Henry Hudson Parkway, it creates a leafy boulevard along the Hudson River from the northern tip to the southern tip of Manhattan. =Hudson River Park= Legislation in June 1998 followed an agreement by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Governor George Pataki to create the Hudson River Park on the west side of the highway from West 59th to the Battery. The park consists of and is the biggest park construction in the city since Central Park. A bicycle path running the length of the highway to Battery Park City was one of the first additions. Piers are currently being refurbished and other work continues, with Pier 84 as the largest. =Joe DiMaggio Highway= Even though the highway has had two other official names, the official names have never stuck. The first official name was the Miller Highway, in honor of the city council president who pushed for the highway. On March 30, 1999, at the urging of Mayor Giuliani, the highway was renamed for legendary New York Yankees player Joe DiMaggio, who had died three weeks earlier. Legislation to rename the highway had been introduced before DiMaggio died. Giuliani championed the name change because the highway would have been the approach to the proposed West Side Stadium at the highway and 32nd Street. DiMaggio lived on Manhattan's east side. Joe DiMaggio Highway sign on the elevated portion of the highway Signs bearing the new, ceremonial name of the highway were erected on April 25, 1999. This was in the midst of a reconstruction, finished on March 29, 2002, after the September 11 attacks in 2001 destroyed part of the road, which was still being rebuilt. Only minimal signage for the new name was erected as a result, while \\"West Side Highway\\" signs abound. = September 11, 2001, and aftermath= World Trade Center towers as viewed from the highway in mid-2001 Completion of the project was originally set for October 2001, but it was delayed for years due to damage caused by the September 11 attacks. The highway, which runs just west of the World Trade Center, played a major role in the September 11, 2001 attacks and its aftermath. The famous flag raising photograph by Thomas E. Franklin of the Bergen Record took place by the highway on the northwest corner of the site. In addition, three chunks of the tower that crashed into the highway were used in iconic pictures of the day. Emergency personnel went down the West Side Highway and were greeted by cheering crowds at Christopher Street on their return. Virtually all the debris from the Center traveled up the West Side Highway to be shipped off by barge. For the last half of the month, out-of-town ambulances waited on the highway for a chance to help injured patients. There was debate over whether to rebuild the damaged section of the road as a surface street or a tunnel. As a master plan was developed for Ground Zero, plans initially called for the West Side Highway to be buried in a tunnel between the site and Battery Park City that was expected to cost $1 billion. Goldman Sachs, which had planned to build its headquarters in Battery Park City, announced its intention to cancel those plans because of concerns about the traffic pattern and long-term construction disruptions. This prompted New York Governor George Pataki to cancel the tunnel project in favor of a boulevard.Goldman Sachs Breaks Ground Across From Trade Center Site, NY1, September 26, 2006 The boulevard was finished by 2014. In 2004, the police forces of both the PANYNJ and the NYPD announced concerns that the proposed One World Trade Center would be too close to the West Side Highway and thus vulnerable to car bombs. This prompted a total redesign of the tower and the relocation of its site away from the highway. There used to be four West Street pedestrian bridges, two of them erected after the September 11 attacks. A below-grade crossing of the West Side Highway connecting the Brookfield Place (formerly the World Financial Center) complex and the Concourse level of the World Trade Center opened in October 2013, allowing the pedestrian bridge adjacent to Vesey Street to be removed. On October 31, 2017, a man intentionally drove a pickup truck for a mile through the Hudson River Park's bike path, parallel to the West Side Highway, between Houston Street and Chambers Street, killing eight people and injuring at least 11. Major intersections Despite being a surface road, with many at-grade intersections and traffic lights, some of the intersections are given exit numbers.

The Narv√°ez expedition was a Spanish journey of exploration and colonization started in 1527 that intended to establish colonial settlements and garrisons in Florida. The expedition was initially led by P√°nfilo de Narv√°ez, who died in 1528. Many more people died as the expedition traveled west along the explored Gulf Coast of the present-day United States and into the American Southwest. Only four of the expedition's original members survived, reaching Mexico City in 1536. These survivors were the first known Europeans, and the first African, to see the Mississippi River, and to cross the Gulf of Mexico and Texas. , 3 vols. Narv√°ez's crew initially numbered about 600, including men from Spain, Portugal, Greece,Cabeza de Vaca's La Relacion and Italy. The expedition met with disaster almost immediately. Making stops at Hispaniola and Cuba on the way to La Florida, the fleet was devastated by a hurricane, among other storms, and lost two ships. They left Cuba in February 1528. Their intended destination was the Rio de las Palmas (near present-day Tampico, Mexico), with the purpose of founding two settlements. Storms, opposing currents, and strong winds forced them north to present-day Florida. After landing near Boca Ciega Bay, about 15 miles north of the entrance to Tampa Bay, Narv√°ez and his pilots determined that their landing place was not suitable for settlement. Narv√°ez ordered that the expedition be split, with 300 men sent overland northward along the coast and one-hundred men and ten women aboard the ships were also sent northward along the coast, as Narv√°ez intended to reunify the land and seaborne expeditions at a large harbor to the north of them that would be \\"impossible to miss\\". The land expedition and the ships never met as no large harbor existed north of their landing location. As it marched northward the land expedition encountered numerous attacks by indigenous peoples and suffered from disease and starvation. By September 1528, following an attempt by survivors to sail on makeshift rafts from Florida to Mexico, only 80 men survived a storm and were swept onto Galveston Island off the coast of Texas. The stranded survivors were enslaved by Native American tribes, and more men continued to die from harsh conditions. Only four of the original party‚Äî√Ålvar N√∫√±ez Cabeza de Vaca, Alonso del Castillo Maldonado, Andr√©s Dorantes de Carranza, and Dorantes' enslaved Moor Estevanico‚Äîsurvived the next eight years, during which they wandered through what is now the Southwestern United States and northern Mexico. They eventually encountered Spanish slave-catchers in Sinaloa in 1536, and with them, the four men finally reached Mexico City. Upon returning to Spain, Cabeza de Vaca wrote of the expedition in his La relaci√≥n (\\"The Story\\"), published in 1542 as the first written account of the natives, wildlife, flora and fauna of inland North America. It was published again by Cabeza de Vaca in 1555, this time to include descriptions of his subsequent experience as Governor of the Rio de la Plata region in South America. A translation was later published under the title Naufragios (\\"Shipwrecks\\"). Background On December 25, 1526, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, also known as Carlos I of Spain, granted P√°nfilo de Narv√°ez a license to claim what is now the Gulf Coast of the United States for the Kingdom of Spain. The contract gave him one year to gather an army, leave Spain, found at least two towns of one hundred people each, and garrison two additional forts anywhere along the coast. Narv√°ez had to secure his own funding for the expedition. He recruited investors by marketing the promise of riches comparable to those recently discovered by Hern√°n Cort√©s in Mexico. He also called in many debts owed to him, and used this money to pay for major expenses of the expedition. Appointed by the Spanish Crown as treasurer and sheriff, √Ålvar N√∫√±ez Cabeza de Vaca was to serve as the king's eyes and ears, and was second-in-command. He was to ensure the Crown received one fifth of any wealth acquired during the expedition. Other expedition members included Alonso de Sol√≠s as royal inspector of mines, Alonso Enr√≠quez as comptroller, an Aztec prince named \\"Don Pedro\\" by the Spanish, and a contingent of Franciscan and diocesan priests led by Padre Juan Su√°rez (sometimes spelled \\"Xu√°rez\\"). Most of the expedition's 600 men were soldiers, chiefly from Spain and Portugal, including some of mixed African descent, and some 22 from Italy.Boscolo, Alberto.

The expedition  On June 17, 1527, the expedition departed Spain from the port of Sanl√∫car de Barrameda at the mouth of the Guadalquivir River. The total force included about 450 troops, officers, and slaves. About 150 others were sailors, wives (married men could not travel without their wives to the Indies), and servants. The first stop on the voyage was the Canary Islands, about a week's journey and 850 miles into the Atlantic. There the expedition resupplied such items as water, wine, firewood, meats, and fruit. = Hispaniola and Cuba = The explorers arrived in Santo Domingo (Hispaniola) sometime in August 1527. During the stay, troops began deserting. Although always a problem on such expeditions, the men may also have deserted because of hearing about the recent return of an expedition led by Lucas V√°zquez de Ayll√≥n, in which 450 of 600 men perished. Nearly 100 men deserted the Narv√°ez expedition in the first month in Santo Domingo. The expedition stopped here to purchase horses, as well as two small ships for exploring the coastline. Although Narv√°ez was able to buy only one small ship, he set sail once again. The expedition arrived in Santiago de Cuba in late September. As Cuba was the home of Narv√°ez and his family, he had many contacts through whom he could collect more supplies, horses, and men. After meeting with his wealthy friend Vasco Porcallo, Narv√°ez sent part of the fleet to Trinidad to collect horses and other supplies from his friend's estate. Narv√°ez put Cabeza de Vaca and a captain named Pantoja in charge of two ships sent to Trinidad, while he took the other four ships to the Gulf of Guacanayabo. On about October 30, the two ships arrived in Trinidad to collect requisitioned supplies and seek additional crew. A hurricane arrived shortly after they did. During the storm, both ships sank, 60 men were killed, a fifth of the horses drowned, and all the new supplies acquired in Trinidad were destroyed. Recognizing the need to regroup, Narv√°ez sent the four remaining ships to Cienfuegos under the command of Cabeza de Vaca. Narv√°ez stayed ashore in order to recruit men and purchase more ships. After nearly four months, on February 20, 1528, he arrived in Cienfuegos with one of two new ships and a few more recruits. The other ship he sent on to Havana. At this point, the expedition had about 400 men and 80 horses. The winter layover caused a depletion of supplies, and they planned to restock in Havana on the way to the Florida coast. Among those hired by Narv√°ez was a master pilot named Diego Miruelo, who claimed extensive knowledge of the Gulf Coast. Historians have debated for centuries his full identity and the extent of his knowledge. In any case, two days after leaving Cienfuegos, every ship in the fleet ran aground on the Canarreos shoals just off the coast of Cuba. They were stuck for two to three weeks, while the men depleted the already meager supplies. Not until the second week of March, when a storm created large seas, were they able to escape the shoals. After battling more storms, the expedition rounded the western tip of Cuba and made its way toward Havana. Although they were close enough to see the masts of ships in port, the wind blew the fleet into the Gulf of Mexico without their reaching Havana. Narv√°ez decided to press on with the journey and colonization plans. They spent the next month trying to reach the Mexican coast but could not overcome the Gulf Stream's powerful current. = Arrival in Florida = Marker at the Jungle Prada Site On April 12, 1528, the expedition spotted land north of what is now Tampa Bay. They turned south and traveled for two days looking for what the pilot Miruelo described as a great harbor. During these two days, one of the five remaining ships was lost. Finally, after spotting a shallow bay, Narv√°ez ordered entry. They passed into Boca Ciega Bay north of the entrance to Tampa Bay. They spotted buildings set upon earthen mounds, encouraging signs of culture (and wealth), food, and water. The natives have since been identified as members of the Safety Harbor Culture. The Spaniards dropped anchors and prepared to go ashore. Narv√°ez landed with 300 men in Boca Ciega Bay at what is known as the Jungle Prada Site in present-day St. Petersburg. The comptroller Alonso Enr√≠quez was one of the first ashore. Making his way to the nearby native village, he traded items such as glass beads, brass bells, and cloth for fresh fish and venison. Narv√°ez ordered the rest of the company to debark and establish a camp. The next day, the royal officials assembled ashore and, with ritual, performed the formal declaration of Narv√°ez as royal governor of La Florida. He read (in Spanish) the Requerimiento, which stated to any natives listening that their land belonged to Charles V by order of the Pope. He also said that natives had the choice of converting to Christianity. If they converted, they would be loved and welcomed with open arms; if they chose not to, war would be made against them. The expedition ignored both pleas and threats by a party of natives the next day. After some exploring, Narv√°ez and some other officers discovered Old Tampa Bay. They headed back to the camp and ordered Miruelo to pilot a brigantine (brig) in search of the great harbor he had talked about. If he was unsuccessful, he should return to Cuba. Narv√°ez never regained contact with Miruelo or any of the crew of the brig. Meanwhile, Narv√°ez took another party inland, where they found another village, perhaps Tocobaga.. The villagers were using Spanish freight boxes as coffins. The Spanish destroyed these and found a little food and gold. The locals told them that there was plenty of both in Apalachee to the north. After returning to their base camp, the Spanish made plans to head north. = Narv√°ez splits forces = On May 1, 1528, Narv√°ez made the decision to split the expedition into land and sea contingents. He planned to have an army of 300 march overland to the north while the ships, with the remaining 100 people, sailed up the coast to meet them. He believed the mouth to Tampa Bay to be a short distance to the north, when in fact it was to the south. Cabeza de Vaca argued against this plan, but was outvoted by the rest of the officers. Narv√°ez wanted Cabeza de Vaca to lead the sea force, but he refused. He later wrote it was a matter of honor, as Narv√°ez had implied he was a coward. The men marched in near-starvation for two weeks before coming upon a village north of the Withlacoochee River. They enslaved the natives and for three days helped themselves to corn from their fields. They sent two exploratory parties downstream on both sides of the river looking for signs of the ships, but found none. Narv√°ez ordered the party to continue north to Apalachee. Years later, Cabeza de Vaca learned what had become of the ships. Miruelo had returned to Old Tampa Bay in the brigantine and found all the ships gone. He sailed to Havana to pick up the fifth ship, which had been supplied, and brought it back to Tampa Bay. After heading north for some time without finding the party on land, commanders of the other three ships decided to return to Tampa Bay. After meeting, the fleet again searched for the land party for nearly a year before finally departing for Mexico. Juan Ortiz, a member of the naval force, was captured by the Uzita. He later escaped to Mocoso, where he lived until rescued by Hernando de Soto's expedition. = Meeting the Timucua = From scout reports, the Timucua knew the Spanish party was nearing their territory. They decided to meet the Europeans as they came near on June 18. Through hand signs and gestures, Narv√°ez communicated to their chief, Dulchanchellin, that they were headed to Apalachee. Dulchanchellin appeared pleased by this (it turned out the Apalachee were his enemies). After the two leaders exchanged gifts, the expedition followed the Timucua into their territory and crossed the Suwannee River. During the crossing, an officer named Juan Vel√°zquez charged into it on his horse, and both drowned. His was the first non-shipwreck casualty of the expedition, and the men were disturbed by his death. The starving army cooked and ate his horse that night. When the Spaniards arrived at the Timucua village on June 19, the chief sent them provisions of maize. That night, an arrow was shot past one of Narv√°ez's men near a watering hole. The next morning, the Spaniards found the natives had deserted the village. They set out again for Apalachee. They soon realized they were being accompanied by hostile natives. Narv√°ez laid a trap for the pursuing natives, and they captured three or four, whom they used as guides. The Spanish had no further contact with those Timucua. = Apalachee = On June 25, 1528, the expedition entered Apalachee territory. Finding a community of forty houses, they thought it was the capital, but it was a small outlying village of a much larger culture. The Spanish attacked, took several hostages including the village's cacique, and occupied the village. Although the villagers had none of the gold and riches Narv√°ez was expecting, they did have much maize. Soon after Narv√°ez took the village, Apalachee warriors began attacking the Europeans. Their first attack was a force of 200 warriors, who used burning arrows to set fire to the houses the Europeans occupied. The warriors quickly dispersed, losing only one man. The next day a second force of 200 warriors, equipped with large bows, attacked from the opposite side of the village. This force also quickly dispersed and lost only one man. After these direct attacks, the Apalachee changed to quick assaults after the Spanish started trekking again. They could fire their bows five or six times while the Spanish loaded a crossbow or harquebus, then fade away into the woods. They harassed the Spanish with guerrilla tactics continuously for the next three weeks. During this time, Narv√°ez sent out three scouting missions in search of larger or wealthier towns. All three came back without good news. Frustrated by misfortune and failing health, Narv√°ez ordered the expedition to head south. The Apalachee and Timucua captives told him that the people of Aute had a great deal of food, and their village was near the sea. The party had to cross a large swamp to reach the place. For the first two days out of the village, the Spaniards were not attacked, but once they were up to their chests in water in the swamp, the Apalachee attacked them with a shower of arrows. Nearly helpless, the Spanish could neither use their horses nor quickly reload their heavy weapons, and they found their armor weighing them down in water. After regaining solid ground, they drove off the attackers. For the next two weeks, they made their difficult way through the swamp, occasionally under attack by the Apalachee. When the Spanish finally reached Aute, they found the village already deserted and burnt. They harvested enough corn, beans, and squash from the garden to feed their party, many of whom were starving, wounded and sick. After two days, Narv√°ez sent Cabeza de Vaca to look for an opening to the sea. He did not find the sea, but after half a day's march along the Wakulla River and St. Marks River, he found shallow, salty water filled with oyster beds. Two more days of scouting produced no better results, and the men returned to tell Narv√°ez the news. Narv√°ez decided to go to the oyster beds for the food. With many of the horses carrying the sick and wounded, the Spanish realized they were struggling for survival. Some considered cannibalism to survive. During the march, some of the caballeros talked about stealing their horses and abandoning everyone else. Although Narv√°ez was too ill to take action, Cabeza de Vaca learned of the plan and convinced them to stay. After a few days stuck near the shallow waters, one man came up with a plan: he suggested reforging their weaponry and armor to make tools and to build new boats to sail to Mexico. The party agreed and started action on August 4, 1528. They constructed a forge out of a log and used deerskins for the bellows. They cut down trees and made charcoal for the forge. Then they made hammers, saws, axes, and nails out of their iron gear. Caulking was made from the pitch of pine trees, and palmetto leaves were used as oakum. They sewed shirts together for sails. Occasionally they raided the Aute village, from which they stole 640 bushels of corn to sustain themselves during the construction. Twice, within sight of the camp, ten men gathering shellfish were killed by Apalachee raids. Narv√°ez expedition in 1528, Apalachee Bay. The men killed their horses for food and material while they were building the boats ‚Äì one horse every three days. They used horsehair to braid rope and the skins for water storage bags. As horses were highly valued by the Spanish, especially the nobility, they named the bay, now known as Apalachee Bay, \\"Bahia de los Caballos\\" in honor of the sacrifice of the animals. By September 20, they had finished building five boats. They sailed on September 22, 1528. After being ravaged by disease, starvation, and attacks by the various peoples they intended to conquer, 242 men had survived. About 50 men were carried by each boat, which were thirty to forty feet long and had a shallow draft, sail, and oars. = South Texas = Closely following the Gulf Coast, the boats proceeded to the west, but frequent storms, thirst and starvation reduced the expedition to about 80 survivors before a hurricane cast Cabeza de Vaca and his remaining men on the western shore of a barrier island. Historians believe they landed at present-day Galveston, Texas. However, other historians have pointed out that there are several inconsistencies between Cabeza de Vaca's description of the island and Galveston Island. As a result, many historians believe that it is more likely that Cabeza de Vaca and his companions actually landed at what is now Follet's Island. For the next four years, Cabeza de Vaca and a steadily dwindling number of his comrades lived in the complex indigenous world of South Texas. = Southwestern North America = By 1532, only four members of the original expedition survived: Alonso del Castillo Maldonado, Andr√©s Dorantes de Carranza, √Ålvar N√∫√±ez Cabeza de Vaca, and Estevanico, an enslaved Moor. They headed west and gradually south hoping to reach the Spanish Empire's outpost in Mexico, becoming the first men of Europe and Africa to enter Southwestern North America (present day Southwestern United States and Northwest Mexico). Their precise route has been difficult for historians to determine, but they apparently traveled across present-day Texas, perhaps into New Mexico and Arizona, and through Mexico's northern provinces near the Pacific Coast before turning inland. In July 1536, near Culiac√°n in present- day Sinaloa, the survivors encountered fellow Spaniards on a slave-taking expedition for New Spain. As Cabeza de Vaca wrote later, his countrymen were \\"dumbfounded at the sight of me, strangely dressed and in the company of Indians. They just stood staring for a long time.\\" The Spaniards accompanied the survivors to Mexico City. Estevanico later served as a guide for other expeditions. Cabeza de Vaca returned to Spain, where he wrote a full account, especially describing the many indigenous peoples they encountered. He later served the colonial government in South America.  Representation in other media  The Moor's Account, a 2014 novel by Laila Lalami, is a fictional memoir of Estebanico, the Moroccan slave who accompanied Cabeza de Vaca as one of the four survivors of the expedition. He is known as the first black explorer of America. Lalami explains that nothing is known about him except for one line in Cabeza de Vaca's chronicle: \\"The fourth [survivor] is Estevanico, an Arab Negro from Azamor.\\"Laila Lalami, The Moor's Account.

Although Cex and Kidwell are frequently used interchangeably, Cex occasionally expands to several people at sporadic points, such as particular tours or albums. In the past it has included Kidwell's musical associates, friends, touring partners, or high school bandmates. History The first Cex album, Cells, was a compilation of tracks Kidwell had been working on for several years, and was released in 1998 by his own CD-R label, _underscore, while he was still at Dulaney High School in Timonium, Maryland. The following year, Kidwell met Miguel Depedro (Kid 606) and the two founded Tigerbeat6, a record label which would be among the vanguards of the electronica movement at the time. The next Cex album, Role Model, was one of the label's first releases (2000), and was quickly followed up the next year with Oops, I Did It Again!. Oops not only took its title from the Britney Spears album of the same name, but played around with the title by depicting photos of the aftermath of a murder on the cover art. All of the Cex releases up to this time were classified as IDM (Intelligent dance music) and had very little vocals or lyrics for the most part. However, Kidwell was not content to stay behind the laptop while on tour, and quickly and openly aspired to become \\"#1 Entertainer\\". He started to hone freestyling skills and performing new songs with vocal tracks like \\"who's the man with no clothes, underwear, fur coat, chilling in the alley?/I'm the man with no clothes, underwear, fur coat/he's brandishing knives!\\" (\\"Fur Coat\\") and \\"I know you're stressed/'cause there's only one Cex/and your girlfriend's pissed/'cause you ain't him\\" (\\"One Cex\\"). His vocal style was very confrontational and nearly atonal, and contained typically outrageous braggadocio; he frequently would go out of his way to chat to his audience between or in the middle of songs, and was known to strip down to his underwear (or less) from time to time. In 2002, he was offered a coveted tour spot opening for the East Coast leg of the Death and Dismemberment tour with Death Cab for Cutie and old friends from Washington, DC The Dismemberment Plan. Also in 2002 he collaborated with Aaron Funk; a Winnipeg electronic artist known as Venetian Snares to create \\"stamina\\" the ninth track on Aaron's '02 album \\"237 0894\\". Later that year, Tall, Dark, and Handcuffed, his first album with full vocals, was released. He continued to open for noted bands such as Super Furry Animals and The Roots, as well as musical friends Grand Buffet. 2003 was a pivotal year for Kidwell - after spending his entire life living in or around Baltimore, he packed up and drove out to Oakland, California. Car malfunctions and a week stranded in the western US became the inspiration for his second album of that year, Maryland Mansions. In April, he gained further exposure opening for indie darlings The Postal Service. Before this, however, he released Being Ridden in both vocal and instrumental form. The album cover paid homage to David Bowie, imitating the cover for \\"Heroes\\". Also notably, the album was not released by Tigerbeat6, and it seemed to have largely abandoned both the IDM and jokey old-school hip-hop of Tall, Dark, and Handcuffed for rawer sounds and themes. Maryland Mansions pushed those motifs further and was modelled somewhat on the Nine Inch Nails EP Broken, and was released just around the time that Kidwell returned to Baltimore. Two music videos for Maryland Mansions were released early in 2004, and Kidwell moved again, to Chicago a few months later. Shortly thereafter, he married Roby Newton (from the band Milemarker), and reorganized Cex as a three-piece: Kidwell, Newton, and Cale Parks (from the bands Joan of Arc and Aloha). This configuration released an EP, Know Doubt, in 2005 on a Chicago label called Record Label. This trio, joined by Portland, OR duo Nice Nice and ex-Dismemberment Plan guitarist Jason Caddell, was featured on the next Cex album, 2006's Actual Fucking, made up of tracks named after and written about various American cities (Baltimore, Los Angeles, Denton, etc.). The album is heavy on vocals and was released by Seattle label Automation Records. In 2007 Kidwell would go on to release an EP entitled Exotical Privates, which involved two different cover images for both CD and an LP. The LP cover was in response to AFI's newly formed electronic project, Blaqk Audio, whose album was named the same as Kidwell's first record, CexCells. The cover features an AFI tattoo on a scrotum. The EP's musical material is made up of a combination of samples from Actual Fucking and Kate Bush. It was released on Automation Records. Kidwell is said to be working on a newly formed side project by the name of Sandcats as well, described as being \\"a solo project for two people\\", his wife and himself. They moved back to Baltimore in 2005. Kidwell would later work in theater. Kidwell made his acting debut in an adaptation of Philip K. Dick's Ubik in 2012. Kidwell predominantly spent 2013 working in theater productions and DJing at clubs in Baltimore. He performed new music as Cex in 2014 that was described as a \\"dramatic change in direction\\".

It was located north across the Allegheny River from downtown Pittsburgh, with its southwest border formed by the Ohio River, and is known today as the North Side. The city's waterfront district, along the Allegheny and Ohio rivers, became Pittsburgh's North Shore neighborhood. The area of Allegheny City included the present Pittsburgh neighborhoods of Allegheny Center, Allegheny West, Brighton Heights, California-Kirkbride, Central Northside, Chateau, East Allegheny, Fineview, Manchester, Marshall-Shadeland, North Shore, Northview Heights, Perry North, Perry South, Spring Garden, Spring Hill‚ÄìCity View, Summer Hill, and Troy Hill.  History  Millvale in yellow, Pittsburgh in red, and parks in green The City of Allegheny was laid out in 1788 according to a plan by John Redick. The lots were sold in Philadelphia by the State government or given as payment to Revolutionary War veterans. It was incorporated as a borough in 1828 and as a city in 1840. Prior to the 1850s, most of the area was still largely farmland, but was subdivided into residential lots, first for the growing German population and later for Croat immigrants. It was commonly referred to as \\"Deutschtown,\\" derived from the German word Deutsch, referring to the language and ethnicity. Allegheny City annexed adjoining municipalities such as the boroughs of Manchester, Spring Garden and Duquesne, and the areas that became Brighton Heights, Observatory Hill, Perry Hilltop, Summer Hill, Spring Hill and Troy Hill.Allegheny City: A History of Pittsburgh‚Äôs North Side, by Dan Rooney and Carol Peterson. University of Pittsburgh Press, 2013. Page 130. Accessed 6 October 2019. The annexation of Allegheny City by Pittsburgh began in 1906 and was effected in 1907, authorized by the U.S. Supreme Court in a landmark decision Hunter v. City of Pittsburgh that year. It was approved by the United States Government in 1911. The annexation was controversial at the time, as an overwhelming majority of Allegheny City residents were opposed to the merger. Previous Pennsylvania law had directed that a majority of the voters in each merging municipality had to approve an annexation agreement. In 1906, the State Assembly passed a new law that authorized annexations if a majority of the total voters in both combined municipalities approved the merger. The annexation was rejected by the residents of Allegheny City by a 2:1 margin, but was approved by much more populous Pittsburgh residents, and the annexation bill passed into law. Allegheny City residents tried unsuccessfully for years to have the annexation overturned in court. The population of Pittsburgh rose from 321,616 in 1900 to 533,905 in 1910, which included the 132,283 who lived in Allegheny in 1910, when the last separate census of Allegheny was taken. When the two cities were joined, both of the old ward systems were discarded. A new ward system was established made up of 27 wards. In the new ward system, Allegheny was divided into wards 21 to 27. Its past territory is easily seen by viewing a map of the city wards. German Catholic Church, Allegheny City, 1857 In the 1960s Pittsburgh undertook a massive urban redevelopment project that demolished the historic core of Allegheny City, leaving only the Commons of Allegheny Center and its surrounding neighborhoods. The Carnegie Library, the Old Post Office Building, and the Buhl Planetarium buildings were not demolished. Major portions of the neighborhoods of Allegheny West, Manchester, Central Northside, California- Kirkbride (Old Allegheny Rows), and East Allegheny are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, including the Mexican War Streets in Central Northside.  Industry  Allegheny was an industrial city and had numerous commercial areas, churches, and social organizations, packing houses, tanneries, soap factories and glue factories that provided opportunities for employment to the primarily German immigrants who settled there. The H.J. Heinz Company built its factory in Allegheny City, close to the Chestnut Street bridge (this has been replaced by the 16th Street Bridge). Heyl & Patterson Inc., a manufacturer of railcar dumpers and ship unloaders, also established a factory in Allegheny City. The surviving structures are now occupied by a furniture warehouse and a bus garage. Exterior, Federal Street Station By the middle of the nineteenth century, the \\"Made in Allegheny\\" label could be found not only on basic iron but on rope, plows, cotton cloth, wool, food, paper, paint, steam engines, wagons and carts, meat, soap, candles, lumber, linseed oil, furniture and a host of other diversified products.Jack McKee, \\"The North Side Story\\", in North Side Directory Chamber of Commerce Members 1960‚Äì61 Railroad lines were built along the north side of the Allegheny for the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago and the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati & St. Louis railroads in Allegheny City. When workers in Pittsburgh struck against the Pennsylvania Railroad after wage cuts in July 1877, railroad workers on these lines also went on strike.Report of the Committee Appointed to Investigate the Railroad Riots in July, 1877, Harrisburg: L.S. Hart, state printer, 1878  Historic places  =Teutonia M√§nnerchor= The Teutonia M√§nnerchor Hall in the East Allegheny (Deutschtown) neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is a building constructed in 1888. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. The Teutonia M√§nnerchor is a private membership club with the purpose of furthering choral singing, German cultural traditions and good fellowship. The club features a number of heritage activities and celebrations, including choral singing in German and folk dancing. =The Priory= The Priory is the name for two historic landmarks ‚Äì the 1852 St. Mary's German Catholic Church and the adjacent 1888 home for Bavarian Benedictine priests and brothers. Once a largely German parish, the church later merged with nearby Italian and Polish congregations. The church and rectory have since closed. The buildings are operated as a banquet hall and a bed-and-breakfast. =Penn Brewery= Although Penn Brewery began in 1987, it is housed in the old Eberhardt & Ober Brewery (1882‚Äì1906) buildings. Penn Brewery makes the award-winning Penn Pilsner and a number of other specialty beers. The \\"tied house\\" (brewery owned restaurant) features a full German menu and live music. =Saint Nicholas Church= Saint Nicholas Croatian Catholic Church, nestled in the hillside above the Allegheny River, was the first Croatian Church built in the United States. The structure was razed in January 2013. =Ridge Avenue Neighborhood= Ridge Avenue, in its heyday between 1890 and 1910, was known as \\"Millionaires' Row\\". After 20 years, the area began to decline as some residents moved further out. The entire North Side community began to fray after having been annexed by Pittsburgh in 1907. =Mexican War Streets= In the late 19th century, Allegheny became known for its stately homes, occupied by some of the area's wealthy families. One such area became known as The Mexican War Streets. The Mexican War Streets were laid out in 1847 by William Robinson Jr., who had earlier been mayor of the city of Allegheny. Robinson, who contrary to some popular tellings did not actually serve in the Mexican War, subdivided his land and named the new streets after the battles and generals (Buena Vista Street, Filson Way, Monterey Street, Palo Alto Street, Resaca Place, Sherman Avenue, Taylor Avenue) of that war. =Carnegie Free Public Libraries= Through his foundation matching fund, Andrew Carnegie contributed to the financing and construction of a Carnegie Free Public Library in Allegheny City. St. Anthony Chapel Built on Troy Hill between 1880 & 1892 by Father Suitbert Mollinger, the chapel houses the largest collection of religious relics outside of the Vatican and features life sized Stations of the Cross statues. =Ball Parks= Allegheny was the location of Exposition Park, the home field of the professional baseball team named the Pittsburgh Pirates (originally called the Pittsburgh Alleghenies and Pittsburgh Innocents). Today, the North Side of Pittsburgh houses PNC Park, home of the Pittsburgh Pirates, and Heinz Field, home of the Pittsburgh Steelers. These facilities replaced Three Rivers Stadium, which was the shared home of both teams. =Felix Brunot Mansion= The Felix Brunot mansion on Stockton Avenue was once used as a station on the Underground Railroad.William J. Switala, Underground Railroad in Pennsylvania Fugitive slaves from the South stopped here for food and shelter. While Pennsylvania was a free state, many slaves continued to Canada to gain more distance from slavecatchers. =Allegheny Observatory= The original Allegheny Observatory was built in 1859 near Perrysville Avenue, by prominent Allegheny citizens who formed the Allegheny Telescope Association. The association donated the observatory to the Western University of Pennsylvania (now the University of Pittsburgh) in 1867, after which it was used for astrophysical, solar, and planetary studies. The observatory maintained a successful subscription time service to railroads via telegraph for many years. A new Allegheny Observatory was built between 1900‚Äì1912 in today's Riverview Park. It is owned and operated by the University of Pittsburgh for education, astronomical research, and public lectures and tours. Notable people * John A.

It was the final step in a design lineage that extended back to the Aero A.11 a decade earlier. A.100s remained in service throughout World War II and for a few years postwar. Design and development Development of the A.100 was in response to a Czechoslovak Air Force requirement of 1932 for a uniform replacement for the A.11s, Aero Ap.32s, and Letov ≈†.16s then in service. Work began with a revision of the Aero A.430 that quickly became quite a different aircraft. Of standard biplane configuration, the A.100 was a somewhat ungainly-looking aircraft which was obsolescent by the time of its first flight in 1933, becoming a member of the final generation of biplane military aircraft to be designed in Europe. Operational history Nevertheless, since the only other competitor for the air force contract, the Praga E.36, had not flown by the close of tenders, the A.100 was ordered for production. A total of 44 were built, in two batches.Sharpe 2000, p. 17. Further development The Aero A.100 was later developed into Aero A.101 with Praga Isotta Fraschini Asso 1000 RV engine (800 h.p.), first flying in December 1934, this type served in the Spanish Civil War curiously on both sides of the conflict. Further development led to Aero Ab.101 (enlarged hull and wings plus Avia Hispano Suiza HS 12 Ydrs engine rated 860 h.p.) produced from 1936 to 1937 and serving in the Czechoslovak Air Force up to its dissolution in March 1939. Final stage of the development was Aero A.104, where Ab.101 was converted to a high-wing monoplane with enclosed cockpit, only one prototype was built in 1937.

History =Hughes's Locomotive & Tramway Engine Works= In 1865, Henry Hughes, who was a timber merchant engineer, began building horse-drawn tramcars and railway rolling stock at the Falcon Works in Loughborough. His first company was known as the Hughes's Locomotive & Tramway Engine Works Ltd. Records are very sparse, but it seems that he began producing steam locomotives about 1867 for the Paris Exhibition. His main business, however, was tram engines, lightweight steam engines (usually with condensers) which drew passenger cars, made possible by the Tramways Act 1870. Among these was \\"The Pioneer\\" for the Swansea and Mumbles Railway. These were distinct from those tramcars where the boiler mechanism was an integral part of the passenger car. Amongst the first steam locomotives built there was \\"Belmont\\", which ran on the Snailbeach District Railways, and three gauge 0-4-0STs for the Corris Railway supplied in 1878. The Corris locomotives are said to have been works numbers 322, 323 and 324, implying that the tram vehicles and steam locomotives were included in a single numerical sequence. In 1881 Hughes' built two gauge 0-4-0STs for the Liverpool Corporation Waterworks Committee for use in the construction of the waterworks at Lake Vyrnwy in Wales. In 1881 the company ran into legal problems and in 1882 it was in receivership. Hughes departed, soon after, for New Zealand, where in collaboration with local engineer E.W Mills, he built small tramway engines. =Falcon Engine & Car Works= Works plate on Beira Railway BR7 4-4-0Late in 1882 the company reformed as the Falcon Engine & Car Works Ltd. and supplied three more locomotives of the same design for the railways at Vyrnwy. Again there are few records, but the factory remained busy with both railway and tramway locomotives and rolling stock. Among these were tank locomotives for Ireland, Spain and the Azores. Some were subcontracts from other firms, such as Kerr Stuart, at that time, in Glasgow. =Brush Electrical Engineering Company= In 1889, the assets were acquired by the London-based Anglo- American Brush Electric Light Corporation, which moved the 100 miles north into the Falcon Works at Loughborough, under the new name, Brush Electrical Engineering Company Limited. de Havilland DH.89 Dominie built by Brush in April 1945 for the RAF First Great Western 47815 Abertawe Landore in June 2004 Between 1901 and 1905 the Brushmobile electric car was developed using a Vauxhall Motors engine, although only six were built. One of these six featured in the film Carry On Screaming. Nearly 100 buses, plus some lorries were built using French engines until 1907. Brush Electrical Engineering also built some carriages that were used in the 1900s on the Central London Railway and the City and South London Railway, the respective forerunners of London Underground's Central and Northern lines. In all, about 250 steam locomotives were built in addition to the tram engines. Production finished after World War I and the company concentrated on transport-related electrical equipment, including tramcars, trolleybuses and battery-operated vehicles. In World War II Brush Coachworks diversified into aircraft production, building 335 de Havilland Dominies for the Royal Air Force and Fleet Air Arm. Wing sections were built for Lancaster bombers and Hampden fuselages were overhauled.Jarram, A P. Brush Aircraft Production at Loughborough. Midland Counties Publications, 1978 The coachworks continued after the war with omnibus bodies mounted on Daimler chassis using Gardner five-cylinder diesel engines and Daimler preselector gearboxes as well as AEC and BMMO Chassis for Midland Red and 100 Leyland Titans for Birmingham City Transport as well as bodies to the design of the British Electric Traction group on Leyland Royal Tigers. In 1952 the coachworks were closed and the goodwill and patents were bought by neighbouring Willowbrook. =Brush Bagnall Traction= Close to Derby and its railway workshops, it retained its contacts with the railway. Acquired by Heenan & Froude in 1947, it was merged with W. G. Bagnall to produce diesel locomotives. In 1951, the company Brush Bagnall Traction Limited was formed. When British Railways began to replace its fleet of steam engines, Brush entered the market for main line diesel-electric locomotives. =Brush Traction= In 1957, the Brush group were bought up by Hawker Siddeley. As part of Hawker Siddeley Electric Power Group, it then passed to BTR plc and became Brush Traction. Later it became part of FKI Energy Technologies, itself purchased in 2008 by Melrose plc). On 28 February 2011, Wabtec announced it would purchase Brush Traction for US$31 million. The locomotive works are still occupied by the Brush Traction Company and are in use for the building, overhaul and repair of locomotives.

Morrisons produced a 3-wheeled design, which Brush then used to manufacture a number of units for internal use. Subsequently, they began selling them on the open market and shipped a large order to Russia in 1941. They added battery electric road vehicles to their product list in 1945, buying the designs and manufacturing rights from Metropolitan Vickers, so that early Brush vehicles are almost indistinguishable from late Metro-Vicks. 3-wheeled vehicles were marketed as the Brush Pony, and they also produced 4-wheeled vehicles. In 1948 they added a 2-ton chassis to their range, which could be supplied with a large van, standard van, flat truck or milk float body. The welded box-section chassis was fitted with semi-elliptic springs and a Lockheed hydraulic braking system. The 36-cell 290 Ahr battery was mounted on both sides of the central spine. The electric motor was connected to a banjo-type rear axle by a Layrub propellor shaft. In common with other Brush vehicles, control was by a double- depression foot pedal, where the first depression gave two stages of control with the two-halves of the battery connected in parallel, and the second depression gave a further two stages with the batteries in series. In early 1949, they reduced the prices of their electric vehicles by around 25 per cent, in an attempt to make them more competitive with petrol vehicles. The models affected were the 10-14 cwt chassis and the 18-22 cwt chassis, and they were hoping to see a five-fold increase in sales. Sales of their industrial electric truck had trebled between 1947 and 1948. All of their road vehicles were sold through the motor trade, in order to achieve a good standard of after-sales service. In 1949, they offered 25 standard bodies for their chassis, including a mobile canteen or ice cream parlour, which they exhibited at the Dairy Show that year. The vehicle had a top speed of 16 mph, and a range of 28 miles, based on eight stops per mile. Production of 4-wheeled battery electrics ceased in 1950, although the company continued to manufacture the 3-wheeled Brush Pony milk float and their range of industrial trucks. They maintained enough spare parts to allow them to service 4-wheeled vehicles for a further 10 years and sold the remainder to Hindle, Smart and Co of Manchester, who made Helecs milk floats. In 1972, Hawker Siddeley bought a 50 per cent share in Crompton Leyland Electricars Ltd (CLE), from British Leyland. CLE was the manufacturer of Morrison-Electricar milk floats, and at this point Hawker Siddeley owned Brush, R A Lister and Company, based in Dursley, Gloucestershire and Brook Victor Electric Vehicles, based in Huddersfield, Yorkshire, all of which were producing electric vehicles. In order to rationalise their operations, construction of Brush industrial trucks was transferred to the Morrison-Electricar factory in Tredegar. Although most of the vehicles involved were industrial trucks, the 3-wheeled Brush Pony milk float was also included, and a number of these were subsequently manufactured at Tredegar. Also included was the SD tractor, which was still selling well, and included a drive unit which had originally been designed for Brush by Morrisons in 1940. An early Brush Pony 3-wheeled milk float, formerly operated by United Dairies and dating from 1947, is on display at the National Motor Museum, Beaulieu. A Brush 10/14 cwt Mark II bread van, also dating from 1947, and formerly owned by the Co-operative Wholesale Society, can be seen at The Transport Museum, Wythall. The Ipswich Transport Museum has a Brush Pony electric laundry van dating from 1967 in their collection.

In Azzam, Abdullah Yusuf. Defenceof the Muslim Lands: The First Obligation after Iman . Trans. Azzam is described by most of his biographers as being exceptionally intelligent as a child. He liked to read, excelled in class, and studied topics above his grade level. In the mid-1950s, Azzam joined the Muslim Brotherhood after being influenced by Shafiq Asad \`Abd al-Hadi, an elderly local teacher who was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. Recognizing Azzam's sharp mind, Shafiq Asad gave Azzam a religious education and introduced him to many of the Muslim Brotherhood's leaders in Palestine. Azzam became more interested in Islamic studies and started a study group in his village. Shafiq Asad then introduced Azzam to Muhammad \`Abd ar-Rahman Khalifa, the Muraqib \`Am (General Supervisor) of the Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan. Khalifa met with Azzam during several visits that he made to Silat al- Harithiya. During this part of his life, Azzam began reading the works of Hasan al-Banna and other Muslim Brotherhood writings. In the late 1950s, after he had completed his elementary and secondary education, Azzam left Silat al- Harithiya and enrolled in the agricultural Khaduri College in Tulkarm, about 30 kilometres southwest of his village. Though he was a year younger than his classmates, he received good grades. After graduation from the college, students were sent out to teach at local schools. Azzam was sent to the village of Adir, near the town of Kerak in central Jordan. According to one of his biographers, Azzam had wanted a position closer to home, but was sent to a distant school after an argument with his college's dean. After spending a year in Adir, Azzam returned to the West Bank, where he taught at a school in the village of Burqin, about four kilometers west of Jenin. His colleagues in Burqin remembered him as being noticeably more religious than them. During breaks, while others ate, Azzam would sit and read the Quran. Religious studies in Damascus In 1963, Azzam enrolled in the Faculty of Sharia at the University of Damascus in Syria. While in Damascus, he met Islamic scholars and leaders including Shaykh Muhammad Adib Salih, Shaykh Sa\`id Hawwa, Shaykh Mohamed Said Ramadan Al-Bouti, Mullah Ramadan al-Buti, and Shaykh Marwan Hadid. Azzam's mentor, Shafiq Asad \`Abd al-Hadi died in 1964. This strengthened Azzam's determination in working for the cause of Islam. During the holidays, Azzam would return to his village, where he would teach and preach in the mosque. Azzam graduated with highest honors in 1966, receiving a Bachelor of Arts in Sharia. Thereafter he returned to the West Bank, where he taught and preached in the region around his village. After the 1967 Six-Day War ended with the Israeli military occupation of the West Bank, Azzam and his family left the West Bank and followed the Palestinian exodus to Jordan. In Jordan and Egypt In Jordan, Azzam participated in paramilitary operations against the Israeli occupation but became disillusioned with the secular and provincial nature of the Palestinian resistance coalition held together under the umbrella of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and led by Yasser Arafat. Instead of pursuing the PLO's Marxist-oriented national liberation struggle supported by the Soviet Union, Azzam envisioned a pan-Islamic trans- national movement that would transcend the political map of the Middle East drawn by European colonial powers.Defence of the Muslim Lands; The First Obligation After Iman; Biography of Abdullah Azzam and Introduction, by Abdullah Azzam (Shaheed), English translation work done by Brothers in Ribatt.religioscope.com In Egypt Azzam continued his studies at the prestigious Al-Azhar University, getting a PhD in Principles of Islamic Jurisprudence in 1973, while being acquainted during his stay with the ideas of Sayyid Qutb.Andrew McGregor, \\"\\"Jihad and the Rifle Alone\\": 'Abdullah 'Azzam and the Islamist Revolution\\" in Journal of Conflict Studies, Vol. XXIII, No. 2 Fall 2003 He completed his 600-page doctoral thesis in around 16 months.Tam Hussein (12 February 2020), \\"The Caravan: Abdallah Azzam and the Rise of Global Jihad\\", al-Araby. Retrieved 13 February 2020. Some researchers believe he had a role as an ideologist in founding the Islamist Hamas movement in Palestine. In Saudi Arabia Azzam took a position as lecturer at King Abdul Aziz University in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, where he remained until 1979. He was also known as Shaikh Abdullah due to his seniority and his aspirations to become UH NSU. Osama bin Laden was enrolled as a student in the university between 1976 and 1981 and probably first met Azzam during that time.Letter From Jedda, Young Osama, How he learned radicalism, and may have seen America, by Steve Coll, The New Yorker Fact, Issue of 2005-12-12, Posted 2005-12-05 =Support for Afghan mujahideen= When the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979, Azzam issued a fatwa, Defence of the Muslim Lands, the First Obligation after Faith declaring that both the Afghan and Palestinian struggles were jihads in which killing occupiers of your land was a personal obligation for all Muslims. The edict was supported by Saudi Arabia's Grand Mufti, Abd al-Aziz Bin Baz. In Pakistan in 1980, Azzam began to teach at International Islamic University, Islamabad. Soon thereafter, he moved from Islamabad to Peshawar, closer to the Afghan border, where he then established Maktab al-Khadamat (Services Office) to organize guest houses in Peshawar and paramilitary training camps in Afghanistan to prepare international recruits for the Afghan war front. An estimated 16,000 to 35,000 Muslim volunteers from around the world came to fight in Afghanistan.Rashid, Ahmed, Taliban: Militant Islam, Oil and Fundamentalism in Central Asia (New Haven, 2000), p. 129. Thousands more Muslims attended \\"frontier schools teeming with former and future fighters.\\" From there, Azzam was able to organize resistance directly on the Afghan frontier. Peshawar is only 15 km east of the historic Khyber Pass, through the Safed Koh mountains, connected to the southeastern edge of the Hindu Kush range. This route became the major avenue for inserting foreign fighters and material support into eastern Afghanistan for the resistance against the Soviets. After Osama bin Laden graduated from the university in Jeddah in 1981, he also lived for a time in Peshawar; Azzam convinced bin Laden to help personally finance the training of recruits.Rahimullah Yusufzai, executive editor of the English-language daily The News International, in a statement to Reuters in Peshawar on 29 December 2001. Yusufzai met bin Laden twice in Afghanistan in 1998. Some have suggested that Mohammed Atef was responsible for convincing Azzam to abandon his academic pursuits to devote himself solely to preaching jihad.Raman, B. South Asia Analysis Group, USA's Afghan Ops , November 20, 2001 Through al-Khadamat, bin Laden's fortune paid for air tickets and accommodation, dealt with paperwork with Pakistani authorities and provided other such services for the jihad fighters. To keep al-Khadamat running, bin Laden set up a network of couriers travelling between Afghanistan and Peshawar, which continued to remain active after 2001, according to Rahimullah Yusufzai, executive editor of The News International. After orientation and training, Muslim recruits volunteered for service with various Afghan militias tied to Azzam. In 1984, Osama bin Laden founded Bait ul-Ansar (House of Helpers) in Peshawar to expand Azzam's ability to support \\"Afghan Arab\\" jihad volunteers and, later, to create his own independent militia. In 1988, Azzam convinced Ahmed Khadr to raise funds for an alleged new charity named al-Tahaddi based in Peshawar. He granted Khadr a letter of commendation to take back to Canadian mosques, calling for donations. However, the pair had a sensationalist showdown when Khadr insisted that he had a right to know how the money would be spent, and Azzam's supporters labelled Khadr a Western spy. A Sharia court was convened in bin Laden's compound, and Azzam was found guilty of spreading allegations against Khadr, though no sentence was imposed.Michelle Shephard, \\"Guantanamo's Child\\", 2008. Employing tactics of asymmetric warfare, the Afghan resistance movement was able to fend off the Soviet Union's superior military forces throughout most of the war, although the lightly armed Afghan mujahideen suffered enormous casualties. The Saudi Arabian government and the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) gradually increased financial and military assistance to the Afghan mujahideen forces throughout the 1980s in an effort to stem Soviet expansionism and to destabilize the Soviet Union. Azzam frequently joined Afghan militias and international Muslim units as they battled the Soviet Union's forces in Afghanistan. He sought to unify elements of the resistance by resolving conflicts between mujahideen commanders and he became an inspirational figure among the Afghan resistance and freedom-fighting Muslims worldwide for his passionate attachment to jihad against foreign occupation. In the 1980s, Azzam travelled throughout the Middle East, Europe and North America, including 50 cities in the United States, to raise money and preach about jihad. He inspired young Muslims with stories of miraculous deeds, mujahideen who defeated vast columns of Soviet troops virtually single-handed, who had been run over by tanks but survived, who were shot but unscathed by bullets. Angels were witnessed riding into battle on horseback, and falling bombs were intercepted by birds, which raced ahead of the jets to form a protective canopy over the warriors.\\"Miracles of jihad in Afghanistan ‚Äì Abdullah Azzam\\", archive.org, Edited by A.B. al-Mehri, AL AKTABAH BOOKSELLERS AND PUBLISHERS, Birmingham ‚Äì Englandexamples can be found in \\"The Signs of ar-Rahmaan in the Jihad of the Afghan,\` www.Islamicawakening.com/viewarticle.php?articleID=877& accessed 2006 and Abdullah Yusuf Azzam, \\"Abul-Mundhir ash-Shareef,\\" www.islamicawakening.com/viewarticle.php?articleID=30& accessed 2006 Steven Emerson's 1994 television documentary Terrorists Among Us: Jihad in America, includes an excerpt from a video of Abdullah Azzam, in which he exhorts his audience to wage jihad in America (which Azzam explains \\"means fighting only, fighting with the sword\\"), and his cousin, Fayiz Azzam, says \\"Blood must flow. There must be widows; there must be orphans.\\" =Global Jihad= Azzam's trademark slogan was \\"Jihad and the rifle alone: no negotiations, no conferences and no dialogues.\\" In Join the Caravan, Azzam implored Muslims to rally in defense of Muslim victims of aggression, to restore Muslim lands from foreign domination, and to uphold the Muslim faith.Join the Caravan, by Imam Abdullah Azzam, Downloaded from the website www.al-haqq.org in December 2001 He emphasized the violence of religion, preaching that, \\"those who believe that Islam can flourish [and] be victorious without Jihad, fighting, and blood are deluded and have no understanding of the nature of this religion.\\" Azzam has been criticized for justifying the killing of civilians deemed mushrikeen (polytheists) in jihad, telling followers that: > Many Muslims know about the hadith in which the Prophet ordered his > companions not to kill any women or children, etc., but very few know that > there are exceptions to this case. In summary, Muslims do not have to stop > an attack on mushrikeen, if non-fighting women and children are present. Given the broad definition of mushrikeen used by some Muslims, at least one author (Dore Gold) has wondered if this could have led to followers being less concerned about killing women and children. However, Azzam's son, Huthaifa Azzam, has told journalist Henry Schuster that his father did not generally approve of attacks on civilians. Azzam built a scholarly, ideological and practical paramilitary infrastructure for the globalization of Islamist movements that had previously focused on separate national, revolutionary and liberation struggles. Azzam's philosophical rationalization of global jihad and practical approach to recruitment and training of Muslim militants from around the world blossomed during the Afghan war against Soviet occupation and proved crucial to the subsequent development of the al-Qaida militant movement. In 1989, after the Soviets pulled out of Afghanistan, Azzam and his deputy Osama bin Laden decided to keep their movement permanent and founded al-Qaeda. Like earlier influential Islamist Sayyid Qutb, Azzam urged the creation of a \\"pioneering vanguard\\", as the core of a new Islamic society. \\"This vanguard constitutes the solid base [qaeda in Arabic] for the hoped-for society. ... We shall continue the jihad no matter how long the way, until the last breath and the last beat of the pulse ‚Äì or until we see the Islamic state established.\\"\\"The Solid Base\\" (Al-Qaeda), Al-Jihad (journal), April 1988, n.41 From its victory in Afghanistan jihad would liberate Muslim land (or land where Muslims form a minority in the case of the Philippines or formerly Muslim land in the case of Spain) ruled by unbelievers: the southern Soviet Republics of Central Asia, Bosnia, the Philippines, Kashmir, Somalia, Eritrea, and Spain. He believed the natural place to continue the jihad was his birthplace, Palestine. Azzam planned to train brigades of Hamas fighters in Afghanistan, who would then return to carry on the battle against Israel.\\"Wright, Lawrence, Looming Tower: Al Qaeda and the Road to 9/11, by Lawrence Wright, New York, Knopf, 2006, p.130 He viewed Hamas as \\"the spearhead in the religious confrontation between Muslims and Jews in Palestine\\". During the First Intifada, he supported ·∏§amas politically, financially and logistically from his base in Pakistan. This put him at odds with another influential faction of the Afghan Arabs the Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ) and its leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri. The next group of \\"unbelievers\\" the EIJ wanted to jihad against were the self-professed Muslims of the Egyptian government and other secular Muslim governments, not Israeli Jews, European Christians or Indian Hindus. For the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, takfir against the allegedly impious Egyptian government was central,Sageman, Marc, Understanding Terror Networks by Marc Sageman, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2004, p.37 but Azzam opposed takfir of Muslims, including takfir of Muslim governments, which he believed spread fitna and disunity within the Muslim community. Assassination In 1989, a first attempt on his life failed, when a lethal amount of TNT explosive placed beneath the pulpit from which he delivered the sermon every Friday failed to detonate. The Arab mosque was in the University Town neighbourhood in western Peshawar, in Gulshan Iqbal Road. Abdullah Azzam used the mosque as the jihad center, according to a Reuters inquiry in the neighbourhood. Had the bomb exploded, it would reportedly have destroyed the mosque and killed everybody inside it.Profiles of Ash Shuhadaa, ABDULLAH AZZAM, Ummah Forum, posted 07-04-2002, 02:44 AM On 24 November 1989, Muhammad Azzam was driving his father and brother to Friday prayers in Peshawar, when unknown assassins detonated a bomb as the vehicle approached. Lying in a narrow street across from a gas station, the explosive had a 50-metre detonation cord which led to the sewerage system where the assailant presumably waited.Jihad magazine, \\"Bloody Friday\\", Issue 63, January 1990 According to Time magazine, Waheed Muzhda had noticed what he assumed was a crew doing routine road maintenance working on the culvert where the bomb was placed, the day before the assassination. Azzam and his sons were buried near the same site as his mother the year before, the Pabi Graveyard of the Shuhadaa' (martyrs), in Peshawar. =Suspects= Suspects in the assassination include competing Islamic militia leaders, such as Osama bin Laden, as well as the CIA and Mossad.Peter L. Bergen, The Osama bin Laden I Know, New York: Free Press, 2006, p.97 Former FBI agent Ali Soufan mentioned in his book, The Black Banners, that Ayman al-Zawahiri is suspected of being behind the assassination. Azzam's son-in-law, Abdullah Anas, accused the Egyptian Islamic Jihad of killing his father-in-law for issuing a fatwa that \\"once the Russian were ejected from Afghanistan, it would not be permissible for us to take sides.\\" Several associates of Azzam suspect the killing was part of a purge of those who favored moving the jihad to Palestine. In March 1991, Mustapha Shalabi, who ran the Maktab al-Khidmat, the Services Bureau in New York and was also \\"said to prefer a 'Palestine next' strategy, turned up dead in his apartment.\\" He was replaced by Wadih el-Hage, who later became bin Laden's personal secretary.The Age of Sacred Terror, by Daniel Benjamin and Steven Simon, Random House, c2002, p.104 Osama bin Laden has also been accused of being a suspect in the murder, but seems to have remained on good terms with Azzam during this time.Wright, Lawrence, Looming Tower: Al Qaeda and the Road to 9/11, by Lawrence Wright, New York, Knopf, 2006, p.143 However, it was reported that Bin Laden and Azzam also had a major dispute on where Al Qaeda should focus their operations. Bin Laden favored using the organization to train fighters in various parts of the world while Azzam favored keeping the training camps in Afghanistan. Yet another actor accused of the hit is the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence,The Iranian Intelligence Services and the War On Terror By Mahan Abedin an active opponent of Wahhabism. In 2009, Jordanian double agent Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi claimed knowledge of Jordanian General Intelligence Directorate cooperation with the CIA to set up the assassination. Legacy After his death, Azzam's militant ideology and related paramilitary manuals were promoted through print and Internet media by Azzam Publications,which described itself as \\"an independent media organisation providing authentic news and information about Jihad and the Foreign Mujahideen everywhere.\\" a publishing house that operated from a London post office boxAzzam Publications‚ÄîBMC UHUD, LONDON, WC1N 3XX and an Internet site. Both were shut down shortly after the September 11 attacks and are no longer active, though mirror sites persisted for some time afterwards. Babar Ahmad, the administrator of azzam.com, was extradicted from the UK to the USA where he pleaded guilty to \\"conspiracy and providing material support to terrorism.\\" Azzam popularized the idea of armed Islamic struggle (which went on to be developed further by groups such as the Armed Islamic Group of Algeria (GIA)). Prior to his work, declarations of jihad in the twentieth century (such as against Israel) were essentially rhetorical and served more as a religious blessing of wars already declared and organized by secular bodies. But with his tireless travel and exhortation of activists, thousands of whom traveled to be trained and to fight in Afghanistan, what Azzam \\"called for actually came about\\". Azzam also broadened the idea of jihad. Azzam preached that jihad was * the transcendent in importance ‚Äì 'one hour in the path of jihad is worth more than 70 years of praying at home'; * and had global significance ‚Äì 'if a piece of Muslim land the size of a hand-span is infringed upon, then jihad becomes fard \`ayn [a personal obligation] on every Muslim male and female, where the child shall march forward without the permission of its parents and the wife without the permission of the husband' Azzam had considerable impact. Fatwas going back to the Crusades had urged Muslims to defend one another against an invasion, but his contention that \\"such defense was a global obligation,\\" that \\"Muslims everywhere were personally bound to take up arms\\" against invasions such as the Soviet's, was \\"all but unprecedented\\". Azzam is thought to have had influence on jihadists such as al-Qaeda with the third stage of his \\"four-stage process of jihad\\". This third stage was \\"ribat,\\" defined as \\"placing oneself at the frontlines where Islam was under siege\\". This idea is thought to reinforce militants' \\"perception of a civilizational war between Islam and the West\\". His son Huthaifa Azzam, who assumes his father's legacy, on the other hand, says that al-Qaeda's methods of targeting civilians in the West or elsewhere would have been rebuked by Azzam, as would have been the use of kidnappings and beheadings.Mary Fitzgerald (7 July 2006), \\"The son of the father of jihad\\", The Irish Times.

They are the ones with the most power in the team and their most important job is to bring runs in, the cleanup hitter ‚Äúcleans up the bases‚Äù meaning that if there are runners on the bases the cleanup hitter scores them in ergo the name. There is much theory on how a coach sets up his lineup card before the game in order to maximize the effectiveness of his players during the game.  Theory  The theory behind the use of the cleanup hitter is that at least one of the batters before him should reach a base in any way possible, usually being a walk or a base hit. The batters in the beginning of the lineup have a variety of different traits but traditionally the lead off hitter which sits at the number one spot has speed, plate discipline, and high on-base percentage. The second batter is usually a contact hitter, meaning they are able to consistently make contact with the ball and put it in play by any means possible to move the runner up and into scoring position. It is a possibility for the first or second batter to bunt their way on base because they both should have good speed. The third batter is usually the best all-around batter that tends to have the highest batting average and has the role of scoring runs himself, but ultimately the job comes down to getting on base for the cleanup hitter to have a turn to bat in the same inning. Now with cleanup hitter coming up to hit if he has runners on base he has a chance to produce runs by getting a hit or by using their power they can hit a home run or an extra base hit. It is often found that the 3rd and 4th batter can switch roles in a game because of the ability of the 3rd batter to also produce runs. The 5th batter in the lineup also has a small responsibility of pushing in runs so he acts like a backup for the cleanup hitter in case he doesn't get the job done. He shares multiple traits with the cleanup hitter therefore can also compete for the spot on the lineup to become a cleanup hitter. After that batters from 6 to 9 descend by their skill level meaning the 9th batter has a tendency of being the worst batter.  Trends  Each individual hitter's reoccurring tendencies and strengths in recent performances determine their spot on the daily lineup card. As the #4 hitter's primary responsibility is to turn baserunners into runs batted in (RBIs), a hitter with a high slugging percentage and batting average, especially with runners in scoring position, is generally preferred to the higher on-base percentage (OBP) and low strikeout rates of hitters earlier in the lineup. A manager may also take into account a batters tendency to hit in clutch situations or focus on home run ability. Since the home run is by far the most sure-fire method of batting in baserunners, the annual Home Run Derby tends to be a who's who of cleanup hitters from around the league. That being said, a hitter with an unspectacular home run rate who is instead reliable when it comes to extra- base hits can also be a valuable tool for scoring with runners in scoring position (RISP). It is ultimately a question of how well a player fits into the rest of the lineup which determines the run-scoring potential of the #4 spot.  American League vs. National League  There are two leagues in North American Major League Baseball, the American league and the National League. A key difference between the two is that the American League has a designated hitter (DH). The DH is a batter that hits for the pitcher and never plays defense. Meanwhile, the National League demands that the pitcher hit in the lineup unless another player pinch hits for the pitcher, in which case the pitcher must leave the game and must be replaced for the team's next defensive half-inning. The DH is important in the American league because it is usually one of the better hitters. It is a trend that the DH is either in the 3rd, 4th, or 5th spot in the lineup. This is taken away when there are interleague games when the National League is the home team, so the American League team does not use a DH, and their pitchers take their turn at bat.  Examples  = Current = There are many examples of batters that have excelled in the cleanup spot of the lineup. These batters have left a mark on contemporary baseball and helped it evolve into the game it is now. One example of a cleanup hitter is Albert Pujols. He is considered as a candidate for baseball's hall of fame due to his immense contributions to his team as a cleanup hitter. Albert is also known as ‚ÄúThe Machine‚Äù which originated due to his power and runs batted in (RBI) statistics. He has bounced around between the three spot and the four spot as a hitter in his career. He currently plays for the Los Angeles Angels and was recently demoted to DH in the cleanup spot. = Clean Up Batter Examples = Here is a small list of more Cleanup Batters that have made a name for themselves due to their role as a clean up hitter and strong offensive force for their team: Buster Posey Reggie Jackson Edgar Martinez David Ortiz (Big Papi) Evan Longoria Babe Ruth Mark McGwire Lou Gehrig Evan Gattis Mike Napoli Adam Jones Jed Lowrie Kent Hrbek Yoenis Cespedes References Batting (baseball) Baseball terminology ","title":"Cleanup hitter"},{"id":"992211","text":"IC 4665 (Collinder 349 / Melotte 179) is an open cluster in the constellation Ophiuchus.

In 1943, towards the end of his time as an undergraduate at St John's College, Oxford, he wrote several works of fiction, verse and critical commentary under that name, including homoerotic stories that parody the style of popular writers of contemporary girls' school fiction. The Coleman oeuvre consists of a completed novella, Trouble at Willow Gables, set in a girls' boarding school; an incomplete sequel, Michaelmas Term at St Brides, set in a women's college at Oxford; seven short poems with a girls' school ambience; a fragment of pseudo- autobiography; and a critical essay purporting to be Coleman's literary apologia. The manuscripts were stored in the Brynmor Jones Library at the University of Hull, where Larkin was chief librarian between 1955 and 1985. Their existence was revealed to the public when Larkin's Selected Letters and Andrew Motion's biography were published in 1992 and 1993 respectively. The Coleman works themselves were finally published, with other Larkin drafts and oddments, in 2002. At Oxford Larkin underwent a period of confused sexuality and limited literary output. The adoption of a female persona appeared to release his creativity, as in the three years following the Coleman phase he published under his own name two novels and his first poetry collection. Thereafter, although he gradually established his reputation as a poet, his career as a prose writer declined, and despite several attempts he completed no further fiction. Critical reaction to the publication of the Coleman material was divided between those who saw no value in these juvenilia, and those who considered that they cast useful light on the study of the mature Larkin. Origins The quadrangle, St John's College, Oxford In October 1940 Philip Larkin began studying English at St John's College, Oxford.Motion, p. 72 A prolific writer since childhood, his primary ambition as an undergraduate was to be a novelist rather than a poet.Booth, p. vii As well publishing articles and poems in Cherwell and Oxford Poetry, he wrote additional unpublished material that included fragments of semi-autobiographical stories exploring homosexual relationships among groups of undergraduates. According to Larkin's biographer Andrew Motion these writings, while of no literary value, give an indication of Larkin's confused sexuality at that time, and his growing distaste for what he terms \\"this buggery business\\".Motion, pp. 64‚Äì65 From 1942 the character of much of Larkin's private writing changed, as a result of his friendship with a fellow undergraduate from St John's, Kingsley Amis, who arrived at the university that summer.Motion, pp. 53‚Äì54 Amis, a much more confident and assertive character than Larkin, disguised his serious concerns behind a facade of jokes and comic ironies. Larkin soon adopted that style as his own, joining with Amis in composing obscene rhymes and parodies of the Romantic poets they were required to study.Motion, p. 58 In time they extended their efforts to soft-porn fantasies in which, typically, \\"girls roll[ed] around together twanging elastic and straps\\".Motion, pp. 86‚Äì87 After Amis's departure for the army in early 1943, Larkin made his first attempt at writing from a specifically feminine perspective in a story called \\"An Incident in the English Camp\\", which he subtitled \\"A Thoroughly Unhealthy Story\\". Lacking any salacious content despite its subtitle, the work is written in a pastiche of sentimental women's magazine prose. It depicts an undergraduate girl's parting from her soldier lover, and ends: \\"She walked in exaltation through the black streets, her heart glowing like a coal with deep love\\".Booth, pp. viii‚Äìix Writing From his general reading, Larkin had acquired a considerable knowledge of girls' school fiction, and had formed definite views on the authors of such works: \\"stupid women without a grain of humour in their minds\\", who lacked \\"erotic sensibility\\" and treated the lesbian perspective \\"too casually\\".Booth, pp. xii‚Äìxiii His intention to write in this genre is expressed in a letter to his friend Norman Iles, dated 5 June 1943, just before Larkin sat his degree Finals: \\"I am spending my time doing an obscene Lesbian novel in the form of a school story\\".Thwaite, p. 58 The novel was Trouble at Willow Gables, a school adventure story in the manner of Dorita Fairlie Bruce or Dorothy Vicary, which Larkin completed at home while awaiting his Finals results. That was the prelude to a busy summer's writing: \\"Leaving Oxford was like taking a cork out of a bottle. Writing flooded out of me\\", Larkin later told his biographer.Motion, p. 106 Larkin's letter to Iles does not mention a female pseudonym, although the idea of using one had been in his mind for months. The previous March he had begun writing the imagined autobiography of a supposed lady novelist, \\"Brunette Coleman\\", adapting the name of a well-known contemporary female jazz musician, Blanche Coleman. Larkin tentatively titled the autobiography \\"Ante Meridian\\"; he soon abandoned it, but held on to the Coleman name. According to James Booth, who prepared the Coleman texts for publication in 2002, the adoption of a female persona was in line with the pose of \\"girlish narcissism\\" that Larkin was affecting in the summer of 1943: \\"I am dressed in red trousers, shirt and white pullover, and look very beautiful\\".Booth, p. xii In his letters to Amis, Larkin maintained a straight-faced pretence that Coleman was a real person. Thus in one letter he wrote \\"Brunette is very thrilled\\" with a poem written in her name, and in another, \\"Brunette can stand healthy criticism\\".Thwaite, pp. 66 and 69 As he waited for offers of employment through the summer and autumn of 1943, Larkin added more works to the Coleman oeuvre. He began a sequel to Trouble at Willow Gables, set in a women's college at Oxford and entitled Michaelmas Term at St Bride's, but did not finish it: \\"All literary inspiration has deserted me\\", he informed Amis on 13 August.Thwaite, p. 62 Nevertheless, a week later he told Amis that Brunette was helping him to write a novel, provisionally entitled Jill, about \\"a young man who invents an imaginary sister, and falls in love with her\\". With this letter Larkin sent a Coleman poem, \\"Bliss\\", the first of seven written in the girls' school idiom.Thwaite, p. 63 As late as 19 October he reported to Amis that \\"Brunette is working on a little monograph about girls' school stories\\".Thwaite, p. 80 This is a reference to the putative literary manifesto \\"What Are We Writing For\\", which became the final Coleman work. Thereafter, Motion records, she disappeared, \\"to be mentioned only fleetingly in later accounts of his university life ... She ended up as an occasional comic reminder of lost youth\\".Motion, p. 101 Works The works which Larkin attributed to Brunette Coleman comprise a short piece of supposed autobiography, a complete short novel, an incomplete second novel, a collection of poems and a literary essay. =\\"Ante Meridian\\"= This fragment of spoof autobiography is distinct from the rest of the Coleman oeuvre in having no relation to girls' school fiction. It records Brunette's early life as the daughter of an eccentric priest, brought up in a tumbledown Cornish cliff-top house. Apart from descriptions of the house and its contents (some of which may be drawn from Larkin's own childhood home in Coventry),Bradford, pp. 52‚Äì55 much of the narrative is taken up with a comical description of an attempt to launch the local lifeboat. Larkin's biographer Richard Bradford is struck by the distinctive tone in the fragment, different from anything else written under Coleman's name. The text breaks off suddenly; Motion surmises that Larkin abandoned it because he was eager to begin work on the first Coleman novel. Booth describes the prose as \\"a mix of Daphne du Maurier nostalgia and surreal farce\\". =Novel: Trouble at Willow Gables= Synopsis Emotional friendships between girls are characteristic of Brunette Coleman's school fiction. Marie Moore, a junior pupil at Willow Gables, receives a birthday present of ¬£5 from an aunt. After the banknote is retained for safe keeping by the headmistress, Miss Holden, Marie slyly recovers it but is quickly found out, and is coerced by Miss Holden into giving the money to the school's gymnasium fund. When later the banknote goes missing from the fund's collection box, Marie is suspected, but protests her innocence despite a savage beating from Miss Holden with assistance from two burly school prefects. Only her friend Myfanwy believes her. Confined in the school's punishment room, Marie manages to escape with the help of a domestic servant, and runs away. Hilary Russell, a prefect and predatory lesbian, lusts after Mary Beech, the school's cricket captain. On a night expedition in pursuit of Mary, Hilary catches Margaret Tattenham, a junior, in the act of replacing the ¬£5 note in Miss Holden's room. Margaret says she originally took the money as a prank; Hilary agrees not to report her to Miss Holden in return for sexual favours, to which Margaret reluctantly consents. The following morning, Hilary denounces her anyway; Margaret responds by revealing Hilary's sexual harassment but is not believed, and is taken to the punishment room where Marie's absence is revealed. Hilary is sent with a search party to find the missing girl. Meanwhile, Margaret makes a daring escape via the window, and rides off on the school horse. She finds Marie, who is miserable and frightened and wants to return to the school whatever the consequences. Margaret confesses that she borrowed the ¬£5 to bet on a horse, and has won ¬£100. She means to leave Willow Gables for good, and apologises to Marie for the trouble she has caused her. This conversation is overheard by Hilary's search party, and after a scuffle the truants are captured. On the way back to school they hear cries from the river; it is Myfanwy, who has got into difficulties while swimming. Margaret frees herself from her captors' clutches, dives in and saves her drowning friend. Back at the school, Miss Holden overlooks the theft in view of Margaret's heroism, although she confiscates the ¬£100 winnings and donates the money to a new swimming pool fund. Marie is exonerated, and her ¬£5 is returned. Mary Beech comes forward to corroborate Margaret's accusations against Hilary, who is summarily expelled. Marie and Myfanwy enjoy an emotional reunion in the school sickroom, as life at the school returns to normal, with friendship and forgiveness all round. Commentary The typescript begins with a dedication page \\"To Jacinth\\" (Brunette Coleman's imagined secretary). There follows an untitled poem which later appears, slightly altered, as \\"The School in August\\" in Sugar and Spice, the Coleman poetry collection. In the story the surnames of the headmistress and principal girls have been altered in ink throughout the typescript; some of the original names belonged to Larkin's real-life acquaintances at Oxford. The presence of a publisher's inkstamp on the wallet containing the typescript indicates that the story may have been submitted by Larkin for publication.Booth, pp. 3‚Äì5 Booth argues that, whatever Larkin's motive in writing it, the story follows the parameters of schoolgirl fiction with some fidelity. Its main characters all have models within the genre; Marie has much in common with Dorita Fairlie Bruce's recurrent character \\"Dimsie\\", while Hilary is likewise based on Dorothy Vicary's villainous \\"Una Vickers\\" in Niece of the Headmistress. The usual themes of friendships, rivalries and injustices are explored, and the ending in reconciliation and future hope is entirely true to type. Some scenes‚Äîthe savage beating endured by Marie, the lingering descriptions of girls dressing and undressing, Hilary's smouldering sexuality‚Äîmay, Booth asserts, be written with \\"the lusts of the male heterosexual gaze\\" in mind but, he continues, the reader looking for explicit pornography will be disappointed.Booth, p. xvi Bradford notes three prose styles combining in the narrative: \\"cautious indifference, archly overwritten symbolism ... and ... its writer's involuntary feelings of sexual excitement\\".Bradford, p. 51 Motion finds the tone of the prose frivolous on the surface, yet fundamentally cold and cruel: \\"Once its women have been arraigned for pleasure they are dismissed; once they have been enjoyed they are treated with indifference\\".Motion, p. 92 =Novel: Michaelmas Term at St Bride's= Synopsis Somerville College, Oxford, the recognisable model for St Bride's In this incomplete story Mary, Marie, Margaret and Myfanwy, friends from Willow Gables, are new undergraduates at St Bride's College, Oxford. Mary is disconcerted to find that she is sharing her rooms with Hilary, her old adversary from the school. However, although Hilary still has a roving lesbian eye, she has lost most of her predatory instincts and the two become friends. Mary falls foul of Mary de Putron, the aggressive and authoritarian college games captain; in the hockey trials de Putron makes Mary play out of her normal position, so that performs badly. Hilary subsequently avenges Mary's humiliation by seducing de Putron's boyfriend, a gauche Royal Air Force officer called Clive, whom she then dumps unceremoniously. Of Myfanwy's doings we learn relatively little. Margaret, still fascinated with horse-racing, sets up her own bookmaking business. Marie discovers psychoanalysis and tries to cure her sister Philippa's leather belt fetish. After various efforts prove unsuccessful, the sisters seek solace in alcohol. The later stages of the story introduce Larkin's real-life friend, Diana Gollancz, and recount her preparations for a fashionable party. In the final scenes the narrative becomes surreal, as on their alcoholic quest Marie and Philippa are confronted by the knowledge that they are characters in a story, while \\"real life\\" is going on in the next room. Marie takes a peep at real life, and decides she would rather stay in the story, which breaks off at this point with a few pencil notes indicating possible ways in which it might have continued. Commentary Only the first dozen pages of the manuscript are typed; the remainder is handwritten. The surnames of the characters, which were changed in Trouble at Willow Gables, are unaltered. The script carries a dedication to \\"Miriam and Diana\\": Miriam was an acquaintance with whom Larkin had discussed lesbian relationships, while Diana Gollancz (\\"Diana G.\\" in the story), the daughter of the publisher Victor Gollancz, supplied him with many anecdotes from her schooldays.Booth, pp. 129‚Äì30Motion, p. 88 According to Motion, \\"St Bride's\\" is recognisably based on Somerville College, Oxford.Motion, pp. 93‚Äì96 In his analysis of the Coleman fiction, Stephen Cooper notes that, as with Willow Gables, the narrative voice switches from character to character so that different thoughts, attitudes and perspectives can be expressed.Cooper, pp. 23‚Äì25 Cooper argues that as the narrative progresses, Larkin's concerns (in his Coleman voice) move beyond sexual titillation; he is no longer interested in describing lesbian encounters in voyeuristic detail.Cooper, p. 28 Hilary emerges as saviour rather than seducer, as a campaigner against male oppression, and as a figure who \\"deviates from the cultural norms [yet] can triumph over those who adopt conventional attitudes\\".Cooper, p. 30 The scenes with sexual content or innuendo are largely confined to the earlier parts of the story. The later parts, which introduce the male characters \\"Clive\\" and Hilary's other admirer, the contemptible \\"Creature\\" are, according to Motion, overlaid with male self- disgust, a theme apparent in Larkin's two published novels and in his later poetry. Motion suggests that the loss of erotic impetus, and Larkin's apparent fading of interest, are the main reasons why the story peters out. =Sugar and Spice: A Sheaf of Poems= The typescript of Sugar and Spice consists of six poems, which in sequence are: #\\"The False Friend\\" #\\"Bliss\\" #\\"Femmes Damn√©es\\" #\\"Ballade des Dames du Temps Jadis\\" #\\"Holidays\\" #\\"The School in August\\" A seventh poem in pencil, \\"Fourth Form Loquitur\\", has been loosely inserted into the typescript.Booth, pp. 241‚Äì52 \\"Femmes Damn√©es\\", which was printed by John Fuller at the Sycamore Press, Oxford, in 1978, is the only Coleman work published in Larkin's lifetime.Motion, p.98 This poem, and \\"The School in August\\", were included in Larkin's Collected Poems published in 1988;Motion, p. 97 \\"The School in August\\" was omitted from the 2003 revised edition of the collection although, according to Amis, it is the poem that best gives the flavour of the Coleman pastiche.Amis, p. 55 \\"Bliss\\" was included in Larkin's Selected Letters (1992), as part of a letter to Amis.Thwaite, p. 64 Motion describes the Coleman poems as \\"a world of comfortless jealousies, breathless bike-rides and deathless crushes\\", mixing elements from writers and poets such as Angela Brazil, Richmal Crompton, John Betjeman and W.H. Auden. Larkin's own attitude to these poems appears equivocal. He expresses pleasure that his friend Bruce Montgomery liked them, especially \\"The School in August\\".Thwaite, p. 69 However, to Amis he writes: \\"I think all wrong-thinking people ought to like them. I used to write them whenever I'd seen any particularly ripe schoolgirl ... Writing about grown women is less perverse and therefore less satisfying\\".Thwaite, p. 70 Booth finds the poems the most impressive of all the Coleman works, in their evidence of Larkin's early ability to create striking and moving images from conventional school story clich√©s. They are an early demonstration of Larkin's talent for finding depths in ordinariness, an ability that characterised many of his later poems. Booth draws specific attention to the elegiac quality of the final lines of \\"The School in August\\": \\"And even swimming groups can fade / Games mistresses turn grey\\". In Booth's view the Coleman poems are among the best Larkin wrote in the 1940s, well beyond anything in his first published selection The North Ship (1945).Booth, p. xvii =\\"What Are We Writing For\\"= The typescript of the essay is headed by an epigraph, attributed to The Upbringing of Daughters by Catherine Durning Whethem. It reads: \\"The chief justification of reading books of any sort is the enlargement of experience that should accrue therefrom\\".Booth, p. 253 The text which follows is, in Motion's words, \\"a homily on how and how not to write for children\\".Motion, pp. 101‚Äì02 It argues for the need for well-drawn heroines, and for unrepentant villainesses: \\"To be tenacious in evil is the duty of every villain ... Let her hate the heroine wholeheartedly, and refuse, yes, even on the last page, to take her hand in forgiveness\\". The story should not be about schoolgirls, but about a school with girls in it. The school must be English; foreign settings or trips abroad are disparaged. Larkin, in Coleman's voice, pleads for \\"the Classic Unities\\": Unity of Place, which is the school and its inhabitants; Unity of Time, normally the term in which the action occurs; and Unity of Action, whereby every recorded incident contributes in some way to the telling of the story. The essay is laden with quotations from many writers of the genre, among them Joy Francis, Dorita Fairlie Bruce, Elsie J. Oxenham, Elinor Brent-Dyer and Nancy Breary.Booth, pp. 255‚Äì73 Motion argues that aside from the sometimes facetious tone, the opinions expressed by Larkin in his Coleman persona, particularly the mild xenophobia that enters the essay, foreshadow his own mature prejudices. Bradford believes that the essay reads as a serious, well-researched paper on the genre of early twentieth century boarding school literature, worthy of inclusion in F. W. Bateson's Essays and Criticism had that journal existed in 1943. Critical reception Andrew Motion, Larkin's biographer, who made public the existence of the \\"Brunette Coleman\\" works Shortly before his death in 1985 Larkin instructed his companion Monica Jones to burn his diaries. His instructions did not cover other writings, therefore the Coleman material remained in the archives of the Brynmor Jones Library at the University of Hull, where Larkin had worked as chief librarian since 1955. The existence of these papers was first made public in 1992, when Larkin's Selected Letters was published. In the following year extensive extracts from the Coleman works appeared in Motion's biography of Larkin, and became the subject of literary analysis by M. W. Rowe, in his 1999 essay \\"Unreal Girls: Lesbian Fantasy in Early Larkin\\". Rowe saw Larkin's adoption of a female persona as an outlet, compensating for his sexual awkwardness and lack of success with Oxford women.Rowe (2000), pp. 82‚Äì85 The punishment scenes, in which women punish women, were a means of subduing Larkin's feelings of anger and frustration with his personal sexual failures.Rowe (2000), p. 86 More significantly, according to Rowe, Larkin's invention of Coleman was the catalyst which broke the writing block that had afflicted him for most of his Oxford years.Rowe (2000), p. 80 The few months of her creative life in 1943 were, Larkin later acknowledged, the prelude to \\"the intensest time of my life\\"; in the three subsequent years his poetry collection The North Ship and his novels Jill and A Girl in Winter were published. The complete Coleman material, in a collection edited by James Booth, was finally published in 2002. Booth thought that the material would probably cause \\"a huge amount of confusion and smoke because the politically correct brigade will jump on it\\". Anticipating the publication, Emma Hartley and Vanessa Thorpe in The Observer doubted the literary value of the works, citing Motion's view that the stories were \\"little more than mild pornography\\" which the mature poet would never have wished to see published. On publication, Booth's collection provoked a particularly hostile reaction from The Guardians critic Jenny Diski, whose review dismissed the Coleman writings as \\"drivel\\" and \\"sad ramblings\\", unworthy of publication or critical attention, and not even valid pornography: \\"Not a breast, not a clitoris is seen or mentioned.\\" Unlike serious pornographers, \\"Larkin sketches a mere outline and then walks away with a snigger\\". Diski mocks Booth's reverential descriptions of the typescripts \\"as though they were slivers of the True Cross\\", and concludes: \\"Let this be a lesson, at least, to anyone who hasn't got around to chucking out the crap they wrote in their teens and early twenties.\\" Other critics were more positive. The New Statesmans Robert Potts found the stories \\"entertaining and intriguing for readers familiar with their background and with the genre\\", and for the most part charmingly innocent, \\"especially when compared with the reality of boarding-school life\\". The evocation of adolescent homoeroticism was deliberate and playful rather than pornographic. In a similar vein, Richard Canning in The Independent found the Willow Gables fiction vibrant, well-constructed and entertaining, and praised Larkin's \\"sly Sapphic spin\\". In a more recent analysis Terry Castle, writing in the journal Daedalus, disagrees profoundly with the notion expressed by Adam Kirsch in The Times Literary Supplement, that the publication of the Coleman works was damaging to Larkin's reputation. On the contrary, argues Castle, \\"the Brunette phase speaks volumes about the paradoxical process by which Philip Larkin became 'Larkinesque'‚Äîmodern English poetry's reigning bard of erotic frustration and depressive (if verse-enabling) self-deprecation\\". Influences The effects of Larkin's Coleman phase are clearly evident in his first novel, Jill, in which he makes copious use of Willow Gables material.Bradford, p. 57 The novelist's protagonist, a shy Oxford undergraduate called John Kemp, invents a schoolgirl sister called Jill, initially to impress his arrogant and dismissive room-mate, Christopher Warner. Although Warner displays little interest, the non-existent \\"Jill\\" comes to obsess Kemp. He imagines her at Willow Gables School, and writes long letters to her there. In the form of a short story he details her life at the school‚Äînow located in Derbyshire rather than Wiltshire as it had been in the Coleman works. The girls' names are different, but their speech and attitudes closely reflect those of the earlier stories. A lesbian element is introduced through Jill's fascination with the cool, detached senior girl Minerva Strachey. Kemp's fantasy is disturbed when he meets a real-life Jill, or Gillian; his attempts to match his flight of fancy to reality end in embarrassment and humiliation.Motion, pp. 154‚Äì56 Reviewing the published Coleman material, The Independent Richard Canning suggests that the influence of these early works is often discernible in Larkin's poetry. Likewise Stephen Cooper, in his 2004 book Philip Larkin: Subversive Writer, argues that the stylistic and thematic influences of Trouble at Willow Gables and Michaelmas Term at St Brides anticipate the poetry's recurrent concern with rebellion and conformity.Cooper, p. 6 Among examples, Cooper cites Marie's refusal in Willow Gables to compromise with an unjust authority as reflecting the sentiments expressed in Larkin's poem \\"Places, Loved Ones\\" (1954).Cooper, p. 10 The reader, says Cooper, \\"is invited to identify with Marie's plight in a manner that foreshadows the empathy felt for the rape victim in 'Deception (1950).Cooper, p. 14 When Marie, having escaped from the school, discovers that her freedom is an illusion, she longs to return to the familiar paths. These sentiments are present in poems such as \\"Poetry of Departures\\" (1954), \\"Here\\" (1961), and \\"High Windows\\" (1967).Cooper, p. 23 The spirit though not the name of Brunette was briefly revived during 1945‚Äì46, when Larkin renewed his friendship with Amis. Among the stillborn projects planned by the pair was a story about two beautiful jazz-loving lesbian undergraduates. According to Booth, the \\"feeble plot [was] merely the excuse for lesbian scenes ... far indeed from the originality of Larkin's Brunette works of 1943\\".Booth, pp. xxx‚Äìxxxi Jill, completed in 1944, was finally published in October 1946 by The Fortune Press, whose eccentric proprietor Reginald Caton reportedly accepted the book without reading it.Motion, p. 132 Larkin was disappointed by the book's critical reception,Motion, pp. 158‚Äì59 but by this time his second novel, A Girl in Winter, had been accepted by Faber and Faber, and was duly published in February 1947. It received better reviews than Jill, and achieved moderately good sales;Motion, p. 164 Booth calls it Larkin's \\"most original and adventurous experiment in fiction\\". It is written from the viewpoint of its main female character, Katherine, but otherwise is unrelated to the Coleman phase. Over the following years Larkin began but failed to finish several more novels, in the last of which, A New World Symphony, he returned once again to the device of a female protagonist-narrator. The novel was finally abandoned around 1954.Booth, pp. xxxvi and xli‚Äìxlii Notes and references Notes References Sources    * Pseudonymous writers Philip Larkin ","title":"Brunette Coleman"},{"id":"992243","text":"The Mystic River Bascule Bridge is a bascule bridge spanning the Mystic River in Mystic, Connecticut in the United States.

Among its facilities are numerous luxurious guest rooms, several restaurants, the famed Round Robin Bar, the Peacock Alley series of luxury shops, and voluminous function rooms. Owned by InterContinental Hotels & Resorts, it is two blocks east of the White House, and two blocks west of the Metro Center station of the Washington Metro. History The first structures to be built at 1401 Pennsylvania Avenue NW were six small houses constructed by Colonel John Tayloe III in 1816.Moeller and Weeks, AIA Guide to the Architecture of Washington, D.C., 2006, p. 133. Tayloe leased the six buildings to Joshua Tennison, who named them Tennison's Hotel.Hogarth, Walking Tours of Old Washington and Alexandria, 1985, p. 28. The structures served as a hotel for the next three decades, the leaseholder and name changing several times: Williamson's Mansion Hotel, Fullers American House, and the City Hotel. By 1847, the structures were in disrepair and Tayloe's son, Benjamin Ogle Tayloe, was desperate to find a tenant who would maintain the structures and run them profitably.Willard, \\"Henry August Willard: His Life and Times,\\" Records of the Columbia Historical Society, 1917, p. 244‚Äì245. The Willard Hotel was formally founded by Henry Willard when he leased the six buildings in 1847, combined them into a single structure, and enlarged it into a four- story hotel he renamed the Willard Hotel.Burlingame, With Lincoln in the White House, 2006, p. 197. Willard purchased the hotel property from Ogle Tayloe in 1864, but a dispute over the purchase price and the form of payment (paper currency or gold coin) led to a major equity lawsuit which ended up in the Supreme Court of the United States. The Supreme Court split the difference in Willard v. Tayloe. 75 U.S. 557 (1869): The purchase price would remain the same, but Willard must pay in gold coin (which had not depreciated in value the way paper currency had). Franklin Pierce departs from the Willard Hotel for his inauguration, March 1853 The present 12-story structure, designed by famed hotel architect Henry Janeway Hardenbergh, opened in 1901.Moeller and Weeks, AIA Guide to the Architecture of Washington, D.C., 2006, p. 134. It suffered a major fire in 1922 which caused $250,000 (equivalent to $ as of ), in damages.\\"Notables Routed By Top Floor Fire In Willard Hotel,\\" The New York Times, April 24, 1922. Among those who had to be evacuated from the hotel were Vice President Calvin Coolidge, several U.S. senators, composer John Philip Sousa, motion picture producer Adolph Zukor, newspaper publisher Harry Chandler, and numerous other media, corporate, and political leaders who were present for the annual Gridiron Dinner. For many years the Willard was the only hotel from which one could easily visit all of downtown Washington, and consequently it has housed many dignitaries during its history. The Willard family sold its share of the hotel in 1946, and due to mismanagement and the severe decline of the area, the hotel closed without a prior announcement on July 16, 1968.New York Times, July 16, 1968 The building sat vacant for years, and numerous plans were floated for its demolition. It eventually fell into a semi-public receivership and was sold to the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation. They held a competition to rehabilitate the property and ultimately awarded it to the Oliver Carr Company and Golding Associates.Barbara Gamarekian, \\"[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=travel&res;=9A0DEFD91F3BF937A3575AC0A960948260 The Willard is Restored as a Jewel of Pennsylvania Avenue\\", New York Times, 1986-09-04 The two partners then brought in the InterContinental Hotels Group to be a part owner and operator of the hotel. The Willard was subsequently restored to its turn-of-the-century elegance and an office-building contingent was added. The hotel was thus re-opened amid great celebration on August 20, 1986, which was attended by several U.S. Supreme Court justices and U.S. senators. In the late 1990s, the hotel once again underwent significant restoration. Notable guests presidential flag in the 1920s, indicating the President of the United States was on the premises. The first group of three Japanese ambassadors to the United States stayed at the Willard with seventy- four other delegates in 1860, where they observed that their hotel room was more luxurious than the U.S. Secretary of State's house. It was the first time an official Japanese delegation traveled to a foreign destination, and many tourists and journalists gathered to see the sword-carrying Japanese. In the 1860s, author Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote that \\"the Willard Hotel more justly could be called the center of Washington than either the Capitol or the White House or the State Department.\\" From February 4 to February 27, 1861, the Peace Congress, featuring delegates from 21 of the 34 states, met at the Willard in a last-ditch attempt to avert the Civil War. A plaque from the Virginia Civil War Commission, located on the Pennsylvania Ave. side of the hotel, commemorates this courageous effort. Later that year, upon hearing a Union regiment singing \\"John Brown's Body\\" as they marched beneath her window, Julia Ward Howe wrote the lyrics to \\"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\\" while staying at the hotel in November 1861. On February 23, 1861, amid several assassination threats, detective Allan Pinkerton smuggled Abraham Lincoln into the Willard; there Lincoln lived until his inauguration on March 4, holding meetings in the lobby and carrying on business from his room. On March 27, 1874, the Northern and Southern Orders of Chi Phi met at the Willard to unite as the Chi Phi Fraternity. Many United States presidents have frequented the Willard, and every president since Franklin Pierce has either slept in or attended an event at the hotel at least once; the hotel hence is also known as \\"the residence of presidents.\\" It was the habit of Ulysses S. Grant to drink whiskey and smoke a cigar while relaxing in the lobby. Folklore (promoted by the hotel) holds that this is the origin of the term \\"lobbying,\\" as Grant was often approached by those seeking favors. However, this is probably false, as Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary dates the verb \\"to lobby\\" to 1837. Grover Cleveland lived there at the beginning of his second term in 1893, because of concern for his infant daughter's health following a recent outbreak of scarlet fever in the White House.Graff, H. (2002) Grover Cleveland p. 113 Plans for Woodrow Wilson's League of Nations took shape when he held meetings of the League to Enforce Peace in the hotel's lobby in 1916. Six sitting Vice-Presidents have lived in the Willard. Millard Fillmore and Thomas A. Hendricks, during his brief time in office, lived in the old Willard; and then four successive Vice-Presidents, James S. Sherman, Thomas R. Marshall, Calvin Coolidge and finally Charles Dawes all lived in the current building for at least part of their vice-presidency. Fillmore and Coolidge continued in the Willard, even after becoming president, to allow the first family time to move out of the White House. A fire broke out in April 1922 while Calvin Coolidge was staying in the building. Attempting to re-enter the building, he was asked to identify himself to the fire marshal, to which he responded, \\"I'm the Vice President.\\" The fire marshal's response was \\"What are you vice president of?\\" Several hundred officers, many of them combat veterans of World War I, first gathered with the General of the Armies, John J. \\"Blackjack\\" Pershing, at the Willard Hotel on October 2, 1922, and formally established the Reserve Officers Association (ROA) as an organization. The first recorded meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research was convened at the Willard on May 7, 1907. In 1935 the hotel was used as a place of confinement for William P. MacCracken Jr., Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Aeronautics, after he was convicted of contempt of Congress in the Air Mail scandal. According to The Washington Post, \\"Chesley Jurney, the Senate sargeant at arms, had no place to hold MacCracken who, after being sentenced, showed up at Jurney's house and stayed the night. The next day he was confined to a room at the Willard Hotel.\\"Philip Bump (January 18, 2018) Congress‚Äôs ability to twist arms is limited, The Washington Post During World War II the British government rented several of the Willard's floors for its supply organization. Jean Monnet had his office there. In 1997 a memorial plaque was erected near the hotel's entrance to commemorate this episode. Martin Luther King Jr., wrote his famous \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech in his hotel room at the Willard in 1963, in the days leading up to his August 28 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. On September 23, 1987, it was reported that Bob Fosse collapsed in his room at the Willard and later died. It was subsequently learned that he actually died at George Washington University Hospital. Among the Willard's many other famous guests are P. T. Barnum, Mark Twain, Walt Whitman, General Tom Thumb, Samuel Morse, the Duke of Windsor, Harry Houdini, Gypsy Rose Lee, Gloria Swanson, Emily Dickinson, Jenny Lind, Charles Dickens, Bert Bell, Joe Paterno, and Jim Sweeney. Steven Spielberg shot the finale of his film Minority Report at the hotel in the summer of 2001. He filmed with Tom Cruise and Max von Sydow in the Willard Room, Peacock Alley and the kitchen. A replica of the terraced roof of the office building was constructed on a soundstage for the final scene. On February 22, 2012, Australian Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd gave a dramatic resignation speech in the hotel's Douglas Room. Bread and Butter, the turkeys pardoned by US President Donald Trump stayed here prior to the pardoning ceremony. Rating The AAA gave the hotel four diamonds out of five in 1986. The hotel has maintained that rating every year, and received four diamonds again for 2016. Forbes Travel Guide (formerly known as Mobil Guide) declined to give the hotel either four or five stars in 2016, but did add it to its list of \\"recommended\\" properties.

The words have not changed very much in two-and-a-half centuries. It is sung to a variant of the 1761 French melody Ah! vous dirai-je, maman. Modern version The rhyme as illustrated by Dorothy M. Wheeler Recent versions tend to take the following form: The rhyme is a single stanza in trochaic metre, which is common in nursery rhymes and relatively easy for younger children to master. The Roud Folk Song Index, which catalogues folk songs and their variations by number, classifies the song as 4439 and variations have been collected across Great Britain and North America.\\"Searchable database\\" , English Folk Song and Dance Society, retrieved 28 March 2012. Melody The rhyme is usually sung to a variant of the 1761 French melody Ah! vous dirai-je, maman, which is also used for \\"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\\" and the \\"Alphabet song\\". The words and melody were first published together by A. H. Rosewig in (Illustrated National) Nursery Songs and Games, published in Philadelphia in 1879.J. J. Fuld, The Book of World- Famous Music: Classical, Popular, and Folk (Courier Dover Publications, 5th edn., 2000), , pp. 593-4. The text was translated to Swedish by August Strindberg for Barnen i skogen (1872), a Swedish edition of Babes in the Wood. To this Swedish text a melody was written by Alice Tegn√©r and published in the songbook Sjung med oss, Mamma! (1892), where the black sheep is now a white lamb: B√§, b√§, vita lamm,B√§, b√§, vita lamm, page 10, in Alice Tegn√©r, Sjung med oss, Mamma! (1892), found in Project Runeberg. one of the most popular Swedish children's songs. Origins and meaning Illustration for the rhyme from Mother Goose's Melody, first published c. 1765 As with many nursery rhymes, attempts have been made to find origins and meanings for the rhyme, most of which have no corroborating evidence. Katherine Elwes Thomas in The Real Personages of Mother Goose (1930) suggested the rhyme referred to resentment at the heavy taxation on wool.W. S. Baring-Gould and C. Baring Gould, The Annotated Mother Goose (Bramhall House, 1962), , p. 35. This has particularly been taken to refer to the medieval English \\"Great\\" or \\"Old Custom\\" wool tax of 1275, which survived until the fifteenth century More recently the rhyme has been connected to the slave trade, particularly in the southern United States.\\"Ariadne\\", New Scientist, 13 March 1986. This explanation was advanced during debates over political correctness and the use and reform of nursery rhymes in the 1980s, but has no supporting historical evidence. Rather than being negative, the wool of black sheep may have been prized as it could be made into dark cloth without dyeing. The rhyme was first printed in Tommy Thumb's Pretty Song Book, the oldest surviving collection of English language nursery rhymes, published c. 1744 with the lyrics very similar to those still used today: In the next surviving printing, in Mother Goose's Melody (c. 1765), the rhyme remained the same, except the last lines, which were given as, \\"But none for the little boy who cries in the lane\\". Modern controversies William Wallace Denslow's illustrations for Baa, Baa, Black Sheep, from a 1901 edition of Mother Goose A controversy emerged over changing the language of \\"Baa Baa Black Sheep\\" in Britain from 1986, because, it was alleged in the popular press, it was seen as racially dubious. This was based only on a rewriting of the rhyme in one private nursery as an exercise for the children there and not on any local government policy. A similar controversy emerged in 1999 when reservations about the rhyme were submitted to Birmingham City Council by a working group on racism in children's resources, which were never approved or implemented. Two private nurseries in Oxfordshire in 2006 altered the song to \\"Baa Baa Rainbow Sheep\\", with black being replaced with a variety of other adjectives, like \\"happy, sad, hopping\\" and \\"pink\\". Commentators have asserted that these controversies have been exaggerated or distorted by some elements of the press as part of a more general campaign against political correctness. In 2014, there was reportedly a similar controversy in the Australian state of Victoria. Allusions The phrase \\"yes sir, yes sir, three bags full sir\\" has been used to describe any obsequious or craven subordinate. It is attested from 1910, and originally was common in the British Royal Navy. The rhyme has often been raised in literature and popular culture. Rudyard Kipling used the rhyme as the title of a semi- autobiographical short story he wrote in 1888. The name Black Sheep Squadron was used for the Marine Attack Squadron 214 of the United States Marine Corps from 1942 and the title Baa Baa Black Sheep was used for a book by its leader Colonel Gregory \\"Pappy\\" Boyington and for a TV series (later syndicated as Black Sheep Squadron) that aired on NBC from 1976 until 1978.F. E. Walton, Once They Were Eagles: The Men of the Black Sheep Squadron (University Press of Kentucky, 1996), , p. 189.

Considered by scholarsHandley, William R. Introduction. Zane Grey. Riders of the Purple Sage. New York: Modern Library, 2002; p. xi. . to have played a significant role in shaping the formula of the popular Western genre, the novel has been called \\"the most popular western novel of all time.\\" Plot Riders of the Purple Sage is a story about three main characters, Bern Venters, Jane Withersteen, and Jim Lassiter, who in various ways struggle with persecution from the local Mormon community (\\"Mormon\\" is the informal term for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints), led by Bishop Dyer and Elder Tull, in the fictional town of Cottonwoods, Utah. Jane Withersteen, a born-and-raised Mormon, provokes Elder Tull because she is attractive, wealthy, and befriends \\"Gentiles\\" (non- Mormons), namely, a little girl named Fay Larkin, a man she has hired named Bern Venters, and another hired man named Lassiter. Elder Tull, a polygamistMormons officially ended the practice of polygamy in 1890. with two wives already, wishes to have Jane for a third wife, along with her estate. The story involves cattle-rustling, horse-theft, kidnapping and gunfights.  Setting  Southern Utah canyon country, 1871. The influx of Mormon settlers from 1847 to 1857 serves as a backdrop for the plot. The Mormons had been living in Kirtland, Ohio in the 1830s, but ventured west to escape persecution, Mormons being unpopular.  Point-of-view  The story is told from an anonymous third-person, omniscient point-of-view. The narrator reports what the characters say and how they feel, even when they are alone. For example: \\"On this night the same old loneliness beset Venters...\\" Grey, Zane. Riders of the Purple Sage. New York: Modern Library, 2002; chapter 4. . Characters ;Jane Withersteen Wealthy owner and operator of the considerable Withersteen ranch, her father having founded and established the estate. Miss Withersteen sympathizes with both Mormons (her own people) and Gentiles, which gets her into trouble with the local bishop and elder. ;Bern Venters Venters is a non-Mormon in the employ of Miss Withersteen. As the story opens he is in a very poor state, being persecuted by the local Mormons. However, Venters is very able with firearms and horses, and he is determined to not be beat. ;Jim Lassiter Lassiter is a gunfighter on a mysterious mission which brings him to Cottonwoods and Miss Withersteen. He is a non-Mormon and furthermore has no creed except his own way. ;Bess/Elizabeth Erne Bess has been raised by Oldring and his band of rustlers; she has very little memory of her mother. She is known as the Masked Rider. ;Elder Tull Tull practices \\"plural marriage\\" and desires to marry Jane Withersteen. He also wants to drive Bern Venters and Lassiter out of town and out of the region. Sequel The Rainbow Trail, a sequel to Riders of the Purple Sage that reveals the fate of Jane and Lassiter and their adopted daughter, was published in 1915. Both novels are notable for their protagonists' strong opposition to Mormon polygamy, but in Rainbow Trail this theme is treated more explicitly. The plots of both books revolve around the victimization of women in the Mormon culture: events in Riders of the Purple Sage are centered on the struggle of a Mormon woman who sacrifices her wealth and social status to avoid becoming a junior wife of the head of the local church, while Rainbow Trail contrasts the fanatical older Mormons with the rising generation of Mormon women who will not tolerate polygamy and Mormon men who will not seek it. Adaptations =Films= Riders of the Purple Sage has been adapted to film five times. The first film version of the novel was the silent film Riders of the Purple Sage (1918) starring William Farnum as Lassiter and Mary Mersch as Jane. In later film versions the villains are corrupt judges or lawyers, not polygamous Mormons. A second silent film version was released in 1925, starring Tom Mix as Lassiter and Mabel Ballin as Jane. The first sound version appeared in 1931, starring George O'Brien as Lassiter and Marguerite Churchill as Jane. In 1941, a fourth film version was released, starring George Montgomery as Jim Lassiter and Mary Howard as Jane. Fifty-five years later, a television film, Riders of the Purple Sage (1996), was released, starring Ed Harris as Lassiter and Amy Madigan as Jane. * Riders of the Purple Sage (1918), starring William Farnum and Mary Mersch * Riders of the Purple Sage (1925), starring Tom Mix and Mabel Ballin * Riders of the Purple Sage (1931), starring George O'Brien and Marguerite Churchill * Riders of the Purple Sage (1941), starring George Montgomery and Mary Howard * Riders of the Purple Sage (1996), starring Ed Harris and Amy Madigan =Other media= During World War II the novel was rejected for publication as an Armed Services Editions paperback provided to US servicemen due to perceived bias against Mormonismhttps://www.abaa.org/members-articles/armed-service-editions.

American Morning debuted with anchors Paula Zahn and Anderson Cooper on the day after 9/11, five months earlier than planned, replacing CNN Early Edition and CNN Live This Morning. Cooper was replaced by Bill Hemmer in February 2002. The show's next permanent co-anchors were Soledad O'Brien and Miles O'Brien, who fronted the show from 2003 to 2007. They were replaced by John Roberts and Kiran Chetry due to poor ratings. After Roberts and Chetry left in 2011, the show did not have a permanent anchor team and was shelved by CNN at the end of the year. American Morning was replaced by two new programs, Early Start and Starting Point. About the show American Morning was last hosted by Ali Velshi, Christine Romans and Carol Costello. Others who appeared regularly were Rob Marciano with the weather, Sunny Hostin on legal news, and CNN senior medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta as well as Elizabeth Cohen with health-related reports. American Morning maintained a stronger focus on political, domestic and global stories than many U.S. morning shows, as demonstrated by its slogan \\"the most news in the morning,\\" although it did have segments related to celebrities and entertainment news. There are usually more scripted segments on American Morning than on other morning shows. The program mainly aimed to attract viewers who prefer a more straightforward morning show, without the amount of anchor banter found on the competition. Its main competitors were Fox News Channel's Fox and Friends and MSNBC's Morning Joe. American Morning aired live every weekday from 6 to 9 am EST. After years of operating from a streetside studio at the Time-Life Building in New York City, the show moved north to an indoor set at the CNN studios in the Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle which was shared with the CNN Headline News show Showbiz Tonight. In October 2006, AM received a redesigned set, along with new music and graphics. On September 26, 2007, American Morning began broadcasting in high definition. Originally AM aired from 7am to 10am. After the cancellation of CNN Daybreak in November 2005, the program was expanded to four hours, 6am to 10am. However, the air time was reduced in October 2006 to 6am to 9am, after the expansion of CNN Newsroom. History =2001‚Äì2009= American Morning originally premiered on September 12, 2001. Paula Zahn began anchoring the program five months early due to the 9/11 attacks which had occurred the previous morning. Jack Cafferty and Anderson Cooper joined her as co-hosts and helped deliver news on the attacks. In February 2002, Bill Hemmer moved to New York to become Paula Zahn's cohost, replacing Anderson Cooper. In April 2003, Bill Hemmer anchored the program solo when Paula Zahn moved to CNN primetime. Heidi Collins and Daryn Kagan temporarily hosted with Bill Hemmer before Soledad O'Brien debuted as co-host. In January 2002, CNN executives were embarrassed to find out an on-air promotion that was not approved by top executives was being aired that called Paula Zahn \\"sexy\\" and included the sound of a zipper. CNN said that the advertisement was approved by a woman in the productions department. CNN later apologized to Paula Zahn. In June 2005, Bill Hemmer left CNN and was replaced by Miles O'Brien. Heidi Collins was replaced by Carol Costello. Jack Cafferty left the show later that summer. The show moved to the Time Warner Center, and shared a set with the CNN Headline News program Showbiz Tonight. Costello later left the program and was not replaced; she returned in 2011. In October 2006, the show received a redesigned set, along with new music and graphics. Due to disappointing Nielsen ratings, CNN announced the replacement of Miles O'Brien and Soledad O'Brien with Kiran Chetry and John Roberts as program hosts effective April 16, 2007. In the first quarter of 2007, Fox and Friends on Fox News Channel averaged 769,000 viewers, CNN's American Morning averaged 372,000 and MSNBC's Imus in the Morning averaged 361,000 viewers at the time of its cancellation by MSNBC on April 11, 2007.Tim Cuprisin, \\"Plagued by soft ratings, O'Briens ousted as CNN morning anchors\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, April 11, 2007. =2010‚Äì2011= On November 22, 2010, American Morning underwent a lighter graphics change. 2011 saw the departures of Roberts and Chetry. Ali Velshi initially filled in alongside Chetry before the latter's departure in July. Chetry was replaced by Christine Romans and Carol Costello. In October 2011, CNN announced a revamp of its morning lineup to be more competitive against cable entries Fox & Friends on Fox News and Morning Joe on MSNBC. American Morning would be replaced by two new programs from January 2, 2012, Early Start (5-7 a.m.) and Starting Point (7-9 a.m.) (both times ET). The shows are expected to be less politically focused and cover a broad range of news. The final broadcast of American Morning on December 30, 2011 was anchored by Alina Cho and Deborah Feyerick. Cho and Feyerick brought show staff onto the set, thanking them for their efforts.

In the 1960s, the focus of Larson's preaching centered mainly on the leftist political ideology, sexually suggestive lyrics, Eastern religious mysticism, and antisocial behavior of many of the era's rock musicians. Debates with Satanists During the late 1980s and into the 1990s, Larson repeatedly debated, interviewed, and confronted Satanists, during the period known as the Satanic panic. On two separate occasions he hosted Nikolas Schreck (a gothic rock musician and lead singer of Radio Werewolf) and Zeena LaVey (once the spokesperson for the Church of Satan and later a priestess in the Temple of Set). During their first encounter the pair defended Satanism, while in 1997, during their second appearance, they defended Setianism. Larson debated the pair, and at times attempted to convert them without success. Larson also debated, interviewed and challenged \\"Nazi Satanist\\" James Mason on his Talk- Back radio show https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpG8SFT0N4A  Talk Back  In 1982, Larson launched Talk Back, a two-hour weekday call-in show geared mainly toward teenagers and frequently focused on teen-oriented topics such as role- playing games and rock music. By this time Larson had come to embrace contemporary Christian music, including styles such as heavy metal and rap, and actively promoted the music and artists on his show. By the late 1980s, in what would come to define his later ministry, Larson was often heard performing exorcisms of callers on the air. The subjects of Satanism and Satanic ritual abuse were frequent topics of discussion. Death metal performer Glen Benton of Deicide became a regular caller, as did Bob Guccione Jr., eldest son of Penthouse founder Bob Guccione and founder of the music magazine Spin. At one point during the 1980s, Guccione Jr. paid Larson to go on tour with American thrash metal band Slayer and write about it. Larson tried his hand at writing fiction: Dead Air (1991) was largely ghost-written by Lori Boespflug and Muriel Olson. His later novels Abaddon (1993) and The Senator's Agenda both linked Satanic ritual abuse to political corruption; the latter was largely written by Larson and his second wife. However, a former vice president of Bob Larson Ministries, Lori Boespflug, said that much of Dead Air, though presented as Larson's work, is actually her own. Supporting these claims is a letter from Larson's lawyer that warns Larson of his \\"potential liability to Lori\\", anticipating that \\"the role Lori has played\\" would lead her to \\"demand recognition and/or profit participation\\" in respect to Dead Air and its sequels. In 2004, Larson returned to the radio airwaves after a two- year absence with a daily talk show heard on a network of radio stations and simulcast and archived on the Internet. Today, Larson remains active. His ministry professes to offer an alternative counseling outlet to people who have problems with violence, self-mutilation, multiple personality disorders, Satanic ritual abuse, or molestation. Exorcism In 2013 Vice magazine taped a video of Larson's visit in several small towns in Ukraine where he performed exorcisms together with three young women - his 18-year-old daughter Brynne Larson and her friends Tess and Savannah Sherkenback (18 and 21 respectively, collectively known as The Teenage Exorcists). The Teenage Exorcists consequently published a reply to Vice Media's video stating that they \\"question the journalistic integrity of this Vice Media story and are disappointed by how we were falsely portrayed.\\" Larson offered to perform exorcisms over Skype (for a donation of $295). His Skype exorcisms were featured in a segment on the satirical program The Daily Show in 2014, in which he told correspondent Jessica Williams, ‚ÄúSkype is a great technology to stare down the Devil, to go after him and to kick him back to hell.‚Äù Later in the same segment, however, he indicated that \\"tweeting an exorcism would be ridiculous.\\" Bibliography *Rock & Roll: The Devil's Diversion (Creation House, 1967) *Hippies, Hindus, and Rock & Roll (Creation House, 1969) *Rock & the Church (Creation House, 1971) *The Day Music Died (Creation House, 1972) *Hell on Earth (Creation House, 1974) *Babylon Reborn (Creation House, 1976) *Rock, Practical Help for Those Who Listen to the Words and Don't like What They Hear (Tyndale, 1980) *Larson's Book of Cults (Tyndale House Publishers, Wheaton, Ill, 1982) *Larson's Book of Family Issues (Tyndale, 1986) *Strange Cults in America (Tyndale, 1986) *Larson's Book of Rock (Tyndale, 1987) *Your Kids and Rock (Tyndale, 1988) *Satanism: the Seduction of America's Youth (Lightning Source, 1989) *Straight Answers on the New Age (Thomas Nelson, 1989) *Tough Talk About Tough Issues (Tyndale, 1989) *Larson's New Book of Cults (Tyndale, 1989) *Dead Air: A Novel (Thomas Nelson, 1991) *Abaddon: A Novel (Thomas Nelson, 1993) *The Senator's Agenda (Thomas Nelson, 1995) *In The Name of Satan: How the Forces of Evil Work and What You Can Do to Defeat Them (Thomas Nelson, 1996) *UFO's and the Alien Agenda (Thomas Nelson, 1997) *Extreme Evil: Kids Killing Kids (Nelson Reference, 1999) *Larson's Book of Spiritual Warfare (Nelson, 1999) *Shock Talk: The Exorcist Files (WestBow, 2001) References External links *Bob Larson's official website Cornerstone Magazine article critical of Larson *Analysis of Larson's teachings and history *The Devil is in the Details: An Examination of the Teachings of Bob Larson 1944 births American television evangelists American television talk show hosts American male writers People of the Christian countercult movement American exorcists Living people Writers from Phoenix, Arizona Spiritual warfare People from McCook, Nebraska Writers from Los Angeles Religious leaders from Phoenix, Arizona ","title":"Bob Larson"},{"id":"992339","text":"Vailima may refer to: *Vailima, Samoa is a village in Samoa, notable as the last residence of Robert Louis Stevenson *Vailima (spider) is a genus of jumping spiders *Vailima (beer) is a beer brewed in Samoa by Samoa Breweries Limited *Vailima Orchard is an apple farm in Richmond, New Zealand ","title":"Vailima"},{"id":"992340","text":"Action is an American comedy series about a Hollywood producer named Peter Dragon, who is trying to recover from his last box-office failure. It aired on Fox during the 1999-2000 season. The series was critically praised for its irreverent and sometimes hostile look at Hollywood culture. Thirteen episodes were produced. The show was created by Chris Thompson and the show runner was Don Reo. Future Saturday Night Live cast member Will Forte was the story editor for twelve episodes, and wrote three.  Characters  = Main = * Peter Dragon, played by Jay Mohr, is the head of Dragonfire Films. Peter got his start as a screenwriter for gay pornography, but eventually moved up the ladder of Hollywood as a hotshot producer of tasteless action films. At the start of the series, Peter's latest film, Slow Torture, is a monumental flop, and he is under tremendous pressure to make his next film a big success. Peter is bossy and arrogant to his subordinates and is morally unscrupulous in negotiating with Hollywood talent. It is once or twice suggested that Peter is sexually confused. * Wendy Ward, played by Illeana Douglas, is a former child actress who gained fame as the cute star of the TV show, The Elephant Princess (not to be confused with The Elephant Princess). Her career tanked during her teen years due to a nasty coke habit, and she is now a high priced call girl. Through circumstance, she ends up becoming Peter's date at the premiere of his movie Slow Torture. After she gives her honest criticism of Slow Torture, Wendy is named Vice President of Production at Dragonfire Films and has an open relationship with Peter. Wendy's character is an intentional play on the \\"hooker with a heart of gold\\" movie stereotype. * Lonnie Dragon, played by Buddy Hackett, is Peter's uncle and chief of security at Dragonfire Films. Lonnie and Peter seem to understand each other perfectly. Lonnie is one of the few people Peter actually treats with respect. Lonnie has served in many wars, including World War II, and often complains about past injuries, most notably the fact that he only has one testicle. As he puts it, \\"The sack is half full.\\" * Stuart Glazer, played by Jack Plotnick, is President of Production at Dragonfire Films. Stuart desperately wants to be taken seriously as a Hollywood developer, but is frequently abused and ordered around by Peter. In spite of his important sounding position, Stuart is often asked to do demeaning tasks like babysit Georgia, have suits dry-cleaned and order gift baskets for star talent. Stuart is gay. * Adam Rafkin, played by Jarrad Paul, is a Jewish struggling screenwriter whose screenplay, Beverly Hills Gun Club, was picked up by Dragonfire Films for development. Adam's script was actually bought mistakenly by Dragonfire Films because his name was confused with the much better known writer Adam Rifkin. Adam lives alone, is sexually frustrated and has had the same agent represent him for most of his floundering professional career. A source of frustration is his lack of respect from Hollywood, most notably from Peter who never seems to recall his correct name. = Supporting = * Asher, played by John Vargas is the eurotrash ma√Ætre d' that runs the high-end restaurant where every power player in town lunches. Getting the right table is a make or break situation and Asher wields his power with the same aplomb as Peter does. Watching Peter squirm is one of Asher's not so secret delights. * Bobby Gianopolis, played by Lee Arenberg is the chief executive of the unnamed movie studio. Bobby G, as he is well known, uses menacing threats to get what he wants from Peter and the rest of the Dragonfire staff. Often these threats involve withdrawing his massive financial backing or exposing his gigantic penis. Bobby G is gay, but married Jane, Peter's ex-wife, in order to quell any rumors of such. Many critics have suggested that Bobby is a parody of former FOX CEO Barry Diller. * Jane Dragon, played by Cindy Ambuehl, is Peter's ex-wife. It is never revealed why she and Peter broke up, but she remarried with Bobby Gianopolis mostly to spite Peter. She is manipulative, scheming and is so orally gifted she can hum and whistle at the same time. She has a daughter by Peter named Georgia and was pregnant with his second child. Peter did not know he conceived another child with her, as he was extremely drunk and thought he had sex with someone else at the time. Jane told him this also out of spite, as he'd always wanted a son. Jane threatened that if he tried to bring it to public knowledge, Bobby would pull his backing. * Georgia Dragon, played by Sara Paxton, is Peter's daughter by Jane. Ten years old, she is deceptively innocent but mildly stone- hearted for her age, a trait she gets from her parents. * Jenny, played by Erin Daniels, is a struggling Hollywood career woman. She used to work at UPN, but after sleeping with Peter, moved on to become a production assistant at Dragonfire Films, where she then slept with Wendy. She is in competition with Stuart. * Cole Riccardi, played by Richard Burgi, is a famous action star who has been in many of Peter's movies. He is introspective, self-obsessed and secretly gay. * Connie Hunt, played by Amy Aquino, is the aggressive publicist assigned to Peter Dragon by Bobby Gianapolis after a major PR disaster. She is dry, practical, cold-hearted, and is portrayed with the aura of a hitman/cleaner. A sound effect of lightning and thunder usually follows mention of her name. * Titus Scroad, played by R. Lee Ermey is an eccentric American movie director loosely parodying real-life Italian director Tinto Brass (albeit lightly crossed with Terence Malick). He has a predilection for hydro-colonic therapy and tends to accentuate his bravado by grabbing his listener's testicles, a tendency that irritates Peter. Titus accidentally drowns in the episode \\"Dead Man Floating\\". * Holden van Dorn, played by Fab Filippo is a hotshot young actor, with a very public record of alcohol and drug abuse. * Reagan Lauren Busch, played by Jennifer Lyons is a sexy starlet with an anxious appetite and recurrent weight problems. = Celebrity cameos = Action was notable for its heavy use of cameos by celebrities, who played themselves. * Keanu Reeves is fondled by Wendy Ward during a movie premiere. (Episode #100) * Steve Kmetko and Jules Asner report on the extremely low opening weekend take of Slow Torture on their show E! News Live. (Episode #101). * Salma Hayek runs into Peter in a restaurant and reveals that Peter sexually harassed her early in her career. (Episode #101) * Sandra Bullock vehemently protests the sex tape of her and Peter that he is selling on his website. (Episode #103) * Steve Kmetko appears interviewing Cole Riccardi. (Episode #103) * Tony Hawk breaks a leg when Peter distracts him, trying to get him to convince Leonardo DiCaprio to do Peter's movie. (Episode #104) * Scott Wolf, much shorter than he has appeared on TV, begs Peter to cast him as an action star, then threatens him after one short joke too many. (Episode #104) * Mike Walker of National Enquirer arrives to get the scoop directly from Peter on the new film. (Episode #106) * David Leisure appears as a career-crashed security guard. (Episode #107) * David Hasselhoff appears at a charity auction. (Episode #108) Theme song The song in the opening credits, \\"Even A Dog Can Shake Hands\\", was performed by Warren Zevon and is from his album Sentimental Hygiene.  Episodes  Broadcast and syndication Of the 13 produced episodes, only 8 ran on Fox in 1999. The remaining five episodes were eventually broadcast on other networks such as FX and Comedy Central. This was also the first Fox series to receive a TV-MA rating, but not the last, as High School USA! on the ADHD block was later rated TV-MA. As of March 2009, the show can be purchased on iTunes. As of 2012, the series is in reruns on IFC, the Independent Film Channel. Home media On February 21, 2006, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released the complete series on DVD in Region 1 for the very first time. On August 27, 2013, it was announced that Mill Creek Entertainment had acquired the rights to various series from the Sony Pictures Television library including Action. The complete series was subsequently re-released on April 1, 2014.

She was the co-founder and vice-chair of the Freedom Democratic Party, which she represented at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. Hamer also organized Mississippi's Freedom Summer along with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). She was also a co- founder of the National Women's Political Caucus, an organization created to recruit, train, and support women of all races who wish to seek election to government office. Hamer began civil rights activism in 1962, continuing until her health declined nine years later. She was known for her use of spiritual hymnals and quotes and her resilience in leading the civil rights movement for black women in Mississippi. She was extorted, threatened, harassed, shot at, and assaulted by racists and police while trying to register for and exercise her right to vote. She later helped and encouraged thousands of African- Americans in Mississippi to become registered voters and helped hundreds of disenfranchised people in her area through her work in programs like the Freedom Farm Cooperative. She unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate in 1964 and the Mississippi State Senate in 1971. In 1970 she led legal action against the government of Sunflower County, Mississippi for continued illegal segregation. Hamer died on March 14, 1977, aged 59, in Mound Bayou, Mississippi. Her memorial service was widely attended and her eulogy was delivered by U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Andrew Young. She was posthumously inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame in 1993. Early life, family, and education Townsend was born on October 6, 1917, in Montgomery County, Mississippi, the last of the 20 children of Ella and James Lee Townsend.title=Fannie Lou Hamer: Civil Rights Activist History Now date=April agency=Mississippi Historical Society 3, 2015 author=Mills, Kay url-status=live archive- url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150311160112/http://mshistorynow.mdah.state.ms.us/articles/51/fannie- lou-hamer-civil-rights-activist archive-date=March 11, 2015 df=mdy-all }} After some of their animal stock was mysteriously poisoned, she suspected a local racist had done it; she said of this incident: \\"our stock got poisoned. We knowed this white man had done it ..... That white man did it just because we were gettin' somewhere. White people never like to see Negroes get a little success. All of this stuff is no secret in the state of Mississippi.\\" In 1919 the Townsends moved to Sunflower County, Mississippi to work as sharecroppers on W. D. Marlow's plantation. From age six she picked cotton with her family. During the winters of 1924 through 1930 she attended the one-room school provided for the sharecroppers' children, open between picking seasons. Fannie loved reading and excelled in spelling bees and reciting poetry, but at age 12 she had to leave school to help support her aging parents.An Oral History with Fannie Lou Hamer (Transcript). April 14, 1972. Center for Oral History and Cultural Heritage, University of Southern Mississippi. By age 13 she would pick 200‚Äì300 pounds (90 to 140 kg) of cotton daily while living with polio. Fannie continued to develop her reading and interpretation skills in Bible study at her church; in later years Lawrence Guyot admired her ability to connect \\"the biblical exhortations for liberation and [the struggle for civil rights] any time that she wanted to and move in and out to any frames of reference.\\" In 1944, after the plantation owner discovered her literacy, she was selected as its time and record keeper. The following year she married Perry \\"Pap\\" Hamer, a tractor driver on the Marlow plantation, and they remained there for the next 18 years. Hamer and her husband wanted very much to start a family but in 1961, Hamer received a hysterectomy by a white doctor without her consent while undergoing surgery to remove a uterine tumor. Forced sterilization was a common method of population control in Mississippi that targeted poor, African-American women. Members of the Black community called the procedure a \\"Mississippi appendectomy\\". The Hamers later raised two girls they adopted. One died of internal hemorrhaging after she was denied admission to the local hospital because of her mother's activism. Hamer became interested in the civil rights movement in the 1950s. She heard leaders in the local movement speak at annual Regional Council of Negro Leadership (RCNL) conferences, held in Mound Bayou, Mississippi. The yearly conferences discussed black voting rights and other civil rights issues black communities in the area faced. Civil rights activism =White racist attacks= On Aug. 31, 1962, Hamer first learned about the constitutional right to vote from volunteers at the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee who had visited her in Mound Bayou. She began to take direct political action in the civil rights movement. On August 31, she traveled with other activists to Indianola, Mississippi, hoping to register to vote. The registration test, crafted to keep blacks from voting, asked her to explain de facto laws. \\"I knowed as much about a facto law as a horse knows about Christmas Day,\\" she recalled. Rejected, she came home to find the \\"boss man raisin' Cain.\\" She had better withdraw her registration, she was told, because \\"we're not ready for that in Mississippi.\\" \\"I didn't try to register for you,\\" Hamer told her boss. \\"I tried to register for myself.\\" She was immediately fired and kicked off the plantation. Her husband was required to stay on the land until the end of the harvest.Badger, p. 70 Hamer moved between homes over the next several days for protection. On September 10, while staying with friend Mary Tucker, Hamer was shot at 16 times in a drive-by shooting by racists.. From the Fannie Lou Hamer Papers, 1966‚Äì1978 No one was injured in the event. The next day Hamer and her family evacuated to nearby Tallahatchie County for three months, fearing retaliation by the Ku Klux Klan for her attempt to vote. On December 4, just after returning to her hometown, she went to the courthouse in Indianola to take the literacy test again, but failed and was turned away. Hamer told the registrar that \\"You'll see me every 30 days till I pass\\". =Registering to vote= On January 10, 1963, Hamer took the literacy test a third time. She was successful and was informed that she was now a registered voter in the State of Mississippi. However, when she attempted to vote that fall, she discovered her registration gave her no actual power to vote as the county required voters to have two poll tax receipts. This requirement had emerged in some (mostly former Confederate) states after the right to vote was first given to all races by the 1870 ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. These laws along with the literacy tests and local government acts of coercion, were used against blacks and Native Americans. Hamer later paid for and acquired the requisite poll tax receipts. Hamer had begun to become more involved in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee after these incidents. She attended many Southern Christian Leadership Conferences (SCLC), which she at times taught classes for, and also various SNCC workshops. She traveled to gather signatures for petitions to attempt to be granted federal resources for impoverished black families across the south. She also became a field secretary for voter registration and welfare programs for the SNCC. Many of these first actions to attempt to register more black voters in Mississippi met with the same problems Hamer had had in trying to register herself. =Police brutality= After becoming a field secretary for the SNCC in 1963, Hamer decided to attend a pro-citizenship conference by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) in Charleston, South Carolina. Travelling by bus with co-activists, the party stopped for a break in Winona, Mississippi. Some of the activists went inside a local cafe, but were refused service by the waitress. Shortly after, a Mississippi State highway patrolman took out his billy club and intimidated the activists into leaving. One of the group decided to take down the officer's license plate number; while doing so the patrolman and a police chief entered the cafe and arrested the party. Hamer left the bus and inquired if they could continue their journey back to Greenwood, Mississippi. At that point the officers arrested her as well. Once in county jail, Hamer's colleagues were beaten by the police in the booking room (including 15 year old June Johnson, for not saying \\"sir\\" in her replies to the officers). Hamer was then taken to a cell where two inmates were ordered, by the state trooper, to beat her using a blackjack. The police ensured she was held down during the almost fatal beating, and when she started to scream, beat her further. Hamer was groped repeatedly by officers during the assault. When she attempted to resist, she states an officer, \\"walked over, took my dress, pulled it up over my shoulders, leaving my body exposed to five men.\\" Another in her group was beaten until she was unable to talk; a third, a teenager, was beaten, stomped on, and stripped. An activist from the SNCC came the next day to see if they could help, but was beaten until his eyes were shut when he did not address an officer in the expected deferential manner. Hamer was released on June 12, 1963. She needed more than a month to recuperate from the beatings and never fully recovered. Though the incident had profound physical and psychological effects, including a blood clot over her left eye and permanent damage on one of her kidneys, she returned to Mississippi to organize voter registration drives, including the 1963 Freedom Ballot, a mock election, and the \\"Freedom Summer\\" initiative the following year. She was known to the volunteers of Freedom Summer as a motherly figure who believed that the civil rights effort should be multi- racial in nature. In addition to her \\"Northern\\" guests, Hamer played host to Tuskegee University student activists Sammy Younge Jr. and Wendell Paris. Younge and Paris grew to become profound activists and organizers under Hamer's tutelage. (Younge was murdered in 1966 at a Standard Oil gas station in Macon County, Alabama, for using a \\"whites-only\\" restroom.) =Freedom Democratic Party and Congressional run= Hamer at the Democratic National Convention, Atlantic City, New Jersey, August 1964 In 1964, Hamer helped co- found the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP), in an effort to prevent the regional all-white Democratic party's attempts to stifle African-American voices, and to ensure there was a party for all people that did not stand for any form of exploitation and discrimination (especially towards minorities). Following the founding of the MFDP, Hamer and other activists traveled to the 1964 Democratic National Convention to stand as the official delegation from the state of Mississippi. Hamer's televised testimony was interrupted because of a scheduled speech that President Lyndon B. Johnson delivered to thirty governors in the East Room of the White House. However, most of the major news networks broadcast her testimony later that evening to the nation, giving Hamer and the MFDP much exposure. Senator Hubert Humphrey tried to propose a compromise on behalf of the President that would give the Freedom Democratic Party two seats. He stated this would lead to a reformed convention in 1968. The MFDP rejected the compromise, with Hamer saying, \\"We didn't come all the way up here to compromise for no more than we'd gotten here. We didn't come all this way for no two seats when all of us is tired.\\" Afterwards, all of the white members from the Mississippi delegation walked out. In 1968 the MFDP was finally seated, after the Democratic Party adopted a clause which demanded equality of representation from their states' delegations. In 1972, Hamer was elected as a national party delegate. Freedom Farm Cooperative and later activism In 1964, Hamer unsuccessfully ran for a seat in the U.S. Senate. She continued to work on other projects, including grassroots-level Head Start programs and Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Poor People's Campaign. With the help of Julius Lester and Mary Varela, she published her autobiography in 1967. She said she was \\"tired of all this beating\\" and \\"there's so much hate. Only God has kept the Negro sane\\". Hamer sought equality across all aspects of society. In Hamer's view, African-Americans were not technically free if they were not afforded the same opportunities as whites, including those in the agricultural industry. Sharecropping was the most common form of post-slavery activity and income in the South. The New Deal era expanded so that many blacks were physically and economically displaced due to the various projects appearing around the country. Hamer did not wish to have blacks be dependent on any group for any longer; so, she wanted to give them a voice through an agricultural movement. James Eastland, a white senator, was among the groups of people who sought to keep African-Americans disenfranchised and segregated from society. His influence on the overarching agricultural industry often suppressed minority groups to keep whites as the only power force in America. Hamer objected to this, and consequently pioneered the Freedom Farm Cooperative (FFC) in 1969, an attempt to redistribute economic power across groups and to solidify an economic standing amongst African-Americans. In the same vein as the Freedom Farm Collective, Hamer partnered with the National Council of Negro Women (NCNW) to establish an interracial and interregional support program called The Pig Project to provide protein for people who previously could not afford meat. Hamer made it her mission to make land more accessible to African-Americans. To do this, she started a small \\"pig bank\\" with a starting donation from the NCNW of five boars and fifty gilts. Through the pig bank, a family could care for a pregnant female pig until it bore its offspring; subsequently, they would raise the piglets and use them for food and financial gain. Within five years, thousands of pigs were available for breeding. Hamer used the success of the bank to begin fundraising for the main farming corporation. She was able to convince the then-editor of the Harvard Crimson, James Fallows, to write an article that advocated for donations to the FFC. Eventually, the FFC had raised around $8,000 which allowed Hamer to purchase 40 acres of land previously owned by a black farmer who could no longer afford to occupy the land. This land became the Freedom Farm. The farm had three main objectives. These were to establish an agricultural organization that could supplement the nutritional needs of America's most disenfranchised people; to provide acceptable housing development; and to create an entrepreneurial business incubator that would provide resources for new companies and re-training for those with limited education but manual labor experience. Over time, the FFC offered various other services such as financial counseling, a scholarship fund and a housing agency. The FFC aided in securing 35 Federal Housing Administration (FHA) subsidized houses for struggling black families. Through her success, Hamer managed to acquire a new home, which served as inspiration for others to begin building themselves up. The FFC ultimately disbanded in 1975 due to lack of funding. In 1971 Hamer co- founded the National Women's Political Caucus. She emphasized the power women could hold by acting as a voting majority in the country regardless of race or ethnicity, saying \\"A white mother is no different from a black mother. The only thing is they haven't had as many problems. But we cry the same tears.\\" Later life and death While having surgery in 1961 to remove a tumor, 44-year-old Hamer was also given a hysterectomy without consent by a white doctor; this was a frequent occurrence under Mississippi's compulsory sterilization plan to reduce the number of poor blacks in the state. Hamer is credited with coining the phrase \\"Mississippi appendectomy\\" as a euphemism for the involuntary or uninformed sterilization of black women, common in the South in the 1960s. She came out of an extended period in hospital for nervous exhaustion in January 1972, and was hospitalized again in January 1974 for a nervous breakdown. By June 1974, Hamer was said to be in extremely poor health. Two years later she was diagnosed with and had surgery for breast cancer. Hamer died of complications of hypertension and breast cancer on March 14, 1977, aged 59, at Taborian Hospital, Mound Bayou, Mississippi. She was buried in her hometown of Ruleville, Mississippi. Her tombstone is engraved with one of her famous quotes, \\"I am sick and tired of being sick and tired.\\" Her primary memorial service, held at a church, was completely full. An overflow service was held at Ruleville Central High School, with over 1,500 people in attendance. Andrew Young, United States Ambassador to the United Nations, spoke at the RCHS service, saying \\"None of us would be where we are now had she not been there then\\". Honors and awards A sign honoring Fannie Lou Hamer for her work in Ruleville, Mississippi. Hamer received many awards both in her lifetime and posthumously. She received a Doctor of Law from Shaw University, and honorary degrees from Columbia College Chicago in 1970\\"Honorary Degrees Issued\\" , Library of Columbia College, Chicago, Illinois. and Howard University in 1972. She was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame in 1993. Hamer also received the Paul Robeson Award from Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, the Mary Church Terrell Award from Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, the National Sojourner Truth Meritorious Service Award. She is an honorary member of Delta Sigma Theta. A remembrance for her life was given in the US House of Representatives on the 100th anniversary of her birth, October 6, 2017, by Texas Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee. Tributes Fannie Lou Hamer Memorial Garden in Ruleville, Mississippi In 1970 Ruleville Central High School held a \\"Fannie Lou Hamer Day\\". Six years later, the City of Ruleville itself celebrated a \\"Fannie Lou Hamer Day\\". In 1977 Gil Scott- Heron and Brian Jackson wrote \\"95 South (All of the Places We've Been)\\", in Hamer's honor. Ta-Nehisi Coates described a 1994 live solo version of the song as \\"a haunting and somber ode.\\" In 1994 the Ruleville post office was named the Fannie Lou Hamer Post Office by an act of Congress. Additionally, The Fannie Lou Hamer National Institute on Citizenship and Democracy was founded in 1997 as a summer seminar and K‚Äì12 workshop program. In 2014 it was merged with the Council of Federated Organizations (COFO) Civil Rights Education Complex on the campus of Jackson State University, Jackson, to create the Fannie Lou Hamer Institute @ COFO: A Human and Civil Rights Interdisciplinary Education Center. The Hamer Institute @ COFO provides a research library and outreach programs. There is also a Fannie Lou Hamer Public Library in Jackson. A 2012 collection of suites by trumpeter and composer Wadada Leo Smith, who grew up in segregated Mississippi, Ten Freedom Summers includes \\"Fannie Lou Hamer and the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, 1964\\" as one of its 19 suites. A picture book about Hamer's life, Voice of Freedom: Fannie Lou Hamer, Spirit of the Civil Rights Movement, was written by Carole Boston Weatherford; it won a Coretta Scott King Award. Hamer is also one of 28 civil rights icons depicted on the Buffalo, New York Freedom Wall. And a quote from Hamer's speech at the 1964 Democratic National Convention is carved on one of the eleven granite columns at the Civil Rights Garden in Atlantic City, where the convention was held. Fannie Lou Hamer Freedom High School was formed in the Bronx, New York, with a focus on humanities and social justice. In 2017 the Fannie Lou Hamer Black Resource Center opened at the University of California at Berkeley. The third annual Women's March, held in Atlantic City, New Jersey on January 19, 2019, was dedicated to Hamer's life and legacy. Several hundred people attended, representing many organizations. Several students from Fannie Lou Hamer Freedom High School attended despite a state of emergency declared by New Jersey Governor Murphy due to an impending snowstorm.

Between the years 1935 and 1959, Republic, under Yates' leadership, made 956 feature films and 849 movie serial chapters, some of which are considered classics screened on television and later released on home video. Early years Yates was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1880. He started his business career at an early age, building a newspaper sales business on the streets of Brooklyn. Later, he ascended rapidly through the ranks of the American Tobacco Company, retiring from that company with a sizable fortune before the age of 30. Career Focusing on the movie and recording business, he built a small empire, acquiring record companies and film laboratories. In the 1920s he provided financing for Mack Sennett and Fatty Arbuckle. In October 1929 his Consolidated Film Industries took control of ARC, the American Record Corporation, a company created as a result of a merger between a number of small dime store record labels. In the following years, the company was heavily involved in a depressed market for phonograph records, buying up failing labels at bargain prices to exploit their catalogues. In December 1931 Warner Bros. leased Brunswick Records, Vocalion Records, and associated companies to ARC. By 1932 ARC was king of the 3-records-for-a-dollar market, selling 6 million units, twice as much as competitor RCA Victor. In an effort to get back on top RCA launched the low- priced Bluebird Records label. ARC bought out the Columbia Records catalogue in 1934. During the 1930s, ARC produced the Brunswick and Columbia labels at 75c each and the Oriole (for McCrory), Romeo (for Kress), Melotone, Vocalion, Banner, Conqueror (for Sears), and Perfect labels at 35c each, or 3 records for $1.00. In December 1938 the entire ARC complex was purchased from Consolidated Film for $700,000 by the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS). After CBS brought back Columbia as their flagship label, they brought back the inactive OKeh Records label to replace Vocalion, which allowed the rights to the Brunswick and Vocalion labels to return to Warner Bros. They sold the rights to those labels to Decca Records in the early 1940s. In a complicated move CBS managed to keep the rights to the ARC material from 1931 through 1938. Yates formed Republic Pictures in 1935 by arranging for the merger of several smaller production companies with his Consolidated Film Industries, which was providing film processing and financing for many Hollywood studios. Among the merged companies were Mascot Pictures, which brought the serial to Republic, and also purchased the Mack Sennett lot in Studio City and Monogram Pictures. Under Yates' leadership, Republic first leased then purchased the lot, expanding it from six stages to nineteen and adding state-of-the-art production facilities. In 1934 Gene Autry had his first film role in the Mascot production of In Old Santa Fe. Autry had been a recording artist under contract to Yates' American Record Corporation. He would go on to star in 56 feature films for Republic between 1935 and 1947. In 1938 Yates created a second American icon by giving Roy Rogers his first starring role in Under Western Stars. Rogers filled in for Autry during World War II and ended up making more than 80 films under the Republic banner. Republic's most acclaimed feature film was The Quiet Man (1952), directed by John Ford, and starring John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara. Ford had tried to make the Irish love story for years, but none of the studio heads would take a chance on it. Yates risked a budget of more than a million dollars, making possible the use of Technicolor (in lieu of Republic's own Trucolor process) and location filming in Ireland. It earned triple its cost, and earned Republic its only Academy Award nomination for Best Picture. Johnny Guitar (1954), directed by Nicholas Ray, starring Joan Crawford, became another well regarded Republic picture. Personal life In 1948 Yates left his wife Petra for the Czech figure skater Vera Hruba Ralston, the couple marrying in 1952. He employed Vera's brother Rudy Ralston as a producer at Republic. In 1958 Yates was accused of exploiting Republic for his own gain, in particular his promotion of his wife's career. It was alleged that 18 of her 20 films had been flops. He and Vera's relatives were pushed out of Republic and the film business in 1959, the same year Republic's board decided to switch emphasis from production to distribution, selling their controlling interest to Victor M. Carter for nearly $6 million. Yates became chairman of the board. Yates died at his residence in Sherman Oaks in 1966. Legacy The Republic lot survives today as CBS Studio Center. Notable among Yates' contributions to the lot are the Mabel Normand sound stage, built during World War II and later home to The Mary Tyler Moore Show, and an award-winning music scoring auditorium that has hosted such famous names as Aaron Copland and Artur Rubinstein.

Tracht () refers to traditional garments in German-speaking countries and regions. Although the word is most often associated with Bavarian, Austrian, South Tyrolian and Trentino garments, including lederhosen and dirndls, many other German-speaking peoples have them, as did the former Danube Swabian populations of Central Europe. Descriptions of different tracht customs In northern Germany some of the best known examples are the \\"Friesische Tracht\\" and the Finkenwerder Tracht. The \\"Friesische Tracht\\" is richly decorated with beads and embroidery. The quality of the work was a sign of the riches and social status of the wives wearing it. In former times it was brought into a marriage by the bride as part of her dowry. This costume is occasionally still worn at weddings. The \\"Finkenwerder Tracht\\" is the traditional garment of the inhabitants of an island in the Elbe river. It is worn by a local folklore group called Finkwarder Speeldeel. Visitors to the Black Forest region will be familiar with the wide brim hats decorated with big red pompons (known as Bollenhut) that are part of the Tracht in the three villages of Kirnbach, Gutach and Reichenbach. Displaced German peoples like the Sudetendeutsche often used events where they wore Tracht to emphasize their unity. Costumes worn by professional guilds, habits of religious orders, deaconesses, and the historical garment of some occupational groups (e.g. nurses) are also called \\"Tracht\\". While some of them have fallen into disuse, carpenter journeymen can still be seen wearing their traditional garment while traveling throughout Europe. History Folk costumes originated in rural areas. They showed that the wearer belonged to a particular social class, occupation, religious persuasion or ethnic group. In the country, the folk costumes developed differently from one another. They were influenced by urban fashions, costumes in neighbouring regions, available materials, as well as fashions in the royal courts and in the military. The earliest known folk costumes developed at the end of the 15th century. Although folk costumes varied in practice between everyday and festive versions, the festive version of each costume tradition was considered the ideal form. The history of tracht in the 19th century is inseparable from the history of the movement in German-speaking countries to promote folk costume (Trachtenbewegung). The idea of an approved folk costume dates back to the 18th century, and was promoted by the Swedish king Gustav III.Gustav III: Circulaire Til Pr√§sterskapet Uti Link√∂pings W√§llofliga Stift, R√∂rande en stadgad nationel Kl√§de-dr√§gts antagande, aldeles skild ifr√•n Fr√§mmande. Den 18. Martii 1778. Nr. 132. Link√∂ping 1778. At the beginning of the 19th century, enthusiasm for the different costumes of the rural population developed at the royal courts of Bavaria and Austria. The interest in traditional costume was part of a wider cultural response to the humiliations suffered through the repeated foreign invasions during the Napoleonic Wars. The German-speaking peoples investigated their cultural heritage as a reaffirmation of their identity. The result was a flowering of research and artistic work centred around Germanic cultural traditions, expressed in painting, literature, architecture, music and promotion of German language and folklore.Neil MacGregor, Germany: Memories of a nation, Penguin, London, 2016, pp. 112-130. The first extensive description of traditional tracht in the different regions was given by the Bavarian official Joseph von Hazzi (1768‚Äì1845). A comprehensive description of Bavarian national costumes was published in 1830 by the archivist Felix Joseph von Lipowsky. A parade of traditional costumes took place in 1835 at Oktoberfest, to celebrate the silver wedding anniversary of King Ludwig I of Bavaria and Queen Therese. Under his successor Maximilian II, traditional costumes were officially recognised as clothing suitable for wearing at the royal court. The king himself included officials wearing tracht in his court ceremonies and wrote in 1849 that he considered the wearing of traditional dress of \\"great importance\\" for national sentiment.Vereinigte Bayerische Trachtenverb√§nde (ed.): Bayrisch Land, bayrisch Gwand, geschichtlicher Beitrag zur Trachten- und Heimatpflege in Bayern, anl√§√ülich des 50. Gr√ºndungstages der Vereinigten Bayerischen Trachtenverb√§nde. Chiemgauer Verlagshaus ‚Äì Eigenverlag Vereinigte Bayerische Trachtenverb√§nde, Traunstein 1976, . In 1859, the first association to promote traditional costume was founded in Miesbach in Bavaria. In the following years, similar tracht associations (Trachtenvereine) were founded throughout Germany and Austria. The first umbrella organisation for the tracht associations was founded in 1890. Lipp, Franz C., Elisabeth L√§ngle, Gexi Tostmann, Franz Hubmann (eds.): Tracht in √ñsterreich. Geschichte und Gegenwart. Brandst√§tter, Vienna, 1984, . In 1895, the Bavarian novelist Maximilian Schmidt organized a parade of traditional costume at Oktoberfest, with 1,400 participants in 150 traditional costume groups.  Other uses  Originally, the word \\"Tracht\\" had a much wider meaning in German in the sense of \\"what is carried/worn/borne\\", as it is connected to the verb \\"tragen\\", meaning \\"to carry/wear/bear\\". So \\"Tracht\\" can refer to the clothes which are worn, but e.g. also simply to a load, which is carried (still used by beekeepers, referring to the load of honey carried in by the bees), or within the German idiom \\"eine Tracht Pr√ºgel\\" (a load (of) beating) to \\"a good beating\\".

The Vermaport SC system is designed to transport shopping carts between floors of a retail establishment, the Vermaport LC system is a Luggage Cart System for Airports to help travellers navigate multi-levels at Airports and works in a similar way to the Vermaport SC. The Vermaport RS is a Luggage Return System to transport or store luggage carts at airports or other transportation hubs (currently in operation in Schipol Airport, Amsterdam). The Vermaport systems are safer alternatives to inclined moving walkways, where a Vermaport system will take up about half as much space as a moving walkway. Vermaport SC The Vermaport SC (Shopping Cart) is typically used in multi-level retails stores such as Target and Kmart, Carrefour, as well as furniture store IKEA, and the retail chain Bed Bath and Beyond. The cart is in use in certain stores owned by Publix. Essentially an escalator, the device uses specially designed shopping carts and transports them between levels in shopping complexes. Vermaports level carts using three valleys. Specialized carts have their front wheels set closer together and thus not in line with the back, outset, wheels. For upwards travel, the inset wheels glide along the center valley, the outset wheels ride on the two higher outer valleys. This allows the shopping cart to stay level along an inclined path. On the way down, the center valley is higher and the side valleys are lower to allow the cart to transport level while facing down. Due to these valleys, shopping carts on the Vermaport SC do not have the typical plastic or metal grate shelf below the basket of the shopping cart that is used to carry large or bulk items. An installed Vermaport system is typically located next to an escalator, moving at the same speed, so as to allow a shopping cart to be transported alongside a shopper as he or she moves between floors. The can also be installed next to a fixed stairway which make them perfect for installation in existing buildings as well as new construction buildings. The conveyance is accomplished by a belt of hard rubber teeth that grab near the wheels of the cart as a shopper guides it into the entrance of the Vermaport. The world's largest Vermaport is located in Kmart in Middle Village, Queens, New York City, New York. It has a length of 120 ft (37 m) and a vertical rise of 50 ft (15 m). Safety procedures To use a Vermaport correctly, a customer should position the front end of the shopping cart through the swing-open double doors at the foot of the device and give a push until the cart is engaged by the drive chain. There should be a slight tug if this is done correctly. Once the cart is engaged, the customer boards the adjacent escalator, which travels in parallel with the Vermaport, to the top of the run. Once there, he or she can stand just to the left of the exit doors to wait for the cart to be pushed through. There are special sensors at the entry portal which will cause a shutdown of the unit if a human attempts to enter the trackway, or if the drive chain is jammed. If this happens, one should summon store personnel for assistance in restarting the unit. Parents should monitor their children in the vicinity of these portals to ensure that they do not go into the Vermaport lane to ensure their safety. Vermaport LC The Vermaport LC (Luggage Cart) is based on the same engineering principles and the SC model. It allows travellers and their luggage to travel between floors in transportation terminals such as an airport. The LC system allows for items wider than what would fit into a shopping cart on the Vermaport SC. Vermaport RS The Vermaport RS (Return System) is used to store luggage carts which are typically rental fee based. Personnel at an arrival or departure area will gather abandoned luggage carts and return them to the Vermaport RS. The carts will be automatically fed into the Vermaport and will wait for a traveler to retrieve one by inserting the required fee.

In summing up Justice's career David Orr wrote, \\"In most ways, Justice was no different from any number of solid, quiet older writers devoted to traditional short poems. But he was different in one important sense: sometimes his poems weren't just good; they were great. They were great in the way that Elizabeth Bishop's poems were great, or Thom Gunn's or Philip Larkin's. They were great in the way that tells us what poetry used to be, and is, and will be.\\" Life and career Justice grew up in Florida, and earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Miami in 1945. He received an M.A. from the University of North Carolina in 1947, studied for a time at Stanford University, and ultimately earned a doctorate from the University of Iowa in 1954. He went on to teach for many years at the Iowa Writers' Workshop, the nation's first graduate program in creative writing. He also taught at Syracuse University, the University of California at Irvine, Princeton University, the University of Virginia, and the University of Florida in Gainesville.Date of birth taken from the Social Security Death Index. Justice published thirteen collections of his poetry. The first collection, The Summer Anniversaries, was the winner of the Lamont Poetry Prize given by the Academy of American Poets in 1961; Selected Poems won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1980. He was awarded the Bollingen Prize in Poetry in 1991, and the Lannan Literary Award for Poetry in 1996. His honors also included grants from the Guggenheim Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the National Endowment for the Arts.

Dale Young, Ellen Bryant Voigt, Will Schmitz, Jorie Graham, William Stafford, and the novelist John Irving.\\" His student and later colleague Marvin Bell said in a reminiscence, \\"As a teacher, Don chose always to be on the side of the poem, defending it from half-baked attacks by students anxious to defend their own turf. While he had firm preferences in private, as a teacher Don defended all turfs. He had little use for poetic theory...\\" Of Justice's accomplishments as a poet, his former student, the poet and critic Tad Richards, noted that \\"Donald Justice is likely to be remembered as a poet who gave his age a quiet but compelling insight into loss and distance, and who set a standard for craftsmanship, attention to detail, and subtleties of rhythm.\\"Richards, Tad (2005). \\"Donald Justice,\\" Greenwood Encyclopedia of American Poets and Poetry (Greenwood Press). .

It was humorous, and even pushed the envelope of National Lampoon's lack of political correctness; the magazine's lawyers refused publication of one panel in a subsequently published story.

It allows a wireless network to be expanded using multiple access points without the traditional requirement for a wired backbone to link them. The notable advantage of WDS over other solutions is that it preserves the MAC addresses of client frames across links between access points.Wireless Distribution System Linked Router Network DD-WRT Wiki. Retrieved December 31, 2006. An access point can be either a main, relay, or remote base station. * A main base station is typically connected to the (wired) Ethernet. * A relay base station relays data between remote base stations, wireless clients, or other relay stations; to either a main, or another relay base station. * A remote base station accepts connections from wireless clients and passes them on to relay stations or to main stations. Connections between \\"clients\\" are made using MAC addresses. All base stations in a wireless distribution system must be configured to use the same radio channel, method of encryption (none, WEP, WPA or WPA2) and the same encryption keys. They may be configured to different service set identifiers (SSIDs). WDS also requires every base station to be configured to forward to others in the system. WDS may also be considered a repeater mode because it appears to bridge and accept wireless clients at the same time (unlike traditional bridging). However, with the repeater method, throughput is halved for all clients connected wirelessly. This is because Wi- Fi is an inherently half duplex medium and therefore any Wi-Fi device functioning as a repeater must use the Store and forward method of communication. WDS may be incompatible between different products (even occasionally from the same vendor) since the IEEE 802.11-1999 standard does not define how to construct any such implementations or how stations interact to arrange for exchanging frames of this format. The IEEE 802.11-1999 standard merely defines the 4-address frame format that makes it possible. IEEE: 4-address-format.doc Technical WDS may provide two modes of access point- to-access point (AP-to-AP) connectivity: * Wireless bridging, in which WDS APs (AP-to-AP on sitecom routers AP) communicate only with each other and don't allow wireless stations (STA) (also known as wireless clients) to access them * Wireless repeating, in which APs (WDS on sitecom routers) communicate with each other and with wireless STAs Two disadvantages to using WDS are: * The maximum wireless effective throughput may be halved after the first retransmission (hop) being made. For example, in the case of two APs connected via WDS, and communication is made between a computer which is plugged into the Ethernet port of AP A and a laptop which is connected wirelessly to AP B. The throughput is halved, because AP B has to retransmit the information during the communication of the two sides. However, in the case of communications between a computer which is plugged into the Ethernet port of AP A and a computer which is plugged into the Ethernet port of AP B, the throughput is not halved since there is no need to retransmit the information. Dual band/radio APs may avoid this problem, by connecting to clients on one band/radio, and making a WDS network link with the other. * Dynamically assigned and rotated encryption keys are usually not supported in a WDS connection. This means that dynamic Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) and other dynamic key assignment technology in most cases cannot be used, though WPA using pre-shared keys is possible. This is due to the lack of standardization in this field, which may be resolved with the upcoming 802.11s standard. As a result, only static WEP or WPA keys may be used in a WDS connection, including any STAs that associate to a WDS repeating AP. OpenWRT, a universal third party router firmware, supports WDS with WPA-PSK, WPA2-PSK, WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK Mixed-Mode encryption modes. Recent Apple base stations allow WDS with WPA, though in some cases firmware updates are required. Firmware for the Renasis SAP36g super access point and most third party firmware for the Linksys WRT54G(S)/GL support AES encryption using WPA2-PSK mixed-mode security, and TKIP encryption using WPA-PSK, while operating in WDS mode. However, this mode may not be compatible with other units running stock or alternate firmware. Example Suppose you have a Wi-Fi-capable game console. This device needs to send one packet to a WAN host, and get one packet in reply. Network 1: A wireless base station acting as a simple (non-WDS) wireless router. The packet leaves the game console, goes over-the-air to the router, which then transmits it across the WAN. One packet comes back, through the router, which transmits it wirelessly to the game console. Total packets sent over-the-air: 2. Network 2: Two wireless base stations employing WDS: WAN connects to the master base station, that connects over-the-air to the remote base station, which talks over-the-air to the game console. The game console sends one packet over-the- air to the remote, which forwards it over-the-air to the master, which sends it to the WAN. Reply comes from the WAN to the master base station, over-the- air to the remote, and then over-the-air again to the game console. Total packets sent over-the-air: 4. Network 3: Two wireless base stations employing WDS, but this time the game console connects by Ethernet cable to the remote base station. One packet goes from the game console over cable to the remote, from there by air to the master, and on to the WAN. Reply comes from WAN to master, over-the-air to remote, over cable to game console. Total packets sent over-the-air: 2. Notice that network 1 (non-WDS) and network 3 (WDS) send the same number of packets over-the-air. The only slowdown is the potential halving due to the half-duplex nature of Wi-Fi. But network 2 gets an additional halving because the remote base station uses double the air time because it's retransmitting over-the-air packets that it has just received over-the-air. This is the halving that is usually attributed to WDS, but that halving only happens when the route through a base station uses over-the-air links on both sides of it. That does not always happen in a WDS, and can happen in non-WDS. Important Note: This \\"double hop\\" (one wireless hop from the main station to the remote station, and a second hop from the remote station to the wireless client [game console]) is not necessarily twice as slow. End to end latency introduced here is in the \\"store and forward\\" delay associated with the remote station forwarding packets. In order to accurately identify the true latency contribution of relaying through a wireless remote station vs. simply increasing the broadcast power of the main station, more comprehensive tests specific to the environment would be required.

J. Soles, Vince Van Patten, Clint Howard and Dey Young. The film featured the punk rock group Ramones.  Plot  The movie is set in 1980. Vince Lombardi High School keeps losing principals to nervous breakdowns because of the students' love of rock 'n' roll and their disregard for education. The leader of the students, Riff Randell (P. J. Soles), is the biggest Ramones fan at school. She waits in line for three days to get tickets to see the band, hoping to meet Joey Ramone so she can give him a song she wrote for the band, \\"Rock 'n' Roll High School\\". When the tyrannical Principal Togar (Mary Woronov) takes her ticket away, Riff and her best friend Kate Rambeau (Dey Young) have to find another way to meet their heroes‚Äîby winning a radio contest. When Miss Togar and a group of parents attempt to burn a pile of rock records, the students, joined by the Ramones (who are made honorary students) overthrow the teachers and hall monitors to take over the high school, with Miss Togar asking the musicians \\"Do your parents know you're Ramones?\\" When the police are summoned and demand that the students evacuate the building, they do so, but then the students and the Ramones burn down the school as a final act of youthful rebellion.  Cast  * P. J.

The initial title Disco High was selected for a story idea from Allan Arkush and Joe Dante. A script was developed by Richard Whitley, Russ Dvonch and Joseph McBride. During this time, the film went through several different title changes including Heavy Metal Kids and Girl's Gym. Arkush directed the majority of the film, but Dante also helped when Arkush was suffering from exhaustion. Corman originally wanted Cheap Trick or Todd Rundgren to play the band, but due to a conflict of schedules, he was forced to find an alternative. The Ramones were suggested by Paul Bartel, one of the actors in the film. The genesis for the plot was a favorite story told to the film's original writer by his father, Raymond E. McBride of the Milwaukee Journal, who staged a walkout from his Superior (Wis.) Central High school in the 1920s. The film was shot on the campus of the defunct Mount Carmel High School in South Central Los Angeles, that had been closed in 1976. The actual demolition of the school was used in the end of the film. The explosion of the school was so great that many on the set were scared away by the blast and, temporarily, would not return. Another location was at Mira Costa High School in Manhattan Beach, California. The American football uniforms and cheer- leading outfits were those from MCHS.  Release  The film was originally released to theaters on August 24, 1979. = Home media = Rock 'n' Roll High School was originally released on VHS by Warner Home Video in 1983, and was later released on VHS in 1996 by New Horizons Home Video (). One year later, in 1997, it was released on DVD by Lumivision. A second DVD release occurred in 1999 from Slingshot. Shortly after Joey Ramone's death in 2001, a third DVD release came out from New Concorde. The movie was released on DVD again in 2005 by Buena Vista Home Entertainment ( ). DVDs were released in the PAL format by Umbrella Entertainment in 2003 () and again in 2007 (). The film is a part of Shout! Factory's Roger Corman Cult Classics series, reissued on DVD in May 2010. Shout! Factory released the film with exclusive content on Blu- ray on May 11, 2010https://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Rock-n-Roll-High-School-Blu- ray/9217/ and again on November 19, 2019 with a new 4K restoration.https://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Rock-n-Roll-High-School-Blu- ray/250151/  Soundtrack  A soundtrack album on Sire/Warner Bros. Records was released around the same time, but it included only a limited number of songs from the film. The two main Ramones songs in the film‚Äîthe title song and \\"I Want You Around\\"‚Äîwere recorded by Ed Stasium but remixed by Phil Spector for the soundtrack album. The original Ed Stasium mixes were not issued until the compilation album Ramones Mania (1988) and the compilation album Hey! Ho! Let's Go: The Anthology (1999), respectively. Other songs appearing in the film include the following: * Bent Fabric ‚Äì \\"Alley Cat\\" * Brian Eno ‚Äì \\"Spirits Drifting\\" * Brian Eno ‚Äì \\"Alternative 3\\" * Brian Eno ‚Äì \\"M386\\" * Fleetwood Mac ‚Äì \\"Albatross\\" * Fleetwood Mac ‚Äì \\"Jigsaw Puzzle Blues\\" * Paul McCartney ‚Äì \\"Did We Meet Somewhere Before?\\" * MC5 ‚Äì \\"High School\\" * The Paley Brothers ‚Äì \\"You're the Best\\" * The Velvet Underground ‚Äì \\"Rock & Roll\\" As well as the following songs by the Ramones: * \\"Blitzkrieg Bop\\" * \\"Do You Wanna Dance?\\" * \\"I Just Want to Have Something to Do\\" * \\"I Wanna Be Sedated\\" * \\"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend\\" * \\"Questioningly\\" * \\"Sheena Is a Punk Rocker\\"  Reception  Rock 'n' Roll High School received generally positive reviews and has an 81% rating at Rotten Tomatoes based on reviews from 26 film critics. Rock 'n' Roll High School did well enough that Arkush and Whitley followed it up with a sequel, Rock 'n' Roll High School Forever (1991). This sequel was not as well received as its predecessor, as it received mixed to negative reviews, earning a 4.9/10 on IMDb and a 2.5/5 on Letterboxd.  Remake  On July 31, 2008, it was announced that actor/writer Alex Winter had been hired to script a remake of the film for Howard Stern's production company.

It was one of the first products in this market segment. In 2005, Cisco introduced the newer Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (Cisco ASA), that inherited many of the PIX features, and in 2008 announced PIX end-of-sale. The PIX technology was sold in a blade, the FireWall Services Module (FWSM), for the Cisco Catalyst 6500 switch series and the 7600 Router series, but has reached end of support status as of September 26, 2007.http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/interfaces- modules/catalyst-6500-series-firewall-services-module/model.html PIX = History = PIX was originally conceived in early 1994 by John Mayes of Redwood City, California and designed and coded by Brantley Coile of Athens, Georgia. The PIX name is derived from its creators' aim of creating the functional equivalent of an IP PBX to solve the then-emerging registered IP address shortage. At a time when NAT was just being investigated as a viable approach, they wanted to conceal a block or blocks of IP addresses behind a single or multiple registered IP addresses, much as PBXs do for internal phone extensions. When they began, RFC 1597 and RFC 1631 were being discussed, but the now-familiar RFC 1918 had not yet been submitted. The design, and testing were carried out in 1994 by John Mayes, Brantley Coile and Johnson Wu of Network Translation, Inc., with Brantley Coile being the sole software developer. Beta testing of PIX serial number 000000 was completed and first customer acceptance was on December 21, 1994 at KLA Instruments in San Jose, California. The PIX quickly became one of the leading enterprise firewall products and was awarded the Data Communications Magazine \\"Hot Product of the Year\\" award in January 1995. Shortly before Cisco acquired Network Translation in November 1995, Mayes and Coile hired two longtime associates, Richard (Chip) Howes and Pete Tenereillo, and shortly after acquisition 2 more longtime associates, Jim Jordan and Tom Bohannon. Together they continued development on Finesse OS and the original version of the Cisco PIX Firewall, now known as the PIX \\"Classic\\". During this time, the PIX shared most of its code with another Cisco product, the LocalDirector. On January 28, 2008, Cisco announced the end-of-sale and end-of-life dates for all Cisco PIX Security Appliances, software, accessories, and licenses. The last day for purchasing Cisco PIX Security Appliance platforms and bundles was July 28, 2008. The last day to purchase accessories and licenses was January 27, 2009. Cisco ended support for Cisco PIX Security Appliance customers on July 29, 2013. In May 2005, Cisco introduced the ASA which combines functionality from the PIX, VPN 3000 series and IPS product lines. The ASA series of devices run PIX code 7.0 and later. Through PIX OS release 7.x the PIX and the ASA use the same software images. Beginning with PIX OS version 8.x, the operating system code diverges, with the ASA using a Linux kernel and PIX continuing to use the traditional Finesse/PIX OS combination. = Software = The PIX runs a custom-written proprietary operating system originally called Finese (Fast Internet Service Executive), but the software is known simply as PIX OS. Though classified as a network-layer firewall with stateful inspection, technically the PIX would more precisely be called a Layer 4, or Transport Layer Firewall, as its access is not restricted to Network Layer routing, but socket-based connections (a port and an IP Address: port communications occur at Layer 4). By default it allows internal connections out (outbound traffic), and only allows inbound traffic that is a response to a valid request or is allowed by an Access Control List (ACL) or by a conduit. Administrators can configure the PIX to perform many functions including network address translation (NAT) and port address translation (PAT), as well as serving as a virtual private network (VPN) endpoint appliance. The PIX became the first commercially available firewall product to introduce protocol specific filtering with the introduction of the \\"fixup\\" command. The PIX \\"fixup\\" capability allows the firewall to apply additional security policies to connections identified as using specific protocols. Protocols for which specific fixup behaviors were developed include DNS and SMTP. The DNS fixup originally implemented a very simple but effective security policy; it allowed just one DNS response from a DNS server on the Internet (known as outside interface) for each DNS request from a client on the protected (known as inside) interface. \\"Inspect\\" has superseded \\"fixup\\" in later versions of PIX OS. The Cisco PIX was also one of the first commercially available security appliances to incorporate IPSec VPN gateway functionality. Administrators can manage the PIX via a command line interface (CLI) or via a graphical user interface (GUI). They can access the CLI from the serial console, telnet and SSH. GUI administration originated with version 4.1, and it has been through several incarnations: * PIX Firewall Manager (PFM) for PIX OS versions 4.x and 5.x, which runs locally on a Windows NT client * PIX Device Manager (PDM) for PIX OS version 6.x, which runs over https and requires Java * Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) for PIX OS version 7 and greater, which can run locally on a client or in reduced-functionality mode over HTTPS. Because Cisco acquired the PIX from Network Translation, the CLI originally did not align with the Cisco IOS syntax. Starting with version 7.0, the configuration became much more IOS-like. = Hardware = PIX 515 with top cover removed The original NTI PIX and the PIX Classic had cases that were sourced from OEM provider Appro. All flash cards and the early encryption acceleration cards, the PIX-PL and PIX-PL2, were sourced from Productivity Enhancement Products (PEP). Later models had cases from Cisco OEM manufacturers. The PIX was constructed using Intel-based/Intel-compatible motherboards; the PIX 501 used an AMD 5x86 processor, and all other standalone models used Intel 80486 through Pentium III processors. The PIX boots off a proprietary ISA flash memory daughtercard in the case of the NTI PIX, PIX Classic, 10000, 510, 520, and 535, and it boots off integrated flash memory in the case of the PIX 501, 506/506e, 515/515e, 525, and WS-SVC-FWM-1-K9. The latter is the part code for the PIX technology implemented in the Fire Wall Services Module, for the Catalyst 6500 and the 7600 Router.  Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA)  The Adaptive Security Appliance is a network firewall made by Cisco. It was introduced in 2005 to replace the Cisco PIX line. Along with stateful firewall functionality another focus of the ASA is Virtual Private Network (VPN) functionality. It also features Intrusion Prevention and Voice over IP. The ASA 5500 series was followed up by the 5500-X series. The 5500-X series focuses more on virtualization than it does on hardware acceleration security modules. = History = In 2005 Cisco released the 5510, 5520, and 5540 models. = Software = The ASA continues using the PIX codebase but, when the ASA OS software transitioned from major version 7.X to 8.X, it moved from the Finesse/Pix OS operating system platform to the Linux operating system platform. It also integrates features of the Cisco IPS 4200 Intrusion prevention system, and the Cisco VPN 3000 Concentrator.http://www.ingrammicro.de/pdf/6778857.pdf = Hardware = The ASA continues the PIX lineage of Intel 80x86 hardware.  Security vulnerabilities  The Cisco PIX VPN product was hacked by the NSA-tied group Equation Group somewhere before 2016. Equation Group developed a tool code- named BENIGNCERTAIN that reveals the pre-shared password(s) to the attacker (). Equation Group was later hacked by another group called The Shadow Brokers, which published their exploit publicly, among others. According to Ars Technica, the NSA likely used this vulnerability to wiretap VPN- connections for more than a decade, citing the Snowden leaks. The Cisco ASA- brand was also hacked by Equation Group. The vulnerability requires that both SSH and SNMP are accessible to the attacker. The codename given to this exploit by NSA was EXTRABACON. The bug and exploit () was also leaked by The ShadowBrokers, in the same batch of exploits and backdoors. According to Ars Technica, the exploit can easily be made to work against more modern versions of Cisco ASA than what the leaked exploit can handle. On the 29th of January 2018 a security problem at the Cisco ASA-brand was disclosed by Cedric Halbronn from the NCC Group. A use after free-bug in the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) VPN functionality of the Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected system or to remotely execute code.

It can be launched in still air, and on level ground, by the pilot alone ‚Äî no assistance is required. In many countries, including the United States, powered paragliding is minimally regulated and requires no licence. The ability to fly both low and slow safely, the \\"open\\" feel, the minimal equipment and maintenance costs, and the portability are claimed to be this type of flying's greatest merits. Powered paragliders usually fly between at altitudes from 'foot-dragging on the water' up about to or more with certain permission although most flying is done under AGL. Due to the paramotor's slow forward speed and nature of a soft wing, it is not safe in high winds, turbulence, or intense thermal activity. The paramotor, weighing from is supported by the pilot during takeoff. After a brief run (typically ) the wing lifts the motor and its harnessed pilot off the ground. After takeoff, the pilot gets into the seat and sits suspended beneath the inflated paraglider wing like a pendulum. Control is available using brake toggles for roll and a hand-held throttle for pitch. Prices for a complete new package (wing, harness, and motor) vary from approximately US$8,000 to $15,000.  Uses  The uses for paragliders may vary, but it is most commonly used for personal and recreational use. = Military = Powered paragliding has seen a large growth in the military including insertion of special forces soldiers and also Border Patrol in many governments. The Lebanese Airborne regiment adopted this technique in 2008. Currently, the US Army, and Egyptian Army have used Paramotor Inc FX Series units for many years, and still under production. = Civilian = Powered paragliders are useful as replacements for terrestrial vehicles in difficult terrain. In some areas during the spring when the sea or lakes are still frozen but the ice has begun melting, the waters cannot be walked, skied, or driven on and cannot be navigated by boat. Hydrocopters, hovercraft, and aircraft are the only ways to travel in such conditions. Furthermore, if the landscape is fractured by small and shallow lakes and bays, as in swamplands, it may be difficult to navigate even in good conditions. Observation and counting of protected species, e.g. Saimaa ringed seal, in such conditions has been conducted using a powered paraglider. Another use that has been demonstrated is the herding of reindeer. Although the tundra is open terrain, there are no roads and the terrain is still uneven. A powered parachute can be used instead of a snowmobile or a motorcycle.  Safety and regulations  Research estimates that the activity is slightly safer (per event) than riding motorcycles and more dangerous than riding in cars.Jeff Goin , March 2012 The most likely cause of serious injury is body contact with a spinning propeller. The next most likely cause of injury is flying into something other than the landing zone. Some countries run detailed statistics on accidents, e.g. in Germany 2018 about 36.000 paragliding pilots registered 232 accidents, where 109 caused serious injury and 9 were fatal . Some pilots carry a reserve parachute designed to open in as little as . While reserve parachutes are designed to open fast, they have a system length between 13.3 ft (4.5 m) and 21.9 ft (7.3 m)Reserve Parachute Manual (contain system lentgh [m]): http://www.x-dreamfly.ch/wp- content/uploads/2019/01/X-TWO_90110130_manual-packing_0119.pdf and usually need at least to slow down a pilot to a safe sink rate (certified design speed according to LTF and EN certifications is max per second). With enough height over ground many potential issues with the canopy can be resolved without applying the reserve parachute. The required skills can be acquired in SIV trainings, which improve the over all safety of flying by providing a better understand on the system limitations and practical training of extreme situations. The lack of established design criteria for these aircraft led the British Air Accidents Investigation Branch to conclude in 2007 that \\"Only when precise reserve factors have been established for individual harness/wing combinations carrying realistic suspended masses, at load factors appropriate to the maneuvers to be carried out, can these aircraft be considered to be structurally safe\\".UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch \\"Bulletin S4/2007 Special\\" , August 2007 = Noise = Paramotor noise relative to an observer depends on distance, loudness, frequency and timbre of the power unit. Most noise comes from the propeller and slow rpm is perceived as the quietest. Pilots mitigate their sound impact by leaving a noise-sensitive area at low power, keeping the farthest practical distance away, and reducing time spent near the area. =License and training= Neither a license nor specific training is required in the U.S., U.K. or many other countries. Where there is no specific regulation (e.g. Mexico), paramotor flying is tolerated provided the pilots cooperate with local officials when appropriate. In countries where specific regulation exists, such as Canada, France, Italy, and South Africa, pilots must be trained, both in flying theory and practice, by licensed instructors. Some countries that require formal certification frequently do so through non-government ultralight aviation organizations. Regardless of regulations, powered paragliding can be dangerous when practiced without proper training. For a pilot to get through most organizations' full pilot syllabus requires between 5 and 15 days which, due to weather, may include far more calendar time. A number of techniques are employed for teaching, although most include getting the student familiar with handling the wing either on the ground, via towing, small hills, or on tandem flights. With special gear it is possible to take a passenger (tandem), but most countries, including the U.S., require some form of certification to do so. =Regulations= In most countries, paramotor pilots operate under simple rules that spare them certification requirements for pilot and gear. Those laws, however, limit where they can fly‚Äîspecifying that pilots avoid congested areas and larger airports to minimize risk to other people or aircraft. U.S. pilots operate under Federal Aviation Administration regulation Part 103. In the United Kingdom Paramotors are regulated by the Civil Aviation Authority, Paramotors are classified as Self-Propelled Hang-Gliders, and can be flown without registration or a license as long as they weigh less than 70KG, have a stall speed not exeeding 35knots, and are foot-launched https://publicapps.caa.co.uk/docs/33/CAP393_Fifth_edition_Amendment_13_March_2019.pdf?fbclid=IwAR1UqAYCOc6boMNiXXoCB8cCquE8QF3dHE_nCplNacfNNW879ENdvGDzo_E. Wheel-launched paramotors are allowed under the additional conditions that they do not carry passengers, and have a stall speed of 20 knots or less, but may weigh up to 75KG if they carry a reserve parachute https://publicapps.caa.co.uk/docs/33/ORS4No1366Final.pdf  Associations  In the U.S., the sport is represented primarily by the US Powered Paragliding Association (USPPA)Unpowered paragliders are represented by the U.S. Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association (USHPA), which distanced itself from any motorized flying in 2006. which also holds an exemption allowing two-place training by appropriately certified tandem instructors. The US Ultralight Association (USUA) and Aero Sports Connections (ASC) also offer some support. Instructors in the U.S. are primarily represented and certified by the United States Powered Paragliding Association (USPPA). Other organizations include the Professional Association of Powered Paragliding Instructors (PAPPI). In Britain the sport is represented by the British Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association and unofficially by the Paramotor Club.  Trikes and powered parachutes  A powered paraglider trike landing Lightweight carts or \\"trikes\\" (called \\"quads\\" if they have four wheels) can also be mounted on powered paragliders for those who prefer not to, or are unable to, foot launch. Some are permanent units. In the United States, if the aircraft meets the ultralight definitions, no license is required. In the UK, trike-mounted paramotors are still classified as \\"self-propelled hang-gliders\\" if the \\"performance of the aircraftremains equivalent to one that can be foot- launched.\\"https://publicapps.caa.co.uk/docs/33/ORS41253.pdf However, if the machine has two seats it is no longer an ultralight. In the US such a craft would be governed under the sport pilot rules, and regulated as a light sport aircraft powered parachute, which requires an aircraft N-number, and pilots must be licensed. A powered paraglider differs from a powered parachute (PPC) primarily in size, power, control method, and number of occupants. Powered paragliders are smaller, use more efficient (but more difficult to manage) paraglider wings, and steer with brake toggles like sport parachutists. Powered parachutes typically use easier-to-manage but less efficient wings, have larger engines, are steered by foot and may be able to take along passengers. There are exceptions; a growing number of powered parachutes use elliptical wings, some use hand controls, and many are light single seat aircraft that meet FAA Part 103 requirements.  World records  Determined by the FAI, RPF1 category. * The current world altitude record for powered paragliders (RPF1TM) is 7,589m (24 898 ft). It was set by Ramon Morillas Salmeron (Granada, Spain) on 19 September 2009 while flying an Advance Sigma paraglider and a PAP frame powered by a HE R220Duo engine. * A highly publicized altitude record attempt was made by Bear Grylls on 14 May 2007 at 0933 local time over the Himalayas using a Parajet engine invented by Gilo Cardozo and a specifically designed reflex paraglider wing invented by Mike Campbell-Jones of Paramania. Cardozo, who also flew in the attempt, had engine problems that ended his climb 300m short of the record. Grylls went on to claim an altitude of 8,990m (29,494 ft), though satisfactory evidence of this claim was not submitted to FAI, and therefore it was not ratified as a world record for this aircraft class. * Distance in a straight line without landing: set on 23 April 2007 by Ramon Morillas Salmeron flying from Jerez de la Frontera, C√°diz (Spain) to Lanzarote, Canary Islands (Spain) with an Advance Omega 7 paraglider. Determined by Guinness World Records *The longest journey by powered paraglider is 9,132 km (5,674.35 mi) and was achieved by Miroslav Oros (Czech Republic), flying throughout the Czech Republic, starting in Sazen√° and ending in Lipov√•-l√°zn, between 1 April 2011 and 30 June 2011. *2nd Longest Journey by Powered Paraglider: set on 24 August 2009 by Canadian photographer and documentary filmmaker Benjamin Jordan during his Above + Beyond Canada campaign. In an unprecedented flight between Tofino, BC and Bay Saint Lawrence, NS, the cross-Canada campaign involved 108 flights with landings at schools and youth summer camps along the way. Jordan provided youth with motivational speeches and arranged them in shapes on the ground before launching and continuing on the next leg of his journey. Funds raised over the course of the trip were donated to various charities across Canada to help children from low-income homes attend summer camp.

It was shot in the Bahamas. The film was a critical and commercial failure. Plot Master thief Max Burdett (Pierce Brosnan) and his beautiful accomplice, Lola Cirillo (Salma Hayek), steal the second of three famous diamonds, known as the Napoleon diamonds, from FBI Agent Stanley P. Lloyd (Woody Harrelson). But Lloyd shoots Max before passing out from being gassed by the thieves. Max survives and tells Lola to get the diamond. She does, leaving in its place the one-dollar bill that she had received as a tip for washing the agents' windshield (while in disguise). Max and Lola then fly to Paradise Island in The Bahamas. Agent Stanley P. Lloyd shows up 6 months later and accuses Burdett of planning to steal the third Napoleon diamond, which is on a cruise ship that will be docking for a week on the island. He denies this, and unwittingly turns the tables and befriends the frustrated detective Lloyd, showing him the pleasures that Paradise Island has to offer, even paying for the most expensive suite, the bridge suite, for as long as Lloyd is there. Lloyd, out of his element, adapts quickly to the easy-going Caribbean lifestyle and partners up with Sophia, a local constable, to try to capture Max at last when he steals the diamond, which Max visits and later gives in to the temptation to steal. Henri Moor√©, a powerful, popular tycoon thought of by some as a gangster, learns of Burdett's impressive history as a thief and offers him additional island-life benefits and pleasures in return for stealing the diamond. Burdett, still wanting the diamond for himself, pretends to work with Moor√©, and gives him a fake plan as to how he would steal the diamond (which he had earlier related to Stan), having no trouble keeping ahead of his nemesis in the meantime. Lola kicks Max out after he breaks his promise to spend their first sunset on her new deck she had been working on and after she finds out he lied about writing his vows to her. Max is forced to bunk with Stan, and they share their thoughts about each other's lives. The next morning, the authorities and Sophie discover them, revealing that Stan's FBI license is suspended. They team up to win back Sophia and Lola, but Max still gives in and uses the dive trip as a distraction to steal the diamond, which works perfectly when Moor√©'s man tries at the same time is a caught after the fake plan doesn't work. After the fallout, Lola leaves Max after Lloyd shoots Moor√© dead when he comes for the diamond. Max realizes his error, writes his vows, and manages to win back Lola at the airport before she leaves, proposing to her with \\"the first diamond he ever bought\\". The next day, Max is met by Stan while celebrating, who reveals he set him up and let Max do all the work while he later recovered the diamond. Max concedes that his nemesis has won this time, and is simply happy to live out his life with Lola, watching sunsets. However, he has fun with Stan when he tries to leave by remote controlling his car again, promising Lola it was the last time. Cast * Pierce Brosnan as Max Burdett * Salma Hayek as Lola Cirillo * Woody Harrelson as Stan Lloyd * Don Cheadle as Henri Moor√© * Naomie Harris as Sophie * Rex Linn as Agent Kowalski, a fellow FBI agent. * Mykelti Williamson as Agent Stafford * Troy Garity as Luc * Obba Babatund√© as Zacharias * Michael Bowen as FBI Driver * Russell Hornsby as Jean-Paul, Moor√©'s bodyguard * Mark Moses as Lakers FBI Agent * Chris Penn as Rowdy Fan * Joel McKinnon Miller as Wendell * Alan Dale as Security Chief * No√©mie Lenoir as Moor√©'s Girl * John Michael Higgins as Hotel Manager (uncredited) The film also features several cameos, including Gary Payton, Karl Malone, Phil Jackson, Jeff Garlin, Dyan Cannon, Edward Norton and Shaquille O'Neal as themselves. Production Paul Zbyszewski's original screenplay for After the Sunset was discovered by producers Beau Flynn and Tripp Vinson, both known for producing movies such as Tigerland (2000) and Requiem for a Dream (2000). The script was purchased by New Line Cinema and the producers hired Australian screenwriter Craig Rosenberg to create a re-write. Both the studio and the producers agreed that their first choice for the role of master thief Max Burdett was Pierce Brosnan. Salma Hayek, Oscar-nominated for her role in Frida (2002), was the next actor to join the cast. Next to join the cast was director Brett Ratner. The film had originally been scheduled to be directed by John Stockwell but dropped out due to creative differences. Talking about joining the movie, Ratner said: \\"I love caper films. There are so many great films in this genre, but what makes After the Sunset different is that it's a heist movie that has a combination of great relationships, heart, and comedy.\\" Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan were both offered film cameos as police officers (a nod to the Rush Hour series which Brett Ratner also directed) but turned them down. With the two leads set, Woody Harrelson was cast in the role of Burdett's nemesis, FBI agent Stanley Lloyd. Harrelson said during promotion: \\"When this movie came along, I loved it right away.\\" Don Cheadle's casting marked a third collaboration with Ratner, following The Family Man (2000) and Rush Hour 2 (2001). The role of Sophie, the Bahamian cop, was the next role to be cast. British actress Naomie Harris landed the role. With the majority of the script set on an island in the Caribbean, the filmmakers decided to shoot in The Bahamas, based out of the Atlantis resort in Nassau. Reception =Box office= The film opened at number 3 in North America, earning $11,100,392 in its opening weekend, with its widest release in 2,819 theaters. It grossed $28,331,233 domestically and $33,016,564 in international markets, adding up to a worldwide gross of $61,347,797. =Critical response= After the Sunset has an 18% approval rating based on 140 reviews from critics at the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, with the critical consensus \\"A slick but bland thriller.\\" At the website Metacritic, which utilizes a normalized rating system, the film earned a rating of 38/100 based on 32 reviews. Ty Burr from The Boston Globe saw the film's potential as a \\"decent heist flick\\" during the opening robbery scene but felt it devolves into a plotless drag involving sightseeing and female-ogling in the Bahamas. Peter Howell of the Toronto Star gave note of Zbyszewski and Rosenberg's script feeling barebones within its given genre and moving \\"unsteadily between crime drama and romantic farce\\", and Ratner's direction matching it in terms of tonal whiplash and coming across like a \\"tourist infomercial,\\" calling it \\"one of the most lackadaisical Hollywood projects of the year.\\" Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club criticized Ratner and Zbyszewski for making a \\"pale revision\\" of Michael Mann's Heat that sidesteps both the heist and interesting characters for more macho posturing and homophobic humor between its two male leads. Entertainment Weeklys Owen Gleiberman gave the film a B‚àí grade, calling it \\"a knowingly preposterous toy thriller--a sheer escape from consequence.\\" Roger Ebert pointed out the numerous plot machinations and \\"behavior-circling clich√©s\\" amongst the characters throughout the film but gave it credit for accomplishing the type of entertainment it aims to be, despite there being better movie choices for film-goers to check out, saying that \\"After the Sunset is skillfully made, but it's not necessary [‚Ä¶] On the other hand, should you see it, the time will pass pleasantly.\\" James Berardinelli found the film to be \\"a mess, but [it's] a fun, breezy mess\\", criticizing the overall heist and weak characterization but gave praise to the quick pacing, three-way chemistry between Brosnan, Hayek and Harrelson, and Dante Spinotti's cinematography for capturing the \\"natural beauty\\" of its Caribbean setting, saying \\"despite not being especially well-written, it nevertheless offers a 100-minute, unpretentious diversion.\\" References External links   * 2004 films 2000s action comedy films 2000s crime comedy films 2000s heist films American action comedy films American crime comedy films American heist films American films English-language films Films directed by Brett Ratner Films produced by Beau Flynn Films scored by Lalo Schifrin Films set in the Bahamas Films shot in the Bahamas ","title":"After the Sunset"},{"id":"992455","text":"Gothic is a 1986 British psychological horror film directed by Ken Russell, starring Gabriel Byrne as Lord Byron, Julian Sands as Percy Bysshe Shelley, Natasha Richardson as Mary Shelley, Myriam Cyr as Claire Clairmont (Mary Shelley's stepsister) and Timothy Spall as Dr. John William Polidori. It features a soundtrack by Thomas Dolby, and marks Richardson's film debut. The film is a fictionalized retelling of the Shelleys' visit to Lord Byron in Villa Diodati by Lake Geneva, shot in Gaddesden Place. It concerns their competition to write a horror story, which ultimately led to Mary Shelley writing Frankenstein and John Polidori writing \\"The Vampyre.\\" The same event has also been portrayed in the films Bride of Frankenstein (1935) and Haunted Summer (1988), among others. The film's poster motif is based on Henry Fuseli's 1781 painting The Nightmare, which is also referenced in the film. Plot Through her stepsister Claire Clairmont, Mary Godwin and her future husband Percy Shelley come to know Lord Byron. During the summer of 1816, Lord Byron invites them to stay for a while at Villa Diodati in Switzerland. There they meet Byron's physician friend, Dr. John Polidori. On 16 June, while a storm rages outside, the five of them amuse themselves by engaging in a game of hide-and-seek. Later in a parlor, Percy proclaims his fascination with science; Polidori tells him of his interests in sleepwalking and nightmares. Lord Byron shows his guests Phantasmagoria, a book of horror stories he purchased from a shop in Geneva, and the three alternately read excerpts. This inspires them to hold a s√©ance gathered around a human skull, during which Claire has an apparent seizure. Mary describes them as Claire's \\"horrors,\\" and recalls instances during their childhood when unexplained phenomena would occur during them, such as Claire's bed inexplicably shaking, and doors slamming shut by themselves. Polidori brings Claire upstairs to rest. During the night, Mary witnesses a shadowy apparition outside the window she and Claire share. Believing Mary was startled by a slamming barn door outside, Percy goes to shut it. While investigating the barn, he is startled by a grotesque creature. Mary speaks with Lord Byron in the billiard room, confronting him about his intentions with Claire, and reveals to him that Claire is pregnant with his child. He suggests she has an abortion, and the two argue, resulting in a physical confrontation. Later, Lord Byron performs oral sex on Claire, during which she has a miscarriage. Meanwhile, Mary consoles Percy, who has grown increasingly paranoid and claims to smell an overpowering scent of decay. From the bottom of the staircase, Mary hears a noise, and feels liquid dripping on her. As she looks up, she sees Polidori leaning over the banister, clutching a bleeding wound on his neck. Once the bleeding is controlled, he claims to have been bitten by a vampire in his room. Byron accuses him of self-inflicting the wounds, while Percy and Mary believe him. Percy raves that the group collectively gave birth to something during the s√©ance, manifesting their worst fears, while Polidori is scared of damnation for his homosexuality. He attempts to poison himself to death with cyanide, but is stopped by Byron. Claire goes missing from her bedroom, and is discovered by Percy; he watches in horror as her breasts metamorphose into eyes; Mary attempts to flee the house, and inadvertently crashes through a glass door. Percy infers that the presence haunting them is feeding off of the group's fear. During a failed attempt to hang himself in the barn, Polidori witnesses a figure flee on horseback. Percy and Byron attempt to recreate the s√©ance to banish their creation. Byron and Percy, both atheists, believe it must be returned to the recesses of their minds, while Mary questions the metaphysical and supernatural events plaguing them. In the basement, the three discover Claire nude and covered in mud. Byron attempts to hold the s√©ance there, but Mary refuses. During the event, Mary crushes the skull, and attempts to stab Byron with a shard. Percy stops her, and begins kissing Byron passionately. As she flees through the home, Mary witnesses an apparition of her son, William, in a coffin, followed by a vision of her suffering a miscarriage. In the madness, she attempts to throw herself off a balcony, but is stopped by Percy. Mary awakens the following morning and joins Byron, Percy, and Claire in the garden. In the contemporary era, tourists visit the Villa. A voice-over informs that Mary's son, William, died three years after that night in June 1816, followed by Percy's drowning in 1822; Byron would die two years after Percy, and Polidori committed suicide in London. From Mary's previous experience of miscarriage came the desire to raise her child from the dead, which led to her writing Frankenstein. From Polidori's homosexuality, suicidal thoughts, and fascination with vampires came the story \\"The Vampyre.\\" Cast *Gabriel Byrne as Lord Byron *Julian Sands as Percy Bysshe Shelley *Natasha Richardson as Mary Shelley *Myriam Cyr as Claire Clairmont *Timothy Spall as Dr. John William Polidori *Alec Mango as Murray *Andreas Wisniewski as Fletcher *Dexter Fletcher as Ruston Basis in reality Gaddesden Place in Hertfordshire, England, was used as a location for Villa Diodati The film fictionalizes an actual meeting that took place between Mary Godwin, Percy Shelley, and Claire Clairemont at the Villa Diodati in Geneva, hosted by Lord Byron. It has been suggested by some historians and journalists that the events of their meeting which inspired Shelley's Frankenstein and Polidori's \\"The Vampyre\\" were triggered by the group's use of opium during their vacation together. Discussing the film's basis in reality, actor Sands commented: The film implies that Shelley's Frankenstein was inspired by the loss of her child; film historian Robert Shail wrote that Gothics \\"baroque visuals can't disguise the dubious nature of Russell's premise that the book was inspired by the author's loss of a baby.\\" Production =Development= The film was based on a screenplay by Stephen Volk, who worked in advertising. He sent it to Al Clark, head of Virgin Films. Clark said \\"it was worlds removed from the scripts that one predominantly gets in this country, with their literary ambience and dependence on a sort of linguistic authenticity. I felt it offered a perfect springboard to a director.\\" After seeing Crimes of Passion, Clark offered the film to Ken Russell who accepted. Volk admits to having \\"slight misgivings\\" when Clark mentioned Russell's name \\"but when I met Ken I found, somehow to my surprise, that he was very easy to get on with\\".Volk story Pulleine, Tim. The Guardian 26 Feb 1987: 13. Russell worked on a further draft of the script with Volk which made relatively minor changes. Russell had been interested in Byron and Shelley's meeting for a decade. He said \\"About 10 years ago, Robert Powell, the actor, approached me with a script covering the same time span and events. But we couldn't raise the money. I think it was a little too poetic and not as scary as it might have been.\\" Russell say Gothic as \\"a sort of black comedy; some of the others have been slightly more serious.

It took place at Hertfordshire, mostly in and around the Palladian mansion Wrotham Park, with a week's shooting in the Lake's District. Julian Sands had recently made A Room with a View with James Ivory and compared that director with Russell saying, \\"If James Ivory had done a film about Shelley, it would be a much more lyrical and soothing piece of work, whereas Ken's treatment is much more symphonic and mesmerizing. With James Ivory you are on a carousel, but with Ken Russell you are on a roller coaster. James Ivory is like an Indian miniaturist, and Ken Russell is a graffiti artist.

This is no reverie. It's a series of gaudy shock effects, an anthology of horror-film mannerisms that looks like a 60's LSD trip.

Gothic happens to be strikingly shot, the special effects inspired, albeit gruesome. Although he slops his signature blood 'n' cleavage across the screen, Russell makes it slick, with dynamic cutting, vivid lighting and framing. Who knows, you might spot a little humor in this hyperbolic lunacy. On the other hand, after a cinematic orgy like this, you might long for 15 minutes with an evangelist.\\" Author and film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film 2/4 stars, writing, \\"Too weird for some, too highbrow for many horror fans, but full of Russel's hallucinatory visuals.\\" On his website Ozus' World Movie Reviews, Dennis Schwartz awarded the film a grade C+, criticizing the film's overwhelming silliness, dialogue, and tacky moments. Schwartz concluded his review by writing, \\"As far as I'm concerned, thank you, but no thank you, I'll take my Byron and Shelley straight.\\" In his book The A‚ÄìZ of Horror Films, Howard Maxford called the film \\" A relentlessly hysterical barrage of images in its director's most deplorable manner.

(retrieved 11 February 2010) Saqqaq people lived in small tents and hunted seals, seabirds, and other marine animals. The people of the Saqqaq culture used silicified slate, agate, quartzite, and rock crystals as materials for their tools. Genetics A genetic study published in Science in August 2014 examined the remains of a six Saqqaq individuals buried in Qeqertasussuk, Greenland between ca. 3,000 BC and 1,900 BC. The five samples of mtDNA extracted belonged to haplogroups D2a1 (four samples) and D2a. These haplogroups also predominate in the Dorset culture, and are today found in high frequencies among Siberian Yupik and Aleut, with whom the Saqqaq are relatively closely related. The evidence suggested that the ancestors of the Saqqaq entered North America from Siberia through a distinct migration about 4000 BC, and that they subsequently remained largely genetically isolated from other North American populations.

Mercouris (; 1886 ‚Äì December 1943) was a Greek politician who served as a Member of Parliament and Cabinet Minister, and later founded the Greek National Socialist Party; a minor fascist party, they were one of several small far right parties in Greece at the time. During the occupation of Greece, Mercouris was appointed by the Nazis as Governor of the National Bank of Greece. Biography He was born in Athens into a prominent political family, the son of Spyridon Mercouris, long-serving Mayor of Athens, and the brother of Stamatis Mercouris, who would end up becoming a politician of the Left. He studied law and political science in the University of Athens, as well as in Paris. For his first political appointment he was elected as Member of Parliament in 1915 and he served until 1929. In summer 1917 was exiled by the French and Venizelists to Corsica from he returned after the end of WWI and the antivenizelist electoral win. He was Minister for Food and Supply in the Petros Protopapadakis cabinet from May until August 1922. He then became Minister of National Economy in the Alexandros Zaimis cabinet from December 1926 until August 1927. He also served as the Greek delegate to the League of Nations in 1927. Mercouris was re-elected to parliament, in September 1932, and made vice-president of the People's Party which he left in November after a disagreement with its leader Panagis Tsaldaris. In December he founded the Greek National Socialist Party. Mercouris represented the party at the Fascist International meeting, in Montreux on December 16/17 of 1934. He was among the more germanophilic adherents of the largely Italian fascism oriented authoritarian, corporatist, and anti-communist movement. He acted as an intermediary between Greece and Nazi Germany. Prime Minister Ioannis Rallis (during the Axis occupation) appointed him Governor of the National Bank of Greece in 1943. Personal He died of a heart attack during World War II. His brother Stamatis was later an MP for the left, and his niece was the famous actress, singer, and politician Melina Mercouri.

Career Kostakidis was a member of the management team that set up and developed SBS Television in 1980 and went on to present its flagship World News for 20 years, resigning in 2007. Her board and committee appointments during nearly 3 decades at SBS and subsequently reflect a strong commitment to social justice and the arts. She has served as a member of the Fred Hollows Foundation Board, the Sydney Theatre Board, the National Library of Australia Council, the ResMed Foundation Board, the Advisory Panel of the Sydney Peace Foundation, USYD, the Freilich Foundation, ANU and The Privacy Foundation and is a former Chair of the Sydney Peace Foundation. The Sydney Peace Foundation is a University of Sydney Foundation and its major Partner in Peace is the City of Sydney. Annually it awards Australia's only international prize for peace, the Sydney Peace Prize. Past recipients include Muhammad Yunus, Xanana Gusm√£o, Mary Robinson, Hanan Ashrawi, Arundhati Roy, Hans Blix, Irene Khan, Patrick Dodson, and Noam Chomsky, and in 2011 its third-ever gold medal for 'exceptional courage in pursuit of human rights' was awarded to her fellow Australian journalist Julian Assange. In 2009, Kostakidis served on the National Human Rights Consultation Committee chaired by Frank Brennan. The Committee inquired into the adequacy of the protection and promotion of human rights in Australia, holding consultations in metropolitan, rural and remote areas across the country, and receiving over 35,000 written submissions. They recommended a raft of measures, the most contentious of which was a Human Rights Act. Human rights education was the measure that had the greatest support of those that took part in the consultation, but the overwhelming majority supported human rights legislation. The four member Committee also included Mick Palmer and Tammy Williams. From 1997-2003 she served on the Advertising Standards Board; in 1993 she was appointed by then Prime Minister Paul Keating to Republic Advisory Committee chaired by Malcolm Turnbull; in the early nineties she also served on the Council for the Order of Australia and in 1992 was a founding member of the James Joyce Foundation Board along with Ed Campion and Don Anderson. She has also been an active member of the Kazantzaki society. Kostakidis has served as an Ambassador for Beyond Blue and was also a member of the Drug and Alcohol Council, the Breast Cancer Council Advisory Committee and the Constitutional Centenary Foundation. Early life She was born in Thessaloniki, Greece and migrated to Australia with her family two years later. Kostakidis attended Fort Street Girls' High School, and the University of Sydney, where she studied Modern Greek, Philosophy, French, German and Italian. She was also a founding member and first President of the University's Greek Society. She went on to complete a Diploma of Education. Kostakidis was awarded a post-graduate scholarship to study at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in Greece. Before joining SBS, Kostakidis worked as a tutor at the University of Sydney, as a research officer for the Departments of Health and Youth and Community Services in New South Wales and as a court interpreter and a translations editor. She has also hosted programmes on ABC Radio stations 2BL and Classic FM. During her assignment as an interpreter on the so-called \\"Greek Conspiracy Case\\" in the late 1970s, she organised a conversion course for Greek interpreters at the NSW Ethnic Affairs Commission in conjunction with Sydney University Modern Greek lecturer Dr Alfred Vincent, to facilitate a conversion from the formal katharevousa to demotic or vernacular Greek so that the defendants in the case would be able to understand the language being used. Some years later, Greece also adopted the vernacular as the language of all official documents. Acting Kostakidis acted in a children's television series called Five Times Dizzy in 1986 with Rebekah Elmaloglou. She has also appeared in the movies Jindabyne and Look Both Ways as a newsreader. SBS =The \\"Face of SBS\\"= Kostakidis joined SBS as part of the original management team in September 1980 and worked to set up the Subtitling Unit where she helped to develop its policy and training programme and recruited linguists. She became Director of Programme Preparation where she was involved in developing policies of censorship and classification and the children's programming policy. Kostakidis was moved from subtitling to help create and to host SBS's flagship evening news service, where her more diverse background and multilingual capabilities changed the face of the organisation. She began reading SBS's weekend news bulletins in 1986 and in 1988 became SBS Television's weeknight news presenter. She was described as an important figure at SBS for 20 years \\"because she was an intelligent professional with a warm personality who capably took viewers through the world events of the day\\". In 1994 she hosted the prime time interview program, The Talk Show. Her guests included Paul Keating, John Laws, Cheryl Kernot, Imran Khan, Betty Friedan and Don Dunstan. After being known as \\"the face of SBS news\\" for many years, in her final year she only co-hosted the main SBS World News at weekdays with Stan Grant. =Walk-out and legal action= On 21 August 2007 it was reported that Kostakidis had stormed out of the newsroom a week and a half earlier, furious at changes to the news bulletin. Although SBS said she was ill and taking leave, it was reported she had concluded her role as co-host due to differences in opinion over the increasingly commercial direction SBS was taking since the 2003 arrival of former New Zealand TV boss Shaun Brown. According to authors Ien Ang, Gay Hawkins and Lamia Dabboussy, Kostakidis was unhappy with \\"the introduction of advertisements within [news] programs,\\" and her departure \\"was clearly a big blow to SBS, and signalled for many that the multicultural broadcaster had lost its way.\\" On 5 October 2007 Kostakidis lodged a statement of claim in the Federal Court of Australia, alleging a breach of contract and contravention of the Trade Practices Act 1975 on the part of SBS, citing alleged bullying by fellow presenter Stan Grant. She secured the services of a prominent Melbourne lawyer, Julian Burnside, and was expected to argue that her contract stated she would be the primary presenter of the programme, and that she would be able to exercise some editorial control. The matter was settled out of court. On 23 November 2007, SBS and Kostakidis were reported to have reached an \\"amicable settlement\\". The financial details of the settlement were not disclosed. Community Kostakidis has a long-standing interest in social justice and continues to engage in public discourse, delivering lectures, chairing public forums and contributing editorial opinion articles in the mainstream press and independent online media. Personal life Her second husband is Ian Wilcox, a cardiologist. They married in Venice.

Public Relations Writing: Form and Style. p.236. They can improve cognition by utilizing graphics to enhance the human visual system's ability to see patterns and trends.Card, S. (2009). Information visualization. In A. Sears & J. A. Jacko (Eds.), Human-Computer Interaction: Design Issues, Solutions, and Applications (pp. 510-543). Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press. Similar pursuits are information visualization, data visualization, statistical graphics, information design, or information architecture. Infographics have evolved in recent years to be for mass communication, and thus are designed with fewer assumptions about the readers' knowledge base than other types of visualizations. Isotypes are an early example of infographics conveying information quickly and easily to the masses.  Overview  Infographics have been around for many years and recently the increase of a number of easy-to-use, free tools have made the creation of infographics available to a large segment of the population. Social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter have also allowed for individual infographics to be spread among many people around the world. Infographics are widely used in the age of short attention span. In newspapers, infographics are commonly used to show the weather, as well as maps, site plans, and graphs for summaries of data. Some books are almost entirely made up of information graphics, such as David Macaulay's The Way Things Work. The Snapshots in USA Today are also an example of simple infographics used to convey news and current events. Modern maps, especially route maps for transit systems, use infographic techniques to integrate a variety of information, such as the conceptual layout of the transit network, transfer points, and local landmarks. Public transportation maps, such as those for the Washington Metro and the London Underground, are well-known infographics. Public places such as transit terminals usually have some sort of integrated \\"signage system\\" with standardized icons and stylized maps. In his 1983 \\"landmark book\\" The Visual Display of Quantitative Information, Edward Tufte defines \\"graphical displays\\" in the following passage: While contemporary infographics often deal with \\"qualitative\\" or soft subjects, generally speaking Tufte's 1983 definition still speaks, in a broad sense, to what infographics are, and what they do‚Äîwhich is to condense large amounts of information into a form where it will be more easily absorbed by the reader.  History  = Early = In 1626, Christoph Scheiner published the Rosa Ursina sive Sol, a book that revealed his research about the rotation of the sun. Infographics appeared in the form of illustrations demonstrating the Sun's rotation patterns. In 1786, William Playfair, an engineer and political economist, published the first data graphs in his book The Commercial and Political Atlas. To represent the economy of 18th Century England, Playfair used statistical graphs, bar charts, line graphs, area charts, and histograms. In his work, Statistical Breviary, he is credited with introducing the first pie chart. Around 1820, modern geography was established by Carl Ritter. His maps included shared frames, agreed map legends, scales, repeatability, and fidelity. Such a map can be considered a \\"supersign\\" which combines sign systems‚Äîas defined by Charles Sanders Peirce‚Äîconsisting of symbols, icons, indexes as representations.Benking, Heiner, ‚ÄúUsing Maps and Models, SuperSigns and SuperStructures‚Äù, 2005. Other examples can be seen in the works of geographers Ritter and Alexander von Humboldt.1st Berlin Symposium on Internet and Society, ‚ÄúLearnings from Alexander von Humboldt and Carl Ritter towards the Grand Global Modern Communication Challenges‚Äù. Polar area diagram by Florence Nightingale illustrating causes of mortality during the Crimean War (1857). In 1857, English nurse Florence Nightingale used information graphics to persuade Queen Victoria to improve conditions in military hospitals. The principal one she used was the Coxcomb chart, a combination of stacked bar and pie charts, depicting the number and causes of deaths during each month of the Crimean War. Charles Minard's information graphic of Napoleon's invasion of Russia. 1861 saw the release of an influential information graphic on the subject of Napoleon's disastrous march on Moscow. The graphic's creator, Charles Joseph Minard, captured four different changing variables that contributed to Napoleon's downfall in a single two-dimensional image: the army's direction as they traveled, the location the troops passed through, the size of the army as troops died from hunger and wounds, and the freezing temperatures they experienced. James Joseph Sylvester introduced the term \\"graph\\" in 1878 in the scientific magazine Nature and published a set of diagrams showing the relationship between chemical bonds and mathematical properties. These were also some of the first mathematical graphs. = 20th century = In 1900, the African-American historian, sociologist, writer and Black rights activist, W.E.B. Du Bois presented data visualizations at the Exposition Universelle (1900) in Paris, France. In addition to curating 500 photographs of the lives of Black Americans, Du Bois and his Atlanta University team of students and scholars created 60 handmade data visualizations to document the ways Black Americans were being denied access to education, housing, employment and household wealth. Manski, Jackie, ‚ÄúW.E.B. Du Bois‚Äô Visionary Infographics Come Together for the First Time in Full Color‚Äù, smithsonianmag.com, November 15, 2018. The Cologne Progressives developed an aesthetic approach to art which focused on communicating information. Gerd Arntz, Peter Alma and Augustin Tschinkel, all participants in this movement were recruited by Otto Neurath for the Gesellschafts- und Wirtschaftsmuseum, where they developed the Vienna Method from 1926‚Äì1934. Here simple images were used to represent data in a structured way. Following the victory of Austrofascism in the Austrian Civil War, the team moved to the Netherlands where they continued their work rebranding it Isotypes (International System of TYpographic Picture Education). The method was also applied by IZOSTAT (–ò–ó–û–°–¢–ê–¢) in the Soviet Union. In 1942 Isidore Isou published the Lettrist manifesto, a document covering art, culture, poetry, film, and political theory. The included works, also called metagraphics and hypergraphics, are a synthesis of writing and visual art. In 1958 Stephen Toulmin proposed a graphical argument model, called The Toulmin Model of Argumentation. The diagram contained six interrelated components used for analyzing arguments, and was considered Toulmin's most influential work, particularly in the field of rhetoric, communication, and computer science. The Toulmin Model of Argumentation became influential in argumentation theory and its applications. In 1972 and 1973, respectively, the Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 spacecraft included on their vessels the Pioneer Plaques, a pair of gold-anodized aluminum plaques, each featuring a pictorial message. The pictorial messages included nude male and female figures as well as symbols that were intended to provide information about the origin of the spacecraft. The images were designed by Carl Sagan and Frank Drake and were unique in that their graphical meanings were to be understandable to extraterrestrial beings, who would have no conception of human language. A pioneer in data visualization, Edward Tufte, wrote a series of books ‚Äì Visual Explanations, The Visual Display of Quantitative Information, and Envisioning Information ‚Äì on the subject of information graphics. Referred to by The New York Times as the ‚Äúda Vinci of Data‚Äù, Tufte began to give day-long lectures and workshops on the subject of infographics starting in 1993. , Tufte still gives these lectures.Freymann-Weyr, Jeffrey, ‚ÄúEdward Tufte, Offering 'Beautiful Evidence'‚Äù, NPR.org, August 20, 2006. To Tufte, good data visualizations represent every data point accurately and enable a viewer to see trends and patterns in the data. Tufte's contribution to the field of data visualization and infographics is considered immense, and his design principles can be seen in many websites, magazines, and newspapers today.Romano, Andrew, ‚ÄúHow Master Information Designer Edward Tufte Can Help Obama Govern‚Äù, thedailybeast.com, March 9, 2010. The infographics created by Peter Sullivan for The Sunday Times in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s were some of the key factors in encouraging newspapers to use more infographics. Sullivan is also one of the few authors who have written about information graphics in newspapers. Likewise the staff artists at USA Today, the United States newspaper that debuted in 1982, established the goal of using graphics to make information easier to comprehend. However, the paper has received criticism for oversimplifying news stories and for creating infographics that some find emphasize entertainment over content and data. Tufte coined the term chartjunk to refer to graphics that are visually appealing to the point of losing the information contained within them. With vector graphics and raster graphics becoming ubiquitous in computing in the 21st Century, data visualizations have been applied to commonly used computer systems, including desktop publishing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Closely related to the field of information graphics is information design, which is the creation of infographics. = 21st century = By the year 2000, Adobe Flash-based animations on the Internet had made use of many key practices in creating infographics in order to create a variety of products and games. Likewise, television began to incorporate infographics into the viewers' experiences in the early 2000s. One example of infographics usage in television and in pop culture is the 2002 music video by the Norwegian musicians of R√∂yksopp, for their song \\"Remind Me.\\" The video was composed entirely of animated infographics. Similarly, in 2004, a television commercial for the French nuclear technology company Areva used animated infographics as an advertising tactic. Both of these videos and the attention they received have conveyed to other fields the potential value in using information graphics to describe complex information efficiently. With the rise of alternatives to Adobe Flash, such as HTML 5 and CSS3, infographics are now created in a variety of media with a number of software tools.\\"Why you should build your infographics in HTML5 and CSS3.\\". Paul Rouget. Retrieved 2012-07-10. The field of journalism has also incorporated and applied information graphics to news stories. For stories that intend to include text, images, and graphics, the system called the maestro concept allows entire newsrooms to collaborate and organize a story to successfully incorporate all components. Across many newsrooms, this teamwork-integrated system is applied to improve time management. The maestro system is designed to improve the presentation of stories for busy readers of media. Many news based websites have also used interactive information graphics in which the user can extract information on a subject as they explore the graphic. Many businesses use infographics as a medium for communicating with and attracting potential customers.Khazan, Olga, ‚ÄúHow can businesses use infographics?‚Äù, washingtonpost.com, April 8, 2012. Information graphics are a form of content marketing and have become a tool for internet marketers and companies to create content that others will link to, thus possibly boosting a company's reputation and online presence. Religious denominations have also started using infographics. For example, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has made numerous infographics to help people learn about their faith, missionaries, temples, lay ministry, and family history efforts. Infographics are finding a home in the classroom as well. Courses that teach students to create their own infographics using a variety of tools may encourage engagement in the classroom and may lead to a better understanding of the concepts they are mapping onto the graphics. With the popularity of social media, infographics have become popular, often as static images or simple web interfaces, covering any number of topics. Such infographics are often shared between users of social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Google+ and Reddit. The hashtag #infographic was tweeted 56,765 times in March 2012 and at its peak 3,365 times in a span of 24 hours.  Analysis  A chart attempting to depict business expectations about emerging technologies as of July 2009. The three parts of all infographics are the visual, the content, and the knowledge. The visual consists of colors and graphics. There are two different types of graphics ‚Äì theme, and reference. Theme graphics are included in all infographics and represent the underlying visual representation of the data. Reference graphics are generally icons that can be used to point to certain data, although they are not always found in infographics. Statistics and facts usually serve as the content for infographics and can be obtained from any number of sources, including census data and news reports. One of the most important aspects of infographics is that they contain some sort of insight into the data that they are presenting ‚Äì this is the knowledge. Infographics are effective because of their visual element. Humans receive input from all five of their senses (sight, touch, hearing, smell, taste), but they receive significantly more information from vision than any of the other four. Fifty percent of the human brain is dedicated to visual functions, and images are processed faster than text. The brain processes pictures all at once, but processes text in a linear fashion, meaning it takes much longer to obtain information from text. Entire business processes or industry sectors can be made relevant to a new audience through a guidance design technique that leads the eye. The page may link to a complete report, but the infographic primes the reader making the subject-matter more accessible. Online trends, such as the increasingly short attention span of Internet users, has also contributed to the increasing popularity and effectiveness of infographics. When designing the visual aspect of an infographic, a number of considerations must be made to optimize the effectiveness of the visualization. The six components of visual encoding are spatial, marks, connection, enclosure, retinal properties, and temporal encoding. Each of these can be utilized in its own way to represent relationships between different types of data. However, studies have shown that spatial position is the most effective way to represent numerical data and leads to the fastest and easiest understanding by viewers. Therefore, the designers often spatially represent the most important relationship being depicted in an infographic. There are also three basic provisions of communication that need to be assessed when designing an infographic ‚Äì appeal, comprehension, and retention.Jason Lankow, Josh Ritchie, Ross Crooks (2012). Infographics: The Power of Visual Storytelling \\"Appeal\\" is the idea that the communication needs to engage its audience. Comprehension implies that the viewer should be able to easily understand the information that is presented to them. And finally, \\"retention\\" means that the viewer should remember the data presented by the infographic. The order of importance of these provisions depends on the purpose of the infographic. If the infographic is meant to convey information in an unbiased way, such as in the domains of academia or science, comprehension should be considered first, then retention, and finally appeal. However, if the infographic is being used for commercial purposes, then appeal becomes most important, followed by retention and comprehension. When infographics are being used for editorial purposes, such as in a newspaper, the appeal is again most important but is followed first by comprehension and then retention. However, the appeal and the retention can in practice be put together by the aid of a comprehensible layout design. Recently, as an attempt to study the effect of the layout of an infographic on the comprehension of the viewers, a new Neural Network based cognitive load estimation method was applied on different types of common layouts for the infographic design. When the varieties of factors listed above are taken into consideration when designing infographics, they can be a highly efficient and effective way to convey large amounts of information in a visual manner.  Data visualization  Data visualizations are often used in infographics and may make up the entire infographic. There are many types of visualizations that can be used to represent the same set of data. Therefore, it is crucial to identify the appropriate visualization for the data set and infographic by taking into consideration graphical features such as position, size, shape, and color. There are primarily five types of visualization categories ‚Äì time- series data, statistical distributions, maps, hierarchies, and networking. = Time-series = A stacked graph showing the changing distribution of processor families in TOP500 supercomputers since 1996 Time-series data is one of the most common forms of data visualization. It documents sets of values over time. Examples of graphics in this category include index charts, stacked graphs, small multiples, and horizon graphs. Index charts are ideal to use when raw values are less important than relative changes. It is an interactive line chart that shows percentage changes for a collection of time-series data based on a selected index point. For example, stock investors could use this because they are less concerned with the specific price and more concerned with the rate of growth. Stacked graphs are area charts that are stacked on top of each other, and depict aggregate patterns. They allow viewers to see overall patterns and individual patterns. However, they do not support negative numbers and make it difficult to accurately interpret trends. An alternative to stacked graphs is small multiples. Instead of stacking each area chart, each series is individually shown so the overall trends of each sector are more easily interpreted. Horizon graphs are a space efficient method to increase the data density of a time-series while preserving resolution. A histogram graph showing the numerical distribution of petal lengths(cm) recorded from Iris flower data set = Statistical = Statistical distributions reveal trends based on how numbers are distributed. Common examples include histograms and box-and-whisker plots, which convey statistical features such as mean, median, and outliers. In addition to these common infographics, alternatives include stem-and-leaf plots, Q-Q plots, scatter plot matrices (SPLOM) and parallel coordinates. For assessing a collection of numbers and focusing on frequency distribution, stem-and-leaf plots can be helpful. The numbers are binned based on the first significant digit, and within each stack binned again based on the second significant digit. On the other hand, Q-Q plots compare two probability distributions by graphing quantiles against each other. This allows the viewer to see if the plot values are similar and if the two are linearly related. SPLOM is a technique that represents the relationships among multiple variables. It uses multiple scatter plots to represent a pairwise relation among variables. Another statistical distribution approach to visualize multivariate data is parallel coordinates. Rather than graphing every pair of variables in two dimensions, the data is repeatedly plotted on a parallel axis and corresponding points are then connected with a line. The advantage of parallel coordinates is that they are relatively compact, allowing many variables to be shown simultaneously. A cartogram showing the final electoral results of the 2008 US presidential election = Maps = Maps are a natural way to represent geographical data. Time and space can be depicted through the use of flow maps. Line strokes are used with various widths and colors to help encode information. Choropleth maps, which encode data through color and geographical region, are also commonly used. Graduated symbol maps are another method to represent geographical data. They are an alternative to choropleth map and use symbols, such as pie charts for each area, over a map. This map allows for more dimensions to be represented using various shapes, size, and color. Cartograms, on the other hand, completely distort the shape of a region and directly encode a data variable. Instead of using a geographic map, regions are redrawn proportionally to the data. For example, each region can be represented by a circle and the size/color is directly proportional to other information, such as population size. = Hierarchies = A treemap showing the exports of Uganda Many data sets, such as spatial entities of countries or common structures for governments, can be organized into natural hierarchies. Node-link diagrams, adjacency diagrams, and enclosure diagrams are all types of infographics that effectively communicate hierarchical data. Node-link diagrams are a popular method due to the tidy and space-efficient results. A node-link diagram is similar to a tree, where each node branches off into multiple sub-sections. An alternative is adjacency diagrams, which is a space- filling variant of the node-link diagram. Instead of drawing a link between hierarchies, nodes are drawn as solid areas with sub-sections inside of each section. This method allows for size to be easily represented than in the node-link diagrams. Enclosure diagrams are also a space-filling visualization method. However, they uses containment rather than adjacency to represent the hierarchy. Similar to the adjacency diagram, the size of the node is easily represented in this model. Arc diagram representing the mathematical Farey sequence = Networks = social network visualization. Network visualization explores relationships, such as friendships and cliques. Three common types are force-directed layout, arc diagrams, and matrix view. Force-directed layouts are a common and intuitive approach to network layout. In this system, nodes are similar to charged particles, which repel each other. Links are used to pull related nodes together. Arc diagrams are one-dimensional layouts of nodes with circular arcs linking each node. When used properly, with good order in nodes, cliques and bridges are easily identified in this layout. Alternatively, mathematicians and computer scientists more often use matrix views. Each value has an (x,y) value in the matrix that corresponds to a node. By using color and saturation instead of text, values associated with the links can be perceived rapidly. While this method makes it hard to view the path of the nodes,there are no line crossings, which in a large and highly connected network can quickly become too cluttered. While all of these visualizations can be effectively used on their own, many modern infographics combine multiple types into one graphic, along with other features, such as illustrations and text. Some modern infographics do not even contain data visualization, and instead are simply a colorful and succinct ways to present knowledge. Fifty-three percent of the 30 most-viewed infographics on the infographic sharing site visual.ly did not contain actual data.Van Slembrouck, Paul, ‚ÄúAnalyzing the Top 30 Infographics on Visually‚Äù, June 2012.  Tools  Infographics can be created by hand using simple everyday tools such as graph paper, pencils, markers, and rulers. However, today they are more often created using computer software, which is often both faster and easier. They can be created with general illustration software. Diagrams can be manually created and drawn using software, which can be downloaded for the desktop or used online. Templates can be used to get users started on their diagrams. Additionally, the software allows users to collaborate on diagrams in real time over the Internet. There are also numerous tools to create very specific types of visualizations, such as creating a visualization based on embedded data in the photos on a user's smartphone. Users can create an infographic of their resume or a ‚Äúpicture of their digital life.‚Äù  See also  * A picture is worth a thousand words * Argument map * Charts * Digital dashboard * Data Presentation Architecture * Data visualization * Edugraphic * Graphic design * Graphic image development * Graphic organizers * Information design * List of information graphics software * Scientific visualization * Statistical graphics * Technical illustration * Isotype (picture language) * Timeline * Visualization (graphic) * News Illustrated * Maestro Concept * Family tree  References   Further reading  * Heiner Benking (1981‚Äì1988) Requisite inquiry and time-line: computer graphics-infographics http://benking.de/infographics/ see there: Computer Graphics in the Environmental Sector ‚Äì Possibilities and Limitations of Data-visualisation this citation in chapter 3: technical possibilities and human potentials and capacities, \\"a picture is more than 10.000 words\\", and \\"10.000 miles equal 10.000 books\\". *Sullivan, Peter.

Early life Frank Riggs was born in Louisville, Kentucky. He served in the United States Army from 1972 to 1975. Career An Army veteran, having served as a Military Police officer, Riggs worked as a police officer and deputy sheriff in Santa Barbara, California, and Sonoma County, respectively. He was a member of the Windsor Unified School District Board of Trustees from 1984 to 1988 and was a real estate executive and owner of his own development company for over 20 years. In 1999, Riggs joined the board of the Charter Schools Development Corporation, and served with CSDC until 2012. During his service, CSDC went from being a start-up nonprofit to a national leader in financing and developing educational facilities for charter schools, reaching $125 million in assets, and procuring and leveraging private capital for facility acquisitions and improvements worth $680 million; representing over four million square feet of facilities for 235 charter schools in 25 states. In 2001, he moved to Arizona.Linda Bentley, Field of six vying for governor in Republican Primary, Sonoran News, August 06, 2014 He served as CEO of ABS School Services of Phoenix, which provides financial accounting and business management services to approximately 200 school district charter, private, and federal grant schools. Riggs was also the founding board president for Arizona Connections Academy, a statewide on-line charter school. He has resided in Scottsdale, Arizona for 14 years. =California Congressman= Riggs was elected to the United States House of Representatives as a Republican in 1990 from California's 1st District, narrowly defeating four-term Democrat Doug Bosco. He represented the area stretching from Napa County to the northern Pacific coast. He served in the 102nd, 104th, and 105th Congresses. During his service, he was on the House Appropriations Committee (including the Agriculture and the Energy and Water Development Subcommittees), the House Transportation and Public Works Committee, and the House Banking and Financial Affairs Committee. Riggs also served on the House Education and Workforce Committee and chaired the Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Youth and Families in the 105th Congress. In that capacity, he authored the Charter School Expansion Act (signed into law by President Bill Clinton in October, 1998) which provides federal start-up grants to newly formed charter schools to help defray their initial operating expenses. Most Arizona charter schools have received federal start-up grants as a result of Riggs' legislation. Riggs voted against the Gulf War resolution and, as a member of the Gang of Seven, a group of freshman Republican congressmen, favored identifying publicly the congressmen who made overdrafts at the House Bank. He was defeated in 1992 by Democrat Dan Hamburg but won a rematch in 1994. In 1996, he won re-election over Democrat Michela Alioto- Pier. =California U.S. Senate campaign= In 1998, Riggs faced a potentially competitive contest against State Senator Mike Thompson, who was due to be termed out of his seat. Thompson's state senate district was virtually coextensive with the congressional district. Riggs decided not to run for re- election. Instead, he ran for the Republican nomination for the United States Senate. A late entrant, he dropped out of the race before Election Day but still finished in fifth place (the fourth place Republican) in the state's open primary system. The nomination was won by State Treasurer Matt Fong. Meanwhile, Thompson easily won the congressional race. =Arizona campaigns= In 2005, he explored a run for governor, as most Arizona Republicans were deciding not to challenge popular Governor Janet Napolitano for reelection the following year. However, he discovered that he had to be a five-year resident of Arizona in order to run for governor. In 2014, he unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for Governor of Arizona, finishing last in the Republican primary with less than five percent of the vote. In 2016, Riggs created an exploratory candidacy for the Arizona Corporation Commission, but ultimately did not run for the position. =Arizona Superintendent of Public Instruction campaign= In the 2018 Arizona Republican primary election, Riggs ran for state Superintendent of Public Instruction against college professor Dr. Bob Branch, incumbent Diane Douglas, former Basis Charter Schools Director of Charter School Development Jonathan Gelbart and former public school teacher Tracy Livingston. A week after the election in which Riggs traded the lead with Dr. Branch several times, Riggs came out ahead by only 249 votes. However, he lost the race to Democrat Kathy Hoffman in the November 6, 2018, general election.

The struct data type can contain other data types so is used for mixed-data-type records such as a hard-drive directory entry (file length, name, extension, physical address, etc.), or other mixed- type records (name, address, telephone, balance, etc.). The C struct directly references a contiguous block of physical memory, usually delimited (sized) by word-length boundaries. It corresponds to the similarly named feature available in some assemblers for Intel processors. Being a block of contiguous memory, each field within a struct is located at a certain fixed offset from the start. Because the contents of a struct are stored in contiguous memory, the sizeof operator must be used to get the number of bytes needed to store a particular type of struct, just as it can be used for primitives. The alignment of particular fields in the struct (with respect to word boundaries) is implementation-specific and may include padding, although modern compilers typically support the \`#pragma pack\` directive, which changes the size in bytes used for alignment. In the C++ language, a struct is identical to a C++ class but has a different default visibility: class members are private by default, whereas struct members are public by default.  In other languages  The struct data type in C was derived from the ALGOL 68 struct data type. Like its C counterpart, the struct data type in C# (Structure in Visual Basic .NET) is similar to a class. The biggest difference between a struct and a class in these languages is that when a struct is passed as an argument to a function, any modifications to the struct in that function will not be reflected in the original variable (unless pass-by-reference is used). This differs from C++, where classes or structs can be statically allocated or dynamically allocated either on the stack (similar to C#) or on the heap, with an explicit pointer. In C++, the only difference between a struct and a class is that the members and base classes of a struct are public by default. (A class defined with the \`class\` keyword has private members and base classes by default.)  Declaration  The general syntax for a struct declaration in C is: struct tag_name { type member1; type member2; /* declare as many members as desired, but the entire structure size must be known to the compiler. */ }; Here \`tag_name\` is optional in some contexts. Such a \`struct\` declaration may also appear in the context of a typedef declaration of a type alias or the declaration or definition of a variable: typedef struct tag_name { type member1; type member2; } struct_alias;  Initialization  There are three ways to initialize a structure. For the \`struct\` type /* Declare the struct with integer members x, y */ struct point { int x; int y; }; C89-style initializers are used when contiguous members may be given. /* Define a variable p of type point, and initialize its first two members in place */ struct point p = { 1, 2 }; For non contiguous or out of order members list, designated initializer style may be used /* Define a variable p of type point, and set members using designated initializers*/ struct point p = { .y = 2, .x = 1 }; If an initializer is given or if the object is statically allocated, omitted elements are initialized to 0. A third way of initializing a structure is to copy the value of an existing object of the same type /* Define a variable q of type point, and set members to the same values as those of p */ struct point q = p;  Assignment  A struct may be assigned to another struct. A compiler might use \`memcpy()\` to perform such an assignment. struct point { int x; int y; }; int main(void) { struct point p = { 1, 3 }; /* initialized variable */ struct point q; /* uninitialized */ q = p; /* copy member values from p into q */ return 0; }  Pointers to struct  Pointers can be used to refer to a \`struct\` by its address. This is useful for passing structs to a function. The pointer can be dereferenced using the \`*\` operator. The \`->\` operator dereferences the pointer to struct (left operand) and then accesses the value of a member of the struct (right operand). struct point { int x; int y; }; struct point my_point = { 3, 7 }; struct point *p = &my;_point; /* p is a pointer to my_point */ (*p).x = 8; /* set the first member of the struct */ p->x = 8; /* equivalent method to set the first member of the struct */  typedef  Typedefs can be used as shortcuts, for example: typedef struct { int account_number; char *first_name; char *last_name; float balance; } account;  See also  * Bit field * Composite data type * Flexible array member * Passive data structure * Union type  References  C (programming language) ","title":"Struct (C programming language)"},{"id":"992543","text":"Meliora is the motto of the University of Rochester Meliora is a Latin adjective meaning \\"better\\".

The entire area is a peninsula on the southern coast of the Hong Kong Island, facing the South China Sea. Shek O is surrounded by Shek O Country Park, Big Wave Bay and Cape D'Aguilar. Shek O Village Shek O Village () has a history of some 200 years. It was established by fishermen of the Chan, Yip, Li and Lau clansBrief Information on Proposed Grade 3 Items. Item #878 and was once famous for its lobster. The majority of the population previously lived on the land presently occupied by the Shek O country Club, from where it was forcibly removed. In 1841, Shek O Village as a whole, together with Hok Tsui Village () and Tai Long Wan Village (), had a population of around 200. The Tin Hau Temple in Shek O Village was built in 1891.Brief Information on No Grade Items.

However, the earliest bus service to Shek O dates back to the 1920s, when the Hong Kong and Shanghai Hotels Limited operated a bus route between the Hong Kong Hotel and Big Wave Bay in Shek O. Outdoor activities Shek O Beach Shek O Beach during a Sunday dawn. Shek O Beach is a sandy public beach at Shek O.Leisure and Cultural Services Department: Shek O Beach The water quality is fair and is gazetted Grade 2. It is a popular weekend and holiday destination, offering a public barbecue area and many restaurants. The rocky cliffs provide an excellent place for sports climbing. Around one mile north of Shek O beach, after passing the Shek O Country Club, is Big Wave Bay. As its name suggests, big waves roll on to the beach, propelled by the wind, making it a popular destination for surfers. Wind surfers can be found in the sea off Big Wave Bay and Shek O beaches. The Dragon's Back above Shek O is home to Hong Kong Island's only paragliding site. Paragliders can be seen riding the lift and landing at the nearby Rocky Bay. Big Wave Bay Beach is also the site of prehistoric rock carving similar to those found on Cheung Chau Island. Both beaches have basic bars and restaurants, and equipment hire, such as body boards and lilos. In addition, Shek O Beach has a small golf course. Due to the isolated location of Shek O, the environment near the beach remains rustic and quiet, which is one of the area's main attractions. The Shek O Country Club () is built around a par 65 private golf course. Its history goes back to 1919. The construction of the Clubhouse was completed in 1925.Brief Information on Proposed Grade 3 Items. Item #928 = Golf = Shek O Country Club is a private golf club sitting on the Shek O peninsula with a history dating back to 1921. The course is short, playing to a par 65, with no par 5s and only two par 4s measuring over 350 yards. =Drownings = Shek O Beach has been noted as generally suffering from the highest drowning rate among Hong Kong's beaches, although this is not reflected in official statistics as the LCSD only records incidents which occur while lifeguards are on duty. Residents estimated nine drowning deaths at the beach in 2011, and seven in 2012, figures which were not disputed by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD). The high rate of accidents at the beach has been attributed to its high patronage, usually strong waves, the steep underwater slope of the beach, swimmer inexperience and poor public awareness of water safety principles. In popular culture The scenery of Shek O is the setting of numerous Cantopop music videos. The Hong Kong director Stephen Chow's 1999 film King of Comedy () was also shot at Shek O.

Debuting in 1965, the comic was written by Robert Kanigher and drawn by Joe Kubert and the character has been revived several times since by other writers & artists. Overview Enemy Ace first appeared in Our Army at War # 151, (February 1965), in a backup story that quickly gained popularity. As a World War I pilot flying for the Germans, his stories told the German side of the war, in which Hans von Hammer was a man of honor and chivalry, a flying knight in his Fokker Dr.I, but he was haunted by his duties and the constant death surrounding them. The cover of Star Spangled War Stories #148, highlighting the fatal fall of Von Hammer's puppy, Schatzi. The early series stories centered around World War I Air Combat and the strategies, tactics and honor employed by the early knights of the air. The stories were often a stark contrast between the dark brooding character Von Hammer and his softer, kinder side as in Star Spangled War Stories No 148 where Von Hammer rescues a little dog he names \\"Schatzi\\" and proceeds to befriend him, even introducing him to his dark hunting companion the gray wolf who accepts little Schatzi rather than eating him. But the Von Hammer stories were not big on happy endings, and Von Hammer goes on to lose Schatzi in a haunting scene by dropping him accidentally from his Fokker during air combat. He grieves the loss of the dog, then proceeds to massacre the remaining British pilots in an act of bloody revenge. Von Hammer was a dark character, portrayed as the inevitable result of war. Unlike most comic book characters, Von Hammer does not have an arch-enemy, though a French pilot known as The Hangman was a persistent opponent. The majority of Von Hammer's opponents followed the same code of honor as he did, which included not attacking a helpless pilot. Created by Robert Kanigher and Joe Kubert, the Enemy Ace was taken loosely from the real-life Red Baron, Manfred von Richthofen. Both flew Crimson Red Fokker DR1 Triplanes. Both were of aristocratic blood. Both awarded themselves a trophy with each downed enemy plane. Both were the highest scoring flying ace of the First World War. The main difference between the two was that Von Hammer survived to old age, whereas Von Richthofen was shot down and killed before the war ended. The character's stories have been praised as among DC's strongest war stories of the Silver Age of comic books. He was revived for a few graphic novels. The first was Enemy Ace: War Idyll (1990) by George Pratt,Enemy Ace: War Idyll at the Grand Comics Database where Hammer is revealed to have lived until 1969, dying peacefully upon turning over his memoirs to and concluding his interviews with a troubled Vietnam War veteran-turned-journalist. Tim Truman's Guns Of The Dragon 1998 mini-series saw Von Hammer in 1927 China teaming up with an elderly Bat Lash and Biff Bradley, the brother of Slam Bradley against Miss Fear and Vandal Savage on an adventure to Dinosaur Island. Cover of Enemy Ace - War in Heaven TPB. A more recent work is Garth Ennis's Enemy Ace: War in Heaven (2001), with art by Chris Weston and Russ Heath. Here, von Hammer's character and story arc is based on several real-life German pilots', notably Adolf Galland. The series recounts the pilot's activities during World War II where he is persuaded to once again fight as a pilot of the Luftwaffe. Von Hammer is placed in charge of his own gruppe and initially serves on the Eastern Front. Though no friend to the Nazi regime, he rapidly amasses numerous kills flying a red-painted Bf 109 against the Russians, and later in defense of Germany (flying a scarlet Me 262) against American bombers. Nevertheless, von Hammer becomes increasingly disillusioned as he continues to witness the horrors of war. During a battle, he is shot down and crashes near Leningrad. In his attempts to make it back to his own lines, he witnesses many horrible sights on the Russian front, including cannibalism. In 1945, after bailing out of his damaged aircraft, he inadvertently parachutes into the Dachau concentration camp and is outraged to discover the German perpetration of the Holocaust. He proposes a mutiny upon returning to his airbase and later surrenders his Jagdverband to advancing Allied troops, namely Sgt. Rock's Easy Company, after setting fire to the fighter unit's remaining aircraft. Von Hammer makes a guest appearance of sorts as an opponent of General Wade Eiling's father in a tale set during the First World War. In 2008, he is featured in Bruce Jones' The War that Time Forgot. He also appears in Booster Gold in 2009, during World War I. When Booster is thrown back in time and caught in the middle of the war, alongside Cyrus Lord, the ancestor of Maxwell Lord, von Hammer aids their escape from captivity behind German lines rather than abet their torture and further stain his hands with blood.Booster Gold Vol. 2, #16 Von Hammer's descendants A possible descendant of Von Hammer appears in the story \\"Ghost of the Killer Skies\\" in Detective Comics #404 (Oct. 1970). Batman investigates sabotage and murder taking place during shooting of a biographical film based on Von Hammer. The mastermind behind the sabotage is stunt pilot Heinrich Frans, who bears a strong resemblance to Von Hammer and claims that he was his ancestor. Believing that Von Hammer was a ruthless man, Frans is outraged that the film's story has his ancestor showing respect and mercy to his enemies, despite Batman countering that Von Hammer's story is more one of \\"a man caught between his feeling of duty and his own best instincts\\". Frans falls to his death during an aerial duel with Batman, both men using vintage World War I planes. During the duel, it is heavily implied that the spirit of Von Hammer helps Batman pilot his craft far better than the crimefighter could on his own. At the end, it is not confirmed if Heinrich Frans was indeed Von Hammer's descendant. In issue #139 of the Robin series, von Hammer's great-granddaughter Lieutenant Ilsa von Hammer appeared as part of a group of soldiers that included Johnny Cloud's grandson and a legendary soldier known only as the Veteran. This group, handling missions which may be more unusual than the normal military is equipped for, recruits Robin to assist on their missions. Another possible descendant appears in Superman #689. Will Von Hammer works as a private investigator in Berlin. He possesses some superhuman invulnerability as he is also the descendant of World War II hero Stormy Foster. In DC's 'New 52' Shade mini-series, Will helps the Shade in tracking down the latter's past.

The 84th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of- seven playoff played between the American League (AL) champion Minnesota Twins and the National League (NL) champion St. Louis Cardinals. The Twins defeated the Cardinals four games to three to win the Series. Twins pitcher Frank Viola was named as the 1987 World Series MVP. It was the first World Series to feature games played indoors, and the first in which the home team won every game; this happened again in (also a Twins championship, over the Atlanta Braves) and in with the Arizona Diamondbacks defeating the New York Yankees. The World Series win was the first for the Twins franchise since , when it was located in Washington, D.C., and known as the Washington Senators. This was the third of four World Series played entirely on artificial turf, with the others in , , and . This is the first World Series in which the series logo appeared on the jerseys; only the Cardinals wore it. Both contestants in the following year's World Series wore a patch. Summary The 1987 World Series was notable in several regards: It featured the first World Series games played in an indoor stadium (the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome) and, to date, the last World Series game to start earlier than prime time in the eastern United States (Game 6 started at 4:00 p.m. ET/3:00 p.m. CT), and it was the first World Series in which all games were won by the home team. (Four previous series had the home team winning the first six games, including the 1965 World Series, when the Twins dropped Game 7 to the Dodgers.) The bottom half of the ninth inning was never played in any game of this Series, the first and only time this has happened. In 1987, the Twins set the record for the worst (full 162 game) regular season win-loss record of any World Series championship team (85‚Äì77, .525). This record stood until it was broken when the Cardinals won the 2006 Series after going 83‚Äì78 (.516). Besides setting a record for the worst regular season winning percentage for a World Series winner and hosting the first World Series game indoors, the Twins were the first team to enter the World Series having been outscored in the regular season. The Twins, as a team, were outnumbered in virtually every major statistical category in 1987. As ABC play-by-play commentator Al Michaels put it in the pre-game show for Game 1 \\"They were out everything!\\" The Cardinals posted a 95‚Äì67 record during the regular season, but were affected by injuries throughout the postseason, most notably with the loss of their lone home run threat, first baseman Jack Clark, due to a sprained right ankle suffered in a game in Montreal on September 9. During the regular season, Clark led the National League in both on-base percentage and slugging percentage despite playing in Busch Memorial Stadium, which was reputed to be the league's most extreme \\"pitcher's park.\\" He hit 35 home runs in 131 games, and was the only person on the team to hit more than 12. The player on the team who hit 12, starting third baseman Terry Pendleton (though named to the World Series roster) was hampered with a ribcage injury. Normally a switch-hitter, Pendleton was only able to swing lefthanded during the World Series and was also unable to play the field and thus was relegated to pinch-hitting duties or being the designated hitter in the games in Minnesota started by right- handed starters. Game 7 was won by Minnesota on the 35th birthday of the Twins' Roy Smalley ‚Äì and was also the last game of his career. Smalley appeared in four games as a pinch-hitter and reached base all four times on a double, an error, and two walks. Matchups =Game 1= A raucous, sold-out Metrodome met the Cardinals on October 17, stunning them at times with the degree of noise. The crowd noise in the Metrodome could exceed 110 decibels SPL. The Cardinals struggled defensively, with outfielder Willie McGee losing sight of pop flies against the Metrodome's white roof in the fourth and eighth innings, and infielder Tom Lawless committing an infield error in the sixth inning. However, none of those miscues contributed to Twins runs. The Twins' aggressive play further compounded the problems of the Cards, and the game ended as a 10‚Äì1 blowout. Starting pitcher Frankie \\"Sweet Music\\" Viola had little trouble with the Cardinals' potent lineup. For the Twins, Dan Gladden hit a grand slam and totaled five RBIs, capping off a seven-run fourth inning, with Steve Lombardozzi adding a two-run homer, while Kent Hrbek had two RBIs. Frank Viola was scheduled to be best man at his brother's wedding, but had to cancel when the Twins reached the World Series as it fell on the same night as Game 1, in which he was scheduled as starter. ABC showed clips of the wedding throughout the game's broadcast. =Game 2= While improving on their game one performance, the Cards were unable to hold the Twins offense again and fell behind 7‚Äì0 before beginning to rally. The Cards' total of nine hits was just one short of the Twins but their bats lacked power as they managed only one double against three doubles and two home runs hit by Minnesota. Gary Gaetti hit a homer in the second. The Twins broke the game open in the fourth, scoring six runs resulting in starter Danny Cox being pulled from the game. The final score was 8‚Äì4. Randy Bush and Tim Laudner each came through with a pair of two-run-scoring hits in the fourth, with Laudner's being a home run and Bush's being a double. Bert Blyleven pitched seven innings of two-run baseball for the win. =Game 3= Traveling down the Mississippi, to the open air of Busch Stadium, Game 3 saw a tense pitching duel between Twins starter Les Straker and John Tudor of the Cardinals. This match-up was also notable for Straker being the first Venezuelan to pitch in a World Series game. After five scoreless innings by both teams, the Twins broke through in the top of the sixth inning. Greg Gagne walked and Kirby Puckett got on base to move Gagne into scoring position. Tom Brunansky's RBI single looked like all the offense the game would see. But, in the bottom of the seventh, Juan Berenguer, in relief of Straker, surrendered leadoff back-to-back singles to Jose Oquendo and Tony Pe√±a. Terry Pendleton sacrificed the runners to second and third, and Vince Coleman slammed a two-run double to give the Cards a 2‚Äì1 lead. Ozzie Smith followed by singling in Coleman for the final run, and Todd Worrell closed out saving the win for Tudor. =Game 4= In Game 4, the Twins scored first on Greg Gagne‚Äôs home run, but the Cardinals tied it on a Jim Lindeman RBI single. Tom Lawless hit a three-run homer in the fourth off Viola (only his second Major League homer after going 2 for 25 during the regular season), one of Viola's five earned runs in the game and six runs in the fourth. However, the Cards weren't done scoring. Dan Schatzeder allowed another RBI single to Lindeman and a two-run double to Willie McGee. Joe Niekro and George Frazier shut the Redbirds out the rest of the game. Bob Forsch got the win with innings of one run relief. Starter Greg Mathews was injured in the fourth inning and was unable to play for the rest of the series. Ken Dayley got the save. Just prior to Game 4, Reggie Jackson, who was working as a field reporter for ABC's coverage of the 1987 World Series, admitted that he didn't know who Tom Lawless was. =Game 5= Game 5 was a much closer contest, with the Cardinals coming out victorious by a score of 4‚Äì2. Curt Ford hit a two-run single in the sixth, breaking a scoreless pitcher's duel between Danny Cox and Bert Blyleven. By the end of the seventh, the Cards were up 4‚Äì0. The Twins scored two in the eighth on a triple by Gary Gaetti off reliever Todd Worrell and made a game of it but eventually relinquished the save to him as Gaetti failed to score. The Cardinals stole five bases in Game 5, the most for team since the 1907 Chicago Cubs. =Game 6= Cardinals Second Baseman Tommy Herr. The Series returned to the Metrodome with the Twins facing elimination (a position they would find themselves in four years later against the Atlanta Braves). ABC allowed the game to be played at 3 p.m. CT (4 p.m. ET) on Saturday afternoon ‚Äì the only day game of the series, and the last World Series game to date to be played in the daytime (although as the game was played in the Metrodome, the game took place under artificial lighting). The Cardinals drew first blood off Les Straker on a Tommy Herr home run in the first, and the Twins countered with two in their half of the first on RBI singles by Kirby Puckett and Don Baylor. The Cardinals soon tied it in the second on a Jose Oquendo RBI single. In the fourth, the Cards chased Straker when Dan Driessen led off with a double to right and went to third on a Willie McGee single. McGee took second on the attempted throw home by center fielder Kirby Puckett. Terry Pendleton followed by singling home Driessen and Oquendo hit a sacrifice fly to make it 4‚Äì2. Another run scored for the Cards in the fifth when lefty Dan Schatzeder walked Ozzie Smith. Smith went to second on a groundout, to third on a flyout, and scored on another McGee single. But, in the bottom of the fifth, the Twins began to claw back against John Tudor. Puckett led off with a single and was doubled in by Gary Gaetti. Benefitting from use of the designated hitter in their home ballpark, the Twins then tied it on a mammoth home run by their DH, Don Baylor. After Tom Brunansky followed with a single, the Twins took the lead for good when Steve Lombardozzi singled him with two out on a close play at the plate. The Twins then blew the game open in the sixth. Greg Gagne led off with an infield single and Puckett walked. A passed ball by Tony Pe√±a advanced the runners. With first base open and one out, Cards veteran Bob Forsch intentionally walked Baylor to load the bases. After Brunansky popped out, left-hander Ken Dayley was brought in to face the lefty-hitting Kent Hrbek. Hrbek finally broke out of his slump and hit a grand slam. Brunansky drove in the final run in the eighth and the Twins had staved off defeat. =Game 7= The 500th World Series game played, Game 7 forced a National Football League game between the Denver Broncos and the Minnesota Vikings, originally scheduled for that afternoon at the Metrodome, to be played the following night (also on ABC). Joe Magrane of the St. Louis Cardinals became only the sixth rookie pitcher to start the seventh game of a World Series. He also is the only pitcher in World Series history to start Games 1 and 7 of a World Series without any starts in between, as the Cardinals' Game 4 starter, Greg Mathews, had had to be removed early due to an injury and was unavailable for the remainder of the Series. Magrane had actually started the 1987 season pitching for the Cardinals Triple-A team, the Louisville Redbirds. In the second, the Cardinals looked poised to send Frank Viola to an early shower. Three straight no-out singles by Jim Lindeman, Willie McGee, and Tony Pe√±a plated the first run. Viola settled down to retire the next two hitters, but then Steve Lake singled in McGee for a 2‚Äì0 lead. Viola settled into a groove, however, and allow only two more hits and no runs in eight strong innings. The Twins came back in their half of the second on a Steve Lombardozzi RBI single, but not before a missed call at home plate by umpire Dave Phillips had already cost the Twins a run. Twins DH Don Baylor reached base on a hit-by-pitch by Magrane to lead off the inning and Tom Brunansky singled him to second. With one out, Tim Laudner singled to left and Baylor was called out at home on a throw from Vince Coleman in left, while replays clearly showed Baylor was safe. Lombardozzi then singled in Brunansky. In the fifth, the Twins tied the score when Greg Gagne reached on an infield hit and Kirby Puckett drove him in with a double. Incidentally, replays showed Gagne to be out on his infield hit, thus this run served to counteract the run the Twins lost in the second on the missed call on Baylor at the plate. The Twins seemed on the verge of taking the lead when Gary Gaetti followed Puckett with a walk and went to second when Puckett was thrown out by Lake trying to advance to third on a wild pitch that was deflected when it hit the home plate umpire in the face-mask. Baylor followed with a single to left, but Coleman threw out Gaetti at the plate in a violent collision with Lake. Coleman became the first outfielder to throw two runners out at the plate in one World Series game. Final out victim Willie McGee. The sixth inning proved to be controversial. In the top of the sixth, Tom Herr was picked-off of first base, and tagged out in a rundown. In the third missed call of the game, Herr got in the rundown and Lombardozzi ran him back to first where Kent Hrbek was standing off the bag near the basepath. Lombardozzi tossed the ball towards Hrbek and the ball sailed past him but into the glove of Viola behind the bag. Viola had come over to take part in the rundown. Herr was hindered by Hrbek returning to the bag, but clearly reached the bag safely before Viola tagged him. However, first base umpire Lee Weyer called Herr out. Weyer's view was blocked by Kent Hrbek and, according to the broadcast crew, Viola made the tag late and Hrbek should have been called for interference. Had this been called, Herr would have been safe, awarded second base, and the Cardinals would have had a runner at second with one out. It was the third missed call of the game for the normally highly regarded Weyer--often considered one of the best umpires in baseball, and the Cardinals scored nothing in the 6th. The Twins then took the lead in the bottom of the inning, off Danny Cox, who had relieved Magrane the previous inning. Cox walked Brunansky and Hrbek to lead off, and was replaced by Todd Worrell. As Cox was leaving, he got into an argument with home plate umpire Dave Phillips and was ejected as he was leaving the field. As of 2019, Cox is the last position player to be ejected from a World Series game. After retiring the first batter he faced, Worrell walked pinch-hitter Roy Smalley and struck out Dan Gladden for the second out. The next batter, Gagne, reached first on an infield hit as Brunansky scored the go-ahead run. The Twins' final run came in the eighth on an RBI double by Dan Gladden off Worrell, who stayed in the rest of the game for the Cardinals. Jeff Reardon retired the side in the ninth to give Minnesota their first World Series victory. Twins manager Tom Kelly became the youngest non-playing manager to win the World Series since John McGraw in 1905. By winning in the regulation nine innings, the Twins ensured the 1987 World Series was the first in which no games needed the bottom of the ninth inning. No other World Series since then has had that happen, as the two other Fall Classics in which the home team won every game--1991 and 2001--both included extra inning games and walk-off wins in the bottom of the ninth. :mlb.com coverage of Game 7 Composite box 1987 World Series (4‚Äì3): Minnesota Twins (A.L.) over St. Louis Cardinals (N.L.) Aftermath Although Steve Carlton was not on the Twins' playoff roster, he still attended the White House to be congratulated by President Reagan. While making a photo op with the president, local newspapers listed the names of all of the Minnesota Twins. The only man who wasn't listed (and simply identified as a Secret Service agent) was a tall man wearing dark sunglasses in the back. The man in question was Carlton. After their defeat in the '87 Series, the Cardinals' reign of dominance in the '80s ended. They failed to win their division again until 1996, did not return to the World Series until 2004 and did not win until 2006 in a season where they won two fewer regular season games than the 1987 Twins. In 1988, the Twins actually won more games than in their championship season, finishing with a 91‚Äì71 record. They finished 13 games behind the AL West champion Oakland A's, who won 104 games. The Twins eventually sank towards the bottom of the standings, finishing last in 1990. In 1991, the Twins returned to the playoffs by beating the Blue Jays in the ALCS and winning what many call the greatest World Series played over the Atlanta Braves. The 1987 World Series featured at least two players who went on to win Manager of the Year awards. The Twins' Don Baylor won it in 1995 for his work with the Colorado Rockies while the Cardinals' Tony Pe√±a won it in 2003 for his work with the Kansas City Royals. The success of the 1987 Twins inspired Brandon Walsh (Jason Priestley) in Beverly Hills 90210 to explain why the Twins were the ultimate definition of a team, thus enabling him to win the Dreyer Scholarship. However, his interview included a factual inaccuracy; he said Gladden hit a grand slam in the pivotal Game 4, when in fact Gladden hit one in Game 1, and Hrbek hit one in the pivotal Game 6. Some years after the conclusion of the series it emerged that a lone Metrodome technician had, at his own initiative, tried to influence games on the Twins behalf by adjusting the air conditioning fans while the Twins were at bat. It remains unclear whether this had any effect on game play, or in particular, on games played at the Metrodome during the 1987 World Series. In a February 2015 interview, sportscaster and author Al Michaels (who, as previously mentioned, did play-by-play for ABC's television coverage of the 1987 World Series) alleged the Twins pumped artificial crowd noise into the Metrodome during the 1987 World Series. Responding to Michaels' theory, Twins President Dave St. Peter said that he did not think the Twins needed \\"conspiracy theories\\" in order to win the World Series. Instead, he argued that \\"appreciation and respect\\" should be paid to players like Frank Viola, Gary Gaetti, Kent Hrbek, and Kirby Puckett, who, he said, \\"came out of nowhere to win a championship.\\" The 1987 World Series was the final one that ABC aired that went the full seven games. The next time that ABC broadcast a World Series in 1989, the Oakland Athletics swept the San Francisco Giants in four games. For the final World Series that ABC would broadcast to date, 1995, they split the coverage with NBC. ABC only covered Games 1, 4-5 and a seventh game had it been necessary.

He is most recognised for his lead vocals on the single \\"Seven Drunken Nights\\" and \\"The Irish Rover\\" both charting in the UK top 10 and then performed on TOTP. He was recognisable for his long beard and pale blue eyes and his voice, which was once described by Nathan Joseph as being \\"like the sound of coke being crushed under a door\\".Doyle, J., Bobby Lynch ‚Äì The Forgotten Dubliner, ThreeMonkeysOnline.com, November 2008.

Early life Ronnie Drew was born in D√∫n Laoghaire, County Dublin in 1934. Although he was so intimately associated with being \\"a Dubliner\\", he would sometimes say, \\"I was born and grew up in D√∫n Laoghaire, and no true Dubliner would accept that at all!\\",Pearson, N., The Bells of Hell, (Program), 1974. a quip that Andy Irvine relayed in his song \\"O'Donoghue's\\".Mozaik ‚Äì Changing Trains, Compass Records 744682, 2007. Drew was educated at CBS Eblana and used to \\"mitch\\" and cycle up to Leopardstown Racecourse. Despite his aversion to education, he was considered the most intelligent in his class by schoolfriend and future Irish film censor, Sheamus Smith. Drew had also sung as a boy soprano before his voice broke. Career In the 1950s, Drew moved to Spain to teach English and learn Spanish and flamenco guitar. His interest in folk music began at the age of 19. When he returned to Ireland, he performed in the Gate Theatre with John Molloy and soon went into the music business full-time, after holding a number of short-term jobs--including one at the Dublin's telephone exchange. In 1962, he founded the Ronnie Drew Group with Luke Kelly, Barney McKenna and Ciar√°n Bourke. They soon changed their name to The Dubliners--with John Sheahan joining shortly afterwards to form the definitive line-up--and quickly became one of the best known Irish folk groups. They played at first in O'Donoghue's Pub in Merrion Row, Dublin 2 where they were often accompanied by Mary Jordan on the spoons and vocalist Ann Mulqueen, a friend of McKenna's. Mary Jordan's mother, Peggy Jordan, introduced them to the Abbey Tavern in Howth, which became a regular Monday night venue for the emerging group. They also played across the road in the Royal Hotel, at all- night parties in Peggy's large house in Kenilworth Square in Rathgar, and in John Molloy's flat at Ely Place. Drew left the Dubliners in 1974. He rejoined in 1979, but then left for good in 1995, though he did reunite with the group in 2002 for a 40th anniversary celebration. He made several television appearances with the group between 2002‚Äì05. From 1995 onwards, Drew pursued a solo career. He recorded with many artists, including Christy Moore, The Pogues, Antonio Breschi, Dropkick Murphys, Eleanor Shanley and others. He did a number of \\"one-man shows\\"--he was accompanied by various guitarists--during this period, such as Songs and Stories, Ronnie, I Hardly Knew Ya and Ronnie. These shows consisted of stories about people such as Brendan Behan, Patrick Kavanagh and Se√°n O'Casey, as well as Drew singing their songs. He fronted a campaign to encourage the use of Dublin's light-rail infrastructure (the DART) and, before that, the \\"My Dublin\\" ads for radio stations 98FM and FM104. He narrated a retelling of the great Irish Myths and Legends--scripted by Steven Byrne--over a six CD set in 2006. He also narrated the stories of Oscar Wilde in his distinctive voice for a series released on CD by the News of the World newspaper. Both were re-released as CD box sets in 2010. Ronnie Drew in 2004 On 22 August 2006, Drew was honoured in a ceremony where his hand prints were added to the \\"Walk of Fame\\" outside Dublin's Gaiety Theatre. Declining health and death In September 2006, Drew was reported to be in ill health after being admitted to St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin, to undergo tests for suspected cancer. The Evening Herald reported that his apparent illness was due to years of heavy drinking. However, according to a fan site dedicated to The Dubliners, it was reported that he was undergoing treatment for throat cancer. Drew had been a teetotaler for a number of years, with an occasional relapse, but he remained a regular smoker. He appeared on Ireland's The Late Late Show on 15 December 2006 along with Phil Coulter, where he discussed his recent health scares. Despite his failing health, he featured on an album entitled Pearls--produced by Niall Austin--with work he did with Jah Wobble. His wife of more than 40 years, Deirdre Drew (n√©e McCartan, daughter of Patrick McCartan) died on 7 June 2007 at St Vincent's Hospital, just one day before he was scheduled to return to performing live at the Legends of Irish Folk concert, which also featured Johnny McEvoy, Ralph McTell and Finbar Furey.Wife of Dubliners star Ronnie Drew dies, Irish Independent, 8 June 2007. On 25 October 2007, Drew--now bald and beardless--appeared on Ryan Confidential on RT√â 1 to give an interview about his role in The Dubliners, his life since leaving the band and being diagnosed with throat cancer. Later in 2007, he again appeared on The Late Late Show, where he spoke some more about the death of his wife and his ongoing treatment for cancer. Drew died in St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin on 16 August 2008, following his long illness. He was buried three days later in Redford Cemetery in Greystones. Tributes =\\"The Ballad of Ronnie Drew\\"= On 19 February 2008, a song was released called \\"The Ballad of Ronnie Drew\\" performed by a number of famous Irish musicians or musicians living in Ireland. This included members of The Dubliners, U2, Sin√©ad O'Connor, Christy Dignam of Aslan, Robert Hunter of the Grateful Dead, K√≠la, Christy Moore, Andrea Corr, Moya Brennan, Shane MacGowan, Liam √ì Maonla√≠, Bob Geldof, Damien Dempsey, Gavin Friday, Iona Green, Jerry Fish, Paul Brady, Paddy Casey, Mick Pyro, Mundy, Chris de Burgh, Ronan Keating, Jack L, Eleanor Shanley, Mary Black, Declan O'Rourke, Mary Coughlan, and Joe Elliott of Def Leppard and The Chieftains. Originally, the song had been written to include Drew himself but was changed into a tribute to him as his health was declining. Proceeds from sale of the single went to the Irish Cancer Society, at Drew's request. The song was also performed live on The Late Late Show on 22 February with Drew in attendance as an audience member, and entered the Irish Single Charts at No. 2. =September Song= Also in 2008, RT√â broadcast a documentary on Drew in May ‚Äì as part of its Arts Lives series. Called September Song, it featured Drew's recollections of growing up in his grandmother's house in D√∫n Laoghaire, the foundation of The Dubliners in O'Donoghue's pub on Merrion Row, the days spent touring the world, the loss of his wife, and his own battle with cancer. Interviewed in September Song are his son Phelim, his daughter Cliodhna, plus friends and fans such as Bono, Billy Connolly and Damien Dempsey. September Song was produced by Oscar- nominated producer Noel Pearson and directed by Sinead O'Brien. The name of the documentary comes from Drew's recording of \\"September Song\\"--the Kurt Weill and Maxwell Anderson song made popular through recordings by a number of artists, including Frank Sinatra--which features on his 2006 solo album, There's Life in the Old Dog Yet. =Other tributes= Andy Irvine mentioned Drew in the song \\"O'Donoghue's\\" he recorded with his band Mozaik on the album Changing Trains,Sleeve notes from Mozaik ‚Äì Changing Trains, Compass Records 744682, 2007. and again on the live album Andy Irvine/70th Birthday Concert at Vicar St 2012.Sleeve notes from Andy Irvine/70th Birthday Concert at Vicar St 2012, Andy Irvine AK-5, 2014. The Tossers, a Chicago-based celtic punk band, dedicated their album On a Fine Spring Evening to his memory. Their song \\"St. Stephen's Day\\" includes the line \\"I could go on up to Wicklow and throw a rose on Ronnie's grave\\". Flogging Molly lead singer David King listed Drew as one of the greatest losses of a musician, in recent years, calling him \\"A REAL folk singer.\\" at a show in Moscow, Idaho. Gaelic Storm named Drew on the song \\"I Was Raised on Black and Tans\\" from their 2010 album Cabbage. \\"I was raised on black and tans...on Ronnie Drew and Van the Man\\" is a line from the song. Dropkick Murphys, a Celtic punk band from Boston, Massachusetts, dedicated the song \\"(F)lannigan's Ball\\" to Drew during their set at the Reading Festival in 2008. The Pogues' Spider Stacy joined the band for this song. Stacy and Drew were featured as guest vocalists on the studio recording of the song, one of the last Drew recorded before his death. Australian-Irish Folk Punk band The Rumjacks from Australia name-checks Drew in their hit song \\"An Irish Pub Song\\" about the ailing quality of some Irish pubs. \\"It's over to me, and over to you! We'll skip along the avenue, and who the hell is Ronnie Drew? We got us an Irish pub!\\" The Last Session: A Fond Farewell In the final months before his death, Drew recorded a number of songs in a traditional jazz style. A number of stars from the music world, including Mary Coughlan and Damien Dempsey, joined him in duets on the album. It was produced by Hugh Buckley and released in November 2008 by Celtic Collections. Legacy Irish President Mary McAleese said Drew had brought great pleasure to people at home and abroad and had re-energised and refreshened Ireland's unique musical heritage; the Taoiseach Brian Cowen also described him as \\"iconic\\".

Appearance and anatomy Blotched upside-down catfish are small, reaching a maximum of SL. Like other members of the family Mochikidae, they have large eyes, a large dorsal fin and three pair of barbels. These fish are adapted to spend most of their time upside-down. This is reflected in the fish's pigmentation ‚Äì their bellies are darker than their backs, a form of countershading. These fish have lighter colors on the top of their bodies and darker colors below used for camouflage. The lighter colors on the top of them make it harder for predators to see the fish when looking up toward the sky but only when the fish are swimming upside-down. Ecology and behaviour Synodontis nigriventris are mostly nocturnal, and feed on insects, crustaceans, and plant matter. These fish lay eggs. The young fish do not swim upside-down until they are about two months old. Adults swim and rest upside down in the water. They swim faster when upside down, and are more likely to be upside down around objects or at the water bottom. The more objects around the fish, the more they tend to swim upside down. When close to an object, the fish puts its ventral side closest to the object. It rarely swims in the middle of the water, preferring to swim either at the bottom or at the surface. By swimming upside down when it feeds, it can readily catch prey at the surface from beneath. In the aquarium The blotched upside-down catfish is well suited to aquariums because of its small size (typically 9 or 10 cm or less) and peaceful demeanor.

Farmington Hills, Mich.: Gale, Cengage Learning. 1980- 2009. is an American cartoonist for both underground and mainstream comic books, best known for his creation Cutey Bunny. Biography Joshua Quagmire (the name is a pseudonym) was raised in the Los Angeles area, though he has remarked that his grandfather served in the Canadian Forces in World War I; Quagmire has dedicated a story, \\"The Last Time I Saw Tommy\\", to his grandfather. On the few occasions he has drawn himself into a story, he has not shown his own face. He is a frequent guest at the San Diego Comic Convention. His most enduring work has been the comic Cutey Bunny, which was first published in 1982. Cutey Bunny, a furry superheroine and a pastiche of Go Nagai's Cutey Honey, appeared in the self-produced underground comic Army Surplus Komikz from 1982 to 1985 as well as in Cerebus' Unique Story section. The story, writing, and art style recall not only manga, but the madcap MAD Magazine and syndicated comic strips of the 1940s and 1950s, together with a burlesque sense of both humor and sexuality. Quagmire uses an \\"ensemble cast\\" of characters who will tend to show up no matter what the situation or genre; along with Cutey, they include: * Vicky Feldhyser, a sadomasochistic switch lesbian fox and sometimes-rival secret agent to Cutey, whom she lusts after * Taffy, Cutey's little sister * Fatty Tubbins, a cat, and Cutey's friend and companion (who is also frequently credited as Quagmire's inker) * The Space Gophers, a quintet (or sometimes more) of not exceptionally bright interplanetary-traveling gophers, all of whom are named \\"Al\\" * Pandora, a Scottish-brogued female robot who travels with the Gophers * Gran'ma Phooby, Cutey's \\"grandmother\\", of indeterminate species and dreadful cooking skill * Heidi and Etsuko, a pair of German and Japanese (respectively) scantily clad female elves, typically involved in some nefarious espionage plot * The Purple Puffle, an odd creature who appears mainly as a background ornament In 1985, the comic was nearly picked up for publishing by Aardvark-Vanaheim, but the deal fell through and Quagmire continued to self-publish. There are a few projects which Quagmire has done outside this ensemble, such as the more serious CyberFox or the more overtly sexual Bronco Bunny. Quagmire is also fond of introducing caricatures of real personalities to his comics. Bob Hope and Bing Crosby, in character as they were in the popular \\"Road to...\\" movies, frequently appear to help Cutey Bunny. A frequent adversary is \\"Uncle Joe\\"‚Äîquite obviously Joseph Stalin‚Äîand his marionette henchman, \\"Howdy Ivan\\". And Cutey, as an American secret agent, is often shown taking orders from a doddering Ronald Reagan or a sinister George H. W. Bush. Even fellow comic book writer Chris Claremont appeared in one issue, helping unmask a villain who turned out to be Adolf Hitler in disguise. Although politics was never taboo in Quagmire's comics, they have been more emphasized in his recent works. Typically, he has been even-handed in his treatment‚Äîhe recounts the tale of a socialist friend of his, who, upon reading an Uncle Joe story, could not determine whether it was for or against socialism and said that it seemed to be \\"anti-every ideology\\". However, Quagmire has become more pointed in his criticism of George W. Bush and other contemporary leaders based on Quagmire's opposition to war and the current state of world economics and the environment. For example, in a 2004 story, Heidi and Etsuko join the Department of Homeland Security, and are dispatched to the Middle East to search for weapons of mass destruction‚Äîand remove the stickers on them which read \\"Made in U.S.A.\\" However, they succeed only in finding weapons in practically every country in the area except Iraq. Currently Quagmire is publishing an online comic called \\"Bunz & Katz\\" which began running in 2012. The strip is about two alien scouts, Bunz - an alien who has been altered to look like an anime \\"sailor chick\\" so as to blend in with \\"Dirt's\\" defenders, and her henchbot Katz. Send to Earth by the all conquering but now hopelessly obsolete and ancient NegaFleet, the two hapless protagonists attempt to prepare the way for Earth's destruction but things just never seem to work out for them. Their interactions with the inhabitants of \\"Dirt\\" (as Katz translated \\"Earth\\") and the ignorance of Earthly ways make up the majority of the humor along with occasional asides into popular cultural events or politics.

Background and education He was born in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, the son of Reverend William Jowitt, Rector of Stevenage, by his wife Louisa Margaret Allen. At the age of nine he was sent to Northaw Place, a preparatory school in Potters Bar, Middlesex, where he first met and was looked after by fellow student Clement Attlee, the future Labour Party Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. From Northaw he went to Marlborough College, then to New College, Oxford where he studied law. He was admitted to the Middle Temple on 15 November 1906 and was called to the Bar on 23 June 1909.Williamson, J.B. (1937). The Middle Temple Bench Book. 2nd edition, p.290. Legal and political career (1922‚Äì1931) Jowitt became a member of chambers in Brick Court in London. He proved himself a skilled advocate, attracting attention for his subdued and charming manner when barristers were more inclined to browbeat witnesses. He became a King's Counsel the day before the 1922 general election in which he was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for The Hartlepools. Jowitt was a member of the faction of the Liberal Party led by Herbert Asquith and somewhat radical in his beliefs. He continued to practise law whilst a backbench MP and was not considered a great orator in the House of Commons. Jowitt was re-elected, now part of the re-united Liberal Party, at the 1923 general election, and in 1924, he was a member of the Royal Commission on Lunacy. He lost his seat in the 1924 general election. Jowitt stood successfully in Preston in the 1929 general election, again elected as a Liberal. Following the formation of a minority Labour government, he was offered the position of Attorney General by the new Prime Minister, Ramsay MacDonald. Labour had few experienced lawyers in its ranks in Parliament and had experienced problems filling the positions of legal officers in its first government. Jowitt agreed, but resigned his seat and stood again as a candidate of the Labour Party. At the by-election in July 1929, Preston re-elected him with an increased majority. As was customary, Jowitt received a knighthood upon becoming Attorney General. His work mainly concerned the drafting of government bills, particularly the reversal of the Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act 1927. As was still the custom for the Attorney General, he occasionally prosecuted in high-profile cases, notably Sidney Harry Fox, charged with murdering his mother by suffocating her then setting fire to her hotel room. It was said that a single question from Jowitt (\\"Explain to me why you shut the door?\\") sealed Fox's fate since Fox could think of no convincing answer. Divided loyalties (1931‚Äì1939) When the Labour government split over the financial crisis in 1931, Jowitt was one of only a handful of Labour MPs to follow MacDonald into the National Government. He was uncomfortable in a coalition with the Conservatives but believed that the proposed spending cuts causing the split were necessary, and the coalition was necessary to force them through. Like others who joined the National Government, he was expelled from the Labour Party. He was made a Privy Councillor but found himself in a difficult electoral position when he could not secure the withdrawal of the Conservative candidate in Preston in the 1931 general election. He thus stood instead as the National Labour candidate for the Combined English Universities, but there too, he competed with other candidates supporting the National Government and was defeated. MacDonald persuaded Jowitt to remain as Attorney General in the hope that a new seat could be found to maintain the handful of National Labour positions in the government, but that proved impossible and Jowitt stepped down. He was replaced as Attorney General in January 1932 and returned to the Bar. Though relatively new to the party, Jowitt greatly regretted the split with Labour. He remained close to MacDonald, but after Stanley Baldwin became Prime Minister in 1935, Jowitt began campaigning for Labour. A number of constituency Labour Parties attempted to nominate him as their candidate for the general election that year, but he was still expelled. Unable to stand for Labour, he refused to stand for any other party or as an independent. Jowitt was readmitted to the Labour Party in November 1936. Still a public figure, he was a critical of the National Government's policy of appeasement, and in 1937, he called for the state control of the arms industry and rapid rearmament to face the growing threat of fascism on the Continent. In February 1939 he called for the recreation of the Ministry of Munitions. In October, he was adopted as Labour's candidate at a by-election in Ashton-under-Lyne and was duly elected, unusually unopposed.Kay Halle, The Irrepressible Churchill, (Robson Books, 1966), 44 Churchill ministry (1940‚Äì1945) Eight months later, Winston Churchill appointed Jowitt as Solicitor General in his coalition government. Jowitt dispensed legal advice to the government for two years in World War II before he was placed in charge of planning for reconstruction. He also held Cabinet positions that were mostly sinecures such as Paymaster General and then Minister without Portfolio in that role. In 1944, he became Minister of National Insurance at the head of a new government department. He resigned from the government when Labour left the coalition in May 1945, after Victory in Europe Day, and he was re-elected for Ashton-under- Lyne in the general election in July. Lord Chancellor (1945‚Äì1951) After a landslide victory in the 1945 election, Labour formed its first majority government. Prime Minister Clement Attlee appointed Jowitt as Lord Chancellor. As soon as he was appointed, Jowitt met with US Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson to resolve outstanding points of contention over the draft London Charter, which would govern the procedures of the Nuremberg Trials. He retained the Conservative MP and outgoing Attorney General, Sir David Maxwell- Fyfe, as the official liaison but indicated that the new Attorney General, Sir Hartley Shawcross, would serve as Britain's Chief Prosecutor in the trials themselves. Jowitt introduced and saw signed the United Nations Act 1946, the legislation that governs how the UK subordinates itself to the UN.supremecourt.uk: HM Treasury v Ahmad, etc, 27 Jan 2010 He was raised to the peerage as Baron Jowitt, of Stevenage in the County of Hertford, on 2 August 1945 and entered the House of Lords. He led much important judicial legislation during the life of the Labour government, including an Act of Parliament to grant full legal sovereignty to Canada and a number of other Commonwealth countries. Jowitt was also responsible for some key changes to the legal culture in Britain. He attempted to end political and social imbalances in the Magistrates Courts and is considered to have been the first Lord Chancellor to adopt a policy of appointing judges purely on the basis of merit. As Lord Chancellor, he also served as speaker of the House of Lords, a delicate job given the Conservative majority in the Lords. Christopher Addison, Labour's leader in the Lords, died shortly after the party's defeat in the 1951 general election. Labour was now in opposition, and Jowitt took over as leader of the Labour peers. He was created Viscount Jowitt, of Stevenage in the County of Hertford, on 20 January 1947, and was awarded an earldom by Attlee in the 1951 Prime Minister's Resignation Honours,The Times, Friday, 30 November 1951; pg. 6; Issue 52172; col G: \\"The Resignation Honours: Earldom For Lord Jowitt\\" being created Viscount Stevenage, of Stevenage in the County of Hertford and Earl Jowitt on 24 January 1952. Later political life A senior figure in the party, and a member of the Shadow Cabinet, Jowitt was careful to keep the Labour peers out of the conflict between the Bevanites and Gaitskellites in the early 1950s. The opposition to the Conservative government in the Lords was meagre but sometimes successfully rallied support from government backbenchers. In 1955, for instance, Jowitt led a successful rebellion in the Lords over a government bill to criminalise the medical use of marijuana. Jowitt was a prominent spokesperson against human rights abuses during the suppression of the Mau Mau Uprising in Kenya, teaming up with the Archbishop of Canterbury to launch a review of the circumstances surrounding the resignation of Colonel Arthur Young as Commissioner of Police in the colony.Elkins, C. (2005) Britain's Gulag: The Brutal End of Empire in Kenya, Pimlico: London He stood down as leader in November that year, at the age of 70. Family Jowitt married Lesley McIntyre, a daughter of James Patrick McIntyre, in 1913. He died at Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, in August 1957, aged 72. His peerages did not survive his death, as he had no male heirs. Publications Jowitt wrote two books on espionage and compiled a legal dictionary, which was published posthumously in 1959, completed by Clifford Walsh, and became a standard reference work.

It undergoes alpha decay to stable 206Pb with a half-life of 138.376 days, the longest of all naturally occurring polonium isotopes. First identified in 1898, and also marking the discovery of the element polonium, 210Po is generated in the decay chain of uranium-238 and radium-226. 210Po is a prominent contaminant in the environment, mostly affecting seafood and tobacco. It is also extremely toxic to humans as a result of its intense radioactivity. History The decay chain of uranium-238, known as the uranium series or radium series, of which polonium-210 is a member Schematic of the final steps of the s-process. The red path represents the sequence of neutron captures; blue and cyan arrows represent beta decay, and the green arrow represents the alpha decay of 210Po. It is the short half-lives of 210Bi and 210Po that prevent the formation of heavier elements, instead resulting in a cycle of four neutron captures, two beta decays, and an alpha decay. In 1898, Marie and Pierre Curie discovered a strongly radioactive substance in pitchblende and determined that it was a new element; it was one of the first radioactive elements discovered. Having identified it as such, they named the element polonium after Marie's home country, Poland. Willy Marckwald discovered a similar radioactive activity in 1902 and named it radio- tellurium, and at roughly the same time, Ernest Rutherford identified the same activity in his analysis of the uranium decay chain and named it radium F (originally radium E). By 1905, Rutherford concluded that all these observations were due to the same substance, 210Po. Further discoveries and the concept of isotopes, first proposed in 1913 by Frederick Soddy, firmly placed 210Po as the penultimate step in the uranium series. In 1943, 210Po was studied as a possible neutron initiator in nuclear weapons, as part of the Dayton Project. In subsequent decades, concerns for the safety of workers handling 210Po led to extensive studies on its health effects. In the 1950s, scientists of the United States Atomic Energy Commission at Mound Laboratories, Ohio explored the possibility of using 210Po in radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) as a heat source to power satellites. A 2.5-watt atomic battery using 210Po was developed by 1958. However, the isotope plutonium-238 was chosen instead, as it has a longer half-life of 87.7 years. Polonium-210 was used to kill Russian dissident and ex-FSB officer Alexander V. Litvinenko in 2006, and was suspected as a possible cause of Yasser Arafat's death, following exhumation and analysis of his corpse in 2012‚Äì2013. Decay properties 210Po is an alpha emitter that has a half-life of 138.376 days; it decays directly to stable 206Pb. The majority of the time, 210Po decays by emission of an alpha particle only, not by emission of an alpha particle and a gamma ray; about one in 100,000 decays results in the emission of a gamma ray. This low gamma ray production rate makes it more difficult to find and identify this isotope. Rather than gamma ray spectroscopy, alpha spectroscopy is the best method of measuring this isotope. Owing to its much shorter half-life, a milligram of 210Po emits as many alpha particles per second as 5 grams of 226Ra. A few curies of 210Po emit a blue glow caused by excitation of surrounding air. 210Po occurs in minute amounts in nature, where it is the penultimate isotope in the uranium series decay chain. It is generated via beta decay from 210Pb and 210Bi. The astrophysical s-process is terminated by the decay of 210Po, as the neutron flux is insufficient to lead to further neutron captures in the short lifetime of 210Po. Instead, 210Po alpha decays to 206Pb, which then captures more neutrons to become 210Po and repeats the cycle, thus consuming the remaining neutrons. This results in a buildup of lead and bismuth, and ensures that heavier elements such as thorium and uranium are only produced in the much faster r-process. Production Although 210Po occurs in trace amounts in nature, it is not abundant enough (0.1 ppb) for extraction from uranium ore to be feasible. Instead, most 210Po is produced synthetically, through neutron bombardment of 209Bi in a nuclear reactor. This process converts 209Bi to 210Bi, which beta decays to 210Po with a five-day half-life. Through this method, approximately of 210Po are produced in Russia and shipped to the United States every month for commercial applications. Applications A single gram of 210Po generates 140 watts of power. Because it emits many alpha particles, which are stopped within a very short distance in dense media and release their energy, 210Po has been used as a lightweight heat source to power thermoelectric cells in artificial satellites; for instance, a 210Po heat source was also in each of the Lunokhod rovers deployed on the surface of the Moon, to keep their internal components warm during the lunar nights.A. Wilson, Solar System Log, (London: Jane's Publishing Company Ltd, 1987), p. 64. Some anti-static brushes, used for neutralizing static electricity on materials like photographic film, contain a few microcuries of 210Po as a source of charged particles. 210Po was also used in initiators for atomic bombs through the (Œ±,n) reaction with beryllium. Hazards 210Po is extremely toxic; it and other polonium isotopes are some of the most radiotoxic substances to humans. With one microgram being more than enough to kill the average adult, 210Po is 250,000 times more toxic than hydrogen cyanide by weight; it is also thought that one gram of 210Po is enough to kill 50 million people and sicken another 50 million. This is a consequence of its ionizing alpha radiation, as alpha particles are especially damaging to organic tissues inside the body. However, 210Po does not pose a threat outside the body, for alpha particles cannot penetrate human skin. The toxicity of 210Po stems entirely from its radioactivity. It is not chemically toxic in itself, but its solubility in aqueous solution as well as that of its salts poses a hazard because its spread throughout the body is facilitated in solution. Intake of 210Po occurs primarily through contaminated air, food, or water, as well as through open wounds. Once inside the body, 210Po concentrates in soft tissues (especially in the reticuloendothelial system) and the bloodstream. Its biological half-life is approximately 50 days. In the environment, 210Po can accumulate in seafood. It has been detected in various organisms in the Baltic Sea, where it can propagate in, and thus contaminate, the food chain. 210Po is also known to contaminate vegetation, primarily originating from the decay of atmospheric radon-222 and absorption from soil. In particular, 210Po attaches to, and concentrates in, tobacco leaves. Elevated concentrations of 210Po in tobacco were documented as early as 1964, and cigarette smokers were thus found to be exposed to considerably greater doses of radiation from 210Po and its parent 210Pb. Heavy smokers may be exposed to the same amount of radiation (estimates vary from 100 ¬µSv to 160 mSv per year) as individuals in Poland were from Chernobyl fallout traveling from Ukraine. As a result, 210Po is most dangerous when inhaled from cigarette smoke, providing further evidence for a link between smoking and lung cancer.

It was discovered by William Herschel on October 6, 1784. The galaxy is a member of the NGC 1023 group of galaxies in the Local Supercluster. It has an H II nucleus. The object is visible in small to moderate size telescopes as a faint elongated smear of light with a dust lane visible in larger apertures. In 1999, the Hubble Space Telescope imaged NGC 891 in infrared. In 2005, due to its attractiveness and scientific interest, NGC 891 was selected to be the first light image of the Large Binocular Telescope. In 2012, it was again used as a first light image of the Lowell Discovery Telescope with the Large Monolithic Imager. Supernova SN 1986J was discovered on August 21, 1986 at apparent magnitude 14.  Properties  NGC 891 looks as the Milky Way would look like when viewed edge-on (some astronomers have even noted how similar to NGC 891 our galaxy looks as seen from the Southern HemisphereThe Milky Way in relation to other galaxies) and, in fact, both galaxies are considered very similar in terms of luminosity and size; studies of the dynamics of its molecular hydrogen have also proven the likely presence of a central bar. Despite this, recent high-resolution images of its dusty disk show unusual filamentary patterns. These patterns are extending into the halo of the galaxy, away from its galactic disk. Scientists presume that supernova explosions caused this interstellar dust to be thrown out of the galactic disk toward the halo. It may also be possible that the light pressure from surrounding stars causes this phenomenon. The galaxy is a member of a small group of galaxies, sometimes called the NGC 1023 Group. Other galaxies in this group are the NGCs 925, 949, 959, 1003, 1023, and 1058, and the UGCs 1807, 1865 (DDO 19), 2014 (DDO 22), 2023 (DDO 25), 2034 (DDO 24), and 2259. Its outskirts are populated by multiple low-surface brightness, coherent, and vast substructures, like giant streams that loop around the parent galaxy up to distances of approximately 50 kpc. The bulge and the disk are surrounded by a flat and thick cocoon-like stellar structure. These have vertical and radial distances of up to 15 kpc and 40 kpc, respectively, and are interpreted as the remnant of a satellite galaxy disrupted and in the process of being absorbed by NGC 891.

Watkins, who also designed the Provo Third Ward Chapel and Amusement Hall, The Knight Block Building, and the Thomas N. Taylor Mansion.  Karl G. Maeser  Karl G. Maeser was born in Germany. Karl Maeser and his wife Anna Therese Meith were baptized into the LDS Church in 1855, and left shortly thereafter for Utah. Detained on their journey due to their decision to serve various missions for the church, the Maesers did not arrive in Utah until 1860. In Utah, Maeser operated various schools and served other missions until the year 1876, where he was called to establish an academy in the name of the church. The academy he established was known as the Brigham Young Academy, now Brigham Young University. Karl G. Maeser served as director, principal, and instructor of the academy. Heber J. Grant, a president of the LDS church stated, \\"Some of our outstanding men... attribute largely to the force of character of Brother Maeser and the impression made upon them while under his influence their successes in life.\\"National Park Service p. 3  History  The present site of Provo was settled by members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in 1849 when Fort Utah was built near the Provo River. The Mormons, fleeing from persecution in Nauvoo, Illinois, headed west under the direction of Brigham Young and established themselves in the Great Salt Lake area in Utah. Provo was the first settlement in Utah Valley and was part of a plan to establish a chain of communities extending from Salt Lake City. The Mormon communities were planned according to a grid system set forth by their leaders. The first schools in Provo were sometimes held in public buildings and private residences. In the year 1851, the Provo City council gained power to establish, support and regulate common schools, and in 1853 property taxes were approved for building schools. Before the 1870s in Provo, school buildings were small adobe structures. Then in 1875 one united school district was formed and an era of better buildings and schools began. In 1898 the Board of Education approved plans for the construction of Maeser Elementary. The school was dedicated November 9, 1898 with Karl G. Maeser as guest of honor. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998, with note that it was then the oldest public school in Provo that was still in use, and that it \\"is one of the best-preserved examples of the work of Utah architect Richard Watkins\\". and  Today  Maeser School's enrollment dwindled until the decision was made in 2001 to close its doors. The 6th grade class of 2002 was the final graduating class from Maeser School. The future of the historic Maeser School has become what Mayor Lewis K.

Apple events describe \\"high-level\\" events such as \\"open document\\" or \\"print file\\", whereas earlier OSs had supported much more basic events, namely \\"click\\" and \\"keypress\\". Apple events form the basis of the Mac OS scripting system, the Open Scripting Architecture (the primary language of such being AppleScript). The starting point is a dynamically-typed, extensible descriptor format called an AEDesc, which is just an OSType code specifying the data type, together with a block of type- dependent data. For instance, the OSType code \`inte\` indicates that the data was a four-byte signed integer in big-endian format. Besides predefined type codes for various common simple types, there are two predefined structured descriptor types: an AERecord, which has data type \`reco\` (record), and AEList with type \`list\` (list or array). The internal structure of these contain recursively-nested AEDescs, while the AERecord also associates each element with a unique record field ID, which is an OSType. The Apple Event Manager provides API calls to construct these structures, as well as extract their contents and query the type of contents they hold. The Apple Event Manager also supports coercions, which converts AEDescs from one data type to another. In addition to standard coercions, for instance between integer and real types, applications can install their own coercion handler callbacks, which handle conversions to and from custom data types. An Apple event proper is an AERecord with fields that depended on the purpose of the event. In addition, it has attributes (which are distinct from record fields, which are now called the parameters of the event) from a set predefined by the Apple Event Manager. These specify what the event is supposed to do (through event class and event ID), the target address to which the event is to be sent (which could be a process on the local or a remote machine), and various other options for handling it. Remote machines initially had to be connected via AppleTalk, but Mac OS 9 added the option for connections via TCP/IP. After sending an Apple event to its target process, the sending process can elect to receive a reply Apple event. This can contain various bits of information returned from the target about the processing of the original event, including an error code indicating success/failure, any information requested by the original event, and/or other appropriate information. Apple events are the foundation of the AppleEvent Object Model, which in turn is the foundation of the OSA and AppleScript. , the official implementation of the Apple Event Manager API is available in C and its descendants, including C++. Official bindings are also provided for Objective-C and Swift through the Cocoa API. Unofficial bindings also exist for other languages (with varying degrees of limitation), including Perl, UserTalk, Ruby and Python. Object Model The AppleEvent Object Model (AEOM) was a set of protocols built on top of AppleEvents by which applications running under classic Mac OS and macOS could control each other's functions. Applications that implemented some part of the AEOM were called scriptable because they could be controlled via AppleScript. Unfortunately, scriptability support remained patchy and inconsistent throughout the history of classic Mac OS. The AEOM provided a syntactic layer under which any application could publish its internal objects, allowing those objects to be manipulated in a standardized way. Unlike other similar-sounding concepts such as ToolTalk, there was a clear, orthogonal distinction between nouns and verbs; thus, instead of providing separate commands for \\"close document\\" and \\"close window\\", there was a single \\"close\\" verb which could take references to \\"document\\" or \\"window\\" objects, or any other object that the application published. The objects that an application made available through its AEOM support were arranged in a hierarchy. At the top was the application itself, referenced via a null object descriptor. Other objects were referenced by (recursively) specifying their parent object, together with other information identifying it as a child of that parent, all collected in an AERecord. An iterator was provided by parents to enumerate their children, or children of a certain class, allowing applications to address a set of elements. The system was generally similar to the Document Object Model used in XML, although with some differences in access patterns. Each object could have elements and properties; elements were other objects, which might be created or deleted, while properties could not be created or deleted but had values which might be interrogated or changed. For instance, the application might have one or more window elements representing windows showing the contents of currently-open documents. These windows might have properties such as their title, position and size. An application could define custom verbs for operating on its objects. The AEOM also specified various standard verbs which (it was hoped) applications would implement in a consistent fashion, such as open, close, create element, delete, set data, and get data. Each verb was defined as an AppleEvent of a specific type and class, together with particular parameters of particular types that were expected to be present. For instance, the \\"get data\\" event was the standard means for obtaining the value of a property: it took essentially one parameter, which was an object descriptor identifying the property to be queried. The value of that property would be returned in the reply event. The \\"set data\\" event took two parameters, the object descriptor for the property to set and the new value for the property; the reply event was only expected to return a success status or failure error code. The entire AppleEvent architecture identifies things using four-byte OSType codes, studiously avoiding actual words or phrases in English (or any other language). Instead, the correspondence between internal AppleEvent codes and external natural-language descriptions is specified through the aete (AppleEvent Terminology Extension) resource -- the \\"extension\\" being to the standard terminology built into AppleScript itself. An application may provide multiple 'aete' resources for multiple languages, in keeping with the original multilingual design of AppleScript itself For instance, consider the following AppleScript sequence controlling a fictional drawing application: tell application \\"ScriptableDraw\\" set background color of window \\"New Drawing\\" to background color of window \\"Old Drawing\\" end tell This actually involves the sending of two AppleEvents to the target application (and the receipt of their corresponding replies): first, a get-data event is sent to retrieve the background color property of the window identified by the name \\"Old Drawing\\"; then a set-data event is sent to apply the value returned as the background color property of the window named \\"New Drawing\\". Since this sort of access pattern was typical, AppleScript made widespread use of the \`tell\` statement, which switched the context to the named object in a fashion similar to the \`with\` statement found in Visual Basic or Pascal. All commands after the \`tell\` to the corresponding \`end tell\` would be sent to the object named in the \`tell\`, instead of the default object, which was the current application. Object descriptors allowed the identification of objects in various ways. The most interesting one was using a where-clause (which translated into AppleScript terminology as a filter expression). For instance, the AppleScript 1.0 SDK shipped with the source code for an example application called the Scriptable Text Editor, which would respond to scripts such as: tell application \\"Scriptable Text Editor\\" tell window \\"Example Document\\" set text style of every word whose length > 7 to bold end tell end tell Even today, it is rare to find this kind of power in general-purpose scripting languages outside of SQL. Adding support for the AEOM in the classic Mac OS was a difficult process. Application developers had to identify their objects and hand-write code to allow them to be addressed. This typically took the form of code for returning the \\"next\\" object of a particular type, allowing AppleScript to iterate over them. But since the OS did not contain an object model, this work was left entirely to the developers, many of whom did not implement it. Oddly, even Apple's own application framework, MacApp, did not offer such a model except for the GUI objects it knew about, once again making the developer do most of the work of scripting the objects representing the data itself. Largely for these reasons, AppleScript support was not very widespread. Apple did attempt to address this problem with the introduction of various object \\"suites\\", which represented standard objects and verbs that were expected to be supported by different types of applications. For instance, all applications were expected to support the \\"core suite\\", and any application editing text was expected to support the \\"text suite\\". By selecting a suitable set of suites, the developer could at least reduce the workload of planning how to expose their objects. Yet because these objects were generally not part of the system itself (with the exception of the severely limited TextEdit editor), the actual implementation was left to the developer. Applications developed in Cocoa, the system formerly known as OpenStep, offer a rich object runtime that can be queried from any other application. This makes implementation of the AEOM considerably easier, dramatically reducing the amount of code needed in the average application. Additionally the majority of Cocoa applications are constructed primarily from Cocoa-standard objects, all of which were upgraded to offer fairly extensive scriptability. This extends not only to GUI objects as under MacApp, but also to data objects inside them, including text, tables and various list objects. A text file is used to map the internal \\"object-like\\" names onto human- readable versions, and in most cases creating this is all that is needed to add fairly substantial scriptability to most programs. While Cocoa applications are not AEOM based, and often use subtly different objects than Apple's originally defined standard objects, Cocoa apps are generally much more scriptable than their \\"classic\\" counterparts‚Äîin fact, it is uncommon to find a Cocoa application that is not scriptable to some degree.

Dugouts can be fully recessed into the earth, with a flat roof covered by ground, or dug into a hillside. They can also be semi-recessed, with a constructed wood or sod roof standing out. These structures are one of the most ancient types of human housing known to archaeologists, and the same methods have evolved into modern \\"earth shelter\\" technology. Dugouts may also be temporary shelters constructed as an aid to specific activities, e.g., concealment and protection during warfare or shelter while hunting.

Asia and the Pacific =Australia= An Indigenous Australian dugout near Cunnamulla, Queensland around 1910 Burra in South Australia's Mid-North region was the site of the famous 'Monster Mine' (copper) and home to 4,400 people in 1851, 1,800 of whom were living in dugouts in the Burra Creek. Census data from 1851 shows that nearly 80 percent of the workers living in the dugouts were miners, with probably the majority being Cornish. Floods and the Victorian gold rush effectively ended the large scale use of dugouts in Burra, but people were still being 'washed' out of the creek in 1859.Auhl, I. 1986.

Coober Pedy is a small outback town in northern South Australia, 846 kilometres north of Adelaide on the Stuart Highway, where opal mining is the dominant industry. Most residents live in caves excavated into the hillsides to avoid the harsh summer temperatures and work underground in mine shafts. White Cliffs, New South Wales is similar, in terms of climate, housing, and mining operations. =China= In north China, especially on the Loess Plateau, caves called yaodongs dug into hillsides have been the traditional dwellings from early times. The advantage of a yaodong over an ordinary house is that it needs little heating in winter and no cooling in summer. An estimated 40 million people in northern China live in a yaodong. Many people live in semi-recessed dugout houses in north-western China where hot summer and cold winters prevail.Chinese Earth Shelter Dwellings: By Paul Long. =Japan= Yoshinogari site In the Early J≈çmon period of Japanese pre-history (10,000 to 300 BC) complex pit houses were the most commonly used method of housing.^ Early Jomon hamlet found Retrieved January 2007 Middle East =Israel= During the Bar Kokhba Revolt, Jews used an intricate system of man-made hideout complexes, prepared well in advance of the onset of the revolt.

They are now archeological and tourist sites, but are not generally occupied (see Kaymaklƒ± Underground City). The latest large Turkish underground city was discovered in 2007 in Gaziemir, G√ºzelyurt. This city was a stopover on the Silk Road, allowing travelers and their camels to rest in safety, underground, in a 'fortress' hotel equivalent to a modern hotel. Europe The \\"Sassi di Matera\\" A \\"plaggenhut\\" in the Netherlands in Themepark de Spitkeet, Harkema =Crimea= The well-preserved cave towns of Crimea are Mangup-Kale, Eski- Kermen, Inkerman and Chufut-Kale. The settlement of Mangup-Kale dates back to the 3rd century AD and was fortified by Justinian I in the mid 6th century. It was inhabited and governed primarily by Crimean Goths, and became the center of their autonomous principality. The last inhabitants, a small community of Karaims, abandoned the site in the 1790s. =Iceland= In Iceland, since time immemorial and well into the 20th century, most houses were partly dug down, with turf or sod walls built up and roofs made of timber and turf/sod. Turf was used because timber was scarce and expensive, and stone not practical before the advent of concrete. =Italy= Matera has gained international fame for its ancient town, the \\"Sassi di Matera\\" (meaning \\"stones of Matera\\"), which is UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1993. The Sassi are houses dug into the volcanic rock itself, known locally as \\"Tufo\\", which is characteristic of Basilicata and Apulia. =Netherlands= In the Netherlands the dugout () was banned by the housing safety law of 1901. In some areas in the east the country, people lived in dugouts into the 1960s. Dutch dugouts are constructed around an excavated pit with a roof made from heather sod, and front and back walls made from slabs of peat. Peat diggers and their families lived in these, in life-shortening conditions of poverty, damp and insect infestation. A small number of these huts survive, and can be seen in the open air museums of Arnhem, Schoonoord, Barger-Compascuum and Harkema. Modernized dugouts are available as tourist accommodation in several locations. =Poland (Mazovia)= Dugouts called ziemianka were used as stores for food. =Scotland= In ancient Scotland, earth houses, also known as yird, Weems and Picts' houses, were underground dwellings, extant even after the Roman evacuation of Britain. Entry was effected by a passage not much wider than a fox burrow, which sloped downwards 10 or 12 ft. to the floor of the house; the inside was oval in shape, and was walled with overlapping rough stone slabs; the roof frequently reached to within a foot of the Earth's surface; they probably served as storehouses, winter quarters, and as places of refuge in times of war. Similar dwellings are found in Ireland. =Serbia= In Serbia they are called zemunica. Also, the town of Zemun derived its name from Zemln, which is akin to zemunica. =Spain= The most famous feature of the town of Guadix is the cave dwellings in the Barrio. =World War I= thumb|leftZonnebeke church dugout constructed by 171st Tunnelling Company in 1918 (model) Gallipoli, 1915 Steps leading down to a German deep dugout at Bernafay Wood, near Montauban, used in the Battle of the Somme, 1916 Dugouts were used extensively as protection from shelling during World War I in the Western Front. They were an important part of the trench warfare as they were used as an area to rest and carry out other activities such as eating. They would usually range in size from dugouts that could hold several men to dugouts that could hold thousands of soldiers. Some sophisticated dugouts, such as the Vampire dugout, were placed more than underground, lined with concrete, wood and steel to withstand the shock of artillery, accessed via a set of wooden stairs. About 180 dugout sites have been located in the Ypres Salient and in the 1990s some of them were entered, at least in part.Activities of The Diggers - Restoration of the Yorkshire Trench & Dug- out, access date 10 July 2015 The level of activity can be gauged by the fact that during 1917 and 1918, more people lived underground in the Ypres area than reside in the town today. =World War II zemlyankas= Zemlyanka used by partisans near N√Ωrov, Czech Republic, preserved as a WWII memorial In World War II, partisans, or armed resistance fighters in Eastern Europe sometimes lived in dugouts called zemlyankas (Russian or ) which were used as underground bunkers to provide shelter and a hiding place from enemies.Virtual Zemlyanka Jewish Partisan Educational Foundation In Poland they were called ziemianki. North America Many of the ancient peoples of the American continents built semi-permanent houses of poles and brush plastered with mud over a shallow pit in the earth. As these pithouses were very similar to those first built in northeastern Europe 25,000 years ago, pithouse technology may have been carried to the Americas by early nomadic settlers, traveling first through Siberia, and then across the ice bridge between Asia and North America about 12,000 to 14,000 years ago. An individual pithouse was occupied for an average of about 15 years. By more modern standards, these dwellings were cramped and dark. The centralized hearth created a smoky, cold environment during the winter. Most pithouses are associated with an open air plaza or rooftop where inhabitants carried out most of their daily activities during good weather. In areas suitable for intensive agriculture, groups of pithouses clustered to create communities of varying sizes. =British Columbia and American Northwest= In the Interior Plateau of the British Columbia and in the Columbia Plateau of the Pacific Northwest the remains of a form of pit- house called a quiggly hole or kekuli are common, and come in large groups named quiggly towns, which are correspondingly the remains of ancient villages. =Canadian Prairies= The Doukhobor Dugout House in Blaine Lake, Saskatchewan was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 2008. Although today it is the only known partially surviving example of this type of shelter, it was one of many such dugout houses constructed by Doukhobors upon arrival in Canada, and a form of shelter used by many settlers of various ethnicities upon their arrival on the prairies. =American Southwest= Pithouses were very common structures in the American Southwest during the early and middle periods of the Anasazi, Mogollon and Hohokam cultures, and were also found in cultures extending north and west of the Colorado plateau. The emergence of the pithouse marks the transition between a nomadic hunting- and-gathering livelihood and a settled agricultural way of life which also relied on wild plants and animals for food. Pithouse structures were probably the forerunners of the kivas built later in the Pueblo periods, and share many characteristics with them. Although the architectural styles used by these people evolved throughout their history, the pithouse remained a basic residential structure. Pithouses are found in isolated rural settings, in conjunction with above ground dwellings and adjacent to the large multi-room cliff dwellings characteristic of the region. Historian Linda Cordell notes that ...the late pithouses are often clues to relatively short-term changes in settlement location and adjustment to climatic fluctuations. (Cordell, p. 164) This appears to be true among the modern Pueblo peoples as well. When the Hopi village of Bacavi was founded in 1909, some groups of people arrived in the late autumn. As there was a limited window of time for building, the new arrivals built pithouses as warm shelters for the winter. Some of these homes remained occupied until the 1970s. Pithouses were built by excavating a well defined hole into the ground, usually around 6\\" to 18\\" deep but occasionally as deep as four to five feet, and creating walls and roof using a pole and adobe technology. The sunken floor of the dwelling is below the frost line and helps moderate both winter and summer temperatures, with the mass of the ground serving as an insulator. In addition, adobe walls gather heat during the day and release it when temperatures drop. The earliest pithouses were round, and varied in size between nine and twenty-five feet in diameter. Around 700, pithouse designs became more individualized. Excavations reveal examples based on squares, rectangles and shapes similar to the letter D. A reconstruction shows the pit dug below ground, four supporting posts, roof structure as a layers of wood and mud, and entry through the roof; Step House ruins at Mesa Verde National Park. These homes were also warmed by a centralized hearth, a fire pit with an air deflector, and side vents and a smoke hole in the roof provided fresh air and evacuated smoke. The placement of the home's entrance varied by locality and archaeological period. Early homes utilized the ventilation stack as an egress by means of a ladder. Later homes expanded the pit into a keyhole shape to create a low sheltered entrance. Interior space was often loosely divided into two rooms, one for storing personal and dry goods and the other as living quarters. Many pithouses included an antechamber, containing storage bins or pits. Pithouse construction was usually based on four corner posts positioned upright in the pit. These posts were carefully chosen and trimmed to create a branch or fork at the top as a structural support. They were joined by horizontal beams and crossed with ceiling joists. The interior sides of the pit were plastered with clay or lined with stone ‚Äî either large slabs wedged upright in the soil or courses of smaller stones. The exterior of the pithouse was formed of branches, packed tree bark, or brush and grass. A thick layer of mud on the outside of the roof and walls protected the shelter from the weather. Often the initial mud layer was carefully plastered with a lighter colored clay. A large number of pithouses have been archaeologically excavated throughout the American Southwest. Reproductions of these basic family structures exist in museums and tourist information sites, such as the structure at the Manitou Cliff Dwellings. National and state parks and monuments showcase pithouse ruins and may include authentic reconstructions such as the Ancient Pueblo structure at Step House ruin, Mesa Verde National Park, Fremont Indian State Park in Utah, and a Hohokam structure at the Hardy Site in Tucson, Arizona. =Sod houses= During the American Civil War, the federal United States government passed the Homestead Act offering free land for those who could \\"prove up\\" their claims by living on the land and farming it for a prescribed number of years. Settlers on the newly opened Great Plains found there were not enough trees to build familiar log cabins. As shelter was essential, the frontier farmer utilized ribbons of the thick prairie sod cut as they plowed their virgin land. The strip could be cut into two foot sections, four to six inches deep, to make an almost perfect building block with good insulating properties. These first homes, often called soddies, were small rooms dug into the side of a low rolling hill. The walls were built up with sod blocks to a height of seven or eight feet. Holes were left for purchased doors and windows hauled from the nearest town or railhead. Cottonwood poles were laid side by side to form a support for a roof made of a thick layer of coarse prairie grass. Over this was carefully fitted a double layer of the sod building blocks. Rain helped the sod to grow and soon the dugout roof was covered with waving grass. Some frontier families found that their cows grazed on their roof, and occasionally had them fall through.Chapter 2: Frontier Homes The floor of the dugout home was of dirt or rough wooden planks. Walls were lined with newspapers pasted or pinned up with small, sharpened sticks to keep dirt from flaking into the home's interior. Some families used fabric on their walls while others created a plaster coating from local limestone and sand. Some were carpeted and other variations included building on a second room for school teachers or guests. Heating could be provided by burning buffalo chips or cow chips.Pioneer Dugout - Texas Historical Marker. The home's comfort and structural stability were maximized when the structure was located on the south side of a low hill, with adequate drainage to provide run-off for rain and melting snow. Most pioneer dugouts had a short lifespan, being replaced by plank or rock homes when farmers had time and money to create larger, more traditional homes. When a family built a house of logs or boards, their domestic animals often continued to be sheltered in a sod dugout. =Burdeis= In frontier Canada and the United States, dugout style shelters were also used by pioneers and settlers from Europe. In these cases, the shelter's construction closely reflected the architecture of the various settlers' origins. They ranged from the French-Canadian‚Äìstyle sod houses called caveauxLes communaut√©s francophones et leur histoire>> Centre Nord>> Legal to the burdeis built by Ukrainian immigrants. The burdei was intended as a temporary refuge until a \\"proper\\" home of poplar logs and mud/straw plaster could be built. Mennonites from Imperial Russia also built burdeis as temporary shelters when they settled in the Hillsboro region of Kansas.\\"A Short History of the Mennonite Immigration to Kansas\\" at the Hillsboro museum web site See also Parent categories: *Subterranea (geography): underground structures *Underground city, umbrella article for underground dwellings and facilities *Rock-cut architecture *Underground living Types of dugouts and other related topics: *Earth house *Earth lodge *Earth sheltering *Hut *Pit- house *Skara Brae an important earth sheltered Neolithic settlement in Scotland *Sod house *Secret passage **Tunnels in popular culture Notes References * Cordell, Linda S.

They are childhood friends of Hamlet, summoned by King Claudius to distract the prince from his apparent madness and if possible to ascertain the cause of it. The characters were revived in W. S. Gilbert's satire, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, and as the alienated heroes of Tom Stoppard's absurdist play, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, which was adapted into a film. Rosencrantz (\\"rose wreath\\") and Gyldenstjerne/Gyllenstierna (\\"golden star\\") were names of Danish (and Norwegian, and Swedish) noble families of the 16th century; records of the Danish royal coronation of 1596 show that one tenth of the aristocrats participating bore one or the other name. James Voelkel suggests that the characters were named after Frederik Rosenkrantz and Knud Gyldenstierne, cousins of Tycho Brahe who had visited England in 1592. Shakespeare's Hamlet The majority of characters in Hamlet have classical names, in contrast to the \\"particularly Danish\\" ones of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. The names were common in the court of Frederick II and Christian IV, and also at the University of Wittenberg, an institution where Hamlet is mentioned as having studied (he refers to them as \\"my two schoolfellows\\"). In Hamlet, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern first appear in Act II, Scene 2, where they attempt to place themselves in the confidence of Prince Hamlet, their childhood friend. The smooth and courtly language they employ immediately establishes them as sycophants who are really serving as spies for the corrupt King Claudius, Hamlet's uncle, who usurped the throne and constantly attempts to check his nephew. Hamlet welcomes them as \\"excellent good friends\\", but, seeing through their guise, comments that they won't \\"deal justly\\" with him about their mission. Realising that he lacks allies except for Horatio, Hamlet gives the speech \\"What a piece of work is a man\\" to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. In Act III, Hamlet seems to drop the pretense of friendship, coldly dismissing the two in Scene 2. Line 319 is perhaps his only use of the royal \\"we\\" in the play, although he may also be addressing the other person present on the stage, Horatio, with whom Hamlet first saw the ghost they are discussing. To his mother, he comments in Scene 4 that \\"I will trust [them] as I will adders fang'd.\\" When Hamlet kills Polonius, Claudius recruits Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to escort Hamlet to England, providing them with a letter for the King of England instructing him to have Hamlet killed. (They are apparently unaware of what is in the letter, though Shakespeare never explicitly says so.) Along the journey, the distrustful Hamlet finds and rewrites the letter, instructing the executioner to kill Rosencrantz and Guildenstern instead. When their ship is attacked by pirates, Hamlet returns to Denmark, leaving Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to die; he comments in Act V, Scene 2 that \\"They are not near my conscience; their defeat / Does by their own insinuation grow.\\" Ambassadors returning later report that \\"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.\\" As agents of the corruption infecting the court, the two contribute to setting up the confrontation between Hamlet and Claudius. Shakespeare expects the audience to appreciate the poetic justice of their deaths: while they are very likely ignorant of the deadly contents of the letter they carry to England and are, to that extent, innocent victims of Hamlet's retaliation, they are seen as having received their just deserts for their participation in Claudius's intrigues. The courtiers always appear as a pair, except in editions following the First Folio text, where Guildenstern enters four lines after Rosencrantz in Act IV, Scene 3. Gilbert's Rosencrantz and Guildenstern W. S. Gilbert's play (1874) is a comedy in which Rosencrantz plots with his friend Guildenstern to get rid of Hamlet, so that Rosencrantz can marry Ophelia. They discover that Claudius has written a play. The king's literary work is so embarrassingly bad that Claudius has decreed that anyone who mentions it must be executed. They obtain the manuscript and convince Hamlet to perform it. When he does, Claudius decrees that he must die, but is eventually persuaded to banish him to England. Rosencrantz and Ophelia can now be together. Stoppard's Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead As the protagonists of Tom Stoppard's play and film, they are confused by the events of Hamlet and seem unaware of their role in the larger drama. The play is primarily a comedy, but they often stumble upon deep philosophical truths through their nonsensical ramblings. In the movie, Rosencrantz invents the sandwich, and discovers gravity and volume displacement, among other things. The characters depart from their epiphanies as quickly as they come to them. At times, one appears more enlightened than the other‚Äîbut they trade this enlightenment back and forth throughout the drama. Stoppard also littered his play with jokes that refer to the common thespian tendency to swap Rosencrantz and Guildenstern in the midst of the play because the characters are basically identical. He does this by making Rosencrantz and Guildenstern unsure of who is who, as well as having the other players (Claudius, Hamlet, Gertrude) refer to them frequently by the wrong names. Because of the play's similarity to Waiting for Godot, Rosencrantz is sometimes compared to Estragon (one of the tramps who wait for Godot), and who shares his dim perception of reality, while Guildenstern parallels Vladimir, who shares his analytical perception.

The event has been variously described as a \\"riot\\" or a \\"massacre\\". It arose from escalating tensions between Shia Iran and Sunni Saudi Arabia. Since 1981, Iranian pilgrims had held an annual political demonstration against Israel and the United States, but in 1987, a cordon of Saudi police and the Saudi Arabian National Guard had sealed part of the planned anti-Western demonstration route, leading to a confrontation between them and the pilgrims. This escalated into a violent clash, followed by a deadly stampede. According to some beliefs, the conflict depended less on the religious centrality of the site and more on political choreography. There is a controversy regarding the details of the incident, with both Iran and Saudi Arabia laying much of the blame on the other side. Official Saudi reports hold that 402 people died in the incident including 275 Iranian pilgrims, 85 Saudi police and 42 pilgrims from other countries. On the other hand, Iran reported the death of 400 Iranian pilgrims and the injury of several thousands. According to The New York Times, more than 400 pilgrims had died, and thousands more injured. After the incident, Iranians attacked the Saudi, Kuwaiti and French Embassies, abducting four Saudis from the embassy. Background For years, Iranian pilgrims had tried to stage demonstrations called \\"Distancing Ourselves from Mushrikƒ´n\\" (ÿ®ÿ±ÿßÿ¶ÿ™ ÿßÿ≤ ŸÖÿ¥ÿ±⁄©ŸäŸÜ) in the Muslim holy city of Mecca during the hajj. \\"Anti shah, anti-Israel and anti-American propaganda during the Hajj\\" had been begun to spread by followers of Khomeini since around 1971. These demonstrations had their origins in 1971, when Ruhollah Khomeini instructed his Shiite followers to distribute political messages when performing their pilgrimage. Even though a few Iranians were arrested for this act, the Saudi officials were generally apathetic, as they did not view these political messages to be a threat to the Saudi royalty. After the revolution, Iran claimed that \\"the Hajj and the Holy places should be placed under international oversight as opposed to being managed by the Saudis alone.\\" So the tension between Iran and Saudi based on the hajj was started in the 1980s. These disturbances were reacted to by the Saudi government with anger because \\"the Hajj is an important legitimizing factor for the Saudi ruling family\\". The first large strike between Shia pilgrims and Saudi security forces occurred in 1981. In 1981, this was escalated into openly chanting political slogans in the Masjid al-Haram and the Prophet's Mosque, two of the holiest sites in Islam, resulting in violent clashes with Saudi security and one death. In the same year, King Khalid of Saudi Arabia wrote a letter to Saddam Hussein saying \\"crush these stupid Iranians\\" as Saddam pushed on with the invasion of Iranian territory. Before the demonstrations started, Khomeini instructed the Iranian pilgrims to maintain peace and remain civil during the pilgrimage.From Beirut to Jerusalem Thomas L. Friedman ‚Äì 1990 ‚Äì 541 pages ‚Äì Snippet view In the following years, both sides tried to calm the situation: Khomeini urged his followers to maintain peace and order, not to distribute printed political material, and not to criticize Muslim governments. In return, Saudi officials reversed their earlier position and allowed two separate demonstrations to take place: One in Mecca, and the other in Medina. By 1986, the situation was calm enough for Saudi officials to re-open the sealed al-Baqi' cemetery for Shiite pilgrims, and in response, Khomeini's representative formally thanked the Saudi King for the gesture. However, in the same year, Iranian radical Mehdi Hashemi was accused of smuggling explosives on an airplane headed for Saudi Arabia, renewing Saudi fears. Demonstrations According to the speech early in July 1987, Khoiniha said that \\"a mere march or demonstration by Iranians would not suffice. He demanded that the Saudi regime allow Iranian pilgrims to enter the Great Mosque in Mecca at the end of their demonstration where their representative would explain Iran‚Äôs case regarding the Iran Iraq war. \\" As a result of strict dialogues, it was allowed that \\"the demonstration would end half a kilometer before the great Mosque\\", but the decision \\"put the Saudi security forces on a high state of alert\\". On Friday 31 July 1987, the demonstration started amid heightened security after Friday's midday prayers, while Iranian pilgrims chanted \\"Death to America! Death to the Soviet Union! Death to Israel!\\". The march was uneventful until towards the end of the planned route, where the demonstrators found their way blocked by Saudi riot police and National Guardsmen. At this point, some of the Iranians began to call for the demonstrations to press ahead and continue to the Great Mosque. While this was happening, unidentified persons began harassing the Iranian pilgrims by throwing bricks and other objects at them from a nearby location. These factors exacerbated the situation, escalating it into a violent clash between the Iranian pilgrims and Saudi security, with the Saudis reportedly using truncheons and electric prods and the Iranians using knives and clubs. The details are controversial.Saudi security personnel reportedly opened fire on the demonstrators, a charge which Saudi officials deny. Iranian officials maintain that the Saudis had fired on the protesters without provocation, and that the demonstrations had been peaceful. Saudi officials insist that no shots were fired, and that all deaths were caused by the melee and stampede. In a Washington news conference, the Saudi ambassador Prince Bandar bin Sultan claimed that \\"not one bullet was fired\\", blaming the violence on the Iranian pilgrims who he accused of \\"brandishing knives, clubs and broken glass drawn from beneath their cloaks\\". Robin Wright also reports that \\"Many of the Iranian bodies, shown to American and European reporters immediately upon their return to Tehran, had bullet punctures.\\"In the Name of God: The Khomeini Decade by Robin Wright, p166 Ami Ayalon, an Israeli politician, wrote that \\"most of the Iranian pilgrims apparently shot by Saudi security authorities during the demonstration. =Casualties= The rioting and the resulting stampede caused a reported 402 dead (275 Iranians, 85 Saudis including policemen, and 42 pilgrims from other countries) and 649 wounded (303 Iranians, 145 Saudis and 201 other nationals).K.

Aftermath Memorial and Tombs of Victims in Tehran's Behesht-e Zahra Further adding to the tensions were the demands made by Mohammad Mousavi Khoeiniha in 1987 to allow the Iranian pilgrims to hold their demonstrations within the Great Mosque itself, and without the presence of security guards. Khoeiniha had been earlier appointed as the supervisor and personal representative of Ayatollah Khomeini for Hajj affairs, but had been expelled from Saudi Arabia in 1982. Even though Mehdi Karrubi, who was Khomeini's official pilgrimage representative that year, tried to assure Saudi officials that the demonstrations would take place in the usual manner and in the agreed routes, it did little to quell the Saudi fears. After the incident 1987, the Hajj for three years between 1988 and 1990 was banned by Iran, Although \\"diplomatic ties were restored in 1991\\". On 1 August 1987, a spontaneous demonstration by enraged Iranians ended with attacks on the Kuwaiti and Saudi embassies in Tehran.\\"A spontaneous demonstration in Tehran on 1 August ended in attacks on the Saudi and Kuwaiti embassies.\\" The longest war: the Iran-Iraq military conflict, page 225 On the same day, the Iranian leader Khomeini called on Saudis to overthrow the House of Saud to avenge the pilgrims' deaths.\\"Khomeini called for the overthrow of the Saudi royal family to avenge the pilgrims' deaths\\" Saudi Arabia A Country Study, page 271 Both sides took additional measures to bolster their view on the issue. Saudi Arabia severed ties with Iran and reduced the number of permitted Iranian pilgrims to 45,000, down from 150,000 in earlier years. Iran boycotted the Hajj for three years, from 1988 to 1990. In 1991, Iran and Saudi Arabia renewed diplomatic relations after coming to an agreement to allow Iranian pilgrims to perform the Hajj once more. The total number of pilgrims was set at 115,000, and the demonstrations were allowed to be held, but only in one specific location granted by the Saudis. Under this agreement, Iranian pilgrims continued their annual demonstration in the 1990s and 2000s with few or no incidents. They limited their rally to within the confines of their compound in Mecca. Approximately 20,000 Pakistani troops stationed in Saudi Arabia were sent back to Pakistan, as Saudi Arabia was uncomfortable with the presence of Shi'ite soldiers. Reaction Ali Khamenei said following the incident that \\"They are now propagandizing and claiming that this incident was a war between Shia and Sunni. This is a lie! Of course, there is a war, but a war between the American perception of Islam and true revolutionary Islam.\\" Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri asked Muslim religious leaders to \\"wrest control of Islam's holy sites in Saudi Arabia from the royal family.\\" As the ruling Revolutionary Command Council, ostensibly an organ of the secular Baath Arab socialist movement in Iraq demanded, visiting Islam's holy sites by Iranians should be banned.

The students protested with a \\"dispersion\\", or student strike, which lasted more than two years and led to a number of reforms of the medieval university. The event demonstrates the town and gown power struggles with the Church, secular leaders and the emerging student class and a lessening of local Church authority over the University of Paris. The university was placed squarely under direct papal patronage, part of the program to centralise the Church structure, which had intensified under Innocent III. Background The University of Paris was one of the first universities in Europe and then considered the most prestigious of the time because of its focus on theology. It had been founded in the mid-12th century and received its official charter from the Church in 1200.Rubenstein, Richard E.: Aristotle's Children, page 161. Harvest Books, 2004. It was run by the Church, and students were considered part of the Church and so wore robes and shaved the tops of their heads in tonsure to signify they were under its protection. Students operated according to the rules and laws of the Church and were not subject to the king's laws or courts. That caused ongoing problems of students abusing the laws of the city, which had no direct recourse for justice and so had to appeal to ecclesiastical courts. Students were often very young, entering the school at 13 or 14 and staying for 6 to 12 years. They came from many regions and spoke many European languages, with all defined by their native language. Latin was the lingua franca at school. Eventually, the Masters were organized into four \\"nations\\" comprising the French, the Picards, Normans and a polyglot of nationalities (predominantly English, German, Scandinavian and otherwise Central European) referred to as \\"English\\". The overwhelming majority of students were from the elite or aristocratic classes of Europe, as the cost of travel and maintenance of a stay at the university, as well as basic tuition, was beyond the reach of the poor. Riot In March 1229, on Shrove Tuesday, Paris's pre-Lenten carnival was coming to its conclusion, similar to the modern-day Mardi Gras, when one wore masks and generally let loose. The students often drank heavily and were rowdy, and in the suburban quarter of Saint Marcel, a dispute broke out between a band of students and a tavern proprietor over a bill, which led to a physical fight. The students were beaten up and thrown into the streets. The next day, Ash Wednesday, the aggrieved students returned in larger numbers armed with wooden clubs; broke into the tavern, which was closed on account of the penitential holiday, beat the taverner and destroyed the establishment. Other shops were damaged in a subsequent riot, which spilled into the streets. Because students had benefit of clergy, which exempted them from the jurisdiction of the king's courts, angry complaints were filed with the ecclesiastical (Church) courts. The ecclesiastical courts knew that the university tended to be very protective of its students, and fearing a split like that of Cambridge University from Oxford, they were trying to approach the matter carefully. However, Blanche of Castile, regent of France during the minority of Louis IX, stepped in and demanded retribution. The university allowed the city guard to punish the student rioters. The city guardsmen, known for their rough nature, found a group of students and, with an unexpectedly heavy hand, killed several of them. The dead students were later rumored to be innocent of the actual riot. Strike The response from the university was an immediate strike. Classes were closed, and striking students went to other universities such as Reims, Oxford or Toulouse, returned home or found employment elsewhere. Faculty ceased to teach. An economic strain was placed upon the student quarter of Paris, the Latin Quarter, where Latin was commonly heard in the streets, and the university was a major component in the economy. Resolution After two years of negotiations, Pope Gregory IX, an alumnus of the University of Paris, issued, on April 13, 1231, the bull Parens scientiarum, honouring the university as the \\"Mother of Sciences\\", which later was called the Magna Carta of the University of Paris because it guaranteed the school independence from local authority, both ecclesiastical and secular, by placing it directly under papal patronage. The threat of suspension of lectures remained an economic lever: masters were authorized to \\"disperse\\" the lectures over a wide range of provocations, which ranged from \\"monstrous injury or offense\\" to \\"the right to assess the rents of lodgings\\".

The music of Tokelau occurs in the atolls of Atafu, Nukunonu, and Fakaofo. It is dominated by communal choral activity in harmony, with percussive accompaniment including log drums (pate), pokihi (wooden box) and apa (biscuit tin). Nukunonu is notable for traditional song and dance. History Nukunonu is one of the three islands of Tokelau (the other two are Atafu and Fakaofo) where, under the positive influence of the Catholic Christian missionaries, traditional music and song took positive development . Though the music and dance form was imported from Tuvalu, it was adopted into the ‚Äúacculturated fatele‚Äù which has replaced the old forms. Drums were a common accompaniment in music for quite a long time. Slit gongs was also another instrument in use since 1841 that was noticed by the United States Exploring Expedition in 1843. Pokihi (mat covered boxes) is another widely seen instrument used in fatele music, which was a post European innovation seen even in 1921. Alan Thomas was the first person to study the music of Tokelau in 1980s and submit a Master of Arts thesis on fatele in 1986. The venue, which is popular for holding music and dance performances, is known as fiafia or festival held at the meeting house where villagers congregate and the music groups arrange themselves according to their village affiliation known as faitu (sides or halves). The performances are held in an atmosphere of fun and humor and are conducted till the elders in the group order it be stopped. Song and dance Pehe are songs of Tokelau, while pehe anamua are ancient songs; hiva are dances. Together, they are popular forms of music in Tokelau. The best-known form of traditional music is fatele, a dance performed at many community gatherings and events. Each song begins with a stanza that is repeated up to a half-dozen times, followed by increased pitch and tempo near the end of the piece. This tradition is shared with the music of Tuvalu. Fetele is a song form which is an abridged and fascinating song rendering of compositions which are situation specific and sung to the text format. The community is usually aware of the singer's capability in composing and rendering such songs. The experienced composer and singer of these songs is known as \\"pulotu\\". One such pulotu who is popular among the public is Ihaia, who is not only a singer but also carpenter and fisherman, with oratory skills blended with humour. Siva is another form of song and dance which is played to soft music which is akin to the Hawaiian hula. In this form hand and arm expressions are synchronized with expressive eye movements. The men perform war dances which is called the men's siva. Older women also perform siva and challenge the palagis (local name for westerners) and the Pago Samoans to dance with them. Other forms of song and dance include hake, a line dance with sticks; hiva hahaka, an action song which is sung with a seated chorus; mauluulu, a seated group dance with men and women performers; tafoe, which is danced with spinning foes (canoe paddles); and upaupa or opaopa, which is performed by women and includes an element of comedy. Songs Fakanau are fishing songs. Hoa are sung with lead and answering voices; tuala, wedding processions songs, are a form of hoa. Mako (love songs) are sung by an individual and include sexual or emotional phrasing. Pehe lagilagi is sung in four-part harmony while seated. Tagi are songs within tales. Funeral songs include the vale (memorial) and haumate (laments). Instruments Drums called pasu or pabu were present in 1841 at the time of the United States Exploring Expedition, but are no longer used or even remembered. Considered unusual for Western Polynesia, the instrument was cylindrical in frame, upright in its playing position, crafted of shark's skin, and beaten with two sticks. Slit-gongs, known as lala or lali, were also described in 1841. They were created from a hollow log and struck with a heavy beater. A smaller version of slit gongs was known as kaulalo. Another smaller slit drum, the pate, was used with handclapping or pati (slapping) during taualuga dancing. Weaving boards (papa or papafailalaga) are struck with thin sticks and produce a brittle sound. Beaten with sticks, moega (rolled mats) are used as accompaniment during mauluulu dancing. Plywood is used for crafting the pokihi, a mat-covered box; it accompanies the fatele dance. Other instruments used in Tokelau are the utete (Jew's harp), fagufagu (flute), pu (shell trumpet), ligoligo (leaf whizzer), pu (leaf oboe), and fagufagu (slit tubes). Bands New Zealand-based band Te Vaka is composed of Tokelauans living in New Zealand, and also has members from Tuvalu and Samoa. They have achieved international commercial success. Many of their songs incorporate elements of Tokelauan music. Their music and dance style are not the traditional Pacific Ocean genre and does not just involve guitars and hula skirts, typical of the ocean region. They have recorded many albums and traveled to Australia, England and Europe. The music group has blended traditional music and contemporary styles and put the music of Tokelau as the leading group from the country. They recorded their first album in 1997 which was called the Te Vaka. The second album released in 1999 was titled Ki Mua. The music group is headed by Opetaia who is versatile, performs on guitar, percussion, sings and is also the music composer. His music was inspired by the oral tradition of the folk stories narrated by his people.

It is located 13 km east of National Highway 3 (Agra-Mumbai highway) and 91 km from Indore, the commercial capital of the state. The Town lies on the north bank of the Narmada River. It was the kingdom of Chaktavartin Samrat Sahastraarjun, a Heheya king. Lately, after many years, it was the capital of the Malwa during the Maratha Holkar reign till 6 January 1818, when the capital was shifted to Indore by Malhar Rao Holkar III. Etymology The word Maheshwar in Hindi means Great God, an epithet of Lord Shiva. History Writers such as HD Sankalia, PN Bose and Francis Wilford, among others, identify Maheshwar as the ancient town of Mahishmati. Maheshwar is believed to be built on the site of the ancient city of Somvanshya Shastrarjun Kshatriya, and was the capital of king Kartavirya Arjuna, (Shree Shastrarjun) who is mentioned in the Sanskrit epics Ramayana and Mahabharata. According to a popular legend, one day the King Sahasrarjun and his 500 wives went to the river for a picnic. When the wives wanted a vast play area, the King stopped the mighty river Narmada with his 1000 arms. While they were all enjoying themselves, Ravana flew by in his Pushpak Vimana. Downstream, when he saw the dry river bed, he thought it was an ideal place to pray to Lord Shiva. He made a Shivalinga out of the sand and began to pray. When Sahasrajuna's wives were done playing and they stepped out of the river bed, he let the waters flow. The voluminous river flowed down sweeping Ravana's Shivalinga along, messing up his prayers. Furious, Ravana tracked Sahasrajuna and challenged him. Armed to the hilt the mighty Ravana was in for a huge surprise. The mighty Sahasrarjuna with the 1000 arms pinned Ravana to the ground. Then he placed 10 lamps on his heads and one on his hand. After tying up Ravana, Sahasrarjuna dragged him home and tied him up to the cradle pole of his son. A humiliated Ravana stayed prisoner until his release was secured. Jamadagni rishi, Renuka Devi and Lord Parashurama with whom Kartavirya Arjuna's story is closely associated also lived nearby. In Mahabharata, there is a narration of an unusual tradition wherein marriage as a civil institution was not universal in Mahishmati unlike in rest of Aryavarta, which is also narrated in the Telugu- language Andhra Mahabharata in ‚ÄòSabha parva‚Äô. As per the legend, there was a Nishada king named Nila who ruled over Mahishmati. King Nila had a daughter who was exceedingly beautiful. So much so that Agni (lord of fire) fell in love with her which was reciprocated. The princess always used to stay near the sacred fire of her father, causing it to blaze up with vigour. And king Nila's sacred fire, even if fanned, would not blaze until agitated by the gentle breath of her lips. Agni, assuming the form of a Brahman starts courting with the princess for long. But, one day the couple was discovered by the king, who became furious. Nila thereupon ordered the Brahman to be punished according to law. At this the illustrious deity flamed up in wrath and beholding the terrible flame, the king felt terrified and bent his head low on the ground. King hails Lord Agni and says he cannot punish a god who is responsible for the origin of Vedas, source of all Knowledge and Dharma. Pacified Agni then grants a boon to Nishada, and the King requests for the protection of his kingdom from any invasions. Agni swears to protect his kingdom on the condition that the king should sanctify pleasure out of pure love a legitimate action in his kingdom. Liberated from the orthodoxy of marriage as a prelude, women of Mahishmati enjoyed freedom that was then unheard of elsewhere in Arya-Varta. Years later, after the epic war the victorious Yudhishthira plans on conducting a Yagna by winning over everyone else on Earth. Sahadeva, the youngest of Pandavas knowing that Lord Agni was protecting the Nishada kingdom, prays to Lord Agni successfully and there upon moves to Saurashtra kingdom. Of note, even to this day, the Sahasrarjun temple at Maheshwar lights 11 lamps in honour of Lord Agni blessing the Kingdom. Alternatively, this tradition is attributed to Sahasrarjun queens humiliating captive ten-headed Ravana by lighting up candles on his foreheads. In the late eighteenth century, Maheshwar served as the capital of the great Maratha queen Rajmata Ahilya Devi Holkar. She embellished the city with many buildings and public works, and it is home to her palace, as well as numerous temples, a fort, and riverfront ghats (broad stone steps which step down to the river). Temples situated within Fort Ahilya - A Major Attraction in Maheshwar Jagadguru Kripaluji Maharaj has performed various akhand (continues) sankirtan outside the Shiva temple at Maheshwar for more than months. Even though Kripaluji was from mahu (30 km from Maheshwar), he frequently visited this place in his early life with devotees of lord Krishna to perform sankirtan on the banks of the Narmada river in Maheshwar Fort Ahilya of the Holkar dynasty, in Maheshwar.

Males constitute 51% of the population and females 49%. Maheshwar has an average literacy rate of 67%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 75%, and female literacy is 59%. In Maheshwar, 14% of the population is under 6 years of age. Economy Maheshwari sari laced with bright Zari (brocade) Looms at Rehwa society, Maheshwari handloom sarees weavers society, Maheshwar.Maheshwar has been a centre of handloom weaving since the 5th century. Maheshwar is the home of one of India's finest handloom fabric traditions. It is noted as a centre for weaving colourful Maheshwari sarees. It rose to popularity under the rule of strong maratha leader Queen Devi Ahilya Bai Holkar. Ahilya Bai wanted royal gifts for the royal guest. Hence weavers from Mandu and Surat were hired and Maheswari saree and turban were weaved. It is said that Ahilya Bai herself designed first saree. These sarees were worn by female members of the royal court. These saris were also gifted to royal guests. You can easily see inspiration of designs in saris in local architecture. These cotton saris are weaved with distinctive designs involving stripes, checks, and floral borders. To save the local handloom industry Rehwa Society, an NGO founded by the Holkars, in 1979. This NGO gave women employment and revived the town's textiles. About 130 weavers associated with the society produce over 100,000 metres of fine fabrics a year. The weaving centre is located in one of Maheshwar's historic buildings. Rehwa Society also provides a free school for weavers' children and runs a low-cost health scheme. There are few other small local organisations involved in weaving of sarees and other fabrics. Ahilya Fort which is now converted into a heritage hotel, founded by 'Maharajkumar Shrimant Shivaji Rao Holkar' (Prince Richard Holkar of Indore), a descendant of both Ahilyabai Holkar and the only son of M.Gen. HH Maharaja Shrimant Yeshwant Rao II Holkar of Indore. Festivals Ghats on the banks of river Narmada Maheshwar is full of festivals and celebrations, some are: Nag Panchami, Gudi Padava, Teez (New year celebrations according to the Hindu calendar), All Mondays of Shravan month, (DOLA of Kashivishwnath on last Monday, bhang is served as prasad of Shiva), Mahashivratri, Samoti Amavas, and all other Indian festivals. There are many visiting places like gold swing is also their and it is situated at Rajwada. Maheshwar also has the temple of Goddess Vindhyavasini Bhavani, one of the 24Shaktipeeths of Goddess Parvati. Every year on the immediately preceding Sunday of Makar Sankranti (i.e. the Sunday just before the date when the Sun is about to enter the sign of Capricorn as per Indian Astrological / Sidereal calendar), Swaadhyaaya Bhavan Ashram (based at Mahalaxmi Nagar, Maheshwar) organizes Mahaamrityunjaya Rath Yaatraa in the town of Maheshwar. This Mahaamrityunjaya Rath Yaatraa was initiated by Shri Harvilas Aasopaa for the welfare of humanity, and is known to be the first of its kind in the world. The yatra intends to invoke blessings of Ayurved Murti Bhagwaan Sadaashiv Mahaamrityunjaya (who is regarded as the primordial and supreme doctor), and it starts from Swaadhyaaya Bhawan Ashram and culminates at the banks of the holy river Narmada.  Film industry and Maheshwar  A scenic view of Narmada from top of the Ahilya fort The exquisite beauty of Maheshwar and river Narmada is captured in some Bollywood and Tamil/ Kollywood movies. Some of the movies shot in Maheshwar including the movie \\"Ashoka\\", Tulsi (by actor and director Sachin), Mahashivratri, A R Rehman's music video, Tamil movie Alaipayuthey's song \\"Snekithanea...\\" and \\" yaro yaro di...\\" directed by Maniratnam, Tamil movie Leelai's song \\"Oru killi oru killi...\\" directed by Andrew Vasanth Louis, Yuvan Shankar Raja's musical Tamil movie Arrambam's song \\"Adadada Arrambame...\\" directed by Vishnuvardhan.

Life =Childhood and youth= Jakub Deml was born in Tasov near T≈ôeb√≠ƒç, then Austria-Hungary, now Czech Republic on 20 August 1878 as a firstborn child of a small store owner Jakub Deml and his second wife Antonie Demlov√°, born Bƒõlochov√°. His grandfather, German Jan Deml, moved to Moravia from Opatov by Moravsk√° T≈ôebov√°. In 1889 at the age of 11, Jakub was sent to a German family in Wulzeshofen by Laa in Austria where he learnt German. In the spring of 1890, Deml returned home due to his mother's serious illness and later death. Deml studied high school in Gymn√°zium T≈ôeb√≠ƒç where he started to publish his first works in the journal Sursum. During the year 1897 Deml published his works in Z√°jmy lidu (Interest of people), and in 1899 in Nov√Ω ≈æivot (New life), Dvac√°t√Ω vƒõk (Twentieth century) a Museo (Museum). After high school, Deml entered a seminary and in 1902 was ordained Roman Catholic priest. =Priesthood and early literary works= Deml's first post as a priest was in Kuƒçerov by Vy≈°kov. In 1905, Deml stopped publishing in Nov√Ω ≈æivot (New life) and started to criticize catholic modernism and clericalism, which made him unpopular with many church representatives. His disputes with clergy and church authorities were slowly escalating also due to the slow implementation of the Decree of Pope Pius X. Finally for health reasons, Deml asked to be released from his duties and in 1907 retired from the priesthood. Bishop Pavel Huyn signed the release papers. =The first republic= Deml put high hopes in the new republican order which started in Czechoslovakia in 1918. Unfortunately even then he was running into problems with bureaucracy. He was allowed to lead a Mass but was still prohibited from preaching and confessions. The year 1918 was important for Jakub Deml as he met with Pavla Kytlicov√° who became his promoter. In 1922 Deml moved to his birthplace Tasov where he permanently settled. His house, designed by the famous architect Bohuslav Fuchs, served as his home until Deml's death. During the years of 1921 and 1928 Deml was a devoted member of Sokol. In 1924 Deml in one of his speeches attacked Orel, the organization competing with Sokol and for his comments was charged with slander. In his work Deml often criticized the Czechoslovakian prezident Tom√°≈° Garrigue Masaryk. His critiques eventually led to Deml's conflict with government officials and his work ≈†l√©pƒõje was confiscated. Deml's prosecution was finally stopped by the president himself. Later in life Deml stated that he valued president Tom√°≈° Garrigue Masaryk, even though he disagreed with him on many points. The year 1929 was marked by the death of Otokar B≈ôezina. Deml's highly controversial work M√© svƒõdectv√≠ o Otokaru B≈ôezinovi (My Testimony about O. B≈ôezina) had many antagonists and had a negative effect on Deml's popularity. In 1932 died Pavla Kytlicov√°, Deml's good friend, publisher, and supporter. That and Deml's troubling health strongly influenced his literary works from this time period. In 1934 Deml published one of his most famous novels Zapomenut√© svƒõtlo (Forgotten light). Again, it received very negative criticism. A year later Deml started corresponding with Marie Rosa Junov√° who became his publisher until the year 1948. =Second World War= During the Second World War Deml did not publish very much and between 1942 and 1945 could not publish at all. In early 1945 the Nazi army occupied Tasov looking for members of the partisan movement. The Nazi's captured several citizens of Tasov and kept them as hostages hoping to get information about the underground. Deml volunteered to be kept as a hostage instead of others, however shortly afterwards the Soviet Army freed the town and all hostages were released. After the war Deml was accused of collaboration with the Nazis, but for lack of evidence he was let go with a small conditional penalty. After 1948, Deml could not publish again. =Last years= In the 1950s Deml's works were yet again banned. Most of his works from this time period are in the form of letters or handwritten works. In January 1961 Deml had to be hospitalized. He was released after a short period but then was hospitalized again and died on 10 February 1961 in the T≈ôeb√≠ƒç hospital. Main works Deml became one of the most important Czech authors of the 1920s and 1930s. During his time his works were not very recognized, however he is now being considered a predecessor of modern literary genre, mainly surrealism. ; Poetry * Pam√°tn√Ω den v Kuksu, 1933 [Day to Remember in Kuks] * Solitudo, 1934 [Solitude] * P√≠se≈à voj√≠na ≈°√≠lence, 193?

Natural endowment is biologically analysed. It is examined through individual genes or inborn abilities. Social endowment is explored through the culture and ethics of human lives in their communities. Natural and social endowment can be used to explain the behaviour of individuals. This natural and social distinction exemplifies individuals' positions within communities. The differences in human capacities enables diverse perceptions towards a similar situation. This includes Stephen Covey's human endowments which are self-awareness, imagination, will power, abundance mentality, courage, creativity, and self- renewal. The philosophical studies of human nature or endowment is outlined in the theories of medieval philosophers on human evolution such as; Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Aristotle, and Baruch Spinoza. Description Endowment in philosophical terms encompasses human innate and acquired capacities. The disciplinary focus of philosophy on human capacities are inclusive in the ontological studies of human nature. The innate and learned human capacities reflects the intrinsic lives and realities of human beings . Endowment either innate or acquired varies among individuals and societies. Each individual consist of their own body and mind from birth until they become socially incorporated in communities where culture is learned and communal living is inevitable. This enables people to live together despite their different set of innate capacities. The necessity of living together as groups in order to thrive is part of individuals' acquired capacities. The epistemological nature of human endowment can be explored through the state of nature theory with the focus on self-interested individuals and the creation of states. Human endowment is also inclusive in the theories of human nature exploring individuals' rational and social behaviours. Jean-Jacques Rousseau (Medieval Philosophers) History In-depth analysis of human endowment is attributed to theories and perceptions of human evolution. The biological and cultural evolution is an on-going process that shapes similarities and distinctive human attributes. Biological and cultural evolution co-exist to influence human activities. Biological evolution is determined by genes or hereditary which naturally gives individuals the ability to speak the language of their associated communities. Cultural evolution is the process where beliefs and a community's way of living is passed down to generations which includes their spoken language The state of nature by Rousseau offers an understanding of self-preservation as the main innate human capacity. Natural human endowment is peoples' willingness to survive and enjoy life. This allows the existence of states which individuals have formulated in order to live peacefully and ensure their continual survival. Aristotle (Medieval Philosopher) Aristotle's human nature focuses on rationality as an innate human capacity that enables them to form communities and states. Aristotle shows the natural existence of communities and states due to individuals' innate capacities to live together. Living in communities reflects the differences between humans' innate abilities. This includes the innate abilities towards political participation between male and female. Human endowment is considered to be of divine nature according to Spinoza. Divine nature is reference to God's influence on human actions. The natural capacities of people to realise what they need enables them to make reasonable decisions and act accordingly. Spinoza's idea of necessity as part of human endowment is connected to God or nature which is the only existing substance. Baruch Spinoza (Medieval Philosopher) Stephen Covey's human endowment is divided into primary and secondary categories. Primary endowment includes; self-awareness, imagination, conscience, volition or will power. Secondary endowments are; abundance mentality, courage and consideration, creativity, and self-renewal. These endowments are explored through the stages of human life which are dependence, independence, and interdependence. Covey's list of human endowment distinguishes between principles and values. Principles are external natural laws that determines the consequences of individual behaviour caused by their internal values. Principles are attributes of acquired or learned human endowment while values are of innate human capacities.  Natural endowment  Endowment in the natural category refers to innate capacities of human beings which they are born with. Humans' instinct nature to preserve themselves is considered a natural endowment under Rousseau's state of nature theory. Individuals without having to acquire any instinctual value have the ability of wanting security to ensure their survival. The natural capacities of individuals to thrive and survive stems unilaterally from human mind rather than a polity. Natural endowment includes individuals' natural rights that allow humans' to be rational without any form of law in place. This differentiates natural endowment from social endowment. Aristotle focuses on reason and mind as part of human natural endowment. Individuals are born with the natural ability to think which enables them to make rational decisions. Individuals through their minds and reason develop abilities which could become habits if they continue to be rational. Aristotle's political perceptions of human nature reflects the idea of unequal natural abilities between genders. This is due to the level of authority individuals have in expressing their innate cognitive faculties. Baruch Spinoza builds on individuals' natural impulses as innate capacities which is from the recognition of what is necessary and nature itself. Humans natural capacities include the innate ability to realise what is necessary and act through reasoning and make decisions. This stems from humans' dependency as part of their innate capacities which cannot be separated from nature or God. The social construction of communities and states is a result of individuals' realisation that living together in a civilised manner is necessary for survival. Stephen Covey's primary endowment includes; self- awareness or self-conscious and imagination as part of humans' natural endowment. Self-awareness or self-conscious is the innate capacity of human beings to be more sensitive of their environment with what they encounter and experience. Individuals' have the natural ability to act reasonably towards certain situations as they know what the situation is and its consequences. Imagination is of individual minds where thoughts beyond real life occurrences and situations take place. Individuals make sense of their environment and world through their natural ability to imagine beyond reality. Social endowment Penglipuran Village is a tourist village in Bali which is famous for being a clean village and still maintaining its customs. A beautiful village surrounded by bamboo forests that are indeed preserved. Human endowment is social when they are acquired or learned from an environment. These learned characteristics varies between individuals and societies. Social endowment includes conscience as part of individuals' learned ability to distinguish between what is right and wrong. This moral decision is a reflection of rules and laws in place to govern a certain group people or society. Individuals develop conscience from their cultures or the way of life within their communities. This differentiates peoples' reactions to certain situations they encounter and experience. The uneven structures and material distribution of goods and services within societies determines individuals' conscience. Individuals who are most vulnerable and make up most of the lower class in society develop a more self-motivated and determined conscience. This social endowment is a reflection of individuals' environment and their corresponding response to it. Social endowment emerges from these communal societies with embedded rules that govern people. The set of rules in place is a result of social endowment where individuals distinguishes between acceptable and inappropriate behaviour. The theory of human nature by Aristotle includes the philosophy of both natural and social human endowment. Social endowment flows from the natural capacities of people like their ability to think and make rational decisions. The gathering of communities and establishing of states are a result of rational decisions people make. This reflects the idea that humans are rational social and political animals. Individuals' social ability to think and make moral decisions allows them to live together in a polity. Living in a polity requires individuals to follow certain rules and way of life which becomes part of their social endowment. Sanctions are in place to correspond governing rules and ensure the maintenance of the polity.

The genus name Syrrhaptes is from Ancient Greek surrhaptos, \\"sewn together\\" (the feathered toes of this sandgrouse are fused together) and tibetanus is from the type locality, Tibet.  Description  The Tibetan sandgrouse is about 30‚Äì41 cm long, with a small, pigeon-like head and neck, but sturdy compact body. It has long pointed wings and pin tail. It has an orange face, finely barred grey breast, neck and crown, white belly and black underwings. Male has unspotted buff wing while the female has barred wing coverts, upperparts and upper belly than the male. Juvenile lacks the tail pin, has narrower barrings and has less orange on the face. White belly and dark underwings are distinctions from the related Pallas's sandgrouse, with which its range overlaps. As with that species, its small feet lack a hind toe, and the three front toes are fused together. The upper surface is feathered, and the underneath has a fleshy pad. The appearance of the foot is more like a paw than an avian foot. left  Taxonomy and systematics  Currently considered monotypic. Birds from the Pamirs were earlier separated as race pamirensis. The species was first described by Gould in 1850 based on specimen from Tso-Morriri in Ladakh.  Distribution and status  Tibetan sandgrouse is found in mountains ranges of Central Asia, Tibet, Central China and the Himalayas. Though the population is decreasing, due to the large range and low rate of population decrease, the species is classified as \\"Least Concern\\" by IUCN.  Behaviour and ecology  Tibetan sandgrouse is found on barren sandy plains near water. They are gregarious and form loose flocks. Their flight is fast and direct and on the wings, a clanging double note is uttered repeatedly. Flocks fly noisily to watering holes at dawn and dusk, usually the former, though less regular than other sandgrouse. They forage in the morning and afternoon on the undulating semi-desert plains. While foranging, their movements are fast and rapid. During the middle of the day it squats in a small depression in the ground, basking in the sun. They are generally not wary, especially in the middle of the day during resting. This species breeds from May to June on the arid stony plateau and ridges, the nest site generally chosen near the top of the ridge on the leeward side. Its nest is a ground scrape in which three pale brown elliptical eggs with cryptic markings are laid. Generally the nest is exposed, though occasionally could be protected by a stone or grass. The young ones are able to move around soon after hatching. They move around with the flock. When threatened, adults resort to distraction displays, while the chicks crouch and freeze. They feed on seeds, grass, buds and legumes.

His parents were teachers and politicians persecuted by the communist regime after the communist revolution of 1948: his mother, a member of the regional parliament, was arrested and sentenced to 18 years in prison; his father, mayor of Humpolec before the communist coup, was also sentenced to 10 years in prison. All property of the Z√°brana family was confiscated when Z√°brana was nineteen. University studies were prohibited to non-communists, so he tried to study in a Catholic school for priests, but this was prohibited, also. From 1952-53, Z√°brana worked in the Tatra Sm√≠chov tram factory in Prague, and the following year in an enamel factory in Radot√≠n, and wrote poems and short stories (published after the fall of the communist regime in 1989 in the book Sedm pov√≠dek).

The ancient ruins of Sagalassos are 7 km from Aƒülasun (as well as being its namesake) in the province of Burdur, on Mount Akdaƒü, in the Western Taurus mountains range, at an altitude of 1450‚Äì1700 metres. In Roman Imperial times, the town was known as the \\"first city of Pisidia\\", a region in the western Taurus mountains, currently known as the Turkish Lakes Region. During the Hellenistic period it was already one of the major Pisidian towns. Introduction The urban site was laid out on various terraces at an altitude between 1400 and 1600 m. After suffering from a major earthquake in the early sixth century CE, the town managed to recover, but a cocktail of epidemics, water shortages, a general lack of security and stability, a failing economy and finally another devastating earthquake around the middle of the seventh century forced the inhabitants to abandon their town and resettle in the valley. Large-scale excavations started in 1990 under the direction of Marc Waelkens of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven. A large number of buildings, monuments and other archaeological remains have been exposed, documenting the monumental aspect of the Hellenistic, Roman and early Byzantine history of this town. History Heroon in the northwest sector Human settlement in the area goes back to 8000 BCE, before the actual site was occupied. Hittite documents refer to a mountain site of Salawassa in the fourteenth century BCE and the town spread during the Phrygian and Lydian cultures. Sagalassos was part of the region of Pisidia in the western part of the Taurus Mountains. During the Persian period, Pisidia became known for its warlike factions. Sagalassos was one of the wealthiest cities in Pisidia when Alexander the Great conquered it in 333 BCE on his way to Persia. It had a population of a few thousand. After Alexander's death, the region became part of the territories of Antigonus Monophthalmus, possibly Lysimachus of Thrace, the Seleucids of Syria and the Attalids of Pergamon. The archeological record indicates that locals rapidly adopted Hellenic culture. The Roman Empire absorbed Pisidia after the Attalids and it became part of the province of Asia. In 39 BCE it was handed out to Galatian client king Amyntas, but after he was killed in 25 BCE Rome turned Pisidia into the province of Galatia. Under the Roman Empire, Sagalassos became the important urban center of Pisidia, particularly favoured by the Emperor Hadrian, who named it the \\"first city\\" of the province and the center of the imperial cult. Contemporary buildings have a fully Roman character. Around 400 CE Sagalassos was fortified for defence. An earthquake devastated it in 518 and a plague circa 541-543 halved the local population. Arab raids threatened the town around 640 and after another earthquake destroyed the town in the middle of the seventh century, the site was abandoned. The populace probably resettled in the valley. Excavations have found only signs of a fortified monastery‚Äîpossibly a religious community, which was destroyed in the twelfth century. Sagalassos disappeared from the records. In the following centuries, erosion covered the ruins of Sagalassos. It was not looted to a significant extent, possibly because of its location. Explorer Paul Lucas, who was traveling in Turkey on a mission for the court of Louis XIV of France, visited the ruins in 1706. After 1824, when Francis Vyvyan Jago Arundell (1780‚Äì1846), the British chaplain at Smyrna and an antiquarian, visited the site and deciphered its name in inscriptions,F.V.J. Arundell, Discoveries in Asia Minor: Including a Description of the Ruins of Several Ancient Cities, Especially Antioch of Pisidia, 2 vols. (London) 1834; \\"The Rediscovery of Sagalassos\\" Western travelers began to visit the ruins. Polish historian of art, count K. Lanckoro≈Ñski produced the first map of Sagalassos. However, the city did not attract much archaeological attention until 1985, when an Anglo-Belgian team led by Stephen Mitchell began a major survey of the site. Modern project Nymphaeum Theatre Upper agora From 1990 Sagalassos, a major tourist site, has become a major excavation project led by Marc Waelkens of the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium. The monumental city center is now exposed; four major restoration projects are (nearly) completed. The project also undertakes an intensive urban and geophysical survey, excavations in the domestic and industrial areas, and an intensive survey of the territory. The first survey documents a thousand years of occupation‚Äîfrom Alexander the Great to the seventh century‚Äîwhile the latter has established the changing settlement patterns, the vegetation history and farming practices, the landscape formation and climatic changes during the last 10,000 years. On August 9, 2007, the press reported the discovery of a finely detailed, colossal statue of the Emperor Hadrian, which is thought to have stood 4-5m in height. The statue dates to the early part of Hadrian's reign, and depicts the emperor in military garb. It was carved in sections that were fitted together with marble tenons on the site, which was a thermae, a public bath. A major earthquake sometime between the late sixth and early seventh centuries CE brought the vaulting crashing down; the statue of Hadrian was felled, coming apart along the joins of its facture. The discovery of carved marble toes drilled with dowel holes to fasten them to the hem of a long mantle suggests the possibility of finding a companion sculpture of Sabina, the emperor's consort. On August 14, 2008, the head statue of Faustina the Elder, wife of Roman emperor Antoninus Pius (Hadrian's successor and adopted son) was discovered in the same site. On August 22, 2008, another colossal portrait head was found, this time of Marcus Aurelius. In a phylogenetic study the mitochondrial DNA of 85 skeletons from Sagalassos dated to the 11th‚Äì13th century AD was compared to modern populations. The research found a significant maternal genetic signature of Balkan/Greek populations, as well as ancient Persians and populations from the Italian peninsula. Some contribution from the Levant was also detected, whereas no contribution from Central Asian population was ascertained.Ottoni Claudio et al.

The Holkars were generals under Peshwa Baji Rao I, and later became Maharajas of Indore in Central India as an independent member of the Maratha Empire until 1818. Later, their kingdom became a princely state under the protectorate of British India. The dynasty was founded with Malhar Rao, who joined the service of the Peshwas of the Maratha Empire in 1721, and quickly rose to the rank of Subedar. The name of the dynasty was associated with the title of the ruler, who was known informally as Holkar Maharaja.  Establishment of Holkar rule  Fort Ahilya in Maheshwar A Statue of Ahilyabai Holkar at Datta Temple Malhar Rao Holkar (1694-1766), a Maratha chief serving Peshwa Baji Rao, established the dynasty's rule over Indore. In the 1720s, he led Maratha armies in Malwa region, and in 1733 was granted 9 parghanas in the vicinity of Indore by the Peshwa. The township of Indore had already existed as an independent principality established by Nandlal Mandloi of Kampel, Nandlal Mandloi was won by the Maratha force and allowed them to camp across the Khan River. In 1734, Malhar Rao established a camp later called Malharganj. In 1747, he started the construction of his royal palace, the Rajwada. By the time of his death, he ruled much of Malwa, and was acknowledged as one of the five virtually independent rulers of the Maratha Confederacy. He was succeeded by Ahilyabai Holkar (r. 1767‚Äì1795), his daughter-in-law. She was born in the Chaundi village in Maharashtra. She moved the capital to Maheshwar, south of Indore on the Narmada River. Rani Ahilyabai was a prolific builder and patron of Hindu temples in Maheshwar and Indore. She also built temples at sacred sites outside her kingdom, from Dwarka in Gujarat east to the Kashi Vishwanath Temple at Varanasi on the Ganges. The adopted son of Malhar Rao Haolkar, Tukoji Rao Holkar (r. 1795-1797) briefly succeeded Rani Ahilyabai upon her death. Tukoji Rao had been a commander under Ahilyabai for her entire rule. Extending the Holkar dominion Yashwantrao Holkar. His son Yashwantrao Holkar (r. 1797‚Äì1811) (also called as Jaswant Rao) succeeded him upon his death. He tried to free the Delhi Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II from the British in the unsuccessful Second Anglo-Maratha War. The grateful Shah Alam gave him the title of Maharajadiraj Rajrajeshwar Alija Bahadur in honor of his bravery. Tookajee Rao Holkar II, Indore, from a drawing by Mr. W. Carpenter, Jun.,\\" from the Illustrated London News, 1857 Attempts by Yashwantrao Holkar to unite the kings failed, and he was approached to sign a peace treaty with the British. The Treaty of Rajghat, signed late December 1805, recognised him as a sovereign king. Battle of Mahidpur Tukojirao Holkar III Maharaja Holkar of Indore In 1811, the four-year-old Maharaja Malharrao Holkar II succeeded Yashwantrao Holkar. His mother, Maharani Tulsabai Holkar, looked after the administration. However, with the help of Pathans, Pindaris, and the British, Dharama Kunwar and Balaram Seth plotted to imprison Tulsabai and Malharrao. When Tulsabai learnt about this, she beheaded both of them in 1815 and appointed Tantia Jog. As a result, Gaffur Khan Pindari secretly signed a treaty with the British on 9 November 1817 and killed Tulsabai on 19 December 1817. The treaty was signed on 6 January 1818 at Mandsaur. Bhimabai Holkar did not accept the treaty, and kept attacking the British by guerilla methods. Rani Lakshmibai of Jhanshi took inspiration from Bhimabai Holkar and also fought against the British. At the conclusion of the Third Anglo-Maratha War, the Holkars lost much of their territory to the British and were incorporated into the British Raj as a princely state of the Central India Agency. The capital was shifted from Bhanpura to Indore. Princely state A silver rupee of Shivajirao Holkar 1886-1903, minted at Indore in Vikram Samvat 1948 (1891) Malharrao Holkar III entered Indore on 2 November 1818. Tantia Jog was appointed his Diwan as he was a minor. As the old palace had been destroyed by the army of Daulat Rao Scindia, a new palace was constructed in its place. Malharrao III was succeeded by Martandrao Holkar, who formally ascended to the throne on 17 January 1834. He was replaced by Harirao Holkar, nephew of Yashwantrao, who ascended to the throne on 17 April 1834. He adopted Khanderao Holkar on 2 July 1841 and died on 24 October 1843. Khanderao was formally installed as the ruler on 13 November 1843, but he suddenly died on 17 February 1844. Tukojirao Holkar II (1835‚Äì1886) was installed on the throne on 27 June 1844. During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, he was loyal to the British East India Company. In October 1872, he appointed T. Madhava Rao as the Diwan of Indore. He died on 17 June 1886 and was succeeded by his eldest son, Shivajirao. Yashwantrao Holkar II (reigned 1926‚Äì1948) ruled Indore state until shortly after India's independence in 1947, when he acceded to the Union of India.
