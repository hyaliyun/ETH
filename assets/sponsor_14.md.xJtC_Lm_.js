He has previously coached the Rochdale Hornets. Before his coaching career, Shaw played for a number of clubs in England and Australia. Shaw played for Brisbane Broncos, London Broncos, Sheffield Eagles, Castleford Tigers, and Salford City Reds. Darren Shaw played in Sheffield Eagles' 17-8 victory over Wigan in the 1998 Challenge Cup Final during Super League III at Wembley Stadium, London on Saturday 2 May 1998. Darren Shaw was assistant coach to Bobbie Goulding at Rochdale Hornets prior to taking charge at Leigh in 2006. Shaw replaced Tony Benson after Benson was relieved of his duties following a shock play-off defeat by Batley Bulldogs. Shortly after Shaw's appointment it was found that he did not have the relevant coaching qualifications to take charge of a team at National Leagues level. To counter this, Shaw was made Football Manager, with Paul Rowley becoming First Team coach. Darren Shaw's first full season in charge of Leigh Centurions ended with a 19–6 play off defeat away to Whitehaven. Leigh's 2007 season was one dogged by inconsistency. Convincing wins were often followed by heavy defeats as Shaw was forced to field a number of youngsters due to injury problems. The unsettled nature of the side in 2007 was reflected by the fact that Shaw gave débuts to over 20 players over the course of the season. Despite the disappointing end to the 2007 season, Shaw was given a contract to coach Leigh for the 2008 season. After a promising start to the 2008 season, Shaw tendered his resignation following defeats by Salford, Widnes and Featherstone Rovers. He was appointed as Head Coach of Rochdale Hornets in May 2008.

The breed name derives from its two principal areas of origin, the Vallée d'Aure in the département of the Hautes-Pyrénées, and the area of Saint-Girons and the Couserans in the Ariège. The name \\"Casta\\" derives from its chestnut colour.  History  The Casta originates in the French Pyrénées. It is among the oldest breeds of the Midi. Traditionally, two types were recognised, from two different areas of the range: the Auroise, from the Vallée d'Aure in the département of the Hautes-Pyrénées; and the Saint- Gironnaise, from the area of Saint-Girons and the Couserans in the Ariège. The breed was found throughout the high Pyrénées, from the area of Tarbes in the west to Foix in the east. The breed was officially named the \\"race bovine d'Aure et de Saint-Girons\\" in 1900. A herd-book was established in 1901 or in 1919. During the 1960s there was some limited cross-breeding with the Bazadais breed of the Gironde. Between 1930 and 1958, the population of the Casta fell from about 30 000 to less than 9 000 head. In the years after the Second World War, numbers fell still further, and by 1983 only 76 cows in 12 farms could be found. The breed was listed by the FAO as \\"endangered-maintained\\" in 2007. In 2005, the population was estimated at 427 head; in 2014 it was 320.  Characteristics  The Casta is usually grey, but may also be chestnut-brown. The skin and mucous membranes are pale. The horns are lyre-shaped. Bulls weigh about and cows about . Cows stand about at the withers.  Uses  The Casta was originally a triple-purpose breed, kept for meat, for milk, and for draught work. It is now raised mainly for meat. The milk has a high fat content, and is used in the production of cheese.  References  .

Creyton began his professional career in radio and revue in Melbourne, Australia and became well known in Sydney starring in and writing popular comedy-melodramas at the Music Hall theatre-restaurant in Neutral Bay. He gained national prominence in 1964–66, as one of the original stars and writers of the topical comedy revue TV series The Mavis Bramston Show. Creyton also spent time in the United Kingdom, where he appeared in British comedy television series including Doctor in the House. Following his return to Australia, he appeared in television series such as The Sullivans and Carson's Law. Creyton has been a theatre performer since 1957 and stage work has included theatrical versions of Don's Party, The Naked Vicar ShowCreyton now works in the United States.  Family history  Creyton is the great grandson of Shakespearean actor William Hoskins. Hoskins was a leading member of the Samuel Phelps company at Sadler's Wells and tutor to a young Sir Henry Irving, securing Irving's first acting job for him. Hoskins emigrated to Australia in 1856 to take up management of a theatre. The teenage Irving intended to accompany him, but family duties detained him in England where he went on to become the greatest exponent of Shakespeare of 19th Century British theatre. Irving never forgot Hoskins and paid warm tribute in his autobiography. As actor-manager, Hoskins played in Sydney, Melbourne, New Zealand and America and his performances became legend in their time. He died in New Zealand in 1886 and his obituary stated \\"as a student and critical reader of Shakespeare, he had certainly no superiors in any part of the world\\". Of Welsh descent, Creyton's grandfather was born Thomas George Parry in New Zealand and was adopted at birth by Hoskins who later trained him as an actor. Wanting to succeed on his own merits, he changed his name for the stage to Paul Creyton. Creyton left New Zealand for Australia in 1897 and performed in Sydney and Melbourne before establishing his own repertory company in Queensland.  TV career  In 1964 Creyton was recruited by Carol Raye to co-star in the topical satire TV series The Mavis Bramston Show; he appeared weekly between 1964 and 1966, and also wrote sketch material and composed music, including the show's theme Togetherness. He also authored two successful plays for Sydney's Music Hall theatre-restaurant—Lady Audley's Secret, in which he also starred, played for a year in Sydney and was produced on two subsequent occasions in Melbourne; How The West Was Lost, a satire on the TV western genre, also ran for a year in Sydney. During this period, he wrote a weekly newspaper column, composed music for the popular Phillip Street Revue and The Downstairs Revue, and recorded two best-selling comedy LPs with Noeline Brown, which are among the first comedy albums ever produced in Australia. He went on to star in his own TV series The Barry Creyton Show, and several dramatic plays for ABC Television.  United Kingdom  Creyton moved to England for nine years, playing in comedy, dramatic roles and revue in the West End. He appeared in Don's Party directed by Michael Blakemore at the Royal Court, Roger's Lost Stand at the Duke of York's, Ten Years Hard at the Mayfair, the musical Liz, several revues and a national tour of Abelard and Eloise. He also appeared in episodes of TV series, including Take Three Girls, Doctor In Charge, The Expert and Kindly Leave The Curb. He played a leading role in the BBC's radio soap opera Waggoner's Walk, and was a frequent broadcaster for the BBC World Service. He also wrote a farce for the stage, Follow That Husband, which was produced by Ray Cooney.  Return to Australia  In 1977, Creyton returned to Australia, where he starred in the stage production of the revue The Naked Vicar Show. During the next ten years he worked in TV, the movies and the theatre. He starred Alan Ayckbourn's Bedroom Farce, Season's Greetings and Absurd Person Singular, Michael Frayn's Noises Off (directed by Michael Blakemore) and in Hugh Whitemore's Pack of Lies, Side By Side By Sondheim, The Owl And The Pussycat, Suddenly At Home, and in 1986 played twins in the comedy-thriller Corpse. He was a lead writer on the award-winning Australian TV series Carson's Law and contributed regular episodes to its long run, at the same time writing comedy material for the daytime variety showThe Mike Walsh Show as well as appearing in some ninety guest spots on this popular TV show. In 1987, he directed the musical Nunsense which broke box office records all over Australia, and employed two companies playing simultaneously. With the author's permission he revised the dialogue for Australian audiences, an exercise he repeated for Irish audiences in the Dublin production which he directed in June 1988. During the Perth run of Corpse, a motor-cycle accident resulted in a badly broken leg. The ensuing period of hospitalisation allowed him to write a comedy for the stage, Double Act. He and Noeline Brown starred in the original production which opened in September 1987 to universal critical acclaim and broke all box office records for the Ensemble Theatre. Since then, Double Act has been produced in more than twenty languages. The Paris production starred popular Spanish movie star Carmen Maura and celebrated French star Jean-Pierre Cassel. In Madrid, with Lola Herrera, it ran for over a year. In Canada, starring George Segal, it broke two box office records. The Berlin production, originating at the famous Komodie Theater has been playing somewhere in Germany with major stars for the last sixteen years. A highly successful national tour of England followed London's West End production. In 1996, Garry McDonald and his wife Diane Craig starred in the Perth Theatre Company production which toured regional Australia. The 1998 U.S production featured movie star Keir Dullea and Tony Award winner Bonnie Franklin. Most recently, Double Act was a success in the 2001 season in Rome and toured Italy in 2002. In 2002, a prestigious production won acclaim in Vienna. Double Act will be filmed in 2009. In 1988, Creyton was honoured with the Norman Kessel Memorial Award for his contributions to Australian theatre as actor, playwright and director.  America  Since 1989, he has worked almost exclusively in the United States where he has written movies-of-the- week for TV. He wrote all the sketch material for the off Broadway revue Secrets Every Smart Traveler Should Know which ran for two and a half years in New York. In January 1996, after a seven-year absence, Creyton returned to Australia to star in the Queensland Theatre Company's production of Noël Coward's Blithe Spirit. Its success encouraged him to return to Sydney to direct and star in his own play Valentine's Day at Marian Street Theatre where it played to capacity. Valentine’s Day is currently playing in Germany (Valentinstag) and in the Netherlands (Valentijnsdag). Australian revivals were produced in 2005 and 2007 and a revival of Double Act (the fifth in Australia) began a national tour in 2006. Two years later, he wrote, directed and starred in the bitter-sweet comedy Later Than Spring, also for Marian Street and to critical acclaim. In 2007 he again co-starred with Noeline Brown in the British play Glorious at the Ensemble, Sydney. His novels, The Dogs of Pompeii and Nero Goes to Rome, co-authored with American writer Vaughan Edwards, are published by Random House.

Lord joined the 9th Brigade of the Royal Regiment of Artillery on 18 October 1854 as a veterinary surgeon, and was retired on half-pay in May 1864. He served in the Crimean War, was present at Sebastopol and served in central India. He also travelled in Asia and Canada. Lord was a man of catholic interests. His articles contributed to Nature and Art show a wide range of subject matter - mackerel, fishing, lithographic stone, silkworms, sandgrouse, metallurgy, bamboo, flying fish, nuts, the backroads of London, tin, fir cones, palms and plants, and a host of other topics that piqued his interest. The British Museum catalogue lists nine books written by Lord. The best-known of these is Shifts and Expedients of Camp Life, Travel and Exploration first published in 1868 in serial form, and lavishly illustrated with woodcuts and text contributions by Thomas Baines and engraved by Butterworth & Heath. This manual of survival in the wild, was a 19th-century equivalent of the Whole Earth Catalogue, and still retains its usefulness in the 21st century as an encyclopaedia of practical living. Guides to travelling featuring useful hints were quite fashionable at the time when Livingstone, Speke, Burton and Stanley were household names. Francis Galton wrote The Art of Travel in 1855 and subtitled it Shifts and Contrivances available in Wild Countries. For anyone having to manage without the luxuries of the modern urban society, \\"Shifts and Expedients\\" provides detailed instructions on 'wagons and boats, horses and oxen, tents and firearms, hunting and fishing, observing and collecting, carpentry and metal-working, camping requisites, bush cuisine, medical improvisation, the best ways to cross rivers, to move heavy objects and to build huts.' Four of Lord's books deal with sea-fishing, two are on mining in Ireland, one has a self-explanatory title The Key to Fortune in New Lands, and the last Diamonds and Gold:the three main routes to the South African Ophir. This last book is particularly enigmatic since Lord is not known to have visited South Africa. His brother John Keats Lord was also an author who wrote about similar topics. Lord died at his residence in Paignton, Devon, aged 58.

BookWorld is a British Columbia-based quarterly newspaper about the book trade. It was established in 1987. Founded by Alan Twigg in 1987, B.C. BookWorld is Canada's largest-circulation, independent publication about books. Mission B.C. BookWorld aims to take the reviewing process out of the book publication trade, as its founder feels that most book reviews are too highbrow for the average reader's tastes. Founder Alan Twigg writes about B.C. Bookworld: :With BookWorld we have tried, from the outset, to institutionalize an educational newspaper that favours lively, up-to-date news rather than opinions. To do so, we have essentially taken a high-brow subject - books - and married it with a low-brow format - the tab newspaper. The end result is a middle-brow product that everyone can enjoy and use. It's pretty simple. And yet when I look at most other publications about books, it still seems to be unique. :Why cater to ten per cent of the population, the literary aristocracy, when you can reach the 80% of the population who like to read books? The general public is understandably turned off by the traditional book reviewing process, for good reasons. Your average book review consists of one literary aristocrat trying to tell other literary aristocrats how to think. Too often the reviewer is so busy trying to impress the reader with his or her intelligence and writing skill that he or she neglects to pass along basic information about what the hell the book is about. :At least half of the book reviews I see are corrupt. That is, all too often reviewers, who are usually underpaid or not paid at all, will 'pay themselves' by taking the freedom to abuse the public platform. Some will co-opt the space as an advertisement for themselves. Others will irresponsibly slag their enemies or support their friends. When reviewers are underpaid, it's very hard for an editor to ask for a re-write. The public by and large senses these recurrent failings and shuns the process. Staff B.C. BookWorld publishes with a permanent staff of only two employees: * David Lester, a musician with the music duo Mecca Normal * Alan Twigg, who is also an author on subjects that include history, politics, soccer and the Dalai Lama. The publication has been supported and overseen by Pacific BookWorld News Society since 1988. Publication details B.C. BookWorld publishes in March, June, September and November. Related activities In addition to the quarterly publication, B.C. BookWorld are involved in several book-related activities in the British Columbia area. Awards B.C.

The rolled up crêpes then can be stacked on each other with the sauce poured over them. The dish does not originate from the Hortobágy National Park region of the Great Hungarian Plain and has nothing to do with Hortobágy. It was originally invented for the 1958 Brussels World Fair. However, some Hungarian recipe books already featured a similar recipe in the 1930s. The name of the food is simply a marketing trick.

When the city was returned to the Papal States in 1248, Guido was able to return and was made chief of the local council. In 1270, after the death of Bishop Felix, he divided the power in the city and that of Comacchio with Guido Riccio da Polenta, in collaboration with the other major Ravennate family, the Traversari. However, Guido and Guido Riccio soon were at war, and Guido allied with the Malatesta of Rimini in order also to counter Guido I da Montefeltro who had conquered Forlì and Cervia. Through this alliance Guido was able to gain the complete seigniory of Ravenna. The marriage of his daughter Francesca with Giovanni Malatesta caused a revolt in the city, whose outcome was the expulsion of the Traversari. In 1282 he took part to the offensive of Pope Martin V against Guido da Montefeltro, and was able to gain Cervia in the fray. In 1290 he was elected podestà of Florence.

He lived in the time of Mongolian occupation of Armenian land. His verses are written in the spirit of religious Fatalism; at the same time, he criticized clergy for hypocrisy. Frik lived during the year 1230 through 1310. It is not known whether his name was really Frik or not. Many believe his name was a “pseudonym” or “an abbreviated form” of his original name. The Armenian scholar, Zhamkochian, identified Frik's possible birthplace and concluded that he was born in Western Armenia. Zhamkochian saw that his Armenian writing was very similar to the language of Cilician Armenia which is how he found out his birthplace. It is said that more than 50 of Frik's poetry survived during the years. Some of the poems include “From Protest”, “An Excerpt”, and “Song”. Poems A small amount of Frik's poems were first published in 1930. Two of his well-known poems were ”Complaint to Christ” and “Against Fate”. Both poems had strong doubts regarding religious faith and questioned the values of those who called themselves “Christians” and did not act through with their words or beliefs. Frik's writing was considered “Armenian medieval poetry” since he was from Armenian origins and grew up two centuries after the Mongol Empire crushed the Armenian Bagratouni royal court during their invasion. Much of his inspiration came from power and how it is wrongly used instead of giving individuals “equality and freedom”. He was also a Christian, but questioned his beliefs because of the negativity that the clergy of the church promoted.

It occurs in coastal and lowland forest from Te Paki in the north of the North Island south to Mahia Peninsula and Taranaki. It is one of a number of New Zealand Metrosideros species which live out their lives as vines, unlike the northern rata (M.robusta), which generally begins as a hemi-epiphyte and grows into a huge tree. Description Leaves and stems of a young specimen of M. carminea'Metrosideros carminea prefers warm moist habitats and grows up to 15 m. long or more, with the main stem several centimetres in diameter. The small, glossy, pointed leaves are thick, and often widest in the middle. The small rounded and shiny deep-green leaves have are borne on reddish new stems. Carmine rātā flowers from late winter to mid-spring, and has vibrant displays of bright red flowers in groups at the ends of the stems. The seed capsules ripen between late spring and early autumn. It climbs in the same way as ivy, sending out short adventitious roots to adhere to the trunks of host trees, penetrating and clinging to rough surfaces. The climbing shoots of juvenile plants grow rapidly and quickly extend the length of the plant. The short clinging roots usually die after about a year, so that when the vine is mature, the thick, twisted, rope-like stems hang free from the host like thick ropes. Cultivation This species of climbing rātā is often cultivated for its bright flowers that appear in the early spring. It is generally available from most retail nurseries in New Zealand, although most plants sold are from adult cuttings which grow into shrubs rather than climbers. Carmine Rata prefers a moist semi-shady position, sheltered from frost. There are several cultivars of M. carminea. Metrosideros ‘Red Carpet’ flowers freely in October (late spring in New Zealand). Another cultivar, Metrosideros ' Carousel' is an attractive dwarf shrub useful as a groundcover, having glossy lime-green leaves with broad gold margins and small carmine-red flowers in spring. It grows to 80 cm. Metrosideros 'Ferris Wheel' has glossy deep green leaves. It bears bright carmine red flowers with golden stamens through spring. It grows to 90 cm. Generally, only seedling plants will behave as climbers. Those propagated vegetatively from mature plants, typically by cuttings or layering, usually develop into small shrubs or groundcovers. That is why the cultivars described above are not climbers. See also * Colenso's tātā * Large white tātā * Scarlet rātā * Small white rātā * White rātā References * Dawson, D., and R. Lucas, 2000.

Extent of the disaster One third of Chittagong, a city of five million residents, came under water due to heavy rainfall and tidal water. The flash floods in the hills caused mud slides and rubble to bury shanties at the foot of the hills near Chittagong Cantonment. Many residents took refuge in local mosques after losing their homes in the disaster. The death toll was reported to be at least 128, including at least 59 children, with more than 150 injured..Bangladesh landslides, rain kill 68 people, Reuters, 11 June 2007. This is expected to rise further as the rescue efforts got underway and additional reports were received.

Causes of the disaster Rainfall totals over Bangladesh from 4 through 11 June 2007, based on measurements from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite. The heaviest rainfall, of up to 500 mm (20 inches), is shown in red. Orange, yellow, green and blue indicate rainfall up to 400, 300, 200 and 100 mm respectively. Bangladesh's annual monsoon for 2007 started with unusually heavy rain, intensified by a storm from the Bay of Bengal on 9–10 June 2007. By 11 June, more than one-third of the southeastern coastal city of Chittagong was under water, reported the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. In addition to the floods, the rains triggered devastating landslides in the deforested hills on which the city is built. Chittagong Deputy Commissioner Mukhlesur Rahman blamed hill cutting for the disaster. Lalkhan Bazar, one of the worst damaged areas in the mudslide, has been identified as one of the most affected by hill cutting led by influential people. Professor of Geography and Environmental studies in Chittagong University Shahidul Islam explained, \\"The only reason for Monday's mud slide in the cantonment area is cutting hills indiscriminately... We were warning about this risk for decades, and this event our fears real.\\" Architect Jerina Hossain said, \\"Cutting hills made the soil slippery and loose. As a result, it came down with the rain.\\" Communications Adviser of the Bangladesh Government Major General MA Matin supervising the rescue operation on behalf of the Chief Adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed directed Chittagong divisional and district administration to identify those responsible for hill cutting on 14 June. Other areas In the same monsoon onslaught other areas in Bangladesh suffered in varying degrees. In the nearby town of Comilla, to the north, 60,000 people were rendered homeless and in the adjacent district of Cox's Bazar, to the south, 400,000 people were marooned in floods.ADRC Disaster Report .

He was Bobby Allison's crew chief for his 1983 NASCAR Cup championship.Biography at the West Coast Stock Car Hall of Fame, Retrieved November 22, 2007 He was inducted in the West Coast Stock Car Hall of Fame in 2006. He is the current team manager of Action Express Racing and winner of three straight IMSA SportsCar Prototype championships from 2014-2016, and a fourth in 2018.. NASCAR crew chief Nelson was born in Elgin, Illinois on June 5, 1953, the sixth child and second son of Mildred Ollendorf and Arnold Nelson. Arnold moved his family to Redlands, California one year later to get out of the cold. Nelson left school after completing the 9th grade. Nelson started in the racing business at 16 years old, cleaning up the shop for San Bernardino, California driver Ivan Baldwin. Nelson soon became Baldwin's number one asset as crew chief, engine builder and all around mechanic. Ivan Baldwin driving with Gary Nelson as crew chief became the top team for short track racing on the west coast. Baldwin and Nelson raced any time anywhere and seemed to win or crash on a regular basis from 1969 thru 1976. The pair raced NASCAR stock cars winning numerous track championships on the west coast. In 1976 Nelson took a floor sweeper job at DiGard Racing in the South East with young Darrell Waltrip, driving. The team won Waltrip's first big track race at Darlington in 1977. Nelson moved through the ranks to become DiGard's Chief Mechanic in 1978 as the team won at most NASCAR tracks from 1977 - 1979. Finishing 2nd to Richard Petty in the 1979 Winston Cup Championship. Nelson took a one-year break to help a friend start a new business, Ron Eaton, of Lakewood Washington. Returning to DiGard late in 1981 Nelson became crew chief for DiGard's newest driver Bobby Allison. Allison had been driving for 21 years at the time and raced for 21 different owners with no championships. The combination of Nelson and Allison proved to be strong, winning their first race, the 1982 Daytona 500. Together they won 9 Winston Cup races in 1982 finishing second in points to Darrell Waltrip, who had moved to Junior Johnson's race team. Nelson and Allison came back in 1983 even stronger, winning 7 Winston Cup events and the 1983 Winston Cup Championship with Waltrip finishing 2nd. Things began to unravel between Allison and the team owners of DiGard in 1984 and 1985. Frustrated with the internal battle between Allison and DiGard Nelson built a R&D; car and took it to Daytona in July 1985 to prove his ideas. Greg Sacks was offered a one race ride to drive the car. The team won what many call the biggest upset in NASCAR history by winning the 400 mile event. Instead of ending the Allison, DiGard dispute as Nelson had hoped, the Sacks victory caused even more internal conflict. When Rick Hendrick called asking Nelson to help start a second team for Hendrick Motorsports Nelson decided to take Rick up on his offer. Nelson was paired with Geoff Bodine and charged with building a complete Winston Cup race team in less than 4 months. The new team's first race together brought another win for Nelson, the 1986 Daytona 500. The team went on to win one more race in 1986 at Dover. Hendrick Motorsports began to struggle with many engine failures and crashes making 1987 a difficult year for all involved. For 1988, Nelson, continued with a limited schedule at Hendrick Motorsports but never won again with Geoff Bodine. Having a few weekends off, Nelson worked part-time in 1988 for ESPN as a booth announcer alongside Bob Jenkins and Ned Jarrett. Felix Sabates hired Nelson late in 1988 to build a new team called Sabco racing. Kyle Petty became Sabco's driver. The Nelson - Petty combination began building momentum with several wins from 1989 to 1991 but a 12-week recovery from a broken leg Kyle suffered during a crash at Talladega sent the team into a tailspin. Bill France Jr asked Nelson to become the Winston Cup Series director late in 1991. Nelson worked for NASCAR as its Winston Cup Director during its biggest growth period 1992 through 2001. NASCAR promoted Nelson to Vice President of R&D; in 2001 giving him the task of building the NASCAR R&D; Center in Concord, NC. The first task of the R&D; Center, led by Nelson was to improve the safety of racing. NASCAR had lost 10 drivers in its top three National racing series between 1991 and 2001. Of all Nelson's success in racing, Nelson is most proud of the safety improvements. Dale Earnhardt lost his life on February 18, 2001. Since that date to the time of this writing (July 2, 2019) there has not been another life-threatening accident in any of NASCAR's National racing series. Nelson left his position at NASCAR in 2007 to form his own company, Gary Nelson & Associates. NASCAR became the first client for Gary Nelson & Associates. A motorcycle race team (Pair of Nines) hired Gary Nelson & Associates to manage their racing team. The team won several events and the 2008 Moto ST championship. Also in 2008, a Grand American road race team, Brumos Porsche, hired Nelson as consultant. The team won the 2009 Rolex 24-hour endurance race in Daytona. In 2010 Gary Nelson & Associates was hired to form a new team called Action Express Racing for new car owner Bob Johnson. Nelson took the title of Team Manager, a position he holds today. Action Express Racing, managed by Gary Nelson won its first race, the 2010 Rolex 24 event in Daytona and has gone on to win several other events during 2011 - 2014 including the 2014 Rolex 24 in Daytona. Nelson was inducted into the West Coast Stock Car Racing Hall of Fame and is credited with many innovations still in use today in racing. Roof flaps, power steering, generation 5 NASCAR chassis, cowl flaps, are a few. Nelson feels the best compliment he can receive is to be called a \\"Racer\\" Nelson resides in Concord North Carolina with his wife Christine and their two sons, William and John. NASCAR roles He was hired as a broadcaster for ESPN during the 1988 season. He was hired by NASCAR and has held several roles in the organization. He was the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup series director, Vice President of Competition, and Vice President of Research and Development. Nelson owns Provident Auto Supply, a North Carolina-based performance parts distributor. Provident is the only parts supplier for the NASCAR \\"specification\\" engine that is used in the Camping World Series division, which is also optional on tracks under two kilometers in length for the Camping World Truck Series.

Originally built as a \\"late 12th- or early 13th century defensive motte\\"Murray (1993), p.1 it provided protection for Starny Keppie harbour and Rattray village. Sometime between 1214 and 1233 it was upgraded by William Comyn, jure uxoris Earl of Buchan before being destroyed in the 1308 Harrying of Buchan. After Comyn's timber castle was burned down it was replaced by a stronger stone castle which was engulfed during a 1720 sand storm along with nearby Rattray village. After the storm, the castle was not dug out and remains covered to this day. The castle was described by W. Douglas Simpson as one of the nine castles of the Knuckle, referring to the rocky headland of north-east Aberdeenshire.  Location  The castle was sited on Castlehill, on the south bank of the now closed estuary flowing into Strathbeg Bay- the north bank was protected by the opposite Lonmay Castle. Specifically the castle was \\"beside an inlet which led from the sea into a sheltered harbour\\" on \\"the harbour side\\" of Rattray village. The later stone castle is known to have had a \\"harbour-side entrance\\". Originally situated on \\"a rock near the sea\\",Bruce (2005); quoted as book source at World66.com \\"Rattray Head Travel Guide\\" article on Rattray. Castlehill is today about 1 mile inland as shifting sands have significantly altered the shape of the coast. Located to the south of Loch Strathbeg it can be seen as a grassy \\"circular mound\\" which is \\"oval & natural with its top slightly dished\\". A 1791 book states it has a \\"summit\\"... [of] \\"half a Scots acre\\"Playfair (1819), p.78 (approx. 0.25 hectare) and \\"rises 38 feet\\"... (11.6 metres) \\"above a small plain on the\\"... north-east \\"but is only 12 or 14 feet\\"... (3.7 or 4.3 metres) \\"above the higher ground\\"Sinclair (1791), p.419 to the south-west.  c.1100 AD to c.1200 AD  The first construction on Castlehill was a small late middle age, 12th century \\"timber castle or Motte\\" built to protect the estuary.  Comyn period (c.1200 AD - 1308 AD)  In the 13th century the Castle of Rattray was \\"the principal seat of the Cummings\\"... [alt. spelling of Comyn] \\"Earls of Buchan\\"Kennedy (1818), p.323 who arrived at the start of that century. Between 1214 when he inherited the Earldom of Buchan and his own death in 1233, William Comyn, jure uxoris Earl of Buchan built upon the motte but it is unclear whether he upgraded the existing buildings or built an entirely new castle. He is known to have completed a \\"manor house\\"Murray (1993) with \\"a fine timber-framed hall\\" (the castle) which was accompanied by the private St Mary's Chapel which he constructed \\"a quarter of a mile\\" (0.4 kilometres) south, in Rattray village itself. In the mid-1270s it is reported that \\"a castle-strengthening programme at\\"... \\"Rattray\\"Young (1997), p.150 took place. Comyn's castle survived until the Harrying of Buchan in the summer of 1308, when all the Comyn lands were bloodily burnt to the ground after John Comyn, Earl of Buchan was beaten at the Battle of Barra. The timber Rattray Castle was almost certainly attacked by Robert the Bruce or his younger brother Edward after which the \\"castle fell into ruins\\" if not burned to the ground.  1308 AD - 1720 AD  Following the Harrying, the site of Rattray's timber castle was rebuilt with a \\"stone built hall\\". This stone incarnation provided protection for Starnie Keppie harbour and the village at Rattray, as the previous incarnations did. The Earldom of Buchan and hence the castle was inherited and divided after the harrying between John Comyn's two nieces. Henry de Beaumont, the husband of one niece; Alice Comyn, claimed the title under her name but was disinherited from the lands in 1314. A 1324 charter from Robert the Bruce then gives the \\"lordship of Rattray\\" to Sir Archibald Douglas.Robertson (1847), p.394 The lands again change hands in 1382 when Alexander Stewart was given the Earldom by his father Robert II of Scotland. Mary, Queen of Scots, declared Rattray a Royal Burgh in 1563 \\"to put an end to the disputes about superiority over it between William Keith, 4th Earl Marischal and George Hay, 7th Earl of Erroll\\". The importance of the Burgh is questionable due to the fact \\"it does not appear to have long enjoyed that privilege not being ranked in the roll of boroughs for many ages\\" Kennedy (1818) p.323 and as it was \\"said to have had all tire privileges of a royal borough except sending members to parliament\\" In later years Rattray was run by a feudal system of superiors who maintained the land for the Crown, some of whom are known due to charters that they granted. \\"David Rivis\\"... \\"superior of the lands of Rattray\\"Sinclair (1791), p.420 (footnotes) granted a charter in 1617; \\"William Watson of Haddo, bailie of the burgh of Rattray, superior\\" [of Rattray] granted a charter in 1675 and \\"Charles\\".. [Hay, 13th] \\"Earl of Erroll, superior of the lands of Rattray\\" granted a charter in 1711. The destruction of the stone castle and the nearby village of Rattray, is said by \\"a tradition\\" to have happened during the great storm of 1720 which cut off Strathbeg Bay. It is believed that the castle was \\"blown over with sand one Sunday evening while the\\" inhabitants, \\"a godless crew\\". \\"were engaged in playing cards\\". \\"on the Sabbath, [when] they were buried alive.\\" Another story tells that the site was \\"buried because of the plague.\\" however there is no date or record of which plague and it is a very unlikely account.  1720AD(approx) - 1988  Today there is not much to be seen at the site as the remains have \\"for a long period [been] covered with a deep soil, and now- the swords of the warlike house beaten literally into ploughshares\\".Fraser (1859), p.131 In c.1730, a dig on the south-east \\"side of the Castle-hill\\"... \\"found a great number of stones, supposed to belong to the kitchen of the castle, as\\"... \\"workmen found very large hearth-stones covered with ashes.\\"Sinclair (1791), p.419 (footnotes) Items recovered include; \\"a quantity of regularly- laid stones were removed c.1734 and some silver coins\\" as well as two kiln stands found in 1829 (today held in Marischal Museum, Aberdeen). In 1740 \\"a man who drove his spade through the panel of a door was immediately suffocated\\" having got caught in the sand and at an unknown date, a \\"well-made causeway was discovered at the foot of the mound under which the Castle is said to be buried.\\"  1985-1989 Excavations  Thorough excavations at Castlehill in 1985-1989 revealed the remains of the stone castle and traces of the previous timber one. Traces of the stone castle, revealed a \\"perimeter wall\\".. and \\"two mural buildings\\". It also ascertained that the later stone castle was approximately \\"20m by 6.5 m\\" and \\"divided into three parts, a central room, and two smaller end rooms\\". It likely supported more than one storey, due to the \\"indication of a possible forestair\\"... and \\"the wall thickness.\\" The results of this excavation can be found in the Journal article (available free from the link in journal citation below) \\"Excavations at Rattray, Aberdeenshire. A Scottish deserted burgh\\" by \\"Murray & Murray\\" and forms the most complete modern and peer-reviewed academic account of the Castle of Rattray available to historians and archaeologists today.  1989 - present  Aberdeen City Council roday holds various artifacts from Rattray and the Castlehill site and has previously held a temporary display of artifacts at James Dun's House in Aberdeen.

A key subplot is the arrival of Neil's twin nephew and niece Simon and Maud, whose alcoholic mother and errant father have virtually abandoned them. With Hannah unwilling to allow the children to stay with her and her husband, they are unofficially adopted by Cathy's parents, Lizzie and Muttie, who live in a far less affluent part of town, but show the children real love for the first time. The twins' older brother Walter reappears in their lives periodically, usually causing trouble, including robbing the Scarlet Feather premises. When the insurance company suspects an inside job, Cathy and Tom are potentially ruined. The pair's battle for survival, and its impact on their respective relationships, is the key theme for the second half of the novel.

They moved to Hartford, then Philadelphia, and eventually in New York City. Together, they had ten children, two of whom died in infancy. Their children included: * Oliver Bronson, who died in infancy * Maria Bronson, who also died in infancy * Maria Bronson (1793–1851), who married Col. James Boyles Murray (1789–1866), the son of wealthy English born merchant John Murray and grandson of Sir James Murray, Lord Philiphaugh. * Harriet Bronson (1798–1886) * Caroline Bronson (1798–1853), who married Dr. Marinus Willett (1801–1840), son of Marinus Willett * Oliver Bronson (1799–1875), also a doctor who married Joanna Donaldson (1806–1876) in 1833. * Arthur Bronson (1801–1844), who married Ann Eliza Bailey (d. 1878), a daughter of Theodorus Bailey, a United States Senator from New York. * Frederic Bronson Sr. (1802–1868), who married Charlotte Brinckerhoff (1818–1861), a granddaughter and heir of Robert Troup, in 1838. * Mary Bronson (b. 1806) * Ann Bronson (b. 1810) Bronson died on May 19, 1838, at Greenfield Hill. Residence In 1796, Bronson purchased the home of Timothy Dwight, called \\"Verna\\" in Greenfield Hill. Their country home later became Fairfield Country Day School. He is credited with planting the first dogwood trees along Bronson Road where today there is a yearly Dogwood Festival. Descendants Through his daughter Caroline, he was the grandfather of Harriet Bronson Willett (1839–1911), who married Charles Burrall Hoffman (1821–1892), the son of Ogden Hoffman and brother of Ogden Hoffman, Jr., in 1860.

Through his son Frederic, he was the grandfather of Frederic Bronson (1851–1900), who married Sarah Gracie King (1850–1931). She was the daughter of Archibald Gracie King (1821–1897) and Elizabeth Denning (née Duer) King (1821–1900), and the granddaughter of U.S. Representative James Gore King and William Alexander Duer.

James Chuma and Abdullah Susi James Chuma and Abdullah Susi James Chuma and Abdullah Susi were people from central Africa who attended to and accompanied the explorer David Livingstone. Status James Chuma and Abdullah Susi came to attention after their employer Livingstone died at Chitambo's village (in modern-day Zambia). They decided to carry his body all the way to Bagamoyo (on the coast of modern-day Tanzania) where it was handed over to the British authorities and transported to London for burial. Background Chuma was only a boy when David Livingstone and Bishop Charles MacKenzie freed him from slavers in 1861, when he was around 11 years old.David Livingstone and Horace Waller (ed.): The Last Journals of David Livingstone in Central Africa from 1865 to his Death. Two Volumes. John Murray, London, 1874. From that day Livingstone became his only \\"family\\". Susi joined Livingstone at Chupanga in present-day Mozambique when he was employed to cut wood on Livingstone's \\"Second Journey\\". He accompanied Chuma on their epic march to return Livingstone's body, and accompanied Livingstone's remains to England. He afterwards served in mission work in the Nyassa country. Both Chuma and Susi were presented with a Royal Geographical Society medal on 22 June 1874.  James Chuma  James Chuma (also written as Juma), was born to Chimilengo, who was a fisherman by profession. He was from the Yao people, and probably came from present day Mozambique or Malawi. He was baptised as James Chuma on 10 December 1865 by John Wilson, with David Livingstone present. Chuma accompanied Joseph Thomson on the Royal Geographical Society’s 1878-80 East African Expedition. He married in 1874, a year after the death of Livingstone. He worked with UMCA from 1875 to 1878 Chuma died towards the end of 1882 of tuberculosis.  Abdullah Susi  Abdullah Susi met Livingstone in 1863 when he was employed to help build the Lady Nyasa; he then sailed to Bombay where he was left by Livingstone and enrolled in Dr Wilson's Free State College. When Livingstone returned he recruited Susi as a porter for his last journey in 1866-74 to find the source of the Nile. It was Susi who first noticed the approach of Henry Stanley, when he heard the shots signalling their approach he ran to Stanley, who says > \\"Suddenly a man - a black man - at my elbow shouts in English, 'How do you > do, sir?' 'Hello! Who the deuce are you?' 'I am the servant of Dr > Livingstone', he says; but before I can ask any more questions he is running > like a madman towards the town\\" When Livingstone died in 1873 Susi, Chuma and others of the party debated what to do with the body - arrangements were made for drying and embalming the body after removing the heart for burial under a mvula tree, then undertook the long journey to the coast to return the embalmed body to the UK. Although Susi and Chuma did not travel with the body from Africa or attend the funeral they were invited by James Young later in 1874 to come to Britain with a view to helping Horace Waller to edit Livingstone's last journals for publication. While in the UK they stayed at Newstead Abbey, home of Livingstone's friend William Webb. They returned to Africa in October the same year. Back in Africa Susi went on to take part in further expeditions including the one led by Stanley in 1879-82. Originally Muslim, Susi was baptised as a Christian on 23 August 1886 under the name David. He married Mochosi and died 5 May 1891 in Zanzibar. Like the other followers who accompanied Livingstone on the last journey and carried his body to the coast, Susi was awarded a medal by the Royal Geographical Society in 1874.

The group's roster has been the same since its inception in 1996. Imiz members include rapper Dimitris Mentzelos (Greek: Δημήτρης Μεντζέλος), Mithridatis (born Mithridatis Hatzihatzoglou; Greek: Μιθριδάτης Χατζηχατζόγλου) and DJ Pritanis (born Kostas Kostakos; Greek: Κώστας Κωστάκος). They are widely credited for the establishment of hip-hop within Greek music show business. Name Ημισκούμπρια has been translated as semi-mackerels. Σκουμπρί is the Greek word for the fish mackerel (cmpr Scombridae) and is sometimes used in slang for elusive persons. The first element ημι- is analogous to the formal prefix \\"semi-\\" (in contrast to the colloquial μισό \\"half\\"). Hence the name refers to half-elusive guys. The combination of these two elements is used mainly for comedic effect rather than being meaningful.

He was born in Tibbermore, Perthshire, Scotland in 1890, the son of Robert Hay, and apprenticed as a cabinet-maker in Perth. In 1831, he came with his parents to York (later Toronto); his parents died of cholera shortly after arriving. In 1835, he became partners with John Jacques in a cabinet-making business. By 1850, their company was the leading manufacturer of furniture in the country. They soon adopted the use of steam-powered machinery. The company established a branch plant and sawmill in New Lowell in Simcoe County in 1854. Hay helped establish the Toronto, Simcoe and Lake Huron Union Railway which passed through New Lowell. The company also produced other wooden items, such as clothespins, and supplied timber for railway construction. Jacques retired from the business in 1870. Hay also helped found the St Lawrence Bank in 1872, raised livestock near New Lowell in partnership with his nephew Robert Paton, was a director of the Credit Valley Railway and took part in land speculation in the North-West Territories. He married Mary Dunlop in 1847 and had eight children. The furniture business was dissolved in 1885. He died in Toronto in 1890.

History Offenham was founded as a monastic grange and medieval deer park by the Benedictine Abbots of Evesham Abbey in the 13th century, the old grange stood where Court Farm now stands. The grange was established to enclose the large flocks of sheep needed by the Abbots to trade wool with Flanders. During the Dissolution of the Monasteries the grange became crown property and Henry VIII granted both Offenham and Evesham to Philip Hoby, one of his English Ambassadors. The grange and park later became the property of the Hazelwood family until the mid-18th century when it was sub-divided, by this time the village had formed an adequate farming and market gardening community.History of Offenham Retrieved 1 August 2009 Maypole Offenham Maypole Offenham village is noted for its 64 ft maypole, the tallest of only six permanent maypoles remaining in England.

Grupo Desportivo da Companhia Têxtil do Punguè and Textáfrica do Chimoio are examples of two works teams which were the teams of two textile companies. In addition, two major teams of the railway network achieved also notoriety – the Clube Ferroviário de Maputo and the Clube Ferroviário da Beira. Other former and current works teams in Africa include Arab Contractors SC of Egypt (also a sporting club) and AS Police (Benin). Horseed FC is based in Horseed, Somalia. Seven times champion of the Somalia League, it is a former army team. Other works teams that have played in the Somali football leagues include Banaadir Telecom, Ports Authority, and Somali Police. Asia Works teams are common in Japan, with several J-League clubs starting life as such (e.g., Yokohama F. Marinos, who were originally Nissan F.C.). Modern examples include Honda F.C., Mitsubishi Motors Mizushima, F.C. Tokyo (formerly Tokyo Gas), and Sagawa Printing. The highest league Japanese works teams can compete in is the Japan Football League, the de facto national fourth division; the J. League specifically bars works teams from its ranks unless they professionalize and adopt the community they play in as a source of fan support. Current and former works teams in South Korea include Busan Transportation Corporation FC, Gyeongju Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power FC, Ulsan Hyundai Mipo Dolphin FC, and Hanil Bank FC.

The Portuguese conglomerate Companhia União Fabril (CUF) had also its own sports club, founded as a true works team in 1937. It was located in the Lisbon's industrial suburb of Barreiro, and was called Grupo Desportivo da CUF. The club, which was a major contender in the main Portuguese Football Championship, was disbanded and replaced by G.D. Fabril due to a military coup in 1974. Several professional football clubs in the United Kingdom were also formed as works teams, including Manchester United (the team of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway depot at Newton Heath); Arsenal (formed as Dial Square in 1886 by workers at the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich); West Ham United (formerly Thames Ironworks); Coventry City, founded by workers of the Singer bicycle company; and the Scottish team Livingston (formerly Ferranti Thistle).

Fudbalski klub Željezničar (English: Football Club Željezničar) is a Bosnian professional football club based in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. The name Željezničar means \\"railway worker\\", given because it was established by a group of railway workers. More clubs in former Yugoslavia were formed by Yugoslav Railways employees, for instance, Serbian club ŽAK Subotica (Železničarski atletski klub Subotica, translation Railways athletic club Subotica) was a club formed and backed throughout its existence by the railways company. It was dissolved in 1945. In its place the new socialist authorities which replaced the monarchy in Yugoslavia formed FK Spartak Subotica which kept tight links with the railways company.Otkud ime \\"Plavi golubovi\\" i BLUE MARINES at gradsubotica.co.rs, 9 January 2011, retirved 4 March 2016 Željezničar Sarajevo, ŽAK Subotica and Spartak Subotica are the railways-backed clubs with best performances in the league, but besides these there were many others such as ŽAK Kikinda, Železničar Belgrade, Železničar Smederevo, Železničar Lajkovac, Železničar Niš, in Serbia, and Željezničar Doboj in Bosnia. In other parts of Yugoslavia there are other cases, in Macedonia, FK Rabotnički became owned in 1949 by the labour union of the railways company.ИСТОРИЈА section: Возобновување (1945–1949), at FK Rabotnički official website, Retrieved 4 March 2016 The link between the club and the railways was kept ever since with their followers even nowadays are known as Železničari and the railways simbol is part of club's logo. In Slovenia the railways had one club in each one of the two main Slovenian cites, NK Železničar Maribor and NK Železničar Ljubljana. In relation with railways, Serbian club GFK Jasenica 1911 became known during the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s as FK Mladost GOŠA because at that period the club was backed by the GOŠA, a former train wagons factory from Smederevska Palanka. Other cases in Yugoslavia include HNK Borovo, which was formed in 1933 as SK BATA Borovo. The club was formed as the promotional team for the Bata Shoes factory in Borovo and it was founded by the BATA company founder, Tomáš Baťa himself.Milorad Sijić: \\"Football in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia\\", pag. 172 The company had already earlier in 1922 became owner of the Czech club FC Zlín which was known between 1924 and 1948 as SK Bata Zlin.Historie at FC Fastav Zlín official website, Retrieved 4 March 2016 The best well known success story of a company and football club connection in Yugoslavia was the one of FK Zemun. Zemun, a city just in the outskirts of capital Belgrade, was known for many home-born notable players and some more or less successful football clubs ever since first half of the 1920s. SK Sparta Zemun played in the Yugoslav First League still in the 1930s. However, two decades after the end of the Second World War, the city had just a big number of small lower- leagues clubs. At that time Zemun was also home of Galenika a.d., a leading pharmaceutical company in Yugoslavia and one of the major of all South-Eastern Europe. The company owned a small club, FK Galenika, however by the late 1960s they decided to play a bigger role in football. FK Jedinstvo Zemun was at time the leading club in the city. In 1962 they achieved promotion to the Yugoslav Second League but they managed to stay at that level just two seasons. In 1969 they were playing third level, the Serbian Republic League, and were struggling financially. It was then that Galenika decided to take over the club and by merging it with its own minor club they formed FK Galenika Zemun. The company injected resources and backed the club financially, and the results immediately stated to show up. Right in the first season the club managed promotion back to the Yugoslav Second League where they will become among the strongest teams in the following decade. After several failed attempts Galenika Zemun achieved promotion to the Yugoslav First League in 1982 and that same year they reached the semi-finals of the Yugoslav Cup. Playing in the Yugoslav top level, during the 1980s the club played side-by- side with the big ones such as Red Star, Partizan Belgrade, Hajduk Split or Dinamo Zagreb, and Yugoslav football fans all became well aware of the name FK Galenika Zemun. Later, by the early 1990s the wars and the break-up of Yugoslavia started, Galenika suffered the financially asphyxiating consequences of the economic sanctions imposed to Serbia. The company had to drop its backing to the club and the club dropped the company name and became known just as FK Zemun. They managed to survive for some time during the 1990s in the First League of FR Yugoslavia, however the results were being worse each year, and by the turn of the millennium FK Zemun was relegated to the lower-leagues with just few occasional but flashy and inconsistent comebacks. Easy to conclude how the presence of Galenika in the club was fundamental for them to archive results and stability and without them Zemun supporters can only remember nostalgically the period when the club had its golden era thanks to the perfect wedding with a major local pharmaceutical company. One of those minor clubs that emerged in Zemun was SK Naša Krila Zemun (Naša Krila means Our Wings), which existed only for three years between 1947 and 1950, and was formed and owned by the Yugoslav Air Force. The club managed to archive impressive record for such a shot existence, making its presence in two seasons in the Yugoslav First League and reaching the Yugoslav Cup final in 1947 and 1949. While the Yugoslav Air Force created its club in Serbia in Zemun, a suburb of the capital Belgrade, the Yugoslav Navy created their club in Croatia, in the major Yugoslav port, Split, and named it NK Mornar Split. However, just as Naša Krila, the club lived shortly, it was formed in 1946 and disbanded two years later. and by the 1960s a new club, which was formed by a merger of a number of smaller ones, was making its way to the highlights of Yugoslav football. Serbian club FK Smederevo 1924 was founded as a local iron factory SARTID football team. The club will be known by the company name since its foundation, in 1924, until 1944 when it became nationalized. In 1992 it will restore the name Sartid just as the club ownership returned to the Sartid metallurgical company and will remain till 2004, the year the company, by then now owned by U.S. Steel, left the direction of the club. There are many other cases in Serbia, specially among medium-size clubs and their main local companies, such as FK Čukarički (known as Čukarički Sartid between 2001 and 2011 when it was owned by Stankom company), FK Hajduk Kula (known as FK Hajduk Rodić during the period it was backed by the Rodić company), FK Javor Ivanjica (known since summer 2014 as FK Javor Matis due to its backing from local Matis company), FK Sloboda Užice (known as FK Sloboda Point Sevojno after its merger with FK Sevojno in 2010 and backing from Point company), ČSK Čelarevo (also known as ČSK Pivara, owned and closely related throughout its history by beer manufacturer Pivara Čelarevo), FK Mladost Apatin (formed by the owner of a local clothing factory Tri Zvezde, it was named since its foundation in 1924 till 1950 as SK Tri Zvezde and during that time most of the players of the squad were also employees at the factoryFudbal u Kraljevini Jugoslaviji, Sijić, p. 173). FC Sheriff Tiraspol is based in the capital of Transnistria, was founded by the Sheriff security company in 1997. Most of the Ukrainian Premier League clubs in Ukraine trace their roots to factory teams among several there is FC Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk that was originally formed as factory team of Bryanka Factory (today Dnipropetrovsk Metallurgical Plant). FC Shakhtar Horlivka traces its roots to the Football Association of the Gorlovka Artillery Works (FOGAZ). In times of the Soviet Union until the 1960s in Kiev was a sports club of Kiev Arsenal factory, SC Arsenal Kiev, which fielded number of teams in various sports such as association football, hockey, others. In 2001 there was an attempt to revive the club by the Kiev city authorities (see FC Arsenal Kiev). FC Zirka Kropyvnytskyi was originally formed by the Elvorti Factory personnel and after the Communist revolution it was renamed along with the factory. FC Zorya Luhansk was formed at the October Revolution Locomotive Factory (today Luhanskteplovoz). FC Metalist Kharkiv was formed at the Kharkiv Locomotive Factory (today Malyshev Factory). There also was a factory team of the Donetsk Steel Works (see FC Metalurh Donetsk). At the KryvbasOre (today Kryvyi Rih Iron Ore Association) were created such teams like FC Hirnyk Kryvyi Rih and FC Kryvbas Kryvyi Rih. FC Metalurh Zaporizhia traces its roots to the team of Zaporizhstal. FC Torpedo Zaporizhia traces its roots to the team of ZAZ car factory. From Romania we have Rapid Bucharest that it was founded in 1923 by a group workers of the Grivița workshops under the name of Asociația culturală și sportivă CFR (\\"CFR Cultural and Sports Association\\"). North America Bethlehem Steel F.C., which holds a record number of U.S. Open Cup wins, was the factory team of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation in Pennsylvania. One of the most popular teams in Mexico, Cruz Azul, is a works team owned by Cooperativa La Cruz Azul S.C.L., an industrial cement company. The team was formed on 22 May 1927 by some of the company's workers. South America Several Argentinian clubs began life as the works teams of British-owned railway companies, including Rosario Central, Talleres de Córdoba, Ferro Carril Oeste, Club Ferrocarril Midland and Club Atlético Central Córdoba. Club Deportivo Mandiyú, also referred as Mandiyú is an Argentine football club, based in Corrientes, in the Province of the same name. The club was founded under the name \\"Club Deportivo Tipoiti\\" on 14 December 1952, by a group of textile workers from the Tipoiti textile factory in Corrientes, Argentina. Because the Argentine Football Association did not accept commercial company names, the club had to change its name to \\"Club Deportivo Mandiyú\\", which means cotton in the indigenous language of Guaraní. In Brazil, clubs that were born as works teams include São Paulo Railway (now Nacional), Cotonifício Rodolfo Crespi (now Juventus), Sport Club Corinthians Paulista (also a sporting club, formed by railway workers), and Bangu. Uruguay has one of the best known clubs that began as a works team: Central Uruguay Railway Cricket Club, or just CURCC, which was the basis for the later foundation of Peñarol, one of the top two clubs in that country. Arguably, Club Universidad de Chile is a works team, having been formed by university students before becoming part of the university's brand until 1980. (A number of university teams around the world play professionally, including University of Pretoria F.C. in South Africa; FC Academia Chișinău in Moldova; Cardiff Metropolitan University F.C. in Wales (once called Inter CableTel A.F.C.); and Club Universidad de Guadalajara in Mexico.) In Ecuador, a perfect example of a works team is CS Emelec, which was founded by the Empresa Eléctrica del Ecuador, Guayaquil's first electric company. For several decades, Emelec's players and directors were employees in the company, though such involvement decreased gradually until the company eventually folded in the 2000s (decade), the club being de facto autonomous for decades before. Sociedad Deportiva Aucas is another important works team in Ecuador. Historically the most popular team in Quito, Aucas was founded and initially integrated and financed by employees of Royal Dutch Shell. They named the club after the Huaorani tribes that they encountered while prospecting for oil in the Ecuadorian Amazonian jungles. Club Alianza Lima was founded as Sport Alianza in 1901 by workers in the Alianza Racing Horse Stud, then property of two-time President of Peru Augusto B. Leguía.  Rugby union In rugby union, too has a works team tradition going back many decades, although the clubs have declined post professionalism in heartland countries, it has not been completely extinguished. As late as 1988 the Wales Captain played his club rugby for South Wales Police. As of 2017, Tata Steel play in the Second Flight of the WRU Club Pyramid. The British Army still plays occasional matches against Clubs, and has won the Middlesex Sevens in the 2000s. Currently the strongest works teams are in Asia. The Top League in Japan features teams such as Suntory Sungoliath, Toyota Verblitz and IBM Big Blue. Samsung has a team in the Korean league.  American football  Works teams were common in the early days of professional football. The Columbus Panhandles were a famous works team; it consisted of Pennsylvania Railroad employees, including the famed Nesser Brothers, and eventually became a charter member of the National Football League. The National Public Safety Football League is a modern-day example of a league of works teams, with each team in the league consisting of employees of a public department (usually police or fire) in a given city.

He played college football for the Syracuse Orangemen. Early years Flannery attended Pottsville High School, where he played defensive tackle and center. As a senior, he was named defensive MVP of Pennsylvania’s Big 33 and won the state heavyweight wrestling championship. He accepted a football scholarship from Syracuse University. As a redshirt freshman with the Orangemen, he became the starter at left guard for 10 games. As a sophomore, he was named the starting center, where he would remain the rest of his college career. He earned All-American honors as a senior. In 1999, he was named to the Syracuse University's All-Century team. Professional career Houston Oilers Flannery was selected by the Houston Oilers in the second round (44th overall) of the 1991 NFL Draft. Because future hall of famer Bruce Matthews was the starting center at the time, he was moved to right guard where he started the first 9 games of the season until suffering a knee sprain and playing mainly on special teams after that. He was named to the NFL All- Rookie team. In 1992, he appeared in 15 games and started 2 at left guard. He injured his left knee returning a short kickoff in the ninth game against the Cleveland Browns. He missed the next game and needed arthroscopic surgery on the knee during the off-season. In 1993, he was lost for the season with a torn left anterior cruciate ligament he suffered in training camp on July 31. In 1994, he was the regular starter at left guard, making it the first time in his career he started all 16 games. In 1995, he had surgery during training camp to repair the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee, which he originally injured in 1993. He was waived injured on August 8. Green Bay Packers On August 10, 1995, he signed a contract with the Green Bay Packers, but it was invalidated after he failed a physical because of his previous knee injury. Dallas Cowboys On October 3, 1996, he was signed 4 weeks into the season as a free agent by the Dallas Cowboys. He spent the season rehabbing his left knee, which was surgically repaired the previous year. He was declared inactive for 10 games, until seeing his first action in the fourth quarter of the season finale against the Washington Redskins. In 1997, he competed with Clay Shiver for the starting center position that was left open with the release of Ray Donaldson, but he ended up as the backup and started 4 games at left guard. St. Louis Rams On April 1st, 1998, he was signed as a free agent by the St. Louis Rams and was named the starter at center. The next year, he was placed on the injured reserve list, in a season the team went on to win Super Bowl XXXIV. He wasn't re-signed after the season.

The Russian Empire had only a few bilateral copyright treaties with other nations were concluded; these treaties moreover were weak and of short duration. The treaties from Imperial times had all expired by the time of the Russian Revolution. After the October Revolution, the Soviet Union had no international copyright relations until 1967, when a first treaty with Hungary was concluded. In 1973, the USSR then joined the Universal Copyright Convention (UCC), establishing copyright relations with Western countries. More bilateral treaties followed, including two with Western countries (Austria in 1981 and Sweden in 1986), until the government announced its intention to join the Berne Convention in 1989. The USSR was dissolved before that plan could be realized. The Russian Federation acceded to the Berne Convention in 1994; the treaty entered in force in Russia on March 13, 1995. Imperial Russia International copyright treaties International copyright is based on national treatment: signatory countries of a treaty are obliged to grant copyright on foreign works according to their own national laws.Pilch 2004, p. 83. In the field of \\"classic\\" copyright (or author's rights), three main treaties exist: *The Berne Convention (BC) dates to 1886 and was amended several times. It defined the minimal rights of those who produced creative scientific, literary, and artistic works, prescribing a general minimum duration of copyright of 50 years p.m.a.Berne Convention, articles 2 and 7. *The Universal Copyright Convention (UCC) was adopted in 1952 (and revised in 1971) as a less stringent alternative to the BC for countries who considered the BC too demanding. If a country signed both the UCC and the BC, the BC had precedence in dealings with other BC countries.Lewinski p. 1. *The WIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT) of 1996 became effective in 2002. It was an extension of the BC covering computer programs and databases.WIPO: Summary of the WIPO Copyright Treaty. URL last accessed 2007-01-25. In the field of neighbouring rights, two important treaties are: *The Rome Convention of 1961 was the equivalent to the BC for performers, phonogram producers, and broadcasting institutions.WIPO: Summary of the Rome Convention.

First international copyright treaties were concluded in Spring 1861 with France and in July 1862 with Belgium. Both treaties provided for reciprocal copyright protection, but were limited to literature only; translation rights were not covered, and censorship was explicitly allowed. Both treaties were abrogated in 1887.Elst p. 67. Under Western pressure, new treaties were concluded in 1904 with Germany, in 1905 with France, and in 1906 with Austria- Hungary. After the new copyright law of 1911 was passed, new or renewed treaties were concluded with Germany (1911), France (1911), Belgium (1913/14), and Denmark (1915). All these treaties provided for reciprocal copyright protection and also included the author's translation rights, which were protected for a period of ten years from the original publication of a work.Elst p. 70. These treaties were of short duration only and expired after three to five years.Elst p. 71. Tsarist Russia even planned to join the Berne Convention in the early 20th century, but that was, according to Stoyanovitch, prevented by the outbreak of World War I.Stoyanovitch, K.: Le droit d'auteur dans les rapports entre la France et les pays socialistes, p. 187 in Pichon, R.; Durand-Auzias, R.: Librairie générale de droit et de jurisprudence; Paris 1959. USSR :See also Accession of the USSR to the UCC in 1973 After the October Revolution, the Soviet Union initially had no international copyright relations at all.Elst p. 80. During the period of the New Economic Policy (NEP), the Soviet regime unsuccessfully tried to conclude new bilateral copyright treaties with Great Britain, Germany, and Italy.Elst p. 77. After these failed attempts, the USSR maintained an isolationist policy in copyright matters until the late 1960s. A first bilateral copyright treaty with Hungary became effective on November 17, 1967, and on October 8, 1971, a second treaty with Bulgaria followed. Both treaties provided for reciprocal copyright protection with a general term of 15 years p.m.a. and also explicitly defined reciprocity for free uses.Elst p. 80, pointing out that Soviet works could be freely translated in Bulgaria under this reciprocity because of the freedom of translation granted by Soviet law.Newcity p. 137ff, who explains that the treaty with Hungary was limited to citizens of both countries residing in these countries, works of citizens residing abroad were not covered. Newcity also explains that the reciprocity for free uses worked to the disadvantage of Soviet authors because Soviet law had broader free uses, and Soviet authors thus did not receive royalties they otherwise would have received under Hungarian or Bulgarian law. On February 27, 1973, the Soviet Union deposited with the UNESCO its declaration of accession to the Geneva version of 1952 of the Universal Copyright Convention (UCC).UNESCO: Universal Copyright Convention adopted at Geneva in 1952 and annexed Protocols 1, 2 and 3: State of ratifications, acceptances and accessions up to 1 January 2000. , note 29. URL last accessed 2006-11-02. Three months later, on May 27, 1973, the UCC entered in force with respect to the USSR, establishing copyright relations with Western countries.Elst p. 81. The USSR timed its accession to the UCC to occur before the 1971 Paris version of the UCC entered in force.Elst, p. 82, footnote 147. Once the Paris version had become effective, accessions to the earlier Geneva version were no longer possible. The USSR would then have been forced to implement the somewhat stronger provisions of the 1971 Paris version, which in particular explicitly recognized an author's exclusive rights to reproduction, performance, and broadcast of a work. Such neighbouring rights did not exist in Soviet law. With the accession of the Soviet Union to the UCC, Soviet works published on or after May 27, 1973 became eligible to copyright in all other signatory countries of the UCC. Conversely, foreign works became copyrighted in the Soviet Union by virtue of the UCC if they were published on or after May 27, 1973 and the publication occurred in a UCC country or the author was a citizen of a UCC country.Elst p. 83. There were initially fears in the West that the Soviet authorities could misuse the provisions of the UCC to censor undesirable works abroad: the regime could compulsorily purchase the copyright on such works without the authors' consent and then sue in foreign courts against the publication of Soviet works abroad, since the copyright would be owned by the state.Newcity p. 151ff. However, this did not occur. Evidently, the Soviet authorities considered the measures provided by its other laws--in particular articles 70 and 190(1) of the RSFSR Criminal Code on anti-Soviet agitationElst, p. 50-51\\\\. Article 190(1) was introduced in 1966 in the Criminal Code of the RSFSR, after the trial against Andrei Sinyavsky and Yuli Daniel, in which the prosecution had found it difficult to prove the intent to do harm that was required by article 70. The new article 190(1) made the \\"dissemination of known falsehoods that defame the Soviet political and social system\\" a criminal offense and didn't stipulate any intention at all. Similar provisions existed in the other republics' laws.--sufficient to deal with dissidents without needing to resort to actions based on the copyright law. Furthermore, such actions would have badly damaged the prestige of the USSR abroad, and it was doubtful whether foreign countries would have honored such nationalizations.Elst p. 84, pointing out that French courts denied any effect in France of the nationalizations in 1919 of the works of 17 Russian composers. The U.S. included in its Copyright law of 1976 an article 201(e) that explicitly invalidated all involuntary transfers of copyright. This provision was included in the U.S. Copyright Act of 1976 precisely to prevent attempts of the Soviet government to employ the UCC to censor dissidents' works in the U.S.Nimmer, M.B.; Nimmer, D.: Nimmer on Copyright, §10.04 at 10-56.5. On November 6, 1978, 17 U.S.C. 201(e) was amended by adding \\"except as provided under title 11\\". Title 11 of the United States Code covers bankruptcy.-- although no such attempts had occurred yet and didn't occur afterwards.Elst p. 85. Despite having joined the UCC, the Soviet Union continued its policy of bilateral agreements. New treaties with the German Democratic Republic (effective November 21, 1973), Poland (October 4, 1974), and Czechoslovakia (March 18, 1975) were concluded. The 1967 treaty with Hungary had already been prolonged in 1971 and was again renewed in 1977, the treaty with Bulgaria was renewed in 1975. The treaties with Hungary and Czechoslovakia also included a provision for the protection of the moral rights \\"without limitation in time\\".Elst p. 606. In 1981, the first bilateral treaty with a Western country was signed: the copyright treaty with Austria entered in force on December 16, 1981.Dittrich pp. 760-768.Elst p. 89f. On May 30, 1985, a treaty with Cuba followed,Elst p. 495. and in 1986 the second treaty with a Western country was concluded with Sweden.Elst p. 367, pointing out that the treaty with Sweden explicitly also covered photographic works and also included the protection of the moral rights. All these post-UCC treaties went beyond the provisions of the UCC because they were applied retroactivelyElst p. 90. and explicitly applied also to works published before the USSR had joined the UCC and that were still copyrighted in their source country in 1973.Gavrilov, E. P.: Lettre de l'U.R.S.S.: Evolution récente du droit d'auteur soviétique, pp. 226-246 in Le Droit d'Auteur 1987. (The treaty with Austria was amended to cover such pre-1973 works in 1989.Elst p. 367.) On April 19, 1989, another copyright treaty with Madagascar was concluded.Gavrilov, E. P.: Lettre de l'U.R.S.S.: Evolution récente du droit d'auteur soviétique, pp. 364-380 in Le Droit d'Auteur 1990. The treaty with the German Democratic Republic was rescinded by the USSR on June 2, 1991, following confusions about its continued applicability after the German reunification. On October 20, 1988, the USSR acceded to the Brussels Convention about measures against the unauthorized (re-)distribution of satellite transmissions. The treaty became effective for Russia from January 20, 1989 on.WIPO: Brussels Convention - Contracting Parties: Details - Russian Federation . URL last accessed 2007-01-24. Also in 1989, the Soviet government announced its intention to join the Berne Convention, but the USSR was dissolved before that plan could be realized. The changing economy in the Soviet Union led to the conclusion of a trade treaty between the USSR and the United States, signed by presidents Gorbachev and Bush on June 1, 1990. In this treaty, the U.S. imposed a number of measures in the field of intellectual property in exchange for granting the USSR most- favoured-nation status.Elst p. 349. The treaty obliged the USSR to accede to the Berne Convention and to implement in its law a neighbouring rights scheme similar to what the Rome Convention laid down.Elst p. 350. The USSR agreed in the treaty to take substantive steps to amend its legislation in that sense by 1991.Elst p. 351. The treaty was ratified by the U.S. on December 23, 1991. The Soviet side no longer could do so, but the Russian Federation did so on June 12, 1992.The U.S. concluded similar agreements with the other successor states of the USSR, see Circular 38a of the U.S. Copyright Office. Russian Federation When the Soviet Union was dissolved, Russia as the largest successor state adopted all international obligations of the former USSR, including its membership to the UCC.Elst p. 485. Consequently, Russia was henceforth considered a member of the UCC (in the 1952 Geneva text) since the date of the adherence of the USSR to that treaty, i.e., since May 27, 1973. The membership of the USSR in the Brussels Convention was equally continued by the Russian Federation as from December 25, 1991. On June 25, 1993, Russia and Armenia signed a treaty on the mutual protection of copyrights.Elst p. 388.Elst p. 496. To clarify the copyright situation amongst the states that had made up the former Soviet Union, the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) nations agreed on a cooperation agreement in the field of copyrights on September 24, 1993. This \\"Moscow agreement\\" declared that all signatory countries considered themselves bound by the UCC as of the date the USSR had joined and would confirm this state with the UNESCO, which administered the UCC.Elst p. 486\\\\. Both the UNESCO and the U.S. Copyright Office consider all CIS nations to be UCC (1952) members as of May 27, 1973. See U.S. Copyright Office, Circular 38a. The treaty also defined that the treaty states would apply the UCC amongst themselves, also for works published before May 27, 1973 if those works had been copyrighted before this date according to the national laws of the successor states. This provision was subject to the rule of the shorter term. The intent of the Moscow agreement was to avoid that older Soviet works became copyrighted in only some of the successor states, but would become part of the public domain in some of the others.Elst p. 487. The 1993 Moscow agreement entered in force in Russia on May 6, 1995.Lyapin & Paliashvili. During the same year, Russia and Switzerland concluded a trade agreement in which they granted each other most-favoured-nation status concerning intellectual property rights, i.e., they agreed to grant the other treaty partner automatically and without conditions any trade advantage they'd grant a third country.Elst p. 344. This treaty entered in force on July 1, 1995.Elst p. 353f. In a comprehensive trade treaty with the European Union that was signed on June 24, 1994, Russia granted this most-favoured-nation status also to the EU member countries, excepting only trade advantages granted amongst the successor states of the USSR and also those Russia would grant a third country on an effective reciprocal basis.Elst p. 345f. \\"Effective reciprocal basis\\" means advantages granted by Russia to a third country only because this third country granted similar advantages to Russia in a bilateral treaty. Because the ratification of this treaty was delayed as it had to be ratified by all EU members, an interim agreement containing only the provisions on intellectual property and the most-favoured-nation status was signed on July 17, 1995. It entered in force on February 1, 1996.Elst p. 347. On November 3, 1994, the Russian government announced that the country would join three international treaties in the field of copyrights: the 1971 Paris version of the UCC including its annexes, the Geneva Phonograms Convention on unauthorized duplication and parallel import of phonograms, and the Berne Convention.Russian Federation; decree no. 1224 from 1994. The accession documents to all three treaties were deposited on December 9, 1994. The UCC (Paris 1971 version) became effective for Russia on March 9, 1995.UNESCO: Universal Copyright Convention as revised at Paris on 24 July 1971 and annexed Protocols 1 and 2: State of ratifications, acceptances and accessions up to 1 January 2000 . URL last accessed 2006-11-02. The Geneva Convention entered in force with respect to Russia on March 13, 1995 and was not retroactive: it covered only phonograms recorded after that date.Elst p. 494. Berne Convention The Berne Convention also became effective for Russia on March 13, 1995.WIPO: Contracting Parties - Berne Convention - Russian Federation - Details , URL last accessed 2007-01-25. The Berne Convention is retroactive in principle:Elst p. 489. according to its article 18, it applies to all works that are copyrighted in their source country (the country where the first publication of the work occurred) on the day the treaty enters in force with respect to a joining country such as Russia. Article 18(2) adds that if \\"through the expiry of the term of protection which was previously granted, a work has fallen into the public domain of the country where protection is claimed, that work shall not be protected anew.\\"Berne Convention, article 18. Hence works that were copyrighted in Russia on March 13, 1995 became copyrighted in all other Berne Countries on that date.Elst p. 535. Under these provisions, foreign works not formerly copyrighted in Russia should also have become copyrighted in Russia.Elst p. 493. Russian legal scholars had warned of this, and the government feared the impacts on the trade balance with Western countries if Russian publishers would suddenly have to pay royalties for foreign works. In its declaration of accession, Russia therefore made a reservation regarding article 18 of the Berne Convention, stating that the treaty \\"shall not extend to the works which, at the date of entry into force of the said Convention in respect of the Russian Federation, are already in the public domain in its territory.\\"WIPO: Berne Notification 162. For Russian and Soviet work that originated in Russia, this was just a restatement of article 18(1) of the Berne Convention; but as far as foreign works were concerned, this reservation effectively denied the retroactivity of the Berne Convention within Russia. This was of some importance because of the issue of foreign works published before May 27, 1973, when the USSR had joined the UCC. Such works had never been eligible to copyright in the Soviet Union or in Russia. Under §18(2) of the Berne Convention, they should have become copyrighted in 1995 because that article only exempted works that once were copyrighted, but on which that copyright already had expired, which didn't apply to pre-1973 foreign works in Russia. The reservation made by Russia used a slightly different phrasing, just stating that works that were in the public domain in Russia in 1995 would not be reprotected. As pre-1973 foreign works were not copyrighted at all and thus in the public domain in Russia in 1995, such works remained in the public domain in Russia. Russia thus got rather favorable conditions when it joined Berne Convention: Russian and Soviet works became copyrighted retroactively in other Berne countries, but pre-1973 works from those other countries did not become copyrighted in Russia. This Russian interpretation was heavily criticized by Western countries and in particular by the United States. Russian scholars, however, repeatedly (and, in the opinion of Elst, rightly) pointed out that there had been a very prominent precedent:Podshibikhin & Leontiev 2002 explain the argument presented here using the 1995 case of Itar- Tass v. Russian Kurier as an example. After defending the Russian practice, Podshibikhin & Leontiev then express the opinion that the continued application of the non-retroactivity reservation was becoming a problem in Russia's international relations and were better ended. They then explain the necessary modifications of the 1993 law to introduce the copyright restoration as it is prescribed by the Berne Convention. Their proposed modifications coincide with the changes that were indeed made in 2004 by law no. 72-FL. in 1989, when the U.S. had joined the Berne Convention, they also had denied the retroactivity of the treaty.Elst p. 491. From 1989 until 1995, the U.S. only respected the copyrights under the Berne Convention on foreign works from another country that were published on or after the later of that country's adherence date to the Berne Convention and March 1, 1989 (the adherence date of U.S.),WIPO: Contracting Parties: United States of America. URL last accessed 2007-01-23. and on foreign works from a UCC country according to the provisions of the UCC, which meant on works that were published after the later of September 16, 1955 (the date the UCC entered in force for the U.S. and the other initial signatories) and the adherence date of the foreign UCC country.Regnier p. 400ff. In the case of Russian or Soviet works, this meant that until 1996, the U.S. continued to recognize only copyrights on Soviet works published after May 27, 1973.Pilch 2003, p. 83. The U.S. faced harsh critique for its unilateral denouncement of the retroactivity of the Berne Convention defined in article 18(1) BC. Ultimately, the U.S. had to reverse its position on that issue. It implemented the TRIPS agreement (a precondition to becoming a WTO member) in its Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA), which was signed into law on December 8, 1994. The URAA effectively restored the copyright in the U.S. on foreign works on January 1, 1996, if those works were until then not copyrighted in the U.S. because of a failure to meet the U.S. formalities (such as not bearing a copyright notice, or lacking registration with the U.S. Copyright Office) or because of a lack of international treaties between the U.S. and the source country of the work, if the work was still copyrighted in its source country on January 1, 1996.Pilch 2003, p. 84\\\\. The copyright restoration provisions of the URAA are contained in 17 U.S.C. 104A in the copyright law of the U.S.See also Circular 38b of the U.S. Copyright Office. Russian scholars have disputed this retroactivity issue at length. Gavrilov, for instance, who had argued for the Russian reservation to the Berne Convention, kept defending it, while others disagreed.Russian Association of Book Publishers Maggs and Sergeyev, for instance, pointed out in 2000 that the reservation was inadmissible under article 30(1) of the Berne Convention;Maggs & Sergeyev, chapter 7, section E.4. Podshibikhin and Leontiev agreed in 2002.Podshibikhin & Leontiev 2002. The modification of the copyright law through law 72-FL in 2004 refuelled the discussion, because this law added a new paragraph 4 to article 5 of the 1993 copyright law which clearly stated under which conditions foreign works were copyrighted in Russia, using a wording that corresponded in essence to articles 18(1) and 18(2) of the Berne Convention.Law no. 72- of 2004, chapter 1, article 2 (modifying article 5 of the copyright law). Furthermore, copyrights on foreign works were made subject to the rule of the shorter term. Compare also Podshibikhin & Leontiev, who had in 2002 proposed exactly such a modification (albeit without a rule of the shorter term) to end the Russian non-retroactivity reservation. Nevertheless, Gavrilov continued arguing in favour of the non-protection of pre-1973 foreign works, arguing that this was not so much a reservation to the Berne Convention but merely an interpretation, whereas others considered the 2004 amendments to finally do away with this reservation and claimed that law 72-FL restored copyright in Russia on pre-1973 foreign works. According to the Russian representative at the negotiations on Russia's accession to the WTO, law 72-FL indeed was intended to rescind the non-retroactivity reservation, thereby restoring copyrights on pre-1973 foreign works.WTO, Report of the Working Party on the Accession of the Russian Federation to the World Trade Organization;p. 318, paragraph 1242. The Russian copyright law (already before 2004) also considered international treaties self-executing and to take precedence over the Russian law (article 3).Pilch 2004, p. 85. The common practice in Russia nevertheless did not change; pre-1973 foreign works were commonly considered to be uncopyrighted in Russia due to this reservation.Budylin & Osipova, p. 8, still stated in January 2007 that pre-1973 foreign works were uncopyrighted in Russia. Other treaties In 2003, Russia also joined the Rome Convention, the analogue of the Berne Convention for neighbouring rights. The adherence of Russia to the Rome Convention became effective on May 26, 2003.WIPO: Contracting Parties: Russian Federation. URL last accessed 2007-01-23. The Rome convention covered performances, phonograms, and broadcasts. For phonograms, it stipulated that phonograms produced by a national of a contracting state, or fixated in a contracting state, or published in a contracting state were covered, but allowed signatory countries to choose among the latter two (article 5).WIPO: International Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organizations done at Rome on October 26, 1961. URL last accessed 2007-01-23. Russia chose to apply the criteria of nationality and publication, declaring the criterion of fixation as inapplicable in its adherence to the treaty.WIPO: Details of the adherence of the Russian Federation to the Rome Convention . URL last accessed 2007-01-23. The Rome Convention is non-retroactive and applies only to phonograms created after and to performances or broadcasts that occurred after a country jointed the convention (article 20). After part IV of the Civil Code had entered in force on January 1, 2008, the Russian Federation also acceded on November 5, 2008 to the WIPO Copyright Treaty WIPO: WIPO Copyright Treaty, Contracting Parties, Russian Federation .

International copyright The international copyright relations of the Soviet Union and of Russia gave rise to copyright on Soviet works abroad and also to some foreign works becoming copyrighted in the USSR or in Russia. In some cases, Soviet works even became copyrighted in other countries in the absence of any international copyright treaties. Copyright on foreign works in the USSR and in Russia Prior to the accession of the Soviet Union to the UCC, only works by foreign authors that were first published in the USSR and unpublished works of foreign authors that existed in an objective form on the territory of the USSR were eligible to copyright.Newcity p. 53. When the USSR joined the UCC in 1973 and the treaty entered in force with respect to the USSR on May 27, 1973, foreign works first published on or after that date outside of the USSR became copyrighted in the Soviet Union if *the author was a national of any other signatory country of the UCC, irrespective of where this publication occurred, or if *the work was first published in any other UCC country, regardless of the nationality of the author. In addition to the UCC, the bilateral treaties the USSR concluded with several countries, amongst them also two Western countries, made works of nationals of these countries eligible for copyright in the Soviet Union, even works published before May 27, 1973. In the case of Austria, Poland, and Sweden, this even applied to any work first published there, irrespective of the nationality of the author. Since its accession to the Berne Convention in 1995, the following foreign works were copyrighted in Russia: * Soviet works published in the Russian SFSR, as well as works of authors who became citizens of the Russian federation after the demise of the USSR became subject to the copyright law of the Russian Federation of 1993 (and its amendments) due to the strict territoriality of copyright law.Elst p. 485; see also §5 of the 1993 Copyright law, covering works of Russian citizens and works \\"disclosed on the territory of the Russian Federation\\", which coincides with the territory of the former RSFSR. *Soviet works that were first published in one of the other fourteen republics of the USSR and created by authors who did not become nationals of the Russian Federation were subject to the Russian copyright law per the Moscow agreement. * Works by nationals of countries that adhered to the Berne Convention, but not to the UCC, or works published in such a country, became eligible to copyright in Russia if they were published on or after March 13, 1995, the date the Berne Convention became effective with respect to Russia.Gavrilov 1999, comment 6 to article 5. * Works of nationals of UCC countries, or works first published in such a country (regardless of the author's nationality), were subject to copyright in Russia if the works were first published on or after May 27, 1973. Because of the Russian reservation concerning the retroactivity of the Berne Convention, this applied whether or not the UCC country had also signed the Berne Convention. * Pre-1973 works of nationals of one of the countries the USSR or Russia concluded bilateral treaties with were subject to copyright in Russia insofar as these treaties remained effective. This concerned works of nationals of Austria, Armenia, Bulgaria, Cuba, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Madagascar, Poland, Slovakia, and Sweden, regardless of the place of first publication.Elst p. 494f. It also applied generally to works first published in Austria, Poland, or Sweden, regardless of the author's nationality, as the bilateral treaties with these states explicitly stated so. Pre-1973 foreign works of other countries initially were not covered by copyright in Russia. That changed with federal law 72-FL of August 8, 2004, which brought the Russian copyright law in full compliance with the Berne Convention. Since then, foreign works subject to the Berne Convention are copyrighted in Russia if they were copyrighted in the source country when Russia joined the Berne convention (i.e., in 1995). Russia implements the rule of the shorter term: the copyright term of a foreign work in Russia is the shorter of the copyright term in the source country and the normal 70-years p.m.a. accorded by Russian law. This situation remained unchanged with the entry in force of the new Part IV of the Russian Civil Code which included a complete rewrite of the copyright law; article 1256 embodies the amendments from law 72-FL.Law 230- of December 18, 2006; article 1256. Copyright on Soviet and Russian works in other countries Even before the accession of the Soviet Union to the UCC in 1973, some Soviet works were copyrighted in some other countries.Newcity p. 34. One well-known case concerned the actions of the four Soviet composers Shostakovich, Khachaturian, Prokofiev, and Myaskovsky against the movie company 20th Century Fox. 20th Century Fox had published a movie called The Iron Curtain, using music of these four composers as background music and crediting the composers. The four Soviet composers initiated legal actions against the movie company, claiming that the use of their names and music in a movie whose theme was objectionable to them and that was unsympathetic to the Soviet ideologyStandler, quoting from Shostakovich v. 20th Century-Fox, 80 N.Y.S.2d 575, at 578-579. libeled them and violated their civil rights. In the U.S., the courts dismissed these claims in Shostakovich v. Twentieth Century- Fox (80 N.Y.S.2d 575 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1948), affirmed, 87 N.Y.S.2d 430 (N.Y. App. Div. 1949)), in particular because the works of these composers were in the public domain in the U.S. at that time because there were no international treaties relating to copyright between the U.S. and the USSR. The compositions themselves also had not been distorted, so the court found that the composers' moral right to the integrity of the work was not violated. The four plaintiffs also went to court over this issue in France. Up to 1964, the French legislation treated both French authors and foreign authors exactly the same; works of both were granted exactly the same copyright protection.Newcity p. 35. In a lawsuit that was ultimately decided by the French Court of Cassation in 1959,', D. Jur 93 (1960), 1959 J.C.P. II11580 (). \\"\\" was the rights holder in France on these Soviet composer's works. the plaintiffs won: the court ruled that works of foreign authors were entitled to copyright in France, and that the works of these four Soviet composers were thus copyrighted in France. It found their moral rights violated and ordered the film to be confiscated.Gigante 1996 Another way by which Soviet works could become copyrighted outside of the Soviet Union was the smuggling of manuscripts out of the USSR to have the work first published abroad. This practice, known as tamizdat in the Soviet Union, could result in serious repercussions for the authors in the USSR, but was still employed as one of the few ways the governmental censorship could be bypassed. As a side effect, tamizdat works were granted copyright in the foreign country of first publication. If that country was a signatory of the UCC or the Berne Convention, the work was also granted copyright in all other signatories of these treaties, because they both extended copyright to works of citizens of non-member states, if these works were first published in a member state.Newcity p. 36.Elst p. 33. A very famous case of a tamizdat publication was Boris Pasternak's novel Doctor Zhivago, which, after it had been refused by Soviet publishers,Elst p. 42. was first published in an Italian translation in Italy in 1957. Because Italy was a member of both the UCC and the Berne Convention, the work was entitled to full copyright in all other member states of these two conventions. Pasternak was expelled from the Writers' Union and, after he had been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1958, forced to decline acceptance of the award. Early Soviet authors sometimes benefited from international copyright on their works just naturally. Maxim Gorky and Sergei Prokofiev, for instance, both had lived for some time abroad and published works in other countries that were members of the Berne Convention. These works of theirs were copyrighted in all other signatory countries of the Berne Convention. After the case of Doctor Zhivago, Soviet publishers became more aware of this possibility to have Soviet works covered by the Berne Convention. Soviet state organizations began to arrange for (simultaneous) first publication of some Soviet works in a country of the Berne Convention. For instance, Mikhail Sholokov's novel They Fought for Their Country was officially first published in Italy. When the Soviet Union joined to the UCC, all Soviet works published on or after May 27, 1973 became eligible to copyright in all other signatory countries of the UCC. This state persisted until the dissolution of the USSR. When the USSR disintegrated, so did its copyright law. The split into fifteen independent states translated into a split into fifteen independent copyright laws, each with its own jurisdiction defined by the territory of the new successor state of the Soviet Union. Through the Moscow agreement, Soviet works first published in the RSFSR, which were thus subject to the Russian law, became eligible for copyright is all other CIS nations, even if they had been published before 1973. Since its accession to the Berne Convention in 1995, the following Russian and Soviet works were copyrighted outside of Russia: * All works copyrighted in Russia in 1995, when Russia joined the Berne Convention, became copyrighted in other Berne countries. By virtue of the retroactivity of the Russian copyright law of 1993, this also included many pre-1973 Soviet works,Elst p. 532ff. namely all works published in 1945 or later and also older works of authors who died or were rehabilitated in 1945 or later (or 1941 for authors who lived during the Great Patriotic War), if these works were first published in the Russian SFSR (or later in Russia) or the author had become a citizen of the Russian Federation after the demise of the Soviet Union.Elst p. 481. * All works copyrighted in Russia on January 1, 1996, the effective date of the U.S. Uruguay Round Agreements Act, became copyrighted in the U.S. on that date. This essentially concerned all the same works as above, but using the years 1946 or 1942 instead of 1945 and 1941, respectively.Pilch 2003, p. 86.See e.g. ASCAP's list of compositions whose copyright was restored in 1996 by the URAA. URL last accessed 2007-01-25. * In the countries that had bilateral treaties with the USSR, pre-1973 Soviet works (from any of the fifteen SSRs) were copyrighted even before.

The Yacht Fri's own story of her protest voyage into the French Bomb Test Zone Fri was an important part of a series of anti-nuclear protest campaigns out of New Zealand which lasted thirty years, from which New Zealand declared itself a nuclear-free zone which was enshrined in legislation in what became the New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone, Disarmament, and Arms Control Act 1987.New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone, Disarmament, and Arms Control Act 1987Nuclear Free Zone In 1974, coordinated by Greenpeace New Zealand, the Fri embarked on a 3-year epic 40,233-kilometer \\"Pacific Peace Odyssey\\" voyage, carrying the peace message to all nuclear states around the world.Michael Szabo, Making Waves: The Greenpeace New Zealand Story, Background Fri was built for sail alone; she is a Baltic coastal trader constructed out of oak in 1912 in Svendborg Denmark. She is 32 meters long with a gaff rig, hand winches, and traditional ropes and canvas sails. In 1969 she carried 60 tons of cargo on an historic passage between Northern Europe and San Francisco. In 1970 she carried fresh water to the American Indian activists who had seized and occupied Alcatraz Island from the Government. In 1971 under her new owners American David Moodie and his brothers, the Fri sailed from Hawaii to New Zealand crewed by a group of hippie consumer escapes, in search of adventure and an alternative lifestyle down-under. This epic voyage to New Zealand would result in the vessel and its owners carving their name in New Zealand peace history. [indexgb] Voyage to Mururoa The protest voyage of the yacht Fri in 1973 was an expedition to French Polynesia, as an act of civil disobedience to highlight the ills of French nuclear tests at Mururoa Atoll. This was part of a wider action spearheaded by the New Zealand protest movement between 1957 and 1991.Disarmament and Security Centre - Publications - Papers Countdown at Mururoa Atoll - TIME Within days of Fri's arrival in Auckland from Hawaii in April 1972, the crew of Fri were approached by Mabel Hetherington from CNDNZ (Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (NZ)) and Barry Mitcalfe from Peace Media, and sounded out as to whether they might be interested in joining a planned flotilla of protest yachts which would sail in an act of civil disobedience into the Mururoa exclusion zone in French Polynesia to attempt to disrupt French atmospheric nuclear tests there. CND New Zealand, who had its roots in the British anti bomb movement, had been actively campaigning against Nuclear tests not only in French Polynesia but against the British atomic bomb tests in Australia and the South Pacific since the 1950s. In 1963, the Auckland CND campaign submitted its ‘No Bombs South of the Line' petition to the Parliament of New Zealand with 80,238 signatures calling on the government to sponsor an international conference to discuss establishing a nuclear-free zone in the southern hemisphere. Throughout the 1960s CNDNZ facilitated a national New Zealand public educational program on the serious health issues surrounding atmospheric nuclear testing in the region, while also promoting nationally the advantages of declaring New Zealand a nuclear-free zone. The New Zealand Peace Media took upon itself the responsibility to organize the logistics of the campaign for a flotilla of protest yachts to sail to Mururoa. In the first instance the Fri was to act as the mother ship to a fleet of smaller yachts from around the pacific. The Peace Media boasted branches and contacts in France, Fiji, Western Samoa, New Hebrides and Peru. David Moodie, the owner and captain of the Fri did initially express some reservations as to the preparedness of his yacht for the proposed 5391 kilometers mission. These details were accommodated by the Peace Media, who took responsibility for finding his crew (selected from an international crew of activists and peacemakers) for the proposed voyage.Boy Roel Voyage to Nowhere by Barry Mitcalfe, published by Alister Taylor Publishing Ltd 1972 The protest initiative sought to create sufficient negative publicity against the French and to force them towards a nuclear test ban in Polynesia. Fri was made ready and sailed from Opua to Whangarei. On March 23, 1973 Fri sailed from New Zealand into open ocean towards Mururoa. At Mururoa Fri maintained a 53-day vigil within the test exclusion zone, just outside Mururoa Atoll and insight of the test island, with the company of a second peace yacht from New Zealand, the Spirit of Peace, for five weeks. For many weeks her only contact was by brief radio messages with the New Zealand Government protest warship HMS Otago. In a symbolic act of protest, New Zealand’s Labour government of Norman Kirk sent two of its navy frigates, HMNZS Canterbury and Otago, into the test zone area.Mururoa Nuclear Tests, RNZN protest Veterans - Home On July 17, 1973 French commandos stormed the Fri and arrested the crew and ship, impounding ship and crew firstly at Mururoa and then at Hao Island. The publicity surrounding the Fri expedition in 1973 and the protest voyages of David McTaggart on the yacht Vega in 1972 and 1973, (McTaggart was severely beaten by French commandos in 1973), made international news and heralded an invigorated protest movement from New Zealand and Australia which eventually forced the French to cease nuclear testing in the Pacific in 1996. The French Military conducted more than 200 nuclear tests at Mururoa and Fangataufa atolls over a thirty-year period, 40 of them atmospheric. Greenpeace continued an unrelenting protest offensive in French Polynesia up until 1996. According to French journalist Luis Gonzales-Mata in Actual magazine 1976, large numbers of Polynesians had been secretly sent on military flights to Paris for treatment for cancer. Tahitian activist Charlie Ching told a nuclear-free Pacific hui in Auckland in 1983 that more than 200 Tahitians had died from radiation-linked illnesses over 5 years. Due to the secrecy of health issues in French Polynesia, figures remained impossible to confirm. In August 2006 people of French Polynesia welcomed an official report by the French government confirming the link between an increase in the cases of thyroid cancer and France's atmospheric nuclear tests in the territory since 1966.Radio Australia - Pacific Beat - FRENCH POLYNESIA: Nuclear veterans welcome report's findings See also *New Zealand's nuclear-free zone *Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (NZ) *Nuclear-free zone *ANZUS - New Zealand bans nuclear ships *Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament *Sinking of the Rainbow Warrior *Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone *Greenpeace Aotearoa New Zealand *France and weapons of mass destruction *Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty *Nuclear testing References External links *The Sailing ship Fri *France's Nuclear Weapons Program at the Atomic Forum *Mururoa protest, Time 1973 *Anti-Nuclear Oxford debate by former New Zealand PM David Lange *“By-laws beat the bomb” – Commentary by Frank Johnson *New Zealand becomes a Nuclear Free Zone *Keeping New Zealand Nuclear Free *Nuclear Free New Zealand (NZHistory) *Radio Nizkor International Nuclear conference *Preservation of the Fri campaign Category:Anti–nuclear weapons movement Category:Environment of French Polynesia Category:Individual sailing vessels ","title":"Fri (yacht)"},{"id":"11710200","text":"Perenniporia is a cosmopolitan genus of bracket-forming or crust-like polypores in the family Polyporaceae. They are dimitic or trimitic with smooth, thick-walled basidiospores and cause a white rot in affected wood. Taxonomy Perenniporia was proposed by American mycologist William Alphonso Murrill in 1943 to contain two species formerly placed in Poria, a genus formerly used to contain all crust-like poroid fungi. His description of the genus was: \\"Hymenophore become perennial, riding; context white or yellow; tubes pinkish, white or yellow, stratose in older specimens; spores hyaline.\\" Murrill's concept was to move the species with annual fruit bodies (Poria unita and Poria nigriscens) into Perenniporia, retaining Poria for those that produced perennial fruit bodies. The genus name combines the Latin word perennis (\\"perennial\\") with the genus name Poria Edalat. Murrill's designated type species, P. unita, had a broad and poorly defined species concept that included other species, including Perenniporia medulla-panis. Additionally, P. unita was discovered to be a nomen dubium, which also threatened the validity of the genus Perenniporia. To remedy this nomenclatural instability, Cony Decock and Joost Stalpers proposed to conserve Perenniporiella with P. medulla-panis as the type. Although Truncospora has traditionally been considered a synonym of Perenniporia, molecular phylogenetic analysis shows that it is genetically unique and worthy of recognition as a distinct genus. Genera that have been segregated from Perenniporia include Perenniporiopsis and Perenniporiella. Species Perenniporia chroleuca Perenniporia subacida stipe, a feature that is rare in genus Perenniporia.

It comprised the Italian peninsula, the Western Balkans, the Danubian provinces and parts of North Africa. The Prefecture's seat moved from Rome to Milan and finally, Ravenna. Structure and history The prefecture was established in the division of the Empire after the death of Constantine the Great in 337, and was made up of dioceses. Initially these were the Diocese of Africa, the Diocese of Italy, the Diocese of Pannonia, the Diocese of Dacia and the Diocese of Macedonia (the last two were until c. 327 united in the Diocese of Moesia). Eventually the Diocese of Italy was split in two, the Diocese of Suburbicarian Italy (Italia suburbicaria: \\"Italy under the City\\", also referred to as \\"Diocese of the City of Rome\\") and the Diocese of Annonarian Italy (Italia annonaria: \\"provisioning Italy\\"). In 347, the praetorian prefecture of Illyricum was established, comprising the dioceses of Pannonia, Dacia and Macedonia. Vulcaius Rufinus was the prefect, 347-352. The new prefecture was abolished in 361 by Julian and reestablished in 375 by Gratian. Its territory was contested between the two halves of the Empire, until the final partition in 395, when the Diocese of Pannonia was split off from the Illyricum and joined to the Western Empire and the prefecture of Italy as the Diocese of Illyricum. Despite the end of the Western Empire in 476, the Germanic successor states under Odoacer and Theodoric the Great continued to use the Roman administrative machinery, as well as being nominal subjects of the Eastern emperor at Constantinople. The Prefecture thus survived, and came again into Roman hands after Justinian's Gothic War. However, with the Lombard invasion in 568, Roman rule became reduced to fragmented and isolated territories, and the Prefecture gave its place to the Exarchate of Ravenna, established by the emperor Maurice. Prefects continue however to be attested until well into the 7th century. The last attested holder occurs in 639, and a couple of seals bearing the title eparchos (\\"prefect\\" in Greek) survive from the late 7th century, although it has been suggested that they are a misprint for exarchos (\\"exarch\\").

Written in 1331, the ornamental manuscript includes the Jewish services for all occasions throughout the year, together with commentaries (in the margins) which have never been published. The manuscript was written on parchment and, at 20 inches high by 14 inches wide, and weighing more than 57 pounds (26 kilograms), is one of the largest and heaviest codices to have survived anywhere. It contains 521 folios. The illuminated Nuremberg Mahzor contains prayers and piyyutim for the whole year according to the Eastern Ashkenazi (Austrian) rite, the five Megillot and the Haftarot. The Nuremberg Mahzor got its name from its home for more than 300 years – the Nuremberg municipal library in Germany. The manuscript was originally commissioned for private study and synagogue use by a Jewish patron and was most likely used by the Nuremberg community after 1499. From the 16th century until 1951 the manuscript was in the possession of the Nuremberg Municipal Library. In 1951, Salman Schocken, a German-Jewish publisher and book collector, purchased the Nuremberg Mahzor as post-World War II restitution for property confiscated by the Nazis. Since then it was stored for 50 years in the Schocken Institute for Jewish Studies in Jerusalem. During that time it went only once on public display. In 2005 the manuscript was purchased by the private collector Dr. David Jeselsohn, Zurich. In the 19th century, 11 leaves were removed from the prayer book by Napoleon’s army, museum officials believe. Schocken acquired four of the missing leaves in the 1930s after he fled Nazi Germany. One leaf, who was in a private collection, has been purchased by Jeselsohn in 2010. Six leaves are still missing. Immediately after the purchase of the Nuremberg Mahzor by Dr. Jeselsohn, the whole book has been scanned by the Jewish National and University Library in Jerusalem.mahzor-nuremberg and after a six-months restoration at the Israel Museum laboratories it went on display at the Israel Museum's Shrine of the Book in Jerusalem from September 2009 through February 2010.

Launched in April 2007 as an undertaking of the Atlantic Initiative, the Atlantic Community aims at facilitating discussion between young thinkers and established members of the foreign policy realm in order to increase participation in a system that, in Europe, is often closed off to the public at large. The Advisory Board of the Atlantic Community is non-partisan, and includes journalist Marvin Kalb, UK Liberal Democrat Lord Wallace, and German diplomat Jürgen Chrobog as members. In January 2009 the Atlantic Community was selected as a \\"Landmark in the Land of Ideas\\" by Germany: Land of Ideas. Germany: Land of Ideas is a shared initiative of the German government, commerce, and industry under the patronage of former Federal President Horst Köhler.  Mission  Atlantic Community has more than 7000 members, including future policymakers, think- tankers, journalists, academics, students, and active citizens. Its mission is to encourage open and democratic dialogue on the challenges facing Europe and North America while also giving a voice to a new generation of thinkers. Young leaders are provided the opportunity to publish and debate side by side with established experts, and to have their policy ideas seen by senior officials. The members of the Atlantic Community can share and discuss their ideas by posting op-eds, research, and comments on the website. The best analysis and policy recommendations are summarized in Atlantic Memos that are presented to decision makers in NATO and EU countries.  Activities  The main feature of the Atlantic Community is the Policy Workshop, where new commentary is published from think-tankers, journalists and decision makers working in subjects which are relevant to the transatlantic partners. Among contributors to the Workshops were Eckart von Klaeden, Minister of State at the German Chancellery, Karsten D. Voigt, the Coordinator for German-American Cooperation in the German Foreign Office, Julianne Smith of the American think tank CSIS, and current Chatham House director Robin Niblett. Members of the Atlantic Community then comment on these strategies and add their own ideas below the original article. The finished product, called an Executive Summary, is a one- page policy memo in PDF format that summarizes the netroots suggestions and discussion from the community. In 2011 Atlantic Community celebrated the tenth anniversary of UN Resolution 1325 by launching an op-ed competition \\"Women on Transatlantic Security\\". The initiative was sponsored by the NATO Public Diplomacy Division and the United States Mission to NATO. The competition aimed at empowering young women working in the peace and security areas and encouraging them to participate in debates on international security issues. The next two Policy Workshop competitions were \\"Ideas with Impact: Students Advise Decision Makers\\" and \\"Your Ideas, Your NATO\\", which took place respectively in May 2011 and May 2012 in Berlin. The former Policy Workshop competition focused on policy recommendations on Iran, Russia and climate change; the winners of the competition presented their policy proposals to Philip D. Murphy, the US Ambassador to Germany, CDU/CSU Foreign Policy Spokesman Philipp Mißfelder and their policy advisers. The latter competition concentrated on NATO values, NATO partnerships after the Arab Spring, and Smart Defense; the competition winners presented their policy recommendations to Philip D. Murphy and Parliamentary State Secretary to the Federal Minister of Defense Christian Schmidt (CSU). The most recent competition was \\"Shaping Our NATO: Young Voices on the Warsaw Summit 2016\\". It focused on encouraging students and recent graduates under 28 years of age to produce innovative solutions to either contemporary or future problems. The four categories ranged from how NATO can increase solidarity amongst its members, to suggesting ways that the Alliance should learn from its mistakes and adapt to change. Apart from competitions and workshops, Atlantic Community provides daily top press commentaries, regular up-dates on the best of think-tanks' publications, and conducts expert surveys. For example, in April 2010 the think tank carried out a NATO sponsored survey of Russian experts aimed at gauging the path of NATO-Russia relations. Jimmy Wales, the founder of the Wikipedia, was featured among the decision makers interviewed by the Atlantic Community.  Deutschlands Agenda  The German-language blog Deutschlands Agenda is the most recent project of the Atlantic Initiative, launched in November 2011. Like atlantic-community.org, this platform concentrates on foreign policy; however, it especially aims to raise awareness as well as strengthen the debate on German foreign policy issues. In an ever more connected world, foreign policy factors have to be taken into account while making national policy decisions. By explaining these interactions as well as initiating a discussion on the topic between citizens, politicians and opinion leaders, Deutschlands Agenda looks to accustom citizens to the global context of decisions. By appealing especially to the younger generation and the blogging community, it not only wishes to deepen citizen participation, but also to actively and sustainably frame the German political dialogue and to eventually create a strong strategic community in Germany. Like atlantic- community.org, Deutschlands Agenda will condense fruitful discussions into executive briefings (Memos) and send them for consideration to key decision makers.

The park forms the centre of the Waverley Park Heritage Conservation District, a collection of historical homes, churches, schools, and other buildings at the centre of Port Arthur. The property was surveyed and set aside as parkland by the Crown Lands Department, in the original ordnance survey of the Prince Arthur's Landing town plot in 1871. It was given to the city of Port Arthur in 1907 on the condition that is \\"not be alienated or leased and that no buildings be erected on it except municipal buildings\\". The most notable features of Waverley Park include its giant cottonwood trees, which stand as much as 40 m above the park. In recent years, many have been removed due to advanced age and disease. Other notable features include a fountain, cenotaph, and bandshell. The park is between Waverley Street and Red River Road in Thunder Bay, and is located between two historic schools -- Port Arthur Collegiate Institute and Port Arthur Central School -- the latter is now home to Magnus Theatre.  Hogarth Fountain  The centrepiece of Waverley Park is the Hogarth Fountain. A gift from the wife of a prominent soldier and politician, Major General Donald McDonald Hogarth (1879–1950), the fountain originated from the Luton Hoo Mansion, in the town of Hitchin, Hertfordshire, England. Its ten tonne Portland stone foundation dates back to 1790. The fountain was purchased and shipped to Waverly Park in 1964, and dedicated on 5 June 1965. The fountain features nude children in a renaissance style, along with bundles of wheat and garlands of flowers. The water pours from the mouths of lions mounted above leaves which deflect the water away from the center and out into the pool.  Rotary Thundershell  The Rotary Thundershell is a large wooden bandshell located in the west corner of the park, behind the gymnasium of Port Arthur Collegiate Institute. The bandshell was built in 1984 and for many years was home to the weekly Summer in the Parks concert series. Its construction was financed using donations from various local groups and companies, which are commemorated on a plaque located on the bandshell. The bandshell was replaced in 2018 by a multipurpose pavilion constructed by Finnway Contracting and paid for with funds raised by The Coalition For Waverley Park.  Port Arthur Cenotaph  The Port Arthur Cenotaph The Port Arthur Cenotaph was originally built in remembrance of local soldiers who died during World War I, and was updated for both the Second World War and the Korean War. It was erected in 1925 by the McCallum Granite Company of Kingston, Ontario, through the efforts of the Women's Canadian Club at a cost of $8,000.We Will Remember war monuments in Canada, Port Arthur Cenotaph. Retrieved November 11, 2008. The design of the cenotaph is simple. Both immense and yet stark, with simplistic lines, the monument is identical on either side. The inscription reads: Below it are the dates of World War I, World War II, and the Korean War.  Magnus Theatre  Founded in 1971, Magnus Theatre relocated to the old Port Arthur Central School in 2001. Located on the eastern corner of the park, the 123-year-old structure was expanded in 1999 to accommodate the theatre. After renovations landscaping was designed to incorporate it into the existing Waverley Park. The grounds of Magnus Theatre feature a memorial garden in the shape of the former schools baseball diamond, lighted pathways, and various trees and shrubs.  Memorial Garden  Memorial Garden - August 28, 2010 The memorial garden has stones laid out in the shape of a baseball diamond. The bases and home plate are represented by cubic stones with inscriptions. A large, irregularly shaped rock located in the centre represents the pitcher's mound with a plaque that reads: Each of the stones that represent the baseball plates have inscriptions that read as follows:  Port Arthur Collegiate Institute  Port Arthur Collegiate Institute towers over Waverley Park. At the westernmost end of Waverley Park is the former Port Arthur Collegiate Institute, which was the oldest high school west of Toronto, Ontario. The large castle-like edifice was constructed in 1909-10 of Simpson Island sandstone, and incorporated medieval and Flemish architectural features. Being located on a hill, it has a very imposing nature when viewed from the park below. Its site was chosen by Montreal landscape architect Frederick Todd, and its architects were Young and Simpson of Toronto.Port Arthur Daily News 11 & 15 May 1909. The hill on which the school is located was the shore of the post glacial lake which preceded Lake Superior, and is composed mainly of beach sand.

Biography Wolicka, born in Warsaw when it was within the Russian Empire, pursued her history degree despite the efforts of the Russian government of the time to prevent women from pursuing higher education. In 1873 she defied a decree ordering Russian women studying abroad to abandon their studies. Wolicka elected to continue her studies after her request for an exemption from the decree was denied. She petitioned the Minister of Education, Dmitry Tolstoy, directly, without success. The Russian government achieved the expulsion of several women students in Zurich, due to the political threat it saw in radical socialist activists called the \\"Fritschi Circle\\" (named after their Zurich landlady, Frau Fritsch). Some were put on trial in Russia, during the Trial of Fifty in 1877, leading to convictions and imprisonment for several. There is no evidence that Wolicka was ever part of this circle, and recent research indicates that some students in Zurich were listed as revolutionaries by the government based solely on the fact that they had attended university in Switzerland during the period 1872–73. However, Wolicka's name was on a list of 45 female Russian students sent to Tolstoy, who were all banned from teaching in the Russian Empire, forcing them to leave Switzerland by January 1, 1874. According to University of Zurich records, Wolicka was from Posen (Poznań), and was born in Warsaw, and while she attended the University of Zurich, her parents were living in Zurich. Despite being forced to leave Switzerland, she received her Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1875. Her doctoral dissertation is titled \\"Griechische Frauengestalten, 1.Teil\\" (Greek Figures of Women, Part 1). She has been called one of the \\"first Polish female academicians\\". Hulewicz noted that she belongs to the first generation of Polish female students, a generation that was composed \\"primarily of heroic individuals\\". Wolicka married, and became known by the name Stefania Wolicka-Arnd. Her doctoral dissertation was published in 1875 by Zürcher und Furrer in Zurich. She became a noted writer on women's rights in Poland. In 1895, she published an article in the Polish law journal Athenæum titled \\"Twenty five years of the parliamentary struggle for the rights of women\\". Wolicka was the first woman to earn a Doctorate of Philosophy degree in Europe in the modern era. The first woman known to receive a Doctorate of Philosophy degree in Europe is believed to be Elena Cornaro, who received the degree at the University of Padua in 1678. Universities in Switzerland were the first modern-era European universities to admit female students. Women scholars from Poland, Austria, Belgium, and other parts of Europe relocated to Switzerland in the late 19th century to enroll in university, such as Belgium's first female university graduate, physician Isala Van Diest.

Only about seven specimens remain today, (on mainland New Zealand), after a rescue expedition by the Rare Breeds Conservation Society of New Zealand (RBCSNZ), and a culling program to protect the native flora and fauna of Enderby Island. There have since been intensive efforts at breeding the cattle, involving both in vitro fertilisation and cloning, and there is an ongoing program to perpetuate the breed in captivity. History Nine cattle (the exact breed remains obscure) were introduced to Enderby Island, the northernmost of the subantarctic Auckland Islands group, in the 1890s when an attempt was made to establish farming on the island. The attempt failed because of the climate, with the island being abandoned in 1910 and the cattle left behind. Over the 80 years of subsequent isolation the cattle survived well despite the harsh climate, feeding on Enderby's scrub vegetation, Southern Rata, and seaweed, evolving to cope with the environment. Cattle had been released earlier, also, in an effort to provide food for castaways. In 1991, New Zealand's Department of Conservation decided that species introduced to the Auckland Islands, including cattle and rabbits, should be culled in the course of a program to restore the natural ecosystem. An expedition that year eradicated 47 of an estimated 53 cattle on the island. Genetic material (oocytes and epididymal sperm) was taken and stored. A 1992 expedition by the RBCSNZ, to rescue live specimens of the Enderby Island Rabbit, found tracks of two remaining cattle, a cow and her calf, which were later captured and transferred to New Zealand. Description The cattle originally introduced to Enderby Island were described (in the ship's log) as 'shorthorn'. However, their descendants do not look much like modern shorthorns and are more similar to Shetland cattle. They are typically black and white, but three of the 47 cattle culled in 1991 were described as being red and white, and they were probably not a pure breed originally. They are small cattle with long bodies and short legs, giving them a distinctive appearance.

The drink won gold medals in liquor competitions in Madrid, Spain in 1982 and 1983, and again in Barcelona in 2006. The medals are featured prominently on the product's packaging and have led to it being referred to locally as \\"SangSom Rianthong\\" (SangSom Gold Medallion). The beverage is virtually unheard of outside Thailand. The manufacturers, SangSom Company, export to around 20 countries, but export sales account for barely one percent of total sales. SangSom Company is a member of Thai Beverage Public Company, which itself is a group company of International Beverage Holdings Limited.

He is a businessman and pastor and has also taught mathematics and computer science at Selma University. In December 2015 he was elected presiding pastor of Ebenezer Missionary Baptist Church in Selma, succeeding F. D. Reese. After working as a computer consultant out of state, Perkins returned to Selma as manager of Reese's unsuccessful 1980 campaign against the long-term mayor of Selma, Joe Smitherman, a former segregationist. He returned again in 1991 and ran against Smitherman himself in 1992 and 1996 before succeeding in a run-off in September 2000 in defeating Smitherman's bid for his tenth consecutive term. He was Selma's first African American mayor. In 2008 he was elected president of the National Conference of Black Mayors. Perkins served two terms in office; in 2008, George Evans, who was Selma's first African American City Council president, defeated his bid for reelection.

The Bud Billiken Club was formed as part of the Defender Junior, the children's page in the newspaper, to encourage reading, appropriate social conduct, and involvement in the community, among the young people of Chicago.Ransom, Lou. Chicago Defender. 1 July 2009 – 17 June 2011. n.p. 2008. Web. 26 September 2011. Since 1972, the Bud Billiken Club has been known as Bud Billiken Youth. 90 years after it was founded, the organization has grown into a year-round program that supports youth with financial and academic help. They also continue to shine the light on outstanding young people who might have otherwise gone unnoticed.  History  Initially, Abbott had created a day for the members of the Bud Billiken Club and the youth who sold his newspapers to be an annual November event. However, by 1929 the day of fun had morphed into a summer-time celebration and parade, dubbed in 1929 as the Bud Billiken Day Parade. The parade is noted as the largest parade and picnic of its kind in the United States, and draws over a million viewers each year.Fabre, Genevieve. “African American Commemorative Celebrations in the Nineteenth Century.” History and Memory in African American Culture. Ed. Genevieve Fabre and Robert O’Meally. New York: Oxford University Press, 1994. 72-75. Print. The Club was dedicated to supporting Chicago’s black youth, and frequently paid tribute to outstanding individuals. In 1935, the Club honored Cleotis Brittenum of Holly Springs, Mississippi for selling more Defender subscriptions “than any other Billiken.” At the annual Parade Cleotis rode in style on a white and gold float with the American Legion Drum and Bugle Corps broadcasting his ride through the South Side.Defender, 17 August 1935 Origins The billiken, a smiling, rotund, elfin creature, popular in the early 1900s, became the mascot for the Bud Billiken Club when Abbott spotted a jolly deity on the door of a Chinese restaurant; upon learning that the jolly deity was the protector of children, he adopted the billiken as mascot of the Club. Later in 1923, the eleven-year-old boy Willard Motley submitted a drawing to the Chicago Defender of a pudgy and cheerful boy, which Abbott named the \\"new Billikin\\". The name \\"Bud Billiken\\" is a pseudonym that Abbott selected for the organization, using his own nickname \\"Bud\\"; the word \\"Billiken\\" was believed to be in reference to a character in Chinese mythology who was the protector of children. Though the billiken was actually created by an American woman in 1908, the figure still represented the guardian angel and patron of children and Abbott placed Motley’s drawing on the paper’s children’s page, the Defender Junior. Known as “the first Billiken,” Motley continued to pen drawings for the Defender Junior for the next seven years.Rutkoff, Peter and William Scott. ”Pinkster in Chicago: Bud Billiken and the Mayor of Bronzeville, 1930-1945.” Journal of African American History. 89.4 (2004): 316-330.

Land of Hope: Chicago, Black Southerners, and the Great Migration. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1991. Print. It was also meant as a way to give underprivileged children a creative outlet and a chance to shine in the limelight. Over the years Bud Billiken became the mascot not only for the children’s page, but for the whole newspaper. Abbott organized dozens of Bud Billiken Clubs nationwide for children who pledged to read the Defender.Rutkoff, Peter and William Scott. ”Pinkster in Chicago: Bud Billiken and the Mayor of Bronzeville, 1930-1945.” Journal of African American History. 89.4 (2004): 316-330. Print. Programs and Events The Bud Billiken Club sponsors scholarships, and assists youth with job training, internships, and college recruitment.Defender, 1 July 2009 They regularly feature outstanding Chicago youth through their volunteer work and essay contests. The Club also organizes, in conjunction with Chicago Defender Charities, school supply giveaways, reduced rates on computers and Internet service, and even things such as prom dress donations. There is also focus on creating safe communities through conflict resolution and promoting education. Each year there is a Bud Billiken Contest to determine the Parade’s King, Queen and Royal Court. The winners are determined based on the amount of Chicago Defender subscriptions sold and a written and oral essay. The contest is open to children ages eight to eleven and titles include King, Queen, Prince, Princess, Lord, and Lady. Though all are awarded, the King and Queen receive the grand prize of a trip to Disney World. The winners are announced each year at the Bud Billiken Day Parade and participate in “a week of fun,” including riding a float in the parade and visiting various places around the city as members of the Royal Court.Defender, 17 June 2011 See also *Bud Billiken Parade and Picnic References Category:1923 establishments in Illinois Category:African-American organizations ","title":"Bud Billiken Club"},{"id":"11710504","text":"Teddy bear parachuting, sometimes referred to as parafauna, is a game in which teddy bears equipped with parachutes are dropped from a height. It is increasing in popularity as a charity fundraiser, and competitions based on the descent time are also common. A typical teddy bear parachute may be made from an old umbrella canopy or other lightweight material. A simple hemispherical pattern of multiple tapered gores may be sewn from ripstop nylon kite or sail fabric. Many bears are dressed and fully equipped with parachute packs, helmets and goggles. These teddies landed by parachute after a balloon ride that took them to an altitude of 30km While jumps are commonly from high buildings such as church towers and castles, some are more ambitious, with at least one regular event including parachuting from a light aircraft. The first bears to do a jump from a light aircraft are still around, and go under the name of the \\"Ted Devils\\". A unique item that takes place at airshows (including those at fetes and private functions) devised and run by a well known UK display pilot and aircraft. Additionally, these bears are fund raisers that support the local community, by letting the local community take part in the event before the day. Parachuting bears are also lifted by kite and released with a dropper mechanism. This method is cheap and highly portable. Kites such as parafoils or large deltas are particularly suitable for this. As many kite fliers also make their own kites, the parachutes are usually self-manufactured too. Most bears must be lifted aloft along with the kite. Some small bears may be transported along the line of an already flying kite by a messenger, a small carriage with sails. When the messenger reaches the top of the kite line, the bear is released automatically. This is a much simpler method for repeated drops or charity events. The parachuting of teddy bears was used as a political statement when several hundred of the stuffed toys bearing protest slogans were dropped over the Belarus city of Minsk on 4 July 2012.

Born in 1845 in Pontinvrea, Province of Savona, Liguria, Buschiazzo was the son of Margarita Bresciani and Carlos Buschiazzo. In 1850 the family arrived to Argentina and took up residence in Belgrano, a town that was soon to become a neighbourhood of the city of Buenos Aires. It was here that his four brothers and sisters were born. In 1862 he started work in the studio of the Italian architect Nicolás Canale and his son José, and in 1869 he graduated from the University of Buenos Aires with a degree in engineering. In 1875, he became a member of the Municipal Commission for Public Works in Belgrano and in 1878 he qualified as an architect. In 1879 his son, Juan Carlos, was born and was later to become an architect and work with his father on a number of projects. When Buenos Aires officially became the capital of Argentina in 1880 he was invited by the first mayor of the city, Torcuato de Alvear, to join the Department of Municipal Engineers. Thereafter he was involved with a wide range of projects concerned with the modernisation of Buenos Aires and the construction of public buildings, houses, hospitals, cemeteries, churches, parks, banks etc. In 1881 he joined the Commission for overseeing building projects in the city of La Plata. In 1886, he founded the Central Society of Architects and became its president between 1888 and 1891 and again between 1901 and 1902.

Currently, Navarrete is the only pottery centre in La Rioja, and it has been one of the most important centres in Northern Spain.  Geography   Orography  The municipality has an extension of 28,49 Km², and it borders with Fuenmayor to the north, Logroño and Lardero to the east, Entrena, Medrano, Hornos de Moncalvillo, and Sotés to the south, and Huércanos and Cenicero to the west. {width=\\"60%\\" align=\\"center\\" |----- width =\\"35%\\" align=\\"center\\" Northwest: Fuenmayor y Cenicero width =\\"30%\\" align=\\"center\\" North: Fuenmayor width =\\"35%\\" align=\\"center\\" Northeast: Fuenmayor y Logroño |----- width =\\"10%\\" align=\\"center\\" West: Cenicero y Huércanos width =\\"35%\\" align=\\"center\\" NAVARRETE width =\\"30%\\" align=\\"center\\" East: Lardero |----- width =\\"35%\\" align=\\"center\\" Southwest: Sotés width =\\"30%\\" align=\\"center\\" South: Hornos de Moncalvillo y Medrano width =\\"35%\\" align=\\"center\\" Southeast: Entrena |} Most of the land is located on a glacis of the Iregua River, where currentely the Daroca River flows. Whitin its territorial jurisdiction there is also a reservoir called Valbornedo. The historic centre of the town is built on a hill called Tedeón (512 m), from which the town has since expanded.  Agriculture  Rioja wine is very important to Navarrete's economy.  Economy  There are still some old potteries in the upper part of the town, although the industry has relocated to the lower part of town, next to the communication routes.  History  The origin of the name Navarrete is uncertain. Navarrete was founded by the King of Castile as part of a plan to defend his borders and the name appears to have some relation to the neighbouring Kingdom of Navarre. One theory notes that the word \\"Nafarrate\\" in Basque means \\"Door of Navarre\\"; the later castellanization of the name would give rise to the present spelling. Alfonso VIII of Castile proposed to the inhabitants of the old villages of the zone that they relocate in a defensive place. These villages were known by the name of Corcuetos and their names were: San Llorente, San Antolín, San Pedro and Nuestra Señora del Prado. Their population settled around a castle raised on Tedeón hill, thus founding the new villa of Navarrete. The castle was fortified and protected with a small wall, that enclosed the settlement and it defended it from the possible attacks that threatened from the north. In 1192 important fueros were granted to the inhabitants of the new settlement. These fueros, or charter, gave rise to the use in common of river waters and the collective exploitation of grass lands and woods to the east of the town. The charter also allowed for the establishment of local markets and fairs. Thanks to these privileges, the villa reached a great importance. In 1367 a battle took place in the locality which is sometimes called the Battle of Navarrete, but is better known as the Battle of Nájera.  Places of interest  The historic centre is protected as a Conjunto histórico. Buildings and monuments A marker in the pavement indicates the route of the Way of St. James through the town's center. *Parish church of the Assumption (Asunción de María).

It is native to northern Burma and China, but is sometimes grown in western gardens where it has been in cultivation since 1848. Description Cephalotaxus fortunei is a shrub or small tree growing to as high as 20 m with a diameter at breast height of about 20 cm. They are usually multi-stemmed with an open and loosely rounded crown. In cultivation they tend to grow on a single stem that is often leaning and bare towards the bottom, but with dense foliage on the upper half. They have reddish brown bark that appears purplish in places with rough square scales and long shreds peeling off. The new shoots remain green for three years after emerging and are ribbed. The branches are slightly pendulous, while the branchlets are obovate, obtriangular or almost rectangular in outline, measuring from 4 to 21 cm long by 3 to 20 cm wide. The buds are about 4 mm in length, globular in shape and dark green in colour. They are covered with acute, glossy reddish brown scale- like leaves which remain on the base of the shoot into the following year. The leaves themselves are glossy on the adaxial surface, i.e. the upper-side, and a deep yellowish-green to dark green in colour. They are borne almost horizontally from the branchlet. They are the longest leaves in the genus, typically measuring 3.5 to 12.5 cm, though they can be as short as 1.5 cm, by 3.2 to 5 mm wide, though they sometimes are as narrow as 1.5 mm. They are linear-lanceolate in shape, distally gradually attenuate, i.e. tapering to a point at the end. Their outline is falcate, or sickle-like, to more or less straight and flat. The texture is somewhat leathery, but generally they are quite soft and flexible. The midvein is 0.2 to 0.5 mm wide on the abaxial surface, or underside, showing two broad and grey stomatal bands that are 0.8 to 2.1 mm wide with 13 to 24 rows of stomata, though the individual stomata are not readily visible to the naked eye. The leaf base is cuneate, or wedge- shaped, to shortly attenuate, while the apex is cuspidate, or fine pointed. The cusp, or terminal point on the leaves, measures 0.5 to 2 mm, though it often breaks off. The petiole is short at 0.5 to 2 mm in length. The pollen cone is actually a capitula, or a conglomerate, of 6 to 14 cones, and is whitish in colour. They can either be distinctly pedunculate, or stalked, with the peduncle measuring 2 to 5 mm, or sessile, i.e. unstalked, to subsessile, i.e. partially stalked, with the peduncle measuring 0 to 2 mm. They are globose in shape and are 6 to 10 mm in diameter. The bracts are ovate in shape with the largest of them being roughly 2 mm long by 2.5 mm wide with a more or less entire margin, though the margin is sometimes erose, or jagged, and their apex is acute. There are between 6 and 16 microsporophylls present with each containing with 3 or 4 pollen sacs. The seed cones are borne together in groups of 3 to 6. They are pedunculate with the peduncle being 3 to 12 mm in length. The seed scales measure approximately 1.5 mm. The aril of the fruit is initially yellow or green, though it turns to purple when ripe. The fruits measure 1.4 to 2.5 cm long by 0.9 to 1.5 cm wide and have several indistinct striations or prominent longitudinal ridges. The apex of the fruit is very shortly mucronate, i.e. terminating in a sharp tip. The seeds are ellipsoid in shape and are 1.3 to cm 2.4 long by 0.7 to 1.4 cm wide. There are 11 haploid chromosomes present with the tree's DNA.

The 2010 scholarships  On 23 December 2009, David Knowles of Perpetual Private Wealth announced that the new manager of the Lempriere award would be the Sculpture by the Sea organisation,2009 Changes to Award (pdf) and that in 2010, the award would comprise three A$30,000 scholarships for sculptors.  Exhibition  Until the award's restructuring in 2009, an exhibition of the finalists was held each year in the grounds of Werribee Park, Werribee, Victoria, Australia. The award was acquisitive, and winners were brought into the collection displayed along the Sculpture Walk at Werribee Park. The local government authority, Wyndham City Council, would also purchase works for deployment as sculptural installations in the municipality.Wyndham City Council - Public art The future of the collection at Werribee Park remains unresolved; Perpetual Private Wealth has announced a separate review.2009 Changes to Award (pdf)  Complete list of winners  2016 Jennifer Turpin (NSW), operation crayweed Geoffrey Bartlett (VIC), embrace Hanna Hoyne (ACT), cosmic trumpet & embrace 2 Norton Flavell (WA), just another 2015 Orest Keywan (NSW), and the ship sails on (with apologies to f.f.)

Hitler's remarks were recorded by Heinrich Heim, Henry Picker and Martin Bormann and later published by different editors under different titles in three different languages.Picker, Henry and Gerhard Ritter, eds. (1951). Tischgespräche im Führerhauptquartier 1941–1942. Bonn: Athenäum.Genoud, François (1952). Adolf Hitler: Libres Propos sur la Guerre et la Paix. Paris: Flammarion.Trevor-Roper, H.R. (1953).

Martin Bormann, who was serving as Hitler's private secretary, persuaded Hitler to allow a team of specially picked officers to record in shorthand his private conversations for posterity.Trevor-Roper, H.R. (2000). Hitler's Table Talk 1941–1944. New York: Enigma Books, p. vii. The first notes were taken by the lawyer Heinrich Heim, starting from 5 July 1941 to mid-March 1942. Taking his place, Henry Picker took notes from 21 March 1942 until 2 August 1942,Carrier, R.C. (2003). \\"'Hitler's Table Talk': Troubling Finds\\" German Studies Review 26 (3): 561–576. after which Heinrich Heim and Martin Bormann continued appending material off and on until 1944. The talks were recorded at the Führer Headquarters in the company of Hitler's inner circle.Kershaw, Ian (2001). Hitler 1936–1945: Nemesis. London: Penguin, pp. 32–33. The talks dwell on war and foreign affairs but also Hitler's attitudes on religion, culture, philosophy, his personal aspirations and feelings towards his enemies and friends.Domarus, Max (2004). Speeches and proclamations, 1932–1945. Wauconda, IL: Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers, p. 2463.Vollnhals, Clemens (2005). \\"Hitler's Table Talk\\" In Richard Levy, ed., Antisemitism. Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, pp. 308–309.  History  The history of the document is relatively complex as numerous individuals were involved, working at different times, collating different parts of the work. This effort spawned two distinct notebooks, which were translated into multiple languages and covered in some instances non- overlapping time-frames due to ongoing legal and copyright issues.Rosenbaum, Ron (1999). Explaining Hitler. New York: Harper Collins, pp. 74–77. All editions and translations are based on the two original German notebooks, one by Henry Picker and another based on a more complete notebook by Martin Bormann (which is often called the Bormann-Vermerke). Henry Picker was the first to publish the table talk, doing so in 1951 in the original German. This was followed by the French translation in 1952 by François Genoud, a Swiss financier and a principal benefactor of the Nazi diaspora. The English edition came in 1953, which was translated by R. H. Stevens and Norman Cameron and published with an introduction by historian Hugh Trevor-Roper.Sisman, Adam (2011). An Honourable Englishman: The Life of Hugh Trevor-Roper. New York: Random House, pp. 227–230. Both the French and English translations were purportedly based on the Bormann-Vermerke manuscript while Picker's volume was based on his original notes as well as the notes he directly acquired from Heinrich Heim spanning from 5 July 1941 to March 1942.Trevor-Roper, H.R. (2000). Hitler's Table Talk 1941–1944. New York: Enigma Books, p. viii. The original German content of the Bormann-Vermerke was not published until 1980 by historian Werner Jochmann.Jochmann, Werner (1980). Monologe im Führerhauptquartier 1941–1944. Hamburg: Albrecht Knaus Verlag. However Jochmann's edition is not complete as it lacks the 100 entries made by Picker between 12 March and 1 September 1942.Trevor-Roper, H.R. (2000). Hitler's Table Talk 1941–1944. New York: Enigma Books, p. x. Both Heim's and Picker's original manuscripts seem to have been lost and their whereabouts are unknown. Albert Speer, who was the Minister of Armaments for Germany, confirmed the authenticity of Picker's German edition in his Spandau diaries.Speer, Albert (1976). Spandau: The Secret Diaries. New York: Macmillan, p. 237. Speer stated that Hitler often spoke at length about his favorite subjects while dinner guests were reduced to silent listeners. In the presence of his \\"superiors by birth and education\\" Hitler made a sincere effort to \\"present his thoughts in as impressive manner as possible\\". Speer noted that \\"we must remember that this collection includes only those passages in Hitler's monologues—they took up one to two hours every day—which struck Picker as significant. Complete transcripts would reinforce the sense of stifling boredom\\". According to historian Max Domarus, Hitler insisted on absolute silence when he delivered his monologues. No one was allowed to interrupt or contradict him. Magda Goebbels reported to Galeazzo Ciano: \\"It is always Hitler who talks! He can be Führer as much as he likes, but he always repeats himself and bores his guests\\". Ian Kershaw reports: > Some of the guests—among them Goebbels, Göring, and Speer—were regulars. > Others were newcomers or were seldom invited. The talk was often of world > affairs. But Hitler would tailor the discussion to those present. He was > careful in what he said. He consciously set out to impress his opinion on > his guests, perhaps at times to gauge their reaction. Sometimes he dominated > the 'conversation' with a monologue. At other times, he was content to > listen while Goebbels sparred with another guest, or a more general > discussion unfolded. Sometimes the table talk was interesting. New guests > could find the occasion exciting and Hitler's comments a 'revelation'. Frau > Below, the wife of the new Luftwaffe-Adjutant, found the atmosphere, and > Hitler's company, at first exhilarating and was greatly impressed by his > knowledge of history and art. But for the household staff who had heard it > all many times, the midday meal was often a tedious affair. After the war, Albert Speer referred to the table talks as \\"rambling nonsense\\", adding: > [Hitler] was that classic German type known as Besserwisser, the know-it- > all. His mind was cluttered with minor information and misinformation, about > everything. I believe that one of the reasons he gathered so many flunkies > around him was that his instinct told him that first-rate people couldn't > possibly stomach the outpourings.O'Donnell, James Preston (1978). The > Bunker: The History of the Reich Chancellery Group. Boston: Houghton > Mifflin. p. 399. .  Controversies  Although the table talk monologues are generally considered authentic, contentious issues remain over aspects of the published works. These include the reliability of particular translated statements within the French and English editions,Nilsson, Mikael (2016). \\"Hugh Trevor- Roper and the English editions of Hitler's Table Talk and Testament.\\" Journal of Contemporary History 51 (4): 788–812.Bucher, Rainer (2011).

Hitler 1936–1945: Nemesis. London: Penguin, p. 964.Stoltzfus, Nathan (2016). Hitler's Compromises: Coercion and Consensus in Nazi Germany. New Haven: Yale University Press, p. 305. questions over the manner in which Martin Bormann may have edited his notesRich, Norman (1992). Hitler's War Aims. New York: W.W. Norton & Company, p. 270.Laqueur, Walter (1978). Fascism: A Reader's Guide. Berkeley: University of California Press, p. 177. and disputes over which edition is most reliable. François Genoud denied claims that he had inserted words into the original German manuscript, pointing out that it was close-typed apart from handwritten additions by Bormann and therefore such insertions would not have been possible. Richard Evans expresses caution when using the English edition, describing it as \\"flawed (and in no sense 'official')\\" and adding that it needed to be compared to the 1980 German edition to ensure it was accurate before being used. Ian Kershaw also notes that the English edition is imperfect, with a tendency to miss words, leave out lines, or include phrases not found in the German text.Kershaw, Ian (2001). Hitler 1936–1945: Nemesis. London: Penguin, p. 964 He uses the original German sources for preference, advising \\"due caution\\" in using the English translations.Kershaw, Ian (2000). Hitler 1889–1936: Hubris. London: Penguin, p. xiv. In 2016, historian Mikael Nilsson argued that Trevor- Roper failed to disclose source-critical problems, including evidence that significant portions of the English translation were translated directly from Genoud's French edition and not the original German Bormann-Vermerke as claimed by Trevor-Roper in his preface. Nilsson maintains that this information was likely known to Trevor-Roper because it was laid out in the publishing contract that the \\"translation into English will be made on the basis of the French version by François Genoud\\". Nilsson concludes that \\"the translation process was highly doubtful; the history of the manuscript from conception to publication is mysterious at best, and it is impossible to be sure that the majority of the entries are in fact authentic (that is, actual statements by Hitler as opposed to things he could have said)\\". For this reason, Nilsson argues that Hitler should not be listed as its author because it is not clear \\"how much of it is Hitler's words as they were spoken, and how much is a product of the later recollection and editing process\\".  Hitler's comments on religion  Hitler's Table Talk reveals he continued to wish for a unified Protestant Reich Church of Germany for some time after 1937, which had largely proven unsuccessful.Steigmann-Gall, Richard (2003). The Holy Reich: Nazi conceptions of Christianity, 1919–1945, pp. 255–256. This was in line with his earlier policy of uniting all the Protestant churches so they would purvey the new racial and nationalist doctrines of the regime and act as a unifying rather than divisive force in Germany. By 1940, Hitler had abandoned even the syncretist idea of a positive Christianity.Poewe, Karla (2006). New Religions and the Nazis. New York: Routledge, p. 28. According to Thomas Childers, after 1938 Hitler began to publicly support a Nazified version of science, particularly social Darwinism, at the core of Nazi ideology in place of a religious one;Peukart, Detlev (1993). \\"The Genesis of the 'Final Solution' from the Spirit of Science.\\" Reevaluating the Third Reich. Eds. Thomas Childers and Jane Caplan. New York: Holmes & Meier Publishing, pp. 234–252. a development that is reflected in his increasingly hostile remarks towards religion in the Table Talk.Steigmann-Gall, Richard (2003). The Holy Reich. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 252–254 Historian Richard Weikart characterized Hitler's belief in \\"evolutionary ethics as the expression of the will of God\\" who routinely \\"equated the laws of nature and the will of Providence\\".Weikart, Richard (2009). Hitler's Ethic: The Nazi Pursuit of Evolutionary Progress. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, p. 40 In the Table Talk, Hitler praised Julian the Apostate's Three Books Against the Galilaeans, an anti-Christian tract from 362. In the entry dated 21 October 1941, Hitler stated: > When one thinks of the opinions held concerning Christianity by our best > minds a hundred, two hundred years ago, one is ashamed to realise how little > we have since evolved. I didn't know that Julian the Apostate had passed > judgment with such clear-sightedness on Christianity and Christians [...] > the Galilean, who later was called the Christ, intended something quite > different. He must be regarded as a popular leader who took up His position > against Jewry [...] and it's certain that Jesus was not a Jew. The Jews, by > the way, regarded Him as the son of a whore—of a whore and a Roman soldier. > The decisive falsification of Jesus's doctrine was the work of St. Paul > [...] Paul of Tarsus (his name was Saul, before the road to Damascus) was > one of those who persecuted Jesus most savagely.Trevor-Roper, Hugh, ed. > (2000). Hitler's Table Talk 1941–1944. Trans. Norman Cameron and R. H. > Stevens. New York: Engima Books, p. 76. Remarks which have not been challenged include \\"Christianity is the prototype of Bolshevism: the mobillization by the Jew of the masses of slaves with the object of undermining society\\". The Table Talk also attributes to Hitler a confidence in science over religion: \\"Science cannot lie, for it's always striving, according to the momentary state of knowledge, to deduce what is true. When it makes a mistake, it does so in good faith. It's Christianity that's the liar\\". In Jochmann (1980) this is quoted as, \\"Mag die Wissenschaft jeweils nach eintausend oder nach zweitausend Jahren zu einem anderen Standpunkt kommen, so war ihr früherer Standpunkt nicht verlogen; die Wissenschaft lügt überhaupt nicht, sie bemüht sich, nach den Grenzen, die jeweils ihrer Einsicht gezogen sind, eine Sache richtig zu sehen. Sie stellt nicht bewußt falsch dar. Das Christentum lügt: Es ist in einen Konflikt mit sich selbst hineingeraten.\\" Monologe im Führerhauptquartier 1941–1944. Hamburg: Albrecht Knaus Verlag, p. 84. However, Hitler insisted: \\"We don't want to educate anyone in atheism\\".Trevor-Roper, H.R. (2013) Hitler's Table Talk 1941–1944. p. 7. In Jochmann (1980) this is quoted as, \\"Zum Atheismus wollen wir nicht erziehen.\\" Monologe im Führerhauptquartier 1941–1944. Hamburg: Albrecht Knaus Verlag, p. 40. Of the Ten Commandments of the Old Testament, Hitler affirms his belief that they \\"are a code of living to which there's no refutation. These precepts correspond to irrefragable needs of the human soul; they're inspired by the best religious spirit, and the Churches here support themselves on a solid foundation\\".Trevor-Roper, Hugh, ed. (2013). Hitler's Table Talk 1941–1944. Trans. Norman Cameron and R.H. Stevens. New York: Engima Books, p. 67.  Revisionist views  In 2003, two challenges appeared to this consensus view. One was from Richard Steigmann-Gall as part of his wider thesis that \\"leading Nazis in fact considered themselves Christian\\" or at least understood their movement \\"within a Christian frame of reference\\".Steigmann-Gall (2003), p. 3. He argues that several passages in the Table Talk reveal Hitler to have a direct attachment to Christianity,Steigmann-Gall (2003), p. 255. to be a great admirer of JesusSteigmann-Gall (2003), pp. 254–255. and \\"gave no indication that he was now agnostic or atheistic\\", a worldview Hitler continued to denigrate the Soviet Union for promoting.Trevor-Roper, H.R. (2013). Hitler's Table Talk 1941–1944. New York: Enigma Books, pp. 77, 87, 721. Steigmann-Gall maintains that Hitler's \\"view of Christianity is fraught with tension and ambiguity\\" and Hitler's Table Talk shows an \\"unmistakable rupture\\" with his earlier religious views,Steigmann-Gall (2003), p. 253. which Steigmann-Gall characterizes as Christian.Steigmann-Gall (2003), pp. 26–28. He attributes this to Hitler's anger at his failure to exert control over the German churches and not anger at Christianity itself.Steigmann-Gall (2003), p. 253, cf. 265. Steigmann- Gall's wider thesis proved highly controversial, although as John S. Conway pointed out, the differences between his thesis and the earlier consensus were mostly about the \\"degree and timing\\" of Nazi anti-clericalism. In the same year, the historical validity of remarks in the English and French translations of the table-talk were challenged in a new partial translation by Richard Carrier and Reinhold Mittschang, who went so far as to call them \\"entirely untrustworthy\\", suggesting they had been altered by Francois Genoud.Carrier (2003), p. 565. They put forward a new translation of twelve quotations based on Picker and Jochmann's German editions as well as a fragment from the Bormann-Vermerke preserved at the Library of Congress. Carrier maintains that much of Trevor-Roper's English edition is actually a verbatim translation of Genoud's French and not the original German. Carrier's thesis is that an analysis between Picker's original German text and Genoud's French translation reveals that Genoud's version is at best a poor translation, and in certain places contains \\"blatant distortions\\". Many of the quotations used to support arguments in favor of Hitler's anti-Christianity are derived from the Genoud–Trevor-Roper translation. Carrier argues that no one \\"who quotes this text is quoting what Hitler actually said\\". In the new foreword to the Table Talk, Gerhard Weinberg commented that \\"Carrier has shown the English text of the table-talk that originally appeared in 1953 and is reprinted here derives from Genoud's French edition and not from one of the German texts\\".Weinberg, Gerhard (2003). Foreword In Hugh Trevor-Roper, ed. 2003. Hitler's Table Talk 1941–1944. New York: Engima Books, p. xi Citing Carrier's paper Diethelm Prowe remarked that Trevor-Roper's Table Talk \\"has been proven to be wholly unreliable as a source almost a decade ago\\". Rainer Bucher referencing the problems raised by Carrier described the English translation as \\"not only of dubious origin but also of dubious intent and ideological underpinning\\", choosing instead to rely on both Picker and Heim's German editions. Derek Hastings references Carrier's paper for \\"an attempt to undermine the reliability of the anti-Christian statements\\". Carrier's thesis that the English translation should be entirely dispensed withCarrier (2003), p. 574. is not accepted by Steigmann-Gall, who despite referencing the controversies raised by Carrier, \\"ultimately presume[d] its authenticity\\".Steigmann-Gall, Richard (2007). “Christianity and the Nazi Movement”. Journal of Contemporary History 42 (2): 208. Johnstone has noted that Richard Carrier has only shown false four of the forty-two anti-Christian comments in the Table Talks without discussion of the rest, and therefore, has been far from successful in removing the historical image of Hitler's anti- Christian character.Johnstone, Nathan. The New Atheism, Myth, and History: The Black Legends of Contemporary Anti-Religion. Palgrave Macmillan, 2018, 90.  Contemporaneous sources  Between 1941 and 1944, the period in which the Table Talk was being transcribed, a number of Hitler's intimates cite him expressing negative views of Christianity, including Joseph Goebbels,Steinberg, Jonathan (2002). All Or Nothing: The Axis and the Holocaust, 1941–1943. London: Routledge Press, p. 234. Albert SpeerSpeer, Albert (1971). Inside the Third Reich: Memoirs by Albert Speer. Trans.

General Gerhard Engel reports that in 1941 Hitler asserted: \\"I am now as before a Catholic and will always remain so\\".Toland, John (1992). Adolf Hitler. New York: Anchor Publishing, p. 507. Similarly, Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber reported that after speaking with Hitler in 1936, he \\"undoubtedly lives in belief in God [...] He recognizes Christianity as the builder of western culture\\". Ian Kershaw concluded that Hitler had deceived Faulhaber, noting his \\"evident ability to simulate, even to potentially critical church leaders, an image of a leader keen to uphold and protect Christianity\\".Kershaw, Ian (2001). The \\"Hitler Myth\\": Image and reality in the Third Reich. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 109. A widespread consensus among historians, sustained over a long period of time following the initial work of William Shirer in the 1960s, maintains that Hitler was anti-clerical. This continues to be the mainstream position on Hitler's religious views and these views continue to be supported by quotations from the English translation of the Table Talk. Michael Burleigh contrasted Hitler's public pronouncements on Christianity with those in Table Talk, suggesting that Hitler's real religious views were \\"a mixture of materialist biology, a faux-Nietzschean contempt for core, as distinct from secondary, Christian values, and a visceral anti-clericalism\\". Richard Evans also reiterated the view that Nazism was secular, scientific and anti- religious in outlook in the last volume of his trilogy on Nazi Germany, writing that \\"Hitler's hostility to Christianity reached new heights, or depths, during the war\\", citing the 1953 English translation of Hitler's Table Talk 1941–1944.

Agricultural land is drained by pumped wells (vertical drainage) to improve the soils by controlling water table levels and soil salinity. Introduction Subsurface (groundwater) drainage for water table and soil salinity in agricultural land can be done by horizontal and vertical drainage systems. Horizontal drainage systems are drainage systems using open ditches (trenches) or buried pipe drains. Vertical drainage systems are drainage systems using pumped wells, either open dug wells or tube wells. cylinders representing the equipotentials Both systems serve the same purposes, namely water table control and soil salinity control . Both systems can facilitate the reuse of drainage water (e.g. for irrigation), but wells offer more flexibility. Reuse is only feasible if the quality of the groundwater is acceptable and the salinity is low. Design Although one well may be sufficient to solve groundwater and soil salinity problems in a few hectares, one usually needs a number of wells, because the problems may be widely spread. The wells may be arranged in a triangular, square or rectangular pattern. The design of the well field concerns depth, capacity, discharge, and spacing of the wells.Boehmer, W.K., and J.Boonstra, 1994, Tubewell Drainage Systems, Chapter 22 in: H.P.Ritzema (ed.), Drainage Principles and Applications, Publ. 16, International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI),Wageningen, The Netherlands. pp. 931-964, .

On line : #The depth is selected in accordance to aquifer properties. The well filter must be placed in a permeable soil layer. #The spacing can be calculated with a well spacing equation using discharge, aquifer properties, well depth and optimal depth of the water table. The determination of the optimum depth of the water table is the realm of drainage research . Flow to wells Geometry of a fully penetrating well drainage system in a uniform, isotropic aquifer Geometry of a partially penetrating well drainage system in an anisotropic layered aquifer The basic, steady state, equation for flow to fully penetrating wells (i.e. wells reaching the impermeable base) in a regularly spaced well field in a uniform unconfined (preactic) aquifer with a hydraulic conductivity that is isotropic is: :Q = 2\\\\pi K \\\\frac{\\\\left(D_b - D_m\\\\right) \\\\left(D_w - D_m\\\\right) }{\\\\ln \\\\frac{R_i}{R_w} } where Q = safe well discharge - i.e. the steady state discharge at which no overdraught or groundwater depletion occurs - (m3/day), K = uniform hydraulic conductivity of the soil (m/day), D = depth below soil surface, D_b = depth of the bottom of the well equal to the depth of the impermeable base (m), D_m = depth of the watertable midway between the wells (m), D_w is the depth of the water level inside the well (m), R_i = radius of influence of the well (m) and R_w is the radius of the well (m). The radius of influence of the wells depends on the pattern of the well field, which may be triangular, square, or rectangular. It can be found as: :R_i = \\\\sqrt{\\\\left( \\\\frac{A_t}{\\\\pi N} \\\\right)} where A_t = total surface area of the well field (m2)and N = number of wells in the well field. The safe well discharge (Q) can also be found from: :Q = q \\\\frac{A_t}{N F_w} where q is the safe yield or drainable surplus of the aquifer (m/day) and F_w is the operation intensity of the wells (hours/24 per day). Thus the basic equation can also be written as: :D_w - D_m = \\\\frac{q A_t}{2\\\\pi K (D_b - D_m) N F_w} \\\\ln \\\\left( \\\\frac{R_i}{R_w} \\\\right) Well spacing With a well spacing equation one can calculate various design alternatives to arrive at the most attractive or economical solution for watertable control in agricultural land. The basic flow equation cannot be used for determining the well spacing in a partially penetrating well-field in a non-uniform and anisotropic aquifer, but one needs a numerical solution of more complicated equations.ILRI, 2000, Subsurface drainage by (tube)wells: Well spacing equations for fully and partially penetrating wells in uniform or layered aquifers with or without anisotropy and entrance resistance, 9 pp. Principles used in the \\"WellDrain\\" model.

He was co-author of the standard text on hydrodynamic lubrication and the Higginson Report on A levels. Early life Higginson was born in Leeds in 1929.Higginson, Sir Gordon Robert, Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920–2007; online edn, Oxford University Press, Dec 2012; accessed 2014_01_26 He was educated at Leeds Grammar School and the University of Leeds from which he received the degrees of BSc and PhD, both in Mechanical Engineering. Career Higginson worked briefly for the Ministry of Supply and was then appointed Lecturer at Leeds in 1956. In 1962 Higginson became an associate professor at the Royal Military College of Science, Shrivenham and in 1965 he was appointed to a chair in Civil Engineering in what is now the School of Engineering and Computing Sciences at the University of Durham.University of Leeds, Obituary His research interest was hydrodynamic lubrication and tribology, later extending to bio-engineering.Honorary doctoral oration, Loughborough University In the 1990s he served as chair of the engineering board of the Science and Engineering Research Council, the major grant-awarding body in UK academia.New Scientist He came to wider prominence when he chaired a committee set up to advise on the reform of the A Level system, producing the \\"Higginson Report\\" into the use of technology to support learning in colleges. Despite gaining widespread approval, the report was curtly rejected by the government, but many of the detailed proposals still enjoy some currency. Within the Further Education sector of England there was, arguably, a more successful \\"Higginson Report\\". The Learning and Technology Committee, chaired for the FEFC by Gordon Higginson, published its report in 1996. Known universally across English FE as the \\"Higginson Report\\", it made a number of recommendations for how the FEFC should go about supporting colleges' use of IT. It set a framework for Information & Learning Technology (ILT) development across the FE sector over following years. Following the privatisation of the railway system in the UK in the 1990s, he was the founding Chair of the Railway Heritage Committee, which supervised the transfer of historic artefacts and records to collecting institutions. Higginson was knighted in the 1992 New Year Honours. The University of Leeds conferred the degree of LLD honoris causa on him in 1994 and the University of Loughborough conferred the degree of DSc honoris causa in 2002.University of Loughborough, Presentation for DSc Higginson was also appointed a Deputy Lieutenant (DL). The University of Durham has both a lecture series, the annual Higginson Lecture, and a building named in his honour.Higginson Lectures Higginson was married from 1954 until her death in 1996 to Marjorie Rannie.

The leafy branchlets are oblong-elliptic in outline. Leaves are borne at 55-70° to branchlet axis. The pollen-cone is borne on the lower side and toward the distal end of terminal branchlets. The buds develop before the subtending leaves expand. Seeds cones are solitary. Seeds are obovoid, ovoid, or almost globose.

It is an understorey shrub, occurring in the shrub layer mixed with several genera of angiosperms such as Rhododendron, Camellia, Cotoneaster, Deutzia, Lonicera, Berberis, Buddleia, Euonymus, Hydrangea, Prunus and other species.http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/32331/0 retrieved 26 Jan 2015 Uses This species is exploited for its bark, twigs, roots and seeds, which contain anti-carcinogenic alkaloids, for medicinal purpose. It is also cultivated as an ornamental shrub both in and outside China. Status This species has a wide range and a large population, but it has experienced population reduction of more than 30% over the last 90–100 years due to exploitation of the plant for medicinal purposes and the loss of habitat due to deforestation by logging and agricultural expansion. The reduction is likely to continue, so this species is listed as Vulnerable based on the past declines.

It concerns three children who fall into the power of a \\"well witch\\" after stealing coins from a wishing well. They are given various powers to grant the wishes of others. While many of the wishes seem harmless they all eventually lead to perilous fates. It was originally published by Macmillan in the UK in 2007 and released in the United States a year later under the title Well Witched.HarperCollins book description Plot summary The story starts when Ryan, Chelle and Josh stranded without their bus fare home. Josh climbs into an old wishing well and retrieves some blackened coins. The next day, odd things begin to happen. Ryan sees a watery face in the mirror, and finds white lumps on his hands. Light bulbs explode in Josh's house, and Chelle's babbling becomes shockingly strange. Ryan has a vision of the well witch, and understands from her gargled words that, because they took the coins, they are now in her service. She has given each of them powers so that they can find other wishers, discover their wishes and help grant them. She also gives him the name of a nearby village. In the village, they realize that Chelle is speaking aloud the thoughts of a tea-shop man, Will Wurthers. They guess that he wished for a Harley-Davidson and persuade him to enter a competition to win at the fete where the winner of the motorcycle is to be announced, they hear the thoughts of an unhappy mime who wishes (they think) for fame. In their attempt to grant his wish they inadvertently cause a riot at the fete. Then they learn that Will has been badly injured in an accident. When Chelle overhears the thoughts of someone wishing for bloody revenge she gets frightened, and she and Ryan decide they should not grant any more wishes. Josh, however, is determined to hang on to his increasing power over all machines, metals and electronic devices. When he goes berserk and tries to kill Ryan's mother, Ryan thinks of a way to diminish the witch's power. But Josh also has a plan, and it nearly results in the death of them all. Characters Ryan: Ryan is a bright but quiet boy with only two friends: Chelle and Josh. He is known for his \\"upside down\\" way of seeing things. The well witch grants him a power of sight, which shows itself through the eyes growing on his hands like warts. He can see her when she chooses to communicate. He can see Josh's power in action, and sees people's wishes as translucent snakes growing from their chests. He also has insights into the situation of the well witch and into the true nature of wishes. Chelle: Chelle is an insecure girl with a tendency to babble. She hates getting in trouble and has a low opinion of herself. Her power is telepathic, as the thoughts of the people who have made wishes at the well spill uncontrollably out of her mouth when they are nearby. Josh: Josh is the leader of trio. He is confident, energetic and popular. However, he feels unwanted by his adoptive parents, who are getting divorced, and is jealous of Ryan's family. Josh's power is related to electromagnetism and affects metals, mechanisms and electronics. He is excited by his power as he gains more control over it, and is impatient of the moral qualms of Ryan and Chelle. Mother Leathertongue: Also known as the well witch, she is an ancient water spirit who lives at the bottom of the well. She gains power through the granting of wishes, but the complexity of the human world baffles her so that she has to work through surrogates. Her power can cause torrential rain and flooding. Miss Gossamer: Miss Gossamer is an elderly woman, a friend of Chelle's family, who recognises the trio's powers. The previous \\"Well's Angels\\" drowned her beloved baby daughter - because during her unwanted pregnancy she had wished not to have a child. On the edge of insanity, she believes that Chelle and the others are demons, not children. Awards The novel was nominated for the Carnegie Medal in 2008.

It catalogues both pagan beliefs and 33 gnostic Christian systems deemed heretical, making it a major source of information on contemporary opponents of Catholic orthodoxy.Kurt Rudolph, Gnosis: The Nature and History of Gnosticism (1983 English translation), p. 13. The first book, a synopsis of Greek philosophy, circulated separately in several manuscripts and was known as the Philosophoumena ( \\"philosophical teachings\\"), a title which some extend to the whole work. Books IV-X were recovered in 1842 in a manuscript at Mount Athos, while books II and III remain lost. The work was long attributed to the early Christian theologian Origen. Contents Hippolytus's work is divided into ten books, 8 of which have survived more or less intact. Books II and III, however, have not been unearthed, and their contents remain the subject of conjecture Hippolytus of Rome, Philosophumena, vol. 1. Ed. W.J. Sparrow Simpson, W.K. Lowther Clarke, trans. F. Legge. (New York: MacMillan, 1921), p. 65. Book I offers a summary of the thought of various ancient Greek philosophers. Catherine Osborne identifies Book I as being an important source of information on Pre-Socratic Philosophy.J.C.M. van Winden, review of Rethinking Early Greek Philosophy: Hippolytus of Rome and the Presocratics by Catherine Osborne, Vigiliae Christianae 42 (Sept. 1988), p. 295 Hippolytus's most extensive treatment is given to the works of Pythagoras, Plato, and Aristotle. An outline of the philosophies of the Brahmins of India, Zamolxis of Thrace and the Celtic druids and also of the mythological poetry of Hesiod is given here. Book IV details and seeks to refute the various beliefs and practices of various diviners and magicians, i.e., the Chaldeans, the Metoposcopists, the Magicians, and those who practice divination by astronomy. Hippolytus closes this book by explaining the connection he perceives between the Gnostic heresies of Valentinus and Simon Magus and certain ideas Hippolytus ascribes to Pythagoras, thus linking his discussion of Greek philosophy in Book I with his later arguments against Gnosticism. Book V concerns itself with the Ophite heresies. Hippolytus in particular identifies the Naassenes, the Peratae, the Sethians, and the beliefs of the heretic Justinus.Hippolytus of Rome, Philosophumena, vol. 1. Ed. W.J. Sparrow Simpson, W.K. Lowther Clarke, trans. F. Legge. (New York: MacMillan, 1921), p. 118. Once again, Hippolytus identifies the source of the Ophite error as being rooted in the philosophy of the ancients.Hippolytus of Rome, Philosophumena, vol. 1. Ed. W.J. Sparrow Simpson, W.K. Lowther Clarke, trans. F. Legge. (New York: MacMillan, 1921), pp. 119-120 In Chapter 2 of this book, he accuses the Naassenes of believing that the pagan god \\"Attis has been emasculated, that is, he has passed over from the earthly parts of the nether world to the everlasting substance above, where...there is neither female nor male, but a new creature, a new man, which is hermaphrodite\\" [trans. J. H. McMahon] and of conflating Jesus and Attis based on the Gospel of Thomas and the Gospel according to the Egyptians. In Book VI, Hippolytus resumes his attack begun at the end of Book IV against Simon Magus and Valentinus. He sketches out their ideas, again affirming the source of their error to be the teaching of Pythagoras.Hippolytus of Rome, Philosophumena, vol. 2. Ed. W.J. Sparrow Simpson, W.K. Lowther Clarke, trans. F. Legge. (New York: MacMillan, 1921), p. 36. Hippolytus devotes the remainder of the book to discussing the heresies of Valentinus' supposed followers. Book VII challenges the teachings of such heretics as Basilides and his disciple Saturnilus, Marcion of Sinope, and Carpocrates of Alexandria, among others. These heresiarchs all held varying opinions on the God of the Old Testament, from Saturnilus, who Hippolytus states believed that \\"the God of the Jews is one of the angels\\", directly opposed by Christ, to Carpocrates who asserted that the Father was for the most part aloof from physical creation, which had been formed by his angels.Hippolytus of Rome, Philosophumena, vol. 2. Ed. W.J. Sparrow Simpson, W.K. Lowther Clarke, trans. F. Legge. (New York: MacMillan, 1921), pp. 81, 90-91. A discussion of the heretical Docetae begins Hippolytus' Book VIII. Who exactly the Docetae were is unclear, though Hippolytus seems to make a distinction between this group and others who considered Jesus to exist merely in appearance, the doctrine with to which the term \\"Docetism\\" is now affixed.Hippolytus of Rome, Philosophumena, vol. 2. Ed. W.J. Sparrow Simpson, W.K. Lowther Clarke, trans. F. Legge. (New York: MacMillan, 1921), footnote, p. 98 Hippolytus associates this heresy with a misinterpretation of the Parable of the Sower of Matthew's Gospel and a belief that Christ's soul was separated from his body at his Crucifixion.Hippolytus of Rome, Philosophumena, vol. 2. Ed. W.J. Sparrow Simpson, W.K. Lowther Clarke, trans. F. Legge. (New York: MacMillan, 1921), pp. 101, 104. Hippolytus proceeds to explain and argue against the Gnostics Monoimus, Tatian, and Hermogenes, before digressing from the Gnostic theme to refute the practices of the Quartodecimans.Hippolytus of Rome, Philosophumena, vol. 2. Ed. W.J. Sparrow Simpson, W.K. Lowther Clarke, trans. F. Legge. (New York: MacMillan, 1921), pp. 106-113. He likewise condemns the \\"Phrygians\\", i.e., the followers of Montanus and the Gnostic heresy of the Encratites.Hippolytus of Rome, Philosophumena, vol. 2. Ed. W.J. Sparrow Simpson, W.K. Lowther Clarke, trans. F. Legge. (New York: MacMillan, 1921), pp. 113-116 Book IX begins with a refutation of the heresy of Noetus. In this particular error, Hippolytus implicates the now-canonised popes Zephyrinus and Callixtus I.Hippolytus of Rome, Philosophumena, vol. 2. Ed. W.J. Sparrow Simpson, W.K. Lowther Clarke, trans. F. Legge. (New York: MacMillan, 1921), p. 118 This theme of Hippolytus' conflict with the papacy is expanded upon in the second chapter of Book IX, which deals in particular with the errors of Pope Callixtus, whom Hippolytus identifies as a \\"sorcerer\\".Hippolytus of Rome, Philosophumena, vol. 2. Ed. W.J. Sparrow Simpson, W.K. Lowther Clarke, trans. F. Legge.

W.J. Sparrow Simpson, W.K. Lowther Clarke, trans. F. Legge. (New York: MacMillan, 1921), pp. 132-138 Book IX concludes with a summary of the heresy of the Jews, whom Hippolytus divides into Pharisees, Sadducees, and Essenes.Hippolytus of Rome, Philosophumena, vol. 2. Ed. W.J. Sparrow Simpson, W.K. Lowther Clarke, trans. F. Legge. (New York: MacMillan, 1921), pp. 138-148 Book X concludes the work with Hippolytus' summary of what he has written.Hippolytus of Rome, Philosophumena, vol. 2. Ed. W.J. Sparrow Simpson, W.K.

He was an important figure in the history of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and of the German political labour movement. After the German Revolution of 1918-19 he was a Minister without portfolio in the government of Philipp Scheidemann, before becoming Minister of the Interior in June 1919 in the succeeding government headed by Gustav Bauer. David remained in that position until October of that year. David was also briefly the first president of the Weimar National Assembly which drew up the Weimar Constitution and ratified the Treaty of Versailles in 1919. Biography Early life Eduard David was born on 11 June 1863 in Ediger/Mosel as the son of Johann Heinrich David, a Prussian civil servant, and his wife Wilhelmine Elisabeth (née Werner). After completing a four-year commercial apprenticeship (kaufmännische Lehre), David studied at the university at Giessen where he was introduced to socialist ideals. He worked as a teacher at a gymnasium and establishing a newspaper, the Mitteldeutsche Sonntagszeitung, in 1893. David's support for the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) led to his dismissal from the civil service in 1894. David was married twice. In 1896, he married Gertrud Swiderski (one daughter) and in 1911 Hermine Schmidt (one son). Political career In the 1890s, David became a proponent of agricultural policies favouring small holdings, arguing for their viability in a series of articles in the Sozialdemokrat in August and September 1894. David argued against the traditional Marxist idea that small landholdings would increasingly be replaced by large estates, marking David as among the first Revisionists in his party. This journalism on the agrarian question would later expanded into his major book-length work, Sozialismus und Landwirtschaft (Socialism and Agriculture), in 1903. From 1896, David was a member of the Landtag of Hesse and after 1903 a member of the Reichstag for the SPD. He was one of the leading politicians of the \\"Majority\\" SPD when the party split during the First World War and was instrumental in framing his party's policy stand on the war. Government ministry In October 1918, when the SPD became part of the Imperial government for the first time under the new chancellor Max von Baden, David became Under Secretary at the Foreign Office. In February 1919, David was elected president of the new National Assembly, but as part of a deal establishing the first democratically elected government, the Scheidemann cabinet. He relinquished that post in favour of Constantin Fehrenbach (Zentrum) and became Minister without Portfolio under the new Ministerpräsident, Philipp Scheidemann (SPD). After Scheidemann's cabinet resigned in June 1919 in protest over the stipulations of the Treaty of Versailles, a new government was formed by Gustav Bauer (SPD) and David became Reichsminister des Innern (Minister of the Interior), a position he held from 21 June to 4 October 1919. In early October, the German Democratic Party (DDP) which had left the coalition government in June rejoined, thus reestablishing the Weimar Coalition of SPD, DDP and Zentrum. Erich Koch-Weser (DDP) took over as Minister of the Interior and David once again was Minister without Portfolio. He retained this position in the first cabinet of Hermann Müller, who formed the new government when the Cabinet Bauer resigned in March 1920. Later activities In 1922, David was appointed Reichsbevollmächtigter in Hesse and from 1923 to 1927 he taught political sciences at what was then the Technische Hochschule Darmstadt. He died on 24 December 1930 in Berlin. Death and legacy Eduard David died in Berlin on December 24, 1930. David is today considered a key figure in the history of the political labour movement in Germany as he influenced the development of the SPD in the pre-World War I period as one of the leading advocates of reformist policies.

After coming to power, King Alfonso IX, faced an attack by his two neighbours, Castile and Portugal, decided to summon the Curia regis. This was a mediæval organisation composed of aristocrats and bishops, but because of the seriousness of the situation and the need to maximise political support, Alfonso IX took the decision to also call the representatives of the urban middle class from the most important cities of the kingdom to the assembly.International Memory of the World Register - The Decreta of León of 1188 - The oldest documentary manifestation of the European parliamentary system However, all these meetings were exceptional and did not lead to a regular attendance of town representatives in the Curiae.

He is best known for his detective stories, which were published under the pen name Stein Riverton and translated to several languages, including German and English. Elvestad was born as Kristoffer Elvestad Svendsen, in Fredrikshald (now Halden), a small town near the Swedish border. After, as a young office boy, embezzling money from his employer, he changed his name and started a new life as a journalist in Kristiania (Oslo). As a reporter he often staged his own sensations. Among his most famous stunts, was spending a day in a circus lion's cage. But he was also the first foreign reporter to interview Adolf Hitler (whom he, despite his fascist sympathies, described as \\"a dangerous man\\"). He started writing crime stories, first as semi-documentary reports from the view of the reporter or as told by the retired police detective Asbjørn Krag (modelled on one or two well-known policemen). Soon Krag was developed into a classical private detective (though still with excellent connections to the police force). In 1908 Elvestad (under the pen name Kristian F. Biller) created the police detective Knut Gribb: a character that was taken over by several other writers in various magazines and series of paperbacks, and still exists. Some of Elvestad's Gribb mysteries were later published as Asbjørn Krag books, with the Riverton name on the cover. While this Krag, like Gribb, is a tough, clean-shaven policeman, the classical Krag is a thoughtful and somewhat mysterious, balding man in early middle age, wearing a goatee and pince-nez. Riverton's masterpiece was published already in 1909: Jernvognen (The Iron Chariot). This is a thriller, narrated in a neo-romantic style reminiscent of Knut Hamsun by a guest at a sea-side hotel in Southern Norway. Two violent deaths are connected to a local ghost legend. The possible connections puzzles the narrator, and he find himself threatened by the visiting detective, Krag. The narrative is complex, with a point of view that lets the author juggle with several levels of knowledge: What puzzles the reader might, or might not also puzzle the narrator and the murderer. In this novel, Elvestad used a certain narrative trick that was later ascribed to Agatha Christie. In later thrillers (of which some were published under his real name) Elvestad plays on Freudian theories of the sub-conscious. In his latest mysteries he abandon the Krag character (who was nameless in books attributed to Elvestad) and aims at a more modern, realistic style. Though some of Riverton/Elvestad's stories are high class thrillers, the quality of his work varies. The Norwegian Riverton Prize is named after him.

She made her first appearance in 2000 before leaving in 2004. The character then briefly returned in October 2007. Casting Elize du Toit was cast in the Hollyoaks: On the Pull campaign to find new young actors to appear in the show during the Edinburgh auditions where he was called back for further auditions in Liverpool and the role of Izzy was created for her. The other three chosen were Andrew Somerville (Theo Sankofa), Lesley Johnston (Laura Burns) and Marcus Patric (Ben Davies). In 2004, it was reported du Toit had been axed from the show in a soap \\"massacre\\". Storylines Izzy arrived in Hollyoaks as a student and as Tony Hutchinson’s (Nick Pickard) tenant. She was saved from drowning in the college swimming pool by Adam Morgan (David Brown). Adam instantly fell in love with Izzy, and dumped Geri Hudson (Joanna Taylor) for her. Thus began a war of words between Geri and Izzy. Izzy started dating Adam, but lasted a short while after discovering he had exposed her by putting cameras up in Tony’s house for a film project, and Geri had also been involved. Izzy's and Geri's rivalry continued for over a year, climaxing in their one-on-one combat in Game 4 IT (a charity event), when Geri managed to beat Izzy. Izzy then went on to move at The Dog in The Pond, and had also started working there. She started dating hard man Dan Hunter (Andrew McNair), but that did not work out because he was not honest with her. Izzy went on to build a friendly rivalry with fireman Ben where she got him to believe that she liked to have sex in public places. She took him to an empty top of a bus, blindfolded him, and made him take his clothes off, leaving him naked in the streets of Chester. From there on, Izzy and Ben began to complete each other, but on a serious side, things began to fall downhill for Izzy. Her parents' marriage split up and she was repeatedly harassed by Scott Anderson (Daniel Hyde). She confided a lot in Tony, who supported her through difficult times, and shortly the pair became Hollyoaks's most unlikely couple. However, it was not to last when Tony’s ex-fiancée Julie Matthews returned and started working with Tony at Il Gnosh. Unexpectedly Izzy got engaged with Tony, but Izzy had to make a promise to Tony that she would keep it a secret. Izzy was horrified when she discovered that Tony was also engaged to Julie. This led to Izzy dumping him. Her harassment from Scott continued when he started telling her how sorry he was and that he wanted to be given another chance. Scott started pressuring her until Ben came to her rescue. From there on, Izzy began to form a strong bond with Ben as the pair tried to wind each other up, but soon Izzy started falling for Ben. It was pride getting in her way of asking Ben out, however. Having underachieved with a 2:2 degree, Izzy decided to move on from Hollyoaks and go travelling with Chloe. After two months, Izzy returned to Hollyoaks as she realised that she had to make a go of things with Ben, but was hurt when Ben did not pay much attention on her return. Having a minor accident outside Il Gnosh, Ben had rushed to Izzy's bedside at hospital and told her that he wanted to marry her. The pair finally got together as they awaited for their wedding, as Izzy had introduced a sex ban on Ben until their wedding day. Scott was desperate for Izzy not to marry Ben, and the night before her wedding day, in a desperate attempt for her not to marry Ben, Scott confessed to Izzy that Ben slept with Emma Chambers (Georgina Redhead) and she is pregnant with his child. Shocked and in disbelief, Izzy confronted Ben on their wedding day, and he admitted that he slept with Emma while Izzy was travelling. Not sure what to do, Izzy decided to give Ben another chance as the pair tied the knot. Having come back from her honeymoon, Izzy found it more difficult than she thought it would be to deal with the attention that Ben was giving to Emma over their child Arthur. Convinced that the only way to get Ben's attention was to fall pregnant, Izzy became pregnant, but within two months she lost their child. Suffering and depressed, Izzy could not cope with the depression and further suffered when she was told by the doctor that she could not have children. Izzy felt that she could not give Ben what she wanted and decided to do the unthinkable by sleeping with Scott, in a bid to end all ties with Ben. She told a devastated Ben about her actions, leading him to throw her out. A few weeks later, both Scott and Ben called on Izzy’s doorstep, each pleading Izzy to give them another chance. Izzy told Scott she wanted nothing to do with him, while she told Ben that their marriage was over but that she would always love him. For over three years, Izzy was a dominating character of the show. She eventually moved on from the show after her eventful time in Hollyoaks. She returned to Hollyoaks in October 2007 to visit her old flame Tony Hutchinson on his 30th Birthday. She clashed with his girlfriend Jacqui McQueen (Claire Cooper) after they were wearing the same dress, but they eventually smoothed things over. She comforted Jacqui about her infertility, saying she had been in the same place when she was married to Ben, but Tony and Jacqui had a much stronger relationship than she had with Ben. Jacqui apologized for misjudging Izzy. Reception Virgin Media profiled some of Hollyoaks' \\"hottest females\\" in their opinion, of Izzy they stated: \\"Izzy was the poshest totty Hollyoaks has ever seen.

It ranges through northeastern China, the Russian Far East, and the Korean Peninsula, but is only sporadically distributed within this range. Within South Korea, it is found chiefly in the high mountain valleys of Gangwon province, including the Gwangdeoksan and Daeseongsan regions. The adults feed on spiders, grubs, and insects. Common names include Fischer's clawed salamander and long-tailed clawed salamander. It has 78 chromosomes in total (27 pairs of microchromosomes, six pairs of medium-sized chromosomes, and six pairs of large chromosomes). Onychodactylus fischeri is known to live at elevations up to 1000 m, and favors thickly-vegetated stretches of pebble- bottomed mountain streams, with little direct sunlight. It may also be found near underground springs. The mating season is from mid-March to mid-May. The eggs are laid in streams; the aquatic larvae emerge after approximately 5 weeks. It is threatened by habitat change, such as tree felling in stream headwaters. The adult males of the species are 17–18 cm long; adult females are slightly longer, 18–19 cm. The dorsal aspect is yellowish brown, with bands of dark brown spots throughout. The ventral aspect is lighter in color, without spots. The head is small, flat and oval. The skin is smooth overall, but with one groove running along the center of the back. The tail is longer than the head and body combined, a fact from which the salamander takes its common name.

It has been said that \\"Hume marks the culmination of the Scottish humanist tradition.\\" Confusion is possible with David Hume or Home, Scottish minister at Duras in France, a contemporary: they had quite different views on the union with England. Life He was the second son of Sir David Hume or Home, seventh baron of Wedderburn, a Roman Catholic traditionalist of the Merse (now Berwickshire), who had married an active Calvinist wife in Mary Johnston of Elphinstone. He studied at Dunbar grammar school, under Andrew Simson. He then entered the University of St Andrews in 1578, and after a course of study there travelled on the continent. From France he went on to Geneva, intending to travel to Italy. Hume was recalled to Scotland by the serious illness of his elder brother George, returning about 1581. Both brothers supported the Ruthven raid of 1582. In 1583 he was residing as private secretary with his relative Archibald Douglas, 8th Earl of Angus, who was ordered, after James VI withdrew his confidence from the Ruthven lords, to remain in the north of Scotland. During the exile of the Ruthven party at Newcastle, Hume was in London, ostensibly studying, but actively interesting himself in Angus and his cause. The lords, with Hume, returned to Scotland in 1585, and between that date and 1588, when Angus died. In later life Hume devoted himself to literature on his property of Gowkscroft, a farming hamlet 2 miles to the north of Abbey St. Bathans, in the Lammermuir Hills, Berwickshire, which he renamed Godscroft, and styled himself Theagrius when he figured as a Latin poet. Works Political and religious writings Hume supported his patron Angus's policy in a series of letters (preserved in the History of the Houses of Douglas and Angus) on the doctrine of obedience to princes. A discussion of a sermon on the same theme by the Rev. John Craig is the subject of Conference betwixt the Erle of Angus and Mr. David Hume, which is printed in David Calderwood's History of the Kirk of Scotland. Hume contests in this dialogue, based on actual conversation, the political theories of Jean Bodin and Adam Blackwood. In 1605 a union tract by Robert Pont suggested Hume's treatise De Unione Insulæ Britanniæ, a study in how to effect the closer political union of Scotland and England. The first part Tractatus I. was published in London (1605). In terms of the Jacobean debate on the Union, Hume went further than anyone else in looking to a unified \\"British society\\" to result from the Union of the Crowns of 1603. On the relative values of episcopacy and presbytery, Hume was a persistent polemicist in discussing the theme: first with James Law, bishop of Orkney, from 1608 to 1611; and secondly, in 1613, with William Cowper, bishop of Galloway. He was also responsible about the same time for De Episcopatu, 1 May 1609, Patricio Simsono, to Patrick Simson. Hume's other major Latin prose writings are his unpublished attack on William Camden for his depreciatory view of Scotland, written in 1617—Cambdenia; id est, Examen nonnullorum a Gulielmo Cambreno in \\"Britannia,\\"—and a work dedicated to Charles I (Paris, 1626), entitled Apologia Basilica; seu Machiavelli Ingenium Examinatum, in libro quem inscripsit Princeps. Neo-Latin poetry Hume wrote Latin poems when very young, and received the commendation of George Buchanan. Buchanan was an intellectual leader for the Scottish Presbyterians, among whom Hume was prominent, and as a close a follower as Buchanan had. In the end he showed dislike for the \\"angry\\" Buchanan, who had a quite different view of the Douglas family. Hume's Daphn-Amaryllis was a celebration of Anglo-Scottish union, printed in Edinburgh and London editions, in 1603–5. It consists of four eclogues, and drew on the Liber Pluscardensis and John Mair's Historia, in a setting of \\"leonine prophecy\\". In citing this poem in his second union Tractatus, Hume explicitly references both the Lion of Judah (associated with the Davidic Kingdom), and the Lion of Scotland, linking both with the \\"Lion of the North\\" prophecy of Paul Grebner; with a simple heraldic code, he also indicated the expansionism of the new kingdom, desiring the removal of the tressure bordering the Scottish lion rampant (harking back to the time of James III of Scotland). The Lusus Poetici (1605) were ultimately incorporated in Arthur Johnston's Deliciæ Poetarum Scotorum (1637). When Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales died, Hume wrote a memorial tribute entitled Henrici Principis Justa, and in 1617 he welcomed the king back to Scotland in his Regi suo Gratulatio. His collected Latin poems were twice issued in Paris, in 1632 and 1639, the second time with additions under the care of his son James, and with the title: Davidis Humii Wedderburnensis Poemata Omnia. Accessere ad finem Unio Britannica et Prœlium ad Lipsiam soluta oratione. Family history Hume was a partisan panegyricist of the Douglas family. He is also said to have \\"plundered Scottish history for exemplars\\" within the Douglases, and with the aim of encouraging military services to the king. Arthur Williamson has argued that \\"Scots wrote histories of great families as general histories of Scotland\\". A grandson of Alison Douglas, herself a granddaughter of Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Angus, Hume has as his main patron William Douglas, 11th Earl of Angus, later the 1st Marquess of Douglas. Hume's History of the House and Race of Douglas and Angus was printed at Edinburgh in 1644 by Evan Tyler, the king's printer. He is thought to have finished the history between 1625 and 1630 (around the year of his death). The political message of the work includes the idea that direct action against \\"evil advisers\\" of a king is permissible to defend customary rights; and even against the king. The title- pages of early copies vary, with some having the title A Generall History of Scotland, together with a particular History of the Houses of Douglas and Angus. Confusion arose when the editor, Anna Hume, encountered opposition of Angus, who resented the use which Hume had made of some of the material in the family archives. The work begins with Sholto Douglas, conqueror of Donald Bane, and concludes with Archibald Douglas, 8th Earl of Angus, who is eulogised in a Latin ode and numerous elegiacs. Another manuscript history of the family brings the record close to the death of William Douglas, 10th Earl of Angus, in 1611, and is ascribed to that earl. The tenth earl's son, William Douglas, is said to have threatened its publication in order that Hume's work might be superseded, due to subjective and accuracy in some of his writings. Hume's History of the House of Wedderburn, written by a Son of the Family, in the year 1611, was a Latin eulogy, Davidis Humii de Familia Humia Wedderburnensi Liber. It begins with David, the first laird of Wedderburn, about the end of the fourteenth century. It closes with an account of Hume's own early career in connection with that of his elder brother, to whom, along with the Earl of Home, it is dedicated. It remained in manuscript till 1839, when it was printed by the Abbotsford Club.Davidis Humii de Familia Humia Wedderburnensi Liber (1839); archive.org. Family Hume married in 1594 Barbara Johnston, widow of his friend James Haldane. They had five children. His daughter Anna Hume was known as an editor, and his son ( 1630) as a mathematician.

He is a conservative Christian, an opponent to the scientific theory of anthropogenic climate change, and has been described as a \\"professional controversialist\\". Early career Wishart went to Onslow College, and studied journalism at Wellington Polytechnic, graduating in 1982. He has worked for Radio Windy, Radio Hauraki, Radio Pacific, TV3 and Television New Zealand. Winebox affair In 1992, New Zealand politician Winston Peters began raising a series of allegations in Parliament about prominent business leaders trying to bribe politicians. Wishart was assigned by the TV3 network to report on the case, and came into possession of some confidential business transaction papers that became popularly known as \\"The Winebox documents\\" because they had first turned up in an old wine carton. The documents detailed extensive tax avoidance and tax evasion schemes run through Cook Islands offshore companies associated with an entity part owned by the New Zealand Government state bank, the Bank of New Zealand, and merchant bank Fay Richwhite, whose principals Sir Michael Fay and David Richwhite were closely connected to both the Labour and National political parties. Although Winston Peters and other financial journalists and newspapers also had copies of the Winebox documents, it was Wishart who first identified the key \\"Magnum\\" and \\"JIF\\" transactions,The Independent Business Weekly, \\"Vindicated\\", 25 August 1999 later confirmed by the Privy Council and the New Zealand Court of Appeal to be prima facie criminal fraud. against the revenues of New Zealand and Japan respectively.NZPA, \\"Peters weeps as winebox findings declared invalid\\", 20 August 1999 Wishart continued working on the project as a special investigation for TVNZ, to be carried out in secret with the assistance of Frontline journalist Michael Wilson and producers Carol Hirschfeld and Mark Champion. The documentary was originally scheduled to air in December 1993, but was prevented from going to air by TVNZ management after the intervention of the TVNZ board of directors. Wishart and his colleagues decided to leak details of the banned programme to other news media, turning the blackout into a public issue. The network was enjoined to an injunction forbidding broadcast of the programme, but the leak of further information made the gagging writ worthless and the documentary finally aired in June 1994 as a special primetime two-hour broadcast. The revelations forced the establishment of a Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Winebox transactions. A senior Inland Revenue Department investigator, Tony Loo, subsequently told the Commission of Inquiry that he and other IRD staff did not understand how the transactions had worked until they watched Wishart's documentary on TV.The Independent Business Weekly, \\"Editorial\\", 28 April 1999 Although the Commission report initially exonerated the transactions, the Commission findings were overturned by New Zealand's highest court which found the transactions were prima facie fraudulent and that the commission had made substantial errors in finding otherwise.New Zealand Listener, \\"Magnum Force\\", 4 September 1999 Ian Wishart published three books detailing his investigations and the outcome: The Paradise Conspiracy (Howling at the Moon, 1995), The Vintage Winebox Guide (Howling at the Moon, 1996), and The Paradise Conspiracy 2 (Howling at the Moon, 1999). Part of Wishart's first book, The Paradise Conspiracy, was loosely reworked as a feature film, Spooked, starring Cliff Curtis and directed by Geoff Murphy. Post-TV career After leaving TVNZ, Wishart covered the Winebox enquiry for the National Business Review, the Waikato Times, the Evening Post, the Christchurch Press and other daily newspapers. He has also written for the New Zealand Herald, The Sunday Star- Times and Metro magazine. In 1997 he was named as the host of the New Zealand version of reality series Real TV, which screened on the TV3 network. In 2000, Wishart began hosting talk radio shifts on the Radio Pacific network, taking over as regular evening host in the 7pm to 10pm slot. On one occasion he broadcast the phone numbers of Green Party MPs and urged his listeners to make protest calls, jamming the party's phone lines. Around this time, Wishart became a born-again Christian. Publishing operations Wishart established his own publishing company, Howling at the Moon, in 1995. A subsidiary company was established in 1999 to publish the monthly Investigate magazine. Wishart is the editor of Investigate magazine, which addresses controversial current affairs issues from a conservative Christian editorial standpoint. It drew mainstream attention for articles critical of policies and members of the centre-left Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand, particularly the interview with former Cabinet Minister John Tamihere, which ended his prospects of a return to Cabinet. Howling at the Moon has published 15 of Wishart's books, as well as books by other authors, mostly general non-fiction/current affairs titles. Wishart's books are listed in full below. They include: * Eve's Bite (2007)Ian Wishart, Eve's Bite (2007) page? The book argues that New Zealand society is being \\"poisoned\\" and the Western world as a whole undermined \\"by seductive and destructive philosophies and social engineering that within the space of a generation have intellectually crippled the greatest civilisation the world has ever seen\\". * The Divinity Code, (2007), a pro-creationist response to the atheist arguments of Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens. * Absolute Power (2008),Ian Wishart, Absolute Power: The Helen Clark Years (2008) concerning Helen Clark's years as Prime Minister. * Air Con (2009)Ian Wishart, Air Con (2009) The book argues that man-made climate change is not significant against the scale of natural forces, and that climate change is being used primarily as a revenue-generating exercise by the climate- industrial complex. * Arthur Allan Thomas: The Inside Story (2010), reviewing the murders of Harvey and Jeannette Crewe. In it, Wishart presented new evidence on the role of a police officer, Detective Lenrick Johnston, and suggested he may have been the killer of the South Auckland farmers. * The Great Divide (2012), which argues that some of New Zealand's earliest residents might have arrived before the Polynesians. In November 2011, Wishart published the book The Hunt, co-authored with George London, chronicling the search for two children kidnapped off a London street in 1981 and never seen again. The day the book was published, one of the children made contact with their mother for the first time in 30 years. Lindsay Smallbone, the former husband of George London's wife, sued the authors for defamation in 2013 over the book's description of Mr Smallbone as sexually perverse, voyeuristic and otherwise deviant. The jury found that the material was published recklessly, and awarded NZ$270,000 in damages. The win was short-lived however. On the next working day the judge recalled the verdict and eventually ordered a full retrial after overturning the jury decision. Smallbone appealed to the Court of Appeal and then the Supreme Court but lost both appeals. Five of Wishart's books—The Paradise Conspiracy, Lawyers, Guns & Money, The Paradise Conspiracy II, Absolute Power and Air Con—have achieved number one bestseller status on the NZ Booksellers national \\"Bestsellers\\" list, while several more-Daylight Robbery, The Vintage Winebox Guide, Ben & Olivia, Eve's Bite and Arthur Allan Thomas-reached No.2 on the list. Role in \\"Climategate\\" controversy In November 2009 Wishart became involved in the \\"Climategate\\" controversy when he obtained confirmation that leaked emails from the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit were genuine, after reaching CRU's Phil Jones by phone. Wishart published stories on both the Investigate magazine blogsite \\"The Briefing Room\\" and in the online newspaper TGIF Edition confirming the authenticity of the emails, which formed the basis for other news reports on the developing story worldwide. Personal life Wishart has married twice, and has children from his first and second marriages. He and his second wife, Heidi, are Anglicans, Wishart having formerly been an atheist. He is also a proponent of intelligent design.

Graf (p786) Tinsel wire is commonly used in cords of telephones, handsets, headphones, and small electrical appliances. It is far more resistant to metal fatigue failure than either stranded wire or solid wire. Construction Tinsel wire is produced by wrapping several strands of thin metal foil around a flexible nylon or textile core. Because the foil is very thin, the bend radius imposed on the foil is much greater than the thickness of the foil, leading to a low probability of metal fatigue. Meanwhile, the core provides high tensile strength without impairing flexibility. Typically, multiple tinsel wires are jacketed with an insulating layer to form one conductor. A cord is formed from several conductors in either a round profile or a flat cable. Connections Tinsel wire is commonly connected to equipment with crimped terminal lugs that pierce the insulation to make contact with the metal ribbons, rather than stripping insulation. Separated from the core, the individual ribbons are relatively fragile, and the core can be damaged by high temperatures. These factors make it difficult or impractical to terminate tinsel wire by soldering during equipment manufacture, although soldering is possible, with some difficulty, to repair a failed connection. However, the conductors tend to break at their junction with the rigid solder. Applications Tinsel wires or cords are used for telephony and audio applications in which frequent bending of electric cords occurs, such as for headsets and telephone handsets. It is also used in power cords for small appliances such as electric shavers or clocks, where stranded cable conductors of adequate mechanical size would be too stiff.G. F. Moore (ed) Electric cables handbook third edition,Blackwell Science,1997 , page 234 Tinsel cords are recognized as type TPT or TST in the US and Canadian electrical codes, and are rated at 0.5 amperes.

While many of his vocal pieces were written for minstrel shows, the simple but effective melodies of his \\"songs for the hearth and home\\" are widely popular, often mistaken for American folksongs. By the end of the 19th century, serious American composers were travelling to European countries to study, especially with German and French composition teachers, and they gained a thorough understanding of Romantic style, including an understanding of the Lieder tradition.

He previously played for the South Sydney Rabbitohs in the National Rugby League. He was a part of the Rabbitohs squad that won the 2014 NRL Premiership, however despite being named as starting hooker, was ruled out for the final due to suspension. Luke is a member of the World Cup- winning New Zealand team that beat Australia in the 2008 Final. Personal life Luke was born in Hāwera, Taranaki, New Zealand. Luke's wife Mickayela is a cousin of fellow Kiwi rugby league international Sonny Bill Williams, with whom he also played in the juniors at the Bulldogs. Luke is a cousin of England international Rangi Chase. He is of Irish and Māori descent. Playing career Prior to making his professional debut, Luke played Jersey Flegg Cup for Canterbury-Bankstown alongside fellow New Zealander and future Kiwis teammate Sonny Bill Williams. Luke made his NRL debut for the South Sydney Rabbitohs in round 12 of the 2007 NRL season against the Melbourne Storm at Olympic Park Stadium, coming off the bench. Luke had his first NRL start in round 19 Against the North Queensland Cowboys, playing at hooker. He scored his first NRL try and was awarded the Brut Man of the Match award for his efforts. Luke tasted finals football in his debut year, coming off the bench in the Rabbitohs 30 – 6 loss to the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles. He was awarded the John Sattler Rookie of the Year at the South Sydney annual Red and Green Ball and presentation night held at the AJC function centre at Randwick Racecourse Sydney. He also was second only to Israel Folau in the Dally M Rookie of the Year award. His year was capped off by being named in the Train on Squad for the New Zealand national rugby league team. Luke started the 2008 season well but a broken bone in his hand in the round 3 loss to the Penrith Panthers sidelined him for 4 weeks. He came back in round 7 against the Brisbane Broncos and added some much needed spark to the team but they came up short going down 32 – 18. His return from injury came just in time for him to make his test debut for the Kiwis for the ANZAC day test at the SCG. He started the game at hooker and had a solid debut. Luke was named at halfback for the round 8 clash against the North Queensland Cowboys to accommodate both himself and fellow hooker George Ndaira in the starting side. During round 13 against The Warriors, Luke was instrumental for Souths, including setting up a great try to put Souths ahead at half time, and was named Man of the Match. In round 14 against the Gold Coast Luke scored his first career double and slotted the match winning penalty for a 24–23 victory. Issac Luke and Adam Blair performing the Haka for New Zealand. Luke at the 2012 Dally M Awards with Mikayla Watts In August 2008, Luke was named in the New Zealand training squad for the 2008 Rugby League World Cup, and in October 2008, he was named in the final 24-man Kiwi squad. Luke was considered one of the 2008 Rugby League World Cup tournament's 'Players to Watch' by the NRL Live blog. He was then a crucial part of the Kiwi side that lifted the World Cup in 2008, beating Australia 34 – 20 before over 50,000 spectators at Brisbane's Lang Park. Also in 2008, he was named in the Taranaki Rugby League Team of the Century. Luke made 68 NRL appearances for Souths in the 2009, 2010 and 2011 seasons. In none of those seasons did Souths qualify for the finals series. He represented New Zealand in the 2009, 2010 and 2011 Four Nations tournaments, playing off the substitutes bench for the Kiwis' win of the 2010 edition. For the 2010 Anzac Test, Luke was selected to play for New Zealand at hooker in their loss against Australia. Luke's 2011 Four Nations tournament ended in controversy after he was criticised for a series of cynical tackles on opposing players. Luke admitted that in a match against England, he had attempted to break the leg of Rangi Chase, England's New Zealand-born half- back. For the 2013 Anzac Test, Luke was selected to play for New Zealand at hooker in their loss again Australia. In the 2014 NRL season, Luke made 18 appearances as Souths reached their first grand final in 43 years. Luke missed out on playing in the club's first premiership victory in 43 years as he was suspended from playing in the grand final after being found guilty of using a dangerous tackle on Sydney Roosters player Sonny Bill Williams in the preliminary final. Luke was initially not allowed by the NRL to appear in the club's team photo for the grand final nor take to the field for the lap of honour but they reversed the decision for Luke on this occasion. Following the grand final victory, Souths head coach Michael Maguire handed his premiership ring to Luke. In May 2015, Luke signed with the New Zealand Warriors for three seasons, beginning in 2016. He co-captained the New Zealand national rugby league team on their 2015 tour of Great Britain. On 19 November 2019, it was announced that Luke had signed a one-year deal to join St. George Illawarra for the 2020 NRL season. Luke posted a message on his Twitter account saying \\"St George Dragons On way\\". On 13 June 2020 Luke departed St. George for the Brisbane Broncos. Luke had played just three games with the club, failing to register a win with the team. There were suggestions that Luke left due to being frustrated with game time but Luke later spoke to the media saying \\"With support from the club and their understanding they were happy to release me to take an opportunity in Brisbane where my family and I were going to live after footy finished. This has nothing to do with what has been going on here and I advise youse (sic) all to wake yoursleves up. \\"I’m doing this for my family. Luke played 12 games for Brisbane in the 2020 NRL season after his mid-season switch from St. George as the Broncos finished with the wooden spoon for the first time in Brisbane's history.

He preached a millenarian philosophy, emphasizing the imminent coming of the Buddha Maitreya. A martial arts master and self-taught physician, Wang taught his followers yoga, meditation, and the ability to fast for very long periods by drinking purified water. His group became known as the \\"Pure Water Sect\\", and by 1774 numbered several thousand. Having told the sect that he was the reincarnation of Maitreya and was destined to become Emperor of China, he mobilized his followers and marched on the city of Shouzhang on 3 October 1774. With the help of confederates inside the city gates, the rebels quickly seized the city and ransacked the treasury and granary. They held the city for a few days only, before abandoning it to attack the city of Yangku. Yangku was easily captured, as the local garrison was marching to relieve Shouzhang, which the local authorities believed was still in rebel hands. The rebels then moved on to capture the towns of Tangyi and then Liulin with ease, and from there they marched on to Linqing, a large and strategically important city. Before reaching Linqing, Wang Lun's rebels defeated Qing dynasty troops at every engagement, and rumor spread that the rebels practiced invulnerability magic. Many city officials of Linqing fled in terror before the White Lotus rebels arrived at the city on 11 October. Over the next few weeks, Wang Lun's forces besieged the city, but the Qing defenses commanded by Qin Zhenjun effectively resisted the attack. Eyewitnesses reported that rebel troops fought fiercely even when there seemed to be no hope. Wang Lun's young concubine Wu Sannian reportedly held off Qing soldiers for hours singlehandedly before being overcome and killed. By 31 October, Wang was surrounded. Determined not to be captured alive, he set fire to the tower in which he was trapped. His burned body was identified by his sword and bracelets. In fiction, Wang's life is narrated in Alfred Döblin's 1916 historical novel, The Three Leaps of Wang Lun. References *Ching, Frank. Ancestors: 900 Years in the Life of a Chinese Family.

It was founded in 1990 as a right-wing opposition group during the Wende transition to democracy in East Germany, when it was part of the Alliance for Germany electoral coalition. After 1990, it fell into insignificance, only holding a few seats on the local level. Ideology According to its 2006 basic programme, the DSU refers to itself as a conservative, democratic and social party. Ideologically, the party's goals are to preserve and uphold Western-Christian civilization, and to dismantle the welfare state.. The party can thus be seen as right-wing (anti- socialistic) national-conservative. It strongly differentiates itself from the National Democratic Party (NPD) and German People's Union (DVU), who tend more towards national socialism. Its closest ideological ally among the right-wing parties is The Republicans. Historically, and as its name implies, it is modelled after the CSU in Bavaria, the more rightist of the two Union \\"sister parties\\". However it was not possible for the DSU to join the CSU, as the CDU and CSU do not compete in the same states. History Establishment Hans-Wilhelm Ebeling, first chairman (early 1990) In the chaotic world of 1989–1990 East German politics, several long-suppressed cultural and political movements (re)emerged, and numerous small parties sprang up. The German Social Union was one of these, then several comprising conservative, Christian- democratic and liberal opposition groups. The party was founded in Leipzig on 20 January 1990 by the St. Thomas Church pastor Hans-Wilhelm Ebeling, modeled loosely on the Christian Social Union of Bavaria (Christlich-Soziale Union, CSU). Initially, the Bavarian CSU supported the DSU, wishing to make it its East German branch, and thus revisiting Franz Josef Strauß' mid-1970s plan to make the CSU a nationwide \\"fourth party\\". Reunification period Peter- Michael Diestel, DSU frontrunner in the 1990 East German election On 5 February 1990, DSU joined the Alliance for Germany together with the centre- right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the now-defunct Democratic Awakening (DA) to form the Alliance for Germany, a centre-right coalition which ran in the first (and only) free East German general election of 18 March 1990. The DSU polled 6.3% of the votes cast and 25 seats in the People's Chamber parliament. It achieved its strongest results in the southern districts of Karl-Marx-Stadt, Dresden and Leipzig (that later formed the state of Saxony), where the DSU polled two-digit percentages. Its most prominent politician was the lawyer Peter-Michael Diestel, who joined the last East German cabinet (Council of Ministers) under Lothar de Maizière as minister of the interior and deputy prime minister. The DSU also held the ministry of economic cooperation, led by Hans-Wilhelm Ebeling. However, both Diestel and Ebeling left the party in June and July 1990, respectively, Diestel joined the CDU a month later. Of all parties in the People's Chamber, the DSU was the keenest on a swift reunification of East and West Germany. Its delegates repeatedly proposed a motion for East Germany's \\"immediate accession\\" to the Federal Republic of Germany. Hansjoachim Walther, party chairman 1990–1991 Hansjoachim Walther, a mathematics professor, was elected chairman of the DSU on the first regular party congress in May 1990. Under his leadership, the party took a turn to the right, hosting national-conservative and in some cases even far-right voices. Unlike the other parliamentary parties and a vast majority of the population, numerous DSU members did not accept the Oder–Neisse line as Germany's eastern border (which was finally laid down in the reunification treaty and the Two Plus Four Agreement). After German reunification was accomplished on 3 October 1990, eight DSU People's Chamber deputies entered into the Bundestag (federal parliament), where they joined the CDU/CSU parliamentary group. The Alliance for Germany coalition dissolved after that. In Chancellor Helmut Kohl's third cabinet, the DSU was represented by Hansjoachim Walther as federal minister without portfolio from October 1990 to January 1991. In the October 1990 legislative elections in the new German states, the DSU did not pass the five-percent threshold, winning 3.6% in its former stronghold of Saxony and even less in the other states, and thus failed to enter into any Landtag (state legislature). Ahead of the first post- reunification German federal election on 2 December 1990, the Bavarian CSU aimed for a deal with the CDU to save its East German offshoot from irrelevance: If the CDU had abstained from competing in a few constituencies in Saxony and Thuringia, thus winning the DSU at least three \\"direct mandates\\", the small party could have been spared from the five-percent threshold and might have survived as a regional party. However, the CDU under Helmut Kohl insisted on the unwritten CDU/CSU agreement that the CSU may only run in Bavaria, while all other states are CDU's territory. Many DSU members realised that the party had no future and switched to the CDU. Eventually, DSU achieved 0.2% of nationwide votes, 1.0% in the new states. After this disappointment, the Bavarian CSU reduced its benefits to the DSU, but continued to transfer six-figure sums annually until 1993.  After 1990  The DSU drifted further towards a nationalistic course, aiming for a position inbetween the centre-right CDU and the far-right Republicans. During the early-1990s, the party received support by the (West German) Neue Rechte (\\"New Right\\") movement, in particular by the Criticón magazine of Caspar von Schrenck-Notzing, who also attended DSU meetings. The DSU's image was then characterised by financial misconduct, internal squabbles, resignations, and contacts with far-right groups. The cooperation of DSU and CSU was definitely ended after the Spring 1993 party conference, when Roberto Rink was elected chairman of the DSU. In subsequent elections its share of the vote has remained under 1% of the vote in all Landtag elections held in the new states. Electoral coalitions with right-wing parties like the German Party, the Party for a Rule of Law Offensive or the Statt Party led to no avail. Nevertheless, the DSU has a loyal following of voters on the local level, especially in some districts of Saxony. In the western states, the party is virtually nonexistent. The DSU had one member in the Landtag of Saxony from 2006 to 2009, after the NPD parliamentarian Klaus Baier had defected from his party after a series of disputes and joined the DSU.

History The Drăgaica fair was initially a wool trading fair held in the mountain side of the Buzău River valley, every year, after the sheep shearing. Eventually, the fair moved to Buzău, as shown by a document dated 26 August 1778 issued by Alexandru Ipsilanti by which full jurisdiction on the organization and the tax collection rights for the fair were granted to the Buzău bishopric. Mihai Şuţu reinforced the bishopric's privileges on the collection of taxes from the fair in a 1792 letter: In 1806, Buzău was burnt to the ground by the Ottoman army during the Russo-Turkish War of 1806-1812, and the city's inhabitants took refuge in the villages in the nearby hills. The fair was thus suspended until 1829, when it was resumed in a rebuilt Buzău.Petcu, 2002, pp.34-35 The Drăgaica fair is still being held in Buzău, once a year, for two weeks, in June.

Old Copper Complex or Old Copper Culture were ancient Native North American societies known to have extensively produced and used copper for weaponry and tools.

Western Great Lakes The Old Copper Complex of the Western Great Lakes is the best known, and can be dated as far back as 6,000 years ago. Great Lakes natives of the Archaic tradition located 99% pure copper near Lake Superior, in veins touching the surface and in nuggets from gravel beds. Major quarries were located on Isle Royale, the Keweenaw Peninsula, and the Brule River, and copper was deposited elsewhere by glaciation as well.Gibbon, Guy. \\"Old Copper in Minnesota: A Review.\\" The Plains Anthropologist. Vol. 43, No. 163, p. 28. 1998. Evidence of mining, deep holes chipped into the rock, can be found in Ontario, Manitoba, and around Lake Superior. Eventually these cultures learned to hammer the copper and produce a variety of spearpoints, tools and decorative objects. In addition to their own use, the Copper Complex peoples traded copper goods for other exotic materials. By about 3,000 years ago copper was increasingly restricted to jewelry and other status-related items, rather than tools. This is thought to represent the development of more complex social hierarchies in the area.Thomas C.

Research was conducted in both Russia and western nations into potential applications as a neuroprotective drug to treat Alzheimer's disease and, possibly, as a nootropic, as well. After a major phase III clinical trial for Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment failed to show any benefit, three other AD trials continued.Novel Alzheimer's Drug Flops, MedPage Today, March 03, 2010 Major industry-based development in this indication essentially stopped after another Phase III trial suffered the same fate in 2012.Sweetlove M: Phase III CONCERT Trial of Latrepirdine. Negative results. Pharm Med 2012;26(2):113-115 Latrepirdine failed in the phase III trial for Huntington disease.  Uses  Latrepirdine is an orally active, small molecule compound that has been shown to inhibit brain cell death in animal models of Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease. Research suggests it may also have cognition-enhancing effects in healthy individuals, in the absence of neurodegenerative disease pathology. However, because of negative results in human clinical trials, the drug remains unlicensed for any neurodegenerative condition.  Alzheimer's disease: failed in Phase III clinical trials  Latrepirdine attracted renewed interest in 2009 after being shown in small preclinical trials to have positive effects on persons suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Animal studies showing potential beneficial effects on Alzheimer's disease models were shown in Russian research in 2000. Preliminary results from human trials have also been promising. In an initial six-month phase II trial, results have shown significant improvement over placebo at 12 months. Latrepirdine showed promising results in a phase III-equivalent, double-blind trial in Russia with mild–moderate stage patients. In April 2009, Pfizer and Medivation initiated a phase III trial (CONCERT study) aiming for FDA approval.https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS117499+15-Apr-2009+PRN20090415 \\"Pfizer and Medivation Initiate Phase 3 Trial of Dimebon Added to Donepezil in Patients with Alzheimer's Disease\\" Apr 2009 In March 2010, Pfizer announced that this clinical trial failed to show any benefit for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease patients.

In March 2010, the results of a clinical trial phase III were released; the investigational Alzheimer's disease drug dimebon failed in the pivotal CONNECTION trial of patients with mild-to-moderate disease. With CONCERT, the remaining Pfizer and Medivation Phase III trial for latrepirdine in Alzheimer's disease failed in 2012, effectively ending the development in this indication. A Cochrane meta- analysis of the three pivotal phase III efficacy trials found no significant effect of latrepirdine on cognition and function in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's patients, though there appears to be a modest benefit for overall behavior disturbances.  Huntington's disease  In April 2011, latrepirdine failed in a phase III clinical trial of patients affected with Huntington's disease. The trial was sponsored by Medivation Inc. and Pfizer.  Pharmacology  Latrepirdine appears to operate through multiple mechanisms of action, both blocking the action of neurotoxic beta-amyloid proteins and inhibiting L-type calcium channels, modulating the action of AMPA and NMDA glutamate receptors, and may exert a neuroprotective effect by blocking a novel target that involves mitochondrial pores, which are believed to play a role in the cell death that is associated with neurodegenerative diseases and the aging process. It also blocks a number of other receptors, including α-adrenergic, 5-HT2C, 5-HT5A, and 5-HT6. It is of significance to note latrepirdine lacks any anticholinergic effects.

As the name suggests and as also mentioned by Wendell Levi in his book The Pigeon, this breed was developed in and around the City of Birmingham in England. The Birmingham Roller has a flying type and a show type. Show Rollers are larger than the flying variety, and are bred just for show. A similar breed called a Parlor Roller look much like Birmingham Rollers, but can't fly; rather, they spin backwards, somersaulting on the ground for many yards. Oriental Rollers are another aerial performer and come in many colour varieties. Some fanciers fly their rollers in competition, both locally and nationally. There is even a World Cup competition that includes several other countries. Kits (group of pigeons) are scored for quality and depth, as well as the number of birds that roll at the same time, referred to as a turn or break. The Birmingham Roller is a very popular breed of performing pigeon, with around 10,000 breeders worldwide.  Rolling motion  It is currently not known why the Birmingham Roller and other roller pigeons tumble. While it is true that the birds do perform backward somersaults in flight, the exact neurological causes of the rolling behavior are still unknown. Fanciers who breed rollers have many theories as to why rollers do back-flips, but most of them are not based on scientific evidence. Many agree that they seem to enjoy the motion, frequently arching and \\"wing-clapping\\" just before starting. This bird has a genetic inclination to flip backwards, provided adequate training, diet, and exercise. The spinning can appear to be so fast that the bird looks like a ball of feathers falling toward the ground. They recover from the spin and return to their flock, called a “kit” in competition. The pigeon continues to do the same acrobatics with regular frequency, often in unison with other birds in the kit. The frequency, depth, style, tightness of roll, and angle are all determined by careful and methodical breeding. The flight time, height of flight, and responsiveness to the trainer's commands are all determined by strict training and diet, along with consistent daily routine. A noted pigeon fancier, William Pensom described the motion thus:William Pensom - \\"Acrobats of the Air\\" (1941) There have been more recent, scientific studies of roller pigeons, including the mode of inheritanceEntrikin & Erway., J. Hered., 1972 and a high-speed video analysis of the specific movements involved in rolling and tumbling in pigeons.Entrikin & Bryant, Nature., 1974 In brief, rolling and tumbling in flight or on the ground are genetically the same phenomenon, but differ in duration, and hence, the length of the tumble or roll. The most extreme example of rolling in flight is a \\"roll-down\\", in which case a bird will somersault to the ground from any height and, on the ground, the parlor roller, which cannot fly at all, and somersaults backward (or rolls) every time it tries to fly. The specific cause of the rolling phenomenon has not yet been determined, but the high-speed video analysis of parlor rollers in motion shows that their head goes backwards and their tail upwards when they raise their wings, the exact opposite of what a normal pigeon would do in attempting to fly.Entrikin & Bryant, Nature, 1974  See also  *List of pigeon breeds  References  External links * National Birmingham Roller Club * Rick Mee's Roller Pigeons Category:Pigeon breeds Category:History of Birmingham, West Midlands Category:Pigeon breeds originating in England ","title":"Birmingham Roller"},{"id":"11711377","text":"Zeno Roth (30 June 1956 – 5 February 2018) was a German guitarist and songwriter, playing in a neoclassical/blues style.

As its name suggests, it takes the form of a long ridge which rises in a north-easterly direction from within the town of Longridge to its summit 4.5 miles distant. As the ridge curves towards the east, it comes to a sudden end and drops into the Hodder Valley. The fell is a good example of a cuesta; the ridge has a sharp drop or escarpment on its northern side, and a gentler, more varying slope on its southern side.Freeman et al, p.12 These features make it a popular takeoff for hang-gliders and paragliders on the relatively infrequent occurrences of a northerly wind. From the fell's 1,148-ft (350-m) summit, views are afforded of Preston to the south-west; the Fylde Coast to the west; the outstanding view of the Vale of Chipping and the fells of the Forest of Bowland to the north and west (including Parlick, Fair Snape Fell and Beacon Fell); the Yorkshire Dales to the north-east (including, most notably, Pen-y-ghent); Clitheroe, Pendle Hill and Whalley, to the east and south-east; and Winter Hill and the West Pennine Moors and the huge BAE Systems factory at Samlesbury Aerodrome. On clear days, the Lake District and sometimes the Isle of Man can be seen to the north-west, and the Snowdonia mountain range to the south-west. The River Hodder, and its tributary the River Loud, flow eastward along the north side of the fell, before turning south at the end of the fell to join the River Ribble which runs westward along the south of the fell. Cowley Brook, a tributary of Stydd Brook, begins its course near the fell. The village of Hurst Green and the adjoining Stonyhurst College lie on the south side of the fell. Longridge town lies at the south-west end of the fell. There were once extensive stone quarries at Tootle Heights, now mostly built on apart from a deep rocky water- filled remnant off the Tan Yard bridlepath, and the reservoirs.

Spitfire PR.Mk.XIX displayed at an air show in 2008 with the black and white invasion stripes. Invasion stripes were alternating black and white bands painted on the fuselages and wings of Allied aircraft during World War II to reduce the chance that they would be attacked by friendly forces during and after the Normandy Landings. Three white and two black bands were wrapped around the rear of a fuselage just in front of the empennage (tail) and from front to back around the upper and lower wing surfaces. After a study concluded that the thousands of aircraft involved in the invasion would saturate and break down the IFF system, the marking scheme was approved on May 17, 1944, by Air Chief Marshal Sir Trafford Leigh-Mallory, commanding the Allied Expeditionary Air Force. A small-scale test exercise was flown over the OVERLORD invasion fleet on June 1, to familiarise the ships' crews with the markings, but for security reasons, orders to paint the stripes were not issued to the troop carrier units until June 3 and to the fighter and bomber units until June 4. Stripes were applied to fighters, photo- reconnaissance aircraft, troop carriers, twin-engined medium and light bombers, and some special duty aircraft. They were not painted on four-engined heavy bombers of the U.S. Eighth Air Force or RAF Bomber Command, as there was little chance of mistaken identity, the Luftwaffe having few such bombers (the Heinkel He 177 and Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor being the exceptions). The order affected all aircraft of the Allied Expeditionary Air Force, the Air Defence of Great Britain, gliders, and support aircraft such as Coastal Command air- sea rescue aircraft whose duties might entail their overflying Allied anti- aircraft defenses. One month after D-Day, the stripes were ordered removed from planes' upper surfaces to make them more difficult to spot on the ground at forward bases in France. They were completely removed by the end of 1944 after the Allies achieved total air supremacy over France. Marking description A British-captured He 177 German heavy bomber bearing Allied invasion stripes in 1945 Geoffrey Page, commander of 125 Wing, about to take off on a ground-attack sortie in his Supermarine Spitfire (1944). The roughly- applied nature of the invasion stripes painted on his aircraft can be seen An early P-47D \\"razorback\\" Thunderbolt shows the \\"overlapping roundel\\" characteristic of their use on American aircraft's wings. The stripes were five alternating black and white stripes. On single-engine aircraft each stripe was to be wide, placed inboard of the roundels on the wings and forward of the leading edge of the tailplane on the fuselage. National markings and serial number were not to be obliterated. On twin-engine aircraft the stripes were wide, placed outboard of the engine nacelles on the wings, and forward of the leading edge of the tailplane around the fuselage. However, American aircraft using the invasion stripes very commonly had some part of the added \\"bar\\" section of their post-1942 roundels overlapping the invasion strips on the wings. In most cases the stripes were painted on by the ground crews; with only a few hours' notice, few of the stripes were \\"masked\\".D-Day was originally scheduled for June 5. As a result, depending on the abilities of the \\"erks\\" (RAF nickname for ground crew), the stripes were often far from neat and tidy. Operation Starkey The stripes for this two-day deception operation in 1943 were black from the wing tip to a position on the wing where the chord is 5 feet, then four bands of alternating white and black. This was the same for the upper and lower surfaces. These were applied to all aircraft operating at low level. For single engine aircraft the stripes were 18 inches in width. For twin engine aircraft, including the Westland Whirlwind, the stripes were 24 inches in width. Hawker Typhoon A Hawker Typhoon of No. 56 Squadron RAF, painted with recognition stripes under the wings (April 1943) An earlier use of black and white bands was on the Hawker Typhoon and early production Hawker Tempest Mark Vs. The aircraft had a similar outline when seen from above and below to the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 and the bands were added to aid identification in combat. The order was promulgated on 5 December 1942. At first they were applied by unit ground crews, but they were soon being painted on at the factory. Four black stripes separated by three white, underwing from the wingroots. From early 1943 the Typhoons also had a yellow, stripe on each of the upper wings, centred on the inner cannon. All of these markings were officially abandoned 7 February 1944.  Luftwaffe's Jagdverband 44 The late-war specialized all-jet Luftwaffe fighter squadron, Jagdverband 44, possessed a number of Fw 190 D piston-engined fighters to protect their units' Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighters during the jets' takeoff and landing operations, as the jets were most vulnerable to Allied piston-engined fighter attack at those times. The Fw 190D aircraft of this so-called Platzschutzstaffel (airfield protection squadron) used a color scheme featuring solid red-painted areas under the wings and around the rear fuselage areas, within which narrow white stripes running fore-to-aft inder the wings and \\"vertically\\" around the fuselage areas were painted, to identify them as \\"friendly\\" Luftwaffe fighters. This was done for similar reasons as the \\"invasion stripes\\" had been used in Operation Overlord ten months earlier over Normandy. The Staffel was nicknamed Die Papagei-Staffel (\\"The Parrot squad\\") - it is not known, however, if the earlier use of Würger (which translates as \\"shrike\\" in English) by the Focke-Wulf aircraft firm itself for its original Fw 190A radial-engined initial subtype had any bearing on the JV 44 unit's Platzschutzstaffel nickname. Korea A Hawker Sea Fury launches from in 1951 Invasion stripes were re-introduced on British and Australian Fleet Air Arm aircraft operating during the Korean War in 1950. Similar stripes were also used early in the war on F-86 Sabres of the 4th Fighter Interceptor Wing as a deviation from the standard yellow stripes. Suez The stripes were used again by the Royal Air Force, the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm, the French Naval Aviation and the French Air Force during the Suez operation of 1956, mostly to distinguish UK and French aircraft from Egypt's British-made planes. Single- engined aircraft had yellow/black/yellow/black/yellow stripes one foot wide; multi-engined aircraft had the same pattern with stripes. Israel, who was a co-belligerent with Britain and France, did not paint Suez Stripes on their aircraft. Czechoslovakia Warsaw Pact invasion of the country in 1968. During the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, the Soviet Union used a series of white stripes on the armoured vehicles of its invasion forces because they used predominantly the same types of combat vehicles as the armed forces of Czechoslovakia (both were Warsaw Pact allies). The markings consisted of one long white strip in the middle of the vehicle from the front and across the roof all the way to the back with two additional strips in the middle of both sides. This is similar to the markings applied on most Soviet tanks and armoured fighting vehicles fighting in Berlin in 1945 during the Second World War to prevent friendly fire from Western Allied (British or American) aircraft that flew over the city to conduct bombing raids until its fall. In addition to that, certain Soviet Air Force's aircraft, such as the MiG-21 fighters, were given two red stripes on their fuselages and vertical stabilisers, also because these types of aircraft were used by the Czechoslovak Air Force.

Thuburbo Minus  Historically Thuburbo Minus was a settlement in Africa Proconsularis, located at present-day Tebourba. Thuburbo Minus is mentioned in the Antonine Itinerary, 44, and the Tabula Peutingeriana. Situated on a hill, the city occupied only a part of the ancient site, when it was rebuilt in the 15th century by the Andalusian Moors. The Roman amphitheatre was still standing at the end of the 17th century, when it was destroyed to build a bridge. The nearby Thuburbo Maius is in ruins. The diocese of Thuburbo Minus was a suffragan of Carthage. It was at Thuburbo Minus that the Christian martyrs Perpetua and Felicity with their companions were arrested. The two known bishops of this city are: Victor, present at the Conference of Carthage (411), where he had as his competitor the Donatist Maximinus; and Germanus, who signed (646) the letter of the bishops of the proconsulate to the Patriarch Paul II of Constantinople against the Monothelites.

The mountain stands on the border of the Perth and Kinross and Argyll and Bute council areas. Overview Beinn Achaladair is a distinct landmark for both road and rail travellers with both the A82 road and the West Highland Line passing close to the foot of the mountain with the railway actually traversing the lower northern slopes before crossing Rannoch Moor on its way to Fort William. The mountain looks impressive from the north west throwing down steep wall like slopes and along with the three adjoining Munros of Beinn Dorain, Beinn an Dothaidh, and Beinn a' Chreachain it forms the historical Great Wall of Rannoch, which was the boundary between the old Pictish Kingdom to the east and the Dál Riata kingdom of the Scots in the west.Sunday Herald article. Gives details of Wall of Rannoch. Beinn Achaladair reaches a height of and is classed as a Munro and a Marilyn, geographically it is part of the southern highlands but it stands at their northern extremity and displays many of the characteristics of the rockier peaks to the north. It is believed that the mountain takes its name from the settlement of Achallader at the foot of the northern slopes and translates from the Gaelic as “Field of hard water” which referred to the area around Loch Tulla which often flooded and froze in the past.\\"The Munros\\" Page 40 (Gives translation as “Field of Hard Water“). Achallader is a farm today but it was formally the site of Achallader Castle one of Campbell of Glenorchy’s seven strongholds, the remains of which can still be seen next to the farmhouse.\\"The Munros - Scotland's Highest Mountains\\" Page 47 (Gives details of Achallader Castle). However, Hamish Brown and others give the hill's translated name as “Hill of the Mower”.\\"Hamish‘s Mountain Walk\\" Page 66 (Gives translation as “Hill of the Mower“). Geography Beinn Achaladair has a curved summit ridge almost two kilometres in length which runs north to south, the highest point stands at its northern end and overlooks Rannoch Moor, there are two cairns close together at the summit with the more northerly one being the highest point by a couple of feet. Just over a kilometre south of the highest point stands the South Top, with a height of 1002 metres it listed as a “Top” in the Munro’s Tables. Beinn Achaladair has two corries on its slopes, to the east of the summit ridge is Coire nan Clach which contains eight very small lochans in its upper recesses. This corrie drains down Gleann Cailliche (Glen of the Old Woman) into Loch Lyon, this now deserted glen was previously well populated before the Highland Clearances. The remains of the settlement of Tigh na Cailleach and the surrounding shielings can still be identified\\"Highland Perthshire\\" (Gives info on Gleann Cailliche). . All drainage from this side of the mountain finds it way to the Firth of Tay on the east coast via Loch Lyon, Loch Tay and the River Tay Beinn Achaladair’s other significant corrie is Corrie Achaladair which stands to the south of the mountain and forms a col with the adjoining Munro of Beinn an Dotaidh. The mountain's steep northern and western slopes are rocky higher up before becoming grassy as they fall to the valley. These grassy slopes are riven with many small streams which drain to the Water of Tulla which drains into Loch Tulla. Ascents The most common ascent of Beinn Achaladair starts from Achallader farm at grid reference from where it is usually climbed with the adjacent Munro of Beinn a' Chreachain which stands three kilometres to the north east.\\"The Munros\\" Page 40 (Gives details of walk with Beinn a' Chreachain from Achallader). The farmer at Achallader kindly allows walkers to park in a field next to farm and they can show their appreciation by leaving money in an honesty box. From the farm Coire Achaladair is ascended to the col with Beinn an Dotaidh passing several impressive waterfalls on the way. From the col it is a three kilometre walk north to the summit with a vertical ascent of over 300 metres passing over the South Top on the way. The view from the summit gives fine views of Rannoch Moor, with the near at hand flatness of the moor emphasising the feeling of height.

Fulton should not be confused with , a patrol vessel that operated from 1917 to 1919 while Fulton (AS-1) was in commission.  Construction and commissioning  Fulton was originally planned to be named Niagara, 30 April 1912 and was renamed Fulton, 10 February 1913. Fulton was launched on 6 June 1914 by New London Ship and Engine Company, Groton, Connecticut. The ship was sponsored by Mrs. A. T. Sutcliffe, great granddaughter of Robert Fulton, for whom the ship is named. Fulton was commissioned on 7 December 1914, Lieutenant J. D. Wilson in command.  Submarine tender  During her first six months of service, Fulton tended submarines at Norfolk, Charleston, New York, and Newport, then after overhaul, arrived at New London on 2 November 1915, where in 1918 she was the base ship for the newly formed Submarine School. Through 1922, this was to be her principal base for operations with submarines along the east coast and in the Caribbean from Cape Cod to Cuba. She took part in maneuvers and war games, served as station ship at New London, and in the summer of 1922 was flagship of Commander, Atlantic Submarine Flotillas. Reassigned as tender for the Submarine Base at Coco Solo, Canal Zone, Fulton arrived there on 4 April 1923, and during the following year joined in exercises on both sides of the Panama Canal Zone as well as making a survey of Almirante Bay, Panama. She returned to Philadelphia on 14 July 1925, and there was decommissioned and placed in reserve on 5 October.  Gunboat  USS Fulton (PG-49) in March 1934 after her fire at sea.Fulton was recommissioned on 2 September 1930 for duty as a survey ship in the Panama Canal Zone, reclassified as a gunboat, PG-49, on 29 September. On 3 March 1931, she returned to Balboa. Aside from a voyage north for overhaul in the winter of 1931–32, she conducted surveys in the Canal Zone area until arriving at San Diego on 13 August 1932 to prepare for duty in the Asiatic Fleet. Her assigned station was Hong Kong, where she arrived on 3 November. With infrequent voyages to Cavite Navy Yard in the Philippines, Fulton patrolled the south China coast from Hong Kong to Canton until 14 March 1934. On that day, a fire broke out amidships when exhaust lines from two cylinders of a diesel engine carried away and ignited oil on the engine. The crew assembled on the bow and stern, and were taken off by the British destroyer and the merchant ship SS Tsinan, three of the men having minor injuries, and brought to the Royal Navy Dockyard at Hong Kong. The British destroyer stood by the burning ship until a salvage party got the fire under sufficient control to allow her to be taken in tow for Junk Bay in Hong Kong. On 24 March, an American tug came to tow Fulton into Hong Kong, where she received emergency repairs to allow her to be towed to Cavite. The United States Department of the Navy later passed thanks to British naval authorities for the assistance Wishart and Whitshed provided to Fulton and her crew.  Decommissioning and disposal  Fulton was decommissioned at Cavite on 12 May 1934. She was scrapped later that year.

It is believed to be extirpated from South Korea. An isolated population exists on Hokkaidō, Japan, in the Kushiro Shitsugen National Park. A breeding ground of Siberian salamanders in Paegam, South Hamgyong, is designated North Korean natural monument #360. Description Adults are from 9.0 to 12.5 cm in length. Their bodies are bluish-brown in color, with a purple stripe along the back. Thin, dark brown stripes occur between and around the eyes, and also sometimes on the tail. Four clawless toes are on each foot. The tail is longer than the body. A single egg sac contains 50-80 eggs on average, with a female typically laying up to 240 eggs in a season. The light-brown eggs hatch three to four weeks after being laid, releasing larval salamanders of 11–12 mm in length. The species is known for surviving deep freezes (as low as −45 °C). In some cases, they have been known to remain frozen in permafrost for years, and upon thawing, walking off.

Additionally Mauritania is important for numerous birds which migrate from the Palearctic to winter there. Faunal Regions and Habitats Most of the north to about 19° North is regarded as being in the Palearctic, and is largely made up of the Sahara desert and adjacent littoral habitats. South of this is regarded as being in the afrotropical biogeographic realm, which means that species of a predominantly Afotropical distribution dominate the fauna. South of the Sahara is the South Saharan Steppe and Woodlands ecoregion which integrates into the Sahelian Acacia Savanna ecoregion. The southernmost part of the country lies in the West Sudanian Savanna ecoregion. Wetlands are important and the two main protected areas are the Banc d'Arguin National Park which protects rich, shallow coastal and marine ecosystems which integrates with the arid Sahara desert and the Diawling National Park which forms the northern part of the delta of the Senegal River. Elsewhere in Mauritania wetlands are normally ephemeral and rely on the seasonal rainfall and may be very important for migratory birds. Mammals Most of the larger mammal species have been extirpated from Mauritania. Among the antelopes the Scimitar-horned oryx, addax, korrigum and dama gazelle are extinct, the bohor reedbuck, Buffon's kob, Dorcas gazelle and red-fronted gazelle are extinct and the bushbuck and slender-horned gazelle are of indeterminate status. In the area of Diawling National Park, the last lion was shot in 1970 and there have been no sightings of manatees or hippopotamus in recent years. The Mediterranean monk seal has one of its last strongholds in the world in the coves along the Cap Blanc Peninsula near Nouadhibou. Common extant mammals include fennec fox, golden jackals, warthogs, African wildcats, Cape hares and patas monkeys. Golden Jackal The rich offshore waters of Mauritania are home to a diverse fauna of cetaceans. Upwellings off the coats create rich feeding grounds for baleen whales and these include blue whale, sei whale and Bryde's whale, although the North Atlantic right whale is now extinct in the eastern Atlantic and it was recorded off Mauritania. Other cetaceans found off Mauritania's coast include harbour porpoise, Atlantic spotted dolphin, bottlenose dolphin, sperm whale, short-finned pilot whale and orca. Birds Over 500 species of bird have been recorded in Mauritania. Specialities and spectacular species include scissor-tailed kite, Nubian bustard, Arabian bustard, houbara bustard Egyptian plover, golden nightjar, chestnut-bellied starling, Kordofan lark and Sudan golden sparrow. The coastal wetlands are of immense importance for over two million wintering Western Palearctic waders, from fifteen different species including dunlin, bar-tailed godwit, curlew sandpiper and common redshank each numbering over 100,000 birds. Other wintering species include more than 30,000 greater flamingos Breeding birds include great white pelican, reed cormorant, gull-billed tern, Caspian tern, royal tern and common tern, together with two unique subspecies of grey heron Ardea cinerea monicae and Eurasian spoonbill Platalea leucorodia balsaci and an outpost of the western reef heron. Arabian Bustard Herpetofauna The West African crocodile still exists in small numbers in Mauritania. Other reptiles found include the African chameleon, Senegal chameleon, Nile monitor, various geckos and other lizards, the Mali cobra and Black-necked spitting cobra, African rock python, the desert horned viper and the Saharan sand viper, puff adders are among the snakes, as well as terrestrial, freshwater and marine turtles. In all 86 species of reptile in 21 families have been recorded in Mauritania Eleven species of amphibian have been confirmed as occurring in Mauritania but another 19 are expected to be recorded, mainly in the south of the country. West African crocodile Fish The marine fish found off Mauritania's coast are an important resource for commercial, subsistence and sport fishing, estimates put the potential catch at between 400,000 and 700,000 tons. The rich waters off the Mauritanian coast are host to a variety of species more familiar in more northerly temperate waters such as European seabass, European hake, Norwegian skate and Gilt-head bream, as well as species more typical of warmer waters including whale shark, Atlantic bluefin tuna, Atlantic sailfish, tarpon and Atlantic blue marlin 56 species of freshwater fish have been reported from Mauritania of which 50 have been confirmed as occurring.

History The Worcester and Birmingham Canal was authorised by an Act of Parliament in 1791, after overcoming opposition by the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal and the Birmingham Canal Company. The first saw the new route as direct competition, while the second would not allow a junction between the two canals. The canal was built southwards from Birmingham, where there was a gap between the canal and the Birmingham system. Shortly after passing through King's Norton, a ridge of hills was pierced by the Wast Hill Tunnel. Construction of it began in 1794, and by 1807, boats could reach Tardebigge. There was then a period of no activity, but the canal was finally completed to Diglis Basin and the River Severn in 1815. An agreement enabled a stop lock to be built to connect the canal to the Birmingham Canals in the same year. The Stratford-upon-Avon Canal was authorised in 1793, to ensure that the prosperity being generated by new canal routes would not bypass Stratford. Construction began at Kings Norton Junction, less than from Selly Oak Junction, where the Worcester and Birmingham met with the Dudley Canal No. 2 line which passed through the Lapal Tunnel. This route would give easy access to the Dudley coalfields. After the first three years, progress was slow due to a lack of capital, and it was not until the canal reached Kingswood Junction at Lapworth in 1803, where there was a link to the Warwick and Birmingham Canal (later part of the Grand Union Canal), that large volumes of traffic used the canal and Kings Norton Junction. The final section from Lapworth to Stratford was built between 1812 and 1815. Although the southern section of the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal was closed, the northern section did not officially do so, although there was little traffic after 1939, and Lifford Bridge, shortly after the stop lock, could no longer be swung after 1942, when the Great Western Railway repaired it in a way which prevented its movement. It was the scene of one of the first campaigns by the fledgling Inland Waterways Association, when Tom Rolt announced in 1947 that he intended to navigate through the junction and along the canal. The Railway company had to jack the bridge up, to allow his boat to pass, and the event was widely reported in newspapers, gaining useful publicity. Location High on the wall of the Worcester and Birmingham toll house is a 1993 reproduction of the scale of toll fees in 1793. Fees varied from ½d per ton per mile for lime, to 1 3/4d for food or finished products. The water of the two canal companies was kept apart by the nearby Lifford Lane guillotine stop lock, consisting of two wooden gates which moved vertically in iron frames. Now that both canals are managed by British Waterways, both gates are kept open, and have been since nationalisation of the canals in 1948. The structure is grade II* listed, as the raked cast iron frames, columns and counterweights are original. At the junction is a grade II listed house, built in 1802 of red brick, with doric column decoration around the central doorway. It is somewhat larger than most lock-keepers cottages. The junction bridge, which has a broad elliptical arch and carries the towpath over the Worcester and Birmingham Canal to reach the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal, is located just to the north of the junction, and is also listed. From the junction, the Worcester and Birmingham Canal to the north is level to the junction with the Birmingham Canal Navigations at Worcester Bar Junction, away. To the south, it remains level for as it passes through Wast Hill, Shortwood and Tardebigge tunnels, until it arrives at the top lock of the thirty that form the Tardebigge flight. The Stratford-upon-Avon Canal initially heads towards the east, before turning to the south-east, and is level for , after which 19 locks drop the canal down to Kingswood Junction and the Grand Union Canal.

A member of the June 1918 class of the United States Military Academy at West Point that graduated early due to World War I, Marshall saw service on the Mexican border. Between the wars he worked on engineering projects in the United States and the Panama Canal Zone. In January 1942, shortly after the United States entered World War II, he became District Engineer of the Syracuse District, and oversaw the construction of the Rome Air Depot. In June 1942, Marshall was placed in charge of the Manhattan Project, then known as the Laboratory Development of Substitute Materials. Although superseded as head of the project by Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves Jr., in September, he was Manhattan District engineer from 13 August 1942 to 13 August 1943. In November 1943 he became Assistant Chief of Staff (G-4) of the United States Army Services of Supply (USASOS) in the Southwest Pacific Area, serving in Australia, New Guinea and the Philippines. Marshall left the Army in 1947, and moved to Riverside, Connecticut, where he worked for M. W. Kellogg. He later joined Koppers, building a coal loading facility in Turkey, and worked on mining projects in Africa. He was Commissioner of Highways in Minnesota from 1961 to 1965. Early life and career James Creel Marshall was born in Plattsburg, Missouri, on 14 October 1897, the son of Walter Scott Marshall and his wife Cora Sutphen née Creel. He was appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1915. His classmates included Hugh John Casey and Lucius D. Clay. The entire class graduated early on 12 June 1918 due to World War I, and Marshall, who was ranked 24th in the class, was commissioned as a substantive first lieutenant and temporary captain in the United States Army Corps of Engineers. He was posted to Camp A. A. Humphreys from 8 to 15 July 1918, and then was sent to the Engineer Officers' Training School at Camp Lee, Virginia, for additional training. While there, he married Mabel Estelle Wolff from Brooklyn. They had two children, Beryl, born in 1919, and Robert Creel, born in 1921. On 24 August 1918, Marshall joined the 8th Engineers at Fort Bliss, Texas. He returned to Camp A. A. Humphreys as a student officer from 10 February 1919 to 12 June 1919. Young officers like Marshall who had not served overseas during the war were sent on battlefield tours. From 20 June to 30 August 1919, he toured the battlefields of World War I, visiting Britain, France, Belgium and Germany, before returning to Camp A. A. Humphreys on 10 September 1919. After service at Camp A. A. Humphreys with the Reserve Officers' Training Corps, Marshall was posted to the 13th Engineers as its adjutant on 10 February 1921, but attended the Engineer School Basic Course from 6 June 1921, graduating on 15 August 1921, after which he became an instructor there. On 25 June 1922 he became Assistant District Engineer of the 2nd District, based in New York City. Like many of his fellow officers, Marshall was reduced to his substantive rank of first lieutenant on 18 November 1922. On 4 August 1923 he took charge of the Engineer Office of the 3rd New York District, located in Fort Hancock, New Jersey. He then served in the Panama Canal Zone as a company commander in the 11th Engineers from 9 April 1926 to 14 June 1928. He became an instructor in the Department of Engineering at West Point on 24 August 1928. He was posted to Fort Belvoir, Virginia, on 10 August 1932, where he was promoted to captain again on 1 June 1933. There followed duty in the Office of the Chief Of Engineers in Washington, DC, as Assistant Chief of the River and Harbor Section from 21 January 1937 to 3 September 1939. World War II Marshall attended the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, from 11 September 1939 to 3 February 1940. He then became executive officer of the 1st Engineers. With the outbreak of World War II in Europe, promotion accelerated, and he was promoted to major on 1 March 1940. He became District Engineer of the Binghamton District on 25 May 1940, with the rank of lieutenant colonel in the Army of the United States from 12 June 1941. On 31 January 1942, he became District Engineer of the Syracuse District, which covered New York and part of Pennsylvania, with the rank of colonel from 1 February 1942. At Binghamton and Syracuse was responsible for a number of major projects, including ammunition and explosive plants, and the construction of the Rome Air Depot. He also had to attend to flood control measures on the upper Delaware River. On 18 June 1942 Marshall was called to Washington to take over the reorganised atomic bomb project, then known as the DSM (Laboratory Development of Substitute Materials). Marshall read the 13 June 1942 report from Vannevar Bush and James Conant and recalled that: In a report to Colonel Leslie R. Groves Jr., the head of the Construction Branch in the Office of the Chief of Engineers, on 11 August 1942, Marshall called for the creation a new district without territorial limits to administer the DSM project. His proposal was approved on 13 August. As district engineer of the new district, Marshall reported directly to Groves, and not the Chief of Engineers. He established the district headquarters on the 18th floor of 270 Broadway in New York City, with the innocuous name of the Manhattan Engineer District, following the usual practice of naming engineer districts after the city in which their headquarters area were located. He selected the Boston firm of Stone & Webster as the project's principal contractor. Marshall and his deputy district engineer, Kenneth Nichols, visited Tennessee on 30 June 1942 to examine the proposed location for the production plants in the Clinch River area, but Marshall chose to delay the actual purchase of the land until it was needed. Nichols felt that Marshall's desire for orderly procedures ultimately told against him. By September, Bush was expressing dissatisfaction with slow progress and the lack of the highest priority for the project, going to the United States Secretary of War, Henry L. Stimson, and then directly to the President, Franklin D. Roosevelt. Groves was appointed to head the project on 17 September 1942. Groves was also a colonel, and ranked below Marshall on the permanent list, although Groves was promoted to brigadier general before assuming command on 23 September. According to Nichols, Groves and Marshall \\"disagreed in a major way on how to handle personnel\\", and Nichols \\"did witness several confrontations\\". Major General Wilhelm D. Styer, the Chief of Staff of the Army Service Forces, decided that Marshall would be replaced by Nichols. Marshall would be replaced given an overseas posting. He was informed by Nichols on June; to him it seemed he was \\"getting fired\\", although he had previously expressed a desire to Groves for just such an overseas assignment. Indeed, when first assigned to the project, both Nichols and Groves had also have expressed a preference for an overseas combat assignment. Nichols had \\"liked working for him and was happy to have him as a buffer between Groves and myself\\", because Groves was \\"abrasive and often very critical\\". Marshall asked Nichols to transfer his secretary, Virginia Olsson, to Oak Ridge when the Manhattan District headquarters moved there, leaving Nichols's own secretary, Anne Phillips, in the New York office. \\"This concern for personnel\\", Nichols noted, \\"was typical of Marshall\\". Since the Manhattan District had been officially created on 13 August 1942, Marshall chose to formally leave on 13 August 1943, so that he had held the job for exactly one year. Groves's account says that: Marshall was awarded the Legion of Merit for his service with the Manhattan District. He was posted to Camp Sutton, North Carolina, as commander of the Engineer Replacement Training Center there until 26 November 1943. He then had his sought-after overseas service, in the Southwest Pacific Area, where he became Assistant Chief of Staff (G-4) of the United States Army Services of Supply (USASOS). He saw service in Australia, New Guinea and the Philippines. He was promoted to brigadier general on 10 November 1944, and awarded the Bronze Star Medal. He returned to the United States for medical reasons on 12 February 1945. His final command was of the Boston Port of Embarkation, for which he received the Army Commendation Medal. On 29 January 1946 he became head of the Engineer Research and Development Laboratory at Fort Belvoir. He reverted to his permanent rank of colonel on 5 March 1946, and retired from the Army on a disability on 31 March 1947. On 29 June 1948, he was promoted to brigadier general on the retired list.  Later life  After leaving the Army, he moved to Riverside, Connecticut, where he worked for M. W. Kellogg. He eventually tired of commuting to New York City, and took a job with Koppers, building a coal loading facility in Turkey. He then worked for the United Nations Korean Relief at the headquarters of the United Nations in New York. He was also involved in mining projects in Africa. He made his home in Skaneateles, New York, while working on various projects around the world. In January 1961 he accepted an offer from the Governor of Minnesota, Elmer L. Andersen, to become that state's Commissioner of Highways. His four-year term was marred by a change of government in the state in 1963, and his final years saw a series of clashes with the new governor, Karl F. Rolvaag, and his attorney-general Walter Mondale. When his term as Commissioner of Highways ended in 1965, Marshall returned to Skaneateles, where he became an engineering consultant and a professional engineering arbitrator. He served as mayor of Skaneateles for six years. His contributions included the addition of an ambulance squad to the fire department and the construction of an indoor ice skating rink. His wife Mabel died of cancer in 1976. On 18 July 1977, Marshall also died from cancer. The two are buried together in the West Point Cemetery. Marshall's son Robert Creel Marshall graduated from West Point with the class of 1943, and served in Europe during World War II. He later served in Vietnam, and became Deputy Chief of Engineers in 1976, with the rank of major general.

A common practice is to purchase advertisements in magazines and newspapers where editors and reporters write about the products or company. The goal is to reinforce the marketing message and earn even greater levels of awareness and recall of the brand. Generally, getting the advertisement as close to the editorial content is considered important to maximize the awareness effects. Conquesting injects a competitive advertisement at the moment of editorial presentation and seeks to usurp or disrupt the reinforcement process. Some publishers reject the notion and allow the editorialized advertiser to match the fee and retain advertisement-editorial integrity.  Paid search conquesting  Paid search conquesting is a strategy whereby a brand or company intentionally bids on search terms or keywords directly related to a competitor. It is typically used to gain brand exposure or to gain consumers interest over a competitor. However, it is important to note that using trademarks that are not one's own is forbidden by Google, and pushing paid search conquesting to that extreme can negatively impact the CTR and quality score. Paid search conquesting is a controversial tactic in the pay-per-click world because it has been notoriously used as a way to start bidding wars. The most negative outcomes of paid search conquesting during a bidding war can result in threats to brand visibility and increase in CPC costs. The positive aspects of paid search conquesting in the form of competitor keyword bidding as a strategy include an increase in brand visibility, engagement of \\"at-risk\\" searches, and provision of better results for remarketing lists.  Examples of conquesting  In 1997, Northern Telecom announced Nortel Power Networks, a marketing initiative focused on reinforcing the unifying attributes of the portfolio of enterprise products the company offered at the time. Not more than a month later, Cisco introduced the Cisco-Powered Network,Cisco-Powered Network a partner co- branding, where if a service provider purchases some minimum quantity of Cisco product they would be eligible for co-marketing funds. In this way, Cisco marketers used conquesting to neutralize the brand effect of the Northern Telecom marketing initiative.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, the only one in the Borough of Fylde. History The manor of Lytham was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Lidun. In the 12th century it was given to the Benedictine monks of Durham Priory for the foundation of a monastic cell—Lytham Priory. Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 1530s, Lytham Priory came into the possession of Sir Richard Molyneux. In 1606 the land was acquired by local landowner Cuthbert Clifton, who built a house there. Cuthbert's descendant, Thomas Clifton, replaced that house with the current hall, which was built 1757–1764 to the design of John Carr of York. For the next two centuries the Clifton estate, at its largest, comprised . Jupiter hurling thunderbolts Ownership of the property descended to John Clifton (1764–1832) and thence to his son Thomas Joseph Clifton (1788–1851), who extensively remodelled the estate by extending the surrounding parkland. It passed via Colonel John Talbot Clifton (1819–1882), MP for North Lancashire, to his 14-year-old grandson, the colourful John Talbot Clifton (1868–1928), during whose stewardship the railway was built along the estate's southern boundary and part of the land sold for housing. During the First World War the house was used as a military hospital and after the Cliftons had moved to live in Ireland in 1919 and then Scotland in 1922 the house was somewhat neglected. Clifton was a passionate traveller and died in 1928 on an expedition to Timbuktu with his wife, Violet Beauclerk. She later wrote a biography of her husband, published under the title The Book of Talbot, which won the 1933 James Tait Black Prize,Violet Clifton in Google Books and was the last person to live in the house. Their dilettante film producer son, Henry de Vere Clifton, had squandered much of the family's wealth and the house had to be sold to Guardian Royal Exchange Assurance in 1963 for office accommodation. On 1 December 1965, Lytham Hall was designated as a Grade I listed building. The Grade I designation is the highest of the three grades. The hall is on the Heritage at Risk Register because its condition is considered to be only \\"fair\\". In 1997 Lytham Town Trust bought the building, with help from a donation from BAE Systems, and subsequently leased it to Heritage Trust for the North West for 99 years.http://www.lythamtowntrust.org/ltt_info.htm Architecture Dovecote in trees at rear Lytham Hall is constructed in the Palladian style of red brick in Flemish bond with stone dressings and stuccoed features. It has three storeys on a rectangular, symmetrical plan and sits on a stone plinth. The front façade lies to the east; it has a central bay that extends slightly forward and has an Ionic pediment. The main entrance is also pedimented and is flanked by Doric columns. There are four pilasters between the first floor and roof cornice. The ground floor windows have Gibbs surrounds. In contrast to traditional Palladian-style houses in which the servants' and utility rooms were on the ground floor (piano rustico) and the important family rooms were on the first floor (piano nobile), Lytham Hall's main rooms are on the ground floor. In the grounds are several Grade II listed structures, including the Gatehouse, a large stable block, a large dovecote, the inner gates, a statue of Diana in what used to be a formal garden, and a screen wall running south from the west wing.

A sensor node, also known as a mote (chiefly in North America), is a node in a sensor network that is capable of performing some processing, gathering sensory information and communicating with other connected nodes in the network. A mote is a node but a node is not always a mote. History Although wireless sensor nodes have existed for decades and used for applications as diverse as earthquake measurements to warfare, the modern development of small sensor nodes dates back to the 1998 Smartdust projectSmart Dust and the NASA Sensor Webs ProjectNASA Tech Brief One of the objectives of the Smartdust project was to create autonomous sensing and communication within a cubic millimeter of space. Though this project ended early on, it led to many more research projects. They include major research centres in Berkeley NESTHome and CENS.CENS: Center for Embedded Networked Sensing The researchers involved in these projects coined the term mote to refer to a sensor node. The equivalent term in the NASA Sensor Webs Project for a physical sensor node is pod, although the sensor node in a Sensor Web can be another Sensor Web itself. Physical sensor nodes have been able to increase their capability in conjunction with Moore's Law. The chip footprint contains more complex and lower powered microcontrollers. Thus, for the same node footprint, more silicon capability can be packed into it. Nowadays, motes focus on providing the longest wireless range (dozens of km), the lowest energy consumption (a few uA) and the easiest development process for the user.\\"Waspmote: a modern mote\\" Components The main components of a sensor node are a microcontroller, transceiver, external memory, power source and one or more sensors. Controller The controller performs tasks, processes data and controls the functionality of other components in the sensor node. While the most common controller is a microcontroller, other alternatives that can be used as a controller are: a general purpose desktop microprocessor, digital signal processors, FPGAs and ASICs. A microcontroller is often used in many embedded systems such as sensor nodes because of its low cost, flexibility to connect to other devices, ease of programming, and low power consumption. A general purpose microprocessor generally has a higher power consumption than a microcontroller, therefore it is often not considered a suitable choice for a sensor node. Digital Signal Processors may be chosen for broadband wireless communication applications, but in Wireless Sensor Networks the wireless communication is often modest: i.e., simpler, easier to process modulation and the signal processing tasks of actual sensing of data is less complicated. Therefore, the advantages of DSPs are not usually of much importance to wireless sensor nodes. FPGAs can be reprogrammed and reconfigured according to requirements, but this takes more time and energy than desired. Transceiver Sensor nodes often make use of ISM band, which gives free radio, spectrum allocation and global availability. The possible choices of wireless transmission media are radio frequency (RF), optical communication (laser) and infrared. Lasers require less energy , but need line-of-sight for communication and are sensitive to atmospheric conditions. Infrared, like lasers, needs no antenna but it is limited in its broadcasting capacity. Radio frequency-based communication is the most relevant that fits most of the WSN applications. WSNs tend to use license-free communication frequencies: 173, 433, 868, and 915 MHz; and 2.4 GHz. The functionality of both transmitter and receiver are combined into a single device known as a transceiver. Transceivers often lack unique identifiers. The operational states are transmit, receive, idle, and sleep. Current generation transceivers have built-in state machines that perform some operations automatically. Most transceivers operating in idle mode have a power consumption almost equal to the power consumed in receive mode.Y. Xu, J. Heidemann, and D. Estrin, Geography-informed energy conservation for ad hoc routing, in Proc. Mobicom, 2001, pp. 70–84 Thus, it is better to completely shut down the transceiver rather than leave it in the idle mode when it is not transmitting or receiving. A significant amount of power is consumed when switching from sleep mode to transmit mode in order to transmit a packet. External memory From an energy perspective, the most relevant kinds of memory are the on-chip memory of a microcontroller and Flash memory—off-chip RAM is rarely, if ever, used. Flash memories are used due to their cost and storage capacity. Memory requirements are very much application dependent. Two categories of memory based on the purpose of storage are: user memory used for storing application related or personal data, and program memory used for programming the device. Program memory also contains identification data of the device if present. Power source A wireless sensor node is a popular solution when it is difficult or impossible to run a mains supply to the sensor node. However, since the wireless sensor node is often placed in a hard-to-reach location, changing the battery regularly can be costly and inconvenient. An important aspect in the development of a wireless sensor node is ensuring that there is always adequate energy available to power the system. The sensor node consumes power for sensing, communicating and data processing. More energy is required for data communication than any other process. The energy cost of transmitting 1 Kb a distance of is approximately the same as that used for the execution of 3 million instructions by a 100 million instructions per second/W processor. Power is stored either in batteries or capacitors. Batteries, both rechargeable and non-rechargeable, are the main source of power supply for sensor nodes. They are also classified according to electrochemical material used for the electrodes such as NiCd (nickel-cadmium), NiZn (nickel-zinc), NiMH (nickel-metal hydride), and lithium-ion. Current sensors are able to renew their energy from solar sources, Radio Frequency(RF), temperature differences, or vibration. Two power saving policies used are Dynamic Power Management (DPM) and Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS).Dynamic Power Management in Wireless Sensor Networks, Amit Sinha and Anantha Chandrakasan, IEEE Design & Test of Computers, Vol. 18, No. 2, March–April 2001 DPM conserves power by shutting down parts of the sensor node which are not currently used or active. A DVS scheme varies the power levels within the sensor node depending on the non-deterministic workload. By varying the voltage along with the frequency, it is possible to obtain quadratic reduction in power consumption. Sensors Sensors are used by wireless sensor nodes to capture data from their environment. They are hardware devices that produce a measurable response to a change in a physical condition like temperature or pressure. Sensors measure physical data of the parameter to be monitored and have specific characteristics such as accuracy, sensitivity etc. The continual analog signal produced by the sensors is digitized by an analog-to-digital converter and sent to controllers for further processing. Some sensors contain the necessary electronics to convert the raw signals into readings which can be retrieved via a digital link (e.g. I2C, SPI) and many convert to units such as °C. Most sensor nodes are small in size, consume little energy, operate in high volumetric densities, be autonomous and operate unattended, and be adaptive to the environment. As wireless sensor nodes are typically very small electronic devices, they can only be equipped with a limited power source of less than 0.5-2 ampere-hour and 1.2-3.7 volts. Sensors are classified into three categories: passive, omnidirectional sensors; passive, narrow-beam sensors; and active sensors. Passive sensors sense the data without actually manipulating the environment by active probing. They are self powered; that is, energy is needed only to amplify their analog signal. Active sensors actively probe the environment, for example, a sonar or radar sensor, and they require continuous energy from a power source. Narrow-beam sensors have a well-defined notion of direction of measurement, similar to a camera. Omnidirectional sensors have no notion of direction involved in their measurements. Most theoretical work on WSNs assumes the use of passive, omnidirectional sensors. Each sensor node has a certain area of coverage for which it can reliably and accurately report the particular quantity that it is observing. Several sources of power consumption in sensors are: signal sampling and conversion of physical signals to electrical ones, signal conditioning, and analog-to-digital conversion.

Senegal has a long Atlantic coastline and a range of habitat types, with a corresponding diversity of plants and animals. Senegal has 188 species of mammals and 674 species of bird. Geography Senegal is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, Mauritania to the north, Mali to the east, and Guinea and Guinea-Bissau to the south. It has a long internal border with The Gambia which lies on either side of the Gambia River but is otherwise surrounded by Senegal. The four major rivers, the Senegal River, the Saloum River, the Gambia River and the Casamance River, drain westwards into the Atlantic Ocean. The Lac de Guiers is a large freshwater lake in the north of the country while Lake Retba, near Dakar, is saline. The northern half of the country has an arid or semi-arid climate and is largely desert while south of the Gambia River the rainfall is higher and the terrain consists of savannah grassland and forest. Much of the country is fairly flat and below the contour, but there are some low, rolling hills in the southeast, the foothills of the Fouta Djallon in Guinea. The northern half of the coast is sandy and flat, whereas south of Dakar it is muddy and swampy. The northern part of the country has a semi-arid climate, with precipitation increasing substantially further south to exceed in some areas. Winds blow from the southwest during the rainy season from May to November, and from the northeast during the rest of the year, resulting in well-defined humid and dry seasons. Dakar's maximum temperatures averages in the wet and in the dry season. Biodiversity With four main ecosystems (forest, savanna grassland, freshwater, marine and coastal), Senegal has a wide diversity of plants and animals. However, increases in human activities and changes in weather patterns which include increased deficits in rainfall, are impacting and degrading the natural habitats. This is particularly noticeable with regard to forests, which in the five years to 2010, were being lost at the rate of per year. Flora About 5,213 species, subspecies and varieties of vascular plants had been recorded in Senegal by the end of 2018, of which 515 were trees or woody plants. The Niokolo-Koba National Park is a World Heritage Site and large natural protected area in southeastern Senegal near the Guinea- Bissau border. The park is typical of the woodland savannah of the country. About thirty species of tree are found here, mainly from the families Fabaceae, Combretaceae and Anacardiaceae, and about one thousand species of vascular plant. The drier parts are dominated by the African kino tree and Combretum glutinosum, while the gallery forests beside rivers and streams (many of which dry up seasonally) are largely formed from Erythrophleum guineense and Pseudospondias microcarpa, interspersed with palms and bamboo clumps. Depressions in the ground fill with water in the rainy season and support a wide range of aquatic vegetation. In the coastal zone of Niayes, a coastal strip of land between Dakar and Saint Louis where a line of lakes lie behind the coastal sand dunes, the predominant vegetation is the African oil- palm, along with the African mesquite and Cape fig. Mammals Many of the larger animals of Senegal that used to have a widespread distribution have suffered from loss of habitat, persecution by farmers, and hunting for bushmeat, and are now largely restricted to the national parks. The Guinea baboon is one of these, as are the Senegal hartebeest, the western hartebeest, the scimitar oryx, the roan antelope and several species of gazelle. Habitat degradation has caused populations of western red colobus, the elephant, the lion and many other species to diminish in numbers. The western subspecies of the giant eland is critically endangered, the only remaining known population being in the Niokolo-Koba National Park; the rapid decline in numbers of this antelope has been attributed to poaching. Green monkey male, Senegal Other mammals found in the country include the green monkey, the Guinean gerbil and the Senegal one-striped grass mouse. Birds Some 674 species of bird had been recorded in Senegal by April 2019. Some of the more spectacular include the red-billed tropicbird, the Arabian bustard, the Egyptian plover, the golden nightjar, the red-throated bee-eater, the chestnut-bellied starling, the cricket warbler, the Kordofan lark and the Sudan golden sparrow. The Djoudj National Bird Sanctuary on the south side of the Senegal River Delta is an important site for migrating and overwintering waterfowl. About three million migratory birds spend the winter here. Birds that breed in the delta include the lesser flamingo, the marbled duck and the black crowned crane. Further south is the Saloum Delta National Park which lies on the East Atlantic Flyway, along which about 90 million birds migrate annually. Some birds that breed or winter in the park include the royal tern, the greater flamingo, the Eurasian spoonbill, the curlew sandpiper, the ruddy turnstone and the little stint. Another important wetland area is the Niayes, which is an important centre for waterbirds and raptors; large numbers of black kites have been recorded here. Fish Some 244 species of marine fish had been recorded off the coast of Senegal by April 2019. Some freshwater species of fish have been impacted by the creation of dams in the Senegal River Delta and the proliferation of some plants such as the southern cattail.

Mozambique has a range of different habitat types and an ecologically rich and diverse wildlife. This includes 236 species of mammal, 740 species of bird and 5,692 species of vascular plant. The Maputaland-Pondoland-Albany hotspot, with significantly high levels of biodiversity, stretches from the southern tip of Mozambique into northeastern South Africa. Geography Topography of Mozambique Mozambique is located on the southeast coast of Africa. It is bound by Eswatini to the south, South Africa to the south and southwest, Zimbabwe to the west, Zambia and Malawi to the northwest, Tanzania to the north and the Indian Ocean to the east. Mozambique lies between latitudes 10° and 27°S, and longitudes 30° and 41°E. The country is divided into two topographical regions by the Zambezi River. To the north of the Zambezi River, the narrow coastal strip gives way to inland hills and low plateaus. Rugged highlands are further west; they include the Niassa highlands, Namuli or Shire highlands, Angonia highlands, Tete highlands and the Makonde plateau, covered with miombo woodlands. To the south of the Zambezi River, the lowlands are broader with the Mashonaland plateau and Lebombo Mountains located in the deep south. The country is drained by five principal rivers and several smaller ones with the largest and most important being the Zambezi. There are four large lakes, all in the north of the country; Lake Niassa (or Malawi), Lake Chiuta, Lake Cahora Bassa and Lake Shirwa. Mozambique has a tropical climate with a wet season from October to March and a dry season from April to September. Climatic conditions, however, vary depending on altitude. Rainfall is heavy along the coast and decreases in the north and south of the country. Annual rainfall varies from depending on the region, with an average of . Average temperature ranges in Maputo are from in July and from in February. Much of the inland part of southern Mozambique is semi-desert. Flora Humid forest, near Pemba in Cabo Delgado Province in northern Mozambique. A total of 5,692 species of vascular plant has been recorded in the country, of which 145 species are considered to be threatened. Most of the terrain of Mozambique is covered by wooded savanna, grassland with a scattering of trees but an open canopy. In the northern part of the country this is miombo woodland, dominated by Brachystegia trees, covering about 70% of the country. In drier areas further south, mopane woodland predominates, with Acacia woodland in some areas in the south and in riverside locations in the north. Forest cover is mostly limited to the upper mountain slopes and some gallery forests, with some patches of dry lowland forests occurring in certain coastal areas, notably near Cape Delgado and around Dondo. The Maputaland-Pondoland-Albany Hotspot in southern Mozambique and northeastern South Africa, is a biogeographic region with significantly high levels of biodiversity and plant endemism. The scenery on many parts of the coast consists of thickets, scrubland and palm groves. The floodplains of the main rivers consist of alluvial grassland and marshes. The Zambezi Delta is a vast marshy area covering with grasses and Borassus palms, extending for along the coast. A fringe of mangroves can be found along much of the coast, the trees growing to a height of , and there are extensive areas of mangroves in the Zambezi and Messalo River deltas where the height of the trees can reach . Ten different species of mangrove have been recorded here, including Lumnitzera racemosa and Xylocarpus granatum. Fauna Some 236 species of mammal have been recorded in Mozambique, of which 17 species are considered threatened. Ungulates found here include the common warthog, the hippopotamus and the South African giraffe and around twenty species of antelope including the common eland, the Lichtenstein's hartebeest, the greater kudu, the sable antelope, the nyala, the waterbuck, the blue wildebeest and the Cape bushbuck. There are around fifty species of rodent, a dozen of shrew, over sixty species of bat and a single hedgehog, the four-toed hedgehog. Primates are represented by bushbabies, vervet monkeys, blue monkeys, chacma baboons and yellow baboons. There are African bush elephants, lions, leopards, Southeast African cheetahs, genets, mongooses, hyaenas, jackals and various other species of carnivore. Pale batis, a resident of miombo woodland Large numbers of birds are either resident in or migrate across Mozambique, 768 species having been recorded, including 34 globally threatened species. Some notable examples include the lesser jacana, the crab-plover, the mangrove kingfisher, the Böhm's bee-eater, the racket-tailed roller, the African pitta, the green- headed oriole, the collared palm thrush, the pale batis, the lowland tiny greenbul, the lesser seedcracker and the locust finch. There is also a rich fauna of reptiles and amphibians, with 225 species of reptile recorded in the country (as compiled by the Reptile Database), and 90 species of amphibian (compiled by AmphibiaWeb). There are numerous species of snake, with venomous species including the puff adder, several species of cobra, the black mamba and the boomslang. Non-venomous snakes include the green tree python, the mole snake, and the egg-eating snake. The Nile crocodile is only likely to be found in protected areas. The savannah monitor is the largest lizard in the country, but more common are the much smaller skinks, agamas, chamaeleons and house geckos. The leopard tortoise occurs here as well as three species of freshwater terrapin. With a long coastline, Mozambique boasts numerous marine vertebrates, including about twenty species of whale and ten of dolphin, the dugong, the brown fur seal and the southern elephant seal.This information is derived from the IUCN Red List which lists species of mammals and their distributions. The country has a large number of marine mollusc species, as well as plentiful numbers of terrestrial snails and slugs.Muratov I. V. (2010). \\"Terrestrial molluscs of Cabo Delgado and adjacent inland areas of north-eastern Mozambique\\". African Invertebrates 51 (2): 255-288. abstract. Protected areas Mozambique has seven national parks, two of which are largely marine, and six national reserves. Additionally, there are several other protected areas, three community wildlife utilisation areas, various wildlife utilisation areas and forest reserves. In reality, many of these have little protection and many animals were severely depleted as a result of the Mozambican Civil War (1977–1992) and the increase in poaching which took place at that time. More recently, efforts are being made to restock some of the protected areas with animals brought in from elsewhere, and facilities for visitors have improved, particularly at Gorongosa National Park.

Construction and acquisition Beaver was built in 1910, as a steel-hulled, single-screw, freight and passenger steamer at Newport News, Virginia, by the Newport News Shipbuilding Co. for the Union Pacific Railroad Company. She was purchased from the San Francisco & Portland Steamship Co. on 1 July 1918, for service in the U.S. Navy during World War I and given the classification Id. No. 2302. She was converted to a submarine tender at the Mare Island Navy Yard and was commissioned there on 1 October 1918, Lieutenant Commander James A. Logan in command. To prepare her to serve as mobile repair and maintenance facility for submarine squadrons, the yard workers installed a machine shop, electrical plant, battery shop, and refrigerator units inside the ship. Since her duties included providing boat services to submarines, the tender carried four motor launches, three motor boats, and five smaller craft. Transfer to Pacific and 1920s Assigned to the Pacific Station, her first service was to escort four of the newly constructed O-class submarines (O-boats) from San Pedro, California, to Coco Solo in the Canal Zone. There she was assigned as tender to Submarine Division 14 (SubDiv 14). At this time, because diesel submarines had limited range and were prone to engine failures, their operations were generally confined to the coastal waters off American submarine bases. Before the war, there was only one submarine tender in commission and only three submarine bases in operation: one at New London, Connecticut; another at San Pedro, California, and the third at Coco Solo in Panama. In order to expand operations and provide bases for the growing numbers of submarines being built during World War I, the Navy commissioned Beaver and four other tenders and began looking for new base locations. In the Pacific, with Japan viewed as the major threat to American security, naval and military planners began building up the defenses of Hawaii and other possessions. In Hawaii, four F-boats had been stationed at Honolulu and at Kuahua Island in Pearl Harbor from 21 July 1914. Their crews had built a small pier at the latter location before returning to the west coast on 14 November 1915. In order to improve this facility and create a permanent submarine base at Pearl Harbor, Beaver received orders to Hawaii in early 1919. She escorted six of the new R-boats from San Pedro to Oahu that spring, arriving at Kuahua Island in early July. The tender's crew then helped the submariners build an administrative building, a mess hall, and shops to service and overhaul the boats. The following year, Beaver was ordered east to tend Atlantic Fleet submarines. Departing the Hawaiian Islands on 18 February 1920, she transited the Panama Canal and arrived at Cristóbal, Colón on 25 March. From there, she proceeded to Kingston, Jamaica, and Havana, Cuba, before arriving at Hampton Roads, Virginia on 10 April. After repairs at the Philadelphia Navy Yard from 12 April-14 May followed by two weeks of liberty at New York, the tender then escorted submarines , , , and from New London to the Panama Canal from 3–27 June. She spent the next year operating on \\"detached service\\", presumably providing repair and support services to submarines up and down the east coast. On 17 July 1920, the Navy adopted the alphanumeric system of hull classification and identification, and Beaver was designated AS-5. The tender's only unusual duty came in September, when she assisted the unsuccessful attempt to salvage submarine that had sunk off the Delaware Capes on the 1st. In December 1920, Beaver received orders to repeat her 1919 service by escorting six S-boats of SubDiv 18 to the Pacific. This time, however, she was to convoy them all the way to the Philippine Islands. After several months of preparation, the division sailed via the Panama Canal and San Pedro, California, to Hawaii. From there, the tender and her charges made the long non-stop run from Hawaii to Guam. After a stop for fuel and supplies at Apra, the division arrived off Sangley Point in Manila Bay on 1 December 1921. Over the next six months, the tender's crew helped improve the submarine base at Cavite and supported local operations by the division's diesel boats. On 5 June 1922, Beaver sailed for the west coast via the \\"Great Circle Course\\" across the central Pacific. In between visits to Guam and Hawaii, she paid a brief call at Wake Island on the 19th to make a survey of the island. One officer on the survey team, Lieutenant Commander Sherwood Picking from the Aeronautical Test Laboratory in Washington, D.C., later wrote, from \\"a strategic point of view, Wake Island could not be better located, dividing as it does with Midway, the passage from Honolulu to Guam into almost exact thirds.\\" The survey concluded that some dredging and blasting would be necessary for Wake Island to serve as a submarine base. After reaching San Pedro on 14 July, the tender received orders to continue on to the east coast. Departing San Pedro on the 25th, Beaver escorted eight H-boats and four L-boats south toward the Panama Canal. As the submarines were small, and suffered from engine breakdowns, the tender had to tow as many as three submarines at a time during the long stretches between ports. The convoy stopped at Magdalena Bay and Acapulco in Mexico and at Corinto, Nicaragua, before mooring at Coco Solo in the Canal Zone on 28 August. Following two weeks of repairs, the convoy transited the canal on 11 September and arrived at Hampton Roads, Virginia, via Key West, Florida, on the 29th. Assigned to SubDiv 17, the tender spent the next six months operating in Atlantic waters. She escorted her submarine charges to Norfolk, Virginia, New York, Newport, Rhode Island, and Portsmouth that fall, before ending the year at the submarine base in New London. Transferred to SubDiv 11, Beaver then convoyed that division to the West Indies in January 1923 for the annual \\"fleet problem\\", the fleet maneuvers that served as the culmination of the training year. In February–March, in company with and , the submarine tender supported operations in the Gulf of Panama as the submarines attempted to \\"defend the Canal Zone\\" in war games against the Battle Fleet. In April, the Commander, Submarine Division, Pacific, transferred his flag from Camden to Beaver. The tender then joined SubDiv 16, consisting of six of the new S-boats, and escorted them back through the canal and on to San Pedro, arriving there at the end of the month. On 9 June, Beaver and four of her S-boats sailed north for a cruise in Alaskan waters. This was the first visit by American submarines to this region, and the squadron spent nearly three months surveying the straits and coastal islands for a possible submarine base. In mid-August, after a stop at Vancouver, British Columbia, the squadron visited Astoria, Oregon, to look over a site contemplated for another submarine base. Finally, Beaver and her charges returned to San Pedro on 25 August. The tender supported local submarine operations off California for the remainder of the year. On 2 January 1924, Beaver, in company with ten submarines of SubDivs 16 and 17, steamed south from San Pedro for another fleet exercise in the West Indies. Unlike the previous spring, however, this time the submarines sailed in company with the Battle Fleet, which had been operating in the Pacific since the previous year. The submarines first made the long non-stop cruise to Balboa, Canal Zone, on the Pacific side of the transisthmian waterway. Then the entire force steamed thence through the canal to participate in extensive war games in the West Indies with the Scouting Fleet. In addition to operations at sea, the submarine divisions visited Haiti, the Virgin Islands, and Trinidad. The tender and her charges returned to San Diego, via the canal, in May 1924 and remained there through the end of the year. Beaver got underway from Mare Island, California on 14 April 1925, bound ultimately for the Asiatic Station. In company with five submarines of SubDiv 16, she first stopped at Honolulu for maneuvers with the Battle Fleet in Hawaiian waters. The following month, after turning over the flag of Pacific Submarines to Savannah, Beaver sailed for the Philippines with six S-boats of SubDiv 16, arriving at Manila on 12 July. Over the next seven years, Beaver tended SubDiv 16 in Philippine and Chinese waters. As service on the Asiatic Station was influenced by the monsoon seasons, the tender followed a standard pattern of annual operations. In the spring and summer, she shifted base from Manila Bay to Tsingtao, China, and supported submarine cruises up and down the Chinese coast. These included stops at Hong Kong, Swatow, Amoy, Shanghai, Weihai, and Tientsin. From the latter port, leave parties often visited Peking. In the fall and winter, as the monsoons moved southwest toward French Indochina and the Dutch East Indies, the tender and her charges shifted back to the Philippines for operations out of Cavite. 1930s Before steaming to China in 1930, Beaver led SubDiv 16 on a cruise through the southern Philippine Islands. Following port visits to Iloilo on Panay and Zamboanga on Mindanao, the submarine division then visited the Sultan of Sulu at Jolo, an island in the Sulu archipelago. On its return to Manila from China late that year, the division surveyed the unfamiliar waters off the east coast of Formosa. Beaver departed Manila on 1 May 1932, in company with six S-boats from SubDiv 9, and sailed for Hawaii, arriving in Pearl Harbor on the 30th. There, while submarines , , , , , and were placed in reserve commission, Beaver was reassigned to Submarine Squadron 4 (SubRon 4). For the next seven years, Beaver remained in Hawaiian waters, tending submarines during local operations and steaming occasionally to Wake Island, Midway, and French Frigate Shoals for deployment exercises. The tender also participated in every fleet exercise held in Hawaiian waters during the 1930s. She missed the last fleet problem in 1940, however, as the tender was in San Diego during February for a major overhaul. Intended to improve her capability to support submarines overseas, Beavers modernization also included the installation of new repair equipment and the latest communications gear. The tender sailed for the east coast in November 1940, passing through the Panama Canal and arriving at her new home port of New London, Connecticut, at the end of that month. There, she joined the growing numbers of warships in the Atlantic following the September 1940 \\"destroyers-for-bases\\" deal between the United States and Britain. The agreement, which transferred 50 \\"overage\\" destroyers to the Royal Navy in exchange for 99-year leases on bases in the Western Hemisphere, allowed American forces to move into particularly important islands in the West Indies. Over the next year, naval engineers and civilian contractors set up a network of seaplane and naval bases to protect the approaches to the Panama Canal. During 1940, Beaver helped establish a submarine base at Gregerie Channel in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, and operated at the seaplane base near Hamilton, Bermuda. She also served as temporary flagship for Atlantic Fleet submarines before becoming the tender for SubRon 7 based at New London in April. Following American entry into World War II on 7 December 1941, Beaver led 11 R-boats to the seaplane base in Bermuda, arriving there on the 10th. For the next nine months, the tender alternated between Bermuda and New London, supporting submarine patrols along the Caribbean-Bermuda-New England shipping lanes and assisting antisubmarine training for American destroyers. World War II in the Atlantic On 3 September 1942, Beaver and six submarines formed SubRon 50 at New London, a special unit intended for Operation \\"Torch\\" — the planned November landings in French North Africa. In October, while five of her submarines sailed with Task Group 34.11 (TG 34.11) for operations off North Africa, Beaver joined convoy HX 212, bound for the United Kingdom. On 24 October, the 48-ship convoy ran into a patrol line of German U-boats which closed to attack. Starting on the 26th, and continuing over the next two nights, seven U-boats attacked the convoy. Although the convoy escorts — including the Coast Guard cutter Campbell and three British Commonwealth corvettes — drove off most of the attackers, three merchant ships were sunk and another two damaged by U-boats that broke through the defensive screen. The rest of the ships, including Beaver, came under RAF air cover out of Iceland on the 28th and arrived at the Firth of Clyde on 1 November. The submarine tender then steamed to the Rosneath naval base near Rosneath, where she established a temporary submarine base for SubRon 50. After the squadron's submarines returned from \\"Torch\\" operations, where they had conducted reconnaissance patrols off the beaches, they were assigned patrol areas in the Bay of Biscay. Between December 1942 and March 1943, the submarines searched for blockade runners out of neutral Spanish ports. Starting in April, they patrolled off Norway, Iceland, and then the mid-Atlantic, searching for enemy U-boats and waiting in case the German surface fleet broke out from its Scandinavian bases. World War II Pacific Service and fate On 15 July 1943, Beaver sailed for the United States and, after an uneventful passage, arrived in New York later that month. Needed to support the growing American submarine offensive in the Pacific, the tender got underway 10 days later for San Diego, via the Panama Canal. After a brief overhaul in San Diego, she sailed for Alaska on 20 September. Assigned to SubRon 45 at Dutch Harbor, Beaver furnished tender services to North Pacific Force submarines when they returned from patrols in the northern Kurils and the Sea of Okhotsk. Her crew also helped establish and run a submarine base at Attu. On 12 February 1944, the tender returned to San Diego, where her crew set up a submarine training school in conjunction with the Navy's West Coast Sound School. Beaver remained at San Diego — tending S-boats during training operations — until late June 1945. Ordered into drydock for conversion to an internal combustion engine repair ship, she was redesignated ARG-19 on 25 June 1945. Following two months of repair and conversion, she departed San Diego on 28 August for duty with the service force in occupied Japan. The ship remained in Japanese waters — tending the multitude of small craft in use by the Navy — until March, 1946, when she crossed the China Sea and steamed up the Yangtze River in China and then on to the Huangpu River where she remained until May,1946. She then returned to the west coast, anchoring in Puget Sound, in the state of Washington.I served aboard the Beaver during her voyage through the Pacific, to Okinawa,Japan and China. Beaver was decommissioned on 17 July 1946 and turned over to the War Shipping Administration for disposal on 5 August. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 August, and she was sold to the Boston Metals Corp. for scrapping on 28 August 1950.

Commonly known as Hill Banksia or Golden Candlesticks, it is a taxonomic variety of B. spinulosa (Hairpin Banksia). It is a popular garden plant widely sold in nurseries. Description As with the other varieties of B. spinulosa (Hairpin Banksia), B. spinulosa var. collina grows as a multi-stemmed lignotuberous shrub with flower spikes that are all golden or golden with red or purple styles. Its leaves are broader than those of B. spinulosa var. spinulosa, and usually but not always serrate. It can be distinguished from B. spinulosa var. cunninghamii by its lignotuber and resultant multi-stemmed habit. p. 394–396 Taxonomy B. spinulosa var. collina was first published as Banksia collina by Robert Brown in 1810, based on specimens he found among hills in the vicinity of the Hunter River, New South Wales in New South Wales in 1802. Brown did not give an explicit reason for the specific epithet \\"collina\\", but it is universally accepted that it is from the Latin collinus (\\"of hills\\"), in reference to the topography of the area in which he first found it. The species is in fact not restricted to hilly terrain, so the specific epithet is misleading. p. 117. Brown apparently neglected to collect a specimen for the taxon, so a specimen collected by George Caley at Newcastle has since been declared a neotype. It retained its specific rank in Brown's 1830 arrangement of Banksia, being placed in subgenus Banksia verae, the \\"True Banksias\\", because its inflorescence is a typical Banksia flower spike. It was placed immediately after B. cunninghamii (now B. spinulosa var. cunninghamii) and B. spinulosa, and before B. occidentalis (Red Swamp Banksia). Banksia verae was renamed Eubanksia by Stephan Endlicher in 1847. Carl Meissner demoted Eubanksia to sectional rank in his 1856 classification, and divided it into four series, with B. collina placed alongside B. cunninghamii in series Salicinae, while B. spinulosa was placed in series Abietinae. The following year a taxonomic synonym was published: seeds of this variety must have been sent to Russia, as in 1857 the name Banksia guentheri was published by Eduard August von Regel, based on material cultivated in Leningrad; this has since been declared a taxonomic synonym of B. spinulosa var. collina. This was determined to be a taxonomic synonym of B. collina shortly afterwards, and was formally declared a synonym of B. spinulosa var. collina by George in 1981. When George Bentham published his 1870 arrangement in Flora Australiensis, he discarded Meissner's series, placing all the species with hooked styles together in a section that he named Oncostylis. B. collina was placed between B. spinulosa and B. verticillata (Granite Banksia), and both B. cunninghamii and the western species B. littoralis (Western Swamp Banksia) were reduced to synonymy with it. This arrangement would stand for over a century. A major disruption to the nomenclature of Banksia occurred in 1890, when Otto Kuntze transferred the entire genus into the new name Sirmuellera. In the process he transferred B. collina to Sirmuellera collina. This transfer was not accepted, however, and Sirmuellera collina (R.Br.) Kuntze is now considered a nomenclatural synonym of B. s. var. collina. Alex George published a new taxonomic arrangement of Banksia in his landmark 1981 monograph The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae). Endlicher's Eubanksia became B. subg. Banksia, and was divided into three sections, one of which was Oncostylis. Oncostylis was further divided into four series, with B. spinulosa placed in series Spicigerae because its inflorescences are cylindrical. B. collina was demoted to one of three varieties of B. spinulosa, and placed between B. spinulosa var. spinulosa and B. spinulosa var. cunninghamii. In 1996, Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges published a new arrangement for the genus, after cladistic analyses yielded a cladogram significantly different from George's arrangement. Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement retained B. spinulosa var. collinas position within the B. spinulosa complex, and retained B. spinulosa in series Spicigerae, but placed the species alone in B. subser. Spinulosae. This arrangement stood until 1999, when George effectively reverted to his 1981 arrangement in his monograph for the Flora of Australia series. Under George's taxonomic arrangement of Banksia, B. spinulosa var. collina's taxonomic placement may be summarised as follows: A 1924 watercolour by Alan Forster :Genus Banksia ::Subgenus Banksia :::Section Banksia :::Section Coccinea :::Section Oncostylis ::::Series Spicigerae :::::B. spinulosa ::::::B. spinulosa var. spinulosa ::::::B. spinulosa var. collina ::::::B. spinulosa var. neoanglica ::::::B. spinulosa var. cunninghamii :::::B. ericifolia :::::B. verticillata :::::B. seminuda :::::B. littoralis :::::B. occidentalis :::::B. brownii ::::Series Tricuspidae ::::Series Dryandroidae ::::Series Abietinae ::Subgenus Isostylis Since 1998, Austin Mast has been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for the subtribe Banksiinae. His analyses suggest a phylogeny that is very greatly different to George's arrangement. George's and Thiele and Ladiges' positioning of B. spinulosa var. collina within B. spinulosa is supported, but B. spinulosa's placement is not. Series Spicigerae appears to be polyphyletic, with B. spinulosa and B. ericifolia more closely related to the taxa in Series Salicinae than it is to the other members of series Spicigerae. Early in 2007, Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement of Banksia by merging Dryandra into it, and publishing B. subg. Spathulatae for the species having spoon-shaped cotyledons. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then B. spinulosa var. collina is placed in B. subg. Spathulatae. Distribution and habitat It mainly occurs along the coast from Gympie in Queensland south to Sydney. There are also outlying populations at Carnarvon National Park (around 500 kilometres from any other population), Crows Nest and Mount Barney National Park in Queensland, and at Boonoo Boonoo. It mainly grows in sand overlying sandstone, but also occurs in heavier soils. It is usually an understory shrub in open forests and woodlands of Eucalyptus. Cultivation A painting of a plant tentatively identified as B. littoralis, but later attributed by George Bentham to B. spinulosa var. collina, was featured in Curtis's Botanical Magazine in 1831. As with other varieties of B. spinulosa it is considered attractive, but is highly variable. It grows slowly, taking up to eight years to flower. It tolerates a range of soil conditions and aspects, survives frosts down to at least , and may be pruned heavily. Commercial forms of this variety include Banksia \\"Stumpy Gold\\" from the NSW Central Coast, and the unusual Banksia \\"Carnarvon Gold\\" from Carnarvon National Park.

Cricket career Wilcox was born in Newton Abbot. After attending Alleyn Court Prep School and Malvern College, he went up to Pembroke College, Cambridge. A right-handed batsman and occasional right-arm off-break bowler, he began his first-class cricket career with Cambridge University in 1961, his debut coming against Kent. He played eleven further first-class matches for Cambridge until the end of 1962, but he did not win a blue for cricket. He did, however, win blues for rackets and real tennis. Wilcox made his debut County Championship appearance for Essex in 1964, six years after his debut in the Minor Counties Championship for the Essex Second XI. Wilcox's first appearance, against Northamptonshire, finished in an innings defeat. Towards the end of the 1964 season, he scored 46 not out in a game against the touring Australians that Essex won.Wisden 1965, p. 316. Essex finished the 1964 season in tenth place, an improvement on the previous year's performance. Wilcox scored 367 runs in 10 matches at an average of 36.70, with three fifties. Wilcox made his highest score in May 1965 when, going in to bat against Worcestershire with Essex at 154 for 6, he added 139 for the seventh wicket with Trevor Bailey and finished with 87. Essex won by 48 runs.Wisden 1966, p. 367. Nevertheless he made only four Championship appearances that season,Wisden 1966, p. 366. finding himself out of the team after a second- innings duck against Somerset, and he did not appear in the County Championship again until August 1967, when he played his last four matches. Wilcox's father Denys played first-class cricket for Essex for nearly 20 years, captaining the team for six years before the Second World War. Later career Wilcox played for Essex only when his duties as a schoolmaster allowed.Stephen Chalke, Caught in the Memory, Fairfield Books, Bath, 1999, pp. 100–101. He taught at Alleyn Court Prep School in Westcliff-on-Sea, which his grandfather had founded in 1904, and where his father had been headmaster. John also became headmaster of Alleyn Court, serving in that position from 1968 to 1990. He was then the chairman of the school board for 20 years, and remains on the school's board of trustees. In 2005 he wrote the school's centenary history, Impressions of a Family School: 100 Years of Alleyn Court. After he retired from teaching in 1990 he founded the Court Gallery in West Quantoxhead, Somerset. The gallery specialises in British and French art from 1880 onwards.

His family reportedly came from the hamlet of Allaleigh and this may account for the origins of his name. Career He was Mayor of Dartmouth on fourteen occasions between 1374 and 1401 and was elected MP for Dartmouth four times, in 1390, 1393, 1394 and 1402.Rose (2004)Woodger (1993) Hawley was both a merchant and licensed privateer though he was often accused of piracy. He conducted a number of naval operations in the English Channel and briefly held the post of deputy to the Admiral of England under King Henry IV (1399-1413). He organised the defence of Dartmouth in 1404 against an attack by a Breton fleet, which culminated in the Battle of Blackpool Sands.

It was founded in February 1995 and is one of the two La Consolacion schools in the city, and one of the 24 schools owned and administered by the Augustinian Sisters of Our Lady of Consolation (ASOLC) . La Consolacion College - Novaliches is the first Catholic educational institution in North Caloocan. The school also holds the distinction of having the largest contiguous campus in the CAMANAVA region. History It was founded in February 1995 and incorporated by the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 30, 1995. It used to be known as La Consolacion School - Deparo when the high school and college levels were not yet open for enrollments. Upon the late 1990s, the school started using the name La Consolacion College - Deparo. Deparo is a barangay in the northern district of Caloocan City where the campus is situated. The former Saint Joseph Academy in Caloocan built in the vicinity of the old city hall, which is now known as La Consolacion College Caloocan was established much earlier in Barangay Dagat-dagatan, prior the Second World War. To avoid confusion with the campus in South Caloocan and to attract students from the nearby district of Novaliches, and the Bulacan towns of Meycauayan, Marilao, and San Jose del Monte, the administration opted the use of the name La Consolacion College - Novaliches. Location and Facilities Novaliches is officially a part of Quezon City, but Novaliches has been a colloquial umbrella term for the barangays of Caloocan that are situated close to the Novaliches district of Quezon City. La Consolacion College - Novaliches has the largest campus among all schools administered by the Augustinian Sisters of Our Lady of Consolation. Its location in the North district of Caloocan City is in Villa Maria Subdivision of Barangay Deparo, which is a few meters away from the border of Barangay Bagumbong. Within the campus stands a steel lattice transmission tower, several hills, farms, gardens, and forests. It is a 5-hectare urban campus, with several buildings connected by long covered walks and driveways. The campus makes use of solar panels for their electricity, with most of the solar panels located above the Covered Court. Tagaste Hill Tagaste Hill is named after the city of Thagaste as a homage to the school patron saint Augustine of Hippo. Atop the hill is the location of the botanical garden. Mother Rita Barcelo Outreach Building This building houses the office and classroom built to support the school's educational outreach program, which caters to the impoverished children living in the campus vicinity. Santo Niño Building The Santo Niño Building is a one- storey building which houses the pre-school and primary grade classrooms, an extension of the school store and cafeteria, and a playground. The Santo Niño Building is connected to the Mother Rita Barcelo Building by a covered walk that is estimated to be about 700 feet. Mother Rita Barcelo Building The Mother Rita Barcelo Building is a four-storey building which houses the intermediate and high school students, and several laboratories catering to several courses for the grade levels housed. It is connected to the Our Lady of Consolation Building by a patio. Main Canteen The Main Canteen is connected to the Mother Rita Barcelo Building as an annex. The canteen can accommodate around 300+ persons at the same time. Our Lady of Consolation Building The Our Lady of Consolation Building, also known as the Administrative Building, is a four-storey building which houses the convent of the nuns, several administrative offices, faculty rooms, mini-hotel, laboratories, library, and classrooms. The classrooms of this building mostly cater to the college students. On its topmost floor story is an enclosed multipurpose hall that can accommodate more than a thousand guests. Mother Consuelo Barcelo Building The Mother Consuelo Barcelo Building was built in the 2010s with three floors, to cater to the growing number of students, due to the implementation of K12 in the Philippines. It is connected to the Mother Rita Barcelo Building and the Covered Court by concrete walkways. Covered Court The Covered Court caters to most of the extra-curricular activities and physical education classes of the Basic Education Department. Student Life The students are grouped into sections named after Catholic saints who are mostly members of the Augustinian order, archangels, and titles of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Every beginning and end of each class, students are to pray Catholic prayers where at the end of the prayer is a call for the intercession of the section saint. Students are engaged in several extra- curricular activities. The student body is represented and lead by the Central Student Government, which holds elections a few weeks before the end of the school year for organizational transitions. The Central Student Government involves students from fourth grade and above. In order to purchase food from the cafeteria and several items in the school store, students are asked to use the tokens bearing the seal of the Augustinian Order, which they can purchase from stations around the campus. The First Friday Masses are usually celebrated by the parish priest of the Mother of the Redeemer Parish of Deparo. During October, the students pray the Rosary every school day. The flag ceremonies are held every school day with the singing of the National Anthem, the patriotic oath, and daily Catholic Gospel readings. Since 2002, the prayer for the beatification of Venerable Mother Consuelo Barcelo is included in the morning rites. As part of Catholic tradition, everyone in the campus, including guests and staff, are required to pause during the praying of the Angelus at noon and the Divine Mercy First Prayer every three in the afternoon.

It is probably the fourth church on the site. The third, the Norman Chapel, stands in the churchyard. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. The Norman Chapel, the lychgate and west wall, the Hearse House, and the sundial in the churchyard are listed at Grade II. It is a Church of England parish church in the diocese of Chester, the archdeaconry of Macclesfield and the deanery of Macclesfield. History There is compelling evidence that there was a church at Prestbury (\\"priest’s enclosure\\") in the Anglo-Saxon era. After the Norman conquest of England, the church, probably the second on the site, came into the possession of the powerful baron Hugh Kyvelioc who gave it to the Abbey of St Werburgh in 1170-1173. The monks demolished the Anglo-Saxon church and built what is now called the Norman Chapel. The chapel served as a place of worship for the vast Parish of Prestbury until after the Magna Carta and the deaths of King John and Pope Innocent III in 1216. In 1220, the monks, supported by the Davenports of Marton (and later Henbury), the Piggots of Butley and the family de Corona (predecessors of the Leghs of Adlington) started to build what became the chancel and nave of the present church. Rather than incorporate the chapel into the new building, as was often done, they left it in the churchyard. Some time later, it was given to the Davenports for use as a place of burial and perhaps as a private chapel. During the next three centuries, the church was enlarged and the tower was erected. As a Roman Catholic church, worship in Latin was conducted at the high altar behind the rood screen. Rich vestments and ornaments were in use. With the dissolution of the monasteries, the Abbey of St Werburgh ceased to exist. The newly created Diocese of Chester (1541) administered Prestbury until Sir Richard Cotton purchased the manor and advowson in 1547. A few years afterwards, in 1580, Thomas Legh of Adlington acquired the manor and advowson and became Lay Rector of Prestbury. The Legh family has held the manor and advowson of Prestbury ever since. St Peter's Church before the general restorationPublic worship in Latin was abolished by the Acts of Uniformity. A pulpit was erected in 1560. The high altar and the rood loft were taken down during the years 1563-72 and a moveable Communion table was set up. The church was transformed during the Georgian period to suit the contemporaneous style of worship. Pews (1707) filled the building. In 1710 a canopied three-decker pulpit was erected in the nave. Between 1711 and 1712, a large gallery was built at the western end of the church, with access from external staircases on both sides of the tower. A ceiling was put up in 1719 and decorated in 1720. In 1741-1742, the north aisle was rebuilt. In a general restoration designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott which took place between 1879 and 1888, the pews were replaced, the three-decker pulpit was dismantled, the gallery and the ceiling were removed and the north aisle was again rebuilt. Further changes took place during the 20th and the first few years of the 21st centuries and no doubt will continue to take place. Churchyard The Lychgate was built in 1715 and re-sited to its present position in 1728.St Peter's Churchyard The outstanding feature of the churchyard is the Norman Chapel.Prestbury Cheshire Website. Retrieval date: 26 September 2007. Dating from 1175-1190, it began to fall into disrepair a few years after the present church came into use. In 1747 it was rebuilt by Sir William Meredith of Henbury so that his son Amos and other members of his family could be buried there. Restored in 1953, it is now used for a variety of church purposes. Fragments of a cross of late Saxon origin were discovered in about 1880 built into the wall of the church. At one time they were thought to date from the late seventh or early eighth centuries, but are now believed to be 10th or 11th century. Pieces of the cross have been put together and now stand in the churchyard near the Norman Chapel. It has been registered as a scheduled monument. Yew trees in the churchyard date from the time of the Hundred Years' War. The sundial (needed to correct the church clock) dates from 1672. It was improved in 1771 but the gnomon is missing. The forerunner of the Hearse House was built in 1728. The present Hearse House dates from 1852. It is used to store garden tools. The churchyard contains the war graves of twelve Commonwealth service personnel, seven from World War I and five from World War II. Church building Ground plan The nave is twenty-two feet wide. The north aisle and the south aisle are twenty-one and ten feet wide respectively. The chancel is nineteen feet wide. The south porch is fifteen feet square. The tower is twenty-three feet square with walls four feet thick. It is seventy-two feet high. The main body of the church (the nave and chancel) was built during 1220-1230 in the Early English style. The south Aisle and the first north aisle were added in 1310. The tower and south porch were built around 1480 and are the only parts of the building to survive in essentially their original form. The clerestory with four windows each side and the bell-cot are early sixteenth century. In 1612 three of the four fourteenth century windows in the south aisle were replaced by square windows. The 1741-2 north aisle had five round-headed windows which contrasted with the windows of the south aisle. Two of the round-headed windows survived the general restoration of 1879-1888. The vestry to the north of the chancel was added during the general restoration of 1879-1888. South Porch and South Aisle Interior The main west door leads through the West Porch, the Parish's memorial to the dead of the two World Wars. Above the porch is the ringers’ gallery (1637). It was formerly an organ loft. The bells date from 1820. They were recast in 1968. Nave Warden’s pews at the west end of the nave survived the general restoration. The roof (1675) Scrapbook of Cheshire Antiquities, accessed 27 September 2007 replaced an earlier one. The timbering is rough as it was not designed to be exposed. The nave chandelier is dated 1814. Electric lighting replaced acetylene gas in 1936. Ancient candle brackets remain on the pillars and the south wall. Paintings above the pillars represent the twelve apostles and the twelve tribes of Israel. They were executed in 1719 by the travelling painter who had decorated the eighteenth- century ceiling which was removed as part of the general restoration. The pulpit is Jacobean (1607). It was found in 1858 encased in the three-decker pulpit which had been made in 1710. It had replaced the 1560 pulpit. A fragment of heraldic glass from an early window in the Legh chapel (1601) is now kept in an illuminated cabinet at the west end of the nave, near a memorial book remembering those who lost their lives in the two World Wars. In 2001 a three-manual Allen Renaissance Digital Organ was installed to replace the pipe organ. At the same time a dais was installed with space for a nave communion table. Chancel Incised slab commemorating Reginald Legh The chancel is entered through a screen which had been erected in 1740 for the Legh Chapel. It has borne the Hanoverian Arms since 1787. A memorial slab built into the north wall of the sanctuary is the oldest memorial in the church (1482). It commemorates Reginald Legh who helped to build the tower and south porch. This and other slabs were built into the walls when the church was cleared of altar-tombs. The two-tier chandelier in the chancel is dated 1712. The east window (1915) represents the river and tree of life as described in Revelations, 22: 1-2. It replaced an earlier window which was had been inserted sixty years previously. A thirteenth century three-light window in the north side of the chancel is filled with simulated organ pipes. The main window in the south of the chancel has a representation of Christ’s call of St Peter. It was inserted in 1981. Most of the other glass in the church dates from 1882-1896. North aisle The 13th century font at the west end of the aisle was refaced and recut in 1857. The sculptured heads may represent monks or lay brothers from the Abbey of St Werburgh. At the east end of the north aisle is the Legh Chantry Chapel,Scrapbook of Cheshire Antiquities, accessed 3 October 2007 separated from the rest of the aisle by a heavy oak screen. South aisle At the east end of the south aisle, the Tytherington Chantry Chapel, dedicated to St Nicholas, was created in 1350. A 14th century piscina with a carved head typical of the period projects from the wall. A small figure of St Nicholas at the top of the east window of the south aisle is 14th Century, the oldest piece of glass in the church.

He held the highest governmental offices of Italy, Gaul, and Egypt, \\"an accomplishment not often recorded – Caesar and Napoleon Bonaparte are the only parallels that come to mind!\\" as James O'Donnell observes in his biographical study of the man.James J. O'Donnell, \\"Liberius the Patrician\\", Traditio, 37 (1981), p. 33  Origins and family  The exact origin of Liberius is unknown, but it is speculated that he came from Liguria. His family certainly did not belong to the upper senatorial class of Italy. He was married to Agretia, and had several sons and a daughter. Almost nothing is known of them, except that one of his sons, Venantius, was appointed consul in 507 and held the ceremonial office of comes domesticorum vacans some time later.O'Donnell, \\"Liberius\\", p. 34  Career under the Goths   Prefect of Italy  After the deposition of the last Western emperor, Romulus Augustus, by Odoacer in 476, the Roman administrative apparatus in Italy continued to function under the new regime. It continued to be staffed exclusively by Romans, and adhering to the pretense that Italy was still nominally a part of the Empire. Several senatorial families continued to serve in high administrative posts, and the young Liberius followed this tradition. Despite his youth he seems to have distinguished himself, for in 493, after Odoacer's murder, the new master of Italy, the Ostrogoth Theodoric the Great, appointed him to the highest civil office of praetorian prefect of Italy. He continued to serve in this capacity until 500, when he was retired and given the rank of patricius. His tenure was a success, as he proved capable in dealing with financial matters and in handling the sensitive issue of Gothic settlement, something reflected in the lavish praise he received from his contemporaries, Magnus Felix Ennodius and Cassiodorus.O'Donnell, \\"Liberius\\", pp. 36–39  Prefect of Gaul  In 508, Theodoric conquered the territory of Provence in southern Gaul, and in 510 decided to re-establish the defunct Praetorian prefecture of Gaul to administer the territory, with seat at Arelatum. Theodoric selected Liberius for the post, a sign of the king's trust in both his ability and his loyalty. Liberius served in that capacity until 536, when he returned to Italy, the longest such period on record for such a high office.O'Donnell, \\"Liberius\\", pp. 44–46 Liberius' prime responsibility seems to have been the pacification of the new and war-torn province, a task he appears to have accomplished. In this he had the assistance of the local bishop, Caesarius. Sometime in the mid-520s, Liberius was stabbed in the abdomen with a spear during a Visigoth raid, and lay near death. The arrival of the bishop \\"miraculously\\" cured him, and a similar episode is recounted concerning his wife, Agretia.Vita Caesarii Arelatensis, 2.10–15. Translated by William E. Klingshirn, Caesarius of Arles: Life, Testament, Letters (Liverpool: University Press, 1994), pp. 48–51 Possibly in a gesture of gratitude for his salvation, he built a new cathedral in Orange, where in 529 the Second Council of Orange was held; Liberius's signature appears first in the list of laymen endorsing the acts of the council.O'Donnell, \\"Liberius\\", pp. 54, 57–59 He also founded a monastery near Alatri, south of Rome: again, we may wonder whether this was a gesture of gratitude.Gregory the Great Dialogues. ed by Adalbert de Vogüé, 260. This monastery has been identified with that of S. Sebastiano, still standing 3 km from Alatri.Fentress,E. Goodson, C., Laird, M. and Leone, S. Walls and Memory. The Abbey of San Sebastiano at Alatri (Lazio) from Late Roman Monastery to Renaissance Villa and Beyond, Turnhout, 2005, 32–70 Upon the death of Theodoric in 526, he was given the title of patricius praesentalis, which O'Donnell notes \\"represents the only known case in the history of the Ostrogothic kingdom in which a Roman civilian was granted a significant military command.\\"O'Donnell, \\"Liberius\\", p. 60 By 534, however, Liberius was back in Italy.  Embassy to Constantinople  At that time, the Ostrogothic Kingdom faced a succession dispute. After Theodoric's death, his grandson, Athalaric was crowned king. As he was only an infant, his mother, Amalasuntha, assumed the regency. Her close relations to the Eastern Roman Emperor, Justinian, however, made her unpopular amongst the Gothic nobility. The young king, in the meantime, indulged in pleasures, which weakened his constitution, resulting in a premature death in October 534. Amalasuntha, trying to strengthen her position, appointed her cousin Theodahad as king. Theodahad however quickly deposed and imprisoned Amalasuntha, and executed her closest associates. Liberius, together with his fellow senator Venantius Opilio, was dispatched by Theodahad to Constantinople to inform Justinian, and carrying with them letters portraying a more mild version of events. However, upon reaching the port of Avlona, the two envoys met the emperor's own envoy, Peter, and told him what had really transpired. The news of Amalasuntha's captivity, followed by her subsequent murder, provided Justinian with a pretext for launching a campaign against the Goths in Italy, beginning the long and devastating Gothic War. Liberius was received with honour in Constantinople, and did not return to Italy.O'Donnell, \\"Liberius\\", pp. 62–64  In Imperial service   Prefect of Egypt  Despite his advanced age, Liberius, due to his impeccably orthodox credentials, was chosen as the new Augustal Prefect of Egypt ca. 538, with the prime task of suppressing the local Monophysites, together with an ecclesiastical commission under the future Pope Pelagius. According to the information provided by Procopius in his Anecdota, his tenure in Egypt was troubled, both because of his lack of acquaintance with the local realities and because of interference from the Imperial court, including a dispute with his successor, John. On his return to Constantinople, in 542, Liberius faced a senatorial inquiry, but managed to defend his actions with success.O'Donnell, \\"Liberius\\", pp. 64f  Role in the Gothic War  In Italy, the situation was deteriorating rapidly for the Empire. The Goths under Totila had recaptured most of the Italian peninsula and were threatening Sicily. In 550, after much vacillation on Justinian's behalf, Liberius was sent with an army to the island. He managed to enter the besieged city of Syracuse, but his military inexperience did not allow him to conduct any operations of significance against the Goths. Instead, he left the city with his army, and headed to Palermo, where in 551 he was replaced by the Armenian general Artabanes.O'Donnell, \\"Liberius\\", pp. 66f Final years During that time, a civil war had broken out in the Visigothic Kingdom of Hispania (the Iberian Peninsula, comprising modern Spain and Portugal), between the supporters of Athanagild and Agila I. Athanagild asked Justinian for help, and the emperor sent a small army of 2,000 men to Hispania, which helped Athanagild prevail, and in 554 he was crowned King of the Visigoths. The Romans kept most of their possessions, roughly equal to the old province of Baetica, now the province of Spania, and the Visigoths acknowledged the suzerainty of the Empire. Jordanes, writing in 551, mentions in passing that this force is led by Liberius.Getica, 303 A number of historians, including J. B. Bury, accept Jordanes' comment as accurate; however James O'Donnell notes that Liberius had returned to Constantinople after being replaced by Artabanes, and was there in May 553 when he took part in the Second Council of Constantinople, which would have left him no time for a campaign in Hispania. There he tried to persuade Pope Vigilius to attend the council and accept the Emperor's positions.; O'Donnell, \\"Liberius\\", pp. 67f For his long and distinguished service to the Empire, Liberius was one of the men Justinian rewarded in the Pragmatic Sanction of 13 August 554, granting him extensive estates in Italy; O'Donnell notes this is the last document we have about Liberius' life written during his lifetime.O'Donnell, \\"Liberius\\", pp. 69f Probably in the same year, Liberius died, and was buried in Ariminum. His children erected over his grave a funerary inscription which O'Donnell describes as \\"unexceptional, even trite: in complete accord with the most vacuous traditions of the genre.\\"O'Donnell, \\"Liberius\\", p. 70  References  Category:460s births Category:550s deaths Category:5th-century Italo-Roman people Category:5th-century Christians Category:6th-century Christians Category:People of the Ostrogothic Kingdom Category:Praetorian prefects of Gaul Category:Praetorian prefects of Italy Category:Justinian I Category:Patricii Category:6th-century Egyptian people Category:6th-century Italo-Roman people ","title":"Liberius (praetorian prefect)"},{"id":"11712298","text":"John Sturtevant (April 28, 1913 - May 10, 1974) was an American set decorator.

He was called Terreeoboo, King of Owhyhee by James Cook and other Europeans. His name has also been written as Kaleiopuu. Biography Kalaniʻōpuʻu was the son of Kalaninuiamamao (k) and his wife Kamākaʻimoku (w), a high ranking aliʻi wahine (female of hereditary nobility) who was also the mother of Keōua (k) with another husband named Kalanikeʻeaumoku (k). This made her the grandmother of Kamehameha I. During his reign, Alapainui had kept the two young princes, Kalaniʻōpuʻu and Keōua, close to him out of either kindness or politics. Kalaniōpuu-a-Kaiamamao was the king of the island during the times Captain James Cook came to Hawaiʻi and went aboard his ship on 26 November 1778. After Cook anchored at Kealakekua Bay in January 1779, Kalaniōpuu-a-Kaiamamao paid a ceremonial visit on 26 January 1779 and exchanged gifts including a ʻahuʻula (feathered cloak) and mahiole (ceremonial helmet), since it was during the Makahiki season. Cook's ships returned on 11 February to repair storm damage. This time relations were not as good, resulting in a violent struggle when Cook tried to take Kalaniʻōpuʻu hostage after the theft of a longboat, which led to Cook's death. Kalaniōpuu-a-Kaiamamao died at Kāʻilikiʻi, Waioʻahukini, Kaʻū, in April 1782. He was succeeded by his son, Kīwalaʻō, as king of Hawaii island; and his nephew, Kamehameha I, who was given guardianship of Kū-ka-ili-moku, the god of war. His nephew would eventually overthrow his son at the battle of Mokuōhai. The island of Hawaii was then effectively divided into three parts: his nephew Kamehameha ruled the western districts, his younger son Keōua Kuahuula controlled Kaū, and his brother Keawemauhili controlled Hilo.

Offshore is part of the upstream sector of the oil and gas industry. Offshore activities include searching for potential underground crude oil and natural gas reservoirs and accumulations, the drilling of exploratory wells, and subsequently drilling and operating the wells that recover and bring the crude oil and/or natural gas to the surface. Offshore exploration is performed with floating drilling units, drill ships, semi-submersible installations and jack-up installations. At the surface (either on the seabed or above water) offshore facilities are designed, constructed, commissioned and operated to process and treat the hydrocarbon oil and gas. Permanent oil and gas installations and plant include subsea wellheads and flowlines, offshore platforms and tethered floating installations. Other facilities include storage vessels, tanker ships, and pipelines to transport hydrocarbons onshore for further treatment and distribution. Further treatment and distribution comprise the midstream and downstream sectors of the industry. There are various types of installation used in the development of offshore oil and gas fields and subsea facilities, these include: fixed platforms, compliant towers, semi-submersible platforms, jack-up installations, floating production systems, tension-leg platforms, gravity-based structure and spar platforms. Production facilities on these installations include oil, gas and water separation systems; oil heating, cooling, pumping, metering and storage; gas cooling, treating and compression; and produced water clean-up. Other facilities may include reservoir gas injection and water injection; fuel gas systems; power generation; vents and flares; drains and sewage treatment; compressed air; helicopter fuel; heating, ventilation and air conditioning; and accommodation facilities for the crew. The final phase of offshore operations is the abandonment of wells, the decommissioning and removal of offshore facilities to onshore disposal, and the flushing, cleaning and abandonment of pipelines.

It currently exists as part of the Touch Bar interface in macOS.  History  The Control Strip was initially released in 1994 with the PowerBook 500 series of notebook computers and the PowerBook Duo 280 subnotebook computers, at that point shipping with System 7.1. Later on it was made available to desktop and portable Macintosh computers, beginning with System 7.5.3. Apple removed Control Strip in 2001 as a consequence of its move to Mac OS X. Apple initially attempted to integrate the Control Strip’s features into the Dock. After this was found to be too clumsy, most of its features were again duplicated in the menu extras of 10.1. An attempt was made at an open source reimplementation of the Control Strip for OS X, but it never received much developer traction and the last release is dated 27 October 2000. Apple revived the Control Strip as a component of its Touch Bar in October 2016. By default, the rightmost portion of the Touch Bar displays a subset of system controls previously available on the keyboard's function keys. When Control Strip is expanded the full set of system controls is displayed.  Features  Somewhat like the system trays of other operating systems, the Control Strip allowed easy access to status information about and control of simple tasks such as screen resolution, AppleTalk activity, battery status etc. Each task appears as a button-like popup menu called a module, these modules are managed in the Finder as individual module files, which have their own folder in the System Folder (\\"Control Strip Modules\\") and are executed alongside the Control Strip as it starts up or can be dragged directly onto the strip while it is running. The Control Strip always anchors itself to the closest vertical screen edge (left or right,) but can be freely moved up and down both sides of any display by the user. It defaults to the lower left corner of the primary display on fresh systems. Users can choose whether to turn the Control Strip on and off and even set a hot key to hide and reveal it using its control panel. Two buttons at either end allow the Strip to be collapsed and expanded (with the one opposite the screen edge also allowing the strip to be resized when dragged), while two more buttons just inside those allow one to scroll through a very full Strip. Holding down the option key while clicking turns the cursor into a distinctive hand shape that allows one to drag the Strip around the screen, rearrange modules within the Strip and drag modules out.  Extensibility  Control Strip modules were also available from many third parties. For example, Conflict Catcher included a Control Strip module to switch extension sets, while DAVE used one to toggle SMB/NetBIOS networking. Some novelty modules even consisted of calculators, calendars and games. Like the System Trays of other OSs, this was often abused to insert a flotsam module that merely launched and quit a given application.

No. 3015) (later designated AS-8) was a submarine tender in the United States Navy in World War I and the years after. She was launched 18 April 1899 as a German commercial freighter SS Saxonia, but was seized by the United States in 1917 and renamed Savannah. In 1933, the ship was renamed USS AS-8 to allow to have the Savannah name. Operational history World War I Saxonia was launched on 18 April 1899 for the Hamburg American Steamship Company, by the Flensburger Schiffbau-Gesellschaft, Flensburg, Germany. Seized, upon United States entry into World War I, at Seattle, Washington, where she had been interned since 1914, Saxonia was renamed Savannah on 9 June 1917; ordered converted to a submarine tender for the United States Navy on 20 October 1917; and commissioned on 3 November 1917 at the Puget Sound Navy Yard, Lt. Comdr. Arthur Jensen in command. Completing temporary outfitting as a tender, Savannah was assigned to Submarine Division 8 which had been ordered to the east coast of the United States. Departing Puget Sound on 21 November, Savannah and submarines, , , and called at several ports including San Pedro, California; Magdalena Bay and Acapulco, Mexico; before arriving at Balboa, Canal Zone, on 31 December 1917. Transiting the Panama Canal, Savannah proceeded to Kingston, Jamaica; Key West, Florida; Norfolk, Virginia; and New London, Connecticut; eventually reaching the Boston Navy Yard for an extensive overhaul and conversion on 13 February 1918. Standing out of Boston harbor on 1 August 1918, Savannah made for Newport, Rhode Island, to rejoin the 8th Division, Submarine Force, then consisting of , , , , , , , and . After cruising along the New York and New Jersey coasts, Savannah made a cruise to Ponta Delgada, Azores, in support of a submarine division bound for European waters. Arriving in the Azores on 16 November 1918, after the Armistice, Savannah was recalled. She returned to Charleston, South Carolina, on 13 December for repairs. Post World War I years Remaining with Submarine Division 8, Savannah operated along the east coast of the United States and in the Caribbean through July 1924. Her operations included support of frequent torpedo practice exercises, fleet maneuvers, and normal upkeep and maintenance of her flotilla. On 17 July 1920, Savannah was designated AS-8. In February 1923, she transited the Panama Canal during a fleet exercise, towing , , , and at various times. Returning to the Caribbean, Savannah was employed in towing from Guantanamo Bay to the Norfolk Navy Yard, arriving on 21 April 1923. Other duties included assistance to , stranded at the entrance to Chiriquí Lagoon, Panama, in April 1924. Reassigned to Submarine Division 11 in July, Savannah continued to operate in the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico into 1925. Then ordered to the Pacific Fleet, Savannah departed the Canal Zone on 23 February 1925 for San Diego, arriving on 12 March. After two cruises to San Francisco, Savannah deployed to Kaunakakai, Molokai, Territory of Hawaii, for Fleet Problem III. Remaining in Hawaiian waters, she entered Pearl Harbor on 28 April for an abbreviated overhaul, after which she joined the Battle Force for exercises in Lahaina Roads. Subsequently ordered to return to the west coast of the United States, Savannah arrived at Portland, Oregon, on 12 June 1925; and participated in the Rose Festival through 21 June. Overhaul at the Mare Island Navy Yard followed; and, in mid-September, Savannah took part in the California Diamond Jubilee celebrations at San Francisco. Assigned to duty as flagship, Commander, Submarine Divisions, Battle Force, Savannah operated along the Pacific coast from Washington to Panama into September 1926. Savannah's last duty was carrying passengers from San Pedro to Bremerton, where she arrived on 15 October. She was decommissioned on 16 December 1926 and was placed in reserve at the Puget Sound Navy Yard. The large number of new vessels planned for the United States Fleet in the 1930s led to the selection of the name Savannah for a light cruiser, CL-42. Accordingly, Savannah (AS-8)'s name was dropped on 15 September 1933, the ship becoming just AS-8. Subsequently declared surplus to naval requirements, AS-8 was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 26 June 1934 and sold on 26 September 1934 to Mider & Marcus of Seattle, for mercantile service. World War II and beyond In 1942, the ship was renamed Orbis and sailed as a merchant vessel in Atlantic convoys. On 24 October 1942, Orbis was traveling with the Iceland-bound portion of Convoy SC-105, when her steering gear broke. While she underwent repairs, U.S. Coast Guard cutter Duane stood by until she got underway four hours later. On 28 November 1942, Orbis joined Convoy ON-148 in Iceland to journey to Halifax. The ship was broken up for scrap in Japan during 1954.

Background Owned and bred by John W. Galbreath, Proud Clarion was foaled at his Darby Dan Farm in Lexington, Kentucky. His sire was Hail To Reason, the U.S. Champion Two-Year-Old Colt for 1960, and his grandsire was Royal Charger, a son of the great Nearco. Out of the mare Breath O'Morn, Proud Clarion's damsire was Djeddah, a major stakes winner in England who in turn was a son of the French champion and 1942 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner, Djebel. Racing career Racing at age two for trainer Loyd Gentry, Jr., Proud Clarion showed little of what his pedigree promised. Out of three starts, his best result was a third in a minor race. He finished his two-year-old season with earnings of just $805. As a three-year-old, he won a few sprint races then in the immediate lead-up to the 1967 Kentucky Derby, he ran second to Diplomat Way in the Blue Grass Stakes. Ridden by Bobby Ussery in the Derby, Proud Clarion was given little consideration and was sent off by bettors at more than 30:1 odds. The fourteen-horse field included Diplomat Way, Ruken, who had won California's Santa Anita Derby and was the bettors second choice, plus the overwhelming favorite, Wood Memorial Stakes winner Damascus. Leaving the starting gate from post position seven, Proud Clarion raced ninth near the back in a pack of horses until close to the ¾ mile pole when jockey Bobby Ussery made a move. By the mile pole he was sitting fifth then in the homestretch accelerated through an opening between Damascus and Diplomat Way. He caught front-runner Barbs Delight then raced on to win by a length in the third-fastest time in the Derby's history to that point. Proud Clarion finished third in the Preakness Stakes and then fourth in the Belmont to winner Damascus. He won six of his thirteen starts in 1967, with his only other significant stakes win coming in the Roamer Handicap at Aqueduct Racetrack in which he set a new track record of 1:55 flat for a mile and three-sixteenths. He returned to race at age four in 1968, starting nine times out of which his best was two second-place finishes.

The organisation aims to achieve these objectives by designing, implementing and managing projects in conjunction with local people according to their needs and within the culture of the country of operation. Projects are managed and staffed by local people. Background For over 30 years, the International Childcare Trust provided funding and advice to children's projects in both Asia and Africa. For the first twelve years, ICT worked through branch offices. David Lamont, the founder of The International Childcare Trust, was a true egalitarian and in those early days ICT worked on a cooperative basis; everyone involved had equality of input. The organisation, based in a tiny bedroom in Dave's flat in Covent Garden raised funds to support projects in Sri Lanka, the United Kingdom, India, Zambia and Kenya. David believed that people who were actively involved both in fundraising and fieldwork and who had strong links with local communities would have the best insight into needs and the drive to make things work. Those early partners; Pat Patebandagai in Sri Lanka, Phillip Wedell in Zambia and N. Sethu, Steve and Christine King in Tamil Nadu, lived on local wages and David was totally unpaid, between them they made the future ICT a possibility. In 1994, ICT's Board took the decision to recruit a Chief Executive. Margaret E O'Grady was recruited and, over the next decade, 'Maggie' built a London team and took the organisation to the next level, working tirelessly with her team to empower local partners to have ownership of their own work. ICT took on new partners in Cambodia, Nepal, Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda. In 2013, 'Maggie' announced her intention to step down as Chief Executive. As part of succession planning, ICT began to have conversations with ChildlHope, a like-minded organisation with offices in the same building. ICT initially took on another Chief Executive, however, after a short time the Board decided that the existing work, which was identical in approach to the work of ChildHope, should be passed on to that organisation and, in 2015, ICT ceased operations. The charity supported programmes that gave some of the world's most vulnerable children the essentials they need to live their lives. It concentrates on providing the following: * shelter * primary health care * education Operations ICT has identified several hundred children in need of immediate assistance in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Nepal, Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka, India and Cambodia. The charity has numerous projects in these countries, covering primary healthcare, educational and vocational programmes, rehabilitation centres for children displaced by conflict or disease such as HIV/AIDS, mobile support services for street children, income generation schemes for families and communities, and many other aspects of support.

Named Argonne for the U.S. Army's Meuse-Argonne campaign in World War I, she was completed in 1920, delivered to the War Department in December 1920, laid up in February 1921, and loaned to the Navy on 3 November 1921. Accepted preliminarily by the Navy on that date, she was commissioned as Argonne on 8 November 1921 at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, Lt. Comdr. Theodore H. Winters in command. The ship was permanently transferred to the Navy 6 August 1924 by Executive Order. Operational history Argonne was delivered to the War Department assigned to the U.S. Army Transport Service in the early part of 1921 and quickly laid up at Philadelphia in February. The ship was loaned to the Navy 3 November 1921, commissioned 8 November as USS Argonne. On 16 November 1921, the ship was classified as a transport, AP-4. Departing Philadelphia on 24 November 1921 with military and civilian passengers, as well as a senatorial party, Argonne's maiden voyage and shakedown took the ship to Port-au-Prince, Haiti; St. Thomas, Virgin Islands; Ponce, Puerto Rico; and Santo Domingo City, Dominican Republic; before she put into Hampton Roads on 22 December. Subsequently returning to Philadelphia for post-shakedown availability, Argonne proceeded to the Panama Canal via Charleston, South Carolina, and after a stop at Mare Island continued across the Pacific to Cavite, in the Philippines, on her first voyage to that part of the globe. 1922–1929 On 7 April 1922, Commander (later Fleet Admiral) Chester W. Nimitz, along with his wife and three children, embarked on board Argonne at Pearl Harbor for passage to the east coast of the United States. Nimitz was on his way to Newport, R.I., to study at the Naval War College. The ship proceeded via Mare Island, where she underwent an overhaul period. Following that was a transit through the Panama Canal, Santo Domingo and Hampton Roads, bringing her voyage to a close on 21 June 1922. Over the next two years, Argonne operated with the Naval Transportation Service on the through service between New York and Manila. Along with the transport , Argonne provided this important service to the fleet. During this time, she ranged from San Francisco to Guam and into the Yellow Sea, voyaging as far as Chefoo, China. Selected for conversion to a submarine tender and classified as AS-10 on 1 July 1924, Argonne was permanently transferred to Navy ownership under terms of the executive order dated 6 August 1924, and arrived at the Mare Island Navy Yard on 2 September 1924. From September 1924 to March 1926, Argonne lay at Mare Island in reduced commission, undergoing her transformation from transport to tender. Major alternations to the ship included the installation of a turbo-generator plant, a compressed-air plant, a machine shop and a low-pressure distilling plant. Argonne (AS-10) with , , and , off Panama, late 1920s Placed in full commission on 25 March 1926, Argonne was assigned to the newly formed Submarine Division (SubDiv) 20, which consisted, at that time, of the \\"V-boats\\": V-1 (SS-163); V-2 (SS-164); and V-3 (SS-165). She sailed on 19 May to take up her duties. From 19 May to 5 June, Argonne operated from the west coast ports of San Francisco, San Pedro and San Diego, before she sailed to transit the Panama Canal for operations in the Atlantic. Owing to disorders in Nicaragua, and fears that excesses of violence from the feuding factions might endanger American lives and property, expeditionary forces of marines were sent to reinforce the sailors and marines already landed from ships of the Special Service Squadron. Argonne participated in one of the early lifts, transporting the second Battalion, 5th Regiment — which had been encamped at Guantanamo Bay undergoing six months of training—from Guantanamo to Bluefields, Nicaragua, between 7 and 10 January 1927. Maintaining the necessary neutral zones on the east coast for eight days, the battalion left one company at Rama before proceeding on, in Argonne, through the Panama Canal to the port of Corinto, on the west coast of Nicaragua. There, she disembarked the rest of the battalion on 24 January to maintain the neutral zones between that port and the capital city of Managua, before returning thence into the Caribbean to resume tending operations with SubDiv 20. During March Argonne provided tender services to ships engaged in Fleet Problem VII, in a large- scale exercise that pitted the combined Battle Fleet, Base Force and fleet submarines against the combined Scouting Fleet, Control Force and Train Squadron 1. She rejoined the Special Service Squadron at the end of that month, however, to resume her transportation duties to Nicaraguan ports. On 1 July 1927, Argonne became part of the Control Force, with which she carried out her previous duties with the Special Service Squadron, until being transferred with SubDiv 20 to the Battle Fleet, on 19 November. She operated with the fleet on the Pacific Coast, principally at San Diego, San Pedro, or Mare Island, until she sailed for Hawaiian waters on 18 April 1928, to take part in Fleet Problem VIII, an exercise that pitted light cruisers and a detachment of ships from Pearl Harbor (\\"Orange\\") against the Battle Fleet and the Train (\\"Blue\\"). Reaching Pearl Harbor on the 28th, she then based at Lahaina, and carried out tactical exercises with the fleet, ultimately returning to Mare Island for her annual overhaul on 29 June. S class subs and one V boat in San Diego in late 1928 Resuming her active service with the Battle Fleet in the San Diego-San Pedro area from 18 August 1928, she operated there until 15 January 1929 when she sailed for Balboa, to take part in Fleet Problem IX, with all available units of the Battle Fleet and Train Squadron Two — these in the main opposed by the Scouting Fleet and the Control Force and the defense forces of the 15th Naval District and Army units. Arriving at Balboa on 29 January, the assembled fleet conducted its concentration based on Panama Bay before setting course back to San Diego on 11 March, and ultimately arriving back in their usual operating areas on the 22d. Over the next eleven months, Argonne provided support services at San Diego with SubDivs 11 and 20, as the ships conducted speed and endurance tests, as well as torpedo and sound exercises. During this period, on 15 June 1929, Capt. Chester W. Nimitz, who had been a passenger on board the ship seven years before, became her commanding officer. His concurrent billet was that of Commander, SubDiv 20, his broad pennant in Argonne. 1930–1939 After overhaul at Mare Island, Argonne tended SubDivs 11 and 20 at San Diego from 11 December 1929 to 15 February 1930 before sailing for Panama on the latter date in company with Destroyer Squadrons, Battle Fleet, for the annual fleet concentration and the year's culmination of training, Fleet Problem X and XI. Each force was augmented to match them more evenly, pitting the Scouting Fleet against the Battle Fleet. Following the exercises in the Caribbean, Argonne accompanied the fleet as it moved up to New York, arriving there on 7 May 1930. She operated with the fleet at New York, Newport, and Hampton Roads until 26 May, when she then set course for Panama and back to San Diego, arriving at the latter port on 19 June. She continued her tender operations from there until 1 December. During that time, she was transferred to the Control Force, Battle Fleet, on 6 November, on which date she was also transferred from SubDiv 20. Capt. Nimitz shifted his command pennant to on 5 November, that ship becoming flagship for SubDiv 20. Argonne accompanied SubDivs 11 and 19 from San Diego on 1 December 1930, and engaged in maneuvers en route to Pearl Harbor, before she returned immediately to San Diego two days before Christmas with SubDivs 9 and 14. On 6 January 1931, Argonne became flagship for Commander, Fleet Base Force, and steamed from San Pedro that day, to take part in Fleet Problem XII — an evolution opposing the Battle Fleet to the Scouting Fleet, the latter augmented by the rigid airship . Returning to San Pedro on 4 April, she then conducted operations off the west coast, fleet and tactical maneuvers, until she departed San Pedro with the Battle Force on 23 January 1932 for Hawaiian waters. At Pearl Harbor and Lahaina Roads, Argonne took part in exercises and provided tender support for the fleet as it carried out Fleet Problem XIII between the west coast of the United States and the Hawaiian Island; with the Battle Force once more set against the Scouting Force. Returning to San Pedro on 21 March 1932, she spent the next eleven months providing tender support services and operated with the fleet at San Pedro, San Francisco, and San Pablo, until 8 March 1933. Argonne sailed from San Pedro on that date, one day after Comdr. Harry A. Badt relieved Comdr. C. R. Hyatt as Argonne's commanding officer and as commanding officer of the Aleutian Islands Surveying Expedition. Reaching the Puget Sound Navy Yard on 13 March, Argonne was drydocked, received stores and equipment, fuel oil and gasoline, and ultimately sailed for Dutch Harbor on 6 April. Proceeding thence to Bay of Islands, Adak, the ship surveyed those waters between 10 and 28 April before she proceeded back to Dutch Harbor with in tow. Argonne remained at Dutch Harbor from 1 to 18 May, contacting at that port for fuel oil and provisions, but also awaiting better weather in which to conduct her surveys. Finally departing Dutch Harbor on 18 May, the ship returned to the survey area — the waters off Adak, in the western Aleutians — on the 20th, remaining in the area for eight days before returning to Dutch Harbor for fuel oil and gasoline. She completed her survey work off Adak from 3 to 16 August before she sailed for Mare Island, and an overhaul, on 25 August. Argonne, during her time in northern waters, also assisted the Bering Sea Aerological Expedition, with weather surveys and analyses necessary for radio stations of Washington and Alaska. Remaining as flagship for the Base Force, Argonne provided tender services at San Pedro from 4 October 1933 to 9 April 1934; she then sailed south with the fleet, and supported its operations in Fleet Problem XV, the big war games which again pitted Battle Force against an augmented Scouting Force. In the course of her operations, the ship operated at Balboa, Colon, Culebra, Ponce, Gonaïves and Guantánamo Bay. She then steamed north with the fleet as it called at New York City, arriving on 2 June to be reviewed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. She subsequently provided tender services out of New London and Newport before she proceeded to Port-au-Prince to participate in the withdrawal of the 1st Marine Brigade from Haiti on 15 August 1934. \\"Impressive ceremonies on shore amidst most friendly feelings displayed by the populace\\" accompanied the departure of the marines, whose duties as peacekeepers had been taken over by the fully Haitianized Garde d'Haiti. Other ships involved in the lift included , , and USAT Chateau Thierry. Following leave and liberty at Hampton Roads and at New Orleans, Argonne joined the fleet, transited the Panama Canal,and ultimately arrived at San Pedro on 9 November 1934. As Base Force flagship, she provided tender and repair services for minesweepers, tugs, and harbor craft, while maintaining the only major photographic laboratory for photo-triangulation of fleet gunnery exercises. Over the next seven years she operated principally out of San Pedro, but followed the fleet to the waters of Hawaii or Panama to carry out her vital support duty. On 25 July 1940, her classification was changed from submarine tender to \\"auxiliary, miscellaneous\\", and she was given the hull number AG-31. Eventually, with the movement of the Fleet to Hawaiian waters over the winter of 1939 and spring of 1940, commencing with the establishment of the Hawaiian Detachment in October 1939 and the permanent retention of the fleet in Hawaiian waters upon the conclusion of Fleet Problem XXI in April 1940, the needs for auxiliaries such as Argonne resulted in a change of scene for that ship. In August 1941, she was shifted from San Pedro to Pearl Harbor. World War II Pearl Harbor On the morning of 7 December 1941, Argonne — flagship for Rear Admiral William L. Calhoun, Commander, Base Force, Pacific Fleet — was berthed in the first repair slip at the north end of 1010 dock, with the minesweeper Tern alongside, when aircraft from six Japanese carriers struck the Pacific Fleet as it lay at Pearl Harbor, and neutralized surrounding air and military installations. The ship manned her antiaircraft battery — 3-inch guns and .50-caliber machine guns — and commenced fire about 07:58, shortly after the raid began. Argonne's crew, wrote Comdr. F. W. O'Connor, the ship's commanding officer, \\"performed their duties in accordance with the best traditions of the service\\", helping to get wounded men from damaged ships, recovering bodies from the water, and \\"assisting with repair facilities to full capacity.\\" Early in the raid, Corporal Alfred Schlag, USMC, from the ship's marine detachment, manning a .50-caliber machine gun, claimed shooting down an enemy plane as it flew over 1010 dock and turned toward Ford Island. A member of Argonne's crew was attacked before his ship was; Motor Machinist's Mate 2d Class M. F. Poston was taking flying lessons. Returning from Haleiwa to the KT Flying Service field, flying a light training plane, Poston and Bob Tice, the latter the owner of the flying service (who was flying an accompanying plane) were both attacked by Japanese planes which shot them down. The one attacking Poston's light sport plane shot away the propeller and engine, forcing the Argonne sailor to take to his parachute. That evening, six fighters from the carrier , sent to land at the Naval Air Station at Pearl Harbor after accompanying a strike group looking for the carriers from which the Japanese raid had been launched, arrived over Pearl. Tragically, before the planes' friendly character could be established, understandably jittery gunners shot down four of the six planes; three pilots were killed. One .50-caliber bullet fired from the direction of Ford Island penetrated Argonne's port side, killing Seaman Second Class Pallas F. Brown and wounding Seaman 1st Class Leonard A. Price. Both men had survived the loss of their ship, , earlier that morning. Argonne remained at Pearl Harbor into the spring, serving as flagship for the Base Force until Rear Admiral Calhoun moved his flag ashore, to a headquarters at the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard. That spring, the troopship President Taylor, while on a voyage to Canton Island, ran aground there. After loading salvage equipment, light trucks, medical supplies and ammunition, Argonne stood out of Pearl Harbor on 6 April 1942 for Canton, escorted by the fast minelayer , and arrived at her destination on 12 April. She soon sent a salvage party and equipment to attempt salvage of the grounded troopship. Accompanied by Breese and the fleet tug , Argonne cleared Canton on 5 May for Pearl Harbor, and arrived on the 11th. She remained there until 10 July, when, with general cargo on board, she sailed on her second voyage to Canton Island, accompanied this time by and , and arrived at her destination on the 16th, unloading cargo the same day. Sailing on the 17th, Argonne put into Suva Harbor, Fiji Islands, on the 21st, to unload cargo, and then, two days later, set course for Nouméa, New Caledonia, in company with Hovey, arriving on 27 July 1942. Flagship On the morning of 1 August 1942, Vice Admiral Robert Lee Ghormley broke his flag on board Argonne, having shifted his headquarters from Auckland, New Zealand, as Commander, South Pacific Force and South Pacific Area. Operation Watchtower, the invasion of Guadalcanal, began six days later, on 7 August. The direction of the course of the operation, however,appeared to require an infusion of new blood and a more aggressive commander. This soon came, in the form of Vice Admiral William F. Halsey, Jr., who arrived at Nouméa on 18 October 1942 and was informed, upon arrival, that he was to relieve Vice Admiral Ghormley. Halsey assumed command on board Argonne the same day. Two days later, too early in this billet to journey to Guadalcanal to get a personal look at the situation there, Halsey convened a conference on board Argonne at Nouméa; among those present were Rear Admiral Richmond K. Turner, commanding the Amphibious Forces, Pacific, and Major General Alexander A. Vandegrift, Commanding the 1st Marine Division on Guadalcanal. Also present were Lieutenant General Thomas Holcomb, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, who by happenstance was in Nouméa on an inspection tour of the area, and Army Major Generals Alexander M. Patch and Millard F. Harmon. After a lengthy discussion of the situation on Guadalcanal, Halsey asked those present if the Americans should evacuate or hold; when told by Vandegrift that he would hold — if he got more support — Halsey told the 1st Marine Division's commander, \\"All right. Go on back. I'll promise you everything I've got.\\" Guadalcanal would be held. Halsey exercised command of the theater from Argonne until he shifted his flag ashore, the ship proving \\"hopelessly inadequate\\" for the increase in the number of people required on the staff. Argonne was not only overcrowded, but possessed no air conditioning system. New Zealand and Solomons Argonne remained at Nouméa until 16 June 1943, when she sailed for Auckland, arriving at that port on 21 June. She proceeded thence on 27 July for Espiritu Santo, in the New Hebrides, and arrived there, accompanied by HMNZS Inchkeith, on 11 August. After embarking men from Carrier Aircraft Service. Unit (CASU) 14, Argonne sailed for the Solomons the same day (11 August), reaching Purvis Bay, off Florida Island, on the 13th. While moored at Purvis Bay, the ship conducted repairs to the destroyer , which had been damaged in an engagement with Japanese destroyers off Vella LaVella on the night of 6 October. Sailing from Purvis Bay on 1 November 1943 in company with and escorted by the Royal New Zealand Navy corvette HMNZS Kiwi, Argonne arrived at Tillotson Cove, Russell Islands, the same day. The ship remained in the Russells, carrying out repair and salvage work, until 27 April 1944, when she stood put for Majuro Atoll in the Marshall Islands. Admiralty Islands Assigned to Service Squadron (ServRon) 10, Argonne provided vital service to the fleet at Majuro until 21 August, when she sailed for Manus, in the Admiralty Islands, a base for the operation to secure the Western Carolines. On board Argonne was Capt. S. B. Ogden, designated as Representative \\"A\\" of Commander, ServRon 10, who established his mobile base at Seeadler Harbor upon arrival at Manus on 27 August. From on board Argonne, Capt. Ogden administered the activities of the ServRon 10 detachment as it rendered key logistics support. At 0850, local time, on 10 November 1944, Argonne lay moored to a buoy in berth 14, Seeadler Harbor, when the ammunition ship blew up, 1,100 yards away. \\"At the time of the explosion\\", wrote Argonne's captain, Comdr. T. H. Escott, \\"I was standing outside my cabin ... in conversation with the executive officer. By the time we had recovered our stance from the force of the explosion, and faced outboard, the area in the vicinity of berth 380 (where Mount Hood had lain moored) was completely shrouded in a pall of dense black smoke. It was not possible to see anything worth reporting. A second or so thereafter, fragments of steel and shrapnel began falling on and around this ship.\\" Some 221 pieces of debris, ranging in size from one to 150 pounds, were recovered on board, totaling 1,300 pounds. Several other pieces caromed off Argonne's port side into the water alongside, and others landed on YF-681 and YO-77, the latter alongside delivering fuel oil at the time. The repair ship Mindanao (ARG-3), suffered heavily, moored in a berth between the disintegrating ammunition ship and Argonne. Riddled with shrapnel, Mindanao suffered 23 killed and 174 wounded in the explosion. Argonne suffered casualties, too, as well as the destruction of a searchlight, five transmitting antennas broken away, and steam, fresh-water and salt-water lines ruptured, as well as extensive damage from concussion. Kossol Passage After repairs and a resumption of work at Manus, Argonne sailed for Kossol Passage, in the Palaus, arriving there on 15 December 1944. While anchored in berth 74, Kossol Roads, the ship again suffered damage at the hands of friendly ships. lay alongside to the port side, aft; and to the port side, forward. An LCVP, attempting to tie up alongside the subchaser, accidentally fouled its ramp in the depth charge rack of SC-702, wrenching loose a 300-pound depth charge. The explosion of the sinking charge lifted Argonne bodily \\"several inches\\", and jarred two additional charges loose from SC-702's track—which, fortunately, did not explode. Damage to Argonne was confined mostly to the forward portion of the ship, in the print shop, radio- repair shop, and galleys and pantries, as loose gear came crashing to the deck. After again repairing her own damage, the ship resumed her important service to the fleet, and remained in the Palaus until she sailed for the Philippines on 11 February 1945 to take up support operations for the Okinawa campaign, basing on Leyte. Arriving at her new base of operations on 15 February, Argonne operated out of Leyte into June. She weighed anchor on the 14th of that month and sailed for the Marshalls on that date. Argonne remained in the western Pacific through the end of hostilities with Japan in August 1945, and briefly served with the occupation forces in Japanese waters before returning to the United States. Postwar With returning servicemen in San Francisco Bay, late 1945/early 1946 Ultimately returning to the United States after a brief stint with the Naval Transportation Service on Magic Carpet service after the war, Argonne was decommissioned at Mare Island Naval Shipyard on 15 July 1946. Deemed not essential to the United States, she was transferred to the United States Maritime Commission on 31 July 1946. Argonne was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 28 August 1946. Ultimately, the ship was sold to the Boston Metals Corp. on 14 August 1950, and was broken up for scrap. Honors and awards Argonne (AG-31) was awarded one battle star for her World War II service, at Pearl Harbor.

It is also then abbreviated as gDNA. Most organisms have the same genomic DNA in every cell; however, only certain genes are active in each cell to allow for cell function and differentiation within the body. The genome of an organism (encoded by the genomic DNA) is the (biological) information of heredity which is passed from one generation of organism to the next. That genome is transcribed to produce various RNAs, which are necessary for the function of the organism. Precursor mRNA (pre- mRNA) is transcribed by RNA polymerase II in the nucleus. pre-mRNA is then processed by splicing to remove introns, leaving the exons in the mature messenger RNA (mRNA). Additional processing includes the addition of a 5' cap and a poly(A) tail to the pre-mRNA. The mature mRNA may then be transported to the cytosol and translated by the ribosome into a protein. Other types of RNA include ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and transfer RNA (tRNA). These types are transcribed by RNA polymerase II and RNA polymerase III, respectively, and are essential for protein synthesis. However 5s rRNA is the only rRNA which is transcribed by RNA Polymerase III.  References  Category:DNA ","title":"Genomic DNA"},{"id":"11712728","text":"Alejandro Bustillo. Alejandro Bustillo (18 March 1889 - 3 November 1982) was an Argentine painter and architect who left his mark in various tourist destinations in Argentina, especially in the Andean region of the Patagonia. Biography Born in Buenos Aires, son of María Luisa Madero and Dr. José María Bustillo, he completed his secondary school studies at Otto Krause Technical School. He later entered the School of Architecture at the University of Buenos Aires, where he also excelled as a painter, earning a first prize at the 1912 National Salon of Painters for a self-portrait. He graduated with a degree in Architecture in 1914. He obtained his first professional experience working on the design of estancias, the first of which was for Santiago Rocca in 1916. He married Blanca Ayerza in 1917, and the couple had eight children. Bustillo designed a country house for his own family, Estancia La Primavera, in 1918. Two years later he returned to Buenos Aires. After a visit to Paris, Bustillo undertook two major projects for Carlos Tornquist in Buenos Aires, by designing the family’s house (now the Belgium Embassy) in 1923, and the Tornquist Bank (today the Buenos Aires branch of Credit Lyonnais) in 1928. From 1924 until 1937 he consolidated his career with a large number of works including commercial buildings, private houses and rental property. The Martínez de Hoz Building (1929) served as the Gran Hotel Argentino before its conversion into the Intelligence Secretariat. He undertook the remodel in 1931 of the interior of the Palais de Glace and in 1932 began the conversion of an old pumping station in Libertador Avenue, Buenos Aires, into the new headquarters for the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes. He was contracted by the governor of Misiones Province in 1935 on the design of the governor’s residence, San Martín Square, the municipal park, the police station and the surroundings of the Jesuit ruins of San Ignacio. In 1938 he began some of his most important works by winning the competition for the design of the Llao Llao Hotel in San Carlos de Bariloche, an important tourist centre. The building, made almost entirely of wood, was destroyed by fire soon after its completion in 1939 and a year later Bustillo built a new hotel out of reinforced concrete and stone. He designed the headquarters of the National Bank in Buenos Aires in both its phases, the first completed in 1944 and the second in 1955. Bustillo also designed numerous landmark works in Mar del Plata during the 1940s, including the Grand Provincial Hotel, the Casino, the seaside esplanade joining each, and City Hall. Among Bustillo's best known later works was the National Flag Memorial in Rosario, designed in 1944 with fellow architect Ángel Guido and completed in 1957. His last works began in 1977 and he died in Buenos Aires in 1982 at the age of 93, having completed over 250 projects. Selected works References *Alberto Bellucci, The Bariloche Style, J.

It was released in 1969. By early 1969, the original line-up of Pearls Before Swine - which had only ever performed in the studio, never live - was disintegrating around its leader and mainstay, singer and songwriter Tom Rapp. Original members Lane Lederer and Roger Crissinger had left, and Rapp had married Dutch traveller Elisabeth Joosten, whom he had met in New York when recording the album Balaklava.Sleeve notes to Jewels Were The Stars. Original member Wayne Harley remained in the group, but left shortly after These Things Too was recorded. The group had now left ESP-Disk and joined Reprise, a major label, and Rapp and producer Richard Alderson recruited studio musicians to play on the album. Chief among these was Jim Fairs, formerly of garage band The Cryan' Shames, who acted as co- producer and arranger as well as musician. Other musicians included violinist Richard Greene, later of Seatrain, and jazz drummer Grady Tate. These Things Too has been described as Rapp's \\"dreamy\\" album,These Things Too and it is generally less well regarded by critics than the albums which immediately preceded and followed it, Balaklava (1968) and The Use of Ashes (1970). Rapp stated that it was the first Pearls Before Swine album which reflected drug use in the writing of the songs. The album sleeve showed a 15th-century painting of Christ by Giovanni Bellini. The picture was removed from the version of the album issued in Germany because it showed Christ's nipple exposed. The album was reissued on CD in 2003, originally as part of a box set, Jewels Were The Stars, which comprised the group's four completed Reprise albums. It was again reissued, with The Use of Ashes, as a two-on-one CD by Floating World Records in 2011. Record Collector review of The Use of Ashes / These Things Too.

He was convicted of the rape and kidnapping of a young Hungarian man (Balázs Falvay) whom he picked up hitch-hiking in 1988. He received a 10-year sentence for the attack, and was released in 1995 on probation. He was accused of murdering three of eight young men who disappeared in northeastern France between 1980 and 1987. One of his alleged victims was Irishman Trevor O'Keeffe. Chanal committed suicide in prison in 2003 while on trial. Biography Pierre Chanal was chief warrant officer and instructor at camp de Mourmelon in the 4th dragoon regiment in Marne, from 1977 to 1986, the time of the Mourmelon disappearances. He had an impeccable service record. He jogged daily, was trained in hand-to-hand combat and was a skydiving enthusiast. He earned a United Nations medal for his service as a UN peacekeeper in Lebanon. He was deployed from 18 January 1985 to 15 May 1985. His behavior was described as exemplary by his superiors. Beginning of the case Pierre Chanal On August 9, 1988, police from Saône-et-Loire spotted a Volkswagen Type 2 microbus parked on a dead end road leading to a TGV line that was under construction in the town of Bussières. The police approached the vehicle, thinking that it might belong to environmentalists opposed to the TGV project. Pierre Chanal was inside the vehicle and, when questioned by one of the policemen, explained that he was an \\"NCO taking advantage of some leave time to do some tourism.\\" The police requested identification, at which time they realized that he was assigned to the 4th Dragoon Regiment in Mourmelon from 1977 to 1986, drawing the connection to the Mourmelon disappearances. The other policeman spotted the head of a man wrapped in a blanket through the rear window of the vehicle. The man, freed from his restraints, was a 20-year old Hungarian named Palázs Falvay. He explained that he'd been hitchhiking the night before in Chalon-sur-Saône and Chanal had picked him up. He accused Chanal of having kidnapped and raped him. During the processing of the vehicle, the police found sex toys and a camera with images that included the scenes described by the hitchhiker. On 23 October 1990, the Saône-et-Loire Assize Court condemned Pierre Chanal to 10 years in prison. He was taken to the prison in Dijon, where he requested to be placed in solitary confinement. Both during and after the trial, Chanal did not speak at all. He was released from prison on June 16, 1995. Despite his release, the police continued to suspect him of the Mourmelon disappearances due to his psychological profile as well as his being stationed at Camp de Mourmelon during the time in question. Since January 1980, no fewer than eight people disappeared from a triangular area of the Mourmelon region. Since 1980, the story had made headlines, embarrassing the judiciary, military and investigators. It was long denied by the military authorities, who claimed the disappearances were desertions. Several military conscripts vanished after hitchhiking while on leave. By 1990, at least seven had disappeared, five soldiers between 1980 and 1982, a civilian traveling to Mourmelon camp in 1985, and a soldier assigned to the 4th Dragoon Regiment in 1987. Adding to these disappearances were two bodies found near the camp: that of Olivier Donner, a 4th Dragoon Regiment of Mourmelon soldier who disappeared in 1982, who was recovered 31 October of the same year in a grove near Mailly-le-Camp, as well as the body of an Irish tourist, Trevor O'Keefe, found 8 August 1987 near Alaincourt in Aisne, the body half buried in a grove. Death Chanal was found dead 15 October 2003, putting an end to his trial. He had severed his femoral artery with a razor.

From 1974 to 1978, during the post-Watergate era, he worked with pioneering muckraking investigative journalist Jack Anderson. Grady is the author of the 1974 espionage thriller novel Six Days of the Condor, which was famously adapted to film as Three Days of the Condor (1975), starring Robert Redford and directed by Sydney Pollack. In addition to about a dozen novels and many short stories, Grady has written for film and television. Grady has contributed to Slate, The Washington Post, Washingtonian, American Film, The New Republic, Sport, Parade, and the Journal of Asian Martial Arts. Grady is a member of the Writers Guild of America, East. Personal life Grady married Bonnie Goldstein in 1985. He is the stepfather of Rachel Grady, director of the documentary Jesus Camp.

Each entry is a set of transcripts that appear to stem from the same transcription locus (i.e. gene or expressed pseudogene). Information on protein similarities, gene expression, cDNA clones, and genomic location is included with each entry. Descriptions of the UniGene transcript based and genome based build procedures are available. A detailed description of UniGene database The UniGene resource, developed at NCBI, clusters ESTs and other mRNA sequences, along with coding sequences (CDSs) annotated on genomic DNA, into subsets of related sequences. In most cases, each cluster is made up of sequences produced by a single gene, including alternatively spliced transcripts. However, some genes may be represented by more than one cluster. The clusters are organism specific and are currently available for human, mouse, rat, zebrafish, and cattle. They are built in several stages, using an automatic process based on special sequence comparison algorithms. First, the nucleotide sequences are searched for contaminants, such as mitochondrial, ribosomal, and vector sequence, repetitive elements, and low-complexity sequences. After a sequence is screened, it must contain at least 100 bases to be a candidate for entry into UniGene. mRNA and genomic DNA are clustered first into gene links. A second sequence comparison links ESTs to each other and to the gene links. At this stage, all clusters are ‘‘anchored,’’ and contain either a sequence with a polyadenylation site or two ESTs labeled as coming from the 3 end of a clone. Clone-based edges are added by linking the 5 and 3 ESTs that derive from the same clone. In some cases, this linking may merge clusters identified at a previous stage. Finally, unanchored ESTs and gene clusters of size 1 (which may represent rare transcripts) are compared with other UniGene clusters at lower stringency. The UniGene build is updated weekly, and the sequences that make up a cluster may change. Thus, it is not safe to refer to a UniGene cluster by its cluster identifier; instead, one should use the GenBank accession numbers of the sequences in the cluster. As of July 2000, the human subset of UniGene contained 1.7 million sequences in 82,000 clusters; 98% of these clustered sequences were ESTs, and the remaining 2% were from mRNAs or CDSs annotated on genomic DNA. These human clusters could represent fragments of up to 82,000 unique human genes, implying that many human genes are now represented in a UniGene cluster. (This number is undoubtedly an overestimate of the number of genes in the human genome, as some genes may be represented by more than one cluster.) Only 1.4% of clusters totally lack ESTs, implying that most human genes are represented by at least one EST. Conversely, it appears that the majority of human genes have been identified only by ESTs; only 16% of clusters contain either an mRNA or a CDS annotated on a genomic DNA. Because fewer ESTs are available for mouse, rat, and zebrafish, the UniGene clusters are not as representative of the unique genes in the genome. Mouse UniGene contains 895,000 sequences in 88,000 clusters, and rat UniGene contains 170,000 sequences in 37,000 clusters. A new UniGene resource, HomoloGene, includes curated and calculated orthologs and homologs for genes from human, mouse, rat, and zebrafish. Calculated orthologs and homologs are the result of nucleotide sequence comparisons between all UniGene clusters for each pair of organisms. Homologs are identified as the best match between a UniGene cluster in one organism and a cluster in a second organism. When two sequences in different organisms are best matches to one another (a reciprocal best match), the UniGene clusters corresponding to the pair of sequences are considered putative orthologs. A special symbol indicates that UniGene clusters in three or more organisms share a mutually consistent ortholog relationship. The calculated orthologs and homologs are considered putative, since they are based only on sequence comparisons. Curated orthologs are provided by the Mouse Genome Database (MGD) at the Jackson Laboratory and the Zebrafish Information Database (ZFIN) at the University of Oregon and can also be obtained from the scientific literature. Queries to UniGene are entered into a text box on any of the UniGene pages. Query terms can be, for example, the UniGene identifier, a gene name, a text term that is found somewhere in the UniGene record, or the accession number of an EST or gene sequence in the cluster. For example, the cluster entitled ‘‘A disintegrin and metalloprotease domain 10’’ that contains the sequence for human ADAM10 can be retrieved by entering ADAM10, disintegrin, AF009615 (the GenBank accession number of ADAM10), or H69859 (the GenBank accession number of an EST in the cluster). To query a specific part of the UniGene record, use the @ symbol. For example, @gene(symbol) looks for genes with the name of the symbol enclosed in the parentheses, @chr(num) searches for entries that map to chromosome num, @lib(id) returns entries in a cDNA library identified by id, and @pid(id) se- lects entries associated with a GenBank protein identifier id. The query results page contains a list of all UniGene clusters that match the query. Each cluster is identified by an identifier, a description, and a gene symbol, if available. Cluster identifiers are prefixed with Hs for Homo sapiens, Rn for Rattus norvegicus, Mm for Mus musculus, or Dn for Danio rerio. The descriptions of UniGene clusters are taken from LocusLink, if available, or from the title of a sequence in the cluster. The UniGene report page for each cluster links to data from other NCBI resources (Fig. 12.5). At the top of the page are links to LocusLink, which provides descriptive information about genetic loci (Pruitt et al., 2000), OMIM, a catalog of human genes and genetic disorders, and HomoloGene. Next are listed similarities between the translations of DNA sequences in the cluster and protein sequences from model organisms, including human, mouse, rat, fruit fly, and worm. The subsequent section describes relevant mapping information. It is followed by ‘‘expression information,’’ which lists the tissues from which the ESTs in the cluster have been created, along with links to the SAGE database. Sequences making up the cluster are listed next, along with a link to download these sequences. It is important to note that clusters that contain ESTs only (i.e., no mRNAs or annotated CDSs) will be missing some of these fields, such as LocusLink, OMIM, and mRNA/Gene links. UniGene titles for such clusters, such as ‘‘EST, weakly similar to ORF2 contains a reverse transcriptase domain [H. sapiens],’’ are derived from the title of a characterized protein with which the translated EST sequence aligns. The cluster title might be as simple as ‘‘EST’’ if the ESTs share no significant similarity with characterized proteins.Andreas D. Baxevanis and B. F.

PhD thesis, University of Portsmouth, p. 265 He is normally credited with being the first superintendent of a small asylum (approximately 100 patients) to develop a mode of treatment in which reliance on mechanical medical restraint and coercion could be dropped altogether. In practice he reached this situation in 1838. The debate concerning the merits of his methods continued for many years. Hill was marginalised by medical colleagues, in particular for his insistence that standard medical procedures had nothing to offer in the treatment of mental illness. Early career Memorial to Robert Gardiner Hill, Royal Edinburgh Hospital The son of Robert Hill of Louth, Deene and lately of Leamington, he was born at Louth, Lincolnshire, on 26 February 1811; John Harwood Hill was an elder brother. At the age of 14 he was apprenticed to a surgeon in Louth. He then studied at Edward Grainger's anatomy school, Guy's Hospital, and St. Thomas's Hospital, becoming a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England in 1834. On passing as a surgeon Hill went into practice at Lincoln, and in the same year obtained the appointment of house-surgeon to the General Dispensary there. At the Dispensary Hill worked with Dr. Edward Parker Charlesworth, who befriended him. \\"Non-restraint\\" Hill, with Charlesworth's assistance, was elected house surgeon to the Lincoln Lunatic Asylum. There he introduced the system of moral management in use at the York Retreat. Charlesworth had already experimented with reducing the dependence at the asylum on mechanical restraint. Hill, soon after his appointment, looked into the registers of the asylum, and began to think that he might dispense with coercion altogether. It appears from a comparison of the table of restraints for 1830, with the table for 1835, given in the appendix to Hill's book, that whereas, with a number of patients in the house, during the first of these years, amounting only to 92 (male and females included), the total number of instances of restraint had been 2364; in the latter of these years, with a number of patients greater, namely, 108, the total number of instances of restraint had only been 313; being a diminution of five-sixths of the number in the former year. One of the improvements introduced by Hill in pursuance of his system was the dormitories, almost entirely established for the prevention of suicides. He attributed most bad cases to alcohol abuse, with religious factors as the next most important. Hill had trouble maintaining a non-restraint system, without a better staff. The governors, however, would not offer higher pay without clear and convincing results.Augustus Bozzi Granville MD, FRS (1841) The Spas of England; Henry Colburn, London. Ch 4, p. 89 The system in fact required Hill to supervise the staff closely; it caused serious tensions in the asylum. By about 1839 the situation in the institution had become untenable. In 1840 Hill resigned from his post. Legacy  Despite the problems Hill experienced, his system won admirers. One of them was Sergeant John Adams, who was an assistant judge. He took an interest in the asylum when circuit duties took him up to Lincoln. In his other capacity as chairman of the Middlesex magistrates and member of the Visiting Justices to Hanwell Asylum, he encouraged the newly appointed superintendent Dr. John Conolly to visit Lincoln Asylum and witness Hill's methods. This Conolly did in the month before taking up his appointment at Hanwell, where it is recorded in the visitors' book that he admired Hill's system.Scull, Andrew (2004) Conolly, John (1794–1866) Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Career after Lincoln Asylum Hill remained in the mental health field, working in a number of asylums. He entered into partnership with Richard Sutton Harvey in 1840, and became proprietor of Eastgate House private asylum, Lincoln. On 29 October 1851 he was given a public dinner in Lincoln and presented with a testimonial as the \\"author and originator of the non-restraint system in lunacy\\"; the claim was disputed, In November 1852 he was chosen mayor of Lincoln, and he was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London on 17 February 1853. In the later 1850s he was at Wyke House Asylum, in partnership with Edmund Sparke Willett; the partnership was dissolved in 1860, with Willett remaining as proprietor.Lyttleton Forbes Winslow, Manual of Lunacy; a handbook relating to the legal care and treatment of the insane in the public and private asylums of Great Britain, Ireland, United States of America, and the Continent (1874), p. 78; archive.org. Hill became a licentiate of the College of Physicians, Edinburgh in 1859. In October 1863 Hill moved to London and became resident medical proprietor of Earl's Court House, Old Brompton, a private asylum for women, a residence formerly inhabited by John Hunter. He died of apoplexy at Earl's Court House, London, on 30 May 1878, and was buried in Highgate cemetery. Two of his sons James Robert Hill and Hugh Gardiner Hill also became doctors in asylums. His wife and at least three daughters were also closely involved in the care of the insane both before and after his death. They managed Peterborough House in Fulham and then Fenstanton House, Tulse Hill.  Publications and controversy  Hill published: * Total Abolition of Personal Restraint in the Treatment of the Insane. A Lecture, with Statistical Tables (1839). * A Concise History of the entire Abolition of Medical Restraint in the Treatment of the Insane and of the success of the Non-Restraint System (1857). * Lunacy, its Past and its Present (1870). He also wrote articles \\"On Total Abolition of Personal Restraint in Treatment of the Insane\\" in The Lancet, 11 April 1840, p. 93, and 22 February 1851, pp. 226–7; and Psychological Studies, six articles in the Medical Circular, 6 January 1858, p. 1 et seq. Hill's priority claim on non-restraint was put forward in The Lancet in 1850, in response to Charlesworth and Conolly. He did so again in the Concise History, in a response to Conolly. Sir James Clark, 1st Baronet wrote a Memoir of John Conolly that appeared in 1869, and Hill contributed further to the debate in 1870, in Lunacy.

Following exposure to ionizing radiation (e.g., electrons, ions, X-rays, extreme ultraviolet, vacuum ultraviolet), secondary electron emission from the surface of a thin insulating layer results in the establishment of a positive charge on the surface. This positive charge produces a high electric field in the insulator, resulting in the emission of electrons through the surface. This tends to pull more electrons from further beneath the surface.

The AFU was formed in response to the introduction by the Football League of the \\"retain and transfer\\" system which restricted the movement of players from one club to another, and proposals to introduce a maximum wage of £4 per week. The AFU was short-lived and failed to achieve any of its objectives. The AFU was dissolved in 1901, the same year in which the Football League introduced the maximum wage. Background In 1885, faced with the threat of a breakaway British Football Association by 31 clubs, the Football Association (FA) relented to professional players being paid by their clubs for playing. Even then, the vast majority of players had other employment and only supplemented their wages by playing football. Soon after, the FA introduced a registration system for players. Before that, a player could agree to play one or more games for any football club. After the FA recognized professionalism in 1885, it sought to control professional players by introducing a player registration system. Players had to register with a club each season, even if he remained with the same club from the season before. A player was not allowed to play until he was registered for that season. Once a player was registered with a club, he was not allowed to be registered with or play for another club during the same season without the permission of the FA and the club that held his registration. However, players were free to join another club before the start of each season, even if their former club wished to retain them. The need for regular fixtures to earn sufficient revenue to afford player wages led to the formation of the Football League in 1888. As the Football League grew in popularity, the leading players of the day were in great demand, and commanded ever-increasing wages. Players signed annual contracts with their clubs. If a club wished to retain a player for the following season, it would offer him a new contract. If the player declined the new contract, he could sign a contract with another club, and the player would be registered with the new club. Major reasons a player might move to a new club was that the club was more successful, or that it was prepared to pay him a higher wage. Smaller clubs became concerned about the growing imbalance in the game. They feared that bigger clubs would dominate the league as a consequence of being able to pay higher salaries. The Football League also took the view that a spread of talent was necessary to sustain the interest of spectators. The Football League decided that restrictions had to be placed on the ability of richer clubs to lure players from other clubs. From the start of the 1893-94 season onwards, once a player was registered with a Football League club, he could not be registered with any other club, even in subsequent seasons, without the permission of the club he was registered with. It applied even if the player's annual contract with the club holding his registration was not renewed after it expired. The club were not obliged to play him and, without a contract, the player was not entitled to receive a salary. Nevertheless, if the club refused to release his registration, the player could not play for any other Football League club. The Football League's regulations came to be known as the \\"retain and transfer\\" system. Faced with such a situation, a player had the following stark choices: # Move to a club in the Southern League, a semi-professional league formed in England in 1894, or the Scottish Football League (SFL) formed in 1890, where equivalent restrictions on movement had not yet been introduced. However, until the turn of the century, both the standard of play, and wages, were lower in these other leagues compared to the Football League. # Quit playing football altogether and return to other full-time employment. In September, 1893, Derby County proposed that the Football League should impose a maximum wage of £4 a week. At the time, most players were only part- time professionals and still had other jobs. These players did not receive as much as £4 a week and therefore the matter did not greatly concern them. However, a minority of players, were so good they were able to obtain as much as £10 a week. This proposal posed a serious threat to their income. In 1897, the SFL introduced regulation to prevent its members from employing players still registered with Football League clubs, further restricting movement by players in the Football League. Formation of the AFU In February 1898, at a meeting in Liverpool, some of the top players of the day announced the formation of the AFU. Jack Bell, the Everton forward and Scottish international, was the first chairman. John Cameron, also an Everton forward and Scottish international, was the first secretary. John Cameron, announced that the union had 250 members. Other leading players involved in the formation of the AFU or who took a leading role included Bob Holmes and Jimmy Ross of Burnley, John Devey of Aston Villa, John Somerville of Bolton Wanderers, Hugh McNeill of Sunderland, Harry Wood of Wolverhampton Wanderers, Tom Bradshaw and Abe Hartley of Liverpool, James McNaught of Newton Heath, Billy Meredith of Manchester City and Johnny Holt and David Storrier of Everton. John Cameron also stated that the AFU \\"wanted any negotiations regarding transfers to be between the interested club and the player concerned - not between club and club with the player excluded\\". However, neither the Football Association, nor the Football League recognized the AFU. Failure of the AFU In 1900, at the behest of Stoke City, the Football Association placed a maximum wage in its statutes. It was removed from the Football Association's statutes 1904. In 1901, the Football League itself introduced the maximum wage of £4 per week in its regulations. It also abolished the paying of all bonuses to players. The AFU was dissolved in the same year, having failed to achieve its objectives. One reason the AFU failed was the fact that the players of the day were not all full-time professionals. The vast majority of players in the Football League had other employment and only supplemented their wages by playing football. An example of this was Steve Bloomer of Derby County, who, in the 1890s, was also employed at the foundry near to the club's ground as a striker. Both the football club and the foundry were owned by Francis Ley at the time. Only when he was earning a significant figure as an international player and Derby regular was he able to forgo his other employment and play football full-time. Most players at the time earned less than £4 a week and were not have been affected by the implementation of a maximum wage. Further, players earning less the maximum wage did not want to offend their employers. If they were released by their club, there was no guarantee they would find another club willing to employ them, and they would have to return to other full-time employment. Support for the AFU came mainly from the highest paid players. However, many of them, including members of the AFU committee, subsequently moved to clubs in the Southern League or the Scottish League, such as: :Jack Bell and David Storrier to Celtic of the Scottish League; :John Cameron and Tom Bradshaw to Tottenham Hotspur of the Southern League; :Harry Wood and Abe Hartley to Southampton of the Southern League; and :Johnny Holt to Reading of the Southern League. Charles Saer, who replaced John Cameron as secretary of the AFU, resigned in December 1898, \\"as his scholastic duties precluded the possibility of his devoting the necessary time to the office\\". A former player with Blackburn Rovers, Saer was working as a schoolteacher. His negotiations with the Football League had ended in failure. When Bob Holmes was interviewed by the Lancashire Daily Post, he stated: :\\"I am not quite sure that we shall succeed in attaining all the objects with which we set out; it is not a certainty that we shall carry any... The break-up of the Everton team as we knew it last season may have a good deal in influencing the future of the Union. With John Cameron, Jack Bell, Robertson, Holt, Stewart, Storrier, Meecham of Everton as well as Hartley and Bradshaw of Liverpool gone, our centre has lost strength. Liverpool was our headquarters, you know, and our registered offices were there. But the secretary, John Cameron, has gone to London and Bell the chairman will not, as far as I know, play for anybody.\\" Aftermath It was another 6 years before professional footballers in England tried to organize themselves in a union, with the formation of the Association of Football Players' and Trainers' Union (the AFPTU, commonly referred to as the Players' Union), the old name for what is currently the Professional Footballers' Association.

The joint family encounters many typically Indian situations, but they try to solve it in the most atypical fashion imaginable. This is a funny bunch of people that is firmly united in their movement to get separated. They want to sell their ancestral property and move out and form their own nuclear families. But the head of their family does not agree. He gives them the choice to walk out and survive on their own; but nobody is ready to let go of the money that is due to them. So they stay together and wait for the 'head' to change his mind or stop breathing, whichever happens first.

She never works in the house, while repeating, \\"Mein to thak gayi bhaaishaab\\" (\\"I'm so tired\\"). She is always richly dressed and cannot live without wearing 'Gajre' (strings of flowers) in her hair. She doesn't speak English and hence needs to have it translated by Praful, which has great comic results. |-  |Jayshree Parekh Vandana Pathak |She is the widowed daughter-in-law of Tulsidas. She is the wife of Praful's brother, Bharat. She loves to cook & gossip and is often seen on the phone talking to her Ba (mother). She controls the management of the household.

Hansa and Jayshree are childhood friends. |-  |Himanshu Seth |Jamnadas Majethia |He is Hansa's younger brother. He also lives with the Parekhs & is as stupid as Hansa & Praful, with Babuji derisively addressing him as Moonchowaale Hansa (Mustached Hansa). He has a Catering business. His favorite line is \\"Kissi ko pata nahi chalega\\" (\\"No one will know about it\\"). |-  |Chakki Parekh Richa Bhadra She is the daughter of Praful and Hansa. Unlike her parents, she is intelligent. She has a catchphrase, \\"Bade Log Bade Log\\" (Oh! the elders, the elders!), which she repeats along with her cousin Jacky. |-  |Jackky Parekh |Yash Mittal He is the only son of Jayshree. Like Chakki, he is also intelligent and has the catchphrase \\"Bade Log Bade Log\\", which he says along with Chakki. |} { style=\\"font-size:90%\\" width=100%; |- align=\\"center\\"  Character  Portrayed by  Notes |-  |Badi Maa |Dina Pathak / Lily Patel |She is the mother of Tulsidas.

He starts flirting with any young beautiful girl he meets. He is married to Melissa. |-  Melissa Parekh |Tina Parekh |She is Raju's wife. She is beautiful and well-educated.

She is very lazy and always has the urge to go to toilet. She is older than her fraternal-twin, Meera. |-  |Madhuri |Sweety Nayak |She is Heera's personal maid.

In 2020, 'Boden narrowly lost out to Cuala in a thrilling final (2-20 to 1-18) in Parnell Park. In June 2010 the club became the first Dublin club to win the Leinster Senior League Division 1. They achieved this (without their 7 Dublin Senior players) by beating Castlecomer after extra time in Nolan Park on a scoreline of 3–21 to 3–19. Further Leinster Senior League titles were added in 2013 and 2016. Ballyboden have also won nine Dublin Senior Hurling Division 1 league titles (1993, 1999, 2004, 2007, 2009, 2012, 2013, 2017, 2018), nine Dublin U/21 and ten Dublin Minor championships.

He served as Archbishop of Bologna from 1968 to 1983, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1969. Biography Poma was born in Villanterio, and studied at the seminary in Pavia and the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome (from where he obtained his Doctor of Theology degree in 1934). He was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop Giuseppe Palica on 15 April 1933, in the chapel of the Major Roman Seminary. Before becoming rector of the Pavia seminary in July 1947, he was made private secretary to the Bishop of Pavia and a professor of literature and of dogmatic theology at the same seminary in 1935. On 28 October 1951, Poma was appointed auxiliary bishop of Mantua and Titular Bishop of Thagaste by Pope Pius XII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 9 December from Bishop Carlo Allorio, with Bishops Vittorio De Zanche and Giuseppe Piazzi serving as co- consecrators, in the Cathedral of Pavia. Poma was named coadjutor bishop of Mantua on 2 August 1952, later succeeding Domenico Menna as Bishop of the same on 8 September 1954. From 1962 to 1965, he attended the Second Vatican Council. He was advanced to Coadjutor Archbishop of Bologna and Titular Archbishop of Hierpiniana on 16 July 1967. On 12 February 1968, Poma succeeded Giacomo Lercaro as Archbishop of Bologna upon the latter's resignation. Pope Paul VI created him Cardinal-Priest of S. Luca a Via Prenestina in the consistory of 28 April 1969. From 1969 to 1979, Poma served as President of the Italian Episcopal Conference; during this capacity, he warned that Catholics who support Communism separate themselves from the Church.TIME Magazine.

Possessing a rich dramatic voice, he became a particularly lauded artist within the repertoire of Richard Wagner and Giuseppe Verdi. He notably portrayed the role of Richard the Lion Heart in the world premiere of Albert Dietrich's Robin Hood in 1879 and the role of Amaury de Montfort in the world premiere of Jules Deswert's Die Albigenser in 1880. He also sang the title role in Mozart's Don Giovanni for the opening of the Opern- und Schauspielhaus Frankfurt in 1880. Beck was a member of various opera companies during his career including the Vienna State Opera, the Hamburg State Opera, and the Metropolitan Opera among others. He gave up his career after 1895 to look after his ailing father, who outlived him by one year. Beck sang a wide repertoire that encompassed German opera, Italian opera, and French opera. Among the many roles he portrayed are Pizarro in Beethoven's Fidelio, the title role in Peter Cornelius's Der Barbier von Bagdad, Petruchio in Hermann Goetz's Der Widerspänstigen Zähmung, King Solomon in Karl Goldmark’s Die Königin von Saba, Valentin in Charles Gounod's Faust, Katwald in Heinrich Hofmann's Armin, Lars in E.

Their stated aims were freedom of movement of players and obtaining the same employment rights as other workers.John Harding, ‘Meredith, William Henry [Billy] (1874–1958)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 The Players' Union was formed at a meeting on 2 December 1907 when Charlie Roberts and Billy Meredith (who had been involved in the AFU) convened the organisation of the Association of Football Players' and Trainers' Union (‘AFPTU’) (which the press called \\"The Players' Union\\") at the Imperial Hotel, Manchester. This was the second attempt at the unionisation of professional football players after the failure of the Association Footballers' Union which dissolved itself in 1901. This Union was formed because the Football League had ratified a maximum wage for footballers in 1901 at £4 (2012: £) . This severely limited the opportunity to earn wages that allowed the best players in the country to forgo the need to take paid employment outside of football. Until then, individual clubs had set their own wage policies throughout the country. The Union, basically, led from where the previous AFU had left the situation: that is by challenging the introduction of a maximum wage and the restraint on transfers. The Union were almost ruined financially and membership fell drastically as a result of Kingaby v Aston Villa. They had funded the legal costs of outside right, Herbert Kingaby, but erroneous strategy by the player's counsel resulted in the suit being dismissed.David McArdle, LLB PhD, The Football League's player registration scheme and the Kingaby case , accessed 16 December 2012 1909–10 season. The Union's objectives were made clear in 1909, and this caused the Football Association to withdraw their recognition of the Union, which at that time sought to join the General Federation of Trade Unions. The Union threatened strike action but the Football Association responded by banning those affiliated with the AFPTU sine die. The Manchester United players continued to strike but the lack of resolve elsewhere would have led to the failure of this movement if it had not been for Tim Coleman of Everton breaking ranks with his colleagues and striking in support of what the press had classified as The Outcasts F.C. at Manchester United Coleman's intervention resuscitated support for the cause and the Union, having regained its strength of numbers, settled for official recognition and the allowing of bonus payments in order to supplement the maximum wage. These were essentially conciliatory gestures; the maximum wage remained a yoke under which players suffered for the next 50 years.

It is used in the teaching of singing and assists in defining what singing is, how singing works, and how proper singing technique is accomplished. Vocal pedagogy covers a broad range of aspects of singing, ranging from the physiological process of vocal production to the artistic aspects of interpretation of songs from different genres or historical eras. Typical areas of study include: : * Human anatomy and physiology as it relates to the physical process of singing. * Breathing and air support for singing * Posture for singing * Phonation * Vocal resonation or voice projection * Diction, vowels and articulation * Vocal registration * Sostenuto and legato for singing * Other singing elements, such as range extension, tone quality, vibrato, coloratura * Vocal health and voice disorders related to singing * Vocal styles, such as learning to sing opera, belt, or art song * Phonetics * Voice classification All of these different concepts are a part of developing proper vocal technique. Not all voice teachers have the same opinions within every topic of study which causes variations in pedagogical approaches and vocal technique. History Pythagoras, the man in the center with the book, teaching music, in The School of Athens by Raphael Within Western culture, the study of vocal pedagogy began in Ancient Greece. Scholars such as Alypius and Pythagoras studied and made observations on the art of singing. It is unclear, however, whether the Greeks ever developed a systematic approach to teaching singing as little writing on the subject survives today.The New Grove Dictionary of Music & Musicians. Edited by Stanley Sadie, Volume 6. Edmund to Fryklund. , Copyright Macmillan 1980. The first surviving record of a systematized approach to teaching singing was developed in the medieval monasteries of the Roman Catholic Church sometime near the beginning of the 13th century. As with other fields of study, the monasteries were the center of musical intellectual life during the medieval period and many men within the monasteries devoted their time to the study of music and the art of singing. Highly influential in the development of a vocal pedagogical system were monks Johannes de Garlandia and Jerome of Moravia who were the first to develop a concept of vocal registers. These men identified three registers: chest voice, throat voice, and head voice (pectoris, guttoris, and capitis). Their concept of head voice, however, is much more similar to the modern pedagogists understanding of the falsetto register. Other concepts discussed in the monastic system included vocal resonance, voice classification, breath support, diction, and tone quality to name a few. The ideas developed within the monastic system highly influenced the development of vocal pedagogy over the next several centuries including the Bel Canto style of singing. With the onset of the Renaissance in the 15th century, the study of singing began to move outside of the church. The courts of rich patrons, such as the Dukes of Burgundy who supported the Burgundian School and the Franco-Flemish School, became secular centers of study for singing and all other areas of musical study. The vocal pedagogical methods taught in these schools, however, were based on the concepts developed within the monastic system. Many of the teachers within these schools had their initial musical training from singing in church choirs as children. The church also remained at the forefront of musical composition at this time and remained highly influential in shaping musical tastes and practices both in and outside the church. It was the Catholic Church that first popularized the use of castrato singers in the 16th century, which ultimately led to the popularity of castrato voices in Baroque and Classical operas. It was not until the development of opera in the 17th century that vocal pedagogy began to break away from some of the established thinking of the monastic writers and develop deeper understandings of the physical process of singing and its relation to key concepts like vocal registration and vocal resonation. It was also during this time, that noted voice teachers began to emerge. Giulio Caccini is an example of an important early Italian voice teacher. In the late 17th century, the bel canto method of singing began to develop in Italy. This style of singing had a huge impact on the development of opera and the development of vocal pedagogy during the Classical and Romantic periods. It was during this time, that teachers and composers first began to identify singers by and write roles for more specific voice types. However, it wasn't until the 19th century that more clearly defined voice classification systems like the German Fach system emerged. Within these systems, more descriptive terms were used in classifying voices such as coloratura soprano and lyric soprano. Examining the vocal mechanism with a laryngoscope, late 19th century Voice teachers in the 19th century continued to train singers for careers in opera. Manuel Patricio Rodríguez García is often considered one of the most important voice teachers of the 19th century, and is credited with the development of the laryngoscope and the beginning of modern voice pedagogy. Mathilde Marchesi was both an important singer and teacher of singing at the turn of the 20th century. The field of voice pedagogy became more fully developed in the middle of the 20th century. A few American voice teachers began to study the science, anatomy, and physiology of singing, especially Ralph Appelman at Indiana University, Oren Brown at the Washington University School of Medicine and later the Juilliard School, and William Vennard at the University of Southern California. This shift in approach to the study of singing led to the rejection of many of the assertions of the bel canto singing method, most particularly in the areas of vocal registration and vocal resonation. As a result, there are currently two predominating schools of thought among voice teachers today, those who maintain the historical positions of the bel canto method and those who choose to embrace more contemporary understandings based in current knowledge of human anatomy and physiology. There are also those teachers who borrow ideas from both perspectives, creating a hybrid of the two. Appelman and Vennard were also part of a group of voice instructors who developed courses of study for beginning voice teachers, adding these scientific ideas to the standard exercises and empirical ways to improve vocal technique, and by 1980 the subject of voice pedagogy was beginning to be included in many college music degree programs for singers and vocal music educators. More recent works by authors such as Richard Miller and Johan Sundberg have increased the general knowledge of voice teachers, and scientific and practical aspects of voice pedagogy continue to be studied and discussed by professionals. In addition, the creation of organisations such as the National Association of Teachers of Singing (now an international organization of Vocal Instructors) has enabled voice teachers to establish more of a consensus about their work, and has expanded the understanding of what singing teachers do. Topics of study Pedagogical philosophy There are basically three major approaches to vocal pedagogy, all related to how the mechanistic and psychological controls are employed within the act of singing. Some voice instructors advocate an extreme mechanistic approach that believes that singing is largely a matter of getting the right physical parts in the right places at the right time, and that correcting vocal faults is accomplished by calling direct attention to the parts which are not working well. On the other extreme, is the school of thought that believes that attention should never be directed to any part of the vocal mechanism—that singing is a matter of producing the right mental images of the desired tone, and that correcting vocal faults is achieved by learning to think the right thoughts and by releasing the emotions through interpretation of the music. Most voice teachers, however, believe that the truth lies somewhere in between the two extremes and adopt a composite of those two approaches. The nature of vocal sounds Physiology of vocal sound production right There are four physical processes involved in producing vocal sound: respiration, phonation, resonation, and articulation. These processes occur in the following sequence: #Breath is taken #Sound is initiated in the larynx #The vocal resonators receive the sound and influence it #The articulators shape the sound into recognizable units Although these four processes are to be considered separately, in actual practice they merge into one coordinated function. With an effective singer or speaker, one should rarely be reminded of the process involved as their mind and body are so coordinated that one only perceives the resulting unified function. Many vocal problems result from a lack of coordination within this process. =Respiration= A labeled anatomical diagram of the vocal folds or cords. In its most basic sense, respiration is the process of moving air in and out of the body—inhalation and exhalation. Sound is produced in the Larynx. But producing the sound would not be possible without a power source: the flow of air from the lungs. This flow sets the vocal folds into motion to produce sound.'Anatomy of the Voice' by Theodore Dimon, Illustration by G. David Brown. Breathing for singing and speaking is a more controlled process than is the ordinary breathing used for sustaining life. The controls applied to exhalation are particularly important in good vocal technique. =Phonation= Phonation is the process of producing vocal sound by the vibration of the vocal folds that is in turn modified by the resonance of the vocal tract.Titze, I. R. (2008). The human instrument. Sci.Am. 298 (1):94–101. PM 18225701Titze, I.R. (1994). Principles of Voice Production, Prentice Hall (currently published by NCVS.org), . It takes place in the larynx when the vocal folds are brought together and breath pressure is applied to them in such a way that vibration ensues causing an audible source of acoustic energy, i.e., sound, which can then be modified by the articulatory actions of the rest of the vocal apparatus. The vocal folds are brought together primarily by the action of the interarytenoid muscles, which pull the arytenoid cartilages together. =Resonation= right Vocal resonation is the process by which the basic product of phonation is enhanced in timbre and/or intensity by the air-filled cavities through which it passes on its way to the outside air. Various terms related to the resonation process include amplification, enrichment, enlargement, improvement, intensification, and prolongation, although in strictly scientific usage acoustic authorities would question most of them. The main point to be drawn from these terms by a singer or speaker is that the end result of resonation is, or should be, to make a better sound. There are seven areas that may be listed as possible vocal resonators. In sequence from the lowest within the body to the highest, these areas are the chest, the tracheal tree, the larynx itself, the pharynx, the oral cavity, the nasal cavity, and the sinuses. Research has shown that the larynx, the pharynx and the oral cavity are the main resonators of vocal sound, with the nasal cavity only coming into play in nasal consonants, or nasal vowels, such as those found in French. This main resonating space, from above the vocal folds to the lips is known as the vocal tract. Many voice users experience sensations in the sinuses that may be misconstrued as resonance. However, these sensations are caused by sympathetic vibrations, and are a result, rather than a cause, of efficient vocal resonance. =Articulation= Places of articulation (passive & active): 1\\\\. Exo-labial, 2. Endo-labial, 3. Dental, 4. Alveolar, 5. Post-alveolar, 6. Pre-palatal, 7. Palatal, 8. Velar, 9. Uvular, 10. Pharyngeal, 11. Glottal, 12. Epiglottal, 13. Radical, 14. Postero-dorsal, 15. Antero-dorsal, 16. Laminal, 17. Apical, 18. Sub-apical Articulation is the process by which the joint product of the vibrator and the resonators is shaped into recognizable speech sounds through the muscular adjustments and movements of the speech organs. These adjustments and movements of the articulators result in verbal communication and thus form the essential difference between the human voice and other musical instruments. Singing without understandable words limits the voice to nonverbal communication. In relation to the physical process of singing, vocal instructors tend to focus more on active articulation as opposed to passive articulation. There are five basic active articulators: the lip (\\"labial consonants\\"), the flexible front of the tongue (\\"coronal consonants\\"), the middle/back of the tongue (\\"dorsal consonants\\"), the root of the tongue together with the epiglottis (\\"pharyngeal consonants\\"), and the glottis (\\"glottal consonants\\"). These articulators can act independently of each other, and two or more may work together in what is called coarticulation. Unlike active articulation, passive articulation is a continuum without many clear-cut boundaries. The places linguolabial and interdental, interdental and dental, dental and alveolar, alveolar and palatal, palatal and velar, velar and uvular merge into one another, and a consonant may be pronounced somewhere between the named places. In addition, when the front of the tongue is used, it may be the upper surface or blade of the tongue that makes contact (\\"laminal consonants\\"), the tip of the tongue (\\"apical consonants\\"), or the under surface (\\"sub-apical consonants\\"). These articulations also merge into one another without clear boundaries. =Interpretation= Interpretation is sometimes listed by voice teachers as a fifth physical process even though strictly speaking it is not a physical process. The reason for this is that interpretation does influence the kind of sound a singer makes which is ultimately achieved through a physical action the singer is doing. Although teachers may acquaint their students with musical styles and performance practices and suggest certain interpretive effects, most voice teachers agree that interpretation can not be taught. Students who lack a natural creative imagination and aesthetic sensibility can not learn it from someone else. Failure to interpret well is not a vocal fault, even though it may affect vocal sound significantly. Classification of vocal sounds Vocal sounds are divided into two basic categories-vowels and consonants-with a wide variety of sub-classifications. Voice teachers and serious voice students spend a great deal of time studying how the voice forms vowels and consonants, and studying the problems that certain consonants or vowels may cause while singing. The International Phonetic Alphabet is used frequently by voice teachers and their students. Problems in describing vocal sounds Describing vocal sound is an inexact science largely because the human voice is a self-contained instrument. Since the vocal instrument is internal, the singer's ability to monitor the sound produced is complicated by the vibrations carried to the ear through the Eustachean (auditory) tube and the bony structures of the head and neck. In other words, most singers hear something different in their ears/head than what a person listening to them hears. As a result, voice teachers often focus less on how it \\"sounds\\" and more on how it \\"feels\\". Vibratory sensations resulting from the closely related processes of phonation and resonation, and kinesthetic ones arising from muscle tension, movement, body position, and weight serve as a guide to the singer on correct vocal production. Another problem in describing vocal sound lies in the vocal vocabulary itself. There are many schools of thought within vocal pedagogy and different schools have adopted different terms, sometimes from other artistic disciplines. This has led to the use of a plethora of descriptive terms applied to the voice which are not always understood to mean the same thing. Some terms sometimes used to describe a quality of a voice's sound are: warm, white, dark, light, round, reedy, spread, focused, covered, swallowed, forward, ringing, hooty, bleaty, plummy, mellow, pear-shaped, and so forth. Body alignment The singing process functions best when certain physical conditions of the body exist. The ability to move air in and out of the body freely and to obtain the needed quantity of air can be seriously affected by the body alignment of the various parts of the breathing mechanism. A sunken chest position will limit the capacity of the lungs, and a tense abdominal wall will inhibit the downward travel of the diaphragm. Good body alignment allows the breathing mechanism to fulfill its basic function efficiently without any undue expenditure of energy. Good body alignment also makes it easier to initiate phonation and to tune the resonators as proper alignment prevents unnecessary tension in the body. Voice Instructors have also noted that when singers assume good body alignment it often provides them with a greater sense of self-assurance and poise while performing. Audiences also tend to respond better to singers with good body alignment. Habitual good body alignment also ultimately improves the overall health of the body by enabling better blood circulation and preventing fatigue and stress on the body. Breathing and breath support Demonstration of the small amount and low velocity of the breathing air during supported singing with a candle light In the words of Robert C. White, who paraphrased a \\"Credo\\" for singing: > In the Beginning there was Breath, and Singing was with Breath, and Singing > was Breath, and Singing was Breath. And all singing was made by the Breath, > and without Breath was not any Singing made that was made. (White 1988, p. > 26) All singing begins with breath. All vocal sounds are created by vibrations in the larynx caused by air from the lungs. Breathing in everyday life is a subconscious bodily function which occurs naturally, however the singer must have control of the intake and exhalation of breath to achieve maximum results from their voice. Natural breathing has three stages: a breathing-in period, a breathing-out period, and a resting or recovery period; these stages are not usually consciously controlled. Within singing there are four stages of breathing: # breathing-in period (inhalation) # setting up controls period (suspension) # controlled exhalation period (phonation) # recovery period These stages must be under conscious control by the singer until they become conditioned reflexes. Many singers abandon conscious controls before their reflexes are fully conditioned which ultimately leads to chronic vocal problems. Voice classification In European classical music and opera, voices are treated like musical instruments. Composers who write vocal music must have an understanding of the skills, talents, and vocal properties of singers. Voice classification is the process by which human singing voices are evaluated and are thereby designated into voice types. These qualities include but are not limited to: vocal range, vocal weight, vocal tessitura, vocal timbre, and vocal transition points such as breaks and lifts within the voice. Other considerations are physical characteristics, speech level, scientific testing, and vocal registration. The science behind voice classification developed within European classical music and has been slow in adapting to more modern forms of singing. Voice classification is often used within opera to associate possible roles with potential voices. There are currently several different systems in use within classical music including: the German Fach system and the choral music system among many others. No system is universally applied or accepted. However, most classical music systems acknowledge seven different major voice categories. Women are typically divided into three groups: soprano, mezzo-soprano, and contralto. Men are usually divided into four groups: countertenor, tenor, baritone, and bass. When considering children's voices, an eighth term, treble, can be applied. Within each of these major categories there are several sub-categories that identify specific vocal qualities like coloratura facility and vocal weight to differentiate between voices. Within choral music, singers voices are divided solely on the basis of vocal range. Choral music most commonly divides vocal parts into high and low voices within each sex (SATB). As a result, the typical choral situation affords many opportunities for misclassification to occur. Since most people have medium voices, they must be assigned to a part that is either too high or too low for them; the mezzo-soprano must sing soprano or alto and the baritone must sing tenor or bass. Either option can present problems for the singer, but for most singers there are fewer dangers in singing too low than in singing too high. Within contemporary forms of music (sometimes referred to as Contemporary Commercial Music), singers are classified by the style of music they sing, such as jazz, pop, blues, soul, country, folk, and rock styles. There is currently no authoritative voice classification system within non-classical music. Attempts have been made to adopt classical voice type terms to other forms of singing but such attempts have been met with controversy. The development of voice categorizations were made with the understanding that the singer would be using classical vocal technique within a specified range using unamplified (no microphones) vocal production. Since contemporary musicians use different vocal techniques, microphones, and are not forced to fit into a specific vocal role, applying such terms as soprano, tenor, baritone, etc. can be misleading or even inaccurate. Dangers of quick identification Many voice teachers warn of the dangers of quick identification. Premature concern with classification can result in misclassification, with all its attendant dangers. Vennard says: \\"I never feel any urgency about classifying a beginning student. So many premature diagnoses have been proved wrong, and it can be harmful to the student and embarrassing to the teacher to keep striving for an ill-chosen goal. It is best to begin in the middle part of the voice and work upward and downward until the voice classifies itself.\\" Most voice teachers believe that it is essential to establish good vocal habits within a limited and comfortable range before attempting to classify the voice. When techniques of posture, breathing, phonation, resonation, and articulation have become established in this comfortable area, the true quality of the voice will emerge and the upper and lower limits of the range can be explored safely. Only then can a tentative classification be arrived at, and it may be adjusted as the voice continues to develop. Many acclaimed voice instructors suggest that teachers begin by assuming that a voice is of a medium classification until it proves otherwise. The reason for this is that the majority of individuals possess medium voices and therefore this approach is less likely to misclassify or damage the voice. Vocal registration Vocal registration refers to the system of vocal registers within the human voice. A register in the human voice is a particular series of tones, produced in the same vibratory pattern of the vocal folds, and possessing the same quality. Registers originate in laryngeal function. They occur because the vocal folds are capable of producing several different vibratory patterns. Each of these vibratory patterns appears within a particular range of pitches and produces certain characteristic sounds. The term register can be somewhat confusing as it encompasses several aspects of the human voice. The term register can be used to refer to any of the following: * A particular part of the vocal range such as the upper, middle, or lower registers. * A resonance area such as chest voice or head voice. * A phonatory process * A certain vocal timbre * A region of the voice which is defined or delimited by vocal breaks. * A subset of a language used for a particular purpose or in a particular social setting. In linguistics, a register language is a language which combines tone and vowel phonation into a single phonological system. Within speech pathology the term vocal register has three constituent elements: a certain vibratory pattern of the vocal folds, a certain series of pitches, and a certain type of sound. Speech pathologists identify four vocal registers based on the physiology of laryngeal function: the vocal fry register, the modal register, the falsetto register, and the whistle register. This view is also adopted by many teachers of singing. Some voice teachers, however, organize registers differently. There are over a dozen different constructs of vocal registers in use within the field. The confusion which exists concerning what a register is, and how many registers there are, is due in part to what takes place in the modal register when a person sings from the lowest pitches of that register to the highest pitches. The frequency of vibration of the vocal folds is determined by their length, tension, and mass. As pitch rises, the vocal folds are lengthened, tension increases, and their thickness decreases. In other words, all three of these factors are in a state of flux in the transition from the lowest to the highest tones. If a singer holds any of these factors constant and interferes with their progressive state of change, his laryngeal function tends to become static and eventually breaks occur with obvious changes of tone quality. These breaks are often identified as register boundaries or as transition areas between registers. The distinct change or break between registers is called a passaggio or a ponticello.John Warrack, Ewan West. ‘’The Oxford Dictionary of Opera’’, Vocal instructors teach that with study a singer can move effortlessly from one register to the other with ease and consistent tone. Registers can even overlap while singing. Teachers who like to use this theory of \\"blending registers\\" usually help students through the \\"passage\\" from one register to another by hiding their \\"lift\\" (where the voice changes). However, many voice instructors disagree with this distinction of boundaries blaming such breaks on vocal problems which have been created by a static laryngeal adjustment that does not permit the necessary changes to take place. This difference of opinion has effected the different views on vocal registration. Coordination Singing is an integrated and coordinated act and it is difficult to discuss any of the individual technical areas and processes without relating them to the others. For example, phonation only comes into perspective when it is connected with respiration; the articulators affect resonance; the resonators affect the vocal folds; the vocal folds affect breath control; and so forth. Vocal problems are often a result of a breakdown in one part of this coordinated process which causes voice teachers to frequently focus in, intensively, on one area of the process with their student until that issue is resolved. However, some areas of the art of singing are so much the result of coordinated functions that it is hard to discuss them under a traditional heading like phonation, resonation, articulation, or respiration. Once the voice student has become aware of the physical processes that make up the act of singing and of how those processes function, the student begins the task of trying to coordinate them. Inevitably, students and teachers will become more concerned with one area of the technique than another. The various processes may progress at different rates, with a resulting imbalance or lack of coordination. The areas of vocal technique which seem to depend most strongly on the student's ability to coordinate various functions are: # Extending the vocal range to its maximum potential # Developing consistent vocal production with a consistent tone quality # Developing flexibility and agility # Achieving a balanced vibrato Developing the singing voice Some consider that singing is not a natural process but is a skill that requires highly developed muscle reflexes, but others consider that some ways of singing can be considered as natural. For thousands of years all over the world people have sung—to express joy, celebration and grief, to aid healing, to accompany work, devotion and the rituals of life—without worrying about having a ‘good’ voice or ‘getting it right’. Singing does not require much muscle strength but it does require a high degree of muscle coordination. Individuals can develop their voices further through the careful and systematic practice of both songs and vocal exercises. Voice teachers instruct their students to exercise their voices in an intelligent manner. Singers should be thinking constantly about the kind of sound they are making and the kind of sensations they are feeling while they are singing. =Exercising the singing voice= There are several purposes for vocal exercises, including: # Warming up the voice # Extending the vocal range # \\"Lining up\\" the voice horizontally and vertically # Acquiring vocal techniques such as legato, staccato, control of dynamics, rapid figurations, learning to comfortably sing wide intervals, and correcting vocal faults. =Extending the vocal range= An important goal of vocal development is to learn to sing to the natural limits of one's vocal range without any obvious or distracting changes of quality or technique. Voice instructors teach that a singer can only achieve this goal when all of the physical processes involved in singing (such as laryngeal action, breath support, resonance adjustment, and articulatory movement) are effectively working together. Most voice teachers believe that the first step in coordinating these processes is by establishing good vocal habits in the most comfortable tessitura of the voice first before slowly expanding the range beyond that. There are three factors which significantly affect the ability to sing higher or lower: #The Energy Factor – In this usage the word energy has several connotations. It refers to the total response of the body to the making of sound. It refers to a dynamic relationship between the breathing-in muscles and the breathing-out muscles known as the breath support mechanism. It also refers to the amount of breath pressure delivered to the vocal folds and their resistance that pressure, and it refers to the dynamic level of the sound. #The Space Factor – Space refers to the amount of space created by the moving of the mouth and the position of the palate and larynx. Generally speaking, a singer's mouth should be opened wider the higher they sing. The internal space or position of the soft palate and larynx can be widened by the relaxing of the throat. Voice teachers often describe this as feeling like the \\"beginning of a yawn\\". #The Depth Factor – In this usage the word depth has two connotations. It refers to the actual physical sensations of depth in the body and vocal mechanism and it refers to mental concepts of depth as related to tone quality. McKinney says, \\"These three factors can be expressed in three basic rules: (1) As you sing higher, you must use more energy; as you sing lower, you must use less. (2) As you sing higher, you must use more space; as you sing lower, you must use less. (3) As you sing higher, you must use more depth; as you sing lower, you must use less.\\" General music studies Some voice teachers will spend time working with their students on general music knowledge and skills, particularly music theory, music history, and musical styles and practices as it relates to the vocal literature being studied. If required they may also spend time helping their students become better sight readers, often adopting solfège, which assigns certain syllables to the notes of the scale. Performance skills and practices Since singing is a performing art, voice teachers spend some of their time preparing their students for performance. This includes teaching their students etiquette of behavior on stage such as bowing, learning to manage stage fright, addressing problems like nervous tics, and the use of equipment such as microphones. Some students may also be preparing for careers in the fields of opera or musical theater where acting skills are required. Many voice instructors will spend time on acting techniques and audience communication with students in these fields of interest. Students of opera also spend a great deal of time with their voice teachers learning foreign language pronunciations.

It comprises 72 municipalities, of which 53 are in the province of Valladolid, 17 are in the north of the province of Segovia, and 2 are in the north of the province of Ávila.\\"Denominación de Origen Rueda\\", webpage of . Retrieved March 7, 2008. It is one of Spain's leading wine regions, and is known primarily for its white wines based on the Verdejo grape. History A Verdejo from Rueda. Underground cellar. The first documentary evidence of wine production in this area dates from the 11th century, when King Alfonso VI offered title to lands to settlers in the recently reconquered area. Many individuals and monastic orders accepted the offer and founded monasteries with their own vineyards. During the 18th century the land planted to vines was greater in extent than it is now and was exclusively under the Verdejo grape variety. The wines produced enjoyed great commercial success in part due to the clarification process used which involved the use of local clay. In the years between 1890 and 1922 the phylloxera louse destroyed over two thirds of the vines, which were replanted by grafting onto louse resistant New World rootstock. However, the new varieties were selected according to productivity criteria rather than quality ones and for many years the wine produced was sold in bulk. The idea of creating a DO was first raised in 1935 but it was not until 1972 that major investment by the Rioja winery, Marqués de Riscal, signalled the start of a second era of quality wine production, again based on the Verdejo variety. Official DO status was acquired in 1980. Geography The DO englobes an area of 16.164,92 hectares and is centered around the town of Rueda, in the province of Valladolid about 170 km northwest of Madrid. The land is a flat high plain at an altitude of between 600 and 780 m above sea level. The Duero River flows through the area from east to west. Climate The climate is continental (long hot summers, cold winters) with a certain Atlantic maritime influences. Temperatures vary widely and can drop below zero in winter (-1 °C) and can reach 30 °C in summer, which is not as high as similar wine-producing regions in southern Central Spain. There is a risk of frost, freezing fog, high winds and hailstones in winter/spring. On the other hand there is only a very small possibility of drought. Normally it rains in spring and autumn, with an average rainfall of 400 mm/year, while the vines receive 2,700 hours of sunlight per year. Soils Close to the River Duero the soils are alluvial with a high lime content (max 24%). To the south the topsoil is brown and sandy with a gravel and clay subsoil. Drainage is good, has a rich iron content and is easy to plough. Grape varieties * The authorized white varieties are: Verdejo, Viura, Sauvignon blanc, and Palomino Fino. More recently foreign varieties such as Viognier and Chardonnay have been approved as well. * The authorised red varieties are: Tempranillo, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah and Garnacha. The authorized yield for white varieties is 8,000 kg/ha (10,000 kh/ha if on trellises) though in practice the yields are only between one quarter and one half of this level. Most new vineyards are planted with rows at 3 m intervals to allow mechanization. Irrigation is only allowed under special circumstances. Vines are often trained close to the ground to resist the strong winds that are characteristic of the area. See also *Spanish wine *Cuisine of Valladolid References External links * D.O.

In 1349, because the city of Mons was touched by the plague, the authorities decided to organise a procession with the shrine of Waltrude. The shrine was brought to Casteau (a little village located between Mons and Soignies that has been the location of SHAPE since 1967). At the same time, the shrine of Vincent Madelgarus (husband of Waltrude) that is based in Soignies was also taken to the same place. A miracle happened and the plague disappeared after this Procession. In 1352, the date was fixed on Trinity Sunday. After 1380, the fraternity of Saint George has appeared in the procession. The reconstitution of the combat between Saint George and a Dragon took his place in the feast. Because of the ’’less religious’’ origin, the combat was excluded from the procession in the 19th century. The separation between the religious parts of the feast and the non religious began at this time. The procession did not take place during the French revolution, in 1803 and during the two world wars. Planning The feast begins from the Saturday before Trinity Sunday to the next Sunday. As an eight-day festival with a specific liturgy, it can be called an octave. The Procession The descent of the shrine takes place on the Saturday evening. During a religious ceremony, the shrine is taken down from its Altar. The Priest gives the shrine (kept all year in the church) to the town authorities for the duration of the festival. Then a procession with torches begins in the streets of the town. On the morning of Trinity Sunday, the shrine is placed on the Car d’Or, which is a gilded dray, and the procession begins. The Car d’Or is pulled through the streets by draft horses. The carriage is accompanied by several guilds that represent the history of the region. At the end of the procession, the Car d’Or has to climb a steep, cobblestone street, the Rampe Sainte-Waudru. To help the horses with the immense weight, hundreds of people gather behind to push. Local superstition holds that if the Car d'Or doesn't reach the top of the hill in one go, the city will suffer great misfortune. This happened in 1803, due to the French Revolution, in 1914 and in 1940, just prior to the First and Second World Wars. At the end of the week, the shrine is returned to its rightful place in Sainte-Waudru Collegiate Church with great ceremony. The game of Saint George 19th-century engraving showing the combat of Saint George and the dragon. Saint George and the Chinchins. This game is played on the Trinity Sunday between 12:30 (p.m.) and 13:00 (1 p.m.). It represents the fight between Saint George (the good) and the dragon (the evil). The fight is called Lumeçon. This name comes from the old French name Limaçon (old French name meaning a spectacle with horses that made circular movements.) The combat happens on the central square of Mons. The length of the dragon is about 10 metres. The end of his tail is covered with horses' hairs (mane). The dragon is displaced with the help of the white men (fr:Hommes blancs). Saint George is protected by the Chinchins who represent dogs. The dragon is helped by the devils (French: Les diables). Each devil is armed with a cow bladder full of air (the balloon in the past before plastic had been developed). With this weapon, they knock the Chinchins and the public that are placed all around the arena. The dragon attacks Saint George with his tail. The dragon also attacks the public. So the public is also an important participant in the fight. People try to take the mane of the tail because it is said to bring luck for a year. Finally, there are also the Leaf men (fr:Hommes de feuilles) that are covered with real leaves of ivy. They help the dragon by defending and supporting his tail. The combat is precisely choreographed. Saint George on his horse turns clockwise. And the dragon turns in the other direction. (This is a reference to good versus evil). Saint George tries to kill the dragon with his lance but the lance always breaks on contacting the dragon's skin. Saint George uses a pistol and finally kills the dragon on the third try. At 13:00 (1 p.m.), the participants leave the square, people rush into the arena to find the last lucky manes which have fallen on the ground. And the carillon of Mons rings. Other information * A big concert is organised the Friday evening before Trinity on the central square of Mons. * Military bands from all over the world play concerts every day in Mons. * A braderie (street clearance sale) is organised on Monday. * Another combat is organised on next Sunday. The combat is reserved for the children (Public and actors). The dragon is lighter than the original. * The streets of the centre of the town are a pedestrian zone during the festivities. These streets are full of people listening to music, eating Belgian chips, barbecue, and drinking a lot of Belgian beer and soda.

Sir Robert Lorimer, one of the architects involved in the Imperial War Graves Commission,Hussey, 1931; Dictionary of National Biography, 1937 was appointed in 1919, but opposition to a large-scale monument arose from the Cockburn Association and others concerned with the castle's heritage.

The encounter occurred during the frontier campaign waged between 1327 and 1333 by Alfonso XI of Castile against Muhammed IV, Sultan of Granada.  War on the frontier of Granada  In 1325, King Alfonso declared war on the Moorish Emirate of Granada and invited other Christian kings to join him in a new crusade. While negotiations continued, Alfonso initiated a campaign against the western frontier of Granada. In 1327, he captured the castles of Olvera, Pruna, and Torre Alhaquime. In 1330, a second expedition was mounted to attack the castle of Teba, twenty five miles east of Olvera and a key fortification in the defences of Malaga. Alfonso established his headquarters at Cordoba and sent word to his nobles and knights to concentrate there. A contingent of five hundred knights was also sent by the King of Portugal. By the end of July Alfonso was preparing to march down the Roman road to Ecija where an advance base was to be set up.  Scottish knights errant  In 1329, as Robert Bruce, King of Scots, lay dying he made one last request of his friend and lieutenant, Sir James Douglas. The King charged that, after his death, Sir James should take his embalmed heart and bear it with him on crusade, thus fulfilling the pledge that Bruce had been unable to honour in his lifetime. The chronicler Jean le Bel tells that Bruce wanted his heart taken to the Holy Land and presented at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. The poet John Barbour says merely that Bruce wished his heart to be carried in battle against 'God's foes.' The projected campaign in Spain offered Sir James the ideal opportunity for the latter. In the spring of 1330, armed with a safe conduct from Edward III of England and a letter of recommendation to King Alfonso XI of Castile, Douglas set off from Berwick Barbour (Duncan), Book 20, l. 318 and sailed first to Sluys in Flanders. Here, according to the contemporary Walloon chronicler Jean Le Bel, Douglas' company consisted of one knight banneret, six ordinary knights and twenty esquires.Le Bel, Vol I, Ch.16 It is not clear whether the knight banneret was Sir James himself. Other knights named by the Scottish poet John Barbour included Sir William de Keith, Sir William de St. Clair of Rosslyn and the brothers Sir Robert Logan of Restalrig and Sir Walter Logan.Barbour (Duncan), Book 20, ll. 480-484 Others alleged at one time or another to have accompanied Douglas are John de St. Clair, younger brother of Sir William, Sir Simon Lockhart of Lee, Sir Kenneth Moir, William Borthwick, Sir Alan Cathcart and Sir Robert de Glen but evidence is lacking. There appears to be no historical basis for claims that any of these men were connected with the Order of the Knights Templar, dissolved by Pope Clement V in 1312, eighteen years previously. Le Bel relates that the Scots party remained at Sluys for twelve days, with Douglas holding court on board ship as if the late king were present.LeBel, Vol I, Ch 16 Sir James' main purpose, according to Le Bel, was to publicise his mission and find out if other knights were interested in joining the Scots expedition to the Holy Land. It may be Douglas was awaiting news of the planned crusade against Granada and on learning that, despite the withdrawal of his allies, King Alfonso still intended to go to war, he finally set sail for Spain. After a stormy passage, the party arrived at the mouth of the Guadalquivir, probably sometime in late June, and disembarked upstream at Seville.Barbour (Duncan), ll. 332-340  March to Teba  Douglas presented his credentials to Alfonso XI. According to John Barbour, the King offered Douglas riches, fine horses, and armour. Sir James declined these gifts, declaring that he and his men were prepared to offer their arms in the service of the king as humble pilgrims, seeking absolution for their sins. Alfonso accepted and assigned experienced soldiers, accustomed to the style of fighting on the Frontera, as advisors to Douglas and his fellow knights. While the Scots rested after their long voyage and waited for the expedition to depart, many foreign knights who had come to seek service with Alfonso of Castile paid their respects to Douglas, including a number of Englishmen who were particularly keen to meet the man who until recently had been their nemesis.Barbour (Duncan), Book 20, ll. 348-372 Alfonso formed up his army for the advance south. Barbour claims that Douglas was given command of the lead division, the 'vaward' or vanguard. It may be more likely that he was put in charge of all the foreign knights in the Castilian army.Barbour (Duncan), Book 20, ll. 410-412 The Christian host, its size unknown, marched to Ecija then to Osuna on the frontier. Once across the border, Alfonso continued south to the meadows of Almargen, five miles west of Teba, from where he advanced to set up camp and invest the fortress,Gran Cronica, Ch. CIV (Catalán) While King Alfonso waited for his siege engines to come up from Ecija, a Granadan relief force was forming in Malaga. This was under the command of Uthman ibn Abi al-Ula, a Berber noble fighting in the service of the sultans of Granada, who set off with six thousand cavalry and an unknown number of infantry to the relief of Teba. Marching up the Guadalhorce valley, Uthman's force crossed over into the valley of the river Turón where they pitched camp between Ardales castle and the supporting fortress of Turón, ten miles south of Teba.Gran Cronica, Ch. CV (Catalán)  The siege  The Christian army was hampered by limited access to water and it was necessary daily to drive their livestock out of camp and down to Río Guadalteba, the river flowing two miles south of the castle. Uthman quickly identified this vulnerability and sent raiding parties to disrupt the watering details. Alfonso in turn sent out patrols to hold them off and there were frequent skirmishes between the two sides. It is possible that Sir James Douglas was killed in one of these encounters. The 'Gran Cronica de Alfonso XI' refers to a confrontation on the river that resulted in the death of \\"a foreign count... through his own error\\", although some commentators prefer to think Douglas died in a more decisive encounter some days later.Gran Cronica, Ch. XV (Catalán) Alfonso had other problems. The five hundred Portuguese knights declared their term of service was about to expire and withdrew. Meanwhile, the siege engines arrived at Teba and operations began to open a breach in the walls of the castle. One night the garrison of Teba sallied out to attack the siege lines and retired leaving a siege tower in flames. Uthman too faced difficulties. He had concluded he could not defeat the Christians in open battle and so devised a stratagem to force Alfonso to abandon the siege.Gran Cronica, Ch. XVI,XVII (Catalán)  The battle  Under cover of darkness, three thousand Moorish cavalry prepared to make a diversionary attack across the river while Uthman took another three thousand upstream to make a flank attack on Alfonso's camp. At dawn, Uthman's river contingent occupied the watering grounds of the Guadalteba. Alfonso, however, having been warned by his scouts of the enemy's movements, kept the main force of his army in camp while he sent Don Pedro Fernández de Castro with troops to check the assault developing on the river. Some argue that Douglas and his contingent must have been part of this reinforcement. With battle joined, Uthman believed that his ruse was working and, emerging from the valley where he and his men had been concealed, rode up to attack the Christian camp from the west. When he reached the col overlooking the Almargen valley he saw the camp bristling with Alfonso's men armed and ready while at the same time saw his men on the river downstream beginning to fall back. He instantly abandoned the attack and rode back to support his right wing but arrived only in time to join in the general retreat.Gran Cronica, Ch. XVII (Catalán) Memorial to Sir James Douglas in the town of Teba The Moors on the river had been unable, or reluctant, to resist the Christian counter-attack. When Alfonso, having seen Uthman withdraw, sent Rodrigo Álvarez de las Asturias with a further 2,000 men to intervene, the Granadan retreat turned into a rout. John Barbour, in his description of Douglas' last battle, describes a similar rout, with Douglas and his contingent pursuing the fleeing enemy closely. There is, however, no mention of the siege of Teba in Barbour's account, which describes the Christian army advancing from Seville to repel an invasion from Morocco. According to Barbour, Sir James outruns the rest of his men and finds himself far out in front with only ten or so followers. Too late, he turns back to rejoin the main body. The agile Moorish cavalry see their opportunity, rally, and counter-attack. In the running fight that follows, Douglas sees Sir William St.Clair surrounded by a body of Moors, trying to fight his way free. With the few knights still with him, Douglas rides to the rescue but all are killed, including Sir William St.Clair and the brothers Sir Robert and Sir Walter Logan.Barbour (Duncan) Book 20, ll.441-490 The Castilian sources do not mention any Moorish counter-attacks during the pursuit, despite the Moors' notorious capacity for turning on unwary pursuers.  Aftermath  The Castilian forces pursued the Moorish army back to their camp in the Turon valley. The chance of a more comprehensive victory was lost when the Christians stopped to loot the enemy tents and baggage. Despite further skirmishes, Uthman made no further attempt to raise the siege and shortly afterwards the garrison of Teba surrendered. The aged Berber general died some weeks later. Barbour tells how Douglas' body, together with the casket containing the embalmed heart of Bruce, were recovered after the battle. His bones, the flesh boiled off them, and the casket were taken back to Scotland by Douglas' surviving companions. The bones were buried at St Bride's Kirk, at Douglas, South Lanarkshire.Barbour (Duncan), Book 20, ll. 479-600 The battle was not decisive. While Teba remained secure in Castilian hands, the Guadalteba and Turon valleys continued to be debatable land for the next hundred and fifty years. However, in response to Alfonso XI's victories of 1327–1330, the Marinid sultan of Morocco Abu Hasan sent forces in support of Muhammad IV to re-establish control of the Straits. Gibraltar was re-captured from the Christians in 1333 but Abu Hasan's attempt to re-take Tarifa in 1340 led to his disastrous defeat by allied Christian forces at Rio Salado. This was the last intervention by North African powers in the defence of Muslim Granada.  References   Bibliography  *Jean Le Bel Chronique de Jean Le Bel ed.

A native of Vermont, he settled in the Washington Territory after it was created in 1853 and served in the legislature of that territory and on the Washington Supreme Court. Later he returned to Oregon and settled in Portland. Early life Strong was born on July 15, 1817 in St. Albans, Vermont to Laura Strong and Henry Pierce Strong, a preacher.Strong, Harry. The Adventures of a Pioneer Judge & His Family. COLUMBIA Magazine: Winter 2002-03. Vol. 16, No. 4. Retrieved on February 1, 2008. He earned his primary education near the town of Rushville, New York, before entering Yale College (now university) at the age of seventeen.Corning, Howard M. Dictionary of Oregon History. Binfords & Mort Publishing, 1956. William graduated from Yale in 1838 and then began teaching while also studying law. At Yale he graduated with honors and then after graduation served as a principal at a school in Ithaca, New York. There in 1840 he married Lucretia Robinson, and the couple would have six children together. Then in 1840 he passed the bar and started practicing law in Cleveland, Ohio where the couple remained until 1849. Political career In August 1850 William Strong arrived in the Oregon Territory after being appointed by President Taylor to the Oregon Supreme Court the previous year. The trip to Oregon for the family started aboard the ship Supply that took them around Cape Horn on the southern tip of South America to San Francisco, California where they transferred to a sloop-of-war vessel named the Falmouth that delivered them to Astoria, Oregon on August 13. On the trip were also Strong's wife and two children, the new secretary for the territory Edward D. Hamilton, and the new governor John P. Gaines, but Strong' oldest son Frederick died after contracting Yellow Fever in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The Strong family would then settle on a farm in Cathlamet on the Columbia River where William would file a land claim under the Donation Land Claim Act on September 27. Once in Oregon, Strong served on the supreme court from 1850 to 1853.Oregon Blue Book: Elections Process and History. Oregon Secretary of State. Retrieved on February 1, 2008. His assigned district was the third, which covers all of modern Washington state where he served as a circuit riding trial level judge and as an appeals level justice. He replaced Peter H. Burnett who had served under the provisional government, but declined to serve on the territorial court. Strong's first trial was held on November 12, 1850 in Lewis County near present-day Chehalis, Washington at the home of John Jackson. His brother James served as William's court clerk while riding circuit. His annual salary for his services was $2,000.Court History. Clark County. Retrieved on February 1, 2008. In 1853, when Washington Territory was formed out of the northern portion of the Oregon Territory, Strong became the sole judge in the territory until his term ended in November. That November he left the bench and returned to farming at Cathlamet. William Strong then served as a surveyor of a large section of land in the territory. Next on February 27, 1854, Washington Territory Governor Isaac Stevens appointed Strong, along with Edward Lander and Victor Monroe, to help write the new territory's laws. After this Stevens then asked Strong to serve as his legal adviser. Next, 1855 when war with the Native Americans broke out he joined the militia and was assigned to Fort Vancouver as a commander of a company of cavalry. While in command he and his troops were ordered out to return the Cowlitz tribe to the protection of the fort, as the tribe was sequestered at the fort to protect them from possible white violence during the Yakima Wars. The Cowlitz had fled after fearing an American attack after a false rumor had spread that the Cowlitz were preparing to attack American settlements. Strong was able to negotiate with the tribe and bring them back, but his men fired shots in the air in celebration that was misconstrued by nearby listeners as an actual engagement. This incident is how Battle Ground, Washington received its name. In 1856, Strong was elected to the territorial Washington House of Representatives as a Democrat, as the Whig Party he had previously been associated with was no longer a relevant political entity.Scott, H.W. History of Portland, Oregon: with illustrations and biographical sketches of prominent citizens and pioneers. D. Mason & Co., 1890. While in the house he represented Wahkiakum County and made an unsuccessful bid for Congress. Strong served in the territorial legislature until 1858 when he was appointed to the Washington Supreme Court, serving until 1861. President James Buchanan appointed him to the post on the high court of the Washington Territory. Personal life On the farm at Cathlamet the family built a log cabin in early 1851, and then a frame house that was completed in March 1853. At the farm Judge Strong purchased a Native American girl named Wahkeenah as a slave to assist his wife with household tasks. Once retired from public service, in December 1862 the Strong family moved to Portland, Oregon where William returned to private law practice. There he served as general counsel for the Oregon Steam Navigation Company until 1879 when the company was sold. Then in 1883 he retired from the legal profession. Eventually his sons took over his legal practice and William Strong died on April 10, 1887 in Portland.

In the 1950s, he was a member of the Action Group and subsequently became the minister for local government and Justice. He was the president of the Nigerian Bar Association in 1959, the association is the leading body for lawyers in the country. He left politics in the 1960s, as a result of the political crisis in the Western Region of Nigeria. Throughout his career, he was involved in some memorable and important court cases, such as Lakanmi vs the Western Government of Nigeria, which set the precedent that a military government could not use its power to make laws that will appropriate an individuals property.The Man, His Life Max Amuchie. The Oloye Williams, himself a Yoruba chieftain, was also among a group of lawyers that represented the Oba of Lagos, Adeniji Adele, against challenges by the Nigerian National Democratic Party. The latter had previously gained solidarity and foundation from the ruling House of Docemo in Lagos. Early life Rotimi Williams was born on 16 December 1920 in Lagos. His older brother was Akintola Williams, born a year earlier, who became a distinguished Chartered Accountant. His father and uncle were both lawyers, and were called to the bar in 1927 and 1892 respectively. He entered primary school in the 1930s, at the Methodist Ologbowo School, then went to C.M.S Grammar School, Lagos for secondary education. Despite being given a full scholarship to study mechanical engineering at Yaba Higher College, he chose to become a lawyer. He earned his bachelor's degree in 1942 and was called to the bar at the Gray's Inn, London in 1943. He set up the first indigenous Nigerian law firm in 1948 with Chief Remilekun Fani-Kayode and Chief Bode Thomas.

Sklar, Nigerian Political Parties: Power in an Emergent African Nation, Africa World Press, 2004. p. 273. . He rose to become the movement's general secretary. However, the movement was soon embroiled in a crisis which dented its political support among the Nigerian masses. When the movement began to fade politically, he was one of the educated members of the Nigerian political class who joined the Action Group. He was the group's legal adviser in the early 1950s. He had previously entered the Western region's House of Chiefs by virtue of his holding of the chieftaincy title of the Apesin of Itoko in Egbaland. He later also served as a member of that region's privy council. He was elected into the Lagos Town Council in 1953 and was subsequently made chairman of the council. In 1957, he became the Western Region's Attorney General, the first Nigerian to be an attorney general. He was made Queen's Counsel in 1958, another first for him, as he was one of the first two Nigerians to be made one. Constitutional Conference In 18 October 1975, Rotimi Williams became the chairman of the Constitutional Drafting Committee. The body was formed to present a draft constitution to be approved by the military administration of Obasanjo. He led the convention to present an agenda for broad coalition building across ethnic and regional lines. The body pushed for presidential winners to have at least 25% of the total votes cast in two thirds of the nineteen states in Nigeria and that each of the 19 states of the federation should have a minister representing them.

The painting portrays three human heads, each facing in a different direction, above three animal heads (from left to right, a wolf, a lion and a dog). It is in the National Gallery, London. The painting is usually interpreted as operating on a number of levels. At the first level, the different ages of the three human heads represent the three ages of man (from left to right: old age, maturity and youth), a subject that Titian had depicted 50 years earlier in his The Three Ages of Man. The different directions in which they are facing reflect a second, wider concept of time itself as having a past, present and future. This theme is repeated in the animal heads: an animal with three heads (wolf, lion, dog) to represent the passage of time (past, present, future) is associated with Serapis in Macrobius's Saturnalia, and associated with Apollo by Petrarch, and the iconography is repeated for example in the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili of Francesco Colonna (1499), the Hieroglyphica of Pierio Valeriano (1556), and the Iconologia of Cesare Ripa (1643). The third level, from which the painting has acquired its present name, is suggested by a barely visible inscription above the portraits: (Latin for \\"from the experience of the past, the present acts prudently, lest it spoil future actions\\".) It has been argued that the human faces are actual portraits of the aged Titian, his son Orazio, and his young nephew, Marco Vecellio, who, like Orazio, lived and worked with Titian. Erwin Panofsky, in his classic exposition, suggests that the painting is specifically associated with the negotiations associated with the passing on of Titian's property to the younger generations, in the light of his approaching death. The painting therefore acts as a visual counsel to the three generations to act prudently in the administration of the inheritance. Nicholas Penny is, however, highly sceptical of this, and points out discrepancies between the human heads and other evidence of the individuals' appearance. He doubts it was a personal project of any sort and feels that is \\"surely more likely that the painting was commissioned\\". Others are also of the opinion that the three heads are not Titian and his family. One reason is that there are no portraits of Oazio or Marco so confirmation that the figures are them is difficult. More recently the painting has been explained in quite different ways. Instead of an allegory of prudence, it has been seen as an allegory about sin and penitence. On this view, it amounts to an admission by Titian that his failure to act prudently in his youth and middle age has condemned him to lead a regretful old age. At the other extreme, the painting has been explained as asserting that the prudence which comes with experience and old age is an essential aspect of artistic discrimination and judgement. On this interpretation, the painting therefore acts as a rebuttal of the view that old age is the enemy of artistic achievement. On a more general level, the painting's depiction of Titian with his assistants Orazio and Marco is also intended as a defence of the prudence of the continuity of the Venetian workshop tradition. The painting was presented to the National Gallery in 1966 by the art dealer David Koetser and his wife Betty.

Established in 1933, the association is the only accrediting body for small animal hospitals in the U.S. and Canada. The association develops benchmarks of excellence, business practice standards, publications and educational programs. Any veterinary hospital can join AAHA as a member, but must then pass an evaluation in order to receive AAHA accreditation. History The American Animal Hospital Association was founded by seven leaders of the veterinary profession in 1933. From its inception, AAHA focused on promoting high-quality standards for the rapidly evolving sector of small animal private practice through accreditation and other initiatives. The 1960s saw the establishment of an organization staff and normalization of many of the policies and processes AAHA adheres to today. The first paid practice consultants were hired, and AAHA grew into a more professionally managed organization. Rapid growth in membership and member services occurred in the 1960s and early 1970s with the development of additional education programs and publications for veterinary professionals. Significant change occurred in the early- to mid-1980s, when AAHA added services in the area of veterinary practice management and relocated from Indiana to Denver, Colo. Today AAHA claims to be known internationally for professional development, hospital accreditation standards, and educational programs. The purpose of the American Animal Hospital Association is to: * Enhance the abilities of veterinarians to provide quality medical care to companion animals * Enable veterinarians to successfully conduct their practices and maintain their facilities with high standards of excellence * Meet the public's needs as they relate to the delivery of small animal veterinary medicine AAHA Accreditation Unlike human hospitals, veterinary hospitals are not required to be accredited. Accredited hospitals are the only hospitals in the U.S. and Canada that choose to be evaluated on approximately 900 quality standards that go above and beyond basic state regulations, ranging from patient care and pain management to staff training and advanced diagnostic services. A complete list of accredited hospitals in the U.S. and Canada can be found using the AAHA hospital locator tool. To become AAHA- accredited, practices undergo a rigorous evaluation process to ensure they meet the AAHA Standards of Accreditation, which include the areas of: Patient care, diagnostic imaging, laboratory, pain management, pharmacy, safety, surgery, client service, anesthesia, contagious disease, continuing education, dentistry, examination facilities, medical records, leadership and emergency/urgent care. To maintain accredited status, hospitals undergo comprehensive on-site evaluations every three years, which ensures that hospitals are compliant with the Association's mandatory standards. Because the accreditation process is so thorough and rigorous, some states are beginning to accept AAHA accreditation in lieu of state inspections. Alabama was the first state in the United States to accept AAHA accreditation in place of a state inspection by the State Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners. The Alabama decision has shown that the 900-plus standards of accreditation set a high standard for how animal hospitals should be run. Veterinary specialty hospitals can become accredited as a \\"Referral\\" practice. AAHA-accredited referral practices are required to have a board-certified veterinarian on staff for each specialty within the clinic. For example, a hospital accredited as a surgery referral and also an oncology referral, must have a board- certified surgeon and a board-certified oncologist on staff. Currently, approximately 225 veterinary referral practices are accredited by AAHA. Initiatives AAHA Universal Pet Microchip Lookup Tool The AAHA Universal Pet Microchip Lookup Tool is an internet-based application that enables veterinarians, humane organizations and pet owners to serve various participating pet recovery service registries and identify those registries on which a particular microchip is registered. The tool was developed to help alleviate the guesswork for veterinary hospitals, animal control facilities and shelter staff members by searching the databases of companies that elect to participate in the program. The tool works by checking the databases of the participating pet recovery service registries to determine which has registration available for a microchip. Once a microchip identification number is entered into the tool, a list of all the registries with microchip registration information available, along with the registries' contact information, appears in chronological order with the registry with the most recent update appearing first. While the tool will not return the pet owner information contained in the registries' databases, it will identify which registries should be contacted when a lost pet is scanned and a microchip is found. Guidelines AAHA produces guidelines developed by teams of veterinary experts that provide recommendations to improve the quality of pet health care in a veterinary practice. Guidelines are reviewed periodically to ensure that they are accurate and up-to-date with leading data and trends in the veterinary profession. The AAHA Guidelines include: * AAHA Anesthesia Guidelines for Dogs and Cats * AAHA Canine Life Stage Guidelines * AAHA Canine Vaccination Guidelines * AAHA Dental Care Guidelines for Dogs and Cats * AAHA Diabetes Management Guidelines for Dogs and Cats * AAFP/AAHA Feline Life Stage Guidelines * AAHA Fluid Therapy Guidelines for Dogs and Cats * AAHA Mentoring Guidelines * AAHA Nutritional Assessment Guidelines for Dogs and Cats * AAHA/AVMA Preventive Healthcare Guidelines * AAHA/AAFP Pain Management Guidelines for Dogs and Cats * AAHA Referral Guidelines * AAHA Senior Care Guidelines for Dogs and Cats * Basic Guidelines of Judicious Therapeutic Use of Antimicrobials Position statements The AAHA Board of Directors have adopted position statements on many pet health and animal welfare issues.

The group is composed of more than 20 leading veterinary associations and animal health companies and is committed to combating the increasing prevalence of serious diseases and the declining health of pets. Research has shown that even though the pet population is increasing, visits to veterinary hospitals have declined every year for nearly a decade. Partners for Healthy Pets works to ensure that pets receive the preventive healthcare they deserve through regular visits to a veterinarian. Experts agree that the decrease in regular visits can lead to an increase in preventable and treatable illnesses in dogs and cats. This includes diabetes, ear infections, and dental disease. A 2011 survey of veterinary professionals revealed that declining pet healthcare visits are recognized as a problem and identified communication issues and the education of the value of preventive healthcare to pet owners as factors that impact the downturn. Pet Nutrition Alliance The Pet Nutrition Alliance (PNA) was created by veterinary organizations including the American Animal Hospital Association, the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), the World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA) and others to help raise awareness about the importance of proper pet nutrition, and the value of nutritional assessments for every pet, every time. The PNA is a response to the education gap in providing nutritional assessments and proper nutrition for pets. With 55% of U.S. dogs and cats overweight in the United States (according to a 2012 survey by the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention), proper nutrition is more important now than ever before. With the rise of obesity, dogs and cats are at an increased risk for weight-related disorders such as diabetes, osteoarthritis, hypertension, and many cancers. Veterinary Education AAHA is recognized as a leading provider of staff training and continuing education for the veterinary industry. AAHA has educational programs for virtually every veterinary team member, including veterinarians, practice owners, practice managers, veterinary technicians, veterinary assistants and front-office staff members. The AAHA conference was the first veterinary conference to host live- streaming surgeries for veterinary professionals. The AAHA Yearly Conference is the only conference that focuses exclusively on companion animal care. It has been one of the most respected forums for the sharing of both scientific and management knowledge in the veterinary profession since 1934.

Hainich covers an area of around 160 km² (61,8 sq mi), of which, since 31 December 1997, half has been designated as Hainich National Park. The highest point in Hainich is Alte Berg at 1621 ft (494 m). The Mühlhäuser Stadtwald in the northern part of Hainich is the largest municipal forest in Thuringia. The landmark of Hainich is Betteleiche, a 600-year-old common oak at Ihlefeld.  Geography  Hainich is 18,6 mls (30 km) long from north to south and 2,5 to 5 mls (4 to 8 km) broad from west to east. The western edge of Hainich leads to Lempertsbach and Lauterbach valley and is steeper than the eastern slope. In the northwest you can find high rocks like Sommerstein and Winterstein. The reason for the steeper slopes in western Hainich is the Saalfeld-Gotha-Eichenberg fault. Because of limestone the Hainich creeks are dry for the most time of the year. In the east of Hainich water rises up in strong sources like Kainspring or Popperöder Quelle. So Hainich is a karst region.  Communities  The following communities take part of Hainich: Eigenrieden, Heyerode, Hallungen, Nazza, Mihla, Lauterbach, Bischofroda, Berka v.d Hainich, Behringen, Reichenbach, Craula, Zimmern, Alterstedt, Weberstedt, Mülverstedt, Flarchheim, Kammerforst, Oppershausen, Langula, Niederdorla, Oberdorla, Mühlhausen.  Geology  The geological surface of Hainich is Middle Triassic limestone so called Muschelkalk.  Climate  The annual average precipitation at Hainich ridge is as 31.5 in (800 mm). The average temperature is 43,7 °F (6,5 °C). The lower parts in the east are drier and warmer. The next commercial weather station is near Weberstedt.  Ecology  Hainich contains the largest coherent area of deciduous trees in Germany. The main trees are beech, mixed with ash, maple, tilia cordata, hornbeam and chequer tree (Sorbus torminalis). Hainich is also known as an important habitat for European wildcat (Felis silvestris). Central parts of Hainich National Park, so Weberstedt and Schöndorf forest, are rich on dead wood. That's the reason for the incidence of 522 beetles with their habitat only in wood. Biologists found from 1992 to 2008 altogether 2080 of different beetles in Hainich National Park.Weigel, A. & Apel, W. 2011. Käfer im Nationalpark Hainich. Gotha  Forestry  The north of Hainich is managed by the forestry service in Creuzburg. The forests belong to the municipality of Mühlhausen and to the cooperatives of Oberdorla, Niederdorla, Langula and Kammerforst. Selective tree cutting and uneven-aged management are dominant in the beech forests. Sycamore maple and Chequer tree are bringing the best yield. In former times oaks and hornbeam were favorised.  Tourism  A traditional trail is Rennstieg. It is 19,5 mls (31,3 km) long and leads from Eigenrieden in the north to Behringen in the south across Hainich. On 26 August 2005 nearby Thiemsburg forester's house in the southeast of Hainich one of the largest tree canopy paths was declared to be open. It is the most important institution for environmental education in Thuringia and a platform for ecological research in the treetop region of a broadleaf forest. An attraction in Mühlhäuser Stadtwald are the Redwood trees (Sequoiadendron giganteum) from 1884. They are the largest ones in Thuringia. A trail from Weißes Haus on the eastern edge of Hainich leads to this site. Another curious tree, also in Mühlhäuser Stadtwald, is Corpusbuche a 400-year-old hornbeam.

In the 1980s and 1990s, he promoted legislation that funded an expansion of the ARPANET, allowing greater public access, and helping to develop the Internet. Congressional work and Gore Bill Gore had been involved with computers since the 1970s, first as a Congressman and later as Senator and Vice President, where he was a \\"genuine nerd, with a geek reputation running back to his day as a futurist Atari Democrat in the House. Before computers were comprehensible ... Gore struggled to explain artificial intelligence and fiber-optic networks to sleepy colleagues.\\" According to Campbell-Kelly and Aspray (Computer: A History of the Information Machine), up until the early 1990s public usage of the Internet was limited and the \\"problem of giving ordinary Americans network access had excited Senator Al Gore since the late 1970s.\\"Campbell-Kelly and Aspray (1996).Computer: A History of the Information Machine. New York: BasicBooks, 298 Of Gore's involvement in the then-developing Internet while in Congress, Internet pioneers Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn have also noted that, 24 Jun 1986: Albert Gore introduced S 2594 Supercomputer Network Study Act of 1986Roads and Crossroads of Internet History by Gregory Gromov As a Senator, Gore began to craft the High Performance Computing and Communication Act of 1991 (commonly referred to as \\"The Gore Bill\\") after hearing the 1988 report Toward a National Research Network submitted to Congress by a group chaired by UCLA professor of computer science, Leonard Kleinrock, one of the central creators of the ARPANET (the ARPANET, first deployed by Kleinrock and others in 1969, is the predecessor of the Internet). Indeed, Kleinrock would later credit both Gore and the Gore Bill as a critical moment in Internet history: The bill was passed on Dec. 9, 1991 and led to the National Information Infrastructure (NII) which Gore referred to as the \\"information superhighway\\". President George H. W. Bush predicted that the bill would help \\"unlock the secrets of DNA,\\" open up foreign markets to free trade, and a promise of cooperation between government, academia, and industry. Prior to its passage, Gore discussed the basics of the bill in an article for the September 1991 issue of Scientific American entitled Scientific American presents the September 1991 Single Copy Issue: Communications, Computers, and Networks. His essay, \\"Infrastructure for the Global Village\\", commented on the lack of network access described above and argued: \\"Rather than holding back, the U.S. should lead by building the information infrastructure, essential if all Americans are to gain access to this transforming technology\\"Gore, Al (1991). \\"Infrastructure for the Global Village\\"Scientific American presents the September 1991 Single Copy Issue: Communications, Computers, and Networks, 150\\"...high speed networks must be built that tie together millions of computers, providing capabilities that we cannot even imagine.\\"Gore, Al (1991). \\"Infrastructure for the Global Village\\" Scientific American presents the September 1991 Single Copy Issue: Communications, Computers, and Networks, 152 Mosaic Perhaps one of the most important results of the Gore Bill was the development of Mosaic in 1993. This World Wide Web browser is credited by most scholars as beginning the Internet boom of the 1990s: > Gore's legislation also helped fund the National Center for Supercomputing > Applications at the University of Illinois, where a team of programmers, > including Netscape founder Marc Andreessen, created the Mosaic Web browser, > the commercial Internet's technological springboard. 'If it had been left to > private industry, it wouldn't have happened,' Andreessen says of Gore's > bill, 'at least, not until years later.' Gore and the Information Superhighway As Vice President, Gore promoted the development of what he referred to as the Information Superhighway. This was discussed in detail a few days after winning the election in November 1992 in The New York Times article \\"Clinton to Promote High Technology, With Gore in Charge.\\" They planned to finance research \\"that will flood the economy with innovative goods and services, lifting the general level of prosperity and strengthening American industry.\\" Specifically, they were aiming to fund the development of \\"robotics, smart roads, biotechnology, machine tools, magnetic- levitation trains, fiber-optic communications, and national computer networks. Also earmarked are a raft of basic technologies like digital imaging and data storage.\\" These initiatives were met with some skepticism from critics who claimed that \\"the initiative is likely to backfire, bloating Congressional pork, and creating whole new categories of Federal waste.\\" These initiatives were outlined in the report Technology for America's Economic Growth. In September 1993, they released a report calling for the creation of a \\"nationwide information superhighway,\\" which would primarily be built by private industry. Gary Stix commented on these initiatives a few months prior in his May 1993 article for Scientific American, \\"Gigabit Gestalt: Clinton and Gore embrace an activist technology policy.\\" Stix described them as a \\"distinct statement about where the new administration stands on the matter of technology ... Gone is the ambivalence or outright hostility toward government involvement in little beyond basic science. Although Gore is most famous for his political career and environmental work, he is also noted for his creation of the internet.\\" Campbell-Kelly and Aspray further note in Computer: A History of the Information Machine: > In the early 1990s the Internet was big news ... In the fall of 1990, there > were just 313,000 computers on the Internet; by 1996, there were close to 10 > million. The networking idea became politicized during the 1992 Clinton-Gore > election campaign, where the rhetoric of the information highway captured > the public imagination. On taking office in 1993, the new administration set > in place a range of government initiatives for a National Information > Infrastructure aimed at ensuring that all American citizens ultimately gain > access to the new networks.Campbell-Kelly and Aspray (1996). Computer: A > History of the Information Machine. New York: BasicBooks, 283 These initiatives were discussed in a number of venues. Howard Rheingold argued in the 1994 afterword to his noted text, The Virtual Community: Homesteading on the Electronic Frontier, that these initiatives played a critical role in the development of digital technology, stating that, \\"Two powerful forces drove the rapid emergence of the superhighway notion in 1994 .... The second driving force behind the superhighway idea continued to be Vice-President Gore.\\" In addition, Clinton and Gore submitted the report, Science in the National Interest in 1994, which further outlined their plans to develop science and technology in the United States. Gore also discussed these plans in speeches that he made at The Superhighway Summit at UCLA and for the International Telecommunications Union. On January 13, 1994 Gore \\"became the first U.S. vice president to hold a live interactive news conference on an international computer network\\". Gore was also asked to write the foreword to the 1993 internet guide, The Internet Companion: A Beginner's Guide to Global Networking (1st edition) by Tracy LaQuey. In the foreword, he stated the following: > Since I first became interested in high-speed networking almost seventeen > years ago, there have been many major advances both in the technology and in > public awareness. Articles on high-speed networks are commonplace in major > newspapers and in news magazines. In contrast, when as a House member in the > early 1980s, I called for creation of a national network of \\"information > superhighways,\\" the only people interested were the manufacturers of optical > fiber. Back then, of course, high-speed meant 56,000 bits per second. Today > we are building a national information infrastructure that will carry > billions of bits of data per second, serve thousands of users > simultaneously, and transmit not only electronic mail and data files but > voice and video as well. The Clinton-Gore administration launched the first official White House website on 21 October 1994. It would be followed by three more versions, resulting in the final edition launched in 2000. The White House website was part of a general movement by this administration towards web-based communication: \\"Clinton and Gore were responsible for pressing almost all federal agencies, the U.S. court system, and the U.S. military onto the Internet, thus opening up America's government to more of America's citizens than ever before. On 17 July 1996. President Clinton issued Executive Order 13011 – Federal Information Technology, ordering the heads of all federal agencies to fully utilize information technology to make the information of the agency easily accessible to the public.\\" The Clipper Chip, which \\"Clinton inherited from a multi-year National Security Agency effort,\\" was a method of hardware encryption with a government backdoor. In 1994, Vice President Gore issued a memo on the topic of encryption, which stated that under a new policy the White House would \\"provide better encryption to individuals and businesses while ensuring that the needs of law enforcement and national security are met. Encryption is a law and order issue, since it can be used by criminals to thwart wiretaps and avoid detection and prosecution.\\"STATEMENT OF THE VICE PRESIDENT Another initiative proposed a software-based key escrow system, in which keys to all encrypted data and communications would reside with a trusted third party. Since the government was seen as possibly having a need to access encrypted data originating in other countries, the pressure to establish such a system was worldwide.Commercial Policy These policies met with strong opposition from civil liberty groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union and the Electronic Privacy Information Center, scientific groups such as the National Research Council,Press release leading cryptographers,The Risks of Key Recovery, Key Escrow, & Trusted Third Party Encryption and the European Commission.\\"Europeans Reject U.S. Plan On Electronic Cryptography\\" All three encryption initiatives thus failed to gain widespread acceptance by consumers or support from the industry.The Clipper Chip The ability of a proposal such as the Clipper Chip to meet the stated goals, especially that of enabling better encryption to individuals, was disputed by a number of experts.Crypto Experts Letter With this resistance and lack of industry support, the Clipper Chip and key escrow initiatives were abandoned by 1996.Rendering Unto CESA President Bill Clinton installing computer cables with Vice President Al Gore on NetDay at Ygnacio Valley High School in Concord, CA. March 9, 1996. Gore had discussed his concerns with computer technology and levels of access in his 1994 article, \\"No More Information Have and Have Nots.\\" He was particularly interested in implementing measures, which would grant all children access to the Internet, stating: Gore had a chance to fulfill this promise when he and President Clinton participated in John Gage's NetDay'96 on March 9, 1996. Clinton and Gore spent the day at Ygnacio Valley High School, as part of the drive to connect California public schools to the Internet. In a speech given at YVH, Clinton stated that he was excited to see that his challenge the previous September to \\"Californians to connect at least 20 percent of your schools to the Information Superhighway by the end of this school year\\" was met. Clinton also described this event as part of a time of \\"absolutely astonishing transformation; a moment of great possibility. All of you know that the information and technology explosion will offer to you and to the young people of the future more opportunities and challenges than any generation of Americans has ever seen.\\" In a prepared statement, Gore added that NetDay was part of one of the major goals of the Clinton administration, which was \\"to give every child in America access to high quality educational technology by the dawn of the new century.\\" Gore also stated that the administration planned \\"to connect every classroom to the Internet by the year 2000.\\" On April 28, 1998, Gore honored numerous volunteers who had been involved with NetDay and \\"who helped connect students to the Internet in 700 of the poorest schools in the country\\" via \\"an interactive online session with children across the country.\\" He also reinforced the impact of the Internet on the environment, education, and increased communication between people through his involvement with \\"the largest one-day online event\\" for that time, 24 Hours in Cyberspace. The event took place on 8 February 1996, and Second Lady Tipper Gore also participated, acting as one of the event's 150 photographers.Picture This:Tipper Gore, Photojournalist Gore contributed the introductory essay to the Earthwatch section of the website,Earthwatch: 24 Hours in Cyberspace arguing that: Gore was involved in a number of other projects related to digital technology. He expressed his concerns for online privacy through his 1998 \\"Electronic Bill of Rights\\" speech in which he stated: \\"We need an electronic bill of rights for this electronic age ... You should have the right to choose whether your personal information is disclosed.\\"VICE PRESIDENT GORE ANNOUNCES NEW STEPS TOWARD AN ELECTRONIC BILL OF RIGHTS He also began promoting a NASA satellite that would provide a constant view of Earth, marking the first time such an image would have been made since The Blue Marble photo from the 1972 Apollo 17 mission. The \\"Triana\\" satellite would have been permanently mounted in the L1 Lagrangian Point, 1.5 million km away. Gore also became associated with Digital Earth. Urban legend that Gore claims to have invented the Internet In a March 9, 1999, interview with CNN's Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer, Gore discussed the possibility of running for President in the 2000 election. In response to Wolf Blitzer's question: \\"Why should Democrats, looking at the Democratic nomination process, support you instead of Bill Bradley,\\" Gore responded: After this interview, Gore became the subject of controversy and ridicule when his statement \\"I took the initiative in creating the Internet\\" was widely quoted out of context. It was often misquoted by comedians and figures in American popular media who framed this statement as a claim that Gore believed he had personally invented the Internet. Gore's actual words, however, were widely reaffirmed by notable Internet pioneers, such as Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, who stated, \\"No one in public life has been more intellectually engaged in helping to create the climate for a thriving Internet than the Vice President.\\" Former UCLA professor of information studies Philip E. Agre and journalist Eric Boehlert argued that three articles in Wired News led to the creation of the widely spread urban legend that Gore claimed to have \\"invented the Internet,\\" which followed this interview. Jim Wilkinson, who at the time was working as congressman Dick Armey's spokesman, also helped sell the idea that Gore claimed to have \\"invented the internet.\\" Computer professionals and congressional colleagues argued against this characterization. Internet pioneers Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn stated that \\"we don't think, as some people have argued, that Gore intended to claim he 'invented' the Internet. Moreover, there is no question in our minds that while serving as Senator, Gore's initiatives had a significant and beneficial effect on the still-evolving Internet.\\" Cerf would also later state: \\"Al Gore had seen what happened with the National Interstate and Defense Highways Act of 1956, which his father introduced as a military bill. It was very powerful. Housing went up, suburban boom happened, everybody became mobile. Al was attuned to the power of networking much more than any of his elective colleagues. His initiatives led directly to the commercialization of the Internet. So he really does deserve credit.\\" Al Gore, Newt Gingrich, and President Bill Clinton in 1997. In a speech to the American Political Science Association, former Republican Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Newt Gingrich also stated: \\"In all fairness, it's something Gore had worked on a long time. Gore is not the Father of the Internet, but in all fairness, Gore is the person who, in the Congress, most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an Internet, and the truth is -- and I worked with him starting in 1978 when I got [to Congress], we were both part of a \\"futures group\\"—the fact is, in the Clinton administration, the world we had talked about in the '80s began to actually happen.\\"Atlanta Journal-Constitution: Al Gore in ‘Internet Hall of Fame’. April 24, 2012. Finally, Wolf Blitzer (who conducted the original 1999 interview) stated in 2008 that: Gore, himself, would later poke fun at the controversy. In 2000, while on the Late Show with David Letterman he read Letterman's Top 10 List (which for this show was called, \\"Top Ten Rejected Gore – Lieberman Campaign Slogans\\") to the audience. Number nine on the list was: \\"Remember, America, I gave you the Internet, and I can take it away!\\" A few years later in 2005, when Gore was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award \\"for three decades of contributions to the Internet\\" at the Webby Awards he joked in his acceptance speech (limited to five words according to Webby Awards rules): \\"Please don't recount this vote.\\" He was introduced by Vint Cerf who used the same format to joke: \\"We all invented the Internet.\\" Gore, who was then asked to add a few more words to his speech, stated: \\"It is time to reinvent the Internet for all of us to make it more robust and much more accessible and use it to reinvigorate our democracy.\\" Post-Vice Presidency Gore continued his involvement with the computer industry and new technologies after he left the White House in 2001. He is a member of the Board of Directors of Apple Inc. and a Senior Advisor to Google. Emmy and Current TV On May 4, 2004, INdTV Holdings, a company co-founded by Gore and Joel Hyatt, purchased cable news channel NewsWorld International from Vivendi Universal. The new network would not \\"be a liberal network, a Democratic network or a political network\\", Gore said, but would serve as an \\"independent voice\\" for a target audience of people between 18 and 34 \\"who want to learn about the world in a voice they recognize and a view they recognize as their own.\\"\\"Al Gore Buying Int'l News Channel\\". CBS News. May 4, 2005. The network was relaunched under the name Current TV on August 1, 2005. On September 16, 2007, Current TV won the Outstanding Creative Achievement in Interactive Television award at the 2007 Primetime Emmys59th Primetime Emmy Awards for its use of online technologies with television. In his acceptance speech, Gore stated, \\"we are trying to open up the television medium so that viewers can help to make television and join the conversation of democracy and reclaim American democracy by talking about the choices we have to make. More to come. Current.com. Next month.\\"2007 Primetime Emmys Acceptance Speech The Assault on Reason Gore's 2007 book, The Assault on Reason, is an analysis of what he calls the \\"emptying out of the marketplace of ideas\\" in civic discourse due to the influence of electronic media (especially television), and which endangers American democracy. However, Gore also expresses the belief that the Internet can revitalize and ultimately \\"redeem the integrity of representative democracy.\\"Gore, Al.

This subfamily represents about one-tenth of all loricariid species. It has been divided into two tribes, Hypoptopomatini and Otothyrini. However, in a 2005 analysis, Otothyrini was found to not be monophyletic, with its representatives comprising a paraphyletic group in relation to the tribe Hypoptopomatini. More recent phylogenetic evidence shows that Hypoptopomatini and Otothyrini, while each are monophyletic tribes, do not form a monophyletic subfamily, and therefore should each be recognized as their own individual subfamilies. Problematically, the most recent hypoptopomatine genera, Gymnotocinclus and Rhinolekos, were not classified in either of the tribes. Almost all species of Hypoptopomatinae have a diploid number of 2n = 54; this group is karyotypically very conserved. Hypoptopomatinae are distributed east of the Andes in South America from Venezuela to northern Argentina. Most of the hypoptopomatine species are usually found at or near the water surface, typically in close association with riverbank vegetation or some subsurface structure.

Which is now the main church of the wider city of Stoke-on-Trent. Name and dedication The dedication to St Peter ad Vincula means \\"Saint Peter in Chains\\". It is derived from the Basilica of San Pietro in Vincoli in Rome. The church was formally renamed Stoke Minster in 2005 in recognition of its role in the civic life of Stoke- on-Trent and North Staffordshire. The title \\"minster\\" is an honorific, sharing a common etymology with \\"monastery\\". History The first church on the site was built of timber in 670. It was replaced with a stone building in 805 which was extended over the centuries. The remains of this Anglo-Saxon and former collegiate church survive in the churchyard. The re-erected arches date from the 13th century when the chancel was rebuilt. Saxon evidence survives in the baptismal font rescued from use as a garden ornament and restored in 1932 for baptismal use in the church. The church is the burial place of several generations of Josiah Spode's family, as well as Josiah Wedgwood, who is also commemorated inside the church by a marble memorial tablet commissioned by his sons. The title of \\"Stoke Minster\\" was conferred on the church by The Rt Revd Jonathan Gledhill, Bishop of Lichfield, at a ceremony on 17 May 2005. Building James Trubshaw and Thomas Johnson (1794–1865) designed the present parish church. Building began in 1826 and the church was consecrated on 6 October 1830. In the church are ceramic memorials to many of the potters of the district and there is a modern memorial to the football player Sir Stanley Matthews. The west tower has a ring of 10 bells, all of which John Taylor & Co of Loughborough recast in 1971. The tower has also a clock with a single bell, which John Taylor & Co cast in 1888. The church has been a Grade II listed building since 2 October 1951. Organ The organ was built in 1899 by J. J. Binns of Bramley, Leeds, as a house organ for the master potter H. J. Johnson. Johnson gave the organ to the church in 1921 as a memorial to members of his family who died in World War I. It was installed, unchanged, on the west gallery. It was rebuilt with substantial changes by J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd in 1972. The specifications of the organ are recorded at the National Pipe Organ Register.

Arbid left Lebanon at the height of the civil war in 1987, at the age of 17,iniva Danielle Arbid Profile http://www.iniva.org/library/archive/people/a/arbid_danielle to study literature at a faculty of letters in Paris, France. She also studied journalism while working as a freelance. She directed her first short Raddem and the documentary Seule ave la guerre (1999). Having never studied film in school, Arbid says her inspiration comes from \\"art, photography, people in the street and of course film\\". Her first three Conversation de Salon I-III where featured at the Museum of Applied Arts in Vienna, Austria and received the Golden Leopard at the Locarno Film Festival. Interested in different narrative forms, her work alternates between; fiction, first person documentaries and video essays; with an experimentation of the intersecting of genres. She was one of the founding members of the Lebanese film festival Né à Beyrouth in 2001. Danielle Arbid directed \\"Beirut Hotel\\", TV-movie for ARTE aired during prime time. One of the channel’s most popular fiction broadcasts in 2012. In this interview given during the festival de Popoli in 2016, she said : \\"I want to be as close to my fictional characters as I am to those of my documentaries. I want to live parallel lives, not just tell stories; feel strong states of mind and sensations. My feature films, the way I perceive them, are like documentaries on my characters. I use a lot close-ups and long focus shoots to penetrate the universe that I create and purloin moments from it, forgetting the reality of the shooting as much as possible. I have frequently filmed sex. I believe this is a prerogative of mine, as woman and as person of Arab origin. With the portrayal of bodies, and the grace that emanates from them, I try to get close to painting. I am always trying to embellish, exalt the actors. Of course, the show business is always part of making a film, but the most extraordinary thing about cinema is the risk component. You never know the result you’ll get in the end. Coming from a family of gamblers – my father was a poker player – I adore this aspect. When I make a film, I don’t take anything for granted. Nonetheless, I yearn incessantly for every film to be as burning as possible, in both substance and form as well as in the manner it is realized.\\" Danielle Arbid has finished her fourth feature, Passion Simple an adaptation of the major French writer Annie Ernaux’s best seller book, with french actress Laetitia Dosch and ballet star Sergei Polunin. Danielle Arbid is occasionally actress : Dans les champs de bataille 2004, Les Apaches / Thierry de Peretti 2016 and In Réparer les vivants / Katell Quilleveré 2017. She is also a photographer.

The People's Republic of China's first reported AIDS case was identified in 1985 in a dying tourist.Settle E. AIDS in China: an annotated chronology: 1985–2003. Montreal: China AIDS Survey, 2003 In 1989, the first indigenous cases were reported as an outbreak in 146 infected heroin users in Yunnan province, near China's southwest border.Ma Y, Li ZZ, Zhang KX. Identifi cation of HIV infection among drug users in China. Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi 1990; 11:184–85 (in Chinese). Yunnan is the area most affected by HIV/AIDS in China. In 1989 first infections appeared among needle sharing drug users near the Burmese border. Up until 1993, the disease had remained a problem in the border areas before mobile people (truck drivers, construction and migrant workers and travelers) brought the virus further into the country. In 1995, the provinces of Sichuan and Xinjiang reported their first HIV cases, and by 1998, the virus had spread all over China. Low awareness of the disease among China's general population appears to be a major culprit. Most Chinese consider HIV/AIDS as a foreign issue, and even educated people are less knowledgeable of the virus, its transmission and prevention, than people in other countries. Until recently, the use of condoms was not very common, even among sex workers and their clients. As a result, the epidemic has spread from high-risk groups (drug users, sex workers, unsafe blood donors) to the general population. Heroin flow Heroin flows into Yunnan Province from neighboring Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar, bringing with it HIV. The province's first cases were reported in 1989. With a population of 44 million, Yunnan now has only 200 health workers trained for the disease. Officials estimate that the province has 80,000 infected people, most of them intravenous drug users who have spread the disease by sharing needles. In Gejiu, a city of 310,000 people on a route favored by drug traffickers, initial rounds of AIDS testing in recent years found more than 1,000 people with HIV, nearly all drug users or prostitutes.

Prediction Games are free to play, simple to learn, and pay out real cash to winners. In contrast, Predictive Market Games often require real cash deposits, are more complicated to play (may rely on some knowledge of the stock market or other type of open market exchange), or don't pay out real cash at all. Players, known as propheteers, can register (without the need to download any programs), start guessing, and earn cash points all in a matter of seconds. Propheteers will then begin competing with each other to see who can correctly predict events such as the outcome of a Major League Baseball game, who will be the next celebrity to enter rehab, or where the Dow Jones will close at on a particular day. Propheteers who correctly guess the outcome of an event are awarded points, which can be converted into cash payouts. Some websites choose specific subjects for their players to predict the future on. For example, certain websites will offer only questions on political events, while others may be based entirely on celebrities. It has been found that predictive gaming websites catering primarily to sports fans have a strong following from the same types of players who enjoy fantasy sports. Knowledge of team statistics and player's rankings has proven to be a great competitive advantage. Similarly, fans of video sharing sites now have a video stock exchange where they can predict the popularity of videos. Players receive payouts weekly based upon the number of times a video has been viewed on the popular hosting sites. Predictive games cover a wide variety of topics with thousands of questions to choose from. Legal considerations Because Prediction Games are free to play, they are not considered gambling, and are thus legal in all fifty of the United States. Prediction Games are skill-based and do not require any purchases or cash wagers to be made in order for a propheteer to play. Some gaming industry analysts are wary that this game may become highly addictive. Like Fantasy basketball, on-the-job workers may spend so much time playing Prediction Games that office productivity could suffer a significant loss. Real world applications Direct correlations have been found in results from groups surveyed on their predictions on many topics and the actual outcome of those events. For example, in the 1940s, large groups of individuals betting on elections had remarkable predictive accuracy. BettingPaper PDF format Rhode and Koleman Strumpf (2004) Many corporations are realizing the value of finding consensus from prediction games and using that to determine influence and conditional influence on real events. Faculty of Industrial engineering and management PDF format Wharmann and Ronen (2006) Furthermore, questions that focus on users' opinions of a certain outcome are often seen as polls. The results derived from these polls are a good indication of how the actual outcome of the event will unfold.

It is dedicated to St Nicholas and St Peter ad Vincula. History and architecture The present Church of St Nicholas and St Peter ad Vincula is of Norman origin (1170–1190), established in 1165 when the Augustinian Canons of the Abbey of St Mary de Pratis, Leicester were granted the right to present a priest to the parish. The church was lengthened in the 14th century and the Perpendicular style tower was added in 1460 by the Earl of Warwick, but it was never finished with its intended spire. In 1895 a carved stone Saxon font was recovered during refurbishments to the church by Lord Norton. The font had been buried under the nave floor, possibly during the Reformation and indicates that a church has been present on the site since Saxon times. This font has been in use ever since its rediscovery. Churchyard It is believed some soldiers killed in the English Civil War Battle of Curdworth Bridge are buried in the churchyard, which also contains the war graves of six Commonwealth service personnel of World War I (mostly Royal Flying Corps officers) and three of World War II. CWGC Cemetery Report. Breakdown obtained from casualty record.  Bells  There are three bells in the tower; the first tenor, The Mary Bell dating from the 15th century, said to have been given in gratitude by a traveller lost in the Forest of Arden, guided to safety to Curdworth by the sound of a bell. The second bell is dated 1756 and inscribed \\"Thos. Eayre de Kettering\\" and the third treble bell is inscribed \\"Edward Astley 1663. Thomas Wilcox\\". Organ The church has a two- manual pipe organ. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.  Sculpture  Amongst many pieces of sculpture is an angel (now headless) that used to be on the road bridge over the River Tame at Water Orton to safeguard the safe passage of travellers.

Background and history In 1903, the orchestra of the Sociedad de Conciertos de Madrid, which had been founded in 1866 by Francisco Asenjo Barbieri, was gripped by a crisis due to financial difficulties and irreconcilable disagreements between its section leaders. Some of the players decided to regroup in a new ensemble, which would assume the role of the Sociedad in organizing symphonic concerts and thus keep the classical music scene alive in Madrid. The idea of a new orchestra in the city was conceived initially at the house of the violinist José del Hierro, who enjoyed the support of the two companions with whom he regularly played chamber music on tour, violist Julio Francés and cellist Víctor Mirecki Larramat. Their meeting was joined by two members of the Capilla Real, flautist Francisco González and clarinetist Miguel Yuste. After a concerted campaign to win over their colleagues in the Sociedad, eighty per cent of the original orchestra joined the new ensemble proposed by Hierro. As a large number of the section leaders were also professors at the Madrid Royal Conservatory, the group managed to recruit young talents quickly to its vacant posts. The musicians held their first meeting in the rehearsal hall of the Teatro Real in December 1903, during which they decided on the name Orquesta Sinfónica de Madrid. The orchestra was constituted as a private, autonomous company of musicians, which would rely initially on its members to supply the setup funds for its operations (including the purchase of furniture and hiring of rehearsal halls and scores). Subsequently, however, the orchestra would support itself solely with earnings from concerts and recordings. It would avoid any dependence on external agents, whether public or private, who might intervene in its operations and impose conditions on its members, a misfortune which had befallen the defunct Sociedad. The first season Through the contacts of Hierro and Mirecki, the orchestra secured the agreement of the Spanish conductor, Alonso Cordelás, to lead the ensemble. Cordelás resigned his post in Munich and headed for Madrid, bringing with him the scores for the orchestra's first concerts. On February 7, 1904, under the direction of Cordelás, the orchestra gave its first public concert at the Teatro Real and presented the following program: *Overture to Don Giovanni, by Mozart; *In the Steppes of Central Asia, by Borodin; *Paraphrase on Wagner's Prize Song of the Master Singers for violin and orchestra, by August Wilhelmj (soloist: José del Hierro); *Faust Overture, by Wagner; *Romeo and Juliet, by Tchaikovsky; *Symphony No. 4 in D minor by Schumann. At the beginning, Cordelás sought to impose a break with Madrid custom by performing each concert in two parts separated by one interval, rather than in three parts, and playing in the afternoon at 3 p.m., instead of at night. By the third concert, Cordelás was forced to restore the two intervals, and by the sixth, the night schedule (8:45 p.m.) also made its return. However, Cordelás' problems had only just begun: he had confrontations firstly with the section leaders about rehearsals and the organization of concerts, and then with the hall owners about concert times, and finally had to face bad reviews and the rejection of his artistic choices by the public. These compelled him to resign at the end of the season, together with the founding concertmaster, José del Hierro. The remaining concerts of the first season, which included the long-overdue Madrid premieres of Tchaikovsky's Fourth Symphony and Brahms' First Symphony, nonetheless won the favor of the public and rescued the fledgling orchestra from financial failure. The Fernández Arbós era After the departure of Cordelás, Enrique Fernández Arbós, a violinist and conductor, took over the orchestra. He was instrumental in totally restructuring the organization and presenting its new face in a major concert on April 16, 1905. Fernández Arbós' leadership was uninterrupted for over thirty years. During his tenure, the orchestra determined its artistic priorities (above all, the promotion of Spanish composers and soloists), found its particular sonorous style, and established the principles of musical outreach which enabled it to give educational concerts and attract new listeners: lower ticket prices, more seats, and frequent tours. The orchestra featured the work of almost all the Spanish composers who flourished during the first third of the 20th century. It succeeded in attracting some illustrious guest conductors from abroad, such as Igor Stravinsky and Richard Strauss, and gave two important world premieres: Falla's Nights in the Gardens of Spain with pianist José Cubiles, at the Teatro Real, April 9, 1916; and Prokofiev's Second Violin Concerto with violinist Robert Soetens and the composer himself in the audience at the hall of the Teatro Monumental, December 1, 1935. Period of crisis The Spanish Civil War interrupted the orchestra's activities. The orchestra tried to stage concerts in besieged Madrid, but the number of available section leaders had shrunk drastically and those still in the city struggled to survive from day to day. The aftermath of the war marked the start of a long period of crisis for the orchestra, which began with the death of Fernández Arbós in June 1939, following the first concerts that year. To this blow was added the absence of the section leaders who had died during the Civil War or fled into exile after the victory of General Francisco Franco. Finally, in 1940, the Spanish National Orchestra was formed, with its seat in Madrid, and drew away further players from the symphony, since it offered them the generous salaries of civil servants. Those who refused to leave did so out of loyalty or because they were \\"suspects\\" in the eyes of Franco's regime. The effects of the departure were especially dire for the string section, which could not fill vacancies easily for three reasons: the poor delivery of music education during the Second Spanish Republic; the loss of a large number of string players to the Civil War or exile; and the impossibility of recruiting European professors after the outbreak of World War II. However, in 1940, the appointment of Enrique Jordá provided the orchestra with some musical direction at least until 1945. The orchestra in the pit The activity of the orchestra changed radically in 1958, when it became the tenured orchestra of the Teatro de la Zarzuela and alternated its appearances between the pit and the stage. Its engagements during the late 1950s and early 1960s were almost ceaseless, as it embarked on various tours throughout Spain and abroad, especially to Portugal and Latin America. In 1965, the formation of another new orchestra based in the capital, the Orquesta Sinfónica de RTVE, came once more at a cost to the ranks of the Madrid Symphony. During the 1970s, the Symphony's activity was tied closely to the needs of the Teatro de la Zarzuela. It took advantage of this niche, however, when it contracted with the company Hispavox to record a large number of zarzuelas and Spanish operas. The resulting recordings were invaluable not only for their quality but also because this was the first time that Spanish stage music had been welcomed without major inhibitions. The orchestra participated in all the productions at the Teatro de la Zarzuela, most notably in the television series Antología de la Zarzuela (1971) directed by José Tamayo. In contrast, the number of symphonic concerts it offered during these years fell greatly, and took place, in the majority of cases, in second-rate venues. This situation influenced the decision of many aging, long-standing players, who were receiving low pay in comparison with their intense work, to retire. Filling the vacancies posed a major problem and consequently the musical quality of the orchestra suffered. Renaissance During the Spanish transition to democracy after Franco's death in 1975, the then Minister of Culture, Soledad Becerril, offered the orchestra a contract which would grant it exclusive rights to serve the Teatro de la Zarzuela in performances of operas, ballets, and zarzuelas. The orchestra was recommended for this role by its institutional stability, experience, historical renown, and location in Madrid. The contract was signed in July 1981. To suit the interests of the Teatro de la Zarzuela, the orchestra underwent gradual restructuring to regain its quality. The opening of the Auditorio Nacional de Música in Madrid promised the orchestra new prospects, especially in symphonic performance. This ideal was maintained after it signed a new contract, this time with the Community of Madrid, to provide annual cycles of concerts in the new Auditorium. In 1997, the orchestra moved out of the Teatro de la Zarzuela to take up residence at the Teatro Real, which had been reopened recently by the Community. This contract will run until 2009. In 1999, the orchestra made several new appointments in the posts of principal conductor, Luis Antonio García Navarro, honorary conductor, Kurt Sanderling, and composer associate, Cristóbal Halffter. At the instigation of the Fundación Teatro Lírico, a choir attached to the orchestra and conducted by Martin Merry, was also formed. Assured of a special position among Madrid's cultural institutions, the orchestra has now begun to develop an educational plan, with the creation of an \\"Orchestra School\\" under the direction of Andrés Zarzo. From 2002, after the death of García Navarro, to 2010 the orchestra has been led by the musical conductor of the Teatro Real, Jesús López-Cobos.

Tromp agrees, but gets the school boundaries changed, transferring Scout to Laurelview Middle School. Laurelview is currently experiencing petty theft, on a grand scale. The perpetrators are two members of the staff: Mrs. Day, the lunchlady, and the janitor, Mr. Miller. Working with them are the school's safety patrol (who are also bullies), led by the principal's son, Kent Marlowe. During the safety patrol's introduction, Scout cheers \\"Go safeties!\\", causing all the kids in the audience to say the same, except as if telling them to leave, which angers the safety patrol. Scout also meets a kid named T'Boo, who introduces him to Lefty (who is right- handed), Red, Walt Whitman, Lucky, and Hannah Zapruder, who is one of the cheerleaders. It is later revealed that T'Boo is afraid of frogs ever since an incident in his biology class when he was attacked by a frog that came back from the dead. Meanwhile, Scout's grandfather has several broken bones (including his jaw) due to Scout accidentally (and unknowingly) knocking him off a ladder. When Mrs. Marlowe, the principal, becomes aware that a safety patrol member is involved in the thefts, Kent, Mrs. Day, and Mr. Miller look for a scapegoat to put the blame on, and so they employ Scout as a member of the safety patrol, as Mr. Miller and Kent have a mutual disliking for him. At a ceremony, in which Hannah is valedictorian, Kent gives a lighter and the key to Mrs. Marlowe's office to Mr. Miller and Mrs. Day, who then sneak them into Scout's pocket. When fellow patrolman Coop asks Scout to get his gloves, he discovers Mrs. Marlowe's office is on fire, so he puts the fire out and saves the hamster; however, when the key and the lighter fall out of his pocket, it appears as though Scout stole the key and started the fire, so he is kicked off of safety patrol and forbidden to attend the Fall Ball. Hannah and the others are sure Scout was set up. When Hannah's father is searching through his tape for a scene he can send to Wink Martindale, he, Hannah, Scout, and the others watch the ceremony and see Kent, Mr. Miller, and Mrs. Day planting the key and lighter on Scout. Scout, Hannah, T'Boo, and the others soon discover Mr. Miller and Mrs. Day's actual identities, mother-and-son thieves Georgina and Tim Bartlett, and that they are responsible for the thefts in the school. The crew goes to the Fall Ball, where they give the tape to Weird Al Yankovic, who plays the tape and exposes Kent and his gang for starting the fire. Tim and Georgina rob a tent, but are discovered in the process, so they take Hannah hostage aboard a hot air balloon (using Weird Al's balloon). Scout goes after them to stop them. Hannah throws a bag of money over the edge, and Tim jumps off, hanging onto the edge. Scout tries to save him but, unwilling to let go of the money to take Scout's hand, he falls, though he survives due to landing in a very small spot of water. By threatening to throw more money off the balloon, Hannah gets Georgina to land the balloon, though it crashes and sends Georgina falling into a hole, where she is hanging onto the edge. Scout and the others save her from falling to her death, during which time T'Boo encounters a frog, but soon he seems to get over the zombie frog attack. Afterward, the Bartletts are arrested. Scout is put back on safety patrol, and is ultimately named captain by his personal hero John Walsh. Meanwhile, Kent and his gang are replaced by T'Boo, Hannah, Red, Walt, Lucky, and Lefty. Grandpa Bozell makes a full recovery, though soon after is knocked out when he is sent crashing through a door by a waxer that, earlier in the film, seems to have come to life after being plugged in by Scout. Mr. Zapruder seemingly records this to send to Wink, but his camera has no tape in it.

The park has been granted the Green Flag Award by the Civic Trust.  History  The town's first mayor and MP, Henry Bolckow, first proposed the idea of a public park for the residents of Middlesbrough, dubbed the 'People's Park' in its conception. Bolckow was particularly conscious of the need to provide a \\"green lung\\" to ease the plight of the burgeoning industrial population of a town which was granted its charter of incorporation in 1853. In 1864, Bolckow bought land off Linthorpe Road and presented it to Middlesbrough Borough Council for use as a public park. An agreement drawn up between Bolckow and the Council in 1865 specified that the park should be called Albert Park and that £3000 should be spent on laying it out. Work commenced in 1865 to a design by William Barratt, using trees and shrubs from his nursery in Wakefield. The park was completed at a cost of £30,000. Albert Park was officially opened by Prince Arthur of Connaught later Duke of Connaught (seventh child of Queen Victoria) on 11 August 1868, the park being named after his father Prince Albert. Less than ten years later, it was the site of the formation by players from Middlesbrough Amateur Cricket Club of the original Middlesbrough Football Club and, for two years (its exit hastened by damage inflicted upon the Park by players and supporters alike), the club's first ground. Albert Park underwent a major refurbishment, completed in 2005 with the support of a £3.5 million grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund topped up by money from Middlesbrough Council and Northumbrian Water Environmental Trust. Features such as the tower clock, war memorial walls, bandstand, fountain, South African war memorial, sundial and West Lodge were restored. The bandstand was a reproduction of the original park bandstand. A new visitor centre was created and there was considerable improvement to the lake. New facilities such as boathouse, roller rink, and teenage play area were built.  Landmarks   Sculptures  A statue depicting sporting legend Brian Clough at the start of his football career was unveiled in the park on 16 May 2007. The 7 ft-tall bronze figure, sculpted by Vivien Mallock, shows a 24-year-old Clough with his boots slung over his shoulder striding towards Ayresome Park, Middlesbrough's former ground, on his way to training.  Sundial  A grade II listed sundial, designed and constructed by John Smith of Stockton, was donated by H.W.F Bolckow in 1879. The sundial allows people within the park itself to read the time in the UK, New York City and Melbourne.  Central fountain  The central fountain in Albert Park, was originally presented by Joseph Pease in 1869. It underwent substantial renovation and was switched back on Friday 2 April 2004.  Events  A Parkrun takes place every Saturday morning at 9am.

The volunteers of this Regiment came from northwestern Illinois, the valley of the Rock River; thus they mainly came from Whiteside, Lee, Ogle, and Carroll counties, but some came further south from Christian, Morgan, Randolph, and Edgar counties. Edward N. Kirk, an attorney from Sterling in Whiteside County, raised the regiment and became its first Colonel when the regiment mustered in for three years service on September 7, 1861. Service The 34th Illinois Infantry was organized at Camp Butler, Illinois and mustered into Federal service on September 7, 1861, and moved October 2 to Columbus, Ohio, thence to Lexington, Kentucky, and then to Camp Nevin, Kentucky, where it remained until February 14, 1862. It was then in Kirk's Brigade of Rousseau's Division, marched to Bowling Green, and thence via Nashville, Franklin and Columbia, to Savannah on the Tennessee River. It fought at the Battle of Shiloh, being then in McCook's Brigade of Buell's Army, losing fifteen killed, and one hundred and twelve wounded.

Ignacio Luis Vallarta Ogazón (25 August 1830, Guadalajara, Jalisco – 31 December 1893, Mexico, D.F.) was a Mexican jurist and governor of the Mexican state of Jalisco (1872–1876). His baptismal name was José Luis Miguel Ignacio Vallarta Ogazón. Vallarta graduated from the University of Guadalajara with a law degree in 1854 and started to practice law the following year. He quickly became involved in the political struggle in Jalisco between liberalism, represented by Jalisco Governor Santos Degollado, and traditionalism, represented by Bishop Pedro Espinosa of Guadalajara.Río Rodríguez, Carlos del - Vallarta: hombre universal p. 183 In 1856, Vallarta became private secretary of Governor Degollado. Vallarta and Degollado participated in the Constituent Congress of 1856-57 as delegates for Jalisco. Vallarta fought in the Reform War on the side of Benito Juárez, attending the convention that drafted the 1857 Constitution of Mexico. He was also an ally of Juarez during the French Intervention in Mexico, and went into exile in the US from 1864 until 1866. He served in Juarez's cabinet after the restoration, but resigned in 1868 because of disagreements between himself and Jaurez's foreign minister Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada.Río Rodríguez, Carlos del - Vallarta: hombre universal p. 184 He was elected governor of his native state of Jalisco in 1871. During his governorship he was responsible for rebuilding the Government Palace, passage of the Public Education Law of 1874, and finishing work on the state penitentiary.Río Rodríguez, Carlos del - Vallarta: hombre universal p. 185 He declined re-election when his term ended in 1876. In 1876 he was named Foreign Minister under Porfirio Díaz. In 1877 he was named President of the Supreme Court of Mexico, an office which he served concurrently with his role as Foreign Minister. He resigned from these positions in 1882, retiring into private law practice until his death in 1893. Ignacio Vallarta's remains are interred at the Rotonda de las Personas Ilustres in Mexico City. The Mexican resort city of Puerto Vallarta is named after him, as is Av. Vallarta, one of the main roads through central Guadalajara.

She is known for her work on the issue of commercial sexual exploitation and domestic trafficking and has been a leader in helping shift the perception of trafficked girls from criminals to victims and now to survivors and leaders. She immigrated to the US in 1997 and began working to end domestic sex trafficking, primarily focusing on addressing the commercial sexual exploitation of children and young women. In 1998, she established the Girls Educational and Mentoring Services, which is based in Harlem, New York. In March 1998, Lloyd attended the first International Summit of Sexually Exploited Youth, presented by the International Centre to Combat Exploitation of Children, held in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. During the summit, she assisted in drafting a declaration and call to action by governments throughout the world. On 22 October 2009, she presented the declaration at the United Nations, following which, it was ratified by 120 countries. In 2004, Lloyd was named one of the \\"100 Women Who Shape New York\\" by the New York Daily News. On 4 September 2006, she was recognised as a \\"Notable New Yorker\\" by WCBS-TV. Later that same year, she was also honoured with the Reebok International Human Rights Award. In 2008, she was the recipient of the Social Entrepreneurship Award from the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, while two years later, she was named to an Ashoka Fellowship and a Prime Mover Fellowship. On 12 May 2010, she was named \\"New Yorker of the Week\\" by NY1.  Early life  Rachel Lloyd was born in 1975, in Stalbridge, Dorset, England, where she was raised by her mother and stepfather. She attended private school on a scholarship to Portsmouth High School for Girls. While attending Portsmouth, she was on the receiving end of racial prejudice and taunting, expressed by both the school administration and members of her peer group. In response to the treatment she received at school and home, Lloyd left school at the age of 13. In an interview published in Marie Claire magazine, Lloyd stated, \\"I was 17 when I turned my first trick, compared with the 12-year-olds I meet today.\\"Richards, Sarah E. (1 December 2003) \\"Woman Warrior\\", Marie Claire. When she was 17 years old, she moved to Germany, in an effort to change her life. In 1994, Lloyd started on the road to recovery with the help of a military family and a church on a US Air Force base in Germany.  Life in New York  In 1997, Lloyd immigrated to the US to begin working with incarcerated adult women. She began working with adult women who were coming out of prostitution, as well as women incarcerated at Rikers Island and county correctional facilities. She later began addressing domestic policy in an effort to abolish sex trafficking, primarily focusing on the commercial sexual exploitation of children and young women. She also reached out to women working the streets on Hunts Point in the Bronx. During this time, she observed the need for community services for young women who were either at risk of being sexually exploited or were currently being trafficked. She recognised the severe emotional and practical needs of women and young girls who were being ignored by traditional government-based social service agencies. After arriving in New York, Lloyd returned to school and began studying in preparation to take her General Educational Development (or GED) test. Passing successfully certified that her academic skills and abilities were equivalent to receiving an American education at the high school level. With this certification, she continued on to college, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology from Marymount Manhattan College and her Masters in Applied Urban Anthropology from the City College of New York. Despite some painful memories, Lloyd states that she does not regret her life. \\"Obviously there have been experiences I would rather not have had and pain I wish I hadn't felt, but every experience, every tear, every hardship has equipped me for the work I do now,\\" she says. \\"I get such deep satisfaction from knowing I'm fulfilling my purpose, that my life is counting for something; it puts all the past hurts into perspective. My pain has become my passion and I find true joy in my work, in my life, and in seeing 'my girls' fulfill their purpose too.\\"  Advocacy work  In 1998, Lloyd established the Girls Educational and Mentoring Services, which works to support girls and young women who have been victimised by the commercial sex industry in the US. The vision for the organisation was birthed from Lloyd's own experiences of sexual exploitation as a teenager, in addition to her encounters with the ineffective support services of the political and social systems, which had been designed to protect the many victims of violence and abuse. , the organisation is one of the largest providers of services to young women and girls, ages 12–24, who have experienced commercial sexual exploitation and domestic trafficking. The organisation provides direct services for over 1,000 girls and young women each year. , Lloyd serves as the chief executive officer of the organisation.http://ncfy.acf.hhs.gov/media-center/podcasts/voices-field- rachel-lloyd Lloyd was appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the 2020 New Year Honours for services to supporting victims and survivors of commercial sexual exploitation and trafficking.  Legislative focus  Lloyd works to address legislative shortfalls, which limit the effectiveness of government and community programs and ability of individuals and organisations to reach victims of sex trafficking in cities and states across the US. For example, when young girls under the age of 18 are arrested for prostitution or other illegal activities of a sexual nature, they are often charged and sentenced to probation or time in jail. They enter the criminal justice system with the legal presumption that they are juvenile delinquents. At the same time, the federal Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, defines human sex trafficking as a commercial sex act induced by force, fraud or coercion, or involving a minor, many states continue to treat victims of child sexual exploitation as criminals. State laws have been enacted that actually support prosecuting sexually exploited youth, rather than offering them protection and assistance as victims of a horrible crime. When Lloyd began working with victims, she discovered that New York, as well as many other states, relied on the enactment of legislation that contradicts the federal statute. Although comprehensive research to document the number of children engaged in prostitution in the US is lacking, the Department of Justice, estimates about 293,000 American youth are currently \\"at risk\\" of becoming victims of commercial sexual exploitation. Sgt. Byron Fassett of the Dallas Police Child Exploitation Squad, points out an obvious irony of this situation. \\"If a 45-year-old man had sex with a 14-year-old girl and no money changed hands, she was likely to get counseling and he was likely to get jail time for statutory rape. If the same man left $80 on the table after having sex with her, she would probably be locked up for prostitution and he would probably go home with a fine as a john.\\"Urbina, Ian (26 October 2009). \\"Running in the Shadows: For Runaways, Sex Buys Survival\\", The New York Times. Lloyd works to change these misconceptions that view children as criminals, speaking out against these laws and sentences in the United States. She played a key role in lobbying New York State legislators to pass the 2008 Safe Harbor for Exploited Youth Act. The bill recognises these children as victims, rather than criminals, and provides them with necessary social services. \\"It benefits girls who are not legally old enough to consent to sex, who'd be protected under statutory rape laws if money hadn't changed hands,\\" she says. In February 2010, Lloyd presented testimony before the United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law hearing entitled \\"In Our Own Backyard: Child Prostitution and Sex Trafficking in the United States\\". In his opening statements, Senator Dick Durbin, chairman of the subcommittee, recognised Lloyd's leadership in addressing the sexual exploitation of children and advocating for change in the New York State criminal justice system. In referring to the Safe Harbor for Exploited Youth Act, in which Lloyd played an important role, Durbin stated that \\"Congress should build on New York's fine work and make clear that children who are subjected to sex trafficking should not be treated like criminals.\\"  Public education  Very Young Girls is a 2007 documentary film that presents the work of the Girls Educational and Mentoring Services. Directed by David Schisgall, the film is an exposé of human trafficking that follows 13- and 14-year-old American girls as they are coerced and exploited on New York's streets by pimps; while being treated as adult criminals by police.Buchanan, Jason (4 July 2008). \\"All Movie Guide: Very Young Girls\\", The New York Times.Catsoulis, Jeannette (4 July 2008). \\"Movie Review: Very Young Girls – Children Without Childhoods\\", The New York Times.

The UK-based newspaper The Guardian considers it \\"the globe's largest and most powerful online activist network\\".. The name chosen for the community is a Romanization of a word meaning \\"voice\\" in various languages, such as Hindi आवाज़ and Urdu آواز. Cofounders Groups Avaaz.org was co-founded by Res Publica, a \\"community of public sector professionals dedicated to promoting good governance, civic virtue and deliberative democracy,\\" and MoveOn.org, an American non-profit progressive public policy advocacy group. It was also supported by Service Employees International Union, a founding partner. Individuals Avaaz's individual co-founders include Ricken Patel, Tom Pravda, former Virginia congressman Tom Perriello, MoveOn Executive Director Eli Pariser, Australian entrepreneur David Madden, Jeremy Heimans (co-founders of Purpose.com), and Andrea Woodhouse. The board consists of Ricken Patel (president), Ian Bassin, and Sam Barratt. Leadership Avaaz's founding President and CEO is the Canadian- British Ricken Patel. He studied PPE (politics, philosophy, economics) at Balliol College, Oxford University. He received a Masters in Public Policy from Harvard University. He worked for the International Crisis Group around the world, including in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Sudan and Afghanistan, where he says \\"he learnt how to bring rebel forces to the negotiation table, to monitor elections (covertly), to restore public faith in once corrupt political systems and to spot when foreign forces were being manipulated.\\" He returned to the US and volunteered for MoveOn.org, where he learned how to use online tools for activism. Funding, campaigns selection process and management \\"Since 2009, Avaaz has not taken donations from foundations or corporations, nor has it accepted payments of more than $5,000 (£3,100),\\" The Guardian reported. \\"Instead, it relies simply on the generosity of individual members, who have now raised over $20m (£12.4m).\\" Prior to 2009 various foundations had funded Avaaz's staff and start-up costs. Global campaigns selection process Avaaz global campaigns are managed by a team of campaigners working from over 30 countries, including the UK, India, Lebanon and Brazil. They communicate with members via email, and employ campaigning tactics including online public petitions, videos, and email-your-leader tools. In some cases Avaaz also uses advertisements and commissions legal advice to clarify how best to take a campaign forward, and stages \\"sit-ins, rallies, phone-ins and media friendly stunts\\". Examples of stunts include \\"taking a herd of cardboard pigs to the doors of the World Health Organisation to demand an investigation into the link between swine flu and giant pig farms and creating a three-mile human chain handshake from the Dalai Lama to the doors of the Chinese Embassy in London to request dialogue between the parties\\". Suggestions for campaigns come from members, supplemented by guidance from teams of specialists. Once a suggestion has been taken up as having potential, tester email are polled to 10,000 Avaaz members; if the emails receive a sufficient response, the campaign is opened up to all Avaaz members. In 2010 The Economist suggested that \\"the way Avaaz bunches unlikely causes together may be an asset in a world where campaigns, like race and class, can still segregate people, not reconcile them.\\" Ideology Avaaz claims to unite practical idealists from around the world. Director Ricken Patel said in 2011, \\"We have no ideology per se. Our mission is to close the gap between the world we have and the world most people everywhere want. Idealists of the world unite!\\" In practice, Avaaz often supports causes considered progressive, such as calling for global action on climate change, challenging Monsanto, and building greater global support for refugees. During the 2009 Iranian presidential election protests, Avaaz set up Internet proxy servers to allow protesters to upload videos onto public websites. Avaaz supported the establishment of a no-fly zone over Libya, which led to the military intervention in the country in 2011. It was criticized for its pro-intervention stance in the media and blogs. Avaaz supported the civil uprising preceding the Syrian Civil War. This included sending $1.5 million of Internet communications equipment to protesters, and training activists. Later it used smuggling routes to send over $2 million of medical equipment into rebel-held areas of Syria. It also smuggled 34 international journalists into Syria. Avaaz coordinated the evacuation of wounded British photographer Paul Conroy from Homs. Thirteen Syrian activists died during the evacuation operation. Some senior members of other non- governmental organizations working in the Middle East have criticized Avaaz for taking sides in a civil war. As of November 2016, Avaaz continues campaigning for no-fly zones over Syria in general and specifically Aleppo. (Gen. Dunford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States, has said that establishing a no-fly zone means going to war against Syria and Russia.) It has received criticism from parts of the political blogosphere and has a single digit percentage of its users opposing the petitions, with a number of users ultimately leaving the network. The Avaaz team responded to this criticism by issuing two statements defending their decision to campaign. In the 2016 United States presidential election, Avaaz campaigned against Donald Trump with the slogan \\"Defeat Donald Trump\\", and produced a software tool to simplify overseas voter registration. In September 2017, Avaaz took legal action in the British High Court of Justice to oppose 21st Century Fox's bid to take over the pan-European broadcasting company Sky plc, by seeking a judicial review of the regulator Ofcom's decision not to recommend rejection of the takeover. Monsanto subpoena In January 2018, Monsanto requested Avaaz hand over all documents the organization held in relation to glyphosate. Lawyers for the company said they planned to use the documentation in their defense during an upcoming court case involving two plaintiffs in Missouri who say their cancer was caused by exposure to Monsanto's \\"Roundup\\" herbicide. Avaaz argued that a successful subpoena would result in a \\"chilling effect\\" on the group's work. On September 5, 2018 a New York judge sided with Avaaz. The judge stated that the subpoena \\"risked 'chilling' free speech and political activity\\", and argued that Monsanto's request was \\"anti-democratic\\".  Reception  Some question whether Avaaz's focus on online petitions and email campaigns may encourage laziness, transforming potential activism into clicktivism. Malcolm Gladwell says that petition tools do not create \\"close- knit, disciplined and tenacious\\" networks of activists. In February 2012, Avaaz raised money for the evacuation of Paul Conroy from Syria, a mission that led to the deaths of 13 activists in Syria. A New Republic article accused Avaaz of making false claims about their own role in the evacuation. Jillian York has accused Avaaz of lack of transparency and arrogance. The Defensor Da Natureza blog has accused Avaaz of taking credit for the success of the Ficha Limpa anti-corruption bill in Brazil, which Luis Nassif reposted. In 2008, Canadian conservative minister John Baird labeled Avaaz a \\"shadowy foreign organization\\" tied to billionaire George Soros. Another Canadian, conservative media personality Ezra Levant, tried to make a link between Soros and Avaaz.org as an indirect supporter through MoveOn, but the article was later retracted as baseless and an apology was offered to Soros.

Their first 7\\" single, \\"Empire Of Passion/Splice Of Life\\" balanced sound-poetry with minimalist rock, using tape permutations and found percussion to evoke bleak and droning walls of sound. The first full-length LP, \\"Scheintot\\", expanded on the directions taken with their first single, creating a morbid, moody, and subtle experimental rock album that was highly innovative for its time. Reminiscent at times of bands like Throbbing Gristle or early Cabaret Voltaire (\\"Anemone Housing\\" or \\"Over My Shoulder - And Out of My Life\\"), the album also managed to demonstrate a strong rock sensibility, betraying influences of bands like The Velvet Underground (\\"Ballad of the Grim Rider\\") or even avant rock contemporaries like Art Bears or '70s era King Crimson (the opening track, \\"Eerie Lights\\" or \\"The Center of the Doll\\"). The live LP California Babylon (1982) (a collaboration with Monte Cazazza - the record is credited to \\"Factrix-Cazazza\\" on the cover) by contrast was a far more stark and abrasive release, in both minimalist sound and morbid lyrical content. The record also featured a musical treatment of the Brion Gysin cut up \\"poem\\" \\"Kick that Habit Man\\" with avant garde percussionist Z'EV backing the band.

One is a mature, bearded centaur, with a pained expression, and the other is a young smiling centaur with his arm raised. The amorini are missing that once rode the backs of these centaurs, which are the outstanding examples of a group of sculptures varying the motif.M. Bieber, The Sculpture of the Hellenistic Age, rev. ed. (New York, 1961) figs. 581 and 583. The amorino survives on the Louvre centaur. The strongly contrasted moods were intended to remind the Roman viewer of the soul troubled in pain with love or uplifted in joy, themes of Plato's Phaedrus and Hellenistic poetry.Van de Grift, \\"Tears and Revel: The Allegory of the Berthouville Centaur Scyphi\\" American Journal of Archaeology 88 (July 1984:377-88) esp. pp. 383, where he gives several literary instances in the context of the Furietti centaurs, notably Posidippus, who complains in a poem of the Palatine Anthology of the power of love that drives him alternately \\"to tears and revel\\", and Roman references to the paradoxical nature of watered and unwatered wine, which espouse temperance and moderation. Capitoline Centaurs The sculptures were found together at Hadrian's Villa in Tivoli by Monsignor Giuseppe Alessandro Furietti in December 1736; they were the outstanding pieces of his collection of antiquities, which he refused to give to Pope Benedict XIV— at the cost of a cardinal's hat. Furietti was eventually created cardinal priest, by Pope Clement XIII in the consistory of 24 September 1759. After the cardinal's death, his heirs sold the centaurs and the Furietti mosaic of four drinking doves for 14,000 scudi, and they have been in the Capitoline Museum ever since.Musei Capitolini, acc. nos. 656 and 658; Helbig, 4th ed., no. 1398 (entry by H. von Steuben). Both statues bear the signatures of Aristeas and Papias of Aphrodisias, a city in Asia Minor— we cannot be certain about the exact relationship of the signatures to the sculptures, whether as originators of the model or sculptors of these versions. Where the sculptures were produced is not sure either: whether in Aphrodisias, or whether the artists, of whom nothing else is known, had come from there to Rome. To judge by the stylistic date these Hadrianic copies will date to the late 1st or early 2nd century AD. They are generally assumed to be copies of 2nd century BC bronzeBronze originals would not have required the tree-stump supports beneath the bellies. Hellenistic originals, though recent critical study, notably by Brunilde Sismondo Ridgway, suggests that many sculptural types usually thought to be Hellenistic are in fact Roman pastiches or inventions. Louvre The Old Centaur (Louvre) Another copy of the same type as the Old Centaur, this time in white marble, was excavated in Rome in the 17th century (having lost its probable Young Centaur pair). It entered the Borghese collection, but was acquired from Camillo Filippo Ludovico Borghese by Napoleon in 1807 and is now in the Louvre Museum.Louvre acc. no. 562. It has Eros on the centaur's back, teasing him, which has not survived on the Capitoline example, though Eros' arm and foot and the centaur's left arm on this example are restorations, and the base and the support beneath the centaur are modern additions. The original right arm of the centaur is pulled tautly back showing that he has his hands bound tightly behind his back, and \\"grimaces in pain and sorrow as an amorino pulls the centaur's head back at an abrupt angle.\\"Van de Grift 1984:383. Reception The pair were popular in the 18th century, as illustrations of centaurs that posed them as civilized patrons of hospitality and learning, like Chiron, rather than bestial half-animals (as at the Battle of the Centaurs). With their erotes, they were emblems of the joy of young love and the contrasting bondage of maturity to love,Sexual desires \\"which torment the old and delight the young\\", as Francis Haskell and Nicholas Penny observed in discussing this pair, in Taste and the Antique: the lure of classical sculpture, 1500-1900, 1981, cat. no. 20, p. 178; they discuss the reception of the Furietti centaurs p. 179. themes to which a Rococo audience would easily respond. The observant Ennio Quirino ViscontiVisconti, Monumenti scelti borghesiani, 1837:29, noted by Haskell and Penny 1981. remarked on the Bacchic attributes of the Borghese/Louvre centaur, whose amorino is crowned with berried vine, to suggest that the forces in play were those of intoxication rather than love. Jon van de Grift, in examining the iconography of a pair of early Imperial Roman silver scyphi (drinking cups) embossed with motifs of centaurs ridden by erotes, part of the Berthouville treasure,Van de Grift 1984:38. notes that \\"the motif of an amorino torturing an old sullen centaur, usually within a lively Dionysiac procession, is encountered in Roman mosaics and Dionysiac sarcophagi;\\"Van de Grift 1984:382. he offers the Furietti centaurs as iconographic parallels. Casts of them were collected across Europe - for example, the pair at the Royal Academy, London, one at either side of the foot of the main staircase, which are there to this day (in what is now the Courtauld Institute gallery; or those bought by Joseph Nollekens from Bartolomeo Cavaceppi that may still be seen at Shugborough Hall, Staffordshire. Full-sized marble copies were also produced in large numbers - Cavaceppi produced them, and Pietro Della Valle sculpted one in Rome for the count Grimod d'Orsay - he intended it to be placed on a fountain in the Museum Courtyard in 1795, but it was in fact placed at Saint-Cloud in July 1802 (it was later brought to Versailles on 23 March 1872, and on 24 September 1924 moved into the Grand Trianon garden there.

First formed in 1969, it is the first and oldest RSAF operational squadron in service. The squadron goes by the motto of \\"Strive To Achieve\\". Since 2006, it operates the AH-64D Apache Longbow attack helicopter and has participated in Singapore's National Day Parade together with 127 Squadron CH-47SD Chinook for the traditional National Flag Fly Pass. Roles and Missions The AH-64D Apache Longbows of the squadron, armed with its varied payload of AGM-114 Hellfire missiles, Hydra 70 rockets and a single 30 mm M230 Chain Gun, can be called upon in support of the SAF in any operations that requires it. Provisions has also been made to integrate the helicopters into the SAF's Integrated Knowledge-based Command and Control network, a concept similar to the United States Department of Defense's network-centric warfare doctrine. This locally developed Combat Management System integrates all the sensors and weapon systems on board, increases battlespace awareness and allows little time for the enemy to react due to the short sensor-to-shooter loops as it effectively shares information between its army and navy counterparts. Unit history When the British decided in 1967 to withdraw their forces from the Far East, Singapore saw the need to build up its own armed forces. The Singapore Air Defence Command (SADC) was formed as part of the initial set-up. The Alouette Squadron, established in September 1969, thus lay the foundation for RSAF's helicopter force. Alouette Squadron The Alouette Squadron was initially based at the Seletar Airfield, occupying the Lockheed (now ST Aerospace) hangar. In January 1971, the Squadron became the first SADC unit to be deployed overseas when four of her aircraft participated in the Kuantan flood relief operation in Malaysia. Shortly thereafter, the Alouette Squadron gained operational status becoming the first operational unit in the SADC. Relocated to Changi Air Base shortly after New Year's Day 1972, the Squadron's main roles included search-and-rescue, air recce, internal security, rappelling, trooplift and logistics support. New Designation On 16 December 1973, the squadron's designation was changed to 120 Squadron (120 SQN). The squadron continued to operate the Alouette IIIs until 1977, when the aircraft were no longer able to meet the SAF's growing needs. In 1977, three Bell 212s and seventeen UH-1Hs were acquired, and the helicopters joined the squadron in February and August respectively. 120 SQN initiated the RSAF's first permanent overseas detachment in September 1978, when three UH-1Hs were deployed to Brunei for the first time. Their role was primarily to support the SAF's jungle training conducted there. Tasked with the duty of airborne Search and rescue around Singapore and parts of South China Sea, the Bell 212s operated from 1977 to 1985 when Super Puma helicopters of the 125 Squadron took over the duty. In 1983, the squadron relocated for the last time and settled down at Sembawang Air Base as the helicopters had vacated Changi and settled in Kangaw Camp. Kangaw was then used as an artillery base, although it was previously a British airfield – RAF Sembawang or better known as HMS Simbang. When the Singapore Artillery shifted to Khatib Camp in 1983, Kangaw Camp was handed over to the RSAF and renamed as Sembawang Air Base (SBAB). Since then, SBAB became the focal point of helicopter operations and one of the five formations in the RSAF. Notable Deployments In the 1980s, three dramatic events thrust 120 SQN into the headlines. In October 1980, the squadron starred in a high-rise rescue drama at the unfinished Raffles Tower in Battery Road. A Bell 212 was sent to rescue a crane operator from the roof of the building after a fire on the 18th floor had trapped him. Then, in January 1983, three people had to be winched to safety from the Singapore Cable Car by a Bell 212 after a drill-ship accidentally ploughed into and severed the cables off the waters of World Trade Centre, Singapore. Reproduced with additional commentary in The third occasion was the Hotel New World disaster in March 1986. After the hotel collapsed, 120 SQN deployed three UH-1Hs to the disaster site to provide round-the-clock casualty evacuation. Other Recognitions As recent as October 2002, 120 SQN deployed a detachment of four UH-1H to East Timor in support of the UN peace keeping mission there. Also amongst its achievements, the 120 SQN won several ASEAN Helicopter championships; and has been winning the best tactical support SQN for the years 88/89, 91/92, 94/95, 95/96 and 99/00.

Unlike the principal, the vice-principal does not have quite the decision-making authority that the principal carries. Although they still carry nearly the same authority among students, vice-principals do not have the same power on the board.

Education Most schools require elementary, middle, and high school principals to have a master's degree in education administration or leadership.Elementary, Middle, and High School Principals : Occupational Outlook Handbook : U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Most principals also have experience as teachers. Master's degrees in educational administration are offered at a number of universities around the United States including the University of North Texas,UNT Graduate Studies College of Education Masters of Educational Leadership Ball State University, Drexel University, Ashland University, Northeastern University, and the University of Scranton. Duties In American schools, it is often his or her duty to handle matters such as student discipline, parent conference meetings, asset inventory and ordering, school improvement planning, bus and lunch supervision, and teacher observations. Additionally, assistant principals frequently serve as testing coordinators, training staff on procedures related to standardized assessment, as well as accounting for testing materials. In addition to these duties, assistant principals are instructional leaders. Most importantly however, in the event that something happens to the principal, such as an extended leave of absence, the assistant principal would act as the interim principal. Because of this, many see this position as a stepping-stone to the larger role of principal and is often used as such. In most schools, the vice principal forgoes all teaching duties in order to address broader educational issues. However, in Canada, during an extended leave of absence of the principal, usually a retired principal will be assigned to a school by the school board/district to oversee the management of the school until the actual principal returns; thus, the roles and responsibilities of the Vice- Principal(s) will remain the same. In the United Kingdom, most secondary schools have Assistant Principals (or traditionally known as Assistant Headteachers), with the Vice-Principals (or traditionally known as Deputy Headteachers) managing them. Their duties vary from school to school; however, usually Assistant Principals and Vice-Principals support school initiatives in maintaining/overseeing standards, behavior, Key Stages 3–5, teaching and exam timetabling, inclusion, the curriculum and student learning, and overall accountability in the school. They can also carry out performance appraisals and teacher observations. Furthermore, principals/head teachers/headmasters/headmistresses are beginning to have more autonomy on how they will structure their school's senior leadership team and what each member's role will be. These additional roles that are found in English secondary schools can lead to senior leadership/administrative teams to be as large as 8–12 people, depending on the school's size and its demographics (e.g., 1-2 Headteacher(s), 2–4 Deputy Headteachers, 3–8 Assistant Headteachers). In contrast to the US and Canada, most Assistant Headteachers and/or Deputy Headteachers teach 1–2 courses on top of their administrative duties.

He was one of ten children born to Stephen Cooper Dendy and Miramne Dubbins in Horsham, Sussex, England. He was a younger brother to prominent surgeon Walter Cooper Dendy, and one of his sisters, Amelia Dendy, became the wife of Edward Howard Howard-Gibbon. He kept a diary for a number of years that reveals a great deal not only about his daily life and work, but also about his activities with the Howard-Gibbon family. Edward became an officer in the College when appointed as Rouge Dragon Pursuivant of Arms in Ordinary in 1848. He also served as Surrey Herald Extraordinary in 1856, and was promoted to Chester Herald of Arms in Ordinary in 1859. He assisted Garter King of Arms, Sir Charles Young, on missions to Turkey and Prussia. He was responsible for compiling most of the information up to that time on the long line of Dendy families living in Sussex and adjacent counties.

Gabriel Chow. Retrieved February 29, 2016. Previous to the reorganization of the hierarchy in northern Italy by Pope Pius VII after the expulsion of the French and the Congress of Vienna, the diocese of Pavia had depended directly upon the Holy See, despite repeated failed attempts on the part of the Archbishops of Milan to claim control.Kehr, pp. 171-172. The diocese has produced one Pope and Patriarch of Venice, and three cardinals. The seat of the bishop is the Cattedrale di Maria Assunta e S. Stefano Protomartire in Pavia. The current Bishop of Pavia is Corrado Sanguineti, appointed by Pope Francis on 1 December 2015. History Pavia was the capital of the Lombard Kingdom of Italy (from 570) and of their successors, the Holy Roman Emperors as Kings of Italy. There was a royal palace in Pavia, Thomas Granier, \\"Capitales royales et princières de l'Italie lombarde,\\" in: which saw frequent visits from the Emperors. Pope Hormisdas (517–523) is said to have granted Bishop Ennodius and his successors as Bishops of Pavia the use of the pallium.Ughelli, I, p. 1075. Capsoni, p. xxxiii. This claim has, however, been challenged.Kehr, pp. 173-174, no. †*1. Cappelletti, p. 400. Pope John VIII also granted the Bishops of Pavia the same privilege in a letter of 24 August 877.Kehr, pp. 174-175, no. 5. In the last week of June 743, Pope Zacharias (741–752) visited Pavia and solemnly celebrated the Feast of S. Peter at the monastery of S. Pietro in Ciel d'oro.Kehr, p. 192. Louis Duchesne, Le Liber Pontificalis Tome I (Paris: Ernest Thorin 1886), p. 430. Bishop Joannes (II) (874–911 ?) signed the confirmation of the accession of Charles the Bald and took the oath of allegiance in February 876.Bosisio (1852), Concilia Papiensia, pp. 48-50. Pope John VIII held a synod at Pavia in December 878, as he was returning to Rome from his trip to France.Bosisio (1852), Concilia Papiensia, pp. 58-59. In 885, Pope Stephen V (885–891) granted the Bishop of Pavia the duchy of Comacchio.Kehr, p. 177, no. 14. A synod met in Pavia in 889 to ratify the selection of Guido of Spoleto as King of Italy, and to swear feudal allegiance.Bosisio (1852). Concilia Papiensia, pp. 60-63. A council was held at Pavia in 933 to expel Bishop Ratherius of Verona from his diocese for three years, because of his opposition to Hugh of Arles, King of Italy. He was restored by a synod under orders from Pope John XII.Bosisio (1852), Concilia Papiensia, pp. 63-64. On 2 April 987, Bishop Guido and the Canons of the Cathedral received a rebuke from Pope John XV because they had been harassing the monastery of S. Pietro in Ciel d'oro.Kehr, p. 177 no. 18. In 997, Pope Gregory V (Bruno of Carinthia) held a synod in Pavia. He had been expelled from Rome shortly after the Coronation of the Emperor Otto III, his cousin, who had procured his election to the papal throne at the request of the Romans themselves. Shortly after his coronation, Otto condemned and expelled from Rome the former dictator of the City, Crescentius of Nomentum. As soon as Otto left the city, Crescentius returned and drove out Pope Gregory, who fled to Pavia. At the synod of Pavia, the rule against making agreements about a future pope during the lifetime of the present pope was reenacted, as were rules against simony. Crescentius was excommunicated, and, on the Pope's return to Rome, was beheaded in the Castel S. Angelo.Bosisio (1852), Concilia Papiensia, pp. 64-65. J.N.D. Kelly, The Oxford Dictionary of Popes (Oxford 1986), \\"Gregory V\\", pp. 134-135. On 15 April 1123, Pope Calixtus II confirmed all the privileges belonging to the Church of Pavia, and issued a ruling that, at Roman synods, the Bishop of Pavia should hold the first seat on the left of the pope, perpetualiter.Kehr, p. 180, no. 33. Bishop Pietro Toscani (1148–1180) was deprived of his episcopal cross and his pallium by Pope Alexander III in 1175 or 1176, because of his support for the Antipope Victor IV and the excommunicated Frederick Barbarossa. Frederick continued to protect him, however, even though the city of Pavia joined the Lombard League. After the Lombard League triumphed over Frederick at the Battle of Legnano, the Bishop's position became precarious. When Alexander reached an agreement with Frederick at their conference at Venice, Bishop Pietro was among those forgiven for their crimes.Kehr, p. 182, no. 40. The Studium Generale (University) of Pavia was founded on 13 April 1361 by a diploma of the Emperor Charles IV, at the request of Galeazzo Visconti of Milan.Dell'Acqui, p. 15. The University Library was established in 1754 by order of the Empress Maria Theresa, who refounded the entire university which had fallen into a long decadence. In 1867 the University had 926 students.Dell'Acqui, p. 15-18. On 15 February 1743, by an Apostolic Brief of Pope Benedict XIV, the diocese of Pavia was united with the metropolitan diocese of Amaseia (Hellespont, Turkey). Thereafter the Bishop of Pavia was also an Archbishop.Ritzler-Sefrin, VI, p. 328 note 1. Gams p. 810 column 2. Cathedral and Chapter The Cathedral Chapter, in 1571, consisted of four dignities (the Provost, the Archdeacon, the Archpriest, and the Cantor) and twelve Canons.Bosisio (1859), Documenti, p. 229. On 29 February 1572, Bishop Ippolito Rossi (1564–1591), acting in accordance with the Bull In Eminenti of Pope Pius IV of 30 May 1571, suppressed the Collegiate Church of Santa Maria in Pertica in the city of Pavia, and transferred its Provost and seven Canons to the Cathedral Chapter. The title of the Provost of Santa Maria was changed to that of Dean of the Cathedral Chapter, which thereafter had five dignities and nineteen Canons.Bosisio (1859), Documenti, p. 226-237. The papal bull is quoted in its entirety in Bishop Rossi's decree. In 1672 there were five dignities and sixteen Canons.Ritzler-Sefrin, V, p. 306 note 1. On 25 April 1577 Bishop Rossi also provided new regulations for the College of Chaplains in the Cathedral. That college was led by a Prior, Mansionarii, and a Curate.Bosisio (1859), Documenti, p. 243-249. In 1110, Bishop Guido (1103–1118) granted the Cathedral Chapter of Pavia the right to the decima in the city of Pavia and for eight miles round about. This grant was confirmed by Bishop Petrus Spelta (1343–1356) on 4 November 1350.Bosisio (1859), Documenti, pp. 86-89. On 4 December 1341, Canon Mascarino Tacconi, Vicar General of Bishop Giovanni Fulgesi (1328–1342), issued Statutes for the Cathedral Chapter of Pavia.Bosisio (1859), Documenti, pp. 71-81. On 7 January and 29 March 1342, two Canons swore to observe the Statutes issued by the Bishop's Vicar. The Canons, however, became more and more lax, until the Franciscan Bishop Guilelmus (1386–1402) issued a warning on 12 January 1387 concerning certain duties which they were expected to perform, including the obligation to say Mass in the Cathedral; the Bishop's warning included penalties for failing to comply. On 7 March, the Chapter passed on the warnings to the Chaplains of the Cathedral, with extensive instructions.Bosisio (1859), Documenti, pp. 100-107. On 3 September 1484, the Cathedral Chapter on its own initiative compiled a new edition of the Statutes of the Cathedral Chapter.Bosisio (1859), Documenti, pp. 160-162. On 9 August 1507 Canon Vincenzo Beccaria, the Vicar General of the bishop Cardinal Francesco Alidosio (who was absent, serving as Papal Legate in Bologna), issued Statutes for the Canons and Chaplains of the Cathedral. The Canons themselves issued more specific regulations regarding residence and the performance of choir duties on 21 January 1518; these were confirmed on 6 February by Canon Girolamo della Porta, the Vicar General of Cardinal Antonio Ciocchi del Monte, who was not residential.Bosisio (1859), Documenti, pp. 170-176. Diocesan synods A meeting, sometimes called a synodus, was held in Pavia by the Emperor Louis II, the son of Lothair I. It was also called the Conventus Ticinensis, and was presided over by Archbishop Angilbertus of Milan, the Patriarch Theodemar of Aquileia, and Bishop Joseph the Archchaplain. Twenty-four canons regarding ecclesiastical discipline were agreed upon, and five chapters concerning political matters. Immediately thereafter, the Emperor visited Rome, where he was crowned emperor by Pope Leo IV. He held two other meetings in Pavia, with the same high ecclesiastical vassals presiding, one in February 855 and the other in July 855.Bosisio (1852), Concilia Papiensia, pp. 9-25. Bishop Guido Langasco (1295–1311) held a diocesan synod in 1297.Bosisio (1852), Concilia Papiensia, pp. 141-165. A diocesan synod was held in the Cathedral Chapter house in Pavia on 16 February 1317, during the Administratorship of Giovanni Beccaria, O.Min. (1320–1324), Latin Patriarch of Antioch (Syria). The Patriarch was not present, but was rather serving at the Papal Court in Avignon, dicto domino patriarcha administratore apud sedem apostolicam existente. The synod was therefore presided over by the Patriarch's two Vicars, the Archdeacon Bonifazio de Frascarolo and Zonfredus de Castana Canon of Monza. The decisions of the synod had mostly to do with legal matters, oaths, thieves, punishments, and with the collection of the decima.Bosisio (1852), Concilia Papiensia, pp. 166-175. Bishop Giovanni Fulgesi (1328–1342) held another synod c. 1343, with exhortations and regulations concerning the seven sacraments, burials, the preaching of indulgences, and the decima and clerical debtors.Bosisio (1852), Concilia Papiensia, pp. 176-197. In 1518 a diocesan synod was held, though the Administrator of the diocese, Cardinal Antonio Maria Ciocchi del Monte (1511–1521) did not attend. He did send a letter of thanks to his Vicar, Giovanni Luchini Curzio, who presided and gave the opening address. Among other matters, the synod legislated on the sons of priests, the cohabitation of clerics and women, and clerical non-residence (the clergy of the Cathedral being exempted).Bosisio (1852), Concilia Papiensia, pp. 254-264. A diocesan synod was held by Cardinal Ippolito Rossi (1564–1591) on 14 November 1566. On 19 July 1576, the Apostolic Visitor by the mandate of Pope Gregory XIII, Bishop Angelo Peruzzi, Auxiliary Bishop of Bologna and titular bishop of Caesarea, issued a set of decrees for the diocese of Pavia in thirty-eight chapters, on the same themes as appear regularly in diocesan statutes. These statutes, however, took account of the various decrees of the recently concluded Council of Trent. Bishop Peruzzi had previously conducted a visitation of the diocese of Modena to the satisfaction of the Pope, who then assigned him to do the same at Pavia, Piacenza, and Parma.Bosisio (1852), Concilia Papiensia, pp. 449-508. Bishop Giovanni Battista Biglia (1609–1617) held a synod in 1612. A synod was held by Bishop Francesco Biglia (1648–1659) in 1652.J. D. Mansi (ed.), Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio, editio novissima, Vol. 36 ter (Arnheim-Leipzig 1924), p. 321. Bishop Agostino Gaetano Riboldi (1877–1901) held a diocesan synod in Pavia on 10–12 September 1878, and had the decrees of the synod published.

He won two Ulster Senior Football Championship medals with the county and also won an All Star award. Houlahan played club football for Pearse Óg and won the Armagh Senior Football Championship on ? occasions with the club. He was a very prolific forward, particularly renowned for his goal-scoring ability. Houlahan was also a crowd favourite with the Armagh fans. He is known as one of Armagh's best ever players. In 2009 to mark the 125th anniversary of the Gaelic Athletic Association he was named by The Irish News as one of the all-time best 125 footballers from Ulster. Playing career Inter-county Houlahan made his Championship debut for Armagh in 1984. That year he helped Armagh reach the Ulster Senior Football Championship final, but they were beaten by Tyrone. He also suffered Ulster final defeats with the county in 1987 and 1990. Houlahan was awarded an All Star for his performances in the 1993 Championship and was also named best player of that year's Ulster Championship. Houlahan finally won an Ulster Championship medal in 1999 - making a substitute appearance in the decider against Down. He won a second Ulster title the following year.

Its product designation was TSR 9078. This 32-page book was designed by Douglas Niles, and features cover artwork by Jim Roslof. It is intended for beginning gamemasters and 5-10 player characters of level 1-3. The module contains around 20 encounters on the surface, a monastery, three dungeon levels and three new monsters. Plot summary In this scenario, the player characters must penetrate a cave labyrinth, which turns out to be a three-level dungeon where an army of goblins and hobgoblins is gathering. The scene of the action is Guido's Fort, located at the end of a road, with only the River Shrill, a mile wide, separating it from \\"The Hill\\". At the Fort, hardy bands of adventurers gather to plan their conquests of The Hill, the hulking mass that looms over this tiny settlement. They say the Hill is filled with monsters, and that an evil witch makes her home there. No visitor to The Hill has ever returned to prove the rumors true or false. Only the mighty river Shrill separates the player characters from the mysterious mountain. A series of caves awaits, full of goblins and hobgoblins. At the lowest layer lies a young red dragon. Set on a volcanic island in the midst of a river. Publication history Horror on the Hill was written by Douglas Niles, with a cover by Jim Roslof and interior art by Jim Holloway, and was published by TSR in 1983 as a 32-page booklet with an outer folder. This module is designed for use with the D&D; Basic Rules. Included in the module are 11 maps, 3 new monsters, and a complete set of prerolled characters. This module was later featured in the compilation B1-B9 In Search of Adventure in 1987. Reception Chris Hunter reviewed the module for Imagine magazine, giving it a fairly balanced review. He criticized the quality of the surface map of the hill and noted several small errors in the text, including discrepancies between the text and the maps. On the plus side, according to him, the module contains many helpful hints for the novice gamemaster. As for content, Hunter noted that it gives little detail on the Fort itself, so that it can be easily incorporated into an existing campaign. Overall, Hunter rated the module as \\"balanced and logical\\", with the notable exception of one key encounter which he thought \\"unbelievable\\". In total, Hunter expected the module should yield 3-4 sessions of play, with \\"the last one producing a few deaths\\" if all characters are 1st level. His conclusion was that: \\"Apart from the hill map and the awful title, Horror on the Hill is a worthwhile addition to the Basic scenario range.\\" Further reading Reviewed in Fantasy Gamer #6 (1984).

Since circa 2007 Iran has started constructing a border barrier as a replacement for an intermittent tattered border fence. Description The border begins at the tripoint with Afghanistan at the Kuh-i-Malik Salih mountain, then follows a straight line going south-east, then a series of mountain ridges, seasonal streams and the Tahlab river south-west to the vicinity of Hamun-e Mashkel lake. The boundary then veers sharply southwards via a series of straight lines, then east along some mountains to the Mashkil river, which it follows southwards, before reaching the Nahang river which it follows westwards. It leaves the Nahang and then goes overland via various mountains ridges and straight line segments southwards to Gwadar Bay in the Gulf of Oman. History The modern boundary cuts through the region known as Balochistan, an area long contested between various empires centred in Persia (Iran), Afghanistan and Pakistan. From the 18th century onwards the British gradually took control of most of India, including what is now Pakistan, bringing it into close proximity with lands traditionally claimed by Persia. In 1871 the British (representing the Khan of Kalat and Subcontinent) and the Persians agreed to define their mutual frontier; a boundary commission surveyed the area the following year but did not mark the border on the ground. British penetration of Balochistan, under Sir Robert Groves Sandeman, continued apace over the following decades, prompting a more precise boundary to be agreed and marked with pillars on the ground in 1895-96. Some minor alignment issues stemming from this were tidied up via another joint treaty in 1905. In 1947 Subcontinent gained independence from Britain, with the western Muslim- majority areas bordering Afghanistan and Iran becoming the new country of (West) Pakistan, which at this time also included what is now Bangladesh (East Pakistan). Iran and Pakistan confirmed their mutual border by treating in 1958-59, fully mapping the border area and demarcating it on the ground with pillars. Border barrier Map of the Iran-Pakistan border The 3 ft (91.4 cm) thick and 10 ft (3.05 m) high concrete wall, fortified with steel rods, will span the 700 km frontier stretching from Taftan to Mand. The project will include large earth and stone embankments and deep ditches to deter illegal trade crossings and drug smuggling to both side. The border region is already dotted with police observation towers and fortress-style garrisons for troops. Iran and Pakistan do not have border disputes or other irredentist claims and Pakistan's Foreign Ministry has stated, \\"Pakistan has no reservation because Iran is constructing the fence on its territory.\\" History and stated purpose The wall is being constructed to stop illegal border crossings and stem the flow of drugs, and is also a response to terror attacks, notably the one in the Iranian border town of Zahedan on February 17, 2007, which killed 13 people, including nine Iranian Revolutionary Guard officials. However Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Tasnim Aslam denied any link between the fence and the bomb blast, saying that Iran was not blaming these incidents on Pakistan. Reactions to the barrier The Foreign Ministry of Pakistan has said that Iran has the right to erect border fencing in its territory. However, opposition to the construction of the wall was raised in the Provincial Assembly of Balochistan. It maintained that the wall would create problems for the Baloch people whose lands straddle the border region. The community would become further divided politically and socially, with their trade and social activities being seriously impeded. Leader of the Opposition Kachkol Ali said the governments of the two countries had not taken the Baloch into their confidence on this matter, demanded that the construction of the wall be stopped immediately, and appealed to the international community to help the Baloch people. Border crossings On the Pakistani side, the Frontier Corps are responsible for looking after the border security and Immigration. Pakistan drives on the left hand side of the road and Iran drives on the other side. The border crossings are designed for this.

The latter creation is extant as of 2014. The Guise Baronetcy, of Elmore in the County of Gloucester, was created in the Baronetage of England on 10 July 1661 for Christopher Guise, Member of Parliament for Gloucestershire. The second Baronet also sat as Member of Parliament for Gloucestershire. The third represented Gloucestershire and Great Marlow in the House of Commons. The fourth Baronet was Member of Parliament for Aylesbury. The fifth Baronet represented Gloucestershire in Parliament. This title became extinct on his death in 1783. The Guise Baronetcy, of Highnam Court in the County of Gloucester, was created in the Baronetage of Great Britain on 9 December 1783 for John Guise, the cousin and heir male of the last Baronet of the 1661 creation. He was the great-grandson of Henry Guise, younger brother of the first baronet. The second Baronet sat as MP for Gloucestershire and Gloucestershire East. His brother General Sir John Wright Guise, 3rd Baronet, commanded a Guards battalion in the Peninsular War. The fourth, fifth, and sixth Baronets all served as High Sheriff of Gloucestershire.

Small scale quarrying began in the 1846, and by 1861, there were two companies in operation. They amalgamated in 1865, a year after the quarry was connected to the newly opened Croesor Tramway. Much money was invested in development work, but volumes of useful slate produced were small, amounting to just 226 tons in 1868. Access to the underground workings was by a single adit, and the surface mill was powered by two water wheels. A change of ownership in 1875 did little to improve the profitability of the quarry, and it closed in 1878 or 1882. In 1895, the quarry reopened under the direction of Moses Kellow, a fearless innovator who set about modernising working practices and methods. The two-man teams working in the mill were no longer tied to a two-man team working underground, which enabled the mill to operate more efficiently. Following trials with air drills, he decided instead to electrify the mill, building a large hydro-electric station, which generated three-phase alternating current, rather than the direct current recommended by British manufacturers. He obtained motors from Prague, which were used to drive winches and an electric locomotive, the first to work in Wales. The water wheels were supplemented by Pelton wheels, supplied by Gilbert Gilkes of Kendal. His greatest innovation was the Kellow drill, a hydraulic drill for which he obtained six patents between 1898 and 1915. It could drill a hole in the slate in under two minutes, much less than the day required using hand drills. The mine was ventilated by a Guibal fan, housed in a fan-house near the entrance to the adit. Peak output under Kellow's direction was between 5,000 and 6,000 tons per year, though it declined in the later years, until the quarry closed in 1930. The chambers were used by Cookes Explosives to store propellants from the late 1940s until the early 1970s. This ceased when the Central Electricity Generating Board became aware of it, and feared that an underground explosion would damage the dams of the Ffestiniog pumped storage power station. Both lakes were drained until the explosives had been removed. The quarry was worked on seven levels, but the three below the adit level are now flooded. There was an underground link to the nearby Rhosydd quarry, and the \\"Croesor Rhosydd Through Trip\\" is a well known, if somewhat dangerous, route for mine explorers.  History  Slate was quarried on a small scale at Croesor from around 1840, and the Croicer Valley & Portmadoc Freehold Slate Company Ltd was set up soon afterwards, but did not last for long. Early phase Two companies were working the slate by 1861, the Croesor Fawr Slate Quarrying Company Ltd, and the Upper Croesor Slate Quarry Company Ltd. There was close cooperation between them, as in 1865, the Upper company allowed the Fawr company to tip slate waste on their land, and they amalgamated in the following year. At the same time, the Croesor United Slate Company Ltd was set up, with a working capital of £160,000, and a lease to look for slate on Croesor Fawr farm. They also took over the lease held by the Upper company. Hugh Beaver Roberts was in charge of the new company, while Hugh Unsworth McKie was in charge of the Upper company. Both men were directors of the Croesor & Port Madoc Railway, effectively the lower section of the Croesor Tramway below the incline at Carreg-hylldrem. The Managing Director of the new company was James Wyatt, formerly the agent for the Penrhyn quarry, near Bethesda. After 30 June 1867, the chairman was T H Wyatt, and McKie became the manager and secretary. Between 1868 and 1869, Beaumont, Appleby & Ashwell, a company from London, worked on a contract to cut shafts and tunnels. The rock found was of poor quality, but hopeful that a slate vein of \\"paying quality\\" might yet be found, the directors issued debentures to raise additional money to fund the 110 men who were engaged on the development work. Progress below ground was slow, as a band of hard chert was encountered. Beaumont, Appleby & Ashwell were replaced by the Machine Tunnelling Company, and in June 1872, by the Diamond Rock-boring Company. The work was hampered by water flowing into the mine faster than it could be pumped out, and in 1873 the shareholders declined to advance any more money. The Directors decided to wind up the company, and create The Croesor Slate Company, to take over. However, the machinery was removed, and attempts were made to sell the quarry in April and July 1875. With so much development work, and little good quality rock, the undertaking was not economic. In 1868, the cost of producing slates was nine times greater than at Penrhyn Quarry, and whereas they produced 9,000 tons a month, Croesor only produced 226 tons. In December 1875, the Croesor New Slate Company Ltd took over the workings, eight cottages for the quarrymen, the workshops, and the incline which connected the quarry to the Croesor Tramway, and hence to the slate wharves at Porthmadog. They had a working capital of £45,000, but despite the expertise of Thomas Williams, the new manager who has previously managed the Penrhyn quarry, the company failed. The date is uncertain, as Boyd quotes December 1882, while Richards quotes 1878. Prior to the opening of the Croesor Tramway, slate was carried by horse and cart to Penrhyndeudraeth station on the Ffestiniog Railway. In order to improve the journey, a long straight road, which now forms part of the A4085, was built south from Garreg by the quarry company. When the Croesor Tramway opened in 1864, a long incline was built from the quarry to the valley floor, and carriage by railway reduced transport costs from 7s 10.5d (39p) per ton to 2s 6.5d (12.5p). The mill was constructed in the early 1860s, and was powered by a diameter water wheel which drove about 12 slate saws. In 1866, the mill was extended, to provide another 12 or 14 saws. Power came from another water wheel, constructed underground, and fed by the tailrace of the first wheel. It was in diameter, and backup power was provided by a steam engine. The shafting for the machinery was under the floor, as was a tramway for trucks to remove the cutting waste. A sale notice dating from 1874 indicated that in addition to sawing tables, there were also planing tables, slate dressing machines, two steam locomotives and stables. The locomotives were vertical-boilered tank engines with vertical cylinders, manufactured by De Winton of Caernarfon. One of them was later sold to the Coedmadoc Slate Company of Nantlle. Late phase Kellow's Blaencwm power station, once again generating power after a period as an outdoor pursuits centre. The incline to the right led to two further inclines, one to Croesor and the other to Rhosydd. Details of the next period are sketchy, although Boyd states that the quarry was bought by S Pope of Llanbedr on 7 July 1883, and became part of the Parc & Croesor Slate Quarries Company Ltd, which was formed on 21 August 1895. The amalgamation with the Park Quarry, which was located near the Garreg Hylldrem inclines further down the Croesor valley, was arranged by Moses Kellow, whose uncle, Joseph Kellow, had briefly been the agent and quarry engineer for the Conglog quarry in the 1870s. The quarry had been managed by Thomas Williams of Bryn, Croesor for many years, and Kellow had married Williams' daughter Nell in 1892. Williams died around 1895, and Kellow took over the management of the quarry, having had plans to reopen it for some years. Parc Quarry made slate ridging, and the amalgamation was made so that rather than supplying the ridging with slates from other quarries, he could supply it with slates from his own quarry. Kellow was known as a \\"fearless innovator\\", and set about modernising the quarry operation. The first problem that he faced was that the quarry below the level of the main adit had filled with water in the 17 years that it had been closed. Twelve chambers were submerged, and there were two sumps each holding some of water. Local opinion was that a new tunnel, at the level of the lowest chamber, would need to be cut, and a London-based engineer had calculated that pulsometer pumps could empty it in about six months. As the rails on the main incline to the lower chambers were still in place, Kellow mounted a large centrifugal pump on a platform, which he lowered down the rails as water levels fell. It could pump per hour, and he drained the entire quarry in around a week. His innovation also covered working practices. Traditionally, Welsh slate mines were worked by teams of four men, consisting of two rockmen, who worked in a chamber below ground, and two mill men, who processed the slate blocks produced by the rockmen. Kellow introduced a new system, in which two-man teams of rockmen supplied slabs to the mill, where independent two-man teams worked, who were allocated slabs by ballot. This enabled the mill to be run at full capacity most of the time, with productivity rising by 25 per cent in the first month after it was introduced. Initial resistance from the quarrymen was overcome as they saw their wages rising significantly. Kellow introduced compressed air drills, which were fed by a small water-powered compressor located near the foot of the incline to the nearby Rhosydd quarry. He also decided to construct a low-level adit, and work began on it, using the new air drills. A section of incline was built, to be used to counterbalance the trucks removing the spoil, but the adit was not completed. The water wheels were supplemented by Pelton wheels, and Kellow, writing in 1911, described four high-pressure turbines, producing . Water to supply the turbines was obtained from two reservoirs, one located at above sea level and covering , and a second covering at . Water was also taken from a natural lake at . Electrification After initial experiments with electricity in the late 1890s, Kellow planned the electrification of the quarry in 1901. By utilising the reservoir in the Cwm Foel valley, located at above sea level, and siting the generating station near the foot of the incline up to the quarry, he obtained a head of to drive his large hydro-electric turbines. Standard British practice at the time was to use 550-volt direct current for such work, but Kellow thought this was too high for distribution underground, and the cost of cabling for a lower voltage system was prohibitive. He found references to a new system of three-phase alternating current, but was unable to find British manufacturers who thought it was sensible, or who would make equipment to work with it. He produced a full specification for a three-phase plant in 1902, and toured Europe, talking to electrical manufacturers, who he found more supportive of his plans. He bought the equipment from Kolben and Company of Prague. It consisted of a 250kVa alternator, which he would couple to a 375 hp pelton wheel impulse turbine. A separate 25 hp impulse turbine supplied the exciter circuit, providing good voltage regulation, and it provided enough spare power to light and heat his house. Power was generated at just below 3000 volts, and transformed down to 220 volts between phases at the point of use. The quarry was lit by electricity, using 2000-candlepower arc lamps, and he installed reversible winches, which were driven by motors. They could raise 3-ton blocks, when they were being loaded onto trucks, and had a high speed mode, which was used when the blocks were dragged across the floor. For the haulage of trucks along the main adit, he introduced a mining locomotive, the first electric locomotive to work in Wales. It was a 4-wheel design, picking up power from an overhead wire, and is thought to have been built in the quarry workshops. The Pelton wheels were supplied by Gilbert Gilkes and Company Ltd of Kendal, as were the ones which supplemented the water wheels. Innovation Other innovations included a new type of planing machine which he invented, which worked between six and ten times faster than traditional designs. Removal of water form the mine was improved by the installation of centrifugal pumps, capable of pumping per minute. Productivity was improved by the replacement of hand-drills with another of Kellow's inventions. His Kellow drill used high pressure water, produced no dust, and could drill a hole in under two minutes, instead of the ten hours required when a hand-drill was used. At the time, percussive drills powered by compressed air were being introduced in many quarries, but Kellow disliked them because they were very noisy, created clouds of dust, and were uncomfortable to the men who had to use them for long periods. His drill was basically a twist drill, similar to those used to drill wood or metal. In order to hold it against the rock face, two small holes were drilled to a depth of , into which two rods on the drill were inserted, and jacked apart to secure it. The drill was powered by a small Pelton wheel, supplied with water at , equivalent to a head of . He obtained a patent for the design in 1898, the year in which he introduced the drills to the quarry. The drills were still noisy, and discharged the spent water into the quarry, typically in the 90 seconds it took to drill a hole. Kellow later collaborated with Gilbert Gilkes on improved designs for his drills, and Gilkes later became a director of the Kellow Rock Drill Syndicate Ltd, set up in 1908, but they parted company because Gilkes thought that Kellow was too much of a perfectionist, unwilling to listen to advice from an expert in the field of turbines. Kellow's next patent, obtained in 1906, included recycling of the water, which was fed through a inner flexible pipe, running through the middle of a outer pipe, through which the spent water was returned to the sump from which the drill was supplied. Despite the complexity of the hose, the unions which held lengths together were watertight under . The new design was also much quieter than the old. Next he redesigned the bit, which used a replaceable D-shaped cutter, making it much easier to manufacture than a twist-bit, and this was covered by a patent obtained in 1910. Some water was fed through the drill to lubricate and cool the cutting surfaces. Two further patents from 1914 covered an improved gearbox and a redesigned two-stage reaction turbine, and another in 1915 covered an improved feed cylinder. This supplied the forward thrust to the drill bit, typically 2 to 3 tons for drilling slate, although trials on granite had used up to 20 tons. No data is available for earlier drills, but for the later ones, the turbine ran at 5,000 rpm and the drill at 250 rpm. The Kellow Rock Drill Syndicate converted the original slate mill, dating from 1861, into a workshop called Keldril Works, where the drills were made. It was about , but burnt down between 1910 and 1912. The insurance company wrote off the machinery, as the roof had fallen onto it, but all of it was subsequently rescued from the wreckage. Some of it was moved to the old fitting shop, and some to the Blaencwm power station, where it continued to be used until the quarry closed in 1930. Reuse for storage Following the end of the Second World War, the quarry was operated by Cookes Explosive, a local firm based at Penrhyndeudraeth, who used its underground chambers to store explosives, mainly propellants. The adit was worked by three Ruston & Hornsby 4-wheeled diesel mechanical locomotives, originally built in 1939 and 1941, and obtained second-hand. Two had been scrapped or sold by 1955, and the date of disposal of the third is unknown. Several buildings were constructed in the marshalling area at the far end of the adit, and a massive haulage winch partially blocked access to the incline to the levels above. In 1971, the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB), operators of the Ffestiniog pumped storage power station, became aware of this use, and calculated that if there was an explosion underground, either of their two dams could be damaged. They therefore drained both reservoirs, and Cookes began removing about 250 tons of explosives per week, which were taken to Penrhyndeudraeth or by rail from Blaenau Ffestiniog railway station to various other ICI Nobel works in the United Kingdom. Blaencwm power station continued in operation after the quarry closed, supplying electricity to the national grid until the 1950s, when it was closed. The dam on Llyn Cwm-y-foel was breached, much of the pipeline was removed, and the building became an outdoor pursuits centre. In 1999, National Power Hydro refurbished it as part of a £1 million project, which included the provision of a new underground pipeline from the reservoir, and underground cables to connect it to the national grid. It is capable of generating 500 kW, and the work was carried out as part of the government's renewable energy programme. The power station was formally opened by local MP Elfyn Llwyd on 26 November 1999. In the early 1970s the quarry was purchased by the Ffestiniog Slate Company with a view to reopening it as a working slate mine. Planning permission for this was not granted and in the later 1970s most of the remaining mine infrastructure was removed for use in the Oakeley Quarry, also owned by the Ffestiniog Slate Company.  Current conditions  Final and most awkward crossing in the Croesor to Rhosydd through trip Croesor is connected to the nearby Rhosydd quarry by a tunnel that was built to aid surveying and settle boundary disputes. Apart from Chamber 1 East, a huge chamber in which the roof has collapsed, most of the accessible mine is in reasonable condition. Below the adit level, the mine is flooded and inaccessible. In spite of a series of collapses, particularly in the Rhosydd quarry, an underground journey from Croesor to Rhosydd is still possible and is considered to be a classic trip for mine explorers. It is known as the Croesor-Rhosydd Through Trip. Fixed ropes, home-made suspension bridges, zip wires, and inflatable boats have been installed which make it possible to complete the journey in comfort although not necessarily in safety. Geology The Ffestiniog region contains five major slate veins, which are on top of a thick layer of feldspathic porphyry, called the \\"Glanypwll Trap\\". The veins are the New or Deep Vein, the Old Vein, the Small Vein, the Back Vein and the North Vein. At Croesor, the Old Vein is accessible, and dips downwards at about 27 degrees. It is around wide, at right angles to the bedding plane, and over horizontally. Description The main adit was relatively large, and ran for to reach an underground marshalling area. This level was designated as floor A.An incline led up from floor A to floors B to D Up, and there were a further three floors below floor A, designated as floors B to D Down. Another incline connected B and C Down to the marshalling area, and a separate incline connected floors C and D Down.  Unusual Features  Croesor is notable amongst Welsh slate quarries for being almost entirely underground, with no significant surface workings. It was rare in its extensive use of forced air ventilation instead of the more common natural ventilation used in most slate mines. It also generated relatively small external waste tips compared with the volume of finished slates produced; this was largely achieved by back-filling underground chambers with waste once they were exhausted. Operation Output in the early years was quite low, but following Kellow's innovations, was between 5,000 and 6,000 tons per year but then declined until the quarry closed. At its peak, around 300 men were employed there, of whom some 70 stayed in barracks. Forced ventilation was used, and a large fan house was constructed near the entrance to the adit. It housed a Guibal fan, although described by Richards as a Guiblas fan, and experiments were also carried out with waterblast ventilation, using a vertical shaft between the chambers and the hillside. The Guibal fan was patented in Belgium by Guibal in 1862, and its spiral case which surrounded the fan blades made it much superior to previous open-fan designs. Such fans were used extensively for mine ventilation throughout Britain. Transport The quarry's produce were distributed from Porthmadog (sometimes anglisised as Portmadoc), a harbour on the Glaslyn Estuary. In 1865, the Croesor Tramway was built which connected various quarries in the Cwm Croesor (including the Croesor quarry) to Portmadoc, making transport easier.

Background CCAN Director Mike Tidwell on Quirauk Mountain advocating for clean energy The Chesapeake Climate Action Network was officially launched on July 1, 2002, with a seed grant from the Rockefeller Brothers Fund. For more than a year prior to that date, Director Mike Tidwell was organizing and advocating around global warming issues in the Washington Metropolitan Area. Principle among these early activities was the conversion of Tidwell's home almost entirely to renewable energy and the initiation of Saturday open houses every other month. These clean energy open houses drew early supporters to the cause and helped launch CCAN’s email and networking database. Since its inception, the Chesapeake Climate Action Network has been central to every climate and clean energy victory in Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. Working with a large and growing network of allies, the group has helped pass the Offshore Wind Bill in Maryland, one of the strongest statewide carbon caps in the country in Maryland, Clean Cars bills in Maryland and the District of Columbia, renewable energy standard bills in Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. Through litigation, the Chesapeake Climate Action Network has helped reduce mercury pollution from a coal power plant in Wise County, Virginia, by 94 percent. The organization was also instrumental in shutting down several of the region's coal plants and preventing the construction of new fossil fuel projects.

Witless Protection received negative reviews from critics and was a commercial flop, grossing $4.1 million against a $7.5 million budget.  Plot  Larry Stalder is a small-town deputy who dreams of becoming an FBI agent. He witnesses what he believes is a kidnapping and rushes to rescue a woman named Madeleine. The \\"kidnappers\\" turn out to be FBI agents assigned to protect her and deliver her to a big Enron-type corruption trial in Chicago. After the misunderstanding is cleared, Larry attempts to deliver Madeleine to the agents and get a commendation letter from them until he discovers that they're corrupted. It's later revealed that they work for Arthur Grimsley, the criminal whom Madeleine is going to testify against, who also dumped her. While spending the night at a motel, Larry and Madeleine are found by the agents and escape. During their journey, they discover that the evidence against Arthur, contained within a disc, was stolen and is inside a safe in Arthur's mansion. After evading capture from Wilford Duvall, Arthur's head of security, they manage to keep the villains off track by faking Madeleine's death. Arriving in Chicago, Larry enters a charity polo match to get invited to a ball at Arthur's mansion. He manages to beat Arthur, who at first denies to invite him to the ball until Larry convinces him otherwise. At the ball, Larry searches for the disc while Madeleine dances with Arthur to distract him. During the search, Larry encounters and defeats Wilford in the display room of the mansion. He then bargains with one of the corrupted FBI agents to let him go, in exchange for the money in the safe. After getting the disc, Larry and Madeleine manage to escape after Arthur easily deduces her identity and holds her hostage, forcing Larry to give him the disc to save Madeleine. It is later revealed that the disc Larry gave to Arthur was a video of him singing his favorite country song. After sending Arthur to prison, Larry is offered to join the FBI but he turns it down. He and Madeleine say goodbye and part ways. Upon returning home, Larry becomes the new town sheriff and celebrates with his girlfriend Connie.

Filming also took place in numerous towns in Illinois including Elmhurst, Lombard, Lemont, Sugar Grove, Glen Ellyn, Vernon Hills, Westmont and Yorkville. Reception Critical response Witless Protection received near unanimously negative reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 4% based on 28 reviews, with an average rating of 2.12/10. The site's consensus states: \\"Larry the Cable Guy continues his critical losing streak with this insipid, tasteless caper comedy.\\" On Metacritic it has an average score of 17 out of 100, based on 6 reviews. Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: \\"[I]n the press notes for Larry the Cable Guy's latest comedy, his co-stars are quoted at length describing the constant hilarity they experienced on the set. Unfortunately for filmgoers, little of that fun has made its way into the finished product, which makes his previous effort, Delta Farce, seem a classic by comparison.\\" John Anderson of Variety criticized the film for carrying a \\"nasty edge\\" to its brand of blue- collar comedy aimed at Bush supporters and the misuse of McCarthy and Mantegna in embarrassing roles, concluding that, \\"One can only hope that Witless Protection is targeted at a vanishing species of American Neanderthal. In the meantime, perhaps Larry and his accomplices at Lionsgate could take some sensitivity training.\\" Matt Zoller Seitz, writing for The New York Times, said \\"[T]he film's writer and director, Charles Robert Carner, is working on a critic-proof franchise and knows it; the slapstick and action set pieces are lame, and its performances range from competent to annoying.\\" Steven Hyden of The A.V.

He played six seasons of Major League Baseball as a left-handed pitcher for the Detroit Wolverines (1883–1884), Boston Reds (1884), Providence Grays (1885), and Washington Nationals (1886–1888). Shaw won 30 games in 1884 and 23 in 1885, but never won more than 13 games in any other season and lost 33 games in 1884 and 31 in 1886. He compiled a career record of 83–121 with a 3.10 earned run average (ERA). Shaw had an unusual windmill delivery and claimed to have been the first pitcher to use a wind-up before throwing the ball. Some attributed his success in striking out batters to his confusing delivery. He once struck out the great slugger, Orator Shafer, five times in a single game, and in 1884, he struck out 451 batters, a total that remains the fourth highest total in major league history. He also holds the major league record for the most strikeouts, 18, in a game as the losing pitcher. He also pitched a no-hitter on October 7, 1885, though the game has not qualified as an official no-hitter since 1991 because it lasted only five innings. Early years Shaw was born in 1859 in the Charlestown section of Boston. Before playing professional baseball, he played first base for an amateur baseball team in Charlestown. His teammates on the Charlestown team included Thomas Shea, who later became a famous ragtime composer, John Clarkson, who was later inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame, and Mertie Hackett. Professional career Wind-up Shaw claimed to have been \\"the first pitcher to wind up preparatory to delivering the ball.\\" Alfred Henry Spink, founder of The Sporting News, described Shaw's wind-up as follows:\\" > After considerable swinging and scratching around with his feet, during > which he would deliver a lengthy speech to the batter, to the effect that he > was the best pitcher on earth and the batter a dub, he would stretch both > arms at full length over his head. Then after gazing fixedly at the first > baseman for a moment, he would wheel half around and both arms would fly > apart like magic... [H]e would wind his left arm around again and let the > ball fly, running at the same time all the way from the box to the home > plate. Another account describes Shaw's delivery this way: \\"Shaw had a very peculiar preliminary motion. He was a regular jumping jack in the box, for then the pitcher had more space in the box than now and were not obliged to face the batter.\\" After his first game for the Providence Grays, the Sporting Life wrote: \\"Shaw made a successful debut and promises to be a valuable man. He has a series of introductory motions in order to get an impulse to the ball, which mystifies the batsman and conceals its pace, and will probably be a terror to left-hand hitters.\\" Alfred Spink wrote that Shaw's swinging delivery caused \\"a genuine sensation,\\" prompting baseball writers to call him \\"a monkey, a mountebank and other harsh names,\\" but \\"Shaw paid no attention to the knocks and went right on fooling the batsmen.\\" Shaw replied to criticism, \\"Yes, I know I am nutty, but I am getting away with my games. I was bitten by a fox once.\\" His wind-up was said to confuse batsmen and reportedly aided him in striking out the great slugger Orator Shafer five times in one game. In addition to his complex wind-up, Shaw was also known for a further peculiarity in never stepping into the pitcher's box except from the rear.(\\"Dupee Shaw, the eccentric twirler, would never step into the pitcher's box except from the rear.\\") One account suggests that it was the eccentric behavior of Dupee that created the long-running baseball stereotype that left-handed pitchers were \\"the 'nuts' of the game.\\" Detroit Shaw began his professional baseball career with the Detroit Wolverines, making his major league debut in June 1883. That year, he appeared in 26 games for Detroit, including 23 complete games, and compiled a 10–15 record with a 2.50 earned run average (ERA). During a game in Boston in September 1883, Shaw's friends from Charlestown presented the rookie twirler with an elegant, inscribed gold watch, chain and charm. Shaw remained with the Detroit club at the start of the 1884 season. He appeared in 28 games, 25 of them complete games, and compiled a 9–18 record with a 2.30 ERA. Midway through the season, Shaw jumped to the Boston Reds of the recently formed Union Association. Shaw had become the Wolverines' number one pitcher and was the first National League star to jump to the Union Association. Shaw was interviewed 40 years later about his decision to jump leagues. Detroit fans, he recalled, held a grudge against him for leaving them mid-season for the lure of more money. When Shaw returned to Detroit in later years, he was heckled by fans with comments such as, \\"Oh, Shaw, how's your liver?\\", or \\"What'll you sell for?\\" Shaw claimed that his real reason for jumping leagues was the bad treatment he received from Detroit's player/manager Jack Chapman. In Shaw's final game for Detroit, the Wolverines led by one run in the ninth inning, but two errors (one by Ned Hanlon in center field) allowed two runs to score. In the clubhouse after the loss, Chapman went on at length blaming Shaw without saying a word to the players whose errors contributed to the loss. Shaw recalled: \\"Finally I said, 'All right. I lost the ball game. But this is the last ball game I'll ever lose for Detroit.' And it was. I packed my belongings and that night I started for Boston. I applied for a job and got it.\\" Boston After making the jump to the Union Association, Shaw appeared in an additional 39 games for Boston, including 35 complete games, and compiled a 21–15 record. Over the course of the full 1884 season, both with Detroit and Boston, Shaw compiled a 30-33 record and threw 60 complete games. He also struck out 451 batters, a total that remains the fourth highest single season strikeout total in major league history. Shaw also set a major league record for the most strikeouts in a game as a losing pitcher. On July 19, 1884, he threw a one-hitter against the St. Louis Maroons and struck out 18 batters, but lost the game by a 1–0 score. Shaw's 1884 average of 8.81 strikeouts per nine innings also broke the existing major league record. Providence In 1885, after the collapse of the Union Association, Shaw paid a $1,000 fine and was allowed to return to the National League as a member of the Providence Grays. On October 7, 1885, Shaw pitched a no-hitter against the Buffalo Bisons in a five-inning game. No-hitters pitched under such circumstances were counted before 1991, but no longer count as official no-hitters because nine innings were not completed. In all, Shaw pitched 49 games for Providence, including 47 complete games, and compiled a 23–26 record with a 2.57 ERA. Playing a full season against National League batters, Shaw's strikeout total dropped by more than 50% to 194. The 1885 Providence team as a whole finished the season in fourth place with a 53-57 record. Washington In 1886, and for the second straight year, Shaw was faced with the dilemma of having played for a team, this time Providence, that folded after the season had ended. The National League assumed control of the Providence players and assigned most of them, including Shaw, to the newly formed team in Washington, D.C. Shaw was unhappy with his assignment to Washington and insisted on being paid more than the league's maximum salary if he was to play there. A contract was eventually worked out, and Shaw appeared in 45 games for Washington during the 1886 season, threw 43 complete games, and compiled a 13–31 record with a 3.34 ERA and 177 strikeouts. The Washington team as a whole finished in last place with a 28-92 record. In 1887, Shaw lost his role as the Nationals' number one starter but still appeared in 21 games with 20 complete games. He compiled a 7–13 record and saw his ERA soar to 6.45. In June 1887, The Evening Star of Washington, D.C., suggested a new nickname for Shaw: \\"It is now 'Looney' instead of 'Dupee' Shaw. Perhaps there's method in his madness.\\" In September 1887, the Boston Courier concluded that Shaw's career was at end, writing: > Dupee Shaw has been the enigma of the Washington team. They have laid him > off, suspended and fined him. They said he was indifferent and crooked. He > is a queer fellow. His day is gone by, and that is about all there is to it. In 1888, Shaw appeared in only three games for Washington, all complete games, and compiled an 0–3 record with a 6.48 ERA. His final major league appearance was against the Indianapolis Hoosiers on July 17, 1888. Comeback attempts Shaw was 29 when he pitched his final major league game. He made several attempts at a comeback, but arm problems appear to have prevented him from returning to the major leagues. In 1889, he signed with, and played for, the Newark Little Giants of the Atlantic Association. In May 1890, he received an offer to play for Brooklyn Ward's Wonders in the Players' League, but said he could not accept an offer until he was satisfied that his arm was \\"strong enough to stand the strain through the season.\\" Finally, in March 1892, Shaw, at age 32, announced that he had \\"most of the 'crystal' out of his arm and will be in condition soon to accept advance money.\\" There is no indication that any major league responded to Shaw's 1892 claim of readiness. However, Shaw did return briefly to the minor leagues in 1894 with a team from Haverhill, Massachusetts, in the New England League, and then in 1896 with the Lancaster Maroons of the Class A Atlantic League. Shaw appeared in two games for Lancaster and compiled an 0-2 record with a 4.50 ERA and allowing nine runs (only five earned) in ten innings pitched. Later years After retiring from baseball, Dupee lived in the Boston area and was successful in business there. At the time of the 1900 United States Census, he was employed as a bartender in Boston, and in 1910, he was a grocer there. He also continued to follow baseball and to participate in \\"old timers\\" games in Boston. He died at age 78 in Wakefield, Massachusetts, and was interred at Glenwood Cemetery in Everett, Massachusetts.
