Life He was second son of Sir Anthony St Leger by his wife Agnes, daughter of Sir Hugh Warham, brother of Archbishop William Warham, and was born probably about 1525. His eldest brother, William, was disinherited; the third brother, Anthony , was made Master of the Rolls in Ireland in 1593. Warham may have served in Protector Somerset's invasion of Scotland in 1547, and he was a prisoner there until January 1550, when he was ransomed. In 1553 he fought against supporters of Wyatt's rebellion in Kent, and he may have served in Ireland under his father during Mary's reign. About 1559 he was named a commissioner to transfer to England John Bale's manuscripts and books. In 1560 he was sheriff of Kent. He was soon a member of the Privy Council of Ireland, and in July 1565 he was knighted. Queen Elizabeth had decided to establish a presidential government in Munster, and in January 1566 St Leger was nominated President of Munster, but locally by Sir Henry Sidney, the Lord Deputy of Ireland; he received instructions dated 1 February, and in the following month was given command of all the levies in Munster. Elizabeth, however, refused to confirm St Leger's appointment. The reason was that St Leger was a bitter enemy of Thomas Butler, 10th Earl of Ormond, and correspondingly friendly with Gerald Fitzgerald, 15th Earl of Desmond; and the queen accused St Leger of lukewarmness in arresting Desmond early in 1565. St Leger was consequently recalled, and in November 1568 Sir John Perrot became president of Munster. In 1569 St Leger returned to England, residing at his house in Southwark or Leeds Castle, Kent, and serving as High Sheriff of Kent for 1560. There from 1570 to 1572 he had custody of Desmond and his family (see Desmond Rebellions). He left his wife at Carrigaline, County Cork, a manor he held from Desmond; during his absence it was ravaged by the rebels. He remained in England until 1579, when his repeated petitions for employment and reward were answered by his appointment as provost-marshal of Munster, a new office, the functions of which seem to have been purely military. In this capacity St Leger was actively engaged against the Irish rebels for ten years. On 7 April 1583 he was appointed an assistant to the court of high commission in Ireland, and in the following year he visited England. While there he accused Ormond of treason, and laid before the queen proposals for the government of Ireland. In November 1589 he was succeeded, probably on account of his old age, as provost-marshal by George Thornton, but in 1590 he was governing Munster in the absence of the vice-president. He was in England again in 1594, and died at Cork in 1597. His will is in the Heralds' College, London. Marriages and issue St Leger married firstly Ursula Neville (d. 1575), fifth and youngest daughter of George Neville, 5th Baron Bergavenny, by his third wife, Mary Stafford, youngest daughter of Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham, by whom he had five sons and four daughters, including:.. *Sir Anthony St Leger (d. 1603),. who succeeded to the estates at Ulcombe, Kent. He married Mary Scott (d. 1662), the daughter of Sir Thomas Scott. Their son, Warham St Leger (d. 11 October 1631),. who was knighted in 1608, married Mary Hayward, the daughter of Sir Rowland Hayward, by whom he had nine sons and four daughters.. He sold Leeds Castle, went with Walter Ralegh to Guyana, and died 11 October 1631, leaving a son Sir Anthony Leger (d. 1680), who was made Master of the Mint in 1660. *Anne St Leger (1555–1636), who married Thomas Digges and was mother of Sir Dudley Digges.. St Leger married secondly Emmeline Goldwell (d. 1628), by whom he had a son Walter,. who obtained his father's Irish property. The Warham St Leger who died in combat in 1600 against Hugh Maguire (Lord of Fermanagh) was his nephew. Sir Warham St Leger was the ancestor of the St Legers of Hayward’s Hill near Cork and of the St Legers of Ballingarry and Shinrone in co. Tipperary, Ireland.

Birmingham City FC takeover In 2007, GIH bought 29.9% of shares in the English Premier League football club Birmingham City F.C.. They followed this with an offer to buy the club, but failed to meet the completion deadline of 22 December. In Summer 2009, GIH made another offer to buy the club, taking full control from 1 October in an £81.5million deal. It became the intention of Grandtop, subject to shareholder approval, to change the company name to Birmingham International Holdings Limited. The ownership has changed over the years. In March 2011, new shares were issued (from 3,187,753,400 to 3,637,753,400), of which Carson Yeung held 16.25% and in April, Yeung through his British Virgin Islands (BVI) company, bought 315,000,000 shares from the public, meaning he owned 24.91%. On 4 May, extra new shares - issued to independent third parties - made Yeung's ratio decrease to 23.3%. However, on 12 May Yeung's company bought 170,000,000 shares, meaning he owned a total of 26.31%. The total shares owned by other major shareholders Vico Hui and Liu Xingcheng () remained unchanged, but the ratio changed in 2011. Although Yeung bought the shares of the company, he also injected other business into the company, meaning he received money from the company. Yeung was arrested in 2011 for money laundering. On 4 June 2012, Birmingham International Holdings announced that former England footballer Steve McManaman and Yang Yuezhou had resigned as executive directors. The latter was also deputy chairman.Yeung told to hand over Peak house The Standard. 5 June 2012. Takeover by Trillion Trophy Asia Ltd. On Monday 17 October 2016, Birmingham International Holdings Limited began trading once again on the Hong Kong stock exchange after a takeover fronted by Paul Suen, and his company Trillion Trophy Asia (TTA). TTA bought 60.78% of BIH through Ernst & Young, receivers who were acting on behalf of the board of BIH. This left Carson Yeung with around 6% of the shares of BIH. Mr. Suen had already provided Birmingham City Plc with a loan facility capable of continuing their existence and to bring the football club out of financial uncertainty. In February 2017 the company announced that board wishes to change the company name to Birmingham Sports Holdings Ltd. On 6 April 2017, the company name was changed to Birmingham Sports Holdings. Australia and Western Melbourne Group It was revealed in February 2019 that BSH had been a part of the newly formed Western Melbourne FC club in the Australian A-League competition, initially funding the bid's license fee, but reportedly pulling out of the project due to a down turn in the Australian housing market that devalued the intended housing developments that were to be built in the same area as their new stadium.

A widely distributed species, it grows naturally in eastern North America, East Asia, and Central America; it has also been reported in southern France. L. indigo grows on the ground in both deciduous and coniferous forests, where it forms mycorrhizal associations with a broad range of trees. The fruit body color ranges from dark blue in fresh specimens to pale blue-gray in older ones. The milk, or latex, that oozes when the mushroom tissue is cut or broken — a feature common to all members of the genus Lactarius — is also indigo blue, but slowly turns green upon exposure to air. The cap has a diameter of , and the stem is tall and thick. It is an edible mushroom, and is sold in rural markets in China, Guatemala, and Mexico. Taxonomy and nomenclature Originally described in 1822 as Agaricus indigo by American mycologist Lewis David de Schweinitz, the species was later transferred to the genus Lactarius in 1838 by the Swede Elias Magnus Fries. German botanist Otto Kuntze called it Lactifluus indigo in his 1891 treatise Revisio Generum Plantarum, but the suggested name change was not adopted by others. Hesler and Smith in their 1960 study of North American species of Lactarius defined L. indigo as the type species of subsection Caerulei, a group characterized by blue latex and a sticky, blue cap. In 1979, they revised their opinions on the organization of subdivisions in the genus Lactarius, and instead placed L. indigo in subgenus Lactarius based on the color of latex, and the subsequent color changes observed after exposure to air.Hesler and Smith (1979), p. 66. As they explained: > The gradual development of blue to violet pigmentation as one progresses > from species to species is an interesting phenomenon deserving further > study. The climax is reached in L. indigo which is blue throughout. L. > chelidonium and its variety chelidonioides, L. paradoxus, and L. hemicyaneus > may be considered as mileposts along the road to L. indigo.Hesler and Smith > (1979), p. 7. The specific epithet indigo is derived from the Latin word meaning \\"indigo blue\\". Its names in the English vernacular include the \\"indigo milk cap\\", the \\"indigo Lactarius\\", the \\"blue milk mushroom\\", and the \\"blue Lactarius\\". In central Mexico, it is known as añil, azul, hongo azul, zuin, and zuine; it is also called quexque (meaning \\"blue\\") in Veracruz and Puebla. Description Like many other mushrooms, L. indigo develops from a nodule, that forms within the underground mycelium, a mass of threadlike fungal cells called hyphae that make up the bulk of the organism. Under appropriate environmental conditions of temperature, humidity, and nutrient availability, the visible reproductive structures (fruit bodies) are formed. The cap of the fruit body, measuring between in diameter, is initially convex and later develops a central depression; in age it becomes even more deeply depressed, becoming somewhat funnel-shaped as the edge of the cap lifts upward.Hesler and Smith (1979), p. 27. The margin of the cap is rolled inwards when young, but unrolls and elevates as it matures. The cap surface is indigo blue when fresh, but fades to a paler grayish- or silvery-blue, sometimes with greenish splotches. It is often zonate: marked with concentric lines that form alternating pale and darker zones, and the cap may have dark blue spots, especially towards the edge. Young caps are sticky to the touch.The flesh is pallid to bluish in color, slowly turning greenish after being exposed to air; its taste is mild to slightly acrid. The flesh of the entire mushroom is brittle, and the stem, if bent sufficiently, will snap open cleanly. The latex exuded from injured tissue is indigo blue, and stains the wounded tissue greenish; like the flesh, the latex has a mild taste. Lactarius indigo is noted for not producing as much latex as other Lactarius species, and older specimens in particular may be too dried out to produce any latex. The gills of the mushroom range from adnate (squarely attached to the stem) to slightly decurrent (running down the length of the stem), and crowded close together. Their color is an indigo blue, becoming paler with age or staining green with damage. The stem is tall by thick, and the same diameter throughout or sometimes narrowed at base. Its color is indigo blue to silvery- or grayish blue. The interior of the stem is solid and firm initially, but develops a hollow with age. Like the cap, it is initially sticky or slimy to the touch when young, but soon dries out. Its attachment to the cap is usually in a central position, although it may also be off-center.Hesler and Smith (1979), pp. 68–9. Fruit bodies of L. indigo have no distinguishable odor. L. indigo var. diminutivus (the \\"smaller indigo milk cap\\") is a smaller variant of the mushroom, with a cap diameter between , and a stem long and thick. It is often seen in Virginia. Hesler and Smith, who first described the variant based on specimens found in Brazoria County, Texas, described its typical habitat as \\"along [the] sides of a muddy ditch under grasses and weeds, [with] loblolly pine nearby\\".Hesler and Smith (1979), p. 70. Microscopic features When viewed in mass, as in a spore print, the spores appear cream to yellow colored.Arora (1986), p. 69. Viewed with a light microscope, the spores are translucent (hyaline), elliptical to nearly spherical in shape, with amyloid warts, and have dimensions of 7–9 by 5.5–7.5 μm. Scanning electron microscopy reveals reticulations on the spore surface. The hymenium is the spore-producing tissue layer of the fruit body, and consists of hyphae that extend into the gills and terminate as end cells. Various cell types can be observed in the hymenium, and the cells have microscopic characteristics that may be used to help identify or distinguish species in cases where the macroscopic characters may be ambiguous. The spore- bearing cells, the basidia, are four-spored and measure 37–45 μm long by 8–10 μm wide at the thickest point.Hesler and Smith (1979), p. 68. Cystidia are terminal cells of hyphae in the hymenium which do not produce spores, and function in aiding spore dispersal, and maintaining favorable humidity around developing spores. The pleurocystidia are cystidia that are found on the face of a gill; they are 40–56 by 6.4–8 μm, roughly spindle-shaped, and have a constricted apex. The cheilocystidia—located on the edge of a gill—are abundant, and are 40.0–45.6 by 5.6–7.2 μm. alt=The finger of a hand are holding a light blue mushroom. On the tip of the thumb is a bright-blue colored substance somewhat resembling paint. Two fingertip-sized areas on the under surface of the mushroom have a dark blue discoloration. Similar species The characteristic blue color of the fruiting body and the latex make this species easily recognizable. Other Lactarius species with some blue color include the \\"silver-blue milky\\" (L. paradoxus), found in eastern North America, which has a grayish-blue cap when young, but it has reddish-brown to purple-brown latex and gills. L. chelidonium has a yellowish to dingy yellow- brown to bluish-gray cap and yellowish to brown latex. L. quieticolor has blue-colored flesh in the cap and orange to red-orange flesh in the base of the stem. Although the blue discoloration of L. indigo is thought to be rare in the genus Lactarius, in 2007 five new species were reported from Peninsular Malaysia with bluing latex or flesh, including L. cyanescens, L. lazulinus, L. mirabilis, and two species still unnamed. Edibility Although L. indigo is a well-known edible species, opinions vary on its desirability. For example, American mycologist David Arora considers it a \\"superior edible\\", while a field guide on Kansas fungi rates it as \\"mediocre in quality\\". It may have a slightly bitter, or peppery taste, and has a coarse, grainy texture. The firm flesh is best prepared by cutting the mushroom in thin slices. The blue color disappears with cooking, and the mushroom becomes grayish. Because of the granular texture of the flesh, it does not lend itself well to drying. Specimens producing copious quantities of milk may be used to add color to marinades. In Mexico, individuals harvest the wild mushrooms for sale at farmers' markets, typically from June to November; they are considered a \\"second class\\" species for consumption. L. indigo is also sold in Guatemalan markets from May to October. It is one of 13 Lactarius species sold at rural markets in Yunnan in southwestern China. Chemical composition (7-Isopropenyl-4-methylazulen-1-yl)methyl stearate, the blue lipophilic alt=(7-isopropenyl-4-methylazulen-1-yl)methyl stearate structure A chemical analysis of Mexican specimens has shown L. indigo to contain moisture at 951 mg/g of mushroom, fat at 4.3 mg/g, protein at 13.4 mg/g, and dietary fiber at 18.7 mg/g, much higher in comparison to the common button mushroom, which contains 6.6 mg/g. Compared to three other wild edible mushroom species also tested in the study (Amanita rubescens, Boletus frostii, and Ramaria flava), L. indigo contained the highest saturated fatty acids content, including stearic acid with 32.1 mg/g—slightly over half of the total free fatty acid content. The blue color of L. indigo is due to (7-isopropenyl-4-methylazulen-1-yl)methyl stearate, an organic analogous to azulene, which is biosynthesised from a sesquiterpene very similar to matricin, the precursor for chamazulene. It is unique to this species, but similar to a compound found in L. deliciosus. Distribution, habitat, and ecology L. indigo is distributed throughout southern and eastern North America but is most common along the Gulf Coast, Mexico, and Guatemala. Its frequency of appearance in the Appalachian Mountains of the United States has been described as \\"occasional to locally common\\". Mycologist David Arora notes that in the United States, the species is found with ponderosa pine in Arizona, but is absent in California's ponderosa pine forests.Arora (1986), p. 35. It has also been collected from China, India, Guatemala, Costa Rica (in forests dominated by oak), and as its southernmost distribution in the Humboldt oak cloud forests of Colombia. In Europe, it has so far only been found in southern France. A study on the seasonal appearance of fruiting bodies in the subtropical forests of Xalapa, Mexico, confirmed that maximal production coincided with the rainy season between June and September. A collection of L. indigo found in alt=About two dozen blue mushroom of varying sizes on a plate. L. indigo is a mycorrhizal fungus, and as such, establishes a mutualistic relationship with the roots of certain trees (\\"hosts\\"), in which the fungi exchange minerals and amino acids extracted from the soil for fixed carbon from the host. The subterranean hyphae of the fungus grow a sheath of tissue around the rootlets of a broad range of tree species, forming so-called ectomycorrhizae—an intimate association that is especially beneficial to the host, as the fungus produces enzymes that mineralize organic compounds and facilitate the transfer of nutrients to the tree. Reflecting their close relationships with trees, the fruit bodies of L. indigo are typically found growing on the ground, scattered or in groups, in both deciduous and coniferous forests. They are also commonly found in floodplain areas that have been recently submerged. In Mexico, associations have been noted with Mexican alder, American Hornbeam, American Hophornbeam, and Liquidambar macrophylla, while in Guatemala the mushroom associates with smooth-bark Mexican pine and other pine and oak species. In Costa Rica, the species forms associations with several native oaks of the genus Quercus. Under controlled laboratory conditions, L. indigo was shown to be able to form ectomycorrhizal associations with the neotropical pine species Mexican white pine, Hartweg's pine, Mexican yellow pine, smooth-bark Mexican pine, and the Eurasian pines Aleppo pine, European black pine, maritime pine, and Scots pine.

Early life and family Joseph- Henri de Jessé was born in Béziers, in the Hérault department of France, on 21 August 1755. Some sources give his year of birth as 1746, but most record it as 1755. His father was Antoine-Joseph Jessé baron de Levas (c1715-1794), Aide-Major of the Coastal Guard, and his mother was Marie-Charlotte de Nizeaux (died 1762). He had one sister, Victoire de Jessé. He was a captain in the cavalry regiment Royal Picardie, the regiment having been reinstated under the military reforms of December 1762. France at that time was still an autocracy based on the divine right of kings. This meant the whole country belonged to the monarch, whose government was one of rights rather than obligations. The French nobility had certain privileges, with the rank of officer in the army and navy being restricted to those with at least two generations of nobility on either side. He married Madeleine Rousset de Saint-Eloi, on 22 February 1788. They had two children, Pauline de Jessé and Antoine de Jessé. Antoine served in the Garde du Corps of Louis XVIII, before giving up his military career in 1817 to devote himself to journalism, literature and good works; he died in December 1854. French Revolution By the late 1780s France was in a dire financial situation, the royal coffers having been declared insolvent in 1786. In the year 1788, 49% of the national income was spent on paying the interest on outstanding loans. On 24 January 1789, the Estates-General was reluctantly convoked by King Louis XVI for the first time since 1614. On 26 March 1789 Jessé was elected to the Estates-General by the sénéchaussée Béziers, to serve as a deputy of the nobility. The Estates-General soon reached a deadlock. The Third Estate, or Commoners, broke away during June and formed its own assembly. Jessé was amongst those who helped persuade the three orders of Clergy, Nobility and Commoners to eventually reunite and form the National Constituent Assembly, which was declared on 9 July 1789. The Bastille was stormed, and fell on 14 July 1789. The people of Paris believed that weapons and gunpowder were being stored in the Bastille, and fearing the city was about to be placed under military occupation by soldiers loyal to the King, the people decided to storm and occupy the fortress. Jessé was admitted to sit in the National Constituent Assembly on 7 August 1789, as a replacement for the Marquis de Gayon, who had resigned. He sided with the moderates and conservatives. When debating the newly drafted Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, which was adopted by the National Assembly on 27 August 1789, Jessé had tried to convince the Assembly to abandon the principle of resistance to oppression. He also proposed that large quantities of silverware owned by the French Church should be melted down to provide funds for the relief of the poor. In 1790 Jessé objected to the proposed annexation of Avignon with France. Avignon had risen up and imposed the election of a new municipality: it expelled its papal vice-legate on 17 June 1790, and demanded its integration with France. The National Assembly twice refused to ratify the annexation: on 22 August and 20 November 1790. Jessé continued to vote with the supporters of the Old Regime. In March 1791, Jessé proposed that only the King should have the power to appoint government ministers. A new constitution was accepted by King Louis XVI in September 1791, and he was renamed 'King of the French'. Under the new constitution, Louis could appoint ministers but the legislature could remove them; he was not able to propose laws and had a veto which only blocked legislation for a maximum of three years. From late 1791 onwards, Jessé campaigned for the rights of émigrés, and the protection of their property. Émigrés were French royalists who fled the country to escape the Revolution of 1789. From the safety of their self-imposed exile abroad, many émigrés conspired against the Revolutionary government. The Revolutionary leaders decreed that émigrés who failed to return to France by January 1792 would be declared to be traitors and would be sentenced to death in their absence. In October 1792 the state imposed perpetual banishment on all émigrés, and formally confiscated their property. As the Revolution progressed, Jessé argued that France should become a constitutional monarchy, rather than a Republic. However, the monarchy was formally abolished on 21 September 1792, and King Louis XVI was executed in January 1793. The Reign of Terror began on 5 September 1793, with aristocrats and conservatives being deemed enemies of the state. Jessé was eventually arrested and incarcerated at Moulins. He was then transferred to the Conciergerie in Paris, where he died of typhus on 6 February 1794, the day before he was due to be guillotined. His father also died in 1794, having been imprisoned with his family during the Terror. His father was arrested despite both his advanced age and the popularity he enjoyed among his countrymen.

Fiber optics are fanned out in splice boxes that are situated at the end of fiber optic transmission paths. splicebox with interior splice cassette The main components of a splice box are the splice cassette that picks up the fibers and their reserves, and the front panel which contains different connectors for transmitting signals via copper or fiber optic cables. The splice cassette is removable in order to assemble fiber optics with a splice unit. The front panel can also be removed to splice the fibers to various connectors. Since modern splice cassettes already contain a splice tray, a splice holder, couplings and pigtails, the installation of the cables is facilitated. So-called hybrid splice boxes do not only ensure data transmission via copper cables RJ45 or fiber optics, but they also ensure the power supply. That becomes especially important when a splice box needs to be installed in indoor or outdoor applications that are difficult to access. splicebox with different plugs References * Bernhard Bundschuh, Jörg Himmel: Optische Informationsübertragung.

The trading strategy consist of a set of criteria, and is typically programmed, but can also be created by using a method combining the set of criteria visually without programming. The set of criteria used in a trading strategy for Automated Trading are mostly based on technical analysis.  Types  There are two types of automated forex trading which consist of: *A completely automated system or known as a robotic forex trading: Generally, this method is what you would classify as a \\"trading machine\\" or \\"black box trading\\" which executes orders based on certain algorithms based on its creator. The creator of the automatic trading script has already decided on the aspects of the order such as the timing, price or quantity and initiates the order automatically. Users can only interfere by tweaking the technical parameters (such as lot size, risk parameters, stop-losses and take profit) of the program; all other control is handed over to the trading script. *A Signal- based forex generator: You need to manually execute orders generated by a trading system which has an algorithm in-built to highlight a potential entry and close signal and a user manually executes these trade orders with a broker.  Advantages  An automated trading environment can generate more trades per market than a human trader can handle and can replicate its actions across multiple markets and time frames. An automated system is also unaffected by the psychological swings that human traders are prey to. This is particularly relevant when trading with a mechanical model, which is typically developed on the assumption that all the trade entries flagged will actually be taken in real time trading.  Disadvantages  As a decentralized and relatively unregulated market, it is extremely attractive to a number of Forex scams. Forex autotrading, as it brings Forex trading to the masses makes even more people susceptible to frauds. Bodies such as the National Futures Association and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have issued warnings and rules to avoid fraudulent Forex trading behavior.

Both Mombassa and O'Doherty were formerly members of the iconic Australian band Mental as Anything, and they formed Dog Trumpet as an outlet for their original material.Sentimental as anything, The Sydney Morning Herald, 29 June 2002. The Dog Trumpet sound reflects a sincere affection for classic 1960s pop and whimsical psychedelia. Biography In 1990, Mental As Anything members had agreed to take a sabbatical from their band work and turned to solo or side projects. Mombassa and O'Doherty formed the duo Reg & Peter/Peter & Reg (they alternated names whenever interviewed). Under the name of Reg & Peter, the duo issued the single \\"Jean\\"/\\"Nobody Home\\" in March 1991 on Regular Records, the song is described by Mombassa as \\"a fusion of psychedelic and Celtic rock 'n 'roll dealing with metaphysical romance\\", before assuming the name Reg & Peter's Dog Trumpet for the album Two Heads One Brain. The album made the Rolling Stone's list of top albums for the year. Two further singles were lifted from the album, \\"Made of Wood\\"/\\"Red Brick Home\\" in June 1991 (the cover art for which is a painting of a howling dog trumpet by Mombassa) and \\"I'm So Handsome\\"/\\"Dream\\" in October 1991. The name \\"Dog Trumpet\\" came from a piece of Mombassa's artwork which featured a creature resembling a cross between a dog, a trumpet and a jet engine.Donovan, Patrick and Tessie Virgiotis: Every dog has its day, The Age, 12 October 2007. The album was produced by Steve James and helping out in the studio were Mike Gubb (keyboards; ex-Dynamic Hepnotics, Mental as Anything, The Whitlams), John Bliss (drums; ex-The Reels) and Mark Honeybrook (bass). The next two years saw the release of two EPs, Kiss a Gun Down in October 1992 and Strange Brew in October 1993. Film clips were made for \\"Beast of Prey\\" and \\"Melancholy Way\\", although they were not released as singles. Strange Brew was an inspired reworking of the old Cream song. The artwork for Strange Brew, was painted by Martin Sharp, who designed several album covers for the real Cream in the late 1960s. Tony Martin had replaced Honeybrook on bass. After that, Mental as Anything re-emerged to tour and record, with Dog Trumpet put on the back-burner. In 1996, Reg and Pete revived Dog Trumpet and issued the album Suitcase. Backing the duo in the studio were Tony Martin, Andy Travers (drums; ex-the Happening Thang) and Amanda Brown (violin, backing vocals; ex-The Go-Betweens). \\"Suitcase\\" was released as a single on TWA Records in 1996, with \\"Into the Bible\\" released by TWA as a radio single in 1997 (the cover picture of a lecturing monster is by Mombassa). The band's third album, Dog Trumpet, was recorded over a period of years and was engineered and produced by O'Doherty on an old sixteen track reel to reel in the spare room of his flat in Coogee. It was released in February 2002 on Half A Cow Records. Aside from regular drummers, they used Terepai Richmond for some tracks. The cover is a painting by Mombassa of him and his brother Peter when they were small children. Dog Trumpet released their fourth album Antisocial Tendencies in March 2007 on Half A Cow Records. The album features a cover of \\"Lili Marlene\\", a popular World War II song made famous by Marlene Dietrich.Zuel, Bernard: Dog Trumpet, The Sydney Morning Herald, 16 March 2007. In 2008 Mombassa and O'Doherty began recording songs for the next Dog Trumpet album, uploading a demo of \\"The Great South Road\\", a new song from the forthcoming album, on their MySpace website in December 2008. The album, River of Flowers, was released on 28 May 2010. Early August 2013, Dog Trumpet released the double album 'Medicated Spirits' through Orange Lounge Recordings. The album has been short-listed for the 'Australian Music Prize' Australian Album of the Year. The band have also been invited to attend SXSW in March 2014. Playing various Festivals all over from \\"Port Fairy Folk Festival\\", \\"Bluesfest\\", \\"Blue Mountains Music Festival\\", \\"SXSW\\". Dog Trumpet lost their talented Drummer/Journalist Iain Shedden in 2017. Iain was replaced by Jim Elliott ex Cruel Sea. Over the last couple of years Peter and Reg have been recording a new album due for release in May 2020. The album's title is \\"Great South Road\\", a title that serves as both a link to their childhood in New Zealand referring to the old main road leading from Auckland to Wellington passing through their southern Auckland suburb of Papakura; and also as a metaphor for the parlous and perilous state of the world, for a human society that appears to be heading South towards a dystopian future.

Career A 1968 graduate of Colgate University in Hamilton, New York and Georgetown University Law Center, Frumin's entire career has been spent giving non-partisan procedural advice in the United States Congress. He began his career in 1974 by participating in the editing of Deschler's Precedents of the House of Representatives (the official authoritative compilation of the precedents of the House) before joining the Senate Parliamentarian's office in 1977. He is the editor of Riddick's Senate Procedure, the official authoritative compilation of Senate precedents.Lisa Friedman (2008) The Almanac of the Unelected 2008: Staff of the U.S. Congress. 405. Pennsylvania: Bernan Press. He was promoted to the position of Chief Parliamentarian in 1987, when the Democratic party obtained a majority and control of the Senate, and the incumbent Parliamentarian, Robert Dove, was dismissed. In 1995, when the Republican party regained control of the Senate, Dove was reinstated as Parliamentarian, and Frumin was returned to his previous position as top assistant. In 1997, while serving as the Senior Assistant Parliamentarian, the Senate honored Frumin by granting him the status of Parliamentarian Emeritus. In May 2001, Dove was again dismissed, this time by the Republican Majority Leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, and Frumin was again promoted to Chief Parliamentarian, thus becoming the only person to become Chief Parliamentarian under both parties. He was subsequently retained as Chief Parliamentarian at each successive change in party control of the Senate: in June 2001; January 2003; and January 2007. His 35 years and one-month tenure in the Senate Parliamentarian's Office is the longest such tenure in the history of that office, and his 18-year and 10 month service as Chief Parliamentarian is second only to the 29 and a half years served by Charles Watkins, the Senate's first Parliamentarian. Frumin began receiving significant media coverage and notice in his usually quiet role during the 2010 healthcare reform debate for the critical role he plays in determining the validity of the reconciliation procedure being employed to apply changes desired by the House to portions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act passed by both houses. In November 2011, Frumin was included on The New Republic's list of Washington's most powerful, least famous people. Family Frumin was born December 26, 1946, to Harry H. and Nanette Frumin in New York, New York. He has one sister, Leslie. On February 15, 1981, he married Federal Trade Commission lawyer Jill Meryl (née Brown); they have one daughter, Allison.

In 2007 Forbes.com reported that according to the World Health organization's (WHO) latest estimate, Nauru has the highest percentage of overweight and obese inhabitants among all countries. The estimation identified 94.5% of its residents as overweight. The obesity rate is 71.7%, the highest in the world. The definition of \\"overweight\\" and \\"obesity\\" are based on body mass index (BMI). People with BMI more than or equal to 25 are classified as overweight, and people with BMI more than or equal to 30 are classified as obese. The average body weight among Nauruans is estimated to be approximately . Nauru has an average BMI between 34 and 35. Causes 14th president of Nauru Baron Waqa Before Nauru gained independence in 1968, there was a culture of fishing and gardening. The Nauruan diet then was primarily composed of marine fish, fruits, root vegetables, and coconuts. As per the analysis by Asahi Shimbun correspondent Takaaki Nishiyama, black-and-white-photographs taken during this time depict well-built and fit men and women. But after Nauru gained independence, there was a major economic growth resulting from mining. The profits from the mining activities were distributed among the citizens and Nauru's per capita income became very high. As a consequence, people did not feel the need to work. Over time, the minerals that made the country rich had been mined, causing the nation to sink back into hard economic times. According to a study conducted by the Government of Nauru and the WHO, the import of western food significantly reduced the existing culture of fishing and gardening, and from the 1980s, Nauruans were used to a sedentary lifestyle and an unhealthy diet. This resulted in what the study described as \\"the worst health conditions in the Pacific region\\". Ninety percent of the land area of Nauru is covered with phosphate deposits which have now been mostly strip- mined. Strip-mined land is inarable. This is why Nauru has very little arable land and relies on importing processed food, which is high in both sugar and fat, from large Oceanian countries like Australia and New Zealand. Most, if not all, of the diet on Nauru is high fat and high sugar foods with very little nutritional value. Apart from an unhealthy diet, lack of physical exercise, and lack of proper health education, cultural attitude towards obesity has played an important role in the high obesity rate in the country. According to the University of Queensland professor and South Pacific researcher Clive Moore, obesity is seen as a sign of wealth in Nauru. Consequence As a consequence of high obesity rates, Nauru has the highest rate of adult diabetes in the world. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) identified 31% of Nauruans as diabetic.

Membership  Freshfel Europe incorporates over 200 companies and national associations of producers, importers, shippers and exporters, distributors, wholesalers, retailers and their service providers such as logistics and reefer transportation, as well as seed companies and crop protection companies. Members and associated members are both from within the EU and in countries with an interest in the European fruit and vegetables market.  Structure  Freshfel Europe is structured around a Board which is enhanced by several Divisions and Committees with dedicated missions. The Board consists of the Association’s President, Vice-President and the Treasurer. Each of the Divisions (Import; Export; Production; Wholesale and Distribution, and Retail) and Committees (Food Safety and Sustainability; Promotion and Communication, Convenience, Bananas, and Citrus) is having one Chairman and one Vice-Chairman. All Board members are elected for a mandate period of two years. The Board was renewed by the 2012 AGM which took place in Brussels (Belgium) on 19 June 2012 for the 2012/2014 term of activities. Besides the Board assignments which are ad personam, Freshfel operates in an open manner, inviting all its members and associated members to attend the regular meetings organised by the Association on topical and emerging issues.  Consumption Monitor  The ‘Consumption Monitor’ was developed by the Freshfel Working Group on Promotion, Communication and Image and analyses each year the trends in the production, trade and supply of fresh fruits and vegetables across the EU-27, as well as consumption information in Norway, Switzerland and the USA. The study is part of the actions undertaken by Freshfel in the framework of the EU Platform for Action on Diet, Physical Activity and Health.  Enjoy Fresh  Building on efforts to spread the word to ‘Enjoy Fresh’ and to enhance the image of fresh fruit and vegetables, Freshfel has conducted in the first half of 2011 a media campaign to highlight the value of fresh produce. In the course of these activities the association has launched in February the so-called ‘Enjoy Fresh’ website.'Enjoy Fresh' Homepage It is the first pan-European website to highlight the positive features of fresh produce and tries to raise the awareness about the values and benefits fresh produce provides to consumers. The website provides information on the production and sustainability aspects of fruit and vegetables, on what is being done to ensure a 'quality' product, information on the nutrition and health benefits, statistical facts, and also tips on how to prepare / consume fresh produce. In continuing to build up the ‘Enjoy Fresh’ concept on a European level, Freshfel launched in the course of another media campaign in the first half of 2012 in June a public website designed for kids, parents and teachers, called ‘Kids Enjoy Fresh’.'Kids Enjoy Fresh' Homepage It is supposed to bring fresh produce closer to kids and assist parents and teachers in this task.

History Shipton-on-Cherwell Halt was one of 26 new halts opened by the Great Western Railway in 1929. It was situated on an embankment immediately adjacent to the single-span girder bridge over the A423 road. Facilities were basic: a short sleeper-built platform on the north side of the line, together with a small wooden shelter, running in board and two wooden lamp posts supporting traditional glass lanterns with ornamental finials. A sloping cinder path led down to the A423 where a sign proclaimed the halt as a station for \\"Blenheim, Oxford, Banbury, etc.\\".Linguard, p. 16. The halt was constructed at a cost of £160 with a low platform for railmotors. The platform was later raised to standard height in 1933 at a cost of £120.Jenkins, p. 69. The halt was opened to serve the community of cement workers employed by the Oxford & Shipton Cement Company which had opened a large quarry to the north of Shipton-on-Cherwell village. The company erected several rows of 1920s-style houses for its workers and this became known as \\"Bunkers Hill\\".Jenkins, p. 46. In the absence of competing bus routes, the halt was soon carrying significant numbers of passengers between Bunkers Hill and Shipton old village, contributing to a rise in passenger numbers at Woodstock from 17,000 in the early 1900s to 22,000+ in the 1930s.Jenkins, p. 48. By the 1950s, rationalisation led to staff reductions on the line and the introduction of a modest timetable which saw eight services each way call at Shipton-on-Cherwell. Passenger numbers had fallen to 9,000, with each train carrying on average 5 to 6 passengers and sometimes empty.Jenkins, p. 89.Searle, p. 129. The last train ran on 27 February 1954 adorned with a wreath. Present day After closure, the halt remained untouched except for the removal of the nameboard until the lifting of the track in January 1958. By 1973, all that remained was a solitary rail which supported a notice against trespassing and the kissing gate by the roadside which was buried in brambles.Linguard, p. 51. Little now remains of the station.

Location The palace is situated in Gondal city, which is well connected by road, rail and air services. It is located away from Rajkot, which is also the airport ( away) and rail head. Features Detail of Naulakha Palace An interior view of the Naulakha Palace Gondal was the capital city of a Jadeja Rajput clan. The Naulakha Palace is said to be the oldest palace in the Gondal area. It has very exclusive architectural features of arcades, jharokas, a royal audience hall (durbar hall) (which is still used by the present Maharaja), a winding stairway, shining chandeliers, decorated mirrors and antique furnishings. It is a unique triple storied edifice with an open arcade with stone carvings on the first floor flanked by towers. The eaves above the stone fittings on this floor are carved with sculptures of real and mythical animals. A part of the first floor also houses a museum which has elegant architectural features over the rooms with carvings made out of wood and stone over its doors. The exhibits in the museum include artifacts collected by the Maharaja of a large number of toy cars, pictures, a library of books, trophies and so forth. The decorated balcony provides scenic views of the Gondal town. The side room on the left side of the palace has exhibits of kitchen ware and a pair of huge weighing balance; the weighing balance was used on special celebrations of the Maharaja's birthdays when he used to be weighed in gold equivalent which would then be donated to the poor. Another interesting scene noted near a bridge over the river is the reflected image of the palace. Grounds A zenana in the palace complex Naulakha Palace is situated within Darbargardh (an old fort complex), which was built during the 18th century (1748), with a number of additional structures built in subsequent years. The main approach to the complex is through a curved gateway structure with a clock tower which rises in three tiers above the gateway. The palace is at the far end from the gate and is fronted by a rectangular forecourt. The palace has an overview of the Gondal River. There are many other structures within the complex, such as the Huzoor Palace, a large building which is currently the residence of the royal family; the Orchard Palace, a wing of the Huzoor; and the Riverside Palace, which is away from Naulakha. An adjoining zenana is in a state of ruin. It is flanked by two statues of guards and has stone tracery architectural features on its upper floor. The Gori Pir, a Muslim shrine (dargah) of a saint is within the courtyard. An old railway saloon, which is displayed in the gardens, has basic accommodation of a bedroom, dining room, and bathroom with period fitments.

Ferris,2010 Cambridge University Press) was a wealthy English civil judge born in St Mary- at-Hill, Billingsgate, London and lived at Military St Westminster, he was educated at Eton College then at King's College, Cambridge and was called to the Middle Temple bar in 1606 he later received a knighthood in 1617.The Knights Of England Volume 2 p.166 1906 William A Shaw He was also known as a dramatist and translator. He should not be confused with another contemporary Sir Ralph Freeman who was lord mayor of London, and died on 16 March 1634. Life He succeeded Robert Naunton in his office of as one of six Masters of Requests in 1618. He had married a relation of George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, through whose influence he had also obtained a grant of [the rights of] pre-emption and transportation of tin for seven years in August 1613. In 1622 he had a grant in reversion of the auditorship of imprests and of the auditorship of the Mint. Freeman hoped that through Lord Buckingham, he would succeed Thomas Murray as provost of Eton, but the appointment was given to Sir Henry Wotton. Freeman then unsuccessfully applied to Buckingham to be allowed to succeed Wotton as ambassador at Venice. In 1626 and 1627 he was on a commission for the arrest of French ships and goods in England. In 1629 he held the office of auditor of imprests after a dispute as to its possession with Sir Giles Monpesson and purchased a large manor in Betchworth, Surrey for £1,080. He became master worker of the mint at a salary of £500 per annum, when in 1635, jointly with Sir Thomas Aylesbury, he formed a commission exercising the powers of the Master of the Mint. This came about by the exclusion from the position of Robert Harley, in favour of the previous incumbent Randal Cranfield, who then died suddenly.Christopher Edgar Challis, A New History of the Royal Mint (1992), p. 279. Freeman was also one of the first appointed in February 1635 to the newly created office of 'searcher and sealer' of all foreign hops imported into England. On the death of Sir Dudley Digges, Freeman bid high for the Master of the Rolls, which was taken by Sir Charles Caesar. With no known office in later life in 1655 he published Imperiale, a tragedy which he had written many years before; an unauthorised edition to which he refers had appeared in 1639. Freeman also published two verse translations from Seneca the Younger: the Booke of Consolation to Marcia (1635), and the other the Booke of the Shortnes of Life (2nd ed. 1663). At the last-given date Freeman was still alive. Personal life He married Catherine Bret and had two sons: George Freeman, who died with his landed estate and without sons in 1678, and Ralph Freeman who held it in 1684 and in whose family's hands it would remain until sale in 1817.

History The church was opened in 1897Jackson's Oxford Journal, September 1897. as a church for those of the baptist persuasion of the protestant Christian religion following a period of time when a group of people met for open air worship under the leadership of Rev J. H. Moore. The church was built on a plot of land on the Woodstock Road adjacent to the bottom of the newly occupied residential area of Summertown in Oxford. The original church building (known as Victoria Hall, in commemoration of the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria), is of white brick with stone facings and capable of holding 100 people. The west wall of the church building was made of wood, with the intention being to expand the building westwards when numbers of attendance required it. The church was extended in the 1930s by the addition of a brick walled, tin roofed 'hut' which as later roofed over to make a more permanent structure. The church can seat approx. 200 people, though it currently has seating for 120. It was a member of the Baptist Union until the 1980s. The trust deeds of the church were redrawn in the late 1990s by the then pastor Keith Stokes and the church elders. This allowed the church to separate from the Baptist Union due to differences in doctrine.

The temple is dedicated to Mahasu Devta. Lord Mahasu is the chief deity of this area and is worshiped in Mahasu Devta Temple by the people of Hanol and nearby villages of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh state of India. It is the ancient temple of Mahasu Devta built in the 9th century. The temple was constructed in Kath-Kuni or Koti-Banal style of architecture.Art & Architecture of Uttarakhand By Madhu Jain By - O. C. Handa It is included in the Archaeological Survey of India list of ancient temple in Dehradun circle, Uttarakhand.Chakrata , Hanol Chakrata Mahasu Devta Temple is on the eastern bank of Tons River (Tamas) at Hanol village, near Chakrata, about 190 km from Dehradun, 156 km from Mussoorie and about 140 km from Shimla.  Hanol  The name of the village according to the legend was kept after the name of Huna Bhatt, a Brahmin. It can also be derived from 'hanul' meaning fire. Before mahasu arrived, this place was used for torturing offenders with the heat of fire by putting them in the hollow of a big drum, placed horizontally and heated from below. Earlier the place was known as Chakrapur, and it is said to be the place to which the pandavas escaped from laksha graha or the Lakhmandal on River Yamuna. The village is at an altitude of 1,050 m above M.S.L. on the left bank of River Tons earlier known as River Tamas (meaning short-tempered). No water can be drawn from it for irrigation purposes, because of its precipitous banks and deep gorges. It is for this reason the river is called Karam Nashini. According to another tradition, the water of River Tons are the tears from the eyes of Bhubruvanan. The temple village of Hanol is a sort of pilgrimage place for people living in vast areas in the mountainous parts of Uttarakhand, west of Yamuna River, The trans giri area of Sirmaur district and major part of Shimla district of Himachal Pradesh. Hanol is approachable from Tiuni, a well-known trijunction of roads on the Pabbar River after covering a distance of 15 km on an all-weather motorable road which meanders smoothly through the pine clad mountain slopes. Although the terrain through which the road passes is very narrow and by another side of road one can see the river tons. Besides his ancient and principal temple at Hanol, Mahasu Devta has number of temples scattered in his deitydom. Besides Hanol temples situated at villages namely Thaina, Basoi and Gabela are regarded as Thans (Abode) of Mahasu. Also the temples dedicated to Mahasu Devta birs (His two deputies) Kaulo and Shedkulia has exclusive temples for them in Tiuni and Raaigi. There are many Mahasu Devta Temples in whole Jaunsar-Bawar region, some famous of them are located at village Bisoi, Buraswa, Kotua, Laksiyar. Number of temples of Mahasu and his brothers are situated at various places of Devghar, Jaunsar-Bawar and Sirmour areas.mahasudevta mandir-lakshiyar About Mahasu Devta In the deitydom, Mahasu Devta is not only the sole arbiter over the mortals, he also reigns supreme over the innumerable indigenous gods and goddesses. He exercises his authority over the religious dispensation of people and secular matters. Disputes among the people are settled through a unique LotaPani adjuration. For this purpose water is ritually filled in a metallic goblet in the name of Mahasu Devta by a neutral person, then the disputants are asked to drink that water in the name of Mahasu Devta. The party who has given the false statement suffers on drinking the water. The age-old theocratic governance of Mahasu Devta, although acceptable to people and local rulers, was not taken kindly by the British authority. One of their officers, Major Young, found the authority of Mahasu Devta 'a great nuisance'. During land settlement of the territory under the British control in AD 1827 he felt that the traditional twelve-year sojourning of Mahasu (the Chalda Mahasu) with his large entourage to deitydom was extremely burdensome and exploitative to common people. To check the practice, Young passed a summary order in Kalsi in an assembly of the Senyanas banishing the Chalda Mahasu and his deputy attendants (birs) from Jaunsar and Bawar parangna. That order, however, did not have lasting effect because the people regarded the Rohru tehsil for his verdict. The deity decision is always regarded as final and irrevocable. Mahasu Devta is very touchy about the disposal of gold or gold ornaments by anyone of his subject to outsiders. The person involved in such offence may suffer the loss of property, a serious disease, or even life until he gets it back intact. However, that does not absolve the defaulter from the crime. As a punishment the defaulter is obliged to deposit the article in the treasury of deity. Therefore, the people in the deitydom have to be very careful about the transaction of silver and gold articles outside his realm. It is believed that the bullion in the Mahasudom, even if in the possession of people, belongs to the deity. If such gold goes outside his deitydom the person doing so provokes the ire of Mahasu Devta.  Legends  Mahasu Devta appears in quadruple form as the four brothers. The legend tells when Krishna disappeared at the end of Dvapara Yuga, the Pandavas followed him. They cross the River Tons. Yudhishtra was fascinated by the beauty of place and asked Vishwakarma to build a temple here and stay with Draupadi for nine days. The place subsequently came to known as Hanol, after the name of Huna Bhatt.The Abode of Mahashiva by Madhu Jain At the start of Kali Yuga, demons wandered over Uttrakhand devouring people and devastating villages. The greatest demon was Kirmir who had devoured all the seven sons of a pious-hearted Brahmin named Huna Bhatt. Demon cast an evil eye and desired to have the Kirtaka wife of the Brahmin; she prayed to Lord Shiva to protect her chastity. Lord Shiva blinded Kirmir and thus she could run away to her husband. They then prayed to Hatkeshwari Devi of Hatkoti (ashtbhuji Durga) who advised the couple to go to the Kashmir mountains and offer prayer to Lord Shiva to help. They did, and Lord Shiva granted them their wish that all the evils will be killed shortly. Huna Bhatt was told to go back to his home and perform certain rituals and worship devi. On doing so the shakti emerged from the ground with flames around and told Huna Bhatt to plough every Sunday a part of his field with a plough of solid silver with a shoe of pure gold having yoked a pair of bullocks who had never been put on yoke before. On the seventh Sunday the Mahasu brothers with their ministers and the army will come out and rid the people from the clutches of demon. Huna Bhatt did accordingly, but on sixth Sunday when he had turned on five furrows out of each sprang a deity from the first came Botha from second Pavasi, out of third Vasik and Chalda from the fourth one. All the brothers were called by a common affix of Mahasu (Char Mahasu). From the fifth furrow appeared their heavenly mother Devladli Devi and their ministers. Countless army sprang out like mushrooms from the field. Huna Bhatt did as directed and the whole army of the demon was killed by Mahasu brothers. Kirmir was taken by Chalda Devta in a ravine of Mount Khanda. The marks of his sword on the rock can be seen today. During the absence of the Mahasu brothers, demon Keshi took control of Hanol. Chalda Devta and his warriors Shitkulia, Kaolu and others set out with the army to the mountains of Masmor where Keshi had gone. The demon was killed; Chalda Devta returned jubilantly to visit with his heroes the places named by him. He divided the country among the brothers so that they may rule their respective territory and guard against calamities of all the people who would worship them as god and perform jagara. However, a mistake erupted in the venture of the Mahasu brothers. In the beginning, Mahasu Devta had pledged their word to Huna Bhatt that they would appear on the seventh Sunday. Since they arrived a week earlier, the Mahasu brothers were hurt by the blade of Huna Bhatt's plough -- he was in the field unaware of their untimely arrival. As a result, Botha was hurt in the knee and became unable to walk. Vasik's eye was damaged by the blade of grass which impaired his vision. Pavasi had a small piece cut out of his ear. Only Chalda and Devladli Mata remained unhurt. Thereafter Botha preferred to settle within his temple at Hanol on the right bank of river tons. Pavasi keep moving over his domain and spend years turn by turn at Hanol, Lakhmandal, Authana and Uttarkashi. Chalda, being sound of limb, was to exercise away in the whole dominion in the Botha Mahasu name -- twelve years on end he roamed among his subjects. Each of four deities has a bir (attendant). They are Kapala, Kaolu, Kailath and Shitkulia. All the birs have balyayinis (female helpers).  Jagara of Lord Mahasu View of Mahasu Devta Temple. The Jagara celebrated for Lord Mahasu is quintessential to his cult and is unheard of outside his deitydom. Held in the month of Bhadon on the eve of Naga chauth (Bhadraprada shukla chaturtha), i.e., the fourth day of the bright half. This day is very important because the lord appeared from the ground on that day. On this occasion, during the day the mohras images are ritually bathed and carried ceremoniously duly wrapped in the folds of a sheet of cloth. These are soiled by an ominous sight. No one is allowed to be near the image as the deity may feel offended and curse the defaulter. After the rituals the images are consigned to the altar for none to see, and one of them is kept in a palanquin for the consummation of ceremonies during the day. By sunset that image is also taken inside the temple and placed on the altar with others. As the night falls, a tall, straight pole cut from a kail (blue pine) tree is planted firmly on the ground. On it a flag of deity is hoisted. Another pole of similar tree of much shorter length having number of forking branches is taken. Its branches are chopped off at about half of meter from the stem so that a large squarish slate can be securely placed over the branches. This is called chira. The goat reserved for the deity is brought near the altar and offered to the deity by sprinkling water over it. If the animal shivers (bijana), it signals acceptance by the deity. As night gets darker, the men and women team around with the burning torches of resinous wood in their hands. They dance in a circle around chira. The fire keeps on burning on chira with more fuel fed to it throughout the night. Dancing and singing continues around the chira throughout the night on the beat of Nagaras and other instruments. At times people, people fall from the circle and more take their places so that chain is never broken. At times, a man or two would drop from the circle being possessed by deity or his deputy (shedkulia) starts shouting and crying in frenzy of divine afflatus.  In the Mahabharata era  During the Mahabharat era, King Duryodhana came to Purola after traveling through Kullu and Kashmir. Duryodhana liked Purola so much that he decided to reside there. He prayed to Mahasu Devta for a piece of land. The deity accepted his pleas and made him the king of the area. King Duryodhana made Jakholi his capital village and constructed Mahasu Devta Temple. In medieval time the great Mughal emperor Akbar made frequent visits to the temple. Shaant Festival at Hanol (May 2004) A festival of shaant was held at Hanol, the principal seat of Botha Mahasu, from 22 May 2004 to 26 May 2004. There are three main types of ceremonies, namely khura shau (one hundred legs of animals sacrificed), munda shau (one hundred heads of animals sacrificed) and singhaan shau (one head of lon or at least representative a cat). This festival which was observed on May 2004 at hanol in which twenty-five goats are required to be sacrificed, twenty five is the minimum number of goats that can be sacrificed. Khura shau ceremonies locally called as shaant festivals are held after several years in the habitats where the tradition of such ceremonies is continuing since past.The second type of shaant ceremony Munda Shau is difficult to arrange in comparison to Khura shau as it involves hundred heads of animals. The shaant festival held at hanol in Jaunsar-Bawar region in Uttarakhand was arranged after about one hundred years. About fifty- two village gods(Gram Devtas) attended the shaant festival. According to Pandit Devi Ram of Maneoti, tehsil chopal, who was among the pandits performing puja during the ceremony, told the eleven pandits conducted the puja during the ceremony in the temple for five days. According to him, the decision of stopping the practice of offering goats to the deities was taken in the ceremony and all the participating deities and their representatives (Vazirs), Excepting Shedkulia of Fateh Parvat in Uttarakhand,consented to stop sacrificial practices in their temples. Two other important decisions arrived at the ceremony (1) To allow entry of ladies in the temple,(2) To stop the practice of sacrificing animals in name of village gods.B R sharma's Gods of Himachal Pradesh  Mahasu Devta fair  Mahasu Devta fair is held every year in August. It is the most important religious fair of the local tribe. Basically Mahasu Devta fair at Hanol is celebrated by the Jaunsari tribe and people of other communities join them. This fair depicts the cultural harmony between the communities.Trance,Rituals and Rhythm by Hans Utter There is a deity idol inside the temple known as Chalta Mahasu. During the fair, this deity is taken out in procession. Large crowds walk on the both sides. The prayers are continued for three days and nights. They are accompanied by music and folk dance mainly performed by locals and people from nearby villages. The musicians and folk dancers from dehradun and nearby districts comes to participate in this fair. The materials for performing rituals (like havan, etc.) are provided by the Government of India. Since the Mahasu Devta fair at Hanol is local, the majority of the people come from nearby districts of Uttarkashi, Tehri, Saharanpur, etc. Mahasu Devta fair at Hanol is the best venue to view the cultural heritage and traditions of local tribes.  Palanquins of Mahasu Devta  The palanquins of Mahasu Devta is generally of roof type-Box type design. In roof type-box type palanquins, the deity's image (Murti or Muharas) is hidden inside the box. Usually made up of silver and sometimes inlaid with gold,both the box and the roof are typically ornamented with repousse images of Shiva,Ganesha,Krishna,The Pandavas and Kauravas and Gopis. The placement of silver parasol at the peak of the roof and the four ball at each of the corner of the box reproduces the mandallic geometry of centre and four directions,the visual signature of world-ordering sovereignty gives visual form to Mahasu's paramount status as \\"king of the gods\\" (). A woven silver cummerbund tied around the box, through which the deity's sword is slung, indicates the palanquin's anthropomorphic construction as the martial body of a demon-slaying ruler.European Bulletin Himalayan Research Summer 2006  Architectural aspects of temple  Architecturally Mahasu Devta Temple at Hanol is one of the rarest examples of perfect and harmonious blend of stone and wooden structure to form one composite grand edifice. The sanctum proper is a pure stone shikhara in classical naga style. The whole wooden structure is covered with a high pitched slated pent roof surmounted by a two- tiered conical canopy over it on which a gracefully tapered kalash pinnacle stands. The roof ends and the projection of balcony are ornamented with dangling fringes a pendent corner bells which sway with the slightest movement of breeze.Plan of Mahasu Devta Temple, Hanol The stone built classical sanctum sanctorum enshrines many mohras and one bronze image. Those in front row from left to right are Chalda Mahasu (the Mahasu who keeps on moving), Devladli Devi (mother of Mahasu Devta), Kapala Bir (one of the four birs (attendants) of Mahasu Devta), and Shedkuliya (the attendant who emits the whistling sound). Behind them in the preceding order are Pavasi Devta, Kailu (a bir), Natari (polyandrous wife of four Mahasu brothers). All the face images are seated in a middle a small bronze image which is regarded as Botha Mahasu. Entry to sanctum is restricted strictly for others except the pujari. Even he is required to undergo ritual ablution every time he enters the celestial realms; the tradition pujari of temple is a Brahmin. He is not supposed to eat meat, only eat food once a day, avoid proximity with other persons during the term of his deity as pujari.Mahasu devta temple In front of sanctum is a large room which functions as an extension to the sanctum where sacramental objects are stored. This room is called Bhandar. Entry to this room is restricted to Brahmins only. The gilded door of the bhandar is very interesting. It surface is profusely embossed with human and animal figures in a very bold manner depicting the episodes associated with the birth of Mahasu Devta. The door frame is intensively covered with coins nailed over one another through years but non of them are numismatic interest and range from recent past. The lion head is fitted with a gold brass ring that serves as a handle. Such ornamental door are common in temple near east of satluj. In front of the vestibule is a sabha mandap followed by an open frontal portico. All the four apartments of this temple are roofed separately. Vestibule and bhandar have a combined three-tiered pent roof with pyramid canopy. The frontal porch has a gable roof over it supported by two wooden pillars with an intermediate ornamental arch. The Lion head handle fitted on doorTemple Architecture of the western himalayas by Omacanda Handa  Unique aspects of temple  The most unusual aspect of the temple is the two spherical rocks about one foot in diameter. The fun part is to lift these rocks on your shoulder and head and then throw them to the ground. It is believed that only a pious-hearted person can only lift up these rocks. The hanging of trophies on the temple wall is another unique aspect. Matches are played between teams of local gods. On winning, the trophy is awarded and hanged on the interior walls. On the premises one can notice numerous goats roaming. It is believed that whatever one wishes in this temple, Mahasu Devta fulfills it, provided that on the fulfillment one has to bring a certain number of goats to Mahasu Devta Temple. After prayers the goats are set free to roam on the premises. Legend of Chaturmukha Naga  Mahasu Devta has to yield before another powerful deity: the Chaturmukha Devta of the Kotgarh-Khaneti area of the Satluj valley in the Simla district. It is said that Chaturmukha Devta happened to be the guest of the Mahasu Devta at Hanol while he was returning from pilgrimage of Kedarnath. The devil attendant of Mahasu Devta, Shirpal, harassed the deity and his attendant during the night and they had to spend a sleepless night at Hanol. The Chaturmukha Devta took exception to the misconduct of that attendant. He made his displeasure known to Mahasu Devta and caused a man with his bullock yoked to a plough ram into his temple. Mahasu Devta begged for mercy, but Chaturmukh Devta can only be calmed down after the offender was surrendered to him as a captive. Shirpal later earned the confidence of Chaturmukh Devta who made him his wazir. And Build a Special Temple for Shirpal near his Temple. Shirpal Temple is also in Bhali, Kotgarh where the Bhalaik Family Worship him. Pavasi Devata Temple Pavasi Devta is the second brother of Mahasu Devta. The Pavasi Devta Temple is just across the River Tons on a hillock. The temple is about 2 km from Mahasu Devta Temple. A road from Mahasu Devta Temple goes one km downward toward the suspension bridge at the river. On crossing, one enters Thadiyar, a small village in Uttarkashi district. Then footpath goes up the hill about 1 km to reach Pavasi Devta Temple. Lord Bashik's Temple,mandrath Visiting Accommodation The Garhwal Mandal Vikas Nigam guest house ( now under PPP mode with BIVA Hospitality) is the reasonable and comfortable accommodation option at Hanol. It has six rooms and a dormitory. Accommodation is also available on the premises of the temple. Accessibility The Mahasu Devta Temple is about 180 km from Dehradun via Chakrata. It takes about seven hours from this route. The road is narrow and difficult during rainy season. Another route to reach this temple is via Mussoorie, Purola, Naugaon. This route is much better than the former one and takes approximately the same time to reach. The temple is also connected to Shimla via Chaupal and via Jubbal. The nearest airport is the Jolly Grant Airport, Dehradun. The nearest railway terminus is also at Dehradun. Best time to visit In summer (March to May) The climate is very pleasant. Most of the pilgrims visit temple during this time. In the rainy season (July to September) there is mild rainfall. Most of the roads are slippery during this season. In winter (November to February) the weather is chilly.

It serves the 14411 ZIP Code, covering the village and town of Albion plus neighboring sections of the towns of Barre and Gaines. It is a brick Colonial Revival building erected in the late 1930s. In the lobby is a mural of the nearby Erie Canal. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988 along with many other present and former post offices in the state. While it is within the boundaries of the Orleans County Courthouse Historic District, it is not considered a contributing property to that district since it was built after that district's period of significance. Note: This includes Building The post office is located on the southwest corner of the intersection of Main and East State streets in the center of Albion. Across from it is the county courthouse, screened by a small village green planted with mature trees. North of it is the Swan Library, an 1840 Greek Revival residence later converted into a Colonial Revival library; to the south is a former residence from the 1830s used now as the Cornell Cooperative Extension offices for the county. Across the intersection at the northeast corner is the First Presbyterian Church, a stone building with a steeple, the tallest structure in Orleans County. Main Street descends slightly to the north, into Albion's other historic district, the more commercial North Main-Bank Streets area, ending at the New York State Barge Canal, the former route of the Erie Canal. The building itself is a five-bay single-story structure on a stone water table faced in brick. The main block has a gently sloped gable roof, its fields finished in clapboard. set off by a denticulated cornice at the roofline and topped with a copper roof. It is pierced at the center by a square cupola with quoins, Doric pilasters at the corners framing six-over-six sash windows and an ogival cap with weathervane. The rear wing has the cornice but is flat- roofed. It has a parapet with limestone coping. Limestone sills and lintels frame the 12-over-12 double-hung sash windows on all facades. A single lunette is located in each gable field. In the east face's frieze, bronze letters spelling out \\"UNITED STATES POST OFFICE\\" are located above the main entrance, with \\"ALBION\\" and \\"NEW YORK\\" on the brick below flanking the entrance arch. A datestone is at the northeast corner. Granite steps with original iron railings and lampposts, joined by a modern wheelchair ramp on the north, rise to the centrally located main entrance. The entrance is flanked by two engaged fluted Doric pilasters and columns. They support an entablature with denticulated cornice to which a later piece of wood has been affixed with metallic letters saying \\"ZIP 14411\\". Above is a blind fanlight with an aluminum eagle. Inside the modern double doors open into a wooden vestibule articulated by narrow paneled pilasters and multi-pane sash. The main lobby floor is of red and brown ceramic tile with a red border and buff wainscoting. Above that the walls and ceiling, including the cornice between them, is plaster. Many original features, including the screenline, metal grilles, lockboxes, interior doors and surrounds, two wooden customer tables, one set of lockboxes and a bulletin case. A mural depicting ships on the canal is high on the wall above the postmaster's office. History From its designation as the new county's seat in 1824 through its days of prosperity as a canal town and the central shipping point for the Medina sandstone quarried nearby, Albion had managed to get by without its own post office building. In the early 20th century the mail was handled out of a rented storefront on East Bank Street. By the 1920s that became outmoded, and the postal authorities decided it was time for a dedicated building. A 1931 amendment to the Public Buildings Act of 1926 authorized the new structure as a relief measure for the Depression. Ground was not broken until 1936, after two Greek Revival houses on the site were demolished. New York City contractors Andover & Associates built the new post office for a cost of $52,699 ($ in contemporary dollars). It opened in 1937. Louis Simon, Supervising Architect at the Treasury Department, which had design responsibilities for most federal buildings, employed the same Colonial Revival design he had used for 12 other post offices in the state, the largest group of similar post offices across the state. This reflects both the Treasury's interest in standardization and its preference, during the Depression, for Colonial Revival as its preferred mode. The design of Albion's post office is one of the most typical of that group, lacking some of the variations found at the others. In 1939 Judson Smith's Along the Barge Canal mural was added to the lobby. It had been commissioned after he won one the competitions held by the Treasury's Section of Fine Arts, which oversaw the public art in post offices at the time. Other than the replacement of the original lobby lighting with more modern equipment, there have been few changes to the building since then. Six decades later, when the Orleans County Courthouse Historic District, was created, its boundaries included the post office. Along with the county jail, it was one of the only two of the 35 properties in that district considered non-contributing to its historic character since it was built after the district's 1830–1910 period of significance. When the post office was listed on the National Register itself nine years later, it remained non-contributing despite its own status.

The village is above sea level on the eastern brow of a group of hills northeast of Oxford, in a slight saddle between two of the hills. Archaeology The course of the former Roman road that linked Dorchester on Thames with Alchester passes through the western part of the parish. In 1953 excavations up to east of the parish church found evidence of Roman occupation. Manor The Domesday Book records that in 1086 William the Conqueror's half-brother Odo, Bishop of Bayeux held the manor of Stanton St. John and Ilbert de Lacy was his principal tenant. De Lacy also held the manor in the adjacent parish of Forest Hill, but in about 1100 de Lacy's son forfeited both manors. After 1526 the manor of the village was granted to New College, Oxford. Parish church The Church of England parish church of Saint John the Baptist was built in the 12th century. The arcade between the nave and north aisle dates from this period and is in the Transitional style between Norman architecture and Early English Gothic. The chancel arch also is Transitional, but may have been rebuilt in about 1700. The chancel was rebuilt around the beginning of the 14th century and is a high quality example of the transition from Early English (its side windows) to the Decorated Gothic (its east window, which has unusual tracery). The south aisle was built late in the 14th century, with a clerestory above its arcade to light the nave. In the 15th century all but one of the windows in the north aisle were replaced with Perpendicular Gothic ones and the bell tower was built. The church furniture includes four early 16th century benches whose bench ends have unusual carvings of poppyheads, human heads and grotesque animals. The tower has a ring of five bells.Oxford Diocesan Guild of Church Bell Ringers, Oxford City Branch Ellis and Francis Knight of Reading cast the treble and fourth bells in 1652. Michael Darbie, an itinerant bellfounder, cast the third bell in 1656. Henry III Bagley of Chacombe, Northamptonshire cast the second bell in 1716, possibly at his foundry at Witney. Abraham II Rudhall of Gloucester cast the tenor bell in 1724, completing the current ring. Economic and social history John White's house The Holford Centre, formerly the parish school. On the right is the 18th-century teacher's house; on the left are the classrooms built in 1874 The village retains several 16th and 17th stone-built houses, including Manor Farm and John White's house. The Puritan minister John White (1575–1648) was born here. He was the vicar of Dorchester, Dorset, and was nicknamed the \\"Patriarch of Dorchester\\". White was instrumental in founding the New England colony of Massachusetts. A later John White ran Manor Farm on behalf of New College, and repaired the Manor Farm house in 1660. During the English Civil War, Royalist troops were stationed in the village in 1643 and 1644 as part of the defence of Oxford against Parliamentarian forces to the east. In 1646 Parliamentarian troops occupied the village during the siege of Oxford. An open field system of farming originally predominated in the parish. By 1706 a number of fields had been enclosed, but more than of common land remained until they were enclosed by an Act of Parliament in 1777. In 1717 Dame Elizabeth Holford left a bequest to be invested until it was large enough to endow a free school for the parish. Trustees to set up the school were appointed in 1759 and it started teaching in the vicarage in 1764. A school was built on land provided by New College and completed in 1767. In 1874 the schoolrooms were demolished and rebuilt to comply with the Education Act 1870. By the 1950s the school was a Church of England primary school. The school closed in 1984 and became the Holford Centre in 1989. It is now used by a pre-school and for other educational purposes.

It is a brick building erected in the early 1930s, serving the ZIP Code 14103, covering the village of Medina and neighboring portions of the towns of Ridgeway and Shelby. Its Colonial Revival style design is unique in the state, where many post office designs of the era were reused in different communities. Only in Salem, Indiana, was the design known to have been reused. In 1989 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places along with many other present and former post offices in the state. It is one of only two listed on the Register in Orleans County. The other is in Albion. Building The post office is located on the northeast corner of the intersection, on the western edge of downtown Medina, where commercial buildings transition to the residential areas of the village. The stone First Baptist Church, built in 1873, is on the southwest corner. On the northwest is an Italianate house that once housed the village's historical society, now just up Prospect near the Ridgeway town hall. Across West Center Street is a former gas station that has been converted into a branch bank, surrounded with a parking lot. To the east is the main commercial area of the village, later listed on the National Register itself as the Main Street Historic District. On the west is a neighborhood with many of the village's older houses with a few more churches scattered among them. The terrain is generally level. There is a narrow grassy strip in front of the building, with small shrubs on the east and a large nut tree on the west. A driveway on the east leads to parking in the rear, also accessible from West Avenue north of the building. The building itself is in two sections. On the south (front) is a one-story seven-by-one-bay main block. Its smooth-faced ashlar limestone exposed basement has granite-trimmed window wells with cast iron railings. Above it the post office is faced in brick with rust and blue accents laid in English bond and quoined at the corners. On top the hipped roof is shingled in slate. Stone trim on the facade includes the flat windowsills, a belt course at the attic line, corner blocks on the iron grilled vents above it corresponding to the windows below, and a denticulated molded cornice with played corbels above that alternate with recessed scalloping. Atop it is a very low parapet, also stone, with a raised frontispiece at the center featuring a carved stone eagle. The side elevations have a similar treatment. On the north is a three-by-three-bay rectangular wing with flat roof and plain stone cornice. Its windows have the same trim. A small one-by-two-bay wing on the north has a mailing platform on the east side. Stone steps lead up from the sidewalk to the main entrance, where a wheelchair ramp goes off to the west. The main entrance door is flanked by partially engaged limestone Ionic columns. Above it is a frieze with \\"U.S. POST OFFICE\\" carved into it, flanked by carved rosettes. Atop is a molded cornice in a Greek fret pattern topped by a broken pediment with carved swan's neck, patera and large acorn finial. The double glass doors open into an enameled vestibule with large windows and original interior doors. The lobby has mottled light brown marble wainscoting. Its plaster walls rise to a deep molded frieze and cornice at the ceiling. Other remaining original features are the grille above the door to the postmaster's office and the lockboxes. There is no mural or other public art in the building. History Medina's first post office was established in 1824, just before the opening of the Erie Canal. At that time it was operated out of Moore's Tavern, a frequent stopover for both packet boat crews moored in the harbor created by the canal's bend at the village. By 1904 it had moved to rented space on West Center Street. It was probably at that location in 1928 when Congress authorized a post office building for the village. After the Great Depression began the next year the project was funded. The land was purchased and the existing commercial buildings demolished in early 1931, and the post office opened the following year. Louis A. Simon, Superintendent of Architects at the Office of the Supervising Architect under James A. Wetmore, was the designer. Simon's design for the Medina post office is, like many others he designed for small towns in New York and other states at that time, in the Colonial Revival style. Unlike many of those other designs, this particularly ornate one was not reused anywhere else in the state. The only other known instance of its use is in Salem, Indiana. Some elements, such as the limestone belt course at attic level on a seven-bay front facade, did turn up on post offices in New York like the one in Saranac Lake, not listed on the Register due to its extensive alterations.

During the Second World War, students gained this practice at the Admiralty Shipyard, but towards the end of the 1940s, a new place was allocated using institute yachts, on Krestovsky island. At the end of the 1950s, the territory of the Yacht club SMTU became an island, when a rowing canal was dug on Krestovsky island in 1958-1960.

Its history can be traced back to the 12th century. Wood from Minwear Forest supported local industries from mediaeval times to the 19th century. Parish church The parish church is dedicated to St Womar. It appears on a 1578 map as Mynware. The church is a Grade II listed building dating from Norman times, but much of the original architecture was obscured by a 19th century restoration. Minwear is in the present-day Church in Wales parish of Jeffreyston with Reynoldston and Loveston and Martletwy with Lawrenny and Yerbeston. History The Sisters' House ruins The parish and tithes were granted to the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem in 1150. The order also had an establishment now known as the Sisters' House, today a ruin, but marked on the 1578 parish map of Pembrokeshire as Sisterhowses. In 1540 the order was ejected under the Dissolution of the Monasteries; the village had disappeared by 1850, leaving just the church and a farming hamlet. The 1870 Imperial Gazetteer describes the parish as covering with a population of 99 in 16 houses. Minwear Wood (or Minwear Forest), originally part of the mediaeval Narberth Forest which was recorded in the 12th century, was a deciduous forest until the 20th century, when conifers were planted. Before that, the wood was used for charcoal for the iron foundry at Blackpool Mill from 1730 and for shipbuilding until both industries declined. Today, riverside walks are a local attraction, where the variable salinity of the tidal river supports a wide range of plant and bird species.

He was the great-grand father of two British Queens, Anne and Mary II. Life He was born in London in 1576, the second son of William Aylesbury and Anne Poole, his wife. From Westminster School Aylesbury passed in 1598 to Christ Church, Oxford, where he took the degrees of B.A. and M.A. in 1602 and 1605 respectively. On leaving college he was appointed secretary to Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham, lord high admiral of England. He was continued in the post by George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, Nottingham's successor (1619), who befriended him actively, procuring for him the additional offices of one of the masters of requests with, from 19 April 1627, the title of baronet. He was Surveyor of the Navy from 1628 for four years, and naval commissioner inspecting the fleet at Portsmouth in 1630 with Phineas Pett.George Ernest Manwaring, William Gordon Perrin, The Life and Works of Sir Henry Mainwaring (1920), vol. I, pp. 141, 146, 210. In 1635 Aylesbury, jointly with Ralph Freeman, formed a commission exercising the powers of the Master of the Mint. This came about by the exclusion from the position of Robert Harley, in favour of the previous incumbent Randal Cranfield, who then died suddenly.Christopher Edgar Challis, A New History of the Royal Mint (1992), p. 279. In 1642 he was, as a steady royalist, stripped of his fortune and places, and on the death of the king retired with his family to Antwerp. He moved in 1652 to Breda, and there died in 1657 at the age of 81. Sir Thomas was married twice. His second marriage was to Anne Denman with whom he had five children: William Aylesbury, Thomas, Frances, Anne and Barbara. Frances married Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, by whom she became the mother of Anne Hyde, first wife of King James II of England. It is through Anne Hyde that he became the great-grandfather of her two daughters, the Queens Mary and Anne.

Besides his support, he also was a pupil or at times a collaborator.For Aylesbury's collaboration with Allen, see Brian Vickers, Occult Scientific Mentalities (1986), p. 84.

Another was Thomas Allen, of Oxford, whom he recommended to Buckingham, and who made him the depositary of his astrological writings.

These are all being rebranded COOP in 2018 Facilities The Chorlton-cum-Hardy Co-op funeral directors; in a former cinema Co-op Funeralcare operated Grenoside crematorium in Sheffield, Craigton crematorium in Glasgow, Stockport cemetery and crematorium in Greater Manchester, Emstrey cemetery and crematorium in Shropshire and Lichfield & District crematorium in Staffordshire. These were sold to Dignity in 2016. Co- op Funeralcare also operates Hinton Park, Poole and Wimbourne woodland burial parks in Dorset and Mayfields remembrance park in the Wirral, Merseyside under the Woodland Burials trading name. Co-op Funeralcare's coffin factory and workshop is the largest in the UK, producing over 100,000 coffins every year and supplying its funeral home network with its core range. The business sells memorial masonry throughout the funeral home network and manufactures headstones at a manufacturing facility in Glasgow, Scotland. Membership A co-operative is a business, but it also acts together to meet the common needs and aspirations of its members, sharing ownership and making decisions democratically. Co‑operatives are not about making profits for shareholders, but creating value for their members. The top priority is to provide the best possible services for members and to invest in the communities where they live. This gives co‑operatives a unique character and influences what they stand for.Statement on the Co-operative Identity (Definition) International Co-operative Alliance, Manchester, 1995 Members of The Co-operative Group and participating regional societies earn membership points on funeral and memorial masonry plans. Points are converted into dividend at a rate agreed annually by the Board. A number of regional co-operatives such as the Central England Co-operative and the Midcounties Co-operative also operate funeral homes under \\"The co-operative funeralcare\\" brand, though these are operated and managed independently.

V. Krishna Rao, was a politician and minister in Andhra Pradesh, India. Brief life sketch Mandali Venkata Krishna Rao, popularly known as Mandali, was born on 4 August 1926 in Pallevada village in Kaikaluru taluk of Krishna District, Andhra Pradesh, India. His Father Venkatramaiah was a school teacher in Bhavadevarapalle in Divi taluk of Krishna district. Sri Mandali had his elementary education at Pallevada and Bhavadevarapalle, high school education at Avanigadda and collegiate education in Hindu College, Machiliatnam. His political career started quite early in his life. During the Quit India Movement, he served as the President of the Avanigadda branch of the National Students Union. When the Congress party was banned in the aftermath of the great movement, he organized the party effectively in rural areas as the Secretary of Divi Taluk Congress Committee and participated in its underground activities. In 1945, he was chosen as the organizing Secretary of the District Students Congress. He represented the then Madras State in the Asian Students Conference held at Delhi in 1948. During 1948–52, he worked as the President of the district youth congress. He was the secretary of the Krishna District Congress Committee during 1953–56 and the Joint Secretary of the APCC during 1956–58. He also functioned as the convener for the constructive work committee and the Bhoodan Yagna Committee of the Pradesh Congress Committee. He was elected to the Lok Sabha from the Machilipatnam constituency in 1957 and served the Parliament during 1957–62. He was groomed in politics and into the Congress Party by his mentor, the late Sri Devabhaktuni Kotiswara Rao (Congress Kotiswara Rao) of Vemulapalli village. He served as the Vice- Chairmen of the Zilla Parishad, Krishna between 1963 and 1969. In 1970, he was unanimously elected as the President, Avanigadda Panchayat Samithi. He functioned as the general Secretary of the APCC between 1969 and 1972. In the General Elections of 1972, he was returned unopposed to the State Assembly for the Avanigadda constituency of Krishna District. Sri P.V.Narasimha Rao inducted him into the State Cabinet in 1972 and was given charge of Social Welfare and Fisheries portfolio till 1973 when the Presidents rule was imposed. He again joined Sri Vengal Rao's Cabinet as the Minister for Education and Cultural Affairs. He led the State delegation to the World Hindi Conference held at Nagpur in 1975 and went to Mauritius in 1976 to take part in the World Hindi Conference. He organized the first ever World Telugu Conference in 1975 with encouragement and support of the then Chief Minister, Sri Jalagam Vengal Rao and brought together all Telugus from all over the world. After the 1977 Andhra Pradesh cyclone he was involved in voluntary organisations to the area to provide immediate relief. The AP Voluntary Organizations and Social Workers Organizations, in recognition of his excellent service in the cyclone, presented him the Prabhakarji Memorial Award for the Best Social worker, 1978. In 1982, he Joined Sri Kotla Vijaya Bhaskara Reddy's Cabinet as the Minister for Co-operation.

He was again honoured as the \\"Suthradhari\\" at the third world conference in 1990 at Mauritius. An individual noted for Gandhian Ideals, his concern for the poor, downtrodden and oppressed could be compared to a galaxy of patriots that thronged India. His love for the country was proverbial but his love for Divi Seema region could be called almost an obsession. He was indeed the \\"Diviseema Gandhi\\". The state lost a noble soul on 27 September 1997, and the nation a devoted worker with great concern for the poor and the downtrodden. Mandali Venkata Krishna Rao Bridge The Road Bridge between Puligadda-Penumudi over Krishna river was named after him. It was opened for public on 28 May 2006 by the Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy. It was constructed at a cost of Rs. 71 crores. Several agitations were launched in the past demanding the construction of the bridge. The bridge will reduce the distances between deltaic regions of Krishna and Guntur districts. The distance between Avanigadda and Repalle would be reduced by 156 km, while the distance between Avanigadda and Tenali would come down by 114 km.

The property is owned by the Transport Asset Holding Entity, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. It is under the care of the Goulburn Crookwell Heritage Railway Inc.  History  Crookwell railway station was the terminal railway station of the Crookwell branch railway line. The station opened in 1902 with the opening of the line,Crookwell station. NSWrail.net, accessed 21 August 2009. and consisted of a platform with wooden station building on the down side of the line, a stock siding, goods siding, goods platform and a turntable. Most of the facilities remain in place, including the timber station building which is well maintained. Passenger services were withdrawn in 1974, and the line and station closed to goods traffic in 1985.  Description  The complex comprises a type 16, timber pioneer station building, completed in 1902; a corrugated iron lamp room, also completed in 1902; and a corrugated iron goods shed, also completed in 1902. Other structures include timber platform faces; a Sellers 1284/3.6941 turntable; a T233, gantry crane; an Avery weighbridge, erected in 1902; a loading bank; and an ash pit. The heritage area includes the surrounding yard and station precinct as landscape project, together with plantings, particularly pine trees. Artefacts include basins and signs.  Heritage listing  As at 24 November 2000, Crookwell railway station was a significant surviving pioneer terminus station and yard with most elements intact from the date of opening in 1902. It represents an early period of growth by the railways to areas of marginal revenue. This then was reflected in economic constraints causing a cutting back on the cost of railway construction. It is the best surviving such complex in the State and contributes to the townscape of Crookwell. The site retains its setting and significant details such as basins, signs, plantings. The line is now closed and the site re-used as an operating heritage railway and museum.

The line commenced at a junction with the Goulburn to Crookwell line at Roslyn station and ran for a distance of to the small town of Taralga. The line operated between 1926 and 1957 and is one of few lines in New South Wales that has been formally closed by an Act of Parliament. Today all track has been lifted and little trace remains of the infrastructure associated with the line. History Demand for a railway line to Taralga existed from the mid 19th century. The town grew significantly in the 1860s, however remained isolated particularly during wet weather, when the poor quality roads in the region could become impassable. A railway connection was seen as highly desirable if the town was to continue to prosper. In 1884, a delegation met with the Minister for Public Works requesting a survey be conducted of a potential route between Roslyn and Taralga, branching off the already surveyed Goulburn to Crookwell route, offering that any private land that would need to be resumed would be given to the Government to facilitate construction. It was not until 1915 that construction of the line by the Department of Public Works was authorised through the passing of the Roslyn to Taralga Railway Act (1915) No 49, at an estimated cost of £87,353. The Premier of New South Wales, Sir George Fuller turned the first sod on 8 January 1923, following delays due to World War I, which led to the estimated cost of construction rising to £139,700, part of which would be subsidised by charging higher rates for transporting goods on the line compared to the rest of the New South Wales Government Railways. and construction of the branch commenced, opening on 23 February 1926. Initial services consisted of a mixed train running three days per week between Roslyn and Taralga, a journey taking an hour and fifteen minutes that was timetabled to allow connections onward to Goulburn and Sydney. This soon became a daily service, however by 1930 it was cut back to twice a week due to a lack of traffic, with additional services operating only when demand required. The line was never profitable as traffic fell further and was formally closed on 1 May 1957, however the last train ran on the line in 1954. Typical goods carried on the line prior to its closure included livestock, wool and potatoes. The tracks were lifted and removed by 1959, and very little infrastructure remains except for the former station building and platforms at Strathaird.

In the late 13th or early 14th century a medieval undercroft was built adjacent to the hypocaust, with a house above. In 1864 a new floor was inserted at street level and a shop front was added in the 20th century. The ground floor is now used as a café. The remains of the hypocaust were found during the reconstruction of the property in 1864. They consist of 27 square columns in a rectangular chamber which originally contained 32 columns in eight rows of four.

He held battalion, brigade and divisional commands during the Second World War and immediately after, but is best known as the commander of the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade during the Korean War. After his involvement in Korea, he held a further divisional command, and then a senior administrative position in the army before retiring. In retirement, he continued his connection with the army, serving as Colonel of his former regiment, and assisting in writing the British official history of the Korean War. He was also appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of Wiltshire. Early life and military career Coad was born on 27 September 1906 at Portsmouth, Hampshire. He was educated at Felsted School and Royal Military College, Sandhurst. From Sandhurst he was commissioned into the British Army as a second lieutenant in the Wiltshire Regiment on 4 February 1926. He was soon bound for India to join the 1st Battalion. After a few years' service there he was posted to Shanghai, then one of the treaty ports, in January 1929, promoted to lieutenant on 4 February, and appointed as Deputy Assistant Provost Marshal from December that year. Coad returned to the United Kingdom in 1934 and was appointed adjutant of the 2nd Battalion, Wiltshires. He served with the battalion in Palestine during the Arab revolt. On 22 January 1937 he was seconded to the 4th Battalion, a Territorial Army (TA) unit, to serve as its adjutant, at the same time he was granted temporary rank as a captain in the TA. He was promoted to substantive captain on 18 March 1938. Second World War With the outbreak of the Second World War, Coad was promoted to acting major for service as an instructor in the 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division, he became a temporary major on 1 February 1940. In January 1941 he was appointed second-in-command of the 2nd Battalion, Wiltshires. By August 1942 he was an acting lieutenant colonel in command of the Battle School of the 43rd Division, now commanded by Major General Ivor Thomas, in Kent. He was then appointed Commanding Officer of the 5th Battalion, Dorset Regiment at the beginning of 1943. He was promoted substantive major on 4 February 1943. The 5th Dorsets participated in Operation Overlord (the Normandy Campaign) as part of the 130th Infantry Brigade, 43rd Division. On 10 July 1944, during the opening of Operation Jupiter, the unit was ordered to capture Chateau de Fontaine, near Fontaine-Étoupefour. They successfully captured the chateau, and were then ordered to take a further objective. Coad personally reconnoitred the route across open country, despite heavy machine gun and mortar fire. The attack was launched and the objective taken, but it could not be held. Coad withdrew his two furthest forward companies and prepared the chateau as a defensive position. As a result of his leadership on this occasion Coad was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) on 19 October 1944. The citation concluded: The brigade participated in the continued Allied advance from Paris to the Rhine, and in September 1944 was involved in the ill-fated Operation Market Garden. On 7 October 1944, Coad was promoted acting brigadier and given command of the 130th Brigade. A year later he was awarded a Bar to his DSO on 11 October 1945 for his leadership in the intervening period, which covered the Western Allied invasion of Germany. The citation remarked: After this Coad was promoted war substantive lieutenant colonel (and retained the temporary rank of brigadier). Then, on 28 January 1946 he was given command of the 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division, now part of the British Army of the Rhine, as an acting major general. He relinquished the command, and reverted to temporary brigadier on 10 March 1946. He returned to 130th Brigade, and then reverted to lieutenant colonel and returned to his own regiment, commanding the 2nd Wiltshires. He was then again made a brigadier and commanded 30th Infantry Brigade, before returning to 2nd Wiltshires again. He was promoted substantive lieutenant colonel on 8 February 1948. Korean War After returning to the UK from Germany in August 1948, he was again made a temporary brigadier, and given command of 27th Infantry Brigade. In June 1949, the brigade arrived in Hong Kong as part of Far East Land Forces (FARELF), and was designated United Kingdom Strategic Reserve, theoretically able to deploy anywhere in the world at ten days notice. On 6 April 1950 he was made a substantive colonel. A year after the brigade's arrival in Hong Kong, North Korean forces crossed the de facto border with South Korea, the 38th parallel, triggering the outbreak of the Korean War. On 6 July the British Cabinet decided not to send land forces to Korea. British forces were already heavily committed in Malaya in the developing Malayan Emergency, aid had been promised to the French in Vietnam, and there were fears that the escalating tensions could lead to China threatening Hong Kong. However, as July wore on the South Koreans and Americans suffered further reverses, and with the Foreign Office pointing out that the UK's standing as a world power, and its relationship with the US, was in danger of being jeopardised, on 25 July the Cabinet resolved to send land forces to Korea. The decision was announced in the House of Commons the following day by the Minister of Defence, Manny Shinwell who said: It was initially envisaged that the British contribution would consist of 29th Infantry Brigade. This was based in the UK, and reservists had to be recalled to bring it up to strength. As the situation Korea continued to worsen, it was decided to send other British forces from closer at hand, and this decision was announced in the Commons on 20 August 1950. Coad's brigade, then consisting of the first battalions of the Middlesex Regiment, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders and Leicestershire Regiment, plus some supporting services, was selected to form this force. The Leicesters were left in Hong Kong due to the ongoing concern over China's attitude. The brigade had no artillery, and little transport, Coad was told he would have to rely on US support and supplies, including rations. Compounding the difficulties of organising the move to Korea, most of the men had just been given leave after a hard exercise, and were on their way into Hong Kong City for a Friday night out, and would prove hard to retrieve over the weekend. Both battalions were somewhat under strength, and this problem was exacerbated by a government decision that those under 19 should not serve in combat, volunteers were hurriedly drawn from other units in Hong Kong to try to get the battalions up to establishment. Map of the Pusan Perimeter August–September 1950 Coad flew into Pusan on 27 August 1950, ahead of the rest of the brigade which travelled on the aircraft carrier and cruiser and arrived in Korea on 29 August, just nine days after the decision to deploy them was officially announced. They joined the defence of the Pusan Perimeter. One battalion went into action on 3 September, with the brigade as a whole being given its own section of the front line along the Naktong River, south- west of Taegu on 5 September. The brigade's first casualties came on 6 September, Private Reginald Streeter of the Middlesexes and Captain Neil Buchanan and his batman, Private Tam Taylor, of the Argylls. With the pressure somewhat relieved following the amphibious landings at Inchon on 15 September, the brigade joined the subsequent breakout from Pusan, and then covered the flank of the main US advance aimed at retaking Seoul. On 22 September the brigade crossed the Naktong by a hurriedly constructed bridge that could only be walked over in single file. To secure the road on the other side, the brigade, now attached to 24th Infantry Division (United States), was ordered to take high ground on either side. To the right of the road were \\"Plum Pudding Hill\\" (their name for it), three miles south of Songju, and a 900-foot high feature which later became known as Middlesex Hill. The Middlesexes, supported by two American tanks, took Plum Pudding at the point of the bayonet, and then took Middlesex Hill. Total casualties were one officer and six other ranks killed and seven wounded. Now the brigade had to take the high ground on the left of the road. Early on 23 September the Argylls began the Battle of Hill 282, suffering the heaviest casualties so far as a result of both heavy fighting with North Korean force and a communications failure which led to an attack by US aircraft in a \\"friendly-fire\\" incident. The Argylls' second in command, Major Kenneth Muir was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross for his efforts (ultimately unsuccessful) to hold the position. In total the Argylls suffered two officers and eleven other ranks dead, four officers and seventy OR wounded, and two missing, about forty percent of these casualties being from the US airstrike. Despite this setback the brigade participated in the capture of Songju on 24 September, working with 1st Battalion, 19th Infantry Regiment (United States). The brigade was then detached from 24th Division, and placed under the command of Eighth United States Army. On 28 September 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment arrived in Korea and they were attached to the brigade to bring it back up to strength. The Australians had been on occupation duties in Japan, and with just two weeks training were thrown into the fighting in Korea. The brigade was now retitled 27th British Commonwealth Brigade. With the status quo ante bellum now restored, the Commander-in-Chief of UN Forces, Douglas MacArthur offered surrender terms, but these were rejected, so the UN forces began their advance into North Korea.

The film stars Jack Holt, Lila Lee and Ralph Graves, who also came up with the story, for which Capra wrote the dialogue. Dedicated to the United States Marine Corps, the production was greatly aided by their full cooperation. Plot College football player Lefty Phelps (Ralph Graves) causes his school to lose the big game when he gets disoriented after a tackle and runs the wrong way. After being treated decently by gruff U.S. Marine Corps Sergeant \\"Panama\\" Williams (Jack Holt), a spectator, Phelps decides to enlist in the Marines himself. He is selected to attend pilot training school at Naval Air Station Pensacola, where Williams is a flying instructor. When Williams finally recognizes Lefty, he befriends him and takes him under his wing. On his first attempt at solo flight, however, Lefty is taunted about the football game by fellow recruit Steve Roberts (Harold Goodwin), and cannot take off, resulting in a crash. Panama rescues Lefty from the burning aircraft, suffering burns to his hands. Lefty is \\"washed out\\" by his squadron commander, Major Rowell (Alan Roscoe). Lefty is taken to the base hospital, where he falls for Navy nurse Elinor Murray (Lila Lee). When the \\"Flying Devils\\" squadron is sent to quell bandit attacks by the notorious General Lobo in Nicaragua, Panama arranges for Lefty to accompany him as his mechanic. Panama shows Lefty a photograph of Elinor, the love of his life, not knowing Lefty is in love with her too. When Elinor is sent to Nicaragua, she does not understand the guilt-stricken Lefty's cool reception. When the girl-shy Panama asks Lefty to propose to Elinor on his behalf, Elinor confesses her love for him instead, after which Panama accuses Lefty of betrayal. An urgent call for help by a Marine outpost under bandit attack stops any confrontation. Lefty flies as gunner for Steve Roberts, who makes fun of him about shooting in the right direction. During the mission, their aircraft is shot down in a swamp. Unwilling to join in the rescue, Panama reports in sick, but once Elinor convinces him that Lefty never betrayed him, he flies his own solo rescue mission. At the crash site, Roberts dies of his injuries and is cremated by Lefty using their aircraft as a funeral pyre. Panama finds Lefty but is wounded by bandits led by General Lobo, after his landing. Lefty kills the attacking bandits, takes off, and brings the pair back, putting on an impressive flying display over the base that includes safely landing the aircraft after it loses a wheel. Sometime later, Lefty has won his wings and is now an instructor at the school, married to Elinor. When his wife arrives in their new car, Lefty accidentally pulls away in reverse.

Rowell * uncredited Production Curtiss OC-2s in flight, c. 1929 At the time of production, Jack Holt's career with Columbia Pictures was as a leading man. Capra specifically asked for him to star as the laconic pilot and with the acquiescence of studio head Harry Cohen, his role in Flight was emblematic of the studio's reliance on the popular and profitable action film.Dick 1992, p. 78. Receiving full cooperation from the Marine Corps, including the use of facilities and personnel at Naval Base San Diego and NAS North Island, provided the authentic settings Capra required.Capra 1971, pp. 108–109. The initial flying sequence depicts the landing and taxi of an FB-1 fighter, with Holt stepping from the cockpit. { The flight training sequences were staged using Consolidated NY-1B trainers based at San Diego. Nine Marine Corps Curtiss OC-2 aircraft from Marine Attack Squadron 231 (VMA-231) were featured in the aerial combat sequences. The squadron, along with VO-10M (Marine Observation Squadron 10), also prominently appeared in the Devil Dogs of the Air (1935).McBride 1992, p. 205. A total of 28 aircraft were at Capra's disposal and with the benefit of using actual aircraft, Capra did not have to rely on \\"process shots\\" or special effects which was the standard of the day, although dangerous crash scenes and a mass night takeoff were staged using studio miniatures. Along with principal aerial photographer, Elmer Dyer, who filmed from a camera-equipped aircraft, Capra flew alongside in a director's aircraft to coordinate the aerial scenes. Jack Holt who was an accomplished pilot, flew in the film but crashed during one scene. Capra pushed for aerial close-ups and in one scene, wanted Holt to stand up in the cockpit but his parachute had deployed, and he remained seated, causing the scene to be abandoned. Noted Marine Corps exhibition pilots Lts. Bill Williams and Jerry Jerome were also involved in the production.Capra 1971, p. 109. Historical accuracy Capra also shot on location in La Mesa and Fallbrook, California, used for the Nicaragua scenes. Although a fictional treatment, the military action depicted in Nicaragua was based on the Battle of Ocotal on July 16, 1927 when the Marines battled hundreds of Sandinista rebels. Importing fire ants for the swamp scene became controversial as the ants were capable of biting through the actors' clothing. The opening scene where the football star takes off in the wrong direction was based on Capra's recalling a notable incident he witnessed, along with Columbia studio boss Harry Cohn, during the 1929 Rose Bowl when Roy Riegels was tackled by his own team after picking up a fumble and running toward his own goal line. Footage from the actual game is used. Reception Flight garnered a lukewarm response from critics and did well at the box office.Capra 1971, pp. 111–112. Typical of the reviews was the one appearing in The New York Times: \\"During those all too brief moments when the producer skips away from melodramatic flubdub, tedious romantic passages and slapstick comedy and turns to scenes of airplanes in formation and flying stunts, 'Flight,' a talking film presented last night by Columbia Pictures Corporation at the George M. Cohan and dedicated to the United States Marines, is well worth watching.\\"Hall, Mordaunt. \\"Review: Flight.\\" The New York Times, September 14, 1929. In a later day review, Alun Evans lumped the film in with similar propaganda films of the silent era that depicted US involvement in Mexican and Latin American conflicts.Evans 2000, p. 71. Largely forgotten today, Flight is representative of Capra's early period and fits in well with the silent Submarine (1928) and later Dirigible (1931) as a trio of military- themed productions. Now available in home video, the film is rarely broadcast as it is considered a minor work in the Capra filmology. References Notes Citations Bibliography * Blottner, Gene.

Overview Up until now, Berlino appears to be mute. However, this condition does not seem to prevent him from giving interviews to the media.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrPdceULZQ Berlino has been referred to as the \\"star\\" of the 2009 Championships and been noted by athletes, such as Usain Bolt by wearing a T-shirt with \\"ICH BIN EIN BERLINO\\" (\\"I am a Berlino\\", referring to John F. Kennedy's famous West Berlin speech) written on it during warm up for the 200 meter final. The iconic image of the games is the famous photograph of Berlino and Usain Bolt down on one knee, twinned in mutual respect, sharing a mimed lightning-bolt pose to celebrate victory and a new world record. In an interview, published after the World Championships in Berlin, Usain Bolt said: \\"Berlino and I have become friends. We exchanged telephone numbers.\\" While celebrating winning the gold in 400 meter hurdles, Melaine Walker took a piggy-back off Berlino, who promptly ran into a stack of hurdles. The diverse videos of this have been watched over 400,000 times (26.08.2009) and have been called \\"a YouTube classic.\\" He was also involved in some controversy during the men's 10,000m final in which he ran part of the race down the back strait with the athletes cheering them on. This annoyed some traditionalists and it was rumoured that the IAAF told him to reel in the enthusiasm after this act.

After being delivered in the beginning of August 2009, the Berlino teddies at first sold slow. Due to the increasing popularity of the mascot during the games, Berlino soon became a bestseller and - before the end of the games - was out of stock.

He studied science at the University of Budapest before obtaining his PhD in zoology at the University of Innsbruck in Austria in 1950. At the end of that year he emigrated to Australia. There he first worked in the Department of Zoology at the University of Western Australia for 3 years, before pursuing a career with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). Bornemissza was known for his work on the Australian Dung Beetle Project (1965–1985) while working at CSIRO's Division of Entomology. He wrote scientific papers and books base on his research and contributed a collection of mounted beetle specimens to the Australian National Insect Collection and the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery. In 2001 he was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia for his services to Australian entomology. Early life and education Bornemissza was born in Baja, Hungary, to Katalin Bornemissza and Ferenc Bornemissza, an engineer. He began collecting and studying beetles in the forests around his hometown during his mid-teens and also volunteered in museums and scientific institutions in Budapest. Career and research Early career After receiving his doctorate from the University of Innsbrück in Austria, Bornemissza fled central Europe to escape the post-World War II Soviet regimes and travelled to Western Australia, where he arrived on 31 December 1950. Six months after arriving on Australian shores, while working with the Department of Zoology at the University of Western Australia,Collis, B (2002) Fields of Discovery: Australia’s CSIRO, pub. Allen & Unwin, Australia, ch. 2, p 46, he remarked upon the large number of old, dry cow dung pads that covered cattle grazing fields near Wooroloo, Western Australia \\\\- Riley, Kathy (July 2009), Beetle Mania, Australian Geographic and compared this to the relatively dung-free cattle fields of his native Hungary. In Hungary and elsewhere in the world, dung beetles have adapted to be able to roll and bury large, moist cattle dung pads but native Australian beetles, which co-evolved alongside the marsupials, were not able to utilise bovine dung, since cattle were only relatively recently introduced to Australia in the 1880s. Bornemissza hypothesised that the introduction of foreign dung beetle species that were able to roll and bury cattle dung pads would aid not only Australia's soil fertility by recycling the dung nutrients back into the ground, but would also reduce the number of pestilent flies and parasitic worms which use the dung pads as a breeding ground. Bornemissza joined CSIRO in 1955 and continued to advocate for the introduction of bovine dung beetles to Australia whilst working on a number of other projects and studies. The Australian Dung Beetle Project subsequently secured funding from the Australian Meat Research Committee and commenced in 1965.Bornemissza, G. F. (1976), The Australian dung beetle project 1965-1975, Australian Meat Research Committee Review 30:1-30 Beyond his work in entomology, during the 1950s and 1960s Dr Bornemissza was also a keen amateur filmmaker. In 1962 he won the Kodak Trophy for the 8mm Best Australian Entry at the Australian Amateur Cine Society 23rd International Gold Cup Competition for his entry \\"The Burning Bush\\", a documentary on the effect of bushfires on Australian ecosystems which made extensive use of time lapse photography. The Australian Dung Beetle Project 1965-1985 From 1965, Bornemissza travelled extensively in search of suitable dung beetles to introduce to Australia. \\\\- George Bornemissza OAM, Winner of the Inaugural Australian Geographic Society Conservationist of the Year Award (2008) The first dung beetles to be introduced to Australia came from Hawaii, where beetles had already been introduced from Africa in order to biologically control populations of the pestilent horn fly. Samples of the species Onthophagus gazella were transported to Australia where they were bred in sterile conditions before being released in Queensland in 1968. After introduction, they became established across a large area of tropical Australia. It was realised that due to periods of seasonal inactivity by O. gazella, further beetle species were needed to fill in the gaps in climatic and habitat preference and peak time of beetle activity. To this end, Bornemissza travelled to Pretoria in 1970 where he helped establish a South African branch of the Australian Dung Beetle Research Unit. For 9 years,Edwards, P (2007), Introduced Dung Beetles in Australia 1967-2007: current status and future directions, Landcare Australia he carried out research in order to find species of dung beetle that would not only be able to remove the bovine dung pads in Australia, but also those that would thrive in the varying climates found all over the continent. It was also important that the beetles chosen, and the tiny parasites that the beetles carry, would not themselves become pests and so strict quarantining procedures were devised and developed.Bornemissza, G. F. (1979), The Australian Dung Beetle Research Unit in Pretoria, South African Journal of Science 75 (6): 257-260 In total, 43 species of beetle from Africa and Europe were introduced to Australia by CSIRO between 1968 and 1984. Project Outcomes and Impact The funding for the Australian Dung Beetle Project was withdrawn in 1985 after the restructuring of the Australian Meat Research Committee, but Bornemissza believed that the full potential of the project had yet to be realised. He said, \\"The introduction of exotic dung beetles and their subsequent establishment in Australia is now history, and a very successful one at that. However, it fell short in filling all the climatic areas with their vast variety of habitats\\". This last statement was made in a report by Penny Edwards in 2007, which summarised investigations made by Landcare Australia to evaluate the distribution and abundance of introduced species of dung beetle across Australia. The investigation found that 23 of the 43 species of dung beetle introduced by Bornemissza and his team were still established and thriving all over Australia, and it recommended that further research be carried out in order to fill the empty ecological niches with new species of introduced dung beetle. The work Bornemissza and his team undertook with the Australian Dung Beetle Project is credited with being the reason why Australians today can enjoy a terrace café culture. The success of the project in reducing the number of bush flies by 90% has meant that outside dining is no longer illegal, as it once was in the 1950s. The \\"Australian Salute\\", a flick of the hand recognised by older generations of Australians as the only solution to rid oneself of flies at that time, is now a dwindling gesture.Cribb, J (11 October 2006) Fly times when the dry comes, The AustralianDiscovering the beetles that let Australians dine outdoors, For Enterprise: The Rolex Awards Journal 21 (2007) pp 44-45, pub. Rolex SA, Geneva The Australian Dung Beetle Project is also said to have affected soil, water and pasture health that is \\"undoubtedly worth many millions of dollars a year\\".The Queensland Dung Beetle Project (2002), Improving sustainable land management systems in Queensland using Beetles: Final report of the 2001-2002 Queensland Dung Beetle Project, page 3 Retirement and further work Bornemissza moved to Tasmania in 1979 and formally retired in 1983 but continued to work privately to foster awareness of beetles and conservation issues. In retirement he compiled a collection of beetles for public display, which he donated to the Australian National Insect Collection in Canberra. Following this 3-year project he commenced in 1993 a 20-year private project to assemble the largest collection of beetles ever presented for public display. Entitled George Bornemissza's Forest Beauties of the Beetle World: A Tribute to Biodiversity and an Appeal for its Preservation, the collection is structured into five sections focussed on size range, allometry, colour, secondary sexual dimorphism and zoogeography. As the sections were completed they were donated to the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery. The Bornemissza Collection of beetles was the subject of an episode of the TV show \\"Collectors\\" shown on the Australian television channel ABC in 2005. Bornemissza also contributed to habitat conservation initiatives in Tasmania. He assessed, with Karyl Michaels, the effect of clearfelling and slash-burning of forest on lucanid beetles in Tasmania. These beetles feed on and reproduce in decaying wood and it was found that forest clearing practices have led to a significant decrease in the distribution and abundance of several species. Some, including Bornemissza's Stag Beetle (Hoplogonus bornemisszai), are now considered endangered species and improved forest management strategies in Tasmania are recommended.Michaels, K. and Bornemissza, G.

She never married, but she had many illegitimate children.Marquis d'Argenson, Mémoires, Paris, 1857, vol. III p. 366 Biography Born at the Hôtel de Conti in Paris Louise Adélaïde was the youngest surviving daughter of François Louis, Prince of Conti and his wife Marie Thérèse de Bourbon. From birth, Louise Adélaïde was known by her style of Mademoiselle de La Roche-sur-Yon. Her oldest sister was Marie Anne de Bourbon (1689–1720), future Princess of Condé; her oldest surviving brother was Louis Armand de Bourbon, the future Prince of Conti. The year after her birth, her father was made the Titular King of Poland by Louis XIV but later declined the offer due to his affections for the Duchess of Bourbon, his mistress and daughter of the king. On 16 February 1707 she was baptised in the Royal Chapel of Versailles and named in honour of Louis, Grand Dauphin and Marie Adélaïde, Duchess of Burgundy. In 1709, Mademoiselle de La Roche-sur-Yon lost her father and her brother succeeded as Prince of Conti. Her older sister married in 1713 at the age of 24; the groom was her maternal cousin Louis Henri, Duke of Bourbon. Louise Adélaïde never married, although in 1748, a marriage was projected with Stanisław I Leszczyński, former King of PolandMarquis d'Argenson, Mémoires, Paris, 1857, vol. III p. 204 The Hôtel de La Roche-sur-Yon on the 1739 Turgot map of Paris At the death of her sister the Princess of Condé in 1720, Louise Adélaïde was given all property owned by the Princess – much to the annoyance of the Prince of Condé, Duke of Bourbon.Known as the Duke of Bourbon In 1732 her mother died having reconciled with her children – the Conti family had been estranged from their mother due to their father's behaviour. It was around this time that she purchased the Hôtel de Lauzun on the quai Malaquais from the widow of the Duke de Lauzun. At that time it became known as Hôtel de La Roche-sur-Yon and is shown with this name on the 1739 Turgot map of Paris.

One of the key positions of the book included the criticism of Immanuel Kant, arguing that the philosopher failed to realize that knowledge, as mirrored by the human mind is the product of evolutionary adaptations. Kant has maintained that our consciousness or our description and judgments about the world could never mirror the world as it really is so we can not simply take in the raw data that the world provides nor impose our forms on the world. Lorenz disputed this, saying it is inconceivable that - through chance mutations and selective retention - the world fashioned an instrument of cognition that grossly misleads man about such world. He said that we can determine the reliability of the mirror by looking behind it.  Summary  Lorenz summarizes his life's work into his own philosophy: Evolution is the process of growing perception of the outer world by living nature itself. Stepping from simple to higher organized organisms, Lorenz shows how they gain and benefit from information. The methods mirrored by organs have been created in the course of evolution as the natural history of this organism. In the book, Lorenz uses the mirror as a simple model of the human brain that reflects the part of the stream of information from the outside world it is able to \\"see\\". He argued that merely looking outward into the mirror ignores the fact that the mirror has a non- reflecting side, which is also a part and parcel of reality. The backside of the mirror was created by evolution to gather as much information as needed to better survive. The picture in the mirror is what we see within our mind. Within our cultural evolution we have extended this picture in the mirror by inventing instruments that transform the most needed of the invisible to something visible. The back side of the mirror is acting for itself as it processes the incoming information to improve speed and effectiveness. By that human inventions like logical conclusions are always in danger to be manipulated by these hardwired prejudices in our brain. The book gives a hypothesis how consciousness was invented by evolution. Main topics * Fulguratio, the flash of lightning, denotes the act of creation of a totally new talent of a system, created by the combination of two other systems with talents much less than those of the new system. The book shows the \\"invention\\" of a feedback loop by this process. * Imprinting, is the phase-sensitive learning of an individual that is not reversible. It's a static program run only once. * Habituation is the learning method to distinguish important information from unimportant by analysing its frequency of occurrence and its impact. * Conditioning by reinforcement, occurs when an event following a response causes an increase in the probability of that response occurring in the future. The ability to do this kind of learning is hardwired in our brain and is based on the principle of causality. The discovery of causality (which is a substantial element of science and Buddhism) was a major step of evolution in analysing the outer world. * Pattern matching is the abstraction of different appearances into the identification of being one object and is available only in highly organized creatures * Exploratory behaviour is the urge of the highest developed creatures on earth to go on with learning after maturity and leads to self-exploration which is the base for consciousness.

The awards were given by an academy composed of 400 people, including music publishers, journalists, deejays, music producers, managers, retailers and consumers. The first Italian Music Awards ceremony was held on 5 February 2001, to honor musical accomplishments for the period between 1 December 1999 and 30 November 2000, while the fourth and last awards ceremony was held on 15 December 2003. The fifth edition of the awards was initially scheduled to be held in the end of 2004, but after being postponed in February 2004 and then in the Spring of 2004, it was canceled due to the lack of a broadcast agreement with the Italian TV networks. The gap left by the Italian Music Awards was later filled by the Wind Music Awards, established in 2007.

He was briefly a Reform Party Member of Parliament. Biography A son of Sir Thomas Mackenzie, who was High Commissioner in London and was previously a Liberal politician (and Prime Minister in 1912), he enlisted in the Army in World War I. He was blinded at Chunak Bair during the Gallipoli campaign and was sent to the No. 2 New Zealand General Hospital at Walton-on-Thames to convalesce. At the hospital he was one of the patients of his sister Mary, who was a member of the Voluntary Aid Detachment here. After recovering he was sent to the live with other blind soldiers in a house in Portland before attending St Dunstan's, the Institute for the Bling Soldiers and Sailors. At the institute he learnt Braille as well as how to type. He was active in organisations for the blind; he was attached to the UN and was Chairman of the World Braille Council. He was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 1935 New Year Honours. Later that year he was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal. Mackenzie won the Auckland East electorate in a 1921 by-election after the resignation of Arthur Myers, but was defeated in the next election in 1922 by John A. Lee. Mackenzie died in Auckland in 1966, and his ashes were buried in the Dunedin Northern Cemetery.

The play was written by John Heywood, a courtier, musician and playwright during the reigns of Henry VIII, Edward VI and Mary I and published by his brother-in-law, William Rastell, in 1533 as The Play of the Wether, a new and mery interlude of all maner of Wethers. It represents the Roman deity Jupiter on earth asking mortals to make cases for their preferred weather following heavenly dissension among the gods. It is the first published play to nominate \\"The Vice\\" on its title page. Date There has been much critical debate concerning the dating of the play since David Bevington's assertion in 1968 that it was written in the 1520s. Greg Walker suggested that it was written and performed between 1529-30 but later modified this to 1533 on the basis of the argument made by Axton and Happe in the introduction to their edition of Heywood's plays. The play is often dated on internal evidence, particularly the so-called ‘new moon’ speech which seems to allude to the changing of King Henry VIII's consort from Catherine of Aragon to Anne Boleyn and his quest for a male heir. More recent research into the play conducted as part of the Oxford Brookes University/Historic Royal Palaces project, \\"Staging the Henrician Court\\", has suggested a date of Christmas 1532/3. As there were no Christmas revels in 1531 because of Catherine's absence from court, and the coronation of Anne Boleyn took place in June 1533, a court performance can be speculatively dated to Christmas 1532, prior to the secret marriage of Henry and Anne. Synopsis Having resolved the warring factions of Aeolus, Phoebus, Saturn and Phoebe in his heavenly parliament, Jupiter descends to earth to solicit the views of Englishmen and women as to the ideal state of the weather and so create harmony between earth and heaven. To aid him in his task he appoints Merry Report, who publishes the purpose of Jupiter's descent across the country, and mediates who does and who does not gain direct access to Jupiter to make their case. The play then depicts a series of English citizens petitioning for their preferred weather. The first to enter is the Gentleman, who desires fair and temperate weather for his hunting. The Merchant petitions for fair weather with gusts to help move his ships through the seas. The Ranger asks for windier weather so that he can augment his income by selling fallen branches. When the Water-miller comes on- stage to argue for rain to power his mill, he is joined by the Wind-miller who counter-argues for wind and no rain to power his own. A lengthy debate ensues between the two Millers as to which of their mills is more useful than the other and therefore who should have their desired weather. Female characters then enter the stage in the form of the Gentlewoman who essentially petitions for no weather so that when she leaves the house she is not exposed to the elements and her beauty is able to remain intact, and the Laundress who requires the heat of the sun to dry her clothes. As with the Millers, their debate concerns who is the more deserving – is it a beautiful woman or an industrious one? Their dialogue is interspersed throughout with the bawdy of Merry Report. Finally, a young boy enters the stage asking for wintry weather that he may trap birds and have snowball fights with his friends. As Jupiter has only granted direct access to his person to the Gentleman and the Merchant, Merry Report then summarises the other characters’ arguments for the god so that he can deliver his judgement. Having heard the contrary and differing needs of his earthly subjects, Jupiter reasons that no one member of society is more important than another, and that they all need at least some part of the weather they desire to pursue their pastimes and occupations. He therefore declares that the weather will remain exactly as it was before so that everyone is happy for at least some of the time. Sources The Play of the Weather is an early instance of the interlude or moral interlude, a theatrical development from the morality play and a precursor to the late Tudor drama in its portrayal of people from the lower classes rather than noble, biblical or classical characters. It tends to be grouped with a series of plays from Mankind onwards such as Gentleness and Nobility, Magnificence, Youth and Hick Scorner. It was published in quick succession with a number of Heywood's other interludes such as Johan Johan, The Pardoner and the Frere and The Play of Love. In 1907, Joseph Quincy Adams, Jr., suggested that Heywood might have been influenced by Lucian’s Icaro-Menippus when representing Jupiter on earth, notably the passage: “...close to every one was placed a golden chair. Jupiter sat down in the first he came to, and lifting up the lid, listened to the prayers, which, as you may suppose, were of various kinds...One sailor asked for a north-wind, another for a south; the husbandmen prayed for rain, and the fuller for sun-shine...One petition, indeed, puzzled him a little; two men asking favors of him, directly contrary to each other, at the same time, and promising the same sacrifice; he was at a loss which to oblige.” Significance The date of the play suggests a connection with the King’s Great Matter, and Jupiter has been seen as analogous to Henry VIII. As the Great Matter was linked to the English Reformation which would ultimately create Henry as the Supreme Head of the Church of England and make him responsible for the temporal and spiritual welfare of his subjects, the play has been interpreted as a rehearsal of some of the new responsibilities Henry would undertake. While it is represented as prudent for a ruler to listen to the counsel and needs of his subjects, the play also depicts Jupiter as having the final word, and therefore looks forward to an absolutist monarchy. Greg Walker has argued that, in the face of the religious changes about to affect the country, the Catholic John Heywood is making a case for religious tolerance and moderation in the future. Noting similarities between Heywood’s Jupiter and the tyrants of the medieval mystery plays, Candace Lines sees in the god of The Play of the Weather a far more satirical representation of kingship than other critics of the play. In an argument which might proscribe courtly performance, she writes, “Even the play’s seemingly innocent meteorological plot contains associations with the cycle drama tyrants. In the York cycle and the fragmentary Coventry cycle, Herod claims to control the weather…Jupiter’s resemblance to the York Herod is even stronger, because this Herod mingles his claim of weather-controlling prowess with an assertion of his authority over classical gods.” References External links * Staging the Henrician Court * John Heywood at TheatreHistory.com * The Play of the Weather audio version at Beyond Shakespeare Category:1533 plays Category:Medieval drama ","title":"The Play of the Weather"},{"id":"24065104","text":"Shinan ( \\"South City\\") is an urban district of Qingdao, Shandong. It has an area of and had approximately 527,000 inhabitants as of 2007. Shinan is located in coastal hilled terrain, and has a temperate monsoon climate. Common features include moderate temperatures, moist air, abundant rainfall, and four distinct seasons. It is notable for its early 20th-century German architecture, unusual in Chinese cities. In the mid-19th century the European powers forcibly opened China to foreign trade. Germany acquired the Kiautschou Bay concession from China in 1898, and substantially developed a fishing village they spelled \\"Tsingtao\\" (). The area built by the Germans falls into the part of Qingdao known today as Shinan District. Shinan is a center for political, business and finance activities, and is home to investment from an increasing number of Fortune 500 companies. To facilitate urban planning, it is divided into a number of areas, including a port and logistics area, tourism area, software/IT area, high-end retail area and financial area. Shinan is home to the Qingdao International Sailing Centre, a world-class sailing marina constructed for the 2008 Summer Olympics. It hosted the Olympic and Paralympic Sailing competitions. It has also hosted a leg of the Clipper Round the World Yacht Race each year since 2005. History Sketch map of the area that later became Shinan District, c. 1906 After China's defeat in the First Opium War, the country was forcibly opened to foreign trade by a number of treaties collectively referred to as the Unequal Treaties. Following the Treaty of Nanjing (1842), the British established the first treaty ports. Following China's concession to the British Empire, other foreign powers including France, the United States, Portugal, Germany, Japan, and Russia won concessions as well. Foreigners, who were centered in foreign sections of the cities, enjoyed legal extraterritoriality as stipulated in the Unequal Treaties. Foreign clubs, racecourses, and churches were established in major treaty ports. Some of these port areas were directly leased by foreign powers, such as the concessions in China, effectively removing them from the control of local governments. German presence in Qingdao Former site of the headquarters of the German Administration In the early 1890s, the German Empire had been considering occupying Jiaozhou Bay (\\"Jiaozhou\\" was formerly romanized as Kiaochow, Kiauchau or Kiao-Chau in English and Kiautschou in German) for building its first naval base in East Asia in order to expand into the interior of Shandong. In 1891 the Qing government decided to make Qingdao (commonly spelled \\"Tsingtao\\" until well into the 20th century) defensible against naval attack and began to improve the existing fortifications of the town. German naval officials observed and reported on this Chinese activity during a formal survey of Jiaozhou Bay in May 1897. In November 1897, the German Navy seized Jiaozhou Bay under the pretext of ensuring that reparations were paid for the murder of two German Catholic missionaries in the province. In the spring of 1898, the German government signed a treaty that allowed the Germans to lease an area of for 99 years, to construct a railway to Jinan, the capital of Shandong province, and to exploit coalfields along the railroad. The Kiautschou Bay concession, as it became known, existed from 1898 to 1914. With an area of , it was located in the imperial province of Shandong (alternatively romanized as Shantung or Shan-tung) on the southern coast of the Shandong Peninsula in northern China. Qingdao was its administrative center. According to Dr. Wilhelm Matzat, of the University of Bonn, \\"The so- called Marktstrasse (Market street) was nothing more than the old main street of the Chinese village of Tsingtao, and the buildings lining it were the former homes of fishermen and farmers. Having sold their property, they resettled their homes and fields in the villages further east.\\" On gaining control of the area, the Germans outfitted the impoverished fishing village of Tsingtao with wide streets, solid housing areas, government buildings, electrification throughout, a sewer system and a safe drinking water supply. The buildings were built in a European style. The area had the highest density of schools and per capita student enrollment in all of China; primary, secondary and vocational schools were funded by the Imperial German treasury and Protestant and Roman Catholic missions. This area is what later became Shinan District. During World War I the territory was conquered by a joint Anglo-Japanese task force during the 1914 Siege of Tsingtao and the victorious Allies of World War I awarded the continuation of the lease to the Empire of Japan over the objections of the Republic of China. The territory reverted to Chinese control in 1922. World War II and subsequent civil war The Japanese reoccupied Qingdao in January 1938 after the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War. On August 15, 1945, Japan surrendered to Allied forces, officially ending World War II, and forces of the Kuomintang entered the city in September, restoring the government of the Republic of China. During the Chinese Civil War, Qingdao served briefly as a port for the United States Navy. On June 2, 1949, the Communist-led Red Army entered Qingdao and both the city and Shandong Province have since been under Chinese government control. Under Mao Soon after the Communists assumed control, a combination of assertive nationalism and socialist ideology led to the eradication of the Western presence in China, including Western culture and products. \\"The denunciation of anything Western as 'capitalist,' 'bourgeois' and representative of the 'imperialist world' reached a peak during the ideological extremism of the Korean War (1950–1953) when the final vestiges of the Western economic and cultural presence were eradicated.\\" This took the form of expulsion of foreigners and destruction or defacement of foreign property. An example of this in Shinan District was St. Michael's Cathedral, which was badly damaged during the Cultural Revolution which lasted from 1966 to 1971. During this time St. Michael's Cathedral was defaced by the Red Guards. The crosses topping the twin steeples were removed, with two Red Guards falling to their deaths during the removal. After Mao The Chinese government subsequently repudiated the Cultural Revolution. A major document presented at the September 1979 Fourth Plenum of the Eleventh National Party Congress Central Committee, gave a \\"preliminary assessment\\" of the entire 30-year period of Communist rule. At the plenum, party Vice Chairman Ye Jianying declared the Cultural Revolution \\"an appalling catastrophe\\" and \\"the most severe setback to [the] socialist cause since [1949].\\" The Chinese government's condemnation of the Cultural Revolution culminated in the Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China, adopted by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. This stated that \\"Comrade Mao Zedong was a great Marxist and a great proletarian revolutionary, strategist and theorist. It is true that he made gross mistakes during the \\"cultural revolution\\", but, if we judge his activities as a whole, his contributions to the Chinese revolution far outweigh his mistakes. His merits are primary and his errors secondary.\\" Since the 1984 inauguration of China's open-door policy to foreign trade and investment, Qingdao has developed quickly as a modern port city. In 1986, Qingdao became one of five cities specifically designated in the state plan and granted with provincial level authority over economic administration. In 1994, Qingdao was elevated to one of China's 15 sub-provincial cities. Terrain, climate and demographics Shinan has an area of 30.01 km2 and around 527,000 inhabitants as of 2007.

History  The need for a lighthouse between Passage Island and Isle Royale was recognized as early as the 1860s, as lake traffic increased dramatically due to the upsurge in mining in the Upper Peninsula. However, it took until 1875 before Congress authorized funds for the construction of a lighthouse. However, because of Congress's desire to bring political pressure to bear on the Canadian government to force them to build a lighthouse in Lake Erie, the appropriated $18,000 for Pasage Light was not released until 1880. Construction began in 1881, and the light was completed the following year. A fog signal was added in 1884, and in 1894 a new flashing white lens manufactured by Barbier, Benard & Turenne of Paris was installed. In 1978, the station was automated, and in 1989 a acrylic lens was installed, replacing the Fresnel.

Plot Marty Malone is a member of a street gang called the \\"Death Avenue Cowboys\\", consisting of poor children in Hell's Kitchen, New York. As the gang try to steal fruit from a fruit warehouse, Marty starts a fire to distract the watchmen, unfortunately it turns into a real blaze and he is caught by the police. Even though the police give him a rough time in questioning, he refuses to say the names of any other gang members, thus saving his friends and accomplices from capture. Marty is sent to a reformatory for delinquents. Many years go by after that, and now Marty is the proud owner of the Cigarette Club, which is a cabaret and casino in Manhattan. In tending to his business, he sends men to strong-arm a customer reluctant to pay a gambling debt. The goons, Sam and Frank Diamond, beat the customer up, accidentally killing him. They try to make his death look as if a neon sign fell on him. The police emergency squad investigating the death includes brothers Joe and Mike O'Mara, who graduated from Marty's childhood gang. Authorities dismiss the death as an accident, but Joe, eager to become a police detective, believes it was murder when he finds evidence that the support that gave way allowing the sign to fall was clearly cut rather than breaking with age. That evening there is a reunion dinner at Marty's Cigarette Club, with the boyhood friends attending, including the O'Mara's. Jerry Donovan is now a priest, and Helen McCoy has become a performer at the club. Helen has spurned Marty's many proposals because she loves Mike O'Mara. Mike dances with Helen all evening. Brother Joe, striking out with the ladies, exits the dinner, returns to the scene of the murder, impatient to solve the crime he believes was committed. Diamond and Sam, having realized he may expose them, corner him and push him off the roof to his death. Later that evening, Marty arrives on the scene and is upset his incompetent thugs have perpetrated the murders. The homicide bureau dismisses Joe's case as an accident, but Mike is unconvinced, and believes Joe's death is connected to the previous one. He is also guilt stricken he didn't accompany his brother to investigate his hunch on the incident that brought his death. Diamond and Sam rob a jewelry store, set off a bomb next to Marty's club, and send notes to Mike incriminating Marty. Mike takes the bait, loses control and tries to kill Marty, but Jerry stops him, and Mike is arrested. Marty refuses to press charges, and also confesses his involvement to Jerry. He explains to Jerry that he never intended any deaths to occur. Diamond and Sam plan to rob the Polar Gardensa popular ice skating ring, and force Marty to participate through kidnapping Helen who wisely informs Jerry of where she is going. Diamond and Sam alert Mike of the plan who they hope will kill Marty. Mike again goes berserk, but Jerry again prevents Mike from killing Marty. In a shootout with the criminals, Marty dies taking a bullet intended for Mike. His death brings Mike and Helen together, and as Marty had requested, there is a playground built at Jerry's boys club in Marty's name.

Plot For the Cause is set in the late 26th century on a distant planet that has two human colonies. These colonies were founded as a refuge from the wars of Earth, but the vision died when the colonies began fighting a hundred- year war, reducing their once mighty cities to rubble. The stone walled city of Brecca is the northern neighbor of the nation of Obsidian, a culture of black glass cities and unfathomable technology. The war drags on with the vestiges of once mighty technologies, and the great armies are now but orphaned teenagers, fighting and dying for a cause they never knew. Unless the war ends, yet another entire generation of children on both sides will perish in battle, so Brecca’s greatest military leader, General Murren (Dean Cain), decides to use the last of Brecca’s ancient weapons to end the war. It is called Warhammer, a hundred-year-old nuclear weapon built to cripple Obsidian’s technology. Murren leads a small team to deliver the weapon to Obsidian, taking with him his most loyal soldier, Sutherland (Justin Whalin) and Abel (Jodi Wise), a beautiful woman who is the master of a dying art of computer warfare. Feared by even her own people, Abel uses her ancient skills to channel energy into lethal forms. Murren also selects Evans (Thomas Ian Griffith), a celebrated warrior with a mysterious past, who has learned that peace is greater than victory. The small team intends to penetrate the defenses of an enemy city that couldn't be reached by Murren's father and six million men, but as the team battles its way toward Obsidian, they also must contend with their own Breccan people, torn apart by a century of conflict. Cast *Dean Cain as General Murren *Justin Whalin as Sutherland *Jodi Wise as Abel *Thomas Ian Griffith as Evans Production The film was shot in Bulgaria on a small budget of $2.5 million. Director David Douglas and his brother Tim were able to make the film with these limited resources by using new generation PC technology that reduced the cost of digital filmmaking. Inspired by Star Wars, the brothers became interested in videos and films, and formed a computer graphics company that did commercial work for the Fresno TV station. Later in Los Angeles, they became successful as CG artists. David got carpal tunnel syndrome and had to make a career change, so he decided to make \\"For the Cause.\\" They soon signed with Miramax, but had trouble getting the project greenlighted. They eventually did a much smaller deal with Nu Image/Millennium, a low-budget film company. David feels that Bulgaria, with its pollution and bleak cities, was a perfect setting for the film, noting: \\"If you want to go to a place that looks like a futuristic world that failed, Bulgaria is it.\\" Their only other feature film, Submarines (2003), was released straight to video. Reception Clark Douglas of DVD Verdict called the film \\"a genuinely wretched affair\\" and \\"agonizingly long\\".

He was the governing director and founder of Hemingway & Robertson, Hemingway Robertson Institute, and Australasian Assets and Goodwill, positions he held until his death. He was also the last president of the Stock Exchange of Melbourne, and the first chairman of the Melbourne branch of the Liberal Party of Australia. Life Robertson was born in Scotland, and attended King's College in Auckland, New Zealand. where his father, the Scotsman, Charles Alexander Robertson had been Headmaster. After studying accountancy he went into business with Nello Porter and W. H Hemingway forming an accounting firm, publishing house and correspondence school specialising in accountancy and business courses. They later split the business, and following an expansion to Australia he set up permanently in Melbourne in 1913. Robertson built the Melbourne headquarters at Bank House in Bank Place, Collins Street and opened offices throughout Australia and later operations in North America and the United Kingdom. In Britain he was made Vice President of the Royal Institute of Commerce from 1929 to 1930, a Fellow of the Society of Incorporated Accountants and Auditors and a Fellow of the Royal Society of the Arts. Following his return to Australia, Robertson was embroiled in a landmark High Court tax case, which contested his income in Britain. Ironically, it was his close friend Justice Owen Dixon who fined Robertson, and arranged for him to help amend the loophole in the Commonwealth tax laws. Afterwards it is rumored Robertson was satirically made to play left-handed (his non-preferred) against Dixon in a round of golf, which being ambidextrous he still won. A keen speculator and prudent investor, Robertson had far reaching pecuniary interests and directorial roles in mining, wheat and wool, as well as educational links through his Hemingway Robertson Institute with the University of Melbourne. He was made president of the Stock Exchange of Melbourne from 1934 to 1936, managing the formation of the Australian Associated Stock Exchanges (AASE) which opened in 1937. In his later years and up until his death, Robertson was a Victorian representative, and first chairman of the Melbourne branch, of the Liberal Party of Australia, and a confidant of Robert Menzies. Robertson was an important figure in the 1949 Australian federal election, and defeat of Ben Chifley, where Menzies and the newly formed Liberal Party won power in a massive landslide, scoring a 48-seat swing—still the largest defeat of a sitting government at the federal level in Australia. An avid adventurer and sportsman, Robertson was known to host raucous hunting and fishing parties and bush dances at his beloved Mallacoota estate, Mirrabooka. He was also closely involved with the Royal Melbourne Golf Club, Royal Society of the Arts and Melbourne Savage Club, the later of which he was club president. Robertson was married twice, first to Rosetta Maude Clark in 1908, and, in 1913, to Ida Caron Robertson. He died at the age of 69 in Melbourne and was survived by his second wife and four children.

In 1938, he engaged in an act of public devotion to an important symbol of his native country, the Monument to the Lion of Judah, at the time kept in Rome. When interrupted, he violently protested against Italian colonialism while brandishing a scimitar, which led to his arrest and internment in a psychiatric hospital for seven years, until his death. However, contemporary Italian historians doubt the claim that he was mentally unstable. Zerai's protest, lionized after the end of the Second World War, is considered by Eritrean and Ethiopian historiography as part of the movement against Italian occupation. To this day, Zerai is considered a legend and a folk hero of anticolonialism and antifascism both in Eritrea and Ethiopia.  Biography   Early life and education  First Eritrean young Capuchin seminarists with their teachers in Segeneiti on November 6, 1934. During the seminar Zerai Deres (fourth from left on the top, with number 3) took the name of Francesco da Adiyeheys Zerai Deres was born in the kebele of Adihiyis, in the province of Serae, in Italian Eritrea in 1914 (or 1908, according to the Ethiopian calendar). At the age of two, his father died and the family moved to Hazega, the village of his mother's origin. Zerai was a member of the Tigrinya ethnic group. He converted to Catholicism and attended Italian colonial schools, including the seminary of the Capuchin friars in Segeneiti. For this reason, he spoke the Italian language fluently. Abandoning his studies in the seminary, Zerai became an interpreter in Rama, an Ethiopian town bordering present-day Eritrea. On October 6, 1936, Zerai Deres sent a letter to the editor of the Italian newspaper Corriere Eritreo who had written an editorial in which he had asked for the abolition of any form of promiscuity with the \\"natives\\". Signing himself Un indigeno (Italian for \\"A native\\"), Zerai wrote: > The natives, whose presence causes so much disgust to you, often take pride > in the fact that they are Italian subjects. In Libya, Somalia and in the > recent war against their homeland, in foreign struggles, they have shielded > you with their bodies, and sometimes paid with their lives. I can assure you > that it is no exaggeration to say that the natives provided you the means > with which you could overcome. The misinterpretation of so many merits and > acts of heroism carried out for Italy can only be indicative of an > essentially alien and imperial government. Before departing to Italy, Zerai married in April 1937.  Arrival in Rome  Monument to the Lion of Judah at the Rome memorial to the fallen of the Battle of Dogali, before its repatriation On 19 February 1937, two Eritreans made a failed assassination attempt on Rodolfo Graziani, the Viceroy of Italian East Africa and appointed Governor-General of Shewa during the Italian occupation of Ethiopia. In return, under carte blanche permission from the Federal Secretary , many Italian civilians, members of the military, and the paramilitary forces known as the Blackshirts conducted a three-day bloody reprisal in Addis Ababa. Known in Ethiopia as the Yekatit 12 massacre, it resulted in the killing of thousands of people and arrests of many Amhara aristocratic noblemen, about 400 of whom were subsequently deported to Rome, Longobucco, Mercogliano, Ponza, Tivoli, and Asinara, Italy. In order to manage the deportation, the Italian Ministry of the Colonies hired many people, including Zerai Deres as a translator for Ethiopian nobles deported to Italy. At the age of 23, Zerai arrived in Rome in the summer of 1937 shortly after the arrival of the first Ethiopian deportees. During his stay in the Italian capital, Zerai closely followed the events of the colonial war with a growing sense of anger and helplessness in the face of news coming from Ethiopia, and translated for the Abyssinian Ras the news reported by the Italian press.  Lion of Judah incident  On June 15, 1938, shortly before his planned return to his homeland, Zerai went to Princess of Piedmont Boulevard (now Luigi Einaudi Boulevard) during lunchtime and knelt at the foot of the Monument to the Lion of Judah, a symbol of the Ethiopian monarchy. The sculpture had been brought to Rome as spoils of war by the Italian fascist regime in 1935, placed under the monument to the fallen of Battle of Dogali, and inaugurated on May 8, 1937, at the eve of celebrations for the first anniversary of the Italian Empire proclamation. As a small crowd gathered around Zerai, an Italian military officer tried to interrupt his devotions. Zerai pulled out a scimitar, struck the officer, and shouted imprecations against Italy and the Duce, while praising the Negus (Ethiopian monarch). During the confrontation, Zerai injured Italian Railways private Vincenzo Veglia, State employee Ferdinando Peraldi, and Infantry Chief Marshal Mario Izzo, who reported very slightArticle 583 of the Italian Criminal Code defines as \\"very slight\\" (lievissime) personal injuries that healed within 20 days wounds that healed within 12 days. According to other reports, some passersby, including a butcher's boy who hurled his bicycle at the Eritrean,) were also injured. Finally, two soldiers ended the attack with gunfire, shooting Zerai four times. Zerai was wounded in the thigh. Reactions to the incident For political reasons, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini was planning to repatriate the Abyssinian aristocrats not welcome in Rome to Ethiopia. (By July 1939 only one out of ninety of the detainees remained in Rome). That plan suddenly accelerated when on June 15, 1938, Mussolini was informed that Zerai, who worked as an interpreter for the Ras confined in Rome, had shouted imprecations against Italy and praised Haile Selassie in front of the monument to the fallen of Dogali. Informed that some people had been severely wounded in attempting to silence Zerai, Mussolini become furious and ordered the total repatriation of all Ethiopian noblemen. However, the repatriation effort was slowed by the need to evaluate each case individually, as some Ethiopian dignitaries (including Ras Seyoum Mengesha, Ras Kebede Mengesha, Ras Mulugeta Yeggazu, and Degiac Asrate Mulughietà) were suspected of inspiring Zerai's protest, and it was preferable to exile them in Libya or the Dodecanese. Internment and death The episode was considered by the Italian authorities as an action of mental illness. Zerai was arrested, hospitalized at the Umberto I Policlynic, and then taken to Barcellona Pozzo di Gotto (province of Messina, Sicily) to the criminal asylum \\"Vittorio Madia\\". During his internment, Zerai repeatedly tried to prove his mental sanity, but he failed to convince the Italian doctors. He also wrote letters to his family: on December 3, 1938, Zerai stated he was in good health and asked his brother Tesfazien Deres to reject the honorary title that Tesfazien had received from the Italian government. He wrote, \\"I'm fine. Always have been, and still am, in full possession of my mental faculties. I am in the Asylum only on account of government policy.\\" According to the Italian historian Alessandro Triulzi, \\"The few letters he left behind bear witness to his lucidity.\\" After seven years at Barcellona Pozzo di Gotto asylum, Zerai died at the age of 31, on July 6, 1945. Repatriation of remains Tesfazion Deres wrote this letter to Emperor Selassie to get an airplane to bring home ZeraiZerai's brother Tesfazien, founder of the Eritrea Independent Party, thinking that Zerai was still alive in an Italian prison in Italy, wrote a personal letter to the Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie asking to provide an airplane to Italy in order to bring his brother home. Tesfazien also approached the Minister of Foreign Affairs Ambaye Wolde Mariam to present the case to the Imperial Palace, initially without success. Finally, Tesfazien reached Zerai in Sicily in July 1939, but he could do nothing to get his brother free from the asylum. After Zerai's death in 1945, Tesfazien was able after a long struggle to repatriate his brother's remains to Eritrea. Zerai was buried in St. Mary's Church in Hazega, in front of which stands a monument depicting the patriot together with two lions. Lionization The story of Zerai Deres was mythicized in the postwar era, turning him into a national folk hero At the end of World War II, the story of Zerai Deres was rewritten, dramatized, and sung in Ethiopia to celebrate his anti-colonial resistance, especially by the pan-Ethiopian who opposed the separation of Eritrea from Ethiopia. Zerai also became a hero of the antifascism movement., cited in Due to the prevalence of oral tradition, numerous and even contradictory details went to enhance the character, until he became a national folk hero in both Ethiopia and Eritrea, a status he retains to this day. Among the various reconstructions, there is one that sets the story during a celebratory event of the second anniversary of the announcement of the Italian empire (although the Italian empire's proclamation that made Ethiopia part of Italian East Africa was annually celebrated a month earlier, on May 9). The young Eritrean would have been chosen to take part in the military parade and carry a ceremonial sword that would have greeted the Italian king Vittorio Emanuele III, Adolf Hitler, and Benito Mussolini (although, as evidenced by the historical sources, none of the three were in Rome in those days, and in each case there was not any parade on June 15 in the capital city). Coming to the Piazza dei CinquecentoIn reality, since 1925 the obelisk of the fallen Dogali had been moved from piazza dei Cinquecento (in front of the Roma Termini railway station) to the nearby viale Principessa di Piemonte (now viale Luigi Einaudi) and recognizing the golden sculpture of the Lion of Judah to which his ancestors swore allegiance,In reality, that Lion of Judah sculpture was a recent bronze made in 1930 by French sculptor Georges Gardet (1863–1939) Zerai would have been struck by a sudden amok or impetus of anti-colonial patriotism, deciding to stop at the steps, kneel, and pray towards the statue-symbol; or, with a sudden feeling of anger, he would hit with a sword the first Italian to cross his path. According to other sources, Zerai killed at least five people, as well as wounded others, screaming words like \\"The Lion of Judah is avenged!\\" before being arrested or killed by the fascists on the spot in a hail of gunfire. In popular culture In the 1950s various historical theatrical plays were written in Ethiopia about the Italian invasion. Among these works, Ateneh Alemu wrote a play about Zerai Deres in 1956–1957. In the 1970s, the story of the Eritrean patriot was rewritten by Ethiopian comedian Yilma Manaye in his work Zeraye Derese. This character was interpreted by Wegayehu Nigatu (1944–1990), a popular actor at the Ethiopian National Theater in Addis Ababa at the time. When the play was staged in Eritrea at Asmara's Opera, Wegayehu Nigatu's interpretation of Zerai was successfully received by the audience and his performance was so convincing that Tesfazien Deres wanted to host the actor for two weeks in order to have the opportunity to converse with him as with his dead brother. Ethiopian poet laureate Tsegaye Gabre-Medhin wrote an historical play about Zerai in the 1980s. In visual arts, the patriot was the subject of sculptures, including that of Tadesse Mamecha made in 1971. The Zerai Deres Band has been a popular Eritrean jazz and folk music band since the 1970s. Remembrance Monument to the Lion of Judah, back in Addis Ababa since the 1960s The Zerai Deres corvette of the Ethiopian Navy was transferred to Italy in 1959, then renamed Vedetta (F 597)Zerai Deres Square in Asmara, Eritrea In 1966, when the sculpture of the Lion of Judah was returned to Ethiopia, Emperor Haile Selassie recalled Zerai's patriotic gesture during the re-appointment ceremony held in Addis Ababa. After the 1974 Ethiopian Revolution, the Derg regime planned to remove the statue as a monarchic symbol. However, senior members of the war veterans association lobbied for the statue to remain as a symbol of Zerai Deres' sacrifice on behalf of antifascism. The Derg agreed to this request to save the statue, which stands in the Addis Ababa railway station square today. The Ethiopian Navy's first military ship, a former U.S. Navy PC-1604-class submarine chaser donated by the United States Army in 1956, was christened Zerai Deres. cited in Allafrica.com A Soviet-made Petya-class frigate was also dedicated to the Eritrean patriot;it was launched in 1968 and sank in February 1991 near the island of Nocra. The square where the Asmara's central post office and National Bank of Eritrea (former Palace of National Bank of Italy) are located was named Piazza Roma (Rome Square), but after independence it was dedicated to Zerai's memory. A number of roads, schools, hotels, and restaurants are also named after Zerai. In 2016, on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Addis Ababa from Italian domination, a group of six stamps depicting national heroes, including Zerai, was issued by the Ethiopian Postal Service.

It is a fairly simplistic model, employing several simplifying assumptions, most notably the assumption that every fertilisation event may be classed as either self-fertilisation, or outcrossing with a completely random mate. Thus the only model parameter to be estimated is the probability of self-fertilisation. The mixed mating model originated in the 1910s, with plant breeders who were seeking evidence of outcrossing contamination of self-pollinating crops, but a formal description of the model and its parameter estimation was not published until 1951. The model is still in common use today, though a number of more complex models are also now in use. For example, a weakness of the model lies in its assumption that inbreeding occurs only as a result of self- fertilisation; in reality, inbreeding may also occur through outcrossing between closely related individuals. The effective selfing model relaxes this assumption by seeking also to estimate the degree of shared ancestry of outcrossing mates.

Training in the various crafts was provided by volunteers, and the costs were initially borne by Lady Brabazon herself. The scheme was slow to take off, until workhouses discovered that the goods being produced could be sold, and thus the project could be self-financing. On a visit to the workhouse in Great Yarmouth in 1903 Queen Alexandra paid £5 – equivalent to about £455 as of 2012 – for a bedspread made by two elderly inmates, \\"to encourage the old people in their work\\". Christchurch Poor Law Union became involved in the Brabazon scheme to provide occupation for old men, who produced goods such as baskets, rugs, wickerwork and woollen clothing. Proceeds from the sale of these products was used to cover the cost of materials or to provide extras for the wards, such as a gramophone. The men were usually paid for their labour with extra tobacco. By 1900 there were 177 Poor Law Unions taking part in the scheme. The projects were usually managed locally by members of a ladies committee for the union operating the workhouse.

The track appeared on Dylan's album Nashville Skyline in 1969, and was released as its first single later that year, where it reached number 85 on the Billboard Hot 100, and number 30 on the UK Singles Chart. It is considered to be one of the best and most popular songs on the album. Music and lyrics \\"I Threw It All Away\\" was one of the first songs written for Nashville Skyline and one of only two new songs that were definitely written prior to the recording sessions (\\"Lay Lady Lay\\" being the other). Dylan played the song for George Harrison and his wife Pattie in November 1968, and Harrison was apparently impressed enough with the song to learn it himself. It was the second song recorded for Nashville Skyline, after \\"To Be Alone with You\\", on February 13, 1969. Dylan is singing about a love that he has lost by being cruel and angry. There has been some speculation on whom Dylan is referring to in the song. Many have speculated that it could be about a number of women including Suze Rotolo, Joan Baez, and Edie Sedgwick. Unlike many songs Dylan wrote about failed relationships, such as \\"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right\\", \\"It Ain't Me, Babe\\" and \\"One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)\\", Dylan takes responsibility for the failure in this song. The song has also been interpreted as a portrait of Dylan's muse. Personnel *Bob Dylan - guitar, vocals *Kenneth A. Buttrey - drums *Charlie Daniels - bass guitar *Bob Wilson - organ Live performances Dylan performed \\"I Threw It All Away\\" live for the first time on The Johnny Cash Show, broadcast on June 7, 1969. It was the second song in Dylan's set with The Band at the Isle of Wight Festival on August 31, 1969 and is included on Isle of Wight Live, part of the 4-CD deluxe edition of The Bootleg Series Vol. 10: Another Self Portrait (1969–1971), released in 2013. (Another song from Nashville Skyline, \\"Lay Lady Lay\\", was also in Dylan's Isle of Wight set.) Dylan performed \\"I Threw It All Away\\" in the spring of 1976 during the Rolling Thunder Revue. The May 16, 1976 performance would later be included on the live album Hard Rain. The Rolling Thunder rendition of the song was a raging rock song with strident lyrics, in contrast to the original version. Dylan also played the song on his 1978 tour, but did not play it again live until 1998 during his Never Ending Tour. By 2002, still on the Never Ending Tour, Dylan was playing an acoustic version of the song. Critical acclaim In a 2005 poll reported in Mojo, \\"I Threw It All Away\\" was listed as the #55 all time Bob Dylan song. In 2002, Uncut listed \\"I Threw It All Away\\" as the #34 all time Bob Dylan song.

Map of North Zealand Coast near Gilleleje North Zealand, also North Sealand, () refers to the northern part of the Danish island of Zealand which is not clearly defined but generally covers the area north of Copenhagen. The Danish tourist authorities have recently introduced the term Danish Riviera to cover the area in view of its increasing importance for tourism. The area not only has three magnificent royal castles but offers resorts with sandy beaches, as well as lakes and unspoiled forests. In addition to Kronborg Castle, three of the North Zealand forest areas used for royal par force hunting are included in the UNESCO World Heritage List. Geographical coverage The region is generally understood to cover the area north of Copenhagen between the Isefjord to the west and the Øresund to the east. Municipalities It comprises (at least) the municipalities of Allerød, Egedal, Fredensborg, Frederikssund, Furesø, Gribskov, Halsnæs, Helsingør, Hillerød, Hørsholm, Lyngby-Taarbæk and Rudersdal. Major towns and cities The largest urban centres in the region are Helsingør (population 61,519), Hørsholm (46,229), Hillerød (31,181), Birkerød (20,041), Farum (18,335), Frederikssund (15,725) and Frederiksværk (12,029). The historic city of Roskilde (48,721) in the southwest is often included in North Zealand, especially in guide books. Frederikssund, known for its Viking Games held each summer, is also adjacent to the Hornsherred peninsula with opportunities for walking, cycling and sailing. Jægerspris Castle with a history dating back to the 13th century is now a historic house museum. Frederiksværk owes its existence to its industrial past including its cannon factory established in 1761 by Johan Frederik Classen in accordance with the wishes of King Frederik V. Gjethuset, part of the old factory, has now been converted into a cultural centre. Another attraction is the open-air Gunpowder Museum (Krudtværksmuseet). The Gothic, brick-built Roskilde Cathedral is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, attracting over 100,000 visitors a year. Roskilde has a history dating back to the Vikings as can be seen in its Viking Ship Museum. The city also attracts thousands to the four-day Roskilde Music Festival held annually at the beginning of July.

The castle known as Krogen was rebuilt as Kronborg in 1577. From the Danish Reformation in 1536, the monarchy confiscated the extensive estates in North Zealand which had belonged to the monasteries gaining ownership of most of the region until the beginning of the 18th century. They did not use the land for farming, however, but mainly for hunting and for grazing their horses. They also established enclosed parks for hunting deer. Since the 16th century, royal residences and palaces have been built in the region. In the 18th century, Frederiksværk on the west coast and Hellebæk just west of Helsingør, became important industrial centres thanks to the early manufacture of armaments. From the turn of the 20th century, the north and east coasts have developed as bathing and holiday resorts for the inhabitants of Copenhagen. The area to the north of the capital has become popular as a well-to-do residential and recreational area for those working in the city. Attractions and landmarks Royal castles One of the major attractions in the area is the UNESCO-listed Kronborg Castle in Helsingør to the north-east. It is not only the site of William Shakespeare's play Hamlet but is one of the most important Renaissance castles in northern Europe. The lively city of Helsingør also has a cathedral church built in the 16th century. Its redeveloped harbour area known as Kulturhavn Kronborg now houses the Danish Maritime Museum while Kulturværftet is a large venue for concerts and exhibitions. The second largest city Hillerød, in the centre of the region, is famous for Frederiksborg Palace built in the Renaissance style for Christian IV in the early 17th century. The city is not only a tourist attraction but a thriving industrial centre thanks to a number of recently established firms in the biotechnology sector. Fredensborg Palace, another royal castle, was built by Frederick IV in 1722 in the Baroque style and was extended later in the 18th century. As the palace is one of the royal family's official residences, it is not open to the public. The palace gardens may however be visited. File:Kronborg from the Ferry.jpg|Kronborg, Helsingør (UNESCO-listed) File:Frederiksborg-2.jpg|Frederiksborg, Hillerød File:Fredensborg Palace from the garden.jpg|Fredensborg Palace Museums and heritage sites The Louisiana Museum of Modern Art in Humlebæk to the south of Helsingør is Denmark's most popular art museum. Created in 1958, it has a large permanent collection of paintings and sculptures from the mid-20th century to the present. Rungstedlund, also known at the Karen Blixen Museum, is a country house on the east coast which has been preserved to present the house in which the renowned Danish writer Karen Blixen, author of Out of Africa, lived until her death in 1962. It opened as a museum in 1991. The Danish Museum of Science and Technology (Danmarks Tekniske Museum) in Helsingør has a wide variety of attractions for both adults and children including steam engines, veteran cars and electricity. The J.F. Willumsens Museum in Frederikssund to the southwest is an art museum dedicated to the works of the Symbolist artist Jens Ferdinand Willumsen (1863-1958) which was opened in 1957. The remaining buildings of 12th-century Esrum Abbey near Hillerød were listed as a heritage site in 1992. After restoration, one of the buildings was opened as a museum in 1997 with a permanent collection as well as facilities for temporary exhibitions and events such as concerts and presentations. The Rudolph Tegner Museum in Dronningmølle on the north coast presents the works of the Symbolist sculptor Rudolph Tegner (1873-1950) in an unusual concrete, bunker-like building with an octagonal gallery 11 metres in height. The surrounding park displays 14 statues created by Tegner. The Danish Museum of Hunting and Forestry in Hørsholm hosted an exhibition about the UNESCO-listed Par force hunting landscape in North Zealand heritage site. A special exhibition was devoted to the listing in October 2015. However, after the Danish Museum of Hunting and Forestry closed on January 1, 2017 the management of the heritage site moved to Museum North Zealand.

One of the most popular is Hornbæk, 12 km northwest of Helsingør, with its large sandy beaches, marina, cafés and restaurants, and a large area devoted to summer houses. Helsingør and Hornbæk in particular have a number of notable hotels including the 158-room Hotel & Casino Marienlyst and 28-room townhouse Hotel Skandia in Helsingør, and the Havreholm Slot and Sauntehus Slotshotel palacial hotels in the municipality of Hornbæk, the latter of which was built as a home by a wealthy corn merchant in 1914. Some 12 km to the northwest is Gilleleje, Zealand's most northernmost point, which has grown from a little village in 1900 to a popular coastal resort with sandy beaches, an active fishing harbour and several museums. The beach at Dronningmølle between Hornbæk and Gilleleje has also led to a large summer house district stretching 2 km inland. The Rudolph Tegner Museum displaying the artist's modern sculptural works is nearby. Rågeleje, 10 km southwest of Gilleleje, is a little fishing village with a history dating back to the 16th century. There are two sandy beaches, one on each side of the stream that runs through the village. Tisvilde, 9 km southwest of Rågeleje, is a small town which since the Second World War has grown into another popular location for summer houses, thanks to its sandy beach at Tisvildeleje to the south and its chalk cliffs to the north. The heathery hills of Tibirke Bakker to the south of Tisvilde offer excellent views of the surroundings from a height of . Further south, the last resort on the northwest coast is Liseleje, some 8 km north of Frederiksværk. It has also developed into a large summer house area. The recently completed natural playground Havtyren, with a variety of open-air challenges, is a popular attraction for children.

It passes through several former fishing villages with exclusive villas built by Copenhagen's more prosperous inhabitants. The development of the coastal villages into residential areas was mainly a result of the inauguration of the Kystbanen railway in 1897. Bellevue Beach on the northern outskirts of Copenhagen not only has a long sandy beach but is famous for the Bellavista housing estate, the Bellevue Theatre and bathing cabins designed by the Danish architect and designer Arne Jacobsen in the early 1930s. Other places of interest on the road to Helsingør include: Rungsted with exclusive villas, a marina and Karen Blixen's Rungstedlund; Nivå with a coastal park, small harbour and the Nivaagaard art gallery; Humlebæk, an old fishing village now famous for the modern art museum Louisiana; and, just south of Helsingør, Snekkersten with its harbour and hotels.

With an area of , Arresø, Denmark's largest lake, is open for fishing but not for bathing. Rowing boats, but not motor boats, are allowed. In addition to several signposted walks in the area, there are plans to open hiking and cycling paths all the way around the lake. Esrum Sø, covering , is rich in bird life and has a bird reservation with observation towers at the southern end. Amateur fishing is permitted in the lake's pollution-free waters. Boating in canoes, rowing boats, wind-surfers and yachts (up to 7 metres long and 2.5 metres wide) is allowed. Boats with electric motors are permitted but diesel motors require special authorization. Swimming and diving are also permitted. As for woodlands, Gribskov to the west of Esrum Sø is Denmark's oldest forest with the country's largest herd of deer. There are interesting signposted walks which include the forest's megalithic passage graves, long barrows and dolmens. By contrast, Tisvilde Hegn, close to the northwest coast, was planted in the 19th century with Scots pine to combat drifting sands which had invaded the area. It has now developed into an area noted for its flora and fauna, especially its birdlife. In 2015, UNESCO included \\"The par force hunting landscape in North Zealand\\" as a World Heritage Site. The site specifically includes the mathematically-designed road systems developed in the 1680s under Christian V of Denmark in Gribskov and Store Dyrehave to facilitate deer hunting with hounds as well as Jægersborg Dyrehave.

Esrum Sø.jpg|Esrum Sø File:Grib skov.jpg|Gribskov (UNESCO-listed) File:Storedyrehave1.jpg|Store Dyrehave (UNESCO-listed) Mølleåen One of the main attractions of the area is the Mølleå Valley along the river which runs from the west of Bastrup Sø near Lynge to the Øresund between Taarbæk and Skodsborg. There are several notable country houses overlooking the river and the lakes through which it passes as well as a series of historic water mills which contributed to Denmark's industrial development. As far back as the Viking period, the river was used for milling. From the Middle Ages, its water power was increased by means of dams between the lake of Furesø and the river mouth at the Øresund. In the 17th century, sizeable industrial enterprises were established along the river giving it the reputation of being the cradle of Danish industry. They included mills for the production of textiles, metals, paper and armaments. The factories operated until the 1950s after which they began to close, leaving buildings that were put to other uses such as the Brede Works, now an industrial museum, and the Strandmøllen paper mill. Transport Helsingør Station Motorways in North Zealand The whole of North Zealand can be easily accessed from Copenhagen and its international airport. The main town, Helsingør, is only away and even Hundested to the northwest is not more than from the capital. Railways The region's major rail connections are the Coast Line (Kystbanen) between Copenhagen and Helsingør and three radials of the S-train network. Part of the Oresundtrain network, Coast Line trains with frequencies of up to once every ten minutes serve Klampenborg, Skodsborg, Vedbæk, Rungsted Kyst, Kokkedal, Nivå, Humlebæk, Espergærde, Snekkersten and Helsingør. The Hillerød radial serve Lyngby, Holte, Birkerød, Allerød and Hillerød. The Farum radial between Copenhagen and Farum and Frederikssund radial between Copenhagen and Frederikssund serve the southwestern portion of North Zealand, includings Værløse and Ølstykke- Stenløse. The railway company Lokaltog operates local train services on the Hornbæk Line between Helsingør and Gilleleje, the Little North Line between Helsingør and Hillerød via Fredensborg, and the Gribskov Line which runs from Hillerød to both Tisvildeleje and Gilleleje. Lokaltog also operates services between Hillerød and Hundested in the northwest. There are also frequent S-trains on the North Line between Copenhagen and Hillerød with stops at Jægersborg, Lyngby, Sorgenfri, Virum, Holte, Birkerød, Høvelte and Allerød. Motorways The Helsingør Motorway, part of European route E47, connects Copenhagen to Helsingør with exits at Espergærde, Humlebæk, Nivå, Kokkedal, Hørsholm, Vedbæk, Gl. Holte, Nærum, Lundtofte and Lyngby. The Hillerød Motorway (Hillerødmotorvejen) covers the first of Route 16 between Copenhagen and Hillerød via Farum, continuing as an expressway. Ferries Frequent ferry services operate between Helsingør and Helsingborg in Sweden. The terminal in Helsingør is within walking distance of the railway station. The crossing takes about 20 minutes. A small vehicle ferry operates regularly between Hundested and Rørvig in Odsherred across the channel leading into the Isefjord Roskilde Fjord. In summer, another ferry operates between Sølager (now part of Hundested) and Kulhuse on the tip of the Hornsherred peninsula. Cycling As elsewhere in Denmark, cycling is popular in North Zealand with several signposted cycle routes. A number of cycle routes and downloadable maps are available from Hillerød Municipality. The North Coast Track (Nordkyststien) from Helsingør to Hundested is also a popular route. North Zealand in art Thanks to the encouragement of C.W. Eckersberg who taught at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, from the mid-19th century a considerable number of painters went to Hornbæk where they painted real life in the open air. From 1872, the village became popular with Viggo Johansen, Kristian Zahrtmann, P.S. Kroyer and Carl Locher who painted the harbour and the local fishermen. The painters returned to Hornbæk every summer apart from Locher who lived there from 1880 to 1889. Kronborg and Frederksborg have also been a favourite subject for artists since the 18th century.

Skovgaard: Frederiksborg (1841) Developing tourism Under the catchword Kongernes Nordsjælland (Royal North Zealand), the Danish tourist authorities have been trying to attract more tourists to the region. Tourist group Visit North Sealand reports a 6.4% increase in overnight stays in 2013 as compared to 2012. It followed a substantial increase in 2012 when North Zealand recorded the second highest increase in tourism after Copenhagen. This was partly a result of 21 million Danish kroner in funding from the European Union designed to provide more focused attention to the area's potential for tourism. One of the objectives has been to extend cooperation between the region's cities and municipalities which had previously competed with one another.

Its precise location was unknown until, in June 2012, Mr. Lorenzo Bovi had identified the precise location in \\"Torre Cuba\\", which was 3km west from Cassibile. It was an all-weather temporary field built by the United States Army Air Force XII Engineer Command using a graded earth compacted surface, with a prefabricated hessian (burlap) surfacing known as PHS. PHS was made of an asphalt-impregnated jute which was rolled out over the compacted surface over a square mesh track (SMT) grid of wire joined in 3-inch squares. Pierced Steel Planking was also used for parking areas, as well as for dispersal sites, when it was available. In addition, tents were used for billeting and also for support facilities; an access road was built to the existing road infrastructure; a dump for supplies, ammunition, and gasoline drums, along with a drinkable water and minimal electrical grid for communications and station lighting. Once completed, the Cassibile Airfield was turned over for use by the Twelfth Air Force 415th Night Fighter Squadron between September 5-November 5 1943, during which time Bristol Beaufighters flew night interceptor missions against Axis aircraft during the Sicilian and Italian Campaigns. When the American occupation of the area had withdrawn, the airfield was dismantled by engineers. Today, only the medieval watchtower used as a control tower remains; all the surrounding fields which were used as runways and aprons are used for agricultural purposes. References * Maurer, Maurer.

They operate mainly in Africa and Egypt and their websites claim they were founded in 1967 and now own several cruise ships and hotels which they operate. Daily Mail Reader offers are provided by this company. Information The founder of African Safari Club, Karl Jakob Rüdin, a Swiss national born in 1939, started tour operating and hotel operations in Kenya in 1967, with the erection of his first hotel, the Watamu Beach Hotel. Rüdin started his early career in Switzerland as an Air line operator, namely of Globe Air Globe Air History, financed by Billionaire arts collector R. Staechelin. After the crash of an air plane, and irregularities found during the after crash investigation, Rüdin was necessitated to disappear from front lines. So Kenya, a destination he knew from his air line back ground, proved best. With the money of Staechelin, Rüdin soon acquired more hotels and made contacts with first the local authorities (Emanuel Mahihu, then Coast Province Commissioner), who soon enabled him to get into business with the highest authorities, i.e. the President Kenyatta. He built a Hotel for Mahihu, the Bahari Beach Hotel, and as well for Kenyatta, the Silver Beach Hotel and the Silver Star Hotel. From then, nothing stood in his way, and he became one of the tycoons of Kenya. Facilities At the height of his business activities, app in 1990, he owned/operated the following hotels, safari lodges, and tourist related businesses: Hotels and Safari Lodges: * Watamu Beach Hotel * Sea Horse Club * Malaika Beach Hotel * Dolphin Beach Hotel * Flamingo Beach Hotel * Silver Beach Hotel * Silver Star Hotel * Bahari Beach Hotel * Shimo La Tewa Hotel (Casr al Bahar) * Coral Beach Hotel * Palm Beach Hotel * Shanzu Beach Hotel * Paradise Beach Hotel * Mara Buffalo Camp * Crocodile Camp * Kimana Lodge Ships: *M.S.

After Rüdin fell out with Roland due to his general inability of team working with others, the down fall of African started slowly but steadily. A last and potentially successful attempt to rescue the company began with the engagement of Kai Wulff as the CEO of the group. He took the company from a net asset value of 250M USD to a purchase offer of 500M USD before the owner family started to interfere with management once more and misappropriated funds which were allocated to renovations, plane upgrades and employee welfare. Mr. Wulff had successfully implemented an employee first policy and increased efficiency. The airline was changed to Airbus A310 from DC10 and the company was considering expanding into South Coast and other countries. After Mr. Wulff lost the mandate to control all aspects of the group, the company operated constantly with loss balances, and could no longer pay regular salaries of their 3000 employees as from 2003/2004. Rüdin started to sell the companies assets in order to continue with its operation, which was never really modernized due to Rüdins own view of things, which he almost always forced on to everyone interacting with him. A series of fires within the hotel group was attributed to have been arson laid by disgruntled employees, and things worsened in 2008, with the collapse of tourist bookings due to the Countries (Kenya) post polling violence. On 16 March 2011, African Safari Club UK, the main provider of tourists for Rüdins Kenya operation became insolvent and ceased trading with 500 UK customers that were in Kenya repatriated by the CAA . It is not clear what impact the collapse of the UK sales organisation will have on the remaining operations, But Rüdin, now in his eighties, wows to fight on, despite having lost the loyalty of most of his employees. It is reported that K.J. Rüdin died in March 2013 of a heart attack in his home in Mombasa.  African Charity Work  The company supports various African- centric charities.  M.E.A.K  Medical and Education Aid to Kenya. African Safari Club were awarded a M.E.A.K certification for their assistance with travel to and within Africa.  The Samson Chivatsi Charity  An African educational charity specialising in the building and maintaining of schools best known for the touring choir of African children known as The Singing Children of Africa. The SCA was founded in 1998 by couple Maureen and Ian McIntyre. Following a holiday in Kenya the couple were motivated to improve the educational and health opportunities for Kenyan children. Establishing a school in Utange, near Mozambique, the couple provide education and vaccinations to the local children and were commended by the Kenyan vaccination officer for having healthiest children they had seen.

List of consular and (until 1918) diplomatic missions in Hamburg.  History  Hamburg's history of diplomatic relations with foreign countries started in the 16th century, in that time the city was a free imperial city. The first missions from the city of Hamburg to other countries date back to the Middle Ages and Hamburg's participation in the Hanseatic league. At first representatives were called Oldermänner or by the English term \\"Courtmaster\\", later in the style of the common \\"Consul\\".Beneke, p. 1 As of 2009, there were 100 consulates in Hamburg, ranked the third-largest in the world (after New York City and Hong Kong) and largest in Europe. The consuls are official representatives of the government of a foreign state to the city of Hamburg, normally acting to assist the citizens of the consul's own country, to represent his country's interests, and to facilitate trade and friendship between the people of Hamburg and the country of which he is a representative. There are several consuls providing assistance with bureaucratic issues to both, the citizens of the consul's own country travelling or living abroad, and to Hamburg's citizens (and often Northern Germany, e.g. the Consulate-general of Japan), who wish to trade with the consul's country (e.g. information about visa or customs duties). Consuls are also patrons of fairs or exhibitions, like US Consul General Karen E. Johnson was the patron of the Youth Exchange Fair in September 2009. In the 19th century Hamburg was an important location for diplomatic missions, because of the prestige gained by the Hanseatic cities and the importance as a centre of commerce. The trade and independent striving of the Hanseatic cities of Bremen, Lübeck and Hamburg for the \\"common German service\\" were even named in the Westphalian peace treaty in 1648, and the Hanseatic and later Hamburgian consuls during the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries were also representatives for \\"all fellow Germans\\".Beneke, pp. 10-11 The Senate of Hamburg often opened a consulate to cities and countries, if a trade post existed, esp. by shipping. There were very few cities like Dresden--then capital of Saxony--without a sea port. Treaties were signed, if a proper unsalaried candidate for the position had been found.Beneke, p. 8 Article 23 of the treaty between the Hanseatic cities and Guatemala signed on 25 June 1847 decreed the bilateral deployment of consuls, or article 9 of the treaty with Sardinia ruled the judicial authority of the Hanseatic consuls.Beneke, pp. 13-14 Even in the 20th century, the importance of Hamburg is emphasized by the position of the port of Hamburg in the world's ranking. In 2007, it was one of the busiest container ports of the world. In the segment of transshipment Hamburg was in a leading position in 2004. In 2005, the port handled more containers with destination or provenance in Germany as Bremerhaven and Rotterdam combined. The first mission established, was from Austria (then Habsburg Monarchy) in 1570, the Slovak Republic's consulate was the 100th in 2006, and the last one was the consulate of the Palau (as of 2009), former German colony from 1899 until 1918/19. The first missions visiting Hamburg often were trade missions of foreign countries. During the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) constant diplomatic missions were needed, most of those envoys or residents were Hamburg citizens--only large and most influential states sent own nationals. Some countries sent their missions from 1815 - 1886, at this time Hamburg was an independent and sovereign state of the German Confederation.

After the Independence of Pakistan on August 14, 1947, Liaquat Ali Khan, the first Prime minister of Pakistan, made the first diplomatic approaches to the People's Republic of Poland and finally, on December 17, 1962, Pakistan became one of the first Muslim countries to establish relations with then-communist government of Poland. Poland opened an embassy in Karachi in 1962, but moved it to Islamabad Capital Venue in 1965. The Pakistani Government opened its embassy in Warsaw in 1969. Currently, Poland also maintains a cultural Consulate-General in Karachi as well as an honorary Consulate-General in Lahore. History Polish military engineers carrying out humanitarian aid after the 2005 Pakistan earthquake. President of Pakistan Pervez Musharraf with President of Poland Lech Kaczyński during his state visit to Poland in 2007 Polish ties with Pakistan date back to World War II. In September 1939 the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin had annexed Eastern Poland in cooperation with Nazi Germany, displacing many Poles, and triggering the outbreak of the Second World War with the Allies, including the British Empire. Once Nazi Germany attacked the USSR in June 1941, the British Empire and USSR established friendly relations and efforts were made to improve conditions for displaced Poles. Between August 24, 1942 and December 31, 1944 Polish refugees were evacuated from the USSR via the \\"Persian Corridor\\" in Iran and over thirty thousand of them were housed in refugee camps and were settled in Karachi (then part of British India), which was the nearest major port. Some remained in Karachi, becoming citizens of the newly established State of Pakistan in 1947. During World War II, the city of Karachi, the chief port in the territory that would become Pakistan, hosted around 30,000 Polish refugees. Some Polish academics joined the faculty of Karachi University, teaching courses ranging from physical sciences to social sciences. After the independence of Pakistan, Władysław Turowicz, along with thirty Polish officers and technicians, contributed to and assisted in the establishment of the Pakistan Air Force. On 14 August 2006, a memorial was erected in the Pakistan Air Force Museum in Karachi to acknowledge the services of the Polish airmen led by Air Commodore Turowicz. On the 1st of November 1970 the Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Zygfryd Wolniak was killed at Karachi airport during a welcome ceremonies by a Pakistan International Airlines employee and anti-communist Islamic fundamentalist named Mohammed Feroze Abdullah who was trying to kill the entire delegation but aiming for Polish President Marian Spychalski in particular. Driving a PIA cargo lorry at high speed he mowed down the delegation, narrowly missing his intended target. The other three victims were Pakistani; the Deputy Director of the Intelligence Bureau, Chaudhri Mohammed Nazir, and two government photographers.https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2202&dat;=19701102&id;=gYUlAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=z_IFAAAAIBAJ&pg;=877,6134046 His stated motivation to interrogators was his desire to kill socialists, believing that socialists and socialism were against Islam and Muslims. This occurred on the eve of Pakistan's first general elections in which right-wing Islamic parties such as the Jamaati Islami (whose main stronghold at the time was Karachi) were employing highly incendiary rhetoric against socialists as part of their elections campaigns.https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/04/archives/polish-aides-killer-is- termed-a-zealot.html Feroze was sentenced to death by a special military court on May 10, 1971, but permitted to appeal for clemency. The relationship between the two countries grew under the administration (1999-2008) of President Musharraf.http://www.defence.pk/forums/general- defence/4855-pakistan-poland-enhance-ties-defence-production-musharraf.html However, these close relations underwent tension when Pakistani Taliban members captured and brutally murdered a Polish engineer, Piotr Stanczak, in September 2008. He was beheaded by militants in February after talks with the government for the release of captured Taliban members failed. http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/KG30Df03.html Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency launched an inquiry into the crime. The FIA arrested former parliamentarian Maulana Abdul Aziz along with other perpetrators.http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content- library/dawn/news/pakistan/12-ex- legislator+named+in+plot+to+kill+polish+engineer--bi-12 Aziz and Attaullah, another suspect in the engineer's murder, was brought to Anti-Terrorism Court II in an armored personnel carrier under the protection of Islamabad and Attock police. The judge granted remand to the police of the former member of the National Assembly, who was elected on the ticket of Muttahida Majlis-e- Amal in 2002. The Bosal police also obtained two days’ physical remand of Attaullah. Defence ties Embassy of Pakistan in Warsaw In 1948, Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan sanctioned a three-year agreement with exiled members and officers of the Polish Air Force to build the Pakistan Air Force (PAF). Among them was General Władysław Turowicz, who became Deputy Chief of Air Staff in the PAF. The Polish officers and General Turowicz set up technical institutes, notably the Air Force Institute of Aviation Technology in Karachi. As the chief scientist of the Pakistan Air Force Academy he taught at and revitalized the school. He initially supervised technical training at the airbase and some of the Polish specialists in the technical section in Karachi. The Polish officers played an active part in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, leading and commanding air war operations against the Indian Air Force. The Polish officers helped defend Lahore and West Pakistan. The Pakistan Government bestowed the Sitara-e-Pakistan on General Turowicz, Major Anotnii Zbigniew Jedryszek and others; Turowicz and some of the pilots also received honorary Pakistani citizenship. General Turowicz and his family remained vital figures in Pakistan. In 1972 Turowicz and other Polish scientists participated in Pakistan's secret atomic bomb project. Polish scientists also helped the country to launch its space programme, with General Turowicz becoming the program's technical director in 1967. Cooperation Poland was one of the chief aid contributors to Pakistan after the 2005 Kashmir earthquake. Poland sent military engineers, geological scientists, and rescue dogs. Poland helped Pakistan to rebuild the earthquake-affected cities. Economic Cooperation As of 2010, bilateral trade between the two countries reached $210 million. Poland helped a number of Pakistani companies to open offices in Poland in order to cater to the regional European market. Poland is considered to have large shale gas deposits and prominent Polish geological surveying and exploration companies have business and investment relations with Pakistan. The trading relationship between Pakistan and Poland developed during the Government of Prime Minister of Pakistan Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Poland and Pakistan signed a trade agreement on avoidance of double taxation on September 25, 1974. Pakistan and Poland signed another agreement on maritime trade on January 25, 1975. An agreement on civil aviation was signed on September 30, 1977. Trade relations improved when President Pervez Musharraf paid a three-day official visit to Poland in April 2007. This was the first ever visit by a head of state of Pakistan to Poland. During his visit, President Musharraf had many engagements in the Polish capital, which included official talks with his Polish counterpart, Lech Kaczyński, and the Polish Prime Minister Jarosław Kaczyński. Five bilateral agreements and memoranda of understanding (MoUs) covering mutually beneficial co-operation in the fields of defense, small and medium size enterprises, education, science, culture, economic co-operation, were signed with the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry.

Gameplay  Gameplay is similar to Highway Encounter, with the player controlling a \\"Vorton\\" robot in its attempt to deliver a bomb to an alien base at the end of a highway. Various enemies and obstacles lie in its path. A notable difference is that the player has a single Vorton with an energy meter, instead of five lives; accordingly, the bomb must be pushed by the player, whereas in the previous game it was pushed by the player's spare Vortons.

Caterpillar John Curtis's British Entomology Volume 5 The wingspan is 20–22 mm. Forewing dull dark fuscous purple, with the lines slightly paler; the stigmata obscure; a subtriangular whitish blotch on base of vein 2; hindwing orange with broad black terminal border; the costa and inner margin narrowly black and the base of wing often smoky blackish; this, the type form, occurring in Sweden, the north of England and Scotland, and other northern localities is very different from the usual bright red form, which is the ab. rufescens Tutt. In this the forewing is a mixture of bright red, and olive brown or olive yellow; the transverse lines being more or less strongly whitish, the stigmata red brown with pale rings, and the white spot on vein 2 distinct; ab. peralbata ab. nov.

Abstaining from Kutha meat is one of the requirements for a Sikh to be an initiated Khalsa or sahajdhari according to the Rehat Maryada (Sikh code of conduct). Both the Hindu and the Sikh communities view slow methods of killing animals negatively and forbid adherents from consuming such meat. In Sikhism, there are two more reasons for objection to Kutha meat - firstly because of belief that sacrificing an animal in the name of God is mere ritualism (something to be avoided) and secondly as an opposition to right of ruling Muslims to impose it on non-Muslims. Description Kutha meat is any meat produced by slow bleeding or religious sacrifice of animals., Quote: \\"The Sikh Rahit Maryada forbids hair cutting, adultery, the use of intoxicants, and the eating of Kutha meat, that is Muslim halal meat, obtained through the slow bleeding or religious sacrifice of animals\\". For a Khalsa (baptised Sikh), eating Kutha meat is considered sinful. These four sins are part of the Sikh Code of Conduct (Sikh Rehat Maryada). These four transgressions (taboo practices) must be avoided: # Dishonouring the hair # Eating the meat of an animal slaughtered the Muslim Halal way or the Jewish Kosher way # Cohabiting with a person other than one's spouse # Using tobacco Jhatka meat According to Singha, Kutha meat is forbidden in Sikhism as one of the kurahits, although there is no clarity on encouraging or discouraging meat consumption in general. The rejection of Kutha meat was initiated by Sikh Gurus: While jhatka meat is acceptable in Sikhism, not all sources of meat are generally acceptable. Sikhs normally avoid eating beef out of consideration for the feelings of Hindus and also due to the fact that the cow, the buffalo and the ox are an integral part of rural Sikh livelihoods. Similarly, they avoid eating pork when they are in the company of Muslims. However, there is no religious prohibition about eating beef and pork.

The Irish News described the brigade as 'powerful' and at one time being 'the most bloody and murderous gang operating within the paramilitary organisation'. Since 2007 the South East Antrim Brigade has operated independently of the UDA following a fall-out. Emergence under Alan Snoddy It is unclear when South East Antrim was first designated as a brigade area although its first recognised leader was Alan Snoddy and he held title of Brigadier by at least 1979. Snoddy was close to UDA leader Andy Tyrie and was recognised as one of his closest allies amongst the UDA leadership.Wood, p. 355 Amongst the Brigade's most notorious attacks during the Troubles was the attempted killing of Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams in 1984. Adams was in a taxi near Belfast City Hall with some associates when another car containing John 'Grug' Gregg and two fellow Rathcoole UDA members pulled up alongside and opened fire on Adams. Adams was hit five times in the attack but the taxi rushed to the Royal Victoria Hospital where he received treatment and survived.Wood, p. 120 Gregg, Colin Gray and Gerry Welsh were immediately arrested by the waiting British Army, who had doctored the bullets to reduce their lethality.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, pp. 129-130 They were convicted for the attack the following year.Wood, p. 121 The attack is commemorated in the song South East Antrim Brigade by loyalist singer Rab C, many of whose compositions were about the brigade and its leading members. In the later 1980s Snoddy took ill with cancer and many of his duties as brigadier were filled by his ally Joe English. Snoddy died from the illness in September 1988 and English immediately succeeded him.Wood, p. 136 Towards ceasefire under Joe English As brigadier Joe English enjoyed, theoretically, more power than his predecessor, as Andy Tyrie had been removed from the UDA leadership and replaced by a collective leadership of the movement's six brigadiers, including English.McDonald & Cusack, p. 160 As the oldest member, English usually chaired the meetings of this Inner Council, although he often struggled to control UDA West Belfast Brigade brigadier Johnny Adair.Lister & Jordan, pp. 210-211 The two clashed frequently and, in 1993, Adair even threatened to kill English after English had suggested that the UDA should not claim the murder of Marie Teresa Dowds de Mogollon, which Adair's top hitman Stephen McKeag had perpetrated.Lister & Jordan, pp. 155-156 Later in the year, English was forced to confront Adair about rumours that Adair was considering attending an Inner Council meeting armed in order to eliminate the other five brigadiers and assume sole control of the UDA.Lister & Jordan, p. 209 English was a strong advocate of political means and pushed for the UDA to call a ceasefire in the early 1990s, a position that was anathema, at that point, to Adair.Lister & Jordan, p. 211 John Gregg as Brigadier A South East Antrim Brigade mural, Ballyduff estate, Newtownabbey Gregg was released from prison in 1993. His assassination attempt had made him a loyalist hero and he quickly took over from English as brigadier.Wood, p. 351 According to the Workers' Party of Ireland, English was stood down by the UDA after he had expressed willingness to enter into dialogue with them.Wood, p. 200 English would soon re-emerge as part of the Ulster Democratic Party. Under Gregg, drug-dealing became a major problem in brigade areas, particularly Rathcoole, with Gregg himself said to have a leading role in the illicit trade.McDonald & Cusack, p. 279 In late August 1997, the brigade became involved in simmering tensions with fellow loyalist paramilitaries in the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). Cloughfern Young Conquerors, a flute band attached to the brigade, had been to Derry for the annual Apprentice Boys of Derry march through the city centre when at the train station they met members of the Shankill Protestant Boys, a UVF-affiliated band. Brawls between the two had been frequent and tensions had been growing between the UDA and UVF, leading to a drink-fuelled pitched battle between the two groups at the train station. During the course of the melee a Shankill Protestant Boys member managed to gouge out Gregg's eye.McDonald & Cusack, p. 292 Although the UDA was officially on ceasefire, the South East Antrim Brigade remained active in late 1998 and early 1999, undertaking a series of pipe bomb attacks on Catholic properties. These were carried out under the Red Hand Defenders cover name, with some attacks also blamed on the Orange Volunteers who were active in similar attacks at the time.Wood, p. 233 Gregg, who was noted for his sectarian beliefs, insisted that such attacks were necessary in order to prevent the \\"greening\\" of places such as Carrickfergus and Antrim, a process he claimed had already happened in Glengormley where the Catholic population had experienced significant growth.Wood, p. 267 Around this time Gregg spearheaded an initiative to significantly increase recruitment into the South East Antrim Brigade. He told author Ian S. Wood that he had only supported the Combined Loyalist Military Command ceasefire in an effort to ensure the release of imprisoned friends. In 2000, he helped to ensure that a proposal before the Inner Council to initiate the decommissioning of weapons was rejected.McDonald & Cusack, p. 317 Trevor Lowry (aged 49) was beaten to death in Glengormley by UDA members under Gregg's command on 11 April 2001 after he was mistaken for a Catholic.McDonald & Cusack, p. 350 South East Antrim Brigade mural in Ballymena honouring John Gregg Gregg was not close to Johnny Adair but sympathised with his uncompromising attitudes and his anti-UVF views. Under Gregg, the South East Antrim Brigade was linked to the killing of UVF member Mark Quail during Adair's feud with the UVF in 2000EXECUTED: Fourth feud killing in four days as loyalist assassins murder UVF man in his flat.New UDA brigadier link to McColgan and Quail murders although according to the BBC the killing was not directly connected to Adair's issues with the UVF but rather stemmed from a pub dispute in north Belfast between members of the two paramilitary groups.Family call for end to 'murder madness' However, in late 2002 a UDA member originally from the Woodvale Road who had moved to Rathcoole was attacked after it emerged that he was a friend of Joe English, the former brigadier who had since been exiled from the area by Gregg for his anti-drugs stance.McDonald & Cusack, p. 369 In response, three Woodvale UDA members went to Gregg and complained about the attack in a move Gregg saw as a threat. He complained to senior figures in West Belfast before ordering that the three men be kneecapped.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, pp. 369-370 The shootings raised some anger on the Shankill, where the three were well-liked figures, and Adair sought to exploit this as a method of getting rid of Gregg. He sought to portray Gregg as unstable and thuggish and spread a rumour that he was about to be replaced as brigadier.McDonald & Cusack, p. 370 This briefly occurred in late August when one of Adair's allies took command of the brigade, although this proved short-lived.Guardian, 25 August 2002 Gregg was back in command by October, at which point he was one of the brigadiers who passed the resolution expelling Adair from the UDA for his involvement in the attempted murder of Jim Gray.McDonald & Cusack, p. 374 On 8 December, a bomb was found under Gregg's car, apparently placed there by one of Adair's allies from the Loyalist Volunteer Force.Lister & Jordan, p. 323 This was followed by two pipe bombs being thrown at Gregg's house and shots being fired at that of his friend Tommy Kirkham.Lister & Jordan, p. 325 A bomb attack on Adair's house on 8 January 2003 was blamed on Gregg by John White. Adair was returned to prison two days later.Lister & Jordan, Mad Dog, pp. 326-327 Members of Adair's C Company shot and killed Gregg the following month. His deputy Rab Carson was killed in the same attack, with both men having just returned from Scotland where they were attending a Rangers F.C. match.Wood, p. 291 Adair would be removed from his position of power soon afterwards in a show of strength by the mainstream UDA under the command of Jackie McDonald. Under Gary Fisher Gary Fisher, a close associate of Tommy Kirkham, succeeded Gregg as brigadier. Under Fisher, the South East Antrim Brigade became close to the Shoukri brothers, who commanded the neighbouring North Belfast Brigade before being expelled from the UDA in June 2006. In a move that was not universally popular in the region, Fisher allowed the Shoukris and their ally Alan McClean to live under South East Antrim Brigade protection and even attend meetings of the brigade's commanders.Pro-shoukri 'brigadier' ousted In response to the criticism from the rest of the UDA leadership, Fisher withdrew the South East Antrim brigade from the UDA and reconstituted it as a separate movement. In 2007, the UDA's inner council expelled the Brigadier in the South East Antrim area and his political adviser after a long-running stand-off between the mainstream UDA and the South East Antrim Brigade. The council released a statement expelling two figures within it, believed to be senior UDA figures Fisher and Kirkham, once a member of the Ulster Political Research Group (UPRG), although they were not named. This came within a few days of a £1m allocation to a conflict transformation project in loyalist areas. The Belfast Telegraph called the move \\"a familiar loyalist pattern of events.\\" The dissident branch was also revealed to have contained an informer after Jon McDowell, Tommy Kirkham's assistant, told the Belfast Telegraph that he was an RUC Special Branch agent in November 2007.Branch Spy at Heart of Rebel UDA A new interim leadership was appointed in their stead although the brigade effectively divided between those who supported the wider UDA leadership and those who remained loyal to Fisher. As of 2014, the South East Antrim Brigade is no longer considered part of the wider UDA and their brigadier does not attend meetings of the organisation's ruling Inner Council. In 2009, the brigade claimed to have decommissioned a substantial quantity of guns and explosives in a single day in the presence of the chairman of the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning (IICD). The brigade representatives refused to give any details about how many weapons or how much commercial explosives were destroyed during the day-long exercise. On 8 February 2010, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced that the Brigade had completed decommissioning. PM praises Northern Ireland decommissioning moves, BBC News, 8 February 2010 The process was confirmed as complete by the IICD and came in the last 24 hours of the Commission's existence.Three more Northern Ireland terrorist groups lay down their arms, The Times The decommissioning was completed at the same time as that of the republican Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) and Official Irish Republican Army (OIRA). Accusations that the brigade has remained active continued, however, and in 2009, the mother of Jason Ballard, a 20-year-old Greenisland native subjected to a vicious beating at his home, claimed that the attack had been carried out by the South East Antrim Brigade, although they denied any involvement in the attack.UDA Brigade deny being involved in gang attack In 2010, the Independent Monitoring Commission confirmed that the split between the Fisher faction of the brigade and the wider UDA had not ended.UDA confirm guns decommissioned As of 2014 Fisher was still identified by the Irish Independent as Brigadier, with the brigade reported as being in the process of rearming.A rebel UDA unit is re-arming in a grim warning to rival drug dealers.

Threats against journalists On 8 May 2020 a number of journalists working for the Sunday Life and Sunday World newspapers were warned by the PSNI about imminent attacks against journalists by the South East Antrim UDA. At least one journalist was warned of a possible under car booby trap. The threats were condemned by Peter Vandermeersch of Independent News & Media and Seamus Dooley, assistant General Secretary of the National Union of Journalists as did Amnesty International UK. Patsy McGlone, Stephen Farry, Steve Aiken and Doug Beattie also condemned the attacks and were subsequently warned by the PSNI of threats from the South East Antrim USA. According to the Irish Times there are suspicions that the threats are in response to coverage of the murder of Glenn Quinn in Carrickfergus in January 2020.

Early life Mary and William Rolleston and their children, at Kapunatiki; John Rolleston sitting in the front row second from the left Rolleston was born in Christchurch on 4 December 1877,See talk page the son of Mary Rolleston. His father, the last Superintendent of the Canterbury Province, William Rolleston was in Wellington for the third session of the 6th Parliament and intended to be home in the second week of December, but it is likely that he will have missed the birth, as his seventh child (of nine in total) was born a week early. At the time of his birth, the family was living at Linwood House. His grandfather was Joseph Brittan (1805–1867). From 1880 to 1884, the Rolleston family lived in Wellington. William Rolleston held various ministerial posts in ministries led by John Hall (1879–1882), Frederick Whitaker (1882–1883) and Harry Atkinson (1883–1884) and their house in Molesworth Street, on the site that is these days occupied by Saint Paul's Cathedral, gave easy access to the Parliament Buildings. With the defeat of the Atkinson Ministry, William Rolleston lost his ministerial income and due to the effects of the depression of the 1880s, the family moved to William Rolleston's farm Kapunatiki at the south bank of the Rangitata River near its mouth in 1884. John Rolleston started farming in Rangitoto in the Waitomo District around 1908. He served in World War I. He left Lyttelton on 16 October 1914 on board the Tiroa for Egypt as a trooper. He was badly wounded on his left arm in the Gallipoli Campaign. After the war, he returned to his farm in Rangitoto. On 5 July 1922, he married Agnes Beatrice (Nancy) Johnston of Oruawharo at St. Vincent de Paul's Church in Takapau. They were to have one son (Christopher; d. 1954). Political career Rolleston was chosen by the Reform Party to be the candidate in the Waitomo electorate in the 1922 general election. He defeated the incumbent, William Jennings of the Liberal Party, by 3447 to 3441 votes, a majority of only six votes. He was defeated in 1928 by Walter Broadfoot of the United Party. In 1935, he was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal. Death Rolleston died on 22 May 1956.

Joseph Montferrand (1802-1864), a logger of imposing stature and extraordinary physical strength, was from Kiamika. Etymology The municipality is named after the Kiamika River, which flows through its territory and is a tributary of the Du Lièvre River. This name, mentioned by Stanislas Drapeau as Kiamica and appearing on a map of Quebec by Eugène Taché from 1870, comes from the Algonquin word kickiamika meaning \\"steep cut below the water\\", from kicki (steep cut) and amick (below the water). However, an alternate meaning may be \\"deep and quiet river\\", from the roots kiam (deep) and ka (quiet). History In 1883, the Colonization Society of Montarville was founded and took possession of the area in 1884. Settlers established on the banks of the Du Lièvre River, about 11 km south of Val-Barrette, the mission of Saint-Gérard-de-Kiamika, also called Saint-Gérard-de-Montarville. A year later its post office opened. In 1890, the Kiamika Township is proclaimed. In 1898, the Township Municipality of Kiamika is formed. In 1920, the mission received its status as a parish.

They are found on most main streets and most churches in Scotland. Many commemorate the sacrifice of the First World War but there are many others to wars before and since 1914–1918. History of Scottish war memorials The history of Scotland has often been bloody and there is a martial tradition which is strong in Scotland. Scots have fought in many battles and served in armed forces in many parts of the world. This service has been part of Scots armies; as mercenaries, and in the British Armed Forces. The service of the martial Scots are commemorated with war memorials across Scotland and around the world. Scottish war memorials commemorate the sacrifices made as early as 1263 up to the recent war in Iraq and the conflict in Afghanistan The earliest memorials record the battles fought against Viking and English invaders. Later ones recall Scottish civil wars. Sometimes these civil wars are related to religious intolerance, sometimes over the succession of royalty. Most of these early memorials have the same thing in common. They were not erected until the 19th century, sometimes hundreds of years after the actual battle had taken place. Another thing they have in common is that they do not list individual names. By the late 19th century after several small Colonial wars the infantry and cavalry regiments of Scotland had started to erect memorials in churches and garrison towns in Scotland. These memorials would now include lists of names. Sometimes just Officers, but sometimes non- commissioned officers and enlisted men The first recorded civic war memorial in Scotland where local men who died overseas in war and were named on a stone is in the local churchyard at Balmaclellan, Dumfries and Galloway and was erected after the Crimean War. It was not until fifty years later after the Second Boer War that other civic war memorials were erected in Scotland. By 1914 a precedent had been set for local communities for erecting war memorials when they had lost their sons in war time. By the time the First World War had finished in 1918 nearly every community in Scotland decided to erect a memorial to their own war dead.Boorman, D (1988) \\"At the Going Down of the Sun: British First World War Memorials\\" At the same time a proposal for a national war memorial led to the creation of the magnificent shrine at Edinburgh Castle. The Scottish National War Memorial. This memorial continues to commemorate Scots who have died in wars since 1914 and currently commemorates 206,779Report to the Trustees of the Scottish National War Memorial, 2008 men and women who have died serving in UK and Commonwealth Forces.

Because of the size of military formations during the First World War there were not only regimental memorials erected but Scottish Brigade and Scottish Divisional memorials too. Commando Memorial in the Scottish Highlands was unveiled in 1952, dedicated to the World War II British Commandos that trained at Achnacarry Castle. After the Second World War many communities had the sad task of adding names to their existing war memorial.Boorman, D (1990) \\"For your tomorrow: British Second World War Memorials\\" Aberlady, East Lothian used the same memorial they had erected for the Boer War and used again for the First World War to list their Second World War Dead. Other communities chose to erect new memorials for the Second World War Dead rather than change the First World War Memorial. Even today communities are still erecting war memorials to men and women who died in the First and Second World Wars. Recent unveilings of Scottish war memorials include. * The civic war memorials at Waterloo, Lanarkshire and Cowie, Stirling. * The Air Forces Memorial at Grangemouth * The Black Watch memorial at Balhousie Castle, Perth * \\"Buckhaven’s Secret\\", Fife * 'Bamse' Memorial to the Norwegian Navy dog at Montrose * WW1 Nurses' Memorial at Central Library, Edinburgh, unveiled on 11 November 2015 Types of Scottish war memorials There is no typical Scottish war memorial. Five of the most common types are Celtic cross, obelisk, cairn, mercat cross, and statue but they can also take the form of plaques or tablets of bronze, brass, marble, granite or wood; memorial gardens; fountains; rolls of honour; Crosses of Sacrifice;clock towers; lychgates; parks; halls; hospitals; bandstands; stained glass windows; altars; baptismal fonts; sporting cups and medals. Scotland was lucky to have artists and architects such as Sir Robert Lorimer, Alexander Carrick, Charles Pilkington Jackson, Thomas Clapperton and William Birnie Rhind amongst others who created some memorable monuments across the county. After the First World War there was a difference of opinion in some communities as to whether a memorial to a community's sacrifice should be a practical memorial which would benefit the living or a stone memorial to the dead. This led to some memorials being District Nurses,From \\"The Scotsman\\" – Saturday, 22 July 1922, \\"A war memorial was last year installed in the parishes of Kintail and Glenshiel, Ross-shire, by the Clan Macrae Society in the form of a district nurse, as this was considered a better form of memorial to the gallant clansmen who had fallen than by wasting money on bricks and mortar\\" hospital beds, holiday cottages for war widows and orphans. Reorganisations of health care since the formation of the National Health Service has meant that the care of these memorials was taken out of local control and many of these memorials no longer exist. With the disappearance of the memorial the sacrifice is forgotten. Care of memorials War memorial in Largs, North Ayrshire Once the memorials were erected and unveiled the committee who raised them then passed them into the care of another organisation. In the case of the civic memorials they were passed on to the local Municipal Corporation or County Council who still maintain them to this day (as Unitary Authorities) through the local community council. Often the local branch of the Royal British Legion Scotland or other local volunteers help with the maintenance and upkeep of the civic memorials. The Royal British Legion Scotland also run an annual campaign called the \\"Best Kept War Memorial\\". Non-civic memorials are often in the care of churches, or clubs or private companies. When these organisations leave a building, refurbish it or close then the future of the war memorials in their care is not always assured. Since the 1960s church mergers and closures have sometimes meant that memorials integral to the buildings have been lost when the building has been demolished. Sometimes a new memorial is created to replace the old one such as at St George's Church in Edinburgh. Sometimes photographs of the memorials are all that is left. Greenside Church in Edinburgh have photographs of the memorial windows of St James's which were demolished along with the building in 1975. The roll of honour from St Mungo's Church is in private hands after it was left for salvage when the Lockhart Memorial Church in Edinburgh dissolved in 1984. Other private memorials are at risk too. A roll of honour in Livingston was recovered from a rubbish skip after the Social Club it was in was refurbished in 2008 and the memorial was thrown away. Interest in Scottish war memorials There are three organisations with a national interest in Scottish war memorials. *UK National Inventory of War Memorials is based in the Imperial War Museum in London and is recording basic information of all the UK's war memorials. Also known as the UKNIWM *War Memorials Trust has been set up to help local organisations with information on maintenance, conservation, listing and cleaning of war memorials. In Scotland it works with Historic Scotland in running a small grants scheme for conservation and repair of war memorials including restoring the legibility of inscriptions. (note that routine maintenance is specifically excluded) *The Scottish War Memorials Project has been set up to record Scotland's war memorials (see below) The Scottish War Memorials Project Running since December 2006 as a voluntary project to photograph and record all of Scotland's war memorials and make them online for free. The Scottish War Memorials Project has over 4,900 war memorials recorded to date including nearly all the c.1,400 civic memorials in the cities, towns and villages across Scotland. Using photograph hosting websites the project is internet forum based. It has no running costs and is entirely voluntary. Examples of Scottish war memorials Based on the UKNIWM's approximate total of 100,000 war memorials in the whole of the UK then an assumption of a total of Scottish war memorials of up to 10,000 is not an unreasonable estimate. It would be impossible to list them all here so the following lists are based on examples already listed on Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons.

Early career Garrow attended the Glasgow Academy, where he rose to the rank of cadet sergeant in the academy's officer training corps. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 9th Battalion of the Highland Light Infantry in the Territorial Army on 21 May 1930. He was promoted to lieutenant on 21 May 1933 and entered active service on 9 June 1937. Second World War Following the surrender of the Highland 51st Division at Saint-Valéry-en-Caux on the Normandy coast on 12 June 1940, Garrow, then a lieutenant, managed to avoid being taken prisoner. On hearing that France had surrendered, Garrow and other British personnel tried unsuccessfully to escape to the Channel Islands. In August, after walking to Marseilles, Garrow turned himself in to the Vichy French regime and was officially interned, although able to move freely around the city. From October 1940, Garrow began working with other British internees and agents such as Nancy Wake, to organise the escape to Britain of Allied internees, POWs and other personnel stranded in France. They were joined by Albert Guérisse in June 1941, whose nom de guerre of \\"Pat O'Leary\\" also became the name of a network ferrying Allied personnel out of France, the \\"Pat O'Leary Line\\". Garrow was arrested by Vichy police in October 1941 and later interned at Mauzac (Dordogne). His role as head of the escape line was taken over by O'Leary. Garrow was rescued from Mauzac in December 1942 by the Pat Line and sheltered with Marie Dissard (code name Françoise) in Toulouse, before being taken across the Pyrenees to the British Consulate in Barcelona. Garrow returned to England at the beginning of February 1943, and as a war- substantive captain, was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) on 4 May. Michael Foot and Jimmy Langley describe him as \\"a tall dark-haired captain in the Seaforth Highlanders in his early twenties, who spoke French with a noticeable Scots accent\\". Postwar Garrow ended the war as a lieutenant (war-substantive major), and was promoted to the substantive rank of major on 1 January 1949. He continued in the Territorial Army, and retired on 20 September 1958 as an honorary lieutenant-colonel. External links * WO208/3312-1075 \\"Captain I G Garrow, DSO (service number 57346).

It is a contraction of 'smog monster'. History Originally, this was a term of abuse for supporters of Middlesbrough F.C. coined by their Sunderland A.F.C. counterparts. The name was meant to refer to the heavy air pollution once produced by the local petrochemical industry, and from Dorman Long. Though, at first, Smoggie was used as a pejorative term, it has become an example of reappropriation with many people now proudly calling themselves 'Smoggies'. Current usage Primarily directed at people from Teesside, 'Smoggies' is often used to describe the areas of Teesside with a noticeable amount of industry. The term was referred to by Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland MP, Tom Blenkinsop, in the House of Commons, and was recorded in Hansard, in July 2011. Smoggies has occasional use as a nickname for Middlesbrough F.C.. In 2013 the Cleveland Art Society organised a major exhibition of the works of local artists entitled Smoggies Allowed in an Art Gallery.

Glensister; Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology Part K R.C. Moore (ed) Univ.Kans. press Taxonomy Bactroceras was named by Holm (1898). Its type is Bactroceras avus. It was assigned to the Baltoceratidae by Furnish and Glenister(1964) and retained there by Evans (2005).D. H. Evans. 2005. The Lower and Middle Ordovician cephalopod faunas of England and Wales. Monograph of the Palaeontographical Society 623:1-81 Some paleontologists have regarded Bactroceras as an early bactritid because of its spherical apex and ventral siphuncle. However, a more recent study has argued that the shell of Bactroceras has important differences from those of true bactritids. For instance, the first shell chamber of Bactroceras resembles that of other Ordovician orthocerids, such as Archigeisonoceras and Hedstroemoceras: it is about 10 mm in diameter and is short, forming a spherical cap. True bactritids more strongly resemble late Silurian and Devonian orthocerids, whose first chamber is only about 5 mm across. Moreover, there is a large stratigraphic gap of nearly 50 million years between Bactroceras and the next orthocones with a spherical apex and ventral siphuncle. Morphology Bactroceras had a thin, cone shaped shell. Its siphuncle, the tube connecting its chambers to the animal's body, was ventral, which means that it ran next to the shell wall on the underside of the shell. The first chamber of the shell was spherical. The soft anatomy of the animal was not known, but it lacked mineral deposits in its shell, it may have floated with the point of its shell upward, but somewhat inclined. Bactroceras differs from the later cephalopod Bactrites in being more circular in cross section and having deeper V-shaped ventral lobes. Fossil distribution Fossils were found in Middle Ordovician strata dating from the Whiterockian/Llanvirnian age. Locations were varied and stretched from New South Wales, Australia to El Puente, Bolivia to Antelope Valley, Nevada.

The sport of gliding had been developed in Germany in the 1920s but had spread widely by 1936, allowing an international demonstration to the International Olympic Committee (IOC). No contest took place and no prizes were allowed by the IOC. ISTUS (Internationale Studienkommission für motorlosen Flug) which later became part of the FAI Gliding Commission had wanted to present prizes, but this did not happen. However, a Swiss, Hermann Schreiber, was awarded a gold medal for his flight across the Alps in 1935. The demonstration at the 1936 Berlin Olympics was at Berlin-Staaken airfield on 4 August. 14 pilots from seven countries (Bulgaria, Italy, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Switzerland, Germany and Austria) took part. On the previous day, a wing of a glider broke during an aerobatic flight by an Austrian, Ignaz Stiefsohn. He was killed. The Hungarian pilot, Lajos Rotter, declared on the evening of 10 August at Rangsdorf that the next day he would fly to Kiel, where Olympic sailing events were held. He then flew his Nemere glider to Kiel in poor weather. On arrival over Kiel at an altitude of 650 m he saluted the Olympic site with two loops and landed at Holtenau 4hr 31min after launch. The distance flown was 336.5 km. This was then the longest pre-declared goal flight by a glider.Biography of Lajos Rotter - Accessed 26 August 2009 Gliding was officially accepted by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) at their 1938 Cairo Conference as part of the \\"facultative\\" (optional) group of sports, and was to be staged for the first time in the 1940 Summer Olympics. An Olympic glider, the DFS Olympia Meise, was chosen in 1939 but the Games were cancelled due to the outbreak of the Finnish/Russian winter war.

Manufacturing takes place entirely in the United Kingdom. There are several ranges of model kit - railway buildings in Series A; houses, farm buildings and industrial buildings in Series B; houses and shops in low relief (to line the backs of layouts) in series C and brick and stone textured paper in series D. Superquick models are equally suitable for the model railway scales of both OO (1:76) and HO (1:87). The Superquick Model range was launched in 1960 by Donovan Lloyd, who was born in 1914, trained as an artist and illustrator in the late 1930s and died in 2009. Mostly the buildings are modelled in the architectural vernacular of the 1930s British suburbs and provinces. Although likely prototypes of some of the models can be identified, there is no serious attempt to reproduce particular buildings. It was considered more important to provide full value from the materials of the kit than to model any details exactly. The industrial logic of print requires volume production, which means that the models must appeal to a wide audience rather than to specialist modellers. The main selling features of printed kits are that they are inexpensive compared to moulded plastic kits and that the plastic kit manufacturers have not yet been able to achieve the exact surface detail to be had from print. Superquick uses specialist print techniques to heighten the models' realism in the context of the model railway layout. In Great Britain in 1960 this special printing and the practices of printing on fine paper, mounting the paper on card and die-cutting the result (to save the modeller from cutting the components himself) gave Superquick a great advantage over other makers of card kits; the other ranges from that time are selling at low volumes or now extinct. From the beginning, through being deliberately printed in volume, Superquick has always been competitively priced. Many modellers have considerable fondness for the kits, because in the period 1960 to 1995 they were the obvious choice for the first buildings on their layout. That being so and as sales of Superquick rocketed in the late 1960s, there was criticism of the kits by leading modellers for whom “Superquick kits were a particular cliché and the Superquick low-relief buildings eventually came to blight any layout on which they appeared\\".http://www.doubleogauge.com/history/History3.htm When the range was launched, there were several formats and scales. Whereas now the pack is virtually standardised at 320 mm × 200 mm, there were square packs 200 mm × 200 mm and at least one pack 280 mm × 200 mm. There were kits in the British TT scale (1:100) and kits in the MR series to go with the Scalextric slot-car track (1:32). The TT scale kits were the first to be discontinued, in the late 1970s. These are now highly prized by collectors, and fetch large sums when unmade kits become available. Peter Denny's son made a complete set of the buildings for his 3 mm layout, pictures of which appear in Peter Denny's Buckingham Great Central: 25 Years of Railway Modelling.Publisher: Peco (Mar 1972) Some of the current range are kits which were newly designed in the 1970s. These replaced discontinued kits but kept alive their model numbers. The discontinued kits still appear on eBay and at other outlets from time to time. The only kit to be discontinued at about this time and not replaced was C3 \\"Low Relief Modern Shops & Flat\\". Mr Lloyd never admitted it, but others believed he terminated the kit prematurely for being too ugly. The firm PEMS Butler Ltd, whose subordinate company had been the dedicated exporter of the range, took over the range in 1992 and extended it with additional railway, village and industrial buildings whilst adhering to the original design style and commercial policy. Reflecting family generational succession, the ownership moved in June 2016 to the firm Brickwall Works Ltd. It was commercial policy to supply the kits directly to model shops and other retailers, a factor in keeping the retail price low. However, with effect from January 2011, this policy was changed so that supply was effected through dedicated model hobby distributors. As a result of this and the coincidental rise in the VAT rate, retail prices were noticeably increased. They remain competitive. Superquick faced criticism for the rationalisation of the kits carried out by Donovan Lloyd in the 1970s. The original series included buildings found in many market towns around the UK, with the exception of the 1960s supermarket, and the modern low relief set (C3): indeed in original reviews, the Georgian Bank, and Elizabethan Cottages were noted as being very \\"twee\\".Railway Modeller Magazine (July 1968) However the changes in the 1970s introduced buildings that were much squarer, and plainer. In particular the loss of the old B28 Elizabethan Cottage, which had been profitably marketed by a Californian retailer as “Anne Hathaway’s Cottage”, was much regretted. The new B28 pair of Elizabethan cottages was a lot more “twee” than ever the original had been. There has been criticism that the kits issued after the change of ownership in 1992 included buildings that really were not suitable for the majority of model railways, which were based on the branch lines. Still the earlier kits are all available as ever and no significant branch line subjects remain to be modelled in the range. While it is true that the Coaling Tower and the Ash Plant would be mainline features and would tend to tower over most model layouts, critics would be (and the company has been) surprised to learn that sales of these new kits have proved better than at least one of the staple railway kits. Superquick gained some exposure from the title sequence of the UK TV Series \\"Homes under the hammer\\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006v5kb where all 13 series ran a sequence showing a selection of the vernacular Superquick buildings, with some minor changes to add chimneys covered with UK currency.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTR2yAyYxi0 A large quantity of the superquick buildings were also built for episode 6 of James May's Toy Stories. A number of Superquick models are destroyed in a scene in the film The Life and Death of Peter Sellers, where Sellers stamps on them in retribution for his son having \\"fixed\\" a paint blemish on Sellers's Bentley by painting a \\"go faster stripe\\" on the side.

The original estate was the center of operations of the Grubb Family Iron Dynasty during the 19th century and included over , a charcoal iron furnace, a grist mill, housing for employees and tenants, plus supporting structures such as a post office, a general store, a railroad station, a school and a church. The existing mansion and grounds remain from what was once a thriving industrial headquarters complex and small village. The mansion itself was originally constructed as a Federal-style home by the prominent family of iron masters; an 1895 remodeling transformed the structure with the addition of Victorian features. The mansion is constructed of locally quarried red sandstone, as are the outbuildings, which at one time numbered nearly 30. The grounds is also notable for its pre-1840 American formal garden, of which there are very few surviving. The estate currently hosts the Mount Hope Estate and Winery, the Swashbuckler Brewing Company, the Pennsylvania Renaissance Faire, and other events held throughout the year (see below). History The estate was the home and center of operations of the Grubb Family Iron Dynasty during the 19th century. The Mount Hope Grubbs were from an early American family whose founder, John Grubb, had come to America from Stoke Climsland, Cornwall, England and settled in Delaware. John's youngest son Peter Grubb came to the local area about 1734, when he discovered the vast iron deposits in Lebanon County and purchased . By 1742 he had founded the highly successful Cornwall Ironworks, named to recall his father's ancestral home. By 1783 the family's holdings covered . The property was split several times among heirs, and various lands passed between the Grubb and Coleman families in the late 18th century. In 1784, Peter Grubb's youngest son Peter Grubb, Jr. purchased an additional and built a charcoal furnace at a place that he called \\"Mount Hope\\". Peter Jr. left the land to his two sons, who inherited a total of that were to become known as the \\"Mount Hope Estate\\". His youngest son, Henry Bates Grubb, acquired his brother's share and built the mansion by 1805. The Grubbs were locally prominent by at least 1784, and from 1840 to 1870 were the leading iron manufacturers in Pennsylvania, with Mount Hope Estate serving as the center of their operations. During this period the estate played host to many leading Pennsylvanians including the Shippen family, Episcopalian ministers including Bishop William White and Bishop Alonzo Potter, and other leading ironmasters including Robert Coleman. At the Grubb family's height in the mid- to-late 19th century, the estate included a charcoal furnace, mill workers' houses, Mount Hope Episcopal Church (also called Hope Church, and \\"principally erected for the Grubb family\\"), the mansion, many stone outbuildings, and large formal gardens. After the death of Henry Bates Grubb, the estate was managed by his widow, Harriet Amelia Buckley Grubb, until her children reached adulthood. In 1848-49, at a cost of about $2,000, she had an Episcopal church, known today as \\"Hope Church\\", erected on the property, \\"for the moral and spiritual uplift of the tenants on her estate and the employees of the Mount Hope Furnace\\". In 1885, Clement Brooke Grubb, one of Henry's sons, purchased the mansion and surrounding land for $300,000 from the heirs of his younger brother, Alfred Bates Grubb. That October, Clement gave the church and churchyard to the Episcopal Diocese of Central Pennsylvania. Upon Clement's death, he left it to his daughter, the last descendant of the Grubb family to own it, Daisy Elizabeth Brooke Grubb, who renovated the 32-room mansion in the Victorian architectural style. After Daisy's death, the property was subdivided and passed through numerous owners until Charles Romito purchased the mansion and immediately surrounding land for $1 million in 1980 to open a winery. Mount Hope Estate and Winery After planting the vineyards and vinting wines, Romito opened the Mount Hope Estate and Winery in 1980. To promote his new business the first year, Romito hosted several events including an art show, a bluegrass concert, a fifties revival, a country- western weekend, a classical orchestra concert, and a one-day modern jousting tournament. The jousting tournament was so popular that Romito held a two-day renaissance festival the following year in the winery's parking lot, and gradually expanded this into a permanent attraction, the Pennsylvania Renaissance Faire. The property was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, and in 1991 the boundaries were increased as part of the Iron and Steel Resources of Pennsylvania Multiple Property Submission (MPS). Architecture Two distinct architectural styles are visible in the Estate. Originally constructed in the Federal style for Henry Bates Grubb between 1800 and 1805, Mount Hope Estate was the most formal ironmaster's mansion built in the area between 1750 and 1850. In 1895, Daisy Grubb oversaw significant changes, adding a Victorian ballroom, a billiard room, chandeliers, and parquet floors, and converting original hinged doors to sliding doors, while still maintaining much of the original construction, including the original facade and fireplace mantels. Exterior The three- story bay window which rises to an octagonal turret at the west end of the house was built as part of the 1895 remodelling. The south-facing two-story facade, made of locally cut red sandstone, remains substantially unchanged from the original 1800–05 construction. The wooden porch running the length of the facade appears to be a reconstruction, as part of the 1895 remodeling, of a similar original porch. The entire west end of the house went through substantial changes in the 1895 remodelling. This included the construction of a striking three-story bay window rising to an octagonal turret with a patterned roof, and a two-story bay window near the southwest corner. The most significant additions made during the 1895 remodelling are located at the rear (north) of the house. These include a conservatory with a polygonal glass dome, a greenhouse just east of the conservatory, and an enlarged kitchen. The eastern end of the house was also remodeled in 1895, in locally cut red sandstone to match the facade. Aside from several gothic arches from the original construction, the entire visible structure at this end was built in 1895. Interior The interior of the mansion, like the exterior, is a mixture of original 1800–05 construction and decoration, blended rooms, and Victorian construction and decor. The entry hall is almost entirely original construction. Nearly all the woodwork and decoration in this area dates to the 1800-05 period, with the exception of several balusters and newel posts on the spiral staircase, which were Victorian replacements. The major change to the entry hall was the construction of false walls, allowing the conversion of the original hinged doors into sliding doors. The second floor central hall and Washington Room (on the second floor, in the southeast corner) were also changed very little in the renovation. The dining room, on the other hand, saw extensive remodeling in 1895. The room size was increased by the construction of a bay window, parquet floor was installed, and the room was decorated in cherry woodwork, with a gilt and crystal chandelier and sconces. The only original item remaining left in the room was the fireplace mantel. The Pink Room, named for the pink damask which covered the walls in 1895, the library, the Best Chamber (Daisy Grubb's bedroom), was also extensively remodeled. A number of new rooms were added to the house as part of the 1895 work. A billiard room and ballroom were added in the rear of the house, and several ornate bathrooms were added on the second and third floors. Grounds Outbuildings At one time there were nearly 30 outbuildings on the estate, as well as a wall surrounding the estate, all constructed of the same locally quarried red sandstone as the mansion, \\"of which there seems to be an inexhaustible supply on the estate\\". Some of the buildings, like Hope Church, are on property that was given away or subdivided over the years, and today, only four remain on the estate, all located to the north (rear) and northeast of the mansion. The smokehouse is a square two-story building with a hipped roof, and is believed to date to the early 19th century. East of the smokehouse, a 1-story building with a three bay facade and a gabled roof was used as a post office in the late 19th century, and may have served as a schoolhouse originally. The manager's farmhouse stands 2 stories high and is L-shaped with a porch. The springhouse is also 2 stories. Gardens A fountain in the Mount Hope gardens The overall plan of the gardens, based on English formal gardens, can be traced to the original 1800-05 construction. Although some flower beds, ornamental urns, and the round fountain in front of the mansion were installed at the time of the 1895 remodeling, the overall plan was not changed, leaving the garden as \\"a very rare and largely intact example of a documented American formal garden predating 1840.\\" Mount Hope Estate Craft Brands Swashbuckler Brewing Company The Swashbuckler Brewing Company, founded by Mount Hope Estate & Winery's Managing Partner, Scott Bowser, began production in 2000 on the grounds of the Pennsylvania Renaissance Faire with an annual capacity of 1,200 barrels. Originally located in the Swashbuckler Brew Pub (now known as the Anchor & Mermaid Tavern), the production facility quickly outgrew this facility and, in 2015, beer production was moved to a new on-site facility just outside the Fairegrounds called SBC Brewsmiths. With a current annual capacity of 1500 barrels, Swashbuckler Brewing Company continues to produce beers for the Mount Hope Estate events welcoming 250,000 guests annually. Mount Hope Winery In 1980, Mount Hope Winery opened for business in an effort to attract visitors to the estate. The vineyards and production were located in Lake Erie County until 2015 when Mount Hope winery returned production of its wines to Lancaster County when it acquired the assets of another winery that closed. In late 2016, Mount Hope began repurposes an existing barn located approximately 300 feet from the current Wine Shop and parallel to the Swashbuckler Brewery into a new winery facilities. The barn was originally built in the 1800s and rebuilt in 1908 after a fire. The ground floor of the new winery provides 9200 square feet of workable space for new equipment consisting of an additional 20,000 gallons, bringing total capacity to 40,000 gallons. Two 5200 gallon tanks stand outside the new production facility used for bulk juice storage for the wine and cider production. A 2000 square foot refrigeration unit, easily accessible with a fork lift, provides an area for cold stabilizing of the winery products. Lancaster County Cider At the start of 2016, Mount Hope introduced Lancaster County Cider to its beverage brands. Already popular with visitors to the Estate's events, Lancaster County Cider is now available in the Mount Hope Wine Shop (Manheim), The Mount Hope Wine Gallery (Bird-in- Hand), the Mount Hope Wine Shop at Miller's Smorgasbord (Ronks) and through distribution by Kirchner Beverage Distributor in Lancaster, PA. Lancaster County Cider began a 2016-2018 partner of the Reading Fightin Phils and supplies hard cider visitors to FirstEnergy Stadium through its Lancaster County Cider Stand located in the stadium's main grandstand. Pennsylvania Renaissance Faire In 1980, a jousting tournament was held in the parking lot of the newly opened winery, followed by a two-day Renaissance fair the following year. This gradually expanded to become the Pennsylvania Renaissance Faire, which is now held over 12 weekends and draws more than 250,000 patrons annually. Featuring a recreation of a 16th-century Tudor village, a replica of the Globe Theatre, Shakespearean plays, musical acts, and artisans fashioning period items such as pottery and potpourri. In 1998, the faire was named one of the top 100 motorcoach-accessible events in America by the American Bus Association. Other events In addition to hosting the Renaissance fair, the grounds are opened to the public for a number of other events. Tours of the mansion and wine tastings are available throughout the year. Each June, the site is used for the Celtic Fling and Highland Games. The Fling features traditional and modern Celtic music, food, crafts, demonstrations and competitions, and a feis is also held. The Highland Games are officially sanctioned by the Mid-Atlantic Scottish Athletics Association, and include standard events such as caber tossing and hammer throwing. In late fall and early winter, the mansion is host to several theatrical performances. From the end of October to mid-November, Poe Evermore, a storytelling event based on the works of Edgar Allan Poe is held. Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, Victorian Christmas or A Dickens of a Christmas, the telling of the story of A Christmas Carol, is performed.

Stadium Authentic Mustard is the trademarked name of a brown mustard, manufactured in Illinois,Cleveland.com - Battle of the mustards: Stadium vs. Bertman's - October 2, 2011] popular in Northeast Ohio, particularly in Cleveland. Stadium Authentic is an alternative formulation of Joe Bertman's original signature mustard recipe, also produced by Bertman's family's company as Bertman Original Ballpark Mustard. Stadium Authentic Mustard is sold at retail outlets and served in over 150 stadiums and arenas throughout the United States. History In 1969, David Dwoskin, a sales representative of Bertman's company in the northeast Ohio area, formed the Davis Food Company to make \\"The Brown Mustard\\" served at the Cleveland Municipal Stadium available for retail sales in supermarkets. In 1971, David Foods registered the name \\"The Authentic Stadium Mustard\\". In 1982, Davis Food Company obtained exclusive rights to sell to both wholesale and retail markets as well as stadiums, arenas and other venues. In the early 1980s there was a disagreement between Bertman and Dwoskin. Dwoskin produced the original mustard under the Stadium Mustard brand through his own company. The Bertman Family continues to sell its version of the mustard through its Bertman Foods Company. Dwoskin told Cleveland.com that his mustard is served in 150 stadiums in the United States including First Energy Stadium and Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse. Both mustards are sold in grocery stores, specialty food shops, and online. A 2011 blind tasting revealed strong similarities between the two brands, with Bertman, which has some sugar in it, being a bit sweeter, and Stadium being a bit more spicy. Style Stadium Mustard is made with only brown mustard seed, has no preservatives, sugar, fat or fillers. It is a mildly spicy brown mustard more similar to European mustards than American deli-style brown mustards. Stadium Mustard is unique in that it is homogeneously brown in color, compared to traditional coarse-ground brown deli mustards, which are typically mottled in appearance and may feature both yellow and brown mustard seeds.

Planka.nu was founded in 2001 by the Swedish Anarcho-syndicalist Youth Federation in response to the increasingly expensive ticket prices in the public transport system in Stockholm. The campaign has received much attention because of the controversial methods used to promote free public transport: Planka.nu encourage people to fare-dodge in the public transport, aiding its members in paying penalty fares through the insurance fund p-kassan.  History  In 2001, the Stockholm chapter of the Swedish Anarcho- syndicalist Youth Federation () launched the campaign Planka.nu (literally, fare-dodge.now) as a reaction to a rise in ticket prices by the Stockholm County Council. The domain name .nu, which belongs to the island of Niue but is sold primarily to foreigners, was chosen because it means \\"now\\" in Swedish. The standard top level domain for Sweden is .se. With growing membership and interest, the campaign was detached from the SUF to form an independent organization. Local organizations have since started up in Gothenburg in 2003, Östergötland in 2005 and Skåne in 2009. A sister organization, pumm.it has been created in Helsinki, Finland. In November 2008, Planka.nu released Freepublictransports.com, a global forum for the free public transport movement. Ticket fares in Stockholm have increased dramatically over time. By one measure--single ticket price for a journey--Stockholm has the most expensive-to-use public transport in the world, as of March 2009.  Activism  Planka.nu demonstrating at the COP15. In the tradition of the Italian autonomists, Planka.nu advocate self-reduction, where the price of the service is determined by the consumer. Whereas in other cases this is done in agreement with (at least some) employees of the service provider, in the case of Planka.nu fare-dodgers are encouraged to evade fares without seeking permission. Since its conception Planka.nu has broadened its methods and now functions as a think tank with public transport, urban planning and climate change as its main areas of focus, as well as an insurance fund. The network also uses standard leftist methods, such as rallies, adbusting, and pamphlets. Together with refugee rights organization Ingen människa är illegal, the Swedish chapter of No one is illegal, Planka.nu provides tickets for immigrants living in Sweden without asylum, since a paperless immigrant might otherwise be reported to the police and deported if caught riding without a ticket.  P-kassan  Failing to purchase a ticket or traveling using an incorrect pass is subject to a penalty fare of 1200 SEK in the public transport systems of Stockholm, Gothenburg and Östergötland. In return for a membership fee (paid monthly or biannually) members are refunded by Planka.nu if fined, through the solidarity fund P-kassan. Net income from p-kassan is used in the aforementioned partnership with No one is illegal and to finance the production of flyers, stickers, folders, web pages and other information material. All members of Planka.nu work pro-bono. In December 2009, Västtrafik accused the Gothenburg chapter of operating an unauthorized insurance.  Criticism  Planka.nu and its organizers have seen substantial criticism, primarily by politicians and transportation companies in each city. The network has been reported to the police for incitement by Storstockholms Lokaltrafik (SL), Västtrafik and ÖstgötaTrafiken, who believe that Planka.nu engages in illegal activities. As of today, no charges have been made. Planka.nu themselves believe that their activities do not conflict with existing legislation. Many critics believe that fare evasion leads to reduced funds and higher costs for public transport, which must be offset by higher prices for those who do pay their fares. In 2004, the Stockholm University Student Union received media attention after first permitting a meeting of the network on its premises and later barring Planka.nu when criticism was voiced.  Publications  Planka.nu has released four larger policy papers: Highway to Hell? criticizing the plans for the express beltway Förbifart Stockholm around Stockholm, Travel Doesn't Have to Cost the Earth proposing a set of measures to make the transport sector in Stockholm more climate-friendly, Till varje pris? (At any cost?) a report about the costs of ticketing in the public transport system in Stockholm, and Trafikmaktsordningen (The Traffic Power Structure) regarding the hierarchies of transportation and how it relates to social mobility and class.

During its last incarnation, it existed alongside two nearby Class D circuits, the Georgia–Florida League and the Georgia–Alabama League. The version of the league began with six teams, but two clubs were forced to disband and a third to relocate before the league folded on July 9. Then, in the Empire State League based in Georgia renamed itself Georgia State League. The six-team 1914 league played a full schedule and crowned a champion, the Americus Muckalees. But the resurgence of the league did not even last two years. The circuit started 1915 as the Georgia State League and was renamed the Florida–Alabama–Georgia League (the \\"FLAG League\\"), which operated in the state of Florida, on June 15. After World War I, the league—again featuring half a dozen member clubs—was revived for two full campaigns. In 1920, it was dominated by legendary minor league slugger Ike Boone, who batted .403 and led the GSL in hits, runs and home runs. The Georgia State League revived in during the post-World War II boom in minor league baseball. It expanded from six to eight teams in , and by had begun to attract working agreements with Major League Baseball farm systems. But as the low minors began to experience falling attendance during the 1950s, the GSL began to suffer. Its Statesboro Pilots club disbanded on July 1, , leaving the league with only five teams. The Georgia State League began and finished the season with a full complement of six teams, but the league did not answer the bell for 1957.

It stars Janet Leigh, Betty Garrett, and Jack Lemmon. The screenplay by Quine and Blake Edwards is based on the 1940 play by Joseph A. Fields and Jerome Chodorov, which was inspired by a series of autobiographical short stories by Ruth McKenney originally published in The New Yorker. The play originally was filmed in 1942. (This musical film is totally different from the 1953 Broadway musical Wonderful Town, though both are based on the original Ruth McKenney source material.) Plot Witty Ruth and pretty Eileen Sherwood, sisters from Columbus, Ohio, relocate to New York City and settle in a rundown basement studio apartment in a Greenwich Village building owned by Papa Appopolous. Ruth aspires to be a writer, while Eileen hopes to achieve success as an actress. They become acquainted with their neighbor Ted Loomis, an athlete who lives with his fiancée Helen. Ruth has a letter of introduction to Bob Baker, editor-in-chief of Mad Hatter magazine. As he rushes off for vacation, he counsels her to write about things she knows rather than the artificial stories she had sent him. Meanwhile, after finding herself the target of unwanted advances from a theatre producer, Eileen goes to the local Walgreens for lunch. Soda fountain manager Frank Lippencott lends her a sympathetic ear and offers his assistance, assuring her many theatrical people eat at the counter. As time progresses, Ruth collects a lot of rejection slips and Eileen fails to secure any auditions. When newspaper reporter Chick Clark overhears Frank telling Eileen about an audition, he claims to know the show's producer and assures her he can get her an interview with him. Upon arrival at the theater, they discover it is a burlesque house where striptease is the main attraction. Mortified, Eileen rushes out. Bob returns from vacation and meets with Ruth to tell her his favorite stories are about Eileen and her romantic misadventures. Ruth claims her sister is simply a product of her imagination and the experiences she described actually are her own. Intrigued, Bob asks her for a date, but Ruth declines, and later tells Eileen she finds him dull and unattractive. Ted asks the girls if he can stay with them while Helen's mother visits and Eileen agrees despite Ruth's uncertainty. Eileen invites Chick and Frank to dinner, but when her spaghetti sauce is ruined by a plumber, Chick suggests they go to El Morocco, where he tells Eileen he will introduce Ruth to his editor, and Ruth sees Bob with a glamorous woman. Bob's secretary is certain Ruth's stories are not as autobiographical as she claims. He invites her to dinner to discuss the publication of a story, and when he tries to kiss her she runs off, suggesting she may be less experienced than her stories suggest. Eileen tells Frank unless Ruth's story is published, the impoverished sisters will have to return to Ohio. Frank is in love with her but, mistakenly thinking Ted lives with the girls, accuses Eileen of being a bohemian and departs. The following day, Ruth receives a phone call asking her to cover the arrival of the Brazilian Navy for the local paper. Unaware it was Chick, who made the call in order to ensure being alone with Eileen, she rushes off. Chick comes to the apartment, and is thrown out by Ted when Eileen needs help fending off the reporter's advances. Helen sees Ted comforting Eileen, and mistakenly assumes the worst. Ruth is pursued by the Brazilian naval cadets, who have misunderstood her intent in meeting their ship. In order to calm them down, Ruth and Eileen initiate a Conga line, which rapidly evolves into a wild dance party in the street that draws the attention of the police, and everyone is arrested. The Brazilian Consul intervenes on their behalf, and the girls return home to pack their belongings. Bob arrives at the apartment, professes his love for Ruth, and tells her he is publishing her stories. Frank arrives with a box of chocolates for Eileen, Ted, and Helen reconcile, and the sisters decide to remain in New York. Cast Production In 1953, Joseph A. Fields and Jerome Chodorov adapted their 1940 play for Wonderful Town, with lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green and music by Leonard Bernstein. Its success on Broadway prompted Harry Cohn, head of Columbia Pictures, which had released the 1942 screen adaptation of the play, to seek the film rights to the musical. When they proved to be too costly, he decided to hire Jule Styne and Leo Robin to write a different score.Garrett, Betty with Rapoport, Ron, Betty Garrett and Other Songs: A Life on Stage and Screen. Lanham, Maryland: Madison Books 1998. , pp. 204-205 Because the film couldn't bear any resemblance to Wonderful Town, a studio attorney was assigned to make sure there were no similarities between the two. Even the musical numbers had to be positioned at different places in the storyline.My Sister Eileen at Turner Classic Movies Screenwriter/director Richard Quine, who had portrayed Frank Lippincott in the 1940 stage play and the 1942 screen adaptation, originally cast Judy Holliday in the role of Ruth Sherwood. When the actress got into a contract dispute with the studio, she was replaced by Betty Garrett, who had been essentially, but not officially, blacklisted due to her marriage to Larry Parks, a one-time member of the Communist Party, who had been forced to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee. As a result, this was Garrett's first screen appearance since On the Town six years earlier.Garrett, pp. 125-152, 203-207 The musical sequences were choreographed by Bob Fosse, who played Frank Lippincott in the film. A little over a year after the film's release, Garrett and Parks replaced Judy Holliday and Sydney Chaplin, respectively, on Broadway for a month in the smash hit Comden-Green-Styne musical Bells Are Ringing. Aldo Ray turned down his part of Ted as being too small and it was given to Dick York, a Columbia contract star.http://www.bewitched.net/filmfax.htm Song list Atmosphere — Chorus As Soon As They See Eileen — Performed by Betty Garrett I'm Great — Performed by Betty Garrett, Janet Leigh, Kurt Kaszner and Dick York There's Nothin' Like Love — Performed by Bob Fosse and Janet Leigh It's Bigger Than You and Me — Performed by Jack Lemmon Give Me a Band and My Baby — Performed by Betty Garrett, Janet Leigh, Bob Fosse and Tommy Rall Conga — Performed by Betty Garrett, Janet Leigh, Kurt Kaszner and the Brazilian Navy Critical reception Bosley Crowther of The New York Times observed, \\"Happily let it be stated that Miss Garrett and Miss Leigh are okay. In fact Miss Garrett is okay in shining letters . . . [She] has the proper skepticism and the right desperation for the role. Her way with a line is homicidal. What's more, she can dance and sing. These are essential talents in this production, in which Miss Leigh . . . is particularly nimble on her legs — and for which Mr. Styne and Mr. Robin have dished up some apt and lively songs . . . But it is Jack Lemmon . . . who generates the most amusement and upholds the tarnished dignity of males. Mr. Lemmon is a charming comedy actor, getting more so in each successive film. And his off-hand maneuvering around Miss Garrett to shatter her resistance is grand.

E. F. Britten, for a 1901 scholarly edition of Tennyson's early works. \\"St Simeon Stylites\\" is a poem written by Alfred Tennyson in 1833 and published in his 1842 collection of poetry. The poem describes the actions of St. Simeon Stylites, a Christian ascetic saint who goes counts his various physical acts in hopes that he has earned his place in heaven. It captures Tennyson's feelings following the death of a close friend, Arthur Hallam, and contains feelings of self-loathing and regret. The work has ironic overtones that give it the appearance of a satirical work. Background In 1833, Tennyson's close friend Arthur Hallam died. He was deeply affected by this death and many of his poems written soon after contained feelings of self- loathing and regret, including \\"St. Simeon Stylites\\".Thorn 1992 pp. 124, 196, 514 The poem also contained a satirical response to religious asceticism in general, which is possibly related to his feelings about his aunt Mary Bourne and her Calvinistic views. \\"St. Simeon Stylites\\" was completed by autumn 1833 and was circulated among Tennyson's fellows at Cambridge University.Hill 1971 p. 66 The poem was later published in his 1842 collection of poetry.Thorn 1992 p. 514 The poem's combination of dark humour, imagery and sympathy for the hero was unique in relationship to the previous works Tennyson published before 1842.Hughes 1988 p. 108 Tennyson, at the end of his life in 1892, returned to the idea and followed \\"St. Simeon Stylites\\" with the poem \\"St. Telemachus\\".Thorn 1992 pp. 124, 196 Poem The full text of the poem is available here. Within the poem, St. Simeon describes himself in excess:Kincaid 1975 p. 48 :Let this avail, just, dreadful, mighty God, :This not be all in vain, that thrice ten years, :Thrice multiplied by superhuman pangs, :In hungers and in thirsts, fevers and cold, :In coughs, aches, stitches, ulcerous throes and cramps, :A sign betwixt the meadow and the cloud, :Patient on this tall pillar I have borne :Rain, wind, frost, heat, hail, damp, and sleet, and snow; (lines 9–16) St. Simeon, with all that he does, still doubts his salvation. While he believes that experiencing pain can be beneficial, he questions if there will be any benefit from his actions: :O Jesus, if thou wilt not save my soul, :Who may be saved? who is it may be saved? :Who may be made a saint, if I fail here? :Show me the man hath suffered more than I. :For did not all thy martyrs die one death? :For either they were stoned, or crucified, :Or burned in fire, or boiled in oil, or sawn :In twain beneath the ribs; but I die here :Today, and whole years long, a life of death. (lines 45–53) As the poem progresses, he reveals that he depends on the number of his actions to verify his deeds: :Then, that I might be more alone with thee, :Three years I lived upon a pillar, high :Six cubits, and three years on one of twelve; :And twice three years I crouched on one that rose :Twenty by measure; last of all, I grew :Twice ten long weary weary years to this, :That numbers forty cubits from the soil. (lines 84–90) Near the poem's end, St. Simeon is filled with confidence that he will experience paradise, but this is followed by doubt that it is only a trick:Kincaid 1975 p. 49 :A flash of light. Is that the angel there :That holds a crown? Come, blessed brother, come. :I know thy glittering face. I waited long; :My brows are ready. What! deny it now? :Nay, draw, draw, draw nigh. So I clutch it. Christ! :'Tis gone: 'tis here again; the crown! the crown! :So now 'tis fitted on and grows to me, :And from it melt the dews of Paradise, :Sweet! sweet! spikenard, and balm, and frankincense. :Ah! let me not be fooled, sweet saints: I trust :That I am whole, and clean, and meet for Heaven. (lines 200–210) The poem concludes with St. Simeon returning to his counting, which is followed by him asking that the reader follows his pattern: :I prophesy that I shall die tonight, :A quarter before twelve. But thou, O Lord, :Aid all this foolish people; let them take :Example, pattern: lead them to thy light. (lines 217–220) Themes \\"St. Simeon Stylites\\" is related to other post- Hallam works like Ulysses as it captures Tennyson's feelings after his friend's death. Later, in In Memoriam, Tennyson would describe his feelings in a broad manner.Thorn 1992 pp. 124 The work has ironic overtones that make it appear as a satirical work. As a whole, the work parodies Christianity that emphasises the egotistical self while also serving as a lamentation of the self. The character of St Simeon is portrayed in a manner that he is comical and disgusting while also being sympathetic. He is also simultaneously an abnormal individual and a normal individual that captures the extremes of human personality while also exhibiting moderate characteristics. At the end of the poem, St Simeon asks that the reader follows his example. His example is one the reader would reject, but it is also one that the reader would recognise as the basic pattern of humanity.Kincaid 1975 pp. 47–49 Tennyson discusses consciousness and personality in \\"St. Simeon Stylites\\". The humour within the poem is not a primary focus in a similar way as Will Waterproof's Lyrical Monologue. Although the poem is very different from the works before 1842, it has some relationship with The Two Voices. The humour and irony is the result of St Simeon trying to deal with his internal self by dealing with his external self. Although he hates his body, his body becomes his representation for being spiritually correct. St. Simeon focuses on the material world, and even religious songs are important only for their sound and not their truth. Even in thinking about his death, he can only think of how his body will be treated. This is surrounded by the poem describing St. Simeon's physical condition in a humorous manner, such as his lack of teeth or him being an old man, instead of being described as a saint.Hughes 1988 pp. 108–110 In relationship of the style of \\"St. Simeon Stylites\\" with the rest of Tennyson's works, James Kincaid declare: \\"Critics often express astonishment that the same mind could produce both 'St. Simeon Stylites' and 'The May Queen'\\".Kincaid 1975 p. 218 As a dramatic monologue, the poem is similar to The Lotos-Eaters, Rizpah and Ulysses, and it is similar to the dramatic monologues of Robert Browning. In terms of the poem's use of irony, it is similar to the \\"Northern Farmer\\" poems. In use of a figure that serves as an auditor of the poem, \\"St. Simeon Stylites\\" is similar to \\"Columbus\\", \\"Despair\\", \\"Tiresias\\", Ulysses and other poems. In the particular use in \\"St Simeon Stylites\\", the auditor is in place to determine who Simeon is directing his conversation to: God or St. Simeon.Hughes 1988 pp. 7, 10, 13, 18 Critical response In response to the 1842 collection of poems, Tennyson's friend James Spedding wrote a review that focused on \\"The Palace of Art\\", \\"St. Simeon Stylites\\", The Two Voices and The Vision of Sin as good works.Thorn 1992 pp. 197–198 Leigh Hunt, in a review for the October 1842 Church and England Quarterly Review, said that the work was an \\"appalling satire on the pseudo-aspirations of egotistical asceticism and superstition\\".Kincaid 1975 qtd p. 47 Another poem about the same subject In the 20th century, Polish poet Stanisław Grochowiak wrote another poem about Tennyson's hero. It is named just the same: St. Simeon Stylites (in Polish Święty Szymon Słupnik). Grochowiak's version is much shorter than Tennyson's dramatic monologue and consists of six four-line stanzas. Two of them are refrains. The metre is amphibrachic. Some lines are four feet long and feminine: × / × × / × × / × × / × Others either two feet or one foot long and masculine: × / × × / or × / Stanzas of the poem contain contrasted images of the saint himself, safe on his column, and crimes committed under it (a young man is hanged and a girl is raped and burnt). In the last stanza the poet says: \\"The Lord chose me / for riot\\". The poet's opinion is probably that a man cannot be saint when he is indifferent to the evil around him.

Of these, significant ancient ruins were present only near the Jagdal in Naogaon district. Excavations under the aegis of Unesco over the past decade have established the site as a Buddhist monastery. History Founding A large number of monasteries or viharas were established in ancient Bengal and Magadha during the four centuries of Pala rule in North-eastern India (756-1174 AD). Dharmapala (781-821) is said to have founded 50 viharas himself,http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Jagaddala_Mahavihara including Vikramashila, the premier university of the era. Jaggadala was founded toward the end of the Pāla dynasty, most likely by Rāmapāla (c. 1077-1120). According to Tibetan sources, five great Mahaviharas stood out: Vikramashila; Nalanda, past its prime but still illustrious, Somapura, Odantapurā, and Jagaddala.Vajrayoginī: Her Visualizations, Rituals & Forms by Elizabeth English.

He is known for his work in materials research, ambient lighting design, house design, and as the creative director of Bocci, a Canadian manufacturing and design company.http://www.vanmag.com/News_and_Features/Inside_Vancouver/Play_with_Omer_Arbel?page=0%2C0 Arbel's designs are numbered in order of creation (1.1 – 79.0 at the time of writing); some have commercial potential and move into production (examples: 14, 16, 22, 28,73) while others remain conceptual or collectible (examples: 2.4, 30, 41, and 71).http://www.vanmag.com/News_and_Features/Inside_Vancouver/Play_with_Omer_Arbel?page=0%2C0 Early life Arbel was born and raised in Jerusalem until age thirteen, when his family relocated to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. As a youth, Arbel enjoyed considerable success as a competitive fencer, making the Canadian Junior National team numerous times and ranking in the top 20 at the Junior World Championships. He received a BSc in environmental science from the University of Waterloo in 1997, and began an apprenticeship with Catalan architect Enric Miralles the following year. Miralles’ death in 2000 brought Arbel back to Canada, where he completed his professional degree in architecture and began working at Patkau Architects in Vancouver.  Industrial Design  Arbel's first serious forays into industrial design emerged from a series of material experiments conducted in a studio occupying the inside of a billboard on the roof of his apartment building in Vancouver.http://www.vanmag.com/News_and_Features/Inside_Vancouver/Play_with_Omer_Arbel?page=0%2C0 One of Arbel's first designs to emerge from that rooftop studio was the 2.4 chair. The chair is composed of approximately 50 layers of coloured resin. Each layer could only be poured during a 15-minute window once every 3.5 hours, amounting to 175 hours of work per chair and many sleepless nights. Given the labour-intensive nature of the 2.4 chair, it was never moved into production; only twenty were made and they reside in private collections and museums around the world. Arbel's experiments often remain conceptual, but he has had some notable commercial success, particularly with glass and lighting design. Arbel's first design to move into production was 14, the basis of which is an illuminated cast-glass sphere with a certain optical quality. The 14 collection was created with an ambient presence as a way to highlight the volume of a room and challenge the traditional role of a chandelier as a static centerpiece.http://www.architonic.com/pmsht/series-14-bocci/1079834 14 helped launch Bocci and Arbel's design practice OAO in 2005 and remains a bestseller.http://www.trevorboddy.ca/articles-in-newspapers/over-the-top-omer- arbel-humanizes-master-of-the-universe-penthouse-cum-showroom/ Bocci's success as a company allowed Arbel to move several more designs into production, notably 22 and 28. 22 is a collection of electrical accessories designed without the visual disruption of a cover plate, allowing outlets and switches to sit flush with their surroundings. Arbel was awarded a Red Dot Award and a Yellow Pencil yearbook entry at the D&AD; awards in 2009 for 22. 28 is a hand- blown glass pendant with interior glass satellites that is available in a multitude of colours. It is created through a complicated technique that involves adding and removing air while heating and cooling a glass matrix. It is emblematic of Arbel's search for “specificity in manufacturing,”http://www.vanmag.com/News_and_Features/Inside_Vancouver/Play_with_Omer_Arbel?page=0%2C0 essentially designing a system that produces form rather than designing the form itself. Arbel received an iF product design award and the Best of Year Award from Interior Design Magazine in 2011 for 28.http://www.superyachtdesign.com/features/618/award-for-boccis-28-series Architecture Arbel launched his own building design practice (OAO) in 2005. Since then he has completed several commercial and residential projects, including 23.2, a freestanding house located in South Surrey, B.C, Canada.http://www.wallpaper.com/architecture/interactive-floor-plan- house-232-vancouver/5065 Arbel's architectural projects reflect his emphasis on materials. For example, 23.2 was designed with triangular geometry to avoid altering the key material of the project: 100-year-old Douglas Fir beams, some 20 metres long and 90 centimetres deep. 23.2 received considerable attention from the design community, and was shortlisted for a World Architecture Award in 2010. Arbel was awarded the Ron Thom Award for Early Design Achievement the same year.http://www.wallpaper.com/architecture/interactive-floor-plan- house-232-vancouver/5065 Other built projects include a penthouse composed of onyx “pods,” a design store centered on rough poured concrete, and a restaurant featuring one of the first installations of 38, a horizontal chandelier made of glass and copper wire. Arbel has been shortlisted for the World Architecture Award three times and continues to explore design at the building scale through the physical properties of building materials.http://www.omerarbel.com/awards-2/ Sculpture While some of Arbel's experiments have been suitable for production, many of his designs serve no clear function or purpose. Some of these experiments have been presented as sculpture in the context of the art gallery. For example, 41.0 was a prototype armature for exhibiting surrealist artwork proposed to the Vancouver Art Gallery in 2010. The armature took shape by coating a chaotic pile of hay bales in sugar beet foam, then removing the bales to reveal an irregular negative space that could house paintings or other artwork.http://www.vanmag.com/News_and_Features/Inside_Vancouver/Play_with_Omer_Arbel?page=0%2C0 That same year Arbel was selected to co-design Canada's 2010 Olympic medals in collaboration with Aboriginal artist Corrine Hunt. His original submission 27.3 included plans for the medals to be held together by invisible magnets, concealing a cavity on the inside where an athlete could store a memento, and having an onsite engraver etch the sounds of the last ten minutes before a medal event onto the medal itself. Financial and practical concerns prevented these plans from being realized, however Arbel's desire to design a system of production that resulted each medal having unique form was preserved.https://bocci.ca/assets/PressPDF/macleansMarch10.pdf In 2015, Arbel had a solo exhibition at the Monte Clark Gallery in Vancouver, B.C. The exhibition featured experiments 30 and 71, both of which have existed for some time but were only recently considered in a sculptural context. 30 is an exploration of glass’ self organizing crystalline structure. Colourful glass rods are fused together at high heat and become faceted geometrical arrangements that slump downwards with the force of gravity. 71 results from steel with a coil of copper wire repeatedly dipped into an electrified nickel- based chemical solution, resulting in the nickel accreting around an electromagnetic field.http://www.monteclarkgallery.com/exhibitions.php?id=454 Special Projects Arbel's work has been selected for large-scale public installations that hover between artwork and industrial design.http://www.vanmag.com/News_and_Features/Inside_Vancouver/Play_with_Omer_Arbel?page=0%2C0 He has had multiple exhibitions at Spazio Rossana Orlandi in Milan, the Art Institute of Chicago, and more recently at the Fairmont Pacific Rim Vancouver, Mallett Antiques, Canada House, and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The 2013 Victoria and Albert Museum exhibit featured 280 of the 28 spheres cascading more than 30 metres from the museum's vaulted ceiling.http://www.dezeen.com/2013/09/13/bocci-28-280-at-the-va/ In 2014, Arbel collaborated with Mallett Antiques to outfit their entire showroom with large installations of his 57 series, 38 series, 19 series and 28 series. The project was intended to create compositional tension through the juxtaposition of modern lighting with antique furnishings. Canada House on Trafalgar Square was reopened in February 2015 with the addition of 157 of Arbel's 57 series light winding down the central staircase.https://vancouversun.com/life/Bocci+Omer+Arbel+lights+look+Canada+House/10884476/story.html On March 5, 2015 Arbel unveiled a large outdoor installation of his new 16 series at Vancouver's Fairmont Pacific Rim Hotel.http://www.wallpaper.com/art/canadian-design-firm-bocci-lights-up-the- vancouver-sky/8578 The Royal Architectural Institute of Canada (RAIC) announced on March 16, 2015 that Arbel would be awarded the Allied Arts Medal for 2015 based on his recent work at the Victoria and Albert Museum.https://raic.org/news/raic-announces-recipient-2015-allied-arts-medal The award is given once every two years to a Canadian artist or designer for outstanding achievement in artwork designed to be integrated with architecture.https://raic.org/news/raic-announces-recipient-2015-allied-arts- medal Arbel is active as a guest critic, speaker and master's thesis committee member at the University of British Columbia School of Architecture.

The village about above sea level is on the northeastern brow of a ridge of hills. The highest point of the ridge is Red Hill, which rises to just south of the village. The 2011 Census recorded Forest Hill with Shotover's population as 856. Manor The toponym is derived from the Old English forst-hyll meaning \\"hill ridge\\". It has no etymological connection with forests. The Domesday Book records that in 1086 William the Conqueror's half-brother Odo, Bishop of Bayeux held Forest Hill. He had two manors, of which Roger d'Ivry held the larger and Ilbert de Lacy held the smaller. The d'Ivry manor changed hands and was divided. By 1242–43 one part had been bestowed upon the Augustinian Chalcombe Priory in Northamptonshire. The other part was bestowed upon the Benedictine Studley Priory, Oxfordshire. Both priories retained their respective holdings until the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century. Ilbert de Lacy also held the manor in the adjacent parish of Stanton St. John. In about 1100 de Lacy's son forfeited both manors, and his holding at Forest Hill passed to Robert D'Oyly. D'Oyly gave the tenancy to one Hugh de Tew, but after Osney Abbey was founded in 1129 de Tew gave the tenancy to the Abbey. In 1526 the de Lacy manor was granted to Cardinal Thomas Wolsey for his new college at Oxford, but in 1529 King Henry VIII stripped Wolsey of his office and all his property. After the dissolution of the monasteries each of the Forest Hill estates quickly passed through the hands of owners who may have bought and sold former monastic lands as speculative investments. Then Sir John Brome, lord of Holton, bought and reunited the estates: the two parts of the de Lacy estate in 1544 and the d'Ivry estate in 1545. The Forest Hill estate remained in the Brome family for four generations but fell into debt, was mortgaged twice in the 1620s and finally was sold in 1630. From 1621 the house had been let out, and the second mortgage was a loan of £500 from the tenant to the Bromes. Lincoln College, Oxford bought the Forest Hill estate in 1807. It remained in the college's ownership until 1953. The age of the original manor house is unknown. It was garrisoned in the early years of the English Civil War by Royalist troops, later supplanted by Parliamentarian forces that occupied Forest Hill. In 1643 the poet John Milton stayed at the house, where he courted the daughter of the family, 16-year-old Mary Powell. The Scots poet William Julius Mickle (1735–88) lodged at the manor house 1771-75. Here he translated the Portuguese epic poem the Lusiad by Luís de Camões. In 1781 he married the daughter of the house, Mary Tomkins, and settled in Wheatley. Mickle and his wife are buried in St Nicholas' churchyard. Despite the manor house's rich history, in 1854 Lincoln College demolished it and re-used the stones to build a new house on the site. Churches The Church of England parish church of Saint Nicholas the Confessor may have begun as a chapel, but by 1341 Forest Hill was a separate parish and St Nicholas' was being referred to as an (\\"parish church\\"). It was given to Osney Abbey in about 1140. When the de Lacy manor was granted to Cardinal Wolsey in 1526, St Nicholas' church was included. Thereafter the advowson of the parish remained with whoever owned the manor. In 1807 Lincoln College, Oxford bought the estate, including the manor house and St Nicholas' church. St Nicholas' church building is Norman, and the 12th century chancel arch is probably original. The church was rebuilt in the 13th century in the transitional style from Norman architecture to the Early English Gothic style: the lancet windows on both sides of the chancel and the gabled bellcote at the west end of the nave date from this rebuilding. Later the present west window was added in the Perpendicular Gothic style. In the same period a south porch was built. Its inner door is Perpendicular, but the outer is transitional between Norman and Early English and has been re-set, presumably from where the Perpendicular doorway is now. In 1639 buttresses were built against the west wall to support the bellcote. The bellcote has two bells, cast in 1652. In 1847 the architect James Cranston restored the chancel. The Oxford architectural writer and publisher J.H. Parker designed the east window of three traceried lancets. In 1852 the Gothic Revival architect George Gilbert Scott restored the nave and added the organ chamber and north aisle, re-setting the original transitional style north doorway in the new wall. A Sanctus bell was cast and hung at the same time as the restoration. A Wesleyan congregation was established in Forest Hill in the 19th century. It originally had a wooden chapel, but in 1898 opened a new brick-built one. Economic history The White Horse public house The parish has had a watermill since the 13th century, when land was granted to Osney Abbey in 1221 and 1229 to build one on Bayswater Brook. The present Bayswater Mill at the west end of the parish, just north of Sandhills, is mainly 18th- century. Forest Hill was a separate civil parish until 1881, when it was merged with Shotover.

It is a frame house built near the end of the 19th century. It is in the \\"Free Classical\\" mode of the Queen Anne architectural style, representing the period of transition from that style to the Colonial Revival style popular early in the 20th century. In 2002 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Building The house is located on the west side of the street a short distance south of the Manor Avenue intersection in a residential neighborhood north of uptown Kingston. Across the street is the stone house at 322 Albany Avenue. It is on a narrow () lot that backs on woodlands that buffer Esopus Creek. It is a two-and-a- half-story structure on a stone foundation. Siding is clapboard on the first story and wood shingles on the second. Atop is a steeply pitched gable roof. The east (front) facade has two sections. The south one has a wraparound porch with fluted Ionic columns supporting a plain entablature. On the north is a bay window with a frieze decorated in neoclassical swag. On the second story the facade presents two sets of windows, a pair on the south and three on the north. The shingles flare slightly above a belt course. On the third story, above a pent roof, there is imbrication and a finely detailed Palladian window. The south profile has a projecting central bay with hipped roof. Its diverse fenestration includes a band of four leaded windows and an oculus with keyed frame. On the porch side it features a three-part window with segmented arch light. On the north is a bay window similar to the one on the east, supporting a bumpout on the story above with another three-part window. Another small porch shelters an entrance on the west, and there is an inset entry on the southwest corner. The first floow layout is a modified side-hall plan. The main entrance opens into a vestibule with a staircase featuring finely carved balusters and polished paneling. An archway supported by columns leads into the main parlor opposite the stair. Pocket doors separate the main space from the dining room. In the southwest corner of the rear parlor is a Queen Anne fireplace and mantel. Many other finishes remain on the first floor, such as the wood molding, wall plaster, architraves and wooden parquet floor. The second story has also kept most of its original plan and finish. A garage behind the house has many similar elements. It is of modern construction and thus non-contributing to the National Register listing. History and aesthetics The house is recorded as having been built by a Mr. Hutton in 1896. At that time the Queen Anne style, based on the look of early 18th-century English vernacular architecture in which medieval buildings were updated with generous ornament, was maturing. Architects were beginning to add classically inspired ornaments, such as the porch columns and Palladian window on 313 Albany Avenue, to the Queen Anne vocabulary. This era, right before the turn of the 20th century, was known as the Queen Anne's \\"Free Classical\\" phase. Early in the new century this would lead to a more purely Georgian- inspired style, which eventually matured into the Colonial Revival. Since its construction, 313 Albany Avenue has seen only one significant alteration, the removal of a wall between two parlors on the first floor during the 20th century in order to create a larger space. It has remained a private residence.

It is situated to the southeast of the county seat of Benjamin, north of Munday and north of Abilene. Climate According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Rhineland enjoys a semi-arid climate, abbreviated \\"BSk\\" on climate maps.Climate Summary for Rhineland, Texas History The community was officially established on February 1, 1895, when the land contract between J.C. League and German-born Catholics – Father Joseph R. Reisdorff and Hugh Herchenbach – was notarized. The plot was advertised as a colony for German Catholics and was named after the Rhineland region in Germany. The first land sold was to John Bruckner at $8 an acre. John bought around 160 acres, but had 8,000 acres to choose from. The land he chose sits near the corner of FM 267 and CR 4260. The Rhineland Common School District was organized in 1898 with the first schoolhouse being built the following year. A larger, brick school building was constructed in 1926 that provided public education through high school. A number of students attended a local parochial school. By 1950, Rhineland has approximately 75 residents. Over the years, the community experienced a slight rise in population, but the number of businesses declined. Rhineland's school district would later consolidate with nearby Munday. In 1980, the estimated number of inhabitants in Rhineland was 196. That figure had fallen to 100 by 2000.

Art work In her first published creative work as young illustrator, she contributed at age 15 to ‘L’Ogresse’ (Edition Maspero, Paris, 1975) and fully illustrated ‘Le Nuage Amoureux’ at age 18 (Edition Maspero, Paris, 1978). Al Khemir's drawings have been used as illustrations or as designs for book covers of well-known authors such as Respected Sir by the Nobel Prize–winning author Naguib Mahfouz. Most are executed in pen and ink where the precision and command of line and the tiny marks of pen point juxtapose the freely expressed world of the story. She has created worlds that reflect the timeless nature of various stories, often classic Islamic tales. Her style alludes to historic Islamic illustration but is totally modern. They are humorous and idiosyncratic. Her best-known illustrative work is \\"The Island of Animals,\\" Quartet, London and the University of Texas Press (April 1994). ().

Alluvial rivers are self-formed, meaning that their channels are shaped by the magnitude and frequency of the floods that they experience, and the ability of these floods to erode, deposit, and transport sediment. For this reason, alluvial rivers can assume a number of forms based on the properties of their banks; the flows they experience; the local riparian ecology; and the amount, size, and type of sediment that they carry.Leopold, Luna B., Wolman, M.G., and Miller, J.P., 1964, Fluvial Processes in Geomorphology, San Francisco, W.H. Freeman and Co., 522p.  Alluvial channel patterns  Natural alluvial channels have a variety of morphological patterns, but can be generally described as straight, meandering, braided, or anastomosing.Bierman, R. B, David R. Montgomery (2014). Key Concepts in Geomorphology. W. H. Freeman and Company Publishers. United States. Different channel patterns result from differences in bankfull discharge, gradient, sediment supply, and bank material. Channel patterns can be described based on their level of sinuosity, which is the ratio of the channel length measured along its center to the straight line distance measured down the valley axis.  Straight/sinuous channels  Straight channels (sinuosity <1.3) are relatively rare in natural systems due to the fact that sediment and flow are rarely distributed evenly across a landscape. Irregularities in the deposition and erosion of sediments leads to the formation of alternate bars that are on opposite sides of the channel in succession. Alternating bar sequences result in flow to be directed in a sinuous pattern, leading to the formation of sinuous channels (sinuosity of 1.3-1.5).  Meandering channels  Meandering channels are more sinuous (>1.5 sinuosity) than straight or sinuous channels, and are defined by the meander wavelength morphological unit. The meander wavelength is the distance from the apex of one bend to the next on the same side of the channel. Meandering channels wavelength are described in section 1.2 Geomorphic Units. Meandering channels are widespread in current times, but no geomorphic evidence of their existence before the evolution of land plants has been found. This is largely attributed to the effect of vegetation in increasing bank stability and maintaining meander formation.  Braided channels  Braided channels are characterized by multiple, active streams within a broad, low sinuosity channel. The smaller strands of streams diverge around sediment bars and then converge in a braiding pattern. Braided channels are dynamic, with strands moving within the channel. Braided channels are caused by sediment loads that exceed the capacity of stream transport. They are found downstream of glaciers and mountain slopes in conditions of high slope, variable discharge, and high loads of coarse sediment.  Anastomosing channels  Anastomosing channels are similar to braided channels in that they are composed of complex strands that diverge and then converge downstream. However, anastomosing channels are distinct from braided channels in that they flow around relatively stable, typically vegetated islands. They also have generally lower gradients, are narrower and deeper, and have more permanent strands.  Geomorphic units   Meander wavelength  The meander wavelength or alternate bar sequence is considered the primary ecological and morphological unit of meandering alluvial rivers.Trush et al. (2000). Attributes of an Alluvial River and their Relation to Water Policy and Management. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Vol 92. No. 22 The meander wavelength is composed of two alternating bar units, each with a pool scoured out from a cutbank, an aggradational lobe or point bar, and a riffle that connects the pool and point bar. In an idealized channel, the meander wavelength is around 10 to 11 channel widths. This equates to pools (and riffles and point bars) being separated by an average of 5 to 6 channel widths. The radius of curvature of a meander bend describes the tightness of a meander arc, and is measured by the radius of a circle that fits the meander arc. The radius of curvature is between 2 and 3 times the channel width.  Landforms   Floodplains  Floodplains are the land areas adjacent to alluvial river channels that are frequently flooded. Floodplains are built up by deposition of suspended load from overbank flow, bedload deposition from lateral river migration, and landscape processes such as landslides.  Natural levees  Natural levees occur when the floodplain of an alluvial river is primarily shaped by overbank deposition and when relatively coarse materials are deposited near the main channel. The natural levees become higher than the adjacent floodplain, leading to the formation of backswamps and yazoo channels, in which tributary streams are forced to flow parallel to the main channel rather than converge with the main channel.  Terraces  Terraces are sediment storage features that record an alluvial river's past sediment delivery. Many changes in boundary conditions can form terraces in alluvial river systems. The most basic reason for their formation is that the river does not have the transport capacity to move the sediment supplied to it by its watershed. Past climate during the Quaternary has been linked to the aggradation and incision of floodplains, leaving step-like terrace features behind. Uplift as well as sea level retreat can also cause terraces to form as the river cuts into its underlying bed and preserves sediment in its floodplain.  Geomorphic processes   Natural hydrograph components  Natural hydrograph components such as storm events (floods), baseflows, snowmelt peaks, and recession limbs, are the river-specific catalysts that shape alluvial river ecosystems and provide for important geomorphic and ecological processes. Preserving annual variations in a river's hydrologic regime – patterns of magnitude, duration, frequency, and timing of flows- are essential for sustaining ecological integrity within alluvial river ecosystems.  Channel migration  Bank erosion at cutbanks on the outside of meanders combined with deposition of point bars on the inside of meanders cause channel migration. The greatest bank erosion often occurs just downstream of the meander apex, causing downstream migration as the high velocity flow eats away at the bank as it is forced around the meander curve. Avulsion is another process of channel migration that occurs much more rapidly than the gradual migration process of cutbank erosion and point bar deposition. Avulsion occurs when lateral migration causes two meanders to become so close that the river bank between them is breached, causing the joining of the meanders and the creation of two channels. When the original channel is cut off from the new channel by the deposition of sediments, oxbow lakes are formed. Channel migration is important to sustaining diverse aquatic and riparian habitats The migration causes sediments and woody debris to enter the river, and creates areas of new floodplain on the inside of the meander.  Sediment budgets  Dynamic steady states of sediment erosion and deposition work to sustain alluvial channel morphology, as river reaches import and export fine and coarse sediments at approximately equal rates. At the apex of meander curves, high velocity flows scour out sediment and form pools. The mobilized sediment is then deposited at the point bar directly across the channel or downstream. Flows of high magnitude and duration can be seen as important thresholds that drive channelbed mobility. Channel aggradation or degradation indicate sediment budget imbalances.  Flooding  Flooding is an important component that shapes channel morphology in alluvial river systems. Large floods that exceed the 10 to 20 year recurrence interval form and maintain main channels as well as avulse and form side channels, wetlands, and oxbow lakes. Floodplain inundation occurs on average every 1–2 years at flows above bankfull stage and moderates flood severity and channel scour and helps to cycle nutrients between the river and surrounding landscape. Flooding is important to aquatic and riparian habitat complexity because it forms a diversity of habitat features that vary in their ecosystem function.  Biologic components   Riparian habitats  Riparian habitats are especially dynamic in alluvial river ecosystems due to the constantly changing fluvial environment. Alternate bar scour, channel migration, floodplain inundation, and channel avulsion create variable habitat conditions that riparian vegetation must adapt to. Seedling establishment and forest stand development depend on favorable substrate, which in turn is dependent on how sediment is sorted along the channel banks. In general, young riparian vegetation and pioneer species will establish in areas that are subjected to active channel processes such as at point bars, where coarser sediments such as gravels and cobbles are present but are seasonally mobilized. Mature riparian vegetation can establish farther upslope where finer sediments such as sands and silts dominate and disturbance from active river processes are less frequent.  Aquatic habitats  Aquatic habitats in alluvial rivers are sculpted by the complex interplay between sediment, flow, vegetation, and woody debris. Pools provide deeper areas of relatively cool water and provide shelter for fish and other aquatic organisms. Pool habitats are improved by complex structures such as large woody debris or boulders. Riffles provide shallower, highly turbulent aquatic habitat of primarily cobbles. Here, water mixes with the air at the water surface, increasing dissolved oxygen levels within the stream. Benthic macroinvertebrates thrive in riffles, living on the surfaces and interstitial spaces between rocks. Many species also depend on low energy backwater areas for feeding and important life cycle stages.  Human impacts   Land use impacts   Logging  Logging of timberland in alluvial watersheds has been shown to increase sediment yields to rivers, causing aggradation of the streambed, increasing turbidity, and altering sediment size and sediment distribution along the channel. The increase in sediment yield is attributed to increased runoff and erosion and slope failure, a result of removing vegetation from the landscape as well as building roads.  Agriculture  Agricultural land uses divert water from alluvial rivers for crop production, as well constrain the river's ability to meander or migrate due levee construction or other forms of armoring. The result is simplified channel morphology with lower baseflows.  Dams and diversions  Dams and diversions alter the natural hydrologic regime of rivers, with widespread effects that alter the watershed ecosystem.Poff, N. L., Allan, J. D., Bain, M. B., Karr, J. R., Prestegaard, K. L., Richter, B. D., Stromberg, J. C. (1997). The Natural Flow Regime. BioScience, 47(11), 769–784. http://doi.org/10.2307/1313099 Since alluvial river morphology and fluvial ecosystem processes are largely shaped by the complex interplay of hydrograph components such as the magnitude, frequency, duration, timing, and rate of change of flow, any change in one of these components can be associated with a tangible alteration of the ecosystem. Dams are often associated with reduced wet season flood magnitudes and altered (oftentimes reduced) dry season baseflow. This can negatively affect aquatic organisms that are specifically evolved to natural flow conditions. By altering the natural hydrograph components, particularly reducing flow magnitudes, dams and other diversions reduce the river's ability to mobilize sediment, resulting in sediment-choked channels.Kondolf, M. G. (1997) Hungry Water: Effects of Dams and Gravel Mining on River Channels. Environmental Management Vol. 21, No. 4, pp. 533–551 Conversely, dams are a physical barrier to the naturally continuous movement of sediment from headwaters to the river mouth, and can create sediment deficient conditions and incision directly downstream.

However, most bedrock rivers are not pure forms; they are a combination of a bedrock channel and an alluvial channel. The way one can distinguish between bedrock rivers and alluvial rivers is through the extent of sediment cover.''' The extent of sediment coverage is based upon the sediment flux supplied to the channel and the channel transport capacity. Bedrock rivers are typically found in upland or mountainous regions. Their formation can have several erosional factors. Bedrock rivers are also one of the only ways to study incision into bedrock that is not related to glaciers. Forming and erosion Bedrock incision can be caused by tectonic plate movement. As the land is uplifted the river is forced to incise into the bedrock to keep flowing. Incision can be carried out through a variety of erosional processes. The type of bedrock may change as a river flows downstream, affecting erosional processes. The main processes being: stream power, abrasion, quarrying, wedging, and dissolution. These rivers are a combination of all of these processes but are dependent upon the individual river and its type of bedrock. Stream power Stream power is the process energy from the water converted into kinetic energy due to the steepening in slope. When water is being transported down a channel, it is doing so by gravitational potential energy. Due to the laws of conservation of energy, energy that is lost traveling downstream must be transformed into another type of energy. The energy form that is it transformed into is the kinetic energy of the water beating on the bedrock. The rate of the potential energy loss is calculated in the stream power of the river. The stream power equation is: \\\\Omega = \\\\mathrm{\\\\rho{}gQS} :where: ::\\\\Omega = stream power ::\\\\rho = water density ::g = gravitational constant ::Q = hydraulic discharge of the stream (m3/s) ::S = slope of the channel This equation suggests that stream power might be the single most important factor in bedrock incision. In an alluvial river the stream power would be more of a transport because it would be picking up loose material and depositing it, but with a constant influx of sediment it would not be incising. Abrasion Abrasion is the process by which sediments are transported in the flow. The rate of erosion done using abrasion is affected by the strength of the bedrock. Abrasion is also affected by the amount of sediment load present in the river. Too much sediment and most of the particles will not have enough energy; too little and not enough of the particles will come into contact with the bed. The process can erode individual grains, or flakes from the rocks surface. The most common indicators of abrasion is potholes in the bedrock or a trough-like shape to the river. There are three types of sediment transport in a fluvial process: dissolved load, suspended load, and bed load. The process that most affects a bedrock river is the suspended load. Suspended load is the grains that are light enough to be carried in the water and do not contact the bed of the river unless there is an obstruction or topographic change in the bed. The way these particles erode a bedrock river is by contact with these obstructions. Being as they are carried as part of the river flow they have a significantly higher kinetic energy and coming into contact with an abnormality in the river bed can cause more damage than a larger grain with lower energy. The grain size that is normally held in the suspended load ranges from very fine to fine; clays and silts. Bedload erosion can also be a major factor in bedrock erosion. It is caused by saltating grains or traction. Saltating is where the grains are lifted up by the water and then tossed back down. Most of the time this is with gravels and if the stream power is big enough pebbles. However the clays and silts have too much cohesion to be transported by this method. When the particles come into contact with the bedrock they slowly wear away at its surface. They can gradually form micro-cracks or extend already existing cracks. The physics behind this erosional process states: the mass of the rock worn away by the incoming particle is directly proportional to the kinetic energy of that incoming particle. Traction is where the sediment is too large to be picked up in the river flow but is small enough to be pushed or rolled along at a slower rate. Traction is covered in quarrying. Quarrying Quarrying (also known as plucking) is the process by which a chunk of the bedrock must be somehow removed from the bed of the river and then forced along the planar surface of the riverbed. This process is the most similar to glacial erosion. It is most effective in rivers where the jointing is close enough to allow the blocks to be moved by river flow. The process of removing the piece of bedrock can be caused by many different factors. A crack or a flex in the bedrock will initially make a disconnected piece of the bedrock. Then, either by hydraulic wedging or frost-cracking the block can be forced out. If the bedrock is already highly jointed, fractured or a bedding plane it will be easier for the chunk to be removed. Highly jointed or bedding plane bedrock can make it easier for the blocks to be lifted or shifted out of their position. Scientists believe that this happens because of the weathering of joints surfaces. Subsequently, the joints are wedged apart and might be weakened by being bombarded by bedload particles. Once the block of bedrock is removed it must then be pushed along the bed of the river. In order for this to happen the shear stress of the river on the top of the rock must exceed the frictional forces on the bottom of the rock. The blocks will eventually erode, but will cause headward erosion of the river while it exists. Wedging Wedging is the process by which small cracks appear in the bed of the river which are enlarged by smaller particles. It can cause large blocks of the river to be removed from the bed starting the quarrying process. The initial cracks appear due to a flux in the bedrock itself which is caused by a \\"rapid and large pressure variation\\". These can be caused by mass movements, or heavy storms. After the initial crack is made a small amount of sediment, sometimes no more than a grain, is passively deposited in the crack. When the bedrock flexes back into its original position the crack is left open due to the wedging. Gradually as more sediment accumulates in the crack it will widen and deepen. This is more common in an already jointed river bed. Dissolution Dissolution is the process by which the downstream change in the solute concentration is controlled by the dissolution rate of the rock. This process typically only affects a bedrock river when the rock is already prone to dissolution, such as a sandstone. One would be most likely to see this in caves made up of carbonate rocks. Some other factors that this process is dependent on are \\"the ratio of mineral surface are to water volume, the degree of chemical under-saturation, and the time it takes a water parcel to move through a reach.\\" It is one of the least likely forms of incision but it does play a role in the process. Transport and deposition Bedrock rivers are by definition bedrock, however that does not limit them from transporting all types of sediment and having sediment patches along its bed. The reason it is more likely to be a patch, rather than individual grains is that the grains are more likely to settle where the grain stability is increased. Grain stability is increased where the bedrock is rougher and where there is less kinetic energy in the water. Even though grains can be deposited in bedrock rivers most of the time they will be transported through a bedrock section of a river to a more alluvial section of the river. The cohesion between particles will make it easier for them to be deposited in a patch as well. With nothing to hold the particles down in the bedrock section the particles will continually be picked up by the river and carried further downstream. This will develop in the form of \\"alluvial bed forms or bars\\". The deeper and wider the river is the more likely it is for grains to be deposited along the bed of the river. However this is also dependent on the slope and inflow of water.

It was constructed in 1858–1860 during the French Second Empire by the architect Gabriel Davioud. It has been listed since 1926 as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture. Fontaine Saint-Michel  History  The fontaine Saint-Michel was part of the great project for the reconstruction of Paris overseen by Baron Haussmann during the French Second Empire. In 1855 Haussmann completed an enormous new boulevard, originally called boulevard de Sébastopol-rive-gauche, now called Boulevard Saint-Michel, which opened up the small place Pont-Saint-Michel into a much larger space. Haussmann asked the architect of the service of promenades and plantations of the prefecture, Gabriel Davioud, to design a fountain which would be appropriate in scale to the new square. As the architect of the prefecture, he was able to design not only the fountain but also the facades of the new buildings around it, giving coherence to the square, but he also had to deal with the demands of the prefet and city administration, which was paying for the project. Davioud's original project was for a fountain dedicated to peace, located in the center of the square. The prefect authorities rejected this idea and asked him instead to build a fountain to hide the end wall of the building at the corner of boulevard Saint-Michel and Saint-André des Arts. This forced Davioud to adapt his plan to the proportions of that building. The next design made by Davioud in 1856 provided the architectural structure of the fountain; a facade divided into four horizontal levels, similar to a triumphal arch, with four Corinthian columns on high socles framing the central niche. The main cornice is surmounted by a French Renaissance design feature, an inscribed tablet in a grand architectural framing. As the revised site was just off the axis of the bridge, Davioud created a visual compromise in a series of shallow bowed basins through which the water issuing from the rock under the supine body of Saint Michael's adversary spills. The water ends in a basin sunk into street level, with a curving front edge that softens the line of the monument's architectural base. In the 1856 plan, Davioud placed a feminine statue of Peace into the central niche. The 1858 plan called for replacing Peace with a statue of Napoleon Bonaparte. This provoked furious opposition from the opponents of Napoleon III, so later in 1858 Davioud proposed that the central figure be the Archangel Michael wrestling with the devil. This was agreed, construction began in June 1858, and the statue was inaugurated on August 15, 1860.Dominique Jarassé, La fontaine Saint-Michel, Le classicism controversé, Archives d'architecture moderne, 1982, number 22, pgs. 80-87. In September 1870, after the capture of Emperor Napoleon III by the Germans during the French-German War and his abdication, the fountain was threatened by a mob. On September 5, Davioud wrote an urgent letter to the Director of the Municipal Service of Promenades and Plantations: \\"A crowd of unarmed workers have just come to the Fontaine Saint-Michel..they apparently want to attack the fountain and want to deface the eagles and inscriptions on the upper part. What should I do?\\"From the Archives of Paris, PJ 19, dossier 6, cited in Beatrice Lamoitier, pg 196. The fountain, along with other symbols of the Second Empire, was apparently attacked and damaged by mobs during the 1871 uprising and suppression of the Paris Commune. In 1872, Davioud was authorized by the Prefecture to make urgent repairs to the fountain.Archives of Paris, VM, 92/2. Cited in Beatrice Lamoitier. It was restored again in 1893.  The Decoration of the Fountain  Davioud was himself a trained neoclassical sculptor from the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, and the large scale (26 meters by 15 meters) and the elaborate iconography he created for the fountain required the work of nine different sculptors. It features: *Two winged dragons on either side of the fountain by Henri Alfred Jacquemart. *The figure of Saint Michael and the devil by Francisque-Joseph Duret *The rock under Saint Michael by Félix Saupin *Bas-reliefs and ornamental foliage by Marie-Noémi Cadiot Four statues representing the cardinal virtues: *Statue of Prudence, holding a serpent and a mirror, by Jean-Auguste Barre *Statue of Power, with a lion skin and club, by Claude-Jean Guillaume *Statue of Justice, with a scale and sword, by Louis- Valentin Robert *Statue of Temperance, by Charles-Alphonse Guméry *Statues of Power and Moderation, holding the coat of arms of Paris, by Auguste-Hyacinthe Debay The fountain was different from most other Paris fountains because it used different colors of stone; columns of red marble from Languedoc; green marble; blue stone from Soignies; yellow stone from Saint-Yllie; and bronze statues.Beatrice Lamoitier, \\"Le règne de Davioud\\" in Paris et ses fontaines, pg. 184.  Critical reaction  The critical reaction to the fountain when it was opened in 1860 was divided. Much attention was given to the different colors: The critic of Le Monde Illustré wrote: \\"the monument constitutes, in sum, a venture into polychrome architecture such as one can see in Rome, where fountains of the same style were created by artists of the 18th century.\\"François Lacour, Fontaine Saint-Michel, Le Monde Illustré, May 8, 1858, pg. 295. translation by D.R. Siefkin. The critic Alfred Darcel in Gazette des Beaux-Arts was less enthusiastic: he condemned the fountain for its choice of colors, its composition, what he called its incoherent style and iconography, and because, in his view, the concentration of so many different statues by different artists nullified the individual talents of the artists.Alfred Darcel and Charles Blanc, \\"La fontaine Saint-Michel\\" Gazette des Beaux-Arts, October 1860, volume VIII, pg. 44 and 45. Cited in Beatrice Lamoitier, \\"Le règne de Davioud\\", in Paris et ses fontaines, pg. 184. Other critics condemned the statue for its placement against a wall, instead of in the center of the Square. It was, said one, \\"a placement frequent in Paris, but vicious for monuments of this grandiose style.\\"A.J. du Pays, \\"Fontaine Saint-Michel\\", in L'Illustration, August 18, 1860, volume XXXVI, pg. 110. Translation by D.R. Siefkin. The Fontaine Saint-Michel was the last monumental wall fountain built in Paris, the end of a traditional Renaissance style which had begun with the Medici Fountain in the 17th century and continued with the Fontaine des Quatre-Saisons in the 18th century. The later monumental fountains in Paris were all free-standing, in the centers of squares or parks.

History  It was built in the 1930s near the village of Borgo Rizzo and used by Axis forces as a base for the Italian Regia Aeronautica. During the Sicilian Campaign it was seized by elements of the United States Fifth Army. Once in Allied hands, it was used by the United States Army Air Force Twelfth Air Force 316th Troop Carrier Group, which flew C-47 Skytrains from the field between 18 October 1943 and 12 February 1944. When the Americans pulled out the airfield was handed back to the Italians that rebuilt the airport in 1949. The airport operated military and commercial flights until 1961 when the new Trapani–Birgi Airport was opened. It was finally abandoned in 1971 by the Italian Air Force and closed. Today the only remaining pieces of the airport are the runway, the control tower and a few smaller buildings. The name  The Italians called the airport Trapani–Chinisia after the nearby river Chinisia but the allies used on their planes the name of the nearby village of Borgo Rizzo that was abbreviated on the documents as Borizzo.

Club home colours are all blue Rhydymwyn Football Club on Football Association of WalesRhydymwyn Football Club on Welsh Alliance League while away colours are red shirts, white shorts and white socks. History Rhydymwyn Football Club was founded in 1911. They came into existence, playing in local soccer, in the old Halkyn and Clwyd Leagues. They would remain in these leagues until moving up to the Welsh Alliance League in 1990. They immediately consolidated their progress by finishing fourth in their first season, and also reaching the final of the Cookson Cup. Their second campaign saw them finish in sixth place, and also reach the final of the North Wales Coast FA Challenge Cup, where they lost 2-1 to the then HFS Loans League side, Colwyn Bay. They finished fourth again in 1993, and also won the Alves Cup. The following year saw them third on goal difference, after a three-way tie with Llangefni Town and Llanfairpll. The 1994/95 season saw them capture the Welsh Alliance League title, and gain promotion to the Cymru Alliance League]. They also won the FAW Trophy, beating Taffs Wells 1-0 in the final played at Caersws. The 1995/96 season saw them finish a respectable fifth in the Cymru Alliance League. They also retained the FAW Trophy, beating Penrhyncoch at Newtown. 1996/97 saw them finish second in the league behind Rhayader Town, before taking the title in the 1997/98 season. Various reasons prevented the club from being promoted to the League of Wales. The club has progressed, not only on the field but off it as well. They obtained a £75,000 pavilion funded by Delyn Borough Council, and also received a £26,000 Sport Lot Award to extend their function room. Much of their progress was down to then manager Ken Knowles and a committee made up of committed local people. When Ken Knowles decided to retire after eleven seasons in charge, the club decided to appoint a player/manager from within their ranks. Unfortunately, the plan backfired, and the club had to resign from the Cymru Alliance League, due mainly to a lack of players. After returning to the Welsh Alliance League, the club was successful again. In the 2003/04 season they reached the finals of both the Barritt and Cookson Cups. They won the Cookson Cup but narrowly lost the Barritt Cup, under the caretaker manager, Phil Eaton. The following season saw them strongly contest the league championship, only to lose by one point to eventual champions, Bodedern. They also reached the final of the FAW Trophy, losing 3 - 1 to Swansea-based side West End at Rhayader. Since those successes, the club struggled under a different manager, with mid-table finishes within the Welsh Alliance. Success returned to the club in the 2007/08 season when they defeated Barmouth and Dyffyn United to win the Barritt Cup for the first time at Farrar Road, Bangor. The 2008/09 season saw a big improvement in the Welsh Alliance when they finished runners-up behind Bethesda Athletic. The momentum continued in 2009/10 season and the club stayed in pole position, winning eight out of the first nine games winning promotion back to the Huws Gray Alliance with an overall record of 21 wins, 4 draws and only 5 defeats. In that first season back in the Huws Gray Alliance things didn't go to plan and at the end of the season the club dropped out of the Huws Gray Alliance with just 18 points, finishing in 14th position. The club found themselves back in the third tier of Welsh football but this time in the Welsh National League rather than the Welsh Alliance due to new boundary changes coming into force. The club also decided to appoint Daniel Seamarks as their new manager and it was his task to rebuild the team and fortunes. In that first season Rhydymwyn finished in a highly respectful second position and they were able to gain promotion back to the Huws Gray Alliance as champions FC Cefn chose to withdraw their application for Promotion. So in season 2012-13 the see saw affect continued with Rhydymwyn back in the Huws Gray alliance. Rhydymwyn secured 28 points that season and ended up finishing in 14th position. This time the club knew that they would be safe as only 2 clubs were going to gain promotion and Rhyl were going to be promoted to the Welsh Premier as champions of the Huws Gray Alliance. Rhydymwyn had been higher up the table earlier in the season and their league position slipped as security was guaranteed. Rhydymwyn have now got the task of building on that and will be looking to move further up the table in season 2013-14 despite limited resources and funds. 2014-15 was a sad season in the history of Rhydymwyn because of unforeseen circumstances they were not able to raise a team, and the team folded. In 2016 the club reformed and entered the Welsh National League (Wrexham Area).

For the purposes of administration Eastwell is part of the civil parish of Eaton that, in turn, forms part of the borough of Melton. Eastwell lost its own civil parish status in 1936. Its population in 1931 was recorded as 152;Vision of Britain - detail the 1851 census had recorded 158 so the village had not suffered the rural depopulation seen elsewhere. Further back in time: Eastwell Church (St Michael) is built of ironstone. It dates mostly from the thirteenth century. From the early 14th century to the mid 16th century, Eastwell was the seat of one branch of the Brabazon family. The Hall is a Grade II* listed building It dates from 1634 but has windows and a front door altered in the nineteenth century.Buildings of England:Leicestershire and Rutland, Pevsner and Williamson.Page 148-9 A new Eastwell Village Hall is being built. It is scheduled for a mid-April opening.  Iron Ore quarrying  One factor which may have maintained the population was the extensive iron ore quarrying which took place in the western and southern parts of the parish. Quarrying began west of the road to Harby at the top of the scarp face. The quarrying began in 1881. The ore was taken down the scarp face by narrow-gauge tramway on a rope-worked incline to sidings on the Great Northern and London and North Western Joint Railway near Harby where it was loaded into railway wagons for transport to the iron works at Staveley, Derbyshire. As the quarries got further away from the incline the tramway was gradually extended.and from 1884 the tramway between the quarries and the incline top was worked by steam locomotives. Before that the wagons were pushed by hand or pulled by horses, the distance then being short. By 1913 the active quarries were either side of the Waltham Road close to the White Lodge. The tramway was then extended eastwards to serve new quarries at Eaton and Branston. Quarrying continued at Eastwell. The Eaton and Branston quarries that the tramway served closed in 1957. By 1959 the active quarry at Eastwell was on the south east side of the Scalford Road, west of the cross roads. The tramway was used only occasionally from then on and was taken up in 1961 and 1962. From 1959 the ore was taken by lorry to the railway sidings near Harby. The last quarry to be worked at Eastwell was on the east side of the Waltham Road, south of the White Lodge; it closed in 1967. The quarrying was done by hand with the aid of explosives at first but steam diggers were introduced from 1915 and diesel machines from 1936. As at 1988 some of the quarry buildings remained. The road bridge over the tramway at White Lodge was still there and quarry faces remained in two places east of the Waltham Road. Elsewhere the fields are smoothed over but sunken. Two of the Eastwell Tramway locomotives survive, Lord Granby and Nancy in working order at the Cavan and Leitrim Railway.

It was founded in 1978 by Jaya Arunachalam in Madras (Chennai). The WWF aims to empower poor women in southern India by providing microcredit, a trade union, health care and training. It works with the poor women working in the informal sector, such as street vendors, silkworm growers and silk weavers, handicraft producers, washerwomen and fisherwomen. 7,00,000 plus women have been brought together through WWF through the issue of credit and other services were also added such as that of child care, family planning, and education. One of the main reasons for women to join the WWF is to receive access to credit, since the amount of credit they receive is higher than that of informal lending, along with a reasonable interest rate. There are two organisations closely related to the WWF: *Indian Co-operative Network for Women (ICNW), provides loans * National Union of Working Women (NUWW), a trade union The WWF follows strong ideological positions as follows; Pro Women: Exclusively catering to women of the informal sector who provide support to their families and welfare. Anti-Dowry: To eradicate the practice of dowry through mass demonstration against such practices involving rape and divorce Anti-Caste and Pro-Secularism: Supporting women regardless of their casts and religious beliefs and inter-caste weddings. Anti-Politics: Avoiding involving the areas related to political parties and agendas.  History  WWF initially started with 30 women who were involved in petty trading, during the mid-70s, and formed themselves into a group with the assistance of Jaya Arunchalam, who was then a social/political worker in Madras. The group of women approached a bank for a loan, and received a sum of ₹300 for each member. Each day since then the repayment amount was collected from the women, and the repayment reached sum reached upto 95%. By the April of 1978, about 800 women were involved into this activity, formed into 40 groups and began receiving loans. This led to the emergence of Working Women's Forum.

In its first half, Wilde recounts their previous relationship and extravagant lifestyle which eventually led to Wilde's conviction and imprisonment for gross indecency. He indicts both Lord Alfred's vanity and his own weakness in acceding to those wishes. In the second half, Wilde charts his spiritual development in prison and identification with Jesus Christ, whom he characterises as a romantic, individualist artist. The letter began \\"Dear Bosie\\" and ended \\"Your Affectionate Friend\\". Wilde wrote the letter between January and March 1897, close to the end of his imprisonment. Contact had lapsed between Douglas and Wilde and the latter had suffered from his close supervision, physical labour, and emotional isolation. Nelson, the new prison governor, thought that writing might be more cathartic than prison labour. He was not allowed to send the long letter which he was allowed to write \\"for medicinal purposes\\"; each page was taken away when completed, and only at the end could he read it over and make revisions. Nelson gave the long letter to him on his release on 18 May 1897. Wilde entrusted the manuscript to the journalist Robert Ross (another former lover, loyal friend, and rival to \\"Bosie\\"). Ross published the letter in 1905, five years after Wilde's death, giving it the title \\"De Profundis\\" from Psalm 130. It was an incomplete version, excised of its autobiographical elements and references to the Queensberry family; various editions gave more text until in 1962 the complete and correct version appeared in a volume of Wilde's letters. Background  Trials  Oscar Wilde in New York in 1882; by 1897 he had lost much weight after a year and a half in prison. In 1891 Wilde began an intimate friendship with Lord Alfred Douglas, a young, vain aristocrat. As the two grew closer, family and friends on both sides urged Wilde and Douglas to lessen their contact. Lord Alfred's father, the Marquess of Queensberry, often feuded with his son over the topic. Especially after the suicide death of his eldest son, the Viscount Drumlanrig, Queensberry privately accused them of improper acts and threatened to cut off Lord Alfred's allowance. When they refused, he began publicly harassing Wilde. In early 1895 Wilde had reached the height of his fame and success with his plays An Ideal Husband and The Importance of Being Earnest on stage in London. When Wilde returned from holidays after the premieres, he found Queensberry's card at his club with the inscription: \\"For Oscar Wilde, posing somdomite\\".Holland (2004:300)Queensberry's handwriting was almost indecipherable: The hall porter initially read \\"ponce and sodomite\\", but Queensberry himself claimed that he'd written \\"posing 'as' a sodomite\\", an easier accusation to defend in court. Merlin Holland concludes that \\"what Queensberry almost certainly wrote was \\"posing \\", (Holland (2004:300)) Unable to bear further insults and encouraged by Lord Alfred (who wanted to attack his father in every possible way), Wilde sued Queensberry for criminal libel. Wilde withdrew his claim as the defence began, but the Judge deemed that Queensberry's accusation was justified. The Crown promptly issued a warrant for his arrest and he was charged with gross indecency with other men under the Labouchere Amendment in April 1895. The trial was the centre of public discussion as details of Wilde's consorts from the working class became known. Wilde refused to admit wrongdoing and the jury were unable to reach a verdict. At the retrial Wilde was sentenced to two years' imprisonment, to be held to hard labour.Sentencing Statement of Justice Wills . Criminal Trial Transcript Page, University of Missouri-Kansas Law School. Retrieved 22 April 2010.  Imprisonment  He was imprisoned in Pentonville, Wandsworth, and Reading Prisons, where the poor food, manual labour, and harsh conditions greatly weakened his health.Ellmann (1988:451) He quickly began suffering from hunger, insomnia, and disease.Ellmann (19988:454) He was visited in Pentonville by R. B. S. Haldane, a liberal, reforming MP whom he had known before. Haldane championed his case and arranged for access to religious, educational, and historical books.Ellmann (1988:456) Whilst in Wandsworth, Wilde collapsed in the Chapel and burst his right ear drum, an injury that would later contribute to his death. He spent two months recovering in the infirmary.Ellmann (1988:465) Friends arranged for him to be transferred to Reading Prison, where he was prescribed lighter duties and allowed to spend some time reading but not writing. Depressed, he was unable to complete even these duties, and under Colonel Isaacson, the strict Warden of Reading Prison, Wilde became trapped in a series of harsh punishments for trivial offences. The failure to complete them led to renewed sanction.Ellmann (1988:465–466) Wilde, who still loved Lord Alfred, became upset as contact from him became rare, then annoyed when he learned that the latter planned to publish Wilde's letters without permission and dedicate poems to him unasked. He wrote to friends immediately, forbidding the former and refusing the latter.Ellmann (1988:460) Wilde still maintained his belief that the Queensberrys owed him a debt of honour arising from his bankruptcy trial.Ellmann (1988:) Composition Wilde's cell in Reading Gaol where he wrote De Profundis – as it appears today Wilde's friends continued pressing for better conditions and, in 1897, Major Nelson, a man of a more progressive mind, replaced Col. Isaacson as Warden. He quickly visited Wilde and offered him a book from his personal library, the sympathy bringing Wilde to tears.Ellmann (1988:467) Soon Wilde requested lists of books, returning to Ancient Greek poets and Christian theology, and studying modern Italian and German, though it was Dante's Inferno that held his attention.Ellmann (1988:478) Wilde was granted official permission to have writing materials in early 1897, but even then under strict control: he could write to his friends and his solicitor, but only one page at a time. Wilde decided to write a letter to Douglas, and in it discuss the last five years they had spent together, creating an autobiography of sorts.Ellmann (1988:479) Wilde spent January, February, and March 1897 writing his letter. Textual analysis of the manuscript shows that Nelson probably relaxed the stringent rules, allowing Wilde to see the papers together: three of the sheets are of relatively fair copy, suggesting they were entirely re-written, and most do not end with a full-stop. Wilde requested that he might send the letter to Lord Alfred Douglas or Robert Ross, which the Home Office denied, but he was permitted to take it with him on release.Holland/Hart-Davis (2000:683) Wilde never revised the work after he left prison.Raby (1988:140)  Structure and content  Lord Alfred Douglas, to whom De Profundis is addressed  First part: Wilde's account of time with Douglas  Wilde's work was written as a prose letter on twenty sheets of prison paper. It contains no formal divisions (save paragraphs) and is addressed and signed off as a letter. Scholars have distinguished a noticeable change in style, tone and content in the latter half of the letter, when Wilde addresses his spiritual journey in prison.Raby (1988:135) In the first part, Wilde examines the time he and Lord Alfred had spent together, from 1892 until Wilde's trials in the spring of 1895. He examines Lord Alfred's behaviour and its detrimental effect on Wilde's work, and recounts Lord Alfred's constant demands on his attention and hospitality. Poignancy builds throughout this section as Wilde details the expenses of their sumptuous dinners and hotel-stays, many costing over £1,000; it culminates in an account of Douglas's rage in Brighton whilst Wilde was ill. Though he was a constant presence at Wilde's side, their relationship was intellectually sterile.Raby (1988:134) Throughout Wilde's self-accusation is that he acceded to these demands instead of placing himself within quiet, intellectual company dedicated to the contemplation of beauty and ideas, but instead succumbed to an \\"imperfect world of coarse uncompleted passions, of appetite without distinction, desire without limit, and formless greed\\". This passage concludes with Wilde offering his forgiveness to Douglas. He repudiates him for what Wilde finally sees as his arrogance and vanity; he had not forgotten Douglas's remark, when he was ill, \\"When you are not on your pedestal you are not interesting.\\"(De Profundis) Holland/Hart-Davis, (2000:700)  Second part: Christ as a romantic artist  The second part of the letter traces Wilde's spiritual growth through the physical and emotional hardships of his imprisonment. Wilde introduces the greater context, making a typically grandiose claim: \\"I was one who stood in symbolic relations to the art and culture of my age\\",Raby (1988:135,6) though he later writes, in a more humble vein, \\"I have said of myself that I was one who stood in symbolic relations to the art and culture of my age. There is not a single wretched man in this wretched place along with me who does not stand in symbolic relation to the very secret of life. For the secret of life is suffering.\\" Briefly sketching his ascendancy and dominance of the literary and social scenes in London, he contrasts his past position and the attendant pleasure with his current position and the pain it brings. Pleasure and success are an artifice, he says, while pain wears no mask. He turns to humility as a remedy, and identifies with the other prisoners.Raby (1988:136) Wilde uses Isaiah 53:3 to introduce his Christian theme: \\"He is despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid our faces from him.\\" Though Peter Raby acknowledges the \\"obvious relevance\\" of this quotation to Wilde's situation, he argues that the line does not necessitate the comparison with Christ implicit in his description of Robert Ross doffing his hat to Wilde after his conviction. Wilde adopts Jesus of Nazareth as a symbol of western kindness and eastern serenity and as a rebel-hero of mind, body and soul.Kiberd (2000:330) Though other romantics had discussed Jesus in artistic terms, Wilde's conception is the most radical. He moves methodically toward this conclusion: his earlier antinomian attitude is re-iterated and he finds no recompense in traditional morality. Though Wilde loved the beauty of religion, he dismissed it now as a source of solace, saying \\"My Gods dwell in temples made with hands\\". Reason was similarly lacking: Wilde felt that the law had convicted him unjustly. Instead Wilde reworked his earlier doctrine of the appreciation of experience: all of it must be accepted and transformed, whatever its origin. Wilde declared he would actively accept sorrow and discover humility, be happy and appreciate developments in art and life.Raby (1988:137) He also felt redemption and fulfilment in his ordeal, realising that his hardship had filled the soul with the fruit of experience, however bitter it tasted at the time: Simon Critchley argues that the major element of De Profundis is self-realisation. Wilde, having lost everything dear to him, does not accuse external forces, justified as this might have been, but rather absorbs his hardships through the artistic process into a spiritual experience.Critchley, Simon Oscar Wilde's faithless Christianity The Guardian 15 January 2009. Retrieved 16 November 2010  Style and themes  Though a letter, at 50,000 words long De Profundis becomes a sort of dramatic monologue which considers Douglas's supposed responses.Ellmann (1988) Wilde's previous prose writing had assumed a flippant, chatty style, which he again employed in his comic plays. In prison Wilde was disconnected from his audiences, which Declan Kiberd suggested was possibly his harshest punishment. He characterises Wilde as an Irish critic of English social mores ultimately silenced for his polemics, and reports that while convalescing in the sick-bay, Wilde entertained his fellow-patients and carers with stories and wit until the authorities placed a warder beside his bed. In a preface to the 1905 (and, later, 1912) edition,Robert, Ross, Preface to \\"De Profundis\\". London: Methuen & Co., Mar. 1905. published as a popular edition by Methuen, Robert Ross, Wilde's literary executor, published an extract from Wilde's instructions to him which included the author's own summation of the work: According to Kiberd, Wilde follows Christ's individualist theme of self-perfection into a testing new zone: prison. Wilde, who had always looked to test English society's hypocrisies, declined the opportunity to flee to France.Kiberd (2000:334) Kiberd places Wilde within the long tradition of prison writing by Irish Republican prisoners; when Wilde wanted to criticise the penal system after release, he contacted Michael Davitt, an Irish political reformer who had himself been imprisoned in England.Kiberd (2000:335) Publication history Robert Ross in 1911. He was Wilde's literary executor and oversaw the publication of De Profundis. On his release, Wilde unburdened himself of the manuscript by giving it to Robbie Ross, with the putative title Epistola: In Carcere et Vinculis (\\"Letter: In Prison and in Chains\\"),\\"How De Profundis got its name\\", Dexter, G. The Daily Telegraph, 15 June 2008. Retrieved 23 February 2010. Ross and Reggie Turner met the exiled Wilde on the ferry from England at Dieppe on 20 May 1897. The manuscript comprised eighty close- written pages on twenty folio sheets of thin blue prison paper. Ross was instructed to make two typed copies, one for Wilde himself, and to send the original to Lord Alfred. However, fearing that Douglas would destroy the original, Ross sent him a copy instead (Douglas said at the 1913 Ransome libel trial that he burnt the copy he was sent without reading it). Due to its length, Ross could not have it fully typed until August.Ellmann (1988:496) In 1905, Wilde's contemporary translator to German, Max Meyerfeld, published the first book edition with Samuel Fischer in Berlin which was preceded by a publication in Fischer's monthly magazine Neue Rundschau (Vol. 16, Nos. 1–2 [Jan.–Febr. 1905]). The book appeared on 11 February 1905 and hence preceded the English edition by Ross by about two weeks. Ross published the letter with the title \\"De Profundis\\", expurgating all references to the Queensberry family. This edition would go through eight printings in the next three years, including de luxe editions.Mason (1976:454) The title, meaning \\"from the depths\\", comes from Psalm 130, \\"From the depths, I have cried out to you, O Lord\\". In 1924, when Lord Alfred served six months in prison for libel against Winston Churchill, he wrote a sonnet sequence entitled In Excelsis (\\"from the heights\\"), intentionally mirroring Wilde's letter. A second, slightly expanded, version of De Profundis appeared in the edition of Collected Works of Wilde published by Ross between 1908 and 1922. Also included were three other letters Wilde wrote from Reading Prison and his two letters to the editor of the Daily Chronicle written after his release.Mason (1976:453) Ross then donated the manuscript to the British Museum on the understanding that it would not be made public until 1960. The manuscript is now in the British Library.Manuscript of 'De Profundis' by Oscar Wilde, full reproduction of the original manuscript. Retrieved: 30 January 2017. In 1913 the unabridged text was read in court. In 1912 Arthur Ransome had published Oscar Wilde: a critical study. Douglas sued Ransome for libel, and the case went to the High Court in April 1913. Ransome's counsel (Campbell) had the unabridged De Profundis read to the High Court. While the full text \\"was so inconsistent as to be quite unreliable as evidence of anything except Wilde's fluctuating state of mind while in prison .... the endless text, read out by Campbell's junior, bored the jury and further irritated the judge. They rebelled, and the reading was broken off; but the unalterable impression that it left in everybody’s mind was that Bosie was, in Labouchere's words, a young scoundrel and that he had ruined his great friend.\\" Douglas testified that he had received the letter from Ross, but after reading Ross's cover note threw it in the fire unread. He later said that he had never received the package at all.Ellmann (1988:497) Observers reported that Douglas could not bear it when he learned that the letter was addressed to him and heard its full contents. Once during the reading he simply disappeared, and was roundly rebuked by the judge.Ellmann (1988:552) Parts of the text were published subsequently in the London papers.Mason (1976:456) Ross quickly brought out another edition: The Suppressed Portion of \\"De Profundis\\", to claim the copyright on Wilde's work. It contained about half of the complete text. In 1949, Wilde's son Vyvyan Holland published the full text, but used a faulty typescript bequeathed to him by Ross. Ross's typescripts had contained several hundred errors, including typist's mistakes, his own emendations, and other omissions. In 1960, Rupert Hart-Davis examined the manuscript in the library of the British Museum, and produced a new, corrected text from it, which was published in The Letters of Oscar Wilde in 1962. He wrote that: The 1962 Hart-Davis edition is currently still in print in the expanded version of the book titled The Complete Letters of Oscar Wilde, which was published in New York and London in 2000.

Street, The Outlook magazine, (4 March 1905) xv 294-5; Beckson (1970:252) Street dismissed contemporary complaints that the letter lacked sincerity, saying this was just a manifestation of those who opposed Wilde's graceful writing style.Beckson (1970:253) Max Beerbohm, an old friend of Wilde's, wrote a signed review, \\"A Lord of Language,\\" for Vanity Fair. He described the writing in De Profundis as having achieved the perfect grace of Wilde's earlier work, and said that Wilde had remained a detached artist of words, concluding: \\"We see him here as the spectator of his own tragedy.

A partner in the Richmond, Virginia, firm of Hill, Tucker and Marsh (formerly Hill, Martin and Robinson), Tucker argued and won several civil rights cases before the Supreme Court of the United States, including Green v. County School Board of New Kent County which, according to The Encyclopedia of Civil Rights In America, \\"did more to advance school integration than any other Supreme Court decision since Brown.\\" Early life and education Tucker was born in Alexandria, Virginia, on June 18, 1913. His father, Samuel A. Tucker, a real estate agent and NAACP member, and teacher mother saw to his formal and informal education.J. Douglas Smith, Managing White Supremacy: Race, Politics and Citizenship in Jim Crow Virginia (University of North Carolina Press, 2002) p. 260 Tucker later said: \\"I got involved in the civil rights movement on June 18, 1913, in Alexandria. I was born black.\\" Although Alexandria was less segregated that Richmond and Norfolk, it provided no high school for black children, so after graduating from 8th grade, he had to \\"bootleg\\" a high school education across the Potomac River in Washington, D.C., at Armstrong High School. Black Virginia children commuted by streetcar. In June 1927, when Tucker was 14, he, 2 brothers and a friend refused to leave their seats after a streetcar crossed the river into Alexandria, despite the request of a white woman who believed one of the seats was designated only for whites. She swore out a warrant charging them with disorderly conduct and abusive language, and the police levied no fine upon the 11 year old Otto Tucker, but fined Samuel Tucker $5 plus court costs and his older brother George $50 plus court costs, claiming that as eldest he should have known better. However, on appeal, an all-white jury found the young men not guilty.Smith at pp. 260-261 Tucker began drafting deeds to help his father at an early age, and also began reading the law books of Tom Watson, a lawyer who shared an office with the senior Tucker. Samuel attended Howard University whose chaplain Howard Thurman had become an outspoken proponent of Mahatma Gandhi's nonviolent resistance strategy and where Charles Houston established the nation's first program in civil rights law.Smith at p. 261 He earned his undergraduate degree in 1933. Tucker soon qualified for the Virginia bar exam based on his studies in Watson's law office, but had to wait til June 1934, when he reached age 21, to begin practicing law. After two years with the Civilian Conservation Corps, Tucker and his friend George Wilson (a retired army sergeant) began in earnest dismantling segregation in Alexandria, first at the public library opened just 2 blocks from his home in August 1937, but which refused to issue cards to black residents. Legal career Tucker was admitted to the state bar in 1934, ironically in the same courtroom where a jury had acquitted him of the trolley car incident in 1927, and began practicing in Alexandria.Ackerman, WAPOST 2000, at p. 17 Police removing sit-in participants from the Alexandria Library Alexandria Library sit-in In 1939, Tucker organized a sit-in at Alexandria Library, which refused to issue library cards to black residents. On August 21, five young black men whom Tucker had recruited and instructed – William Evans, Otto L. Tucker, Edward Gaddis, Morris Murray, and Clarence Strange – entered the library one by one, requested applications for library cards and, when refused, each one took a book off the shelf and sat down in the reading room until they were removed by the police. Tucker had instructed the men to dress well, speak politely and offer no resistance to the police so as to minimize the chance of the men being found guilty of disorderly conduct or resisting arrest. Tucker defended the men in the ensuing legal actions, which resulted in the disorderly conduct charges against the protestors being dropped by city attorney Armistead Boothe (who would later become a key figure in desegregating Virginia schools), and in a branch library being established for blacks. While the sit-in received a four-paragraph story in the local Alexandria Gazette newspaper and brief mention in the Washington Post, the Chicago Defender ran the story on its front page accompanied by a photograph of the arrest, noting that the protest was being viewed as a \\"test case\\" in Virginia.Ackerman, WASHPOST@))! p. 17 Other African-American newspapers covered the legal action, reporting such developments as Tucker's cross- examination of the police, bringing forth an admission that had the men been white they would not have been arrested under similar circumstances. While Tucker succeeded in defending the sit-in participants, he was not satisfied with the separate but equal resolution of creating a new branch library, the Robert H. Robinson Library, for blacks. In a 1940 letter to the librarian of the whites-only library, Tucker stated that he would refuse to accept a card to the new blacks-only branch library in lieu of a card to be used at the existing library. The photograph of the sit-in participants in jackets and ties calmly but resolutely being escorted from the library by uniformed police has itself become a learning aid in Alexandria. Periodically, the city has commemorated the sit-in and used it as a teaching opportunity about the Jim Crow segregation era, with students from Samuel W. Tucker Elementary donning similar attire, acting out the sit-in events and posing in recreations of the photograph. Wartime service, then move to Emporia World War II interrupted his fledgling legal practice. Tucker entered the army and served in the 366th Infantry, which saw combat in Italy. Tucker rose to the rank of major. As World War II ended, the Virginia State Conference of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People had W. Lester Banks as executive secretary, Dr. Jesse M. Tinsley of Richmond and later E. B. Henderson of Falls Church as president, and Oliver W. Hill, Martin A. Martin and Spottswood Robinson as attorneys (the latter as liaison to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund). Tucker had returned to Alexandria but decided it had too many black lawyers, so he moved his law practice to Emporia, Virginia, in the heart of Southside Virginia. There, Tucker was the only black lawyer. There were neither black judges nor black jurors. The white legal establishment in Greensville County often did not appreciate Tucker's criminal defense tactics, which attacked not only the evidence against his poor black clients, but racial imbalance in the system itself. For example, Tucker defended Jodie Bailey who, after drinking, stabbed the popular white proprietor of an automobile repair business during a charge dispute, and the man died. With NAACP help, Tucker established that in the previous three decades, no trial jury in Greensville County had included any black jurors. The Virginia Supreme Court overturned Bailey's conviction, but ordered a new trial, where he was convicted again.Ackerman WASHPOST2000 at p. 18 Tucker also used a statistical argument in helping Martin A. Martin appeal the death sentences of the \\"Martinsville Seven\\". However, state and federal judges rejected the argument that since 1908 Virginia had executed 45 black men for raping white women, yet had executed no white man convicted of rape, so several clients were executed. Cooperating attorney for the NAACP under fire As the Civil Rights Movement developed during the postwar era, Tucker came to have a central role in its legal battles in Virginia. He ultimately filed suits in nearly 50 counties, including Alexandria and neighboring Arlington and Fairfax.Ackerman, WASHPOST2000 at p. 24 By the time Brown v. Board of Education was decided in 1954 and 1955, the NAACP state legal staff had grown to a dozen cooperating attorneys (including Tucker), and had filed fifteen petitions requesting desegregation with local school boards by the spring of 1956.Brian J. Daugherity, Keep on Keeping On (Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, 2016) p. 46 However, U.S. Senator Harry F. Byrd had vowed Massive Resistance to school desegregation, and that fall a special session of the Virginia General Assembly adopted (and Governor Thomas B. Stanley signed) a package of new laws to maintain segregation and close desegregating schools, which came to be known as the \\"Stanley Plan.\\" That collection of bills also contained seven relating to NAACP activities, and expanded the definitions of the common law legal ethics offenses of barratry, champerty and maintenance. Legislative committees led by James M. Thomson and John B. Boatwright attempted to use those new laws against the NAACP and cooperating attorneys. The Boatwright Committee subpoenaed NAACP membership lists, and issued reports in November 1957 and November 1958 accusing NAACP attorneys (including Tucker) of violating these laws and urging the Virginia State Bar to prosecute them. The Boatwright Committee specifically accused Tucker of soliciting \\"not less than 10 cases involving litigation\\" and claimed that some of his plaintiffs were signed up under false pretenses or had not realized they were becoming involved in litigation. Tucker became the only NAACP attorney that the Virginia State Bar attempted to prosecute and disbar for these expanded offenses. That prosecution began in February 1960, and the NAACP sent attorney Robert Ming from Chicago to defend Tucker before the state court in Emporia.Daugherity, at p. 90 The case was repeatedly dismissed without prejudice (allowing prosecutors to re-file), particularly after Commonwealth's attorney Harold Townsend asserted that Tucker had no right to confront or even identify his accusers because this was a bar proceeding. The NAACP rallied to Tucker's defense in fighting what it viewed as an attempt to derail legal desegregation in Virginia. It was transferred to Sussex County and finally dismissed in early 1962, although the judges orally reprimanded Tucker for his handling of an estate case.Ackerman, WASHPOST2000 p.24 In January 1963 in NAACP v. Button, the NAACP won other cases it had filed to stop enforcement of the last of the newly expanded laws. Furthermore, when in 1987, both Tucker and Oliver Hill received awards from Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell on behalf of the Virginia Commission on Women and Minorities in the Legal System, Tucker alluded to that prosecution and noted that he was now being honored \\"for the very thing for which I'm being recognized today\\".Ackerman WASHPOST 2000 at p. 25 In Richmond, Prince Edward and New Kent counties Meanwhile, in the early 1960s, Tucker formed the firm of Tucker and Marsh with Henry L. Marsh III in Richmond (which Hill would join in 1966). They and the NAACP participated in the long legal struggle to reopen the public schools in Prince Edward County, Virginia, which that county closed in 1959 to avoid desegregation, and which only reopened pursuant to court order in 1964. Tucker also continued to fight against racial discrimination in jury selection. In 1966, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund named Tucker \\"lawyer of the year\\". In 1967, for example, Tucker had about 150 civil rights cases before state and federal courts. Tucker's greatest legal achievement was probably Green v. County School Board of New Kent County, which challenged a freedom- of-choice plan the school board had enacted supposedly to desegregate the county schools on a voluntary basis, and which allowed white children to attend segregation academies at public expense. The case went to the Supreme Court of the United States, which heard statistical arguments from Tucker that the plan was no more than segregation by another name, 14 years after Brown. Then in May 1968, the Court ruled that the freedom-of-choice plan was an inadequate remedy and also decided that school boards had an \\"affirmative duty\\" to desegregate their schools, as the procedures improperly put a burden upon schoolchildren and their parents that Brown II had placed squarely on the School Board\\".Brian J. Daugherity, Keep on Keeping On (University ofVirginia Press 2016 at 124 et seq. Patience for \\"mere deliberate speed\\" had run out. The next day, Tucker appeared before U.S. District Judge Robert Merhige Jr. in Richmond with 40 files of desegregation cases he wanted reopened. He also appeared a year later in Washington, D.C., before the Senate Judiciary Committee to oppose the nomination to the Supreme Court of Judge Clement Haynesworth, who had often upheld school segregation.Ackerman, WASHPOST2000 at p. 28 In addition to bringing cases (and appearing before the Supreme Court four more times), Tucker was also active in the NAACP leadership, serving as chairman of the legal staff of the Virginia State Conference, as well as representing Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia on the national board of directors. Political activism and honors Tucker twice ran for U.S. Congress in the 4th District (17 southern Virginia counties including Greensville) against segregationist Watkins Abbitt, one of U.S. Senator Harry F. Byrd's key allies—in 1964 as an Independent and in 1968 as a Republican. Though Tucker knew he would never win more than 30% of the vote against the powerful incumbent, he believed the battles important to register the protests as well as aspirations of black voters in the district.Ackerman, WASHPOST2000, p. 29 In 1976, the NAACP honored Tucker by awarding him the William Robert Ming Advocacy Award for the spirit of financial and personal sacrifice displayed in his legal work. Death and legacy Grave at Arlington National Cemetery Tucker died on October 19, 1990, survived by his wife Julia. They had no children. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery, sharing a tombstone with his elder brother George. The Robert H. Robinson Library that opened in 1940 and closed in 1959 became home of the Alexandria Black History Museum.Nancy Noyes Silcox, Samuel Wilbert Tucker: The story of a Civil Rights Trailblazer and the 1939 Alexandria Library Sit-in (Fairfax: History4all, 2014) pp 75-77Char McCargo Bah, Christa Watters, Audrey P. Davis, Gwendolyn Brown-Henderson and James E. Henson Sr., African-Americans of Alexandria, Virginia (Charleston, The History Press, 2013), p. 84 In 1998, Emporia, Virginia, dedicated a monument in Tucker's honor, with an inscription calling him \\"an effective, unrelenting advocate for freedom, equality and human dignity – principles he loved – things that matter.\\" In 2000, Alexandria, Virginia dedicated a new school, Samuel W. Tucker Elementary School, to Tucker in honor of his life's work in the service of desegregation and education. In 2014, the city's library began collecting donations for the Samuel W. Tucker Fund, to expand a collection relating to civil rights history. Also in 2000, the Richmond City Council voted to rename a bridge formerly named after Confederate General J. E. B. Stuart after Tucker, despite controversy. In 2001, the Virginia State Bar's Young Lawyers Conference implemented the Oliver Hill/Samuel Tucker Institute, named for both Oliver Hill and Samuel Tucker. The institute seeks to reach future lawyers, in particular minority candidates, at an early age to provide them with exposure and opportunity to explore the legal profession they might not otherwise receive. Since 2001, the Oliver W. Hill & Samuel W. Tucker Scholarship Committee has presented scholarships to deserving first year law students at Virginia law schools and Howard University.

Two stocks are found within the Baltoceratidae, those with a calcareous rod secreted on the lower surface of the inside of the siphuncle known as \\"rod-bearing\\" and those without, in which the interior of the siphuncle tube is empty, known as \\"vacuosiphonate\\".S.C. Hook & R.H. Flower 1977. Late Canadian (Zones J, K) Cephalopod Faunas from Southwestern United States; Memoir 32, New Mexico Bureau of Mines and Mineral Resources, Socorro, NM Empty siphuncled forms, the vacuosiphonate, gave rise to the Michelinoceratidae, commonly known as the Orthoceratidae, which has its beginning in the lower Cassinian stage in the latter part of the Lower Ordovician. Rod bearing forms gave rise to the Troedsonnellidae with early members, Buttsoceras and Tajaroceras found in the upper Cassinian. The Baltoceratidae and Orthoceratidae both have a spherical apex that lacks a cicatrix, and similar, two-layered thin connecting rings which clearly places the Baltoceratidae in the Orthocerida as well. Furthermore, the Baltoceratidae are restricted to forms with a siphuncle that is tubular or slightly expanded within the chambers, excluding genera with a more ellesmeroceratid aspect in which connecting rings thicken inwardly, such as Amsleroceras, Cyptendoceras, and Rioceras .

He played all or part of five seasons in Major League Baseball for the Chicago Cubs, Cincinnati Reds, St. Louis Terriers, and St. Louis Browns, primarily as a catcher. He saw the majority of his action as a backup backstop for the Terriers in the Federal League.  Early career  Chapman played minor league baseball in the Central Kansas League. He made his major league debut on October 6, 1912, the final game of the Chicago Cubs' season, and went 1-for-4 with a triple and an RBI. On December 15 that offseason, Chapman was traded by the Cubs, along with Grover Lowdermilk and future Hall of Famer Joe Tinker, to the Cincinnati Reds for five players. Chapman, however, played with the minor-league Atlanta Crackers for much of 1913. He made two pinch-hitting appearances for the Reds that season, singling and striking out.  Federal League  The catcher was one of many MLB players to jump to the upstart Federal League in 1914, signing with the St. Louis Terriers. He played with them for both seasons of their existence, backing up Mike Simon and Grover Hartley. In 1914, Chapman hit .210 in 64 games with two doubles, a triple, and 14 RBI. In 1915, Chapman had the experience of playing for the league champions and had a somewhat more successful season himself, hitting .199 in 62 games with six doubles, three triples, one home run, and 29 RBI. His home run, the only such hit of his career, came off Baltimore's George Suggs.  Later career  Just before the dissolution of the Federal League, the St. Louis Browns purchased Chapman's rights from the Terriers. However, his time with the Browns resulted in numbers well below his career averages, as Chapman hit just .097 (3 for 31) in 18 games with no extra-base hits or RBI. He played his final major league game in July 1916, and spent the last two seasons of his career toiling for the Little Rock Travelers of the Southern Association, playing a career-high 131 games in 1917. Chapman died at age 30 in Nevada, Missouri, October 21, 1918, from injuries sustained serving in the military during World War I. Chapman was one of eight Major League Baseball players known either to have been killed or died from illness while serving in the armed forces during World War I.

He also had a sister, named Philopatho, who was the mother of the Athenian tragic poet Philocles. His father was Euphorion. Ameinias was from the Attica deme of Pallene according to Herodotus,Herodotus, Histories viii. 84, 93 or of that of Decelea according to Plutarch.Plutarch, Themistocles 14 He distinguished himself at the battle of Salamis as a trireme commander. His brother Aeschylus, also fought at the battle.ANONYMOUS LIFE OF AESCHYLUS, § 4 According to Diodorus Siculus, Ameinias was the first to ram the flagship of the Persians, sinking it and killing the admiral.Diodorus Siculus, Library, 11.27 Herodotus writes that Athenians said that Ameinias charged one of the enemy vessels and his ship was entangled in combat and his men were not being able to get away, so the other Greek ships joined in the fight to assist Ameinias and this is how the battle started, but the Aeginetans say that one of their ships was the first to attack the Persian fleet.Herodotus, 8.84 He also pursued the ship of Artemisia, and she escaped by ramming and sinking the ship of her ally Damasithymos. When Ameinias saw that he thought that her ship was Greek and he changed the direction of his Trireme to chase other Persian ships. Herodotus believed that Ameinias didn't know that Artemisia was on the ship because otherwise he would not have ceased his pursuit until either he had captured her or had been captured himself because orders had been given to the Athenian captains. Moreover, a prize had been offered of ten thousand drachmas for the man who should take her alive, since they thought it intolerable that a woman should lead an expedition against Athens.Herodotus Book 8: Urania, 93 \\"Now if he had known that Artemisia was sailing on this ship, he would not have ceased until either he had taken her or had been taken himself; for orders had been given to the Athenian captains, and moreover a prize was offered of ten thousand drachmas for the man who should take her alive; since they thought it intolerable that a woman should make an expedition against Athens.\\" In addition, according to Plutarch, Ameinias and the Socles of Pallene were the men who killed Ariamenes (Herodotus says that his name was Ariabignes), brother of Xerxes and admiral of the Persian navy. When Ariamenes attempted to board their ship, they hit him with their spears and thrust him into the sea.Themistocles By Plutarch \\"Ariamenes, admiral to Xerxes, a brave man and by far the best and worthiest of the king's brothers was seen throwing darts and shooting arrows from his huge galley, as from the walls of a castle. Aminias the Decelean and Sosicles the Pedian (This is wrong translation his name was Socles and he was from Palene), who sailed in the same vessel, upon the ships meeting stem to stem, and transfixing each the other with their brazen prows, so that they were fastened together, when Ariamenes attempted to board theirs, ran at him with their pikes, and thrust him into the sea...\\" Ameinias and Eumenes of Anagyrus (Anagyrus is the modern Vari) were judged to have been the bravest on this occasion among all the Athenians.Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca historica xi. 27 Aelian mentions that Ameinias prevented the condemnation of his brother Aeschylus by the Areopagus.Claudius Aelianus, Varia Historia v. 19 See also  References Sources * Category:Athenians of the Greco- Persian Wars Category:Battle of Salamis Category:5th-century BC Athenians Category:Ancient Greek military personnel ","title":"Ameinias of Athens"},{"id":"24067410","text":"Platystictidae is a family of damselflies, commonly known as shadowdamsels.

The -story structure designed by Owen Saylor and Payson opened on December 18, 1926 as the Ararat Shrine Temple. It cost the Shriners $1 million and had a seating capacity of 3,000. It was designed to imitate the Temple of Vesta and was to be part of a complex that also consisted of the Deramus Building and the American Hereford Building on other corners of the intersection at 10th and Central. In 1939 Union Trust of St. Louis foreclosed on the $600,000 note on the building. During World War II it was sold to the American Red Cross as a blood collection center. It was used as a legitimate theatre called the Playhouse and later the Victoria. Midland Broadcasting bought the building in 1947 for its KMBC radio broadcasts (and later KMBC-TV) In 1957 Durwood Organization took it over and converted for Todd-AO and later Cinerama movies at called the Capri Theatre.Lyric Theatre of Kansas City - Lyric Theatre History - Retrieved August 20, 2009 KMBC continued to broadcast from beneath the stage. In 1970 the Lyric Opera of Kansas City signed a lease to perform at the theatre. In 1974 Metromedia, then owners of KMBC-TV, took over management of the building although the live arts continued to be performed. In 1982 The Hearst Corporation, KMBC-TV's new owners, acquired the building. In 1989 a piece of plaster fell from the building during a rehearsal of the Kansas City Symphony.

To pull a plug several puzzles must be solved using the objects that scatter the floor of the aquarium. The Deathbowl is populated by creatures which will try to stop Sweevo from carrying out his task. The Deathbowl is constructed of several superimposed levels and Sweevo can travel between them by riding bubbles or diving into whirlpools. Sweevo begins to rust as soon as he enters the water and must complete his mission before he becomes incapacitated.

It opened in 1912 for orphans to be trained for agricultural and industrial work. Background Lincolndale Agricultural School was an adjunct to the New York Catholic Protectory, a facility for orphans, children referred by the courts, or those entrusted by parents who were unable to provide adequate care. The main campus was located in the Parkchester section of the Bronx. The Boys Department was managed by the Christian Brothers, while the girls and younger children were cared for by the Sisters of Charity of New York. In 1902, the brothers opened St. Philip's Home on Broome Street in Manhattan as transitional housing for boys who had \\"aged out\\" of the Protectory's care program. It assisted with job placement and served as a center to help former students establish themselves to live independently. History In 1907, the Protectory purchased a number of farms in Lincolndale, a hamlet in Somers in Westchester County, New York. While the boys at the Parkchester campus received training in the building trades, printing, shoemaking, tailoring, photography, and other potential job-related skills, the boys at Lincolndale learned farming and agricultural skills,\\"Our History\\", Lincolndale Hall Boys' Haven with the intent that they might be placed out on farms. Rather than living in a large dormitory, a number of cottages were built, each housing fifty boys, with each cottage under the direction of two brothers.

Construction and commissioning Brock was laid down as the Rudderow-class destroyer escort USS Brock (DE-234) on 27 October 1943 by the Charleston Navy Yard and launched as such on 20 January 1944, sponsored by Mrs. James W. Brock, mother of the ships namesake, Ensign John W. Brock. The ship was reclassified as a Crosley-class high-speed transport and redesignated APD-93 on 17 July 1944. After conversion to her new role, the ship was commissioned on 9 February 1945 with Lieutenant Commander Harrison H. Holton in command. Service history World War II After fitting out, Brock departed Charleston Navy Yard on 2 March 1945 bound for Cuba. Reaching Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on 4 March 1945, she conducted shakedown training until 19 March 1945, when she headed for Hampton Roads, Virginia. Following post-shakedown repairs and alterations at the Norfolk Navy Yard in Portsmouth, Virginia, Brock embarked passengers at the nearby Naval Operating Base Norfolk at Norfolk, Virginia, on 8 April 1945 and got underway for the Panama Canal Zone shortly thereafter as escort for the Pacific-bound attack cargo ships USS Seminole (AKA-104) and USS Mathews (AKA-96). Brock transited the Panama Canal on 14 April 1945 and, on 15 April 1945, departed for California. She reached San Diego, California, on 23 April 1945, but remained there only 18 hours before putting to sea for Hawaii with United States Marine Corps replacements embarked. She reached Pearl Harbor, Territory of Hawaii, on 2 May 1945 and soon thereafter conducted amphibious demolition exercises with an embarked underwater demolition team. On 12 May 1945, Brock sailed for the Marshall Islands in company with high-speed transport USS Kane (APD-18) and the attack transports USS Garrard (APA-84) and USS Sevier (APA-233). She reached Eniwetok on 21 May 1945 and, on 22 May 1945, sailed for Ulithi Atoll in the western Caroline Islands. Entering Ulithi lagoon on 24 May 1945, Brock dropped anchor; her officers and enlisted men enjoyed liberty at Mog Mog. On 31 May 1945, Brock left that Ulitihi Atoll in her wake, bound for the Philippines, and reached San Pedro Bay, Leyte, in the Philippine Islands on 3 June 1945. Pausing there for four days, Brock joined company with Kane once more and departed on 7 June 1945 to escort a convoy to the Ryukyu Islands. Upon reaching Kerama Retto on 12 June 1945, Brock drew duty on a screening station off the southeastern coast of Okinawa, where the Okinawa campaign was drawing to a close. She operated in those waters until 19 June 1945, when she switched to a station between Ie Shima and Okinawa. On the evening of 23 June 1945, orders sent Brock 20 nautical miles (37 kilometers) to seaward to rescue a downed pilot, who turned out to be First Lieutenant Gustave T. Broberg, USMCR, a former all-American basketball player from Dartmouth College. The former Ivy Leaguer had been forced down while returning from a mission over Formosa and uninjured, had been in the water two hours. On 26 June 1945, Brock encountered the enemy. While steaming independently on antisubmarine screening station E-23, approximately two nautical miles (3.7 kilometers) northeast of Ie Shima, Brock detected an unidentified radar contact, or \\"bogey,\\" at 01:13 hours, 15 nautical miles (28 kilometers) away and closing. As she tracked the intruder, Brocks commanding officer ordered her speed cut to five knots (9.25 kilometers per hour) to reduce her wake and to permit rapid acceleration if necessary and had the helmsman steer directly into the moon to reduce her silhouette. The barrels of Brocks after 40-millimeter antiaircraft guns followed the \\"bogey\\"—itself apparently unaware of Brocks presence—as it flew within 1,000 yards (914 meters) of Brock. Suddenly, the Japanese pilot detected Brock and veered off sharply toward her starboard quarter. Brocks starboard 20-millimeter and 40-millimeter guns aft opened fire at point-blank range, \\"positively and unmistakably\\"This quote, from the Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships (at http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/b9/brock-i.htm) is unattributed. hitting the plane, which observers identified as a Mitsubishi J2M \\"Jack\\" single-engine Imperial Japanese Navy fighter. The \\"Jack\\" paralleled Brocks course until her forward 40-millimeter guns could no longer depress to fire. When the \\"Jack\\" reached a point about 1,500 yards (1,372 meters) ahead of Brock, it started a turn back toward the ship, perhaps intending to crash into her, but then went out of control and crashed, leaving only a burning gasoline slick to mark its resting place. On 1 July 1945, Brock departed Okinawa bound for the Philippines in company with three other high-speed transports, USS Osmond Ingram (APD-35), USS Crosley (APD-87) and USS Joseph E. Campbell (APD-45) and two submarine chasers, USS SC-1012 and USS SC-1474. Arriving in San Pedro Bay at Leyte on 6 July 1945, Brock reported for duty with the Philippine Sea Frontiers forces and carried out local patrols for the remainder of World War II, which ended on 15 August 1945. Postwar Winding up her Philippine Sea Frontier duty, Brock set course for Hollandia, Dutch New Guinea, on 20 August 1945 and crossed the equator for the first time on 23 August 1945; in the traditional \\"Neptune Ceremonies,\\" her 33 \\"shellbacks\\" duly initiated nearly 200 \\"pollywogs,\\" including the commanding officer and 10 of the 12 officers on board. Later that day, Brock dropped anchor in Humboldt Bay, New Guinea. On 27 August 1945, she set a return course for the Philippines, and she reached Leyte on 31 August 1945. Heading for Manila on Luzon on 1 September 1945, Brock reached Manila on 3 September 1945. Underway again on 7 September 1945, Brock and destroyer escort USS Ebert (DE-768) sailed for Japan, escorting 22 attack transports which bore United States Eighth Army troops headed for occupation duty in Japan. Brock reached Tokyo Bay on 13 September 1945 and remained in Japanese waters until 23 September 1945, when she departed in the escort for a Leyte-bound convoy. During this voyage, Brock spotted and sank a naval mine ahead of the convoy. She anchored in San Pedro Bay, Leyte, on 4 October 1945 and entered drydock there on 10 October 1945. Along with other work, Brock received a coat of peacetime gray paint over the \\"green dragon\\" camouflage that had become standard for high-speed transports. Departing Philippine waters on 16 October 1945 with passengers embarked, Brock escorted a second convoy to Tokyo Bay, where she arrived on 27 October 1945. Following duty in the Inland Sea, Brock departed for Honshu on 7 November 1945 and reached Hiro Wan on 9 November 1945. She relieved the destroyer USS Rowan (DD-782) as harbor entrance control vessel at the entrance to the Bungo Strait on 11 November 1945 and served in that capacity and on patrol in the Inland Sea until 15 December 1945. At that point, Brock broke her homeward-bound pennant and set course for the United States in company with high-speed transport USS John Q. Roberts (APD-94). After stops at Nagoya in Japan, Eniwetok, Pearl Harbor, and San Diego, California, Brock reached San Pedro, California, on 10 January 1946. Following repairs and alterations there, she headed for the Atlantic on 15 February 1946. She reached the Panama Canal Zone on 24 February 1946 and reported for duty to the Commander, Amphibious Force, Atlantic Fleet, on 26 February 1946. Brock then proceeded north to Boston, Massachusetts, where she arrived on 5 March 1946 to begin a pre-inactivation overhaul. Underway for Green Cove Springs, Florida, on 11 April 1946, Brock arrived there on 13 April 1946, and joined the Florida Group, 16th Fleet, which later became the Florida Group, Atlantic Reserve Fleet. For the next year, Brock served as one of the \\"mother ships\\" for the Florida Group, providing steam and power to various ships of the inactive fleet and furnishing quarters and mess facilities for men deactivating ships at Green Cove Springs. Decommissioning and disposal Decommissioned on 5 May 1947, Brock was placed in reserve at Green Cove Springs on 4 June 1947 and remained there for nearly 13 years. On 1 June 1960, her name was stricken from the Navy List, and she was sold to the government of Colombia in January 1962 for use as a floating power plant. Honors and awards Brock received one battle star for her service in World War II.

From this basis he became the founder of Integralismo Lusitano that same year along with Monsaraz and Sardinha.Anna Klobucka, The Portuguese Nun: Formation of a National Myth, 2000, p. 83 Raposo became known as one of the main ideologues of the new group and as a theorist he had a deep influence on Plínio Salgado who frequently referenced his works.Roger Griffin & Matthew Feldman, Fascism: The \\"Fascist Epoch\\", 2004, p. 83 Fascism In the early 1920s Raposo also became close to a minor group known as Cruzada Non'Alvares, which was the first group in Portugal to openly endorse Benito Mussolini and Italian fascism. Like others in the Integralist movement Raposo also keenly watched the development Movimento Nacional- Sindicalista but, although he personally had some sympathies towards the cause of national syndicalism, he did not follow the likes of Monsaraz in switching to the new movement. However despite his flirtations with fascism Raposo, unlike Sardinha, had no truck with the racialist theories associated with Nazism and similar ideologies and indeed considered the Black African populations of colonies such as Portuguese Angola and Portuguese Mozambique to be as much Portuguese as himself. Later years His influence faded following the emergence of António de Oliveira Salazar and his final attempt to push the integralist line, by launching a journal entitled Integralismo Lusitano with Luís de Almeida Braga in 1932 was not a success.Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right, 1990, p. 8 Having initially been ambivalent in his attitudes towards Salazar, Raposo decided in 1940 that the dictator was ruining Portugal and published a book, Amar e Servir, in which he savaged the Estado Novo founder.

In the episode, Spider-Man must face \\"The Lizard,\\" who was a lab professor he was interning for until he was mutated by a serum designed to regrow his missing arm. \\"Natural Selection\\" was written by Matt Wayne, known for his work on Justice League Unlimited, and was the first time he had done so for The Spectacular Spider-Man. David Bullock directed it. \\"Natural Selection\\" originally aired on March 15, 2008, on the Kids WB! block for The CW network, and met overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics, who praise it for its action sequences, narrative direction, and the new design for Lizard. Plot summary During his patrol, Spider-Man stops a group of thieves who are breaking into a bakery. Simultaneously, Spider-Man takes pictures to give to the Daily Bugle. He happily leaves and returns home before his curfew. However, upon reviewing the photos, he discovers they are unfortunately unusable. Meanwhile, Dr. Curt Connors injects himself with an experimental serum, in an attempt to regrow his missing arm, before going to bed. Later, he awakens to discover his arm has indeed regrown. His wife, Martha, is furious that he experimented on himself without her knowledge, but softens upon seeing their son's reaction. Spider-Man fights the Lizard at Bronx Zoo. At school, Peter is attacked with water balloons by Flash Thompson and his sidekick Kenny Kong, which he dodges until he realizes it might reveal his secret identity as Spider-Man. Gwen steps in and gets everyone to laugh at Flash instead. Gwen and Peter go to the Connors lab and help Eddie clean up from a previous battle with Electro. Martha announces that Curt's arm had grown back and they celebrate until they realize scales are growing on his arm, determining that the reptilian half of his brain his taking over. Peter tries to comfort the Connors's son, Billy, but gets interrupted when Curt transforms into a hulking, humanoid lizard and runs off. While Eddie goes in pursuit, Peter manages to slip out and goes after Connors as Spider-Man. While trying to communicate with him, they end up on a subway train fighting both inside, outside, and underneath it. Finally, Spider-Man falls off the train and Connors escapes. Spider-Man returns to the lab and is given a gene cleanser from Martha which must be administered to Connors orally. He then goes off to Bronx Zoo, where Connors is reportedly at. Spider-Man enters the lizard room where Connors has taken refuge. Connors knocks him out and Eddie arrives to help him out. When he regains consciousness, Spider-Man comes up with a plan to trick him into the polar bear pond. They almost succeed when Connors is alerted by Spider-Man's cellphone ringing. Billy then arrives and tries to talk some sense into his father, but it is useless and Spider-Man leaps in to get Connors into the pond. Spider-Man pours the cleanser into the mouth of Connors who, as a result, returns to normal, his arm lost once more. The next day, Peter gets the Lizard photos published in the Bugle and gets the money he needs. However, when Gwen, Eddie, and the Connors find out, they are outraged that he ran off simply to take pictures and say he has lost their trust. Although Martha understands the difficult choices that Peter had, she fires him. He secretly grabs another vial of gene cleanser and returns home, frustrated about his reputation. Blaming the events that gave him his powers, he is about to take the vial when he sees a photo of himself with Ben. Realizing that he had saved Curt either way, he decides that Spider-Man is needed and hides the vial under his desk. Production \\"Natural Selection\\" was the first episode to be written by Matt Wayne. Wayne wrote two other episodes in the first season: \\"The Invisible Hand\\" and \\"Persona.\\" David Bullock was the episode's director. Dee Bradley Baker, a voice actor for animated series and video games, continued his role as Dr. Connors/The Lizard. The episode originally broadcast on March 15, 2008, on the Kids WB! programming block for The CW Network. When Disney XD premiered The Spectacular Spider-Man on March 23, 2009, it aired \\"Natural Selection\\" after the previous two episodes, \\"Survival of the Fittest\\" and \\"Interactions.\\" Cultural references Greg Weisman, one of The Spectacular Spider-Mans producers came up with a continuing title scheme that follows \\"The Education of Peter Parker.\\" The first three episode titles (\\"Survival of the Fittest\\", \\"Interactions\\", and \\"Natural Selection\\") follow a biology theme. Peter's ringtone is \\"The Itsy Bitsy Spider.\\" The episode incorporates several bullet time moments that are referent to the same style employed in The Matrix films. Reception Natural Selection received critical acclaim. Eric Goldman of IGN gave it an 8.8 out of 10 (\\"Great\\"). Goldman praised the Lizard's design, calling it \\"the most visually familiar villain the show had introduced yet\\" and called the fight sequences \\"great,\\" especially that of the climactic fight between Spider-Man and Lizard. Goldman called Peter's loss of the Connors's and Eddie's trust \\"a very well done, classic Peter Parker-can't-win scenario\\" and that the episode did a \\"great job\\" blending the normal and Spider-Man parts of Peter's life. Season Elliot, senior editor of iF Magazine, gave the episode an A-, writing \\"The Lizard himself was a nice update of the original Lizard and he was still in his torn pants, shirt, and lab coat.\\" Elliot praised the design for differentiating itself from that used for Spider-Man or Spider-Man: The New Animated Series, and that he \\"can't wait for the action figure of this guy!\\" Like Goldman and Tanaka, Elliot enjoyed the action style and fight sequences and the callbacks to Lizard's original comic book appearance.

Oil on board. John Davidson Butler (1890–1976), was an American artist from Seattle, Washington. He worked primarily as a painter, but later also as a printmaker and ceramicist.John (JB) Butler (1890 - 1976), Ask/Art: The Artists' Bluebook (subscription site). Accessed 2009-08-19. Butler was one of three Seattle artists who worked together under the name \\"The Triad\\". The others were etcher Roi Partridge and miniaturist Clare Shepard Shisler. Also in their circle were photographer Imogen Cunningham (who used Butler and the others extensively as models, and later married Partridge), and painters Mabel Lisle Ducasse and Yasushi Tanaka. As a youth, Butler studied in Seattle under Carlotta Blaurock, who had been, in turn, a student of James McNeill Whistler. He also studied with Ella Shepard Bush (founder in 1894 of the Seattle Art SchoolMartha Kingsbury, Celebrating Washington's Art, 1989 Washington Centennial Commission, 1989, p. 5.) and other local artists. Some of his early work was exhibited at Seattle's 1909 Alaska–Yukon–Pacific Exposition. In 1910, he followed Partridge to New York, where two of Butler's watercolors were shown at the American Watercolor Society exhibition at the National Academy of Design. The two traveled on to Europe where Butler studied at the Colorossi Academy in Paris and also studied in Germany. Returning to America, he continued his studies under William Merritt Chase, at a summer 1914 class in Carmel, California. There, he shared a first prize from Chase with a fellow Seattle artist, Louise Crow. Upon returning home, he had a successful solo exhibition at the Seattle Fine Arts Society, which was a predecessor to the Seattle Art Museum. He offered private classes, and also became the first teacher of painting at the Cornish School, later Cornish College of the Arts. His students included Kenneth Callahan and Thomas Handforth.Nellie C. Cornish (edited by Ellen Van Volkenburg Browne and Edward Nordhoff Beck), Miss Aunt Nellie: The Autobiography of Nellie C. Cornish (1964), University of Washington Press. p. 95 He served in the military in World War I; after the war, he remained primarily in Europe until 1932, periodically sending works for exhibition in Seattle. While in Europe he began making woodcuts and blockprints, which were exhibited at the Northwest Printmakers Society in Seattle, among other venues. Returning the U.S., he taught at a variety of institutions in Seattle, Minneapolis, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. He received a Bronze Medal in a national figure composition competition at Washington, D.C.'s Corcoran Gallery in 1938. In the early 1940s, he began working in ceramics. Butler produced numerous murals in Seattle and elsewhere and illustrations for local Seattle publications. He also wrote articles and worked with arts organizations to promote art in Seattle. Butler rarely signed his works, so it is not always readily apparent what works are his. Some of the early works when he was associated with \\"The Triad\\" bear a triangular cipher. He sometimes signed his work with his initials, \\"J.B.\\" The Seattle Art Museum's collection includes a painting by Butler, depicting a couple resting on the banks of Lake Washington on a Summer Day.

Recruitment poster of the Republic of Vietnam Airborne Forces A 12-Year Old Child Adopted by the Airborne Division Holds a M79 Grenade Launcher. The Vietnamese Airborne Division was one of the earliest components of the Republic of Vietnam Military Forces (Vietnamese: Quân lực Việt Nam Cộng hòa – QLVNCH). The Vietnamese Airborne Division began as companies organized in 1948, prior to any agreement over armed forces in Vietnam. After the partition of Vietnam, it became a part of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. This division had its distinct origins in French-trained paratrooper battalions, with predecessor battalions participating in major battles including Dien Bien Phu and retained distinct uniforms and regalia. With the formation of an independent republic, the colonial paratroopers were dissolved, however regalia and aesthetics alongside the nickname \\"Bawouans\\" would be retained. The Airborne Division, alongside the Vietnamese Rangers and the Marine Division were often regarded as among the most effective units, with former airborne advisor General Barry McCaffrey noting that \\"those of us privileged to serve with them were awestruck by their courage and tactical aggressiveness. The senior officers and non-commissioned officers were extremely competent and battle-hardened.\\" Eight of nine battalions and three headquarters had earned US Presidential Unit Citation (United States) of which eight of these were earned by the Airborne between 1967-1968 which included the Tet Offensive period. Airborne commanders were often highly rated, with Airborne Commander Ngô Quang Trưởng once described by former Airborne-adviser and Gulf War commanding General Norman Schwarzkopf Jr. as \\"the most brilliant tactical commander I have ever known\\". History The Airborne Division had its origins in Indochinese- specific units raised under the \\"jaunissement\\" program, separating Indochinese members of French paratrooper units of the French Far East Expeditionary Corps forming separate battalions under the Vietnamese National Army. Among these includes the 1e BPVN, 3e BPVN and 5e BPVN who were airdropped into combat during the Siege of Dien Bien Phu. Most were killed afterward upon capture by the Viet Minh, who regarded them as traitors, rather than bargained as the French had been.Jean-Jacques Arzalier, Les Pertes Humaines, 1954–2004: La Bataille de Dien Bien Phu, entre Histoire et Mémoire, Société française d'histoire d'outre-mer, 2004 They were later reformed into the Republic of Vietnam Military Forces and restructured upon the expulsion of the French by Ngo Dinh Diem following the Geneva Accords. Vietnamese Airborne Division was among the elite fighting forces in the ARVN and placed as a reserve unit along with the Republic of Vietnam Marine Division. Headquarters of the Airborne Division was outside of Saigon. The Airborne Division would mobilize anywhere within the four corps at a moment's notice. The main use of the Airborne was to engage and destroy People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and Viet Cong (VC) forces, not hold a specific region like the infantry units. On the afternoon of 10 June, 1965 during the Battle of Đồng Xoài, the 7th Airborne Battalion was landed in Đồng Xoài to reinforce the defenders in the camp. The following day the battalion marched 4km north into the Thuận Lợi rubber plantation where elements of the 1st Battalion, 7th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Division had been ambushed the previous day and they collected seven survivors and 55 bodies. In the afternoon, as elements of the battalion continued searching the plantation, the VC 271st Regiment started attacking them. Taking advantage of the poor weather conditions that had limited US airstrikes, as well as their numerical superiority, the VC broke the battalion into small groups and destroyed many of them. On 12 June, the strength of the 7th Airborne Battalion was reduced from 470 to just 159 soldiers. On 11 December 1965 a United States Air Force (USAF) C-123B Provider #56-4376 crashed en route from Pleiku Air Base to Tuy Hoa Air Base killing all 4 USAF crewmen and 81 soldiers of the 7th Airborne Battalion on board. The remains of the crew and passengers were recovered, but the identities of the Airborne soldiers could not be established and they were kept at the Laboratory at Joint Base Pearl Harbor–Hickam for more than 30 years before being interred at the Vietnamese cemetery in Westminster, California in October 2019. From 4–7 March 1966 the 1st and 5th Airborne Battalions participated in Operation Utah with the ARVN 37th Ranger Battalion and elements of the US 1st Marine Division fighting the PAVN 21st Regiment northwest of Quảng Ngãi. From 20–25 March 1966 the 5th Airborne Battalion participated in Operation Texas with the ARVN 2nd and 3rd Battalions, 5th Regiment, 2nd Division and elements of the US 1st Marine Division fighting elements of the PAVN 21st Regiment and VC 1st Regiment around Hill 141 northwest of Quảng Ngãi. On 4 August 1967 as part of Operation Greeley the 8th Airborne Battalion was deployed to aid the 1st Battalion, 42nd Regiment, 22nd Division which was locked in combat with a PAVN force on a hilltop west of Dak Seang Camp. After a three-day battle ARVN forces found 189 PAVN bodies, large quantities of ammunition and equipment, and a sophisticated regimental command post with training areas and an elaborate mock-up of the Dak Seang Camp. 1968 The Tết ceasefire began on 29 January 1968, but was canceled on 30 January after the VC/PAVN prematurely launched their Tet Offensive attacks in II Corps and II Field Force, Vietnam commander, LG Frederick C. Weyand deployed his forces to defend Saigon. General Cao Văn Viên, chief of the Joint General Staff, ordered the 8th Airborne Battalion, which was to deploy north to Quảng Trị Province, to remain at Tan Son Nhut Air Base and the Battalion participated in the defense of both the Tan Son Nhut Air Base and the Joint General Staff Compound. The 6th Airborne Battalion also late joined the fighting at the JGS Compound. During the Battle of Hue, after resisting the initial PAVN/VC attacks on its Mang Ca Garrison headquarters on the morning of 31 January 1968, 1st Division commander General Ngô Quang Trưởng called in reinforcements including the 1st ARVN Airborne Task Force to relieve the pressure on Mang Ca. Responding to the call at PK-17 base 17 km north of Huế, the 3rd Troop and the 7th Battalion of the Airborne task force rolled out of their base area in an armored convoy onto Highway 1. A PAVN blocking force stopped the ARVN relief force about 400 meters short of the Citadel wall. Unable to force their way through the enemy positions, the Airborne asked for assistance. The 2nd Airborne Battalion then reinforced the convoy, and the ARVN finally penetrated the lines and entered the Citadel in the early morning hours of 1 February. The cost had been heavy: the ARVN suffered 131 casualties including 40 dead and lost four of the 12 armored personnel carriers in the convoy. The ARVN claimed to have killed 250 PAVN, captured five prisoners, and recovered 71 individual and 25 crew-served weapons. The ARVN would attempt to regain the Citadel while the Marines regained the new city south of the Perfume River. Within the Citadel the ARVN 1st Battalion, 3rd Regiment, and the 1st Airborne task force cleared out the north and western parts of the Citadel including Tây Lộc Airfield and the Chanh Tay Gate, while the 4th Battalion, 2nd Regiment moved south from Mang Ca towards the Imperial Palace, killing over 700 PAVN/VC by 4 February. On 5 February General Trưởng exchanged the Airborne with the 4th Battalion, which had become stalled. On 11 February the Vietnamese Marines Task Force A comprising the 1st and 5th Battalions, began to be lifted by helicopter into Mang Ca to replace the Airborne, however, due to poor weather this deployment would not be completed until 13 February. The ARVN Airborne had withdrawn from the eastern wall of the Citadel when the Vietnamese Marines began to arrive at Mang Ca and the PAVN defenders had used this opportunity to reoccupy several blocks and reinforce their defenses. At the start of the Battle of Quang Tri on 31 January 1968 the 9th Airborne Battalion was deployed around Quảng Trị with one Airborne company bivouacked in Tri Buu village on the northern edge of the city with elements in the Citadel, and two Airborne companies positioned just south of the city in the area of a large cemetery where Highway 1 crosses Route 555. As the 600-man VC 814th Battalion, 324th Division was moving into position to attack Quảng Trị from the northeast, it unexpectedly encountered the 9th ARVN Airborne company in Tri Buu village, which engaged it in a sharp firefight lasting about 20 minutes. The Airborne company was nearly annihilated and an American adviser killed, but its stubborn resistance stalled the battalion's assault on the Citadel and the city. By 04:20, the PAVN's heavy pressure and overwhelming numbers forced the surviving Airborne soldiers to pull back into the city, and the 814th attacked and attempted to enter the Citadel unsuccessfully. At the same time the PAVN K6 Battalion, 812th Regiment encountered the Airborne forces in the cemetery south of the city preventing an attack on the ARVN 1st Infantry Regiment, 1st Division's La Vang Base. In the afternoon 2 companies of the US 1st Battalion, 5th Cavalry Regiment were landed southeast of Quảng Trị engaging the K6 Battalion from the rear in a heavy firefight, while Airborne troops blocked and attacked it from the direction of the city. US helicopter gunships and artillery hit the K6 Battalion hard causing significant further casualties. By nightfall on the 31st, the battered 812th Regiment decided to withdraw, though clashes continued throughout the night. Quảng Trị was clear of PAVN/VC troops by midday on 1 February, and ARVN units with U.S. air support had cleared Tri Buu Village of PAVN troops. The remnants of the 812th, having been hit hard by ARVN defenders and US airpower and ground troops on the outskirts of the city, particularly artillery and helicopters broke up into small groups, sometimes mingling with crowds of fleeing refugees, and began to exfiltrate the area, trying to avoid further contact with Allied forces. Between 31 January and 6 February, the Allies killed an estimated 914 PAVN/VC and captured another 86 in and around Quang Tri. From 11 March to 7 April 1968 the Division participated in Operation Quyet Thang in Gia Định Province with the Marine Brigade and the US 199th Light Infantry Brigade to reestablish South Vietnamese control over the areas immediately around Saigon in the aftermath of the Tet Offensive. On 26 March, east of Hóc Môn Airborne forces found 128 dead VC who had apparently been killed by air and artillery strikes while moving south towards Saigon. From 8 April to 31 May 1968 the 1st Airborne Task Force participated in Operation Toan Thang I to continue pressure on PAVN/VC forces in III Corps. The operation involved nearly every combat unit in III Corps. The operation was a success with allied forces claiming 7645 VC/PAVN killed, however, the operation did not prevent the VC/PAVN from launching their May Offensive attacks against Saigon. From 20 April to 12 May 1968 the 6th Airborne Battalion participated in Operation Delaware with the US 1st Cavalry Division. During the May Offensive at 10:00 on 5 May the Airborne was engaged by VC north of Tan Son Nhut Air Base. On 13 September 1968 during the Phase III Offensive, the VC 3rd Battalion, 272nd Regiment attacked Firebase Buell II. After a 600 round mortar barrage, the infantry attacked the base but were easily repulsed leaving 76 dead for no U.S. losses. The VC retreated west taking refuge in a hamlet southwest of Tây Ninh where they were engaged late that day by the 2nd Airborne Battalion who killed 150 VC for the loss of 9 dead and 17 wounded. After midnight on 20 September the 1st Battalion, 272nd Regiment, attacked a Regional Forces outpost in Phước Tân hamlet, 20km west of Tay Ninh City, losing 35 killed in the brief assault. The 1st Marine Battalion was deployed to Phước Tân later that day to defend against any renewed assault. That evening the 271st Regiment attacked, the assault was repelled with air and artillery support, killing 128 VC with 6 captured. The 8th Airborne Battalion was also deployed to Phước Tân and on the night of 27 September the 272nd Regiment attacked again losing 150 killed. From 3 December 1968 the 2nd Airborne Task Force participated in Operation Goodwood under the operational control of the 1st Australian Task Force. On 15 January 1969 the 1st Marine Battalion replaced the 2nd Airborne Task Force. 1969-71 In June 1969 the new II Field Force, Vietnam commander Lt. Gen. Julian Ewell initiated the Dong Tien (or \\"Progress Together\\") Program with III Corps commander, General Đỗ Cao Trí, to \\"buddy up US and ARVN units to conduct combined operations [that would]... maximize the effectiveness of both forces [and] achieve in 2, 3, or 4 months a quantum jump in ARVN and RF/PF performance.\\" The Airborne, now a complete nine-battalion division with three regimental and one division headquarters, artillery and supporting services, was still part of the general reserves under the supervision of the Joint General Staff, Saigon had never employed the force as an entire division and was still parceling it out in small multi-battalion task forces that continued to suffer more than their share of wear and tear. In contrast, other elements of the Airborne force, including the division headquarters and many of the support units, had seen little action in the field, rarely moving from their Tan Son Nhut base camp. Something had to be done to revitalize this key unit that would someday have to serve as the mobile reserve force for the entire country, and in October 1969 General Ewell nominated the US 1st Cavalry Division for the task. Since its arrival in III Corps in late 1968, the 1st Cavalry Division had been operating along the sparsely populated Cambodian border, engaging regular PAVN forces that ventured south across the frontier. Although the division had conducted a number of minor combined operations with assorted ARVN units, it had remained aloof from the main Dong Tien Program. However, the reduced amount of PAVN activity along the border during the second half of 1969 enabled Ewell to expand the missions of the airmobile unit. In October and November representatives of II Field Force and III Corps met in a series of meetings at General Trí's Bien Hoa headquarters, and laid out the ground rules for the Cavalry-Airborne Dong Tien operation. Trí emphasized the need for close coordination of commands and staffs at the division and brigade/regimental levels but felt that integrated operations at the battalion level were unnecessary. Presumably, the Airborne battalions were experienced enough to take care of themselves, but the Airborne brigade and division staffs needed much work. The Cavalry would have to make helicopters available and supply certain airmobile and communications equipment that the Vietnamese lacked. With these exceptions, the Vietnamese were to be in charge of their own operations, including their logistical needs. Trí also wanted the Airborne Division to establish a forward headquarters with a full tactical operations center alongside the US division headquarters. Almost immediately the 2nd Airborne Brigade moved into War Zone C along the Cambodian border for combined operations with the 1st Cavalry Division's 1st Brigade. Operating from Tây Ninh City, the two Brigade commanders opened fire support bases across War Zone C for the three participating Airborne battalions. The ARVN bases, each housing one Airborne battalion, and a supporting artillery battery were staggered between 1st Brigade firebases, making US artillery support readily available. Initially, the commanders matched each Airborne battalion with a Cavalry unit, and Cavalry personnel gave Airborne troops and their advisers' elementary instruction in combat air assaults, extractions, and resupply. But the Cavalry units had relatively little to do with the day-to- day ground operations of the Airborne. Each Airborne battalion had its own area of operation and, supported by helicopters of the US 11th Combat Aviation Group, constantly patrolled their jungle zones. In December the Cavalry's 2nd Brigade began a similar program with the 1st Airborne Brigade east of War Zone C, in the Phước Bình border area. General Ewell reinforced the Vietnamese and advisory communications systems with US forward observers, special liaison teams, and extra radios. This assistance, together with the overlapping artillery support and the close proximity of US airmobile infantry battalions, ensured that he could quickly aid the Vietnamese units should strong enemy forces be encountered, but despite Ewell's concern, such occasions never arose, and the Airborne operations were relatively uneventful. After several months in the field, General Trí rotated other airborne units through the 1st Cavalry Division's \\"training area\\" until the program ended in April 1970. The effort was a mixed success. As in similar programs, American air, communications, and logistical support enabled the South Vietnamese units to run extended operations well beyond their normal supply and support capabilities. However, the Airborne never operated as an entire division. Because the division commander, General Đống, failed to establish a tactical command post and rarely took to the field, his staff and support units benefited little. Americans still considered Đống a problem child and felt that the Airborne had significant weaknesses that Dong Tien had been unable to address. Nevertheless, the combined effort set the stage for more ambitious undertakings in Cambodia one month later. On 1 May 1970 as part of Operation Toan Thang 43 (Total Victory), an early phase of the Cambodian Campaign, the 3rd Airborne Brigade together with other US forces crossed into Kampong Cham Province of Cambodia. The Airborne played a significant role in the campaign, with battalions participating in most of the individual operations and finding significant caches of supplies, alongside being the sole force dropped behind enemy lines to cut-off a potential retreat. From 8 February to 25 March 1971 the 2nd Airborne Battalion and the 3rd Airborne Brigade Headquarters and the 3rd Airborne Battalion participated in Operation Lam Son 719. The two battalions developed firebases along Route 9 in Laos to serve as tripwires for any PAVN advance into the zone of the ARVN incursion. On 23 February the PAVN began shelling the 3rd Battalion's Fire Support Base 31. Airborne Division commander General Đống had opposed stationing his elite paratroopers in static defensive positions and felt that his men's usual aggressiveness had been stifled. Vicious PAVN anti-aircraft fire made reinforcement and resupply of the firebase impossible. General Đống then ordered elements of the 17th Armored Squadron to advance north from A Loui to reinforce the base. The armored force never arrived, due to conflicting orders that halted the armored advance several kilometers south of FSB 31. On 25 February the PAVN deluged the base with artillery fire and then launched a conventional armored/infantry assault. Smoke, dust, and haze precluded observation by an American forward air control (FAC) aircraft, which was flying above to avoid anti-aircraft fire. When a U.S. Air Force F-4 Phantom jet was shot down in the area, the FAC left the area of the battle to direct a rescue effort for the downed aircraft crew, sealing the fate of the base. PAVN troops and tanks then overran the position, capturing the ARVN brigade commander in the process. FSB 31 was secured by the PAVN at an estimated cost of 250 killed, and 11 PT-76 and T-54 tanks destroyed. The Airborne had suffered 155 killed and over 100 captured. the 2nd Battalion at Fire Support Base 30 lasted only about one week longer. Although the steepness of the hill on which the base was situated precluded armored attack, the PAVN artillery bombardment was very effective. By 3 March the base's six 105mm and six 155mm howitzers had been put out of action. In an attempt to relieve the firebase, ARVN armor and infantry of the 17th Cavalry moved out to save their comrades. Following the conclusion of the operation the Airborne were kept in I Corps instead of returning to their base in Saigon, presumably to prevent them spreading stories of the losses suffered in the operation. Easter Offensive In late February 1972 in response to intelligence reports of a PAVN buildup including tanks and artillery in the Central Highlands, the 2nd Airborne Brigade was placed under the control of II Corps and deployed to secure a string of firebases along a backbone of mountains stretching south-west from Tân Cảnh Base Camp towards Kontum nicknamed Rocket Ridge. In the first week of March another Airborne Brigade and the Division's tactical command post were deployed to defend Kontum city and the south of Kontum Province, these were the last available reserves in South Vietnam. On the morning of 3 April Firebase Delta 25km northwest of Kontum, defended by one company of Airborne and one of Rangers came under attack by the PAVN 52nd Regiment, the assault was repulsed using intensive tactical airstrikes and the PAVN suffered 353 killed. On 21 April the PAVN launched an assault on Firebase Delta by 3 tanks supported by infantry and by the evening had succeeded in overrunning the base. From 23 to 24 April the PAVN overran the main ARVN bases at Tân Cảnh and Đắk Tô Base Camp. With the loss of these camps, the remaining firebases along Rocket Ridge were abandoned and the PAVN had a clear approach to Kontum. During the Battle of An Lộc on 15 April 1972, the 1st Airborne Brigade was lifted by helicopters into An Lộc to support the besieged garrison. After the initial direct assaults on the town had been repulsed, the PAVN bombarded the town and gradually reduced the defensive line, while all the time being battered by US and South Vietnamese airstrikes. On 11 May the PAVN 5th and 9th Divisions launched a massive all- out infantry and armor assault on An Lộc, suffering severe losses to airstrikes but further squeezing the defenders. Another assault on 12 May failed to take the city. The PAVN launched a final attack on 19 May in honor of Ho Chi Minh's birthday. The attack was broken up by U.S. air support and an ambush by the Airborne. After the attacks of 11 and 12 May the PAVN directed its main efforts to cut off any more relief columns. However, by 9 June this proved ineffective, and the defenders were able to receive the injection of manpower and supplies needed to sweep the surrounding area of PAVN and by 18 June the battle was over and the 1st Airborne Brigade was released to Division command. Following the defeat of the ARVN in Quảng Trị Province in the initial phase of the Easter Offensive, on 2 May 1972 the remnants of the 3rd Division, the 147th and 258th Marine Brigades and the 1st Division established a new defensive line along the My Chanh River north of Huế. On 3 May I Corps commander General Hoàng Xuân Lãm was replaced by Lieutenant General Ngô Quang Trưởng, commander of IV Corps and this change of command and reinforcement by forces of the general reserve stabilized the ARVN position in Thừa Thiên Province. The remained of the Marine Division was deployed to Huế and was given responsibility for north and northwest Thừa Thiên Province, while the 1st Division was given responsibility for the area southwest and south of Huế blocking any further PAVN advance from the A Sầu Valley. On 8 May the 2nd Airborne Brigade arrived at Huế and came under the operational control of the Marine Division on the My Chanh Line. The entire Division arrived in late May and was given responsibility for a sector between the Marine Division and the 1st Division. From 11 to 18 June the Division and the Marine Division conducted probing attacks to test PAVN strength ahead of the launch of General Trưởng's Operation Lam Son 72 to recapture Quảng Trị Province. The operational plan called for the Airborne and Marine Divisions to advance abreast to the northwest to the Thạch Hãn River. The Division would deploy to the west from the foothills to Highway 1, while the Marine Division would deploy to the east from Highway 1 to the coast. Quảng Trị City would be in the Division's operational area, but the plan called for the city to be bypassed so as to concentrate on the destruction of PAVN forces. On 28 June the South Vietnamese advance began and quickly ran into strong PAVN resistance and helicopter assaults were launched to land troops behind PAVN positions. By 7 July the Division had reached the southern outskirts of Quảng Trị City, but then- President Thieu intervened in the operation. Trưởng had planned to bypass the city and push on quickly to the Cua Viet River, thereby isolating any PAVN defenders. Thiệu, however, now demanded that Quảng Trị be taken immediately, seeing the city as \\"a symbol and a challenge\\" to his authority. The Division's assault bogged down in the outskirts and the PAVN, apprised of the plans for the offensive, moving the 304th and 308th Divisions to the west to avoid the U.S. airpower that was about to be unleashed upon Quảng Trị. On 27 July, the Marine Division was ordered to relieve the Division as the lead element in the battle. The citadel was finally captured on 15 September. In 1972 President Thiệu finally moved General Đống out of the Division which he had commanded since September 1964, appointing him to command the Capital Military District and replacing him with General Le Quang Luong who had performed well at An Lộc. From August to 3 November 1974 the 1st and 3rd Airborne Brigades fought the PAVN 304th Division in the Battle of Thượng Đức. The Airborne lost 500 dead and more than 2,000 wounded, severely weakening the strength of this elite unit at a crucial time, while PAVN casualties were estimated to exceed 7,000 and the 304th Division was rendered combat ineffective. 1975 In late December 1974 General Trưởng took advantage of the temporary calm to pull the 2nd Airborne Brigade out of the line west of Huế, placing it in reserve in Phú Lộc District. The initial PAVN attacks in Quảng Trị Province struck Regional Force outposts and strongpoints in the foothills and the hamlets of the coastal lowlands. By 8 March, PAVN and local VC were in control of seven hamlets in Hải Lăng District and in southern Quảng Trị and northern Thừa Thiên Provinces, and refugees streamed southward, until nearly the entire population of Quảng Trị Province, as many as 100,000, traveled the road to Huế. With tanks and armored personnel carriers, an ARVN task force composed of the 8th Airborne Battalion, the 112th and 120th RF Battalions, and the 921st RF Company, succeeded in driving the enemy from nearly all populated areas by afternoon on 9 March. PAVN/VC casualties were heavy and ARVN losses few in this opening phase. On 11 March a battalion of the PAVN 6th Regiment infiltrated through Phú Lộc, and two of its companies seized 12 fishing boats, which ferried them across Dam Cau Hai Bay to Vinh Loc Island. There they attacked Vinh Hien Village on the southern tip of the island and swept north to attack Vinh Giang. Some of the battalion pushed into Phu Thu District east of Huế. The 8th Airborne Battalion, reinforced with two companies of the 1st Battalion, 54th Infantry, and a troop of armored cavalry, moved against the PAVN battalion and badly mauled and dispersed it. On the same day, PAVN artillery-supported infantry assaults were launched against the 3rd Division, Airborne Division and territorial positions from Đại Lộc to Quế Sơn. Nearly all these assaults were repelled with heavy PAVN losses. On 12 March, General Trưởng received the JGS order to pull the Airborne Division out of the line and start it moving to Saigon. The deployment was to begin on 17 March. General Trưởng immediately called General Viên to protest the decision but learned that President Thieu had personally directed the deployment so that the Airborne Division could participate in the offensive to retake Ban Me Thuot. General Viên told General Trưởng that, if possible, two battalions of the new 468th Marine Brigade and a Ranger group would be sent north to replace the Airborne Division. To adjust to the loss of the Airborne Division, General Trưởng decided to pull the Marine Division out of Quảng Trị and northern Thua Thien Provinces and shift it south to cover Phú Lộc District and Da Nang. I Corps was to defend Huế and Da Nang, even if it had to give up Quang Tri, Quang Tin, and Quang Ngai Provinces. General Trưởng and General Thi agreed, however, that their ability to hold Huế after the Marine Division moved south was questionable indeed. General Truong flew to Saigon on 13 March to participate in a secret meeting with President Thiệu, Prime Minister Trần Thiện Khiêm and General Viên during which Trưởng was told about the evacuation from the Central Highlands and ordered to prepare a plan for the eventual evacuation of I Corps. He also was permitted to delay the first airborne brigade's departure to 18 March and the rest of the division until 31 March. Thiệu's reasoning was that Da Nang was most important, but that the rest of the region could be sacrificed. He would send the 468th Marine Brigade north to help defend Da Nang as soon as the Airborne Division arrived in Saigon. This division was vital to the defense of III and IV Corps, without which South Vietnam could no longer survive. On 15 March, the 14th Ranger Group was to begin the relief of the 369th Marine Brigade in Quảng Trị Province. While one marine brigade would remain in the Song Bo Valley for the defense of Hue, the 369th Marine Brigade would deploy to Đại Lộc District in Quảng Nam Province, and relieve the 3rd Airborne Brigade for movement to Saigon. On 17 March the 258th Marine Brigade pulled out of Quảng Trị to relieve the 2nd Airborne Brigade in southern Thừa Thiên and on 18 March the 2nd Airborne Brigade moved to the Da Nang docks for shipment to Saigon. While the entire division was to move the Saigon, the 3rd Airborne Brigade was diverted at Nha Trang and sent to support the 23rd Division blocking the PAVN advance at Khanh Duong.The 3rd Airborne Brigade dug in on the high ground in the Cả Pass, behind the 40th Regiment. When the PAVN 10th Division supported by tanks forced their way through the 40th Regiment at Khanh Duong the Airborne held their positions. On 30 March the PAVN 10th Division supported by the 40th Artillery Regiment and with two companies of tanks attached, attacked the Airborne positions. On 31 March elements of the 28th and 66th Regiments, the next day surrounded the 5th Airborne Battalion which was reduced by casualties to 20 percent strength. The 3rd Airborne Brigade was deployed in depth from Chu Kroa Mountain south for about 15km along the high ground over the Route 21. Heavy PAVN fire knocked out 5 of 14 armored personnel carriers supporting the brigade, and the three 105mm. howitzer batteries in the force had to move to the rear, setting up near Buon Ea Thi, beyond supporting range of the forward Airborne positions. The collapse of the Airborne defense proceeded very rapidly afterward. At Buon Ea Thi elements of the 10th Division outflanked Airborne positions along the road and struck the 6th Airborne Battalion. Although the troopers knocked out three T-54 tanks, they could not hold. With the brigade split at Buon Ea Thi, a rapid withdrawal was imperative to conserve what was left of the decimated force. The 3rd Airborne Brigade, less than one-fourth of its soldiers still in ranks, marched back through Dục Mỹ Camp and Ninh Hòa and stopped in a narrow defile where Route 1 edged along the beach below Han Son Mountain, just north of Nha Trang with the 10th Division close behind. On 1 April, PAVN tanks rolled through Dục Mỹ and Ninh Hòa and headed for Nha Trang. The II Corps staff drove south to Phan Rang Air Base, the defeated remnants of the Airborne, Rangers, Regional and Popular Forces, and 40th Regiment followed. The RVNAF evacuated Nha Trang Air Base at 15:00 and all flyable aircraft were flown out. On the morning of 3 April the RVNAF at Phan Rang launched a heliborne operation comprising more than 40 UH-1s and 6 CH-47s escorted by A-37s to rescue the remnants of the 2nd, 5th and 6th Airborne Battalions that had been cut off at the M'Đrăk Pass successfully evacuating over 800 soldiers. From 7 to 8 April the 2nd Airborne Brigade flew into Phan Rang to replace the remnants of the 3rd Airborne Brigade which moved back to Saigon. On 8 April the 3rd Airborne Battalion cleared Highway 1 and recaptured the villages of Bà Râu () and Ba Thap () from the VC and the 11th Airborne Battalion then deployed by helicopters to recapture Du Long town () and the Du Long Pass (), meanwhile the 5th Airborne Battalion secured the area around Phan Rang AB and cleared Route 11. On 11 April the 5th Airborne Battalion was withdrawn to Saigon and on 12 April the rest of the 2nd Airborne Brigade was ordered to withdraw to Saigon. On 13 April the 31st Rangers arrived by air from Bien Hoa while the ARVN 4th and 5th Regiments of the reformed 2nd Division arrived by road from Phan Thiết to replace the Airborne. The 31st Rangers deployed to Du Long to replace the 11th Airborne Battalion on the evening of 13 April. The PAVN meanwhile had decided to eliminate Phan Rang and at 05:30 on 14 April the PAVN 3rd Division began an artillery attack on the 31st Rangers at Du Long Pass and the 3rd Airborne at Bà Râu. At 06:30 PAVN tanks and infantry attacked to 31st Rangers' position but were forced back. At 07:00 2 A-37s accidentally bombed the Rangers. The PAVN then bypassed the Rangers and attacked Du Long Town quickly defeating the Regional Forces there and outflanking the 31st Rangers at the pass. Reinforcements from the 52nd Rangers were sent to support the 31st Rangers but they were unable to break through and at 16:00 the 31st Rangers were ordered to withdraw with only 80 Rangers successfully returning to Phan Rang AB. At the same time as the attack on Du Long, the PAVN 25th Regiment infiltrated to attack Phan Rang AB. Despite helicopter gunship fire they successfully penetrated the base and headed for the hangar area where they were met by the 11th Airborne Battalion awaiting transport back to Saigon and 4 M113 armored personnel carriers which together with air support from the helicopter gunships and A-37s forced the PAVN back outside the perimeter, killing over 100 for the loss of 6 ARVN killed and 1 M113 destroyed. At dawn on 15 April the PAVN shelled the 3rd Airborne Battalion at Bà Râu and Kien Kien () on Route 1 and then attacked their position. Although outnumbered, the Airborne held back the assault until midday when it blew the highway bridge and then withdrew onto Ca Dau mountain to the east. At 02:00 on 16 April an RVNAF EC-47 intercepted a PAVN radio transmission indicating an armored attack on Phan Rang would start at 05:00. A-37 aircraft were launched to attack PAVN positions along Route 1 and at 03:00 reconnaissance reported a large PAVN force moving through the Du Long Pass. Meanwhile, VC forces began attacking the base perimeter and on Ca Dau Mountain. At 05:00 the PAVN artillery bombardment commenced and this was soon followed by an armored spearhead of 20 tanks and armored personnel carriers of the 4th Battalion, 203rd Tank Brigade supported by truck-mounted infantry of the 101st Regiment and anti-aircraft guns. While the lead tank was destroyed by an ARVN rocket, the PAVN force quickly cut through the 3rd Airborne platoon holding Kien Kien. The RVNAF at the base mounted numerous airstrikes on the armored column destroying vehicles, taking losses from the antiaircraft fire and by 08:00 the armored vehicles were on the outskirts of the city. However the truck-mounted infantry had dispersed to avoid the airstrikes and the anti-aircraft vehicles had not kept up with the advance, leaving the 101st Regiment vulnerable to further air attacks which destroyed or damaged another 16 vehicles and killing numerous PAVN soldiers. The PAVN 3rd Division then attacked the Airborne troops on Ca Dau Mountain and allowed the 101st Regiment to resume its advance. After overcoming a Regional Force roadblock on the outskirts of the city for the loss of 2 tanks and many infantry, the PAVN pushed into the city capturing the Provincial Headquarters. By 09:30 the PAVN had captured the port and a bridge on Route 1 south of the city sealing off all sea and land escape routes. At 08:45 a battalion-sized PAVN mechanized force attacked along Route 11 towards the base. While one element attacked the 5th Regiment defending Route 11, the other moved around it to attack the base directly and at the same time, the 25th Regiment attacked the north of the base. The 5th Regiment soon broke and ran allowing the PAVN to attack the base's main gate while the 25th Regiment penetrated the north perimeter with explosives and captured the bomb storage area. The Airborne attempted a counterattack against the 25th Regiment but were forced back and then squeezed between the PAVN and by 09:30 the PAVN had captured the base. LG Nghi ordered his remaining forces to retreat from the base to the Ca Na peninsula () south of the base and after cutting through the perimeter fence a large group of RVNAF, ARVN, and South Vietnamese civilians fled the base joining up with the 11th Airborne outside the base. At midnight on 17 April, the Airborne attacked a PAVN force on Route 11, but in the confusion of the attack LG Nghi and his command group became separated and at 02:00 were captured by the PAVN. On 11 April the 1st Airborne Brigade was deployed south of Xuân Lộc District and began moving north to support the 18th Division fighting the Battle of Xuân Lộc. The Brigade made slow progress against a determined PAVN defense and on 19 April the JGS ordered that a general withdrawal from Xuân Lộc. The Brigade withdrew through the plantations and jungles toward Bà Rịa in Phước Tuy Province, where it would defend until South Vietnam capitulated.

About 1,000 American airborne-qualified advisors served with the Brigade and Division, receiving on average two awards for valor per tour; over the years, they were able to build and maintain a good working relationship with their Vietnamese counterparts and airborne units, a situation unfortunately not always found in other ARVN formations. U.S. officers were paired with their Vietnamese counterparts, from the Brigade/Division commander down to company commanders, as well as with principal staff officers at all levels.

The banknote is notable for not being a commemorative banknote under Japanese law, and circulates as a regular issue. History The 2000 yen note was first issued on July 19, 2000 under the \\"D Series\\". Design The design is similar of that of the other Japanese notes in circulation at the time of issue. The obverse has a serial number and depicts Shureimon, a 16th-century gate at Shuri Castle in Naha, in Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. Cherry blossom and chrysanthemum motifs are part of the linear design work in the background. The reverse side depicts a scene from The Tale of Genji, and a portrait of Murasaki Shikibu, the noblewoman to whom this work of classic literature has been attributed. A copy of a portion of script from the original work is included. Rarity 2000 yen notes are rarely seen in circulation as few vending machines or ATMs accept the denomination, thus they are described as \\"not convenient\\" by the public. The bills are also a nuisance to cashiers and business owners as many modern cash registers do not have a slot for the denomination. The Bank of Japan has weighed in by giving factors such as the debut of \\"Series E\\" 2004 dated notes which have since entered into circulation. A spokesperson for the bank stated in 2006 that “I think people prefer to hold on to the newer bank notes”, which lowered the demand for the older notes. It was reported in 2019 that The Bank of Japan continues to hold large amounts of 2000 yen notes in reserve, and no new notes of this denomination are currently being printed. The note does enjoy some popularity in Okinawa due to the representation of Shureimon on the note's obverse; some ATMs allow users to specifically withdraw 2000 yen notes in addition to other denominations. Collectors have since taken notice of their rarity in circulation as \\"2000 yen\\" notes trade for roughly 1.5x their face value in online sales depending on condition.

A single-engined pusher biplane of 1917, the F.E.9 had poor performance and handling, and only three were built. Development and design In summer 1916, the Royal Aircraft Factory set out to design a replacement for its F.E.2 two-seat pusher fighter. Although effective gun synchronising gear was now available, which would allow a tractor design with superior performance to be designed, the factory chose to continue the pusher layout of the F.E.2 in its new two-seat fighter, the F.E.9. Its nacelle extended well forward of the wings and was located high up in the wing gap to give a good field of fire for the observer, who was seated in the nose, ahead of the pilot, with dual controls fitted. It had unequal span, single-bay wings, with ailerons on the upper wing only with large horn balances (the amount of control surface forward of the hinge).Bruce 1968, pp. 59–60. It was powered by a 200 hp (149 kW) Hispano-Suiza 8 V8 engine, with the Royal Aircraft Factory having priority for this important and widely used engine.Mason 1992, p. 89. Three prototypes and 24 production aircraft were ordered, with the first of three prototypes flying in April 1917.Bruce 1968, p. 60. It was found to have a poor climb performance and handling, with the ailerons being overbalanced, which tended to force the aircraft onto its back in steep turns. To try to solve its handling problems it was fitted with various designs of aileron and rudders.Bruce 1968, p. 61. After service trials of the first prototype in France, Major General Hugh Trenchard recommended that development be stopped, despite this the second prototype flew in October 1917, with two-bay wings, which was passed to No. 78 Squadron based at Biggin Hill in the Home Defence role. The third prototype appeared in November 1917, and was used for trials at Farnborough until early 1918.Bruce 1968, pp. 61–62. Although the 24 production aircraft were not completed, the F.E.9 did form the basis for the later N.E.1 night fighter and A.E.3 Ram ground attack aircraft.Bruce 1968, p. 62.

Morphology Shells of geisonoceratids are orthoconic or cyrtoconic, that is long and either straight or curved, with a subcircular cross section. The siphuncle, which varies in position from central to subventral, is composed of generally short, straight to slightly curved, orthochoanitic to subchoanitic, septal necks and thin connecting rings that may expand slightly into the chambers. Organic deposits that are formed within consist of either ring-like annuli restricted to the septal openings or which extend toward the front along the next connecting ring. In advanced species these may form a continuous lining. Cameral deposits, which are generally well developed, are formed along the front and backside of the septa, referred to as episeptal and hyposeptal. Surface modifications found in some include transverse annulations or transverse and sometimes also longitudinal striae and/or lirae.

His career, centered on the evidence-based treatment of addiction, focused on scientific approaches in place of punishment and moralisms. His career focused on pathology of addiction to help patients reduce the severe discomforts of withdrawal, avoid relapse and stay in recovery. Early life Kleber was born June 19, 1934, in Pittsburgh. Both of his parents were eastern-European Jewish immigrants. His father, Max Kleber, was a trained pharmacist who made his career in his family-owned luggage manufacturing business. His mother, Doethea (Schulman) Kleber, was active in fund raising for Israel. Kleber attended Dartmouth College and received medical training at Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia. He then served his residency at Yale-New Haven Hospital. He entered the U.S. Public Health Service in 1964, and was disappointed when he was assigned for two years to the health service hospital in Lexington, Kentucky. Much of the patient population at Lexington were addicts (programs at Lexington later became the basis for the National Institute on Drug Abuse). Although Kleber wanted a regular psychiatry practice, because of his experience at Lexington, he found himself in demand for treatment of addiction when he returned to Yale. Career In 1968, he founded the Drug Dependence Unit at Yale University, where he was a professor of psychiatry; he headed the Unit until 1989. He then served for two and a half years as the Deputy Director for Demand Reduction at the Office of National Drug Control Policy in the White House. Kleber's work promoted scientific research into the causes and treatments of addiction. He rejected an earlier common moralistic approach to treatment. Kleber viewed substance use disorders as diseases rather than moral failings and stressed the importance of research in treatment. He was a leader in reframing addiction treatment as a medical discipline and advocated for the use of medications as well as therapeutic communities in maintaining recovery and reducing rates of relapse. He focused on developing program which was individualized, and not \\"one size fits all\\" approach as some addicts may psychological problems, or have no vocational skills. In 1992, Kleber, with his wife Marian Fischman, co-founded the Substance Abuse Division, one of the leading centers in the country for treatment of such abuse, within the Department of Psychiatry at Columbia University. He was director of the Division, and headed a number of projects on new methods to treat individuals with cocaine, heroin, prescription opioid, alcohol, or marijuana addictions. He also co-founded the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia with Joseph Califano. A 2014 article in Vice said that Kleber served as a paid consultant to the opioid pharmaceutical industry. Kleber was author or co-author of more than 250 papers, and the co-editor of the American Psychiatric Press Textbook of Substance Abuse Treatment, now in its fourth edition. He received numerous prestigious awards and two honorary degrees. He was elected in 1996 as a member of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences. He was on the boards of a number of organizations, including the Partnership for a Drug-Free America, the Treatment Research Institute at the University of Pennsylvania, and the Betty Ford Center. Personal life Kleber married Joan Fox, his high school sweetheart, in 1956. They raised three children together and later divorced. Kleber then married drug addiction researcher Marian Fischman, who died in 2001. He was married to photographer Anne Burlock Lawver from 2004 until his death from heart failure on October 5, 2018, while vacationing with his family in Greece. In popular culture On October 1, 2019, Google honored Kleber by celebrating the 23rd anniversary of his election to the National Academy of Medicine with a Google Doodle.

He is the author of the book De kalder mig terrorist (They call me Terrorist). He claims to have been involved in a 14-year journey from 1982 that involved building schools in Guatemala, agricultural projects in India and attending tiger conferences in Russia. He is currently the manager of a company which sells houseboats. Terrorism claims Holck is the prime accused in Purulia ammunition dropping case. He was given a red corner notice by Interpol. Around 1995 he was involved in humanitarian work for the people in West Bengal, which at that time was governed by the Communist Party of India. The authorities claim that he was involved in smuggling of weapons. He admits as much himself in his book They Call me A Terrorist, claiming that he made the weapon drop from a plane purchased in Latvia. Apparently his motives were to help the local communities in West Bengal fight the oppression brought on them by their government. A total of 4 tonnes of arms were trafficked during his dealings in West Bengal. Additionally, in 2010 Danish police confiscated two forged and expired passports with British names and the photo of Niels whilst searching his home. In 2002 the Justice Minister Lene Espersen stated that he could not face extradition. As of 2009 he is considered the second Dane together with Camilla Broe at risk of being extradited to a country outside the European Union where he faces a possible death sentence. Camilla Broe was indicted for the importation of narcotics into the United States and while extradited and delivered to US custody was later returned to Denmark when the statute of limitations barred an expeditious trial.Camilla Broe Acquitted but Stuck in the US On 9 April 2010, Danish police arrested him in order to start an extradition trial.Skal straffes i Indien, Jan Lauridtsen, BT, April 9, 2010 Based on experiences from the fiasco in the Camilla Broe case the prosecution will demand detention but will accept a confiscation of his passport(s) if the court feels that the rather lengthy extradition process will prevent him from keeping contact with his family.

The screenplay by Joseph A. Fields and Jerome Chodorov is based on their 1940 play of the same title, which was inspired by a series of autobiographical short stories by Ruth McKenney originally published in The New Yorker. The supporting cast features George Tobias, Allyn Joslyn, Grant Mitchell, Gordon Jones and, in a cameo appearance at the end, The Three Stooges (Moe Howard, Larry Fine and Curly Howard). Plot Anxious to help boost the career of her aspiring actress sister Eileen, reporter Ruth Sherwood of the Columbus Courier writes a rave review about her performance in a local play before it opens. When Eileen is replaced on opening night and the newspaper mistakenly runs the inaccurate review, Ruth is fired. Grandma Sherwood urges Ruth to move to New York City and Eileen decides to go with her. Relying solely on $100 given to them by their father Walter for financial support, the girls are forced to rent a dingy basement studio apartment in a Greenwich Village building owned by Mr. Appopolous. Their first day there is disturbed by workmen blasting to build a subway tunnel, passing drunkards harassing them through their windows, and Officer Lonigan, who warns them to stop causing disturbances. The following day, Eileen meets reporter Chic Clark at the Wallace Theatrical Production office, while Ruth seeks employment at Manhatter, where she has an argument with magazine owner Ralph Craven and leaves in a huff. Editor Robert Baker finds the manuscript she accidentally left behind in an envelope bearing her home address, and he decides to deliver it to her. Meanwhile, Ruth arrives home to discover Eileen has invited drugstore clerk Frank Lippincott to dinner. When an inebriated man searching for previous tenant Effie Shelton starts creating trouble, Eileen asks their neighbor, football player Wreck Loomis, to throw him out. Wreck asks if he can stay with the girls while his mother-in-law Mrs. Wade visits because she still does not know her daughter Helen is married. Frank arrives for dinner, followed in quick succession by Chic, Wreck, a man carrying the unconscious Effie, and Robert, who tells Ruth he wants to discuss her manuscript. They go to a nearby restaurant, where he encourages her to write about her eccentric life. He is delighted with the story she submits, but Ralph rejects it, prompting Robert to announce he is quitting. Back at the Sherwood apartment, Effie inadvertently reveals Helen and Wreck are married to Mrs. Wade, who is upset by the news. Ruth receives a call from Chic's editor asking her to go to Brooklyn to cover the arrival of the Portuguese Merchant Marine fleet and, delighted with the assignment, she rushes off. Unbeknownst to her, it actually was Chic who called, hoping his ruse would allow him to spend time with Eileen alone. Robert arrives, rescues Eileen from Chic's unwanted advances, and invites her and Ruth to dinner to celebrate his quitting his job. Robert leaves, and Ruth arrives with the Portuguese Merchant Marines in hot pursuit. The sisters form a Conga line to lure the sailors outside, resulting in a wild party in the street, and Eileen is arrested for disturbing the peace. The following morning, Grandma and Walter Sherwood unexpectedly arrive at the apartment. While Ruth tries to conceal Eileen's predicament from them, Wreck and Helen announce they have remarried to appease Mrs. Wade, Helen casually mentions Wreck has been living with the girls, Eileen and the Merchant Marines arrive, and their commander presents her with a medal for spending the night in jail. Horrified by this seemingly endless parade of odd characters, Mr. Sherwood insists the sisters return home immediately. While Ruth is packing, Robert arrives with a check for $250 as payment for her story, which has been published in the latest issue of Manhatter. Overjoyed, Ruth signs a six-month lease and tells her father she wants to stay in New York. Ralph offers Ruth a contract for her stories, and she agrees on the condition he will introduce Eileen to a few theatre producers. As they leave the apartment to celebrate, a trio of construction workers (The Three Stooges in a cameo appearance) drill through the floor from the new subway tunnel below. The film ends with Curly saying, \\"Hey, Moe. I think you made a wrong turn!\\" Cast *Rosalind Russell as Ruth Sherwood *Brian Aherne as Robert Baker *Janet Blair as Eileen Sherwood *George Tobias as Appopolous *Allyn Joslyn as Chic Clark *Grant Mitchell as Walter Sherwood *Gordon Jones as Wreck Loomis *Elizabeth Patterson as Grandma Sherwood *Richard Quine as Frank Lippincott *June Havoc as Effie Shelton *Donald MacBride as Officer Lonigan *Clyde Fillmore as Ralph Craven *[Miss] Jeff Donnell as Helen Loomis *The Three Stooges: **Moe Howard as Moe (uncredited) **Larry Fine as Larry (uncredited) **Curly Howard as Curly (uncredited) Critical reception Bosley Crowther of The New York Times called the film \\"largely a farcical juggling act in which the authors . . . keep their characters spinning more through speed than grace. Some of it is forced almost to snapping; some of it drags heavily on the screen. And Alexander Hall, the director, did little with his camera in that small room. But Rosalind Russell plays the smart sister with a delightfully dour and cynical air, and Janet Blair is disarmingly naive as the pretty, desirable one . . . My Sister Eileen is gay and bouncing.\\"New York Times review In his review of the DVD release of the film, Steve Daly of Entertainment Weekly graded it B+, calling it \\"a screwball spleenfest, pitching gag after fastball gag.\\" He added, \\"While the tone is farcical, there's an edge to the movie's depiction of single-gal city life.\\"Entertainment Weekly review Awards and nominations Rosalind Russell was nominated for the Academy Award for Best ActressMy Sister Eileen (1942) at Oscar.org but lost to Greer Garson in Mrs. Miniver. Adaptations in other media Aherne, Russell, and Blair reprised their parts on the Lux Radio Theater adaptation of My Sister Eileen on July 5, 1943 and again on The Screen Guild Theater adaptation on October 18, 1943.

The UAE uses the school system as well as censorship and control of the press and the broadcast media to prevent blasphemy. When blasphemy occurs, the Emirates have two court systems to mete out punishment.  The federation  Citizens make up twenty percent of the Emirates' population. Of the citizens, eighty-five percent are Sunni; the remainder are Shia. The Constitution provides for freedom of religion subject to established customs. The school system The Emirates make the study of Islam compulsory in government schools and compulsory for Muslim students in private schools. Children whose passports identify them as Muslim (though their parents may be Baháʼí or Druze) must study Islam. Private schools must not teach subjects or use textbooks that offend Islam, defame any religion, or contravene the country's moral sensibilities. The courts The Emirates have a system of Sharia courts and a system of secular courts. Both systems handle criminal and civil cases. The secular courts are usually part of the federal system and are answerable to the Federal Supreme Court in Abu Dhabi. The Sharia courts are administered by each emirate, but they are answerable to the Federal Supreme Court. The court systems in the emirates of Dubai and Ras al Khaimah are independent of the federal system, but they apply the Civil Procedure Code. Each court system has a multilevel appeals process, and verdicts in all capital cases are appealable to the President. The nature of a case determines which court system hears it, but most cases fall under the jurisdiction of the secular courts. Due-process rights are uniform under both Sharia and civil court procedure. The courts operate on a presumption of innocence. The Federal Supreme Court ruled in 1993 that Sharia punishments may not be imposed on non-Muslims. Extrajudicial punishment of alleged wrongdoers is not unknown. Human rights All English and Arabic newspapers published in the UAE receive government subsidies. Foreign and domestic publications are subject to censorship. The Censorship Department of the Ministry of Information and Culture reviews all imported newspapers, periodicals, books, films, and videos, and bans items considered pornographic, violent, derogatory to Islam, favorable to Israel, unduly critical of friendly countries, or critical of the Government or the ruling family. Religious books and audio/video tapes containing blasphemy are prohibited. The government does not own all the television and radio stations in the UAE, but it ensures that they all further the government's policies. In 2009, the Emirates were considering a media law which would give the government authority to regulate who can work as an editor, reporter, correspondent, or producer in the country. The government blocks access to websites which promote a secular or democratic point of viewhttp://www.anhri.net/en/reports/2008/pr1115.shtml or which do not promote Islam. Selected cases In 1993, after an appeal, two of ten Indian expatriates convicted in 1992 of blasphemy for producing and performing in a play that was critical of Islam and Christianity had their sentences extended from six years to ten years. In 2008, three Filipino workers were jailed in the Emirate of Sharjah allegedly for ripping a page out of the Quran and scribbling on the page. The allegation arose during a dispute between the workers and their employer. The government revoked the workers' permits to work. In 2012, a French businessman was arrested for defacing the Quran by spitting on it before he assaulted and threatened to kill a new British Muslim convert after she refused to marry him. The Frenchman spat on the Quran and insulted Islam and all its prophets. He also threw on the floor a separate book that contained collections of Hadith. He was arrested and jailed for two years.http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/crime/businessman-accused-of-defacing- quran-insulting-islam-1.1080653 See also * Apostasy in Islam * Blasphemy * Blasphemy law * Education in the United Arab Emirates * Human rights in the United Arab Emirates * Irreligion in the United Arab Emirates * Islam and blasphemy * Islam in the United Arab Emirates * Sharia#Democracy and human rights References External links * Government of United Arab Emirates United Arab Emirates United Arab Emirates Category:Crimes in religion Category:Emirati law ","title":"Blasphemy law in the United Arab Emirates"},{"id":"24067684","text":"The ¥1 note is a Japanese banknote from the Bank of Japan (including the silver issue convertible bill).  Overview  The Bank of Japan produced four types of one yen bills: the old gold ¥1 issue, the remodeled ¥1 issue, the standard ¥1 issue, and the A-Series ¥1 bills. Most of the bills were issued before the war, during the war and immediately after the end of World War II (Up until 1951) have been taken out of circulation due to the abolition of the Gold standard, and Japan's system of yen switching. Though, all bills printed by the bank of Japan are still legal tender.

The designer is Edoardo Chiossone of Italy. It is valid today even more than 130 years since the bill was first issued in 1885. There is a character watermark of \\"Bank of Japan Currency\\" (reading from the right to the left with horizontal writing). The rules of conversion are written in Japanese and English (NIPPON GINKO Promises to Pay the Bearer on Demand One Yen in Silver - 此券引きかへ尓銀貨壹圓相渡可申候也). On the bill, the serial number is written using Chinese numerals, and it is the oldest among the still valid currency of Japan. Although it is written as \\"convertible silver certificate\\", it is now handled as an invalid banknote, so it can not be exchanged for silver coins. Although it is legal tender, at present, the bill is usually sold for its monetary value, and is usually traded for tens of thousands of yen, or sometimes, even more (US$95 or greater).

On the bill front of the bill, the rules of conversion are written in Japanese, while the reverse side is written in English (NIPPON GINKO Promises to Pay the Bearer on Demand One Yen in Silver - 此券引きかへ尓銀貨壹圓相渡可申候也). Initially, the serial numbers were written in Chinese Numerals, from 1916, the date was written in Arabic numerals. In 1897, when Japan shifted from a Silver standard to a Gold standard, there was initially going to be a one yen gold coin for conversion, but due to the advent of this not being created, the Remodeled Bill was used instead.

Smith was the first American to participate in a World War II naval victory and is sometimes considered the first American to be directly involved in World War II for his actions. A number of US pilots, who had ferried Catalinas across to the UK and were supposed to familiarize the RAF crews with the plane, were unofficially used as copilots on operations (\\"unofficially\\" because the USA was not at war with Germany at that time). Smith was acting as copilot of AH545 WQ-Z of No. 209 Squadron RAF which had been specifically assigned a search area after contact was lost with the Bismarck shortly after the Battle of the Denmark Strait. They flew out of a flying boat base on Lough Erne and through the Donegal Corridor. The plane was primarily piloted by British Flying Officer Dennis Briggs but Smith was at the controls when the battleship was spotted around at 10:10 on 26 May 1941, heading for Brest. He jettisoned the depth charges and made for cloud cover under heavy anti-aircraft fire, losing sight of the Bismarck and never regaining contact. Two other Americans were also in Catalinas that spotted the Bismarck later in the day: Lt Johnson in M of No. 240 Squadron RAF, and Ensign Rinehart in O of No. 210 Squadron RAF. Knowing the battleship's position accurately enabled the British navy to intercept it and sink it soon after.Kennedy, Ludovic Pursuit: The Sinking of the Bismark, pp. 141ff; 171 and notes, based on an interview with Smith and citing both USN and RN original documents. Smith was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his role in the sinking of the Bismarck. He was later sent to Hawaii, and was flying a training mission between Midway and Pearl Harbor when the base was attacked on the morning of December 7, 1941. He remained in the Pacific Theatre for the remainder of the war, later fought in Korea, reached the rank of captain, and retired from the Navy in 1962. After his retirement he lived in Friday Harbor on San Juan Island, Washington. He died in 2006 at the age of 90.Dwight John Zimmerman, \\"The American Who Helped Sink the Bismarck\\", Defense Media Network, May 8, 2011.

Euphemia was the youngest child of Władysław Odonic and his wife Jadwiga, disputed daughter of Mestwin I, Duke of Pomerania and Swinisław, daughter of Mieszko III the Old. Euphemia's date of birth is unknown. In literature it claims Euphemia was born around 1230. It is most likely she was born between (1226–1230), fitting in with the dates of birth of her siblings and dates of death of her parents.  Marriage  Euphemia and her siblings married well. Her brother Przemysł I of Greater Poland married Elisabeth, daughter of Henry II the Pious. Another brother Bolesław the Pious married Helen, daughter of Béla IV of Hungary. Euphemia's only sister, Salome of Greater Poland married Konrad I, Duke of Silesia-Glogau. Euphemia married in 1251 Władysław Opolski, son of Casimir I of Opole and Viola, Duchess of Opole. The couple were related in the fourth degree, so they needed a papal dispensation in order for the marriage to be considered valid. It is unknown whether the couple got a papal dispensation. The marriage was to help bring closer ties between the two Piast branches and for political reasons to do with Euphemia's brother Przemysł.

It was distributed by La Spirotechnique in Paris from 1960. The camera operates down to 200 feet / 60 metres below sea level. The Calypso was sometimes advertised as the “CALYPSO- PHOT”. Nikon took over production and sold it from 1963 as the Nikonos, which subsequently became a well-known series of underwater cameras. Description The Calypso is equally suitable for water and air environment photography. It consists of two black enameled cast alloy body parts; the one with all the internal parts is lowered into the outer shell. They are locked together when the interchangeable lens is mounted on the camera, and sealed by Vaseline greased O-rings to form a watertight unit. At the top, the Calypso has a built-in optical viewfinder for the 35mm standard lens, and an accessory shoe on the top for separate viewfinders to suit various purposes. The body is covered in a grey sealskin imitation. Two carrying strap attachments doubles as opening levers to be hooked under the top protrusions either side and forced downwards to lift the top out when no lens is mounted on the camera. The most unusual feature is the combined wind-on and shutter release lever. It swings out forward 65 degrees and is operated by the index finger. In the stowed-away position, the shutter is cocked and the film wound on ready for the next picture. A small rocking lever in front of the accessory shoe serves as a shutter-release lock at this stage, it is disengaged by sliding it to the left-hand side. Depressing the lever releases the shutter and it relocates to the 65 degrees standoff position. Depressing the lever again cocks the shutter and winds on the film. At the camera base is a special flash sync connector protected by coin-operated O-ring sealed aluminium plug, as well as an automatic resetting frame counter, visible behind a glass window. No tripod socket is provided. A small rewind knob at the left-hand top is extended for easy access and to engage the film transport mechanism. No rewind release facility is required; a function that was later added to the Nikonos and marked R on the shutter-speed dial. The original lenses are listed below; however all later Nikonos UW-Nikkor lenses are compatible. * SOM Berthiot 1:3.3 f=28 * SOM Berthiot 1:3.5 f=35 * Angénieux 1:2.8 f=45mm The standard SOM BERTHIOT 1:3.5 f=35 (mm) lens is used both underwater and above due to the optical flat protecting front glass, but the lens has no filter thread at the front. Two large aluminium knobs either side of the lens provides aperture and focusing controls. The special Calypso lens mount is of the bayonet variety with an O-ring sealing. The spring action of the O-ring locks the lens in place by two pins engaging in corresponding slots in the periphery of the lens mount. The lens release is accomplished by an outward pull and a quarter turn either way. Inside, the film cassette engages the rewind fork at the top, and it is held in place by a hinged retaining ring at the bottom. The film lead passes under the fixed black film-pressure plate on its way to the slotted large diameter take-up spool. The spool always rotates the same angular amount to advance the film without a sprocket wheel drive. Acceptable frame spacing is accomplished by the large diameter take-up spool that reduces the effect of increasing spool diameter as more film is wound onto it. Variants The vertical running metal-plate focal-plane shutter of the original Calypso has speeds from 1/30 to 1/1000 second, but a year later that was changed to 1/15 to 1/500 second. The camera was very early on advertised, and possibly sold as, the Calypso Phot. In order to reach a larger market the design was sold to Nikon in Japan, and in 1963 released as the Nikonos, subsequently becoming a long-lived series of underwater cameras, culminating with the introduction of the short-lived 35mm SLR Nikonos RS in 1992.

Lisanby (b. ca 1965) is an American psychiatrist who studies the use of neurostimulation devices to treat mental illness. Since 2015 she has directed the division of the National Institute of Mental Health(NIMH) working on translational research. Career Lisanby received dual undergraduate degrees in mathematics and psychology from Duke University in 1987 and received her MD there as well. She completed a residency in psychiatry, serving as chief resident. While she was a resident, she witnessed a woman with catatonic major depressive disorder undergo a dramatic remission after being treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and this set the course for the rest of her career. After she graduated she undertook a fellowship at the New York Psychiatric Institute under Harold A. Sackeim, who had been doing research on ways to reduce the adverse effects of ECT on memory by using magnets to induce seizures in the brain instead of delivering electricity directly, a therapeutic mode called magnetic seizure therapy (MST). He asked her to work on developing a prototype that could do this, and by 2000 she and a team of collaborators had prepared one, and it was tested on a person in Switzerland. She also started investigating transcranial magnetic stimulation with Sackheim at the institute. In 2005 she founded the Division of Brain Stimulation at Columbia University. When Kitty Dukakis published her book about ECT in 2006 and in her subsequent advocacy for ECT, Lisanby has been asked to provide medical commentary on ECT. By 2010 Lisanby had led two scientific societies focused on neurostimulation and had published 150 papers; at that time she moved back to Duke. In 2013 she was involved in some of the early clinical studies of transcranial direct current stimulation. In 2015 she was recruited to NIMH by Thomas Insel. In much of her career she has advocated in public, in the scientific community, in the medical community, and at the FDA to remove the stigma from ECT and to develop MST and other neurostimulation methods.

The entirety of Smith's forty-five-year career was dedicated to the railroads. He started his career as a messenger boy at the age of fourteen, earning 4 dollars a week, and became the highest-paid railroad manager in the U.S., receiving an annual salary of more than $100,000 according to one survey.A. H. Smith Killed by Fall From Horse. The New York Times, March 9, 1924, p. 21 col. 1: \\"From office boy and section hand, Alfred Holland Smith became the highest paid railroad executive in the country. His received a salary of more than $100,000 a year as the President of the New York Central Railroad according to a recent survey of the monetary rewards of railroad executives.\\" After the American entry into World War I, Smith joined the federal service as the Eastern Director of the United States Railroad Administration and temporarily assumed control over the largest pool of railroads in U.S. history, carrying one half of the nation's freight.A. H. Smith Killed by Fall From Horse. The New York Times, March 9, 1924, p. 21 cols. 3-4.: \\"As Eastern Regional Director, Mr. Smith had control for the Government of the largest aggregation of railroads ever put under the operating direction of a single man. His region consisted of more than 100 companies and 80,000 miles of main lines, carrying more than one-half the railroad tonnage of the country.\\" He successfully alleviated traffic congestion and the buildup of Europe-bound cargoes in the docks. Smith spoke and acted in favor of government-sponsored consolidation of American, Canadian and Cuban railroads into larger corporations but opposed direct nationalization of railroads. Smith's last full year with the New York Central Railroad, 1923, was the company's most successful year. On March 8, 1924, before the record profit numbers were published, Smith was killed in a horse riding accident in Central Park. Biography Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Smith was a fifth child in a family. Alfred was fourteen years old when his father died; instead of completing high school and going to college, he had to drop out of school and take care of himself. His first job, that of a messenger boy for the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway offices in Cleveland, paid four dollars a week.A. H. Smith Killed by Fall From Horse. The New York Times, March 9, 1924, p. 21 col. 1. Promotions within the office did not encourage him enough, and five years later Smith transferred to a railroad construction crew in Toledo, Ohio, area, paid $1.50 a day.A. H. Smith Killed by Fall From Horse. The New York Times, March 9, 1924, p. 21 col. 2. The change from an office job to physical work was not easy for Smith, but he eventually developed \\"a physique which was the marvel of railroad men who learned their job only in the office.\\" Later in life his associates noted that Smith \\"did not know the meaning of the word fatigue.\\"A. H. Smith Killed by Fall From Horse. The New York Times, March 9, 1924, p. 21 col. 6. Smith's proficiency in both physical labor and clerical work led to his promotion to a foreman. In 1890, after eleven years with Lake Shore and Michigan, he became a superintendent for Kalamazoo, Michigan, division.A. H. Smith Killed by Fall From Horse. The New York Times, March 9, 1924, p. 21 col. 3. He spent the 1890s supervising different construction teams of Lake Shore and Michigan, and in 1901 became the principal construction superintendent for the railroad, based in Cleveland. Career in New York Central In 1902 Smith transferred to New York Central & Hudson River Railroad (a division of New York Central Railroad) as General Superintendent. In the next year he became General Manager for this division. In 1912, after nine years of service and a few career moves Smith was appointed VP for New York Central Lines east and west of Buffalo. On January 1, 1914 Smith succeeded William C. Brown as the President of the company. His first reign as the President was marked by the reconstruction of the subordinate lines of New York Central and bringing these troubled lines to profitability. Advisor to Canada On July 13, 1916, Smith, Henry Lumley Drayton and William Mitchell Acworth were appointed to the Royal Commission formed by the Governor General of Canada to examine Canada's railway system.Fournier, p. 51. The three commissioners agreed on their assessment of preexisting conditions, that of excessive government aid and overdevelopment of railway lines that undermined their performance, but split on the future role of the government in reforming the system.Fournier, pp. 51-52. In 1916 Canada had 1 mile of railway per 185 persons, compared to 1:400 for the United States. Drayton and Acworth called for the nationalization of three principal Canadian railroads (Grand Trunk Railway, Grand Trunk Pacific Railway and Canadian Northern Railway) and argued that the expense of tax dollars was in the best interest of the Canadian nation.Fournier, p. 57. They insisted on separation of business from politics through an elaborate corporate government scheme.Fournier, pp. 58-61. Smith opposed nationalization. His 1917 minority report noted that no legal safeguard can prevent the parliament from changing its mind and taking direct control of the nationalized assets.Fournier, p. 61. Smith analyzed each railroad and found that each one had a healthy, profitable component.Fournier, p. 62. He advised stripping the railroads of redundant, loss-making lines through exchange or closure: \\"The scrap heap is frequently the most economical disposition available for inefficient plant and machinery.\\" The role of the government, wrote Smith, must be limited to that of a regulator and a clearing house. Smith's plan, \\"in all probability, would have saved the country a great many millions of dollars\\" but the government of Canada settled for nationalization along the lines of Drayton-Acworth report.Fournier, p. 63. Federal service In the very end of 1917 William Gibbs McAdoo, head of the United States Railroad Administration, appointed Smith as Assistant Director for the north-eastern quadrant of the United States (east of Chicago and north of the Ohio and the Potomac rivers); in January 1918 Smith became Director of Eastern District of the Federal Railroad Administration. He did not formally resign as President of the New York Central until requested by McAdoo in May 1918. According to The New York Times, Smith had consolidated the largest pool of railroads in the United States history to this date, which carried over half of national freight tonnage over 80,000 miles of main lines.A. H. Smith Killed by Fall From Horse. The New York Times, March 9, 1924, p. 21 col. 4. In 1917 the railroad system faced a severe freight congestion, aggravated by shortage of coal and a streak of bad weather. Smith, as a federal administrator, had to untie the congestion that threatened to halt shipping in the Eastern states and resupply of the American Expeditionary Forces. Smith imposed a temporary embargo on new shipments, which reduced the pressure on the system. On the receiving end he imposed heavy demurrage penalties against idle cargoes that clogged rolling stock and marshalling yards. As a practical railroad man he persuaded the Federal Government to abolish its priority order system which, in his opinion, was the major contributor to congestion. Another problem, that of Europe-bound ships waiting too long at the piers for their cargoes, was solved by a mandatory policy of forming unit trains and a takeover of private piers by federal authority. When the ice in New York Harbor put the system on the verge of collapse, Smith successfully persuaded the United States Navy to break all regulations and send its ships to clear the harbour. He dispatched harbor tugs to clear the Kill Van Kull, personally hired icebreaking steamer SS Florizel and guaranteed its insurance risks out of his own pocket. Return to New York Central On June 1, 1919 Smith was reelected President of the New York Central.A. H. Smith Killed by Fall From Horse. The New York Times, March 9, 1924, p. 21 col. 5. His first job was to supervise transfer of assets from the federal government back to private ownership. During and after the Great Railroad Strike of 1922 he negotiated labor dispute directly with the unions, \\"virtually ignoring\\" the Railroad Labor Board, the intermediary whose actions provoked the strike.Rail Board Ruling Hit by A. H. Smith. The New York Times, March 23, 1923. Smith approved the improvements brought by the Transportation Act of 1920, but spoke against any further restriction by the government. He, however, welcomed the new plans to consolidate smaller railroads under control of New York Central and in the end of 1923 actually consolidated operations of the Lehigh Valley Railroad, the Erie Railroad and the New York, Ontario and Western Railway over the Belt Line 13 in New Jersey.A Railroad Judge Landis. Three Lines Name Overseer as Step Toward Unification. The New York Times, September 19, 1923. A critical observer from The New Republic wrote about Smith's take on the federal effort to optimize the system: \\"Mr. Smith's ideas, boiled down, show a maximum of thought about New York Central and a minimum, and a very small one at that, about the consolidation scheme – whether it is sound or unsound, right or wrong.\\"As cited in Rose et al., p. 22. Smith the competitor was noted for his fierce rivalry with the Pennsylvania Railroad and for his business alliance with the Cleveland-based Van Sweringen brothers.Rose, p. 252. In the beginning of 1924 Smith spent several weeks in Cuba inspecting the Cuban railroads that were being consolidated into a single corporation under the Tarafa Bill. Smith was to be appointed Chairman of the Board of the new Cuban company. His own railroad showed strong performance, and the 1923 turned out its best year ever.New York Central Has Greatest Year. The New York Times, May 28, 1924. According to the annual report authored by Smith and released after his death, net income in 1923 increased by 120% compared to 1922. The gain was attributed to an increase in sales, mostly for freight transportation. Smith also elaborated on three investment projects: the proposed acquisition of the Central Railroad of New Jersey, the already one-half completed Castleton cut- off, and the future redevelopment of Manhattan's West Side Line in line with the 1923 Kaufman Act. Smith's full-length portrait was painted by the Swiss- born American artist Adolfo Muller-Ury (1862–1947) together with that of his granddaughter Charlotte, a horse and dog, at the end of 1921 and early 1922, and was intended for an overmantel at his mansion at Chappaqua.American Art News, New York, January 28, 1922, Vol. XX, No. 16 Death The gravesite of Alfred Holland Smith According to the New York Times obituary, \\"horseback riding was Mr. Smiths's hobby and practically his only form of outdoor exercise ... He liked golf, tennis and baseball but did not have enough time\\" for these sports. In the afternoon of March 8, 1924, Smith and his freight manager Edward Hoopes mounted their horses for a regular ride through Central Park. Both were expert riders and regular companions. They started from Smith's residence at the Plaza Hotel and rode together for more than two hours; Smith had already changed his mount. The two were riding near the 67th Street intersection when a woman on a horse crossed into their path. According to Hooper's testimony Smith pulled sharply on the reins, lost his balance, grabbed the horses's neck and fell on the ground head-on. The woman left the scene, her name remained unknown. Hoopes, unaware that the neck injury was fatal, rushed to Smith and screamed for help. Another woman volunteered to drive Smith to the Fifth Avenue Hospital. He was pronounced dead on arrival; the doctors believed that the death was instant or practically instant. Smith was survived by his widow and son Emory, who had a ten-year-old daughter.Woman Rider in His Path. The New York Times, March 9, 1924, p. 1. Memorial services for Smith were held at his estate in Chappaqua and at the Saint Thomas Church on the 53rd Street. Police commissioner Enright, Smith's long-time friend, provided motorcycle escorts to the funeral motorcade.To Bury A. H. Smith. The New York Times. March 11, 1924. Smith was buried at the Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla, New York. The Alfred H. Smith Memorial Bridge between Castleton-on- Hudson and Selkirk, opened in 1924 after his death, is named for him.

The consort system was used in the Great Lakes from the 1860s to around 1920. Mariner and historian Mark Thompson wrote that the unpowered barges were \\"uninspected vessels\\" not regulated by the marine safety laws. He reported that between 1870 and 1940, the dangerous practice of towing unpowered vessels resulted in many of the most serious groundings when they broke loose or were cut loose during storms. Consort is also used as the term for any ship sailing alongside another, particularly as an escort or ship's tender. Pirates who sailed in small fleets were often described as sailing \\"in consort\\" to one another, that is, one ship following or escorting another to whom it was allied; for example; Thomas Howard's Prosperous and John Bowen's Speedy Return: :\\"The Speedy Return sailed with her prize to the Malabar Coast where they had agreed to rendezvous should they accidentally part company.

Sydney Prague were one of the most successful sides of the late 1950s and early 1960s, consistently finishing high in leagues and cups. Prague were one of the first club sides to bring fast, attacking European style play to Australia, due to the influx of European ex-international players to the club in the late 1950s.  History  Prague was the home of many Australian and ex-European representative footballers throughout the 1960s and early 1970s. Prague was instrumental in the strengthening of Australian football throughout its time, and had strong player and coaching links with the Australia national football (soccer) team. In 1950 V J (Jimmy) Chalwin came across a number of Czech boys playing soccer at Rushcutters Bay and ended up playing regularly with them every Sunday afternoon. After a few weeks Jerry Vilimek asked Jimmy Chalwin if he thought they could form a team and enter a competition. On J. Chalwin's initiative a first meeting was held at the Y.M.C.A. and shortly afterwards the Sydney Football Club Prague was formed and two teams were nominated to play in the N.S.W. Metropolitan League. The first general meeting was held in the Premier Restaurant, Kings Cross, and J. Vilimek was elected President; J. Chalwin, Vice-President; V. Profanta, Secretary; J. Baca, Treasurer and W.R. Ball Public Relations Officer. Mr Stan Slavik who provided the first boots, Jerseys and balls was made Patron of the Club. In its first year they almost finished as premiers, being beaten in the final. In 1952 the Club won its first trophy, the Metropolitan Cup and in 1953 they won the Metropolitan League. One of its most notable players was Milos Muller who was a prolific goal scorer and headed the goal-scoring list year after year. He scored a total of 378 goals for his Club and in 1955 scored 55 goals. Milos Muller was Prague's first Australian International when he as a centre-forward was chosen to play in the Australian team to play South Africa at the Sydney Cricket Ground in September 1955. From 1951 to 1953 S.F.C. Prague was basically an all Czech team which included players such as M. Muller, K. Lender, O. Toula, P.Janovsky, V.Vohanka, J Horinek, F. Dubai and J. Polivka. Also in 1953 the Committee was enlarged and Mr K. Rodny became President; Mr Garden, Vice-President; J. Bruna, V. Sarka, Z. Hofer, O. Pick and J. Prazak also joined. Finally in 1955, Prague, after winning the Metropolitan League twice, was promoted to the Southern League, and won it outright by beating Sydney Austral in the final. Prague's first year in the State League was rather disappointing as the team finished near the bottom of the competition although most games were lost by an odd goal. Despite this, the team was enjoying the reputation of being the fairest team in the competition and playing the continental short passing game. In January 1957 Prague, became one of the foundation clubs of the N.S.W. Federation, rebuilt the team, released many players to nearer clubs (without any transfer fees), signed new players such as R. Lord, K.Hiron, E. Schwartz. Also new players like L. Scheinflug and G. Geddes combined well with the rest of the team, where old-timers Muller and Toula still played. Prague gained notable victories against strong clubs like Canterbury, Gladesville and finished the season near the top of the table. In March 1958 Austrian Internationals Leopold Baumgartner and Karl Jaros joined Prague and later they were followed by Andy Saghi, Erich Schwartz, Walter Tamandl, Herbert and Erwin Ninaus. Sydney Football Club Prague souvenir magazine 1950 – 1960  Legacy  Prague were the first Australian side to fully sponsor a tour by an overseas club., in 1964 guaranteeing Swiss champions FC Basel a sum of £1785 in an attempt to persuade Basel's then Czech coach, Georges Sobotka to accept a position at Prague. Although Sobotka went on to coach the Switzerland national football side, the tour was a success, turning over more than £5000 and paving the way for future overseas tours of Australia. The game ended in a 2–2 draw. In 1965, Chelsea F.C. manager and former Scotland international, Tommy Docherty was offered a guest stint with Prague in a friendly against VFB Stuttgart after taking the '64–'65 League cup with Chelsea. Docherty, still a registered player at the time, accepted and was granted permission by Chelsea. Docherty was to return to Sydney in the early 1980s, as coach of Sydney Olympic and South Melbourne. The fixture was deemed a great success, with over 6,000 people cramming ES Marks Athletics Field for a high quality encounter, Stuttgart taking the tie 3–1. In an interesting turn of events, Stuttgart's coach at the time, Rudi Gutendorf returned to Australia four years later and took up a position coaching the national side during Australia's qualification bid for the 1978 World Cup.

Cohousing is a type of intentional community composed of small private homes with full kitchens, supplemented by extensive common facilities. A cohousing community is planned, owned and managed by the residents, groups of people who want more interaction with their neighbours. In recent years he has focused on cohousing for older persons. Durrett and McCamant designed Muir Commons, the first cohousing community in North America, and has designed or consulted on the design of over 50 cohousing communities in North America. He has also consulted on many other cohousing projects around the world. He is a major proponent of senior cohousing, also known as elder cohousing, which are residential communities specifically designed for seniors. There are at least three senior cohousing communities in the U.S., one each in California, Colorado, and Virginia. More are in planning, according to Durrett. According to an American Association of Retired Persons representative, senior cohousing is \\"very interesting niche housing\\" that is needed as an option.

Early Modern Germany, 1477-1806, MacMillan Press and University of Pennsylvania Press, Philadelphia, p. xi. . is the name given by 20th-century historians of German history to the earlier idea that German unification was inevitable, and that it was Prussia's destiny to accomplish it. The Borussian myth is an example of a teleological argument. Borussia is the Latin name for Prussia. Teleological arguments A teleological argument holds all things to be designed for, or directed toward, a specific final result. That specific result gives events and actions, even retrospectively, an inherent purpose. When applied to the historical process, an historical teleological argument posits the result as the inevitable trajectory of a specific set of events. These events lead \\"inevitably,\\" as Karl Marx or Friedrich Engels proposed, to a specific set of conditions or situations; the resolution of those lead to another, and so on. This goal-oriented, 'teleological' notion of the historical process as a whole is present in a variety of arguments about the past: the \\"inevitability,\\" for example, of the revolution of the proletariat and the \\"Whiggish\\" narrative of past as an inevitable progression towards ever greater liberty and enlightenment that culminated in modern forms of liberal democracy and constitutional monarchy.Herbert Butterfield, The Whiggish Interpretation of History, (1931). Spinning the myth The narrative of the heroic past fell to such nationalist German historians as Heinrich von Treitschke (1834–1896), Theodor Mommsen (1817–1903), and Heinrich von Sybel (1817–1895), to name three. Treitschke in particular viewed Prussia as the logical agent of unification.David Blackbourn and Geoff Eley, The peculiarities of German history: bourgeois society and politics in nineteenth- century Germany. Oxford & New York: Oxford University Press, 1984. p. 241. These historical arguments can also be called the grand, or great, narratives but they are inherently ethnocentric, at least when applied to the historical process.Butterfield, 1931. Treitschke's History of Germany in the Nineteenth Century, published in 1879, has perhaps a misleading title: it privileges the history of Prussia over the history of other German states, and it tells the story of the German-speaking peoples through the guise of Prussia's destiny to unite all German states under its leadership. The creation of this myth (Borussia is the Latin name for Prussia) established Prussia as Germany's savior; it was the destiny of all Germans to be united, this myth maintains, and it was Prussia's destiny to accomplish this.Karin Friedrich, The other Prussia: royal Prussia, Poland and liberty, 1569–1772, New York, 2000, p. 5. According to this story, Prussia played the dominant role in bringing the German states together as a nation-state; only Prussia could protect German liberties from being crushed by French or Russian influence. This interpretation emphasizes Prussia's role in saving Germans from the resurgence of Napoleon's power in 1814, at Waterloo, creating some semblance of economic unity through the Zollverein (German customs union), and uniting Germans under one proud flag after the defeat of France in the Franco Prussian War in 1871.Many modern historians describe this myth, without subscribing to it: for example, Rudy Koshar, Germany's Transient Pasts: Preservation and the National Memory in the Twentieth Century. Chapel Hill, 1998; Hans Kohn. German history; some new German views. Boston, 1954; Thomas Nipperdey, Germany history from Napoleon to Bismarck. Deconstructing the myth After World War II, various historians of Germany sought to re-examine the German past, in part to understand the immediate German past and the Holocaust, and in part to understand Germany's supposed democratic deficit: Theoretically, Germans were inexperienced with democracy and self-government because their experience in unification came under the leadership of the least democratic of the German states (Prussia). This inevitably led to, first, World War I, and second the failure of the Weimar Republic, third, to the rise of National Socialism, and fourth, to World War II. The Borussian myth was linked to the Sonderweg theory of Germany's peculiar road to modernity.David Blackbourn and Geoff Eley, Peculiarities of German History, p. 241. The set of circumstances that predated the Unification, for example, the so-called failure of the 1848 German revolutions and the elimination of Austria as a possible leader in the unification process strengthen the myth's appeal. In this way, teleological arguments tend to work backward from an event, to describe and rationalize all trends leading to it;Butterworth, 1931. they are genealogical--trace from the present to the past--rather than historical, which explores the past to the present. In the 1970s, and later, as social and cultural historians examined nineteenth-century German history in greater depth, they realized that not only was there a vibrant and lively German culture without Prussia, but they also deconstructed significant elements of the Sonderweg theory as well. They discovered, for example, that the 1848 Revolutions in Germany actually had some significant successes.Jonathan Sperber, Rhineland radicals: the democratic movement and the revolution of 1848–1849. Princeton, N.J., 1993. Indeed, the history of 19th-century Germany was not a long process of grinding under the heel of Prussian militarism, but instead a process of economic expansion, testing of democratic institutions, the writing and testing of constitutions, and the creation of social insurance systems to maintain long term economic security.David Blackbourn, The long nineteenth century: a history of Germany, 1780–1918.

Constructed in 1924 as the headquarters for the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway and the Southwest's largest merchandising center, three of the original four buildings remain today and have been renovated into various uses. Santa Fe Buildings No. 1 and No. 2 were listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1997, and the buildings are Dallas Landmarks. The Santa Fe Freight Terminal is regarded as one of the chief factors in the development of Dallas commercially.http://atlas.thc.state.tx.us/common/view_narrative.asp?narrative=97000478.htm&title;=Sante%20Fe%20Terminal%20Buildings&filepath;=E:\\\\atlas_text r_listed\\\\html History The site chosen for the terminal complex was already owned by the railroad and served by tracks connecting with the East Dallas GC&SF; yard. The original Santa Fe station in Dallas was built on the site in 1884 and replaced by the 1896 Richardsonian Romanesque passenger station. The latter was one of six depots belonging to different railroads which became redundant with the completion of Union Station in 1916. The depot was razed and a vast, 100,000 cubic yard excavation done with the equivalent of a box car load of dynamite. Project architect Lloyd R. Whitson, working with engineers and railroad planners from the AT&SF;, planned the complex so that four buildings, in a line running north to south from Commerce to Young Streets, could be served by up to three sets of underground railroad tracks branching from a central subsurface line, which emerged from the underground farther south near the present Dallas Convention Center. The complex was constructed in 1924-25 as one of the more ambitious Texas building projects of the 1920s and one of the Southwest's largest merchandising centers. All four buildings were linked by a subterranean rail tunnel served by small steam locomotives. Construction of the buildings and the underground freight house was a massive undertaking and work continued around the clock. Building No. 1, also known as the Santa Fe Office Building, was constructed as the main building at 1114 Commerce Street and opened in late 1924. It contained 20 floors of offices and included a restaurant and drug store, and was the most elaborately decorated building of the complex. The structure featured several setbacks and ornamental arches designed in the Mission Revival style topped by a barrel vaulted roof. The office building provided some of the most desirable office space in Dallas in the 1925-42 period, housing many national corporations and representatives of insurance companies. The rear of the building connected to a 10-story warehouse wing fronting Jackson Street and served as the terminus of the freight depot. Building No. 2, also known as the Garment Center, followed the same design as Building No. 1's warehouse. This structure was built as 10-story warehouses in light brown brick with large open industrial spaces and concrete columns. The building housed offices and showrooms for manufacturing companies, chemical companies, and building supplies. Near the end of construction, a 2-story structure was added on the roof of the building to serve as the clubhouse for the University Club, a major private men's club. A skybridge was erected to connect the member entrance on the eleventh floor of Santa Fe Building No. 1 with the clubhouse. The penthouse included an auditorium/great hall, library and dining room with bedrooms for resident members and nonresident members' guests on the second level. Trees, shrubs and a putting green surrounded the clubhouse. Plans were made to expand the club to the roofs of Buildings No. 1 and No. 3, but the club only used the penthouse until the late 1930s. Radio station WFAA moved into and converted the former University Club space for a broadcast station in 1940. Building No. 3 and Building No. 4 were similar in design to the other warehouses, with each being 8 stories in height and connected to the rail tunnel. Building No. 3, also known as the Ingram Freezer Building, was designed for cold storage. Rail operations Thirty-five to forty rail cars entered the tunnel each day, pulled by a \\"hot water bottle\\" locomotive. It was specially designed to prevent smoke in the main line and its six spurs in the tunnels by being charged with steam, which would last from four to five hours from a central, high pressure boiler under the office building. A 1924 Santa Fe Magazine article called the engine a \\"unique feature in locomotive construction, only one other of its type being in existence.\\" They remained in service until about 1950, when diesel locomotives assumed the duty. Rail cars carried goods into the buildings and then the 21 freight elevators lifted merchandise to upper-level showrooms and first-floor trucking platforms. Change of ownership In 1942 the United States Government acquired Building No. 1 by eminent domain, converting portions of the building to serve as headquarters for the U.S. Army 8th Service Command as well as an enlistment center. Thousands of draftees, after reporting to the enlistment center in Building No. 1, proceeded to platforms beneath the buildings where they boarded trains bound for training centers. Informal sources suggest the building has among the strongest associations with the war effort of any building in North Texas. After the government's acquisition of the complex, the warehouse buildings passed into various ownership. Construction of the nearby Dallas Convention Center severed the link to the main rail lines, and over time the warehouses became vacant. Santa Fe Building No. 3 was demolished in 1988 and replaced with a large parking lot. Santa Fe Buildings No. 1 and No. 2 were listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1997 and renovated over the years, although the isolated No. 4 building remained abandoned for many years. Current use Santa Fe Building No. 1 still houses offices for the federal government, with additional space in the adjacent Earle Cabell Federal Building and Courthouse. Santa Fe Building No. 2 was redeveloped into SoCo Urban lofts. Santa Fe Building No. 4, at the complex's southernmost point, reopened in 2009 as the downtown Dallas Aloft Hotel.http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/localnews/stories/DN- dalhotel_27met.ART.State.Edition1.50adf87.html Remnants of the tunnels still remain in the buildings today.

A branch of the Tanka people, they traditionally lived on sampans in the lower course of Min River and the coast of Fuzhou in Fujian Province most of their lives and have been officially recognized as Han Chinese since 1955.Jian-min Li (李健民), Origin and Migration of Mindong's Fishermen (闽东疍民的由来及历史变迁) , Journal of Ningde Teachers' College, 2009 Vol. 2, pp.38–44 (in Chinese) Origin and etymology The boats of Fuzhou Tanka on an inner river in Fuzhou, circa late 19th to early 20th century. There are several different views on the origin of Fuzhou Tanka. The mainstream theory believes that Fuzhou Tanka are descendants of the Baiyue of ancient times. As a branch of the Tanka people, Fuzhou Tanka has been in South China for more than 2000 years.刘传标,闽江流域疍民的文化习俗形态 (in Chinese) Their Fuzhounese name \\"Kuóh-dà̤\\" (曲 蹄) is a derogatory term used by the Fuzhou people on land, which can be literally translated into \\"bowlegged\\" and might come from the bow shape of their legs caused by longtime living in the low cabins of their boats.Local Annals of Min County (闽县乡土志) (in Chinese)吴高梓：福州疍民调查[J]，社会学界（第四卷），1930 (in Chinese) The Amoy University anthropologist Ling Hui-hsiang wrote on his theory of the Fujian Tanka being descendants of the Baiyue. He claimed that Guangdong and Fujian Tanka are definitely descended from the old Pai Yue peoples, and that they may have been ancestors of the Malay race. Language Fuzhou Tanka now speak the Fuzhou dialect, which is widely used by the majority Fuzhou people in this region. Mandarin has also been brought to many of them through national compulsory education. However, they had their own language in history, but gradually abandoned it. In Ming Dynasty, many of them were already able to speak the Fuzhou dialect or other Eastern Min languages.郭志超, 《闽台民族史辨》, 黄山书社, 2006年 (in Chinese) Society Distribution of the Fuzhou Tanka people in China. Traditionally, Fuzhou Tanka people lived on boats in most of their lives. They were severely discriminated by land living Fuzhounese residents. Their life depended on fishing and ferrying, and most of them remained poor and uneducated before the founding of Republic of China. Fuzhou Tanka people had a rich tradition of folk music, especially call and response. They also had different views on chastity and remarriage from the land living Han Chinese. Pre-marital sex and remarriage were not restricted in their society. Due to the discriminatory policy imposed by the land living Han majority, Fuzhou Tanka were forced to dress themselves in a humble way to show their inferiority to the land residents. By the second half of the 19th century, many Tanka people had already been converted to Roman Catholicism. Some of these Catholic Tanka consequently moved onto land under the protection of the Catholic Church. In the Republic of China era, the ethnic egalitarianism was guaranteed by law. Since the 1950s, the Communist government began to resettle Fuzhou Tanka to land dwellings. As a result, many Fuzhou Tanka villages were built along the Min River and the coast. Nowadays, most Fuzhou Tanka people have abandoned their traditional waterborne lives and intermarriage is common. Their traditions, such as Fuzhou Tanka folk music, are under threat as well.County Annals of Luoyuan (罗源县志)，Fangzhi Publishing House，1998.11， (in Chinese)The Endangered Fuzhou Tanka Folk Music (濒临失传的“福州疍民渔歌”) (in Chinese) Discrimination against Fuzhou Tanka Tanka land dwellings built in the mid 20th century in Luoyuan County, Fuzhou, China. Before the founding of Republic of China, the Fuzhou Tanka were generally treated by land Chinese residents as mean and inferior. They were not allowed to dwell on land, receive education, wear silk clothes or work in government or army. In some areas, they were even forbidden to walk on land, otherwise, they would be faced with death threats. Since the 18th century several attempts had been made by the Qing and Kuomintang governments to lift the discrimination against Tanka people, but it was only in the People's Republic of China era that all the discriminatory policies were completely eliminated. Before the founding of the People's Republic of China, the 'gypsies of the sea' were not allowed to go ashore or marry the people living along the beach. Religion Before the 19th century, many Fuzhou Tanka practiced Taoism, worshiping Mazu, Linshui and other gods and goddesses. In the late 19th century, many Fuzhou Tanka people were converted to Roman Catholicism. Received, protected and assisted by the Roman Catholic Church in Fuzhou through Protectorate of missions, some of them were able to build simple land dwellings. Currently, the majority of Fuzhou Tanka people are Roman Catholic, which constitute a significant portion in Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Fuzhou.Fan Zhengyi, Researching into the Belief of Boatmen in Fujian in Modern Time, Journal of Putian University, 2005 12(6) (in Chinese) Surnames The Fuzhou Tanka have different surnames than the Tanka of Guangdong. Qing records indicate that \\"Weng, Ou, Chi, Pu, Jiang, and Hai\\" (翁, 歐, 池, 浦, 江) were surnames of the Fuzhou Tanka. Qing records also stated that Tanka surnames in Guangdong consisted of \\"Mai, Pu, Wu, Su, and He\\", alternatively some people claimed Gu and Zeng as Tanka surnames.

Reog is one of the performing arts from the northwestern region of East Java and Ponorogo is the region where Reog originated. The city gate of Ponorogo is decorated with warok and gemblak, two characters who were present at the time when Reog is performed. Reog is one of Indonesian culture that is still very strong with mystical elements and mysticism.  History  Reog dancers in Ponorogo, ca. 1920. The dance describe Klono Sewandono the king of Ponorogo on his journey to Kediri to seek the hands of Princess Songgo Langit. On his journey he was attacked by a vicious monster called Singo Barong, a mythical lion with peacock on its head. Historians trace the origin of Reog Ponorogo as the satire on the incompetence of Majapahit rulers during the end of the empire. It describe the innate Ponorogo liberty and its opposition on centralist Majapahit rule. The lion represent the king of Majapahit while the peafowl represent the queen, it was suggested that the king was incompetent and always being controlled by his queen. The beautiful, youthful and almost effeminate horsemen describe the Majapahit cavalry that have lost their manliness. In society, there is another version about the origin of the Reog. History of Reog Arts began the revolt of Ki Ageng ticks, a man of Majapahit Kingdom in the 15th century, where at that time the Majapahit Kingdom under the rule of the King of Kertabhumi Bhre last Majapahit Kingdom. Ki Ageng Kutu wrath against the corrupt behavior of his King, he saw that the powers of the Majapahit Kingdom soon will end. He left the Kingdom and founded a College of martial arts in hopes of raising seeds which can be held as under. Aware that the army was not able to compete with the Majapahit army political messages of Ki Ageng Kutu were submitted through the performances of Reog. Performance of Reog utilized Ki Ageng Kutu to build resistance to the Royal Society. In art performances Reog was shown the head of a lion-shaped mask called \\"Singo Barong\\", Kings of the forest that became a symbol of Kertabhumi, and it plugged up to peacock feathers to resemble a giant fan that symbolises the strong influence of the governing Chinese pronunciation of peers over all. Jathilan, played by a group of dancers a gemblak horses-shaped became a symbol of the power of the Kingdom of Majapahit into comparison contrast with the power of warok. Red clown mask that became the symbol for Ki Ageng Kutu, alone and support the weight of the mask Singo Barong that reaches over 50 kg using only his teeth.Video tape No. 24, 14 July 1991, Josko Petkovic's archive. Ki Ageng Kutu's Reog popularity eventually led to Bhre Kertabhumi taking action and attacking Kutu's college, the rebellion by warok was quickly overcome, and the college is prohibited to continue teaching about warok. But the disciples Ki Ageng Kutu remain continue secretly. However, the performance of Reog itself is allowed to stage performances because has become popular among the people but the storyline having a groove in which the characters of new added folktale of Ponorogo, for example like Klono Sewandono, Dewi Songgolangit, and Sri Genthayu. Reog Ponorogo dancers traditionally performed in a trance state. Reog Ponorogo displays the traditional Kejawen Javanese spiritual teaching. Next to physical requirement, the dancers—especially the Warok—required to follow strict rules, rituals and exercises, both physical and spiritual. One of the requirement is abstinence, warok is prohibited to indulged and involved in sexual relationship with women, yet having sex with boy age eight to fifteen is allowed. The boy lover is called Gemblak and usually kept by Warok in their household under the agreement and compensation to the boy's family. Warok can be married with a woman as their wive, but they may kept a gemblak too. This led to Warok-Gemblakan relationship that similar to pederastic tradition of ancient Greece. Anybody who is in touch with the traditional way of life in Ponorogo, knows that there are these older men called warok who, instead of having sex with their wives, have sex with younger boys. What Warok and Gemblak did is homosexual act, yet they never identify themself as homosexuals. Many Warok and Gemblak were massacred by Islamic groups during the anti-communist Indonesian killings of 1965-1966, their heads placed on pikes for public display. Today the Warok-Gemblakan practice is discouraged by local religious authorities and being shunned through public moral opposition. As the result today Reog Ponorogo performance rarely features Gemblak boys to perform as Jathil horsemen, their position were replaced by girls. Although today this practice might probably still survived and done in discreet manner. Today, Reog Ponorogo is often held on festive special occasions; such as the Islamic holiday of Eid al-Fitr, anniversary of Ponorogo Regency, Independence day carnival on 17 August, to opening ceremony of sporting events. Today, reog troupe performances can be seen in various countries brought by Indonesian workers. Such as in the United States (Singo Lodoyo Washington DC), South Korea (Singo Mudho Korea), Taiwan (Singo Barong Taiwan), Australia (Singo Sarjono), naval expedition Indonesia (Reog Dewaruci), Germany, Japan, Hong Kong, Malaysia (Sardulo Gugah Ponorogo, Sri Wahyuni, Gamalasari).  Performance  Reog is a traditional dance that became the main identity for Ponorogo Regency. Reog National Festival is held every year along with the anniversary of Ponorogo regency and the Grebeg Suro celebration. Reog dance is also staged nightly on the full moon in Paseban, Ponorogo town square. Reog tells the story about the struggle of a prince who will propose to a beautiful princess. Reog Ponorogo tells the story of a mythical battle between the King of Ponorogo and the magical lion-like creature called Singo Barong.  Singo Barong mask  Singo Barong performance at Festival Reog Nasional. The Reog dance of Ponorogo involves a lion figure known as the '. Singo Barong is a large mask usually made from a tiger's or leopard's head skin, on the mask is a large fan adorned with real peafowl feathers. The Singo Barong mask is notoriously heavy and the dancer of the Singo Barong has to carry the mask of about 30 – 40 kg in weight and is supported by the strength of their teeth. A single dancer, or ', carries the heavy lion mask by his teeth. He is credited with supernatural abilities and strength. The ' may also carry an adolescent boy or girl on its head. When carrying an adolescent boy or girl on his head, the Reog dancer holds weight of up to 100 kilograms in total. Holding the heavy big mask by biting, the warok relies on the strength of his jaws, neck and shoulder muscles. The great mask spans over 2.5 meters with genuine tiger skin and real peacock feathers. It has gained international recognition as the world's largest mask.  Performers  The leading figures in Reog Ponorogo performance includes: # Klono Sewandono, A man in regal attire wearing a mask with a proud and pompous dance and plays the role as the King of Ponorogo # Bujang Ganong are rough youthful men wearing red masks, they perform acrobatic dances and sometimes also involve trances. # Jathil, the youthful and handsome men riding horses made of weaved bamboo, similar to the Kuda Lumping dance. Today, Jathil is usually performed by female dancers. # Warok, plays as the Singo Barong, the mythical creature. The one who is allowed to perform this dance is called warok. A warok is the honorary title of the local hero or strongman of the village who possesses both exceptional spiritual and physical strength. The dance itself is a demonstration of physical strength. Reog Ponorogo usually consists of three sets of dances; each dance is performed by several dancers: # The first dance is the opening dance, performed by Bujang Ganong, male dancers who wear black costumes. The costume describes rough men with intimidating moustaches and other masculine symbols. # The second dance is the Jaran Kepang dance performed by Jathil; it is originally performed by a gemblak, a handsome and youthful teenage boy wearing colourful costumes. Today female dancers usually play this role. # The third dance is the main attraction of the show; it is performed by all the Reog dancers. The warok as the main male dancer, wearing the large and heavy lion mask, dances in the centre of the stage while the other dancers dance around him. To demonstrate the warok's extraordinary strength, the Jathil rides on top of the lion mask and is carried around.

The controversy arose because the Singo Barong mask on the official website of Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture of Malaysia contained the words \\"Malaysia\\" on it and recognized as a legacy of Muslim Javanese communities in Malaysia especially in the district of Muar, Johor. The origins and cultural ownership of the Reog dance have been the subject of a dispute and controversy between the neighboring countries of Indonesia and Malaysia, whose ethnic, cultural and religious histories overlap and share many similarities. Mostly because there is numerous descendants of Javanese immigrants in Malaysia, some who have been serving with Sultan of Malacca, before moving together with the Sultan, especially in Johor state to form Johor-Riau Sultanate. And some of the immigrants brought many Javanese- origin artforms such as Barongan, Wayang Kulit Jawa, and Kuda Lumping. Thousands of Reog artist had a demonstration at the Malaysian Embassy in Jakarta. To avoid further controversy with Indonesia, all promotional revival on Barongan have been discontinued by the government of Malaysia, which contributing to further decline of Barongan in Malaysia. However, Malaysian government continue to promote other ethnic culture like Portugis descendant, San Pedro Day.

He became a writer of revisionist books that sought to glorify the activities of the German soldiers during the Second World War.Hermann Kurthen, Werner Bergmann & Rainer Erb, Antisemitism and Xenophobia in Germany after Unification, 1997, p. 176 Early years As a youth Kernmayer was briefly affiliated to the youth wing of the Social Democratic Party of Austria, before moving to the right, initially with the radical Sturmvolk movement before joining the Austrian Nazi Party.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, 1990, p. 208 As the party was illegal he was imprisoned for a while in 1934. His first experience as a journalist came on the Essener National-Zeitung, a local newspaper owned by Hermann Göring. He subsequently served as press-chief to Gauleiter Josef Bürckel, effectively controlling the press in both Ostmark and Saarland. By 1940 he was the chief of the Pressestelle of Gauleiters. He saw active service during the Second World War with the Waffen SS, holding the rank of Obersturmbannführer. Taken prisoner after the war, he was held in internment in Austria for two and a half years before being released in 1948. Writing During the Second World War, he had served with the 4th Battalion of the SS Division Leibstandarte around the Black Sea and wrote about his experiences in his 1948 book Das Grosse Rausch, which was republished in English as Dance of Death in 1951.Charles Messenger, Hitler's Gladiator: The Life and Wars of Panzer Army Commander Sepp Dietrich, 2005, p. 100 In the book he bemoaned the failure of Nazi Germany in the Soviet Union, arguing that a German victory would have brought culture to the supposedly uncivilized Russian people.Paul Howard Bixler, The Antioch Review Anthology, 1953, p. 450 The book was published only a few months after his release, despite one of the conditions being that he was banned from any publishing. Kern moved to West Germany in 1949 where he became known as a novelist. As an author on military history his works were largely published by the Verlag Welsermühl, a far-right revisionist publishing house that sought to portray a pro-German version of Second World War history. Another book, Menschen im Netz (1957) formed the basis for the Franz Peter Wirth-directed film People in the Net (1959).American Film Institute, The American Film Institute Catalog of Motion Pictures Volume 1 Part 2, 1997, p. 1162 He was also press chief of the HIAG and editor of Der Freiwillig, their monthly journal. In this capacity he became noted for his defences of the actions of the SS and his celebrations of that movement. He also edited the radical nationalist journals Deutsche Soldaten-Zeitung, Deutsche Wochenzeitung and Riechsruf, also contributing regularly to Nation Europa - a journal for which he set on a five-man board of associate editors.G. Macklin, Very Deeply Dyed in Black, London, 2007, p. 180 His work for these journals focused mainly on the exoneration of the SS and Nazi Germany and attacks on the Allies and Israel. Neo-Nazi activism Kern was a supporter of the pan-European nationalism that became important in post- war far right politics and was a regular contributor to Europe-Action, a journal devoted to this ideal controlled by the Fédération des étudiants nationalistes of Dominique Venner.James Shields, The Extreme Right in France: From Pétain to Le Pen, 2007, p. 120 Active in German politics, he served as a member of the neo-Nazi Socialist Reich Party, the National Democratic Party of Germany and the German People's Union.Jonathan Petropoulos, The Faustian Bargain: The Art World in Nazi Germany, 2000, p. 152 As an NPD member he was active in ultimately failed attempts to unite the German far right during the early 1970s. He was also active in the Deutsches Kulturwerk Europäischen Geistes, a German cultural organisation founded by Herbert Böhme.

Their views were marginalised and ignored by the scientific community of their time. They \\"had much the same relationship to 'philosophical' (or scientific) geologists as their indirect descendants, the twentieth-century creationists.\\" Paul Wood describes them as \\"mostly Anglican evangelicals\\" with \\"no institutional focus and little sense of commonality\\". They generally lacked any background in geology, and had little influence even in church circles.. Background Reason for appearance Up until the end of the 18th century Classical British scholarship was theologically based, using the Bible as a basic source for world history and chronology. Early work in the developing science of geology sought \\"theories of the Earth\\" combining mechanical physical laws in the natural philosophy of René Descartes with belief in the global flood described in Genesis 6-8. The Genesis Flood was given serious consideration as a basis for explaining geological data, and though by 1800 naturalists accepted an old-earth cosmology, this was not an inevitable conclusion among the educated. Amateur and popular geologists continued to use scripture centred geology well into the 19th century. In the 18th century, geologists became convinced that an immense time had been needed to build up the huge thickness of rock strata visible in quarries and cliffs, implying extensive pre-human periods. The concept of Neptunism taught by Abraham Gottlob Werner proposed that rock strata had been deposited from a primeval global ocean rather than by Noah's Flood. Opposing this, James Hutton proposed an indefinitely old cycle of eroded rocks being deposited in the sea, consolidated and heaved up by volcanic forces into mountains which in turn eroded, all in natural processes which continue to operate. By 1807 when the Geological Society of London was founded as the first professional geological society,Bicentenary of Geological Society of London most of its members accepted a basic geologic time scale, and researchers including William Smith had found that strata could be identified by characteristic fossils. Theologians sought to reconcile scripture, the book of God's word, with natural history, the book of God's works. Thomas Chalmers (a minister of the Scottish Kirk) popularised Gap creationism (or \\"interval\\" theory), a form of old Earth creationism that posits that the six-day creation as described in the Book of Genesis involved literal 24-hour days, but that there was a gap of time between two distinct creations in the first and the second verses of Genesis, explaining many scientific observations, including the age of the Earth.Evolution vs. Creationism: An Introduction, Eugenie Scott, pp61-62The Scientific Case Against Scientific Creationism, Jon P. Alston, p24What is Creationism?, Mark Isaak, TalkOrigins Archive Chalmers' suggestion was supported by theological liberals, what Milton Millhauser referred to as the party of \\"reconciliation,\\" such as Edward Hitchcock, W. D. Conybeare, and the future Cardinal Wiseman. Sharon Turner included it in his children's book A Sacred History of the World. Millhauser wrote that \\"Its prestige was such that the \\" interval\\" theory presently became almost the official British rival to the continental one that interpreted the Six Days as six creative eras,\\" adding his subjective estimate that \\"until about 1850, the casual pulpit or periodical assurance that geology does not conflict with revelation was based, in possibly seven instances out of ten, on Chalmers' \\"interval\\" theory.\\" The research of Georges Cuvier indicated \\"repeated irruptions and retreats of the sea\\" which he identified with a long series of sudden catastrophes which had caused extinctions: when this was translated into English in 1813, Robert Jameson added suggestions that the last catastrophe was the biblical Deluge. The Church of England clergyman William Buckland became the foremost proponent of Flood geology, proposing in 1819 that certain surface features were evidence of violent flooding during the Deluge as the last of a series of catastrophes. Historian of Religion Arthur McCalla considers that \\"All geological work that was taken seriously by experts took for granted the reality of deep time\\" and that scriptural geologists were not given \\"the slightest credence\\" by working geologists.. Ralph O'Connor, a history professor at the University of Aberdeen, considers McCalla's views to be an \\"overstatement\\", and states that \\"the 'orthodoxy' of an old-earth cosmology was not there for the taking; it had to be painstakingly constructed, using various performance strategies designed to persuade the literate classes that the new school of geology trumped biblical exegesis in questions about earth history.\\" The British scriptural geologists' writings came in two waves. The first, in the 1820s, was in response to 'gap theory' and included Granville Penn's A Comparative Estimate of the Mineral and Mosaical Geologies (1822) and George Bugg's Scriptural Geology (1826). Realizing that the majority opinion was slipping away from scriptural geology, their zeal increased. While the period from 1815-1830 represents the incubation of the movement, 1830 to 1844 marks its most intense and significant activity. This was largely in response to Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology and Buckland's Bridgewater Treatise, Geology and Mineralogy considered with reference to Natural Theology, which retracted his earlier ideas that flood geology had found evidence of a universal flood. Responses included George Fairholme's General View of the Geology of Scripture (1833) and The Mosaic Deluge (1837). O'Connor wrote of the times that, \\"Although secularization in various forms was on the ascendant among the upper and upper-middle classes, the Bible was still the most important book in early nineteenth-century British cultural life. Although liberalizing churchmen were busily instructing people that the Bible was not intended to teach facts about the natural world, the text of Genesis 1 appeared on the face of it to suggest otherwise, with its bald statements of what had been created when. For all but a growing minority, the Bible remained a vital touchstone for speculation about the natural world; conversely, any thoughtful reading of the first few chapters of Genesis necessarily involved reflections about the natural world.\\" Geological competence Professor of intellectual history David N. Livingstone states that scriptural geologists \\"were not, as it turns out, geologists at all\\", concluding that \\"while it may be proper to speak of Scriptural Geology, it is not really accurate to speak of Scriptural Geologists.\\" L. Piccardi and W. Bruce Masse state that \\"[a]part from George Young, none of these scriptural geologists had any geological competence\\". David Clifford states that they were \\"not themselves geologists\\" but rather \\"keen but biased amateurs\\" and that one of them, James Mellor Brown, \\"felt that no scientific expertise was required when examining scientific matters.\\" Taking a more positive view, Milton Millhauser states that the leaders of the party were \\"by no means ignorant of the science [they] assailed.\\" O'Connor argues that terminology in the 21st-century is a stumbling-block to modern analysis of geologic competence of the scriptural geologists because science today is understood in the language of Lyell and Darwin rather than that of Penn and Fairholme. Scriptural geologists saw themselves as 'geologists' (in the early 19th-century understanding of the term) and valued geologic fieldwork. Biblical exegesis, too, was central to science in general and earth history in particular. For the educated of the early 19th-century the Bible was itself valuable evidence. Evidence does not speak for itself, but requires interpretation. A heap of strata, or a line of Hebrew, is interpreted in various ways. To use the words 'geology' or 'science' in the 21st century sense automatically excludes Scriptural geologist perspectives on this debate, and skews the discussion from the start. They have been described as \\"genteel laymen ... versed in polite literature; clergymen, linguists, and antiquaries—those, in general, with vested interests in mediating the meaning of books, rather than rocks, in churches and classrooms\\", although a number of them were involved in fossil collecting or scientific endeavours. However, for the majority, geology was not their main scientific interest, but rather a transient or peripheral concern. ;Theologians :;Thomas Gisborne :Thomas Gisborne, B.A. in 1780, M.A. in 1783, from St. John's College, Cambridge, became a close friend of William Wilberforce whom he met in college. Gisborne wrote thirteen books, many of which went through numerous printings (two were interpreted into Welsh and German). Two of his books were related to science: Testimony of Natural Theology to Christianity (1818) and Considerations on Modern Theories of Geology (1837).. :;Sir William Cockburn, 11th Baronet :William Cockburn, B.A. in 1795, M.A. in 1798, D.D. in 1823, from St. John's College, Cambridge, was not a geologist. Gillispie described \\"reasonably respectable\\" William Cockburn, Dean of York, as spouting clerical \\"fulminations against science in general and all its works\\",. and writingSpecifically: The Bible Defended Against the British Association (1839) and A Letter to Professor Buckland Concerning the Origin of the World (1838) \\"clerical attacks on geology and uninformed attempts to frame theoretical systems reconciling the geological and scriptural records.\\" :;George Bugg :George Bugg, B.A. in 1795 from St. John's College, Cambridge, was ordained deacon in York and became a priest and curate of Dewsbury, near Leeds. Bugg's most significant work was his two- volume Scriptural Geology. Volume I (361 pages) appeared in 1826. Volume II (356 pages) was published in 1827. Although critics would object to associating geology with the Bible as a repetition of the mistakes the church made at the time of Galileo, Bugg held that there was a significant difference. Copernicus could easily reconcile his theory with scripture. But according to Bugg, modern geologists could not harmonize the Bible with their theories without changing the meaning of the scriptures. He contended that \\"the history of creation has one plain, obvious, and consistent meaning, throughout all the Word of God.\\" There is no hint of any other meaning than the obvious one in the rest of Scripture unless the Biblical authors have misled their readers. Millhouse quotes Bugg saying, \\"Was ever the word of God laid so deplorably prostrate at the feet of an infant and precocious science!\\" Wood says the Bugg was \\"an embittered clergyman who could not find a benefice\\". :;George Young :George Young, B.A. in 1801 from the University of Edinburgh, studied literature and excelled in mathematics and natural philosophy under the tutelage of Professor John Playfair. In 1806 he became the pastor of the Chapel in Cliff Street serving for 42 years until his death. He wrote A Geological Survey of the Yorkshire Coast, (with John Bird in 1822, 2nd ed. 1828) and Scriptural Geology (1838). He was a fossil collector and dealer. :Geologist Martin Simpson described Young's Geological Survey as \\"in every way worthy of a pupil of the celebrated Playfair.\\" And, Piccardi and Masse said that George Young was geologically competent. ;Scientists :;Andrew Ure :Andrew Ure, M.A. in 1799, M.D. in 1801 in Glasgow, was a scientist and physician. He served briefly as an army surgeon then in 1803 became a member of the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons in Glasgow as Professor of Natural Philosophy (specializing in chemistry and physics) at the Andersonian Institution (now the University of Strathclyde). He was probably the first consulting chemist in Britain and highly esteemed by contemporary scientists.. He wrote A Dictionary of Chemistry (1821), Elements of the Art of Dyeing (1824), and A New System of Geology (1829). :The leading University of Cambridge geologist Adam Sedgwick, a Church of England clergyman, condemned A New System of Geology pulling \\"it to pieces without mercy\\" and calling it a \\"monument of folly\\". Gillispie chastised Andrew Ure as of the \\"men of the lunatic fringe\\" who produced clerical \\"fulminations against science in general and all its works\\". Ure was not a cleric. :;George Fairholme :George Fairholme was a wealthy banker and landowner, self-taught naturalist. He was not opposed to studying geology; rather, he did battle with the new theories which were, in his view, inconsistent with Scripture and scientific facts.. Genesis did not teach science or geology, rather, it offers a true grasp of earth history for geologists to follow. He tried to show from geology and geography that a global Flood had molded the continents. The strata, in his view, were connected chiefly with the Flood. Charles Gillispie listed Fairholme as among \\"the lunatic fringe.\\" But Millhauser said he was \\"by no means ignorant of the science [he] assailed\\" :;John Murray :John Murray was self-taught early in his career, but he eventually obtained M.A. and Ph. D. degrees. While traveling widely to observe geological and archeological sites, he lectured and conducted experimental field research using chemical analysis to study rocks and fossils. ;Other :;Granville Penn :Granville Penn attended Magdalen College, Oxford and became an assistant chief clerk in the War Department. His major work on geology (1822) was A Comparative Estimate of the Mineral and Mosaical Geologies. Penn made no claim to be a geologist, yet he read the geological literature of his day. \\"a scholar of some competence, who had studied geology.\\" :Contemporary Hugh Miller described Granville Penn as one of \\"the abler and more respectable anti-geologists\\" and \\"certainly one of the most extensively informed of his class,\\" But where Penn's view of Biblical verses conflicted with Millers own views, Miller labeled Penn's views as \\"mere idle glosses, ignorantly or surreptitiously introduced into the text by ancient copyists.\\" Gillispie chastised Penn as among \\"men of the lunatic fringe, ... [who] got out their fantastic geologies and natural histories, a literature which enjoyed surprising vogue, but which is too absurd to disinter\\". Millhauser said the Penn \\"had come to suspect it [the new geology] of a tendency toward Lucretian materialism.\\" Reception By historians of science A number of modern historians have \\"rounded on scriptural geologists as simplistic fundamentalists who defended an untenable and anti- scientific worldview\\". Historian of science Charles Gillispie chastised a number of them as \\"men of the lunatic fringe, like Granville Penn, John Faber, Andrew Ure, and George Fairholme, [who] got out their fantastic geologies and natural histories, a literature which enjoyed surprising vogue, but which is too absurd to disinter\\". Gillispie describes their views, along with their \\"reasonably respectable\\" colleagues (such as Edward Bouverie Pusey and William Cockburn, Dean of York), as clerical \\"fulminations against science in general and all its works\\", and listed the works of Cockburn and FairholmeSpecifically: New and Conclusive Physical Demonstrations: Both of the Fact and Period of the Mosaic Deluge and of Its Having Been the Only Event of the Kind that Has Ever Occurred upon the Earth (1838) as among \\"clerical attacks on geology and uninformed attempts to frame theoretical systems reconciling the geological and scriptural records.\\" Martin J. S. Rudwick initially dismissed them as mere 'dogmatic irritants', but later discerned a couple of points of consilience: a concern with time and sequence; and an adoption of the pictorial conventions of some scriptural geologists by the mainstream.

She is also portrayed by Julianne Moore in the 1998 version of Psycho. She is the sister of Norman Bates' victim Marion Crane. Additionally, Lila appears in Bloch's 1982 sequel novel Psycho II, and the unrelated 1983 sequel film of the same name, in which she serves as an antagonist. Fictional biography Lila Crane is the younger sister of Marion Crane (Janet Leigh). After Marion steals $40,000 from her boss, George Lowery (Vaughn Taylor), she plans to run off from Phoenix, Arizona to the (fictional) small town of Fairvale, California, where her boyfriend Sam Loomis (John Gavin) lives so she could marry him. Lila travels to Fairvale to meet Sam, hoping that Marion would be there with him and the money. She planned to convince Marion to return the money to her employer, so that he won't press charges. Upon arriving in Fairvale, she learns from Sam that he has not seen Marion for days; she has disappeared. Shortly after her arrival, a private investigator hired by Marion's employer, Milton Arbogast (Martin Balsam), also comes into contact with her and Sam. Arbogast searches local hotels, eventually coming to the Bates Motel. After calling to update Lila and Sam about tracing Marion to the motel, he disappears as well. This prompts Sam and Lila to pose as a married couple in order to get a room at the motel to investigate without arousing the suspicion of the owner, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). Lila makes her way to Norman's house while Sam distracts him. When Norman realizes what Lila is up to, he knocks Sam unconscious and runs after her. When she enters the fruit cellar, she makes a ghastly discovery: the corpse of Norman's mother, whom Norman claimed was alive. A moment later, Norman enters dressed in his mother's clothes and a wig, wielding a kitchen knife. He attacks her, but Sam tackles him to the ground and disarms him. A psychiatrist later tells her that Norman -- who murders people while under the control of an alternate personality taking the form of his mother, whom he murdered years before -- killed her sister and Arbogast.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054215/synopsis In Psycho II, Norman is released from the mental institution he was placed in at the end of the first film after 22 years. Lila (now Lila Loomis, having married Sam) petitions to keep Norman locked up; however, the petition is unsuccessful and Norman is released. Norman gets a job at a local diner, where he meets a coworker, a young woman named Mary (Meg Tilly). Later, it is revealed that Mary is Lila's daughter, and they are trying to drive Norman insane and get him recommitted by dressing up as his mother and leaving notes and calls claiming to be her. While this is unfolding, Norman's motel manager and a teenage boy making out with a girl in Norman's fruit cellar are murdered by someone who looks like Norman in his \\"Mother\\" guise. Later, Mary, who has grown to care about Norman, tells Lila that she is backing out of their plan. Lila angrily rebukes her daughter, and sneaks to Norman's fruit cellar to put on her \\"Mother\\" costume. In the process of doing so, she is murdered by the figure who appears to be \\"Mother.\\" Mary is later killed in a standoff with police, who exonerate Norman. It is revealed later that Emma Spool (Claudia Bryar), Norman's maternal aunt, killed Lila and the others. Spool says that she is Norman's real mother, and that she killed people who had \\"wronged him\\". The following sequel reveals that she is in fact Norman's aunt, who has deluded herself into believing he is her child. Novels The character of Lila Crane is basically the same, as is the plot events, in Robert Bloch's novel Psycho. However, the plots of Psycho II the book and Psycho II the movie are nothing alike. In the Psycho II novel, there are no mentioned plans of releasing Norman from the institution. Instead, he escapes and travels to Fairvale, intent on murdering Sam and Lila Loomis. The book's climax reveals that Norman was killed in a car accident before he could get to them, however, and that Sam and Lila were actually murdered by Norman's psychiatrist, Dr. Adam Claiborne, who assumed Norman's identity. Comic books Lila appears in the 1992 three-issue comic book adaptation of the 1960 film Psycho, released by Innovation Publishing. Portrayals Lila Crane/Loomis was portrayed by Vera Miles in the 1960 film Psycho and its 1983 sequel, Psycho II. Julianne Moore portrayed the character in the 1998 remake.

The story of earth and life: a Southern African perspective on a 4.6-billion-year journey. Kumba Resources. p 195-197. Ice Age Some 300-290 million years ago, during Dwyka times, what is now Southern Africa was, as a result of plate tectonics, near the South Pole and large ice sheets or glaciers covered high-lying areas. Geologists term this upland the Cargonian Highlands, stretching from what is now the Northern Cape through Gauteng to Mpumalanga. As the Dwyka glaciers moved, grinding their way southwards, the rocks and rubble that became embedded in their belly smoothed the underlying Andesite rock pavements and scoured out scratch marks, known as striations. As the ice shaped the landscape, the continent of Gondwanaland continued to drift slowly northwards, ultimately bringing this area into warmer latitudes. As the glaciers melted, a mixture of clay and rock was left behind which eventually consolidated into a rock called Tillite – the lower- most layer in the Karoo sequence. Quite large erratics or drop stones carried here by glacial action are found at Nooitgedacht. The changing local environment also created conditions conducive for the burgeoning of life, reflected in the rich fossil record of the Karoo. River of diamonds Along this portion of its course, the adjacent Vaal River, and earlier generations of rivers and erosion processes, have cut through and swept away a vast mass of Karoo rock and sediment, to re-expose the volcanic Andesite landscape formed 2.7 billion years ago and shaped by glacial action 300 million years ago. At one time – when the diamondiferous pipes penetrated to the surface between 120 and 90 million years ago – it is estimated that about 1 km of Karoo sediment overlay the Kimberley-Barkly West area. Diamonds were eroded out of these pipes and caught in pockets of sediment and gravels which, once discovered, changed the course of modern South African history. Since 1869, the various gravels along the Vaal River have been worked intensively for their content of high-grade alluvial diamonds. The Nooitgedacht diggings were opened in 1949 and closed in 1981. During these 32 years, a total of 80 000 diamonds were found here. The Venter Diamond, a yellow stone, was the largest. The standard size of a digger's claim was 15 x 15 metres. The diamond-bearing gravels, covered by a layer of sterile red sand, were washed by hand in simple rotary pans. The left-over concentrate of heavy material was then carefully sorted for diamonds. The search for diamonds continues along the Vaal River in the Windsorton, Barkly West and Delportshoop areas and further downstream. Diggings on Nooitgedacht itself were opened again in the late 1990s. Some small-scale diggers in the region still use pick and shovel to eke out a meagre return, but miners using heavy earth-moving equipment obtain far better results. The impacts of this on the environment and on heritage resources are not small. Rock Art The images found on the andesite glacial pavements at Nooitgedacht are a form of rock art called rock engravings (the term petroglyph is also sometimes used). They were produced by pecking out the outlines or silhouettes of animals, or ‘geometric’ designs, with a pointed stone (there is no evidence that the artists used metal tools, nor indeed diamonds). They were made by ancestors of San and Khoe people, probably during the past 1500 years. The engravings include depictions of humans, eland, rhinoceros, ostrich, giraffe and anteater. The more abstract forms may depict bags and aprons, as well as ‘geometric’ images such as are common at other sites in the region, particularly Driekops Eiland. What these different images mean is subject to debate. One argument suggests that whereas sites such as the nearby Wildebeest Kuil, with its profusion of engravings of animals and some human figures, is quintessentially San/hunter-gatherer in character, sites such as Nooitgedacht and Driekops Eiland, where geometric engravings occur in great numbers, may belong to a different tradition of rock art, a separate Khoekhoe herder rock art tradition. A different perspective does not discount this possibility, but questions whether assigning variability in terms of ethnic or cultural differences in the first instance does not overlook other possible factors. Research at Driekops Eiland suggests that sites such as this, and the ‘geometric’ engravings, bags and aprons present, may have been produced as part of girls’ coming-of-age rites, potentially across the spectrum of both San and Khoekhoe contexts, given the similarities in beliefs and ritual practices. Diamond Fields Land Dispute Griqua leader and Captain, Nicolaas Waterboer Various claims and counter claims to ownership of this territory were made following the discovery of diamonds in 1869-70. Nooitgedacht featured early on, when the Presidents of the Free State and Transvaal Republics met here with the Griqua Chief Nicolaas Waterboer and his agent David Arnot, on 18 August 1870. David Arnot, Griqua lawyer and diplomatThe Griqua representatives walked out in a huff and the Free State proclaimed the territory theirs. But this was not the end of the story, the dispute being settled eventually by the Keate Award (in favour of Waterboer, who placed himself under British protection), and the proclamation of the Crown Colony of Griqualand West on 27 October 1871. Preservation as Heritage Site The site was declared a National Monument in 1936 and under South Africa's Act 25 of 1999 is now a Grade 2 Provincial Heritage Site.

The center focuses on researching and addressing global water-related challenges, including water scarcity, access, quality and climate risks. The center's stated mission is to \\"creatively tackle water challenges of a rapidly changing world where water and climate interact with food, energy, ecosystems and urbanization,\\" by combining \\"the rigor of scientific research with the impact of effective policy.\\" The Columbia Water Center takes a multidisciplinary approach to water challenges, employing hydrologists, climatologists, environmental engineers, and water policy analysts. The director of the center is Upmanu Lall, the Carol Silberstein Professor of Earth and Environmental Engineering and Civil Engineering and Engineering Mechanics at Columbia University. Pierre Gentine, an assistant professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Engineering, also takes a leading role in the center, with his own PhD and Post-doctoral team focusing on the interactions between soil and atmospheric moisture. The center currently divides its projects into five themes, America's Water, The Global Floods Initiative, Data Analytics and Multi-Scale Predictions, Risk and Financial Instruments and the Water, Food, Energy Nexus. __TOC__ Background The Earth Institute, under the leadership of Jeff Sachs, is a research institution that supports sustainable development from various angles. In 2008, the PepsiCo Foundation awarded the Earth Institute $6 million to address these water-related issues. The PepsiCo grant led to the establishment of the Columbia Water Center under the leadership of Columbia University engineering professor Upmanu Lall. This three-year grant made possible projects in four countries: India, China, Mali, and Brazil. In Brazil, CWC has partnered with the Federal University of Ceará in the northeast to focus on sophisticated climate-based forecasting systems used for water allocation decisions across diverse use sectors. In addition, the CWC team recently completed a municipal water plan (PAM) for Milhã, a rural area in central Ceará. The project outlines a plan for the municipality to deliver water to all of its 14,000 residents. As part of the project, the CWC designed and built water infrastructure demonstration projects for Ingá and Pedra Fina, two communities in Milhã. The project provides water to 500 people in the area. In India, the project focuses on reducing water consumption in the agricultural sector by encouraging sustainable crop choice patterns, as well as working with corporations to deploy better irrigation technologies (and increase reliability) throughout their supply chains. A key objective is to reduce the groundwater stress in the region. Primary project locations are in the states of Punjab and Gujarat. In Punjab, the CWC has partnered with Punjab Agricultural University to come up with innovative solutions to reduce farmer irrigation. Some of the methods developed (including the use of inexpensive tensiometers to measure soil moisture and direct seeding of rice) were field tested in the 2010 planting season with over 500 farmers participating. The Punjab Agricultural University team reports that participating farmers saved 25 to 30 percent of their normal water use by implementing the new approaches. The CWC/PAU team plans to scale up the pilot project in 2011 by recruiting 5,000 rice farmers to use tensiometers. In Gujarat, the Columbia Water Center is working with the state government to reform electricity subsidies to provide a greater incentive for farmers to conserve water. In conjunction with subsidy reform, the CWC is also piloting water saving technologies among farmers. The work in Mali coincides with the Millennium Villages Project. CWC is focusing on designing irrigation and cropping systems that can be operated and maintained locally in order to provide farmers with higher-value cash crops. The center has installed large pumps that improved the amount of water available. Projects emphasize bringing together local partners, market forces and public-private partnerships. Current Research  In recent years, the Columbia Water Center has expanded the scope of its initiatives to encompass five broad research themes. America's Water The America's Water Initiative is aims to build a network of academic institutions, government agencies, and private industry to inform water infrastructure improvements in the United States and address other water challenges. The initiative focuses on all aspects of water, from policy to drought and flood forecasting and the potential for disruptive water technology to provide distributed water infrastructure that is less expensive than replacing legacy systems. On March 12, 2015, the initiative held its first annual symposium, which brought together water experts from various groups, representing the industry, utilities, policy and non-profit sectors among others. The meeting was intended to be a first step toward a broader working relationship that can help set a water research agenda and develop solutions for national water challenges. The Global Floods Initiative The Global Floods Initiative aims to apply cutting-edge and continually evolving climate forecasting techniques to help helping policymakers, disaster relief agencies, infrastructure designers, financial institutions and others better prepare for, manage and respond to extreme floods. The initiative builds on almost two decades of research on how the quasi-periodic climate cycles (such as El- Nino/La-Nina and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation) interact to increase the risk of flooding in particular locations. More recent research into hydrometerology, which looks at the interaction of land, water and atmosphere at a more local scale, adds additional layers to the potential for flood prediction. Data Analytics and Multi-Scale Predictions The Columbia Water Center is a leader in predicting seasonal hydroclimate forecasts and associated risk analyses. These forecasts are used for a variety of applications, including integrating climate forecasts into water allocation procedures for urban, industrial and agricultural consumers. New ways of representing convection and vegetation response to water stress are also major areas of research, the results of which could offer new understandings of the carbon and hydrological cycle. Risk and Financial Instruments Climate forecasting can also be used to develop flood and drought risk metrics for companies with global supply chains. These metrics can help companies address challenges through new sourcing strategies, novel regional financial risk management products (e.g., cat bonds, index insurance), pre-emptive maintenance and mitigation, reservoir reallocation agreements and other tools. Water, Food, Energy Nexus The Columbia Water Center studies how the water, food, and energy sectors are interrelated and how climate affects this relationship. Projects include policy research and recommendations to promote water and energy savings in the agricultural sector in water-stressed farming regions, development of seasonal forecasts to guide decision-making in the water and energy sectors, and testing and implementation of low-cost soil moisture and nitrogen sensors to improve irrigation efficiency, reducing fertilizer use and groundwater pollution and saving energy from groundwater pumping.

It is of concern as an invasive species in some other countries. Appearance Vespa velutina is slightly smaller than the European hornet. Typically, queens are 30 mm (1.2 in) in length, and males about 24 mm (0.95 in). Workers measure about 20 mm (0.80 in) in length. The species has distinctive yellow tarsi (legs). The thorax is a velvety brown or black with a brown abdomen. Each abdominal segment has a narrow posterior yellow border, except for the fourth segment, which is orange. The head is black and the face yellow. Regional forms vary sufficiently in color to cause difficulties in classification, and several subspecies have been variously identified and ultimately rejected; while a history of recognizing subspecies within many of the Vespa hornets exists, including V. velutina, the most recent taxonomic revision of the genus treats all subspecific names in the genus Vespa as synonyms, effectively relegating them to no more than informal names for regional color forms.A.H. Smith-Pardo, J.M. Carpenter, L. Kimsey (2020) The diversity of hornets in the genus Vespa (Hymenoptera: Vespidae; Vespinae), their importance and interceptions in the United States. Insect Systematics and Diversity 4(3) https://doi.org/10.1093/isd/ixaa006 The color form causing concern about its invasiveness in Europe has been referred to as V. v. nigrithorax, though this name no longer has any taxonomic standing. Biology Like other hornets, V. velutina builds nests that may house colonies of several thousand individuals. Females in the colony are armed with formidable stingers with which they defend their nests and kill their prey. The nest is of paper, roughly in the shape of a huge egg, usually at least half a meter long. Unlike the nest of the European hornet (V. crabro), its exit is usually lateral rather than at the bottom. The nesting season is long, and a colony commonly begins by building a nest in a low shrub, then abandoning it after some months and rapidly building a new one high in a tree, possibly as an antiparasitic measure. The next generation of young queens disperses in the late autumn to hibernate over winter.Vespa velutina In: Invasive Species Compendium 2014. Wallingford, UK: CAB International. www.cabi.org/isc File:Paula Jorge - vespas.jpg|V. velutina nest on tree File:Vespa vélutina.jpgV. velutina nest File:Nid de frelon asiatique (Vespa velutina) -3.jpg|Inner structure of nest File:Vespa_Munsiyari.jpg|V. velutina from the Central Himalayas, India V. velutina opportunistically hunts a very wide range of insects, including flies, dragonflies, and Orthoptera, typically capturing them by pursuit. The major concern about their invasiveness, however, is that when they find a honey bee colony or an apiary, they tend to settle down and specialize in honey bees as their prey, as do the larger Japanese giant hornets. A hornet occupies a position above a beehive as its hunting territory. It flies about within an area of about half a square metre, scanning the direction from which foraging honey bees return to the hive. Each hornet vigorously defends its hunting territory, chasing off any rivals. However, as soon as it catches a bee, it flies off and another hornet replaces it, usually within a few seconds. The circadian activities of the two species of honey bees are similar, and the hunting hornets match them; their most intense activity is in the morning and afternoon, not near dusk or noon. In its native range, V. velutina mainly hunts Apis cerana, the eastern honey bee, which has evolved a strategy of avoiding hovering hornets by rapid entry and exit from the hive when hornets are about. The guard bees also ball hornets to death. However, where A. mellifera, the western honey bee, has been imported, V. velutina finds them easier prey than A. cerana, because A. mellifera has not been subjected to selection for countering concentrated hawking by hornets. For example, A. mellifera approach their hives more indirectly and slowly when they detect hawking hornets, instead of darting in as fast as possible in the way that A. cerana does. They also ball hornets, but less effectively, and they do not achieve as high a temperature in the ball. Furthermore, when they detect that hornets are hawking, A. cerana tend to withdraw into the nest, but A. mellifera do not. A. cerana guard bees also use wing shimmering in response to the presence of V. velutina. This is a very generalized response to disturbance and has variously been suggested to be an aposematic signal or a strategy for disruption of visual patterns, similar to the behavior of Apis cerana nuluensis and Apis dorsata. A. mellifera exhibits no such behavior. In any event, when A. mellifera occurs together with A. cerana, V. velutina preferentially hawks A. mellifera foragers. Distribution Known distribution of the different color forms of Vespa velutina across southeastern Asia V. velutina originates from Southeast Asia, particularly the tropical regions, from northern India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bhutan, China, Taiwan, Burma, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Malaysia, the Indo- Chinese peninsula, and surrounding archipelagoes. Pest status and invasiveness As an invader, the Asian hornet appeared earliest in France, Spain, Portugal, South Korea, and Japan. Further invasions are ongoing in various countries, including much of Europe. Humans have been attacked after disturbing hornets; although the species is not aggressive, it \\"charges in a group as soon as it feels its nest is threatened\\". People have been hospitalised in France after suffering anaphylactic shock as a result of multiple stings. Because of Asian hornets' larger size, their stings are more serious than those of western honey bees. In November 2017, a man was killed in Galicia after being stung over 20 times while pruning an apple tree. Timeline V. velutina has become an invasive species in France, where it is believed to have arrived in boxes of pottery from China in 2004. By 2009, several thousand nests were in the area of Bordeaux and surrounding departments,http://spn.mnhn.fr/spn_rapports/archivage_rapports/2009/SPN%202009%20-%207%20-%20Vespa%20velutina.pdf and by the end of 2015, they were reported over most of France. The Asian hornet has been reported as naturalised on the Japanese island of Tsushima since about 2010. The Asian hornet spread to northern Spain, as confirmed in 2010 by the Beekeepers' Association of the Basque Country (Gipuzkoako Erlezainen Elkartea) and the Neiker entomology institute in Irún, after breeding colonies were found.Bee killing Asian hornet confirmed in Spain , The Reader, November 21, 2010 In September 2013, a beekeeper from Rasines, Cantabria, documented the hornets' presence in two specimens. In June 2015, firemen destroyed a nest in Santander. It was first reported in Portugal in 2011. It was reported in Liguria, Italy in 2012. According to Italian Beekepers' Association in 2017, the Asian hornet was well established in northwestern regions of Italy, and colonization is steadily advancing. The first sighting on the UK mainland was announced on 20 September 2016 and occurred near Tetbury in Gloucestershire; the nest was found and destroyed and no breeding adults were found within. A nest was reported on the Channel Island of Alderney in 2016. As of October 2017, the species was reported in Belgium. It was first reported in Luxembourg in 2020.Ries, C. & M. Pfeiffenschneider (Eds.), 2020. Vespa velutina nigrithorax du Buysson, 1905. In: neobiota.lu - Invasive Alien Species in Luxembourg. National Museum of Natural History, Luxembourg. URL: https://neobiota.lu/vespa-velutina/ [Accessed 2020-09-15].'= Biocontrol Biocontrol of Vespa velutina has been attempted using Sarracenia purpurea - the purple pitcher plant. Pitcher plants are natural bottle traps. Both of these are invasives in France and pitchers were found to be naturally catching hornets, and so were investigated as a biocontrol. However Sarracenia purpurea has been judged too unselective to use after closer study.

In the 1840s it was renovated in the Greek Revival architectural style. Almost a century later it was renovated again, this time in the Colonial Revival style. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. Building The house occupies a large lot on the east side of Albany between Manor and Ten Broeck avenues, just opposite 313 Albany Avenue. The neighborhood is primarily residential. It is a two-story seven-by-two-bay building with a one-and-a- half-story frame rear wing topped by a gabled roof with a heavily molded, dentilled cornice pierced by a brick chimney. In the center of the first story on the west (front) facade is a one-bay porch. Its low hipped roof is supported by pairs of Ionic columns rising to a molded cornice and entablature. There is a projecting bay window on the south profile. The paneled main wooden door has leaded sidelights and top. It leads to a center hallway, with a large parlor on the south. This room has much Greek Revival- era decoration, such as its architraves, mantels and the newels and balusters on its staircase. The west parlor on the north side, currently used as the dining room, has similar finishes, and the northeast one has Colonial Revival elements. The upper floor and attic are also mostly original to their era of construction or renovation. In the rear of the lot are a swimming pool, work shed, and a former garage now used as an apartment. They are non-contributing to the National Register listing. History The house's structural origins are in the early 19th century, probably around 1820. The north gable is believed to be the most intact portion of the house from this time, due to the less refined and more weathered character of the stone there compared to the south. Due to subsequent expansions and renovations it is impossible to tell what its original plan was. In the 1840s, its then-owner expanded it in the then-popular Greek Revival style, a common occurrence with many small older houses at that time. Much of its interior decoration was added during that construction. Ninety years later, in the 1930s, another owner expanded the house, this time in the Colonial Revival style. The rear wing was added, new stonework was put in on the south and on the first floor a wall was removed to make a larger space of one of the parlors. The northeast parlor was also decorated in that style. The most visible Colonial Revival touch from that work is the front porch with its classically inspired columns and entablature. At that time, the city was encouraging the restoration and preservation of its remaining colonial architecture. One of those most involved in this effort was local architect Myron Teller. It is not known whether he had anything to do with the work at 322 Albany Avenue, but the attention to detail and the quality of the work suggest his influence.

Russian Antisemitism, Pamyat and the Demonology of Zionism (Studies in Antisemitism) by William Korey Following the 1991 break-up of the Soviet Union, Oizerman moved towards social democratic, anti-Leninist positions. He viewed Lenin's interpretation and application of the ideas of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in the Russian Revolution as incorrect, and believed Lenin's view led towards oligarchy rather than the victorious establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat.Luther, Sara Fletcher, John J.

It was opened in 1998 after two delays in opening. There are 200,000 square metres located at Avenida Ayrton Senna, 2800, Barra da Tijuca, Rio de Janeiro with a theme based on characters and festivals of Brazilian culture and its origins: indigenous, African and European. The main street consists of bars, restaurants and most shops in the park, all the facades in various styles of Brazilian architecture. The main roller coaster in the park, Monte Makaya, held the record for most inversions in the world (8 inversions in all) for four years, but was trumped by Colossus, Thorpe Park. Current situation Since its opening in January 1998, Terra Encantada could not overcome the expectations of the public who came to buy tickets even before the inauguration. It was expected to be a Disney Carioca Bar and became the land of fun and fantasy, attracting dozens of investors. In the project, there were more than 60 dining options and came to be contemplated opening a U.S. subsidiary of Planet Hollywood. Investments reached U.S. $220 million. More than 12 thousand people should be employed directly and indirectly and the forecast was 20 thousand visitors per day. Sales came to about $30 million monthly. The reality was very different. The problems began even before the inauguration of the Terra Encantada, which was twice postponed. The first was scheduled for October 12, 1997 and the other for December 15. When the park was opened in January 1998, only part of the attractions were available. The first visitors, disappointed, came to claim the money back. The leisure center was running for less than a month when he received a visit from actress Isis de Oliveira. The artist was injured in one of the main attractions of the park, the lift cabum and entered in court. Thereafter, a series of problems have shaken the credibility of Terra Encantada. Fights between fighters of jiu-jitsu a strike by employees. One case that gained more impact in the press occurred in March 2002 during a rock band's A Charlie Brown Jr. brawl, at around 1:30 am, left 61 people injured. Shops were destroyed and looted, and stones, chairs, trash cans and potted plants were thrown everywhere by young people who attended the show. (Source, Jornal O Globo) Today, the structure of Main Street went through reforms, but the Castle of Water and Lookouts remain in precarious In 2010, Terra Encantada was chosen to be the site of recordings from the soap opera \\"Ugly Betty\\" by Rede Record and has all your main street turned into an old neighbourhood of Rio de Janeiro, but precisely in the neighbourhood of Gamboa. However, on June 19, 2010, the 61 year-old kitchen helper, Heydiara Lemos Ribeiro, was thrown out of Mount Aurora, falling from a height of approx. 10 meters. The victim died from head trauma. During the investigations it was proven that the park's rides all had serious structural and mechanical failures, which led to a total ban of the park and the indictment for manslaughter and the director and the engineer held responsible. The report is being awaited from the expertise and the park will only open its doors again when they fulfill all the demands made by the Civil Defense. The park has since been demolished. Characters The characters were created especially for the park, based on the theme, which is the Brazilian culture and its origins: indigenous, African and European. Enjoying the beauty and strength of nature, have highlighted some endangered species - like the golden lion tamarin, the hyacinth macaw and the boto color pink - who managed to save himself and went to live in Terra Encantada.

History In July 1982, the company's original subsidiaries were formed in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, by Susan and Judd Shoval and a group of private investors. One year later, the first Workers’ Compensation insurance policy was issued in Pennsylvania and about a half million dollars in premium were written throughout 1983. The company grew, adding states and acquiring Mutual Fire Insurance Company of Saco, Maine, in 1995. By 2007, GUARD had expanded under the Shovals' leadership to four insurance carriers (NorGUARD, AmGUARD, EastGUARD, and WestGUARD) writing $200 million of Workers’ Compensation insurance in 23 states. The company was acquired in 2007 by Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings Ltd., an international insurance group. Sy Foguel joined the organization (now under new ownership) as CEO and introduced additional lines of coverage. In 2012, the organization became a wholly owned subsidiary of National Indemnity Company, which is part of the Berkshire Hathaway Group./ By the end of 2016, the company was writing over $1 billion in premium, operating nationwide, and actively writing seven other lines of insurance — Businessowner's Policies, Commercial Liability umbrella/excess, commercial auto, professional liability, statutory disability coverage, and homeowners/personal umbrella. Berkshire Hathaway GUARD currently has eight locations throughout the United States but remains headquartered in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. Trivia The original building housing Berkshire Hathaway GUARD's corporate operations was formerly the Lehigh and Wilkes-Barre Coal Company building in Wilkes-Barre. The structure was built in 1908 in an unprecedented speed of 90 days. In 1995, the company acquired Mutual Fire Insurance Company of Saco, Maine, the second oldest insurer in the United States. Various Recognition and Rankings Berkshire Hathaway GUARD was named a Ward's 50 Top Performer for 2012, a distinction placing the company within the top 2% of all property and casualty insurance companies nationwide. Warren Buffett referenced GUARD INSURANCE, its CEO Sy Foguel, and the city of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania in his 2019 Shareholder Letter; \\"Late in 2012, Ajit Jain, the invaluable manager of our insurance operations, called to tell me that he was buying a tiny company – GUARD Insurance Group – in that small Pennsylvania city for $221 million (roughly its net worth at the time). He added that Sy Foguel, GUARD’s CEO, was going to be a star at Berkshire. Both GUARD and Sy were new names to me. Bingo and bingo: In 2019, GUARD had premium volume of $1.9 billion, up 379% since 2012, and also delivered a satisfactory underwriting profit. Since joining Berkshire, Sy has led the company into both new products and new regions of the country and has increased GUARD’s float by 265%.\\" References External links * Berkshire Hathaway GUARD’s Corporate Web Site * Bloomberg Company Profile of Berkshire Hathaway GUARD * Warren Buffet's 2019 Letter to Berkshire Hathaway Shareholders * Highlights from Warren Buffet's 2020 Shareholder Letter Category:Financial services companies established in 1982 Category:Insurance companies of the United States Category:American companies established in 1982 Category:Privately held companies based in Pennsylvania Category:1982 establishments in Pennsylvania ","title":"Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies"},{"id":"24068722","text":"Siskin are a British pop music duo. The ensemble consists of Galen Ayers, daughter of musician Kevin Ayers, and Kirsty Newton. Galen Ayers lists her contributions as \\"vocals, guitars, lyrics, elegance” and credits her friend and fellow singer-songwriter Kirsty Newton with “keys, bass, vocals, lunacy”. They have been described as \\"beautiful, talented but unimpressed by the get- rich-quick blandishments of the mainstream\\". They describe themselves as \\"two very different girls from very different backgrounds who were lucky to discover that they could make beautiful music together\\". History  Early history  Galen Ayers was raised in a 1970s hippie commune in France and was later transported to Majorca for the remainder of her upbringing. From the shores of her Spanish home town, Deia, Ayers claims to have been deeply influenced by her father: \\"my father’s music influenced me but I think an even greater influence from him was reading. He read everything from Japanese haiku poems to cookbooks\\". Her diaries have featured rhyming couplets from early in her life, demonstrating a latent flair for songwriting. At the age of 13, she has said, \\"I grabbed a guitar and realised that the writing sounded even better when chords were put behind it. Music's an amazing vehicle to convey feelings\\". Because of the pronunciation of her unusual name (\\"Gallon\\"), she has sometimes been nicknamed Eight Pints. Kirsty Newton grew up in Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire.Hammersmith & Fulham News 24 April 2009 The northerner has absolute pitch and began banging the glockenspiel at the age of two years. She is classically trained on the piano and oboe, but taught herself bass guitar once she moved to London. She was a full-time music teacher at Fulham Preparatory School but still gives piano, recorder and oboe lessons to pupils one day a week.  2000–2007  Following a challenging period of education at a private boarding school, Ayers embarked on a music career and made a series of recordings in 2001 produced by Tina Weymouth and Chris Frantz of Talking Heads. The tracks were never afforded a commercial release. Weymouth said of Ayers: \\"I mean she's twice my age [sic], but I'm learning from her and she's learning from me\\". After finding little success with the London-based bands Languish and The People's Friend, Kirsty Newton spent much of her time playing music with various artists down at The Kashmir Klub where she was originally to meet Ayers. She was asked to join musical comedian Mitch Benn as half of his band The Distractions and she still tours with him today. Galen Ayers next formed the band Galen. When Kirsty Newton auditioned as bass player for Galen in 2004, the two struck up a lasting musical affinity that was to blossom into a prolific songwriting partnership, among other things. Galen were never granted a commercial release and disbanded in 2005. Ayers and Newton then formed the group KG (an abbreviation of their Christian names) and performed on the London club scene. KG again failed to secure a record deal.  2008–present  In 2008, the duo decided to start again with a new name and christened themselves Siskin, following in a long tradition of ornithologically inspired band names – such as The Byrds, Penguin Cafe Orchestra and Cock Sparrer. They are named after the yellow-bellied siskin, which is a small, lively finch. They have said that the siskin is the only bird with a polyphonic call, which ornithologists attribute to simultaneous syringeal warbling and cloacal methane expulsion.Speciation and Biogeography of Birds, Ian Newton, Academic Press, 2003. \\"There's a yellow one and a red one – Kirsty is a redhead and I'm blonde,\\" Ayers has explained. But she adds that there is another, hidden significance in the band’s sibilant name: \\"Phonetically I love the combination of sisterhood and skin in the name\\". When Siskin failed to secure a recording contract for their songs, they had to distribute their material themselves and started their own label Siskin Music. According to the Daily Mirror, they caused a \\"minor stir\\" by recording Joe Jackson's 1979 hit \\"It's Different for Girls\\", putting feminine voices in a context that was previously limited to Jackson’s masculine voice. Jackson is said to have given their treatment \\"the thumbs up\\". The single failed to chart. On 31 July 2009, Siskin released a single, \\"Find a Better Life\\", and on 10 August 2009 an album, Siskin. The album was a limited edition pressing of 2000 copies.Siskin newsletter 30 July 2009 Neither single nor album charted. Ayers has stated that she and Newton \\"haven’t been chasing big deals\\", because they want to make music their way, without corporate interference. \\"If that means continuing to eat baked beans for some time\\", she has said, \\"so be it\\". Psychology and charity Galen Ayers has studied psychology and is quoted as saying: \\"When I studied psychology I discovered what an amazing tool music can be.\\" It was recently reported that Galen Ayers has worked with war victims and that this experience had inspired her music.

Biography John Wiley Brock was born in New Brockton, Alabama, on 15 August 1914. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy on 12 May 1936 at Birmingham, Alabama. After basic training at the Naval Training Station Norfolk in Norfolk, Virginia, he reported on board the battleship USS Arkansas (BB-33) on 5 February 1937. Transferred to Naval Air Station Norfolk on 21 May 1937, Brock was assigned to the receiving ship at Naval Operating Base Norfolk, serving as part of the detail fitting out the new aircraft carrier USS Yorktown (CV-5). During duty at Naval Air Station Norfolk which followed, he was advanced to the rate of seaman first class on 1 September 1937. On 30 September 1937, Brock was assigned to the staff of the Commander, Carrier Division 2, Rear Admiral Charles Adams Blakely. Promoted to aviation ordnanceman third class on 16 February 1938, Brock was transferred to Torpedo Squadron 6 soon afterward, on 15 April 1938. On 13 April 1939, Brock was assigned to Naval Air Station Pensacola at Pensacola, Florida, where he underwent flight training as a naval enlisted pilot.

Background Tideswell church, one of the most important parish churches in Derbyshire The church is widely known due to its size and splendour as the \\"Cathedral of the Peak\\" (it is not actually a cathedral). It is one of the most famous churches in Derbyshire, and a Grade I listed building. History In 1250–51, the church became embroiled in a dispute between Lichfield Cathedral and Lenton Priory in Nottinghamshire. Tideswell was one of a number of parishes that had been granted to Lenton Priory by the Peverel family during the 11th century. Following William Peverel the Younger's accusations of treason, the family's lands in the Peak District were seized by the crown and granted by King Henry II to his son, John (later John, King of England). After acceding to the throne, John granted the lands to the Bishop of Lichfield and in turn they passed to the Dean and Chapter of Lichfield Cathedral. This transfer started approximately 300 years of disagreement between the priory and cathedral about who was rightful owner of the property. Litigation continued throughout this period, including suits in the Vatican Court on several occasions. Tideswell church became directly involved in the disagreement when it became violent in 1250–51. The monks of Lenton Priory armed themselves and attempted to steal wool and lambs from Tideswell, which was one of the disputed parishes controlled by Lichfield. Pre-empting the monk's attack, the Dean of Lichfield cathedral ordered the wool and sheep to be kept within the nave of Tideswell church. However the monks of Lenton did not honour the church's sanctuary rights and broke into the building. A fight ensued and 18 lambs were killed within the church: either trampled under the horses' hooves or butchered by the attackers' weapons. The monks managed to carry off 14 of the lambs. A commission assembled by Pope Innocent IV harshly fined the monks of Lenton Priory. However the disputes continued until Lenton was dissolved by King Henry VIII. The church, which replaced a small Norman church, was constructed between approximately 1320 and 1400. The building work was delayed by the Black Death. There are two main styles: the nave, aisles and transepts are in late gothic style, and both the chancel and tower are in perpendicular style. There was major restoration started in 1873 by John Dando Sedding which was a genuine restoration rather than a reconstruction. The restoration work involved the replacement of the oak roof and re-leading. However, the restoration undertaken by the architect was viewed favourably by those who preferred the preservation of fabric rather than its replacement. The Manchester Courier and Lancashire General Advertiser wrote on 25 August 1874: > It is a relief to find so fine and pure a specimen of fourteenth century > architecture in trustworthy hands. We have not to complain here as in so > many instances of so-called restoration of that passion for the destruction > of old work which, on the plea of restoration, has removed some of the most > characteristic features of our ancient Gothic buildings. No single piece of > old work not obviously unfit from decay to remain has been allowed to > disappear. The mistakes of careless times have with great discrimination > been remedied; the old landmarks, where recoverable, have been restored, and > great judgement has evidently been exercised in the new work introduced The chapel in the south transept was restored as a gift of James Bower Brown of Woodthorpe Hall, Sheffield, under the supervision of Innocent and Brown, architects of Sheffield. The tomb of Sir Thurstan de Bower and Lady Margaret was reconstructed by the sculptor Thomas Earp of London. The chancel was reopened on 30 September 1875. The carving of the figures in stone and wood was executed by Mr. Green of Manchester, and the oak carving of the chancel stalls was done by Mr. Tooley of Bury St. Edmunds. The contractor for the stonework was Messrs. Hill of Tideswell. Restoration work continued until 1905, when the gallery of 1826 was removed from under the tower. John Oldrid Scott provided new south doors which contained panels cut from an oak beam taken from the Old Guild Hall in the village centre. The six upper panels were filled with traceried carving. In Churches and Chapels in The County of Derby, Rawlins described St John's as being: > without exception the most perfect and beautiful specimen of pointed > architecture to be found in the County, - or perhaps in any other parish > church of its size in the entire Kingdom.

In the middle of the chancel there is an altar tomb. Within lies Sir Samson Meverill (1388–1462), allegedly one of the victors of Agincourt. The tomb has a marble slab beneath which is a stone cadaver decorated with an alabaster frieze. The tomb was restored in 1876. In the South transept there are two chapels. The Lytton chapel has one of the old bells on the floor, while nearby is the tomb of Robert (d. 1483) and his wife Isabel (d. 1458) Lytton. Perhaps the church's most notable feature is the Bower Chapel. This contains a rather impressive tomb of (possibly) Sir Thurstan and his wife Margret de Bower. The inscription mentions de Bower, but there is some debate about the accuracy.http://texts.wishful- thinking.org.uk/PeakTraditions/ThurstandeBower.html The recumbent alabaster figures are well worn but remain impressive. The churchyard contains war graves of seven service personnel of World War I.

Following the premiere of the HGTV’s ‘Flip or Flop’ in 2013, the show’s hosts, Tarek and Christina El- Moussa, launched Real Estate Elevated. History Tarek and Christina El- Moussa became involved in the real estate flipping business shortly after the 2008 recession. They downsized their lifestyle so that they could begin investing in this new venture and they honed their skills over the years that followed. When they were approached by HGTV in 2013, house flipping was not yet mainstream. The show is now on its sixth season and the couple shares their knowledge and unique strategies through their Real Estate Elevated seminars that are held all over the United States. The Real Estate Elevated program was created to give individuals the tools necessary to start their own real estate flipping businesses. Aspiring investors are invited to attend a free seminar before deciding on an education plan that suits their individual goals. Origins Tarek and Christina El Moussa, like many in the U.S., suffered a significant financial crisis back in 2008. Their income dried up, and they were forced to downsize their home, their car, and their job. They struggled to regain the financial freedom they had previously enjoyed for a few years. Then they discovered house flipping. They flipped their first property in 2010, and never looked back. By 2012, they had been signed by HGTV to film a new reality show: Flip or Flop. The added publicity shed light on their growing expertise, and they started sharing their hard-won industry knowledge with other real estate investors. Their desire to share their method with those who want to achieve the same financial security as they did led to the founding of Real Estate Elevated—an education system that teaches would-be flippers how to be successful. Since then, Tarek and Christina have trained thousands of real estate experts, many of whom now train others in the Real Estate Elevated program. Concept In the last few decades, flipping houses has become a popular way to earn money, both as supplemental income, and as a primary occupation. Unlike many sources of income, however, there’s significant risk involved in the process. An inexperienced flipper stands to suffer significant losses on their investment if they make the wrong mistakes—a fact that can frequently serve as a barrier to entry for those wanting to join the industry. Real Estate Elevated helps new and less experienced flippers to minimize the risk involved by closing the knowledge gap. Real estate industry experts teach methods and tactics pioneered and refined by Tarek and Christina El Moussa, sharing their secrets for success to up-and-coming entrepreneurs. The training is provided in several different formats. It starts with a free two-and-a-half hour renovation training event that discusses the basics. The next step is a three day “Real Estate Accelerator Workshop” that goes into deeper detail on Real Estate Elevated’s methodologies. Beyond these primary trainings, they offer ongoing mentoring and coaching, including large events and one-on-one trainings. The trainings focus on critical parts of the flipping process, including how to find properties, how to get financing, how to create cash flow, and how to do wholesale deals. Habitat for Humanity After the Houston flooding in 2016, Real Estate Elevated donated $150,000 to Habitat for Humanity, an organization that helps people in need buy or repair homes. So far, the money has helped rebuild three homes that were damaged during the storm in the Houston, Texas area.

Louis' one-sided decision for King Henry led directly to the hostilities of the Second Barons' War. The conflict between king and magnates was caused by dissatisfaction with the influence of foreigners at court, and Henry's high level of taxation. In 1258 Henry was forced to accept the Provisions of Oxford that essentially left royal government in the hands of a council of magnates, but this document went through a long series of revocations and reinstatements. In 1263, as the country was on the brink of civil war, the two parties agreed to submit the matter to arbitration by the French king. Louis was a firm believer in the royal prerogative and decided clearly in favour of Henry. The outcome was unacceptable for the rebellious barons, and war between the two parties broke out almost immediately after the announcement of the settlement. After a victory at the Battle of Lewes in May 1264, Montfort took over control of government, but the success was short-lived. Henry's oldest son Edward – the later King Edward Istarted a military campaign that ended in the Battle of Evesham in August 1265, where Montfort was defeated and killed. Parts of the baronial resistance still held out, but by the end of 1266 the final garrison at Kenilworth Castle surrendered. The rebels were given pardons according to terms set out in the Dictum of Kenilworth. Background By 1264, the reign of Henry III was deeply troubled by disputes between the king and his nobility. The conflict was caused by several factors. One source of discontent was the influence two groups of royal favourites enjoyed at court: the Savoyards, relatives of Queen Eleanor of Provence, and the king's half- brothers, known as Poitevins or Lusignans. The native nobility were offended by the great political influence held by these foreigners. Secondly, the king had in 1254 accepted Pope Innocent IV's offer of the crown of Sicily for his younger son Edmund. The offer involved repelling the current Hohenstaufen rulers of the island, and proved to be very expensive. Lastly, there was a personal dispute between King Henry and one of his subjects, Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester. Montfort, a foreigner himself, was initially on good terms with Henry, and had in 1238 married the king's sister Eleanor. The two fell out, however, and Montfort became the leader of the opposition, together with Richard de Clare, Earl of Gloucester. In 1258, Henry was forced to accept the so-called Provisions of Oxford, whereby he effectively surrendered control of royal government to a council of magnates. In 1259 the baronial program of reform was further elaborated upon in the Provisions of Westminster. The provisions remained in effect for three years; at one point Henry's oldest son Edward – the later King Edward Ieven joined forces with Montfort. It was not until 1261 that Henry was able to move against the opposition. Receiving a papal annulment of the provisions, he reassumed control of government. Over the next two years, however, Henry's governing deteriorated the situation once more. He failed to reconcile with Montfort, and alienated Gloucester's son and heir Gilbert. In April 1263 Montfort returned to England after a long stay in France, and reignited the reform movement. On 16 July Henry was surrounded by rebel forces in the Tower of London, and once more forced to accept the conditions of the provisions. The Lord Edward, now firmly on the side of his father against Montfort, now took control of the situation. In October Edward took Windsor Castle, and the baronial alliance started to break up. Cornered, Montfort had to accept a truce and agree to submit the issue to arbitration by the French king Louis IX. Arguments and settlement Letter by which Henry III, King of England, took the King of France, Louis IX, to arbitrate his dispute with his barons, written at Windsor on October 16, 1263 (Document kept in Archives nationales (France), France On 28 December 1263 Henry left for France to present his case to King Louis. Montfort was prevented from attending by an accident, and he was represented by Peter de Montfort and others. Henry had already tried once before, in September, to appeal to the French king. That time Louis had been sympathetic to Henry's cause, but decided in favour of maintaining the provisions. At Amiens Henry argued that his right to appoint his own ministers and officials had been denied him, in violation of the royal prerogative. He also accused his opponents of destroying royal castles and laying waste to royal lands. For his injuries he demanded a compensation of the barons of £300,000 and 200,000 marks. Referring to the papal writ of annulment, Henry asked the French king to free him from observing the provisions forced upon him by the barons. Henry III doing homage to Louis IX of France. As Duke of Aquitaine, Henry was a vassal of the French king. Two documents survive of the barons' complaints. In the first of these, the barons reiterated the background of the conflict, and stressed the fact that the king himself had accepted the conditions of the provisions. Henry had in fact, in an effort to gain public support, pledged to uphold the provisions, a fact that was now made the most of. The document further goes on to explain the reform instituted by the baronial council. In order to restore law and peacekeeping to the country, the council had installed a new Chief Justiciar and Chancellor. They had also appointed new sheriffs in the counties, who were to be directly accountable to the government and be replaced annually. The king had violated these conditions, it was argued, when he had appointed his own chancellor and a number of sheriffs. He had also taken over custody of Winchester Castle, which had been given over to Montfort by the provisions. Furthermore, there were accusation made against individual royal adherents, such as Roger Mortimer for his military raids in the Welsh Marches. The second document goes into more detail on the king's alleged transgressions. By extortionate taxation, it was claimed, Henry had impoverished the land. He had also infringed the liberties of the Church, violated Magna Carta, and corrupted justice. When Louis IX made his decision on 23 January 1264, it was entirely in favour of Henry III. The settlement starts out by reiterating the declarations of the two parties, where they place the decision fully in the hands of the French king. Louis invoked the difficulties England had suffered over the previous years, and stressed the importance of a resolution. Since the pope had already invalidated the provisions, Louis decided to \\"...quash and invalidate all these provisions, ordinances, and obligations, or whatever else they may be called...\\", and absolved the king from any adherence to them. Castles that were handed over to the barons as part of the agreement were to be given back to the king, and Henry should be free to appoint his own ministers. The only concession made to the barons was a general pardon extended to those involved in the conflict. The financial demands of King Henry were not mentioned. Louis was a firm believer in the royal prerogative, and was never likely to embrace the precedents set by the barons' infringement of Henry's authority. There was also the papal annulment to take into account, which the deeply pious Louis was not going to ignore. At the same time, Henry's wife Eleanor of Provencewho was Louis' sister-in-lawhad worked hard to procure a favourable decision for her husband. It was clear from the start though, that the French king had gone too far in his partisan decision, and that the settlement was little more than a dead letter. Aftermath The settlement did not present a solution to the conflict, but rather a recipe for further problems. The one-sided decision for the king and against the barons left Montfort with little choice but armed rebellion. Hostilities started already in February, when Montfort's sons, Henry and Simon the Younger, attacked the possessions of Roger Mortimer in the Marches. Henry summoned the feudal army, and the royal forces won an important victory at Northampton, where the younger Simon was captured. Montfort was still in control of London, as Henry regained control over Kent and Sussex. Montfort marched out of London to negotiate, but the termsinvolving maintaining the provisionswere rejected by the king. The only option remaining was to fight, and the two forces met at Lewes on 14 May 1264. In spite of inferior numbers, the baronial forces led by Simon de Montfort won the battle. Edward, commanding the right wing, quickly defeated the London forces. When he set out in pursuit of the fleeing soldiers, however, he left the rest of the royal army open to attack by the baronial forces, who soon won the day. By the settlement called the Mise of Lewes, the provisions were reinstated and Edward was given over as hostage. Medieval manuscript showing Simon de Montfort's mutilated body at the field of Evesham The government led by Montfort soon ran into problems. He negotiated a treaty with Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, the Prince of Wales, an act that made him unpopular with the English Marcher lords. In May Edward escaped captivity, with the help of Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, who had now come over to the royal side.. Edward started on a campaign of re-conquest, while Montfort was forced to suppress a rebellion in the Marches. He succeeded only by making large concessions to Llewelyn, and then moved east to join forces with his son Simon. Edward, however, routed the younger Simon at Kenilworth Castle, and on 4 August 1265 Montfort found himself trapped at Evesham, forced to give battle with a much smaller army than the royals. The battle soon turned into a massacre; Montfort himself was killed and mutilated on the field. Even with Montfort dead resistance remained, particularly at the virtually impregnable Kenilworth Castle. In October 1266 the Dictum of Kenilworth set down terms by which the rebels could obtain pardons, and by the end of the year the garrison surrendered. Notes a. A \\"mise\\" in this context is a settlement by agreement.

The song was written entirely by the keyboardist Kevin Moore, and indeed its demo featured Moore on vocals. It is structured around a dark, brooding duet between Moore playing the piano and vocalist James LaBrie. The rest of the band kick in for a dramatic outro, fading out until Moore ends the song with the piano passage that opened the song. The song is interspersed with samples from A Room with a View, The Fifth Estate, Late Night with Conan O'Brien, The Trouble With Evan and a news commentary by Jim Hill during the O. J. Simpson freeway chase. History The song was composed by Moore while touring with Images and Words in 1993, and surfaced as part of a series of demos composed by him and that were not suitable for Dream Theater, but for his own experiment. Kevin Moore spoke to a Japanese interviewer regarding the meaning behind the song: > \\"I was looking through a clothing catalog and saw a picture of a girl > modeling this piece of clothing called a space-dye vest. And, so, I fell in > love with her [laughs] for some strange reason and so the minute I did that, > the minute I was just like obsessed with this person, I was like, 'why am I > doing that?' and I noticed that I was doing it a lot lately. And I think the > prime reason that I was doing that, and this is what I figured out at the > time, was that I had just come out of a relationship where I'd gotten > dumped, basically, and so I think the situation was that I wasn't finished > giving all that I was ready to give, so I was just, like, throwing it > around, you know, just aiming it in different directions. It was a total > case of projection. And this song is just trying to sort it out and just > kind of admitting that I'm just kind of lost. So it's kind of a dark song. > It was very cathartic though.\\" Vocalist James LaBrie said \\"Kevin Moore saw this photograph in a fashion magazine of a beautiful model wearing a space-dye vest and he fell in love with her,\\" \\"He carried that magazine around with him for ages, but he realized that the only way the innocence could be kept, so that he could retain that love for her, was if she stayed on the page. If he'd met her, all that would have been lost.\\" Portnoy recalled that when the rest of the band first heard the song \\"we thought it was so very, very different we didn't think we even wanted to fuck with it.\\" Aftermath and live performances Kevin Moore left Dream Theater after \\"Awake\\" was released on October 4, 1994. Out of respect, some members of the band had expressed that they were not willing to perform it without Moore. Portnoy commented that if they had known Moore was going to leave the band, they would not have included it on the album. He considered \\"Space-Dye Vest\\" \\"totally 100% [Moore's] song\\", and for that reason the band would never play the song live without Moore. Jordan Rudess, however, in an interview stated that he would like to play it live whenever the rest of the band is ready. Rudess performed the song live during a solo concert, with James LaBrie featuring as a guest vocalist. In 2009, the band begun jamming on the song during their \\"Black Clouds & Silver Linings\\" tour, though the song was never played in its entirety until 2014, when it was performed at almost every concert of their \\"Along for the Ride Tour\\", along with the other songs making up the second half of the Awake album, in honor of the album's 20th anniversary. The song was included in the live album Breaking the Fourth Wall.

The settlement was made on the day of the Battle of Lewes, one of the two major battles of the Second Barons' War. The conflict between king and magnates was caused by dissatisfaction with the influence of foreigners at court and Henry's high level and new methods of taxation. In 1258 Henry was forced to accept the Provisions of Oxford, which essentially left the royal government in the hands of a council of magnates, but this document went through a long series of revocations and reinstatements. In 1263, as the country was on the brink of civil war, the two parties agreed to submit the matter to arbitration by the French king Louis IX. Louis was a firm believer in the royal prerogative, and decided clearly in favour of Henry. The outcome was unacceptable for the rebellious barons, and war between the two parties broke out almost immediately. The Mise of Lewes was signed on the day of Montfort's victory at the Battle of Lewes, though it is not known whether it happened during or after the battle. Neither are the terms of the document known, though it seems clear that they involved conditions for further negotiations. These efforts at a permanent settlement fell through, however, and the support for Montfort's government gradually eroded. Henry's oldest son, Edward – the later King Edward Istarted a military campaign that ended in the Battle of Evesham in August 1265, where Montfort was defeated and killed. Parts of the baronial resistance still held out, but by the end of 1266 the final besieged garrison at Kenilworth Castle surrendered. The rebels were given pardons according to terms set out in the Dictum of Kenilworth. Background By 1264, the reign of Henry III was deeply troubled by disputes between the king and his nobility. The conflict was caused by several factors: the influence of foreigners at court, a wasteful war over the crown of Sicily, and a personal dispute between King Henry and Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester. In 1258, Henry was forced to accept the so-called Provisions of Oxford, whereby he effectively surrendered control of royal government to a council of magnates. In 1259 the baronial program of reform was further elaborated upon in the Provisions of Westminster. The provisions remained in effect for three years; it was not until 1261 that Henry was able to move against the opposition. Receiving the papal annulment of the provisions his emissaries had campaigned for, he re-assumed control of government. Over the next two years, however, discontent re-emerged over Henry's style of government. He failed to be reconciled with Montfort, and he also alienated Gloucester's son and heir Gilbert. In April 1263 Montfort returned to England after a long stay in France, and reignited the reform movement. On 16 July Henry was surrounded by rebel forces in the Tower of London, and once more forced to accept the conditions of the provisions. Prince Edwardthe later King Edward I – now took control of the situation. In October Edward took Windsor Castle, and the baronial alliance started to break up. Henry III doing homage to Louis IX of France. As Duke of Aquitaine, Henry was a vassal of the French king. Cornered, Montfort had to accept a truce and agree to submit the issue to arbitration by the French king Louis IX. By the Mise of Amiens, Louis decided entirely in favour of Henry, and repudiated the provisions. The settlement did not present a solution to the conflict, but rather a recipe for further problems. The one-sided decision for the king and against the barons left Montfort with little choice but armed rebellion. Hostilities started already in February, when Montfort's sons, Henry and Simon the Younger, attacked the possessions of Roger Mortimer in the Marches. Henry summoned the feudal army, and the royal forces won an important victory at Northampton, where the younger Simon was captured. Montfort was still in control of London, as Henry regained control over Kent and Sussex. Montfort marched out of London to negotiate, but the termsinvolving maintaining the provisionswere rejected by the king. The only option remaining was to fight, and the two forces met at Lewes on 14 May 1264. In spite of inferior numbers, the baronial forces led by Simon de Montfort won the battle. Edward, commanding the right wing, quickly defeated the London forces. When he set out in pursuit of the fleeing soldiers, however, he left the rest of the royal army exposed. The baronial forces took advantage of the situation, and soon won the day. Settlement Since no documents exist to confirm the content of the Mise of Lewes, there has been much debate among historians over its content, and the circumstances under which it was written. Noël Denholm-Young, in an article published in 1933, made a conjecture on what the main points of the agreement were. The first point, according to Denholm-Young, was that Prince Edward and his cousin, Henry of Almain, should be given over to the barons as hostages. Secondly, those of the baronial party who had been taken hostage at Northampton were to be released. Thirdly, those who had taken hostages from the royalist party at the Battle of Lewes were to receive ransom. Finally, it was agreed that a committee of French clergy and nobles should arbitrate over a permanent settlement. This interpretation has been largely followed by later historians. One contentious point in Denholm-Young's article was his assertion that there was no mention of the Provisions of Oxford in the Mise of Lewes. This was an idea that John Maddicott strongly contested in a 1983 article. According to Maddicott, the provisions had been at the centre of Montfort's opposition over the last six years, and it was unlikely that he would give them up so easily. Nevertheless, Montfort showed willingness to negotiate the terms of the provisions. As such, the Mise of Lewes was a moderate document; Montfort wanted to avoid a repetition of the situation after the Mise of Amiens. Rather it was external circumstances outside of Montfort's control that led to the eventual failure of the negotiations between the royalists and the barons. This interpretation was challenged by David Carpenter two years later, in 1985. Montfort had no intention to compromise with the royalists at all, according to Carpenter. In Carpenter's version of events, the Mise of Lewes was written while the battle was still ongoing, not after the battle was over, as previously assumed. This put Montfort in a situation where concessions were necessary, in order to bring hostilities to a halt as soon as possible. Once the battle was over and government in Montfort's hands, he had no longer any interest in reaching a compromise with the royalists, and that was why hostilities continued. This dating of the document, however, has later been disputed by D. W. Burton, who maintains that the document was in fact signed after the battle was concluded. Aftermath The government led by Montfort soon ran into problems; he faced poor finances, general disorder, and the threat of invasion from exiled royalists in France. It was decidedsince the French arbitration committee had come to nothingto set up a provisional administration, consisting of Montfort, the young Earl of Gloucester, and the Bishop of Chichester. These three were to elect a council of nine, to govern until a permanent settlement could be reached. By the Peace of Canterbury in August, Henry and Edward were forced to accept even stricter terms than those of the Mise of Lewes. According to this new agreement, the current form of government was to remain in force throughout the reign of King Henry, and into that of Edward. To keep the borders safe, Montfort had been forced to release Roger Mortimer and other royalist Marcher lords after the Battle of Lewes. In December, Montfort forced Mortimer, Roger de Clifford and Roger de Leybourne to promise to leave the country for Ireland. Then, in January, he summoned a parliament at Leicester which became known as Montfort's Parliament, including representatives from the shires and boroughs; an innovation in English government. Here Montfort secured the support of the community of the realm for his continued reign. Medieval manuscript showing Simon de Montfort's mutilated body at the field of Evesham Montfort's success was illusory, however. The terms of the Peace of Canterbury were rejected by a papal legate in negotiations at Boulogne. Meanwhile, the Marcher lords did not leave the country, and remained a thorn in the side of the regime. The triumvirate at the head of government broke up when the Earl of Gloucester defected to the royalist side. In May, Edward was able to escape captivity, with Gloucester's help.. Edward started on a campaign of re-conquest, while Montfort was forced to suppress a rebellion in the Marches. He succeeded only by making large concessions to Llewelyn, and then moved east to join forces with his son Simon. Edward, however, routed the younger Simon at Kenilworth Castle. On 4 August 1265 Montfort found himself trapped at Evesham, forced to give battle with a much smaller army than the royals. The battle soon turned into a massacre; Montfort himself was killed and mutilated on the field.

Though primarily classified as a reggae group, The Drastics embrace many styles of music both live and in the studio. This can be heard in their songs which draw from roots reggae, hip hop, jazz (mostly hard-bop), afro-beat, dancehall, as well as folk musics from Asia, Africa, the Middle East and South America.  Band history  Performing in Urbana, Illinois The Drastics formed in December 2003, playing their first show in March 2004 at Chicago's now defunct Fireside Bowl. Answering a Chicago Reader ad placed by guitarist Josh Rosenstock, the original 6 piece lineup formed and began playing originals and a handful of covers. Over the years, the group has changed from the original lineup. The Drastics first full-length album, Premonition was released on Chicago's JumpUp! Records. The album featured guest vocalists Craig Akira Fujita (Pressure Cooker, Joint Chiefs, 10 ft Ganja Plant), King Django (Stubborn All-Stars), Dr. Ring Ding (Senior All-Stars) as well as several local underground talents. Their second release, Chicago Massive, is a 2 disc album with 27 tracks and 24 guest musicians. Disc one is a strictly instrumental set while disc two features 12 different vocalists over 12 tracks. Guest vocalists include King Django, Dr. Ring Ding, Fada Dougou, MC Zulu, Dayna Lynn, Todd Hembrook (Deal's Gone Bad), and Corey Dixon (formerly of The Zvooks). Guest musicians on the first disc include reeds player Charles Gorzynski (Salamander, Video Gum Culture), beat makers Heavy Rotation, and trumpeter Rich Graiko (Westbound Train). The record went into production almost immediately following the release of Premonition and was completed over the course of the next 14 months. Though primarily (and originally strictly) instrumental, The Drastics have begun to perform more frequently with vocalists.

O'Barry transitioned from training dolphins to instead advocating against industries that keep dolphins in captivity, after one of the Flipper dolphins died in his arms. In 1996, a dolphin was seized from the Sugarloaf Dolphin Sanctuary, a corporation O'Barry worked for, for violating the Animal Welfare Act of 1966.http://www.publicaffairs.noaa.gov/pr96/jun96/noaa96-r144.html Dolphin Removed From Unsafe Conditions at Sugarloaf In 1999, O'Barry was fined for violating the Marine Mammal Protection Act as the result of illegally releasing two dolphins that were not able to survive in the wild.https://www.animallaw.info/case/matter-richard-obarry In the Matter of: Richard O'Barry, Lloyd A. Good, III, Sugarloaf Dolphin Sanctuary, Inc., The Dolphin Project, Inc., Respondents The dolphins sustained life-threatening injuries. In 1970, O'Barry founded the Dolphin Project, a group that aims to educate the public about captivity and, where feasible, free captive dolphins. He was featured in the Academy Award-winning film The Cove (2009), which used covert techniques to expose the yearly dolphin drive hunting that goes on in Taiji, Japan. Flipper Richard O'Barry started out capturing and training dolphins for the Miami Seaquarium and through the 1960s became the head trainer for the five dolphins who collectively played Flipper on the popular American TV show, while also serving as stunt double for show cast member Luke Halpin. When, in early 1970, a few years after production of Flipper had ended, Kathy, the dolphin who most often played Flipper, did not resurface for air, O'Barry considered the possibility that she had committed suicide, and concluded that capturing, displaying and training dolphins to perform tricks is wrong. Activism On Earth Day in 1970 he founded Dolphin Project, an organization dedicated to educating the public about the plight of dolphins in captivity. He also pioneered work to demonstrate rehabilitation and release as a viable alternative for captive dolphins. O’Barry has since released over twenty-five captive dolphins in Haiti, Colombia, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Brazil, The Bahamas and the United States. For the last 40 plus years O’Barry has spoken about the harmful effects of captivity on dolphins at lectures and conferences around the world. In 1991 in recognition of his contribution to the protection of dolphins, O’Barry received an Environmental Achievement Award, presented by the US Committee for the United Nations Environmental Program. In 2007, Ric and Helene O’Barry became consultants for the Earth Island Institute's International Marine Mammal Project.http://www.earthisland.org/assets/2007AnnualReport.pdf O'Barry resigned from his position at the Earth Island Institute in September 2014, due to disagreements with its management regarding the acceptance of funds from the tuna industry, and its use of Fish Aggregation Devices. Working with Ric O'Barry's Dolphin Project, he leads an international effort to stop the killing of dolphins, end the trafficking in live dolphins to theme parks and captive swim-with-the-dolphins attractions and continues to lecture and speak out against the captivity industry. O’Barry is co-author of three books, Behind the Dolphin Smile, To Free a Dolphin (both with Keith Colbourne) and most recently Die Bucht about dolphins and the making of The Cove published in Germany with Hans Peter Roth. Richard O’Barry is a Fellow National in the Explorers Club. O’Barry lives in Coconut Grove, Florida, US. O’Barry is Founder and is Director of the non-profit organization, Ric O'Barry's Dolphin Project Inc. In 2018, O’Barry was noted in the book, Rescuing Ladybugs Jennifer Skiff, Rescuing Ladybugs: Inspirational Encounters with Animals That Changed the World, New World Library, 2018 by author and animal advocate Jennifer Skiff as “the man leading the global fight to protect dolphins” after being moved to action after witnessing the death of a dolphin named Kathy who he had trained while employed by the Miami Seaquarium. Ibid. pages 188,191 Violation of the Marine Mammal Protection Act In 1996, O'Barry and Lloyd A. Good, III, working on behalf of Sugarloaf Dolphin Sanctuary and The Dolphin Project, violated the Marine Mammal Protection Act, a federal law that prohibits harassment of marine mammals. O'Barry violated federal law by releasing two dolphins that formerly participated in the U.S. Navy's marine mammal training program without properly preparing them for life in the wild.https://www.animallaw.info/case/matter-richard-obarry In the Matter of: Richard O'Barry, Lloyd A. Good, III, Sugarloaf Dolphin Sanctuary, Inc., The Dolphin Project, Inc., Respondents The dolphins, \\"Luther\\" and \\"Buck\\", were illegally transported without a permit from the U.S. Navy facility in San Diego, California to Key West, Florida despite their lack of skills that O'Barry and Good acknowledged were necessary for survival. As a result of this, Buck and Luther sustained life-threatening injuries and were found emaciated, begging for food, with deep laceration wounds by biologists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and required capture to nurse them back to health.https://marineanimalwelfare.blogspot.com/p/blog- page_19.html The Sugarloaf Dolphin Releaseshttps://dolphins.org/marine_mammal_law?aid=2 Marine Mammal Law - Dolphin Research Center O'Barry and Good were found guilty and charged civil penalties of $59,500 in 1999. The Cove O'Barry was featured in the Academy Award-winning feature-length documentary The Cove, directed by Louie Psihoyos which investigates links between the killing, capture, trade and display of dolphins all over the world. The 2009 film centers on Taiji, Wakayama, Japan, drawing attention to the hunt of about 2,000 dolphins taking place there every year. O’Barry and his son Lincoln O'Barry are also behind the Blood Dolphin$ TV show for Discovery’s Animal Planet, which continues on where The Cove left off.

The council represents area communities, area hotels, major area attractions, museums, restaurants, retail establishments, transportation companies and support services to the industry. The mission of the organization is “to increase tourism revenue and visitors through cooperative public/private partnerships; to market the exciting Dallas/Fort Worth/North Texas area as a travel destination; to educate the public on the economic importance of tourism and to provide support on tourism industry issues of concern to the region.” The council focuses on the promotion of the DFW area as a leisure destination to growing regional inbound market with heavy concentration on attracting visitors within a 500 mile radius. Today, in its 31st year of promoting the region, the council has grown from six founding cities and a handful of attractions to a member partnership of over 40 cities, in a 32 county area, representing over 150 organizational members in Dallas, Fort Worth and beyond. DFWATC is directed by an executive committee and board of directors and governed by a constitution and bylaws. History of the council The Council was formed in 1978 and known originally as the North Texas Tourism Council by the cities of Arlington, Dallas, Fort Worth and Irving. Within three years, they were joined by the cities of Grapevine and Grand Prairie. Formed to jointly market the entire Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex as a single destination, the council changed its name in the mid-eighties to the Dallas/Fort Worth Area Tourism Council. During the early years, the council primarily concentrated on the international market, an area not being addressed by individual members, as well as maintaining members in ABA, NTA and other similar organizations. In 1982, in response to membership requests, it shifted direction to address a growing regional inbound market with heavy concentration on attracting visitors within a 300-500 mile radius of the DFW area. While addressing the regional market as a primary target market, the council also addresses the domestic travel market and international market. Current activities By working together cooperatively with its member partners, the council is able to publish the Official Visitors Guide to the Dallas/Fort Worth Area and maintain its web presence through its web site , as well as lead extensive marketing and media efforts to showcase the area to travel consumers, tour and travel planners, travel journalists, and visitors both inbound and during their stay in the DFW area in a variety of ways. Notable among its strategy are the following: • Council-sponsored media familiarization tours into the area • Cooperative advertising through electronic and print media • Annual distribution of the 400,000 of the Official Visitors Guide • Press releases to local, regional and national media • Cooperative participation in travel and consumer shows • Council-sponsored events that reach specialized target market segments • Individual member opportunities for exposure to the media In 2009, the council started its Dallas/Fort Worth Area Tourism Council Foundation to promote educational endeavors to strengthen the North Texas hospitality and tourism industry and workforce. DFWATC Foundation The Dallas/Fort Worth Area Tourism Council Foundation is a 501c3 non-profit organization formed to help build the capabilities of the North Texas tourism workforce through education and training. Being a service based industry; a skilled and qualified workforce is vital to the success and future of tourism and the vitality of the area’s economy. By promoting, developing and utilizing existing educational materials, programs, courses that pertain to all aspects of the tourism-hospitality industry for university age levels and those already employed in the industry, the foundation aims to increase the knowledge base, education and skills of area workers and raise awareness of the tourism-hospitality industry as a viable career path thus ensuring a skilled and knowledgeable workforce. Tag Taggart Scholarship The Tag Taggart Scholarship was started in 2003. The purpose of the scholarship is to increase the number of students from the Dallas/Fort Worth region to seek out a career in the tourism industry in hopes that the recipients will become future leaders in that field.

It is also their first and last night before Horace joins the Army. The couple decides to buy some champagne and celebrate. Horace leaves to buy the bottle while Millie dims the lights and changes clothes in the bedroom.

Mooney and Richmond leave Saxton with the case, thinking Keesler is still in it. The trunk is opened and Horace tries to explain a mistake has been made. Saxton, along with Skinny (Gene O’Donnell), Tubby (Jim O’Gatty), and Dotty (Barbara Pepper), think that Horace is Duke wearing a disguise. Horace escapes and runs down the street, only to be arrested for indecency and returned to the hotel. Millie and Horace are snatched and coaxed to get into a car. They dodge the gangsters and hide in a movie theater, catching the tail end of the film with the lights coming on for a contest. Horace wins a prize before the audience departs. As he's on stage, Millie is taken away by the gangsters. Dotty meets up with a frantic Horace and takes him to the rest of the gangster group, where they discover Horace really isn't the Duke. They tie and gag he and Millie. To get attention, Horace turns on the radio, which happens to be turned to a gangster show. Neighbors think the mayhem and threats are for real. The police arrive and take the couple back to their hotel room. The real Duke's body is stuffed into the closet. Horace discovers it as he puts his robe away, with the 50 grand in his robe pocket. Frankie Saxton and the gang enter, but end up taken to jail. Millie and Horace are left, finally, to be alone in their room. Right before calling it a night, their 6 AM wakeup call arrives. They have to check out.  Cast  *John Beal as Horace Jason *Wanda McKay as Millie Jason *Warren Hymer as Pat Callahan *J.

A dramatic soprano, she was admired for both her musical and acting talent. She is best remembered for appearing in the world premieres of a number of operas by Antonín Dvořák and Bedřich Smetana. Biography Born Irma Keszlerová in Křivoklát, Reichová first sang publicly in 1874 at a festival honoring the building of a railway bridge near his hometown. Her local priest, , together with Prince Emil Furstenberg, were so amazed by her voice that they advised her parents to enroll her in singing lessons. Her family accordingly sent her to Prague where she studied under František Pivoda, the Director of the Prague School of Singing. She made her first public appearance in Prague as Senta in a concert version of Richard Wagner's Der fliegende Holländer. Shortly thereafter she was supposed to appear at the opera house in Teplice, but ill health prevented her from performing. She finally made her first staged opera appearance at the Provisional Theatre the following year. Her portrayal of Marguerita in Charles Gounod's Faust was so well received that the theatre's manager, Johann Nepomuk Maýr, offered her a long-term contract. She accepted and appeared in a number of operettas over the next year. In 1881 Bedřich Smetana invited Reichová to join his roster of artists at the then new Prague National Theatre. She accepted the offer, breaking her contract with the Provisional Theatre. She notably sang at the grand opening of the National Theatre on June 11, 1881 as the title heroine in the world premiere of Smetana's Libuše; a performance given in honor of the visit of Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria. Unfortunately the new house was destroyed two months later by a fire and the company had to perform at the Nové České Divadlo (New Czech Theatre) until the theatre could be rebuilt. At the New Czech Theatre, Reichová notably portrayed Hedvika in the first production of Smetana's The Devil's Wall on October 29, 1882 and Xenie Borisovna in the world premiere of Antonín Dvořák's Dimitrij on 8 October 1882. The National Theatre reopened on November 18, 1883 with a reprisal of Libuše with the same cast. In 1887, Reichová's love for Italian music brought her to Italy where she became fluent in Italian and made intensive studies of the major Italian repertoire. In 1888 she appeared at the Hungarian State Opera House, where she raised such enthusiasm that she was offered a permanent contract. She spent the next seven years as Budapest's leading soprano. In 1891 Reichová returned to Prague where she continued to sing and worked as a voice teacher. In 1927 she retired and lived the rest of her life in Bohemia. She died in Prague.

In close communion with the Protestant Federation of France, this church belongs to the Pentecostal movement and in 1969 founded the Evangelical Missionary Federation (Fédération Évangélique Missionnaire, or FEM) to gather the various Pentecostal churches it created. The assemblies, which developed very quickly throughout eastern and northern France, numbered well over 2,000 members. The church was founded by Aldo Benzi, who converted to Christianity after being healed from a pleurisy. Subsequent leader René Kennel, a former Mennonite farmer who became pastor of the churches in Saint-Dizier and in Joinville after discovering Pentecostalism through an evangelical Roma mission, has directed the church since 1977. Its main beliefs (expressed in a creed of eight articles of faith) and practices are nearly identical with those of most Evangelical and Pentecostal groups, with a special focus on miraculous gifts of the Holy Spirit and proselytism. In the late 1990s the church was embroiled in many trials (often on the grounds of defamation or for financial issues), losing most of them. In 2006 a sex scandal within the church led the federation to be dissolved, and the church in Besançon became independent. Since 1988 the church has been the subject of recurring public controversy; anti-cult associations and organizations (UNADFI, CCMM and MILS – then MIVILUDES), former members and the vast majority of media presented it as a dangerous group, mainly because of its intensive missionary activities and healing practices. The church was eventually listed as a cult in the 1995 and 1999 parliamentary reports established by the French National Assembly. Protestant and academic circles, however, disagreed with this assessment, considering the church to be a genuine Pentecostal group. The latter responded to criticism through a defensive strategy, which included outreach to sociologists and historians and better ties with mainstream religions, local and national institutions. History The founder, Aldo Benzi (born in 1919, now deceased), is said to have been miraculously healed of recurrent pleurisy by the Rev. De Siebenthal (a leader of religious groups in Switzerland), which led him to be baptized on 15 June 1941. Thereafter, with Pierre Nicole he created the Evangelical Pentecostal Church of Besançon (documented in files with the Prefecture of the Doubs in 1963). Benzi was the church's president, followed by Nicole and then by René Kennel in 1977.Amiotte-Suchet, 2006, p. 142. Kennel was born in 1925 to a Mennonite family who lived in Chassey-Beaupré. His father was a farmer and mayor of the city, and Kennel was expected to run the family farm when he was older.Amiotte-Suchet, 2006, pp. 703,704. At age 20, Kennel developed an interest in pastoral ministry and attended theological training at the Bible Institute of Nogent-sur-Marne in 1945–46, training that was later completed by studies at the European Mennonite Bible School in 1948–49.Fath, 2001, pp. 300,301. While still a farmer, he became a Mennonite missionary in the Meuse, Marne and Haute-Marne departments.Amiotte-Suchet, 2006, p. 143. In 1960, he discovered Pentecostalism through Roma missions, notably the Life and Light Evangelical Roma Mission (Mission Évangélique Tsigane \\"Vie et Lumière\\");Amiotte-Suchet, 2006, p. 144. he was attracted to this form of Christianity, since it emphasized missionary zeal and legitimized his ministry.Amiotte-Suchet, 2006, p. 145. He founded an evangelical group in his city, which caused conflict with his family, other religious leaders and his neighbors. In the early 1960s, Kennel became pastor of the church at Joinville; he conducted humanitarian activities on his farm, providing relief to homeless, former prisoners, drug addicts and alcoholics. In 1964, he also directed the church of Saint-Dizier; three years later, he decided to give up farming to fully devote himself to religious activities.Amiotte-Suchet, 2006, p. 706. In 1975 he was appointed treasurer of the Federation of Free Evangelical Pentecostals, and elected president seven years later. Under Kennel's leadership of the Pentecostal Church of Besançon, the church quickly opened many places of worship in Northern and Eastern France; Kennel trained pastors among his converts (including his son Étienne, who was ordained in 1981), and sent them to direct the new assemblies.Amiotte-Suchet, 2006, p. 707. In 1989 Kennel legally registered the Evangelical Missionary Federation, whose purpose was to federate all the churches (then composed of over thirty pastors). However, in 2005 Pastor Étienne Kennel was accused of adultery by church members, which resulted in his expulsion in January 2006\\\\. His father (considered guilty of covering up his son's actions) refused to retire, which led many believers to leave the church and pastors to vote for the federation's dissolution;Amiotte-Suchet, 2006, p. 152. this one was officially announced as defunct on 25 November 2006. 14 churches in the northwest, previously members of the FEM, are (as of 2011) gathered under the name Union of Missionary Churches (Union d'Églises Missionnaires, or UDEM), an association registered in Châlons-en-Champagne. Other places of worship are independent – including the church in Besançon, which was reregistered as an \\"Evangelical church\\" in late 2006. Beliefs Like other Pentecostal assemblies, the Evangelical Missionary Church of Besançon considers the Bible as the Word of God and interprets it literally. About his church Kennel said: \\"We are situated at the crossroads of the Pentecostal and Mennonite movements\\". Various explanations were provided by sociologists to define the place of the religious group within Christianity: Danièle Hervieu-Léger wrote that the church was created from \\"the meeting between a movement of evangelic sensibility inside the Reformed Church of Alsace and Lorraine, and a French Mennonite movement from the tradition of peaceful Anabaptism\\", Laurent Amiotte-Suchet considered that it \\"fits into the Assemblies of God\\", but also \\"in the history of a second wave of European Pentecostalism which experienced its revival in the 1970s and 1980s\\",Amiotte-Suchet, 2009, p. 98. and J. Gordon Melton described it, in his 2005 Encyclopedia of Protestantism, as one of the \\"newest Protestant groups\\". Evangelical Protestantism expert Sébastien Fath deemed the church a \\"non Baptist\\" group, but \\"with some common characteristics\\" and explained that it professed a very high degree of religious activism, embracing conversionism, biblicism and crucicentrism. According to the Protestant Federation of France, the church displayed a \\"classical and structured Pentecostalism, with very little contact with other churches.\\" The anti-cult association Centre contre les manipulations mentales said the church \\"comes from the classical Pentecostal movement which emerged in France in the 1950s and which now includes various groups\\".Centre Roger Ikor, 1995, p. 72. The church's main beliefs are expressed in a creed, initially composed of twelve articles of faith based on biblical passages and adopted by the church. These beliefs are almost identical to the ones of most evangelical and Pentecostal groups, including biblical authority viewed as the Word of God, literal biblical interpretation and the Trinity, with a special focus on miraculous gifts of the Holy Spirit and proselytism. Later, the number of articles of faith were reduced to eight points, and Amiotte-Suchet noted that they were reworded in 1998 to become less explicit concerning issues that were the subject of public controversies.Amiotte-Suchet, 2006, pp. 759,760. He also said that the pastors' sermons show an evolution linked to a generation gap; René Kennel continues to advocate healthy living, illustrating his speeches with stories of curses resulting from a non-Christian lifestyle, while his son placed more emphasis on \\"the discernment of spiritual gifts and the depth of faith\\".Amiotte-Suchet, 2006, p. 301. On its website the church defines itself as apolitical; it respects current principles of secularism and freedom of conscience, does not discourage medical treatment, encourages believers to participate in social life and does not claim exclusive salvation.

Each meeting is devoted to a particular Christian practice: evangelization, prayer, Bible reading, singing, and weekly worship.Amiotte-Suchet, 2006, p. 150. Meetings are composed of biblical sermons and studies, testimonies of religious experiences, hymns, meditation, worship, and prayers. Services are dynamic, charismatic and emotional, often evolving into ecstasy and trance; glossolalia results when the pastor calls the Holy Spirit to come upon the congregation,Amiotte-Suchet, 2009, p. 106. and usually lasts 30 to 60 minutes. Women must have their heads covered during worship.Amiotte-Suchet, 2006, p. 141. Pastors established a record of public testimonies of every baptized member.Amiotte-Suchet, 2006, p. 261. Kennel's life is known by the faithful, and has an important place in the church. The pastor's break with his former religious affiliation, and his determined foundation of a new group despite many obstacles, are said to be directed by God's will; therefore, Kennel's spiritual course (which mixes \\"extraordinary and intransigence\\") is presented as an example to follow.Amiotte-Suchet, 2009, pp. 99–101. As noted by Amiotte-Suchet, all testimonies (whose purpose is to strengthen the converts' faith) generally have a common thread; the former lifestyle of the faithful is almost always presented as \\"a story of an aimless wandering, covered with failures, disappointments and misfortunes\\" until God decides to manifest himself in the life of the future member. The future convert then demands a sign of God's reality, requires a variable length of time to strength his faith and experience the Holy Spirit, then engages fully in the church.Amiotte-Suchet, 2006, pp. 265,266,273,276. Conversion is always said to lead to a healthier lifestyle and provide an expanded network of friends.Amiotte-Suchet, 2006, pp. 333,334. All members actively participate in evangelization, both personally (family, friends and professional associates) and with the church (door-to-door, proselytism under the big tent and on public squares, \\"mission weeks\\", which follow a tightly planned program).Amiotte-Suchet, 2006, pp. 151,761. The church has denied practising proselytism among Christian people. However, after criticism of its methods the church became more discreet and avoided insisting publicly on miraculous healings, although it continued to highlight evangelization.Amiotte-Suchet, 2006, p. 148. In particular, it decided to stop proselytizing in hospitals, to discontinue loudspeakers in the streets, and to reduce the frequency of evangelization under the \\"big top\\".Amiotte-Suchet, 2006, p. 251. The church features religious instruction for various ages, leads a choir and football team and celebrates the Holy Thursday Last Supper, believers' marriages and funerals. Baptism is practiced by immersion with the pastor's approval,Amiotte-Suchet, 2006, p. 280. and is reserved for people aged over 15 years.Amiotte, 2006, p. 239. Fasting on two Sundays a month and between eight and ten conventions per year for each church are also scheduled. The church participates in social and humanitarian activities and organizes recreational days, including activities such as theater, library, trips, a clothing exchange and a paint shop.Fath, 2001, p. 302. Organization and finances Church headquarters at 4 Rue Larmet, Besançon The church headquarters in Besançon were first located in the Rue Battant, then in the Rue de Belfort, and eventually moved in 1994 to 4 Rue Larmet, in a building costing about four million francs.Amiotte-Suchet, 2006, pp. 711,712. In 1999, the federation associated with SOS Hope (SOS Espérance, established in Vesoul to assist suffering people), an evangelical musical group, Flambo, and La Bergerie in Besançon for property management. The church owns a printing house that publishes writings for worship and evangelization, including a quarterly newsletter, The Concierge's Ear (\\"L'Oreille du concierge\\"), which has been published since 2000.Amiotte-Suchet, 2006, p. 151. In 2005 René Kennel was the president, Daniel Gloeckler vice-president and church spokesman, Étienne Kennel secretary and R. Cuenot the treasurer of the federation.Amiotte-Suchet, 2006, p. 147. Each year, a one-week course is organized in one of the churches belonging to the Evangelical Missionary Federation; named \\"Blessing School\\" (\\"École de la bénédiction\\"), this intensive Bible training consists of prayers, religious teachings and history, singing lessons, film screenings and debates.Amiotte-Suchet, 2006, p. 289. In its organizational structure the church is similar to congregationalism, as the local assembly is autonomous. This form of congregationalism, however, is unique; the centralized organization gives to the Church of Besançon the role of head church, and the other assemblies of the federation are considered annex churches. Thus, Amiotte-Suchet opines that \\"the unifying spirit is much more coercive than the one in other Protestant groups\\". Decisions of the federation are made by all church pastors at monthly pastoral meetings. In the Church of Besançon, the leadership team attending the \\"brothers' meeting\\" is composed of René and Étienne Kennel, six appointed elders and men who have been members for a certain length of time.Amiotte-Suchet, 2006, p. 149. The church has been criticized for its wealth, as monthly or quarterly donations were encouraged in the second article of the statutes of the Federation of Evangelical Missionary. According to the CCMM, property acquisition was evidence of significant income.Centre Roger Ikor, 1995, p. 75. The 1999 parliamentary report considered the church a \\"small cult\\" (a cult whose annual income is less than five million francs), which provided \\"relatively accurate information\\" to the Parliamentary Commission. The annual budget of the church was estimated between 2.4 and 3.1 million francs (the total of donations in 1998 and 1995 respectively), mainly from Sunday offerings, donations, loans, financial products and property income. In 1999, the commission estimated the church's property at about 15 million francs. As of 31 December 1998, the church's net active wealth (composed of real estate and stock) reached 7.3 million francs. Concerning its finances, the church said it applies five major principles: economy, recovery, devotion, voluntary work and solidarity. Money comes from Sunday collections, sometimes from personal loans and from donations intended for a particular use; there is no external financial support. Accounts are published at the annual general assembly of the church, by the financial commission of the Federation and by Social Security. Trainee pastors work outside the church; permanent pastors receive a low salary, and are affiliated with the Caisse d'assurance vieillesse, invalidité et maladie des cultes (CAVIMAC). Membership Location of churches belonging to the Evangelical Missionary Federation Between 1977 and 1988, the Church of Besançon enjoyed significant growth,Amiotte-Suchet, 2006, p. 715. and Professor Grace Davie wrote that the whole religious movement had reached \\"the status of a small denomination\\" in the decades following its foundation. In 1983, there were 150 churchgoers in Besançon;Amiotte-Suchet, 2006, p. 708. in 1989, the number rose to between 400 and 600.Amiotte-Suchet, 2006, p. 709. In 1995, estimations of church membership by the Parliamentary Commission varied from 500 to 2,000 members. In 2000 the federation declared that 2,800 people regularly attend the Sunday service, including 600 in Besançon. In 2005 there were 4,000 members and 500 churchgoers at the Sunday worship in Besançon, according to Fath. In 2006, Amiotte-Suchet reported that the federation had 2,400 members and 37 pastors. He noted that criticism affected the church's growth; since 1988 the number of baptisms has fallen to about 50 a year, just enough to compensate for the number of people who leave the church.Amiotte- Suchet, 2006, p. 714. After the sex scandal in the founding church in 2006, attendance at the services in Besançon dropped to 70. In 1989, there were 18 assemblies belonging to the Evangelical Missionary Federation. In 1995 the church (then widely established in several French regions) was called \\"a big regional cult that has now spread throughout eastern France\\" by the CCMM. The following year, the parliamentary report of the National Assembly listed 24 places of worship; the church stated the list was incomplete and incorrect as three places were missed, and eight belonged to other churches. Before it was dissolved in 2006, the federation counted 35 churches. Court cases The Direction générale des impôts contested the religious status of the church and taxed its donations, saying \\"the association is devoted to proselytize. It has therefore not for exclusive purpose the celebration of a worship\\". As a result, a 600,000-franc tax-recovery notification was sent to the church on 20 December 1996,Fath, 2001, p. 306. which rose to 2.6 million francs two years later (penalties included). This tax was considered a \\"tragic situation\\" by Human Rights Without Frontiers and \\"fiscal and administrative harassment\\" by sociologist Régis Dericquebourg. The church deemed this decision discriminatory and tried by all possible legal means to challenge it. On 31 January 2013, the Church and its president Éric Salaûn were awarded 387,722 euros by the European Court of Human Rights, which overturned the tax considered a \\"material injury\\" and sentenced France for violating the freedom of thought, conscience and religion on the basis of the 9th article of the European Convention of Human Rights. On 29 September 1986, in a case related to custody of a six-year-old child, the Tribunal de Grande Instance de Besançon left the child with his father (who was not a member of the church) rather than with his mother (then a fervent member), stating that \\"people affiliated to [the church] submit their behavior of each time to the precepts of their beliefs, practice proselytism, and do not hesitate to involve some very young children in their meetings and religious practices\\". In 1992, the CCMM was sued twice by the church on the grounds of defamation. A first complaint was filed on 4 February after a letter from CCMM in which the movement was labelled as a cult, with the following definition: \\"Groups whose activities have on others for result a notable mental manipulation of minds, a profound degradation of the human person, managing to make people lose all critical sense in locking them in intellectual ghettos.\\" On 16 June 1993 the Court of Vesoul, and on 24 March 1994 the Court of Appeal of Besançon, sentenced the church to pay court costs and damages to the CCMM.Centre Roger Ikor, 1995, p. 74. In a second complaint filed on 27 November, the CCMM and the Centre Information Jeunesse in Haute-Saône were sued after distributing a publication critical of the church. Both complaints were dismissed. In 1996, the two appeals for cassation filed by the church were rejected; the court held that the CCMM's writings did not fall under defamation, said that damages to the church's honor were not proven, that \\"no reproach can be done when CCMM called 'cult' the Evangelical Church of Pentecost\\", and that the association \\"merely assesses the nature and trends of a religious community, reports some of its practices, including those relating to the disease healing and its methods of recruitment through agencies providing relief without indicating that they are the community's emanations\\". On 30 September 1999, the Administrative Court of Besançon recognized the religious status of the church and granted it tax exemption on its place of worship. In a decision issued on 2 October 2003, the judge of the Administrative Court stated that the refusal by the prefect to grant donations and bequests to the church was not supported by evidence. In 2008, MIVILUDES President Jean-Michel Roulet said that complaints from the faithful against Kennel for physical abuse were dismissed. Reception The French Parliamentary Commission on Cults included the church in the list of cults of the 1995 and 1999 parliamentary reports, based on reports by the Direction centrale des renseignements généraux that labelled the church as an \\"evangelical\\" and \\"healer\\" movement. Despite their similarities, other churches associated with the Evangelical Missionary Federation were not included in the list. The 1995 report said the group was among the \\"most active evangelical groups\\" and the Parliamentary Commission said they are \\"often motivated by genuine pastors who slid into the role of guru\\" and \\"always benefit from freedoms by Protestant official structures to prosper at their edge.\\" However, the parliamentary reports and the list of cults had no legal status and were criticized by religious historians, sociologists and academics. In May 2007, a circular by Prime Minister Jean- Pierre Raffarin and a statement by MIVILUDES secretary Gilles Bottine, said the list of movements attached to the 1995 parliamentary report had become less relevant and no longer recommended its use. Several anti-cult groups also considered the church a cult. The local branch of the Centre contre les manipulations mentales (CCMM, or Centre Roger Ikor) directed an intense campaign against the group with repeated warnings in the media, and the President of the Union nationale des associations de défense des familles et de l'individu (UNADFI), Catherine Picard, said on television that she considered the church a cult. Criticism against the Church includes methods of recruitment (considered aggressive proselytism) in psychiatric hospitals, schools, buses and similar environments directed to suffering people, a fundamentalist interpretation of the Bible, pressure on prospective members to quickly join the group, family breakdowns, identical language and clothing of followers reflecting a loss of individuality, education of children that is considered indoctrination, many banned activities (among them music, television, makeup and trousers for women who must also have long hair covered with a scarf), an hysterical environment at worship, desocialization of the faithful, excessive appeals for money, unverifiable and dubious healings that may be detrimental to members' health and the strong influence on members and lack of qualifications of Kennel.Centre Roger Ikor, 1995, p. 73. A delegate from the CCMM said that criticism was based on facts collected from former members and their families, some of which had been used in court (as in Vesoul). In response to writer in the Protestant journal Réforme Benoît Hervieu-Léger, who contended that a sole case in Besançon would have been sufficient to criticize the whole federation, the delegate also stated that complaints did not come exclusively from the church of Besançon. The association also noted many similarities with another Pentecostal church it considered a cult, the Mission of Full Gospel - Christian Open Door. As of 2010, MIVILUDES continued to monitor the Church of Besançon because of its hold over the faithful. The media were generally critical of the church, presenting it as a cult. The first negative local press articles appeared in 1988, mentioning miraculous healings, proselytism, Kennel's status, fundamentalist beliefs as controversial issues, and included critical reports by former members. Fath noted that the vocabulary and arguments used in the media were intentionally slanted and the repetition of those developed by the CCMM,Fath, 2001, pp. 302–04. and that the disproportionate media coverage of the church did not facilitate an objective investigation. According to a study by an expert in new religious movements, Massimo Introvigne, when a former member destroyed furniture belonging to the church in Langres in July 1994, anti-cult associations and some news media took the former member's side, presenting him as the \\"victim\\" of a \\"cult\\". On the French talk show Ça se discute (broadcast on 25 May 2005 on France 2), a father (whose nine-year-old daughter was a member of the church with her mother) said his daughter was brainwashed; he criticized her proselytism at school, closed-mindedness and the role of women in the church. He explained that when he had suffered from cancer two years earlier, she had tried to miraculously heal him; however, she considered him a liar and a sinner because of his homosexuality. He said he found her diary, in which she spoke of her imminent death when she would reach heaven to meet her grandparents. The association for the defense of religious freedom and conscience, CICNS, criticized the talk show for its lack of alternative viewpoints. Response to criticism Sébastien Fath, expert on evangelical Protestantism, researched the Evangelical Pentecostal Church of Besançon. Before 1988, the church was the subject of many neutral press articles and appeared \\"normal and respectable\\"; it contends that in the late 1980s Alain Vivien, then-leader of the CCMM, said to its representatives in Épernay that he did not consider it a cult. The church explained that the first criticism came from a Catholic vice-president of CCMM, who opposed the conversion to the Pentecostal church of his son-in-law and several seminarians (this explanation was later denied by the CCMM), by an educator hostile to the group,Fath, 2001, p. 313. and by other evangelicals (including pastor and co- founder of the anti-cult group Vigi-sectes Gérard Dagon, a source for the 1995 parliamentary report who was critical of Pentecostal beliefs). The church also reported discriminations after the publication of the report (including refusals of building permits) and to have spent, over a period of ten years, €82,000 in legal fees to defend its interests. Following the publication of the parliamentary report the church reacted by seeking help from academics and sociologists specializing in religious issues, including Jean Baubérot, Jean Séguy, Jean-Paul Willaime, Massimo Introvigne, Laurent Amiotte-Suchet, Bernard Blandre and Émile Poulat,Fath, 2001, pp. 308,309. who generally criticized its cult classification. Willaime and Poulat, among other sociologists, deemed the church's danger was never proven. Danièle Hervieu-Léger said the classification as a cult was an \\"absurd decision\\". Sébastien Fath considered the church \\"a bit radical but overall harmless\\", noting that this group had never been sued, and maintained that the church was criticized because of its proselytism and its rapid growth. Amiotte-Suchet deemed that the pastor's influence on the faithful was far from being as coercive as critics said.Amiotte-Suchet, 2006, p. 341. Poulat said, \\"We can debate whether it may be a 'sect' in the sense of Weber; it is certainly not a 'secte' [cult] in the popular and parliamentary sense of the term\\". Contacted by academics to participate in a documentary about the church, UNADFI and CCMM refused to explain their position.Fath, 2001, p. 311. The Center for Studies on New Religions said the church's theology is \\"clearly mainline\\", but was criticized \\"because it does not belong to the World Council of Churches or other establishment church bodies\\". The church established a dialogue with the Catholic Church and the Protestant Federation of France (FPF); the latter agreed to meet Daniel Gloeckler in Châlons-en-Champagne, and Étienne and René Kennel in Besançon. At first reluctant (since it did not want to serve as an \\"umbrella\\" against cult accusations), the FPF agreed to establish, at its meeting on 4–5 October 1997, a bilateral dialogue with the church and advised it to develop ecumenical ties;Fath, 2001, p. 307. it publicly deplored the cult status of the church on 22 January 1998. Many Protestant figures and churches (including FPF president Jean-Arnold de Clermont, the Protestant Church of Augsburg Confession of Alsace and Lorraine and the Salvation Army) provided support, expressing a favorable opinion of the church. The church also established ties with local and national institutions, such as administrative courts, municipalities and tax authorities. In 1996 it asked Alain Gest, a member of the French Parliamentary Commission on cults, the reason for its cult designation. In his response Gest did not provide details on the content of the work by the Direction centrale des renseignements généraux used for the report, but advised Kennel to ask the Observatoire interministériel sur les sectes for more information.Fath, 2001, pp. 305,318,319. On 4 June 1997 the church's representatives met the president of the Observatoire, prefect Antoine Guerrier de Dumast, who advised the movement to integrate the FPF to clarify the situation. The church also appealed to the European Center of Law and Justice, a Christian-oriented organization, to protect its freedom of religion and belief before the European Court of Human Rights.

Taylor Group. It is the fifth track on the band's second studio album, Love Won the Fight, and also the third single pulled from that album. In a departure of the norm of B. E. Taylor singing lead vocals, Joey d'Amico sings lead on this track. It also heavily uses synthesizers and a brass sections as the main instruments. The guitar's role is minimized to a steady strumming pattern with sustained power chords in the chorus. The lyrics tell the story of a man whose medical condition can only be treated with an unstable drug, called Vitamin L, that reacts \\"when boy meets girl\\". In the last verse it is revealed the drug was, in fact, love, and the man is cured of his ailment when he falls in love with a woman. This song is the B. E. Taylor Group's most popular song, as it peaked at #66 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1984 and stayed on the chart for eight weeks. The song also spawned a popular music video that scored heavy airplay on MTV. B. E. and Rick Witkowsi are featured as the doctor and pharmacist in the video, respectively. The song also is a near constant at live performances. B. E. Taylor later re-recorded this song on his first solo album, Try Love, as more of a rock song, getting rid of the synthesizers and making the bass, lead guitar, and drums much more involved. The lyrics in the verses have entire lines changed as well, mildly changing the story in the process, e.g. \\"A chemical reaction occurs/Every time that boys meets girl\\" to \\"It could keep us all in touch/But we can never take too much\\", erasing the idea that the vitamin is an unstable drug. Three whole lines in the third verse are changed, but these do not change the story in any way.

The film is also known as Desirable Lady, Flaming Girls, Hollywood Nights, Not Enough Clothes, Reckless Youth, Room for Love, and Strips and Blondes as American reissue titles. Plot Young Eve Lorraine (Jan Wiley) is an exotic dancer at the Club Cézanne in New York who is arrested for indecency while performing Salome's dance one night, when her manager Dan \\"Mac\\" McGrath (Phil Warren) is trying to make a greater impression and get her some publicity. In court Eve meets a bail-bondsman, Gus Hoffman (Eddie Dunn), who bails her out of jail. They talk to about Eve's background, where she mentions that her parents died when a theater collapsed somewhere twenty-three years ago, which makes Gus suspect that she is the rightful heir of the J.P. Sardam hair tonic empire and estate. There is a $1,000 reward for the one who finds the missing daughter of the Sardam spouses, who died during a Colorado theater collapse, which matches Eve's age and story. Hoffman talks to the lawyer handling the inheritance and reward, Thomas W. Campbell (Emmett Vogan), and he assures him that he indeed has found the missing child. The lawyer tells Hoffman that Eve will inherit millions of dollars. Hoffman brings the great news back to Eve, but her agent Mac warns her to trust Hoffman. Eve is overjoyed by the news, and goes off to the Sardam estate to meet her relatives. She is presented to uncle Horace (Edward Keane), his wife Lavinia (Betty Blythe) and their daughter Millicent (Marilyn McConnell). When they hear that she has been an exotic dancer and even been arrested especially Aunt Lavinia treat her like something the cat dragged in. But before the upset Eve can leave the mansion, she happens upon her great aunt visiting from Wyoming, Sarah Birch (Janet Scott), who turns her mind around. Sarah finds the colorful Eve interesting enough to accept an invitation to the Club Cézanne in New York. Eve gets a substantial advance on her inheritance and moves into an apartment that her uncle has rented for her. She persuades Sarah to come and live with her, and starts adapting to her new way of life, spending money on clothes and lessons in French. With the inheritance case still pending in court, Hoffman starts worrying about getting his share of the money and talks to her agent Mac about an immediate payment. Eve is asked by the Sardam's to perform at an upcoming upscale charity fundraiser, and she rehearses a pretentious Shakespeare piece to blow her audience away. Her efforts result in the audience laughing at her performance and she leaves the stage ashamed and humiliated. After the show she is offered $10,000 as compensation if she retracts her claim in the court, and is even more upset. She goes up on the stage again and performs one of her usual exotic dances, and now the audience is spellbound and impressed. Once Eve comes back to her apartment, Hoffman is there with Mac, demanding his share of the inheritance money. They struggle and Hoffman holds Mac at gunpoint. When Mac tries to take the gun, a shot fires and Hoffman is killed. Mac quickly flees the scene, leaving Eve alone in the apartment with the body. Eve is arrested for murdering Hoffman, but Mac eventually turns himself in and confesses to the killing. Campbell comes to the rescue, informing the police about Hoffman's previous conviction for forgery. Mac is released from jail for acting in self-defence and it turns out that Hoffman had forged the papers that say Eve is the heir of the Sardam estate. Still, both Sarah and Horace are convinced that Eve is the rightful heir, despite Hoffman's antics, and accept her claim. However, Eve decides to withdraw the claim entirely and move with Sarah to Wyoming. She changes her mind when Mac tells her that he has been in love with her the whole time and asks her to marry him.Synopsis at tcm.com Cast * Jan Wiley as Eve Lorraine / Eve Westland * Phil Warren as Dan \\"Mac\\" McGrath * Eddie Dunn as Gus Hoffman - Bail-Bondsman * Janet Scott as Aunt Sarah Birch * Emmett Vogan as Thomas W.

The title is derived from the final lines of the poem Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening by Robert Frost \\"Miles to go before I sleep\\". Plot The novel begins with a short prologue in which Will, on a visit to an eccentric neighbor, learns about protons, a microscopic particle of matter which, the neighbor tells him, is the indestructible building block of all matter. The impressionable Will wonders whether, because he is matter, he too is indestructible, narration soon revealing that, over the years since, he has come to believe exactly that. One day, however, Will learns that protons are, in fact, finite and do come to an end. His belief that part of him is indestructible is profoundly shaken, and he goes to school wondering what this news now means for his life, which up to that moment had been safe, secure, and predictable. That sense of safety and security is due, in a significant way, to Will's relationship with his friends Mi-Su and BT, with whom he has a regular Saturday night date to play Monopoly and eat pizza. That same sense of safety and security is further shaken when Will comes to realize he is beginning to have feelings for the playful, teasing Mi Su that go beyond friendship and, at the same time, feelings of resentment towards the free-spirited, seemingly irresponsible BT, who is in many ways everything the more buttoned-down, controlled Will is not. Meanwhile, Will's orderly life is also frequently disrupted by the attention- seeking tantrums and tricks of his younger sister Tabby who is indulged by his parents and his friends, much to Will's chagrin and irritation. As Will struggles to decide how to act on both his growing attraction to Mi Su and his intensifying resentment of his sister, he is shocked and angered when Tabby tells him she saw Mi Su and BT kissing. He then concocts several elaborate, detailed plans about how to get her to pay attention to him instead, plans which sometimes work (i.e. his plan to get her to kiss him) and sometimes don't (his plan to ask her to the dance). Both success and failure increase his romantic interest and, at the same time, increase his frustration that that interest isn't reciprocated in the way he'd like. Meanwhile, he makes preparations to again enter the chess tournament he won the previous year, but finds his attempts to practice disrupted by both Tabby and his obsessive thoughts about Mi Su. On the day of the chess tournament, Will is surprised and glad that he's doing well, but his winning streak is interrupted by the arrival of his father, who tells him that Tabby has been seriously injured in an accident. At the hospital, Will is confronted by the sight of Tabby covered in bruises and bandages, hooked up to a bank of monitors and medical equipment. He welcomes attempts by Mi Su and BT to comfort him, but it's only when his mother tells him surprising truths about Tabby's feelings for him that Will comes to realize how much his irritating little sister actually cares for him - and how much he, in turn, cares about her. As the result of these (and other) realizations, Will begins to let go of many of the beliefs, values, and rigidities he has come to believe about his life, and also begins to accept life's unpredictability. He returns to the hospital, and is with Tabby holding her hand as she comes out of her coma. In an epilogue, narration describes Will's happy, willing participation with Tabby in an event that welcomes her into the new world of school and which, in the symbolic language of the narrative, welcomes him into a new way of looking at, and relating to, the world.

Each diocese has its own board. Collectively the Catholic Church runs 534 schools, 8 colleges, and 7 technical institutes in its 2 archdioceses, 4 dioceses, and one Apostolic Prefecture. The Government of Pakistan nationalised most church schools and colleges in Punjab and Sindh in 1972. Elite schools such as St Patrick's High School, Karachi, St Joseph's Convent School (Karachi) and St Michael's Convent School were never nationalised. The Government of Sindh oversaw a denationalization program from 1985 to 1995, and the Government of Punjab began a similar program in 1996. In 2001, the Federal Government and the courts ordered the provincial governments to complete the denationalization process.

Early life Prince Bernhart was born in Marburg the son of Christian-Heinrich, Prince of Sayn-Wittgenstein- Hohenstein and Princess Dagmar of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Hohenstein (1919–2003). Peronal life Prince Bernhart was married at Castle Schwarzenau, Germany on 31 August 1996 to Countess Katharina von Podewils-Dürniz, the daughter of diplomat Count Max von Podewils-Dürniz and his wife Baroness Elisabeth von Hirschberg. She has a doctorate in Art History and in 2003 was appointed Sotheby's representative in Hamburg. The couple have one child, Wenzel Max, Hereditary Prince (Erbprinz) of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Hohenstein (b. 1997). Career Prince Bernhart is Chairman of the Board of the Fürst Wittgenstein\`sche Waldbesitzergesellschaft Forestry company and also joint Managing Director of Verlag Dashoefer' publishers. He was the patron of the 300th Anniversary celebrations for the Schwarzenau Brethren, which were held on his estate in 2008. Succession to the Hohenstein secundogeniture Four dynastic branches of the princely House of Sayn were extant at the beginning of the 20th century, each possessing its own secundogeniture.Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels, Fürstliche Häuser Band XIX. \\"Sayn-Wittgenstein\\". C.A. Starke Verlag, 2011, pp.314-338. German. .Almanach de Gotha Sayn und Wittgenstein. Justus Perthes, 1944, pp.284-291. French. In order of seniority of legitimate descent from their progenitor, Ludwig I, Count of Sayn- Wittgenstein (1532-1605), they were the: #Princes (Fürsten) zu Sayn- Wittgenstein-Berleburg, descended from Count Georg (1565-1631) #Princes (Fürsten) zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Sayn, descended from Count Christian Ludwig (1725-1797) #Counts zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg, descended from Count Georg Ernst (1735-1792) #Princes (Fürsten) zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Hohenstein, descended from Count Ludwig (1571-1634) Some of these lines had junior branches, dynastic and non-dynastic, the latter including families whose right to the princely title was recognized by the Russian, Prussian and Bavarian monarchies, whereas other morganatic branches used lesser titles in Germany. On the death of Ludwig, 3rd Prince of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Sayn in 1912, the eldest of his three sons, Hereditary Prince August (1868-1947), became 4th Prince of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Hohenstein and head of the third branch of the House of Sayn. Being a childless bachelor, the elder of whose two younger brothers, Georg (1873-1960), had married morganatically, while the younger, Wilhelm (1877-1958), was 49 and yet unmarried, August preserved the name and heritage of his branch of the House of Sayn by adopting Christian Heinrich Prinz zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg (1908-1953). He was the second son of the late head of the entire House of Sayn, Richard, 4th Prince of Sayn- Wittgenstein-Berleburg (1882-1925), whose eldest son, Gustav Albrecht, 5th Prince of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg (1907-1944) had inherited the senior line's fortune and position. In November 1960 Christian Heinrich, being the divorced father of two daughters by his dynastic marriage to Beatrix Grafin von Bismarck-Schönhausen (1921-2006), married Dagmar Prinzessin zu Sayn- Wittgenstein-Hohenstein (1919-2002), elder daughter of his adopted father's younger brother, Georg, who died seven months before the wedding. As Georg's children by his morganatic wife, Marie Rühm, (created Baroness von Freusburg by the reigning Prince of Lippe in 1916) had been de-morganatized by declaration of their uncle August on 11 February 1947, her marriage to Christian Heinrich was deemed a dynastic match, ensuring that their son Bernhart would be born in compliance with the house laws of his adoptive ancestors, the Sayn-Wittgenstein-Hohensteins, as well as being a grandson of the last dynastic male of that family, Prince Georg.

He won an Ulster Senior Football Championship with the county, as well as Ulster Minor, Ulster Under 21, All-Ireland Minor and All-Ireland Under 21 Football Championships. Niblock started his club career with O'Donovan Rossa Magherafelt (and returned to win a Derry Senior Football Championship with the club). He later played for various club sides in the United States. Upon returning to Ireland he played for Douglas and Nemo Rangers in County Cork. He had much success with Nemo, including winning ? Cork Championships, ? Munster Club Championships and two All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championships. He usually played in the half forward line, but could also play in midfield. Niblock is known as one of Derry's best ever players. He \\"glided through the heart of defences with consummate ease\\" and was known for his \\"silky skills\\". Personal life Niblock is originally from Magherafelt. His uncle Frank was part of the Derry side that won the county's first ever National Football League title in 1947. Frank was a big influence on Mickey during his early years. Mickey's brothers Laurence, Dermot, Hugh, Brendan and twins Robert and Raymond all played for Magherafelt alongside him, with Hugh also playing for Derry. Niblock emigrated from Ireland to the United States in 1971. He met his wife Dolores (from Youghal, County Cork) while in New York City. While there, Niblock played soccer for the New York Cosmos in the North American Soccer League (NASL) 1973 season. He and Dolores returned from America in 1978 and settled down in Cork. He has two sons, Trevor and David. Niblock's son David has played for Cork in the past. Playing career Club Niblock played his underage football with home-club O'Donovan Rossa Magherafelt and soon progressed to the club's Senior team. For the seven years he was in the United States between 1971 and 1978, Niblock played for a variety of clubs. In New York he played for the Monaghan club, before later transferring to Sligo. He won Championships with both teams. When his team wasn't in action on certain weekends, he'd go to play for clubs in the likes of Chicago, Philadelphia or Boston, for example he often played for Tyrone in Philadelphia. When he moved back to Ireland in 1978 Niblock played with Intermediate Cork side Douglas for a while. While there he travelled home and helped Magherafelt win the 1978 Derry Senior Football Championship. It was the Magherafelt's first county title in 29 years. It is a breach of the rules to play for two clubs in different counties at the same time, but as Niblock says \\"I couldn't resist it. Three of my brothers were playing in that final and it gave me a great thrill to win the Championship alongside them\\". That minor indiscretion deprived him of the opportunity to play for Cork, but he has no regrets. He was later advised that Nemo Rangers were a more football orientated club than Douglas and he soon transferred to them. His honours with the club include ? Cork Championships, ? Munster Club Championships and two All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championships (1982 and 1984). He retired from club football in 1992. Inter-county Niblock first came to prominence as part of the Derry Minor side that won both the Ulster Minor and All-Ireland Minor Championships in 1965, beating Cavan and Kerry in the respective finals. He played at centre half forward on the team. The success was Derry's first ever All-Ireland Minor title. Three years later he helped the Derry Under-21 team win both the Ulster Under 21 and All-Ireland Under 21 Championships. Having reached the Ulster Under 21 final, they beat Monaghan. In the All-Ireland semi-final Derry defeated a fancied Kerry team with ease. In the All-Ireland final Derry met Offaly in Croke Park and won 3-09 to 1-09, with Niblock scoring 1-01 from centre half forward. The success was Derry's first ever All-Ireland Under 21 title. Niblock made his Derry Senior debut in 1966, while still a Minor. In 1970 Niblock helped Derry win the Ulster Senior Football Championship, overcoming Antrim in the final. Derry met Kerry in the All-Ireland semi-final, but were defeated. The following year Derry lost to Down in the Ulster final. Niblock scored 2-04 from play, a record which was overtaken by Tyrone's Frank McGuigan in 1984. Later that year he emigrated to America, interrupting his inter-county career. He flew home from New York to play for Derry in the 1972-1973 National Football League semi-final against Kerry in Croke Park. It was Niblock's last game for the county. Niblock was later selected to play for Cork, but couldn't due to the indiscretion about playing for two clubs at once (see above). Province Niblock represented Ulster and won a Railway Cup with the province in 1970. Coaching / management career Currently Managing Cork Club Douglas. Honours Club Inter-county Province Individual Note: The above lists may be incomplete. Please add any other honours you know of. Soccer Niblock was also a talented soccer player, and teams he had trials for include Cork Hibernians. After eimgrating to New York in 1971, he was signed by the New York Cosmos in June 1973 and played in the North American Soccer League (NASL) 1973 season. Wearing the number 7 shirt, he contributed one assist for the Cosmos in seven appearances.

Students in senior year are highly advised to begin college applications the first semester and to wait for admission decisions to come the second semester of senior year. Higher education In the United States, the fourth year of an undergraduate program is known as senior year. Many bachelor's degree programs are designed to be completed in these four years. Students in their senior year will often be looking into job placements or post-graduate educational opportunities such as graduate school, medical school, or law school.

Life Torkar was born in a Slovene family in the village of Kostanjevica na Krasu, then part of the Austro-Hungarian County of Gorizia and Gradisca, now in Slovenia. He attended the Poljane Grammar School in Ljubljana. His teachers included the literary historian France Koblar, the writer Juš Kozak, and the painter Božidar Jakac. In 1932, he enrolled in the University of Ljubljana, where he studied law for one year. Then he studied chemistry and graduated as chemistry engineer in 1942. He was a member of several left-wing student groups that advocated the autonomy of Slovenia within the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and the democratization of the country. Among other things, he led a student association that successfully advocated the construction of a new university library building in Ljubljana. During this time, he published his first short stories and essays under the pseudonym Igor Torkar in the literary journal Sodobnost. He also wrote political satires in the satirical magazine Pavliha, some of which were censored by the authorities of the Drava Banovina. After the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, he became an activist of the Liberation Front of the Slovenian People. He never joined the partisan resistance, but organized the collection of supplies for the fighting units of the Communist resistance. In 1942, he was arrested by the Italian occupation authorities, but was released after two months in prison. In 1943, he was arrested by the Nazi German occupation forces and sent to Dachau concentration camp, where he remained until the end of World War II. After the war, Torkar returned to Yugoslavia, where he worked as a technical manager in a chemical industry complex in Slovenia. In April 1948, he was arrested by the Yugoslav Communist authorities on false charges of pro-Nazi activity during World War II. He was put on trial at the Dachau trials together with another 33 survivors from Dachau and Buchenwald concentration camps who were accused of collaboration with the German Gestapo because, according to the prosecution, only collaboration could explain their survival.Kranjc, Gregor Joseph. 2013.

In 1949, he was sentenced to six years in prison, which was increased to 12 after the appeal. Torkar spent four years in prison, including two years in solitary confinement. He was released in 1952, and was prohibited from publishing for two more years. After two years of unemployment, Torkar became a lecturer at the Academy of Fine Arts in Ljubljana. In 1976, he rose to the position of professor of graphic technology. In 1971, the High Court of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia nullified the sentence from 1949, and Torkar was acquitted of all charges. From the 1990s onward, Torkar became a critical commentator and observer of the democratization of Slovenia, with regular columns in the newspapers Delo and Dnevnik. In October 2003, on the occasion of the author's 90th birthday, Slovenian National Television broadcast a documentary with the title 'Dying in Installments,' dedicated to Torkar's life story. He died on January 1, 2004, in Ljubljana. Work Torkar's literary opus is framed by poetry. He published his first volume of poetry, The Crazy Chronos (Blazni Kronos) in 1940, with his last collection of poems, Songs of Solitude (Pesmi osekle samosti), written in the last years of his life and published in 2003. He has written over 10 collections of poetry, over 20 plays which were played on renewed theatre stages in Slovenia and also in former Yugoslavia, numerous TV and radio scenarios and novels. Between his most prominent works are also the poetry collection Sonnets from Jail (Jetniški soneti, 1974), stage plays Colorful ball (Pisana žoga, 1955) and Golden youth (Zlata mladina, 1970) and the novel Tenth brothers (Deseti bratje, 1979). His best-known work, in which he publicly revealed the taboo theme of the Dachau trails under the communist regime in the former Yugoslavia, is the novel Dying in Installments (Umiranje na obroke), published in 1984. The work was recognized as very courageous political act and triggered an extraordinary public response and awareness of the communist repression. In a deeply moving novel we meet with memory material, documents and literary fiction. More than 30000 copies were published; the novel is translated into Serbo-Croatian (Umiranje na rate, published at Globus, Zagreb, 1984) and German (Sterben auf Raten, published at Drava, Klagenfurt, 1991). In all his texts, Torkar expressed an outward humanistic vision of the world. Together with his lifelong friend, the poet Matej Bor, Torkar was the foremost representative of the neo-humanist trend in Slovenian literature.

It was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1976 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.  Description  The Edisen Fishery is a collection of seven buildings making up a commercial fishery.Edisen Fishery from the state of Michigan, retrieved 8/20/09 The complex includes a single-story fish house and net house, cabins, a chicken coop, whaleboat, and ancillary docks and fishing equipment. All buildings are constructed from logs covered with tongue-and-groove siding. Fish House: The fish house is a one-story gable roof building constructed half of horizontal logs with saddle notching, and half of frame construction with vertical flushboarding. It was constructed in 1900. Residence: The house was also built in about 1900. It is a small one-story combination horizontal log and shiplapped building, with a gable roof and on a log foundation. There are two entrances to the three-room house, with random window locations. The interior has wooden tongue-in-groove floors. Net House: The net house was constructed in 1895. It is a single-story building, built as a combination of saddle-notched, horizontal log construction on one half and a frame structure with a shed roof with horizontal planks on the other. The exterior is sheathed with tarpaper, and there is a simple plank door. \\"Honeymoon\\" Cabin: An auxiliary sleeping cabin, built in 1925 by Peter Edisen. It is a one-story, one room, frame shiplapped structure built on a log foundation with a gable roof. A simple, two-paneled door is located on one elevation, and a small window on another. Sleeping Cabin: Another sleeping cabin dates to 1895. It is a one-story building constructed of horizontal logs with saddle notching, and chinked with moss and cloth. It has a gable roof covered with asphalt. One elevation contains a vertical plank door. Chicken Coop: The chicken coop was built in 1934.

Privy: The privy is of later construction, and is a frame building with horizontal plank walls and a shed roof sheathed with asphalt shingles. A vertical plank door is in one elevation.  History  In the 1880s, the fishing industry around Isle Royale was booming due to the relative ease of shipping goods via refrigerated rail cars. The fishing population was composed primarily of Scandinavians fishing at Isle Royale in the April–November months, and returning to their homes on shore during the winter. Two such fishermen, a Mr. Mattson and Mr. Anderson, established this fishery, building a log cabin and net house in 1895, and a main residence and fish house in 1900. The buildings were constructed using easily available local materials and built using strictly functional designs. In 1905, Mike Johnson purchased this fishery. In 1916, Peter and Laura Edisen, Johnson's daughter and son-in- law, began fishing here. The fishery was in fact named for Pete Edisen, one of the last commercial fishermen on Isle Royale.National Geographic Society (2009). National Geographic Guide to the National Parks of the United States, 6th Ed., p. 83. National Geographic Books. The Johnsons and Edisens added a sleeping cabin and chicken coop to the complex in 1925 and 1934, respectively. The Edisens lived in the net house until 1951, when they moved into the main residence and the net house was converted back to its original use.

He briefly served as a diplomat and an ambassador, representing Joseon interests in the Tongsinsa (diplomatic mission) to the Ashikaga shogunate (Muromachi bafuku) in Japan.Kang, Jae-eun, and Suzanne Lee. (2006). The Land of Scholars: Two Thousand Years of Korean Confucianism, p. 241 1443 mission to Japan King Sejong dispatched a diplomatic mission to Japan in 1443, which was the 25th year of King Sejong's rule. This embassy to court of Ashikaga Yoshimasa in Kamakura was led by Kyeon Hyo-mun. Its purpose was to offer condolences on the death of Ashikaga Yoshinori and congratulations on the accession of Ashikaga Yoshikatsu.Kang, Etsuko H. (1997). Diplomacy and Ideology in Japanese-Korean Relations: from the Fifteenth to the Eighteenth Century, p. 275; Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). Annales des empereurs du japon, p. 342. The Japanese hosts may have construed this mission as tending to confirm a Japanocentric world order.Arano Yasunori (2005). \\"The Formation of A Japanocentric World Order,\\" The International Journal of Asian Studies, vol. 2, pp 185-216. Byeon Hyo- mun's actions were more narrowly focused in negotiating protocols for Joseon- Japan diplomatic relations. Korean diplomatic efforts produced an agreement in 1443, also called the \\"Kakitsu treaty\\" after the Japanese era name (nengō) which identify the years 1441 through 1444. The agreement regularized an initial plan for mitigating the damage caused by pirates. The bilateral agreement assigned the responsibility for monitoring ships from Japan en route to Korea. The Sō clan of Tsushima han (Tsushima Island) were given the right to license ships sailing west beyond Tsushima; and this also encompassed the opportunity to profit from whatever fees the Sō might charge.Hall, John Whitney. (1997). The Cambridge History of Japan: Early Modern Japan, p. 244. Recognition in the West Byeon Hyo-mun's historical significance was confirmed when his mission was specifically mentioned in a widely distributed history published by the Oriental Translation Fund in 1834.Titsingh, p. 342. In the West, early published accounts of the Joseon kingdom are not extensive, but they are found in Sangoku Tsūran Zusetsu (published in Paris in 1832),Vos, Ken. \\"Accidental acquisitions: The nineteenth-century Korean collections in the National Museum of Ethnology, Part 1,\\" p. 6. and in Nihon ōdai ichiran (published in Paris in 1834).

In the years following this period theatre in decay toured two of their most acclaimed shows to Adelaide Fringe and produced a multi-award winning puppet show for the Short and Sweet 10-minute play festival.http://www.shortandsweet.org/shortsweet/melbourne/2005 Frustrated with the amount and quality of new Australian theatre being produced at the time, Stockton and Reid formed theatre in decay as a direct response to what they saw as an industry wide malaise. In their original 2000 manifesto, entitled \\"This isn’t Art, it’s War\\",http://www.girlofyesteryear.com/reception.html they declared “We believe that theatre has nothing to do with money. That live performance is much more than just pretty costumes and impressive sets.
