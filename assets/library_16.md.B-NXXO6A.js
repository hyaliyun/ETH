He co-founded with his wife Marian Joh, Andrews Space in 1999, founded Spaceflight Inc. in 2010, BlackSky Global LLC in 2013, and integrated all three entities together in 2015 under Spaceflight Industries. From 2013 to 2018 Andrews raised over $200 million in capital to fund the development and growth of the BlackSky business plan. Early life and education Andrews grew up in Seattle, Washington and attended the University of Washington where he graduated with a BS in Aerospace Engineering. In 1995, he joined Kistler Aerospace in Kirkland Washington, one of the early space startups developing a fully reusable two stage launch vehicle to serve the emerging LEO communications market. His first role was as launch vehicle performance analyst, where he developed the \\"rocket back\\" trajectory to recover the first stage at the launch site. Andrews then led the Kistler propulsion system development contracts with Pratt & Whitney and Aerojet, and went on to manage the K-1 vehicle integration team located in El Segundo, California.  Andrews Space, Inc.  Andrews left Kistler in late 1998 and started Andrews Space & Technology in July 1999; the name was shortened to Andrews Space in 2003. The company's first two contracts were a NASA Phase 1 SBIR to develop the Mini-Mag Orion Propulsion System, and supporting Buzz Aldrin's company Starcraft Boosters. Andrews led day-to-day operations as President, working with his father (Dana Andrews - CTO) and wife (Marian Joh - CEO). In 2007 the firm diversified into space hardware and acquired Automated Controlled Environments Inc (ACEi), a company focused on nanosat subsystems. Andrews was one of the first people to identify and articulate the ‚Äúkiller app‚Äù for cubesats and nanosats: deployment of swarms of spacecraft to observe the planet in near real time. From 2008-2012 his firm developed a series of cubesat and nanosat products, many as part of a contract with the US Army Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC) to study how to ‚Äúput UAVs in space‚Äù, which required deploying a constellation of nanosats to observe the planet in near real time. This effort would evolve into the Kestrel Eye 2 spacecraft development effort.  Spaceflight, Inc.  In 2009 Andrews founded Spaceflight Inc as the first ‚Äúcommercial spaceline‚Äù; the company did not build or own rockets, but instead provided space transportation services via rideshare on all existing rockets. Spaceflight addressed the emerging need to launch cubesats and nanosats, vehicles that were too small to buy their own launch vehicles. Spaceflight established classes of launch services by volume and mass for satellites weighing up to 1,000 kilogram, and published list pricing. Over the next eight years the firm built a $75 million a year business. Spaceflight signed its first customer contract in October 2011 with Cosmogia (which later changed its name to Planet Labs, and then just Planet). It conducted its first two launches in April 2013, which launched within hours of each other: one on a Russian Soyuz launch vehicle and the other on the maiden launch of the Orbital Antares launch vehicle. From 2013-2018 the company launched over 210 spacecraft for different customers.  BlackSky Global LLC  In 2013 Andrews founded BlackSky Global LLC to build the infrastructure to observe the planet in real time with a constellation of 1 meter resolution satellites to provide near real time observations (giving revisit rates measured in hours or minutes versus days) to complement existing high resolution spacecraft. The network of satellites could be used to direct high performing space assets to monitor conflict and critical infrastructure. On June 30th 2013 the company completed a $7.5 million Series A investment to build and launch two Pathfinder demonstration spacecraft. BlackSky operated in \\"stealth mode\\" for two years, and was formally unveiled in June 2015 at the GeoInt Conference based on a Pathfinder launch planned for later that year. Two weeks after the GeoInt Conference a SpaceX Falcon 9 exploded in flight, significantly delaying the launch of the Pathfinder spacecraft.  Spaceflight Networks  In August 2014 Andrews unveiled plans for Spaceflight Networks at the SmallSat Conference in Logan, UT. The company was already planning a series of commercial ground stations to support the then unannounced BlackSky constellation. The business plan was to sell excess capacity on the BlackSky communication network and establish a set of communication standards and radios to further accelerate the growth of the satellite ecosystem. This business was eventually put on hold so that available resources could be focused on operating the existing businesses and building the BlackSky constellation.  Spaceflight Industries, Inc.  In 2015 Andrews integrated all three corporate entities under Spaceflight Industries, the parent corporate entity, with the ability to build, launch and operate spacecraft. Andrews led the firm as its President, CEO and Chairman, overseeing operations at the operating companies. Coincident with this event, Spaceflight Industries closed a $21.5 million Series B investment lead by venture capital firms Vulcan and RRE. BlackSky's business plan centered around revolutionizing the price point, frequency and user experience of satellite based imagery by developing a compelling user experience to achieve its commercial potential. In June 2016 Andrews lead the acquisition of OpenWhere Inc. of Herndon VA, which had a unique cloud-based geospatial intelligence platform. Coincident with this acquisition Spaceflight Industries closed a $25 million Series B-1 investment lead by Mithril Capital. In September 2016 following lengthy delays, BlackSky launched the Pathfinder-1 spacecraft on an Indian PSLV. The spacecraft met its demonstration objectives and validated the spacecraft economics (size and price) to enable the overall BlackSky business plan. In March 2018 Spaceflight Industries closed a $150 million Series C investment lead by Thales Alenia Space (TAS) and Mitsui to fund the construction and launch of twenty (20) BlackSky spacecraft. As part of this investment, Spaceflight Industries and TAS created a 50/50 joint venture, LeoStella, to produce the spacecraft for the BlackSky constellation based on the design developed by Spaceflight Industries. In October 2018 Spaceflight Industries was listed as one of the most valuable startups in the Seattle area with a valuation of $750 million.

Born in Prussia, Kusel immigrated to the United States during the California Gold Rush. He eventually arrived in California, in 1852, making him one of the first Jewish settlers in the state. During his time as a merchant, he imported one of the first sewing machines into California. In 1859, he founded his photography studio, where he developed scientifically-based photography methods to improve early portrait photography. Kusel is considered a pioneer of the town of Oroville, California, where he served as a school board trustee for thirty years, built the first schoolhouse in the town, and donated a founding collection of books to the Oroville Public Library. Early life and arrival in America Edward Abraham Kusel was born in 1824 in Mecklenburg- Vorpommern in Prussia. His father, Abraham, was a veteran of the Napoleonic Wars. Around 1850, Kusel heard about the California Gold Rush. He left for America to find his fortune, running out of money upon arrival in New York. For the duration of 1850-51, Kusel worked out east, saving money to move to California. Interested in the sciences since he was a child, he followed early developments in electrical engineering and photography. At the end of 1851, Kusel started his journey west. He spent time in Chicago and St. Louis and then walked to Salt Lake City, where he purchased a burro that he rode to California, arriving in Placerville in 1852. He visited Sacramento and San Francisco. It was during these visits that Kusel found a demand for firefighting equipment due to frequent fires in both cities. He relocated to Marysville, where he started a fire hose company. During that time, he imported one of the first sewing machines into California to create canvas fire hoses. Career in photography Kusel's downtown Oroville store in 1906 Kusel moved to the settlement of Oroville in 1856, just two years after a post office was opened in the community. In Oroville, Kusel opened a shop, selling books, stationary and office supplies. He met and married Bertha Heilbronner, whom he married around 1856, and in 1858 the couple had their first child, Carolus (Carl). Kusel created a photography studio behind his Oroville boutique, where he offered portrait photography. In 1859, he opened a photography studio in Marysville. He offered both photographs and ambrotypes on leather and paper. On November 5, 1860, Kusel became a United States citizen in Butte County. From 1860 until 1869, Kusel owned a 150-acre ranch outside of Chico. He opened his third studio in Sacramento in 1861, offering sun printing. It was at this gallery where he created a strict regime around specific colors of clothing to wear in order to achieve the best portraits. Additionally, Kusel became a regular contributor to Humphrey's Journal starting in 1863. He published works about photographic negative pinholes, solution development, fogging, collodion film, and other photography subjects. He also published a major piece in the Philadelphia Photographer in April 1869 documenting enameling, including troubleshooting. In the piece, Kusel used photographs of his son, Eli, who was regularly used as a model in Kusel's experiments. Kusel continued to maintain his Oroville gallery, where he returned to around 1865. He also opened another gallery in Chico in 1869, which also offered a general store. In 1878, Kusel's oldest son, Carl, joined Kusel in the photography business and the company was named E. A. Kusel and Son. The Chico store operated until 1884. In the 1890s, a flood destroyed many of the negatives from Kusel's work, which were kept in the basement of his general store in Oroville. Eli Kusel operated his medical practice above the store until 1941. Life in Oroville Kusel served on the Oroville school board for thirty-five years. He donated the funds and equipment to build the first schoolhouse in the town. In 1903, Kusel donated 60 books to the Oroville Public Library. He was a member of the Union League, where he supported abolitionist causes, and was an Oddfellow. He was an active member of the Union for Reform Judaism, donating money to promote education and agriculture. He was also a regular contributor to The American Israelite. Kusel was an avid telegraphist and installed the first telephones in Oroville. Kusel died in 1907, after becoming sick with pneumonia after a flood in Oroville. He is buried in the Oroville Jewish Cemetery. Legacy Kusel Road, located in Oroville, is named after Kusel and his family. A collection of Kusel's work is held in the collection of the California Historical Society.

It is also named a winkelhaken; however the distinct \\"U\\" character in cuneiform--(for the winkelhaken), has multiple uses (see u (cuneiform)), and winkelhakens are composed of the single \\"u\\", or a doubled version, one \\"u\\" above a second \\"u\\". The glossenkeil (Amarna letters)-100x24px is a fore shortened version of the vertical di≈° (cuneiform)-100x24px, and is inscribed at a 45 degree angle. Because the scribe's stylus is being used at an angle, (almost any corner of a stylus end could be used); if a scribe had two styli, of differing sizes, and both ends shaped for inscribing, that automatically implies at least four types of stylus tip impressions that could be made (from the two, double-ended styli). As an example of the stroke of a stylus, the Jerusalem scribe, in EA 287, has created a 4-stroke ri (cuneiform) sign from the 5-stroke, \\"ri\\" sign, by sweeping the left horizontal stroke, as the beginning of 2 strokes, and finishing the sweep of the stylus at the small angled intermediate stroke; (the Jerusalem scribe's stroke could easily be started in reverse order).

The flag is identical to the flag of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.  History   First version  The first constitution of the Kabardino-Balkarian ASSR was adopted by the Extraordinary 10th Congress of Soviets of the Kabardino-Balkarian ASSR on June 24, 1937, and was approved on June 2, 1940, by the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR. Article 112 of the constitution described the flag of the Kabardino-Balkarian ASSR:  Revision  On July 26, 1938, the inscriptions on the flag underwent minor changes. The Balkar language writing system was changed into Cyrilic letters, and the name of the republic was changed in Kabardin language.  Second version (as the Kabardin ASSR)  In 1944, the Balkar people were accused of aiding the Nazis, and almost all of the entire population was deported. The word \\"Balkar\\" was removed from the name of the republic. The flag of the Kabardin ASSR was a red cloth with gold inscriptions \\"RSFSR\\" and \\"Kabardian ASSR\\" (in Russian and Kabardin languages). The flag was described in Article 112 of the 1945 Constitution of the Kabardin ASSR.  Third version (as the Kabardin ASSR)  After the introduction of the new version of the RSFSR flag, the flag of the Kabardin ASSR was changed. On June 15, 1954, the Law on the State Flag of the Kabardin ASSR changed the description of the flag in Article 112 of the Constitution of the Republic.  Fourth version (as the Kabardino-Balkarian ASSR)  By a decree of January 9, 1957, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR restored the Kabardino-Balkarian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. The law of the Kabardino-Balkarian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic of March 29, 1957 established that the abbreviation on the flag of the republic should be performed in three languages. By the Decree of the PVS of the Kabardino-Balkarian ASSR on September 30, 1966, the Regulation on the Flag of the Kabardino-Balkar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic in 1956 was amended. On November 16, 1971, the Council of Ministers of the Kabardino-Balkarian ASSR, approved the Application of the Regulations on the State Flag of the Kabardino-Balkarian ASSR by Resolution No. 489.  Revision  According to the new Constitution of the Kabardino-Balkarian ASSR, which was adopted on May 26, 1978, the names of the Kabardino-Balkarian ASSR on flag became the full name of the state (rather than abbreviation). This was confirmed by article 158 of the Constitution of the Kabardino- Balkarian ASSR. By the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Kabardino-Balkarian ASSR on October 25, 1978, the design of the flag was approved. On September 26, 1979, the PVS of the Kabardino-Balkarian ASSR approved the Regulations on the State Flag of the Kabardino-Balkarian ASSR. The description of the flag in this position was supplemented with a paragraph on the relative sizes of the elements: On November 10, 1981, the Council of Ministers adopted a new edition of the Application of the Regulations on the State Flag of the Kabardino-Balkarian ASSR Gallery  References   Citations   Bibliography  * Kabardino-Balkarian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic ","title":"Flag of the Kabardino-Balkarian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic"},{"id":"58894442","text":"Thanet Wanderers RUFC was founded in 1886, and are based in Broadstairs.

It was designed by Robert Woodward and built from 1986 to 1988 by Melocco Pty Ltd. It is also known as Water Feature at Cockle Bay, Darling Harbour; Spiral Fountain and Darling Harbour. The property is owned by Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 27 June 2014.  History  Darling Harbour Water Feature was officially opened in 1988 it was designed by Robert Woodward , an architect and fountain designer. Robert Raymond Woodward (1923-2010) was born in Wentworthville in Sydney's western suburbs, the son of a public service accountant. Bob attended Granville Central Technical School, then Sydney Technical High School with a view to becoming a manual arts teacher. His career path was interrupted by the advent of World War II when Woodward joined the army. He was initially stationed with the Lachlan Macquarie 54th Regiment in Bathurst, then at Victoria Barracks where he completed an armoury course at East Sydney Technical College. Woodward later explained that being in the army at a young age had taught him to be responsible for the work he was doing and how to give instructions effectively.de Berg, 1972. It also opened up the opportunity to study architecture at the University of Sydney after the war as part of the huge post-war repatriation intake of ex-servicemen. Woodward commenced his architectural degree in 1947 and was impressed by teachers such as Leslie Wilkinson, George Molnar and Lloyd Rees. As a student he worked for Harry \\"Pergola\\" Divola and Peddle Thorp & Walker, while in 1950 he represented Australia in the 440 yard hurdles at New Zealand's British Empire Games. After graduation in 1952 he joined the Royal Australian Institute of Architects and worked briefly for Peddle Thorp & Walker, detailing industrial buildings, but soon headed off for England. He toured Europe with friends from Sydney before settling in Finland where he was privileged to work for a year with Alvar Aalto. He also spent another year in Finland working for the firm of Viljo Revell. Woodward considered that architectural education in Finland was impressive in the way that it demanded that its students actually build structures. He considered that \\"architects need to understand materials\\" and was impressed by 'Aalto's multi-disciplinary approach where landscape is involved in the building, and interior design, lighting, furnishings, fabrics... I think Aalto's main contribution, and this is to put it very simplistically ... was that he was able to get the best of Bauhaus as well as organic work... Aalto's principles, as stated by him, are that essentially everything in architecture is related to biology. If you take a leaf from a tree, for example, you can see... design principles which should apply to architecture itself. The first item is cellular structure which Aalto saw as the cells being spatial - not physical elements put together but spaces, and a leaf is made up of a whole multitude of similar cells. They mightn't be the same but they are similar and from one family. The way they are structured together is a flexible combination of those elements - cellular structure, flexible combination and the repetition...'Johnson, 1996, pp189-190 Woodward returned to Sydney in 1954 where he had some job offers from big firms, but instead formed a small partnership with Phil Taranto in Bankstown, they were later joined by Scott Wallace. They worked on small scale sites like a fruit shop in Bankstown, where they rationalized the work spaces, designed light fittings and introduced mirrored walls to increase the impression of light and plenty - innovations which were widely \\"copied and mass produced\\".Johnson, 1996, p193 In 1959, Woodward submitted a design to a City of Sydney competition to construct a fountain in Kings Cross, mainly as a professional \\"design exercise\\" for himself.Johnson, 1996, p194 He won the competition in the name of his firm Woodward & Taranto and went on to build the El Alamein Fountain. This was an immediate success and led to the gradual reorientation of his career into national and international prominence as a fountain designer. In 1968 the Woodward Taranto Wallace partnership was dissolved and Woodward continued alone as a sole practitioner with a focus on fountain design, joining the Australian Institute of Landscape Architects in 1989. He is responsible for many of the most prominent and admired fountains in Australia. In his oral history interview with Hazel de Berg in 1972, Woodward stated:De Berg, 1972, p7111 Woodward suggested that he didn't restrict himself to fountain design, as he explained to De Berg:De Berg, p7112, 7122-3 The Darling Harbour Water Feature outside the Sydney Exhibition Centre completed in 1988 was one of Woodward's most important works. It was a beautiful piece of design with its interplay of water, light and surface texture. It is both an irresistibly interactive water element and beautiful spiral sculptural form. Woodward was the recipient of many awards and honours in his lifetime, including the NSW Institute of Architect's Civic Design Award for the El Alamein Fountain in 1964, and in 1991 ACT Chapter RAIA Canberra Medallion, for New Parliament House, the 1991 NSW Chapter Civic Design Merit Award for Darling Harbour, the 1991 RAIA Walter Burley Griffin Award for Darling Harbour, the 1991 RAIA Civic Design Award for Darling Harbour, and the 1992 AILA National Awards in Landscape Architecture Civic Design Project Award.

It is bounded by the Sydney Convention Centre to the West, the Western Distributor to the south and Cockle Bay to the east. The fountain is a spiral water feature in an unassuming saucer-shaped depression in the bare harbour-side concourse; a shape cleanly cut, as if by an auger, into the pavement; ten spiraling paths for water and two for people; a mesmerizing flow of shallow rippling water. Hydraulic principles Water flows from the header at the top of each of the ten spirals as smooth, accelerating supercritical flow. When maximum velocity for the 1 in 16 gradient and roughness coefficient has been reached, the flow becomes constant and is therefore critical, a condition of least possible stability.Froude number = 1.0 In this unstable condition water is easily sculpted by minor external forces. The weir configuration and drag disturbance from the sides of the spiral create waves which travel downstream. The waves move across the spiral at an angle and reflect from the opposite side; crisscross interference patterns result. The wavelength is constant and sympathetic group wave action develops and continues down the spiral. This wave action is an original creation which probably does not occur in nature. The of crisscross wave action over 3000 identical weir stones is created by the energy from a total flow, the same as from a domestic swimming pool filter.  Condition  As at 22 July 2013, the fabric is in good condition. The Darling Harbour Water Feature is a highly intact example of a rare fountain form designed by Robert Woodward. Woodward created a water flow condition that is easily sculpted by minor external forces. The weir configuration and drag disturbance from the sides of the spiral create waves which travel downstream. The waves move across the spiral at an angle and reflect from the opposite side; crisscross interference patterns result. The wavelength is constant and sympathetic group wave action develops and continues down the spiral. This wave action is an original creation which probably does not occur in nature.

The fire killed ten children, including six children under the age of 12. Investigators stated that the fire started in the back of the building in a ground-floor apartment, which was vacant. The fire is the deadliest residential fire to have occurred in Chicago since 1958. In the aftermath of the fire, multiple violations were found in the apartment where the fire occurred with apartment owner, Merced Gutierrez, appearing in court for the 40 violations found at the site of the fire. Background On February 22, 2017, a fire broke out in the living room of a vacant first-floor apartment at the rear of the building. No one was injured. In March 2018, Illinois's Department of Children and Family Services were called investigated a hotline call that one of the sons of the mother who lived at the apartment came to school looking dirty and smelling of marijuana. Fire The fatal fire started at around 3 a.m. CST on August 26, 2018, at an apartment building at 2200 block of South Sacramento Avenue, about 45 minutes before a witness called 911 at 3:45 a.m. to report flames shooting through the windows of the second-floor rear unit. Children, ranging in age from 3 months to 16 years, were at a sleepover at the apartment. The investigation by the Chicago Fire Department indicated that the fire was the result of a smoldering item in the apartment that morning. Arson and foul play were ruled out. No adults were present in the apartment during the fire. An exact cause to the fire is still undetermined. Eight children died immediately in the fire while two were hospitalized under critical condition at the John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital of Cook County and died two later. Victims The 10 children who died in the fire were nine first cousins and a family friend: * Amayah Almaraz, 3 months old * Alanni Ayala, 3 * Gialanni Ayala, 5 * Ariel Garcia, 5 * Giovanni Ayala, 10 * Xavier Contreras, 11 * Nathan Contreras, 13 * Adrian Hernandez, 14 * Cesar Contreras, 14 * Victor Mendoza, 16 Investigation Fire officials initially said they did not find any smoke detectors in the second-floor rear unit, but they later said they did find a smoke detector without batteries. The department had investigated the mother who lived there, predominantly on allegations of inadequate supervision, 21 times since 2004. The complaints were verified in two instances, including one in 2013 when her then-8-year-old son, who had autism, got out of the home and was found wandering in traffic. Aftermath Many criticized Illinois' the Department of Children and Family Services as they were previously summoned to the department and disregarded the hazards. In a statement, the department said it tries to be as proactive as possible to prevent neglect when investigating struggling families. In months before the fire, there were 21 complaints against a mother of one of the victims, another complaint was verified in 2015. The mother was cited for endangerment when her 16-year-old daughter used a 7-month-old relative in a stroller to help them with a theft. A memorial service for six of the children was held on September 1 at noon at Our Lady of Tepeyac Church. The Chicago Fire Department handed out smoke detectors to the neighborhood while raising awareness of its importance. Mayor Rahm Emanuel in a statement regarding the fire said: \\"Our thoughts go out to not only the families of those who perished but to members of the department who pushed as hard as possible to reverse the deadly fate of the eight who are now gone\\". Violations Chicago Department of Buildings' Strategic Task Force found 38 violations in the front building, including missing or defective smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, defective light fixtures and armored cable and electrical wiring and plumbing installed without permits. Six more violations were found during a separate inspection of the rear coach house. The owner of the apartment, 80 year old Merced Gutierrez, was criticized and blamed for the fire for causing many violations at the apartment.

Ndume has lived most of his life at the Gorilla Foundation's sanctuary at Woodside, California, but has also lived at the Cincinnati Zoo and the Brookfield Zoo. Following a lawsuit, which raged on for months, Ndume was transferred back to the Cincinnati Zoo from the Gorilla Foundation on June 14, 2019. Early life Ndume was born at the Cincinnati Zoo in 1981 to his father, Ramses and mother, Rosie. Ramses currently lives at the Fort Worth Zoo and Rosie lived to be 43. Ndume also has an aunt Samantha who lived to be 50 and an aunt Gigi who lived to be 47. As a young gorilla, Ndume was playful and highly social. Ndume grew up with three or four gorilla peers. At the age of 3, Ndume began to be cared for by Ron Evans, who was 17 at the time, and is currently the Curator of Primates at the Cincinnati Zoo. Ndume was transferred to the Brookfield Zoo when he was seven. There he fathered three children, including Baraka, Mtu Chuma and Zuza. At the age of 10, Ndume was transferred to the Gorilla Foundation to live with Michael and to serve as a potential mate to Koko. Later life Gorilla Foundation At the Gorilla Foundation, Koko and Ndume failed to mate. Penny Patterson who serves as the President and Research Director at The Gorilla Foundation has said that there needs to be \\"...several females and one male...\\" in order for a gorilla family to form. While having multiple females is optimal, there were other factors in play. When he arrived at The Gorilla Foundation, he interacted with a much larger and dominant female. This along with the fact that Koko had not ovulated for at least 19 years prior to her death, most likely played a significant part. After more than 27 years at the Gorilla Foundation, Ndume was transferred back to the Cincinnati Zoo following a months-long court battle. The Gorilla Foundation said, \\"We are deeply saddened that our beloved Ndume is leaving and wish the very best for his happiness, good health and peace of mind.\\" Cincinnati Zoo Ndume arrived at the Cincinnati Zoo in the morning of June 14 after being flown in from the Gorilla Foundation. The move went \\"perfectly smooth\\" and he \\"slept most of the way,\\" according to the Cincinnati Zoo's Curator of Primates, Ron Evans. Ndume was not tranquilized when being moved, but was given food and water along the way. Upon arrival, Ndume was given his own bedroom suite or \\"play land\\" that was in close proximity to the zoo‚Äôs two gorilla troops. The zoo created a third family group with Ndume. The zoo introduced Ndume to other gorillas at his pace and he determined which female gorillas were the best fit for him. Once Ndume was acclimated to the zoo environment, he was put on exhibit and introduced to zoo guests. He has been introduced to a troop with two female gorillas, Chewie and Maria. Center of lawsuit After Koko died, the Cincinnati Zoo along with the AZA contacted the Gorilla Foundation and requested that Ndume be transferred back to the Cincinnati Zoo. However, the Gorilla Foundation and Penny Patterson said \\"...There is a significant probability that proceeding down the path proposed by the American Zoo Association may kill Ndume ‚Äî either during transfer, or within weeks or months thereafter.\\" In response, the Cincinnati Zoo stated that since 2007 there have been 150 gorilla transfers that have resulted in no problems or transfer- related deaths. The Cincinnati Zoo has also said that gorillas as old as 45 have been successfully transferred and have lived to be over 50 years old. The Cincinnati Zoo also accused the Gorilla Foundation of risking Ndume's mental health by refusing to give him up because he has had no contact with other gorillas since Koko's passing. Ron Evans, the Curator of Primates at the Cincinnati Zoo, said, \\"Having gorillas around other gorillas is a foundation need for gorillas.\\" The foundation defended keeping Ndume in isolation, claiming, \\"He is with a strong family support group of human great apes, from whom he takes great comfort.\\" The Gorilla Foundation also stated that \\"[when Ndume] overheard a discussion about his possible transfer to the zoo,‚Äù he reacted by \\"crying, screaming, banging and shoving objects for 14 hours.\\" On October 25, 2018, the Cincinnati Zoo filed a federal lawsuit against the Gorilla Foundation on the grounds that they failed to comply with the loan agreement that was mutually agreed-upon and updated in 2015. The agreement stated, \\"Upon the death of Koko, Ndume will be placed at an AZA institution recommended by the Gorilla Species Survival Plan and the Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden.\\" During the case, PETA filed an amicus brief in support of the Cincinnati Zoo's lawsuit. On February 1, 2019, Judge Richard Seeborg announced that Ndume will be transferred back to the Cincinnati Zoo. Seeborg wrote, \\"There is no legal basis to negate that agreement now. Given that both sides represent that the well-being of Ndume is their paramount interest, however, they are expected to cooperate now to ensure the conditions under which he is transported to the Zoo and begins living there are as optimal as can reasonably be achieved.\\" It was announced that Ndume would be sent back to the Cincinnati Zoo from the Gorilla Foundation on May 13. Before being transferred, Ndume began to go through crate training. Ndume was scheduled to be transferred to the Cincinnati Zoo on May 13 and later June 4, but both transfer dates were delayed. On June 4, the Cincinnati Zoo filed a joint status update asking Judge Richard Seeborg to set Ndume's transfer date for June 12. The Gorilla Foundation notified the Cincinnati Zoo that they would not allow Ndume's transfer on June 4 because of a doctor finding Balantidium coli (B. coli) in Ndume's fecal matter. An attorney for the Gorilla Foundation suggested that Ndume was suffering from \\"...extreme stress [after] hearing the transfer crate being closed...\\" and transferring Ndume \\"could prove fatal.\\" However, the Cincinnati Zoo disagreed with the Gorilla Foundation stating they \\"are not concerned that the presence of this trace amount of the non-active form of the protozoal organism poses a health risk to Ndume or should prevent his transfer.\\" Ndume was successfully transferred back to the Cincinnati Zoo on June 14 after being flown into Cincinnati. Following Ndume's arrival back to the zoo, PETA said in a statement \\"After years of pressure from PETA, Ndume is now back where he was born, in a place where he‚Äôs supported by expert care and has a chance to socialize with other gorillas.\\" The Cincinnati Zoo introduced Ndume to female gorillas and they formed a troop.

Ames (born 12 December 1947) is a Canadian-born philosopher, translator, and author. He is Humanities Chair Professor at Peking University in Beijing, China, Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at the University of Hawai ªi at MƒÅnoa, and a Berggruen Fellow. He has made significant contributions to the study of Chinese and comparative philosophy, in which he emphasizes the importance of understanding Chinese philosophy on its own terms rather than through the lens of Western philosophy.  Biography  Roger Ames was born in Toronto, Canada, and raised in England and Vancouver. He is married with two sons. He received his bachelor ªs degree from the University of British Columbia (UBC) where he studied philosophy and Chinese language. While attending UBC, he took the opportunity to spend one academic year at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, his first exposure to China. After graduating from UBC, he began his graduate work at National Taiwan University (1970‚Äì1972), where he studied with Yang Youwei (Ê•äÊúâÁ∂≠). He returned to UBC to finish his master's degree (1973), then he spent two years living in Japan.

Before she made a career of singing, she worked as a secretary.  Career  Arnell caught the attention of Tucker when he heard her sing while he and his band were in Portsmouth. She auditioned for him and was hired. Later, her recording of \\"I Don't Want to Set the World on Fire\\" with the Tucker orchestra \\"became a smash hit\\", selling half a million records for Columbia. The recording's success boosted the band from cheaper one-night stands \\"into the higher brackets.\\" Arnell also appeared with Tucker and his orchestra in the short film It's Tommy Tucker Time (1943), which was part of the RKO Pictures Jamboree Series. The short was reissued in 1947. Arnell debuted on radio in Detroit on Phil Baker's program, and in 1937-1938 she sang with Tucker's orchestra on George Jessel's Thirty Minutes in Hollywood program. In 1939-1940, she appeared with Tucker and his orchestra on Pot o' Gold. In December 1945, she joined the cast of The Abbott and Costello Show, replacing vocalist Connie Haines. On December 7, 1943, Arnell left Tucker to do a solo act, performing at theaters.

The museum is located in Columbus, Ohio, along the Scioto River between Franklinton and Downtown Columbus. The museum's main focus is on the personal stories of U.S. veterans, in contrast to other war museums that are dedicated to the conflicts themselves. It opened on October 27, 2018, as a reimagining of the Franklin County Veterans Memorial, a museum dedicated to veterans from the surrounding county, established in 1955. History The former Franklin County Veterans Memorial in 2005. The current museum occupies the same location. The site along the west side of the Scioto River near the Discovery Bridge on Broad Street was originally home to the Franklin County Veterans Memorial, which originally opened in 1955 and was demolished to make way for the museum in early 2015, by S.G. Loewendick & Sons. The construction of a veterans museum was envisioned by city boosters and received support from former Senator and World War II veteran John Glenn. It was designated as the National Veterans Memorial and Museum by the United States Congress in June 2018. The museum was the 20th museum to receive national museum status from Congress. It was dedicated on October 27, 2018, with a speech by former general Colin Powell. Architecture The museum, grounds, and parking The building was designed by Allied Works Architecture, and OLIN designed the landscape. The interior was designed by Ralph Appelbaum Associates. Turner Construction Company was the general contractor. The Associated General Contractors of America named it the most significant construction project of 2018 and the best new building $10 to $75 million. The building and its park space cost $75 million, while an additional $7 million was raised for the museum's startup and operation.https://www.columbusmonthly.com/news/20181204/first-look-veterans- memorials-new-focus The building is rounded, 300 feet in diameter, with a minimalist interior. Full-length windows on the mezzanine are vertically striped to resemble military ribbons. Visitors can walk atop the museum's grassy roof for views of the Columbus skyline and a place to reflect. The museum includes a 2.5 acre outdoor memorial grove that includes a reflecting pool and memorial stone wall. The stated purpose of the architecture is to promote remembrance. Exhibits and collections The museum focuses on the stories of veterans and individuals rather than military accomplishments, with the mission to \\"honor, inspire, connect, and educate\\". It has two permanent exhibits and one temporary exhibit space, covering 30,000 square feet. The museum houses personal artifacts such as footlockers, military ribbons, and letters service men and women sent home. Exhibits include stories from veterans dating from American Revolutionary War onwards to recent conflicts. It intends to educate civilians about the diverse backgrounds veterans have and the roles they served in the military. Memorial Grove Memorial Grove is a park outside the museum. The park opened alongside the museum in October 2018. It features a path circling a 325-foot wall of stacked rocks and waterfalls; the wall reads \\"E pluribus unum\\". The central shaded area, planted with American elms, is meant for personal reflection and contemplation.https://www.cleveland.com/news/erry-2018/10/9ec10075345915/national- veterans-memorial-and.htmlhttps://www.ohiomagazine.com/travel/article/inside- the-national-veterans-memorial-and-museum References External links * Category:2018 establishments in Ohio Category:Culture of Columbus, Ohio Category:Buildings in downtown Columbus, Ohio Category:Franklinton, Columbus, Ohio Category:Museums in Columbus, Ohio Category:Military and war museums in Ohio Category:National museums of the United States Category:Parks in Columbus, Ohio ","title":"National Veterans Memorial and Museum"},{"id":"58895190","text":"Libero Corso Bovio (5 May 1948 ‚Äì 9 July 2007) was an Italian lawyer, journalist and professor. He was the descendant of a family of Neapolitan lawyers and jurists, and he was also a lecturer in law and a journalist. He is also known for being the nephew of Italian poet and musician Libero Bovio and the great-grandson of the famous Italian philosopher Giovanni Bovio.  Biography  Libero Corso Bovio was born in Milan on 5 May 1948. His father was Giovanni Bovio, one of the leading Milanese lawyers, who died in the 1970s. His grandfather was the poet and musician Libero Bovio (1883‚Äì1942), while his great-grandfather was the famous philosopher Giovanni Bovio (1837‚Äì1903). Among his ancestors is also Francesco Maria Bovio (about 1750‚Äì1830), a lawyer and professor of literature and law at the University of Altamura who actively participated in the revolutionary movements of the Parthenopean Republic (1799) and the Altamuran Revolution (1799). Libero Corso Bovio graduated in law in 1971 at the age of 24 with 110/110 cum laude from the University of Milan. He also became a journalist in 1970. Over time, he became a well-known and talented lawyer, and worked in a well-known office specialized in press laws and criminal law. He was also married to lawyer Rita Percile.  Death  On 9 July 2007, Corso Bovio returned from a business trip to Prato at around 2 pm. He had handed a letter to his assistant, which had to be delivered to his wife and had locked in his office, located in Via Podgora, 13, Milan. Shortly thereafter, his assistant heard a shot, and the lawyer was found dead inside his room. From the beginning, detectives considered more likely that a suicide occurred, by blowing in the mouth with a 357 Magnum. Some relatives, acquaintances and colleagues were incredulous in front of the fact, and they couldn't fund any reason why Bovio had committed suicide. In the days following his death, some websites somewhat questioned the suicide, which was described as \\"obscure\\".  Career as lawyer and lecturer  Bovio worked as a lawyer for some of the major Italian publishing companies, including RCS MediaGroup, Il Sole 24 Ore and Societ√† San Paolo. He had also worked as a lawyer for the well-known financier Stefano Ricucci. Some of his clients were prominent Italian politicians and businessmen. He published some works for Ordine Nazionale dei Giornalisti. He also held courses at the IFG of the Ordine dei Giornalisti di Milano and at the school of journalism of the University of Urbino. He also worked for the Bocconi University for criminal procedure seminars. As a journalist, moreover, he collaborated actively with many Italian newspapers, including Corriere della Sera and Italian magazines such as Famiglia Cristiana and Oggi.

It is found in Gansu, Guizhou, Hubei, Qinghai, Shaanxi and Sichuan provinces. It is a shrub or tree tall, preferring to grow at above sea level. A genetic and morphological study has shown that it is conspecific with Prunus persica, the cultivated peach. P.kansuensis is being investigated as a source for rootstocks and for crop improvement due to its resistance to multiple diseases, to drought, and to frost. It is unaffected by peach mosaic virus, resistant to the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita, and tolerates winter temperatures down to . P. persica (center), and P. davidiana (right) Description Prunus kansuensis can be difficult to distinguish from its close relatives P.mira (Tibetan peach), P.davidiana (Chinese wild peach), and P.persica (domestic peach), especially if only vegetative characters are used. Many specimens of P.kansuensis are shrubs, whereas most specimens of the other species are trees. P.kansuensis and P.mira have smooth endocarps (covering of the seed) but P.davidiana and P.persica endocarps have the typically pitted appearance seen in domestic peaches. P.kansuensis can be distinguished from P.mira by having externally pubescent (or rarely subglabrous) sepals; P.mira sepals are externally glabrous. P.davidiana mesocarps (the flesh of the fruits) dry out, the other species' fruits remain moist. P.davidiana has a number of other distinguishing characters, and is also genetically divergent from the other peaches. P.kansuensis winter buds are ovoid to long ovoid and glabrous, P.persica winter buds are conical and pubescent. P.kansuensis petioles are about long, P.persica petioles are about long. There are subtle but inconsistent differences in the leaves, with P.kansuensis leaves typically a bit shorter and with fewer serrations per unit length than P.persica. There are also subtle difference in floral characters, the most obvious being that the styles in P.kansuensis flowers are longer than the stamens, with P.persica styles shorter (or at most equal to) their stamens. Uses In China it is used as a rootstock for cultivated peaches and almonds, and sometimes grown as an ornamental for its profuse shell-pink flowers which blossom in early spring. When cultivated and tended, it often takes the tree form. P.kansuensis is a ruderal species and is used in the process of returning farmland to forest, since it can provide some income to farmers during the transition. Its white- fleshed fruit is small, relatively flavorless, and is not generally considered salable, although some people cultivate and eat them locally. The fruit is eaten by the endangered golden snubnosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus roxellana).

Her parents have raised criticism about the conduct of local law enforcement and Coldon's disappearance is similar to the disappearance of Stacey English in December 2011 in Atlanta, Georgia.  Biography  Phoenix Coldon is the daughter of Goldia and Lawrence Coldon. Coldon was born in California as Phoenix Reeves and raised there until the family moved for her father's job to Missouri. She was adopted by Lawrence Coldon thus changing her name to Phoenix Coldon. During the Oxygen special, it was discovered that there were only four persons named Phoenix Reeves in the U.S and one didn't exist until 2012. Upon further investigation in to Phoenix Reeves it was stated that the Phoenix Reeves since 2012 had no social security number or any trail other than an address in Anchorage, Alaska. When arriving in Alaska, the filming staff spoke to the homeowner who stated that she had never met a Phoenix Reeves, and had never rented her home to anyone. She was mostly home-schooled and played a variety of musical instruments and was the local junior fencing champion.  Disappearance  Coldon disappeared on December 18, 2011, after leaving her family home in a black 1998 Chevy Blazer at about 15:00 local time. Her father told reporters that she was supposedly headed to a convenience store around the street or possibly a friend's house. Hours after she disappeared, her vehicle was discovered at 17:27 and impounded at 18:23, abandoned but still running, 25 minutes from her home, on St. Clair Avenue of East St. Louis. The vehicle was entered into the police database as abandoned; allegedly the license plates of the car were not investigated, and the vehicle was not searched. The family was reportedly not notified of the car being discovered until a family friend searching independently discovered it in a tow lot. Upon an independent search by her family afterwards, the vehicle was discovered to still contain her glasses, purse, shoes and ID. After her disappearance, all activity on her bank accounts, cell phone and social media accounts stopped. DNA evidence gathered from her SUV indicated that there were no other individuals in the vehicle other than Coldon and her parents.  Search efforts  Her parents have independently searched for Coldon after raising allegations of a lack of effort from local police. Through the years, they have talked to local drug dealers and prostitutes for information and hired a private investigator. Privately funding the search caused the family home to go into foreclosure and for the family's life savings to be drained. A two-night special television documentary on her disappearance debuted on Oxygen on November 3 and 4, 2018, in which investigative reporter Shawndrea Thomas and retired deputy Police Chief Joe Delia discussed theories on her disappearance. In 2016, her case was profiled on the podcast The Vanished.

She was a founder member of Matrix Feminist Design Co-operative and co-author of their 1984 book Making Space: Women and the Man-Made Environment (Pluto Press 1984). Since 2008 she has been co-director of The DisOrdinary Architecture Project with disabled artist Zoe Partington, a disability-led platform that works with disabled artists to explore new ways to think about disability in architectural and design discourse and practice. Her books Doing Disability Differently: an Alternative Handbook on Architecture, Dis/ability and Designing for Everyday Life (Routledge 2014) and Disability, Space, Architecture: A Reader (Routledge 2017) have become key texts in this field, with the latter called a \\"brilliant gathering of texts, both synthetic and surprising [that] should be taught in every architecture and design program, and may well become the new standard text for interdisciplinary disability studies courses generally\\" (Susan Schweik, Professor of English and Disability Studies, UC Berkeley). She has given numerous international keynote talks, including at the Design Museum London (2019), Melbourne University School of Design (2019), University of Innsbruck (2019), Yale University School of Architecture (2018), Victoria and Albert Museum (2018), Aarhus University Copenhagen (2017), Architectural Association London (2016), University of the Arts, London (2016) and the Taylor Institute, University of Calgary (2016). Jos has been a Visiting Professor at Ulster and London Metropolitan Universities, she is a Design Council Built Environment Expert (BEE) and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts.  Career  Jos Boys works at The Bartlett Faculty of Built Environment, University College London and is Course Director of the MSc in Learning Environments. Before that, she worked for over 10 years as an independent Learning Environment consultant and researcher; and has written extensively about the complex and often contested inter- relationships between pedagogies, academic development, institutional policy and strategies, facilities planning and management, and building design. She has also worked as an educator in architecture and related disciplines across many institutions both in the UK and internationally, and as an academic developer and instructional designer. Underpinning this, as well as all her community-based design activism, is a particular interest in how to improve our understanding of everyday social, material and spatial practices, in support of the most disadvantaged in society. All her work explores how we can act across different perspectives and agendas to collaboratively discuss and improve built environments. Jos Boys obtained her BSc at the Bartlett School UCL (then called the School of Environmental Studies) and has master's degrees in Advanced Architectural Studies (UCL 1981) and Photography (De Montfort University 2003). She obtained her PhD from the Faculty of Urban and Regional Studies, University of Reading entitled‚Äú Concrete Visions? Examining inter- relationships between housing design, material practices and everyday life in England 1830 ‚Äì 1980‚Äù in 2001. Originally training as an architectural journalist for Building Design magazine, she also undertook projects at the Greater London Council (GLC) writing guidance on Women and Planning; and at Women's Design Service where she was a development worker, with co-founders Vron Ware, Sue Cavanagh and Wendy Davis. Throughout her life Jos Boys has been involved with many feminist and related networks, including Cutting Edge, a cross-disciplinary feminist research group exploring new design technologies, based at the University of Westminster (1995 - 2001), and the feminist spatial practices group Taking Place (2000 - ).

Bibliography  Jos Boys' research, writing and teaching is concerned with understanding the social construction of 'normal' architectural and design education and practices; and about co-developing alternative forms of producing built spaces that instead start from difference, from the perceptions and experiences of marginalised groups, whether in education or other spaces. There remains a lack of theoretical understanding as to how built space works, or its complex relationships to diverse occupation, whether for living, working or learning. Boys' co-edited collections all aim to open up multiple perspectives and voices, so as to share approaches and attitudes; to critically reflect on different assumptions; and to work together to build better models for architecture as a discipline that based on social, spatial and material justice.

Haus Ottilie von Hansemann In 1860, Ottilie (born von Kusserow) married Adolph von Hansemann (27 July 1826 ‚Äì 9 December 1903). Ottilie's husband was a notable Prussian industrialist and manager of the Disconto- Gesellschaft, a large financial holding founded in 1851 and headquartered in Berlin, which in 1929 merged with Deutsche Bank. Ottilie and her husband had two children, Ferdinand and Davide Eveline von Hansemann. At the turn of the twentieth century, German women's struggle for higher education focused on their being integrated into existing universities. In Germany, the women's movement focused on a range of social and design issues, including land reform, the urban gardening movement, centralized housekeeping, housing inspection, and residences for female workers and students. In 1907, Ottilie von Hansemann offered the rector of the Friedrich Wilhelm University (renamed Humboldt University in 1949) in Berlin 200,000 Reichsmarks as a scholarship endowment in exchange for his allowing women to be admitted to the university and to attend classes together with male students. In 1908, after the Prussian government opened universities to women, the rector of Friedrich Wilhelm University requested the promised financial gift from Ottilie, but she refused because the law admitting women to German universities contained a stipulation that for \\"special reasons\\" a professor could petition the education minister to bar women from his courses. When German Culture Minister Ludwig Holle was unwilling to revise this exceptional paragraph, Ottilie withdrew her endowment offer to the university and instead invested the money in the construction of the Viktoria-Studienhaus (a student residence for women) on the former Berliner Allee (since 1957 Otto-Suhr-Allee) in the Charlottenburg neighborhood of Berlin. Opened in 1915, the Viktoria-Studienhaus was also referred to as Haus Ottilie von Hansemann, in honor of its royal patron (Crown Princess Victoria) and its largest donor, respectively.

Early life Earle was the eldest son of Sir Thomas Earle, MP and mayor of Bristol, and his wife Elizabeth Ellinor Jackson, daughter of Joseph Jackson. He was the brother of Giles Earle. He married Elizabeth Cann, daughter of Sir Thomas Cann, merchant, of Bristol by licence dated. 18 November 1689. He succeeded his father in 1696. Career Earle had virtually talen over the mercantile business when his father died in 1696. He became a Member of the Society of Merchant Venturers of Bristol in 1697 and was Warden of the Society from 1709 to 1710. At the general election of 1710 he was elected as a Tory Member of Parliament for Bristol. In parliament he was much concerned with trade and occasionally voted with the Whigs. He was president of the Loyal Society, Bristol from 1712 to 1713. At the 1713 general election, he was re-elected MP for Bristol. In Parliament he displayed more ambivalence in his voting choices and was described as a Whig who often voted with the Tories. At the 1715 general election , he was elected as a Whig. He was master of the Society of Merchant Adventurers for the year 1721 to 1722; He was re-elected at the 1722 general election but began to fall out with parts of the Bristol voting community and was subjected to political attacks.

Illustration from 1937 program for Die Nacht der Amazonen. The Night of the Amazons (German title: Nacht der Amazonen) was the name of a Nazi propaganda event that was held annually in Munich in the park at Nymphenburg Palace in the 1930s.Peters, Dominik (31 May 2018). Die Amazonen-Partys der Nazis, Spiegel Online (in German)(17 February 2018).

Nackte Variet√©-Frauen, SS- Reiter, Feuerwerk: Hitlers bizarre Amazonenpartys, Focus (in German) The events were held on 27 July 1936, 31 July 1937, 30 July 1938 and 29 July 1939, and were the evening highlight of the International Horse Racing Week Munich- Riem. Members of the SS-Cavalry, variety show girls, and international stars performed at the open-air revue with up to 2,500 participants. In addition to highlighting Munich as a travel destination, the event was intended to present Germany's Nazi regime as cosmopolitan and friendly to foreigners, and promote Nazi ideology. Postcard promoting Munich as Hitler's \\"Capital of German Art\\" in the Olympia-Sommer 1936. In the foreground the amazon with longbow and victory wreath. The award of the horse races was The Brown Ribbon of Germany. Origin The International Racing Week at Munich-Riem was invented in 1934 to present world-class equestrian sports in Munich and attract visitors to show off the new Nazi society. The event was organized by Christian Weber, whose personal friendship with Adolf Hitler goes back to the early 1920s. All international horse clubs were invited. In 1936, the prize money for the Brown Ribbon of Germany was doubled. Being 100.000 Reichsmark, it was thus the continent's highest prize. That year was also a special anniversary, \\"500 Years of Horse Racing in Munich\\", which featured numerous major events. According to Weber, the evening highlight of the horse races for the Brown Ribbon should make a noise at home and in the world. Together with Paul Wolfrum, the head of tourism of Munich and Southern Bavaria, they created the \\"Night of the Amazons\\", an evening event with 10,000 spectators. Weber used the former summer residence of the Bavarian kings as scenery for his ambitious self-portrayal and that of the Nazi ruling system. Preliminary work and financing Despite weeks of personnel-intensive rehearsals and preparations, no alternative date was set. The enormously expensive financing was taken over by the Nazi regime organization The Brown Ribbon of Germany. For the first event in 1936, the two access avenues and the entire palace complex were provided with electric light for the first time. Concerns of the Bavarian Administration of State-Owned Palaces, Gardens and Lakes also had to be addressed, e.g., fire hazards due to large fireworks shows, and damage caused by horse hooves, crowds of people and underground installations. Security personnel were provided by the SS. Content The event always consisted of two different parts, which differed in content from year to year. Obvious Nazi propaganda was avoided. Besides international stars, hundreds of horses were put on stage. The first part of the event had a historical theme, which was located in the courtly 18th century environment, thereby branded as decadent. In the second part of the event, the \\"New Age\\" and \\"Master Race\\", glorified by the Nazi ideology, were presented. Under the pretext of ancient mythology more nudity was staged from year to year. A bronze sculpture created by Franz Stuck in 1913/14 was considered the Amazon par excellence. A replica was erected in front of the Villa Stuck in Munich in 1936. In 1936 Hans Gru√ü, the manager of the Deutsches Theater (Munich), directed the event. In 1937 he was replaced by Paul Wolz, who directed it until 1939. The dance performances incorporated choreographic inspiration from the latest UFA GmbH and Hollywood films. The German sculptor and painter Franz Stuck created 1914 the bronze casting of a nude amazon. This recast from 1936 was a gift to Adolf Hitler. Lighting technology Wilhelm Hindelang was responsible for the lighting production. During a stay in New York City in 1936, the electrical engineer had studied the various lighting systems on Broadway theaters and the night illumination of Niagara Falls. The illumination of the \\"Night of the Amazons\\" enabled him to express his creativity and expertise. He worked out the lighting plans and created lighting effects with Ultraviolet light chains, colored underwater spotlights and a dance floor illuminated from below. A large part of the lighting and the telephone system for the direction and lighting instructions were provided by the armed forces (Wehrmacht). In 1938, the passionate amateur filmmaker with his innovative use of light was able to shoot the event on Kodachrome. It was probably the first color film shot at night in the German Reich. Horsemanship Equestrian skills - including the High School of Classical dressage - were used by the ambitious SS riders to create a public impact. Many of the riders were members of the SS-Totenkopfverb√§nde who guarded the Dachau concentration camp during the day. Hermann Fegelein, award- winning jump jockey and ambitious prot√©g√© of Christian Weber and head of the SS Main Riding School Riem since 1937, trained them as well as the \\"Amazons\\". SS men from Dachau concentration camp were recruited to pose on a stage decoration. Dance The Munich State Opera ballet took part in the first Night of the Amazons in 1936. However, since classical ballet was said to have not enough Germanness and national pride and to be affected from foreign influence, a wide variety of dance schools with expressive dance were used from 1937 onwards. Following the Nazi ideology, the dancers symbolized the \\"voluntary and vibrant integration into the large community structure with the so-called New Dance\\". Young girls of the NS girls‚Äò organisation Faith and Beauty Society were used for mass scenes, too. Following the example of Broadway theatre shows 1939 a dancefloor was created in front of the castle for a scene with \\"flower girls\\". Celebrity participants Every year, internationally renowned stars participated in the event, such as Margaret Severn from New York and Eugene Iskoldoff with dancers from the Covent Garden Ballet Russe in 1936. In the following years, the Scala-Girls from Berlin and the Hiller-Girls performed as well as singers like Hans-Hermann Nissen and Erna Sack. Nudity Christian Weber made increasingly use of the insight he had gained during his 1937 visit to the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne - and the relevant establishments in Paris - that \\"our naked German girls are better looking than the French women.\\"Pope, Ernest R.: Munich Playground. New York 1941, pp. 35-36 His conclusion for the Night of the Amazons was: \\"All we have to do is take off the clothes of the girls right here at home, put them into the spotlight, and men with money to spend will forsake Paris for Munich.\\" From 1938 onward the number of girls dressed only in skin-colored panties increased. For the first time, 150 bronzed male and female participants were shown, who were covered with bronze- colored theatrical make-up from the crown to the sole, thus bearing considerable health risks. Detail of the illustrated program of the 1939 show.The artist Albert Reich (1881-1942) was art director of the shows and created the cover for the first edition of Hitler's Mein Kampf. Music The first part of the series began with fanfare blowers, followed by German military marches. After the break classical music alternated with singing. Hunting horn and alpine folk music were played as well. Spectators and Playing Field Tribunes and standing places were placed on the extended so- called inner ground floor of the Nymphenburg Park. The celebrities had their places of honour on the castle's perron. In 1936 almost all European kings were present. With 20.000 visitors, the Night of the Amazons was always sold out. To offer something to the curious spectators in front of the castle, the building was illuminated, open fire burned on pylons, gondolas drove down the castle canal. Safety Precautions Every year members of the Gestapo combed the extensive area of the Nymphenburg Palace with great care as the presence of Adolf Hitler was hoped for. Hitler, however, preferred the Bayreuth Festival with Richard Wagner‚Äôs music taking place the same time.

In the final hour of the 18 hours, the film was streamed on the Coachella YouTube page and Twitch. Donald Glover was co- headlining at the event as Childish Gambino. Plot An animated folk tale narrated by Kofi Novia introduces the origins of Guava Island and the music played by Deni Maroon, a local celebrity who lives with Kofi. She wakes up to Deni playing a tune on his guitar. He rushes out of their house and is greeted by many passersby on the street on his way to work; Deni is holding a music festival that the whole town is looking forward to. He is mugged by a group of kids he knows and he convinces them not to rob him by promising them seats up front at the festival. Kofi works in a factory as a seamstress with Yara while Deni works for Red Cargo, owned by a despotic business magnate named Red who employs most of the people on the island. While at work, an employee details what he would do if he were able to emigrate to America, which Deni dismisses as ignorant (\\"This Is America\\"). Deni is kidnapped and taken to Red's office. Red bribes Deni into canceling his festival so that it will not interrupt productivity the next day. When Deni questions his power, Red destroys his guitar. He returns to Kofi, who asks him about his injury and his guitar's absence. Deni brushes off her inquiry, instead serenading her with the song he had promised to write since they were children (\\"Summertime Magic\\"). Deni suddenly has to go. Later at work, Kofi tells Yara that she is reluctant to tell Deni that she is pregnant because of his free-spirited lifestyle. Inspired by two children, Zoila and Mapi (\\"Time\\"), Deni performs on the radio again and announces that he will be at the festival (\\"Feels Like Summer\\"). Kofi is ambushed by Red while both look for Deni; Red asks Kofi to tell him to break a leg. Deni starts the festival late and performs a song dedicated to Zoila and Mapi (\\"Saturday\\"). Kofi spots a masked gunman just before he opens fire on the stage. Deni escapes into an alleyway, but the gunman finds and assassinates him. Red is pleased, but then he discovers that all of his employees have left work to attend a joyous blue-themed memorial for Deni (\\"Die with You\\"); Kofi tells Red that they all finally \\"got their day\\". In an epilogue, Kofi starts telling her child a story about how dreams come true.

That same weekend, Glover performed at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. The 30-second advertisement features Glover singing, and ending with \\"I'll see you at the show, everyone\\". Clicking the advertisement leads to the Rap Caviar playlist curated by Spotify, which was \\"presented by Guava Island\\" for Spotify users. It was later revealed Amazon Studios would distribute the film, and Regency Enterprises had financed the film, with it being released on April 13. Reception , the film holds a 78% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 40 reviews with an average rating of 6.59 out of 10. The website's critics consensus reads: \\"Thematically ambitious if occasionally somewhat obtuse, Guava Island adds another intriguing chapter to a talented team's burgeoning filmography.\\" On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 64 out of 100, based on eight reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable\\" reviews. It received a nomination for the Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Movie Made for Television. Peter Debruge of Variety magazine writes \\"the film serves as a shorter, tighter Purple Rain, a self-mythologizing origin story from the artist formerly known as Childish Gambino, reintroduced here as Deni Maroon.\\" Debruge expresses disappointment that film features less music than expected and that Rihanna does not sing. He praises the film as it \\"Plugs squarely into the zeitgeist, answering conflict with a call for love.\\" Joelle Monique of The A.V. Club gave the film a C+, summing up her review, \\"Short, sweet, and to the point Guava Island proves a catchy little musical number\\". In Rolling Stone, Guava Island screenwriter Stephen Glover, Donald's brother, notes a relationship of the plot and themes to the life and recent death of American rapper Nipsey Hussle. He also discusses the \\"idea of capitalism in America and how it‚Äôs left people out over the years. But at the same time, it has the power to empower you if you can wield it. The idea of capitalism and the relation that black people especially have to capitalism is something that‚Äôs interesting to us.\\" See also *List of black films of the 2010s References External links * Category:2010s musical films Category:Amazon Studios films Category:American musical films Category:American films Category:Films about music festivals Category:Films directed by Hiro Murai Category:Films shot in Cuba Category:Regency Enterprises films ","title":"Guava Island"},{"id":"58895911","text":"In the New Forest a verderer is an unpaid officer whose duty is to regulate and protect the interests of the New Forest commoners, and to preserve the natural beauty and good traditional character of the Forest. There are currently ten verderers who together constitute the Court of Verderers (or Court of Swainmote). The Court of Verderers Lyndhurst, where the Court meets in open session The Court has ancient origins but in its present form is a corporate body set up under the New Forest Act 1887 and reconstituted in 1949. It currently consists of ten verderers, five of whom are elected by the commoners, and four of whom are appointed respectively by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Forestry Commission, the National Park Authority, and Natural England. The remaining position is held by the Official Verderer who serves as chair of the Court and who is appointed by the Queen. The Court has the same status as a Magistrates Court, and acting under its authority the verderers are responsible for regulating commoning within the Forest, for dealing with unlawful inclosures, and for a wide range of other matters relating to development control and conservation such as proposals for new roads, car parks, camping sites, recreational facilities, playing fields and so on. The verderers also work to ensure the health and welfare of the commoners' animals, and to assist with this they employ five paid Agisters whose role is to supervise the animals‚Äô day-to-day welfare. The Court of Verderers normally meets in open session once a month (other than August and December), at which ‚Äòpresentments‚Äô may be made by any commoner or other person. These are oral or written statements such as a concern or a complaint relating to the Forest that the petitioner wishes the Court to deal with. Where the presentment relates to a contentious matter, the Court may order that counter-presentments be heard in open court at a later date. The verderers work closely with the Forestry Commission, an appointee of which is a member of the Court. Some activities the Commission carries out or permits within the Forest may be subject to rights of common, and thus require the verderers‚Äô consent, while in the case of other activities the Commission may have a statutory power to override those rights or to proceed subject to consultation. To avoid misunderstandings, in 2002 the verderers and the Commission concluded a Memorandum of Understanding to help the parties determine how to handle specific activities that the Commission proposes to undertake or permit within the Forest. The New Forest became a National Park on 1 March 2005. It is managed by an government-funded organisation, The National Park Authority, which appoints one of the Court members. The verderers have a statutory duty (under section 62 of the Environment Act 1995) to take account of the purposes of National Park designation when making any decision which affects the Park. History In the 13th century the verderers were originally a court that was authorised by The Crown to deal with minor offences taking place within the Sovereign's Forest. Their powers were enlarged in the 17th and 18th centuries to enable the Court to deal with trespassers, and acts such as breaking inclosure fences which were detrimental to the planting and preservation of oak for shipbuilding. Under the New Forest Act of 1887 the Court was placed on a statutory basis, with the verderers becoming responsible for commoners, common rights, and the Forest landscape. The New Forest Act of 1949 gave the verderers additional powers to make and amend byelaws. Subsequent legislation of 1964, 1967 and 1970 has increased the range of issues the Court is required to approve or to be consulted on.

A prolific scientist with an interest in micropalaeontology and especially the foraminifera of the Triassic (in the then Tethys Ocean) and the Jurassic eras, Kristan-Tollmann published widely in her field. She is also known for originating with her husband Alexander Tollmann a thoroughly documented theory of the evolution of human legend and social structures as a result of a massive impact event which struck multiple points on earth. The latter has become known as Tollmann's hypothetical bolide. Life The daughter of an elementary school director, Kristan-Tollmann initially wanted to become a teacher herself. She received her secondary school diploma from a teacher- training school. However, she shifted her focus to study geology, paleontology and petrography in Vienna under the tutelage of Othmar K√ºhn, Felix Machachki, Hans Wieseneder and Leopold Kober. She received her doctorate in geology and paleontology in 1959 in the region of Hohe Wand. In the same year she completed her education, she married her classmate Alexander Tollmann, with whom she had a son Raoul in 1967. During her studies she also worked as a religion teacher in Vienna. Kristan-Tollmann specialized in micropalaeontology and especially the foraminifera of the Triassic (in the then Tethys Ocean) and the Jurassic periods. She described numerous new taxa. In addition to foraminifera, she later treated ostracods and other microfossils and invertebrate macro-fossils such as crinoids (which were a particular favorite of hers), corals, mollusks, brachiopods, and sea cucumbers. After initially working as a freelancer for the Geological Survey of Austria, from 1961 to 1968 she was a micropaleontologist adviser to the OMV. She was a visiting scholar at the Swedish Geological State Institute in Stockholm in 1966 and a Humboldt Fellow at the Naturmuseum Senckenberg and the University of Frankfurt in 1971/72, and then at the University of T√ºbingen in 1972/73. From 1976 to 1978 she conducted research at the Natural History Museum Vienna. In 1982 she received a post-doctoral degree in micropaleontology in Vienna and gave courses at the universities in Graz and Innsbruck. She died in 1995 of cancer. Career Kristan-Tollmann collected samples almost all over the Alps and expanded her sampling in the 1970s worldwide (Turkey, Iran, China, Timor, New Guinea, Australia, Japan, Central and North America as the Sonoran Desert in Mexico), on some quite dangerous trips to remote areas. For example, in 1975 she narrowly escaped the East Timor genocide. She often traveled alone, but prepared for her trips quite thoroughly. A major focus of her worldwide work was the global remote correlation of paleontological data in the Triassic Tethys and early Jurassic, the Black Jurassic. She discovered a surprising similarity in the fauna and the sequences, which also led to revisions of descriptions of taxa. Through her work, many of the early macro-fossils from this period which were first described in Austria in the classical period of paleontology and had been described differently in other parts of the world were reassigned. It also led to revisions in the theory of ocean currents in the Tethys Ocean, as larvae were posited to have traveled great distances as part of plankton in that body of water. For one example, she explained the correspondence of observably similar rock bodies in Alpine regions and Chine in the Triassic period as a function of global fluctuations in sea level. She explored the division between the Tethys Ocean and Panthalassa in New Caldonia. Kristan-Tollmann was a founding member of the Shallow Tethys and was involved in the organization of their meetings, for example, at the 4th Congress in 1994 at the Castle Albrechtsberg the Tollmanns. In 1991 she also organized the 3rd meeting of German-speaking ostracod researchers in Albrechtsberg. She authored around 120 scientific publications and was the first to describe around 500 new taxa. Her publication areas included foraminifera, ostracods, echinoderms, and calcareous nannofossils. The collection primarily reflects Edith Kristan-Tollmann's work on Foraminifera from the Triassic and Lower Jurassic and also contains a small amount of material published by her husband Alexander on the Neogene of Austria (full publication list for AT in Lein, 2007). Edith Kristan-Tollmann published extensively not only on Foraminifera but also on ostracods, echinoderms (holothurians, micro-crinoids) and calcareous nannofossils (full publication list in Lobitzer, 1996). Published foraminifera include the genera Variostoma, Diplotremina, Plagiostomella, Duostomina, Asymmetrina from the Triassic (1960) and Scyphodon, Callonina and Nephrosphaera from the Silurian of Austria (1971) and numerous new species. Although early work focused on the Alps and Austria, later published material embraced the Triassic of Iran, India, China, Japan, Indonesia, Papua-New Guinea, Australia and New Zealand, with discussions of taxonomy and distribution patterns throughout Tethys. A number of publications cite material as deposited in 'Sammlung Kristan-Tollmann, Geologisches Institut der Universit√§t Wien' but this is not correct and the specimens were, in fact, retained as a private collection. The Kristan-Tollmann Collection is currently being accessed into the Senckenberg Foraminifera Collections. From 1978 to 1992, she published along with her husband, Tollmann, the communications of the Austrian Geological Society. From 1975 to 1977 and again from 1990 to 1992, she was on the Advisory Board of the Paleontological Society. Catastrophic theories Kristan-Tollmann had been interested in the history of the priesthood and in theology and archaeology since her youth. In 1992, she co-published with her husband Alexander Tollmann an article that posited that around 7,500 BCE a Mesolithic disaster occurred when a comet struck the earth. According to the couple, the comet divided into seven fragments that struck the earth in seven places, documented in the myths and religious tracts of multiple cultures. The pair followed up this publication with a book on the same subject in 1993, Und die Sintflut gab es doch: vom Mythos zur historischen Wahrheit (And The Flood Did Exist: From the Myth to the Historical Truth), which became a bestseller in Austria and Germany. The book attributes to this disaster, with has become known as Tollmann's hypothetical bolide, the origin of priesthood (as a person who facilitates sacrifices to the gods), world religions, the Christian Genesis flood narrative, the myth of Atlantis and many other things. The authors credited the meteorite impact theory of Luis Walter Alvarez as influencing their own theories of a geological catastrophe that so influenced human history. They also postulated that such impact events were recurrent on about a 10,000 year cycle, citing dust bands in the Antarctic ice core around 17,000 to 18,000 years old as an indication that a previous impact had contributed to warming at the end of the last ice age. The theories reported in both the article and the book were the subject of fierce criticism. Other scientists tended to the theory that the Tollmanns had pushed their interpretation of the data too far, although the evidence of a comet impact at the time they posit has not been thoroughly discredited. Kristan-Tollmann also contributed to a follow-up book with Alexander Tollmann which was not published until after her death, Das Weltenjahr geht zu Ende, in which they predicted that, based on the prophecies of Nostradamus, the world would end at the turn of the millennium. Political activism Kristan-Tollmann was active in the anti-nuclear movement and on behalf of environmental protection. Her husband played a significant role in Green politics in Austria. In Und die Sintflut gab es doch, they also warn against exposure to the numerous nuclear power plants around the world, especially with regard to geological (earthquake) and impact risks.

Montreal defeated the Ontario Rugby Football Union (ORFU) champion Peterborough Club in a 71‚Äì10 blowout victory to win their second Canadian Championship. This was the eighth appearance in the title game for Montreal and the first and only appearance for Peterborough. Notably, referee Russell Britton admitted after the game that there was a scoring error when a touch-in-goal (one point) was given to Montreal when it should have counted as a try (five points). While the score should have been 75‚Äì10, it was officially recorded as 71‚Äì10. This was the highest scoring Dominion championship/Grey Cup in Canadian football history. Background The Intercollegiate Union did not allow the CIRFU champion Ottawa College to play Montreal for the Dominion title, in solidarity with a decision made by the Canadian Amateur Athletic Union (CAAU). The CAAU alleged that IRFU players were professionals and would not allow college teams to play against them. The CAAU also decreed that they would ban any teams from playing an intercollegiate team that had also played against an IRFU team. A match had been scheduled for November 23, 1907 between Peterborough and Ottawa, but only if it were for Dominion honours. Because Peterborough intended on playing Montreal in a championship game if they won, and Ottawa could not play Montreal if they won, the match was cancelled. While a home- and-home series was considered, ultimately this sudden death game was scheduled for November 30 instead.

The story spans three decades, beginning in the late 1930s and ending in the 1960s. The novel is Ortiz Cofer's main work of prose, and its publication helped broaden her readership. Originally published in English, the novel tells the story of a Puerto Rican family that emigrates to the United States. The story depicts the cultural, social, and personal struggles of family members to maintain their native Puerto Rican culture, and their way of life, both in the Puerto Rican barrio and in the suburbs of New Jersey. The beginning recounts the family's history in Puerto Rico, and the troubled life of Uncle Guzm√°n. The second half of the novel focuses on Marisol, the eldest daughter of the family. Marisol narrates her family's migration as they transition from rural life and the conditions of the Island to a tenement building in New Jersey, ultimately settling in the suburbs. Her commentary also covers her mother's brief return to the Island.  Synopsis   Plot and setting  The novel is divided into two parts, tracing the family's story in Puerto Rico, and then New Jersey. The first half of the novel, in Puerto Rico, is characterized by descriptions of tropical flora and fauna and the vibrant river valley surrounding the home of Rosa, the adolescent Guzm√°n's young love interest. The novel's setting is conveyed through the primary sensory organs of the body, the ears, eyes, and nose, as Guzm√°n continues to explore the world around him and begins to yearn for greater adventure beyond Puerto Rico. Rosa's house, the town of Salud, and Guzm√°n's childhood home represent all that is wonderful about the lush Puerto Rican landscape. In the second half of the novel, the family has moved to Paterson, New Jersey. The family members each begin to realize that the \\"promised land\\" of the United States does not fulfill its promise of wealth, prosperity, and opportunity for all. Guzm√°n's young niece, Marisol, assumes the role of narrator, conveying her family's struggle to assimilate into American culture through a series of experiences of inequality, discrimination, and misunderstanding. Marisol observes that El Building, their tenement in inner-city Paterson, although dilapidated and cramped, acts as a \\"microcosm of Island life with its intrigues, its gossip groups, and even its own spiritist\\" for the members of its community. Marisol describes the new role she takes on as a translator for her mother in a foreign world. Puerto Rico, by then, is real to her only through the visits of her legendary Uncle Guzm√°n, a physical and emotional embodiment of the rich culture, pride, and beauty her family has left behind for this new life in the U.S. Judith Ortiz Cofer highlights the economic poverty that has existed in Puerto Rico for decades, even though the country is aesthetically, historically, and culturally rich. Marisol's parents are models for the many parents in the Latinx community who seek fortune and opportunity outside of the island and in the United States. Guzm√°n, although he loves the island and its beauty, joins the U.S. army in search of adventure in distant places, something he feels the island cannot offer him. Marisol, through these experiences, ultimately discovers that living in the north of the United States, El Norte, only fulfills part of its promise of opportunity and fortune for people outside their homeland. Towards the end of the novel, her parents move to the New Jersey suburbs, an improvement over the Puerto Rican barrio and over the tenement she had grown accustomed to. But Marisol's mother, Ramona, remains separate from those around her, and over the rest of the novel grows increasingly dependent on her young daughter to navigate this unfamiliar political, social, and cultural world. Towards the end, Ramona decides to return briefly to the Island. Through the medium of stories, cooking, and religious rituals, the author shows how all the characters, in particular Guzm√°n, Ramona, Rafael, and the others of their generation, keep their culture and heritage alive even as El Norte, the North, continues to alienate them. Towards the end of The Line of the Sun, when Marisol has fully taken ownership of the story, the reader discovers how she and her family fuse their experiences in the North with their native culture, roots, and practices to create a unique Puerto Rican-American narrative.  Main characters  *Marisol: Teenage daughter of Ramona and Rafael; skeptical, helpful; narrator of the second half of the novel. *Guzm√°n: Uncle of Marisol and Gabriel; known at birth as \\"el ni√±o del diablo\\"; adventurous, longs for a life off the Island. *Rosa: Daughter of Do√±a Lupe; a strong spiritist and herbalist who becomes Guzm√°n's love interest. *Ramona: Sister of Guzm√°n and mother of Marisol; protective, responsible, and intrigued by moving from Puerto Rico. *Rafael: Son of Don Juan; fair-skinned and blonde; known as a \\"sad angel\\"; former Navy veteran, and close friend of Guzm√°n. *Mam√° Cielo: Mother of Guzm√°n; a hard worker and very practical; tangible representation of the ethereal sky. *Pap√° Pepe: Husband of Mama Cielo and father of Guzm√°n; a bookworm and strong spiritist. *Carmelo: Son of Mam√° Cielo and Pap√° Pepe, brother to Guzm√°n; bookish, melancholy, solitary; dies in battle very young. *Padre C√©sar: \\"El Padrecito\\"; thin, sallow, bookish priest in Salud; close friend of Carmelo. *Gabriel: Younger brother of Marisol and son of Rafael and Ramona; observant, scientific; very close to Marisol.  Themes   Identity  Judith Ortiz Cofer explores how identity is formed through her characters' movement, not only physically in space and time as individuals, but also as migrants to the United States as a collective cultural unit. She deliberately crosses the boundaries of narrative voice to produce a transgressive novel, challenging the sexual, narrative, and autobiographical norms that affect her as a Puerto Rican-American artist. The character of Marisol embodies a \\"double otherness\\", in being separated from her Puerto Rican homeland, physically and culturally, and being fully integrated neither in New Jersey nor in Puerto Rico. Marisol represents a migrant consciousness, typifying Puerto Rican and other migrants who are in a constant state of identity formation and development as they move from place to place.  Culture  The religious, political, and social atmosphere of the characters' hometown of Salud is depicted in the novel, which also portrays Puerto Rican culture, and cultural transference in a new landscape such as the United States. One illustration of this transference is Marisol's description of her experience of the first few months in El Building: > I put my coat on and left the apartment. The smells and beans boiling in a > dozen kitchens assailed my nostrils. Rice and beans, the unimaginative > staple food of all these people who re-created every day the same routines > they had followed in their mam√°'s houses so long ago. In this excerpt, and many others throughout the book, Ortiz Cofer evokes the present condition of the family as they learn to adapt to their new environment. She references the cultural routines transferred from Puerto Rico to El Building that shape this new barrio into a replica of what the characters once knew.  Religion and colonialism  The author spends time at the beginning of the novel showing the family's traditions, beginning with Mam√° Cielo and Pap√° Pepe as they raise Guzm√°n. Guzm√°n is reckless and troublesome from an early age, and his father and mother often pray and keep in contact with \\"various benevolent entities\\" to help them raise their child. The narrative conveys deep knowledge of the rich history of the town of Salud, a story rooted in the development of the Church when the Spaniards came to colonize the island. But the history of Salud goes further back than colonization, with anecdotes and hearsay from the villagers' old stories of the past. Ortiz Cofer uses such storytelling techniques to demonstrate the relativity of historical events, and to offer a historical narrative that begins with a non-Eurocentric perspective.  Storytelling and truth  Judith Ortiz Cofer notes that switching between the perspectives of Marisol and Guzm√°n is part of the autobiographical style of her prose. Talking to Rafael Ocasio, Professor of Spanish at Agnes Scott College, she describes her approach to storytelling as a movement between personal and public narrative, recognizing the deeply individual experiences of her characters, and also giving voice to the collective experiences they share with others in the communities that they shift between: > As a writer, I feel absolutely at liberty to cross over boundaries. My > technique is to start with something that I know very well, like my Uncle > Guzm√°n. People loved him in spite of the fact that he was a rascal. I > started with that which was absolutely true. Then I started imagining him in > situations that had never actually happened. I think literature has a truth > that has nothing to do with the dictionary definition of truth. Factual and historical elements based on Ortiz Cofer's own life and experiences growing up are combined in the novel with imaginative storytelling that enables characters to speak their truth as they operate in the story line. For Marisol, her ability to conclude the story represents her maturing into a fully grown adult. References to the town of Salud's past history, as it is written and passed down through the characters and in the narrative, echo the major historical role of storytelling in Puerto Rican tradition.  Natural law and ritual  The novel contains references to the spiritual aspects of Salud and its townspeople. The author, however, distinguishes her allusions to espiritismo in The Line of the Sun from the concepts used in magic realism, a literary style prevalent in the works of prominent Latin American authors such as Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez and Isabel Allende: > As I use espiritismo in my novel, there is nothing there that cannot be > explained through natural law. The migrant Puerto Rican brought espiritismo > to the United States in order to feel some connection with and some control > over a world that was extremely confusing. That's the way I use it in The > Line of the Sun. From Marisol's perspective, similar to that of the author, ritual is mainly rooted in the natural. Ritual transferred from Puerto Rico to the United States transforms into a \\"socio-psychological defense mechanism\\" that migrants use to adapt to their new environment, but that other tenants and law enforcement officials in the barrio consider strange and inappropriate in an American context.  Reception  During the Post-Boom phase of the Latin American literary boom, in the 1990s, there was growing interest in Latin American countries. In 1996, the University of Puerto Rico published The Line of the Sun in Spanish translation, as La L√≠nea del Sol, in response to rising public interest in Puerto Rican identity and Judith Ortiz Cofer's work. Many commentators have criticized Judith Ortiz Cofer's literary style, and her treatment of Puerto Rican-American identity development, in the dual narration of The Line of the Sun. Professor and poet Darlene Pag√°n notes that this type of criticism is common for any female \\"Puerto Rican writing in English\\", because she \\"is generally expected to conform to certain habits, forms, or significations that identify her as Puerto Rican, one of which is this sense of place\\". Other critics have described her work as \\"straddling two cultures\\", because the fluidity of space and the location shifts throughout this novel and some of her other work make it difficult to categorize and interpret as either Puerto Rican or American literature. Socolovsky identifies this as being a \\"common trope for understanding U.S. multicultural writers\\".

Niv later founded LK Eyewear LLC, but the enterprise never got off the ground. Niv was introduced to King around 2011 and the two became friends and would partner on several business ventures, such as an online store for adult incontinence products. Niv also hired King to do infomercials and narrate videos for various companies and organizations in Israel, where King is well-known.

It was written by the 84-year-old author in 1777 almost simultaneously with the tragedy Ir√®ne, only months before he died. It was not performed on the public stage until the first anniversary of his death. Composition The actor Fleury, who played the role of Polycrate The actor Brizard, who played the role of Ydasan Voltaire sent a copy of the manuscript to his friend d'Argental in August 1777, describing it to him as 'too cold and insipid' and urging him not to let anyone else see it. A month later, after further work, he was more confident about it, and hoped that the marvel of a play from an 84-year-old would soften the harshness of the critics. However of his two new plays he gradually came to consider that Ir√®ne would work better on stage, and it was indeed that work which was rehearsed and performed while he was alive. He wrote again to d'Argental on 25 October to say that he felt Agathocle was only suitable for performing 'at the Olympic Games of some school of Platonic philosophy. I'm sending you something (Ir√®ne) more passionate, more theatrical, and more interesting.' Action The action takes place in ancient Syracuse in the palace of the tyrant Agathocle (Agathocles) and the ruins of the Temple of Ceres. Peace has been agreed between Syracuse and Carthage, which requires prisoners to be freed. The Carthaginian soldier Ydasan wants to secure the release of his captive daughter Ydace, but both the two sons of the tyrant Agathocle desire her. Polycrate is ready to undermine the peace agreement by refusing to allow Ydace to leave. The selfless Argide, on the other hand, protects her from his brother and when a fight ensues, he kills him. Agathocle is consumed with grief at his son's death, but recognises the virtue in Argide's motives. Argide renounces any claim over Ydace. To general surprise, Agathocle abdicates in favour of Argide, who promptly abdicates in turn, declaring the Republic restored. Performances The first performance of Agathocle was a private one in the house theatre on Voltaire's estate at Ferney in September 1777, after which the author made a number of corrections to it. After Voltaire died his niece Mme Denis asked the Com√©die Fran√ßaise to stage it for the first anniversary of his death on 31 May 1779. Before the performance, the actor Jean Baptiste Brisard read a speech written by Jean- Baptiste le Rond d'Alembert. The role of Agathocle was played by (fr) Grammont, Polycrate by Fleury, Argide by (fr) Mol√©, Ydasan by (fr) Brizard, Egeste by Dorival, Elp√©nor by Florence, and Ydace by Mlle Saint-Val. The public did not like the play and Agathocle was taken off the stage after only four performances. Contemporary reception Critical opinion was not kind to Agathocle. La Harpe described it as ‚Äòa most imperfect sketch‚Äô with lifeless and colourless characters which the author might have been able to work up into a full play if he had tackled the subject earlier before his strength failed him. The Kehl edition of Voltaire's works also emphasised that the work was little more than an outline, of value mainly because it showed how Voltaire worked up a dramatic idea into a final performance text. Printed editions Agathocle was first printed in volume six of the Kehl edition of Voltaire's Complete Works (Oeuvres Completes de Voltaire, Kehl, 1784, Volume 6, pp. 337-393). No contemporary printings of the play on its own are known.

Design and development Following the WOS-37, his development of the Czerwi≈Ñski CW 5 bis, Michal Blaicher turned to a new design incorporating Fowler flaps. Construction began in the ZASPL workshops but moved when ZASPL became LWL, controlled by PWS, delaying its completion. Its first flight was made either late in 1938 or in the spring of 1939 at Lw√≥w-Ski≈Çn√≥w, flown by Zbigniew ≈πabski. After some modifications it was ready for official testing in August 1939 but was destroyed in the German invasion the following month. The all-wood B-38 had a cantilever gull wing built around two spars and covered with stress-relieving plywood. The mass balanced ailerons were assisted by Flettner tab and, inboard of them, Fowler flaps filled the remaining 2/3 of the span. The glider's fuselage was a ply-covered, semi-monocoque structure of oval cross-section. Its single seat cockpit, which included blind flying instrumentation, was enclosed and had a long dorsal fairing behind it. At the rear the cantilever tailplane was mounted above the fuselage on the fin; like the ailerons the elevators were tab assisted. Fixed empennage surfaces were ply-covered and the control surfaces fabric-covered. A detachable, two-wheeled trolley was used for take-off and a sprung skid for landings.

In an effort to support the reforms in Vietnam and foster the country's shift from a centrally planned to a market-based economy, the WB's partnership with Vietnam has witnessed more than 270 projects or advisory and analytic activities conducted through strategic partnerships with four of the WBG's five organizations, covering areas including poverty reduction, education, rural and urban services, infrastructure, new energy, and environmental protection. The WB and the government of Vietnam have made joint efforts to improve Vietnam's development, including strengthening competitiveness, improving sustainability, and increasing opportunities for the poor. In terms of future planning, Vietnam and the WB are prioritizing \\"inclusive growth, investment in people, environmental sustainability and good governance\\", as illustrated in the new Country Partnership Framework (CPF), which was approved and endorsed by the WBG in May 2017. Based on analyses from two previous reports, the CPF introduced several strategic shifts, including strengthening private sector development, supporting financial sustainability and poverty reduction, improving education, and promoting low carbon energy generation. Background Founded in the 1940s, the World Bank (WB) is an international financial institution. The WB has evolved into the World Bank Group (WBG), which consists of five closely related institutions: the International Development Association (IDA), the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), and the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). According to the WB website, the term \\"World Bank\\" refers only to the IBRD and IDA, which \\"provide low- interest loans, interest-free credit, and grants to developing countries\\". Vietnam joined the WBG on 21 September 1956. Before the mid-1980s, Vietnam was one of the world's least developed countries.

The WB and the government of Vietnam have made joint efforts to improve Vietnam's development, including strengthening competitiveness, improving sustainability, and increasing opportunities for the poor. Vietnam joined the IDA on 24 September 1960, the IBRD on 21 September 1956, the IFC on 4 August 1967, and the MIGA on 5 October 1994. IDA Metro Line 2 was under construction in Hanoi in 2016.|alt=The Metro Line 2 extends as a bridge above a plaza with many people. , the IDA has provided Vietnam with credits totaling about and grants totaling , which supported more than 160 projects covering sectors such as public administration, water supply and sanitation, waste management, health, social protection, agriculture, education, and transportation. Of the 169 projects, 43 are active () and 7 have been dropped. In 2018, the Dynamic City Integrated Development project was approved to further improve urban infrastructure and urban management. The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) evaluates the development effectiveness of the WBG and over the past decade has assessed IDA projects in Vietnam as generally positive; most project ratings were moderately satisfactory or better. However, due to more complicated project designs, deficient performance evaluation, and the postponement of remedy measures, a tendency for outcome ratings to decline has been seen in more recent years. IBRD In 2009, the IBRD approved its first loan, of , to Vietnam \\"to support public investment reforms\\". , the IBRD had financed 16 projects in Vietnam, with a total lending portfolio of about . The projects funded cover sectors including public administration, sanitation, energy transmission and distribution, energy and extractives, industry, trade and services, transportation, and rural and inter-urban roads. IFC , the IFC has invested about in 50 projects in Vietnam and budgeted a total of in advisory services to 16 projects. Since establishing its office in Vietnam in 1997, the IFC has worked to improve the private sector's access to finance, encourage structural reforms, promote international standards, and improve Vietnam's business climate. Vietnamese Business Forum In December 1997 in Tokyo, Japan, a Consultative Group Meeting was held between the Vietnamese government and its community of donors. The IFC suggested that there be dialogue between the government and private sector, which led to the establishment of the Vietnamese Business Forum (VBF). According to the VBF website, \\"the initiative was made in the context that government, donors, and foreign investors were looking for improvements to accelerate investment in Vietnam. Meanwhile, there had been numerous free-flowing unstructured meetings between the government leaders and individual foreign investors, leading contradictory recommendations.\\" With the guidance of the IFC, the VBF has saved an estimated $200 million for the private sector through \\"reforms that reduced barriers and increased transparency in business development processes\\". The VBF has continued efforts to ensure fair implementation of laws and to promote open and clear communications between the Vietnamese government and the private sector in all aspects of the Vietnamese economy. At the 2019 semiannual VBF, the chambers of multiple countries, such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce (AmCham), Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Vietnam (JCCI), Korean Chamber of Business in Vietnam (KoCham), and British Business Group in Vietnam (BBGV), reported on and discussed a multitude of topics ranging from Vietnam's high levels of investment into infrastructural developments to large scale progress in renewable energy. In the closing statements by Ousmane Dione, the World Bank Country Director for Vietnam, it was noted there was a need for Vietnam be more adaptive and not just smarter or more conservative. MIGA , the MIGA has guaranteed a total of for three projects, collaborating with the IBRD and the IFC to enhance infrastructure, manufacturing development, and private sector growth in Vietnam. In 2013, MIGA guaranteed of the loan supporting the expansion of the Masan Group's consumer products business; this, alongside the IFC's investment, increased food security, boosted job creation, created significant tax revenues, and improved the development of local small and medium enterprises. On 7 March 2014, MIGA guaranteed to cover the loan financing the BT20 National Highway 20 Project, which aimed to rehabilitate and upgrade the critical connector road for the Ho Chi Minh City‚ÄìDa Lat corridor and was expected to boost the economic development of Vietnam's poorest areas. On 31 December 2015, MIGA guaranteed for the Hoi Xuan Hydropower Project, which supported the development and improvement of renewable energy and energy infrastructure in Vietnam. Significant projects Poverty reduction Lai Chau Province were improved.|alt=A rural road next to several hills is being upgraded in Lai Chau Province. A series of projects have been implemented to reduce poverty and improve living conditions in Vietnam. Launched in 2001, the First Northern Mountains Poverty Reduction Project aimed to improve infrastructure and rural services, covering broad sectors such as rural roads, irrigation systems, water supply, education, and health systems. The project, alongside the Second Project launched in 2010 with similar goals, resulted in a 15% increase in per-capita income among project beneficiaries in the poorest region of Vietnam. Other projects, including ten Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) projects starting from 2001 and three Rural Financial Projects, also benefited rural private enterprises and households through improved access to finance. The percentage of people living under the national poverty line decreased from nearly 60% in 1993 to 13.5% in 2014. During the implementation of the PRSC projects, problems‚Äîincluding inadequate local knowledge and inefficient cooperation‚Äîdelayed the project's operations and raised concerns about the program's quality; both the overall project and Vietnam's performance were rated unsatisfactory by the Project Performance Assessment Report. Education Nguyen Quang Dieu High School|alt=Buildings and a courtyard in the Nguyen Quang Dieu High School The WB has funded numerous education projects that aimed to increase the accessibility, quality, and equality of education in Vietnam. In 1993, the first education project, the Primary Education Project, was launched in Vietnam. According to the WB, the project \\"provided more and better school books, built classrooms and improved school management in five rural provinces.\\" It increased the enrollment rate (the rate of children attending school) from 86% in 1993 to 95% in 2002. From 2013 to 2017, the Vietnam School Readiness Promotion Project was launched to \\"raise school readiness\\" for 5-year-old children. The project raised the enrollment rate of preschool children from 73.7% in 2012 to 87.6% in 2017. From 2009 to 2014, three projects under the Higher Education Development Policy Program supported and implemented a higher-education reform to improve quality, accountability, and transparency in education. Infrastructure and rural services Out of over 200 WB-supported projects, 53 projects were related to \\"rural services and infrastructure\\", the most of any area. According to the IEG, the Third Rural Transport Project (2006‚Äì2014) aimed to \\"reduce travel costs and improve access\\" in rural areas through rehabilitating and maintaining rural roads. People living within of an all- weather road increased from 76% in 2011 to 87% in 2014. The Red River Delta Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project aimed to establish and improve water supply and sanitation infrastructure. The project was expected to benefit 800,000 people living in four provinces in the Red River Delta. Implemented from 2004 to 2014, the Vietnam Urban Upgrading Project aimed to improve infrastructure for 7.5 million urban residents, through improving homes, roads, canals, and bridges. Energy Since 2000, Vietnam's annual GDP growth rate has been between 5% and 7.6%. The country's energy demand and consumption have grown in accordance. On 26 April 2011, the WB approved the Trung Son Hydropower Project, which aimed to generate renewable energy in the form of hydroelectricity. With a loan of $330 million from the IBRD, the Trung Son Hydropower Company constructed the dam while the WB provided facilitation and technical support. By 31 July 2017, the project had generated an accumulated energy output of and in revenue. Previous projects, such as the Second Rural Energy Project from 2004 to 2014, have also benefited households in rural areas through providing more electricity and increasing accessibility. Future goals and strategy shifts alt=Vietnamese farmers surrounded by photographers Country Partnership Framework The new Country Partnership Framework (CPF)‚Äîfor Vietnam from 2018 to 2022‚Äîwas endorsed by the WBG's Board of Executive Directors on 5 May 2017. In the partnership, Vietnam and the WBG are prioritizing \\"inclusive growth, investment in people, environmental sustainability and good governance\\". The CPF was \\"based on analysis in the Vietnam 2035: Toward Prosperity, Creativity, Equity, and Democracy and the 2016 Vietnam Systematic Country Diagnostic\\" and introduced several strategic shifts, including strengthening private sector development, supporting financial sustainability and poverty reduction, improving education, and promoting low carbon energy generation. The WB planned to further promote private sector development, support public services and transfers, reduce poverty among ethnic minorities, reconcile the education and labor markets, and encourage more low-carbon energy generation. Vietnam 2035: Toward Prosperity, Creativity, Equity, and Democracy Experts from the WB and Vietnam have made joint efforts to construct a blueprint for the country's future development, which were expressed in Vietnam 2035: Toward Prosperity, Creativity, Equity, and Democracy. According to the report, Vietnam plans to complete its transition into a modern, industrialized country by 2035. Three pillars were proposed to achieve the goal: \\"Economic Prosperity with Environmental Sustainability\\", \\"Equity and Social Inclusion\\", and \\"A Capable and Accountable State\\". Controversies While the WB has made significant commitments to Vietnam, the extent of the WB's contributions to Vietnam's development has been debated. Although the WB presented Vietnam as the successful model of its market-oriented policies, critics have argued that the role of the WB in fostering Vietnam's ƒê·ªïi M·ªõi reforms was exaggerated because the reforms were more internal than external. In the 1990s, the WB made several proposals for structural adjustments in Vietnam. However, the Vietnamese government refused to adopt these proposals, and it has since been reluctant to liberalize trade, leading some scholars to conclude that the WB had limited influence on Vietnam's development.

Also rare at that time, he created interior views of the factory, and its workers. At that time he had contact with the Berliner painter and etcher Julius C. Turner (1881-1948) who is also known for his industrial interiors. Turner established also a contact to K√§the Kollwitz who exhibited at that time in Osnabr√ºck. With the help of a stipend of the city of Osnabr√ºck, he was able to study from 1929 for about two years at the Kunsthochschule Kassel under professor Curt Witte (1882-1959), its director from 1925 to 1932. In Kassel Ehrhardt continued not only the study of portraits and academic nudes, but also of industrial interiors. While the city directory of Osnabr√ºck of 1928/9 registers him as a mechanic, he is called in the directory of 1930 as 'art painter'. From the 1930s on, a large oeuvre of him survived mostly in private collections, showing his popularity and his success among his buyers. He was now able to support his family with his art work. His main subjects are local views of Osnabr√ºck, cityscapes, streets, the Halster Mill, but also landscapes of the Harz, views at the port of Hamburg, and Rothenburg ob der Tauber. He still was interested in industrial interiors. The Georgsmarienh√ºtte, the steel mill south of Osnabr√ºck, became his favourite subject. Coming himself from a mechanics' background his paintings of the steel mill stand out at that time, and were compared in a 1989 exhibition with Adolph Menzel. In his concentration on architecture, landscape and lighting, he created a timeless atmosphere in his paintings. His artwork thrived in a milieu where an oil painting belonged to the pre-requisites of a German middle class home. After WWII and the destruction of large swaths of Osnabr√ºck and other German cities, he re-gained popularity among his customers in the 1950s. They cherished the timelessness and his historical views of Osnabr√ºck and other sites, depicting a peaceful pre-war era gone forever. When tastes in art and middle class life style changed in the 1960s and 1970s, his traditional customer base vanished and he became almost forgotten. An exhibition in 1989 in Osnabr√ºck re- discovered him as an important regional painter of the mid-century, who recorded with a keen eye Osnabr√ºck and its region.

He was an influential art professor at Howard University from 1929 to 1968 and is considered a pioneer in modern art education. Early life and education \\"African Fantasy\\" - Woodcut,1929 Wells was born on November 2, 1902 in Atlanta, Georgia. His father was a Baptist minister and his mother taught school. When he was young, his family moved to Florida. Wells's first experience in art was assisting his mother with her kindergarten art class. When Wells was thirteen years old, he won two prizes in art at the Florida State Fair, a first prize in painting and a second prize in woodworking. Wells went on to attend Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, and later attended Columbia University in New York City, majoring in art studies. Wells later studied art at the National Academy of Design. Career Farmlands, WPA commission, 1935-1943 Early in his career, Wells was primarily a graphic artist. He worked with block printing, lithography and etching. He created graphic illustrations for books, journals, and other publications, including the illustrations for a poetry collection of Marianne Moore and history periodicals of the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History. In 1929, Wells was hired as a crafts instructor at Howard University in Washington D.C.. He taught block printing, ceramics, clay modeling and sculpture. Two years later, Well convinced the University's College of Fine Arts to offer classes in linoleum printmaking. Wells was known for his inventive and modern printmaking. He was an influential teacher and mentor to young artists during his career, including prominent sculptor Elizabeth Catlett. After 1931, Wells gained recognition as a painter. Many of his paintings were shown at the Phillips Memorial Gallery in Washington D.C., included with the William Harmon Foundation traveling exhibitions and exhibited in many museums and art galleries worldwide. Wells's early work was inspired by the work of German Expressionist woodcut artists. He also was fascinated with abstract cubism and African sculpture. During the Depression, Wells was director of a summer arts program in a Harlem nightclub. His art assistants included Charles Alston, Jacob Lawrence, and Georgette Seabrooke. In the early 1930s, influenced by the widespread economic hardship of the Great Depression, Wells made a decision to focus on art that was more affordable. From that point on, he created art that was reproducible: lithographs, woodcuts and etchings. His new work reflected his interest in the African-American experience, and often portrayed workers from all cultures and ethnicity. After World War II, Wells spent a year working in Stanley William Hayter's Atelier 17 studio in New York City. During the 1950s, Wells continued to teach art at Howard University, and also continued to create art and exhibit his work. Wells was actively involved in the civil rights movement of the 1960s, protesting separate lunch counters and advocating for hiring black policemen in New York City. Wells was a prominent artist in Washington D.C. for sixty years. He retired from teaching in 1968, but continued to work into his eighties. in 1973, Fisk University held a one-man show of Well's work. In 1980, Wells was awarded the Presidential Citation for Lifelong Contribution to American art by President Jimmy Carter. In 1986, a retrospective exhibition of his work was held at the Washington Project for the Arts. The exhibition was titled \\"Sixty Years in Art\\". Wells died in Washington D.C. on January 20, 1993.

All five people on board ‚Äì the pilot and four passengers, including club owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha ‚Äì were killed. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch attributed the crash to a loss of yaw control owing to a failure of the tail rotor control linkage. History of the flight Vichai frequently travelled to and from Leicester City's matches at the King Power Stadium in the helicopter, with the Leicester Mercury describing it as \\"a familiar sight for Foxes fans.\\" On 27 October, the helicopter departed Fairoaks Airport in Surrey with the pilot and one passenger on board. It stopped at London Heliport to collect three additional passengers ‚Äî Srivaddhanaprabha and two members of his staff ‚Äî before departing at 14:43 BST (13:43 UTC). It arrived at the Leicester City Football Club Training Ground on Belvoir Drive, south of the King Power Stadium at 15:58 BST (14:58 UTC). All on board disembarked and traveled by car to the stadium for Leicester's game against West Ham United. The pilot and one passenger returned after the football match concluded and then, as was usual, flew the helicopter to the stadium to collect Srivaddhanaprabha and his two staff members. The helicopter was seen preparing to lift off from the pitch live on BT Sport, during a post-match broadcast. By this point, the coach carrying the West Ham team had departed, but some Leicester City staff and players were still in the stadium, while there remained fans of both clubs in areas outside. The aircraft was due to fly to Luton Airport. Accident With Vichai, the pilot and three other people on board, the helicopter took off from within the stadium at approximately 20:37 BST (19:37 UTC). As the pilot turned the helicopter towards its en-route heading, the tail rotor control linkage broke, sending the helicopter into an uncontrollable spin. One witness described the aircraft falling \\"like a stone to the floor\\". It struck the ground in stadium Car Park E, about from the stadium, and burst into flames. Two police officers and club staff leaving the stadium attempted to rescue those in the helicopter but had to retreat due to the heat and flames. Investigators ruled out a suggestion of a collision with a police drone as a possible cause. The following day, Leicestershire Police confirmed that everybody on board had been killed in the crash and subsequent fire, and named the five fatalities. They were three Thais: club owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha and two members of his staff ‚Äì Kaveporn Punpare and Nusara Suknamai, British pilot Eric Swaffer, and his Polish girlfriend, co-pilot Izabela Roza Lechowicz. A small memorial has been erected at East Sheen Cemetery for these two pilots. There were no casualties elsewhere. Aircraft The aircraft involved in the accident was an AgustaWestland AW169 helicopter, registration G-VSKP, c/n 69018, manufactured in 2016. It seated 10 people and weighed roughly . It was powered by two Pratt & Whitney Canada PW210A engines. The aircraft was owned by Foxborough and operated by Amadeus Aviation. This was the first crash and hull loss involving the AW169. Investigation The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) opened an investigation into the accident. Italy's Agenzia Nazionale per la Sicurezza del Volo, representing the state of the manufacturer of the helicopter, and Canada's Transportation Safety Board, representing the state of the manufacturer of the helicopter's engines, provided assistance. Accredited representatives from Poland's State Commission on Aircraft Accidents Investigation and Thailand's Aircraft Accident Investigation Committee also provided assistance.) The aircraft's Digital Flight Data Recorder was recovered on 28 October, having been severely damaged in the fire. It was transported to the AAIB's base at Farnborough, Hampshire, for downloading of data contained therein. The wreckage of the helicopter was transported to Farnborough on 2 November. A coroner's court was created to investigate the official cause of death for the passengers and crew of the helicopter. The investigation reported in the court revealed that there was minimal opportunity for any individuals who survived the initial crash to escape, or anyone to help those trapped. On 7 November, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) issued an Airworthiness Directive, demanding checks of the tails of all AgustaWestland AW169 and AgustaWestland AW189 helicopters, as a precautionary measure. On 14 November, the AAIB released a Special Bulletin, outlining the progress of the investigation. A loss of yaw control was revealed as the cause of the aircraft crashing, with the reasons for the loss of yaw control not yet determined. On 30 November, the EASA issued an Emergency Alert Service Bulletin requiring periodic inspection of part of the tail rotor system. This was made mandatory by an Airworthiness Directive issued the same day. On 6 December 2018, the AAIB published a second Special Bulletin. Investigators revealed that loss of control of the helicopter resulted from the tail rotor actuator control shaft (which controls the pitch of the tail rotor blades) becoming disconnected from the actuator lever mechanism that transmits the pilots' pedal inputs to control the helicopter's yaw. They have also revealed evidence of the normally stationary control shaft being spun by the tail rotor which caused the castellated nut holding the actuator lever in place to friction weld to its carrier, shear off its split pin and rotate off the threaded shaft. The locking nut and pin carrier were found loose in the tail rotor fairing and were bonded together. A duplex bearing that was designed to allow the control shaft to remain stationary (with the rest of the tail rotor assembly rotating around it) was found to only allow a few degrees of rotation, with the races blocked up by a mix of burnt grease and metallic particles. Work continues to identify the cause of the damage observed to the duplex bearing and to establish its contribution to the failure sequence. Responses Leicester City F.C. delegation in Thai AirAsia livery took off at the Don Mueang International Airport, to attend the memorial service of Vichai. Fans began to lay flowers and football shirts outside the ground the next morning. Shirts and scarves were also seen from other teams including West Ham United, Leicester City's opponent in the match prior to the crash. On 30 October, Leicester City opened a book of condolence, with an online version also available. In the immediate aftermath of the accident, some buildings were floodlit in blue as a tribute to the victims, including England's national stadium, Wembley. The Leicester City Foxes Foundation Charity was renamed The Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha Foundation in honour of the deceased chairman and owner. On 10 November Leicester City fans took part in a '5,000-1' walk in united remembrance of the helicopter crash victims. Thousands of fans took part in the memorial walk before Leicester City played Burnley at home. The initial appeal was for 5,000 fans to take part, though reports suggested the number was about 10,000.  Football  The 2018‚Äì19 FA Women's Championship match between Leicester City and Manchester United, scheduled for the day after the crash, was postponed out of respect for the victims. The women's reserve league match against Derby County was also postponed. Leicester City's 2018‚Äì19 EFL Cup fixture against Southampton, which had been scheduled to take place at the King Power Stadium on 30 October 2018, and the 2018‚Äì19 Premier League International Cup fixture between Leicester City U-23s and Feyenoord Academy, were also subsequently postponed. The 2018‚Äì19 Belgian First Division B fixture between Oud-Heverlee Leuven, the second club owned by Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, and Lommel, originally scheduled for 31 October, was also postponed. At the other Premier League football fixtures on Sunday, players wore black armbands, both for the crash victims and for Remembrance Day, though a few days earlier than Remembrance armbands are usually worn.

She was honoured with the Order of Lenin and the Medal \\"For Valiant Labour in the Great Patriotic War 1941‚Äì1945\\". Life Klavdiya Yakovlevna Latysheva was born in Kiev on 14 March 1897 in a military family. She completed her high school in 1916, and obtained a degree from the Physico-Mathematical division of the Kiev higher women's educational institution in 1921. The rest of her education and career was at the University of Kiev. From 1925 to 1928, she was in postgraduate studies, working on finding solutions to differential and integral equations using Mikhail Kravchuk's method of moments. Kravchuk was her doctoral adviser. She was the first Ukrainian woman to obtain a doctorate in the mathematical and physical sciences, with her dissertation on approximate solutions to linear differential equations with singular coefficients (1936). Latysheva was an organiser of the first All-Ukrainian Mathematical Olympiad in 1936. During the Second World War, Latysheva transferred to Saratov. She worked at the automotive and highway faculty of the Saratov State Technical University. In 1946, she established a scientific group in the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics of University of Kiev to study the analytical theory of differential equations. Between 1953 and 1956, Latysheva headed this group. She was the dean of the Faculty between 1952 and 1954. For her contributions to mathematics, she was awarded the Order of Lenin in 1954, as well as the Medal \\"For Valiant Labour in the Great Patriotic War 1941‚Äì1945\\". Latysheva died on 11 May 1956, and was interred in the Lukyanovsk cemetery in Kiev. Scientific work Latysheva developed an effective method for the construction of solutions of linear ordinary differential equations around regular and irregular points by expanding on Poincar√©'s concept of rank and L. Tome's concept of anti-rank. This is now known as the Frobenius-Latysheva method. As part of this work, she determined a new type of normal and normal- regular solutions, and provided necessary and sufficient conditions for their existence. This was a major contribution, providing for the existence of closed-form solutions of linear differential equations with polynomial coefficients. A series of twelve articles, published between 1946‚Äì1952, established the full results, and also simplified and extended related theorems in the analytic theory of differential equations by Poincar√©, Cayley and others.

He is Kurdish, Shia Muslim and married to a Dutch Christian wife. He moved to Baghdad in 1967 and graduated from Baghdad University in 1971. While in Baghdad he joined the Kurdish Student Union and then the Kurdistan Democratic Party. In 1975, after the Kurdish defeat in the Second Iraqi‚ÄìKurdish War, Hussein moved to the Netherlands, where he studied for a doctorate in international relations. He led the Kurdish students union abroad from 1976 and became the deputy head of the Kurdish Institute in Paris in 1987. He married a Dutch Protestant Christian while in the Netherlands, who was a descendant of the Italian Montessori family. He speaks fluent Kurdish, Arabic, Dutch and English.

In her postdoctoral fellowship with Samuel Danishefsky, Young was among one of a handful of groups in the mid-1990s to synthesize paclitaxel (Taxol), a highly- oxegenated terpenoid natural product used to treat cancer.  Career  Despite multiple employment offers on the East Coast of the United States, Young chose to remain in the San Francisco Bay Area for her professional career. From 1995 to 2006, Young worked at Celera Genomics, studying inhibitor compounds of human plasma proteins such as kallikrein and Factors VIIa and IXa. She was recruited to Genentech in 2006, and in 2018 was promoted to Senior Vice President of Small Molecule drug discovery. One of her major research successes was development of a chemistry campaign against Bruton's tyrosine kinase, leading to molecules to potentially treat rheumatoid arthritis and B-cell lymphomas. Her team developed fenebrutinib, currently in Phase II trials for several autoimmune disorders.  Awards  * 2018 - William S.

History In 1867 the Manchester and Milford Railway (M&MR;) opened the railway from Pencader to Aberystwyth. however in 1906 the Great Western Railway took over the line and added a halt at Pencarreg in 1930. The halt became part of British Railways upon nationalisation in 1948 but was closed in 1965. Photographs show that it stood on a single track section of the line, had no sidings or signalling, had one short wooden platform, a small shelter, a single oil lamp and a path leading down from the nearby road. In December 1964 severe flooding damaged the line south of Aberystwyth and passenger services were cancelled. A limited service continued running from Carmarthen to Tregaron for a few months after the line was severed and the route was closed to passengers in February 1965, the line itself however remained open for milk traffic until 1973.Pencarreg Railway Halt, Pencarreg Retrieved : 2018-10-27 Nothing now remains of the station and the trackbed is a rough track.

Prior to this, he was the founding director of the Iraq Energy Institute, a think tank producing scholarship and analysis on current, historic and future energy, economy and technology trends in Iraq, as well as organizing high-level fora on energy reform in Iraq and the region. A frequent commentator on Iraq's energy strategic policies and an advocate of sector-wide reforms, Al-Khatteeb is also a non-resident Fellow at the Center on Global Energy Policy (Columbia University-SIPA.) He has written articles and published reports for Foreign Affairs, The New York Times, Brookings Institution, Harvard University, Columbia University, The National Interest, The Huffington Post, Al-Monitor, CNN, MEES, the Petroleum-Economist and The National among many others. Previously, he served as honorary advisor to the Federal Parliament of Iraq on Energy and Economy. Between 2014 and 2016 he was a non-resident fellow at the Brookings Institute, where he focused on the geopolitics and political economy of the GCC and Iraq. During this time, he authored and co-authored multiple articles on oil and gas in Iraq, as well as regional politics, advocating balanced public and private sector participation in the energy sector. Al-Khatteeb has held a number of longstanding positions on energy in Iraq and the region, being an outspoken advocate of modern gas to power strategies, eliminating gas flaring and providing feedstock for power and linked industries, particularly in Iraq.  Early life  Luay al-Khatteeb was born in 1968 in Baghdad, the son of a respected Iraqi legal scholar, Hamid Jawad al-Khatteeb. His family have historically been close to the Holy Grand Marjiya of Najaf, Iraq's supreme religious authority, often playing advocacy roles for the Shia quietest clergy during Iraq's turbulent modern history. His grandfather Jawad-Khatteeb was subsequently honored by Grand Ayatullah sayid Muhsin al-Hakim on his passing in 1963; Ayatollah al-Hakim led prayers during his funeral.Jawad-Khatteeb was buried inside the Holy Shrine of Imam Ali, next to Grand Ayatullah Abu l-Hasan al-Isfahani. During the 1980s, Shia religious activists in Najaf were increasingly targeted by the Baath regime; as a result Luay al Khatteeb was sent by his family to seek refuge in the Kurdish region, where he lived with his sister until 1986. That year he returned to Baghdad to complete his education, where he remained until 26 June 1990. That year, political conditions finally convinced his family that it was no longer safe to remain in Iraq.  Career  Al-Khatteeb graduated in 1994 with a degree in business information technology from Kingston University, in London, England, later becoming a researcher on the Iraq Petroleum industry, Sustainable development, and Policy Formulation project at Salford University. Following the invasion of Iraq in 2004, he was asked by British-Dutch International Oil Company Shell to advise on the development of an exploration and production strategy for Iraq between 2004 and 2008, believing it to be a patriotic duty to help Iraq's oil sector recover from conflict. He would later go on to work at various roles assisting international oil companies to enter the Iraqi market. Returning to academia some years later, he would go on to receive a doctorate from Exeter University in political economy. Following a period of advisory work for the Iraqi Council of Representatives (COR) on energy strategy, Al Khatteeb was approved by COR on 24 October 2018 and sworn in as Minister of Electricity. Perceived as someone unconnected to the post 2003 political elite, Al-Khatteeb was selected for the portfolio as part of an informal agreement between political parties to form a \\"technocratic cabinet,\\" which would reduce political interference in government.  Minister of Electricity  During his time as Minister of Electricity, Al-Khatteeb expedited the completion of a number of vital power projects in Iraq's Sunni majority provinces that had been liberated from the Islamic State, as well as finalizing new projects in liberated areas, such as the Baiji power plant. In Basra, following the electricity crisis of 2018, Al-Khatteeb became known for rallying resources to ensure substations and critical work on grid maintenance and upgrading was ready for the summer of 2019, avoiding a serious crisis of electricity provision. On 30 April 2019, Al-Khatteeb signed an implementation agreement between Iraq's Ministry of Electricity and Siemens to pave the way for the full execution of the Iraq Roadmap, a series of power projects with a short, medium- and long-term scope of adding highly efficient power generation capacity to Iraq's ailing electricity sector. Three contracts were signed that included rehabilitation, upgrades of power generation plants, expansion of transmission and distribution networks with the first phase valued at EUR 700 million. The signing saw high level bilateral governmental support with Iraq's former Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi and Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel attending the event in Berlin. Under Al-Khateeb, Iraq's Ministry of Electricity developed a national roadmap that incorporated power projects by Siemens, GE, Chinese and international energy firms in addition to goals for implementing renewable energy projects. During his 18 months tenure, Iraq was at the final stages of finalising a mega deal with GE to rebuild the power grid in liberated areas and expand transmission in Western Iraq. The GE contract was worth $727 million with another $500 million contract where GE would bring 500 MW in gas-to-power streams in the provinces of Dhi Qar and Samawa. Later in August 2020, these contracts were officially concluded by his successors. In May 2019, Iraq invited interested companies to pre-qualify for 7 utility scale solar projects in five provinces. Al-Khatteeb's strategy was for renewable energy to provide 20% of the country's power mix by 2030. He abolished the previously repressive 3.5¬¢/kWh Feed-In-Tariff and levelled the playing field for international energy firms to bid on Independent Power Purchasing (PPP) basis. In September 2019, Al-Khatteeb signed a power interconnectivity agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council Interconnection Authority (GCCIA) to import electricity from Gulf nations. The first phase was to import 500 MW via Kuwait. Part of his strategy was to make Iraq an energy hub in the region as his administration entered negotiations with Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Turkey with the aim of diversifying Iraq's electricity imports and augment regional interconnectivity. Overall, under Al-Khatteeb's leadership, Iraq's Ministry of Electricity added approximately 3.5 GW in power capacity with the recorded peak supply increasing from 15.8 GW to 19.27 GW. In October 2019, the World Bank concluded that Iraq's non-oil sector improvement in 2019 was underpinned by better electricity production among other factors.

Manu—ól (Miha—ól) Kozaƒç√≠ns—åki–π; Yampil, then Imperial Russia, now Ukraine, 1699 ‚Äî Slutsk, Belarus, 15 August 1755) was a writer, pedagogue and theater worker. Biography Kozaƒçinski studied philosophy in Moscow until 1720, after which he continued his education on Kiev Theological Academy. During his studies in Kiev, he traveled across lands inhabited by Slavs and Germans. Once he got a degree, Kozaƒçinski started working as an associate at the Academy, teaching junior classes. On the invitation of metropolitan Vikentije Jovanoviƒá, Kozaƒçinski traveled from Kiev to Sremski Karlovci in 1733, accompanied with a group of professors. He started to work as a teacher of Slavic-Latin schools (Collegium slavono-latino carloviciense). During his tenure, schooling was largely improved and organized on the school system inventor during the era of Peter the Great. The first recorded theatrical performance, \\"The Death of Tsar Uro≈°\\", was presented in the school of Emanuel Kozaƒçinski in Karlovci. Written by Kozaƒçinski, it remained in manuscript and waited 62 years to reappear, then published and adapted by Jovan Rajiƒá, the author's disciple. The Baroque drama was Traedokomedija centered about the subject of the death of Stefan Uro≈° V, which was first performed in June 1734. The play was very popular and later performed in Novi Sad and Zrenjanin with rearrangement done by Jovan Rajiƒá. Emanuel Kozaƒçinski was a director of all schools in Sremski Karlovci during 1735-1736 and afterwards rector of all Slavic-Latin schools on the territory of Metropolitanate of Karlovci. His placement as the head of a network of schools was heavily criticized by priests and other Serbian Orthodox Church officials on account of Emanuel not being a member of the clergy, which forced Metropolitan Vikentije (Jovanoviƒá) to ordain him into the priesthood. Facing numerous plots and protests after the death of Vikentije, his protector, Emanuel went to Vienna. Later, he worked as a teacher in Novi Sad for a year before leaving for Kiev. Upon his return to Kiev, Emanuel was reinstalled as a professor at the Kiev Academy associated with the Pechersk Lavra monastery and he also started to work for a local theater company, writing a play Obraz strastej mira sego obrazom stra≈ædu≈°ƒçago Hrista ispravi sja, which he also directed in 1739. A noted professor of philosophy and theology, Kozaƒçinski served as a deputy of the Academy's rector Silvester Kuljapk. Emanuel was made the head of a welcome committee established in 1744 for the visit of Elizabeth of Russia, and for that purpose, he wrote several works in her honour including a play Blagoutrobija Marka Avrelija Antonina. Kozaƒçinski left the Academy in 1746 because of a dispute with staff members and went on to pursue his career as a cleric in Vydubychi Monastery. Emanuel Kozaƒçinski left numerous works: rhetoric, poetry and philosophy textbooks, songs, psalms, speeches, dramas. He is best known for his book on Aristotle, and also considered the best Aristotle scholar among Orthodox Christians of the era. He died of jaundice and was buried in Sluck.

He is a supervillain, and the evil counterpart and alternate version of Batman within the multiverse. He is depicted as a hybrid of both Batman (Bruce Wayne) and Batman's arch enemy Joker and is a member of the Dark Knights. His first appearance was in the crossover storyline Dark Nights: Metal, before receiving his own series and serving as the main antagonist in Batman/Superman in 2019 and DC Comics' Year of the Villain alongside Lex Luthor. He was created by Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo. Publication history The Batman Who Laughs was created by Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo first appearing in the comic book Dark Days: The Casting. The character was depicted as an alternate universe Batman who does not have a code against killing. Snyder explained his intent on the character in an interview by The Hollywood Reporter. \\"He's basically Batman's worst nightmare come to life: Batman, if he was infected by the Joker toxin and lost all sense of ethics. What he wants to do in Gotham is bring Bruce‚Äôs worst nightmares to life.\\" Snyder's hope was that his character would be popular enough to get his own comic book series, and Snyder believed that Jock \\"would be the perfect person to do it\\". Character biography The Batman Who Laughs is a version of Batman from Earth-22 of the Dark Multiverse. In that reality, the Earth -22 Joker learns of Batman's identity as Bruce Wayne and kills most of Batman's other rogues, along with Commissioner Gordon. He then subjects thousands of Gotham City‚Äôs citizens to the chemicals that transformed him, subsequently killing several parents in front of their children with the goal of turning them into a combination of himself and Batman. When Batman grapples with the Joker, it results in the latter's death as Batman is exposed to a purified form of the chemicals that gradually turn him into a new fusion of Batman and the Joker, one with Bruce Wayne's intelligence and physical strength and the Joker's psychopathy and warped, sadistic sense of humor. The process proves irreversible by the time Batman discovers what is happening to him. The Batman Who Laughs proceeds to take over Earth-22, killing off most of his allies and turning his son Damian Wayne into a mini-Joker and recruiting the children infected by the Joker Toxin as his \\"Rabid Robins\\". The Batman Who Laughs seems to be the leader or second-in- command of Barbatos' Dark Knights and recruits the other members. After arriving on Prime-Earth (Earth 0), the Batman Who Laughs takes control of Gotham and oversees events at the Challenger's mountain. He distributes joker cards to the Batman's Rogues, giving them the ability to alter reality and take over sections of the city.Teen Titans Vol. 6 #12. DC Comics. Accompanying him are Dark Damian and three Rabid Robins, having intended to destroy all of reality by linking the Over-Monitor to Anti-Monitor's astral brain. The Batman Who Laughs is defeated when the Prime Universe Batman is aided by the Joker, who notes the alternate Batman's failure to perceive this scenario due to still being a version of Batman.Dark Knights: Metal #6. DC Comics. While assumed dead, The Batman Who Laughs is revealed to be in the custody of Lex Luthor, who offers him a place in the Legion of Doom.Justice League Vol. 4 #7. DC Comics. At some point during the formation of the Legion of Doom, Joker met with Lex Luthor and advised him not to bring the Batman Who Laughs into the group. The Batman Who Laughs talks to Lex Luthor about the worlds beyond the Source Wall as Joker listens in. The Batman Who Laughs eventually resumes his attack on Batman, drawing in a string of alternate versions of Bruce Wayne to taunt his counterpart as he prepares for a mass assault on Batman. As an additional asset, the Batman Who Laughs is allied with the Grim Knight, a version of Batman who uses guns and turned his Gotham into a military dictatorship. With no other way to stop his other self, Batman is forced to 'accept' a twisted 'transfusion' from the Joker that begins to turn him into a variation of the Batman Who Laughs, attempting to fight it down while relying on the psychosis of the technically-treated James Gordon Jr. to try to predict his foe. When the Batman Who Laughs draws in a version of Bruce Wayne who has not even lost his parents yet, Batman is able to defeat his other self by luring him into a confrontation in the Waynes' graveyard, with Alfred subsequently using a transfusion from the other Bruce to restore Batman to normal before he is sent home and the Batman who Laughs is locked up in the Hall of Justice dungeon. However, his serums did manage to infect Shazam, Blue Beetle, Donna Troy, Hawkman, Supergirl and Commissioner Gordon, (the latter was infected during issue 7 of The Batman Who Laughs miniseries by Scott Snyder.) A year later, The Batman Who Laughs is still locked up in the Hall of Justice, but with the help of his new Secret Six he begins to set his plan in motion. He starts by having Commissioner Gordon lead Batman and Superman to the cave under Crime Alley where King Shazam will infect Superman. Later, Superman appears seemingly \\"infected\\" (with Batman listening in.) making their way to the Hall of Justice weapons room. The Batman Who Laughs tells Superman that he plans to infect the world with his serum. He then makes an off-handed comment to Clark that his plan will be like the destruction of Krypton and Lois and Jon won't survive. Superman attacks The Batman Who Laughs, seemingly blowing his cover. However, the whole thing was revealed to be an illusion by Batman, with The Batman Who Laughs praising him saying that he had a similar system on his own world. The Batman Who Laughs' next step is having Scarab (the infected Blue Beetle) hack the Fortress of Solitude and Batcave computers. As this is happening, he begins taunting Clark saying that they were all evil inside and that he will soon know, but as Superman is about to be infected Supergirl catches the tainted Batarang and is unwittingly infected (as the batarang was designed to infect Kryptonians.) As the Legion of Doom signal shines in the sky, The Batman Who Laughs muses to himself that he is on a collision course with Lex Luthor, but isn't too concerned because as he puts it, \\"Batman always wins.\\" In the Watchmen sequel, Doomsday Clock, the Batman Who Laughs is among the villains who are analyzed by Doctor Manhattan when Guy Gardner uses his power ring to show the constructs of villains that they have faced. Powers and abilities The Batman Who Laughs is depicted as having the same abilities as Batman, combined with the twisted nihilism of the Joker. This contributed to the reasons why Batman was forced to ally with the Joker to stop his counterpart, as he anticipated that his other self retained his existing tactical abilities and therefore an alliance between Batman and the Joker was the only thing his counterpart could never anticipate. Hailing from the Dark Multiverse, he is able to see people's dark urges and fears, visualized as alternate realities of their current actions. His characteristic metal crown functions as a futuristic visor made out of \\"Dark Metal\\", allowing him to filter these actions and pinpoint his opponents' next moves during combat and manipulate them psychologically by using his knowledge of their fears. Unlike Batman, he opts for lethal weapons that allows him to kill swiftly, including but not limited to machine guns, knives, a chain weapon with a batarang attached at the end and various assortment of bladed weapons. Like the inhabitants of the Dark Multiverse, The Batman Who Laughs has a weakness to Nth Metal. Reception The Batman Who Laughs has been commonly described as \\"horrifying\\" by website authors. Comic Book Resources describes The Batman Who Laughs as comprising all the \\"best\\" parts of Batman and the \\"worst\\" parts of the Joker. The character has been compared to Judge Death in design. Scott Snyder, the creator of The Batman Who Laughs, noted that the two characters have a similar aesthetic. In other media *In Mortal Kombat 11, The Batman Who Laughs was used as a DLC skin for Noob Saibot with the Elseworld Skin Pack exclusive to Kombat Pack owners upon the release of the Joker as DLC. *In DC Universe Online, The Batman Who Laughs is the primary antagonist in the Metal Part I episode. Through his machinations, the heroes are tricked into delivering special metal to his multiversal spire which begins to drag Earth into the Dark Multiverse. He returns in Metal Part II, attempts to Joker toxin bomb the Oblivion Bar with the assembled heroes inside, but was ultimately defeated along with the other Dark Knights and Barbatos in the Dark Multiverse. Merchandise Funko has released action figures of the character. Various figures from companies such as Diamond Select Toys and Prime 1 Studios have produced figures as well.

Her artwork documented the variety of plant species being preserved in Lee Memorial Park, a Works Progress Administration-funded wildflower and bird sanctuary in Petersburg, Virginia. Born Sarah Elizabeth Niemeyer on December 25, 1884, in Portsmouth, Virginia, Bessie Niemeyer married Myron Barrand Marshall, an Episcopalian priest, in 1907 and had nine children. After service in parishes in the Philippines and in Virginia, the family settled in Petersburg in 1937. In 1935, the city of Petersburg, using W.P.A. (Women's and Professional Division) funds, authorized the creation of a 25-acre wildflower sanctuary in Lee Memorial Park. Under the direction of Petersburg Garden Club member Mary Donald Claiborne Holden, African American women labored on the project through 1940, clearing ravines, building ten miles of paths, and planting 365,00 plants, including 8,000 trees and 37,000 shrubs and more than one million honeysuckle roots to prevent erosion. In 1937, Holden hired Marshall to paint watercolors of the dried and pressed plant specimens of Lee Park flora. A self-taught artist, Marshall produced 238 watercolors of the Lee Park herbarium specimens; the paintings and 325 specimens were stored together in fourteen brown scrapbooks, ultimately housed for almost fifty years in the Petersburg Public Library. The collection was rediscovered by the Petersburg Garden Club in the 1990s. Although she pursued other illustration assignments, Marshall had no other major commissions. She died on February 14, 1960 in Portsmouth, Virginia. Lee Memorial Park is now on the National Register of Historic Places.

It is named after the novella \\"Bahnw√§rter Thiel\\" by German author Gerhart Hauptmann. Description The venue consists of repurposed intermodal containers, a temporary pavilion formerly used by the Lenbachhaus, as well as decommissioned subway cars. It hosts club nights and outdoor raves, lectures, exhibitions, improvisational theatre, concerts, and flea markets. History Bahnw√§rter Thiel at the Viehhof location in 2017  Origins and first sites  Daniel Hahn founded Bahnw√§rter-Kulturst√§tten in 2015, and Bahnw√§rter Thiel opened in the same year. The concept featured a withdrawn MAN Schienenbus railbus, repurposed as a culture venue on the grounds of the former \\"Viehhof\\" (Slaughterhouse) in Munich. The railbus was first used as part of the alternative christmas market \\"M√§rchenbazar\\" in November 2015. In May 2016, the railbus was moved to the grounds of the University of Television and Film Munich for summer 2016. It was moved back to the Viehhof area in October, where a wide and high structure of 54 shipping containers was built for sound- and weatherproofing. In May 2017, the railbus once again was moved to the University of Television and Film, this time being rebranded as \\"Minna Thiel\\", named after the wife of the protagonist of the novel \\"Bahnw√§rter Thiel\\" by Gerhart Hauptmann.  Viehbahnhof location  After a five-year lease-agreement was reached, the Bahnw√§rter Thiel venue permanently moved to the Viehhof in late 2017. The new location is on the former freight station of the Viehhof, the so-called Viehbahnhof, about 400 meters away from its previous location there. The concept for the new location includes ateliers, workspaces and workshops, as well as band practice rooms, part of which will be located in some of the repurposed containers. This location on the Viehhof area sparked a debate about gentrification and spaces for subculture in Munich, as parts of the local graffiti scene feared that they might lose the last space in Munich where spraying graffiti was allowed and legal. Hahn has stated that it was always intended to include graffiti on the project and also wants to integrate the scene in the decoration of the venue. A wooden wall with a length of was constructed as a designated space for graffiti. The construction was organized by Bahnw√§rter Thiel staff, parts of the graffiti scene, and the City of Munich. Artists feared that the wooden wall might be used to prevent sprayers from entering the premises. In May 2018, there was an arson attack on the venue, resulting in a wooden shed burning down. A withdrawn Munich U-Bahn car was moved to the Bahnw√§rter Thiel in early 2018. Two more U-Bahn cars followed in October 2018. It is planned to use one of the cars as a cafeteria, and the other as a workspace. In May 2019 an old decommissioned tram from 1967 that was found in Ulm was brought to the Bahnw√§rter Thiel. It is planned to use the tram as a youth center and for holding art workshops.  Future development  The lease for the Viehhof area ends in 2022. The redevelopment of the Viehhof has already begun, with the construction of the new M√ºnchner Volkstheater, which is scheduled to be completed in 2021. The city of Munich also plans to build apartments on parts of the area. Reception The New York Times citet Bahnw√§rter Thiel as an example of hip night life spots in Munich \\"that could give Berlin a run for its money\\". At the Munich Nightlife Awards, Bahnw√§rter Thiel was awarded the 3rd place in the category techno/house/electro in 2016, and the winner in the category ambience/scenery in 2017. Associated Projects Since 2018, the Bahnw√§rter Thiel crew also operates the party ship Alte Utting, a former passenger ship from the Ammersee lake that is now crossing an inner-city arterial road on a railway bridge in Munich, and received a lot of media attention as well.

He designed more than 35 sizable houses in those two towns and several in nearby communities. Home of John C. Hammond, 222 Elm Street, Northampton, 1891/94 His early house designs, mostly in the Queen Anne style, centered on Amherst. From 1893 to 1897 Putnam was in partnership with Lewis D. Bayley, and their firm, Putnam & Bayley, operated from an office in Northampton. The focus of the firm‚Äôs residential work shifted to Northampton and tended toward the Classical Revival and Colonial Revival styles. The firm undertook several commercial buildings, notably the Masonic Block in Northampton, the most expensive building yet to have been constructed in the downtown area. The firm‚Äôs work encompassed civic structures as well. Putnam or his firm also designed three public libraries in towns around the Pioneer Valley. Following the dissolution of the firm, Putnam continued his architectural practice in Northampton, though at a slower pace, until his death on April 16, 1911. He designed a number of school buildings and renovated still other schools in towns throughout Hampshire County, Massachusetts.  Early Years and Schooling  Roswell Field Putnam was born in Leverett, Massachusetts, on 20 May 1840, the son of a farmer, Timothy Putnam, and his wife, Sarah Field (Bangs) Putnam. He was apparently named after Roswell Field (1767-1842), a magistrate and trial justice for Franklin County, Massachusetts, who represented the town of Leverett in the state legislature for many years. Timothy Putnam took care of Roswell Field and his wife, Sarah Graves Field, in their later years; when he died in 1842, Field bequeathed his property to Timothy and his household goods and a thousand dollars to Sarah Putnam. In 1844, possibly on the strength of this inheritance, Timothy Putnam acquired a farm on Long Plain in Leverett, near the junction with Depot Road, together with a Greek Revival farmhouse for himself, his wife, and his four-year-old son. In 1852 he built a schoolhouse on the northwest corner of his property, which still stands at 159 Long Plain Road, although the Putnams‚Äô house at #153 was destroyed by fire. Roswell would have been twelve at the time of the schoolhouse construction, and this project may have sparked his interest in becoming an architect. Roswell Field Putnam initially attended not this school (which met in a private home across the road before the schoolhouse was built), but rather Leverett‚Äôs Center School, the ‚ÄúLittle Red Schoolhouse‚Äù near the town center. As he grew older, he attended the Amherst Academy, a private school in Amherst, and then the Powers Institute in Bernardston, Massachusetts, which had opened in 1855. Although Putnam appears to have had no formal education beyond high school, the Daily Hampshire Gazette, 18 October 1893, p. 2, reported that ‚Äúhe has always been a close student and probably has the finest library outside of New York City.‚Äù  Professional Training and Early Work  Roswell would have completed his studies at the Powers Institute around 1856 to 1858. He registered (as a farmer) for the Civil War draft in 1863, but there is no indication that he served; his registry entry bears the notation, ‚Äúvery near-sighted.‚Äù Little is known of his life‚Äôs course between the end of school and the early 1880s. He is identified as a farmer in the 1855 state census. No occupation is given in the 1860 U.S. Census, which shows him living with his parents in Leverett. He is still recorded living with them in the 1870 and 1880 U.S. Census; in 1870 he styled himself an architect, and in 1880, a carpenter. Roswell‚Äôs earliest architectural venture may have been a store in Leverett that he designed for Payson Field in 1867, on the west side of the tracks just north of the railroad station, which had been built on Long Plain in 1865. This store functioned until the 1890s, when it was moved to a site on the east side of Shutesbury Road, just north of Mountain Brook, for use as a residence.  Putnam as Carpenter  According to his obituaries, Roswell learned the carpentry trade in Amherst and trained as an architect in Worcester, Massachusetts, under James Fuller. He may also have trained under an architect in Boston, although his name does not appear in Boston city directories. The sequence and timing of these ventures is not clear. He is listed (in Leverett) under ‚ÄúCarpenters and Builders‚Äù in the Massachusetts Register and Business Directory of 1874. Among the carpenters and builders active in Amherst in the 1870s were Chauncey Lessey and John Beston, Jr. Putnam later designed houses on behalf of both their widows, as well as one for carpenter James White, indicating possible personal connections that may relate to his training in carpentry. There was no standardized training, examination, or license required in Massachusetts to become a carpenter or architect at the time. One learned on the job, through apprenticeship--formal or informal.  Putnam‚Äôs Training as Architect  It was probably in the latter half of the 1870s that Putnam undertook training for the architectural profession. The customary path to becoming an architect in the U.S. in this period was to spend time as an apprentice in an architectural office, learning at the elbow of an established practitioner. Formal courses in architecture were not instituted until later in the century. The distinction between builder and architect was not always clear cut, but from the records that survive from 1883 onward, it appears that once Putnam established himself as ‚Äúarchitect‚Äù in Amherst, he employed others as builders, contractors, or specialized craftsmen and did not pick up a hammer himself. According to the Daily Hampshire Gazette, Putnam learned architecture from James E. Fuller of Worcester, Massachusetts. Born in 1836, Fuller had already been a master-builder and a contractor in Athol, Massachusetts, though he was only 29 when he came to Worcester. In 1866 Fuller formed a partnership with Stephen C. Earle in Worcester, and the firm later opened an office in Boston as well. The partnership lasted 10 years. ‚ÄúThough it is impossible to distinguish exactly the separate contributions of Earle and Fuller to their partnership, it appears that Earle was the designer, Fuller the builder,‚Äù according to Curtis Dahl, whose monograph on Earle is the most complete study of the architect. Dahl further posits that the Boston office was opened only to be able to attract inexpensive draftsmen, but that the heart of the firm‚Äôs work was in Worcester. The firm‚Äôs bread-and-butter work was designing stone churches in a Richardsonian Romanesque/Gothic idiom, although they did residential and commercial buildings as well. After Fuller parted from Earle, he partnered in 1878 with Ward P. Delano to form the firm Fuller & Delano, which for more than two decades was one of the most successful firms in Worcester. The latter firm‚Äôs practice seems to have been geared toward institutional buildings (schools, hospitals, libraries and firehouses), with relatively few residential commissions.  Buildings in Amherst 1883-1893  On 9 May 1882 Roswell Putnam married Sarah P. Scott, a native of Hawley, Massachusetts, a schoolteacher who had been a boarder at his parents‚Äô home, where Roswell was living. She was about 13 years his junior. A year later, the couple had a son whom they named Karl Scott Putnam. Sarah died in June 1884. At about this time, Putnam, still residing with his parents in Leverett, seems to have established himself as a professional architect and begun taking commissions in Amherst. He designed a house for B. H. Williams in 1883 (no longer extant; photo in the Jones Library Special Collections, Amherst). Two documents preserved at the Jones Library, executed in September and December 1884, are agreements with John Beston, Jr., a contractor, to build homes in Amherst according to plans drawn up by R. F. Putnam, Architect. One of these, at 24 North Prospect Street, was contracted for by the estate of Mrs. C. W. Lessey and completed in 1885; the other, at 22 Seelye Street, was contracted for by George S. Kendrick. Putnam‚Äôs practice in the 1880s and early 1890s was primarily in Amherst, designing inventive Queen Anne cross-gabled houses, many in the Shingle Style, for the town‚Äôs merchants and faculty members. The John C. Hammond house, at 222 Elm Street in Northampton (1891-94), is considered by many the apogee of his work in this style. Although he was the initial unanimous choice of the committee formed to recommend an architect for Amherst‚Äôs Town Hall, he did not win the commission. He did, however, design the North Amherst Library, which opened in 1893. Putnam & Bayley, North Amherst Library, 1893  Putnam & Bayley, 1893-1897  In 1893 Roswell Putnam formed a partnership with Lewis D. Bayley, an architect from Louisville, Kentucky. The firm Putnam & Bayley opened an office at 160 Main Street, Northampton, in the Columbian Building. ‚ÄúThe people of this vicinity who contemplate building will not find it necessary to send away for their architectural work,‚Äù the local paper crowed, ‚Äúas we now have a firm of architects here that are second to none in the country as to experience and ability.‚Äù The article continues, ‚ÄúAlthough having been located here but three months they have over $75,000 worth of buildings in course of erection.‚Äù In 1896 the firm‚Äôs offices were moved into Northampton‚Äôs Lambie Block. Its houses, mostly in Northampton, became more Classical/Colonial Revival in style and symmetrical in design as the decade rolled on, but they still retained many Queen Anne features. Roswell Putnam was married for a second time in 1895, to Mrs. Anna Field of Springfield, a 52-year-old widow from Leverett with three adult sons. Roswell‚Äôs son Karl would have been twelve at the time, presumably still living at home. Roswell Putnam built a new house for the family at 19 Columbus Avenue in Northampton. Forming a firm led to a dramatic increase in the number of jobs undertaken, as well as to broadening the scope of work beyond what Putnam had done on his own. In addition to pursuing residential work, the firm undertook several commercial building projects‚Äîrepairs to the McCallum Block and rebuilding of the Lambie Block in Northampton, Putnam & Bayley, Lambie Block, Northampton, 1895-96 and construction of a brick block at Maple and Cottage Streets in Easthampton, Massachusetts. They designed a new plumbing scheme for the Northampton City Hall, an addition to the Nonotuck Silk Company in Florence (a suburb of Northampton), a school in Easthampton, and the Meekins Library in Williamsburg, as well as projects in Buckland and South Deerfield, all towns in Western Massachusetts. Putnam & Bayley‚Äôs most significant undertaking was the Masonic Block at 25 Main Street in Northampton, which opened in 1898. A profile of the firm in the Daily Hampshire Gazette supplement of 30 November 1895 lists 18 clients in Northampton and vicinity for whom it had done work in the past two years, ‚Äúbesides about 25 residences in Springfield, Amherst, Gilbertville, Holyoke, Enfield, Hatfield, Newton, Medford, Mass., Chicago, Ill., Louisville, Ky., and Hot Springs, Ark.‚Äù The non-Massachusetts projects on this list were likely undertakings begun by Bayley and completed after the firm was formed. There is no indication that Roswell Putnam ever worked outside Massachusetts, whereas Bayley had quite a peripatetic career.  Putnam‚Äôs Work After the Firm‚Äôs Dissolution (1897-1911)  As the Masonic Building was nearing completion, the partnership ended. A heated exchange of letters in the Daily Hampshire Gazette about which of the partners deserved credit for the Masonic Building probably reflects the conflict that caused the rift. Bayley moved on to Hartford, Connecticut, while Putnam continued to build in both Amherst and Northampton. He also designed the Shutesbury library, given to the town by M.N. Spear, and worked on new buildings and improvements for schools in Amherst, Easthampton, Leeds and Northampton. Roswell‚Äôs son, Karl Scott Putnam (1883-1965), also became an architect, earning a B.S. degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1910 and interning in the New York office of Edward Tilton. He is listed as a draftsman in his father‚Äôs office in the City Directory of Northampton in 1910. The firm was called R. Putnam & Son beginning in 1911. Karl Putnam taught architecture at Smith College from 1930 onward, and his papers are in Smith‚Äôs archives. Although he and the firms to which he belonged designed many private houses, college buildings, and institutional structures in Northampton, Amherst and surrounding towns, Karl Putnam‚Äôs papers reveal no buildings on which father and son collaborated. Roswell Putnam died on 16 April 1911, less than a year after his son‚Äôs graduation. Karl Putnam‚Äôs earliest buildings in Northampton appear to date from 1911. Roswell‚Äôs obituary states that ‚ÄúMr. Putnam was of a quiet and retiring nature, but a man pleasant to meet, ever ready to converse with anyone on business connected with his profession in which he took a great pride. He was conscientious in the work he did and as a citizen was interested in whatever was for the good of the community, but never desired to hold any public office. He belonged to the various Masonic orders, which included the Northampton commandery of Knights Templar.‚Äù  Chronology of Buildings (all are in Massachusetts towns)  The most comprehensive compilation of photographs of Putnam's buildings is Suzannah J. Fabing, Roswell Field Putnam (1840-1911): Versatile Architect for the Pioneer Valley (Amherst, MA: Privately published, 2020), copies of which can be found at the main public library in each of the towns in which Putnam or his firm designed a building. Many of the buildings listed below are described, with photographs, in the Massachusetts Historical Commission's database, online at http://mhc- macris.net. The MHC numbers are included in parentheses in the listings below. Note that not all these records identify Putnam as the architect. Other frequently cited sources include the newspapers Amherst Bulletin, Amherst, Massachusetts; Daily Hampshire Gazette, Northampton, Massachusetts; and Springfield Republican, Springfield, Massachusetts. Springfield Republican archives, on microfilm, may be searched for a fee at The Republican - MassLive.comIts year-end surveys of new construction in the region establish date, owner, and cost but ordinarily do not identify the architect.

(AMH.242).Assignment to Putnam is based on the plan, which is nearly identical to the documented house at 30 Orchard Street. * 1885/6 90 Spring St., Amherst ‚ÄúThe Dell,‚Äù home of Mabel and David P. Todd. (AMH.517)Mabel Loomis Todd‚Äôs and David Peck Todd‚Äôs diaries, letters and papers, in the Sterling Memorial Library at Yale University, detail several interchanges with Putnam during the planning and building of their home, which they called ‚ÄúThe Dell.‚Äù See especially Mrs. Todd‚Äôs diary entries for 2, 11, 16 and 26 January 1886, 20 and 24 February and 11,12 and 24 March of the same year, and a letter from her to Austin Dickinson of 10 June 1887, asking him to make sure that Mr. Putnam is paid. Prof. Todd records payments to Putnam and various contractors and builders; draft specifications are among his records at Yale (D.P. Todd 496B, Series VI, Box 107, folder 36 ‚ÄúThe Dell‚Äù). *1887 122 North Pleasant St., Amherst Home of Edward D. Bangs (AMH.239) * 1888 105 Montague Road, Amherst House commissioned by Stephen Puffer for his son, Eugene Puffer (AMH.20)Former owner Patricia G. Holland has documentation of Putnam's authorship. * 1888 194 Amity St., Amherst Home of Prof. Charles Wellington (AMH.262) * 1889 10-14 South Prospect St., Amherst Tenement commissioned by Charles Deuel (destroyed 2000)(AMH.477) Photographs are in the Building Department of the Town of Amherst. * 1889 56 Congress St., Milford Home of Edwin Thomas (MIL.2320 * 1890 38 North Prospect St., Amherst Home of Edwin D. Marsh (AMH.1078) * 1891/4 222 Elm St., Northampton Home of John C. Hammond (NTH.480)This house is cited in ‚ÄúPutnam & Bayley,‚Äù Daily Hampshire Gazette Supplement, 30 November 1895, as Putnam‚Äôs design, a work in progress ‚Äúwhich will be the finest private residence in this city when completed.‚Äù * 1892/4 91 Sunset Ave., Amherst ‚ÄúAllbreeze,‚Äù home of Edward W. Carpenter (AMH.1512)This house is thoroughly documented in the Special Collections of the Jones Library, Amherst, which holds specifications, plans, correspondence, and the account books of the owner, Edward Carpenter. The Carpenters admired a house in Portland, Maine, which was published in Scientific American‚Äôs Architects and Builders Edition of March 1892, pp. 34 and 40. They asked Putnam to adapt its design to their property, which he did, making minor modifications. * 1892/3 30 Orchard St., Amherst Home of Herbert T. Cowles (AMH.299)Documentation of this house, including plans and specifications that identify Roswell Putnam as the architect, are in the Jones Library Special Collections, Amherst. The house had only been occupied by two families until 2016. Katherine Cowles, whose parents had it built, lived in the house until 1977. She recorded, in notes in the Jones Library, that her mother told her that the house is patterned after 38 North Prospect Street. In its imaginative combination of Shingle Style motifs, this house displays greater sophistication than 38 N. Prospect or 87 N. Pleasant, showing Putnam‚Äôs growing maturity as an architect and perhaps his client‚Äôs more open purse.  By Putnam & Bayley, 1893-1897  * 1893 8 Montague Road, North Amherst North Amherst Library (AMH.66)See note 11. * By 1893 64 Elm St., Northampton Home of Dr. Charles W. Cooper (destroyed 1910)This house later became the property of Smith College and was torn down for construction of John M. Greene Auditorium in 1910. A photograph is preserved in the college's Archives. * 1894 183 East Pleasant St., Amherst Home of William T. Chapin (moved from 57 N. Pleasant St., 1980) (AMH.728)Plans stamped Putnam & Bayley are in the Special Collections, Jones Library, Amherst, along with an unpublished paper of 1980 by Evelyn Ward, describing this and another house Putnam designed for the Chapin family, known as the Chapin-Ward House. See also \\"The Building Growth,\\" Springfield Republican, 29 December 1894, p. 11. * 1894 75 New South St., Northampton Home of Dr. George D. Thayer * 1894 36 Butler Pl., Northampton Home of Leo H. Porter (NTH.2094)The house is in the Pomeroy Terrace Historic District, admitted to the National Register of Historic Places in 2018. See the registration form, section 7, p. 21, and section 8, p. 37. * 1894 27 Crescent, Northampton Home of Rev. Rufus Underwood (NTH.596)Nearby at 5 Crescent Street, Rev. Underwood had built a smaller house around 1892 (NTH.596). Bearing many similarities to the Todd house in Amherst and other Putnam designs, it is a potential candidate for Putnam's authorship. * 1894 50 Phillips Pl., Northampton Home of J.W. Reid (NTH.2080) * 1894 Round Hill, Northampton Recitation hall, Clarke InstitutionPassing mention of this unidentified building is made in a Daily Hampshire Gazette article about the firm's careful cost estimating, 24 August 1895. \\"The Building Growth\\" [n. 35 above] describes a substantial brick and stone \\"hall for recitation purposes, costing $10,000\\" built at the Clarke Institution in 1894. A school for the deaf founded in 1867, the Clarke Institution expanded after buying 12 acres of land on Round Hill in 1870. * 1894 63 Dryads‚Äô Green, Northampton Home of Adeline Moffat (NTH.567).The Daily Hampshire Gazette Supplement [n. 33] lists Robert Wier [sic] as one of the firm's clients, probably Randolph R. B. Weir, whose name appears on this plot, along with that of his aunt, Adeline Moffat, in the 1895 Atlas of the City of Northampton (Philadelphia: D.L. Miller). \\"The Building Growth\\" [n. 29] correctly identifies Moffat as the owner. The house was later acquired by Smith College, modified in plan and stripped of much of its interior architectural detail. The college sold it in spring 2018. * 1895 12 Bedford Terrace, Northampton Home of Chas. N. Fitts/Mrs. R.A. Depew (NTH.690) * 1895 155 South St., Northampton Home of Martha A. Strong (NTH.2190) * 1895 34 Harrison, Northampton Home of Caroline Thompson (NTH.539) * 1895 53 Harrison, Northampton Home of Edwin B. and Mary Emerson (NTH.529) * 1895 210 Main St., Northampton Plumbing, City Hall (NTH.790) *1895 Florence (296 Nonotuck St.?) Nonotuck Silk Co. addition (NTH.233) *1895 150 Main St., Northampton Repairs to McCallum Block (NTH.2291)The repairs followed a fire. \\"McCallum Wastes No Time,\\" Daily Hampshire Gazette, 20 July 1895 [p. 2], describes the work to be done and the damage to drawings for other projects underway at the architects' office in the adjacent Columbian Building. It mentions that the firm employed three draftsmen. See also \\"Northampton,\\" Springfield Republican, 2 August 1895, p. 6. *1895 1-5 State St., Buckland Reconstruction of Odd Fellows Hall (BUC.153)This work, too, followed a fire. The Palladian windows on the upper floor and the elaborate cornice appear to have been additions by Putnam & Bayley. See Fannie Shaw Kendrick, History of Buckland, Vol. 1 (Town of Buckland: 1937), pp. 210, 245. Since Lewis Bayley was a member of the I.O.O.F. and had designed two halls for the order in Illinois, he may have taken the lead on this project. *1895/6 76-88 Main St., Northampton Lambie Block (NTH.2414)\\"About Lambie's Block,\\" Daily Hampshire Gazette, 4 September 1895, called it \\"the most modern building in the city.\\" \\"Estimate for Building,\\" Daily Hampshire Gazette, 24 August 1895, praised the firm for bringing in bids under the initial cost estimate. \\"Five-Story Block to be Erected,\\" Springfield Republican, 26 June 1895, p. 5, announced the project, and, under \\"Northampton\\" on 28 December of that year, p. 5, the same paper characterized it as the largest single business block in the city. They published details of the elevator and its fireproofing on 17 March 1896, p. 8. On 31 July 1896, p. 6, the Springfield paper reported that the Putnam & Bayley firm had moved into the building. *1895/6 19 Columbus Ave., Northampton Home of Roswell F. Putnam (NTH.1047)Although it bears the firm's name, Putnam undoubtedly took the lead in designing this home for himself and his family. Despite the date 1895 prominently displayed on its facade, and its listing as one of the year's building projects in \\"Average Prosperity\\" [ n. 42], the family took occupancy the following May (\\"City Items,\\" Daily Hampshire Gazette, 22 May 1896.) The design suggests Putnam's familiarity with the early work of Frank Lloyd Wright, which he may have known through architectural journals. *1895/7 2 Williams St., Williamsburg Meekins Library (WLM.19)Extensive records are preserved at the library itself. *1895/7 7 Chapel St., Easthampton Maple Street School (EAH.347)\\"Our new and modern Maple Street building is proving all that was expected...The moral effect of a large, well ventilated, well lighted room upon the pupils is great, and the arrangement of the building admits of systematic and orderly movements of the schools under one head,\\" stated Easthampton's annual report of 1897. The original eight-room building was doubled in size in 1924 and was still in use in 2018, although a replacement is planned. *1896 23 Dryads' Green, Northampton Renovations, home of George W. Cable (NTH.576) *1896 12 East St., Northampton Home of John H. Maloney (NTH. 1029) *1896 71-77 Cottage St., Easthampton Moriarty & Griffin commercial block *1896/7 216 Lincoln Ave., Amherst Home of Mary Beston (AMH.174) *1896/9 10 Elm St., South Deerfield Grand Army Building *1897/8 25 Main St., Northampton Masonic Block (NTH.2059)This imposing four-story building with Augustan Revival detailing was the most elaborate and expensive structure to have been constructed in Northampton at the time. Discovery of unstable soil on the site (\\"quicksand,\\" in the parlance of the local press) added to the complexity of construction. See \\"Quick Sand to Overcome,\\" Daily Hampshire Gazette, 17 September 1896, and \\"The Masonic Ball. The Building,\\" Daily Hampshire Gazette, 17 February 1898 [pp. 1 ff.]. For the dispute over which partner designed the building, see notes 14-16 above.  By Putnam, after the dissolution of Putnam & Bayley  * 1898 95 Round Hill Rd., Northampton Home of Dr. Albert and Katherine Minshall (NTH.361) * c.1899 39 Harrison Ave., Northampton Home of Warren King (attributed) (NTH.527)The MACRIS database attributes this house to Putnam on the basis of his other work on this fashionable new street. No house appears on this lot in the 1895 D. L. Miller Atlas of the City of Northampton. Banker Warren M. King took up his job in Northampton in 1899 and is recorded living at this address in the 1900 U.S. Census. * 1900 93 Prospect St., Northampton House for Helen French Collins (NTH.598)\\"Northampton,‚Äù Springfield Republican, 16 March 1900, p. 8, reported that Putnam was designing four houses for Mrs. H. C. Collins, to be built at the corner of Prospect and Summer streets. They were to cost $4500 each, and two older houses would be torn down to accommodate the new ones. \\"Hampshire County's Record,\\" Springfield Republican, 31 December 1900, p. 5, recorded that Mrs. Collins had built one house on Prospect Street, with three more to come. No additional houses for this owner are mentioned in subsequent year-end architectural surveys, and none except this one appears on the 1917 Sanborn map; apparently the entire scheme was not realized. * 1900 Merchant‚Äôs Row Amherst Addition to Jackson & Cutler store\\"Amherst,‚Äù Springfield Republican, 28 April 1900, identifies Putnam as the architect for a large three-story brick addition to the rear of the Jackson & Cutler store on Merchant‚Äôs Row. Today this is the back portion of A. J. Hastings Stationers, at 45 South Pleasant Street. * 1900 off Fomer Rd., Southampton Improvements, E.H. Bell house (destroyed 1931)Edward H. Bell and his wife Josephine (Searl[e]) moved their principal residence from Northampton to Southampton in 1900, when he retired. Josephine's father, Wharton, inherited the farmstead from his father, Israel Searl. The house was torn down in 1931. * 1901 South East St., South Amherst South East School-House (no longer extant) * 1901 1001 South East St., South Amherst South Amherst Green School-House (AMH.619)Whereas the South East Street school closed in 1905 because of low enrollment, the South Amherst Green School was enlarged in 1953-54 and until 2018 served as Summit Academy, a special education school in the Amherst public school system. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on 2 February 1995. * 1902 72 High St., Southampton Home of Edward Swasey (STH.30) * 1902 48 Parsons St., Easthampton Parsons Street Schoolhouse (EAH.633)In 2004 the building was converted to residential apartments. * 1902 10 Cooleyville Rd., Shutesbury M.N. Spear Library (SHU.9)In addition to the library and school projects, Putnam's civic design output in 1902 included a rendering of a hypothetical new city hall for Northampton. Captioned \\"Suggestive Design for New City Hall by R. F. Putnam, Architect,\\" it illustrated an article by City Clerk Egbert I. Clapp, \\"A New City Hall--Why?\\", in Northampton of Today (Northamption: Picturesque Publishing Co., 1902), p. 61. * 1902 84-88 Main St., Northampton Clarke Block reconstruction (destroyed)The building had burned in a dramatic fire on 12 March 1902. It was damaged in another fire on 21 November 1927 and torn down after a fire on New Year's Day 1955. * 1902-03 75 Harrison Ave., Northampton Home of Charles W. Spear (attributed) (NTH.530)The MACRIS database attributes the house to Putnam on the basis of his other work on the street. * 1903 32 Gray St., Amherst Second house for William T. Chapin (moved from N. Pleasant St., 2000)(AMH.193)It is known as the Chapin-Ward house to distinguish it from the earlier one Putnam designed for Chapin [n.35 above]. Originally located at 53 North Pleasant Street, it was moved in 2000 to free land for Kendrick Park. Plans, architectural detail drawings, and some specifications are in the Special Collections of the Jones Library, Amherst, along with an unpublished paper by Evelyn Ward (1980), who grew up in the house. * 1903 45 Elm St., Northampton Addition to Burnham houseOriginally part of the Burnham-Capen School, the building is now Chase House dormitory at Smith College. * 1904 170 South St., Northampton Home of Frank Clapp (attributed) (NTH.1046) * 1905 Fair St., Northampton Hall for Three-County Agricultural Society (no longer extant) * 1906 Leeds Improvements, school-houses\\"Report of School Committee,\\" Annual Reports of Officers, City of Northampton for year ending 30 November 1906, pp. 127 and 146. * 1906 Bridge St., Northampton Modifications, plumbing, Bridge- Street School * 1907 28 Columbus Ave., Northampton Home of Myron C. Bailey (NTH.1037)A photograph of this house, with caption identifying the architect as R. J. [sic] Putnam, appears on p. 15 of the 25th Anniversary edition of the Northampton Daily Herald, n.d. [1908?]. Putnam lived virtually across the street, at 19 Columbus Avenue [n. 48 above]. Page 30 in the same issue has profile of the house‚Äôs owner, M. C. Bailey, contractor and builder. It reports, ‚ÄúHis recently built and imposing new residence, one of the handsomest properties in the city, is on Columbus Avenue. This house has much beauty of design and the interior is specially attractive, being finished in hardwood.‚Äù This commemorative issue, which profiled many prominent establishments and individuals in the town, did not feature Roswell Putnam or even capture his name accurately. By 1908 his star had dimmed. * 1907 186 Bridge Street, Northampton Home of George R. Turner (NTH.396)The Springfield Republican apparently erroneously reported on 30 January 1907, p. 9, that Putnam had drawn plans for an 8-room house on Orchard street [Northampton] which ‚ÄúG. R. Turner will build.‚Äù In fact, Turner was already living at 15 Orchard Street at that time; his new house, completed in 1907 for $3000, was built at 186 Bridge Street, around the corner. City directories confirm Turner's move to the Bridge Street address in 1907. Frank W. Twiss, whom the MACRIS record mistakenly identifies as the first owner, did not move in until 1913. * 1910 Sanderson Academy, Ashfield Remodeling (destroyed 1939) * 1910 260 Lincoln Ave., Amherst Home of Ernest M. Bolles (AMH.176)It is possible that a tiled fireplace design of Putnam‚Äôs, published in The Brickbuilder: an Architectural Monthly, vol. 18: no. 1 (January 1909), p. 18, pl. 14, also relates to this house or to the Turner or Bailey houses of 1907. Identified as ‚ÄúPanel for Library Fireplace,‚Äù it was said to have been executed by the Hartford Faience Company.

The society's New Generation Group is the main vehicle for this engagement through exchange visits and events in both countries. The society retains strong links with academic institutions in the UK and Oman e.g. the Sultan Qaboos University, St Antony's College, Oxford and the University of Exeter to name but a few. The society also maintains close relations with other friendship groups that have members who have spent time in the Sultanate, e.g. the Sultan's Armed Forces Association.

Its historical importance is emphasized by the very name for Cambodian classical music, pin-peat (Khmer: ·ûñ·û∑·ûé·ûñ·û∂·ûë·üí). After the pin was no longer being used, Cambodians continued to use the instrument's name for classical music into the present era. When the pin was no longer being used, the tonal range of other instruments was expanded, possibly to compensate. Burmese saung gauk and roneats had more keys for the chromatic scale and the number of gongs in the kong von thom and kong toch \\"more than doubled in number since the musician depicted on the Angkorian carvings.\\"  Etymology  The word pin (·ûñ·û∑·ûé) derived from Sanskrit word veena/ vina (‡§µ‡•Ä‡§£‡§æ). This musical instrument gave the name to Cambodian traditional musical ensemble known as pinpeat.  History  7th century Khmer depiction of harp (pin). National Museum of Cambodia The pin may have been introduced to Cambodia since Funan period; however, the earliest surviving depiction of the pin in Cambodia is dated to the 7th century on the temple at Sambor Prey Kuk, the capital of Chenla. The instrument appeared in Hindu religious art in Khmer temples dating back between the 7th and 13th centuries A.D. The instrument was recorded in a bas-relief at Bayon, Cambodia, a Buddhist temple built in the 12th to 13th century A.D. During the Angkor era from the 9th to the 14th centuries A.D., it was still being played in the royal Khmer ensemble. Reasons for its loss are theory. \\"One idea is that the instrument disappeared because of the development of the melodic percussion orchestra.\\" Another is that the instrument was lost in 1431 during the war that demolished the Angkor civilization. Another is that it was associated with Hindu religion and as the country became Buddhist, it left the instrument behind with the old religion.  Recreation of Historical Khmer Harp  Ethnomusicologist Patrick Kersal√©, who has worked in Asia for more than 20 years, studied images left over from the past, \\"tracing out the shape of the harp.\\" He looked for clues to understand how the harps were used and made. He also looked at similar instruments in the region, such as the Burmese saung gauk and harps of the Kareni people. Kersal√© asked Keo Sonan Kavei (a craftsman) to help him build the harp. To help the instrument become part of active culture again, Him Sophy began to compose for it.A saung gauk Burmese harp. This is a relative of the Cambodian pin and is similar.

Life and work Faiss was born on March 6, 1905 in the town of Furtwangen, a town in the Black Forest section of Germany. He studied at the Bauhaus, where he was influenced by various artists including Paul Klee and Wassily Kandinsky, as well as the Stuttgart Academy of Fine Arts. He also had training as a medical doctor. Faiss flourished in his art and teaching until the Nazis took power, and thereafter he was viewed by the German government as a degenerate artist. He was harassed by the Gestapo and forbidden to work as an artist, and much of his artwork was destroyed. Eventually he was sent by the Nazis to a forced labor camp, where he spent about a year and became very sick. After the war, he returned to his art and teaching. In 1951, he emigrated to the United States, where he settled in Pasadena, California. He became renowned for his hot wax artwork known as encaustic painting, but he also became an expert painter using many other methods including monotypes, water colors, tempera, lithography, woodcuts, stained glass, and line drawings. Much of his art has biblical, mythological, and mystical themes. He taught at UCLA and Otis Art Institute, and eventually became a tenured professor of art at California State University, Northridge, where he retired as professor emeritus in 1973. His artwork has been installed and exhibited throughout the world, including France, Italy, Germany, England, and the United States. Personal life Faiss was married to Janet Wullner until his death in 1981 at the age of 76. Publications *Faiss, Fritz. Lenticle: two interviews with Fritz Faiss.

She and her husband, Louis Hayden, were the primary operators of the Underground Railroad in Boston and also aided the John Brown slave revolt conspiracy. Early life  She was born in Kentucky in 1816. Around 1842, Harriet Bell married Lewis Hayden after his wife and children had been sold away to another slaveholder. Harriet Bell had one son named Jo, who Lewis adopted following their marriage. On September 28, 1844, after careful planning, the Haydens escaped their Kentucky plantation and fled to Canada. Central to their escape was the assistance of Reverend Calvin Fairbank, who, following their escape to Canada was arrested and given a 15-year sentence for his aid in the Haydens escape. By 1846, the Haydens had permanently relocated to the Beacon Hill neighborhood of Boston, MA.  Underground Railroad activism  Upon relocation to Boston, Harriet and Lewis began putting significant financial resources into helping blacks escape the South and move North. At their home, Harriet opened a boardinghouse where she housed and protected escaped African Americans. The Hayden household sheltered hundreds of blacks seeking freedom, in fact, they \\"harbored 75 percent of all slaves passing through Boston.\\" Following the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act in 1850, she managed and operated Boston's main Underground Railroad operations, and was key to leading people through Boston's tunnel system. Harriet along with her husband were praised by fellow abolitionists Frederick Douglass and William Lloyd Garrison for their significant efforts in aiding escaped blacks. One of the more frequent visitors to the Hayden's household during there antebellum activist years was John Brown. Between 1857 and 1859 Brown visited and stayed with the Haydens and disclosed his plans to raid Harper's Ferry, Virginia. Harriet and her husband helped to raise money in support of Brown's raid. It was also rumored that the Haydens kept barrels of gunpowder in their home and threatened to light it if anyone attempted to take an escaped slave from their house.  Legacy  Harriet Hayden died of pneumonia in her home at the age of 74 in 1893. Following her death, Harriet Hayden donated the entirety of their estate, which amounted to around $5,000, to endow a scholarship at Harvard University. The scholarship was to be used to financially assist black medical students at the Harvard University Medical School. The scholarship is still honored today and black students are still benefiting from the generosity and legacy of the Haydens. Her home at 66 Philips Street is a national historic site and a stop along the Black Heritage Trail, a trail that goes through the Beacon Hill neighborhood and has many stops at notable African American Heritage sites. Her home, however, is still occupied by a private residence and is not open to the public.

The congregation moved into its present synagogue building in 1953. It merged with Congregation Or L'Simcha in 2010, bringing its membership to 530 families. Originally founded as an Orthodox Jewish congregation in 1864, it gradually moved closer to Conservative Judaism. In 1886, it affiliated with the Jewish Theological Seminary Association (JTS), at the time an Orthodox institution, but which developed the Conservative ideology in the early 1900s. Tree of Life joined with JTS offshoot United Synagogue of America about 1916, formally connecting to the nascent Conservative movement. In 2018, the synagogue was the target of a mass shooting in which eleven people were killed and seven injured. It was the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the United States. History Tree of Life Congregation was formed in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1864 as a breakaway group from Rodef Shalom, an Orthodox synagogue founded in 1854 which began adopting Reform practices following the visit of Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise to the city. The initial group of 16 members met in the home of Gustavus Grafner. Then called by its Hebrew name, Etz Chayyim (, 'Tree of Life'), the congregation was chartered in 1865 and acquired land in Sharpsburg for use as a cemetery. The congregation met in temporary locations in the downtown area over the coming years, until in 1883 it bought a former Lutheran church property downtown. At that point, it became known by its English name, Tree of Life. In its early years, Tree of Life was the city's center for Orthodox Judaism, and attracted Orthodox Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. In 1883, it shortened the traditional Orthodox prayer service, and in 1886 became affiliated with the Jewish Theological Seminary Association, a rabbinical training institute which was at the time an Orthodox institution but which developed the Conservative ideology in the early 1900s. Around 1916, Tree of Life joined the national Conservative Jewish network, the United Synagogue of America. In 1906, the congregation began constructing a permanent home on Craft Avenue in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh. The synagogue opened in 1907 with sanctuary seating for 750. English-language prayers were introduced the same year. Beginning in the 1920s, Tree of Life shifted further toward left-wing Conservative Judaism under the direction of Rabbi Herman Hailperin, who led the congregation for 45 years. Among the practices Hailperin instituted were organ music during the prayer services, the elimination of the rabbinically-mandated second day of festival observance, the election of women to the temple's board of trustees, the calling of women to the Torah reading, and counting women as part of the minyan. Synagogue facade In 1953, Tree of Life moved into its present building in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh. The land for the new structure was gifted by then-synagogue president Charles J. Rosenbloom. The synagogue symbolically showed its ties to Israel with a cornerstone hewn from limestone quarried in Jerusalem. The structure initially opened with a library, kitchen, an arts and crafts store, a stage, and vestry rooms. In 1959 the congregation broke ground on a 1,400-seat sanctuary fronted by \\"rows of swirling, modernistic stained-glass windows illustrating the story of creation, the acceptance of God's law, the 'life cycle' and 'how human-beings should care for the earth and one another\\". In 1995, membership numbered 850 families.  Tenants and merger  In the 2000s, an aging membership and the migration of the Jewish community to suburban neighborhoods led to decreasing synagogue membership. Tree of Life began renting space in its building to other congregations. In 2008, Congregation Or L'Simcha (, 'Light of Joy'), founded by Rabbi Chuck Diamond in 2005, began holding services in the Tree of Life building. In 2010, the two congregations voted to merge and became known as Tree of Life ‚Äì Or L'Simcha Congregation. The merger added 120 congregants to Tree of Life's membership rolls, bringing the combined membership to 530 families. In April 2010, Dor Hadash, a Reconstructionist congregation, began renting space in the Tree of Life building. New Light, a Conservative congregation, left its home of 60 years in 2017 and carried its Torah scrolls in a procession to Tree of Life, where it also began renting space. Mass shooting Memorials for victims outside the synagogue A mass shooting occurred in the Tree of Life synagogue during Shabbat morning services on October 27, 2018. A gunman entered the building shouting antisemitic statements and opened fire, killing eleven and injuring seven, including four police officers. The sole suspect, Robert Bowers, was apprehended at the scene.  Leadership  The congregation elected its first spiritual leader, Rabbi Michael Fried, a graduate of the Jewish Theological Seminary, in 1898. The longest-tenured rabbi of the congregation was Rabbi Herman Hailperin, who acceded to the position in 1922 while in his early twenties, the same year he was ordained by the Jewish Theological Seminary; he actively served for the next 45 years, being named rabbi emeritus in 1968. Following is the rabbinical leadership of the Tree of Life Congregation: * Rabbi Michael Fried (1898‚Äì1906) * Rabbi Rudolph Coffee (1906‚Äì1915) * Rabbi Morris Mazure (1915‚Äì1922) * Rabbi Emeritus Herman Hailperin (1922‚Äì1968) * Rabbi Solomon Kaplan (1968‚Äì1982) * Rabbi Emeritus Alvin K.

Alexander Fink, the synagogue president from 1873 to 1892, was also a founder of the city's Hebrew Benevolent Society and later served as president of the United Hebrew Relief Association. When the synagogue established its new home in Squirrel Hill, facilities were given over for meetings of junior and senior Hadassah, the Women's League for Traditional Judaism, Young Judaea clubs, and Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts troops.

He later played seven years of professional football in the National Football League (NFL) and Canadian Football League (CFL). On October 8, 1943, due to the loss of players to military service, the Nevada football team merged with the football team from the Reno Army Air Base team at Lemmon Valley. The combination of university and military football squads was reported to be \\"unprecedented in the history of the nation's wartime football.\\" Because of an Army ruling that prohibited soldiers from playing on college teams, the combined team, known as the \\"Flying Wolves\\" or \\"Flying Wolfpack\\", played under the air base colors, and the University of Nevada players were deemed to have been absorbed into the air base squad. Jim Aiken remained head coach of the combined team with Lieutenants Dayton Doeler and Edward O'Neill acting as assistant coaches. Previous season The Wolf Pack finished the 1942 season 4‚Äì3‚Äì1.

It is also known as phlom slek, \\"blow leaf.\\" To play a leaf, the musician curls the edge of a leaf into a semi-circle (along the leaf's long edge) and \\"places the arch between the lips\\", making sure that the leaf is touching both upper and lower lips. The leaf vibrates in contact with them as the player blows air across it. The player can control the pitch of the noise with his upper lip. An instrument of country people, it has been observed being played by herders riding their water buffalo in the rice fields. While it is used to imitate sounds wild animals make, it can produce sustained sound, a sharp, high-pitched whistle. Players can control the pitch and make songs, normally solo, but sometimes with other instruments. Variants in other places While called slek in Cambodia, the instrument is used in other places under different names. In China, recorded knowledge of the wood leaf (Êú®Âè∂, M√π y√®) as an instrument dates back to the Tang dynasty, 7th to 10th centuries A.D. It is depicted in a sculpture at the tomb of Emperor Wang Jian of the Five Dynasties in Chengdu, Sichuan.

The Crossroads area was originally referred to as \\"Highlands\\". During the latter half of the 1800s and into the early twentieth century, its land was largely used for timber harvesting. By the 1920s, farming had taken hold in the present-day Crossroads and Lake Hills areas, much of it conducted by Japanese immigrants. This agricultural activity was abruptly curtailed following the Japanese American Internment in 1942, and the farmland was quickly replaced by suburban housing during the post-war years.

They named themselves after the ancient Sicarii rebels, a group of Jewish zealots who opposed Roman occupation of Judea. It is unknown whether the Sicarii were an organized group or a loose alliance of isolated extremists. In March 1989, The Jerusalem Post described the Sicarii as \\"the most sought-after under group in Israel today\\". In one telephone call, a member claimed they \\"identified\\" with the Kach political party of Rabbi Meir Kahane, which was outlawed as racist in 1988. Investigation failed to identify the members of the group or to identify the culprits in the attacks that the group claimed responsibility for.  Activities  Sicarii claimed responsibility for multiple attacks on leftist Jews and Palestinians. These incidents also include fires set at apartments owned by left-wing journalists, politicians and entertainers, as well as the torching of cars owned by left- wing public figures; setting off a bomb near the home of a surgeon who had transplanted the heart of an IDF soldier into an East Jerusalem Arab; and the uprooting trees along the Avenue of Righteous Gentiles at the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial. Some targets of the Sicarii' dummy grenade included Gershon Shaked, Hayim Be'er, Hareetz publisher Amos Schoken, and Hebrew University of Jerusalem rector Yoram Ben-Porat. Some victims of their arson attacks include Dan Almagor, Sesame Street TV actress Sarai Tsuriel and pollster Mina Zemach, who had published a survey saying that 54% of Israelis were in favor of peace talks with the PLO. They also sent a number of threatening letters to public media figures, judges, moderate right and left- wing parties as well as ultra-Orthodox leaders. They claimed responsibility for the shooting by a lone gunman of Arabs outside Jerusalem's walled old city on April 10, 1989. The gunman was wearing an Israeli army uniform and shot down four Palestinian men with an Uzi machine gun. Sicarii claimed that the incident, which became known as the Jaffa Gate shooting, was an act of retaliation for the previous week's stoning attack on Jews at the Western Wall. In early January 1990, Sicarii claimed responsibility for planting a dummy grenade under the car of the wife of deputy Prime Minister Shimon Peres. They also threatened to attack other members of the Knesset from the Labor Party and Ratz because they supported Palestinian peace demonstrations, and to execute a dozen activists of the Peace Now movement. In a phone call, a Sicarii member said \\"We know that Peace Now is funded by Shimon Peres and functions under his direct instructions. We have information on all leftist organizations in Israel. We have the means to get to every single traitor.\\"  Goals and strategy  Sicarii's goal was to send a message to Israeli politicians that there would be opposition to any process of rapprochement with the Palestine Liberation Organization. They were also protesting the exclusion of the Kach Party list in the 1988 Israeli legislative election. A Sicarii caller also said that the groups were planning attacks \\"to improve the situation of Jews\\". They attacked Jewish targets predominantly to draw more attention to their cause as attacks on Arabs would have a smaller effect. Their targets were mostly left-wing politicians, but not exclusively. One of their members claimed that the arson attacks were not meant to kill, but to intimidate, suggesting that some of their attacks may have been designed to fail.  Police investigation  In March 1989, the Israeli Police began an investigation into the Sicarii attacks after the group claimed responsibility for setting fire to the door of Petah Tikva mayor Dov Tavori, which lead president Chaim Herzog to call for the authorities to eradicate the group. The Israeli police claimed that the group was a \\"clumsy, loose knit but dangerous band of amateur terrorists\\". During the early stages of the investigations, some members of the Israeli police said that Sicarii might not be a terrorist group at all, but rather that their actions were isolated extremists' work. They said they felt this way because of the poor execution of all the group's attacks, in contrast with the professionalism of the devices laid by Ultra- orthodox terrorists in the same period. Immediately after the 1989 Jaffa gate shooting, Chief Superintendent of the national police force Adi Gonen said that \\"there still is no concrete evidence that the Sicarii exist\\", and he refused to rule out that the shooting was a criminal rather than a political act. Jerusalem Police Chief Josef Yehudai said that the prime suspect was an \\"army reservist ... with nationalist motives\\". In May 1989, the General Security Service arrested 8 Kach party activists over the Sicarii attacks, interrogated them for an hour, and then released them on bail.  Arrest and release of a suspect  On June 26, 1990, a man was arrested by Israeli police on suspicion that he was the individual behind the series of vandalism incidents on Palestinians and left-wing Israelis claimed by Sicarii, committed since January 1989, and of the killing of an Arab. Police initially suspected him of being the leader of Sicarii. The man was released on bail on 29 June 1990 after police failed to find evidence against him. Following his release, he accused newspapers of character assassination, saying, \\"Whoever did (the Sicarii acts) should be put in jail. But I am innocent. Nothing in the newspapers is right.\\" See also * Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict * Jewish religious terrorism * Kahanism * Terror Against Terror  References  Category:Far- right politics in Israel Category:Organizations established in 1989 Category:Jewish religious terrorism Category:Kahanism Category:Zionist terrorism ","title":"Sicarii (1989)"},{"id":"58898060","text":"The French submarine Orion was a submarine built for the French Navy between 1928 and 1931.

It was built from 1830 to 1906. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Aboriginal presence Wambo Homestead is located close to the junction of the traditional boundaries of the Kamilaroi and the Wonaruah peoples. The Kamilaroi extended west to the Namoi and Barwon Rivers, and across the Liverpool Plains. The Wonaruah, who were closely affiliated with the Kamilaroi, occupied the central Hunter Valley area from around Merriwa and the Goulburn River, north to the Paterson. Europeans made contact with both groups when trying to cross the Blue Mountains from Windsor. Archaeological surveys have identified a number of Aboriginal camp sites at the Wambo mine site. Following European settlement, Aboriginal people remained around Wambo and Jerry's Plains, but relations were frequently strained. There is no reported contact between the Wambo settlers and the Kamilaroi or Wonaruah peoples, but there is evidence of an ongoing Aboriginal presence at Wambo from the 1830s, and records of Aboriginal people working on the estate for the Durham family. European settlement of the Hunter Valley In 1813, four well-behaved convicts from the Newcastle penal station were provided with small land grants for farming near Paterson's Plains in the lower Hunter. Convict farming was the only official early settlement allowed in the Hunter Valley which was initially closed to settlers. Governor Macquarie established the new penal settlement in the more remote location of Port Macquarie in 1820 and officially opened up Newcastle and the Hunter Valley to free settlement in 1821. In 1820, John Howe, a Windsor settler, led a party from Windsor through the Broken Back Ranges to present-day Broke and Jerry's Plains, arriving near Singleton (close to Wambo). He named the wide grassy flood plain St Patricks Plains where he was granted land. This marked the beginnings of European settlement of the middle and upper Hunter Valley. Rapid European settlement of the Hunter Valley took place between 1822 and 1829. Over 300 farms totalling over 800,000 acres were established on granted and leased land. Most farms were run by resident settlers and most were over 1000 acres. Settlement of the Hunter Valley was either via sea from Sydney, or overland from Windsor. Livestock were largely driven along the overland route. By the 1830s the Hunter Valley was the most densely settled district outside the Cumberland Plain. Smaller farms, generally less than 100 acres, were established around Maitland, Paterson and Singleton based on land grants that were matched to an applicant's income or capital (as recommended by the Bigge Report). Most of these were the subsistence farms of emancipated convicts or colonial free born. Larger properties for sheep and cattle grazing with grain growing were generally held by emigrant farmers and worked by assigned convicts (the Hunter Valley having a large proportion of the colony's assigned convicts). By 1828, of the 91 estates in the Hunter Valley that were over 1000 acres, only two were recorded as being owned by ex-convicts. Development of the Wambo Estate 1824-40 Land around Wambo was desirable, close to the Windsor Road and the fertile valley flats of the Wollombi Brook and Hunter River. It was granted early in the European settlement of the Hunter Valley, as 1824 and 1825 land grants to two free emigrants. There is no evidence that either grantee had developed the land or built any substantial structures before both grants were sold to James Hale who established the Wambo Estate. James Hale arrived in the colony in 1816 as a 20 year old convict who was forwarded to Windsor on assignment. By 1822, Hale had been freed by servitude and was working as an overseer for William Cox in the Hawkesbury. In the 1820s and early 1830s Hale was a contractor to the Colonial Government supplying fresh and salt beef, mutton, flour, maize, firewood and cartage for survey parties departing Windsor. By 1828 he had established himself as a successful Windsor resident and local businessman, being innkeeper of the White Hart Inn at Windsor with 5 assigned servants; 2133 acres of land (11 being cleared); 11 horses; 433 cattle and 1090 sheep. In 1835, Hale purchased 1218 acres on Wollombi Brook. This marked the beginning of his Hunter Valley landholding interests, which Hale rapidly expanded. Between 1835 and 1837, Hale added a further 10,240 acres in leasehold. This marked him as having an unusually large landholding for a Hunter Valley emancipist. Hale expanded his landholdings in the 1830s and 1840s with purchases in the Liverpool Plains around Inverell, and further west around Coonabarabran. By 1841 Hale's grazing empire comprised almost 100,000 acres. Most of his properties (like Wambo) were run by managers who lived on site and worked the property with both assigned convicts and newly arrived immigrant labour. James Hale resided at Windsor throughout his ownership of Wambo, in the house he purchased from his former master, William Cox. Wambo Homestead Between 1830-33, Hale constructed the first building on the Wambo Estate. The Kitchen Wing was begun as a single storey stone building with a cellar and later extended with an upper level of brick. The stud master's cottage was built in 1840, the carriage house with stables and granary in 1840, and the servants' wing in 1844. The \\"New House\\" was built between 1844 and 1847. Hale was possibly influenced in the design of Wambo by the Colonial Architect Francis Greenway whose work he would have encountered through his close relationship with William Cox. Cox took a number of contracts, where he worked with Greenway, for the construction of public buildings around Windsor. Hale may also have used some of Cox's builders for the construction of Wambo. By 1844 James Hale was one of the largest 100 landholders in the colony; an established sheep and cattle grazier and wheat farmer with at least 4 assigned convicts working at Wambo. Hale used Wambo as a halfway point for moving sheep between Windsor and his properties on the Liverpool Plains and New England. Over the 1840s to 1870s, the Wambo herd developed into prize-winning bulls and cows at local and Sydney shows. In 1857, James Hale died, leaving Wambo and many of his other properties to William Durham, the eldest son of his wife Mary from her first marriage. Durham had very likely been the manager of Wambo. Wambo continued in Durham family ownership until 1894 when it was sold. Coal was discovered at Wambo during well-drilling in 1863. In 1900, the timber Butcher's Hut was built. In 1905, Wambo Estate was purchased by R. C. Allen and Frank Macdonald for use as a thoroughbred stud. Allen and Macdonald implemented a program of timber building in 1906 that included the Slab Horse Boxes and the Mounting Yard and Horse Boxes and fences. In 1906, the property was subdivided, and the Macdonald family purchased the Wambo Homestead block which they held until 1983. In 1971, the Wambo Mining Corporation bought much of the surrounding land, but not the homestead block itself. Wambo Homestead was classified by the National Trust of Australia in 1981 and a state Permanent Conservation Order over the property was issued in 1982. The Wambo Mining Corporation bought the Wambo Homestead block in 1987 and began mining the area, using the homestead for training and storage until 2000. They vacated the building in 2000. It has subsequently been unused.Godden Mackay Logan, Wambo Homestead Complex, Heritage Strategy, Historical Development -- Wambo Homestead and Farm, 2010, pp. 39-44. In 2010, the now Wambo Coal Pty Ltd sought to delist the homestead complex from the State Heritage Register following changes to state heritage legislation, which if successful would allow them to demolish the property and access underlying coal deposits. The company claimed they would suffer \\"undue financial hardship\\" if they had to sacrifice the underlying coal in order to preserve the property, that it was \\"not rare\\" and that it was not fit for habitation. The company also offered to move three of the complex buildings to another site. The delisting, demolition and relocation were all opposed by heritage proponents, and the move did not proceed. In 2012, it was reported that Wambo Coal were looking to find a permanent use for the building, though needing to overcome the challenge of its location within a working mine lease. It was reported at that time that minor stabilisation works had been undertaken and that some repairs were planned in future. In 2013, an oral history project regarding the homestead was undertaken, having been required as a Heritage Council condition of continuing mining works in the vicinity of the house.  Description  The Homestead currently consists of eight buildings, the earliest being the kitchen wing. Originally this was a single storey sandstone building with a cellar, to which a brick upper floor was added. A large brick laundry has also been added. Other buildings include the Stud Master's Cottage of three rooms and the brick servants wing of three rooms also. All are \\"Old Colonial Georgian\\", the earliest European architectural style used in Australia. Around 1844, the \\"Victorian Regency\\" New House was built, constructed of brick and render with a stone base. It is a distinctive single-storey rendered (stucco) brick house, obviously conceived as an architecturally ambitious Regency style villa. Rigorously designed to impress as a tasteful, spare, symmetrical grand homestead residence, it was placed to present to the valley floor and ranges to the south, turning the \\"old house\\" into an impressive supporting kitchen and service wing. The four principal rooms, arranged as pairs either side of an axial central flagged hall, are covered by a low, transverse, hipped roof. These are surrounded by a lower skirt of verandahs and verandah room rooms, set at a lower pitch but similarly roofed originally with hardwood shingles.GML, Wambo Homestead Complex, Revised Database of Hunter Region Homesteads, Report, Nov 2010, p. 28 Other buildings which make up the Homestead are the Slab Carriage House with Stables, the timber slab / rammed earth Butcher's Hut and the Slab Horse Boxes. Other remote structures exist on the property including a large hay barn, silos and fences. There is rare evidence of extensive early finishes in the fabric of the core group of 1830s and 1840s buildings. The four masonry buildings of this group demonstrate rare retention of all their original joinery. As a group of buildings, Wambo Homestead is rare in New South Wales in that many outbuildings still remain substantially intact allowing easy understanding of the development of a homestead complex.  Modifications and dates  * 1830s - Single brick Stud Master's Cottage and Servants Wing constructed possibly while the brick upper floor to the kitchen wing was added. * 1837 - Homestead was situated on 4480 acres and included a large brick structure with cellars. * 1844 (circa) - The New House was constructed. The construction of the Carriage House and Stables would have been contemporary with the building of the New House.  Heritage listing  Wambo Homestead Complex is state significant in the context of Australian pastoral activities and horse breeding in New South Wales and for its capacity to demonstrate the development of pastoral and agricultural activity in the Hunter Region--an important early region of colonial settlement. This significance is strongly demonstrated in the survival of the core group of five early homestead buildings, constructed between the mid 1830s and mid 1840s, and in the relationship of all buildings and structures of the Wambo Homestead Complex to their setting and the landscape. Wambo Homestead Complex is state significant as an important group of homestead buildings which remain substantially intact and which display the progressive architectural development of a typical Australian homestead group. It is also state significant for its capacity to demonstrate rare evidence of extensive early finishes in the fabric of the core group of 1830s and 1840s buildings, and for the retention of all original joinery of the four masonry buildings of this group. The New House is state significant for its refined design and capacity to demonstrate architectural ambition at an early stage of colonial rural settlement. Wambo Homestead Complex is state significant for its rarity as an important homestead complex that was established by a former convict in the Hunter Region, where most large estates were established by free settlement. The complex is significant for its associations with its original owner, the emancipist convict James Hale, who was responsible for the complex's core buildings and who, by 1844, had established himself as one of the top 100 landholders in the colony. Although the Wambo Homestead Complex is in a \\"rundown\\" condition, it still maintains and demonstrates its state significance. Wambo Homestead was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Wambo Homestead shows the development of pastoral activities in the Hunter Valley after Commissioner John Bigge's reports to the British Government on the state of the colony and its administration. Wambo Homestead specifically shows the pattern of selection by residents of Windsor via John Howe's newly established Bulga Road. It provides evidence of the rise to wealth of James Hale, a former convict and important resident of Windsor who by the mid 1840s had established himself as a successful entrepreneur and one of the 100 largest landholders in the colony. Wambo Homestead is a rare example which demonstrates the economic development of the Hunter Valley Region from an agricultural base through sheep, cattle and horse breeding to dairying and presently coal mining. The process involved in gaining the best economic opportunities from the property can be clearly seen. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. As the creation of the convicted thief, James Hale, Wambo Estate demonstrates the enormous opportunities open to the pioneers of New South Wales. Within two decades a farm boy serving a seven year prison term had become wealthy and influential in two districts, the Hawkesbury and the Hunter Valley, and one of the colony's largest landholders. In the Durham period, the property continued to yield affluence to its owners, allowing the children of convicts to control the circumstances of their lives and to live with some style. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Wambo Homestead remains substantially intact and largely unaltered. The buildings follow the architectural vocabulary of vernacular Georgian England and demonstrate the progressive architectural development of a typical early Australian homestead group. The New House ( 1847) is state significant for its capacity to demonstrate refined design and architectural ambition at an early stage of colonial settlement through its conception as an architecturally ambitious Regency style villa that was designed to impress as a tasteful, spare, symmetrical grand homestead residence placed to present to the valley floor and ranges to the south. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Wambo Homestead demonstrates the opportunities available to energetic people who were transported to NSW in the early decades of the 19th century. Wambo Homestead is significant in terms of its distance from Hales place of residence, Windsor, and because of its position in the broadening agricultural enterprises of pioneer settlers. The group of buildings express the way farms were operated, with an emphasis on manual labour, and the use of the horse for work and transport. As the residence of William and Sophia Durham the homestead has associative social significance in the Hunter Valley. This is evident in the substantial development of the Homestead in the early years and the descriptions of lifestyle afforded by visiting commentators of the period. Further, the development of the Horse Stud infrastructure by the Allen and McDonald partnership provides physical evidence of the social and sporting aspirations of elite residents of Sydney at the turn of the 20th century. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. As an archaeological resource the buildings and surrounding grounds provided an opportunity to contribute to the knowledge regarding the expansion of the colony of New South Wales, its agricultural diversification and every day life on homestead properties from the 1820s till the 1890s. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. As a group of buildings, Wambo Homestead is rare in New South Wales in that many outbuildings still remain substantially intact allowing easy understanding of the development of a homestead complex. It is rare as a large and important estate established by an emancipated convict in the Hunter Valley, where most such estates were established by free settlers. The core group of 1830s and 1840s buildings demonstrate rare evidence of extensive early finishes in the building fabric and the retention of all the original joinery in the four masonry buildings of the group.

Wickremesinghe and the United National Party (UNP) viewed the appointment as illegal, and he refused to resign. Sirisena's sudden decision instigated \\"political turmoil in the country\\", and drew international criticism. Wickremesinghe, the majority of the parliament, and opposition parties refused to acknowledge his removal and the appointment of Rajapaksa, stating that Sirisena's move was unconstitutional. Wickremesinghe claimed that he still commands a majority in parliament and requested that Speaker of the Parliament Karu Jayasuriya convene parliament immediately. Sirisena ignored all calls to reconvene parliament and on 27 October prorogued parliament, delaying its meeting till 16 November. After an attempt to form a new cabinet of ministers with Rajapaksa as Prime Minister failed, Sirisena attempted to dissolve parliament on 9 November. The UNP declared the move unconstitutional and subsequently the Supreme Court stayed Sirisena's dissolution until December 2018, when it ruled that the move was unconstitutional and illegal. Rajapaksa backed down from claiming the office and Wickremesinghe was once again reinstated, ending the crisis after 7 weeks of political and economic turmoil. The roots of the crisis date back to the late Rajapaksa presidency which turned increasingly authoritarian in its second term, after the Sri Lankan Civil War. During his time in office President Rajapaksa expanded the power of the presidency, centralising power under his control, while drawing the country closer to China. He and his close family have been accused of and are currently under investigation for corruption. While the former president has also been accused of war crimes and human rights violations. The crisis was triggered by a false allegation of an assassination plot against President Sirisena and lasted for 7 weeks but had a lasting political and economic impact on the country. Due to the fragile Sri Lankan economy the crisis cost the country a billion US dollars in reserves, dropping from $7.991 billion in forex reserves to $6.985 billion. The Sri Lankan rupee ultimately devalued by 3.8% during the same time, while US$312.9 million, in the form of treasury bonds, and US$29.8 million in the form of treasury bills left the country. Sri Lanka's credit was also downgraded as a result of the crisis. While the United States and Japanese governments froze more than a billion US dollars worth of development aid. November saw industrial activity in Sri Lanka slow as a result of the crisis, falling 3.7% from October to November, the largest seen since it began in 2016. Background Rajapaksa presidency The presidency of Mahinda Rajapaksa, from 2005 to 2015 was an increasingly authoritarian regime characterised by the diminishing human rights in the country, nepotism, weakening of government institutions, slow progress of national reconciliation in the aftermath of the Sri Lankan Civil War, and close ties to China. Before serving as president, Rajapaksa also served as Prime Minister. In 2009, Rajapaksa ended the 27-year long Sri Lankan Civil War, but has been accused of war crimes and human rights abuses. At the height of his power, Rajapaksa and his family controlled 80 percent of the national budget where Rajapaksa simultaneously served as finance minister and four other cabinet posts on top of the presidency, while his three brothers served as the defence secretary and ministers of economy and ports and the Speaker of the Parliament. Many of those, including journalists, who were critical of him disappeared. According to Reuters, in the aftermath of the Sri Lankan Civil War, Rajapaksa borrowed \\"billions of dollars\\" from China to build infrastructure projects, though these had little economic value to the country. These projects were seen as vanity projects or white elephants. 2015 presidential election In response to the degrading democracy in the country, the United National Party (UNP), along with several other parties and civil organisations, signed a Memorandum of Understanding and decided to field the then Secretary General of Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), Maithripala Sirisena, as the Common Candidate for the 2015 Presidential Election. Sirisena, a former health minister under Rajapaksa, pledged to appoint UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister if he were to win the election. Sirisena won the January 2015 election and became the 7th President of Sri Lanka and appointed Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister as promised. The presidential election was followed by a General Parliamentary Elections, held on 17 August 2015, in which the UNP-lead coalition gained 106 seats in the Parliament and formed a National Government with several other parties. Wickremesinghe and the UNP came to power promising accountability for alleged atrocities committed during the Sri Lanka civil war and during the Rajapaksa presidency. Following the 2015 election defeat, Mahinda Rajapaksa held India's intelligence service, Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), among those responsible for the change in regime. The Government of India also welcomed Rajapaksa's defeat, claiming that the former leader had strained ties with them while moving the country closer to China. A national unity government was formed, which passed the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka on 28 April 2015, stipulating that the Prime Minister should remain in office for as long as his cabinet functions, unless he resigns or ceases to be a member of parliament. Uneasy coalition The Sirisena-Wickremesinghe government had been struggling to repay the debts incurred during the Rajapaksa presidency. The Magampura Mahinda Rajapaksa Port, built with Chinese money, was handed over to Beijing in a 99-year lease in 2017 as a form of payment. Sri Lanka also recorded just 3.1% economic growth rate, the lowest for 16 years in 2017. By 2018, following Mahinda Rajapaksa's proxy Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna winning a landslide victory in the 2018 local authority elections, disputes among the members of the National Government began to surface and a major rift between the President and Prime Minister appeared. Sirisena claimed Wickremesinghe to have led to the loss of 11 billion Sri Lankan rupees ($65 million; ¬£50 million) in the controversial central bank bond sale, and also alleged that a cabinet minister was involved in a plot to kill him and that police had obstructed an investigation. In 2017 opinion poll conducted by the Centre for Policy Alternatives revealed Fifty-six percent of respondents are unhappy with the coalition government. Specially 63 percent of majority Sinhalese respondents. Special high courts for bribery and corruption cases In May 2018, the Sri Lanka parliament approved a special high court that would expedite the hearing and trial of bribery and corruption related cases. The concept for the High Court Trial-at-Bar was instituted with the passage of amendments to the Judicature Act, the purpose of expediting cases from the Rajapaksa Government era. The Sunday Times of 15 July 2018 stated that \\"the former Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation chairman Gamini Senarath and its Managing Director Piyadasa Kudabalage will be the first to be indicted before the newly set up court.\\" Senarath was the chief of staff of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. The Special Courts are also strongly regarded as a factor in the creation of the 2018 Constitutional Crisis. Alleged assassination attempt Reports of an assassination plot emerged in September when an individual named Namal Kumara claimed he was aware of a plan to assassinate President Sirisena and former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Kumara was interrogated by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), and in late September the police arrested an Indian national, Marceli Thomas, from Kerala, claiming he knew of the plot. Kumara alleged the Director of the Terrorism Investigation Division (TID) of the Sri Lanka Police, Deputy Inspector General of Police Nalaka de Silva had masterminded the plot. Nalaka de Silva was suspended pending a formal investigation by the CID and later arrested by CID on 25 October under the Prevention of Terrorism Act and remanded till 7 November. In mid October 2018, Indian newspaper The Hindu reported that Sirisena told Cabinet members that India's intelligence service, Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), had devised a plot to assassinate him, though Sirisena denied the report. Sirisena in the cabinet meeting told Ministers that RAW was \\"trying to kill\\" him, but \\"Prime Minister Narendra Modi may not be aware of the plan.\\" On 18 October 2018, a statement released by India's Prime Minister Office (PMO) said that Sirisena called Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to reject the media reports about him alluding to the involvement of India in the alleged assassination plot. Sirisena also stated that he \\"regards the [Indian] Prime Minister as a true friend of Sri Lanka, as also a close personal friend. He stressed that he greatly valued the mutually beneficial ties between India and Sri Lanka, and remained steadfast to work with the Prime Minister for further strengthening them.\\" On 26 October 2018, the United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA) withdrew from the government, ending the national government that was in place since 2015. The same day, Sirisena also alleged that a cabinet minister was involved but did not name the cabinet minister. However said \\"Under these political problems, economic troubles, and the strong plot to assassinate me, the only alternative open to me was to invite former president Mahinda Rajapaksa and appoint him as Prime Minister to form a new government.\\" In February 2019 Sri Lankan police refused to press charges against Indian national, Marceli Thomas and cleared the man of wrongdoing due to lack of evidence. \\"There is no sufficient evidence to file charges against him and we will not file charges against him\\", S. Wijesuriya, an investigating official, told the Colombo Magistrate Court. Timeline of events Two Prime Ministers The president's UPFA had earlier on Friday, 26 October, quit the national unity government that had governed with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's UNP. Later at about 7:00 pm without a prior announcement, President Maithripala Sirisena unexpectedly appointed former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister in a live swearing-in ceremony broadcast over television. Rajapaksa took an oath of office in the presence of Sirisena and representatives of the military inside the Presidential Secretariat. He was sworn in while Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was still the incumbent and away touring in the south of the country. The situation in Colombo was uneasy with some cabinet ministers immediately declaring the move unconstitutional, while other Cabinet ministers and parliamentarians began defecting to the new government. Wickremesinghe addressed the nation saying, \\"I am addressing you as the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka. I still hold the majority of the house. [...] Convene parliament and I will prove it.\\" Three ministers, including Mangala Samaraweera and Cabinet Spokesman Rajitha Senaratne, tried to address the nation during a live television program. That day Rajapaksa loyalists stormed two state-owned television networks which they regarded loyal to Wickremesinghe and the sitting government, including Rupavahini, and forced them off the air. Troops were brought in to protect the channel's staff. Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera tweeted that Rajapaksa's appointment was \\"unconstitutional and illegal. This is an anti-democratic coup,\\" saying Wickramasinghe remained leader as he could not constitutionally be removed by the president. While UPFA MP Susil Premajayantha told reporters that a new cabinet would be sworn in soon. Speaker of the Parliament Karu Jayasuriya said he was to decide on Saturday (27th), after seeking legal advice, whether to recognise Rajapaksa or not. The Parliament was not due to meet until 5 November when the 2019 national budget was to be presented. The Supreme Court, which is empowered to resolve constitutional disputes, was shut for the weekend, to be reopened on Monday. On 27 October President Sirisena issued a formal notice for Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to step down. Sirisena later issued gazettes formalising and defending the dramatic move. Wickremesinghe however entered Temple Trees, the Prime Ministers residence, refusing to accept the appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa and his dismissal, insisting in a letter to Sirisena that he was still in office. Sirisena and Rajapaksa announced their intent to form a new cabinet. Nalaka Kaluwewa, an Acting Additional Secretary in the Presidential Secretariat, was appointed as Acting Director General of Information under the instructions of President Sirisena. The day after Rajapaksa's appointment, the Parliament, which was due to meet on 5 November to discuss the budget for the next year, was prorogued by the President, delaying its meeting till 16 November. President Sirisena stated on Saturday night that the main reason for him to form a new government with Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister was the alleged plot to assassinate him. He claimed that the name of Sarath Fonseka had come up in the investigation of the CID but was suppressed. On 27 October, Mangala Samaraweera tweeted that the security personnel and official verticals assigned to the Prime Minister were withdrawn from Wickremesinghe and assigned to Rajapaksa on orders from the President. The Inspector General of Police (IGP) Jayasundara had ordered the 1,008 police and STF personnel assigned to Wickremesinghe as Prime Ministerial security to be withdrawn and replaced with 10 police personnel from the Ministerial Security Division (MSD). The security details of ministers of the former government have been also reduced to the levels provided to parliamentarians. China, Burundi and Pakistan had recognised Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister. Chinese President Xi Jinping was one of the first to congratulate the pro-Beijing leader. Calls to reconvene Parliament Karu Jayasuriya, Speaker of Parliament The Speaker of Parliament, Karu Jayasuriya requested the President to reconvene parliament following consultations with party leaders of the UNP, ITAK, JVP and the SLMC on 30 October. The Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya stated that it is inappropriate for him to express an opinion on the matter, in response to a request for comment by the Speaker. UPFA MP Susil Premajayantha stated that Parliament would reconvene on 16 November as per the Gazette and not on 5 November as said by Rajapaksa the day before. On 2 November 119 MPs from several parties met and passed a resolution calling for immediate convention of Parliament claiming that the removal of the Prime Minister and the appointment of another was unconstitutional. The Speaker has stated that the President agreed to convene Parliament on 7 November. However, if the President fails to issue the gazette notification to convene Parliament, the Speaker has stated that he will convene Parliament on 7 November under the powers vested in him. Speaker Jayasuriya later in a statement announced that he will not accept any changes that had happened in Sri Lanka after 26 October until they are verified in parliament. On 7 November UPFA MP Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena said that the only item on Parliamentary agenda on 14 November is the policy statement by President Sirisena. President Sirisena met with a Tamil National Alliance (TNA) delegation whom he asked to abstain from a vote of no confidence if it were moved. The TNA told Sirisena it had taken a decision to vote against the appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister. The President in response is reported to have said that he will not reappoint Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister, even if his party secured a majority in Parliament. While making an address on 8 November the SLFP executive committee meeting Sirisena said that \\"he had used only one trump card and there were more trump cards still in his hand\\", and that he would not go back on any decisions that he had taken already, during this crisis. Sirisena said he was going to make a request to the UNP to support the government's work plan when Parliament reconvenes on the 14th. The UNP said it would explore the possibility of removing President Sirisena in conformity with Article 38 (2) of the Constitution. The Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA) responded it would not support any impeachment move as, while they do not support the appointment of Rajapaksa, \\"they are not in favour of adding more fire to the current crisis\\". Sirisena-Rajapaksa cabinet appointments On 29 October, President Maitripala Sirisena appointed the first members of a new cabinet at the Presidential Secretariat in Colombo, with four UNP MPs appointed as ministers including Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, Vadivel Suresh, Vasantha Senanayake and Ananda Aluthgamage. UNP MP Dunesh Gankanda was sworn in as State Minister of Environment along with a dozen secretaries to various ministries on 30 October. UNP MP Ashoka Priyantha was appointed on 4 November as Deputy Minister of Cultural and Internal Affairs, and Regional Development (Wayamba). While UPFA MPs Dinesh Gunawardena was appointed Minister of Megapolis and Western Development; Vasudeva Nanayakkara, Minister of National Integration, Reconciliation, and Official Languages and Keheliya Rambukwella State Minister of Mass Media and Digital Infrastructure. On 6 November Deputy Minister of Labour and Foreign Employment and UPFA MP Manusha Nanayakkara resigned from his ministerial position and pledged support to Ranil Wickremesinghe. Nanayakkara says that staying true to his heart he cannot join or participate in the recent appointments made and the change in government. UPFA MP Dinesh Gunawardena was appointed Leader of the House. Bribery allegations In an effort to show a majority in parliament for a vote of confidence the Sirisena-Rajapaksa group have been seeking defections from opposing parties in an attempt to reach 113 MPs. Amid these attempts have been claims of bribery and threats against those opposing the Sirisena-Rajapaksa group. UNP MP Hirunika Premachandra's political career had been threatened, over a phone call to her aunt, if she failed to accept a ministerial portfolio with the Sirisena-Rajapaksa group. The UNP alleged that Rajapaksa loyalists had been luring its MPs to support Sirisena and Rajapaksa with the offer of significant bribes and ministerial portfolios. Some say they have been offered over Rs. 500 million (US$2,796,150, Dec 2018) to defect. Another UNP legislator claimed he had been approached by Sirisena‚Äôs party to defect with an offer of 500 million rupees and an apartment in Malaysia along with free passage for the entire family to a foreign destination. Some UNP MPs have said the bribery is being financed by China, which Beijing has denied. Namal Rajapaksa responded on Twitter saying his party had no information about bribes. Palitha Range Bandara told Speaker Jayasuriya he had been offered a bribe of Rs. 500 million to defect to Mr. Rajapaksa‚Äôs party. On 3 November, the UNP released an audio recording, which claimed to attempt to buy UNP MPs which contained a phone conversation allegedly taken place between UPFA MP S. B. Dissanayake and UNP MP Palitha Range Bandara. Bandara said he would hand over the electronic and documentary evidence to the Bribery Commission to file a complaint. Members of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, who have 7 MPs, have said its members have been approached with offers to join the Sirisena- Rajapaksa camp. In an interview, with the Daily Mirror in early December, President Sirisena confirmed the bribery allegations made by the UNP remarking he personally knew about the situation. \\"Some MPs even asked for Rs. 500 million ($2,796,150 USD, Dec 2018) to crossover. I personally know about such situations. It was like calling for tenders. That is why Mahinda Rajapaksa could not show a majority in Parliament\\" he said. Sirisena openly admitted his candidate for Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa attempted to bribe members of parliament in order to show majority in the House, he went on to say that the current crisis could have been avoided had he been able to the 113 MPs. However he said he \\"believes that Mahinda Rajapaksa couldn't show majority because MPs demanded millions, as high as Rs. 500 million to crossover. The Daily Mirror later removed the video of the interview from its Facebook page upon coming under increasing pressure from the President‚Äôs Media Division. The video was replaced with an audio based short video of photographs of Sirisena. A second version did not carry Sirisena‚Äôs remarks about MPs asking for bribes. Dissolution of parliament and elections Gazette 2096/70 issued Friday, 9 November 2018 dissolving the parliament of Sri Lanka President Sirisena issues a gazette notification bringing the Sri Lanka Police under the purview of the Ministry of Defence, which was earlier under the Ministry of Law and Order. This was followed with the transfer of the Department of Government Printing which publishes the government Gazette under the Ministry of Defence. Sirisena has brought the Military, Police and the Gazette under his direct control. Amid calls to reconvene parliament Sirisena and his party admitted they did not have enough votes to support Mahinda Rajapaksa against Ranil Wickremesinghe to decide the office of Prime Minister. Ahead of the president's announcement the UPFA said they were at least eight legislators short of getting a majority for Rajapaksa in the parliament. \\"At the moment we have 104 or 105 MPs,\\" UPFA's spokesman Keheliya Rambukwella told reporters. He further went on to say the Sirisena-Rajapakse group hoped to secure support from \\"crossover\\" legislators. This is in contrast to what Sirisena claimed on the 5th, that he had the support of 113 legislators when he sacked Wickremesinghe. According to an AFP count, 120 MPs support Wickremesinghe and his allies. President Sirisena dissolves Parliament by proclamation, from midnight of 9 November and declared snap elections to be held on around 5 January 2019. The move was swiftly denounced by the United National Party in a post on Twitter, saying it \\"vehemently rejects\\" the sacking of the parliament. The party also accused Sirisena of robbing the \\"people of their rights and democracy\\". The act was in violation of the 19th Amendment to the constitution, which he co-sponsored. A short while later it was announced through an extraordinary gazette notice that general elections will be held on 5 January 2019, with the first meeting of the new Parliament to be held on 17 January 2019. UPFA MP Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena said \\"The nominations would be tendered from 9 to 26 November\\". The JVP has accused Sirisena of trying to consolidate his power grab. The election date was announced even before preparing the government's annual budget for the next fiscal year in 2019. Sirisena inducted more cabinet ministers prior to signing the order to dissolve the parliament. Supporters of Ranil Wickremesinghe were in the process of preparing legal papers to challenge the latest move in the country's Supreme Court. Sri Lanka Freedom Party Split Succeeding the dissolution of parliament and the announcement of snap elections, Mahinda Rajapaksa and 44 other members of parliament on 11 November defected from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, led by President Maithripala Sirisena, to join the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP). The SLPP was formed in 2016 by Basil Rajapaksa, younger brother of Mahinda. A member of the SLPP said that 65 out of 82 Sri Lanka Freedom Party MPs will eventually join Rajapaksa's party. Other prominent defectors include Mahindananda Aluthgamage, Rohitha Abeygunawardena, Anura Priyadharshana Yapa, Johnston Fernando and Namal Rajapaksa. Namal Rajapaksa said relating to the defections, \\"We will strive to create a broader coalition with many stakeholders under the leadership of Maithripala Sirisena & Mahinda Rajapaksa to face the upcoming General Election and come out victorious.\\" Supreme Court stays proclamation dissolving parliament The Supreme Court Complex On 12 November, twelve Fundamental Right petitions were submitted to the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka challenging the president's decree sacking parliament and calling a snap election, by the UNP, TNA, JVP, SLMC and others including Prof Ratnajeevan Hoole, a member of the Election Commission. Arguing that Sirisena's actions were unconstitutional, illegal and against the people of Sri Lanka, Hoole demanded the restoration of status quo prevailing prior to 26 October. Hoole's position strengthens the argument of 11 other petitions. These were taken up for hearing on the same day by a three-member bench of the Supreme Court consisting of the Chief Justice Nalin Perera, Justices Prasanna Jayawardena and Priyantha Jayawardena. Responding to the petitions, Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya made submissions stating that \\"the court had no jurisdiction to hear and determine the Fundamental Rights petitions against the dissolution of Parliament\\". On the same day, 5 petitions by Prof G. L. Peiris, Minister Udaya Gammanpila, Minister Vasudeva Nanayakkara and two others supporting the dissolution of parliament were filed at the Supreme Court. However, in the evening the three Judge bench issued an interim order till 7 December staying the proclamation issued by President Sirisena to dissolve parliament and granted leave to proceed with the Fundamental Rights petitions that challenged the President's dissolving parliament. Following the stay order of the Supreme Court, President Sirisena convened the National Security Council at the Presidential Secretariat; where he ordered the police and armed forces to maintain the peace in the country. Soon after the IGP Jayasundara ordered senior police officers to maintain the law and order in the country. Parliamentary clashes 1st Motion of no confidence The Speaker office stated on 13 November, following the stay order from the Supreme Court, that Parliament would convene on 14 November as per the gazette issued by President Sirisena on 4 November. On 14 November the Parliament gathered for the vote. Rajapaksa and his son Namal walked out of the chamber just before the Speaker called for a vote. Amid shouting, speaker Karu Jayasuriya took a voice vote while members loyal to Rajapaksa attempted to grab the mace, the symbol of authority of the legislature, to disrupt it. The vote went ahead and a no-confidence motion against Mahinda Rajapaksa was passed. Wickremesinghe said he submitted a petition carrying signatures of 122 MPs who support the no-confidence motion. Jayasuriya confirmed that the no- confidence motion against Rajapaksa had support of 122 members in the 225-member house. 2nd Motion of no confidence A second Motion of no confidence took place on 16 November which was approved. However it too was not accepted by the President, who later requested for a third motion of no confidence to be passed in parliament. Motion of confidence On 12 December, the parliament passed a vote of confidence in support of Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister. Rajapaksa led government moves During the period of the crisis the disputed government hastily made controversial government decisions and contracts in order to win over public opinion. The Rajapaksa led government had made plans to lower fuel prices and income taxes in a bid to increase public support. Transferral of Nishantha Silva Since the start of the crisis, President Sirisena has taken the police under his direct control. Inspector of Police Nishantha Silva is the officer in charge of Criminal Investigation Department's (CID) Organised Crimes Investigation Unit. Silva is handling investigations into major incidents including those during the Rajapaksa administration, most notably the abduction and the assault of Journalist Keith Noyahr, in 2008 and the murder of Lasantha Wickrematunge in 2009, in addition to at least 60 crimes committed by the LTTE. He is also investigating the rape and the murder of student Sivaloganathan Vithya and the abduction of 11 youths in Colombo, in 2008-09 where Chief of Defence Staff Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne is allegedly involved in harbouring a suspect of the abduction. Mahinda Rajapaksa, his family and associates are directly connected to these investigations, and as Silva pursued inquiries into them, on 18 November he was transferred by IGP Pujith Jayasundara on the orders of President Sirisena to the Negombo Division with \\"immediate effect on service requirements\\". Silva had just secured an arrest order for Admiral Wijegunaratne when he was shifted. Wijegunaratne, however has retained the office of Chief of Defence Staff. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, the Former defence secretary and brother of the former president, is being investigated on allegations of defrauding the state and was indicted in September. Silva was also investigating Gotabhaya for alleged corruption in aircraft purchases from Ukraine during his time in the Rajapaksa administration. In response to the transferral Silva had appealed to the National Police Commission (NPC). The Commission requested a report from IGP Pujith Jayasundara as to why the officer handling several high-profile investigations had been transferred. The intervention by the NPC prompted IGP Jayasundara to reverse his order and withdraw the transfer, on the 19th, allowing Silva to continue in the same capacity. It was learnt in a letter to IGP Jayasundara, written by CID Director Senior DIG Ravi Seneviratne that it was Admiral Wijegunaratne who had orchestrated the transferral by framing allegations against Silva of maintaining connections with the LTTE, during the last security council meeting chaired by President Sirisena. The daughter of Lasantha Wickrematunge, Ahimsa Wickrematunge wrote to the President against the obstruction of justice. Sugar tax The disputed government controversially lowered taxes on sugary drinks which attracted immediate criticism. The tax that was introduced by the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe government sought to tackle the prevalence of diabetes in the country. The sweet tax, which taxed 50 cents on every gram of sugar in fizzy and fruit drinks was cut to 30 cents starting 1 December. Mahinda Rajapaksa who holds the Ministry of Finance in the disputed government instructed the cut the sugar tax by 40 percent, a move made after a meeting with business leaders in the industry. The measure could reduce soft drinks prices by 30%, Prime Minister's Office said. Court order restraining Prime Minister and Ministers Following a quo warranto writ petition filed by 122 MPs against the appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister and other Ministers, the Court of Appeal issued an interim order on 3 December restraining the functioning of the respondents Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister as well as other cabinet ministers, deputy ministers and state ministers. The following day Rajapaksa filed an appeal in the Supreme Court against the interim order. On 14 December 2018, the Supreme Court refused to issue an interim order vacating the earlier interim order of the Court of Appeal restricting the functions of the Prime Minister's office, the matter was set down for hearing in mid-January 2019. Following this decision, the Prime Minister indicated his intention to resign. Concerns have been raised over a possibility of a government shutdown similar to those in the United States, without the parliament passing finances for the government spending for the year 2019. Without a lawful finance minister it is unclear if the government's $1 billion foreign debt repayment due in early January can be serviced. Supreme Court rules dissolution of Parliament unconstitutional On 13 December 2018, the Supreme Court ruled that President Sirisena‚Äôs decision to dissolve the Parliament 20 months before the end of its term was unconstitutional. A full (seven-judge) bench unanimously ruled on that the President cannot dissolve Parliament until it completes a four-and-a-half-year term. The court also said the President's decision to call snap elections was illegal. On 14 December in response to the Supreme Court rulings, according to party members, Mahinda Rajapaksa said he would relinquish his claim to be Prime Minister and would back down after an address to the nation on Saturday (15th). Rajapaksa's son Namal wrote in a Twitter post \\"to ensure stability of the nation, Former President Rajapaksa has decided to resign from the Premiership tomorrow after an address to the nation\\". Namal Rajapaksa went on to say \\"his family‚Äôs political party would work with Mr. Sirisena‚Äôs party to form a broader coalition in Parliament\\". Supreme Court refused to vacate Court of Appeal interim order The following day, the Supreme Court also refused to vacate the interim order given by the Court of Appeal restraining Rajapaksa and his cabinet from functioning.SC refuses to vacate CA‚Äôs interim order against MR Rajapaksa relinquishment of his claim and reinstatement of Wickremesinghe On 15 December 2018, Mahinda Rajapaksa signed a letter of resignation as Prime Minister. He stated he has no intention of remaining as Prime Minister without a general election and does not wish to hamper the president forming a new government. Former minister S. B. Dissanayake claimed that Rajapaksa intends to become the Leader of the Opposition while Dinesh Gunawardena intends to become the Chief Opposition Whip. On the same day, it was announced that Wickremesinghe would be reinstated as Prime Minister the next day. Ranil Wickremesinghe was sworn in as Prime Minister at 11:16am on 16 December at the Presidential Secretariat. The UNP has said it will appoint a UNP government but several legislators from the SLFP have expressed interest in joining the new government. Meanwhile, Rajapaksa said he will continue to work with Sirisena to establish a majority or push for a general election. Outcomes Political With the presidential election in 2019 and parliamentary elections in 2020 coming President Sirisena and Rajapaksa's moves to consolidate power backfired due to the political and economic instability during this whole crisis. The turmoil angered many Sri Lankans and weakened both the president and Rajapaksa ahead of the polls. Senior political scientist Jayadeva Uyangoda, called President Sirisena and his party the SLFP the \\"ultimate casualties\\" of the crisis. It saw the split of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party when Rajapaksa and his loyalists broke away from the party days after being appointed Prime Minister and took up membership in the Rajapaksa- backed Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna. Prof. Uyangoda said Sirisena, after the crisis, has no independent power base with his party having been virtually absorbed by the pro-Rajapaksa SLPP. \\"Sirisena has proved to be the country's poorest political leader when it comes to political strategising\\", Prof. Uyangoda told The Hindu. Rajapaksa and his allies continued to demand for early elections, but as they are seen as the chief architects of the recent political turmoil the Rajapaksa family will probably enter any race with considerably less popular support than it had before the crisis. The Rajapaksa's were surprised when they were unable to secure enough votes in Parliament to form a government and have admitted privately that the political crisis has hurt their chances in an election in the urban areas. The crisis saw a central role for the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka. Its significance was huge in restoring constitutional governance for democracy in the country. The greatest outcome of the Supreme Court‚Äôs rulings against President Sirisena is the re-emergence of the judiciary with a clear sense of institutional autonomy and independence. In doing so, it also protected the constitutional protection to the Prime Minister and the Cabinet was ensured as well as the institutional autonomy of the legislature. The two decisions by the Supreme Court in the last week of the crisis were not only landmark judgments but will go on to define judicial verdicts of the future. The crisis which gave the prospect of a new Mahinda Rajapaksa backed government coming to power prompted authorities in United States to publicly disclose money laundering and visa fraud charges against the former Sri Lankan Ambassador to the United States Jaliya Wickramasuriya to ensure that he is swiftly prosecuted before a Rajapaksa administration could restore his diplomatic immunity. Wickramasuriya who is the cousin of Rajapaksa has become the first Rajapaksa relative to be prosecuted abroad. He will face a possible lengthy jail term following five counts of charges ranging from wire fraud to immigration offences. Economic The fragile Sri Lankan economy was badly hurt during the political upheaval with the steep loss in value in its currency, downgrading of its economy and loss in tourist revenue. The economic loss and financial slippage, according to a provisional assessment, caused to the country during this period has exceeded Rs. 102 billion. In January 2019 it was revealed that the crisis cost the country a billion US dollars in reserves. The government on 26 October had $7.991 billion in forex reserves but by the end of this period reserves had depleted to $6.985 billion. The Colombo Stock Exchange recorded some growth during the crisis. However, the rupee reached a record low during the same time, but was boosted by Central Bank dollar sales. The Sri Lankan rupee was ultimately devalued by 3.8% during the 7-week political crisis. USD $312.9 million, in the form of treasury bonds, and US$29.8 million in the form of treasury bills had also gone out of the country. Sri Lanka's credit was also downgraded during the period. On 20 November credit rating agency Moody's released a statement downgrading the Sri Lankan government's foreign currency issuer and senior unsecured ratings to B2 from B1 and changed the outlook to stable from negative. Moody's says the downgrade was driven by the \\"ongoing tightening in external and domestic financing conditions and low reserve adequacy, exacerbated most recently by a political crisis which seems likely to have a lasting impact on policy\\". In the wake of the political crisis and doubts about the future of democracy in the nation, the United States and Japanese governments froze more than a billion US dollars worth of development aid. The European Union also warned that if it did not stick to commitments on national reconciliation, it could withdraw duty-free concessions for Sri Lankan exports. In November industrial activity in Sri Lanka slowed as a result of the crisis. The Index of Industrial Production compiled by the Department of Census and Statistics fell 1.2% to 107.3 points in November when compared to the same time a year earlier. Food production, which contributes 35.2% to overall manufacturing activities fell 2.7% in November. Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products, the third largest industrial production, fell 11.3% compared to a year earlier. Sri Lanka's leading export however, which forms 19.8% of industrial activity, apparel production grew 3.8% and exports of garments during the month grew 9.9%. Coke and refined petroleum production, Sri Lanka's fourth largest manufacturing activity, and rubber and plastic product manufacturing, the fifth largest, also grew 5.8% and 13.3% respectively. Overall the index recorded a 3.7% fall from October to November, the largest seen since it began in 2016. Social The crisis saw the resilience of Sri Lanka‚Äôs democracy among its citizens amid multiple setbacks. Activism by citizens in defence of political freedom, political consciousness, education and participation greatly increased. Activism, participation and resistance was particularly large among young voters, whose political weapons were the use of political humour shared through social media. President Sirisena's betrayal of the 2015 mandate, which opened a democratic space for Sri Lankans, shook and angered many citizens who spontaneously mobilised to defend constitutional governance, democracy, and freedom. 2019 Sri Lanka Easter bombings The political fallout of the constitutional crisis and the bitter infighting between the country's leaders has been questioned by various individuals on whether it may have contributed to a breakdown of the government's functionality contributing to the 2019 Sri Lanka Easter bombings. Protests The UNP held a protest near the Temple Trees on 31 October, where thousands of Sri Lankans have taken to the streets urging President Sirisena to uphold democracy. The JVP held protest rally at Nugegoda on 1 November demanding the president to reconvene parliament immediately and to restore democracy in the country. Tens of thousands of Sri Lankans marched Monday 5 November in support of a new government of Mahinda Rajapaksa and Maithripala Sirisena. Sri Lanka Police estimated 120,000 people attended the rally. Violence Rival groups supporting Mahinda Rajapaksa and Ranil Wickremesinghe have been gathering at different locations around Colombo. Hundreds of supporters of Wickremesinghe have gathered around Temple Trees and say they will stay there to protect the ousted Prime Minister. So far demonstrations have been mostly peaceful, but Speaker Jayasuriya, and others, have warned of a \\"blood bath\\" if Parliament was not permitted to meet and end the constitutional crisis. With the rushed swearing in of Rajapaksa, Rajapaksa loyalists stormed two state-owned television networks which they regarded loyal to Wickremesinghe and the sitting government and forced them off the air. Trade unions linked to Rajapaksa's party have also been blocking access to ministers who are from the United National Party. On Sunday 28 October, the bodyguards of a deposed government minister opened fire on a crowd of protestors resulting in the death of one person. The first reported outbreak of violence occurred at the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC), which houses the headquarters of national oil and gas company, resulted in a shooting between members of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party CPC Trade Union and the personal security detail of deposed petroleum minister, Arjuna Ranatunga. Crowds loyal to the president attempted to prevent Ranatunga from entering the government building in Colombo as he was attempting to retrieve belongings from the CPC offices. One union member was killed and two or three injured by shots fired by a member of the police MSD security detail as the crowd tried to take Ranatunga hostage. Ranatunga was rushed into the building in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. The SLFP CPC Trade Union went on strike until Ranatunga was arrested, causing long queues at filling stations. Ranatunga was dressed in a helmet and camouflage, and escorted by the Special Task Force, dozens of regular police were deployed in order to pacify a still-agitated crowd. He was arrested by police on 30 October, and was subsequently released on bail. The strike was called off. One security member was arrested and an investigation has begun into the incident, police have confirmed. After being rescued by police commandos, later on Sunday speaking to reporters Ranatunga said his bodyguards opened fire because the crowd \\"They came to kill me ‚Äì I state this responsibly ‚Äì and you can check the CCTV footage,\\" \\"For the first time, I feared for my life.

He was inducted into the IFBB Hall of Fame in 2006. Early life \\"Sig\\" Klein was born in 1902 in Toru≈Ñ, Germany (now within Poland), and his family moved to Cleveland, Ohio a year later. A reader of strength magazines, and admirer of his father's muscular arms, Klein began his own weight training at age 12 with an improvised use of window counterweights. By age 17, he was training with a standard set of 100-pound barbells. Gymnasiums in New York In 1924, Klein arrived in New York City and arranged to take over operation of a gymnasium previously owned by Louis Attila, the inventor of the bent press weight training exercise and trainer of pioneering bodybuilder Eugen Sandow. Klein met and later married Attila's daughter Grace. In July 1926, he arranged for Tony Sansone to continue running Attila's gym, and Klein opened his own gym at 207 West 48th Street/717 Seventh Avenue. At only by , Klein's \\"Physical Culture Studio\\" became one of the most well-known gyms in the U.S. in the 1940s and 1950s, and many photo shoots for Joe Weider's magazines were conducted there. He closed his gym for the first time in November 1968 to attend Bob Hoffman's 70th birthday party; it closed permanently after 48 years of operation (circa 1974), though the building was still in use as of 2016. Written work Klein published his own magazine, Klein's Bell, from June 1931 to December 1932, when it merged with Bob Hoffman's new Strength & Health, for which Klein began writing in 1933. In addition to Hoffman's and Weider's magazines, Klein was on the covers of Iron Man, Vim, Edmond Desbonnet's La Culture Physique, and Bernarr Macfadden's Physical Culture magazine. Regarding the regularity of working out, he held the belief that once a bodybuilder is in good shape with sensibly developed muscles, it doesn't take a lot of training to keep it. Referring to himself as an example, Klein wrote in 1969 that his last heavy lifting was at age 35 and he had continued to work out just three times a week from then on, with hour-long sessions. Later life and legacy The organization that became the Association of Oldtime Barbell and Strongmen (AOBS) began with Vic Boff, Leo Murdock, and others putting together a surprise 80th birthday party for Klein in 1982. The strong interest by attendees at this and several followup events solidified the formation of a group that honors old time champions and preserves weightlifting history. Klein died of cancer in 1987 at age 85, survived by his wife and a daughter. He is described in Arnold Schwarzenegger's Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding as a pioneer in giving value to physique, beyond strength alone, as a demonstration of physical health.

Renaud de Pons (fl. 1189‚Äì1228) was a nobleman from the Saintonge. He served as Seneschal of Gascony between 1214 and 1217 and briefly as Seneschal of Poitou in 1216. He went on the Fifth Crusade in 1217‚Äì21. He and his nephew, Renaud II de Pons, are distinguished in contemporary documents by the epithets senior (the elder) and iunior (the younger). He is also known by the epithet Palmarius because he was a crusader. Renaud was the second son of Pons I, lord of Pons, and Germasia. He first appears in the historical record when he consented to a donation of family property made by his elder brother, Geoffroy III, to the Abbey of Saint- Florent de Saumur in 1189. The following year he and his brother confirmed a donation of Richard I, King of England, to the Abbey of La Sauve-Majeure. By June 1214 Renaud was in the following of John, King of England. He was one of the commissioners, along with Hubert de Burgh and Aimery de Rochefort, authorized by John to negotiate a truce with King Philip Augustus of France. The result was the Truce of Chinon that ended the war between England and France on 18 September 1214. Renaud and his nephew stood among the guarantors of the treaty. Earlier that year, with Aimery VII of Thouars and Savari de Maul√©on among others, he had guaranteed the peace treaty between John and the count of La Marche, Hugh IX. Renaud was appointed seneschal of Gascony in 1214, replacing Geoffrey de Neville. John also granted Renaud the wardship of Theobald le Botiller and custody of his lands of Weeton, Treules and Routhcliffe in Ireland. Henry, Archbishop of Dublin, was also requested in August 1214 to hand over the castles of Dorles, Rashue, Loshe, Armolen and Kakaulis which belonged to Theobald Walter in Ireland. Renaud received a royal instruction dated 20 November ordering him to \\"extirpate\\" heretics‚ÄîCathars‚Äîwhose heresy was spreading. In 1216, John's successor, Henry III, sent a letter to Renaud demanding he renew the oath of fealty he had taken before John. In it he addressed Renaud as lord of P√©rignac and seneschal of Gascony and Poitou. A report written for Henry III in 1235, long after Renaud's death, suggests that Renaud's government of Gascony was harsh even for non-heretics. In May 1217, in order to allow Renaud to fulfill a vow to go on a pilgrimage, Henry III appointed the archbishop of Bordeaux, Guillaume Amanieu, as Seneschal of Gascony and Poitou in his absence. According to Pope Honorius III, writing in 1219, Renaud's vow to go to the Holy Land was a pretext to put off handing over to Henry the castle of Merpins and the hostages which Henry's father had entrusted to him. Honorius was writing to the bishop of Angoul√™me, the abbot of Nanteuil and the deacon of the cathedral of Bordeaux asking them to intervene with Renaud and threaten him with excommunication if he did not hand over what was not his. The pope accused Renaud of conspiring with his brother, Pons, bishop of Saintes, to retain his hold on Merpins. Renaud joined the Fifth Crusade and fought at the Siege of Damietta, where he was singled out by Matthew of Paris for his actions during the assault of 29 August 1219. Renaud last appears as a confirmant to a charter of his nephew in 1228. He affixed his seal to the charter.

Biography Raised on her family's ranch outside Calgary, Ostrom grew up listening to country artists such as George Strait, The Dixie Chicks, and Alan Jackson. At the onset of her musical career, she made the decision to perform under a stage name. \\"My real name is not a secret but I decided to take on another name mostly because I feel that my real name is not that memorable...I started thinking about titles that would reflect my music and I was thinking about how I would describe it and it was all very rootsy and tenacious and organic and it all lent itself to this sort of tree flavour and I thought, well maybe there's a tree name that would help us with titling this thing. And, honestly, sycamore was one of the first that I looked at and thought it was cool.\\" Sykamore received first prize in the ATB Financial All-Albertan Songwriting contest, with her original song, \\"Heaven in the Pines.\\" Her song I Can Make You Happy was featured on Season 8 of the Canadian television series Heartland. In 2015 she was nominated for the Canadian Country Music Association Discovery Award. In 2017, Sykamore signed with Home Team Publishing in Nashville after being discovered on Twitter by Rhett Akins, one of the company's co-founders (along with son Thomas Rhett.

Sykamore was the first artist to sign with the label partnership. In an article in Music Row Magazine, Knox was quoted as saying, \\"We couldn‚Äôt be prouder to have her as our first signing.

It is a relatively rare howardite with some carbonaceous inclusions that were likely a result of an asteroid collision. Therefore, despite its small size, it has been a subject of several scientific studies. History The meteorite was obtained by Julian Simashko, a Russian zoologist and entomologist interested in meteorites. After the death of Simashko, his heirs sold the meteorite collection (about 400 specimens) to Henry Augustus Ward for 30,000 gold rubles. This collection, including the main fragment of Jodzie meteorite weighing , was obtained by the Field Museum of Natural History. Fragments of the meteorite are held by several museums: by the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, by the Russian Academy of Sciences, by the Natural History Museum in London, fragments by the National Museum of Natural History in Paris and Natural History Museum in Vienna, by the Natural History Museum in Berlin, by the National Museum of Natural History in Washington. The fate of other fragments is unknown. Analysis Jodzie is classified as a howardite. As other gas-rich meteorites, it consists of light parts mixed with darker material that contains a large amounts of primordial rare gases. The light part (Eucritic or basaltic material) is primarily composed of sodium, calcium, aluminosilicate. The dark part (Diogenitic material) is primarily composed of pyroxene, magnesium, iron, and aluminosilicate. Further, Jodzie has several clasts of ferrogabbro and is composed (about 8% of volume) of small CM and CR carbonaceous chondrite-like inclusions, which are not typically found in HED meteorites. Thus, despite its small size, Jodzie displays a great variety of minerals. Studies identified the presence of 25 different minerals, including enstatite, ferrosilite, serpentine group, barringerite, diopside, fayalite, ferrosilite, magnetite, pentlandite, pyrrhotite. Analysis of the noble gases revealed that Jodzie has all five noble gases and is similar to the Kapoeta meteorite (fell in 1942 in South Sudan) except that Jodzie has significantly more of helium-3 and neon-21 isotopes. The inclusions of carbonaceous material and the abundance of primordial gases were likely a result of a low-velocity collision between asteroids ‚Äì an object (asteroid or comet) bombarded by the solar wind brought carbonaceous material and the gases to the host and the materials mixed during the impact.

It was designed by Ernest de Burgh. The property is owned by Roads and Maritime Services, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 June 2000.  History  Timber truss bridges Timber truss road bridges have played a significant role in the expansion and improvement of the NSW road network. Prior to the bridges being built, river crossings were often dangerous in times of rain, which caused bulk freight movement to be prohibitively expensive for most agricultural and mining produce. Only the high priced wool clip of the time was able to carry the costs and inconvenience imposed by the generally inadequate river crossings that often existed prior to the trusses construction. Timber truss bridges were preferred by the Public Works Department from the mid 19th to the early 20th century because they were relatively cheap to construct, and used mostly local materials. The financially troubled governments of the day applied pressure to the Public Works Department to produce as much road and bridge work for as little cost as possible, using local materials. This condition effectively prohibited the use of iron and steel, as these, prior to the construction of the steel works at Newcastle in the early 20th century, had to be imported from England. Ernest de Burgh, the designer of DeBurgh truss and other bridges, was a leading engineer with the Public Works Department, and a prominent figure in early 20th century NSW. Timber truss bridges, and timber bridges generally were so common that NSW was known to travellers as the \\"timber bridge state\\". Beckers Bridge The bridge was advertised for tender in 1901, with W. T. Oakes the successful contractor with a tender of A¬£1,875, and completed in 1902. It replaced the need to cross the river at water-level, which had been dangerous at higher levels. A 2011 report profiling timber truss road bridges found that Beckers Bridge could not be upgraded to a required standard and would need to be replaced. Following this, the 2012 Roads and Maritime Services Timber Truss Bridge Conservation Strategy identified Beckers Bridge as a target to be removed and replaced in the future. It stated that, although all submissions received had been in support of its retention, it could not meet the load requirements necessary for the route and described it as \\"an unremarkable example of its type\\". In 2017, Michael Johnsen, the local MP in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, published a call for feedback on the design and alignment of a new bridge, after the completion of which the original bridge would be demolished. In 2018, its State Heritage Register listing refers to it as \\"under consideration for removal\\".  Description  Becker's Bridge is a DeBurgh type timber truss road bridge. It has a single timber truss span of . There is a single timber approach span at each end giving the bridge an overall length of . The superstructure is supported by timber trestles and provides a carriage way with a minimum width of . The guard rail is of timber post and rail construction and extends the full length of the bridge.  Heritage listing  Completed in 1902, Beckers Bridge is an early example of a DeBurgh timber truss road bridge. In 1998 it was in good condition. As a timber truss road bridge, it has many associational links with important historical events, trends, and people, including the expansion of the road network and economic activity throughout NSW, and Ernest DeBurgh, the designer of this type of truss. DeBurgh trusses were fourth in the five stage design evolution of NSW timber truss road bridges. Designed by Public Works engineer Ernest M. DeBurgh, the DeBurgh truss is an adaptation of the American Pratt truss design. The DeBurgh truss is the first to use significant amounts of steel and iron, and did so in spite of its high cost and the government's historical preference for timber. DeBurgh trusses were significant technical improvements over their predecessors. Situated in the Hunter region, Beckers bridge gains heritage significance because of its proximity to 15 other historic bridges, each constructed before 1905. In 1998 there were 10 surviving DeBurgh trusses in NSW of the 20 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built. The Beckers bridge is a representative example of DeBurgh timber truss road bridges, and is assessed as being State significant, primarily on the basis of its technical and historical significance. Beckers Bridge over Webbers Creek was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Through the bridge's association with the expansion of the NSW road network, its ability to demonstrate historically important concepts such as the gradual acceptance of NSW people of American design ideas, and its association with Ernest DeBurgh, it has historical significance. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The bridge exhibits the technical excellence of its design, as all of the structural detail is clearly visible. In the context of its landscape it is visually attractive. As such, the bridge has a small amount of aesthetic significance. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Timber truss bridges are prominent to road travellers, and NSW has in the past been referred to as the \\"timber truss bridge state\\". Through this, the complete set of bridges gain some social significance, as they could be said to be held in reasonable esteem by many travellers in NSW. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The bridge is rare - an early example of DeBurgh trusses. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The bridge is representative of DeBurgh truss bridges.

Ward is considered to have been a central leader of African American religious activity in nineteenth-century America and has been referred to as ‚Äúthe original trailblazer of African Methodism‚Äù. In 1854, he took over leadership of an A.M.E. church in San Francisco. Ward was also the first representative of the church to work on the Pacific coast.  Childhood/Early Life  Ward was born September 28, 1823 in Hanover, Pennsylvania. His parents and grandparents had escaped from slavery and moved to Pennsylvania, where they became active in the Underground Railroad. His uncle also Samuel Ringgold Ward . Ward grew up in Philadelphia, where he joined the A.M.E church in 1838 at age 15.  Start of church career  At age 20, he received his license to preach and joined the New England Conference in 1846. Ward became a church elder in 1849. Ward soon became a member of the AME church hierarchy in Pennsylvania . He was then was elected secretary of the New England Conference for the territories within the national church. During this conference, Ward broached the idea of a \\"California mission\\". The church sent him to San Francisco to accomplish it.  San Francisco mission  When Ward arrived in San Francisco, he found the AME church to be very small and impoverished. He was forced to find outside work to survive. He lived in a small complex on 532 Bush Ln. Soon after his arrival, the church was attacked by an arsonist in 1854. Ward not only faced racial hatred, but also what he felt was a materialistic culture engendered by the California Gold Rush. The Gold Rush brought apparent ‚Äúwickedness‚Äù according to Charles Spencer Smith. Ward believed that he was in a struggle for power with the gold miners and other groups that did not value Christian morals.. Ward became involved in the campaign to Archy Lee. Lee had been transported from Georgia to Sacramento. In 1867, Ward helped raise $50,000 dollars for legals costs of three trials that eventually emancipated Lee. Ward later spent $3,050 to stop Lee's former owner from kidnapping him back to Georgia. After the beginning of the American Civil War, Ward was president of the California Contraband Relief Association and provided funds for the care of the freedmen. In the mid 1860s Ward was elected as Bishop to the Pacific Coast at the church's annual conference. Ward acted as a delegate to and was also the chair of the education committee of the Colored convention of California.  In Georgia  In his later years, Ward returned frequently to the Northeastern United States to preach He was finally reassigned to the fifth district of the church in Georgia. In Georgia, he presided over numerous general conferences that were held there. In 1875, the church invited white Americans to the conference for the first time. In one of his sermons, Ward preached of the importance of education and stated, \\"Encourage learning and you will live; despise it and you will die\\". Ward was often described as \\"old man eloquent\\". Another common description made by his colleagues was that he was an overweight man who charmed his audiences with a resonate voice and was a man of courage. In the late 1870s, Freedmen University was founded and one of the halls was named Ward Hall after him for his work with African-American youth. In 1886, Ward created a coalition of religious figures dedicated to the study of learning. In June 1894, Ward died in Jacksonville, Florida and was buried in Washington D.C.

History  The history of N-OFDM signals theory was started in 1992 from the Patent of Russian Federation No. 2054684. In this patent, Vadym Slyusar proposed the 1st method of optimal processing for N-OFDM signals after Fast Fourier transform (FFT). In this regard need to say that W. Kozek and A. F.

Advantages of N-OFDM  Despite the increased complexity of demodulating N-OFDM signals compared to OFDM, the transition to non-orthogonal subcarrier frequency arrangement provides several advantages: # higher spectral efficiency, which allows to reduce the frequency band occupied by the signal and improve the electromagnetic compatibility of many terminals; # adaptive detuning from interference concentrated in frequency by changing the nominal frequencies of the subcarriersVasilii A.

This composite baseband signal is typically used to modulate a main RF carrier. \\\\scriptstyle s[n] is a serial stream of binary digits. By inverse multiplexing, these are first demultiplexed into \\\\scriptstyle N parallel streams, and each one mapped to a (possibly complex) symbol stream using some modulation constellation (QAM, PSK, etc.). Note that the constellations may be different, so some streams may carry a higher bit- rate than others. A Digital Signal Processor (DSP) is computed on each set of symbols, giving a set of complex time-domain samples. These samples are then quadrature-mixed to passband in the standard way. The real and imaginary components are first converted to the analogue domain using digital-to- analogue converters (DACs); the analogue signals are then used to modulate cosine and sine waves at the carrier frequency, \\\\scriptstyle f_c, respectively. These signals are then summed to give the transmission signal, \\\\scriptstyle s(t).  Demodulation   Receiver  800px The receiver picks up the signal \\\\scriptstyle r(t), which is then quadrature-mixed down to baseband using cosine and sine waves at the carrier frequency. This also creates signals centered on \\\\scriptstyle 2 f_c, so low-pass filters are used to reject these. The baseband signals are then sampled and digitised using analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), and a forward FFT is used to convert back to the frequency domain. This returns \\\\scriptstyle N parallel streams, which use in appropriate symbol detector.

As example of FBMC can consider Wavelet N-OFDM.  Wavelet N-OFDM  N-OFDM has become a technique for power-line communications (PLC). In this area of research, a wavelet transform is introduced to replace the DFT as the method of creating non-orthogonal frequencies. This is due to the advantages wavelets offer, which are particularly useful on noisy power lines. To create the sender signal the wavelet N-OFDM uses a synthesis bank consisting of a \\\\textstyle N-band transmultiplexer followed by the transform function : F_n(z) = \\\\sum_{k=0}^{L-1} f_n(k) z^{-k}, \\\\quad 0 \\\\leq n < N On the receiver side, an analysis bank is used to demodulate the signal again. This bank contains an inverse transform : G_n(z) = \\\\sum_{k=0}^{L-1} g_n(k) z^{-k}, \\\\quad 0 \\\\leq n < N followed by another \\\\textstyle N-band transmultiplexer.\\\\ The relationship between both transform functions is : f_n(k) = g_n(L - 1 - k) : F_n(z) = z^{-(L-1)} G_n * (z-1)  Spectrally efficient FDM (SEFDM)  N-OFDM is a spectrally efficient method.Safa Isam A Ahmed.

Like most positional games, it is described by its set of positions/points/elements (X) and a family of sets (\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\- a family of subsets of X). It is played by two players, called Balancer and Unbalancer. Each player in turn picks an element. The goal of Balancer is to ensure that every set in \\\\mathcal{F} is balanced, i.e., the elements in each set are distributed roughly equally between the players. The goal of Unbalancer is to ensure that at least one set is unbalanced. Formally, the goal of balancer is defined by a vector (b_1,\\\\ldots,b_n) where n is the number of sets in \\\\mathcal{F}. Balancer wins if in every set i, the difference between the number of elements taken by Balancer and the number of elements taken by Unbalancer is at most bi.

He married into money, as his father had done, and thereafter spent his life trying to dispose of his fortune to the benefit of religious, educational and medical causes in England and abroad. A zealot, long widowed and childless, his domestic life was frugal and he left nothing to his family.  Life  Samuel Warneford was born in 1763, possibly in the village of Sevenhampton, near Highworth in Wiltshire, England. His father, an ordained minister called Francis Warneford, came from a long-established but often penurious landowning family whose family seat was Warneford Place, in Sevenhampton, where they owned all of the land. The family's finances had been much improved when Francis married his second wife, Catherine, the daughter of a wealthy London-based drug merchant; after her death, he married Samuel's mother, also called Catherine. Samuel was the younger of two sons and also had at least two sisters, who never married and lived with him in adult life. From 1779, Warneford attended University College, Oxford, from where he was awarded a BA degree in 1783 and an MA in 1786. He was ordained in 1787 and became curate at what is now called Brize Norton and was then known as Norton Broyne, supplementing his qualifications with the degree of BCL in 1790. He was vicar at Bures St. Mary in Suffolk from 1795 to 1798. In September 1796, like his father, Samuel married into money: his wife, Margaret, was a daughter of Edward Loveden Loveden, a cheese merchant and Member of Parliament. Margaret's father objected to the arrangement but its progression brought together the fortunes of two families and was then further enhanced by a legacy of ¬£34,000 left to his sickly wife by her grandfather. She died, insane and childless, three years after the marriage. Thereafter, Warneford developed a reputation for eccentricity and for a parsimonious domestic lifestyle, as well as for his philanthropy. Warneford's views on religious matters were zealous, fierce even, and he had a dislike for those who believed differently. His friend and biographer, Thomas Vaughan, noted that he saw \\"the subtle designs of the Jesuits, and the insidious intrusion of malignant dissenters\\" as the most significant challenge to his philanthropic endeavours. He bought the advowsons of Lydiard Millicent, in Wiltshire, and Bourton-on-the-Hill, in Gloucestershire, in 1809 and 1810, respectively. It was also in 1810 that he was awarded a DCL degree. He retained the rectorship of Lydiard Millicent until his death in 1855, although he sold the advowson to Pembroke College, Oxford in 1828. In additional to these clerical interests, he was appointed an honorary canon of Gloucester Cathedral in 1844. Described as shy, puny and delicate as a child, Warneford was also considered reclusive as an adult, despite having to undertake considerable amounts of travel to oversee his benefactions. His dress was generally outmoded, his house unkempt, and the horses that he relied upon to draw his carriage for his many miles of travel were bought when they were old and past their best. Always attentive to his legacy, he left many codicils to his will, which omitted his family just as he had refused them charity during his lifetime. He was not unaware of his nature, describing himself on one occasion as \\"a miser - a calculating miser\\". Warneford died on 11 January 1855 at his rectory in Bourton, aged 92, and was buried in the church there. He may have had regrets as he lay dying, saying that \\"I should have been kinder, I should have been more considerate and understanding.\\"  Philanthropy  W. M. Priest notes that \\"It seems that [Warneford] did not want the huge fortune he acquired and deliberately spent his life getting rid of it.\\" He was astute as well as rich, spreading his philanthropy wide across the fields of religion, education and healthcare. But he considered his donation of money, or the refusal of it, to be a carrot-and-stick affair, whereby worthy projects were rewarded and the unworthy punished. According to historian William Whyte he could be \\"tyrannical\\" in his attempts to control the use of his money and his donations were often made incrementally so that he could monitor progress and, in particular, remedy perceived problems. He favoured the practical over the ostentatious and spread his beneficence not only in his own country but also to religious causes in places such as Africa, Australia, New Zealand and Nova Scotia. Locally, Warneford spent ¬£1,000 refitting his own church in Bourton and also a similar sum on that of the church at the nearby Moreton-in-Marsh. There and throughout the rest of the Gloucester diocese, he financed the building of schools and the provision of medical aid, while in Bourton he also provided facilities for older people. On the other hand, he fell out with his parishioners at Lydiard Millicent when they objected to his attempts to increase the tithe and the church there fell into disrepair as he refused to spend money on it despite it being his responsibility to do so. Other fundings with religious connections included donations to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge and the Corporation for the Sons of the Clergy which, combined with bequests at his death, amounted to ¬£200,000. He also donated the land for the Clergy Orphan School, near Canterbury, and again remembered it in his will, in this case with a ¬£13,000 legacy. As well as being a governor of Oxford's Radcliffe Infirmary, he sat on committees there and gave money and property together worth over ¬£70,000 for the development of a new asylum for lunatics. His considerable and detailed interest in that project may have been spurred by his wife's insanity: he had rejected suggestions that she should be hospitalised, preferring to nurse her at home after being appalled during his inspections of several possible institutes. Originally known as the Radcliffe Asylum, his kickstarting of the project from 1831, when he became impatient that things had been dragging since 1812, resulted in the institution later bearing the name Warneford Lunatic Asylum from 1843. Another significant involvement in healthcare provision was his ¬£3,000 contribution towards the building of Warneford, Leamington, and South Warwickshire Hospital, which represented 75 per cent of the cost. Despite some later misgivings about what he considered to be financial extravagance at the hospital, which was then mainly a hydrotherapy facility, he bequeathed ¬£10,000 to it on his death. At King's College, London he provided money for medical scholarships and also for prizes intended to encourage religious development among its students. The concern for the religious attentions of medical students was a common theme, for Warneford believed them to be an ungodly lot, saying on one occasion that \\"What is said about the absorbing nature of a medical student's pursuits is but too true, and it is one of the evils which most requires remedy, it is this which narrows their minds and makes them bigots to low infidel views\\". Although certainly eccentric in many ways, his fears did have some basis in accepted wisdom because among the radical thinkers of the era were many who possessed a medical background. From 1838, he followed a similar course to that adopted at King's in his dealings with the Birmingham Royal Medical School, later known as Queen's College, Birmingham, where his efforts were instrumental in bringing higher education to the city. His gifts to the value of ¬£25,000 provided for chaplaincies as well as scholarships, a professorial chair in pastoral theology and new buildings. His involvement ensured that Queen's was an exclusively Anglican institution and as much a seminary as a medical school but his interest in the project was somewhat neglected at his death because of his concern that it had not developed according to his expectations. Of those expectations he noted \\"the inculcation of sound religious principles has been, and is, the basis of my donations either to your Hospital or your College ...

It is a large-scale, 3D, sci-fi, mobile shooter and is said to feature distinctive gameplay content. Gameplay The gameplay is derived from traditional battle royale gameplay tactics, which is, players will have to compete with each other and be the last one standing. The distinctions include: Players fly from spaceship onto a map area in their respective spacecraft instead of being dropped from an airplane. They can decide when and where to land on the battlefield. All resources are searched and retrieved from the map to fight other competitors. The last one standing will be the winner. The game features sci-fi characters, weapons, vehicles and battlefields. Also, players can cultivate their own characters with in-game chips. Development Closed Beta Test The game was announced on 24 October 2018 in a thread on the official website of Xiaomi asking their fans to aid them in the production by applying for beta-testing campaign called Closed Beta Test. 31 October 2018 was mentioned as the last date to apply for the same but they had to close the campaign earlier because they got enough applicants for now and asked players to stay tuned for the next one in case they missed signing up for it. Reception Soundtrack was strikingly similar to that of PUBG Mobile. The characters had a sci-fi cartoony look like Overwatch. The futuristic look of airplane used to jump-off to the battlefield resembled Halo. The map was distinct from Erangel of PUBG Mobile in layout and design of the structures. Vehicles include huge flying saucers which resembled Wasps from Halo. Most weapons were named after their real-life equivalents but had no distinction, such as recoil, like blasters from Star Wars: Battlefront. Marketing The success of mobile variants of battle royale games like PUBG and Fortnite in 2018 led to the creation of many other games of the same genre, with little to no distinction, which also inspired Xiaomi to go in the same field.

Discovery The earliest excavations on the site were undertaken in 1981 by Naomi Field and Mike Parker Pearson, who discovered an Iron Age timber causeway with Iron Age and Roman votive offerings associated with it. The 2001 excavations uncovered more of the timber causeway, used during the Iron Age by the Corieltavi tribe to deposit valuable objects into the waters as ritual offerings. The Witham Shield may have been one such object. The Fiskerton log boat was made from a single oak tree trunk, and still bears axe marks from its manufacture. It was deliberately sunk as an offering and may have been specially made for this purpose. The process of the excavation at Fiskerton was the subject of a 'Meet the Ancestors Special' entitled 'Celtic Causeway', first aired on 27 March 2002. Description The boat measures approximately 6 m in length and was worked from a single oak tree trunk. It has a bowed bow and a square stern, closed by a board slotted into a groove. This type of boat most likely would have been used to travel along rivers, transporting goods. Significance The causeway has been dated using dendrochronology to date between 457/6-300 BC. As well as a second Iron Age boat, other votive offerings from the excavations include: a complete spear, a currency bar, a sword, a dagger, and some bronze fittings. Public display The boat first went on public display in March 2006 at The Collection, Lincoln.

It is native to areas from Asia through Southeast Asia to New Guinea and northern Australia. It is a deciduous, terrestrial herb with one or two grass-like leaves and up to ten dull pink, more or less drooping flowers. It grows in wet, grassy places in forests and woodlands. Description Pachystoma pubescens is a deciduous, terrestrial herb with one or two dark green, linear, pleated, sharply pointed leaves long and wide. Between four and ten resupinate, dull pink, more or less tubular, drooping flowers long and wide are borne on a flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal is long, about wide and the lateral sepals are a similar length but wide with a humped base. The petals are a similar length to the sepals but narrower. The labellum is long and wide with three lobes. The middle lobe has a square tip and pimply surface and the side lobes curve upwards. Flowering occurs in November and December in Australia and March to September in Asia. Taxonomy and naming Pachystoma pubescens was first described in 1825 by Carl Ludwig Blume, in his Bijdragen tot de Flora van Nederlandsch Indie. The specific epithet (pubescens) is derived from the Latin word pubesco meaning \\"put on the down of puberty\\" with the ending -escens meaning \\"beginning of\\" or \\"becoming\\", hence \\"pubescent\\". Distribution and habitat The pink kunal orchid often grows with grasses such as kunai grass (Imperata cylindrica) in woodland and forest areas that are seasonally wet. It occurs in China, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, New Guinea, the Philippines, Vietnam and in Australia where it is found in northern parts of the Northern Territory and in Tropical North Queensland.

The area, some 15 miles in length and 8 miles in breadth, is triangulated with the villages of Khatt and Habhab to the North; Adhen to the East and Dhaid to the South. To the West the plain is enclosed by sand dunes. The soil of the Jiri plain is darkened by debris brought down by seasonal waters from the mountains, which helps to define its rich, loamy character and high carbonate content (from the outwash of Cretaceous limestone). The plan is thickly populated by acacia (Acacia tortilis) and ghaf trees, as well as tamarisk and other hardy varieties. A number of deep aquifers run under the plain. The settled population of the area at the time of Lorimer's 1915 Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf was some 1,000 strong, mostly members of the tribes of Awanat, Mazari, Naqbiyin, Sharqiyin (in the area of Wadi Ham) and some Zaab. The area was home to Bedouin of the Ghafalah, Bani Qitab and the Khawatir section of the Na'im, who had been pushed north by their rivals, the Bani Kaab.

It is found in the coastal waters of the eastern Atlantic Ocean off the western coast of Africa, as far north as Mauritania, and into the western Indian Ocean. Description The grooved mullet has a total of five spines in its dorsal fins and eight or nine soft rays, the anal fin has three spines and eight or nine soft rays. The anal fin and the lower lobe of the caudal fin are coloured whitish or greyish. The body is coated in ctenoid scales apart from the scales in front of the anterior dorsal fin which are cycloid, extending to the front nostril or slightly beyond it. Its scales are small and numerous and there are 33‚Äì41 scales in a longitudinal series, not including those on the caudal peduncle, and 11‚Äì14 scale rows between pelvic and anterior dorsal fin. It grows up to in length. Distribution The grooved mullet is found on the Atlantic coast of Africa from Mauritania in the north to the mouth of the Cunene River in Namibia. An allopatric population is found in the south-western Indian Ocean from False Bay in the Western Cape to southern Mozambique. Habitat and ecology The grooved mullet is found in brackish and marine waters in estuaries and coastal shallows. It is a very adaptable species and has been recorded in both freshwater and hypersaline environments. Spawning occurs offshore and the fry move inshore while feeding on zooplankton. The adults sift food such as organic detritus, blue-green algae, diatoms, gastropods, and foraminifera from the substrate, usually coarse sand. Uses The grooved mullet is fished for by commercial fisheries and mullets are used in aquaculture in Africa but it is not known if this involves this species. More research is needed to determine the conservation status of the grooved mullet and of its taxonomy. Taxonomy and naming The two populations of grooved mullet are allopatric, and genetic sampling showed that haplotypes from West Africa were very different from those sampled in South Africa and that the two populations should be treated as sister species. The Atlantic species would retain the name Chelon dumerili as the type locality is Saint-Louis, Senegal while the name Chelon natalensis (Castelnau, 1861) or C. canaliculatus (J.L.B. Smith, 1935) have been suggested for the Indian Ocean taxon, although pending taxonomic revision this taxon has been designated as Chelon Species B. The specific name honours the French ichthyologist and herpetologist Auguste Dum√©ril (1812‚Äì1870) of the Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle who lent Franz Steindachner specimens of fishes collected in Senegal.

In total, they were convicted of committing of 17 serious crimes and both sentenced to life imprisonment.  Lives before the murders  Dana B√°bikov√° was born in Slovakia, where she married at the age of 15. A year later, a daughter was born. Due to marital issues she soon divorced and moved to the Czech Republic, where she married a second time. She and her second husband traveled to Canada, where she worked as a bar dancer. In 1997, she was raped by a fellow employee and, in her words, she suffered from psychological trauma and then began to heavily abuse drugs. Due to this, her second marriage also ended in divorce. She then moved to her mother's house in Slavo≈°ov in the Kutn√° Hora District, in house number 31, where she married the four times court-sentenced Jaroslav Stodola, whom she met in 1998. He came from a troubled family, and in his youth he ran away from his home and soon became self-sufficient. He was known as a quiet man, who only behaved aggressively when drunk. The pair were unable to find a stable job and quickly got into financial trouble.WOMAN-IN: When women murder - Dana Stodolov√°  Crimes  On 30 September 2001, the disguised spouses went to the house of 77-year-old Alois Mi≈°kovsk√Ω from Chabe≈ôice, who was known for lending money. They threatened him with a knife and forced him to give them 160,000 crowns. The couple then tied him up and left him in the house, where he was discovered in a very bad condition two days later. Mi≈°kovsk√Ω died less than a year later. On 16 November 2001, the Stodolas decided to rob their 75-year-old neighbor Jaroslav ≈†anda from Slavo≈°ov, who was staying with Dana's mother. While Jaroslav sneaked out of the house in the early morning, Dana talked to her mother in the kitchen, assuring her that her husband is still asleep. He jumped ≈†anda's fence and hid so that he had a view of the main entrance. He then put on a wig and nylon stockings on his face, and proceeded to enter ≈†anda's house while he was in the barn. Jaroslav hid behind a curtain in the main hall, and when ≈†anda returned, he was knocked down and forced to give his attacker 40,000 crowns. But while handing over the money, ≈†anda pulled the stocking off from Stodola's face, and he strangled the pensioner in fear. Stodola then placed the body in a bed and lit some of the candles, before stealing a few items and running away. One of the candles caused a fire that destroyed the house. During the autopsy of the body, the doctor did not report any head injury and failed to notice any traces of strangulation. Since ≈†anda, in spite of his death, would rather burn his house than leave it to his children, his case was closed in 2002 as death without any external factors. On 28 November 2001, Dana entered the house of 68-year-old neighbor R≈Ø≈æena Skohoutilov√°, who was known to possess valuable jewelry. While Jaroslav was watching in front of the house, Dana attacked the pensioner with a rod inside. They then both tied her up and beat her, asking to point where she was hiding her money. When Skohoutilov√° refused, the Stodolovis suffocated her with a scarf and pillow. Under her bed they found 50,000 crowns and stole some other things, before burying the body in the garden together with some papers and several daily necessities. They wanted to create the impression that the woman had gone on a vacation somewhere. The body of Skohoutilov√° was discovered by her son-in-law on May 4, 2002, during reconstruction of the house. The police accused a trio of men who robbed retirees in the neighborhood of her murder, as they had attempted to rob the woman one week before her death, which she had mentioned to Dana's mother. It later turned out that the reason for her murder was that she had seen who was Jaroslav ≈†anda's killer. On 30 April 2002, the spouses asked for water in front of the house of 66-year-old Antonin Kr√°l in the village of Mƒõchonice. When he opened the door, he was pushed inside the house. There, he and his 62-year-old wife Marie were tied up, and each led to a separate room where they were forced to say where they were hiding their money. When Marie revealed the locations, both she and her husband were strangled by the Stodolas with a lamp cable. The bodies were untied and the gas stove was released. Dana walked out of the door with Jaroslav behind her, locking the house and stretching out from the toilet window. The dead couple were soon discovered by relatives, whom the neighbors informed of their disappearance. As a preliminary cause of death, suffocation by gas from the stove was determined. However, as it could have been a sloppy installation, investigators ordered an autopsy report. Although traces of strangulation were noted on the bodies, suffocation was put out as the official cause of death. The police also made a number of mistakes in the investigation, especially with ignoring the opinion of forensics experts. Another murder was committed by Dana, without her husband being involved. On 14 September 2002, she traveled to Jind≈ôich≈Øv Hradec in search of a job and accommodation, before going towards Karda≈°ova ≈òeƒçice. There she met 78-year- old Maria ƒåondlov√°, whose trust was won by the story of being a victim of the floods in Prague. The woman let Dana sleep in her house, and when she came from shopping the next day, she caught her visitor searching for her. Dana attacked the woman, overcoming her and tying her to a chair. She then demanded that ƒåondlov√° tell her where she keeps her money. When she refused, Dana put a gag in her mouth, and hit her twice on the head with a roller pin before stabbing in the chest four times. Afterwards, she searched through the house, cleaned it and then slept there for another night. Police investigated this case from the beginning as a murder, and even though they received a description of the offender, the search for her identity proved unsuccessful. On 28 October 2002, the pair attacked 81-year-old Josef Malin≈Ø, who lived in the house opposite them. Malin≈Ø often boasted in public about having big amounts of monetary savings in his house. They waited for him to open the door in the morning so they could venture in. Jaroslav stunned the man with a heavy blow to the head and then brought him to the ground, where he tried to strangle him with a phone cord behind a beam. But the cable broke off and Malin≈Ø fell to the floor. Stodola then began kicking him in anger, and again tried to hang the body over the beam, but was unsuccessful. The couple then took 10,000 crowns from the house, but could not find the savings worth 2 million. Due to more mistakes in the investigation, there was no suspicion of foul play and Malin≈Ø's death was ruled as a suicide. On 2 December 2002, the Stodolas broke into the Brnƒõnec home of 92-year-old Bo≈æena Cerh√°kov√°, whom lived with her 52-year-old daughter Helena. Helena had planned to buy the dormitory that the Stodolas lived in at the time, and due to this, they assumed that she was rich. At the time of the burglary, Bo≈æena's other daughter, 62-year-old Dagmar Weiss, was visiting her. Dagmar tried to defend her mother, but she was beaten and tied up by Jaroslav. Helena then forced her sister to reveal where the money and savings were. The pair then decided to kill the three women, with Jaroslav strangling Dagmar with a scarf. He then lounged Bo≈æena on her bed and suffocated her with a pillow, before taking Helena to the bathroom and strangling her in the tub. After he left, Dana poured water and Helena's wrist to make it look like she had killed Dagmar and then committed suicide, leading to her mother's heart failure. Dana then went out from the main entrance and Jaroslav climbed out of the locked flat through a window above the main entrance. However, Bo≈æena had managed to survive the attack, and gave a very incoherent testimony, describing the offender as a tall man living in the hostel. The story was repeatedly connected to Jaroslav Stodola, who surprisingly told investigators he knew he was \\"suspected\\" of murder. However, according to the prosecutor, there was not enough evidence to accuse him of anything.Jarom√≠r Slu≈°n√Ω - Black Book of Czech Bestial Murderers: The Killers They Wanted (184 - 205); XYZ Publishing House, Prague, 2006  Arrest, trial and sentence  Jaroslav's psychological condition rapidly deteriorated after the murders in Brnƒõnec, later attempting suicide by taking sedatives in combination with alcohol. However, his wife managed to save him, and he soon recovered. Jaroslav later learned of a rich pensioner who lived in On≈°ovec, and at the end of January, the pair went to the place of the alleged residence, but could not locate the house. On 3 February 2003, he deliberately tarnished his wife with mud in front of 78-year-old Josef Peroutka's home in Hr√°dek. Jaroslav then rang the door and asked for water for his pregnant wife, who supposedly fainted in front of the house. He then asked the old man if the could sit on the stairs in front of the entrance and take some rest. When the retiree pushed through the gate, Jaroslav threatened him with a knife and forced him to enter the basement, where they locked him and speedily searched through the house, but only stole a cell phone and some sweets. While leaving, the encountered a policeman who had previously carried out investigations in connection with the suspected series of seniors' death in Slavo≈°ov and the surrounding area. Stodola was then arrested because of his criminal past. The policeman knew that the pair had stayed for a long time in a hostel in Brnƒõnec and therefore asked why they were there. Jaroslav did not give satisfactory answers. Meanwhile, Josef Peroutka had managed to exit the basement on his own and reported the robbery by phone. Stodola admitted his crimes, but tried to downplay Dana's part in the crimes. On the basis of this crime, the double murder investigation in Brnƒõnec, where the Stodolovis lived, was renewed, of which Jaroslav was originally suspected. Soon, physiological traces were confirmed his presence on the crime scene. During the interrogations, Jaroslav insisted that only he had murdered, but during the reconstruction of the crimes, it turned out that he had no idea of a wound on Helena Cerh√°kov√°'s hands. After the investigation into the Brnƒõnec murders, the ones in Slavo≈°ov and the surround areas soon followed. Stodola refused to admit that his wife had anything to do with the crimes, but the turnaround occurred when she began to testify about the murder of Maria ƒåondlov√° in Karda≈°ova ≈òeƒçice. The crime scene was described very precisely, and Jaroslav, according to his own words at this moment, finally admitted Dana's guilt. On 26 April 2004, both spouses were sentenced to life imprisonment by the Regional Court of Hradec Kr√°lov√©.Miloslav Jedliƒçka - Jaroslav Stodola and Dana Stodolov√° During the sentence, they communicated exclusively in written letters, although they could associate.

Historically, data center management was seen as something performed by employees, with the help of tools collectively called Data Center Infrastructure Management (DCIM) tools. Both for in-house operation and outsourcing, Service-level agreements must be managed to ensure data-availability. Coopetition Data center management is a growing major topic for a growing list of large companies who both compete and cooperate, including: Dell, Google, HP, IBM, Intel and Yahoo. Hardware/software vendors who are willing to live with coopetition are working on projects such as \\"The Distributed Management Task Force\\" (DMTF) with a goal of learning to \\"more effectively manage mixed Linux, Windows and cloud environments.\\" With the DMTF a decade old, the list of companies is growing, and also includes companies much smaller than IBM, Microsoft, et al.The Times article mentions \\"a crop of next-tier vendors, start-ups and open source players.\\" Focus Among the topics currently being explored are: scalability, securing data center networks, disaster recovery, government restrictions. Another major area is the cost of downtime regarding customer dissatisfaction & business loss, and also the \\"astonishing\\" yet hidden cost and effect regarding personnel & productivity. Business-service management Business-service management (BSM) treats IT as part of the larger enterprise strategy, and helps fill the gap between Business & IT. IBM notes that major problems often happen in the grey areas, particularly due to errors in the interfaces, and focuses on critical failures. Sufficient redundancy should allow failures in non-critical areas to protect the business from being affected. BSM, which is positioned above IT Service Management (ITSM), promotes a customer-centric and business-focused approach to service management, aligning business objectives with IT or ICT from strategy through to operations. Tools that help BSM include a modeling language, and a common dashboard, which together allow data center personnel to see problems before business customers do. Newer developments Remote Data Center Management allows offsite experts to watch for situations needing their timely intervention at a lower cost than having such staff be onsite 24/7/365. While some requirements for on-site hardware have been reduced, spending in other hardware areas such as UPS may have to increase. Data center asset management Data center asset management (also referred to as inventory management)or IT asset management (ITAM) is the set of business practices that join financial, contractual and inventory functions to support life cycle management and strategic decision making for the IT environment. Assets include all elements of software and hardware that are found in the business environment. IT asset management generally uses automation to manage the discovery of assets so inventory can be compared to license entitlements. Full business management of IT assets requires a repository of multiple types of information about the asset, as well as integration with other systems such as supply chain, help desk, procurement and HR systems and ITSM. ;Hardware Asset Management Hardware asset management entails the management of the physical components of computers and computer networks, from acquisition through disposal. Common business practices include request and approval process, procurement management, life cycle management, redeployment and disposal management. A key component is capturing the financial information about the hardware life cycle which aids the organization in making business decisions based on meaningful and measurable financial objectives. ;Software Asset Management Software Asset Management is a similar process, focusing on software assets, including licenses. Standards for this aspect of data center management are part of ISO/IEC 19770. Data center infrastructure management Data center-infrastructure management (DCIM) is the integration of information technology (IT) and facility management disciplines to centralize monitoring, management and intelligent capacity planning of a data center's critical systems. Achieved through the implementation of specialized software, hardware and sensors, DCIM enables common, real-time monitoring and management platform for all interdependent systems across IT and facility infrastructures. DCIM products can help data center managers identify and eliminate sources of risk and improve availability of critical IT systems. They can also be used to identify interdependencies between facility and IT infrastructures to alert the facility manager to gaps in system redundancy, and provide dynamic, holistic benchmarks on power consumption and efficiency to measure the effectiveness of \\"green IT\\" initiatives. Important data center metrics include those regarding energy efficiency and utilization of servers, storage, and staff. In too many cases, disc capacity is vastly under-utilized and servers run at 20% utilization or less. More effective automation tools can also improve the number of servers or virtual machines that a single admin can handle. DCIM providers are increasingly linking with computational fluid dynamics providers to predict complex airflow patterns in the data center. The CFD component is necessary to quantify the impact of planned future changes on cooling resilience, capacity and efficiency. Operations Operations (\\"ops\\") Information technology operations, or IT operations, are the set of all processes and services that are both provisioned by an IT staff to their internal or external clients and used by themselves, to run themselves as a business. The term refers to the application of operations management to a business's technology needs. Operations work can include responding to tickets generated for maintenance work or customer issues. Some operations teams rely on on-call responses to incidents during off-hours periods. As lights out operations increased, less of the staff are located near corporate headquarters. Gartner defines IT operations as \\"the people and management processes associated with IT service management to deliver the right set of services at the right quality and at competitive costs for customers.\\" Technical support A library help desk Technical support (often shortened to tech support) refers to services. Within a corporation, these are also known as help desks often arrange their technical support structure as a three-tier (plus two) system: * Tier 1: Basic help desk - initial point of contact, including software opening a trouble ticket. Information available to its personnel include FAQ and a basic knowledge base. * Tier 2: In-depth technical support * Tier 3: Expert product and service support. The extra tiers are: * Tier 0: Self help (i.e. by the end user) * Tier 4: Outside support for \\"items not directly serviced by the organization\\" Access to varying levels of support for products and services to in-house employees and corporate customers, providing information and troubleshooting is via various channels such as toll-free numbers, websites, instant messaging, or email. Help desk professionalism An ITIL-compliant help desk is usually a part of a bigger Service desk unit, which is part of ITSM As the incoming phone calls are random in nature, help desk agent schedules are often maintained using an Erlang C calculation. Companies with custom application software may also have an applications team who are responsible for the development of in- house software. The help desk may assign to the applications team such problems as finding software bugs. Requests for new features or information about the capabilities of in-house software that come through the help desk are also assigned to applications groups. The help desk staff and supporting IT staff may not all work from the same location. With remote access applications, technicians are able to solve many help desk issues from another work location or their home office. While there is still a need for on-site support to effectively collaborate on some issues, remote support provides greater flexibility. AT&T; Mobility previously provided technical support for some of its mobile phones through Device Support Centers. Some companies and organizations provide discussion boards for users of their products to interact; such forums allow companies to reduce their support costs without losing the benefit of customer feedback. Some fee-based service companies charge for premium technical support services. Outsourcing technical support Many organizations relocated their technical support departments or call centers to countries or regions with lower costs. Dell was amongst the first companies to outsource their technical support and customer service departments to India in 2001, but then reshored.Dell moves outsourced jobs back to U.S. shores There has also been a growth in companies specializing in providing technical support to other organizations. These are often referred to as MSPs (Managed Service Providers). For businesses needing to provide technical support, outsourcing allows them to maintain a high availability of service. Such need may result from peaks in call volumes during the day, periods of high activity due to introduction of new products or maintenance service packs, or the requirement to provide customers with a high level of service at a low cost to the business. It allows businesses to utilize specialized personnel whose technical knowledge base and experience may exceed the scope of the business, thus providing a higher level of technical support to their employees. Scams A common scam typically involves a cold caller claiming to be from a technical support department of a company like Microsoft. Such cold calls are often made from call centers based in India to users in English-speaking countries, although increasingly these scams operate within the same country. The scammer will instruct the user to download a remote desktop program and once connected, use social engineering techniques that typically involve Windows components to persuade the victim that they need to pay in order for the computer to be fixed and then proceeds to steal money from the victim's credit card. Preventive maintenance Preventive maintenance (or preventative maintenance (PM)) is ongoing scheduled inspection intended to detect and correct incipient failures either before they occur or before they develop into major problems such as downtime. Managing the capacity of a data center Capacity of a datacenter - Life Cycle With the increasing use of \\"the cloud\\" and what has been called \\"the Era of Infinite Capacity\\", there is still a need for professional Data Center Capacity Planners. There is a need to know what will be needed, and when. Data must continually be collected regarding usage of power/energy, computing power, data storage and networking/telecommunications. Plans must include awareness of cooling and space requirements. Sometimes analysis of this data, and comparison to industry norms, can be outsourced. The balance for the need to focus more on data collectionsince this consumes both computing and storage resources or analysis depends on current utilization levels: prior to 50%, the focus can stay more on data collection. Beyond 75%, the focus must shift to analysis, in preparation for upgrades, replacements and expansions. The data center is a resource in its own right. Top data centers and service providers According to Cloudscene's Leaderboard for Q1 2018, data center operators are ranked ‚Äúbased on both data center density (total operated data centers)\\", as well as \\"the number of listed service providers in the facility\\".

It was first performed in Paris in 1881, ran for 193 performances and was subsequently staged at other theatres in Europe, North America and Australia. It has not remained in the regular international operatic repertoire. The opera depicts the confused events and various assumed identities surrounding the wedding night of a Portuguese aristocrat. Background and first performances Since La fille de Madame Angot (1872), Lecocq had been successful throughout the 1870s in what the critic Robert Pourvoyeur calls \\"the same elegantly risqu√© mould ‚Äì the wedding night more or less thwarted\\".Pourvoyeur, Robert. \\"Jour et la nuit (Le)\\", Op√©rette ‚Äì Th√©√¢tre musical, Acad√©mie Nationale de l'Op√©rette. Retrieved 28 October 2018 A list of the gross takings of productions in Paris during the two decades from 1870, published in 1891, showed La fille de Madame Angot as the most successful opera by any composer in that time, earning more than two million francs; his Girofl√©-Girofla (1874) took nearly three-quarters of a million and La petite mari√©e (1875) was not far behind. In the 1880s he continued in his usual vein, but after the early years of the decade his works became less popular, and Le jour et la nuit was one of his last real successes.Andrew Lamb. \\"Lecocq, (Alexandre) Charles\\", Grove Music Online, Oxford University Press. Retrieved 28 October 2018 Having fallen out with the management of the Th√©√¢tre de la Renaissance, where his works were premiered in the 1870s, Lecocq chose the Th√©√¢tre des Nouveaut√©s for his new work. His choice caused some surprise, as the theatre, run by the actor-manager Jules Brasseur, had no reputation for op√©rette or op√©ra-bouffe, and was distinguished by the sometimes indelicate content of its productions.\\"The Drama in Paris\\", The Era, 12 November 1881, p. 5 Lecocq, usually a slow and painstaking composer, produced the score for the new work in what was for him the short space of two months, but it was well received and was judged by the critics to show no signs of hasty composition. To enhance the production Brasseur recruited the rising young singer Marguerite Ugalde from the Op√©ra Comique as his leading lady, and commissioned lavish costumes and scenery. The opera ran for 193 performances in its original production in Paris, taking more than half-a-million francs at the box office.\\"The Drama in Paris\\", The Era, 29 August 1891, p. 9 Original cast *Don Braseiro, governor of a Portuguese province ‚Äì Jean-Fran√ßois Berthelier *Don D√©gomez, his cousin ‚Äì Scipion *Miguel, his steward ‚Äì Achille- F√©lix Montaubry *Prince Picrates de Calabazas, prime minister of Portugal ‚Äì Jules Brasseur *Manola ‚Äì Marguerite Ugalde *B√©atrix ‚Äì Juliette Darcourt *Sanchette, an innkeeper ‚Äì Mdlle.

He is too busy guarding the border against the predatory Spanish to have time to go to Lisbon in search of a bride, and has delegated the task to his cousin, Don D√©gomez, who has chosen a suitable candidate and, as Braseiro's proxy, stood in at the wedding ceremony. Flushed with pleasure at matrimony, Braseiro willingly grants his steward, Miguel, permission to marry. The Spaniards attack the Portuguese outposts. Don Braseiro can wait no longer for his wife; he leaves to lead his army against the enemy. Manola, Miguel's fianc√©e arrives, fleeing from the unwelcome attentions of Prince Picrates de Calabazas, the Portuguese prime minister. He arrives in hot pursuit, and to prevent his further advances, Manola pretends to be Don Braseiro's wife. Nonplussed and disappointed, Calabazas is ready to leave. Braseiro, who has obtained a truce with the Spanish by means of judicious bribery, returns full of ardour, keen to meet his new wife. At the sight of Manola, he declares himself delighted. He insists that Calabazas should be his guest overnight, and then readies himself to consummate his marriage. B√©atrix, the real new wife, arrives and is intercepted by Manola ‚Äì whom she knows well ‚Äì and Miguel, who explain the situation. She agrees, despite some misgivings, to help them by passing herself off as a lady companion. In the evening, taking advantage of the darkness, she enters the nuptial chamber, while Manola slips out by another door. Act II: The grounds of Don Braseiro's castle The wedding night has gone well. Braseiro is delighted with his wife. He has not registered that the blonde Manola has been replaced by the brunette B√©atrix, though he wonders why his bride has such an inexplicable dislike of daylight. Calabazas, preparing to leave, encounters B√©atrix, whom he has not met before. He immediately falls for her. To save the situation, Manola plays the seductress with him, arranging a rendezvous in the dovecote in the castle grounds. Once Calabazas has climbed the ladder into the dovecote, Miguel and Manola remove the ladder, leaving Calabazas stranded, and run off. Act III: The courtyard of an inn Braseiro enters, accompanied by B√©atrix, her face hidden under a mantilla, so that her husband does not realise the deception. Miguel, disguised as a peasant and Manola, disguised as a mule-driver, arrive, closely followed by Calabazas. He recognises them and tells Braseiro that his wife is betraying him with Miguel. There is a general confrontation. The conspirators explain the deception and the reasons for it. Don Braseiro is satisfied with their explanation and very happy with B√©atrix as his bride. Calabazas's vengeance is forestalled by a dispatch announcing that the king, tired of his prime minister's frequent absences in amorous adventures, has dismissed him from office. Both pairs of lovers are happy, and Calabazas consoles himself with the willing charms of Sanchette, the innkeeper.

Biography Born in Eastbourne, East Sussex, the son of an architect, Cedric King Palmer was educated at Tonbridge School and studied conducting and composition at the Royal Academy of Music.Obituary: King Palmer by Tim Bullamore, The Independent, 26 July 1999 His teachers there included Ernest Read and Benjamin Dale (conducting) and William Alwyn and Norman Demuth (composition). While still a student conductor, Palmer was asked in 1932 to conduct at the Queen's Hall by Sir Henry Wood. After graduating in 1933 he began taking in students for singing lessons and offering correspondence courses in music theory.Musical Times, 1 August 1933, front matter He also took on the role of conductor at the Sevenoaks Musical Society, which performed Elgar's cantata King Olaf in 1934 under his baton.Musical Times, The Coming Season, 1 November 1934 By 1937, Palmer had written his first stage show, Gay Romance (book and lyrics by Cossar Turfery) from which one song, \\"The Man For Me\\" gained a measure of popularity. He also wrote With Pomp and Pride, a march to celebrate the coronation of King George VI in 1937.Guild:The Golden Age of Light Music The outbreak of war disrupted his theatre music career, but he did conduct a revival of The Desert Song in January 1943 at the Prince of Wales Theatre in London, and later a revival of Victor Herbert's operetta Naughty Marietta in which his future wife, Winifred Henry, was singing. They married in 1947. Meanwhile, in 1944 Palmer had published Teach Yourself Music, part of the extensive English University Press Teach Yourself series in their distinctive black and yellow jackets, with subjects ranging from salesmanship to jet- engines and rocket propulsion. Attempting such a broad subject in less than 200 pages was obviously a daunting task. The (anonymous) Musical Times reviewer stated that \\"whatever else you may teach yourself, it cannot be done with music\\" and expressed \\"a good deal of sympathy for a writer who was, as he doubtless well knew, up against it\\".Musical Times, 1 September 1944 Teach Yourself to Compose Music, more narrowly focused on harmony, form and counterpoint as well as genres, followed in 1948. Teach Yourself to Play the Piano was published in 1957. The books lay out classical best practices clearly and simply, but ignore more modern developments altogether. Reviewing Teach Yourself Orchestration (1964) Geoffrey Bush pointed out that \\"Webern might never have existed\\".Musical Times, 1 April 1965 His other books included The Musical Production ‚Äì a complete guide for amateurs (with Cossar Turfery, 1953),Review by Robert Monschein in Notes, Vol. 11, No. 3 (June 1954), pp. 474-475 and The ABC of Church Music (with Stephen Rhys, 1967).Review by Charles G Boody in The Choral Journal, Vol. 10, No. 6 (March 1970) p. 27. Conducting and Composition From the late 1940s Palmer was building up both his conducting and composition activities. The King Palmer Light Orchestra regularly broadcast on the BBC Home Service and Light Programme between 1948 and 1956.BBC Genome: Radio Times archive Always a champion of amateur music making, Palmer also conducted the City Literary Institute Rehearsal Orchestra, formed in November 1949 by professional musicians working in various restaurants and theatres to play through the standard symphonic repertoire.Musical Times, 1 September 1950 Advanced amateurs were also recruited. Palmer also lectured on music at City Lit. His orchestral conducting provided a platform for arrangements such as Galopade, a medley of galops and cancans, but also for original compositions. And an engagement by the Ford Motor Company for his orchestra to play at the Ford Motor Show in 1946 (held at the Royal Albert Hall) was his first introduction to the potential of commercial music. Palmer composed Rhythm of the Road, with lyrics by Cossar Turfey, which Ford used as the basis for a promotional film, in which the composer can be seen conducting.Ford Motor Company, Rhythm of the Road, 1946] Following on from this he built up a new career in production and library music, composing over 600 mood music pieces for music library companies such as KPM. Many of these pieces were short snippets composed to evoke a specific mood for radio, television and films.

Examples include Hackney Carriage (memorably used by Oliver Stone in his 1995 film NixonIMDB), Toboggan Ride, Holiday Playtime and Jogging Along. Occasionally, a piece would be chosen for a series theme tune and become more widely known, such as the theme for the 1962 US medical drama TV series The Eleventh Hour.Screenarchives.com Aside from library music, Palmer wrote a series of orchestral suites and shorter light music movements, some plays with music and pantomimes for children, and the occasional work with more serious intentions ‚Äì notably the Three Atonal Studies for piano.A Fourth Garland of English Light Music Composers, by Philip L Scowcroft He collaborated with his wife Winifred on a new musical, The Snow Queen, in 1967, with music adapted from Grieg. By the end of the 1960s Palmer had stopped composing, but usage of his library music continued to grow. It is still in use today in series such as the Nickelodeon animated series The Ren and Stimpy Show and SpongeBob SquarePants, Much of the music has also been repackaged in a set of library music CDs now available to the general music buyer for the first time.EMI Production Music Personal life King Palmer married Winifred Henry in 1947 and they had one son (Roger Lindsay, b 1948) and one daughter (Jane Hetherington, b 1952). For a while the couple set up and managed an arts bookshop in Kensington, where they were living. But by 1957 they had moved to Clovelly Lodge, Popes Grove in Twickenham. Winifred died in 1973, after which King Palmer continued as a piano teacher, but also took training as a music therapist, working with patients in local hospitals and prisons.

Printed on canvas, the work belongs to a series of generative images called La Famille de Belamy. The name Belamy is a tribute to Ian Goodfellow, inventor of GANs; In French ‚Äúbel ami‚Äù means ‚Äúgood friend\\" so it is a translated pun of Goodfellow.‚Äù It achieved widespread notoriety after Christie's announced its intention to auction the piece as the first artwork created using Artificial Intelligence to be featured in a Christie's auction. It surpassed pre-auction estimates which valued it at $7,000 to $10,000, instead selling for $432,500.. The sale was considered historic by multiple publications within the broader timeline of AI Art. The piece is a portrait of a somewhat-blurry man. It is a print on canvas measuring 27 ¬Ω x 27 ¬Ω in (700 x 700 mm.) set within a gilded wood frame. The image was created by an algorithm that referenced 15,000 portraits from various periods.

The algorithm was trained on a set of 15,000 portraits from online art encyclopedia WikiArt, spanning the 14th to the 19th century. The organization that produced it is called Obvious. It is a collective comprising three people, Pierre Fautrel, Hugo Caselles-Dupr√© and Gauthier Vernier, who are based in Paris, France. The piece has been criticized because it was created using a generative adversarial network (GAN) software package based on prior research by others and implemented by Robbie Barrat, an AI artist who was not affiliated with Obvious, leading to allegations that Obvious contributed minimally to the final work product. Posts on the project's issue tracker show Obvious members requesting that Barrat provide support and custom features. The piece has also been placed within a tradition, dating back to Duchamp's Bicycle Wheel of 1913 and Tinguely's M√©ta-matics of the late 1950s, of works calling into question the basis of the modern art market, and highlighting the comic aspects of technology. Research has used Edmond de Belamy to show how can anthropomorphizing AI can affect allocations of responsibility and credit to artists.

Sir William Bolland (1772‚Äì1840), lawyer and bibliophile, the eldest son of James Bolland, of Southwark, was educated at Reading School under Dr. Valpy, and admitted a pensioner at Trinity College, Cambridge on 26 September 1789, at the age of seventeen. During his school days he wrote several prologues and epilogues for the annual dramatic performances in which the scholars took part, and for which Dr. Valpy's pupils were famous. At Cambridge he took his degree of BA in 1794, and MA in 1797. For three successive years (1797, 1798, and 1799) he won the Seatonian Prize by his poems on the respective subjects of miracles, the Epiphany, and St. Paul at Athens, which were printed separately, and also included in the \\"Seatonian Prize Poems\\" (1808), ii. 2133-97. On leaving Cambridge he determined upon adopting law as his profession, and was called to the bar at the Middle Temple on 24 April 1801. Bolland practised at the Old Bailey with great success; he was thoroughly conversant with commercial law, and soon became one of the four city pleaders. From April 1817 until he was raised to the bench he was recorder of Reading. He was a candidate for the common serjeantcy of the city of London in 1822, but in those days of heated political excitement was defeated by the Lord Denman. In November 1829 he was created a Baron of the Exchequer, and held that appointment until January 1839, when he resigned on account of failing health. On 14 May 1840 he died at Hyde Park Terrace, London. Lady Bolland, whom he married on 1 August 1810, was his cousin Elizabeth, the third daughter of John Bolland, of Clapham. An anonymous satire, \\"The Campaign, to his Royal Highness the Duke of York, Britannia in the year 1800 to C. J. Fox.\\" was written by Bolland in 1800, but not issued for sale, the author confining its publicity to his friends. Although he published but little, he was known for many years as an enthusiastic student of early English literature. Dibdin dwells with unction on the pleasures of the dinner-parties of Hortensius‚Äîthe fancy name by which he designated Sir William Bolland‚Äîand extols the merits of his library. It was at a dinner-party in Bolland‚Äôs house on the Adelphi Terrace that the Roxburghe Club was originated, and its first publication was his gift. This was \\"Certain Bokes of Virgiles Aen√¶is turned into English meter. By the right honorable lorde, Henry, earle of Surrey.\\" The books were the second and fourth, and the reprint, bearing the date of 1814, though the dedication was signed 17 June 1815, was taken from a copy of the original edition of 1557, which is preserved at Dulwich College. His collections were sold in the autumn after his death, his library of about three thousand articles producing about ¬£3,000.

The show was produced and scripted by the Mexican professional wrestling promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL: Spanish for \\"World Wrestling Council\\") and took place at Arena M√©xico in Mexico City, Mexico. The special edition of CMLL's Super Viernes show honored CMLL wrestler Blue Panther for his 40th anniversary as a professional wrestler. As part of the show Blue Panther himself helped book two of the matches on the show. Firstly a match between wrestlers who was trained in the Laguneros area (Blue Panther, Euforia, Black Warrior and Panterita del Ring and wrestlers from the Tapat√≠a area (M√°scara A√±o 2000, El Cuatrero, Forastero and Sans√≥n), which was won by Blue Panther. The other featured match was the first-ever Copa Halc√≥n Suriano torneo cibernetico elimination match. The Copa Halc√≥n Suriano was won by √Ångel de Oro who was presented with a trophy by Halc√≥n Suriano Jr. who made his first appearance under that name, having previously worked under the name Stukita. In the main event B√°rbaro Cavernario and Los Ingobernables (Rush and El Terrible) defeated Car√≠stico, Penta el 0M, David Finlay Production Background Genaro Vazquez Nevarez, better known under the Ring name Blue Panther, made his professional wrestling debut on October 8, 1978. His first break came working for the Universal Wrestling Association in the early 1980s. In the UWA he won the UWA World Welterweight Championship, and the UWA World Junior Light Heavyweight Championship twice. He later moved on to Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL), the promotion he worked for, for most of his career. In CMLL he became involved in the storyline feud that would not only bring him to national and international attention but also helped cement his reputation as highly talented wrestler, a feud against \\"Love Machine\\" Art Barr, The feud spanned two promotions (CMLL and Asistencia Asesor√≠a y Administraci√≥n), included two high profile Lucha de Apuestas, or bet matches, where Blue Panther won the mask, and then the hair of Barr, as well as a long series of main event matches. In CMLL Blue Panther's won the CMLL World Middleweight Championship, the CMLL World Tag Team Championship with Atlantis, CMLL World Trios Championship twice, and the Mexican National Trios Championship twice. In 2007 he won the mask of Lizmark Jr., but lost his own mask the following year to Villano V. At his 35th Anniversary Show in 2013 Vazquez introduced two of his sons to the wrestling world, Blue Panther Jr. and Black Panther. For the 40th-anniversary show, Vazques was involved in booking two matches for the show, including creating the Copa Halc√≥n Suriano in honor of his wrestling trainer. Storylines Blue Panther Jr., one of the sons of Blue Panther The Blue Panther 40th Anniversary Show featured five professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre- existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. As part of the celebration, Blue Panther wanted to honor his trainer Halc√≥n Suriano, who had had a hand in training many of the wrestlers from the Lagunero area. To that end, CMLL created the La Copa Halc√≥n Suriano, a 10-man tournament where all the competitors came from the Lagunero area. As part of the celebration, CMLL announced that Stukita, the grandson of Halc√≥n Suriano would from that point on be known as \\"Halc√≥n Suriano Jr.\\" and move from the Mini-Estrella to the regular division. Halc√≥n Suriano Jr. would also present the trophy bearing the name of his grandfather. Soberano Jr. was originally scheduled to be part of the match, but since he was committed to working in Japan at the time he was replaced by Templario. While Templario was not actually from the Lagunero area his trainer √öltimo Guerrero explained that he had become \\"adopted\\" by the Laguneros, which was a storyline explanation to cover for the fact that CMLL needed a replacement for Sobereano Jr. Event In the opening match, Pegasso was the first of many wrestlers to wear a Blue Panther inspired mask and ring gear specifically for the occasion. Pegasso and Stigma defeated Cancerbero and El Coyote, two falls to one in 9 minutes and 57 seconds. For the Copa Halc√≥n Suriano introduction ceremony, the five tecnico participants (√Ångel de Oro, Black Panther, Blue Panther Jr., Niebla Roja and Stuka Jr.) all wore masks where one side was their normal mask and the other was a replica of the Blue Panther mask. In respect rudo competitor Luciferno also wore blue and black instead of his customary red and black. During the 10-man torneo cibernetico elimination match, Blue Panther Jr. injured himself while slipping during a dive out of the ring to the floor. He was counted out due to the injury and removed from the ring by the ringside attendants. In the end √Ångel de Oro pinned Drag√≥n Rojo Jr. to win the tournament. ;La Copa Halc√≥n Suriano order of elimination { !style=\\"background: #e3e3e3;\\"|# !style=\\"background: #e3e3e3;\\"|Eliminated !style=\\"background: #e3e3e3;\\"|Eliminated by !style=\\"background: #e3e3e3;\\"|Time |- !1 |Espanto Jr. |Blue Panther Jr. |05:28 |- !2 |Black Panther |Misterioso Jr. |05:29 |- !3 |Luciferno |Stuka Jr. |09:18 |- !4 |Blue Panther Jr. |Injury |10:05 |- !5 |Misterioso Jr. |Niebla Roja |14:16 |- !6 |Stuka Jr. |Drag√≥n Rojo Jr. |14:51 |- !7 |Templario |√Ångel de Oro |16:05 |- !8 |Niebla Roja |Drag√≥n Rojo Jr. |19:31 |- !9 |Drag√≥n Rojo Jr. |√Ångel de Oro |24:57 |- !10 |Winner |√Ångel de Oro |24:57 |} Prior to the fourth match of the night Sofia Alonso, granddaughter of CMLL founder Salvador Lutteroth, presented Blue Panther with a plaque commemorating his 40th anniversary in professional wrestling. Afterward, Panther introduced \\"El Hijo de Blue Panther\\" (Literally \\"The Son of Blue Panther\\"), younger brother of Blue Panther Jr. and Black Panther, to the audience, revealing that Hijo de Blue Panther was preparing for an in-ring career. For the match, both Blue Panther and M√°scara A√±o 2000 wore their wrestling masks, getting special permission from the lucha libre commission to wear their masks after losing them in 2008 and 1993 respectively. For the night Ephesto worked under his previous ring character \\"Panterita del Ring\\" as an homage to his Lagunero beginnings. In the end, Blue Panther forced M√°scara A√±o 2000 to submit to an arm bar, winning the match for the \\"Laguneros'\\" team two falls to one.

Biography Born in Seattle in 1929, Sharla Perrine moved to Santa Monica three years later. After graduating in mathematics from the University of California, Los Angeles, she taught mathematics and science in Santa Monica schools. She began to work at RAND in 1959 where she met her husband to be, Barry Boehm. In 1964, together with her colleague Paul Baran, she published a paper titled \\"On Distributed Communications: II. Digital Simulation of Hot-Potato Routing in a Broadband Distributed Communications Network\\". As her name appears first in the original paper, she seems to have been the one who was behind the simulation programmed in Fortran, showing that packet switching (or \\"hot-potato routing\\" as it was called) could indeed work. In RAND and the Information Evolution, Baran describes how Boehm carried out various simulations under different conditions, demonstrating that the protocol routed traffic efficiently. In particular, it was discovered that if half the network was destroyed, the remainder reorganized and began routing again in less than a second. In a 1996 paper on \\"An Early Application Generator and Other Recollections\\", Barry Boehm notes that Sharla Boehm \\"had developed the original packet-switched network simulation with Paul Baran\\", a development which led him to become involved in the pioneering ARPAnet Working Group.

The show took place on November 2, 2018 in CMLL's main venue, Arena M√©xico, in Mexico City, Mexico and celebrated the Mexican Day of the Dead celebration. Many of the wrestlers working the show wore the traditional D√≠a de Muertos face and body paint for the D√≠a de Muerto event. From the fourth match on the losing wrestlers were be dragged to El Inframundo (\\"The Underworld\\"), a side entrance in the arena, by a group of wrestlers dressed up as minions of the ruler of the underworld. As part of the show Sans√≥n successfully defended the Rey del Inframundo (\\"King of the Underworld\\") championship that he won at the 2017 D√≠a de Muertos show against challenger Templario. The main event was a Relevos incre√≠bles (Miss-matched team match) where the technico (those that portray the \\"good guys\\") King Phoenix teamed with his brother Penta 0M and √öltimo Guerrero, who are both rudos (\\"the bad guys\\"), losing to the team of Diamante Azul, L.A. Park, and Michael Elgin. The show featured four additional matches. Production Background The October 31, 2014 D√≠a de Muertos show was the first of Mexican professional wrestling promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre's Dia de los Muertos (\\"Day of the Dead\\") celebrations in 2014 and began a tradition of CMLL holding a major show to celebrate the Latin American holiday. As part of their Dia de los Muerte celebrations CMLL admitted all kids in costumes for free for the show. CMLL held a second Dia de los Muerte celebration on Sunday November 2 as well. Both shows included the Edcanes, CMLL's ring girls and various wrestlers dressed up in traditional D√≠a de Muertos garb. In 2014, CMLL also turned the basement of Arena M√©xico into a haunted house attraction before each show. CMLL has held one or more shows to celebrate the holiday annually since 2014, with 2018 marking the fifth year in a row. Storylines The 2018 Dia de Muertos show features six professional wrestling matches scripted by CMLL with some wrestlers involved in scripted feuds. Wrestlers portray either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that play the part of the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they perform. At the 2017 D√≠a de Muertos show, Sans√≥n outlasted El Cuatrero, Diamante Azul, Forastero, Hechicero, Mistico, Soberano Jr. and Valiente in a torneo cibernetico elimination match to become the first ever Rey del Inframundo (\\"King of the Underworld\\"). While Sans√≥n was given a championship belt to symbolize his victory it is not a championship, but a tournament trophy that is not defended outside of the annual tournament in the vein of CMLL's Leyenda de Plata or Leyenda de Azul tournaments. On the October 26, 2018 CMLL Super Viernes show 12 wrestlers competed in the first round of the 2018 Rey del Inframundo tournament, with Templario winning the match over a field that included Audaz, Black Panther, El Cuatrero, Esfinge, Flyer, Forastero, Guerrero Maya Jr., Kawato San, Tiger, Trit√≥n, and Virus, thus qualifying for the final match against Sans√≥n on November 2.

He is also nicknamed Abu Aseel, The Father of Khaleeji Music ()., and The one with the golden larynx (). Abu Bakr is famously known in the Arab world by his unique riveting voice. He is one of the few musicians in the Arab world who succeeded at being a singer, poet, and composer at the same time and thus, he is considered a complete artist. Before drawing his path in the music world, Abu Bakr worked as a teacher for three years, drawing on his training at a teachers‚Äô institute in Yemen. Some of Abu Bakr's patriotic odes to Yemen celebrated the significant historical events such as the abolition of the monarchy in the north in 1962, the independence of the south in 1967, and the unification of both the South and North Yemen in 1990. In addition to the Yemeni nationality, Abu Bakr also held the Saudi nationality after he moved to Saudi Arabia in the 70's. During his musical career, he worked with other pioneers in the Khaleeji music field including Talal Maddah, Tariq Abdul-Hakim and Shadi Gulf. His last release was a duet with young Yemeni singer and winner of the ‚ÄúKhaleeji Star‚Äù (a singing competition on the television) Fouad Abdulwahed. Abu Bakr Salem died on December 10, 2017.  Personal life   Early life  Abu Bakr was born in Tarim, a historic town situated in the Hadhramout Valley south of Yemen. His family is from Ba 'Alawi sada. He lost his father at a young age and he was raised by his mother, grandfather, and uncles. His grandfather Abdel Rahman Balfaqih was a famous poet in Hadramout as well.  Family  Abu Bakr was married to two women both of Hadrami origin. His son Aseel Abu Bakr Salem followed his steps and he made a strong entrance to the world of Khaleeji music when he joined his father in the song ‚ÄúA Sun Between You and Me.‚Äù The song immediately became a hit and remained in the top of charts for a long time.  Professional career   Beginning in Yemen  Abu Bakr's ‚Äúgolden larynx‚Äù was first discovered while he was a teenager and he was asked to perform the call of prayer in multiple mosques in Tarim. When he became insightful about both poetry and Islamic studies, he started singing nasheeds (spiritual odes) locally. Abu Bakr's poetic talents were noticed first when he was 17 years old when he wrote his first poem ‚ÄúYou are the most beautiful among all roses.‚Äù He started composing his folk songs when he moved from Tarim to Aden. At that time, Aden was living a cultural and musical boom as the city was home to rising artists such as the Yemeni poet Lutfi Jafar Iman, and the singers Ahmed Bin Ahmed Qasim and Muhammad Saad Abdullah. Inspired by the situation, Abu Bakr began singing at organized parties and events. Eventually he was given the opportunity to perform on Aden TV. In 1956, he made his big hit through a broadcast with his first song using his first poem ‚ÄúYa Ward Mahla Jamalak.‚Äù Later in his career, Abu Bakr brought together all the poems that he turned into songs into one book that he called \\"A poet First, a Singer Afterwards.\\" Inspired by the great amount of positive feedback that he received after his first appearance on TV and after his hit on the broadcast in Aden, Abu Bakr dedicated two years of hard work to focus on his music career. Within these two years, he regularly released songs including Lima Alqee Al Habib, Khaf Rabek and Ya habib, and Ya Kahef Al Rouh  Moving to Lebanon  In 1958, Abu Bakr left to Beirut with the aim of finding more opportunities as Beirut was known at that time for having a well established regional music hub through its plethora of performance venues, radio stations, and well-designed recording studios. Abu Bakr did reach his aim when he released a series of popular singles such as 24 Saa‚Äôa (24 hours). The song sold more than 1 million copies and became a hit in the Arab world in a relatively short time. It is still considered one of the classics of the Arabic music Tarab genre. Abu Bakr fled Beirut when the Lebanese civil war broke out in 1975  Settling in Saudi Arabia  After leaving Beirut, Abu Bakr settled in the capital city of Saudi Arabia: Riyadh. In Saudi Arabia, Abu Bakr established a close work relationship with the Yemeni poet Hussein Al‚ÄôMahdhaar. It was Hussein who would pen most of Abu Bakr's greatest songs and in return, it was Abu Bakr who would voice Hussein's greatest and most memorable compositions. Abu Bakr constantly held concerts across the Gulf countries during his musical career and he drew big crowds at each concert  Honors and Awards  * 1968 (Greece) - Abu Bakr Salem received the Golden Disk for his album Mata Ana Ashoufak (When Shall I See You). * 1978 - He was ranked as the third best voice in the world in contest organized by UNESCO. * 1985 - He sang at the Albert Hall in London and the concert was organized by the Government of the Sultanate of Oman and the Omani Sapcon Company for Arts and Literature 1/11/1985 * 1989 - He was awarded the first degree art medallion from the Yemeni president Ali Abdullah Saleh . * 1992 - He was granted an Appreciation and Excellence medallion from the Omani Ministry of National Herite. * 1999 - He won a prize for best singing performance at Abha Touristic Festival in 1999. * 1999 - He was granted another Appreciation medallion from the UAE song festival and an Appreciation certificate for his art accomplishments at the Gulf Song Festival. * 2001 - He was honoured by king of Bahrain decoration of first class arts and literature * 2002 - The Arab League honored him along with other Arab art pioneers. * 2003 - He won the UNESCO Prize as the second best voice in the world and the cultural medal in 2003. * 2003 - The University of Hadhramout awarded Abu Bakr an honorary doctorate degree. * 2014 -He was honoured by Sultan Qaboos sultan of Oman decoration first class arts and literature  Best Hits  # Ya Ward Mahlaa Jamalak (You are the most beautiful among all roses) # Ma Fe Ahad Mertah (No one is satisfied) duet with the Kuwaiti singer Abdallah Al Rowaished # Khair Al Kalam (The Best of Words) duet with the Emirati singer Hussain Al Jassmi # Sameh (Forgive) duet with the Saudi singer Rashed Al-Majed # Sirr Hobbi (The Secret of My Love) # Kama Al Reeshah (Like a Feather) # Bashil Hobak (I will Take your Love) # Ya Mesafer (O Traveler)  Illness and Death  Abu Bakr suffered from health problems for the last 10 years of his life. He had an open heart surgery and suffered a kidney failure when he was being treated in Munich, Germany. He was admitted in a clinic for several months afterwards. He also went at intermittent periods to King Faisal Specialist Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

Although he never won a Group 1 race in a career badly disrupted by injury he was rated one of the best horses of his generation at two and three years of age. After finishing fourth on his debut he won his remaining four starts as a juvenile in 2003 including the Vintage Stakes and Champagne Stakes. He failed to win in four starts as a three-year-old but produced a career-best performance when narrowly beaten in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes. He was retired from racing and had some success as a breeding stallion before dying in 2010 at the age of nine. Background Lucky Story was a bay or brown horse bred in Kentucky by WinStar Farm. As a yearling in 2002 he was put up for auction at the Keeneland September Yearling Sale and was bought for $95,000 by representatives of Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum's Gainsborough Stud. The colt was sent to Europe where he was leased for racing purposes to Abdulla Buhaleeba and was sent into training with Mark Johnston at Middleham in North Yorkshire. He was sired by Kris S, who made little impact as a racehorse but sired the winners of more than 20 Group 1/Grade I races, including Symboli Kris S, Brocco and Kris Kin. Lucky Story's dam Spring Flight won eight times when racing in the United States between 1989 and 1992, recording her best win in the Senorita Stakes. Her other foal included Lucky Story's full-brother Dr Fong. She was descended from Misplay, a half-sister to Worth and was therefore a distant relative of Count Fleet. Racing career 2003: two-year-old season Lucky Story began his racing career by finishing fourth in a minor event at Ayr Racecourse on 29 May. Three weeks later at the same track he started 4/11 favourite for a maiden race over six furlongs at the same track in which he was ridden by Stanley Chin. He took the lead two furlongs out, accelerated clear of his three opponents and won by five lengths despite being eased down in the final strides. The colt made a quick return in a minor event at Pontefract Racecourse ten days later and recorded another decisive win as he pulled away in the final furlong to come home six lengths clear of Mac The Knife. For his next appearance, Lucky Story was moved up in class to contest the Group 2 Vintage Stakes over seven furlongs at Goodwood Racecourse on 30 July. Ridden as on two of his three previous starts by Keith Dalgleish he was made the 6/5 favourite, with the best fancied of his eight opponents being The Mighty Tiger, Kings Point (winner of the Superlative Stakes) and Nevisian Lad (July Stakes). After racing just behind the leaders he went to the front two furlongs out and kept on well to win by one and a quarter lengths from The Mighty Tiger. Darryll Holland took over from Dalgleish when Lucky Story started 2/1 second favourite behind Haafhd in the Group 2 Champagne Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse on 12 September. In a change of tactics he led from the start and held on under pressure to win by a neck from the Michael Stoute-trained Auditorium despite hanging to the right in the final furlong. After the race it was reported that Johnston regarded the colt as his best prospect since Mister Baileys. A month later the form of the race was boosted when the fifth-placed finisher Milk It Mick won the Group 1 Dewhurst Stakes. The Dewhurst had been intended as Lucky Story's final run of the season but was withdrawn by Johnston two days before the race after the colt performed poorly in a training gallop. In the 2003 International Classification for two-year-olds Lucky Story was given a rating of 118, making him the fourth-best European juvenile of the year behind Bago, Attraction and Grey Swallow. He shared his rating with Milk It Mick and Three Valleys making him the joint-highest British-trained colt of his generation. 2004: three-year-old season Injury problems meant that Lucky Story was off the track for the first seven months of 2004. After an absence of eleven months the colt returned in the Group 3 Sovereign Stakes over one mile at Salisbury Racecourse on 12 August in which he was matched against older horse. Ridden as in all of his 2004 starts by Holland he took the lead a furlong out but was caught on the line and beaten a short head by the four-year-old Norse Dancer. He was then sent to France Prix du Moulin at Longchamp Racecourse on 5 September but after leading in the early stages he faded to finish seventh of the eleven runners behind Grey Lilas. In the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot Racecourse twenty days later he started a 16/1 outsider in an eleven- runner field. Appearing to relish the \\"searing pace\\" he took second place in the straight and steadily reeled in the leader Rakti but was still half a length behind at the finish. On his last racecourse appearance Lucky Story disappointed in the Champion Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse on 16 October, coming home ninth of the ten finishers behind Haafhd. In the 2004 World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings Lucky Story was given a rating of 122, making him the fifteenth best racehorse in the world. He was rated the second-best three-year-old trained in Britain, two pounds behind Haafhd and equal to the Epsom Derby winner North Light. Stud record Lucky Story was retired to become a breeding stallion at Tweenhills Farm in Gloucestershire. He died in his paddock of a suspected heart attack on 12 May 2010. The stud's director said \\"We found Lucky Story dead this morning after what would appear sudden death in his sleep. Thankfully there was no sign whatsoever that he had suffered\\". The best of his offspring was Art Connoisseur who won the Golden Jubilee Stakes in 2009. His other foals included Lucky Kristale (Lowther Stakes), Annecdote (Oak Tree Stakes), Arpinati (Premio Primi Passi) and Lucky Like (Two-Year-Old Trophy).

It was built from 1830 to 1840. It is also known as Royal College of Radiologists and 37 Lower Fort Street. The property is privately owned. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  One in a row of substantial Colonial Georgian residential terraces with sweeping views.Anglin 1990:1018 Believed to be one of the first residences built in Fort Street, it was probably built before 1830, on part of the estate of Robert Campbell, a well-known Sydney merchant of the day.Leary, 1979, 16 Dawesleigh was built as a merchant house and residence by Thomas Dyer Edwards and Matthew Dysart Hunter who were both in their early twenties at the time. Thomas had been an orphan in the southern English port town of Shoreham. Thomas worked briefly on a Jamaican plantation before heading to China, but he was not suited to the climate. In 1833 slavery was abolished in the British Empire, the East India Company lost its trading monopoly over China, Edwards and Hunter arrived in Sydney from Canton to set up their trading company which soon controlled most of the China trade, and they built this house as their residence and headquarters. Their company which they named Edwards & Hunter, was closely aligned with China trading company Jardine, Matheson and Co. Throughout the 1830s, Edwards & Hunter flourished and new partners joined the firm and lived in Lower Fort Street, mostly in nearby houses. These new partners included Mashfield Mason, William Fane De Salis and John Thacker. By the early 1840s, Edwards had retired and returned with his family to England and Hunter returned to Scotland. An outbreak of the Bubonic plague in 1903 provided a pretext for the government to resume the houses of Lower Fort Street and indeed the whole of Dawes Point, and . There were plans for new wharves and bond stores to the west of Lower Fort Street and a harbour crossing to the east. Some houses were demolished, flats were built for workers on some of the now-vacant land, and the houses that remained were rented out. Dawesleigh was rented to John Haroldson, and by 1910 to Alfred S. Carpenter. From soon after the end of World War I Dawesleigh became a hostel run by a succession of landladies who included Ethel Wilson (1925), Rose Shackel (1936), Florence Ann Dee (1956) and France Barwyck from 1957 to 1975, when it was extensively remodelled for the Royal Australasian College of Radiologists. The College left in the early 1990s and squatters moved in. The house was almost derelict when the NSW Government chose to sell it. The current owners purchased Dawesleigh in 2009 and began restoration work.  Description  Located within the Millers Point historic district on an elevated site with views over the harbour to both front and rear.

His instructors there included prominent landscape and animal painter Jan Baptiste de Jonghe (1785‚Äì1844). He later studied with the landscape and animal painter Eug√®ne Verboeckhoven in Ghent. He established a lifelong friendship with Verboeckhoven and the two artists regularly created artworks together.

Work Louis-Pierre Verwee was a landscape and animal painter. His early works are similar to those of his master Verboeckhoven, to the extent that it is often difficult to distinguish their work. Verboeckhoven sometimes painted the figures and animals in Verwee's pictures.Louis-Pierre Verwee, Shepherd with Animals at Maidstone Museum and Bentlif Art Gallery on the site of the National Inventory of Continental European Paintings Wooded river landscape with shepherdess and cattle Verwee's paintings of forests and rivers are in the stereotypical, romantic way that can be found in the landscapes of the painters Andreas Schelfhout (1787‚Äì1870), Barend Cornelis Koekkoek (1803‚Äì1862), Frans Keelhoff (1820‚Äì1893) and Johann Bernard Klombeck (1815‚Äì1893). In the later part of his career he strived for innovation, but from 1837 onwards he became stuck in ever-changing winter landscapes. This type of winter landscapes had become popular due to the work of Barend Cornelis Koekkoek and Andreas Schelfhout. Louis-Pierre Verwee depicted these landscapes with low-hanging, heavy snow clouds over wintry land and waterways and dotted with figures. He used light blue and metallic gray in his color palette in an effort to suggest the intimate, moody aspect of such landscapes.

Lagrange is the holder of numerous scientific awards and honorary decorations, including Knight of the Legion of Honour (the highest French order of merit) and is a member of the French Academy of Sciences since 2013.  Early life and education  Anne-Marie Lagrange was born on 12 March 1962 in the Rh√¥ne-Alpes region where her father was employed at the French electric utility company, √âlectricit√© de France S.A. and a stay- at-home mother. When she was 5 years old, her father was transferred to Ain and the family moved to Ceyz√©rieu where Lagrange went to primary school. She attended college in Culoz, at the Lyc√©e du Bugey in Belley. In high school, she was passionate about physics and mathematics and decided to study higher. On the advice of her teacher and the local Rotary Club, she went to Classe pr√©paratoire aux grandes √©coles (CPGE) after obtaining her Baccalaur√©at in 1979. She discovered the professions of scientific research and thus found her vocation.\\"Biographie d'Anne-Marie Lagrange,\\" http://femmesetsciences.fr (consult√© le 19 f√©vrier 2017). https://www.femmesetsciences.fr/wp- content/uploads/2013/03/actfs_anne_marie_lagrange.pdf In 1982, she joined the √âcole Polytechnique and did her military service for the first year as section chief in the 8th Signal Regiment. She discovered astrophysics during an optional course given by Jean Audouze and found this discipline fascinating‚Äîconnecting basic sciences with an exploratory side. At school, she gave birth to her first child. She graduated from √âcole Polytechnique in 1985. The following year, she obtained a diploma of in-depth studies (DEA) in astrophysics at Paris Diderot University. Then, she prepared a thesis at the Institut d'astrophysique de Paris under the supervision of Alfred Vidal-Madjar and obtained her doctorate in 1989.  Career  After her studies, Anne-Marie Lagrange did a year of postdoctoral work at the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in Germany from 1989 to 1990. During a mission to Chile, she met Pierre L√©na who developed adaptive optics and understands its full potential in the research and study of exoplanets. In 1990, she joined the Laboratoire d'astrophysique de Grenoble (LAOG) under the direction of Alain Omont and formed a small research group on extrasolar planetary systems. In 1994, she obtained her qualification to direct research while she has already been, since 1990, research fellow at the CNRS. From 1997 to 2002, she was the scientific manager of the NAOS instrument, the first adaptive optics installed on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) of the European Southern Observatory. In 2002‚Äì2003, she conducted the pre-study of the Spectro-Polarimetric High- Contrast Exoplanet Research (SPHERE instrument), successor to NAOS, dedicated to the research and characterization of exoplanets. From 1999 to 2003, she was a part-time project manager at the Institut National des Sciences de l'Univers (INSU) and the Department of Universe Sciences at the French National Centre for Scientific Research, while continuing her research at LAOG. In 2000, she became the research director at CNRS. From 2004 to 2006, she was deputy director at INSU and CNRS, responsible for the Astronomy and Astrophysics division. From 2007, she was again a researcher at LAOG, which in 2011 became the Grenoble Institute of Planetology and Astrophysics (IPAG). In addition to her research, she was a member of several scientific program committees of the Very Large Telescope (VLT), the European Southern Observatory (ESO), the European Space Agency (ESA) and the CNRS. She was also a member of several boards of directors such as the Observatoire de la C√¥te d'Azur (OCA), THEMIS, EISCAT and the Institut d'astrophysique de Paris, she chaired the High Scientific Council of the Paris Observatory (2014-2017). She was made a knight of the National Order of the Legion of Honor on April 2, 2010 and was appointed to the rank of officer of the Order of Merit on November 20, 2015. She was elected member of the Academy of Sciences on December 10, 2013. She was appointed to the Strategic Research Council on February 3, 2014.  Work  Composite image of the Beta Pictoris system as visualised in infrared From the 1990s, she began to search for exoplanets using direct imaging using novel adaptive optics. In the 2000s, her research became focused on the study of giant planets around young stars. In the 2000s, she specifically looked for giant planets around young stars. Thus, in 2005, she made the first direct observation of an exoplanet around a brown dwarf using deep adaptive-optics. In this research, she also uses the radial velocity method and extends this technique to other types of stars. In addition, she studies the impact of stellar activity on the detectability of planets.  Discovery of exoplanet Œ≤ Pictoris b  Artist's impression of the planet Beta Pictoris b Beta Pictoris b time lapse Lagrange has devoted much of her career to the analysis of the star Beta Pictoris in the constellation Pictor. During her thesis in the 1980s, she studied the disc of debris that had just been discovered around this star. Several elements indicated the presence of a massive planet‚ÄîŒ≤ Pictoris b‚Äîbut the scientific community remained skeptical. However, in the 2000s, Lagrange made several observations of the debris disc using adaptive optics coupled with direct imaging using a near-infrared spectrometer mounted on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) of the European Southern Observatory (ESO). On November 18, 2008, after processing the data taken in 2003 using reference star differential imaging and modern image processing tools, Lagrange discovered the exoplanet Beta Pictoris b orbiting around the star, confirming her earlier predictions.  Giant planet Œ≤ Pictoris c  In 2019, Lagrange and a worldwide team announced the discovery of the giant planet Beta Pictoris c that was equivalent to 9 Jovian masses. Lagrange's team determined that the exoplanet is 23-million-years old, 63.4 light years away, and completes its orbit in approximately 1,200 days. This exoplanet was found using the radial velocity method. The researchers analyzed 10 years of data. The teams were from Lagrange's laboratory at CNRS/Observatoire de la C√¥te d'Azur and from other French laboratories (Laboratoire d'√©tudes spatiales et d'instrumentation en astrophysique, Observatoire de Paris, Sorbonne Universit√©, Universit√© de Paris, Institut d'astrophysique de Paris (Sorbonne Universit√©)) to researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy, the South African Astronomical Observatory, the University of Warwick, Leiden Observatory, European Southern Observatory, Universidad de Chile, and Universidad de Valparaiso. This new discovery could help scientist better understand the formation of planetary systems and their evolution in the early stages.

Background  Located in the Syrian steppes, Aleppo was an important center of the Muslim world in the 11th century. When travelling from Baghdad to Antioch in the 1060s, Ibn Butlan crossed prosperous villages near Aleppo. Earthquakes regularly hit northern Syria in the 11th century. Two earthquakes were especially serious, causing much damage in August and November 1114. A Seljuk prince, Ridwan, ruled Aleppo when the crusaders reached northern Syria in 1097. His conflicts with his brother, Duqaq, the ruler of Damascus, enabled the crusaders to lay siege to Antioch. Ridwan and Duqaq led separate relieving armies to the town, but the crusaders defeated both. The first crusader ruler of Jerusalem Godfrey of Bouillon was planning the conquest of Aleppo already in 1100, according to Guibert of Nogent. Taking advantage of the crusaders' defeat in the Battle of Harran in 7 May 1104, Ridwan invaded the Principality of Antioch, but its ruler, Tancred, routed him in the Battle of Artah in the spring of 1105. Ridwan did not dare to make raids against Antiochene territories during the following 5 years. Ridwan was a friend of the Assassins. He died in December 1113. Rumours about the plans of Tancred's successor, Roger of Salerno, to conquer Aleppo brought about an alliance between the Artuqid emir of Mardin, Ilghazi, and the atabeg (or governor) of Damascus, Toghtekin, in the early summer of 1119. Ilghazi inflicted a crushing defeat on the crusaders in the Battle of the \\"Field of Blood\\" on 28 June. Roger perished fighting in the battlefield. Baldwin II, King of Jerusalem, and Pons, Count of Tripoli, hurried to Antioch to save the principality. Ilghazi and Toghtekin joined their forces, but they could not defeat the crusaders in a battle near Tell Danith and returned to their realms in August. Baldwin II who was held captive by Timurtash, son of Ilghazi, was released 29 August 1124, based on an agreement to pay 80,000 dinars and to cede Atarib, Zardana, Azaz and other Antiochene fortresses to Timurtash.  Siege  Baldwin II decided to attack Aleppo to free the hostages, including Baldwin's youngest daughter Ioveta, who were handed over to Timurtash to secure the release payment. Therefore, he made an alliance with Joscelin I of Edessa, a Bedouin leader, Dubais ibn Sadaqa and two Seljuq princes, Sultan-Shah ibn Radwan and Toghrul Arslan. He laid siege to the town on 6 October 1124. In the meantime, the qadi of Aleppo, Ibn al-Khashshab, approached Aqsunqur al-Bursuqi, atabeg of Mosul, seeking his assistance. Upon hearing of al-Bursuqi's arrival, Dubais ibn Sadaqa withdrew from Aleppo, which forced Baldwin to lift the siege on 25January 1125.  Aftermath  Baldwin II and al-Bursuqi forces met at the Battle of Azaz in June 1125, which resulted in a crusader victory.

Returning to Ireland, he made his debut for Ireland in a List A one-day match against Gloucestershire in the 1996 Benson & Hedges Cup at Dublin, when he was called up as a late replacement for Uel Graham. The following week he played against Surrey in the competition at Eglinton, before following this up in June with another List A appearance against Sussex at Hove in the NatWest Trophy. In August 1996, he made his only appearance in first-class cricket for Ireland against Scotland at Linlithgow. In a drawn match, Moore batted twice, scoring 51 runs in Ireland's first-innings before being dismissed by James Govan, while in their second-innings he was dismissed by Mike Allingham. Across both of Scotland's innings, he also bowled six wicket-less overs. Moore made a final List A appearance for Ireland against Glamorgan at Cardiff in the 1997 NatWest Trophy.

Besides the Sintang Regency, the airport also serves the Melawi Regency, Sekadau Regency, Sanggau Regency and the Kapuas Hulu Regency. History There are several small airports within the Sintang, Sekadau, Sanggau, Melawi, and Putussibau regencies, which only serve local flight routes. In order to reach distant domestic or international destinations, residents of these areas must travel through the Supadio International Airport, which is located in Pontianak.

Tebelian Airport was built as an alternative for the people of these areas to get easier air access. The name of the airport is taken from the airport's location which is located in Sungai Tebelian district. Thus, the name of the earlier airport, Susilo Airport, which is located in Sintang City, was not given to the newer airport. Construction of the airport was started in 2013. On August 18, 2015 the first flight test was conducted to try the use of the runway.

Fahmy was the first woman to train in Egypt‚Äôs jewellery quarter, Khan El Khalili. In 2013 Fahmy founded ‚ÄòThe Design Studio by Azza Fahmy‚Äô, in partnership with Alchimia, Contemporary Design School in Florence. Early life & career Born and raised in Sohag in Upper Egypt, Azza Fahmy graduated from Helwan University with a Bachelor of Arts in Interior Design. In 1969, she stumbled upon a Medieval jewellery design book, which became an inspiration for her work. Then a government employee, she kept her day job but ventured into Cairo‚Äôs jewellery quarter to learn at the hands of the techniques of the craft at the hands of master goldsmiths. It was in these workshops that Fahmy worked on her very first designs. In the mid-1970s the British Council offered her a fellowship to study jewellery design at Sir John Cass College, where she learnt theory and manufacturing techniques. Upon her return, she set up her first workshop with two employees. From her earliest designs, Fahmy‚Äôs work has always been inspired by culture and heritage both local and global. One of her first collections, 'Houses of the Nile', brought some aspects of the Egyptian lifestyle. One of Fahmy‚Äôs trademarks is Arabic calligraphy using traditional proverbs and verses of celebrated scholars, poets and artists. The calligraphy inscriptions include words sung by legendary Egyptian singer Umm Kulthoum, to whom two collections are dedicated, as well as verses and proverbs by Rumi, Gibran Khalil Gibran, Rabaa Al-Adawiya, and many more. The preservation of ancient jewellery-making techniques and the jewellery craft is the premise of Azza Fahmy's brand. In 2006, Fahmy collaborated with Julien Macdonald at London Fashion Week, followed by a collaboration with Preen at New York Fashion Week in February 2010. In early 2012, she worked with the British Museum on the exhibition ‚ÄòHajj: journey to the heart of Islam‚Äô, creating a 9-piece bespoke collection. Fahmy partnered with the British Museum once more in 2015 on their exhibition ‚ÄòEgypt: Faith after the Pharaos‚Äô. In 2007, Fahmy published her book, titled 'Enchanted Jewelry of Egypt', recounting her journey through Egypt to discover the traditional jewellery crafted and worn in different areas of the country.

While working at the studio Pitra did not shun drawing based on a model, but he very quickly found his own style, at first relying on a ruler and French curve, with which he constructed pronounced figures formed with a strong line and sharp contrasts of black and white areas. He was just as masterful in handling lettering, which he placed in his drawings in the form of various signs and labels. Pitra admired the drawings of Franti≈°ek Bidlo and above all the portrait shorthand of his professor Adolf Hoffmeister, for whom the medium was a \\"mask that is truer than the face\\".HOFFMEISTER, Adolf.

Pitra also understood drawing as a record of his internal life that was to be rendered with as economical means of expression as possible. Telling is the account of the difficulties he encountered when trying to take out the First Republic magazine Simplicus from the University Library. Although they acquiesced in the end, they apparently first \\"interrogated\\" him on what he needs the magazine for and then demanded a \\"confirmation of a true need to study the item\\".PITRA, Svatopluk.

After completing school, Pitra began to work as a graphic designer for domestic and international trade fairs; among other things, he participated in the graphic design for the Czechoslovak pavilion at the EXPO 58 World's Fair in Brussels.

The award Liter√°rn√≠ noviny confirmed the distinguished position Pitra had taken on at the turn of the sixties in the circle of cartoonists associated in the Polylegran group. Cartoonists were abandoning illustrated anecdotes and wordy civic satire, ceasing to use dialogues and even monologue captions and began exploring the possibilities of semantically encoding the drawing itself. Some invented sharp-witted absurdities, others sought out a universal language in the tangled world of lines.RY≈†KA, Pavel a ≈†R√ÅMEK, Jan (2016), s. 78‚Äì83. Foreign-policy and anti-fascist caricature had considerable prestige in the official art scene.

Adolf Hoffmeister became the patron of this new wave of Czech artistic humour, though the genealogical lines led more towards western artists such as Raymond Peynet, Jean-Maurice Bosc, Maurice Sinet and especially Saul Steinberg, Saul Steinberg, who showed Czech cartoonists that a line can be \\"drawn in such a way so as to reveal the ridiculous side of reality more deeply than a sophisticated replica, so as to evoke amazement, embarrassment, disgust and laughter all together\\".MACOUREK, Milo≈° a SUS, Oleg.

Praha : SNKLHU, 1959. appeared on the shelves of Czech book shops in 1959 with a cover by Svatopluk Pitra, who had debuted in book illustration the previous year when he accompanied a collection of satirical texts by Ji≈ô√≠ Robert Pick entitled Klady√°tor.PICK, Ji≈ô√≠ Robert. Klady√°tor. Praha: Mlad√° fronta, 1958. with his rough-hewn characters. At the end of the fifties Pitra also illustrated Jirotka's SaturninJIROTKA, Zdenƒõk. Saturnin. Praha: ƒåeskoslovensk√Ω spisovatel, 1959. and Emil Vachek's satirical novel A≈æ se ucho utrhne.VACHEK, Emil. A≈æ se ucho utrhne. Praha: ƒåeskoslovensk√Ω spisovatel, 1959. Both titles came out in the Humour and Satire Edition, which was issued by the ƒåeskoslovensk√Ω spisovatel. Svatopluk Pitra, illustration from Emil Vachek's book A≈æ se ucho utrhne [When the Bough Breaks]. ƒåeskoslovensk√Ω spisovatel, 1959. Pitra's drawings were aptly characterised by the artist's friend, cartoonist, illustrator and creator of animated films Jaroslav Mal√°k: \\"[Pitra] is cruelly critical of humanity as a whole and of the depicted individuals. Though he draws very beautiful women, they are all actually beasts [...]. Pitra treats the other half of the population, men, even worse. I don't know a single drawing of Pitra's that depicts a model husband, a good father and breadwinner of a nice family. On the other hand Pitra has depicted a plethora of fraudsters, cardsharps, gangsters, corrupt politicians, detectives and the oddest of individuals.\\"MAL√ÅK, Jaroslav. Vzpom√≠nkov√Ω text. In HOR√ÅKOV√Å, Ljuba (2007), s. 36‚Äì37. We can find a whole gallery of such characters in Pitra's illustrations for the detective stories by Alexandr Grin, Agatha Christie, Dashiell Hammett, Seiƒç√≥ Macumota and Georges Simenon, that came out in the year 1962 in the seventh annual revue Svƒõtov√° literatura [World Literature]. Another frequent motif of Pitra's drawings was vehicles: motorcycles, cars, planes or helicopters. He shared this admiration for modern technology with his peers Dobroslav Foll or Teodor Rotrekl, who formed the core of the artistic group RadarFORM√ÅNEK, V√°clav. Radar. Anatomie tv≈Ørƒç√≠ skupiny. Praha: Odeon, 1971. along with other Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design in Prague classmates at the end of the fifties. For Pitra, however, the interest in human nature predominated. This is also evident in his drawings for Eternity Lost by Clifford D. Simak the anthology Labyrint (SNKLU, 1962), organised by Adolf Hoffmeister. At the time when this remarkable collection of western science- fiction stories came out, Pitra was already fully involved in artistic design for animated and puppet films at the studio Brat≈ôi v triku.  Animated film designer 1957‚Äì1963  Svatopluk Pitra, character of father-photographer for animated film by Eduard Hofman Tucet m√Ωch tat√≠nk≈Ø [My Dozen Dads] (1959). Pitra's first animated films were made at the advertising business Propag, where he designed puppets for a piece by director Josef Kluge on family shopping at department stores V√°noce (Christmas) (1957). He also drew and self-directed Atomic Century (Timely Purchase of Fuel) (1957). He is also listed as designer and director for the advertising pieces An Idea from Heaven (1957) a That's Not How It's Done (1957), which promoted the advantages of newly introduced self-service retail.HAVELKA, Ji≈ô√≠. ƒås. filmov√© hospod√°≈ôstv√≠ III.

Of the four-part series Samoobsluha it is likely that only Who Asks for What has been preserved. The illustrated anecdotes in it were drawn by Pitra's colleague Jaroslav Mal√°k, core cartoonist for Dikobraz and one of the founders of the association of caricaturists Polylegran. In 1959 Pitra took part in the film experiment Tucet m√Ωch tat√≠nk≈Ø, in which director Eduard Hofman used the work of thirteen different artists. For this \\"tragic cartoon\\", Pitra designed the character of the photographer dad. Aside from the director Eduard Hofman, himself, who drew the character of the policeman, the artists were, Ji≈ô√≠ Brdeƒçka (scuba diver), Franti≈°ek Freiwillig (ship's captain), Vladim√≠r Hlavat√Ω (lifeguard), Adolf Hoffmeister (scientist), Ota Janeƒçek (drummer), Josef K√°brt (opera singer), Jaroslav K√°ndl (painter), Vladim√≠r Lehk√Ω (student), Kamil Lhot√°k (pilot), Jaroslav Mal√°k (hairdresser) a Zdenƒõk Miler (little girl and mother).HAVELKA, Ji≈ô√≠. ƒås. filmov√© hospod√°≈ôstv√≠ VII. 1958‚Äì1962. Praha: SPN, 1964, s. 61. Svatopluk Pitra, designs for 2D puppets and backgrounds for animated film by director Jan Karpa≈° Cec√≠lie 470 (1961). For the satirical cartoon T≈ôi mu≈æi (1959) by director Vladim√≠r Lehk√Ω he contributed extremely simplified drawings reminiscent of the figures from the cartoons of √âmile Cohl. This morality play on the consequences of irresponsible behaviour received an award at the International Festival in Venice. Pitra did not however receive the travel permit that would allow him to receive the prize in person.HOR√ÅKOV√Å, Ljuba (2007), s. 13. Pitra designed 2D and 3D puppets for director B≈ôetislav Pojar Jak za≈ô√≠diti byt (How to Furnish a Flat) (1959). In the short introduction the piece amusingly summarises the prehistory and history of furniture culture, subsequently promoting rational placement of modern home furnishings. Pitra also took part as a designer in B≈ôetislav Pojar and Ji≈ô√≠ Brdeƒçka movie Sl√°va (Fame) (1959). The story about a chimney that did not smoke just for its own sake, but actually artistically, was situated in a Western-style major city that was supposed to lie far beyond the borders of socialist Czechoslovakia, but can be read as an illustration of the famous proverb about the impermanence of every worldly glory. Svatopluk Pitra, puppets for director Stanislav L√°tal's animated film Plivn√≠k dla≈ædiƒçe Housky (Tile-Setter Houska's Chicken-Imp), 1961. In comparison with the highly ironic caricatures of snobbish consumers of artistic sensations, the puppets that he designed for Bohuslav ≈†r√°mek's animated film P≈°tros (Ostrich) (1960), were much more benevolent. Also pleasantly rounded were the figures of the puppet film Plivn√≠k dla≈ædiƒçe Housky (1961), based on the eponymous story by Karel MichalMICHAL, Karel. Plivn√≠k dla≈ædiƒçe Housky. Plamen. 1959, ƒç. 3. and filmed by director Stanislav L√°tal. The disposition of the individual characters was rounded out inimitably by the voice of Rudolf Deyl, jr., who convincingly portrayed Houska's indecisive resignation, the self-satisfied pedantry of the enterprise officials, and the chicken-imp's maniacal energy. Pitra's artistic design for the film Cecilie 470 (1961), which director Jan Karpa≈° filmed based on the story by Milo≈° Macourek, was characterised by an elegant painting of stylish \\"Brussels\\" graphics. Pitra used a similar artistic concept in the animated film by director Bohuslava ≈†r√°mka Blecha (Flea) (1961) about an insignificant creature obsessed with a megalomaniacal delusion. Svatopluk Pitra, who at the time was quite overworked, suffered a legitimate feeling of insufficient appreciation. He bore the contrast between his abilities and their pitiful financial reward just as hard as his exhausting and vain search for his own studio.HOR√ÅKOV√Å, Ljuba (2007), s. 16. After the propaganda piece T≈ôi mu≈æi na ryb√°ch (Three Men Fishing) (1962), pointing out the advantages of working in shifts, the last film Pitra worked on in Czechoslovakia was an awareness piece by director and screenwriter Ji≈ô√≠ Brdeƒçka Tak na to? (So Shall We?). When the imaginative and humorous film about the need to observe good habits when losing weight reached Czech cinemas in mid-1963, the artist's name was not even mentioned in the credits.  The American years 1963‚Äì1993  Svatopluk Pitra, drawing Pan Chru≈°ƒçov (Mr Krushchev), 1963. The reason was that in spring of 1963, Pitra took advantage of a trip to Cuba that ƒåeskoslovensk√° televize and Kr√°tk√Ω film, had arranged for creative employees and, on the return during a stopover in Halifax, Nova Scotia, he applied for political asylum. The successful and confident forty-year-old graphic designer had no doubt he would make his way in this new environment just as well as he had in Czechoslovakia. The beginnings were indeed promising. Pitra found work in the government production and distribution company the National Film Board of Canada as a creator of advertising and promotional films. Of course he only accepted this well paid employment as a temporary solution until he could learn English and get a permit to travel to the USA. He was particularly happy with having his own home and also with the enormous amount of cheap jazz records. Though at night he dreamed of wild chases with Prague cops, he felt finally free. He started working on the animated film The Kind Dictator (Laskav√Ω dikt√°tor), the idea for which he wanted to pitch to a Canadian or American producer. At the time he sent his girlfriend and former classmate from Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design in Prague Irena Bryndov√° in Prague a drawing on which \\"Mr Nikita Khrushchev\\" is approaching the naked buttocks of a chained victim with a syringe.HOR√ÅKOV√Å, Ljuba (2007), s. 15. Svatopluk Pitra, sketch for film The Kind Dictator, undated (mid-60s). In light of the difficult pronunciation of the name Svatopluk, while living in Canada he began to sign his name S. Paul Pitra. Later he would sign his work with ART-TIP, a play on words with the ananym of his surname. In Prague he was meanwhile convicted of illegal border crossing and sentenced to three years prison and forfeiture of property. The work that the State Security authorities confiscated at the time is missing today. In July 1964 he received a permit to live in the United States. Much like Vladim√≠r Fuka, whose first visit to New York thrilled him and inspired a number of drawings, Pitra also considered the American metropolis a place where the maddening maze of obstructions would finally lead out into the free world. It was however a world with quite different rules and some of them he was unable to grasp. Though he admired American automobiles, he had no understanding for mass production in what he considered art. He was shocked by certain expressions of American popular culture and in one letter to Irena Bryndova he complained: \\"The locals are on the level of natives in central Africa! What they like the most is things that shine or glitter!\\"HOR√ÅKOV√Å, Ljuba (2007), s 23 In the summer of 1965 he attempted to employ his strongly expressive style of drawing in a competition to decorate the airport in Buffalo. For the forty-metre concrete surface he proposed a figure with a tall top hat and flag of the United States. Though he did not succeed with this idea, at the end of the same year he won a contract for graphic work for the 1967 International and Universal Exposition in Montreal. Though the job brought him his coveted means of subsistence, it did not manage to satisfy his artistic ambitions. It was no different in his next job with greeting card company Hallmark, where he could apply his exceptional spatial imagination and technical gifts in designing three-dimensional paper models of vehicles that were folded up as cards and stood up when unfolded. In his free time he made puppets and props for animated films, which he wanted to start working on under more auspicious conditions. But even his patented design for a method of parking cars in tight spaces did not help him acquire a greater financial sum that would allow him to realise film projects. \\"The granted patent protected (Pitra's) invention for a period of twenty years, up until 1988. It was to be expected that an automaker would express interest in utilising it in practice. But it did not happen. Only in 2005 did automaker Nissan publish a description of an almost identical design in Japan...\\"HOR√ÅKOV√Å, Ljuba (2007), s 33 Svatopluk Pitra, Zamy≈°len√≠ [Contemplation], oil, 53 √ó 34.5 cm, 1981. After five years of waiting for a permit to travel abroad, Pitra's partner Irena Bryndov√° came to New York at the start of August 1968. They planned to return to Prague together, but this definitively fell apart following the Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia. With the prospect of long-term residence in the United States, Irena Bryndov√° found work as a fabric designer and in October 1969 was married to Svatopluk Pitra.HOR√ÅKOV√Å, Ljuba (2007), s 31 Though Pitra did not give up on his ideas to create animated films, he could not find a producer for his projects. For this reason he had an animation camera brought in from Vienna and in his New York apartment he created a tripod and electrical control for it. Work constantly ran up against a lack of funding and the film The Kind Dictator remained unfinished. All that remained in the artist's estate was a typewritten script and several drawings. After ten years living in America, Svatopluk Pitra began to face the consequences of long-untreated diabetes. Though he did not stop drawing, he no longer published the results of his work. Aside from colourful drawings, which he did not first exhibit until the start of the nineties in Prague, he also began painting. He was again most interested by figural motifs; this time they were muted colour figures that often fixed their gaze directly at the viewer. Still lifes and nostalgic looks back at the distant Czech landscape also appeared in his paintings. While at the end of the fifties he constructed sharp verticals of high-rise buildings, among New York's skyscrapers he painted winding streets lined with buildings with red gabled roofs. Pitra was allowed to visit Czechoslovakia as a citizen of the United States in 1976. He only had his first improvised exhibition, organised by his friends from Polylegran Jaroslav Mal√°k and former graphic designer of Mlad√Ω svƒõt Jaroslav Weigel, in the newsroom of Mlad√° fronta, after the fall of the communist regime in 1991.MAL√ÅK, Jaroslav.

It was going to be a unique entry in the Bomberman franchise, featuring its own dedicated single- player and multiplayer modes, with the latter having support for up to eight players by using two Team Tap adapters. The idea of creating a Bomberman title for the Jaguar was primarily hatched by Genetic Fantasia, which was a development company that was formed by Mike Mika, along with his colleagues to Atari Corp. during a behind-the-scenes meeting at Las Vegas in 1994, with the team looking at Super Bomberman 2 in order to replicate its gameplay mechanics on the system. Though Atari acquired the license of Bomberman from Hudson Soft between 1994 and 1995, the project would be discontinued by the former sometime in 1996 along with other upcoming projects for the platform such as Black ICE\\\\White Noise and Thea Realm Fighters, due to Atari preparing to drop support for the Jaguar before merging with JT Storage in a reverse takeover on April of the same year. Bomberman Legends was never previewed or mentioned in magazines and other publications at the time when the title was still being developed, until its existence was revealed during an online Q&A; session hosted by Next Generation on April 1998. The game was also thought to be lost, before its source code was eventually recovered in recent years by two of the original programmers of the title.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot from one of the recently revealed beta builds. Bomberman Legends is an action-maze game that plays very similarly like other games in the Bomberman franchise. There were going to be two gameplay modes: a single-player story mode, which took elements from titles of the series that were released at the time such as Super Bomberman and Bomberman '93, with plans to feature an extensive storyline and cutscenes, and a multiplayer mode which supports up to eight players by plugging two Team Tap multitaps into the console. Before starting a multiplayer match, players would have the choice to customize their Bomberman character with power-ups.  Development  According to Mike Mika, one of the original programmers for the project, him and his colleagues were still in college with their studies but they had aspirations of entering into the video game industry. In 1994, the group travelled to Las Vegas and formed a game development company to discuss with multiple console manufacturers at SCES '94 and obtain a development kit in order to begin working on titles for systems that were still active on the market, such as the Nintendo Entertainment System. The team approached to Atari Corporation and began discussing with Jeff Minter, known for his work in Tempest 2000 on the Jaguar, who recommended them to speak with Atari Corp. representative Normen Kowalewski, which in turn he told them to meet him behind the scenes at a hotel. When the group arrived to the location, Atari had a Jaguar development setup along with a prototype of the Atari Jaguar CD add-on for demonstration purposes to third-party developers. Interested in acquiring a development kit for the system, the team spoke with company representatives in regards to the subject and reached an agreement, purchasing and receiving various hardware kits to program games for the system. During a brainstorming session, the team originally had plans to create an project that was a spoof of the damsel in distress plot found in various titles at the time, but the idea was later discarded after publishers showed little interest in it, however, they later settled down in creating a Bomberman title as their \\"dream game\\", with Mike himself contacting Hudson Soft via online in regards to develop a title of the series for the Jaguar. He discussed with an employee of the company named Bill Rich and told that Atari was interested in acquiring the rights of the series, with the latter agreeing to do so after speaking with Hudson, and the team started development of Bomberman Legends between late 1994 and early 1995. The development team took care in making the title as faithful to the series, by looking at Super Bomberman 2 on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System as the standard, while they sent notes to Hudson in regards as to how they approached its development. Sometime during development, Mike and his team received a telephone call from then-Atari Corporation vice-president in third-party development Bill Rehbock, who told to them if they could remove any reference to Bomberman due to monetary issues that Atari was having during this period and make it an original property instead. A few days later, the team received another call from Bill, who told them that Atari was preparing to stop support for the Jaguar and cancelled upcoming projects for the system, including Bomberman Legends and Atari merged with JT Storage in a reverse takeover on April 1996. Prior to its discontinuation, the team managed to get the multiplayer mode working, while the single-player mode had just begun development. It was never advertised or mentioned in any publication during its development.  Reveal  The existence of Bomberman Legends was first hinted by Ultra Game Players magazine via their website, until it was officially confirmed to the public at an online Q&A; session hosted by Next Generation magazine on April 2, 1998, revealing that one of their then-current staff members (Mike Mika, who began writing for the magazine as early as March 1998) previously worked on the unreleased game and one of the reasons as to why the project was ceased by Atari. During another online Q&A; session hosted by Next Generation on July 24 of the same year, the name of the developer who worked on the project was revealed to be Genetic Fantasia, and that the company was based on Michigan. The game was briefly mentioned in an October 2000 issue of GameFan magazine during an article written by Eric C. Mylonas on \\"The Graveyard\\" section, with Eric suggesting Songbird Productions to publish the title.  Rediscovery  On May 25, 2014, the source code of Bomberman Legends that was originally thought to be lost was found on a CD-ROM and eventually preserved by Mike and his brother Jeremy Mike, who was one of the lead programmers of the title, along with a member of the Jaguar community. More information about the project were revealed on Twitter posts written by Mike, including a never-before-seen production artwork of the game that was showcased to the public on June 26, 2016.

It is known for creating the first 3D printable prosthetic hand and sharing the designs and code for bioelectric limbs.  History  In 2011, Ivan Owen created a metal, functional puppet hand for a Steampunk costume. After posting a video of the hand on YouTube, he was contacted by South African carpenter Richard Van As who had lost his fingers in a woodworking accident. Owen and Van As worked on prototypes of a prosthetic hand, before Owen decided to incorporate 3D printing into the design process. This led to the creation of the first 3D printed mechanical hand. The sharing of the design of this hand on an Open License led to the creation of the community. The e-NABLE community \\"started with around 100 or so people who were simply offering to print the files that were already in existence\\". Chapters of the organisation exist in many countries, and each works in different ways. For example, one Canadian chapter recycles excess plastic waste to create the prosthetics. A chapter in Aden, Yemen, is producing prosthetic hands for people injured in Yemen's civil war. The Open Source nature of the project is enabling diverse groups around the world to create prosthetics for people within their own communities.

Background Murray grew up near oilfields in Long Beach, California (here, 1920) Alexander Howison Murray Jr. was born on April 18, 1907, in Long Beach, California. His parents were Scottish-American Alexander Howison Murray, Sr., and Spanish-Irish-American Katharine da la Ossa Kevane. He was also a fifth-generation \\"Californio\\" descended from Eulalia P√©rez de Guill√©n Marin√© (1766‚Äì1878). In 1924, Murray graduated Long Beach High School. He attended the University of California, Berkeley (which he reached by boat or train from Long Beach). He graduated a year late in 1930 due to financial pressures brought on by the Great Depression (which started in 1929). Career Bell tower in Placerville, California, where Murray was twice mayor In 1930, Murray took a trip with college friends to Placerville, where he met his future wife, Isadeen Raffetto. He reurned to live there (1934‚Äì1991). Business Murray distributed California wines like those of Charles Krug (here, Charles Krug Winery) In 1929, Murray got a job with Union Oil Company in Barstow, California. In 1934, he moved to his wife's hometown of Placerville, where they bought and ran Murray's stationery store (a landmark business founded by J.C. O'Donnell as a tobacco shop in 1888) at 311 Main Street until 1949. In 1944 during World War II, he joined in the US Navy through 1945; his wife ran the store in his absence. In June 1949, they sold the stationery store to Edward H. Durbin, following Murray's takeover of the El Dorado Distributing company from George Yeager. From 1949 until retirement, he operated El Dorado Distributing, a beverage wholesaling business that introduced into northeastern California and western Nevada the wines of Charles Krug, Robert Mondavi, Paul Masson, and Ernest and Julio Gallo.

In 1976, he ran and won a council seat again. Later that year, Murray and fellow councilmen Andy Anderson and Mark Tetrault came under fire from the mayor and other councilmen for leading a 3‚Äì2 vote in an amendment to reduce appointive powers of the city manager. Murray was among several councilors recalled in March 1977. In the late 1940s, Murray led town officials in a successfully campaign to have US 50 constructed through Placerville, which the State of California completed in 1953. \\"To help draw attention to the highway and promote businesses along it, he helped organize the first \\"Forty-Niner\\" Festival and Wagon Train (or Wagon Caravan) event in 1949,\\" which he supported annually as late as 1962 when he served as \\"chairman for the annual Highway 50 Snow Ball.\\" He continued to support the highway by serving on the board of the National Highway 50 federation with California Senator Swift Berry as chairman. In 1975, Murray took out papers to run again for city council. In the late 1980s, Murray was still weighing in on town affairs. In a letter to the editor of the Mountain Democrat dated May 19, 1986, he praised El Dorado County Supervisor Bob Dorr as well as the Mountain Democrat itself over the issue of \\"toxic polluters.\\" In another letter dated June 8, 1987, he called on fellow citizens to rally support for a South Fork American River (SOFAR) project.

After the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941 (Operation Barbarossa), she was limited to escort duties in the western half of the Black Sea during the war by the powerful Soviet Black Sea Fleet which heavily outnumbered Axis naval forces in the Black Sea. The ship may have sunk two Soviet submarines during the war. In early 1944 the Soviets were able to cut off and surround the port of Sevastopol on the Crimean Peninsula. Regele Ferdinand covered convoys evacuating Axis troops from Sevastopol and was badly damaged in May when she rescued some troops herself. Later that year Romania switched sides, but despite that the Soviets seized the Romanian ships and incorporated them into the Soviet Navy. Renamed Likhoy, the ship served until she was struck from the navy list in 1951 when she was returned to the Romanians who renamed her D21 in 1952. The ship was discarded in 1961 and subsequently scrapped. Background and design Following the end of World War I and the re-purchase of two Aquila-class cruisers from Italy, the Romanian Government decided to order also two modern destroyers from the Pattison Yard in Italy, as part of the 1927 Naval Programme. The design was based on the British Shakespeare- class destroyer leaders, but differed in the arrangement of their propulsion machinery. The guns were imported from Sweden and the fire-control system from Germany.Twardowski, pp. 359, 361 Four destroyers were intended to be ordered, but only two were actually built. The Regele Ferdinand-class ships had an overall length of , a beam of , and a mean draught of . They displaced at standard load and at deep load.

The main armament of the Regele Ferdinand-class ships consisted of five 50-calibre Bofors guns in single mounts, two superfiring pairs fore and aft of the superstructure and one gun aft of the rear funnel. For anti-aircraft defense, they were equipped with one Bofors anti-aircraft (AA) gun between the funnels and a pair of AA guns. The ships were fitted with two triple mounts for torpedo tubes and could carry 50 mines and 40 depth charges.Axworthy, p. 348 They were equipped with a Siemens fire-control system which included a pair of rangefinders, one each for the fore and aft guns.Whitley, p. 225 Modifications The 40-millimetre guns were replaced by two German AA guns and a pair of French M1929 Hotchkiss machineguns were added in 1939. Two Italian depth charge throwers were later installed. During World War II, the 76-millimetre gun was replaced by four AA guns. In 1943, the two ships were equipped with a German S-Ger√§t sonar. The following year, the upper forward 120-millimetre gun was replaced by a German AA gun. German 88-millimetre guns in Romanian service were themselves modified by being fitted with Romanian-produced barrel liners.Axworthy, p. 149 Construction and career Regele Ferdinand, named after King Ferdinand I of Romania, was ordered on 13 November 1926 and was laid down by Pattison in June 1927 at their shipyard in Naples, Italy. She was launched on 2 December 1928 and commissioned on 7 September 1930 after arriving in Romania. The ship was assigned to the Destroyer Squadron, which was visited by King Carol II of Romania and the Prime Minister, Nicolae Iorga, on 27 May 1931. Wartime photo of Regele Ferdinand in splinter camouflage Massively outnumbered by the Black Sea Fleet, the Romanian ships were kept behind the minefields defending Constan»õa for several months after the start of Operation Barbarossa on 22 June 1941, training for convoy escort operations. Beginning on 5 October, the Romanians began laying minefields to defend the route between the Bosphorus and Constan»õa; the minelayers were protected by the destroyers. After the evacuation of Odessa on 16 October, they began to clear the Soviet mines defending the port and to lay their own minefields protecting the route between Constan»õa and Odessa. On 1 December Regele Ferdinand, her sister ship and the flotilla leader MƒÉrƒÉ»ôti were escorting a convoy to Odessa when a submarine unsuccessfully attacked the convoy. It was quickly spotted and depth charged by Regele Ferdinand and Regina Maria with the latter claiming a kill. Soviet records do not acknowledge any losses on that date. The sisters escorted another convoy to Odessa on 16‚Äì17 December, the last one before ice closed the port. As the convoy passed Jibrieni, Regele Ferdinand spotted a submarine's periscope and depth charged the submarine after evading a pair of torpedoes. The ship reported spotting debris and an oil slick; she may have sunk .Rohwer & Monakov, p. 265Axworthy, pp. 332‚Äì336; Hervieux, pp. 75‚Äì76; Rohwer, p. 127 During the winter of 1941‚Äì1942, the Romanian destroyers were primarily occupied with escorting convoys between the Bosporus and Constan»õa. On the nights of 22/23 and 24/25 June, Regele Ferdinand, Regina Maria and the flotilla leader covered the laying of defensive minefields off Odessa. After Sevastopol surrendered on 4 July, a direct route between the port and Constan»õa was opened in October and operated year-round. On 14 October Regele Ferdinand was attacked and missed by the submarine . The submarine unsuccessfully attacked Regele Ferdinand and MƒÉrƒÉ»ôti as they escorted a convoy of two Italian oil tankers off the Bosporus; they depth charged the submarine, but she survived. On 14 November the German oil tanker was torpedoed at the entrance to the Bosporus by the submarine as she was being met by the sisters.Axworthy, pp. 337‚Äì339; Hervieux, pp. 76‚Äì77, 79‚Äì80; Rohwer, pp. 176, 194, 200, 207 Regele Ferdinand and MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti escorted the minelayer as she laid a minefield off the approaches to Sevastopol harbor on the night of 13/14 September 1943. Two days later Regele Ferdinand attacked a submarine, possibly Shch-207, and claimed to have sunk it.Axworthy, p. 340; Hervieux, p. 81 Soviet sources do not acknowledge any submarine lost on that day. The submarine made an unsuccessful attack off Yevpatoria on a ship escorted by Regele Ferdinand on the early morning of 22 September. On the night of 9/10 November, the sisters escorted minelayers as they laid a minefield off Sevastopol. The minefield was enlarged between 14 and 16 November as Regele Ferdinand and MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti covered the minelayers.Hervieux, p. 81; Rohwer, p. 275 Regele Ferdinand en route to Sevastopol, 1944 Successful Soviet attacks in early 1944 cut the overland connection of the Crimea with the rest of Ukraine and necessitated its supply by sea. In early April another offensive occupied most of the peninsula and encircled Sevastopol. The Romanians began evacuating the city on 14 April, with their destroyers covering the troop convoys. Four days later, the cargo ship was unsuccessfully attacked by the submarines and . Shortly after the latter submarine missed with her pair of torpedoes, the freighter was bombed and set on fire by Soviet aircraft. Other ships rescued her passengers and crew after they abandoned ship, but the sisters were dispatched to see if she could be salvaged. They put a skeleton crew aboard to operate her pumps and to stabilise her before a pair of tugboats arrived the next morning to tow her to Constan»õa.Axworthy, pp. 342‚Äì343; Hervieux, pp. 82‚Äì83; Rohwer, p. 319 Adolf Hitler suspended the evacuation on 27 April, but relented on 8 May after further Soviet attacks further endangered the Axis forces in Sevastopol as they closed within artillery range of the harbour. Regele Ferdinand arrived at Sevastopol harbour during the early morning of 11 May and loaded troops before departing later that morning. Soviet air attacks began at 06:00 and lasted until 10:30. The exposed troops and her AA gunners suffered the most from strafing of her decks by aircraft and bomb splinters, but one bomb struck the bridge and killed two officers. Other hits started small fires, but the biggest problem was an unexploded bomb that pierced the port oil tank, causing a major leak. At 09:30 she was engaged by Soviet coastal artillery, but suppressed them with her counter fire. About an hour later, her captain radioed for help, shortly before the final attacks destroyed her radio room and damaged her starboard fuel lines; despite passing oil hand-to-hand in a bucket brigade, the ship ran out of fuel early the following morning and had to be towed a short distance to Constan»õa.Axworthy, pp. 343‚Äì344; Hervieux, p. 83; Rohwer, p. 319 Regele Ferdinand was damaged during a Soviet airstrike on Constan»õa on 20 August with 47 men killed.Axworthy, p. 345; Hervieux, p. 87; Rohwer, p. 351 After King Michael's Coup on 23 August, Romania declared war on the Axis Powers. Regele Ferdinand remained in harbour until she was seized by the Soviets on 5 September together with the rest of the Romanian Navy.Axworthy, p. 345; Hervieux, p. 88 Before being renamed Likhoy on 20 October, the ship was commissioned into the Soviet Navy on 14 September as part of the Black Sea Fleet, along with her sister.

Regele Ferdinand was renamed D21 when the Romanian destroyers were assigned numbers when the Destroyer Division was redesignated as the 418th Destroyer Division in 1952. The ship continued to serve until April 1961, when she was discarded and subsequently scrapped.

After the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941 (Operation Barbarossa), she took part in the Raid on Constan»õa a few days later and may have damaged a Soviet destroyer leader during the battle. The powerful Soviet Black Sea Fleet heavily outnumbered Axis naval forces in the Black Sea and the Romanian destroyers were limited to escort duties in the western half of the Black Sea during the war. In early 1944 the Soviets were able to cut off and surround the port of Sevastopol on the Crimean Peninsula. Regina Maria covered convoys evacuating Axis troops from Sevastopol in May and rescued several hundred herself. Later that year Romania switched sides, but despite that the Soviets seized the Romanian ships and incorporated them into the Soviet Navy. Renamed Letuchiy, the ship served until she was struck from the navy list in 1951 when she was returned to the Romanians who renamed her D22 in 1952. The ship was discarded in 1961 and subsequently scrapped. Background and design Following the end of World War I and the re-purchase of two s from Italy, the Romanian Government decided to order also two modern destroyers from the Pattison Yard in Italy, as part of the 1927 Naval Programme. The design was based on the British Shakespeare- class destroyer leaders, but differed in the arrangement of their propulsion machinery. The guns were imported from Sweden and the fire-control system from Germany.Twardowski, pp. 359, 361 Four destroyers were intended to be ordered, but only two were actually built. The Regele Ferdinand-class ships had an overall length of , a beam of , and a mean draught of . They displaced at standard load and at deep load. Their crew numbered 212 officers and sailors.Whitley, p. 224 The ships were powered by two Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving a single propeller, using steam provided by four Thornycroft boilers.Twardowski, p. 361 The turbines were designed to produce for a speed of , although the Regele Ferdinands reached during their sea trials.Whitley, pp. 224‚Äì225 They could carry of fuel oil which gave them a range of at a speed of . The main armament of the Regele Ferdinand-class ships consisted of five 50-calibre Bofors guns in single mounts, two superfiring pairs fore and aft of the superstructure and one gun aft of the rear funnel. For anti-aircraft defense, they were equipped with one Bofors anti-aircraft (AA) gun between the funnels and a pair of AA guns. The ships were fitted with two triple mounts for torpedo tubes and could carry 50 mines and 40 depth charges.Axworthy, p. 348 They were equipped with a Siemens fire-control system which included a pair of rangefinders, one each for the fore and aft guns.Whitley, p. 225 Modifications The 40-millimetre guns were replaced by two German AA guns and a pair of French M1929 Hotchkiss machineguns were added in 1939.

Queen Marie visited her namesake on 22 June 1932 which made a short cruise to Balchik, Bulgaria, that same day. Regina Maria participated in the Coronation Fleet review for King George VI on 19 May 1937 at Spithead. A few days after the invasion of the Soviet Union (Operation Barbarossa) on 22 June 1941, a pair of destroyer leaders, and , began bombarding Constan»õa in the early hours of 26 June. The Romanians were expecting a Soviet raid and their defences, consisting of Regina Maria, the flotilla leader and the heavy guns of the German coastal artillery battery Tirpitz, were prepared to engage the Soviet ships. In ten minutes, starting from 03:58, Moskva and Kharkov fired no less than 350 shells from their guns. The two Romanian warships returned fire with their guns at distances between , but only knocked Moskvas mainmast down. The two Soviet ships were silhouetted against the dawn while the Romanian ships were hidden by the coast behind them. The heavy and accurate Axis fire caused Moskva and Kharkov to begin to withdraw while laying down a smoke screen. As they fell back they entered a Romanian minefield and Moskva sank after striking a mine.Axworthy, p. 331; Hervieux, pp. 70‚Äì71; Rohwer, pp. 82‚Äì83 Massively outnumbered by the Black Sea Fleet, the Romanian ships were kept behind the minefields defending Constan»õa for the next several months, training for convoy escort operations.

Johnstone has traveled extensively worldwide both teaching, playing, recording and broadcasting in the field of Scottish traditional music and has also been interviewed on her expertise in this area.  Compositions  Johnstone has composed over 800 pieces of music in the Scottish genre many of which are for dancing. Many of her pieces are commissioned to celebrate events, festivals and to complement newly devised dances. Her Scottish dance music includes reels, jigs, strathspeys, pastoral airs and waltzes while her additional repertoire encompasses other forms of music inspired variously by landscape, nature or the written word. She is currently working on music to accompany a Scottish historical documentary. In 2004, Johnstone composed and arranged music for The Scotia Suite of Scottish Country Dances devised by Roy Goldring. This commission from The Royal Scottish Geographical Society was to honour the achievements of William Speirs Bruce commemorating the voyage of the Scotia, the research vessel of the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition 1902‚Äì1904. Some of Johnstone's pieces were later performed on two separate occasions at the Smithsonian Institution, Washington DC.

He was born in Moscow into a family with a strong engineering background. He went to school No.64 in Moscow in 1933. In 1941, he was evacuated to the Ural Mountains with his mother and sister. He passed the external examinations for 10th grade in 1942 and began a correspondence course of the Moscow State University in Sverdlovsk Oblast. On his return to Moscow in 1943, he joined the motor faculty of the Moscow Aviation Institute, while continuing his University studies. He moved to the engineering and physical faulty of the Moscow Mechanical Institute of Munitions as a third-year student. In 1947, he graduated with honours from his Moscow State University course. The following year he entered postgraduate study under Igor Tamm. On 10 June 1948, Tamm headed a new group of theorists which included Andrei Sakharov, Vitaly Ginzburg, S.Z. Belenky and Romanov. They followed up Sakharov's ideas for a new thermonuclear weapon and went to KB-11 (now the All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Experimental Physics) in the closed city of Sarov, Nizhny Novgorod. He started as a junior researcher, then senior, then head of department. In 1952, he received a degree in Physical and Mathematical Sciences with a thesis on kinetic processes of neutrons. This work on neutrons and efficiency continued, along with calculations on nuclear reaction kinetics and energy release of the Soviet Union's first thermonuclear weapon, the RDS-6, tested in 1953; for this he was awarded the Stalin Prize, the first of several awards. He was a leading developer of the RDS-37 - the first Soviet two-stage thermonuclear weapon - most specifically concerned with the power output. Romanov transferred to the new Scientific Research Institute-1011 as head of the theoretical department in 1955. Two years later, his team had developed a new megatonne-yield bomb design. He gained a Ph.D. in Physical and Mathematical Sciences in 1958 and was appointed to professorship of theoretical physics in 1962. From the early 1960s, from his own initial ideas, Romanov supervised many underground nuclear irradiation experiments to evaluate the effects of nuclear explosions on equipment in space. He returned to KB-11 in 1967 as deputy supervisor and, in 1969, head of the theoretical sector 2. He remained there for nearly three decades, working on anti-missile defence and became chief scientific officer. He was a member of a number of commissions and committees which assessed theses and awarded prizes. In addition to his nuclear weapon and defence research, he wrote papers on the quasilinear theory of plasma turbulence, cosmic plasmas, gravitational spinors, laser-driven thermonuclear fusion and long-range fields Amongst his hobbies, he enjoyed playing chess and piano (particularly Chopin and Beethoven). He was also known for writing amusing poetic portraits of friends and colleagues. He died in Sarov.

Universities in the United Kingdom, including Oxford and Cambridge, have been targets, as have institutions in the US and Australia. Universities are targets for cyber espionage due to the wealth of personally identifiable information they possess on students, employees, people who buy tickets to sporting events, and, if the university has an academic medical center, on patients treated there. Information about research projects with industrial or military application are also targets. The culture of information sharing within universities tends to make them easy targets. Breaches can occur from people sharing credentials, phishing, web-crawlers inadvertently finding exposed access points, password cracking, and other standard hacking methods. University credentials are bought and sold on web forums, darknet markets and other black markets. The result of such efforts have included theft of military research into missile design or stealth technologies, as well as medical data. As a precaution against such attacks, Stanford University advises its employees to take IT precautions when they travel abroad. Moreover, in March 2018, the U.S. charged and sanctioned nine Iranians and the Iranian company Mabna Institute for hacking and attempting to hack hundreds of universities on behalf of the Iranian government. Credentials used by Sci-Hub to access paywalled scientific articles have been subsequently used by hackers seeking to breach university firewalls to access other information.

After espousing virulently neo-fascistic and segregationist views in the 1950s under the tutelage of Pound, Wand moved to California in the 60s and became a supporter of the Black Power movement, seeing parallels between the Asian-American and African-American experience.  Early life  Wand was born on December 28, 1931 in Hangzhou, China, and claimed to be a direct descendant of Tang dynasty poet Wang Wei (699‚Äì759). He attended St. John's Middle School in Shanghai, and fled to the United States as a refugee from the Communist Revolution in 1949. While Wand's family was anti-communist, he expressed admiration for Mao's poetry and considered Chiang Kai-shek \\"an intellectual midget.\\" He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1955, studying English and Italian and joining the Beta Theta Pi fraternity. In 1955, Wand (writing as David Rafael Wang) began corresponding with Ezra Pound, who was incarcerated at St. Elizabeths Hospital following his arrest and trial for treason against the United States in 1945. In their letters, Wand and Pound discussed their shared interest in Confucius and Chinese written characters, with Wand calling Pound ‚Äúthe greatest poet writing in the English language\\" and Pound taking particular interest in Wand's name's middle logogram (Ááä), lifting its meaning \\"flame-style king\\" for the ideogram of the 1959 Thrones Cantos.  New York   Correspondences with Ezra Pound  After graduating from Dartmouth, Wand moved to New York, where he worked a series of odd jobs while continuing his correspondence with Pound (he visited him at St. Elizabeths in 1956). Increasingly neo-fascistic, antisemitic and segregationist in his worldview, Wand sought Pound for guidance, writing in October 1957, ‚ÄúFor eugenics' sake, please tell me what the best books on money issue are.\\" He frequently wrote in praise of far-right activist (and fellow Pound devotee) John Kasper and in support of racial purity and eugenic breeding, exclaiming in a July 12, 1957 letter that: > My impression of the French is that they are of all Europeans the closest to > the kikes in spirit and nature. 11 years of living under the French in > Shanghai have taught me that they are more beastly than the Japs. The > Italians and the Germans were the only Europeans who acted civilized. I am > for a united Europe under the rule of either Germany or Italy. Adolf and > Benito were certainly close to saints. Wand believed strongly in male chauvinism, recounting a disagreement with a female friend that \\"Adolf knew where women should belong more than any other political leaders. Told her that glorification of the ‚ÄòNew Woman' by murky thinkers like Ibsen and GBS has lead [sic] to family disunity and political chaos in the West.\\" Despite opposition to miscegenation, Wand justified marriage proposals to Marcella Spann and Sherri Martinelli on the grounds that their offspring would be genetically superior. While Wand expressed hostility for homosexuals and \\"effeminate\\" intellectuals, railing against ‚Äúintellectual molly-coddles,\\" ‚Äúeffeminate weaklings,‚Äù ‚Äúliberaloid eggheads,\\" and ‚Äúmilksop ‚ÄòPoundians',‚Äù he declared his admiration for physically fit men of action: the \\"plain jock,\\" \\"prizefighters and cattlebreeders,\\" and imagined setting up gymnasium-bookstores where men could work out and \\"exchange ideas and practice target-shooting, which may come in handy later in dealing with the Dulleses and Stevensons etc.\\" He wrote to Pound about his intention to become a sports writer and wrote poems about bodybuilders and Elvis Presley, whom he saw as a hero because he ‚Äúat least makes one feel like fucking or busting the noses of some spineless poetic jerks like Richard Eberhart and W. H. Auden and murdering some filthy intellectual scumbags like Adlai Stevenson and/or Anthony Eden.\\" In 1957, Wand organized the ‚ÄúNorth American Citizens for the Constitution: An Affiliation of the Whib Party\\" (Whib was an acronym that Pound invented for \\"Wheat in bread\\" based on his interest in grain-rites), an intellectual front for John Kasper's segregationist activities that sought to carry his ideas to Ivy League campuses. The NACC supported \\"racial integrity,\\" states' rights, and the right to bear arms while opposing \\"the forced integration of races,\\" the NAACP, the Urban League, and the Anti-Defamation League. They accused President Eisenhower of treason and threatened \\"Marxist, usurer, race-mixer, degenerate politician, we pledge eternal vigilance, eternal combativeness, even death!\\" Wand's activities with the NACC compelled a former Dartmouth classmate, David Rattray, to accuse him in a November 1957 issue of The Nation of supporting ‚Äúthe cause of white supremacy\\" and of ‚Äútouring the Ivy League colleges with the purpose of setting up White Citizens' councils on the campuses.\\" Wand, in a letter to the editor in December 1957, wrote that > My main purpose in life is to fight against bigotry and racial prejudice > while upholding the separate but equal station to which the laws of nature > have entitled us. I am strongly against forced integration. I am strongly > against miscegenation. I am against those who have lost their racial > integrity and desire to be assimilated with the white race. Wand later suggested that the Nation article cost him his job at a local YMCA, and made him fear deportation to China. Wand's correspondences with Ezra Pound ended in 1958, shortly after Pound's release from St. Elizabeth's and subsequent return to Italy.  Collaboration with William Carlos Williams  Pound and Noel Stock put Wand in touch with William Carlos Williams after Williams expressed admiration for Wand's English translations of Chinese poetry in Edge, writing that his poems \\"are worth the trip half way round the world to have encountered.‚Äù Wand visited Williams's house in Rutherford, New Jersey in March 1957 and the two began collaborating on a poetry collection, \\"The Cassia Tree\\" (published in New Directions in 1966, after Williams's death), in which Wand provided word-by-word translations of 37 Tang and Song- era poems and Williams turned them into English poems. Williams encouraged Wand to work on The Grandfather Cycle, a sequence of 101 cantos (mirroring Pound's Cantos) that Wand had begun in 1956. The unfinished work was meant to feature Wand's \\"fabulous ancestors,\\" including his grandfather Wang Fenggao, one of the last mandarin civil servants and founder of Guanghua University in Shanghai, with \\"comments on sex, marriage, and prostitution, and references to Eugenics.\\" In one canto, Wand describes his grandfather, the protagonist, and his sexual prowess and diverse progeny: > In Shanghai / by the Yangtze River / Where I watched / the ships / Coming in > going out / of the harbor / And the tiny sampans / tremulous on the wave, / > I used to sit / beneath the peach blossoms / Near the Lungwha Tower, / with > swallows / Dipping over my head / and sandcrabs / Scurrying near my feet / > And think about / The epic fornications / of my Fabulous / Grandfather. / > Great man! / He sired / Eight sons / and some / Twenty bastards / by / Three > wives / and / Four dozen / Concubines / in an age / when virginity / Was the > eunuch's lot / and polygamy / the strong man's goal. / His offspring / > Multiplied, / Spread from / Hangchow to / London, / Paris to / Mukden‚Äî / > Some begotten / On ships, / Some made / in sampans; / All different: / > Blonde hair, /Grey eyes, / Widow's peak, / Curly beard, / Till even / Tao- > Kwan & / T'ung Tse, / the emperors, / became envious of / him, / the plucker > of peaches & apple blossoms. Eliot Weinberger, writing on Wand's artistic influences and outspoken bigotry, notes the difference between his relationship with Pound (who was an outspoken bigot) and Williams (who wasn't): > What interests me [...] is that not only Pound (from whom we expect such > things) but Williams and others were not merely tolerating but working with > people like Wang in the 1950s‚Äîregardless of the daily reports of > segregationist violence. That is, although Williams (unlike Pound) probably > disagreed with Wang's extremism, his racism and political fanaticism were > still considered as minor peccadilloes to be excused in the Artist.  West Coast  Wand left New York for San Francisco in 1958, where he began as a reporter for The Chinese World, a bilingual newspaper based on Chinatown. In 1959, he enrolled in a creative writing program at San Francisco State College, where he continued to work on cantos for The Grandfather Cycle. While spending time at local bookstores, he met Gary Snyder, Philip Whalen, Clarence Major, and Cid Corman. After receiving his M.A. in 1961, Wand moved to Honolulu, where he taught at both the University of Hawaii and Iolani Preparatory School until 1964. While in Hawaii, Wand became acquainted with Hawaiian and Samoan oral poetry, and published several translations into English. In 1964, Wand moved to Los Angeles, where he began teaching at Santa Ana College and Santa Monica City College, and then enrolled in the Comparative Literature doctoral program at USC. In an arranged marriage set up by his mother in 1966, he married Yuet-fun and had one daughter. Of his poetry in the 1960s and 1970s, Wand told James Laughlin, ‚ÄúOther than Mao Tse-tung and two other poets in Hong Kong, I am about the leading modern Chinese poet [...] No other Chinese poet has blended the Greco-Sino-Samurai African tradition in poetry as I have done.\\" Ashe explained, \\"in my writing I aim at the concision of the Greek epigram, the warmth and geniality of T'ang shih and Sung tz'u, the virility and martial spirit of the Zen-samurai arts, and the form and changes of jazz.\\"  Two identities  In California, Wand became increasingly outspoken about his twin identities as a poet and an academic, and the separate names‚ÄîDavid Rafael Wang and David Hsin-Fu Wand‚Äîthat corresponded to them. In 1974, he said that > \\"My role as poet has been kept distinct from my role as professor, and the > two identities coexist in a symbiotic relationship much as Dr. Haggard and > Mr, Jive. As David Hsin-Fu Wand I am chiefly a critic and teacher of English > and comparative literature, while as David Rafael Wang I am a poet, found by > most of my friends to be rather anti-intellectual in my poetry. In 1975, Wand released The Intercourse, a poetry collection that focused heavily on the physicality of the body, including poems about dance, gymnastics, bodybuilding, surfing, bathing, and heterosexual and homosexual encounters. The collection continues to espouse male chauvinist attitudes toward sexuality but also expresses sympathy for the Black Power movement: in one poem, he writes ‚ÄúIf you don't get this, man, dig: / Us spade cats will shovel white trash / into the underground furnace of love.\\" As an academic, completed his doctorate in 1972, entitling his dissertation Cathay Revisited: The Chinese Tradition in the Poetry of Ezra Pound and Gary Snyder. In 1974, he taught at the University of New Mexico, where he incorporated martial arts demonstrations into his lectures about Asian poetry, citing the samurai tradition of the warrior-poet. He expressed admiration for Muhammad Ali and discussed poetry with him during Ali's visit to Albuquerque. At the time of his death, Wand held a Comparative Literature position at the University of Texas at Dallas.  Promoting Asian-American literature  In 1974, Wand released an anthology of contemporary Asian-American writers entitled Asian- American Heritage: An Anthology of Prose and Poetry, which included works by writers of Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Filipino descent. Contributors to the anthology include Chung Ling, John Hideyo Hamamura, Sadakichi Hartmann, Richard E. Kim, Kim Yong-Ik, Alexander Kuo, Stephen S. N. Liu, Pardee Lowe, Wing Tek Lum, Suzi Mee, Janice Mirikitani, Toshio Mori, Paul Motoyoshi, Jr., Francis Naohiko Oka, John Okada, Daniel I. Okimoto, Irvin Paik, Jose Garcia Villa, and Hisaye Yamamoto, as well as many translations of Samoan and Hawaiian poetry by Armand Schwerner and Wand himself (credited as David Rafael Wang). Wand justifies including Polynesian oral translations because \\"Polynesian-American literature [...] belongs to American literature as much as Amerindian lores [...] It belongs to Asian-American literature because Hawaiians and Samoans are native Americans of the fiftieth state, which is geographically a part of Southeast Asia.\\" In his introduction, Wand explores the question of Asian American identity: > Refusing to be \\"whitewashed\\" or \\"enlightened,\\" these younger Asian-Americans > are proud of being Americans of Asian ancestry.

In 1975, the Modern Language Association appointed Wand to their Commission on Minority Groups, at the time chaired by critic Mar√≠a Teresa Bab√≠n Cort√©s.  Death  Wand died on April 7, 1977 during a meeting of the Commission on Minority Groups at the Barbizon Plaza Hotel in New York. Authorities reported that he fell out of his 11th floor window, although whether he committed suicide, fell by accident, or was pushed remains unclear. His autopsy report ruled out foul play.

It is fitted with specialised equipment to simulate various emergency scenarios. Two examples are used by the Swiss Air Force.  History  X-5098 at Emmen AFB The Swiss Air Force operates a number of McDonnell Douglas F/A-18C Hornet aircraft. Training of ground crew in emergency procedures initially required diversion of an aircraft from operational duties. Swiss fibreglass cabin construction specialists Hugo Wolf AG began design studies for a training simulator in 2009 and it evolved into a proposal for a Mobile Training Installation Ground Operations, in the form of a realistic and interactive non-flying mock-up. This was seen as a cost- effective alternative to diverting operational aircraft.F/A 18 Simulator f√ºr Luftwaffe (\\"F/A-18 simulator for the Air Force\\"), Hugo Wolf AG, 13 June 2013.

Formally designated a Boeing F/A-18C Hornet (Hugo Wolf), it is registered as aircraft serial number X-5099.Milit√§rische Kennungen (2017) The simulator is transportable and is periodically moved by road between the various airfields used by the Swiss Air Force, including Milit√§rflugplatz Emmen , Meiringen Air Base, Sion Airport and Z√ºrich Airport. The first mock-up proved effective and high demand led to the ordering of a second unit, incorporating various improvements, in 2016. Designated X-5098, it was delivered in 2017. This more capable simulator is also more difficult to transport and so it is permanently located at Payerne Air Base.  Design and construction The mock-up is an accurate representation of the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18C Hornets used by the Swiss Air Force and is based on data supplied by the aircraft manufacturer. With an overall length of , span of and weighing about two-thirds as much as the real aircraft, the primary structure is of wood, metal and GRP composite materials\\"Eine F/A-18 unterwegs auf der Autobahn\\" (An F/A-18 on the Autobahn), 20 Minuten, 16 April 2014.Erwin Munter; \\"Weshalb eine nachgebaute F/A-18 durch Seftigen fuhr\\" (Why a replica F/A-18 drove through Seftigen), Berner Zeitung, 18 April 2013.

The wing hard points are functional, allowing the attachment of external stores which are also integrated into the system.F/A 18C Mock-Up, Hugo Wolf. brochure (retrieved 6 February 2016) The simulator is fitted with additional specialised equipment for recreating many rescue scenarios. Supporting equipment includes an onboard power supply and control computer. Training features An instructor can set the rig to simulate engine fires, overheated and glowing Landing gear and smoke in the cockpit. The simulator can reproduce realistic engine noise and fuel leaks (using water) from both internal and external tankage, Dummy AIM-120 AMRAAM and AIM-9 Sidewinder weapons and external fuel tanks may be fitted to any of the external hard points. The cockpit is partly furnished with original American instruments and fittings, including the Ejection seat, for use in conjunction with the powered canopy. Training scenarios designed for include routine aircraft ground handling, pilot rescue, aircraft fires, fuel leaks, runway excursions, engine shutdown and deactivation of live ordnance, either individually or in combination. The second example, X-5098, has additional capabilities, including a retractable nose undercarriage to simulate collapse. Both preset and user-defined scenarios can be controlled via a remote tablet.\\"Auftrag f√ºr die Luftwaffe\\" (Order for the Air Force), Hugo Wolf, 23 June 2016.

The terrain is unforested, flat, and marshy. The area is an important stopover spot for migratory birds, including many vulnerable species. It has an area of , and is in the Flooded grasslands and savannas biome.  Location and description  The headwaters of the Ussuri River cross the northern edge of the ecoregion, Lake Khanka dominates the middle, and the Suifen River (Razdolnaya River in Russian) feeds the lake from the south. The lake straddles the border between Heilongjiang Province in China to the west, and Primorsky Krai in Russia to the east. The only outflow from Lake Khanka is the Songacha River, a tributary of the Ussuri, and eventually the Amur River. The entire area is known as the Khanka Depression, as it is a lowland surrounded by mountains and higher ground. The ecoregion is surrounded by the Manchurian mixed forests on the north, west, and south, and the Ussuri broadleaf and mixed forests on the east.  Climate  The region has a Humid continental climate - cool summer subtype (Koppen classification Dwb). This climate is characterized by high variation in temperature, both daily and seasonally; with long, cold winters and short, cool summers with no averaging over . Mean precipitation is about 600 mm/year. The mean temperature at the center of the ecoregion is in January, and in July.  Flora and fauna  Much of the surrounding area is a mire type of wetland: characterized by living, peat-forming plants. The most common forms of mire are wet meadows and grass bogs. Underlying the area is a thick layer of clay that prevents drainage through the soil. Species diversity is high due to the favorable conditions; Endemism is high because the area was not glaciated in the Pleistocene, creating in the area both a refuge and a migratory route for species. As the largest freshwater lake in the Russian Far East, Lake Khanka is an important nesting and migratory spot for bird - most importantly the waterfowl that use the area for nesting, staging, and feeding. 49 species of waterfowl have been recorded including 24 species of ducks, 9 of geese, 5 of divers, and 5 of others. During the spring flyover, populations of up to 500,000 geese have been recorded; duck populations also reach into the hundreds of thousands. Over 361 species of birds have been noted in the ecoregion. Four species of crane are found in the ecoregion, including the endangered Red-crowned crane (Manchurian crane).  Protections  Significant protected areas in the ecoregion include: * Khanka Nature Reserve, a Russian strict nature reserve on the southern shores and marshes of Lake Khanka. * Xingkai Lake National Nature Reserve, covers 2,225 km2 of the northern floodplain an portion of Lake Khanka on the Chinese side. Managed in a transboundary agreement with Khanka Nature Reserve in Russia. * Lake Khanka - Ramsar Wetland Site of International Importance.

It was designed by Moray Callum at Ghia and unveiled in 1993 at the Geneva Motor Show alongside the Aston Martin DB7, designed by Moray's older brother, Ian Callum. Built to gauge interest for a 4-door Aston Martin model, the concept was well received, but never went into production as Ford decided that the Lagonda brand would be too expensive to revive due to its relative obscurity outside of the U.K. Interior Design by David Wilkie: Colour and materials by Sally Ericson.  Specifications  The Lagonda Vignale is based on an extended 1990 Lincoln Town Car chassis and uses that car's 4.6 L Ford Modular V8 engine producing and of torque and mated to a 4-speed automatic transmission. It also shares the Town Car's independent front, and solid rear suspension. It was planned that a production version of the Lagonda Vignale would utilise a , 48 valve V12 engine, the same one later used, albeit in an overhauled state, in the Aston Martin V12 Vanquish. The body of the Lagonda Vignale is made from composite materials and features nickel trim in place of chrome to take advantage of the subtle tones found in nickel. The interior was designed by David Wilkie and its materials were chosen by Sally Wilson. It features analine-dyed parchment leather, beech wood and aluminum trim, woolen carpets and headliner, nickel brightwork and rear power operated desks which feature a laptop on one side and a vanity on the other.  Production  Three Lagonda Vignales were built in total. The original two, built by Ghia, had seating for five and used the Town Car 4.6 L V8 engine. One was finished in grey while the other was finished in Sorrento Blue. The grey car was destroyed, while the blue car was sold in 2002 by Ford for US$403,500 at auction, surpassing its estimate of US$60,000‚Äì120,000. The third car, built by the Works Service department and codenamed DP2138, featured a myriad of changes from the original design with the intention of putting the car into production. It used a different Ford platform, giving it smaller dimensions, changes to the design, including different headlights and a redesigned grille, burgundy paintwork, and, most notably, the 5.9 L V12 engine originally planned for the concept. Additionally, it could only seat four as the rear bench seat had been replaced by twin armchairs. Only one example was built and it was sold to the Sultan of Brunei for ¬£1.3m in 1995.

Education  Diamond graduated from Bucknell University in 2005 and then gained her Ph.D. in the field of biology from the Kingsolver Lab at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2010. Until 2013, she worked as a Post-Doctoral Research Assistant in the Department of Biological Sciences at North Carolina State University.  Career and research  Since 2014, Diamond has been an assistant professor in the Department of Biology at Case Western Reserve University. In 2017, she was appointed as the George B. Mayer Chair in Urban and Environmental Studies. Much of Diamond's research focuses on predicting how ecological systems and biological organisms will respond to novel environments. Utilizing field study, laboratory research, and computational modeling, she examines the environmental forces that drive organisms to change and the mechanisms that organisms may employ in order to evolve and cope. Diamond's scientific publications have been cited over 1600 times as of November, 2018. Diamond's most-cited publication is \\"Synthetic analyses of phenotypic selection in natural populations: lessons, limitations and future directions.\\" In this publication, she takes a meta-approach towards analyzing the thousands of published estimations of phenotypic selection, and she uses her analysis to consider how these past estimations may guide her future estimations. Her second-most cited publication is \\"Phenotypic Selection in Natural Populations: What Limits Directional Selection?\\" In it, she explores the implications of direct selection, which is a form of natural selection that favors dominant genes over non-dominant genes. Diamond's research predicts how plants and animals will react to the changing climate and also provides insight into how human behavior affects the mechanisms that force these changes, and how humans may be able to mitigate or avoid those mechanisms. In recognition of her work, Diamond was elected as an Early Career Fellow. Awards and recognition * Early Career Fellow of the Ecological Society of America, 2018.

Having been convicted of corruption in 2004, he received significant attention in 2019 when he successfully filed a lawsuit against the General Elections Commission to run for his second term in the legislative body. Background Mohamad Taufik was born in Jakarta on 3 January 1957. Career He was the head of the Jakarta office of the General Elections Commission (KPU), but he was sentenced guilty of corruption in 2004 and was imprisoned for 18 months. Councillor In the 2014 Indonesian legislative election, Taufik ran as a Gerindra candidate for the Jakarta DPRD and won a seat. He was later appointed as deputy speaker of the body. Following the 2014 presidential election, in which Prabowo Subianto lost, Taufik demanded the head of KPU be arrested, accusing him of cheating by opening ballot boxes. This statement, delivered in front of a crowd protesting the results, caused KPU officials to report Taufik to the police. In the same year, after the resignation of previous governor Joko Widodo, Taufik was brought up as a possible candidate to replace either his gubernatorial seat or the deputy governor seat - which was held by Basuki Tjahaja Purnama (Ahok), who strongly protested Taufik's appointment. Later on, the two would come into conflict often, with Taufik boycotting Ahok during his blasphemy trial. Taufik later proposed that the city government entirely subsidize ticket fees for the Jakarta MRT. 2019 election For the 2019 election, KPU had introduced a new regulation barring, among others, candidates who had been convicted of graft before from running. Despite this, Taufik registered for reelection, and KPU demanded his party remove him from the candidates list. Taufik then filed an appeal to the Supreme Court of Indonesia, with the approving him to run. Eventually, he was approved by Jakarta's KPU as one of the candidates.

It is the first modern twin cylinder motorcycle developed by the company. In 2017, the company revealed a new motorcycle reviving the classic RE 1960s name \\"Interceptor\\". The model, which will be on sale from 2019, has two versions: the \\"Interceptor\\", a conventionally-styled roadster, and the \\"Continental GT\\", a caf√© racer. The bike will be marketed in India, Europe and the United States. The bike is expected to become the biggest selling large-capacity twin in the world.Bike magazine report pp. 32-39 - December 2018 Design The bike was designed at Royal Enfield's Technology Centre at Bruntingthorpe Proving Ground in Leicestershire, England. Both models, Interceptor and Continental GT, share the same engine, frame, suspension, wheels, brakes, exhausts and silencers. The engine is a wet-sump, 648 cc, air-cooled SOHC, 8v, parallel twin. Fuelling is via Bosch injection and engine management. The low 9.5:1 compression ratio will help the engine tolerate lower-octane fuel. The crankshaft has a 270¬∞ throw, with a gear-driven balance shaft ahead of the crank. The slipper clutch drives a six-speed gearbox and chain final drive. The cylinder head receives substantial oil-cooling and the bikes have a large oil cooler on the frame downtubes. Producing a modest 47bhp @ 7250 rpm, the engine is capable of future development: Bike magazine reported that \\"the crankshaft's substantial bearing area and the hefty alloy crankcases suggest that the engine could comfortably deliver more power. Compression, capacity and revs could be raised on future models\\". The chassis is a tubular twin-downtube cradle frame. Forks are standard telescopics (without gaiters); and rear suspension is via twin shocks. The ABS brakes comprise single discs: 320mm (front) and 240mm (rear). Instruments are conventional twin-dial analogue items with digital fuel gauge and trip display.Bike magazine report pp. 32-39 - December 2018 Interceptor The Interceptor is a conventionally-styled roadster with dual seat, a rounded 13.7 litre saddle tank with a Royal Enfield classic badge and a Monza-style fuel cap. The braced handlebars and more forward-set footrests allow a sit-up-and-beg riding position, and a tubular grab-rail is fitted for the pillion passenger.Bike magazine report pp. 32-39 - December 2018 The Interceptor is marketed as the INT650 in the United States where Honda has a trademark on the Interceptor name. Continental GT A continental GT twin The Continental GT caf√© racer has either a standard dual- seat or an optional solo seat with a seat hump. The fuel tank is more angular than the roadster's. Clip-on handlebars and rear-set pegs allow a sportier riding position.Bike magazine report pp. 32-39 - December 2018 Reception The Interceptor was favourably reviewed by Motorcycle News which stated, \\"As an overall package, the Royal Enfield Interceptor is great. The engine is lively without being intimidating, the handling is fun without being patronising and the finish is good without breaking the bank\\". The bike's engine, brakes, and equipment were all praised, but the suspension was criticised as basic, being too soft and underdamped.MCN review The Australian website, MC-News also gave a favourable report.MC-News review Royal Enfield 650 Continental GT Motorcycle Test - Royal Enfield 650 Interceptor Review MC News 31 October 2018, Retrieved 4 February 2019 See also * Royal Enfield Interceptor * 270¬∞ parallel twins * The crossplane concept References Interceptor Category:Motorcycles introduced in 2017 ","title":"Royal Enfield Interceptor 650"},{"id":"58902618","text":"Denis Burgarella (born May 8, 1960 in Marseille, France)https://www.futura- sciences.com/sciences/personnalites/astronomie-denis-burgarella-785/ is a French astrophysicist working at Laboratoire d'astrophysique de Marseille.

A son of al-Sari ibn al-Hakam, he was the third and last member of his family to autonomously rule over parts of Egypt during the troubled period following the great Abbasid civil war, and his surrender to Abdallah ibn Tahir in 826 marked the re-imposition of firm Abbasid control over the province for the first time since the outbreak of the conflict.  Career  Ubaydallah was the son of al-Sari ibn al-Hakam, a member of the abna al-dawla who had served as governor of Egypt in 816 and 817‚Äì820. Following the death of al-Sari in 820 Ubaydallah was appointed as prefect of police by his brother Abu Nasr,; . who had assumed the governorship, and upon Abu Nasr's own death in 822 he was himself acclaimed as his successor and given the oath of allegiance by the army. As a result of the division of Egypt under his father, however, his effective jurisdiction extended only to the capital Fustat and the southern part of the province, while much of Lower Egypt was in the hands of Ali ibn Abd al-Aziz al-Jarawi and Andalusian raiders.; ; . Ubaydallah's rule over Egypt was initially contested by the Abbasid central government, which was still attempting to recover from the loss of authority it had incurred due to the civil war between the rival caliphs al-Amin and al-Ma'mun in 811‚Äì813, and shortly after his accession he was forced to deal with an invasion by Khalid ibn Yazid al- Shaybani, who had been delegated by al-Ma'mun to seize command of the country. Ubaydallah decided to offer resistance, and even with Ibn al-Jarawi providing assistance to Khalid he was able to win a battle against the latter on the outskirts of Fustat. Over the next few months the two sides fought several engagements; at length Ibn al-Jarawi withdrew his support and Khalid's position became seriously degraded, and by early 823 he was finally defeated and captured by Ubaydallah. His hold over Fustat now secure, Ubaydallah returned to the capital and afterwards released Khalid, allowing him to withdraw from the province to Mecca.; ; . Following the end of Khalid's campaign, Ubaydallah became focused on dealing with his rival Ibn al-Jarawi, who continued to hold Lower Egypt. Although al-Ma'mun had written to both men granting them the right to collect the land taxes in the areas they respectively controlled, the two sides quickly found an excuse to come into conflict with each other and war soon broke out. Over the course of the next several years Ubaydallah's forces invaded Lower Egypt, pillaging Mahallat al- Sharqiyun and repeatedly occupying Tinnis and Damietta, and Ibn al-Jarawi was at times forced to seek refuge in the towns along the northern Sinai. Despite this Ubaydallah was unable to fully defeat his opponent, and the latter was able to make a return to the region in mid-825.; ; . Ubaydallah's governorship came to an end in 826, when al-Ma'mun again sought to achieve greater effective control over the country by dispatching to it the Tahirid general Abdallah ibn Tahir. While Ibn al-Jarawi immediately offered his submission, Ubaydallah attempted to fight off Abdallah, but his forces were defeated and he eventually decided to seek a guarantee of safety instead. This was agreed to and Ubaydallah made his submission to Abdallah, who sent him off to Baghdad.; ; ; ; . Following this, he never returned to Egypt, but he remained in Iraq and eventually died in Samarra in 865.; .

Description Macrostomum rostratum is colourless and between in length. There are a pair of small eyes at the anterior end and a longitudinal-slit mouth on the ventral surface just behind these. A short pharynx leads from the mouth to a simple gut. Also on the ventral surface, the female gonopore, which is shaped like a rosette, is in front of the male gonopore and penis which are half way along the flatworm. The posterior end of the worm bears an adhesive plate and can spread out to stick to a surface, and the edge of this region bears rodlike rhabdites (defensive structures) in the tissues. Distribution and habitat Macrostomum rostratum occurs sporadically in the European coastline in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, typically in the splash zone in both fresh and salt water. It is present in rock pools at Oxwich Bay and Port Erin in Wales, and in these locations it is found on sea lettuce (Ulva lactuca). Further afield, it has been recorded from a brackish coastal wetland in Peru. Another place where it occurs is the heated Konin Lakes, water bodies in central Poland where the water temperature is raised by the water being discharged from power stations.

He worked for Senators Tim Kaine, Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris.  Early life and education  Gayle was born in Toronto to parents who both worked in medicine. After the family moved to Jacksonville, Florida in 1992, his mother worked as a nurse at the Mayo Clinic Florida and his father, a pediatric intensive care specialist, worked at the Wolfson Children's Hospital. Gayle grew up in Jacksonville and attended high school at the Episcopal School of Jacksonville. He contributed to his high school's newspaper and interned at WJXT and The Florida Times-Union. He also was a member of the cross-country and track teams, and won state championships as a member of the 2003 cross-country and 2005 4x800 relay teams.

Career  Gayle briefly worked for the Center for American Progress, and worked for Media Matters for America for a year. He became a driver and special assistant to Tim Kaine, the 70th Governor of Virginia, during 15 months of his 2012 Senate campaign.

Until the 2016 presidential election, Gayle worked as a spokesman for Clinton in her Brooklyn headquarters. He sent her an email recommending Kaine as her running mate: > During the 2012 campaign cycle, I traveled all across Virginia with him > spending upwards of 15 hours each day for 15 months on the road as his > special assistant. I can personally attest to his incredible character, > integrity, competency and ability to get things done. I believe he would be > a great choice, and be an effective governing partner.

His pictures are painted with house paints and written upon with ordinary No. 2 pencils. His subjects are an eclectic mix of realism, surrealism, pop art and invention. Underwood has been labelled an outsider artist, a pop artist, and a folk artist. However, unlike most folk artists, his paintings are carefully planned, often taking months of ideation prior to their execution. One critic said of the detailed planning that goes into Underwood's work that \\"what results is more a cocktail of realism, surrealism, and pop, of Edward Hopper meets Salvador Dali meets Andy Warhol.\\" He is popularly known by his first name \\"Harry\\", and distinctively signs his paintings with this moniker. Underwood's notable collectors include Susan Sarandon, Richard Linklater, Shania Twain, and Michelle Branch.  Biography  Harry Underwood was born in 1969 in Miami, Florida. His father was a carpenter and his mother worked in a supermarket. His family was deeply religious and he attended the Church of God Pentecostal church with them until 1982. He never completed high school, having been expelled for poor attendance. As a teenager, he cleaned pools at motels and bussed tables at the Capri Italian Restaurant in Florida City, Florida. He was uprooted by Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and spent time in Austin, Texas and New Orleans, Louisiana before settling in Nashville, Tennessee where he found work in the construction industry. In 1997, on a visit to New Orleans, Underwood was attacked, robbed, and taken by car at gunpoint to withdraw money from an ATM. His kidnappers threatened to shoot him and dump his body. During the ordeal, he thought of what he would like to do if he survived. After returning from the trip, he began writing, drawing, and painting. By the early 2000s, his focus outside his work as a flooring installer turned to painting. The Most World Famous by Underwood (2005)  Career  Underwood first started painting in the early 2000s while working as a flooring installer and house painter in Nashville. He discovered his color palette while going through half-used paint cans in the garage of a house at which he was working. His first major solo show was titled \\"A Pictorial History of Wishful Thinking\\" and hosted by the Estel Gallery in Nashville in 2007. Since then, his work has been exhibited at leading galleries and institutions around the world and his many collectors include celebrities such as Susan Sarandon, Richard Linklater, Shania Twain, and Michelle Branch. One of his paintings was used by Erin Rae as the cover for her critically acclaimed second album, Putting on Airs. One of the distinctive features of his paintings is the text that he includes in them. Duff Lindsay, owner of the Lindsay Gallery, which has long been synonymous with American folk and outsider art, said of the text in Underwood's paintings: \\"This is not shtick. The more you read the text in his work, you realize that this is really from the heart. His text is so revealing about his longings and uncertainties. He once told me that the imagery is retro, but the text is really what he‚Äôs thinking and feeling that day. A lot of the text is that desire for sincerity and for things to be real and fair and honest.\\"  Response to \\"outsider artist\\" label  Though labeled an outsider artist, Underwood avoids the term. When asked about it by a University of North Carolina researcher, he answered \\"I don‚Äôt think of that label as having anything to do with my vision or how I approach work each day. I don‚Äôt consider myself part of a movement. I wasn‚Äôt aware of artists like Darger or Edward Hopper until I was meeting people at my shows and they began telling me I reminded them of all that. Persistence is what making art is about. The world is designed to wreck your imagination. I don‚Äôt expect I‚Äôll be tied to folk art forever...it wouldn‚Äôt be bad if I was. A friend recently called it ‚ÄúAmericana,‚Äù and I kind of like that.\\"  Works  * Invade the Wild Kingdom * Location is Not Essential * Fine Weather From A Friendly Place * The Most World Famous * Landmark Preservation - Measuring 4' x 6', this is one of Underwood's largest works. It is on long-term display at the Belcourt Theatre in Nashville. The painting is a commentary on the uncertainty created when rapidly developing cities start to demolish historical buildings in order to make room for new construction.
