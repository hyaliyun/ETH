It has a closing design based on a glass marble which is held against a rubber seal, which sits within a recess in the lip.  Design In 1872, British soft drink maker Hiram Codd of Camberwell, London, designed and patented a bottle designed specifically for carbonated drinks. The bottle was designed and manufactured with thick glass to withstand internal pressure, and a chamber to enclose a marble and a rubber washer in the neck. The bottles are filled upside down, and pressure of the gas in the bottle forced the marble against the washer, sealing in the carbonation. The bottle is pinched into a special shape to provide a chamber into which the marble is pushed to open the bottle. This prevents the marble from blocking the neck as the drink is poured. Some older examples had the bullet shape of soda bottles. There are some people who collect antique Codd-neck bottles and marbles.  Popularity  Banta in a Codd-neck bottle Soon after its introduction, the bottle became extremely popular with the soft drink and brewing industries mainly in Europe, India and Australasia, though some alcohol drinkers disdained the use of the bottle. One etymology of the term codswallop originates from beer sold in Codd-neck bottles, though this is generally dismissed as a folk etymology. The bottles were regularly produced for many decades, but gradually declined in usage. Since children smashed the bottles to retrieve the marbles, vintage bottles are relatively scarce and have become collector items, particularly in the UK. A cobalt-coloured Codd-neck bottle can fetch hundreds of British pounds at auction. Bilas, a company in Portugal, created a soda named after the bottle design (Pirulito). However, the marble inside did not seal the liquid. Instead it was a normal cap which could be removed without breaking the bottle. Codd-neck bottles are still used for the Japanese soft drink Ramune and the Indian drink Banta.

The temple is made of over 1.5 million empty Heineken bottles and Chang beer bottles. Collection of the bottles began in 1984; it took two years to build the main temple. Thereafter, the monks continued to expand the site, and by 2009 some 20 buildings had been similarly constructed. History The story of the temple's construction states that the local Buddhist monks were seeking a means to help waste disposal and help the local area lead a greener lifestyle. Through the collection of glass beer bottles, it was decided that they could be used as a construction material. They now continue to build using bottles to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and to keep the bottles out of landfills. According to the China Daily, ‚ÄúThe Thai Buddhist temple has found an environmentally friendly way to utilize discarded bottles to reach nirvana.‚Äù Construction Detail of the bottles. The main temple is based around a concrete core, with collected bottles used as construction materials. Two types of bottles are used; green Heineken bottles and brown Chang bottles. After the local monks began to collect them in 1984 for use as a building material, the local government sent additional bottles. In addition to the bottles themselves, the bottle caps are used to create mosaics. there were a total of 20 buildings constructed in this fashion; in addition to the temple there were a crematorium, a series of prayer rooms, the local water tower, bathrooms for the use of tourists as well as several raised bungalows which are used as housing for the monks. The main temple took two years to construct, but as the materials were still available the site is continually expanded. By 2009 there were more than 1.5 million bottles in use in the construction works at the temple site, leading to Wat Pa Maha Chedi Kaew also being known as the \\"Temple of a Million Bottles\\". In 2015, it was named one of the ten leading examples of sustainable architecture by travel website When on Earth. Parenthetically, 50 years ago the Heineken company looked into changing their bottles so that they could be used as building blocks, a construction material. While nothing came of that, the monks found a way.

At the time of description C. alveolatus was one of seven fossil ant species placed in the Cephalotes coffeae clade. History and classification Cephalotes alveolatus was described from a single fossil ant preserved as an inclusion in a transparent chunk of Dominican amber. The amber was produced by the extinct Hymenaea protera, which formerly grew on Hispaniola, across northern South America and up to southern Mexico. The specimen was collected from an unidentified amber mine in the Dominican Republic. The amber dates from the Burdigalian stage of the Miocene being recovered from sections of the La Toca Formation in the Cordillera Septentrional and the Yanigua Formation in the Cordillera Oriental. At the time of description, the holotype specimen was preserved in the private collection of Joachim Scheven in Hagen, Germany. The fossil was first studied by researchers Gijsbertus Vierbergen and Joachim Scheven with their 1995 type description of the new species being published in the Creation Research Society quarterly. They placed the species into the genus Zacryptocerus, and coined the specific epithet alveolatus as a reference to the many small pits on the head and body of the worker. Living and fossil species of the genera Cephalotes, Eucryptocerus, Exocryptocerus and Zacryptocerus were examined in 1999 by Maria L. De Andrade and Cesare Baroni Urbani with a redescription of the Cephalotes being published in the journal Stuttgarter Beitr√§ge zur Naturkunde. Serie B (Geologie und Pal√§ontologie). De Andrade and Baroni Urbani concluded that Cephalotes was paraphyletic if the species placed in the other three genera were not included within the genus. As a result, Zacryptocerus alveolatus was moved to Cephalotes as C. alveolatus. The authors examined the type specimen, then still in Scheven collection, and an additional fossil worker housed in the Staatliches Museum fiir Naturkunde and placed into the species. They noted that the holotype specimen is damaged due to burning, and as such the original coloration of the worker is unidentifiable, and the integument is partially fragmented. Phylogeny Cephalotes coffeae, type species for the clade In the study of Cephalotes by de Andrade and Baroni Urbani C. alveolatus was grouped into the coffeae clade consisting of seven extinct species and four extant species. The clade shares two, possibly three distinct features between the species. Segment three of the abdomen is modified into a post petiole which in turn is modified to have large side wings. Additionally the first sternite of the gaster has a simple reticulated surface sculpturing. C. alveolatus was consistently placed as the outgroup species to the other members of the clade in de Andrade and Baroni Urbani's phylogenies, with it sharing several features with other clade species but having large amounts of distinct clubbed hairs. Description The two workers known have body lengths between , and heads that range between . The coloration seen on specimen DO-I 980 indicates black tones on the ridges and rear corners of the head along with the lamellae edges which border the pronotum. The front edges of the lamellae on the gaster are rust colored and semi-transparent. The head is almost square in outline, with broadly curved rear corners and a concave rear margin sporting two denticles. Raised ridges on the front area of the head run above the eyes and have a scalloped edge. There are a pair of round to obtuse shaped teeth flanking the sides of the mesonotum, and the propodum edges are marked with small teeth or angles. Similarly, the sides of the petiole have a pair of teeth, while the postpetiole has larger side teeth near its front that angle forward. The upper surface of the postpetile has a groove along its middle, flanked by two raised ridges. Four different types of hairs are present on the workers. On the gaster sternites sparse long pointed hairs, and long clubbed hairs are present. Similar to the long clubbed hairs are short clubbed hairs present in dense amounts on the gaster, legs and postpetiole segment, and in sparser amounts on the mesosoma sides, corners of the head and on the cernulations of the facial ridges. Lastly there are recumbent hairs on the first segment of the gaster, not originating from exoskeleton depressions, and originating from depressions across the rest of the body.

At the time of description C. caribicus was one of nine ant species placed in the Cephalotes pinelii clade. History and classification Cephalotes caribicus was described based on two fossilised specimens which were preserved as inclusions in transparent chunks of Dominican amber. The amber was produced by the extinct Hymenaea protera, which formerly grew on Hispaniola, across northern South America and up to southern Mexico. The specimens were collected from an unidentified amber mine in the Dominican Republic. The amber dates from the Burdigalian stage of the Miocene being recovered from sections of the La Toca Formation in the Cordillera Septentrional and the Yanigua Formation in the Cordillera Oriental. At the time of description, the holotype specimen was preserved in the collections of the State Museum of Natural History Stuttgart, while the paratype was part of the George O. Poinar amber collections at Oregon State University. Living and fossil Cephalotes, Eucryptocerus, Exocryptocerus and Zacryptocerus ants were examined in 1999 by Maria L. De Andrade and Cesare Baroni Urbani with a redescription of included species being published in the journal Stuttgarter Beitr√§ge zur Naturkunde. Serie B (Geologie und Pal√§ontologie). The two fossils were first described in the paper along with a number of fossils and were placed into the new species Cephalotes caribicus. De Andrade and Baroni Urbani coined the specific epithet caribicus as a reference to region where the species was found. Phylogeny In the study of Cephalotes by De Andrade and Baroni Urbani, C. caribicus was grouped into the pinelii clade, which is composed of C. caribicus and eight extant species. The clade shares two distinct morphological features between the species and two coloration patterns. The mesosoma of pinelii clade species is modified with expansions of membrane, not seen in related clades. Additionally the antennae have a terminal club formed from the last two antennae segments rather than the last three segments. In the living species the gaster of the workers have a pair of spots or stripes and four spots are present on the gasters of gynes. Due to a fine layer of gas over the surface of each of the C. caribicus worker fossils in amber, the coloration was not distinguishable by De Andrade and Baroni Urbani, but color patterns were. C. caribicus was consistently placed as a sister species Cephalotes incertus, both of which were nested deep in the clade. Description The two workers known have body lengths between , and heads that range between . Due to a thin film of gas over workers in both fossils, the coloration they may have had in life was not easily identifiable. The color patterning is visible and lighter colored spots on the head plus four lighter colored spots on the mesosoma are present, but the original coloration of the ants was not identifiable. The head is generally rectangular in outline, with broadly curved rear corners and having membranous extensions. The antennae have distinct apical clubs formed from the last two antenna segments. The first section of the mesosoma has large membrane extensions on the sides. The semitransparent expansions across the body are interpreted by De Andrade and Baroni Urbani as mechanisms to protect the body and appendages such as the antennae and legs from attack by other ants or arthropods. C. caribicus shares the feature of expanded membranous rear head corners with the modern species Cephalotes scutulatus of Central America.

The frontal ridges on the face, rear corners of the head along with the borders of the pronotal and gastral wings are a lighter coloration than the rest of the workers bodies. The exoskeleton is covered with varying sized reticulation, and hairs of several types are present. There are two long thin hairs present on the second tergite of the gaster, while the rear borders of the hind gasteral tergites have rare club-tipped hairs. The head is shorter than wide, with truncated rear corners and a concave rear edge. The face has two raised ridges that have crenulated margins, and the rear corners are also crenulated. The pronotum with a narrow, long, continuous suture, while the mesonotum and the petiole are both unarmed, lacking the larger spines seen on other species.

These ten episodes, along with three unaired episodes, were edited into a four-hour mini-series titled Elvis: The Early Years. The series starred Michael St. Gerard as Presley, Jesse Dabson, Blake Gibbons, Millie Perkins, and Billy \\"Green\\" Bush. Elvis voice-impersonator Ronnie McDowell provided the singing voice for St. Gerard on the series. Plot Elvis: Good Rockin' Tonight was a series offering a dramatic re-creation of Elvis' time just before becoming a major star, focusing on Elvis in 1954 and 1955 as he was beginning his recording career at Sun Records. Production Michael St. Gerard had played Presley twice before, in the 1989 films Great Balls of Fire! and Heart of Dixie; and once again after this series, in a 1993 episode of Quantum Leap. Millie Perkins starred as the real Elvis's love interest in the 1961 film, Wild in the Country. Here she plays his mother. Matt Dillon and Scott Valentine were the first two choices for the role of Elvis. Michael St. Gerard's audition was a line read, and him lip syncing to \\"Baby, Let's Play House\\". He was flown to Memphis the next day to start filming. The brown-eyed St. Gerard refused to wear blue contacts for the role.

Romulus Augustus was a 16-year-old minor at the time.  Background   Rome is sacked twice  Ancient Rome had twice been sacked in the 5th century AD, after a lengthy decline which followed more than a millennium of dominance, first over central Italy and then over an empire that surrounded the Mediterranean Sea.Robinson, Cyril E. A History of Rome from 753 B.C. to A.D. 410. Methuen, 1963.Gibbon, Edward. The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. Ed. Hans-Friedrich Mueller. Modern Library, 2003. First, in 410, a Visigothic army under the command of Alaric besieged, entered, and looted the city, and in 455, the Vandals attacked Rome after their king, Genseric, believing himself to have been snubbed by an usurper emperor, voided a peace treaty. Still the seat of the Roman Senate, and a gem of the Western Empire, Rome was not what it had once been ‚Äì the emperors had moved their courts to the more secure Ravenna in the wake of the two pillages and the Hun incursions. The Vandals were allowed to enter the city after promising the Pope to spare its citizens, but they carried off many of the unfortunate Romans, some of whom were sold into slaveryGibbon, Edward. The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Vol. 3, Pg 623. Ed. Hans-Friedrich Mueller. Modern Library, 2003 in their captors' North African realm. The widow of the emperors Valentinian III and Petronius Maximus, Licinia, was herself taken to Carthage, where her daughter was married to Genseric's son. Rome not only lost a portion of its population during the Vandal rampage, but a fairly large amount of its treasures was plundered by the barbarians. This loot was later recovered by the Byzantines.Brownworth, Lars. Lost to the West. 2010, Crown Publishing Group. At the time, however, its loss was a major blow to the Western Empire.  Ricimer and other generals dominate  After Rome's weaknesses were exposed by the Vandals' invasion, the barbarian tribes of Gaul, once a secure province loyal to the Empire, began to rebel against their former overlords.Gibbon, Edward. The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Vol. 3, Pg 624. Ed. Hans- Friedrich Mueller. Modern Library, 2003 The Ravenna-based emperors now began to lose the respect of many of their subjects, and powerful generals, often of barbarian origin themselves, were forced to defend them. Among the more successful of these commanders, the most senior of whom were called magistri militum, were Avitus, who would eventually be crowned emperor, and Ricimer (who was part-Sueve and half-Visigoth). Ricimer grew so powerful that he was able to choose and depose weak emperors almost at will.Gibbon, Edward. The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Vol. 3. Ed. Hans-Friedrich Mueller. Modern Library, 2003 In 475, the Western emperor, Julius Nepos (nephew of the Eastern empress), was overthrown by his magister militum, the aristocratic Flavius Orestes, who had once been a trusted official of Attila, the Hun ruler.Gibbon, Edward. The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Vol. 3, Pg 636. Ed. Hans-Friedrich Mueller. Modern Library, 2003 Rather than take the throne himself, Orestes had his young son, Romulus Augustus, crowned emperor.  Odoacer's coup and accession  Western (blue) and Eastern (red) Roman Empires by 476 Orestes, who ruled in his son's name, found an enemy in the persons of his non-Roman mercenary soldiers. When, led by an auxiliary general called Odoacer, they demanded estates and were refused,Gibbon, Edward. The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. Ed. Hans-Friedrich Mueller. Modern Library, 2003 they swept into Italy. Informing his soldiers that, if they followed and obeyed him, they would, in the words of Gibbon, \\"extort the justice that had been denied to their dutiful petitions\\", the Germanic, Arian Odoacer confirmed his leadership of the revolt. Barbarian soldiers in Italian cities and garrisons \\"flocked\\" to the audacious general's standard, and Orestes fled to fortified Pavia. Odoacer laid siege to Pavia, which fell in due course. The bishop of that city, Epiphanius, managed to ransom many of the captives taken during this invasion,Gibbon, Edward. The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Vol. 3, Pg 638. Ed. Hans-Friedrich Mueller. Modern Library, 2003 but was unable to save Orestes, who was executed. Orestes' brother was killed near Ravenna by Odoacer's forces, who entered the imperial capital soon afterward. The young monarch Romulus Augustus was, on September 4, compelled to abdicate before the Senate. That body requested that the Eastern Roman Emperor, Zeno, reunite his realm with the West, with Odoacer as his governor. The auxiliary commander, now master of Ravenna, encouraged the senators in this effort.Hill, David Jayne. A History of Diplomacy in the International Development of Europe, Vol. 1, Pg. 32. Longmans, Green, and Co, 1905.Bryce, Viscount James. The Holy Roman empire, Pg 27. The emperor was somewhat hesitant to give Odoacer what would be relative autonomy, citing that his wife's nephew Julius Nepos, still alive and recognized as caesar in Dalmatia, should be restored to the throne. Zeno, however, did not want to use force to support his relation, so, while still urging Odoacer to recognize Nepos' claim, granted the general the rank of patricianBury, J.B. History of the Later Roman Empire from the Death of Theodosius I, Vol. 1, Pg. 407. Dover Publications, 1958. and accepted the general's gift of the Western imperial standards. The hapless ex-emperor, Romulus Augustus, was still present in Ravenna, and Odoacer rid himself of the boy by exiling him. The fate of this final Western Roman emperor is somewhat uncertain, but it is believed that he retired to the Lucullan Villa in CampaniaGibbon, Edward.

History of the Later Roman Empire from the Death of Theodosius I, Vol. 1, Pg. 410. Dover Publications, 1958 Odoacer now proclaimed himself king of the Herules in Italy (476-493), but not king of Italy, as Italy formally remained a land of the Roman Empire after absorbing Augustus's powers, and formed alliances with other barbarians, a prime example being the Visigoths. He proved himself to be a capable ruler, and, although Italy was beset by disasters such as plagues and famines during the turbulent end of the 5th century, historians such as Edward Gibbon have attested to Odoacer's \\"prudence and humanity\\".Gibbon, Edward. The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Vol 3, Pg 641. Ed. Hans- Friedrich Mueller. Modern Library, 2003 Aftermath Despite possessing these qualities, Odoacer was unable to defeat the Ostrogoths and their monarch, Theodoric the Great, who invaded the Kingdom of Italy and overcame the forces that defended it. After four years of fighting, Odoacer, with some pressure from his citizens and his soldiers, decided in 493 that it would be useless to continue fighting and surrendered. The conqueror of the Western Roman Empire was himself conquered, and, unlike Romulus Augustus, he was not spared. While enjoying a banquet, he was murdered by an Ostrogoth, who may have been Theodoric himself.Gibbon, Edward. The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Vol. 4, Pg 692. Ed. Hans-Friedrich Mueller. Modern Library, 2003 When the Ostrogothic queen Amalasuntha, a Byzantine ally, was executed by her chosen successor Theodahad in 535, the Eastern Emperor, Justinian, did not hesitate to declare war. Under the command of the general Belisarius, an army landed in Sicily and subdued that island before invading Italy proper.Young, George Frederick. East and West Through Fifteen Centuries, Vol. 2, Pg. 220. Longmans, Green and Co, 1916 When he did invade the peninsula, he took the city of Naples, then attacked and captured Rome.

The suspicions of the Eastern empress, Theodora, often led her husband Justinian to withhold reinforcements from Belisarius, who was recalled several times. Some historiansBrownworth, Lars. Lost to the West. 2010. have concluded that the war's successful conclusion was the victory of Belisarius, but the honor of defeating the Ostrogoths went to Narses, who was trusted far more by his superiors in Constantinople. Eventually, after the Roman reconquest, another barbarian tribe, the Lombards, invaded and settled in Italy.

At the time of description C. hispaniolicus was one of six ant species placed in the Cephalotes multispinosus clade. History and classification C. hispaniolicus was described from a solitary fossil worker caste ant which was preserved as an inclusion in a transparent chunk of Dominican amber. The amber was produced by the extinct tree Hymenaea protera, which formerly grew on Hispaniola, across northern South America and up to southern Mexico. The specimen was collected from an unidentified amber mine in the Dominican Republic. The amber dates from the Burdigalian age of the Miocene, being recovered from sections of the La Toca Formation in the Cordillera Septentrional and the Yanigua Formation in the Cordillera Oriental. At the time of description, the holotype specimen was preserved in the collections of the State Museum of Natural History Stuttgart in Germany. Living and fossil Cephalotes, Eucryptocerus, Exocryptocerus and Zacryptocerus ants were examined in 1999 by Maria L. De Andrade and Cesare Baroni Urbani with a redescription of included species being published in the journal Stuttgarter Beitr√§ge zur Naturkunde. Serie B (Geologie und Pal√§ontologie). The fossil was first described in the paper along with a number of fossils and was placed into the new species Cephalotes hispaniolicus. De Andrade and Baroni Urbani coined the specific epithet hispaniolicus as a neologism referring to the island of origin for the amber and species, Hispaniola. Phylogeny C. hispaniolicus head In the study of Cephalotes by de Andrade and Baroni Urbani, C. hispaniolicus was grouped into the multispinosus clade which is composed of three extinct species and three extant species. The clade shares only one distinct feature between the species; unlike other clades, multispinosus species have reduced lamellar expansions on the sides of the propodeum. C. hispaniolicus is distinguished from the first outgroup member of the clade Cephalotes poinari based on the shape of the propodial lamellar projections, but is closer in relation to it than to the other Dominican amber species in the clade, Cephalotes squamosus. C. hispaniolicus has the second highest cephalic index in the clade; only C. poinari has a greater one. Description The lone worker of C. hispaniolicus has a body length of , a head length of and a cephalic index that is 142.8. The overall body color is black, with four lighter colored spots, two on the head and two on the mesosoma. The lamellae along the gaster, propodeum, and pronotum along with the ridges along the front of the face are all dark brown and semitransparent. The head has minute punctate, with clumped pits that grow smaller towards the front of the head. The mesosoma, propodium, legs and gaster have a reticulated sculpturing to the exoskeleton, with pits in the centers of the reticulations. Similarly the peduncular segments are reticulated with pits, though the reticulation is denser than on the propodium. The center of the first gastral sternite is distinctly shiny. Each of the pits has a thin hair growing from it and which lies flat along the exoskeleton, and similar hairs are present on the gaster. Variously sized clubbed hairs are scattered along the rear borders of both the gastral tergites and sternites, while similar, but minutely sized clubbed hairs are rarely found on the rear corners of the head. The propodium has narrow lamellae along the posterior sides that project out and then taper towards the rear. The petiole and post petiole segments each have triangular semi-transparent lamellae on the sides, with the post petiole lamellae bracketed by the lamellae projecting from the front of the gaster.

However, they are capable of consuming other foods, and it has even been suggested that they may occasionally forage on the ground to do so. Colonies range in size between ~50-200/300 individuals, and frequently have multiple reproductive queens. Because brood require several months to mature into adults, queens cannot adjust the ratio of soldiers to workers quickly enough to adapt to changing threats. Therefore, an effective strategy of soldier (major) deployment has evolved to maximize survival.Creighton, W. S., & Nutting, W. L. (1965).

Dufart, Paris. 467 pp. PDF The species is native of Texas and of the Mexican states of Nuevo Leon, San Luis Potos√≠ and Tamaulipas. Their larger and flatter legs, a trait common with other members of the genus Cephalotes, gives them their gliding abilities. The species was first given a description and a classification in 1919 by Swiss entomologist Felix Santschi.  Morphology  As some other members of its genus, Cephalotes texanus possesses an odd shaped head, which is the result of it adapting to nest in the nests of longhorn beetle larvaes, as their nests are already dug out by them, the species does not build nests. The odd shaped head of the species allows its soldier to deny access to the nest by blocking it with their head, further blocking themselves with a dorsal ridge on the dorsal part of their thorax. They have further evolved towards this purpose with their fragile antenaes being placed on the side of their heads, protected by the shield. This form of morphological adaptation is called phragmosis.

At the BBC, he became Head of Variety and later Head of Television Comedy. Background and early career Nash was born in Norwich and grew up in Cromer on the north Norfolk coast, where he was educated at Paston School. His initial theatrical training was as a young member of Miss Alexander's dance group at the Lecture Hall in the town. Often the only boy in the group, he was therefore sure of a place in their productions at the local venues. A fellow dancer was his sister Anne (Lewin), a ballerina and West End dancer who would later become a Wing Commander in the Royal Air Force.Fellow members of the class His secondary education was at The Paston School, North Walsham (whose most distinguished former pupil was Horatio Nelson). As a teenager during the Second World War he entertained allied troops and met David Croft who later co-wrote Dad's Army for the BBC. After a series of acting and other theatrical jobs in London's West End, Nash joined the BBC as a studio manager in 1955.Obituary: Robin Nash, The Times, 9 July 2011 In 1961 he directed location filming for Ted Willis's thriller Flowers of Evil and, in 1962-3, worked on two of Willis's other creations, the long-running police drama Dixon of Dock Green and the comedy-drama series Taxi! starring Sid James. Succeeding situation comedies included Marriage Lines (as producer from 1965), which, since 1961, had brought Richard Briers and Prunella Scales to a wide audience, and the Comedy Playhouse pilot (1967) for a series of The Old Campaigner with Terry-Thomas, Jonathan Cecil and Elaine Taylor among others.Despite his coup in securing the services of Terry-Thomas for Comedy Playhouse, Nash did not produce the series itself. Times, 9 July 2011 Nash also worked during this period with Alan Melville on Before the Fringe (re-enacting sketches from past theatrical revues, 1967), Beryl Reid (Beryl Reid Says Good Evening, 1968) and Dora Bryan (According to Dora, 1968).The Times, 9 July 2011 1970s and 1980s From 1973 to July 1980 Nash was producer (later executive producer) of Top of the Pops, the weekly chart-based popular music show created in 1964 by Johnnie Stewart, whom Nash succeeded. During this period TOTP regularly attracted audiences of 15 million.Dominic Sandbrook (2010) State of Emergency Nash briefly returned to the executive producer role in January 1981, whilst current executive producer Michael Hurll was on holiday leave. Concurrently, Nash produced for children's television The Basil Brush Show (featuring Derek Fowlds and a garrulous puppet fox, 1972-5) and the variety show Crackerjack (1975-7), and worked with Bruce Forsyth and then Larry Grayson on The Generation Game (from 1976). In 1978 he became Head of Variety at the BBC.The Times, 9 July 2011 In the 1980s Nash produced such comedy shows as Terry and June (with Terry Scott and June Whitfield, 1985) and Carla Lane's I Woke Up One Morning (1985-6) and Bread (1986‚Äì91). He was appointed Head of Television Comedy in 1989, moving three years later into work for production companies, including Alomo's sitcom Goodnight Sweetheart for the BBC (1993-9) and Harry Hill's series for Channel 4 (1998‚Äì2000).The Times, 9 July 2011 Demeanour and approach With his background in the BBC's \\"old school\\", Nash was a dapper and quite flamboyant figure, recognisable by his jaunty bow-ties and moustache. Tony Blackburn, one of many TOTP presenters, recalled that he \\"seemed perfectly in tune with the [1970s] era, forever camping it up with his booming, over-the-top voice.\\" A fellow BBC executive, Will Wyatt, described him as \\"a big, warm, cuddly bear of a man with an easy charm at work and a huge collection of Clarice Cliff pottery at home\\". Nash regretted that the use of recording and editing techniques detracted from the sense of \\"performance\\" that could be achieved from live television, and once said that he would \\"love Top of the Pops to be live\\"The Times, 9 July 2011 (rather as its forerunner, and then competitor, Ready Steady Go!, had been).

It is found on the lower shore and in the neritic zone in the warm temperate parts of the eastern Atlantic Ocean. Description Balanus perforatus B. perforatus is a large barnacle which grows up to in both diameter and height. Its shape resembles a volcano with steep sloping sides. The six fused lateral calcareous plates are pale purplish-brown and often ridged vertically. They often separate near the top leaving jagged ridges. Tissue inside the operculum is brightly coloured. Two pairs of moveable plates cover the operculum which can be sealed by a purplish-brown flap when the barnacle is exposed above water or it is not feeding.European Marine Life. Retrieved July 19, 2011.Marine Life Information Network. Retrieved July 19, 2011. Distribution B. perforatus is found on coastlines along the eastern side of the Atlantic Ocean including the Mediterranean Sea and the English Channel. Its most northerly extent is in southern areas of England and Wales, and at this limit of its range it can be greatly affected by severe winters. It has been expanding its range with the rises in temperature that have been occurring in recent decades. It is found on rocks and man-made structures from mid-shore to the neritic zone and also forms part of the fouling community on the hulls of ships. Biology When submerged, B. perforatus extends its cirri and beats then rhythmically at a rate of between two and twenty-four beats per ten seconds. The cirri are less extended when the beat rate is faster. It feeds on plankton and as well as catching food particles, it pumps water through its mantle cavity. The faster the beating, the more water is pumped and the volume may reach one litre per hour. Slow beat rates are linked to pauses while the cirri are retracted rather than a reduction in the speed of movement of the cirri. B. perforatus is well adapted to life as an efficient current-producing suspension feeder. Breeding takes place between May and September in the English Channel when the quantity of planktonic food for the larvae is at its greatest. Initially the larvae are brooded by the adult and after their first moult are released into the water column. There are five further nauplius stages during which the larvae feed, grow, moult, drift with the currents and form part of the zooplankton. The last stage cyprid larvae then settle out and attach themselves to a suitable substrate. Ecology In the habitats occupied by B. perforatus it is often associated with sponges and encrusting red seaweeds on shady overhanging rocks and cave entrances and also bryozoans and ascidians in deeper shade.European Environment Agency: Habitat types for Balanus perforatus The isopod crustacean Crinoniscus equitans is an ectoparasite of B. perforatus. Another isopod crustacean, Naesa bidentata, normally lives in rock crevices and under seaweed and stones but with the spread of B. perforatus, it has adopted the empty shells of the barnacle as its home.

It is made with a specialized foam, related to the material used to make Crocs shoes, that allows the ball to re-inflate after being punctured. The One World Play Project, which manufactures and distributes the One World Futbol, was founded in California in 2010 to manufacture, sell, and donate the balls. According to an interview with Katie Couric; The company has produced about 850,000 balls. About half of them were bought for $40 each; for each ball purchased, another is given away. The ball has been spread by numerous organizations and made its way to over 140 countries.  History  The One World Futbol was conceived by Tim Jahnigen of Berkeley, California after he watched a documentary that featured children in Darfur playing with soccer balls made of trash. These makeshift balls were used because traditional soccer balls rapidly became too damaged to be usable in the rocky ground that the children played in. Jahnigen, who had previously met the developers of Crocs shoes and had used durable early Crocs prototypes, came up with the idea of using ethylene-vinyl acetate foam, a similar material, to create the ball. The ball self re-inflates, eliminating the need for air pumps, can still be used after being punctured, and can withstand heat and cold. Jahnigen did not immediately pursue the idea, as he did not have the funding to do so. He brought up the idea while speaking with the musician Sting, who gave Jahnigen research and development funding for the ball. As a result of the support, the ball itself was named after The Police song \\"One World\\". The One World Play Project, responsible for manufacturing, selling, and donating the balls, was founded as a certified Benefit corporation in July 2010 before the final game of the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. The balls were initially priced at $39.50, under an arrangement in which the purchase pays for one ball for the purchaser and a second ball to be donated. In May 2012 Chevrolet announced a sponsorship agreement in which the company would purchase and donate one and a half million One World Futbols. Tim Jahnigen stated that he intends to eventually manufacture a version of every inflated sports ball using the damage resistant foam.

Luciano Fonda in 1961  Biography  Born in Pula (then part of Italy, now Croatia), the events of the war brought his family to Trieste in December 1943. He completed his high school and college studies at the local Dante Alighieri school, before graduating in Physics summa cum laude at the University of Trieste in July 1955. After becoming a Theoretical Physics assistant at the University of Trieste, he travelled to the United States of America with a Fulbright Program grant in 1958 to take the position of Research Associate at the Indiana University Bloomington. In 1959 Robert Oppenheimer invited him to become a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. In November 1960 he won an Italian public competition to become a full professor of Theoretical Physics and returned to Italy in 1961, first to work at the University of Palermo and then at the University of Parma. In November 1963 he moved to the University of Trieste definitively. Luciano Fonda married Thea Arcangeli and had three children, Alessandro, Paola and Gabriella. He died in Skradin (Croatia) on 21 July 1998, during a sailing cruise.  Academic charges  Luciano Fonda has been the Director of the Advanced School of Physics, which was open to scholarship holders from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) of Vienna and UNESCO. The School was under his management from 1964 to 1980, when he oversaw the merging of its contents and programmes into the recently born International School for Advanced Studies (Scuola Internazionale Superiore di Studi Avanzati ‚Äì SISSA).SISSA As vice director, Luciano Fonda contributed both found and run SISSA for six years.

When the machine was assigned to Grenoble in 1985, he used the experience acquired in those years to develop, along with his collaborator Renzo Rosei, the idea of an Italian machine that would complement the European one. The construction of ELETTRA was completed in October 1993 and it is now operative in Basovizza, on the Triestine Carso. Luciano Fonda was director of the Scientific Division of Synchrotron Trieste from 1987 to 1991 and vice president from 1993.  Awards  For his research activity, he won the Italian Physical Society award in 1960. He was also conferred the title of Associate Member of the Jozef Stefan Institute for his collaboration with the theoretical physics group from the University of Ljubljana.

Early life and education He was the grandson of Jewish immigrants who immigrated to Canada from the Ukraine and Poland in the 1880s. His father owned a dressmaking business and raised Sydney and his sister in their Yorkville Avenue home in Toronto. Harris won a scholarship as a student of Jarvis Collegiate Institute and attended the University of Toronto before enrolling in Osgoode Hall Law School in 1939. Early career During World War II, Harris tried to enlist but was rejected due to poor eyesight. Instead, he went to Ottawa and became a lawyer for the government. Following the war, he returned to Toronto to practice for private law firms before opening his own practice in 1950. As a lawyer and activist he lobbied for the adoption of the Ontario Human Rights Code in 1962, as well as amendments to the Criminal Code in the 1960s against hate speech. He also lobbied against capital punishment and public funding for religious schools saying \\"I see no justification for the use of my tax money to teach Protestantism to Protestant children than I would see for the use of Anglican or Roman Catholic tax money to teach Judaism to Jewish children.\\" Harris was a supporter of and fundraiser for the US civil rights movement and met with Martin Luther King, Jr. three times in 1963. Ontario Provincial Court career As a judge, Harris was nicknamed Syd Vicious for his heavy sentences. \\"If there was a reasonable doubt in a case, Syd would find it. But if he found you guilty, the penalties tended to be higher than most judges,\\" said Toronto lawyer Clayton Ruby. \\"It's the way he looked at the world. He wanted to make sure he didn't convict anyone who was innocent but, at the same time, he didn't like criminals. He liked justice but not criminals.\\" Notable rulings include his landmark 1979 acquittal of the gay magazine Body Politic and its publishers, Pink Triangle Press of obscenity, his 1988 decision to imprison NHL player Dino Ciccarelli for his on-ice attack of Toronto Maple Leaf Luke Richardson and his 1983 decision to acquit furrier Paul Magder for violating the law against Sunday shopping by opening his store. Later years He retired from the criminal court in 1992, but later became a Small Claims Court judge and also served in his later years as a member of the Ontario Assessment Review Board, referee for the Law Society of Upper Canada and an appointee of the Council for the Association of Ontario Land Surveyors.Wilkes, Jim. \\"Sydney Harris, 91: Judge was defender of rights\\", Toronto Star, June 19, 2009 Personal life He was a prominent opponent of the neo-Nazi movement in the 1960s.

The engine was constructed as a single crankcase with four banks of six cylinders in what is close to an X-configuration. The engine was an upright 60 degree vee-12 and an inverted 60 degree vee-12 sharing a common crankcase. Although technically incorrect, the engine has been characterized as two Packard 1A-1500 V-12 engines coupled with a mutual crankcase. Design and development In 1926, about 20 New York businessmen, including James Packard, and a group of US Navy officers expressed an interest in building an airplane designed to break the standing air speed record. Navy officials agreed to finance the project, when funds became available. The aircraft was to be completed in time to participate in the 1927 Schneider Trophy Race, which would be held in Italy. 1A-2775 engine The engine was designed by Captain Lionel Nelson, USN, an aeronautical engineer at Packard. It was an \\"X\\" configuration, similar to one upright and one inverted V-12 engine mounted on the same crankshaft with a common crankcase. With bore and stroke, the resulting displacement was . The engineering involved in the design of the crankshaft, single piece crankcase, and connecting rod system was very complex. Master/slave connecting rod arrangement The connecting rods were a master-slave design similar to that used on a radial engine. This resulted in the stroke becoming slightly longer in three of four banks, and resulted in slightly more displacement than the nominal of an engine of that bore and stroke. The engine produced at 2,700 rpm and weighed . The crank cheeks were used as main bearing journals, and were in diameter. This was necessary to keep the crankshaft length the same as the 1A-1500 engine so its components could be used, and to keep the weight as low as possible. The single piece crankcase was designed to save weight and give maximum strength, but made assembly of the engine difficult. The engine was finished by August 1927. The Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics ordered a second supercharged engine under their original contract No. 3224. It was equipped with a special Roots-type supercharger. It was ordered with a supercharger when it was discovered that it would be necessary to supercharge the engine in order to equal the reported speeds of the other contestants. The Bureau of Aeronautics analyzed the possibilities of the plane becoming a competitive race plane, and decided that the extra weight of the supercharger could be better put to use by installing an epicyclic reduction gear, for improved propeller efficiency, thereby providing greater improvement in performance than what the supercharged engine with a direct drive propeller could provide for the same weight. It was further planned to increase the compression ratio of the engine, improving its performance with no increase in weight, but needed to secure dynamometer data on the supercharged engine to make a final decision. The dynomometer tests indicated the power output was only @ 2,800 rpm due to the large impeller clearance that allowed only Hg (3.8 psi) boost. After reducing the impeller clearances, the supercharger then produced Hg (4.7 psi) of boost and the engine delivered at 2,700 rpm. Engine nose cone and reduction gearing The first engine later received an epicyclic propeller reduction gear made by Allison, an increase in its compression ratio, a Scintilla magneto ignition, and the new design cylinder banks of the 3A-1500 inverted engines, a design that had both spark plugs on the outside for easier maintenance. Official Packard photographs of this engine are marked \\"model 2A-2775\\", and photographs of the earlier versions are marked \\"not to be released to the press ‚Äî hereafter only 2A-2775 are to be released ‚Äî per Capt. Woolson.\\" Most of the published photographs are of this engine. In spite of Captain Woolson's note, it was identified as either a 1A-2775 or the \\"Packard X engine.\\" The engine was advertised as being available \\"built-to-order\\" as late as September 1930 at $35,000 each. No orders were received, and because only two engines were built, both for the Navy as X-2775s, the Packard model designation of 2A-2775 never came into public use. Engine No. 2 also received the new style cylinder banks and was tested both with and without the reduction gear. The direct drive and reduction gear units were interchangeable, and were switched between the two engines as needed. Engine No. 1 in its most modified version, with high compression, reduction gear and late type cylinder banks, was used in the Naval Aircraft Factory Mercury racing plane with engine 1A-2775, Serial No. 1, Bureau No.10960, as a U.S. entry in the 1929 Schneider Trophy. Engine No. 1 is the only known 1A-2775 survivor and it was given by the Navy to the Smithsonian in 1971. It is in the same configuration as it was when used in the Mercury racer. 2A-2775 engine Packard apparently built a third engine some time after 1931 when the Navy had stopped testing its engines. No photographs of this engine have been found, but engineering data dated in early 1939 show a 2A-2775 with an output of @ 2,800 rpm. BMEP was listed as indicating the engine was supercharged.

It is located about 190 km north of the Chennai Port and 18 km east of the city of Nellore. The port is owned and operated by the Krishnapatnam Port Company Limited (KPCL) which is 92% owned by Hyderabad- based CVR Group. The London-based equity firm 3i Group Plc owns the remaining 8% equity in KPCL. KPCL breakwater with KOLOS armour units  Etymology  The port has its history back to Vijayanagar Emperor, when Sri Krishnadevaraya used to operate it. So, the name was given to it as Krishnapatnam Port. It is also known as KPCL.It is also called Krishnapatnam port  Establishment and promoters  Krishnapatnam Port (KPCL) Krishnapatnam Port (KPCL) is India's largest private sector port. It was inaugurated on 17 July 2008 by the UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi. The port was built by the Navayuga Engineering Company Limited, the flagship concern of the CVR Group, under a build-operate- share-transfer (BOST) agreement with the Government of Andhra Pradesh. The port covers an area of 4,553 acres. The BOST agreement, valid for 30 years and further extendable to 50 years, requires the promoters to pay 2.6% of the port's gross revenue to the Government of Andhra Pradesh for the first 30 years. From the 30th year, that share increases to 5.4% and from the 40th year to 10.8%. The agreement also requires them to develop the port in three phases with the first phase being completed by January 2008, the second phase by 2012 and the final by 2017.  Connectivity and hinterland  As of 2015, KPCL is capable of handling 75 million tonnes (mt) of cargo per annum and is the deepest port of India with a draft of 18.5 metres. The hinterland of the port includes southern and central Andhra Pradesh, eastern Karnataka, northern Tamil Nadu and Eastern Maharashtra. The port is linked to the Chennai‚ÄìKolkata rail line through a 19 km long line and is also connected with the National Highway 16 (India) which is being upgraded from a four-lane to a six-lane highway.  Phases of development  The first phase of development of the port involved an expenditure of 1400 crores and was completed in 2009. In this phase the Port developed an annual cargo handling capacity of 25 million tonnes. Two mechanized Iron Ore Berths, a mechanized Coal Berth and a mechanized General Cargo Berth were set up in this phase. The second phase of the Port's development entails an investment of $2 billion and the enhancement of cargo handling capacity by 40 million tonnes. By 2017, when the Port is fully developed, it is expected to handle 200 million tonnes of cargo annually. The second phase of expansion will increase the total berths to twelve of which half will handle coal with the rest handling general, bulk and container cargo. The draft of the port is also to be enhanced from the present 18 metres to 21 metres.  Container terminal  Krishnapatnam port Nellore - KPCL In September 2012, the KPCL inaugurated its container terminal capable of handling 1.2 million standard containers a year. This terminal is equipped with 5 Panamax gantry cranes, two berths of 650m and a channel depth of 13.5m allowing large vessels carrying up to 8,000 containers to dock. The second phase of its development will involve the investment of 11,000 crores and the expansion of capacity by another 4.8 million tonnes. KPCL has entered into an agreement with Container Corporation of India (CONCOR) to develop a container freight station at the port and inland container depots in the hinterland to facilitate trade through the port. Krishnapatnam port terminal set to emerge as a major trans-shipment hub on the East Coast following dynamic initiatives being taken up by some international shipping container liners.  Cargo handled  When the port was inaugurated in 2008, iron ore constituted its most important cargo which peaked at 10.5 million tonnes in 2009-'10. Since the ban on export of iron ore from the Bellary-Hospet region of Karnataka, its shipments have dwindled forcing the port to diversify its portfolio. Coal is now the primary commodity handled by the port, its volume having expanded from less than 100,000 tonnes in 2008-09 to 11.3 million tonnes in 2011-12. The port now also plans to handle liquefied natural gas cargo, cars meant for exports, edible oils and fertilizers. During 2012-13, the port handled 21.2 million tonnes of cargo, of which three-fourths comprised imported coal. The Port handled 25.16 MT during the year 2013-14 against the target of 28 MT. The port registers very impressive growth of 60% for the year 2014-15 and ended up handling total cargo of 40.72 million tonnes up from 25.16 MT in the previous year.  Special economic zone  A 12,000 acre Special Economic Zone (SEZ) is being set up in the vicinity of the port by the Krishnapatnam Infratech Private Limited, a special purpose vehicle set up by KPCL. The SEZ entails an investment of 6,000 crores and is expected to create 30,000 direct employments. The SEZ is being designed by Mahindra Engineering and is to be a multi-product SEZ.

Valmy founded the first esthetician school in the United States in 1966, and is widely credited as one of the most influential figures in modern aesthetics. Early life Christine Valmy was born Cristina Xantopol in Bucharest, Romania in 1926. She graduated from the law school of the University of Bucharest in 1946. During this period, she took a course in dermatology and skin care, which later formed the foundation of her career as an esthetician. In 1948, she opened her first salon in Bucharest, offering skin treatments based on traditional botanical remedies. To avoid the Communist pressures imposed by the Soviet Union, along with her mother and young daughter Marina, she emigrated to Greece in 1959. After working as the representative of a cosmetics company for Greece and Israel, Valmy and her family emigrated in the United States in 1960 penniless and unable to speak the language. Career in the United States In New York City, Cristina Xantopol changed her name to Christine Valmy, inspired by the victory of the French over the Austrians during the French Revolution. After working in various places as an esthetician, she opened her own salon, but found teaching more rewarding. She persevered with her own techniques, now collectively known as the \\"Valmy method\\", with a philosophy to \\"reveal not to conceal\\" the natural beauty of a healthy, well-functioning skin. In June 1966, Christine Valmy opened her first skin care school in New York. Her next step was to create an American association of skin care specialists (estheticians), an association which gained the respect of the international governing body of skin care professionals, CIDESCO. \\"[T]hrough her years\\", said the National Cosmetologists Association, \\"she has brought respectability and professionalism not only to the skin care and esthetics specialties but to cosmetology at large.\\" In 1975, after graduating with a master's degree from Boston University, her daughter Marina Valmy combined her knowledge of Chinese and Ayurvedic herbs, medicinal plants, oriental treatments and chemistry to create a laboratory where she could create all-natural products. The company‚Äôs laboratory is in Pine Brook, New Jersey, where it develops, manufactures and warehouses its products. In 1985, Christine Valmy was appointed by President Ronald Reagan to serve on the United States National Council on Vocational Education, in recognition of her contribution in the education field, and to assist in developing the country‚Äôs policies on vocational education, in which capacity she served until 1991. \\"She is the originator of the skincare industry in this country, a fact that led the 92nd Congress of the United States to award her a citation fostering skin care as a profession in America\\". In 1992, Marina Valmy became Director of the Christine Valmy International School in New York. The school is currently located at 1501 Broadway, in the heart of Times Square. She was also the Executive Vice President of Christine Valmy Inc. Christine Valmy died in Bucharest on January 18, 2015. Books published, Awards and Civic activities Christine Valmy is the author of three books on skin care and esthetics: * Esthetics: The Keystone Guide to Skin Care * Christine Valmys Skin Care and Make Up Book * Christine Valmy Method of Scientific Facials In April 1968, Christine Valmy was awarded a special merit honor by the French Congress of Aesthetics at Versailles, France for promoting the esthetics profession in the United States. She also won the outstanding Republican Ethnic Woman of the Year award in 1981. In 1976, President Gerald Ford nominated Christine Valmy as the Business Person of the Year for the State of New Jersey, where her second school and laboratories are located. Valmy was a member of many boards of different groups. She was also a trustee of Famous People and People International, an organization founded by President Eisenhower to promote friendship and understanding in the world.

The name of the unincorporated community Shelter Valley is typically used both locally and by the media to refer generally to the geological feature of Earthquake Valley, and it is common for both names to be referenced in publications after the 1962 establishment of the subdivision. Author, poet, artist and primitivist Marshal South lived in and wrote about the general area (including Julian, Mason Valley, Vallicito Valley, and his home in Blair Valley), in a series of articles for Desert Magazine between 1941 and 1948. A number of notable trails pass through the valley, including the Pacific Crest Trail, the California Riding and Hiking Trail, and the Southern Emigrant Trail. History Earthquake Valley was the site of a Kumeyaay village near what is now Scissors Crossing and Sentenac Cienega, a little cienega formed at the bottom of the watershed in the valley before it descends Sentenac Canyon. Earthquake Valley, then called the Valle de San Felipe, became the route of the Sonora Road into the coastal region of Southern California. The Sonora Road discovered by Mexican soldiers reestablished land communications between Alta California and Sonora, Mexico in the late 1820s. The valley was later the site of the Rancho Valle de San Felipe. From the time of the Mexican American War and the California Gold Rush the Sonora Road became the route of the Southern Immigrant Trail that passed through the valley from Blair Valley to Teofulio Summit, (formerly Warner Pass). This trail remained the major southern route into California from the eastern United States until the advent of the railroad at Yuma, Arizona in 1877 reduced its importance. From 1858 the important San Felipe Station of the Butterfield Overland Mail was located about a quarter mile north of Scissors Crossing. Stage lines continued to use the route until the railroad came to Yuma.

Aviation activities began there in 1913, . In 1920 the field, then called the Parkwater airstrip, was designated a municipal flying field at the instigation of the Spokane Chamber of Commerce. In 1926, the United States Department of Commerce officially recognized Parkwater as an airport, one of the first in the West. In September 1927, in conjunction with Spokane's National Air Derby and Air Races, the airport was renamed Felts Field for James Buell Felts (1898‚Äì1927), a Washington Air National Guard aviator killed in a crash that May. Parkwater Aviation Field, later Felts Field, was the location for flight instruction, charter service, airplane repair, aerial photography, headquarters of the 116th Observation Squadron of the Washington Air National Guard, and eventually the first airmail and commercial flights in and out of Spokane. After World War II, commercial air traffic moved to Geiger Field (later Spokane International Airport). Felts Field remains a busy regional hub for private and small-plane aviation and related businesses and services. In 1991 it was designated Felts Field Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places Parkwater Airstrip United Airlines Boeing 247 at Spokane Airport (Felts Field) in 1934 The area was a leveled stretched, city-owned property near the area called Parkwater, which temporarily became the name of the airfield as well. Prior to 1913, Spokane's early aviators and exhibition flyers from elsewhere had used a variety of locations, including the fairgrounds east of the city and Glover Athletic Field along the river at the west end of downtown. In 1920, the year the Parkwater airstrip was designated a municipal flying field, the area had not been entirely cleared of stones, and during 1922 and 1923, \\"Spokane County chronic drunk and nonsupport prisoners [were allowed] ‚Äòfield exercise‚Äô by removing stones from the flying field\\". Parkwater Field was the scene of several historic aviation events in Spokane during the 1920s. In 1924, Spokane beat other Washington cities to become the headquarters of the state's Air National Guard/116th Observation Squadron. The Guard designated its portion of Parkwater Field as Camp Earl Hoisington. Spokane aviation boosters staged a successful Air Show in 1925. Felts Field In September 1927 the airfield was renamed to Felts Field. That month there were two major events: on September 12, the landing of Charles Lindbergh during a nationwide tour in his Spirit of St. Louis, and from September 21 to 25, Spokane's Air Derby and National Air Races, one of the first and most successful of such events in the United States. Nick Mamer in front of the airplane on 6, March 1929 \\"Spokane Sun-God\\" Felts Field 1929In August 1929, Felts Field hosted the spectacular cross-country endurance flight by Nicholas Bernard Mamer in his \\"Spokane Sun-God\\". Mamer and his mechanic and copilot, Art Walker, were in the air continuously for 120 hours and covered 7,200 miles, with the plane refueled in flight. Their feat of endurance established several United States records. Commercial aviation activities of the 1920s, many extending into the 1930s, included the Inland-Eaglerock Sales Company, the Bigelow Johnson School of Aviation, Mamer Air Transport and Flying Service, the Spokane Aviation Company, Spokane Airways, and others. Several hangars were built during this period, and local aviators formed enthusiastic flying clubs. The late 1920s saw the beginning of the \\"Tin Goose\\" era, during which the fragile biplanes and monoplanes of plywood and cloth gave way to enclosed metal aircraft capable of carrying more passengers. These big Ford tri-motors flew out of Felts Field until the mid-1930s, though not always successfully. The first of the three Spokane Airways tri-motors crashed on nearby Moran Prairie southeast of Spokane on November 23, 1928, killing four Spokane flyers. Airmail and Passenger Service An important development of the late 1920s was the coming of airmail service to Spokane. By 1926, Pasco, Washington, already had airmail service through Varney Airlines, a forerunner of United, and \\"Spokane was envious\\". The Chamber of Commerce launched a publicity campaign and commissioned a survey of the route. The first direct airmail flight from Spokane took place on September 15, 1929. Prior to the 1930s, various companies at Felts Field had provided passenger service mainly on a charter basis. Modern passenger service from Felts Field began during the early 1930s, first with United Airlines, a consolidation of Varney, Boeing Air Transport, and several other airlines. United's early Spokane service was in a 10-passenger Boeing all-metal twin-engine transport (Boeing 247). Boeing Air Transport B-40 at Felts Field on September 23, 1927 Soon Northwest Airways of St. Paul, Minnesota, added Spokane to its \\"Northern Tier\\" route that Spokane's Nick Mamer had proven feasible in the late 1920s. Both United and Northwest had passenger and administrative operations in the art deco terminal building constructed in 1932 and eventually serving 137 cities. Mamer Air Transport could not compete with United and Northwest, so Nick Mamer sold his planes and hangar and went to work for Northwest as Western Operations Manager and chief pilot on the Twin Cities to Seattle route that he had pioneered. In 1934 Northwest Airways became Northwest Airlines and, with its fleet of Lockheed and, later, Douglas planes, was soon the major carrier out of Spokane. Pioneers of Flight On January 10, 1938, Nick Mamer, his copilot and eight passengers were killed in a crash of a Northwest Lockheed near Bozeman, Montana. On May 30, 1939, the Mamer Memorial Clock was dedicated at Felts Field. In addition to the men, a number of Spokane women learned to fly at Felts Field. The women, excluded from the men's air races and derbies, hosted their own \\"All Women's Air Frolic\\" at Felts Field in 1936. Female aviators from all over the Northwest competed in stunt flying, racing, and exhibition flying. The event was marred by several crashes, but no one was killed. During the 1930s, considerable improvement had been made at Felts Field with Civil Works Administration funds and Works Progress Administration labor. The Shift to Geiger Field Beginning early in World War II, Felts Field was used as a training site for the Civilian Pilot Training Program while continuing to serve as the municipal airport. The skies and runways were becoming crowded, and, by the late 1930s, the Spokane Chamber of Commerce had realized the need for a larger, more modern airport, a \\"super airport,\\" to keep up with Spokane's position as a regional transportation and business center. The chamber convinced the Civil Aeronautics Administration and the two airlines serving Spokane to conduct a survey to determine the location. County commissioners agreed to purchase the recommended land west of the city. Concurrently, city leaders proposed to the federal government that Felts Field be used as an Army Air Corps installation. The War Department turned down this proposal in favor of the 1,280 acres already under development as the new \\"super airport,\\" officially called the Sunset Airport (or Sunset Field). On 28 February 1941, the headquarters staff of the Northwest Air District moved from Felts Field to new headquarters offices at Fort George Wright. From there the air activities of eleven northwest states would be directed. Headquarters for the 5th Bomb Wing would remain at Felts until the completion of Sunset Field. A new north runway was placed in service at Felts Field the last week of June 1942. With the departure in January 1944 of a WAC detachment and photo charting units for Lowry Field, Colorado, Felts Field was completely evacuated of Army personnel. Lt. Col. Stanley M. Persons, commanding officer of Geiger Field, was the commander of the now-inactive satellite base. In 1939, the city agreed to lease the area to the military for one dollar a year, banning civilian use. The Works Progress Administration and the army jointly prepared the runways. In 1941, this airport was named Geiger Field in honor of Major Harold Geiger U.S. Army aviator number six. The Washington Air National Guard moved from Felts Field to Geiger when called to active duty during World War II. After the war, all passenger service was located at Geiger Field, which was renamed Spokane International Airport in 1960. Felts Field Historic and Busy Meanwhile, Felts Field has continued to serve as the airport for private and small planes of all kinds, even seaplanes, because of its location along a smooth stretch of the Spokane River. Felts Field is also a center for the restoration of vintage planes. The airfield continues to provide charter services and flight instruction. A new control tower was added in 1968, and a Skyway Caf√©, attached to the terminal building.

Their native range is from Tibet to southeast China. Description Species of Pteroxygonum are twining vines growing from a large woody globe-shaped tuber. Their leaves are broad and palmate, with a dark red mark around each primary leaf vein. The inflorescence is in the form of an axillary raceme. The flowers are bisexual, with five spirally arranged tepals, eight stamens joined at the base, and three styles, also joined up to about the middle. Nectar is produced from tissue at the base of the staments. Their fruits are in the form of winged, three-angled achenes. Taxonomy The genus Pteroxygonum was erected in 1905 by Carl Dammer and F. Ludwig Diels for the species Pteroxygonum giraldii. They separated Pteroxygonum from Polygonum on the basis of the \\"very notably different structure of the fruit\\". Until 2015, the genus was considered to contain only this species. A 2015 molecular phylogenetic study found that the species formerly called Polygonum denticulatum was closely related to Pteroxygonum giraldii, and accordingly moved it to Pteroxygonum. Pteroxygonum is placed in the subfamily Polygonoideae, tribe Pteroxygoneae.

The British music publication Blues Matters! called Taylor \\"the new face of the blues\\". Biography Taylor was born in Wednesbury, West Midlands, England, and grew up in Solihull, and was inspired in her early teens to play the blues after hearing Stevie Ray Vaughan, Albert Collins and Jimi Hendrix. Dave Stewart heard Taylor play, and in 2002 invited her to join his supergroup, D.U.P., on tour in Europe. In May 2009, Taylor released her debut album, White Sugar, on Ruf Records. Taylor's second release was 2010's Diamonds in the Dirt, also on Ruf Records. Both her albums peaked at number eight in the US Billboard Top Blues Albums chart. In 2010, she won Best Female Vocalist at the British Blues Awards. She won the same award at the 2011 British Blues Awards, plus the Songwriter of the Year award for \\"Same As It Never Was\\" from Diamonds in the Dirt. On 4 June 2012, Taylor played lead guitar in Annie Lennox's band at the Diamond Jubilee Concert in London. Taylor played an extended solo during the performance in front of Buckingham Palace, attended by approximately 12,000 people (not counting the many thousands lining The Mall). Just before her solo spot, Taylor's Fuzz Face pedal malfunctioned, leaving a much cleaner guitar sound than usual. This apparent misfortune was ameliorated, however, when she was informed that Stevie Wonder had loved her \\"clean, bluesy, understated tone\\".The Blues magazine, Issue 4, page 50 Taylor's fourth studio album, The Dirty Truth, was recorded in Memphis, Tennessee with producer Jim Gaines, and was released on 22 September 2014. Wild, Taylor's fifth studio album was released on 30 September 2016. It was recorded in Nashville's Grand Victor Studios with Kevin Shirley working as producer.

It is a joint initiative led by Columbia University, the School of Public Policy and Management at Tsinghua University, and McKinsey & Company. UCI was launched in November 2010.  Mission  To fulfill its mission, the UCI has three specific aims: * Solutions ‚Äì Be the source of the best and most innovative solutions to urban development issues in China. * Talent ‚Äì Be a home for China's leading domestic and international urban thinkers and professionals, and a magnet for the best global thinkers * Dialogue ‚Äì Be the convenor of China's leading national, provincial and local dialogues on urban issues  Partners and Organization  The Founding Partners of the Initiative are McKinsey & Company, Columbia University's Global Center for East Asia, and the School of Public Policy and Management at Tsinghua University. The Initiative also maintains strategic partnerships with the Chinese Society for Urban Studies and the Institute of Urban Environmental Studies under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.  Research  Urban Sustainability Index The Urban Sustainability Index is the first tool of its kind designed specifically for Chinese cities. The Index is meant to help urban leaders make informed policy decisions by pinpointing cities that would benefit most from sustainable development initiatives, and to highlight effective case studies by locating and examining cities that have made great strides in recent years. UCI published the first USI in November 2010 and completed the first annual update in April, 2012. Urban Financing Lack of urban development funding has been one of the major bottlenecks for China's urbanization. This project explores financing models for local government that provide support for promoting urban development and meeting the various needs of the growing population. The research will review best international practice of urban financing by municipal governments as well as conduct several case studies. It will then comprehensively analyze problems existing in current urban financing mechanisms in China and financing needs of different local governments. Based on the analysis, the research will propose financing models and case studies especially for the development of the energy industry, infrastructure, affordable housing and industrial zones. Smart City The construction of smart cities could bring a new investment wave in urban infrastructure and change city management in many aspects. This project seeks an in-depth understanding of smart city construction practices in China, and to develop a smart city construction model fitting actual situation of China on the bases of related theories and international experiences. The research will review the basic concept and development history of smart city, and compare the experiences of the typical districts and cities in China (Beijing, Shanghai, Jiang‚Äôan (Wuhan), Zhenhai (Ningbo), Xixian (Xian), and so on) and developed countries. Monitoring and Evaluation of Local Government China is in a phase of rapid urbanization guided by the forthcoming National Plan of Promoting Healthy Development of Urbanization. This research will employ the Urban Indicator System jointly developed by the Urban China Initiative and the National Development and Reform Commission in 2012 to monitor the urbanization process at both national and local scale, evaluate developments in economy, society and environment and assess the implementation of urbanization policies. The research will also select high-performing cities to review their experience and identify possible suggestions for underperforming cities. The research is expected to propose the establishment of a nationwide database, to publish an annual monitoring report and to provide case studies of implementation of urbanization policies. Urban Indicator System The Urban China Initiative and the Department of Development Planning (DDP) at the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) are currently conducting joint research to build a comprehensive indicators system to assess the pace and quality of China's urbanization. The Urban Indicators System will be informed by UCI's past work in the area of sustainability indicators. The system will inform the drafting of the NDRC's long-term urban policy plan, in particular three major challenges facing China as it urbanizes: integration of migrants into cities, optimization of urban layouts and structures, and ensuring sustainable development of China's growing cities. Urban Citizenship of Chinese Migrants The Urban China Initiative cooperates with National Development and Reform Commission, Sichuan Development and Reform Commission, and Guangdong Development and Reform Commission on Policy Research on Urban Citizenship of Chinese Migrants. China‚Äôs urbanization witnesses a massive influx of rural peasants toward cities. These so-called migrant workers ‚Äì amounting to more than 200 million in China ‚Äì provided cheap and productive labor for China's economic boom in urban areas. But they usually fall victim to China's divided rural-urban social policies and are largely denied government benefits that urban residents receive. The central and local governments have launched a series of pilot programs to help migrants better integrate into cities. The UCI research aims to take stock of these experiments and provide inputs to relevant policy makings. Research on Mega Regions The Urban China Initiative works with the National Development and Reform Commission and Guangdong Development and Reform Commission in combining through the cases of mega region planning in the world in order to find the best international practices. The joint research makes a comprehensive review on the forming and evolving of mega regions. It also sums up the major challenges and solutions of a series of classic mega region cases in the world to provide strategic thinking to Chinese policy making in the field of spatial planning, density and intra- cluster network development. Grants The Urban China Initiative's grant program promotes innovative research on urban development in China, leading to the publication of working papers and implementation through city pilots. Upon completion of supported research projects, UCI reviews successful grant- supported projects for implementation in pilot programs at the city level in cooperation with local authorities. The Urban China Initiative accepts grant applications twice a year. To encourage researchers and practitioners pursuing the topic of sustainable urbanization, UCI accepts research applications on a bi-annual basis for grants up to RMB 100,000. Research for the grants is expected to be completed within a year. Successful applicants are required to produce a research paper to be published as part of the Initiative's research program. * Types of Grants Core Grants (up to RMB 100,000) are identified as Urban China Initiative projects and receive research assistance and analytical support from the Initiative in addition to grant funding. Research Grants (up to RMB 50,000) may be used to carry out the grantee's research proposal, including hiring research assistants, obtaining course relief, and funding travel and per diems. * Areas of Research UCI supports research on the effectiveness of programs and technologies related to urban development; emerging domestic and global best practices in project design, development, and execution; and paths to successful structural adjustment in China's cities. Grant-supported research focuses on sustainable urbanization, including but not limited to public health, energy efficiency, consumer awareness, public finance, industrial policy, migrant labor, urban infrastructure, environmental issues, social development, housing and land, and education.  Events  Annual Forum The UCI Annual Forum provides an inclusive forum for international and Chinese urban thinkers to discuss urban problems and trends, to trigger innovative ideas for solutions, and to create a network of policy makers, professionals and academics. The UCI hosted its first annual forum in Beijing on October 22, 2011, providing a dialogue platform for over 300 participants. And the 2012 annual forum in Beijing on September 7, involves more than 400 urbanists from central and local government, academia, corporates, and nonprofits. Urban Leaders Roundtable The Urban Leaders Roundtable Series is UCI's quarterly flagship and invitation-only event. The event brings together 20 leaders in China, including ministers, government directors, corporate senior executives, NGO leaders, and top academic theorists. The roundtable series examines pressing urban issues in China. Training The UCI hosts and co-organizes trainings on urban issues. These trainings provide theoretical and practical knowledge for urbanists to think in a professional, systematic, and long-term way and make wiser decisions for the sustainable development of China's cities. Trainers are mainly scholars and professional experts in urban affairs. It is our hope that these training sessions will help Chinese cities learn from domestic and international best practices. Workshops Despite of Annual Forum and Urban Leaders Roundtable, a series of urbanization workshops are held to convene professionals involved in China's urban affairs to examine problems, solutions, and implications of specific urbanization challenges.

In foreign policy, Kutlug Bilge Kaghan maintained alliance with the Tang China. He was created Prince of Fengyi (Â•â‰πâÁéã) and Huairen Khagan (ÊÄÄ‰ªÅÂèØÊ±ó). In 745 Uighurs defeated last Turkic Kaghan Baimei Khagan (744 - 745), and Kutlug Bilge Kaghan ordered to send his head to Chang'an, after which the Tang Emperor generously thanked him with entitling him \\"Supernumerary General-in- chief of Left Courageous Guard\\" (Â∑¶È™ÅÂç´ÂëòÂ§ñÂ§ßÂ∞ÜÂÜõ). For the next two years, the Uighur power continuously expanded, although its control did not reach the size of the Turkic Khaganate. He died in 747 and left his son Tay Bilge Tutuq as heir to throne, however his other son Bayanchur Khan was killed him and usurped the throne. He had another son - Tun Bagha Tarkhan who later rose to be a khagan as well.  Reorganized tribes  At first he proclaimed himself as Tokuz Oghuz khagan (). Nine tribes included Dokuz Oghuz (nine Oghuz tribes), which were the Khaganal clan/sub-tribe Yaglakar () and eight Uighur clans/sub-tribes known in Chinese rendering: # Huduoge ËÉ°ÂíÑËëõ # Guluowu ÂïíÁΩóÂãø # Mogexiqi Ë≤äÊ≠åÊÅØËÆ´ # A-Wudi ÈòøÂãøÂòÄ # Gesa ËëõËê® # Huwasu ÊñõÂó¢Á¥† # Yaowuge Ëó•ÂãøËëõ # Xiyawu Â•öÁâôÂãø According to Edwin Pulleybank six Tiele tribes in the confederation - Bugu (ÂÉïÂõ∫), Hun (Ê∏æ), Bayegu (ÊãîÈáéÂè§), Tongluo (ÂêåÁæÖ), Sijie (ÊÄùÁµê) and Qibi (Â•ëËãæ) had an equal status with the Uighurs (Ëø¥Á¥á); the reduced Basmyls numbered eight sub-tribes, and Karluks had three sub-tribes, thus the collective appellation √ú√ß-Karluk (Three Karluks).Edwin G.

It was quarried in several locations on the south-west coast of the Greek island of Euboea, between the modern-day cities of Styra and Karystos. Some of these ancient quarries survive with a mine-face of over 100 metres. It has a white-green base, with thick wavy green ribs, held onto the path by strata of mica. The colour of its base and grain grows darker the further north the location of the quarry. It is a metamorphic rock, a crystalline marble with crystals between 0.2 and 0.6 mm, with coloured veins of epidote and chlorite.

The quarries yielding it became imperial property, and cipollino marble became common throughout Rome during the imperial period. It was principally used for column shafts, including large and mainly smooth ones, such as the columns of the pronaos of the temple of Antoninus and Faustina in the Forum in Rome. It was also used for sculpture, such as that of a crocodile in the Canopus at the Villa Adriana at Tivoli, where its colour was used to imitate the colour of crocodile skin. It continued to be mined and used by the Byzantine Empire well into the 5th century AD.

The locomotive was exported in a new condition on a steamer from New York to Tasmania, Australia, where it was used by the Public Works Department on the Marrawah Tramway in Tasmania's far north west running between Smithton and Marrawah. On the Marrawah Tramway, the locomotive was locally known as \\"Big Ben\\", however it was also referred to as Marrawah tramway No. 3. When the Tasmanian Government Railways taken over the Marrawah tramway in 1929, the engine passed into their ownership. Big Ben was apparently light on the front wheels and as a result, the front was often prone to rise above the wheels when running front first. On the 6 September 1938 when running with a load of logs the wheels risen up again but when they came down they didn't find the rails resulting in a derailment which caused the driver to die from injuries the next day. After this incident, a load of old rails were tied to the front of the engine to weigh it down. In April 1946, Big Ben was sent to Launceston to receive a general overhaul but was only used as a standby engine on the tram due to the Tasmanian Government Railways introduction of more powerful locomotives. In mid 1948 the Tasmanian Government Railways sent Big Ben to work on the Parattah to Oatlands railway in southern Tasmania because the other engines working it were needed on other branch lines. In 1949 after the Parattah to Oatlands lines closure Big Ben was sent to Launceston as a shunter and was scrapped in October 1951.

After studying law, physics and natural history, in 1791 he was appointed to a diplomatic post by Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. From 1832 onwards he was the director of Gotha's royal science and art collections and he also wrote the five-volume Geschichte der durch √úberlieferung nachgewiesenen nat√ºrlichen Ver√§nderungen der Erdoberfl√§che from 1822 to 1841. Career and Contributions to Geology In 1813 Von Hoff became Privy Councilor. From 1817 to 1820, he cooperated with Johann Wolfgang von Goethe in the reorganization of the University of Jena. After the death of the last duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, Frederick IV, who died without descendants, von Hoff introduced the new inheritance regulations to prevent the scattering of the rich scientific collections and art collections in Gotha at Schloss Friedenstein, which he took over in 1832. In 1826 he was elected foreign member of the G√∂ttingen Academy of Sciences. In 1836, a year before his death, he was elected a member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina. Von Hoff's \\"History of natural changes in the earth's surface proven by tradition\\" (5 volumes, Gotha 1822-1841) justified the principle of actuality (Actualism, in German Aktualit√§tsprinzip) in departure from the catastrophe theory (cataclysm theory) and cleared the way for the scientific nature of geology. Another independent author of the principle of actuality is James Hutton in Scotland. Charles Lyell, widely regarded as a developer of up-to-dateness and generally acknowledging him, found it independent of Hoff, but later acknowledged Hoff's priority. In the words of Victor R. Baker, \\"...Lyell used the understanding of present-day causes to interpret the deep past ‚Äî a principle termed actualism. Rudwick [in Worlds Before Adam] explains that Lyell's excellent descriptions ... derived from an original listing by the eighteenth-century German scholar Karl Ernst Adolf von Hoff. Lyell greatly extended the actualistic method by making pronouncements about how the complex geological processes of the past occurred through the progressive action of small-scale procedures that were still in operation, and by prescribing how geologists should reason about these past processes.\\" ‚Äî from \\"Geological history turned upside down\\" a book review of Worlds Before Adam: The Reconstruction of Geohistory in the Age of Reform, by Martin J. S. Rudwick, in Nature, Published: 23 July 2008 miscellaneous His extensive mineralogical collection was donated by Hoff in 1818 to the Natural History Cabinet in Gotha.

Colonel Baldev Sethi (Kanwaljit Singh) (or Bali as he is called affectionately in the film by those that know him), was an army veteran and commanding officer, and he values discipline; he also faces life with the same stoicism that helped him win medals of valour in combat.

A virile young Sardar, Bali and Pixie share a fondness for conviviality for life and the company of attractive young women, drink, and hearts as big as Punjab's farmlands. Pixie's over-possessiveness of those he loves often leads to predicaments that call for Bali to help resolve the consequences.

Sloss was born in Sydney to William Sloss, a Scottish migrant, and his wife Catherine O'Neill. He was educated at St Joseph's Sisters of Mercy School and Plunkett Street Public School before being employed by Sydney City Council from 1925 to 1939. In 1927 he joined the Labor Party, and was active in the Municipal and Shires' Employees Union from 1925. On 23 December 1931 he married Catherine Moffat, with whom he had two daughters. In 1939, Sloss was elected to Sydney City Council for Phillip Ward; he would serve until 1941, and again for Macquarie Ward from 1950 to 1953. Sloss was also involved in the various Labor splits of the 1930s and 1940s, being a member of the State Labor Party. From 1941 to 1945 he served in the 2nd Australian Imperial Force and was a gunner during the bombing of Darwin. He returned to become a shipping clerk and waterside worker before resuming his political career. In 1956, Sloss was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as the Labor member for King, succeeding the retiring member, Labor's Daniel Clyne. A safe seat, Sloss held it easily until its abolition in 1973, when he retired. He was deputy chairman of the parliamentary party from 1968 to 1973. Sloss died in Sydney in 1990.

Graffiti in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, is a cause of much disagreement among its residents. Graffiti is seen by some as an art form adding to the Toronto culture; however, others see graffiti as form of vandalism, viewing it as ugly, or as a form of property damage. History Graffiti in a Toronto alley in 2005. It is believed that the Toronto graffiti movement started in the late 1980s. Certainly by the mid-1990s, many graffiti pieces and tags were observable in various alleyways and other outdoor areas around the city, with a book collection of some of those works (the book also viewable digitally in PDF from the ‚ÄúTags & Pieces‚Äù footnote link below) appearing in 1997. One blogger remarked that pieces on Toronto buildings, walls and overpasses embrace the culture of New York CityKefentse 2009 and what it contributed to Toronto's graffiti scene; however, there are some who believe that Toronto graffiti has a unique flavor to its work because it often represents various cultures. There are several reasons why Toronto has such a rich history of graffiti: the city has a lot of controversy over graffiti, the city has many visible spots for artists to show their work (such as graffiti alley), as well as willing artists that challenge the city. The schism created by these artists is the reason why many believe Toronto's graffiti scene is so dynamic and influential in its circles.Senses Lost 2009 In earlier years, many works were original and told an important story from the artists‚Äô point of view. Many still hold themes of love and family, tell stories of their lives, or use graffiti to share with the city the artists' never-happening dream. In September 2019, graffiti art on 26 garage doors near Ossington Street and Queen Street West were accidentally painted over black by a contractor to the not-for-profit Laneway Project. Weeks later, graffiti artists were invited to restore the street art. Debate over graffiti A request for art, or an act of vandalism? The question if graffiti constitutes one or the other has become a topic of debate in Toronto. There has been a debate regarding the issue of graffiti in Toronto as to whether or not graffiti constitutes art or vandalism, especially with recent Mayor Rob Ford vowing to remove all graffiti from the City of Toronto, defining graffiti as \\"One or more letters, symbols, figures, etching, scratches, inscriptions, stains, or other markings that disfigure or deface a structure or thing, howsoever made or otherwise affixed on the structure or thing, but, for greater certainty, does not include an art mural\\" describes and defines an art mural as a \\"mural for a designated surface and location that has been deliberately implemented for the purpose of beautifying the specific location.\\" Mural work also serves as a platform to create and link communities, document history and tradition, and to facilitate purpose and voice to its collaborators. Mural painting is not simply about making something visually appealing; the majority of active mural artists create work that captures the human experience and transforms intangible words and emotion to something that can be seen and touched. Graffiti is managed through a coordinating body established under the municipal government of Toronto's Graffiti Management Plan. The body provides support and municipal recognition for legitimate instances of graffiti, although also provides support, and enforcement against illegal instances of graffiti. By-laws governing legitimate and illegitimate instances of graffiti are found in the City of Toronto Municipal Code. Efforts to curb graffiti A person painting over graffiti in Toronto There are many coalitions that have been created to deter and remove graffiti in Toronto. These organizations or groups agree that graffiti has many negative effects on the city. The official website for the City of Toronto has stated that graffiti can promote a belief that community laws protecting property can be disregarded and that graffiti creates a sense of disrespect for property that may result in an increase of crime.City of Toronto Graffiti Abatement Program The \\"Graffiti Transformation Program\\" is an annual community investment program which hires youth to remove graffiti and resurface the walls with attractive murals. Since the program's start in 1996, over 9,000 tags have been removed, over 300 sites cleaned, and 430 murals created. The program has provided jobs, training, and skills to approximately 1,276 youth.Graffiti Transformation Program The Toronto Police Services have also undertaken the \\"Graffiti Eradication Program\\" which is defined as \\"a service-wide initiative focusing on the reduction of crime, fear, and disorder as it relates to graffiti.\\"Graffiti Eradication Program Bylaws The Council of the City of Toronto has also put in place a graffiti bylaw. This bylaw lists definitions, prohibitions, and the cost of the offense.CoT bylaw \\"Graffiti art\\" and \\"graffiti vandalism\\" are distinguished. Individuals and businesses under this bylaw must remove graffiti vandalism on their property at their own expense or else the city will remove the graffiti for them and send the bill. Graffiti allowed by municipal permits is called \\"graffiti art\\". Graffiti art does not need to be removed. Legitimization of graffiti laneway south of Queen Street West from John Street to Bathurst Street was named an area of municipal significance in 2011, with programs later created to nurture legal street art. A public effort that legitimized the use of graffiti was established by the Queen Street West Business Improvement Association (BIA) for the area colloquially known as Graffiti Alley (originally Rush Lane). Chair of the BIA, Spencer Sutherland, initiated this movement to protect property owners who did not wish to remove the graffiti street art and were being ticketed. The BIA claimed that the area was culturally significant, citing Rick Mercer's use of the laneway during \\"Rick‚Äôs Rants\\" on CBC Television, and argued that it is a popular destination for photography and draws urban tourists to the area on a daily basis. The entire laneway south of Queen St West from John Street to Bathurst Street was officially designated as an area of municipal significance in the Graffiti Management Plan adopted by Toronto City Council on July 12, 2011. In September 2015, Vogue Magazine cited Queen West as the second coolest neighbourhood in the world, crediting the area's trendsetting \\"street style\\" to Graffiti Alley. The Queen St West BIA and local tour company Tour Guys host walking tours through Graffiti Alley for visitors to experience and learn about graffiti street art. Notable Toronto graffiti artists In an attempt by the City of Toronto to clean up graffiti while not differentiating between art and vandalism, many graffiti artists or \\"writers\\" are only identifiable by their signatures in order to remain anonymous.White 2011 Serious and experienced writers follow unwritten rules amongst each other in order to maintain a hierarchy of respect within the community.Alcoba 2001 Toronto maintains the StART Program maintains a directory of street artists and writers based/from Toronto, or have graffiti in Toronto. The registry has grown to approximately 200 entries as of April 2019. Artists and writers that have a background in graffiti that is registered in the StART program include ARTCHILD, Getso, Jessey Pacho, Li-Hill, MEDIAH, Nando Zev√™, Peru 143, Shalak Attack, shayne rivet, SPH, Style Over Status. Takeo Ten. In 2019, the bar \\"Graffiti Spot\\" was opened with the aim to promote art by local graffiti writers. In popular culture The \\"Rant\\" segment of CBC Television's Rick Mercer Report features comedian Rick Mercer walking along the graffiti-covered alleys of Queen Street West, in which he discusses his personal views on contemporary Canadian politics. This segment was originally on another CBC Television show This Hour Has 22 Minutes before Rick Mercer Report was spun off. Notes References *What is the city doing about graffiti?

The name CRM (chloroplast RNA splicing and ribosome maturation) has been suggested to reflect the functions established for four characterised members of the family: Zea mays (Maize) CRS1, CAF1 and CAF2 proteins and the Escherichia coli protein YhbY. Proteins containing the CRM domain are found in eubacteria, archaea, and plants. The CRM domain is represented as a stand-alone protein in archaea and bacteria, and in single- and multi-domain proteins in plants. It has been suggested that prokaryotic CRM proteins existed as ribosome-associated proteins prior to the divergence of archaea and bacteria, and that they were co-opted in the plant lineage as RNA binding modules by incorporation into diverse protein contexts. Plant CRM domains are predicted to reside not only in the chloroplast, but also in the mitochondrion and the nucleo/cytoplasmic compartment. The diversity of the CRM domain family in plants suggests a diverse set of RNA targets. The CRM domain is a compact alpha/beta domain consisting of a four-stranded beta sheet and three alpha helices with an alpha-beta-alpha-beta-alpha-beta-beta topology. The beta sheet face is basic, consistent with a role in RNA binding. Proximal to the basic beta sheet face is another moiety that could contribute to nucleic acid recognition. Connecting strand beta1 and helix alpha2 is a loop with a six amino acid motif, GxxG flanked by large aliphatic residues, within which one 'x' is typically a basic residue. Escherichia coli YhbY is associated with pre-50S ribosomal subunits, which implies a function in ribosome assembly. GFP fused to a single-domain CRM protein from maize localises to the nucleolus, suggesting that an analogous activity may have been retained in plants. A CRM domain containing protein in plant chloroplasts has been shown to function in group I and II intron splicing. In vitro experiments with an isolated maize CRM domain have shown it to have RNA binding activity. These and other results suggest that the CRM domain evolved in the context of ribosome function prior to the divergence of Archaea and Bacteria, that this function has been maintained in extant prokaryotes, and that the domain was recruited to serve as an RNA binding module during the evolution of plant genomes. YhbY has a fold similar to that of the C-terminal domain of translation initiation factor 3 (IF3C), which binds to 16S rRNA in the 30S ribosome.

This provides a mechanism for comparing outcomes across local authority areas and Ireland‚Äôs performance at EU level. Together with help from The Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI),The Economic and Social Research Institute. http://www.esri.ie/news_events/latest_press_releases/annual_monitoring_report_/index.xml The Centre has developed the first national monitoring framework and tool for Ireland. It uses integration indicators with the goal of assisting government at local and national levels to meet its monitoring obligations. This Integration Monitor seeks to measure migrant integration in four life domains annually: employment, education, social inclusion and active citizenship.  Integration Planning  The Integration Centre collaborates with local authorities around the country in the implementation of integration plans. The Centre works towards creating interest among key stakeholder groups at Local Authority level; supporting the formation of integration fora; enhancing ethnic minority participation; the provision of training; and the monitoring of progress over time.  Policy and Advocacy Development   Information & Personal Casework  The Integration Centre provides immigrants with information on a number of different issues such as citizenship, family reunification, and the asylum system; by offering information clinics in Galway and Dublin. And also offers phone and email services.  Funders  The Integration Centre receives the majority of its funding from three organizations:The Global Village on News Talk Radio. http://www.newstalk.ie/2010/programmes/all-programmes/global- village/integration-centre-e-bulletin/ ‚Ä¢ The Atlantic Philanthropies who is dedicated to bringing about lasting changes in the lives of people who are disadvantaged by their economic situation, race, nationality, gender, age, disabilities, immigration status, sexual orientation, political affiliation or religion. ‚Ä¢ The One Foundation which is a private philanthropic fund based in Dublin, Ireland. Its aim is to significantly improve the life chances of disadvantaged children and young people in Ireland and Vietnam. By supporting non-profit organisations, they address three key social issues that affect young people today: Poverty & Disadvantage, Mental Health and the Integration of Minorities. ‚Ä¢ The Citizens Information Board which is the statutory body which supports the provision of information, advice and advocacy on a broad range of public and social services. It provides the Citizens Information website, and supports the voluntary network of Citizens Information Centres and the Citizens Information. It also funds and supports the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS).  Merger with Immigrant Council of Ireland  In late 2014 The Integration Centre announced it would be merging with the Immigrant Council of Ireland focusing on the monitoring of National and Local Government Integration Strategies.

Lappl√§ndische Reise und andere Schriften. Leipzig. The Expedition to Lapland, the northernmost region in Sweden, by Carl Linnaeus in 1732 was an important part of his scientific career. Linnaeus departed from Uppsala and travelled clockwise around the coast of the Gulf of Bothnia over the course of six months, making major inland incursions from Ume√•, Lule√• and Tornio. His observations became the basis of his book Flora Lapponica (1737) in which Linnaeus‚Äô ideas about nomenclature and classification were first used in a practical way.Frodin, David 2002. Guide to Standard Floras of the World, 2nd ed. Cambridge University Press: Cambridge. p. 27. Linnaeus kept a journal of his expedition which was first published posthumously as an English translation called Lachesis Lapponica: A Tour in Lapland (1811). Background In April 1732, Linnaeus was awarded a grant from the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala for his journey. Olof Rudbeck the Younger, one of Linnaeus' former professors at Uppsala University, had made an expedition to Lapland in 1695, but the detailed results of his exploration were lost in a fire seven years afterwards. Linnaeus' hope was to find new plants, animals and possibly valuable minerals. He was also curious about the customs of the native Sami people, reindeer-herding nomads who wandered the vast tundras of Scandinavia.Anderson (1997) Pages 42‚Äì43Blunt (2001) Page 38 Uppsala to Ume√• Linnaeus began his expedition from Uppsala in May; he travelled on foot and horse, bringing with him his journal, botanical and ornithological manuscripts and sheets of paper for pressing plants. It took him 11 days to reach Ume√•, via G√§vle (near which he found great quantities of Campanula serpyllifolia, later known as Linnaea borealis, the twinflower that would become his favourite).Blunt (2001) Pages 42‚Äì43 He sometimes dismounted on the way to examine a flower or rockAnderson (1997) Pages 43‚Äì44 and was particularly interested in mosses and lichens, the latter a main part of the diet of the reindeer, a common animal in Lapland.Anderson (1997) Page 46 First inland incursion From Ume√•, Linnaeus headed towards Lycksele, a town much further inland from the coast than he had traveled until then, examining water birds on the way. After five days, he reached the town and stayed with the pastor and his wife. He then attempted to reach Sorsele but had to turn around at a place called Lycksmyran (\\"lucky marsh\\") due to extremely difficult conditions.Blunt (2001) Pages 47‚Äì51 In the beginning of June he returned to Ume√• after having spent additional days in Lycksele, and learning more of the customs of the Sami.Blunt (2001) Pages 45‚Äì47 (See e.g. Tablut) Ume√• to Lule√• and second inland incursion After returning to Ume√•, he travelled further north along the coast of the Gulf of Bothnia, via Skellefte√• and Old Pite√•, passing Old Lule√• where he received a Sami woman's cap on the way.Anderson (1997) Pages 50‚Äì51 From Lule√• he again traveled inland, following the Lule River via Jokkmokk on the arctic circle and Kvikkjokk (then Hyttan), into the Scandinavian Mountains, crossing the border into Norway, arriving in S√∏rfold on the coast and making a trip to nearby R√∂rstadt. He then returned the way he came, approximately back to Lule√•.Blunt (2001) Pages 55‚Äì56 Lule√• to Tornio, third inland incursion and return to Uppsala Linnaeus then continued his travel along the coast to Tornio (Torne√• in Swedish), from which he made his third and final inland incursion, along the Torne River as far as Vittangi. He spent some time in the Tornio area; in Kalix he received instructions in assaying. In the middle of September he began his return journey. Travelling via Kemi, he followed the Finnish coastline to Turku (√Öbo in Swedish), where he sailed via the √Öland Islands, arriving in Sweden in Grisslehamn and then finally home to Uppsala.Blunt (2001) Pages 64‚Äì65 Results He returned from his six-month-long, over expedition on 10 October, having gathered and observed many plants, birds and rocks.Blunt (2001) Pages 63‚Äì65Blunt (2004) Pages 39‚Äì42Broberg (2006) Page 29 Although Lapland was a region with limited biodiversity, Linnaeus described about a hundred previously undescribed plants.

Currently owned and operated by BNSF Railway, it crosses an anabranch of the Columbia River known as North Portland Harbor and historically as the Oregon Slough. The bridge's northern end is on Hayden Island, which, along with Tomahawk Island, forms the north shore of the channel. Completed in 1908, the two-track bridge is one of only two swing bridges surviving in Portland, which once had several bridges of that type, both for road and rail traffic. The only other remaining swing bridge in the Portland area is another rail-only bridge on the same line, BNSF's nearby Bridge 9.6, spanning the Columbia River. The bridge is used regularly by freight trains of both BNSF and Union Pacific Railroad, as well as by Amtrak passenger trains on routes connecting Portland with Seattle and with Chicago via Spokane, Washington. The 8.8 in the name is the distance, in miles, from Portland's Union Station, the same as for Bridge 5.1 (across the Willamette River) and Bridge 9.6 on the same line. History The Oregon Slough Railroad Bridge was built in 1906‚Äì08 by the Northern Pacific Railway (NP) for use by the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway (SP&S;), as part of construction of a new line between Vancouver, Washington and Portland.

East from Portland, the south bank of the Columbia already had a rail line, owned by the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company (later absorbed by Union Pacific Railroad).

The term was introduced by Hiroo Kanamori in 1972. Such events are a result of relatively slow rupture velocities. They are particularly dangerous as a large tsunami may arrive at a coastline with little or no warning. A tsunami is a sea wave of local or distant origin that results from large-scale seafloor displacements associated with large earthquakes, major submarine slides, or exploding volcanic islands. Characteristics The distinguishing feature for a tsunami earthquake is that the release of seismic energy occurs at long periods (low frequencies) relative to typical tsunamigenic earthquakes. Earthquakes of this type do not generally show the peaks of seismic wave activity associated with ordinary events. A tsunami earthquake can be defined as an undersea earthquake for which the surface wave magnitude Ms differs markedly from the moment magnitude Mw, because the former is calculated from surface waves with a period of about 20 seconds, whereas the latter is a measure of the total energy release at all frequencies. The displacements associated with tsunami earthquakes are consistently greater than those associated with ordinary tsunamigenic earthquakes of the same moment magnitude, typically more than double. Rupture velocities for tsunami earthquakes are typically about 1.0 km per second, compared to the more normal 2.5-3.5 km per second for other megathrust earthquakes. These slow rupture speeds lead to greater directivity, with the potential to cause higher run-ups on short coastal sections. Tsunami earthquakes mainly occur at subduction zones where there is a large accretionary wedge or where sediments are being subducted, as this weaker material leads to the slower rupture velocities. Cause Analysis of tsunami earthquakes such as the 1946 Aleutian Islands earthquake shows that the release of seismic moment takes place at an unusually long period. Calculations of the effective moment derived from surface waves show a rapid increase with decrease in the frequency of the seismic waves, whereas for ordinary earthquakes it remains almost constant with frequency. The duration over which the seabed is deformed has little effect on the size of the resultant tsunami for times up to several minutes. The observation of long period energy release is consistent with unusually slow rupture propagation velocities. Slow rupture velocities are linked to propagation through relatively weak material, such as poorly consolidated sedimentary rocks. Most tsunami earthquakes have been linked to rupture within the uppermost part of a subduction zone, where an accretionary wedge is developed in the hanging wall of the megathrust. Tsunami earthquakes have also been linked to the presence of a thin layer of subducted sedimentary rock along the uppermost part of the plate interface, as is thought to be present in areas of significant topography at the top of the oceanic crust, and where propagation was in an up-dip direction, possibly reaching the seafloor. Identifying tsunami earthquakes Standard methods of giving early warnings for tsunamis rely on data that will not typically identify a tsunami earthquake as tsunamigenic and therefore fail to predict possibly damaging tsunamis. Examples 1896 Sanriku On 15 June 1896 the Sanriku coast was struck by a devastating tsunami with a maximum wave height of 38.2 m, which caused more than 22,000 deaths. The residents of the coastal towns and villages were taken completely by surprise because the tsunami had only been preceded by a relatively weak shock. The magnitude of the tsunami has been estimated as Mt=8.2 while the earthquake shaking only indicated a magnitude of Ms=7.2. This discrepancy in magnitude requires more than just a slow rupture velocity. Modelling of tsunami generation that takes into account additional uplift associated with deformation of the softer sediments of the accretionary wedge caused by horizontal movement of the 'backstop' in the overriding plate has successfully explained the discrepancy, estimating a magnitude of Mw=8.0-8.1. 1992 Nicaragua The 1992 Nicaragua earthquake was the first tsunami earthquake to be recorded with a broad-band seismic network.

The Wattental produces a high level of water power thanks to its large catchment area which is why internationally successful firms such as Swarovski, and Wattenspapier have been established in the village of Wattens by the River Inn. The Wattental was and is therefore the reason behind the economic boom of the market village of Wattens which has made it one of the wealthiest municipalities in Austria.

In 1911 the Marrawah Tramway Company purchased the locomotive for the Marrawah Tramway, and, when the loco had to be re-gauged from 4 ft in to 3 ft 6 in gauge, the width of the firebox didn't allow the frames to be brought in sufficiently to make room for wheel flanges of normal width, so the latter were only inches wide. When the engine first entered service it was easily distinguishable by the presence of an open-sided roof running the full length of the locomotive. On 5 February 1913 the loco hauled the first official load on the Marrawah Tramway (although timber getters J. S. Lee & Sons had likely done small timber haulage before). On that day the train set out from the 17-mile, where it loaded tons of cheese and 2 tons of wool and hides from the Marrawah area; from there the train went on towards Smithton.Marrawah Tramway. The Story of Circular Head‚Äôs first Rail-transport system. Circular Head Chronicle (Stanley, Tasmania), Wednesday, 22 September 1948. Page 6. This system continued for the next two years; each Wednesday the train left Smithton at 9 a.m., whilst at the same time the horse driver with the cargo left Marrawah. This system continued to work till the Public Works Department's takeover in 1914. When Spider passed into ownership of the Public Works Department in 1914, the locomotive was the only one that the PWD owned at the time and was considered by Mr Ford (manager of the tramway) as \\"our No. 1 engine\\", apparently meaning it in the numerical sense and in the qualitative sense of which Spider was considered the best engine the PWD owned until the arrival of \\"Big Ben\\" in 1919. In January 1917 Spider was taken by road from Smithton to Myalla and then railed to the TGR workshops in Launceston for a general overhaul, in the course of which the original bar frames (which were cracked) were replaced with plate frames. Another clear addition was that the former open roof was removed and a sheet metal cab with a galvanised iron roof was fitted; this would have been a great improvement for the drivers. After this the locomotive weighed in at tons. making it the second lightest of the four PWD engines. By the 1920s Spider's original boiler was getting badly worn out, and in April 1923 the Emu Bay Railway Company agreed to replace her boiler, and this appears to have been completed in November of that year. In 1929 the Marrawah tramway, along with all the PWD's locomotives and rolling stock, passed into ownership of the TGR, who continued to operate them but gradually started the dispersing of the small engines and employing larger C-class 2-6-0 locomotives. Head-on collision On 10 February 1937 Spider crashed into one of these larger locomotives. On that day C-class 4 with driver Davidson and fireman Simon departed Smithton with a heavy load for Marrawah, C 4 after passing the 4 & 6 mile marks was given permission from Smithton to proceed but was experiencing heavy going en route, relieving officer Speers at Smithton radioed Spider, which had hauled an earlier train to head back to the 19 mile to assist C4. When C4 reached the 19 mile it phoned Smithton, but, rather than being informed to wait for Spider, Mr Speers at Smithton was otherwise engaged, so Miss Geale at Smithton, with no knowledge of the agreement, gave C 4 permission to proceed. Spider, still intending to meet C4 at the 19-mile mark, met head on with C4 at the 20-mile mark in a violent collision. C4 only received damage to the cowcatcher, buffer and vacuum brake pipe, but Spider, being the smaller engine, with no momentum from a load behind, was badly damaged, with the head-on collision tearing the boiler from supportings and lifting it up. The water tank ripped from its mountings, the underside of the smokebox being lifted up on the boiler was crunched in, and the whistle and injector steam pipes were ripped from the steam dome. The local fitter suggested the engine \\"was and is overdue for a thorough repair\\", and the loco was sent to the Launceston workshops to receive a thorough overhaul. And during this period it was tried to get Big Ben to do Spider's work, but eventually an engine of Jaegers, presumably the Manning Wardle 0-4-0 ST Stanley was used instead for a short period; by 1938 \\"Spider was likely back in service.\\" A second collision On 8 August 1941 Spider was involved in another collision, but this time with the passenger railmotor DP 3. On that day Spider was heading out from Smithton with a load and DP 3 from Marrawah with passengers, It was intended for both engines to cross at the 19-mile mark. Driver Young on the railmotor was unable to call for clearance from Redpa and \\"ran the gauntlet\\" to the next block post to call for clearance from Redpa. Fireman Goodwin on Spider rang Smithton control from the 14-mile mark after a difficult trip. Porter O' Donnell at Smithton gave Spider clearance to the 17 mile, but in the following conversation about likely loading at various sidings neglected to tell Goodwin that he had cleared DP 3 to cross him at the 17 mile instead of the 19 mile. From here both engines were lost to the Smithton station master until a call came through that there was \\"a mess up the track with Spider and motor ahead at the 18 mile\\". Damage to both locos was extensive, but both held the rails and were towed to the 17-mile siding. The railmotors passengers got to Smithton clinging to a gang motor. Spider survived to be the last of the PWD's original four locomotives remaining at Smithton until, on 4 April 1949, Spider was purchased by the Britton Brothers for usage on their logging tramway at Brittons Swamp, Tasmania, which was a branch of the Marrawah Tramway. Spider was moved on the back of a lorry to Brittons Swamp because by that time most of the tramway up to where the Brittons' tramway branched off was torn up. Spider was put into service hauling loads of timber to the mill assisting the aging Marshall traction engine loco the Brittons already owned, although it was not very successful, but even so it worked up until 1954, when the Brittons obtained their \\"Diesel No. 1\\", and Spider was abandoned beside the track at the Britton Brothers electric mill. The locomotive's underframe and wheels were later separated from the locomotive and used as a log bogie on the tramway, and the boiler and cab left until in 1973, when the boiler was removed and fitted to the frames and wheels of \\"Six Wheeler\\" to create a display locomotive at the Marrawah Hall, which was dumped in the Marrawah tip in 1984.

She is portrayed by Jessica Sula. In Series 5, Grace's story arc revolves around her conflicting social roles ‚Äî as daughter of arrogant David Blood, as the quieter, more docile friend of Mini McGuinness and Liv Malone, and as the girlfriend, and eventual fianc√©e of Rich Hardbeck. On a trip to Morocco with her friends in Series 6, Grace is seriously injured in a car crash, the consequences of which set into motion the events of the sixth series. Characterisation Grace Blood, who goes by the alias Grace Violet, is the only daughter of David Blood, the headmaster of Roundview College. She is shown to be imaginative, idealistic and endearingly childish, though sometimes bordering on the point of naive, with actress Jessica Sula (who plays Grace) commenting that \\"[she has]...a kooky, eccentric side\\" to her personality. However, Grace can also be very level-headed, resourceful and practical minded, as shown in her series 5 episode, where she did not let her friends' personal affairs and conflicts disrupt her theatre production, instead using the tension to harness an effective and successful performance. She is hinted at to be the wallflower of the gang, staying on the sidelines but assessing everything accurately, for example, during a sleepover at her place, when she figured out Franky's attraction to Matty, as also her uneasiness in talking about her sexuality, thus quickly changing the topic. Grace is depicted to be culturally aware and very fond of literature and the arts; in her official Skins page, this is clearly visible as she lists a variety of classics as her favourites, like Lolita, Great Expectations, Wuthering Heights, Little Women and works by Jane Austen. She is fond of Shakespearean drama and loves romantic films and musicals, citing Moulin Rouge!, Casablanca and Grease as some examples. Grace herself is a theatre performer and a talented ballet dancer, as evident from Rich's series 5 episode, where her dance recital moved him to tears. She states that her lifelong ambition is \\"..to be cast as Odette in Swan Lake, with The Royal Ballet... because you get to play the black swan and the white swan.\\" Her ideal man is Mr. Darcy. In her Skins page, she also talks in lengthy details about her love for cats and everything Disney-related. In an interview with E4 dated March, 2011, Sula describes her character thus: > \\".....She is quite unique. She is very elegant. She likes her 1960s, Audrey > Hepburn / Grace Kelly style. She's a romantic. At the same time she can be > quite naive as to what's going on around her, or she likes to think she's > not aware of issues going on around her. She likes to block them out and > believe that everything is a fairytale fantasy world....She's quite sensible > in her own strange way. I think she is there to remind the group sometimes, > \\"Are you sure you want to do this? Think about it.\\" But she also brings a > lightheartedness and she is kind to everyone, so I think she is a bridge > builder. She will try and fix things.\\" In contrast to the hedonistic, promiscuous and wild nature of typical Skins characters, Grace is portrayed as responsible, sweet-tempered, and goal- oriented. Being brought up by her strict father, David Blood, she is far more conservative and practical than the more rebellious Mini and Liv. Noteworthy, she is one of the few Skins characters who are never seen smoking in any scene, and the only romantic relationship she has in the entire show is with her boyfriend, Rich Hardbeck. She is also often cited to be very beautiful, not just by Rich but by other members of the gang, including Alo, who calls her one of the most attractive people in their college. Synopsis Series 5 In \\"Franky\\", Grace is introduced as one of Mini McGuinness's friends. Unlike Mini and Liv, however, she takes an immediate liking to Franky, whose quiet, isolated nature immediately earns her sympathy. She accompanies the gang on a trip to the local shopping centre, where she robs a store. After escaping the police, Mini, Liv and Grace go to Franky's house, where they discover some embarrassing pictures of Franky have been left on her social networking account. Later, she is dismayed when Mini has the pictures pasted onto the walls of the school, and when Franky returns home, she discovers Grace has come to apologise personally. Grace appeals to Franky to come to Mini's party. At the party, Franky confronts Mini, but Grace cannot bring herself to say anything against Mini. Instead, she gets Alo and Rich to kidnap Franky and take her to the local swimming pool, and they bond as a gang of their own. In Rich, Franky recommends Grace help Rich learn to interact with girls, due to his own shyness around them. Rich is very much against the idea at first, because Grace \\"represents everything he despises in the world\\"-feminine, soft-spoken and dreamy as she is. He also makes constant rude remarks and sexist comments to her that get on her nerves. Eventually, though, she is able to use her acting skills to transform herself into a cynical metalhead very much like Rich, and is able to quote some of his favourite bands. But Rich, though impressed, tells her that her meek nature allows her friends to walk all over her, to her offense. Rich is ultimately unsuccessful in chatting up a girl he likes, and Grace immediately takes the opportunity to ask Rich out. But he turns her down, and Grace is distraught. However, soon after, Rich has a change of heart after getting deafened by a record and watching a beautiful ballet performance of hers. She then takes him to a Napalm Death concert, at which they have a good time. Although Grace is reluctant to let Mini and Liv know she has feelings for Rich, they agree to remain in touch. In Mini, Grace recruits the help of Franky to organise the dresses for the charity fashion show Roundview is organising, but their reasonable ideas are laughed at by Mini who, out of pure pride and arrogance, decides to overhaul the show to match her own ideas. She continues to insult Grace after the meeting, who is offended by Mini's unkindness and stops being her friend. She then forms a relationship with Rich, and they share a kiss at the after-show rave. In Alo, Grace and Rich turn up at the party that Alo has arranged at his farmhouse (in order to spite his domineering parents). There, they secretly make a plan to have sex that night, for the first time. Alo turns up at Rich's house after his father has a heart attack, but cannot bring himself to burden Rich with his troubles, due to Rich's elation at having finally had sex with Grace. In Grace, Rich is aghast to discover that Grace's father is David Blood, the snobbish, pushy headmaster of Roundview College. David is less than impressed to discover that Grace is in a relationship with Rich, whom he perceives to be below his family, and decides that it is time she is sent back to Mayberry's College, an all-girls' boarding school where Grace originally attended. Grace is upset, and persuades him to compromise, and he agrees to let her stay at Roundview if she gets good marks in her AS Theatre Studies exam, a production of Twelfth Night. However, Blood intends to sabotage her play by persuading Rich to do badly on purpose, with the promise of recommending his father, a low-ranking Civil Servant, for the position of Headmaster of Roundview College when he leaves. Grace's production is also marred by the love triangle formed between Liv, Matty and Franky, whose conflict spills out onto the play when Liv makes Matty quit. Grace, at the advice of her mother and after identifying with Hamlet in his sea of troubles soliloquy, decides to instead force Matty and Liv to rejoin the play, and makes it more interesting by including a kiss between Olivia and Cesario, forcing Mini, and later Liv, to kiss Franky. Rich agrees to have dinner with the Bloods, which is uncomfortable at best, and notes to her that she is a different person around her father. Despite their success in the play, however, Blood decides that Grace must return to Mayberry's anyway, to her fury. Her mother's effort to console her is unsuccessful, and merely results in Grace deriding the fairy tales and children's stories her mother used to read to her. However, at that moment, Rich turns up outside Grace's room, creating a re-enactment of a scene from Romeo and Juliet, and asks her to marry him. Grace agrees and responds with Miranda's soliloquy in The Tempest. In Everyone, Grace and Rich put their wedding into action, and arrange one just outside Bristol, forging her father's signature onto a form in order to make it legal. Unfortunately, Alo (the driver) has not brought a proper map with him, and gets lost in a secluded forest with his van damaged. Grace and Rich hitch a ride to the church, arriving just in time to get a later slot. Fearing their friends won't show up, they recruit an elderly couple to be their witnesses. However, the gang does eventually show up, but so does Professor Blood, who had placed a tracking bug in a brooch he gave Grace. Blood is eventually talked down by Nick Levan, and sullenly agrees to let the ceremony continue. But Rich and Grace decide they no longer need to marry, and leave their relationship at that. Series 6 In Everyone, Grace and Rich travel to Morocco, for a holiday with the rest of the gang. The two find themselves having to sleep on the roof, but Grace is optimistic as ever, and enjoys the holiday. However, tragedy strikes when Franky goes off with Luke, a British drug dealer on holiday, who blackmails Matty to deliver some cannabis into Marrakech. Grace, Liv and Matty instead get into Matty's car and chase Luke's vehicle. Matty's dangerously fast driving eventually results in a severe car accident that injures Liv and mortally injures Grace. Matty flees the scene, knowing that he will most likely be arrested if he is caught, and the last thing he sees is Grace's bloodied, almost-lifeless body in the ruins of his car. Grace is transferred to a hospital in Britain, and David Blood has refused Rich, or anyone in the gang, permission to see her, although a sympathetic nurse manages to smuggle Grace a CD of Rich's, which she had previously recorded vocals for. In Rich, Rich has been waiting for ages for Grace to come out of her coma, and making every effort to sneak past David Blood to see her. One day, he receives a phone call from her, and rushes to the hospital, where Grace is seemingly all right. As they are about to get intimate, Blood enters and has Rich escorted from the premises, telling him that he is having Grace taken to Switzerland. When Rich attempts to reason with him later, he arrives to discover that the Bloods have left. Distraught, Rich breaks into their house and squats there, occupying his time by doing drugs, practicing with his and Alo's band, and watching Grace's baby videos. His attempts to reach Grace in Switzerland fail, as Blood merely intercepts the call, but he later receives another call from her, and arranges to meet her in Paris. The gang decide to hold a fundraiser in the Bloods' house to raise money for a trip to Paris, which results in the house getting trashed. During the party, however, Rich sees Grace in the crowd, and follows her upstairs, where they have sex. The next day, however, Rich wakes up to discover the room empty. He receives a final call from Grace, who cryptically tells him that she has to go, and that \\"it's so beautiful out here.\\" Confused, he looks at the phone and discovers it is actually broken. He goes back inside, where David Blood has returned. Blood explains that Grace had never come out of her coma (revealing that Rich's visions of her were hallucinations) and tearfully informs him that Grace has died. In Alex, a memorial service is held in honour of Grace at the college, however, her friends are put off by all the fake mourners who never really knew her. Mini reacts hostilely to Alex because she thinks Liv is attempting to use him as a substitute for Grace. In Franky, Grace appears as a vision before Franky, in a playground. Later, consumed by guilt, Franky has a meltdown at therapy repeatedly screaming \\"I'm sorry!\\" presumably for having indirectly caused the death of her best friend. In Liv, Liv mourns her friend privately, and sorrow, coupled with fear of dying causes her to feel a psychosomatic lump on her stomach. Her anger causes her to lash out at Mini, who she thinks is not devastated enough by Grace's loss, as well as Franky and Matty, both of whom she holds to be culpable for the accident. The episode ends with Liv, her sister Maude, Rich and Doug, a teacher at Roundview, paying a visit to Grace's grave and watching old videos shot by her. In Mini and Franky, Rich tells Alo about how he often wondered what would happen if he and Grace ever had a family of their own, prompting Alo to make it up with Mini, who is pregnant with his child. In Everyone, Rich, while at Alex's farewell party has a vision of Grace sitting at the same swimming pool where they'd first bonded in series 5. The two dive underwater, where they kiss, following which Grace disappears. This is her last appearance. The fact that Grace was going to die was foreshadowed in several ways: * In her episode in series 5, Grace, unable to deal with the stress of work and relationships, has a breakdown when she smashes a mirror, a superstition which is said to bring upon the individual seven years of bad luck. * In the same episode when Rich asks her where she is off to, she angrily retorts, \\"....[to a]castle in the clouds!\\" * Grace and Rich have lots of parallels to Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, a common trope used in media to denote a doomed relationship. * Grace had written a short story named \\"The Dancer and the Metal Man\\", a symbolic tale about her relationship with Rich, which was loosely based on Andersen's The Steadfast Tin Soldier. The original story ends with both the dolls being charred to death as the price of staying together. * In an \\"Unseen Skins\\" episode, Rich and Grace go for a zombie film marathon. Soon after, under the effect of alcohol, they collectively experience a nightmare where zombies ravage the streets, ultimately fatally maiming Grace. The short ends with Rich and Grace deciding to visit Morocco to relieve themselves of boredom. * Just before they head to the beach party culminating in the car crash, Grace and Rich have a discussion about how each of them would react if the other died. * Rich's series 6 episode is replete in foreshadowing. Shortly before she makes love to Rich, Grace talks about how she has left her father behind because \\"he...couldn't get past things.\\" Grace's death is a major blow to the gang, and results in many of them going off the rails - Franky gets herself involved with Luke's organised street fighting, Liv embarks on a wild-living lifestyle with her new friend, Alex Henley, Mini attempts to reconnect with her wealthy father and ends up getting pregnant, Nick and Matty find themselves at odds over Franky, and Alo accidentally commits statutory rape. The gang eventually manage to move on from her death after Mini's baby is born, whom she names Grace after her deceased friend, and the series ends with Rich staring heavenwards and saying goodbye to her.  Reception  The reception towards the character has been generally positive, especially the romantic arc with Rich. Grace has featured in many Top 10 Skins Character lists, with online forum Cultbox mentioning that, \\"Keeping cynicism and peer pressure at bay with her butter-wouldn‚Äôt-melt smile, Grace plays a key, almost exclusive role in bringing the outcasts and the cool kids together to form the class of 2011-2012.\\" Television blog Rophydoes praised the fact that Grace \\"defies the manic pixie girl stereotype.....She‚Äôs actually awfully smart, and not just in the dreamy way where she reads Sartre and finds the hope in it. Grace is smart in the way where she‚Äôs smarter than everyone else around her, and not above using that to her advantage.\\" While criticising certain aspects of Series 6, a reviewer noted that killing off Grace was a mis-step as she \\"was this [the third generation's] bright spot.\\" A Buzzfeed article dated 2015, ranked Rich and Grace as Number 1 out of all the Skins couples, calling them \\"one of the most perfect couples ever.\\" References Category:Skins (British TV series) characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2011 Category:Fictional ghosts Category:Fictional ballet dancers Category:Fictional Black British people Category:Fictional British people ","title":"Grace Blood"},{"id":"32463434","text":"Kus may refer to: *Kus, a Persian musical instrument *Kus (god), of herdsmen in Sumerian, Babylonian, and Akkadian mythology *Kus, B√´rzhit√´, Tirana municipality, Albania *Kus, Kashar, Kashar, Tirana municipality, Albania *Lake Ku≈ü, Turkey See also *Ku≈ü ","title":"Kus (disambiguation)"},{"id":"32463442","title":"Big FM Tamil Entertainment Awards"},{"id":"32463455","text":"Christianity is the largest religion practiced in Zimbabwe, accounted for more than 80% of the population.Inter Censal Demography Survey 2017 Report, Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency (2017) The arrival of Christianity dates back to the 16th century by Portuguese missionaries such as Fr.

It is estimated 85 percent of Zimbabweans claim to be Christians, with approximately 62 percent regularly attending church services.International Religious Freedom Report 2007: Zimbabwe. United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor (September 14, 2007). Christian faith plays a very important role in the organization of Zimbabwean society. Heads of the Christian Denominations in Zimbabwe is an association made up of some of the common church bodies; Evangelical Fellowship of Zimbabwe, the Zimbabwe Catholic Bishops' Conference, and the Zimbabwe Council of Churches. However, recent years saw a large increase in the number of new denominations: notably \\"Apostles\\" or \\"Mapostori\\". Most of these denominations derive their teachings from the bible and attach greater emphasis on prophecy, demonstration of power and fasting in the wilderness. Some reputable apostolic churches include Mugodhi, among others. Still, there are some \\"Apostles who disregard the Bible and believe in Messengers from God\\". There has been debate over the Western-formed churches including Anglican and Roman Catholic, over the truthfulness of the apostles' doctrine. While some apostles truly follow the Way of Christ, some violate bible principles through polygamy and false prophecy. In addition there has been a growing number of Christian Ministries, including Prophetic Healing and Deliverance and United Family International Church, who are also criticized for overemphasizing the prosperity gospel and giving- while increasing the wealth of the leaders. History Roman Catholic missionaries were the first to arrive in Zimbabwe. The first attempt to introduce Christianity to the Shona [tribe of Zimbabwe] was made by a Portuguese Jesuit missionary, Gon√ßalo da Silveira, at the court of the Monomotapa dynasty until he was murdered as a result of court intrigues in 1561.Marshall W. Murphree, Christianity and the Shona (London, England: The Athlone Press, 1969). Although at least a dozen Catholic churches were planted, they all disappeared by 1667, when Portugal's power was waning, leaving ‚Äúno discernible trace of Christianity.‚Äù This remained the situation until the movement of Protestant missions arrived in the nineteenth century.

M. Zvobgo. Gweru, Mambo Press, 1996. In 1799 Johannes Van der Kemp helped launching a missionary society called London Missionary Society (LMS). One of the LMS missionary who helped launch Protestant missions into Zimbabwe was Robert Moffat and his wife Mary. One of Moffat's greatest accomplishment for missions in Zimbabwe was his friendship with Mzilikazi, king of the Ndebele tribe. Moffat's son-in-law David Livingstone had several expeditions in Zimbabwe around 1859. Another LMS missionary named Charles Daniel Helm founded the southern Rhodesia Missionary Conference.Ecumenical Initiatives in Southern Rhodesia: A history of the southern Rhodesia Missionary Conference 1903-1945 (retrieved from www.scielo.org.za/pdf/she/v43n1/04.pdf) His sons Sam Helm and John Helm helped translate the New Testament of the Bible in the Karanga dialect of Shona, along with Andrew and Clini Louw of Dutch Reformed Mission Church.

It was released as a pilot of the proposed television series, and featured the voices of Sandy Duncan and Tony Randall. A second special was produced in 1985, Escape from Catrina.  Production   Plot  The story begins as the peaceful ponies of Dream Valley are attacked by monsters, led by Scorpan, who kidnap several ponies and take them away to Midnight Castle. Enraged, Firefly, a Pegasus pony, takes to the skies to try to find someone who can help them defeat Tirac, a centaur-like demon whose plan is to use these ponies to pull his Chariot of Darkness. On her way, she crashes into 12-year-old Megan's well and asks her for her help. Megan is at first reluctant to go but after being confronted by the monsters, she sets out with the ponies to rescue them. At Midnight Castle, Tirac has the smallest pony, Ember, taken to the dungeons, and uses the Rainbow of Darkness to turn the other three ponies Scorpan captured into dragons. He tells Scorpan to bring him a fourth pony by midnight, threatening to behead his friend, the baby dragon Spike. Megan, Firefly, and the ponies Applejack, Twilight, and Bow Tie go to see the Moochick, who has magic powers and might know how to defeat Tirac. On the way, Applejack falls off a bridge into the river and Megan jumps after her, from which they are rescued by the Sea Ponies, who tell them to call on them if they need help again. Megan and the ponies find the Moochick, who says that to defeat Tirac they must take away his Rainbow of Darkness, which gives him his power. He also gives them the Rainbow of Light, which can help defeat Tirac. Arriving at Midnight Castle, Megan and the ponies cross the moat of raging water with help from the Sea Ponies. Meanwhile, Scorpan fails to get a fourth pony for Tirac, who threatens Spike again. Scorpan releases Spike and Ember from the dungeons. Applejack is captured by Tirac, who turns her into a dragon. Scorpan enters, attacks Tirac's guards, and runs outside with Megan and the ponies. With four corrupted ponies, Tirac rides his Chariot of Darkness. Tirac defeats Scorpan, nearly killing him, while Megan rides Firefly and knocks the Rainbow of Darkness out of Tirac's hand. The ponies fight Tirac's guards over the Rainbow of Darkness, but in the end, Tirac gets it back. Megan unleashes the Rainbow of Light, which does nothing at first. Tirac uses the Rainbow of Darkness on the Rainbow of Light, which fights back, overpowers the Rainbow of Darkness, and destroys Tirac. Everything Tirac transformed with the Rainbow of Darkness is restored to its original state, including the ponies and Scorpan, whose original form is a prince.

The opening animated sequence with narrated voice-actor credits, as well as its end credits, were removed and replaced with the standard 1986 TV series opening/closing. Also omitted is the two and a half minute animated musical number \\"Little Piece of Rainbow\\", sung by Tony Randall. It aired at the end of the TV show's first season, in November 1986. A similar edit was done to the follow up 1985 TV special, \\"Escape from Katrina\\", and aired at the end of the second season.  Inspiration for Friendship Is Magic  Lauren Faust got much inspiration for My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic from the special, My Little Pony: Rescue From Midnight Castle (1984), and the 1986 television series. She gave similar personalities to the new generation of ponies from the older series and specials, making them live on for a new generation. Tirac, renamed as Tirek, also appears in the series as a major antagonist, introduced in the two-part season 4 finale \\"Twilight's Kingdom\\" with a cameo appearance by Scorpan in the flashback sequence.

The band's core members are Shir Deutch, Opher Vishnia and Shai Yallin. The band describes its musical style on its official website as \\"combining the emotional with the intellectual\\", and proclaims itself as \\"Israel's first alt- prog-rock band to be formed on the web\\". Solstice Coil has released three albums, A Prescription for Paper Cuts (2005), Natural Causes (2011) and Commute (2015). Natural Causes had been picked up by the Orlando-based progressive rock label Melodic Revolution Records and Commute was released on Taklit Music, Subterranean Masquerade guitarist Tomer Pink's new label. On July 5, 2011, Solstice Coil released a parody of Dream Theater to YouTube titled \\"The Natural Causes Carries On\\", spoofing Dream Theater's \\"The Spirit Carries On\\" documentary about their search to replace founding member and drummer Mike Portnoy. The video became immensely popular among Dream Theater fans and was subsequently promoted by guitarist John Petrucci on his official Facebook and Twitter accounts. Dream Theater keyboardist Jordan Rudess has also given his seal of approval, stating the video was \\"very funny\\". On July 19, 2011, during Dream Theater's second concert in Israel, the parody was screened before thousands of fans, moments before Dream Theater took the stage.  History  Solstice Coil was established in late-2001 with Shir Deutch on vocals and guitars, Opher Vishnia on lead guitar, Uri Goldberg on drums and Guy Matityahu on bass guitar. During the first years of its existence, the band played a mix of Hebrew and English songs, mostly influenced by brit-pop and brit-rock. After going through several line-up changes, the band released its debut album, A Prescription For Paper Cuts on September 21, 2005 with bassist Diego Olschansky and keyboard player Shai Yallin; A self-produced effort, the album was mostly recorded, edited and mixed by Yallin at his home studio. Paper Cuts received positive reviews from music websites and magazines from around the world in Hebrew, English, Dutch Italian, French and German. In Israel, it received a favorable review on Mitkadem, biggest archive of progressive rock in the Hebrew language. It was named \\"Album of the month\\" on German website Babyblaue Seiten and on Brazilian website progressiverockbr.http://www.progressiverockbr.com/ Following a review and an interview published on Belgian progressive rock magazine Prog-r√©siste, the band was invited to perform at an annual progressive festival held at the Spirit of 66‚Äô club in Belgium in 2006. The Belgian tour was covered by Israeli media In 2007, the band experienced more personnel changes and from then on included Deutch, Vishnia and Yallin as well as Yaniv Shalev on bass guitar and Yatziv Caspi on drums. This line-up would go on to work on the band's next album, Natural Causes, which was released on June 21, 2011 through Orlando- based label Melodic Revolution Records, with album art by digital artist Vitaly S. Alexius. 2012 saw the band through another lineup change, with Drummer Yatziv Caspi and bassist Yaniv Shalev replaced respectively with Yakir Fitousi and Mihael Galperin. Later that year, the band went on a two-week tour of India, culminating in a performance at the NH7 Weekender festival alongside, among others, Megadeth. Following the tour, the band began work on their third effort, Commute, which was released on June 21, 2015 on Taklit Music.  Style and influences  Solstice Coil's music is a cross-genre of progressive rock, alternative rock and progressive metal. The band members state mutual influences by artists such as Radiohead, Muse, Porcupine Tree, Dream Theater, King Crimson, Genesis and The Mars Volta. The music is characterised by complex structures, variable song lengths, unorthodox time signatures, multi-layered arrangements and wide range male vocals. The songs are often melancholic and dark, while the lyrics tend to be metaphorical and multi-faceted.

He established Khanqah for promotion and propagation of Quadria Order. He was a descendant of Ghausul Azam. His shrine is a centre of pilgrims in Midnapore.  Birth  Syed Shah Mehr Ali Alquadri Al Baghdadi commonly known as \\"Syedena Aala Huzur\\" a descendant of Syedena Ghausul Azam was born in 1808 A.D/1223 A.H at Khanqah Sharif, Mia Mohallah in the town of Midnapore now situated in the district of West Midnapore of West Bengal. He was the son of Syedena Syed Shah Tufail Ali Alquadri Al Baghdadi one of the most venerated saints of Bengal.Mazakera-i-Qutb-ul-Alamin,M.Ziaur Rahman Shahkupuri, Kolkata,1310 Hijri His mother Bibi Niamat un Nesa was herself a saintly lady of her age. The grandfather of \\"Syedena Aala Huzur\\", is shaik abdul qudari jelani for preaching Quadria order, migrated from the city of Baghdad to the remote town of Mangalkot in the district of Bardhaman in Bengal. Education From his childhood \\"Syedena Aala Huzur\\" was put to the path of mortification and devotion. He passed most of his time in pursuit of learning, observance of religious rites and performance of spiritual exercise. He was a man of versatile genius and God gifted talents. Within a short span of time he acquired mastery over the commentaries of the Quran, the hadith of Muhammad, the principle of Islamic law and all sorts of religious sciences.Gulistan-i-Quadri, Syed Mahbub Murshed, Kolkata,1946, pg 42 He was not only a great scholar but also an accomplished Sufi poet. He was the master of Arabic and Persian language. He could speak Arabic fluently as it was his mother tongue and quote entire verses of Persian mystic poets.Syedena Ghausul Azam, Syed Abdus Salik, Kolkata, pg 118,1939 After acquiring mastery over different branches of religious sciences, he started delivering sermons on Sufism and Islamic tenets. Soon his fame spread far and wide. People from various places flocked in great numbers to acquire religious and esoteric grace from him. Even from Arabia and Persia some persons came to him with a view to obtain his grace. Thus it can be said without doubt that Syedena Aala Huzur s‚Äô fame spread throughout the Islamic world and his contribution in making the Quadria order popular in Bengal was enormous. In 1267 A.H he established a Madrasah at Midnapore. This Madrasah is still present in the name of ‚ÄòSuhrawardia Mehria Islamia High Madrasah‚Äô. Syedena Aala Huzur also built a Khanqah in Midnapore town. In those days this Khanqah became the centre of Islamic teachings. The needy people were provided food and medical assistance there. There is a famous incident of Syedena Aala Huzur that once a person posing himself as a religious scholar came from an upcountry with a cart loaded with books to his Khanqah. The person posed a lot of knotty and difficult questions for him to solve. The discussion that took place lasted for several days and nights with occasional intervals for prayers, meals and other necessities for life. Though the problems discussed where of a religious character, but the person introduced questions of philosophy, logic and other sciences into discussion. The answers which Aala Huzur gave to those questions indicated the depth of his knowledge. The person was completely defeated in discussion and he soon left Aala Huzur on some flimsy pretext.  Meditation  After the demise of his father \\"Syedena Aala Huzur\\" proceeded towards Midnapore. At the outskirt of the town in the lonely forest inhabited by ravenous beasts and harmful animals he sat in deep meditation of the Almighty Allah. At the darkness of the night in the lonely forest his voice would echo with the recitation of the name of Allah. With less food and sleep he passed his days in this manner till he reached the age of thirty. For years he kept fast (excluding the forbidden days) when he would take only a banana in the evening as his main diet.Gulistan,pg 41 After undergoing all sorts of spiritual exercise and accomplishing different stages he attained the stage of Fanafillah. He became the Qutub of his time.  Marriage  He married a pious lady named Syeda Ummul Barkat Khatun Fatima Saniya. She was from the descendant of Syed Isa Rizvi, a great saint who came from Bukhara and settled at Payardanga in the district of Midnapore.Walin Mursheda, Syed Shah Wali Murshed Alquadri, fol 49 Although married and entangled with social duties Syedena Aala Huzur continued his spiritual exercise of austerity and mortification.  Descendants  Syedena Aala Huzur had three sons and two daughters. All of his three sons were venerated saints of high rank. Syed Shah Murshed Ali Alquadri Al Baghdadi also known as ‚ÄòHuzur Purnur‚Äô was the eldest son and Sajjada nashin of Aala Huzur. He was an accomplished scholar and a unique Sufi poet. His diwan is regarded as one of the most sacred books on Sufism.Gulistan,pg. 70 The second son Syed Shah Ali Murshed Alquadri Al Baghdadi was also a saint and his shrine is at Payardanga. The youngest son Syed Shah Wali Murshed Alquadri Al Baghdadi also known as ‚ÄòQutb ul Waqt‚Äô is counted among the greatest saints of his time. He too was a great writer and Sufi poet. He wrote many books among them, ‚ÄòWalin Mursheda‚Äô is considered to be the most authentic book on Sufism dealing with the history of Quadria order in Bengal. The names of daughters were Syeda Fatimatul Kobra and Syeda Fatimatus Soghra. Syedena Aala Huzur lived for sixty years. His demise took place on 16th Muharram 1285 A.H/ 1868 A.D at his Khanqah.

Formerly the episcopal seat of the Diocese of Ruvo, it is now a co-cathedral in the Diocese of Molfetta-Ruvo-Giovinazzo-Terlizzi. The building is an important example of late Apulian Romanesque architecture, built between the 12th and 13th centuries, with several later alterations. Description The current exterior is the result of early 20th-century restoration works which removed the Baroque additions. The church has a sloped fa√ßade with three portals: the central and larger one, flanked by two columns standing on lions and surmounted by griphons, has internal reliefs which were once part of an earlier construction. They depict \\"Christ with the Twelve Apostles\\", other scenes of the Redeemer's life and plant motifs. The smaller ones, at the sides, have a simpler shape, with two semi-columns supporting ogival arches; they also belonged to previous buildings. Above the portal is a double mullioned window with a bas-relief of the \\"Archangel Michael Defeating the Devil\\", and above it, a 16th-century rose window with twelve radiating columns. This is in turn surmounted by the Sedente (\\"Sitting One\\"), an enigmatic figure which has been variously identified as Robert III of Loritello (who funded the construction), while at the top of fa√ßade is a statue of the Redeemer. The bell tower, in a different style, most likely formed part of the medieval city's walls. The interior is divided into a nave and two aisles, ending into three apses, with an orthogonal transept. The nave, like the transept, features a trussed ceiling and, at its sides, has a fake passageway (matroneum) under which are corbels with human, animal or bestial depictions. It stands on two rows of piers, which are each different from another. Some are cruciform, while others are squared; some capitals are sculpted with elements taken from the Christian or medieval mythology, while others feature simpler plant or abstract motifs. The aisles are cross vaulted. At the end of the nave is a 19th-century ciborium, inspired by that in the Basilica of San Nicola at Bari. Of the chapels added in Baroque or later styles, only two survive: the Chapel of the Sacred Heart (19th-century) and the Chapel of the Holy Sacrament. Artworks include the wooden statue of Saint Blaise, Ruvo's patron saint (16th-century), the silver relic case of the same saint, a panel of the Virgin of Constantinople and a 16th-century wooden crucifix. There are also traces of frescoes, executed by Marco Pino's workshop, depicting the Flagellation of Christ. The church's subterranean rooms include the remains of a Palaeo-Christian church (5th-6th centuries) and Roman and Peucetian tombs. Gallery File:S03 06 01 026 image 3252.jpg|1895.

It currently includes primary and secondary education.  History  The school is built on the location of a cloister, the \\"Sint Barbaraklooster in Jerusalem\\". The cloister was founded in 1420 for Augustinian nuns, closed in 1783 by order of Joseph II, briefly reopened but closed again during the French Revolutionary War. In 1814 the building near the Ketelvest housed a secondary school, but that was closed in 1819 by order of William I who had opened an atheneum in the nearby buildings of the old Baudelo Abbey. In 1833, after the Belgian Revolution of 1830 the Bishop of Ghent, Jan Frans Van De Velde, gave the school to the Jesuits. The first students graduated in 1836. A school church was inaugurated on 6 November 1858. Maurice Maeterlinck, who was sent there in 1874 (then aged 14) disliked the fact that in Sainte-Barbe works of the French Romantics were scorned and only plays on religious subjects were permitted. His experiences at this school influenced his distaste for the Catholic Church and organized religion.Bettina Knapp, Maurice Maeterlinck, (Thackery Publishers: Boston, 1975), 22-3.  Program  Though located in a Dutch-speaking Flemish city, the language of instruction at Sint- Barbaracollege was French, and as such it was considered in the 19th and early 20th Century as instilling a French cultural identity in its young Flemish pupils ‚Äì though some of them later rebelled against this identity, such as Joris Van Severen. As of 2011, the Sint-Barbaracollege consists of K through 12: primary secondary education. Improvements since 2014 made way for a spacious new sports hall. In 2017 the school extended its Wi-Fi capability and increased the number of tablets available to students. There is an active parents' group which raises money for school improvements. The school persists in striving to implement and update the principles of Jesuit pedagogy in dialogue with Christian values as it addresses the challenges of a secularized and globalized society.

First appearing in the 1883 novel Peck's Bad Boy and His Pa, the Bad Boy has appeared in numerous print, stage, and film adaptations. The character is portrayed as a mischievous prankster, and the phrase \\"Peck's bad boy\\" has entered the language to refer to anyone whose mischievous or bad behavior leads to annoyance or embarrassment. Described as \\"a vicious little swaggerer\\" and \\"no more than a callous brute\\", Hennery's antics were more mean-spirited than those of earlier boyhood characters like Huckleberry Finn, and modern criticism views the violence and racism in the original stories as objectionable or politically incorrect. The inspiration for Hennery‚Äîthe Bad Boy‚Äîcame from Edward James Watson, who was a telegraph messenger boy that Peck met in the early 1880s. Apparently Watson thought up many of the stories used by Peck. Mr Watson had in his possession a letter from Peck \\"To my friend E. J.

It is written by British author Gideon Defoe and was published starting in 2004 by Weidenfeld & Nicolson. The fifth book The Pirates! in an Adventure with the Romantics was released in 2012, and was published by Bloomsbury Publishing. Books # The Pirates!

He is arrogant, na√Øve, and mostly incompetent as a pirate and as a sea captain, to the point of being completely unaware of how to sail a ship. The few times he attempts to capture and loot ships, he fails in spectacular fashion. Instead, he and his pirate crew spend most of their time having \\"adventures,\\" which always involve famous historical and/or literary figures. In spite of his blundering, the Pirate Captain is ultimately well-meaning, and very much respected by his crew. He is frequently described as \\"all teeth and curls, but with a pleasant, open face,\\" and is proud of his luxuriant beard. * The Pirate with a Scarf, the Pirate Captain's trustworthy, logical second-in-command, who serves as a straight man for his antics. It is strongly implied that he does most of the actual work of sailing the ship. Despite occasionally chafing at his sidekick role, the Pirate with a Scarf is unfailingly loyal to the Captain. * Jennifer, a Victorian lady who joins the pirate crew during _An Adventure With Scientists._ * The Pirate in Red, a sarcastic, world-weary pirate who frequently makes biting remarks about the Pirate Captain and other crew members. * The Pirate in Green, described as an \\"everyman type\\" by the Pirate Captain. * The Albino Pirate, whom the Captain calls the ship's \\"happy idiot.\\" * Various other pirates described by the Captain as mostly interchangeable. These include the Pirate with Gout, the Pirate with Bedroom Eyes, the Pirate with a Hook for a Hand, the Pirate from the Bronx, and others. Historical Characters The Pirates! In An Adventure With Scientists * Charles Darwin, a friendly naturalist who is attempting to prove his theory of evolution by exhibiting an educated monkey named \\"Mr. Bobo the Man-Panzee.\\" He appears in _An Adventure With Scientists._ * Robert FitzRoy, captain of the HMS Beagle. The Pirates! In An Adventure With Whalers * Captain Ahab, the fictional character from Moby-Dick, who is obsessed with hunting down his nemesis, the White Whale. The Pirates! In An Adventure With Communists * Karl Marx, philosopher and founder of Communism, who is mistaken for the Pirate Captain due to his similarly luxuriant beard. * Friedrich Engels, Marx's frequent collaborator, appears as his put-upon sidekick who empathizes with the Pirate with a Scarf. * Richard Wagner, composer of operas, who spearheads a plot to discredit Communism. * Friedrich Nietzsche, who the book erroneously identifies as the founder of Fascism. The fictionalized version of Nietzsche wears a large mechanical exoskeleton, and plots to take over Europe so he can get a girlfriend. The Pirates! In An Adventure With Napoleon * Napoleon Bonaparte, a general from Revolutionary France, who butts heads with the Pirate Captain when they both retire to St. Helena at the same time. The Pirates! In An Adventure With Romantics * Mary Shelley, author of Frankenstein. Mary is a love interest for the Pirate Captain, who bonds with her over their shared love of monsters. * Percy Bysshe Shelley, Mary's fiance, an educated, pretentious Romantic poet. * Lord Byron, an extremely loud and sex-crazed Romantic poet. * Charles Babbage, a highly logical inventor who can't stand Romanticism. Other Characters * Black Bellamy, the Pirate Captain's arch-nemesis. * Cutlass Liz, owner of a used-boat store. * The Pirate King Film adaptation Aardman Animations in partnership with Sony Pictures Animation loosely adapted The Pirates! in an Adventure with Scientists into a 3D stop-motion animated film internationally titled The Pirates! Band of Misfits. Released on 28 March 2012, and directed by Peter Lord, the film features the voices of Hugh Grant, Martin Freeman, David Tennant, Salma Hayek, Jeremy Piven, and Imelda Staunton.

(formerly Our Courts) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization in the United States that provides educational online games and lesson plans to promote civics education and encourage students to become active citizens. iCivics was founded in 2008 by retired Supreme Court of the United States Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. iCivics‚Äôs stated mission is to ‚Äúensure every student receives a high-quality civic education, and becomes engaged in ‚Äì and beyond ‚Äì the classroom.‚Äù iCivics, inc. is supported by private donations and grants and had annual expenses of $2.2 million in 2015. Among the top contributors were the Gates Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation.iCivics, Inc. (2016). iCivics Annual Report 2015. Retrieved from https://www.icivics.org/sites/default/files/annual_report_2015.pdf In the same year, iCivics served more than 85,000 educators and 3 million students, including half of all middle school social studies classrooms in America. History Justice O‚ÄôConnor developed the Our Courts project in partnership with Georgetown University Law School and Arizona State University. In March 2009, Justice O'Connor went on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart to promote Our Courts and civics education. Our Courts added Supreme Decision and Do I Have A Right? to the website in August 2009. It was incorporated as iCivics, inc. in May 2010 as the variety of content and users began to expand more rapidly. A more comprehensive website was launched, supplementing the gaming modules with classroom lessons on the branches of government. Above The Law sponsored a Do I Have A Right? challenge in 2010. Justice O'Connor was the keynote speaker at Games for Change in 2010, and iCivics was featured at the Games for Change conference in New York in 2011. The Washington Post Editorial Board highlighted the shortcomings of traditional civics education, and the efforts of iCivics. In 2011 the website added seven games and 16 lesson plans, and had over 700,000 unique visitors.iCivics, Inc. (2012). Annual Report 2011. Retrieved from www.guidestar.org/ViewEdoc.aspx?eDocId=2772999&approved;=True By 2013 it was the most widely adopted civics curriculum in America. Currently, the governing board of iCivics includes O‚ÄôConnor as well as current Justice Sonia Sotomayor and the Honorable Robert Henry, president of Oklahoma City University. The executive director of iCivics is Louise Dub√©, previously Managing Director of Digital Learning at WGBH. Mission Justice O‚ÄôConnor initially envisioned Our Courts as a response to a perceived misunderstanding of the justice system in America. As keynote speaker at the NCSS annual conference in 2007, she noted ‚Äúthat while two-thirds of Americans know at least two judges on FOX Television‚Äôs ‚ÄòAmerican Idol‚Äô reality program, less than one in 10 can name the Chief Justice of the United States.‚Äù At present, ourcourts.org maintains this mission, but iCivics has a broader mission incorporating education on the legislative and executive branches of government as well as civics at a local level. The organization focuses on broadly improving civics education but also on closing the civics education gap. O'Connor saw the state of civics education as a result of the failure of traditional education methods, as well as funding cuts and lower graduation requirements imposed by the No Child Left Behind Act. Our Courts collaborator James Gee, a professor of literacy at Arizona State University, convinced her that educational games were the key to civics education, due to their capacity to teach problem solving. iCivics games have been evaluated for their educational effectiveness in a handful of research studies. Branches of Power was shown to be both engaging and educational for a majority of students in a test group.Lewis, Carrie, Jason Lancaster, Wilhelmina Savenye, and Nancy Haas. \\"A Formative Evaluation of the Balance of Power Game and Curriculum.\\" The Journal of Applied Instructional Design 3, no. 3 (December 2013): 5-16. A significant number of students also play the games again at home, greatly increasing absorption of concepts and improving test scores. The general iCivics curriculum has been shown to be an effective mechanism for education on civics topics as measured by scores on the US citizenship test. It was particularly effective among younger students in grades 4-6 and less effective among high school seniors. The interactive writing exercise Drafting Board also improved persuasive writing skills among 8th graders. The organization is currently working on extending its curriculum to high school and reaching more high school educators. It currently serves one in four high school government and history teachers. Content iCivics hosts lesson plans, games, online workshops and other materials for teachers and students of American civics. All online materials are free to registered users.

Dreyer GmbH & Co. KG (also known as:Amazone) is a German manufacturer of Agricultural machinery and municipal machinery. The headquarters and main plant of the company was founded in 1883 by Heinrich Dreyer and is in Hasbergen-Gaste near Osnabr√ºck. Amazone produces a wide range of products including fertilizer spreaders, sprayers, seed drills, and tillage machinery. The logo is an Amazon woman riding a horse. Agricultural machinery uses an orange logo and the machinery is green and orange. The municipal machinery uses a green logo, and the machinery is tan with green. History of the Name Heinrich Dreyer wanted to give a name to his most successful machine. He asked a friend, a teacher in Gaste, what he thought. The friend told Heinrich that his machine was beautiful and very strong on the market. These two attributes of beauty and strength reminded him of an Amazon. This is a heroine in Greek mythology confident, very strong and beautiful.Die AMAZONE- Chronik History of the Company Mrs. Dreyer in 1902 as the first Amazone model. Heinrich Dreyer founded Amazone in 1883, though the Dreyer family had been involved in the manufacture of agricultural machines earlier. The first machines brought to production were grain cleaning machines, later plow cultivators, potato sorters and in 1915 the first fertilizer spreader was put on the market. Early on Dreyer began exporting of his machinery; in 1906 the first grain cleaning machines were sold in Valpara√≠so, Chile. He substantiated this with his slogan: \\"We must go out to the world\\".125 years Amazonen In 1942, the first potato harvesters were introduced to the market and in 1949 the seed drill machines and 1959, a manure spreader. In the 1960s, the two- disc ZA fertilizer spreaders and D4 seed drills were very successful, which helped Amazone to reach market leadership at this time. In 1967 the company entered into tillage and there developed the first Amazone manufactured PTO driven tillage equipment that could be used with a drill. The harrow and rotary cultivator were also included into the product range. Later, after the German reunification, a variety of passive soil-working machines were added to the market. Amazone BoniRob Field robot In 2008, the Amazone establishment exceeded expectations because for the first time they added interns and other young workers to their workforce. 2009 saw the opening of an extension of the central spare parts warehouse in Hasbergen, which doubled the workflow capacity for spare parts supply by Amazone. That same year, Amazone took over a new manufacturing site for production of large seeders in Hude and began with their production site in Leeden near Tecklenburg with the production of self-propelled sprayer, the Pantera. In addition, the BoniRob, an autonomous field robot for the individual plant-based experimental research, was presented that was developed in cooperation with the University of Applied Sciences Osnabr√ºck, the Robert Bosch GmbH as well as other partners. Present In January 2010, a new fertilizer spreader test hall was opened in Hasbergen-Gaste. This has enabled the company to complete fertilizer spreading tests with a working width of up to 72 meters (approximately 235 feet) as well as to study new types of fertilizers regarding their mass and scattering properties. This information can then quickly be added to the Amazone fertilizer database so when customers ask how their machine should be set, the answer is easily acquired. This test hall is state-of-the-art and a unique feature for a mid-sized company; no other manufacturer has such a building. After the huge success at the first Amatechnica - Amazone field day in May 2005, this event was repeated in September 2010. Customers and prospective customers from around the world were shown demonstrations of new and long- standing agricultural machinery. In February 2011, Amazone sold the warehouse technology division to a newly formed company.Amazone Multipurpose storage halls sold to AM Technik GmbH Management Heinrich Dreyer, the original founder of Amazone, had two sons. It was decided that each of his sons would receive half ownership of the company, but only one of their children would be allowed to carry on the company. Amazone is now in its fourth generation with Christian Dreyer, son of Klaus Dreyer, and Justus Dreyer, son of (SAA Samara) Heinz Dreyer. Both fathers remain active at Amazone. The number of employees is approximately 1700. Amazone exports to over 70 countries, the export share is 75% (in 2012). Amazone's customers are farmers, agricultural contractors, municipalities and related areas. Manufacturing Plants Amazone headquarters in Hasbergen-Gaste near Osnabr√ºck, Germany.

He is the author of Egypt ‚Äì The elusive Arab Spring, as well as the founder and Chairman of the British Arab Network.  Early life and education  Wafik Moustafa was born in Cairo, Egypt and has lived most of his adult life in Britain. He attended Primary School at Shimabara Sharqiya Preparatory School in Cairo, also studying at secondary school in the city. He was politically active in the student union. A Muslim, Moustafa studied medicine at Cairo University, achieving an MB BcH in 1974, and at Edinburgh and Glasgow Universities, gaining an LRCP LRCS in 1981. He is fluent in English and classical Arabic. His father was Moustafa M.M. Sheikh Yussef Shama, and his mother was Zahya O'mara. His brother Mohammad is a chartered accountant and MD of Technomarble (Egypt). He also served as a treasurer of the Ghad secular party. His brother Morsi is a county court judge. Morsi stood for Egyptian parliamentary elections against the speaker of Egyptian assembly; it was widely believed that the voting was rigged in favour of the speaker who is currently in prison for corruption charges. Morsi has also served as a deputy leader of the Ghad secular party. His Brother Moustafa is a chemistry and physics lecturer. The family has donated the first school to Kfr Nagah (an ancient village in Delta), and also renovated the main mosque. They also recently provided the land and building material for a new school.  Professional career  Moustafa set up his own practice in Nottinghamshire in 1982. He was appointed Honorary Lecturer at Sheffield University Medical School in 1986. He is currently a practicing NHS GP serving the community in West London at ATMC (Acton Town Medical Centre). He was proactive in GP Fundholding and was in charge of the Orthopaedic service in Bassetlaw. He has also served as a medical assessor for the Disability Living Allowance Advisory Board (DLAAB), which gave him a holistic insight into people living with disabilities. He is a staunch supporter of NHS as a provider of free medical care at the point of delivery. He has contributed to public health issues on Arabic-speaking media, notably Swine flu and Hepatitis C, which is endemic in certain parts of the Middle East. He also spoke against female genital mutilation, which is still practiced in certain predominantly Islamic countries. In 2008, Dr. Moustafa received The British Community Honours Award for his work and dedication to community service, presented at the House of Lords by Eric Pickles MP. London-based Themedicalmagazine nominated Moustafa as the personality of the year for 2012. In May 2014, the English-Arabic London based publication The Arab Telegraph recognised the social and political work of Moustafa for the Arab communities over the past 25 years by highlighting his activities inside and outside the UK. A plaque of appreciation has been presented to Moustafa in recognition of his outstanding achievements, contributions to world peace, and deep commitment to the service of society, when he participated at the WORLD Alliance of Religions Peace Summit in Seoul, Korea in September 2014. BBC Radio Arabic Service broadcast a two-hour special programme in August 2014 about Moustafa's career, social and political activities in the UK, including discussion about his book Egypt the Elusive Arab Spring.  Political activities  Moustafa was the first Egyptian-born British national to stand for UK Parliament general elections, as a Conservative candidate for Bootle in Sefton, Merseyside in 2005. In this traditionally safe Labour seat, he came a distant third behind the Liberal Democrats. Moustafa also founded the Conservative Arab Network (CAN). In 2011, Moustafa led a parliamentary delegation to Cairo, the first of its kind made up of Lords, MPs and senior political figures. The delegation met with the Supreme Military Council, The Grand Sheikh of Azhar, and other political figures and leaders from a variety of political, youth and social organisations. The purpose of the visit was to find ways to engage with Egypt during their time of challenge and major crisis, with a view to encourage democracy and social change. The visit gave British politicians a chance to directly engage with Egyptians at many levels of society. Work is currently being undertaken on a similar parliamentary delegation to Tunisia and other Arab countries in the near future. Moustafa has made similar trips to Tunisia, Lebanon, Israel, West Bank and Golan Heights. He supported the Arab Spring throughout, believing it is a positive step to build free and fair Arab societies. In May 2015, he visited the United Nations in New York for meetings with senior diplomats and officials about critical Middle East issues. Moustafa moderated at a panel on The Role of Parliaments for Building Peaceful and Inclusive Societies and Combating Violent extremism at United Nations Headquarters in New York on 21 July 2016. In January 2016, Moustafa was a key speaker at the Knesset (Parliament) of Israel in Jerusalem at the Forum for \\"Building a Culture of Peace in the Middle East and the Global Arena\\", emphasising the role of public diplomacy, which plays a key role in facilitating the exchange of ideas, values and traditions through interaction between different communities. \\"Cultural exchange gives us the chance to appreciate points of communality and where there are differences to understand the motivations and human aspects that underlie them,\\" Moustafa said. \\"I am a big believer in the value and importance of cross cultural activity and interfaith dialogue in supporting reconciliation and building world peace.\\" At the International Symposium on Cultural Diplomacy and Religion 2014, \\"The Promotion of World Peace through Inter-Faith Dialogue & the Unity of Faiths\\" (Rome, Italy; 31 March ‚Äì 3 April 2014), he said, \\"Peace can be achieved that people learn the necessity to accept one another by tolerance and working for the common good of humanity.\\" In March 2014, Moustafa was a speaker at the UN-endorsed global summit on world peace at the United Nations Headquarters, New York. He was a participant at the US Congress in Washington DC and the Italian Senate in Rome. He also attended and addressed the conferences for Cultural Diplomacy ‚Äì Interfaith, The Levant Initiative for Global Peace and The Inter-Parliamentary Coalition for Global Ethics at the United Nations. He was a speaker at the Conference organised by the Institute for Cultural Diplomacy, \\"The Promotion of World Peace through Inter-Faith Dialogue\\" held in Rome at \\"Societa Italiana per la organizzazione Internazionale\\" (SIOI). Moustafa was a keynote speaker at the inter-Parliamentary Coalition for Global Ethics at the United Nations on 24 March 2014. In July 2014, Moustafa delivered a keynote speech at the Inter- Parliamentary Coalition for Global Ethics conference (IPCGE) held at UNESCO HQ in Paris. His theme message was \\"We have to think culture of peace to achieve global harmony\\". In May 2015, as Chairman of the British Arab Network and trustee of IPCGE, he made a speech about promoting dialogue understanding and world peace at the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles to an international audience. In March 2019, Moustafa gave a keynote speech at \\"The Levant Initiative for World Peace\\" chaired by President Emil Constantinescu of Romania (fr) at the Italian Senate in Rome, where he emphasised the importance of cross cultural activity and interfaith dialogue in supporting reconciliation and building world peace. \\"Antisemitism is a scourge and needs to be addressed as poor education lies at the core of such serious prejudices... cultural diplomacy gives us a deep sense of humanity and a chance to appreciate and shares areas of commonality\\", he said.  Arab spring  A committed campaigner, Moustafa tirelessly advocates in the interest of immigrant and minority groups. He strives to encourage British Arabs to enter into mainstream British society. Through his work as an advocate for the British Arab community, he has argued for improved integration and assimilation into mainstream society of minority groups. He is a passionate believer in religious tolerance and equal rights for women; however, he is a supporter of the principles of secular politics and endorses a greater role for personal responsibility in a cohesive society. Moustafa has chaired Egyptian and Arab organisations that have furthered his knowledge and practical experience of Arab issues in the UK and the Arab world. He sees the Arab Spring as a defining moment against decades of tyranny and domestic injustice: \\"it has on one hand presented the people in each Arab country with an extraordinary set of opportunities, and on the other hand with challenges and threats. The main concern it has been leaderless and at times has no clear direction, with the possibility of the political vacuum would be occupied by the wrong elements rather than merit and the good. The second fear it is the leaderless nature of the uprising and the lack of a clear direction. The education and media system are badly politicised with structural defectiveness, that needs an urgent overhauling by using help from experts from Europe and US.\\" Moustafa believes that Egypt, with the right support, can play a pivotal role by setting the pace for reform within the Arab nations. However, he believes that the literal application of European secularism would be hard to achieve, as the Arab world did not experience a period of European- style renaissance, relating in particular to the fiercely independent universities of thirteenth-century Europe. He sees that the Arab world needs to take a giant leap to bridge the current cultural deficit. Moustafa contributed to the Arab Spring debate with dozens of interviews, debates, conferences and two fact-finding trips to Egypt. He has also been involved with campaigning for respecting the human rights of the Ahwazi Arabs in Iran, by protecting their culture and traditional heritage. He was a key guest speaker at a House of Commons event with Robert Buckland MP, and other senior members of the Ahwazi Arab Solidarity Network.  Religious views  Moustafa was brought up as a Sunni Muslim from a conservative background, and believes in dialogue with different faiths: \\"Egyptian Sunni Islam is unique for it being influenced by Shia'a doctorine of north Africa. Religion has played a central role in the life and politics in the Middle East over the past 30 years\\". He believes that the \\"theological establishment is in an urgent need to evolve\\": the current conflicting and controversial Islamic teaching ended up producing extreme radicals and violence, however small in numbers, that has led to a negative perception of a great religion. Moustafa, over several TV Interviews and public debates, has argued for a 'Fifth School of thought ‚Äì Ijtehad' that was arguably started a century ago by Islamic Reformer the Grand Mufti of Egypt Mohamed Abdu, saying: \\"Islam needs to interconnect with all the people and religions\\" of the world to spread peace and harmony. Moustafa believes in the importance of respecting the personal space of one's understanding and practicing of religion; as a Muslim, he has the conviction that the Kemal Atat√ºrk model in Turkey post-WWI is probably the best political framework for the Arab world to adopt for modernity and social-political reform. According to Atat√ºrk, \\"The religion of Islam will be elevated if it will cease to be a political instrument\\".  Author  Building on his earlier book, Egypt ‚Äì The elusive Arab Spring, Moustafa presented a new and updated history of Egypt in Egypt ‚Äì A Nation in Crisis. It covers the political development in Egypt up until September 2016. The book was discussed on Al- Jazeera during an interview with Moustafa.. On the third anniversary of the Arab Spring in Egypt, Moustafa published a book with a foreword by renowned journalist of the Times, Michael Binyon and published by Gilgamesh in London. Egypt ‚Äì The Elusive Arab Spring was launched in Rome at the Italian parliament in April 2014, where European politicians, including the former Spanish Prime Minister, the Italian Foreign Minister, presidents of Croatia and Iceland and Italian Senators were present. The UK launch of the book was held at Royal United Services Institute in Whitehall, London.

A state and national representative versatile back, he played twenty-four matches for Australia, once as captain. His national representative career spanned a ten-year period during which time he made two grande Wallaby tours to the Home Nations and numerous appearances against New Zealand and South Africa. Early life A grazier's son born in Wagga Wagga, New South Wales Lenehan was sent to Sydney to school at Riverview.Howell, Max (2005) Born to Lead ‚Äì Wallaby Test Captains, Celebrity Books, Auckland NZ. pp. 179‚Äì181. He was a schoolboy hurdler of some note at the GPS athletics level. After school his rugby career continued with the Wagga Wagga Waratahs and the Narrandera Rugby Club. Representative rugby career Lenehan was a tremendous left-foot punt kicker of the ball and is said to have regularly kicked the ball 75 m in matches. He was an excellent goal-kicker and a punishing defender who used his full 14 stone playing weight to hit opponents ferociously. His potential was noticed at school by national coach Alan Roper, who also coached at Riverview. At 19 years of age with only some school and country rugby behind him, he was trialled and selected in the squad for the Wallabies 1957‚Äì58 Australia rugby union tour of Britain, Ireland and France. His eight-month tour was a dream representative debut. His test debut was made against Wales and he played in four of the five tests of the tour and in thirty-two of the total forty-one games. He was the leading point scorer (114 points) and leading try scorer (13). He caused some controversy in the 3rd test of the tour ‚Äì that against England at Twickenham when he knocked England's Peter Thompson out cold in a tackle that some of the crowd felt was late and cynical. He was booed by the Twickenham crowd as he had been similarly by the crowd in the tour match against Swansea RFC three weeks earlier. In a tour which was not successful for the Wallabies (winning nil from five tests and only winning 22 of the total 41 matches) Lenehan's performances were strong and he returned to Australian with his playing reputation enhanced. In 1958 he made representative appearances for New South Wales and Australia against the visiting New Zealand Maori and that same year embarked on a tour of New Zealand where he played in two tour matches but was prevented from any test appearances due to injury. In 1959 he played for Australia in both tests against the visiting British Lions as well as in state and regional representative teams that met them. In 1961 he made his first tour to South Africa playing in five of the six possible tour matches including both tests against the Springboks. That year he played at fullback in the one-off Sydney test against France. In 1962 he was honoured with the national captaincy in the second test against the All Blacks in Sydney. He would have captained the side in the first test was kept out by injury and that honour went to Peter Johnson. On the tour to New Zealand that same year he was the squad's vice-captain with John Thornett commencing his leadership ascendancy at that time. Lenehan played in nine of the thirteen matches, including all three tests and captained the side in a mid-week tour game. Injury stopped him making any representative appearances in 1963 and he was sent home from a tour squad bound for South Africa with a knee problem. In 1965 he returned to the national scene for two tests against the Springboks which Australia won. His devastating defensive capabilities saw him named for the 1966‚Äì67 Australia rugby union tour of Britain, Ireland and France. Along with Tony Miller he became at that time, one of only two Australian players after Nicholas Shehadie to make his second \\"grande tour\\" since till that point Wallaby tours to the British Isles and Europe were always spaced a decade apart. He enjoyed another successful tour playing in all five tests, 23 of the 36 possible matches and placing 2nd as tour point scorer behind Phil Hawthorne. Later in 1967 he made the final state and national appearance of his illustrious career when the Irish national team toured to Sydney. Accolades Lenehan was inducted into the Wagga Wagga City Council, Sporting Hall of Fame and given a biographical entry on the city website.

The map also shows Lake Kenozero. Lake Kenozero () is a freshwater lake, located in the south-west of Plesetsky District of Arkhangelsk Oblast in Russia. It is one of the biggest lakes in Arkhangelsk Oblast and the biggest one in Plesetsky District. The area of the lake is , and the area of its basin is . Lake Kenozero is the source of the Kena, a tributary of the Onega. The lake thus belongs to the Onega basin and the White Sea basin. The lake is located close to the border of Arkhangelsk Oblast and Republic of Karelia. It belongs to Kenozersky National Park. The basin of Lake Kenozero covers a vast area in the western part of Plesetsky District and some minor areas of Onezhsky District. The main tributary of the lake is the Pocha, which, in turn, flows out of Lake Pochozero. The main tributary of Lake Pochozero is the Undosha. The source of the Undosha is Lake Undozero, one of the biggest lakes of the region, and a major right tributary is the Toksha. The lake has a complex shape and in fact consists of three lakes connected by straights: Lake Kenozero proper, Lake Svinoye, and Lake Dolgoye. The shape is determined by the fact that Lake Kenozero is located in the rift of the earthcrust, in contrast to other lakes in Kenozersky National Park, all of them being of glacial origin. There are over 70 islands on Lake Kenozero. Until the 1990s, the lake served for timber rafting. The rafts were made in the course of the Undosha and the destination was the Onega. There are a dozen of villages at the lakeshore, the biggest of which are Vershinino and Pershlakhta. The road connects the northern shore (in particular, Ust-Pocha, Vershinino, and Pershlakhta) with Onezhsky Trakt, the road connecting Kargopol via Plesetsk to Yemetsk. The road continues north to Pochozero and upstream Toksha River to the village of Nizhneye Ustye. There is regular bus service on this road, connecting Nizhneye Ustye with the selo of Konyovo and eventually with the district center of Plesetsk. The roads at the western and southern shores are not all-seasonal and are connected to the road network in the village of Morshchikhinskaya on Lake Lyokshmozero.

Over a period of three months in early 2001, Aston, a cocaine addict, attacked 26 elderly and disabled people in robberies at their homes in Birmingham and parts of neighbouring Sandwell. Two of the victims died as a result of their injuries; 87-year-old George Dale, who died in hospital two weeks after being attacked at his Ladywood home on 16 March, and 80-year-old Frank Hobley, who was also attacked in March 2001 at his home in Stechford and died three months later as a result of his injuries. His spree began in Smethwick on 12 January 2001, when he robbed a 71-year-old man of ¬£100. By the end of that month, he had robbed a further eight elderly people at different addresses in the town, the oldest being an 85-year-old woman. He committed two further robberies in Smethwick on 9 February 2001. The next day, he robbed a 63-year-old woman in Ladywood before returning to Smethwick and committing two further robberies - both from the homes of elderly people. On 19 February, he robbed a 74-year-old Ladywood woman, three days before he robbed a 90-year-old Smethwick woman in her home. On 25 February, he robbed a 60-year-old Smethwick man of ¬£80 before heading to Tipton and robbing an 86-year-old man of ¬£200. He continued his spree up to the end of March 2001, committing a further nine attacks and robberies against elderly people, before he was finally arrested on 31 March while assaulting an attempting to rob a 92-year-old Sheldon man. Aston was first questioned about the attack on George Dale three days after it happened. Mr Dale's wife Betty, 86 at the time, was also injured in the attack but survived. Aston was charged with multiple thefts and assaults after his initial arrest He was charged with the murder of George Dale on 5 April 2001, and later with that of Frank Hobley following his death in hospital in June 2001. He was subsequent charged with a total of two murders and 24 lesser offences against his victims who had survived his attacks. By the time he went on trial in January 2002, six people who had survived his attacks had died, while another six were too frail to give evidence against him in court. He was found guilty of two murders and a further 24 charges of assault and robbery at Birmingham Crown Court on 20 February 2002, for which he received 26 life sentences. No recommended minimum term was reported at the time, and whether a fixed minimum term has been set by the Home Office or High Court since has not been reported, although media sources at the time suggested that Aston was unlikely to be released for a very long time, if ever.

Biography  Volk was born in Schowkwa, Galicia (today Ukraine) to a middle-class Jewish family and grew up in Moravian Prostƒõjov, where he attended gymnasium. He studied economics and philosophy at Charles University in Prague. He was involved with the socialist-zionist Poale Zion and with others in its left wing, joined the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia in 1921. He then went to Soviet Russia and worked short-term in the soviet diplomatic service as a secretary at the embassy in Beijing and at the Soviet Russian press agency in Vienna. At the end of 1922, Volk moved back to Germany, where under the assumed name of Robert, he worked full-time as a functionary of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). From 1923‚Äì1924, he was the political leader of the regional KPD in Lower Saxony and during the Hamburg Uprising, acted as political commissar. After a brief period on the Comintern staff in Moscow, he moved back to Germany in 1924, where he headed the KPD daily newspapers, S√§chsische Arbeiterzeitung in Leipzig and Der K√§mpfer in Chemnitz until 1925. In 1926, he became head of the central KPD news service in Berlin.Hermann Weber/Andreas Herbst, Deutsche Kommunisten. Biographisches Handbuch 1918 bis 1945, Berlin: Karl Dietz Verlag (2004), pp. 822-823. Initially Volk was in the left wing of the party, aligned with Ruth Fischer, Arkadi Maslow and Ernst Th√§lmann, but in 1928, he modified his views, becoming a leading member of the Conciliator faction. The ultra-left party line of the KPD leadership under Th√§lmann labeled the moderates social fascists, according to the position taken by the Comintern. As a result, Volk was relieved of his party functions and in a disciplinary move, sent to Hamburg, where he headed the KPD newspaper, the Hamburger Volkszeitung. After the Wittorf affair, he was relieved of this position, as well. In 1929, after the power of the Conciliator faction was weakened within the party, he continued to lead the faction discreetly, working with Georg Krausz and Heinrich S√º√ükind to build a Conciliator organization within the Berlin KPD. After the seizure of power by the Nazi Party in 1933, Volk's Conciliator group went underground to fight the Nazi government,Biographische Datenbanken: Max Frenzel Bundestiftung Aufarbeiten. Retrieved July 20, 2011 concentrating on factories. Here, as in exile, Volk maintained close contact with social democratic and socialist groups, like Neu Beginnen and the Revolutionary Socialists of Germany. Volk was forced to flee to France in 1933 and later that year, he took part in the Conciliator meeting in Zurich. His hope for a reformed KPD was strengthened after the retreat from the ultra-left party line in 1934 and the 7th Comintern Congress in 1935. However, he was disillusioned by the Moscow trials and most of all, by the execution of Nikolai Bukharin, which caused him to break with the KPD in 1938.

Early life Originally from a poor family, due to starvation he joined the retinue of Pazhassi Raja as a boy. Pazhassi Raja loved him as his own son and was impressed by the ability and courage of Chandu. So he gave the best training to Chandu in war and administration and appointed him as a Karyakar or minister.\\"Kerala Simham\\", Sardar KM Panikker, 1941 Raja also made Chandu, a commoner by birth, into a noble. Raja asked a Nambiar noble clan of Pazhayveedu to adopt him. Thus Chandu became Pazhayaveettil Chandu Nambiar and hence came his nickname Pazhyamviden.\\"Kerala Simham\\", Sardar KM Panikker, 1941 Marriage Raja also arranged his marriage with a lady named Unniamma, who was sister of famous Kaitheri Ambu. Ambu, who probably detected the true self of Chandu, was reportedly not very pleased with this alliance. He consented only because he could not say no to Raja.\\"Kerala Simham\\", Sardar KM Panikker, 1941 Military service Chandu fought bravely in Pazhassi Raja's warfare with Mysore troops. He was reputedly one of the ablest fighters in whole of Kerala of his time and he was very arrogant about it.\\"Kerala Simham\\", Sardar KM Panikker, 1941 Double agent Chandu after 1793 openly broke off his ties with Raja and joined forces with his uncle Vira Varma and then, with English East India Company.

He even came close to Wellesley who mention about him in his dispatches \\"Supplementary Dispatches of Arthur Wellesley\\",Edited, 1858 as Pye Vittil Chandoo. Betrayal of his Raja In 1805, Chandu disclosed all secrets about Pazhassi war machine to English which resulted in complete collapse of rebel resistance and even surprised Pazhassi Raja in his hideout where he was killed in a gun battle. Chandu is reportedly said to have betrayed his master for money. Death He died in mysterious circumstances - he was found murdered most probably by Pazhassi partisans in revenge.

Working across the United Kingdom it provided support for isolated, marginalised and lonely older people on low incomes until 2015 when it closed operations, merging its remaining funds and assets with the charity Contact the Elderly. Description The charity's long held mission was to tackle the widespread problem of loneliness and isolation for older people through services that offer access to social contact and support. By 2011 a national campaign - the Campaign to End Loneliness - was set up and represents a significant step in raising the profound problems of social isolation for a fast growing and ageing population in the UK. NBFA Assisting the Elderly continued to work to address loneliness and isolation by providing direct services to disadvantaged older people, particularly in areas of high deprivation. The charity began by distributed financial grants to existing organisations and charities supporting older people. The first of its own services was to donate television sets to isolated older people - in the days when friends and neighbours would gather in the nearest home with access to a television. The most popular and longest lasting service was short breaks to the seaside, later re-modelled as friendship and respite breaks, and by 1996 over 35,000 older people had benefited from a short seaside break. Other services included donating emergency home alarms for vulnerable older people still living at home and donating TENS pain control machines for older people coping at home with medical conditions which caused them chronic pain. In 2015 the charity regretfully closed its operations and intends to distribute remaining funds for the benefit of disadvantaged older people. Founded in 1957 by MP Jeremy Thorpe as one of its early Trustees, the charity has always been rooted in its connections with Westminster and the Churchill family. Clementine Churchill (widow of the prime minister) became president in 1972. The chairman from 1995 to 2010 (and trustee since 1974) was Winston Churchill (grandson of the former prime minister), The sole patron for many years was Mary Soames, Baroness Soames (daughter of Prime Minister Winston Churchill). A serving trustee is Minnie (Mary) Churchill. Former and current trustees include Paul Burstow, Dermot de Trafford, John de Trafford, Roger Pincham, Jeff Rooker, Baron Rooker, Laura Sandys, Stephen Lloyd, Sheila Gilmore and Tony Newton, Baron Newton of Braintree. The vice presidents were Frederick Forsyth , Christopher Herbert, John Alderdice, Baron Alderdice, Dafydd Elis-Thomas and David Steel. George Thomas, 1st Viscount Tonypandy was appointed chairman of the NBFA in 1984 and served for a decade and was then appointed honorary president. He was succeeded as president by Betty Boothroyd who held that post until her retirement in 2015. The current chairman is Marion Roe. Registered charity number 1147447.

A number of mountain lakes are scattered throughout the group, among which the beautiful Orlovaƒçko Jezero. The Neretva river sources from these mountains: as also the Hrƒçavka, tributary of the Sutjeska river and the Bjelava, tributary of the Drina river.

Zelengora Particulars The mountains of Zelengora were not part of the frontline during the 1990-1995 conflict and therefore have virtually no contamination with land mines and unexploded ordnance.BiH Mine Action Centre, (Annual) Mine Maps Earlier though, in 1943, Zelengora became the scene of fierce combat during the Second World War, especially in a decisive phase of the Battle of the Sutjeska. By means of an operation called Fall Schwarz, the German occupational forces tried to encircle and destroy the YNLA, the partisan forces of Marshal Josip Broz Tito who had taken positions around Durmitor mountain in present Montenegro. Tito planned to break out of the encirclement towards the north across the river Sutjeska. In a battle that started on 5 June 1943, Partisan units of the YNLA 2nd Dalmatian Brigade took up positions in order to enable an escape of the YNLA forces through Zelengora. They were engaged by the German 118th J√§ger Division. In spite of exhaustion, illness and dwindling munition supplies, the partisans of the 2nd Dalmatian Brigade held out against the far superior German forces until they were strengthened by the 1st Majevica Brigade on 9 June and were enabled to retreat in order to join the YNLA on 10 June. By that time, the 2nd Brigade had lost two thirds of its numbers, but had been successful in stalling the German advance sufficiently to allow Tito's forces to cross the Sutjeska river and break out of the German encirclement. See Spanish Wikipedia: Batalla del Sutjeska Later, in May 1945, these mountains became the site of the last military standoff between the Yugoslav People's Army and the ƒåetnik forces of Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá in a battle that lasted from 8 until 13 May 1945. see Serbo-Croat Wikipedia: Bitka na Zelengori Zelengora is now known as \\"a wilderness of outstanding beauty\\"Gomez, p. 96 The eroded peaks of Zelengora that emerge from large mixed forests, attract, also because of the remoteness of the area, relatively few hikers. The wildness of the nature and the complete lack of signs of modern civilization gives these mountains a special appeal. The area around Orlovaƒçko Jezero -and elsewhere- though, bears visible traces of historical habitation. The protection as part of the Sutjeska National Park of a large area of these mountains safeguards the integrity of the wilderness.

Approximately 30 percent of Esmeraldas (Ecuador) was destroyed, including the children's department of the hospital, where three children died. In all, 111 persons died and 45 were injured as a result of the earthquake. Water mains were broken and power transmission lines were damaged. The Esmeraldas-Quito highway collapsed at many places. Many other roads of the country were made impassable by cracks and fallen trees. According to press reports, a landslide from the slopes of the Andes at Panado village buried a hundred people. The earthquake was destructive in the cities on the northern coast of the country and was strong from Latacunga to Quito, Ibarra and Tulc√°n. It was felt at Guayaquil. Tectonic setting Ecuador and Colombia lie above a convergent boundary where the Nazca Plate is being subducted beneath the South American Plate. The convergence rate is 55 mm per year and the subduction is significantly oblique to the boundary. This part of the plate boundary has been the location of a series of large historical earthquakes, including the =8.8 1906 Ecuador‚ÄìColombia earthquake, which ruptured 5-600 km of the plate interface. Since 1906 there have been three major earthquakes that together have re-ruptured this same segment, in 1942, 1958 and 1979. Damage In Colombia, Tumaco suffered most of all. Several old residences and a wooden home for railway workers collapsed. The large brick ovens used for drying pulp collapsed at the sawmills. The brick wall of the new church cracked. The walls of a number of other buildings cracked. The rafters of the roof of the tide gauge box set up at the end of the breakwater (on Del Morro Island) came out of their grooves, the roof collapsed and carried the instrument and the box with it into the water. Pile wooden homes rocked so strongly in a north-south direction, that 8 cm gaps appeared in the ground at the foundations. The corrugated roof of the lower shed was bent in by the collision of two adjacent sheds. The embankments connecting Tumaco Island with adjacent islands crumbled and cracked. Bottles, vases, dishes, cameras, typewriters, etc. fell and broke. Water splashed out of tubs. The telegraph link between Tumaco and La Espriella was out of commission for 24 hours because of fallen posts. A resident of the city was injured. Eyewitnesses between Tumaco and Esmeraldas found it difficult to remain standing. Water gushed out of cracks in the ground on Manglares Cape, and trees fell. The earthquake was strong at Pasto, Ipiales, Imuesa, Tuquerres and Sapuyas; it lasted about 40 minutes, but did not cause material damage. At Cali and Pereira, the population was frightened. At Bogot√°, the pendulums stopped on the clocks at the seismic station. Many recurrent shocks were felt at the epicentral zone; the two strongest occurred on January 19 at 9:45 and on February 1. According to geodesic data, the breakwater at Tumaco was shifted 1 cm along the vertical by the earthquake. The earthquake gave rise to a tsunami. A launch almost sank at Esmeraldas; four customs officers died. The waves damaged Tumaco and Guayaquil.

Early life He was the eldest son of the magistros Eustathios Argyros, Drungary of the Watch under Leo VI the Wise (ruled 886‚Äì912). He had two brothers, Leo and Romanos. In ca. 910, Pothos and his brother Leo Argyros were serving at court as manglabites (personal bodyguards of the emperor), when their father was poisoned after being suspected by Leo for plotting against him. The two brothers brought their father's body for burial to the monastery of Saint Elizabeth in the Charsianon district, founded by their grandfather Leo Argyros. Accordingly he was born probably ca. 890 or a little later.  Military career  Pothos and Leo both followed military careers and reached high office. In ca. 921 Pothos was appointed to the post of Domestic of the Schools by Romanos I (r. 920‚Äì944) in succession to Adralestos, who had died recently. A \\"most handsome and experienced man\\", according to Theophanes Continuatus, he was sent to counter a Bulgarian invasion into Thrace during the Byzantine‚ÄìBulgarian war of 913‚Äì927. Pothos led the tagmata of the capital to meet them, but a scouting detachment under a certain Michael was ambushed and annihilated. In 922 Pothos was sent to meet another Bulgarian incursion, that had reached Pegae, a suburb of Constantinople. Pothos and John the Rhaiktor commanded the forces of the tagmata and the Hetaireia, along with elements of the fleet under Alexios Mosele. The Byzantine army suffered a crushing defeat at the Battle of Pegae in early April 922, losing many dead and captives. Pothos and his brother however managed to escape and find refuge in a nearby fort, while the Bulgarians plundered and burned down the imperial palaces at Pegaea and Stenon. This disaster evidently spelled the end of Pothos' career as Domestic, of whom nothing further is heard during Romanos I's reign. It is possible, however, that he is to be identified with the strategos of Hellas Pothos, who served in the late 940s. A man of the same name, holding the rank of patrikios and the post of Domestic of the Excubitors, is attested in 958, when he defeated a Magyar raid that had reached the vicinity of Constantinople on 11 April. While some scholars consider the two men to be identical, the prosopographical experts J.-C. Cheynet and J.-F. Vannier regard it unlikely, given that in 921, Pothos' brother was old enough to have a son of marriageable age, and suggest that the commander of 958 was another member of the family, likely the grandson of either Leo or Pothos.

The temple is dedicated to Lord Mayuranathaswamy, a form of Shiva, and has given its name to the town itself. The main icon is a lingam and the presiding deity is called Mayuranathar because the Hindu goddess Parvathi worshipped Shiva here in the form of a mayura. On the day of the new moon in the Tamil month of Aippasi (November‚ÄìDecember), religious Hindus have a ceremonial bath in the temple tank as it is believed to purify them from sins. An annual dance festival called the Mayura Natyanjali festival is celebrated within the precincts of the temple each year.  Location  The Mayuranathaswami temple is located in the southern part of Mayiladuthurai about a mile from the Kaveri River. The temple is on the Chidambaram‚ÄìThanjavur highway.  Significance  Thiruvayyaru, Mayiladuthurai, Thiruvidaimaruthur, Thiruvenkadu, Chayavanam and Srivanchiyam are considered equivalents of Kasi. Like in Kasi, where the city is centered around Kashi Vishwanath Temple, the temples in these towns along the banks of river Cauvery, namely Aiyarappar temple in Thiruvaiyaru, Mahalingeswarar temple in Thiruvidaimarudur, Mayuranathaswamy temple in Mayiladuthurai, Chayavaneswarar temple in Sayavanam, Swetharanyeswarar temple in Thiruvenkadu, Srivanchinadhaswamy Koil in Srivanchiyam are the centerpieces of the towns. It is one of the shrines of the 275 Paadal Petra Sthalams - Shiva Sthalams glorified in the early medieval Tevaram poems by Tamil Saivite Nayanar Tirugnanasambandar. Architecture Hindu goddess Parvathi in the form of a peahen worshipping a shivalinga The presiding deity is a swayambhu lingam or a self-manifested lingam, the symbol of the Hindu god Shiva. Shiva's consort is known by the names Abhayapradhambikai, Abhayambikai, Anjalanayaki and Anjalai. There are three smaller shrines to the Hindu god Ganesha and another to Shiva as Nataraja or \\"Lord of Dance\\". One of the sculptures in the temple represent Shiva embracing Goddess Parvathi.Ayyar, p 271 According to mythology, the goddess Parvathi, the consort of Shiva, once offended him. Shiva was so annoyed he cursed Parvathi to be born as a lowly peahen. Later, when Parvathi repented, Shiva reduced this sentence. Parvathi had to pray first at Mylapore and then at Mayiladuthurai, at the end of which she was ridden of her curse and became known as \\"Abhayambal\\". It is believed that Brahma, Lakshmi, sage Agastya, Manmatha, birds and animals worshipped Mayuranathar.  History  thumb The temple was built by the Medieval Cholas. The oldest inscriptions on the temple walls date to the time of Kulothunga Chola I.Ayyar, p 280 Massive renovations were carried out during 1907-1927 by Devakottai AL.VR.P.Veerappa Chettiar & Pethaperumal Chettiarhttps://alvrp.wordpress.com/al-vr-p-history/ In May 1927, a temple entry of Dalits was organised on a big scale by the proponents of the Self Respect Movement thereby resulting in a huge clash.  Architecture  The temple complex is long and wide.http://temple.dinamalar.com/en/new_en.php?id=214 The gopura at the eastern entrance to the temple is nine storeys high and measures . The idol of Durga near the northern entrance of the temple is expertly sculpted and differs from those in other temples. On the temple walls, there is the sculpture of a devotee trying to sever his head as an offering to the God. There is an expansive temple tank in the centre of the complex. People travel in large numbers to Mayiladuthurai to bathe in this tank on the day of the new moon in the Tamil month of Aippasi (November‚ÄìDecember). This bath purifies a person of sins because the waters of the river Ganges and other Indian rivers mingle with the waters of the Kaveri river in this tank on this particular day.Ayyar, p 249  Notes   References  * External links Gallery File:Mayuram mayuranathartemple2.jpg|Temple tank File:Mayuram mayuranathartemple3.jpg|View from entrance File:Mayuram mayuranathartemple4.jpg|Inner gopura File:Mayuram mayuranathartemple5.jpg|Adhimayurathaswami vimana Category:Padal Petra Stalam Category:Shiva temples in Mayiladuthurai district ","title":"Mayuranathaswami Temple, Mayiladuthurai"},{"id":"32464314","text":"is an island in Japan, which is part of the Okinawa Islands and administered as Aguni Village in Shimajiri District, Okinawa Prefecture.

Long (born 17 November 1934) is an English former professional football player and coach, who played for Crystal Palace as a defender between 1955 and 1970 making a then record number of appearances for his only club. Early and personal life Long was born in Tylers Green, Buckinghamshire on 17 November 1934. Playing career Long, who played as a defender, began his playing career as an amateur with Arsenal, before signing for his local team Wycombe Wanderers at that time a non-league club competing in the Isthmian League. In May 1955, he signed for Crystal Palace, and went on to make over 400 appearances in the Football League before retiring as a player in 1970. During Long's playing career, he appeared for Palace initially in the old Third Division South and then in the fourth, third and second tiers of the League after reorganisation in 1958. In doing so, he put together a sequence of 214 consecutive appearances and was a part of the 1961 and 1964 promotion sides. However, he made only two appearances in the 1968‚Äì69 season which saw Palace reach the top flight for the first time but although he remained a player until the 1970 close season, did not make an appearance in the old First Division during the 1969‚Äì70 season. He thus played for Crystal Palace in four different divisions of the League, but not in the top flight. Coaching career After retirement, Long remained at Palace as a coach, and in 1972, was appointed assistant manager to Bert Head. However, when Head was replaced by Malcolm Allison in 1973, Long also left Crystal Palace. He later had a spell as caretaker manager of Millwall, reverting to assistant manager until he was sacked during the 1982‚Äì83 season.

Resolution Observations The Security Council called on both Cyprus and Northern Cyprus to urgently address the humanitarian issue of missing persons. It noted the Secretary-General Kofi Annan's assessment that the security situation was stable and the situation along the Green Line was calm. Both sides were urged to refrain from actions that would increase tension. Council members appreciated the work of the Under-Secretary- General Ibrahim Gambari in concluding an agreement outlining the principles of a bi-federal, bi-communal federation for a settlement of the dispute.

John Wittorf, an official of the Communist Party (KPD), was a close friend and prot√©g√© of party chairman Ernst Th√§lmann. Th√§lmann tried to cover up the embezzlement, for which he was ousted from the central committee. Joseph Stalin intervened and had Th√§lmann reinstated, signaling the beginning of a purge and completing the Stalinization of the KPD.  Background  During the 1928 German federal election, John Wittorf (1894‚Äì1981), a member of the KPD central committee,Branko M. Laziƒá, Milorad M. Drachkovitch, Biographical dictionary of the Comintern Hoover Institution, Stanford University. Hoover Press Publication (1986), p. 466. Retrieved July 28, 2011 embezzled 1,500 to 3,000 Reichsmarks from the KPD's campaign fund. KPD chairman Ernst Th√§lmann, who was a close friend and sponsor of Wittorf, knew about the embezzlement, but concealed it for tactical reasons.Michael Krejsa, Wo ist John Heartfield? in: G√ºnter Feist, Eckhart Gillen, Beatrice Vierneisel (Eds.), Kunstdokumentation SBZ/DDR 1945-1990. DuMont, Cologne (1996) p. 112 On September 26, 1928, after rumors of the embezzlement had been leaked to the press, the central committee expelled Wittorf and three other Hamburg officials from the KPD. Th√§lmann was relieved of his party responsibilities and he was accused of covering up Wittorf's actions.Ernst Th√§lmann biographical timeline Deutsches Historisches Museum. Retrieved July 19, 2011 Volker Ullrich, Stalins treue Vasallen. \\"Die Th√§lmann-Aff√§re 1928: Eine Schl√ºsselepisode in der Geschichte des Kommunismus\\" Die Zeit (May 15, 2003) No. 21. Retrieved July 20, 2011 Stalin, however, had been looking to strengthen Th√§lmann, whom he viewed as an ally and loyal supporter for the ultra-left positions then recently adopted at the Sixth World Congress of the Comintern. Stalin felt he could count on Th√§lmann to purge the KPD of both its right and moderate left wings. Stalin asked Vyacheslav Molotov for advice in handling the problem of Th√§lmann's ouster. In a telegraph to Molotov on October 1, 1928, Stalin acknowledged that Th√§lmann had made a huge mistake in covering up the embezzlement, but Stalin defended his motives, calling them \\"unselfish\\". He said Th√§lmann had been trying to spare the party a scandal, in contrast to the motives of Arthur Ewert and Gerhart Eisler, KPD central committee members who were in the Conciliator faction. Stalin felt they had placed their own interests over those of the party and the Comintern and saw in their actions \\"absolutely no mitigating circumstances\\". Stalin then took action. On October 6, 1928, the executive committee of the Comintern passed a resolution expressing \\"complete political trust\\" in Th√§lmann, reversing the KPD's September 26 decision and calling on the KPD to \\"liquidate all factions within the party\\". Despite stubborn resistance from several prominent officials, the central committee of the KPD reinstated Th√§lmann as party chairman on October 20, 1928. This signaled the beginning of the KPD's purge of its right-wing and the moderate Conciliator faction. The Wittorf affair was the final step of the Stalinization of the KPD. It made Th√§lmann servile with respect to Stalin and destroyed democracy within the KPD. It guaranteed Th√§lmann's and the KPD's commitment to the general line defaming the Social Democrats as social fascists, contributing not insignificantly to the KPD's own demise. Stalin used the affair to turn the Comintern into his tool; he showed his support for loyalty and ambition and neutralized both real and perceived political opponents. The discussion in the Comintern over the ousting of Th√§lmann had wide-reaching consequences for other Communist Parties, including the Communist Party of Italy.  Rediscovered after the Soviet Union's collapse  In the German Democratic Republic, formed from the Soviet occupation zone after the war, Th√§lmann was treated as a founding father, despite the fact that he did not survive his imprisonment in Nazi concentration camps, having been executed at Buchenwald. The Wittorf affair was distorted beyond recognition or simply not discussed. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the archives of the Comintern and the central committee of the Communist Party became available to western historians, revealing much about the Wittorf affair and the extent to which Stalin manipulated the Comintern and the KPD.

Gameplay The gameplay in Sanarara requires little interaction from the player, as most of the duration of the game is only spent on reading the text that appears on the lower portion of the screen, representing either dialogue between characters, or the inner thoughts of the protagonist. Every so often, the player will come to a \\"decision point\\", where he or she is given the chance to choose from multiple options. The time between these points varies and can occur anywhere from a minute to much longer. Text progression pauses at these points and depending on the choices that the player makes, the plot will progress in a specific direction.. There are multiple plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience. To view all of the plot lines, the player will need to replay the game multiple times, access different areas and make different choices to progress the plot in an alternate direction. One of the goals of the gameplay is to view the hentai scenes, depicting one of the protagonists having sexual intercourse with one of the heroines. Plot and characters Unlike most visual novels, Sanarara consists of four chapters and follows the stories of four protagonists.

He has engaged in several notable legal cases. The Martindale-Hubbell peer review system gave Bailey an AV rating, its highest category.  Background  Bailey was born in Bayside, Queens. He moved to California at age five and later moved back to New Milford, New Jersey, where he graduated from New Milford High School. He graduated with honors from Rutgers University and Syracuse University College of Law.  Notable cases  In 2008, Bailey formed a non- profit entity known as \\"Save Harlem\\" to challenge certain zoning changes being proposed by the City of New York, and to serve as lead plaintiff in a challenge to the proposed demolition of a two-story building at 125th Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard, and the development of the site as a shopping center. Bailey proposed legislation that would prevent the demolition. Early in 2008, Save Harlem, along with several building tenants (forming a group known as the Coalition to Save Harlem) sued, eventually settling for more than $1 million and gaining the right of the tenants to remain in the building. Park51 was a planned Muslim community center located near the site of the World Trade Center. Timothy Brown, a former firefighter, sued to prevent construction of the community center so close to the site of the September 11 attacks. Bailey represented the community center on a pro bono basis, and in July 2011 the New York Supreme Court held that Park51 would be permitted to build its proposed center. Trump SoHo New York is a $450 million 46-story 391-unit hotel condominium in SoHo, New York City. In February 2011, several prospective buyers of condominiums in the building, including French soccer star Olivier Dacourt, sued the developers in federal court, claiming that they had been tricked into buying the condos by the \\"deceptive\\" sales figures, and that the number of apartments sold at Trump Soho had been \\"fraudulently misrepresented.\\" The plaintiffs were represented by Bailey. Ultimately the suit was settled, with plaintiffs recovering 90 per cent of their deposits. Several years later, however, the case has been described as \\"a watershed case in the world of condo litigation.  * [C]ondo attorneys said that developers are now far more reluctant to disclose sales information to buyers‚Äô attorneys, for fear of legal repercussions if they turn out to be wrong.‚Äùhttps://therealdeal.com/2017/10/04/i-dont-think-ive-ever- received-a-letter-like-it-read-the-trump-soho-memo-written-to-cy-vance-that- tripped-up-a-criminal-investigation/ Following the financial crisis of 2007-08, Bailey successfully used the Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act of 1968, known as (\\"ILSA\\"), to relieve purchasers in Sky View Parc, a $1 billion condominium complex in Queens, of their contractual obligations to purchase, and in so doing was able to obtain the largest residential condominium settlement in New York history. The condominium was ordered to refund 75 per cent of the $5 million in down payments to the buyers who ended up backing out of the $50 million project. Bailey has been credited with being the first lawyer to use the law in this fashion, and he employed the same approach in a later case in a successful appeal of an adverse trial court decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Congress later closed the ILSA loophole with Public Law 113-167, which provides an exemption for condominiums from ILSA's registration requirements for all new construction after enactment. Bailey has been described as a controversial figure in NYC real estate.https://therealdeal.com/issues_articles/public-enemy-no-1-for- developers/ http://observer.com/2012/02/the-brouhaha-behind-the-ground-zero- mosque-introduced-adam-leitman-bailey-to-the-world-so-whats-next-for-real- estates-most-public-attorney/  Suspension of law license  On May 3, 2019, Bailey was suspended from practicing law for a four-month term. The suspension was imposed for undignified conduct (including telling a party suing Bailey's client that he \\"should commit suicide\\") and for threatening criminal charges to obtain an advantage in a civil matter. The suspension ended in September, 2019, and Bailey was able to return to the practice of law.  Author  In 2011, Bailey wrote Finding The Uncommon Deal: A Top New York Lawyer Explains How to Buy a Home for the Lowest Possible Price. The book gained Bailey the 2012 \\"First Time Author\\" award granted by the National Association of Real Estate Editors. Bailey has also written a children‚Äôs book, Home, which was named as a Silver winner in the category Picture Book/Early Reader by Literary Classics.

It was here he led his first Greenland expedition, a 2 month climbing trip to the Schweizerland Alps, beginning a lifelong obsession. At just 23, Walker became one of the UK's youngest Winter Mountain Leaders. In 1993 he made the first ascent of the 28 pitch northeast ridge of Mont Forel in east Greenland. At 3360m Mont Forel was once thought to be the highest mountain in the Arctic Circle before the discovery of Gunnbj√∏rnsfjeld 3693m. In 1996 he climbed a number of the main summits of the Crown Prince Frederick Range together with members of the Tangent British East Greenland Expedition.Tangent Expedition Reports In 1999 he led the first British guided ski crossing of the Greenland Icecap using kites. In 2001 he headed to Svalbard to lead the \\"Polestar\\" team to make the first British south-north ski traverse of Spitsbergen. In 2004 Paul organized and led the US Navy Air Crash Recovery Expedition to the Kronborg Glacier, east Greenland. This expedition was commissioned by the US Navy to recover the human remains of US Navy personnel lost in an earlier air crash of a P-2V Neptune on January 12, 1962. In 2006 he led an 8 man team to make the first winter ascent of Gunnbj√∏rnsfjeld, the highest mountain in the Arctic Circle. During this expedition the team were attacked during the night at their base camp by a polar bear who ripped through several tents.

The colossal bell was hung by King Ranjit Malla in 1737 AD and was used to sound the daily curfew. It was rung every morning when goddess Taleju was worshiped. Despite the Temple being completely demolished by the 2015 Gorkha earthquake, the bell remains intact.

The statues date back to 1701 A.D. and it is said that the unfortunate sculptor had his hands cut off afterward, to prevent him from duplicating his masterpieces. Ugrachandi has eighteen arms holding weapons, and she is in the position of casually killing a (Buffalo) demon. Bhairab has twelve arms and both god and goddess are garlanded with necklaces of human heads. Rameshwar Temple ‚Äî The first temple one notices on the right of the gate is Rameshwar, in front of Gopi Nath Temple which is a Gum Baja style. It is an open shrine with four pillars and it is dedicated to Shiva. The name Rameshwar comes from that it was Ram as an incarnation of Vishnu who had the original temple of Mahadev built at Rameshwar Temple in South India. Badrinath Temple ‚Äî A small temple west of the Gopi Nath Temple locally known as Badri Narayan is dedicated to Vishnu and Narayan. Gopi Nath Temple ‚Äî Two roofed pagoda style is the Gopi Nath Temple, attached to Rameshwar Temple that houses the three deities Balaram, Subhadra and Krishna. It is difficult to see the deities as the door remains mostly closed. The temple is also known as Jagannath, which is another form taken by Vishnu. Dwarka, also known as the Krishna Temple, houses three deities, left to right: Satyabhama, Krishna, and Radha. Their images are carved in stone. In the month of Mangsir (November/December), the deities are placed in a palanquin and taken around the city. Kedarnath Temple ‚Äî The terracotta made Shikara style temple is the Kedarnath (Shiva) Temple. Hanuman Statue ‚Äî The entrance to the National Art Gallery is flanked by the figure of Hanuman, the monkey god, who appears in Tantric form as the four armed Hanuman Bhairab. Hanuman is worshiped for strength and the devotion. Layaku Hiti dhunge dharaVatsala Devi Temple ‚Äî Directly in front of the palace and beside the king‚Äôs statue and next to the Taleju Bell is the Vatsala Devi Temple. This Shikhara style temple is completely constructed in sandstone and is built upon a three-stage plinth, and has similarities to the Krishna temple of Patan. It is dedicated to Vatsala Devi, a form of the goddess Durga. The temple was originally built by King Jitamitra Malla in 1696 A.D. The structure that can be seen today, however, is reconstructed by King Bhupatindra Malla and dates back to the late 17th or early 18th century. Behind the temple is a water source called dhunge dhara and next to it stands the Chayslin Mandap.Bhaktapur Durbar Square , btdc.com.np. Retrieved 27 October 2015  Layout  Bhaktapur Durbar Square in 2004 The Durbar Square proper houses the 55-window Palace which was constructed by King Jitamitra Malla and was home to royalty until 1769. It is now a national gallery. Close by is the Golden Gate which leads into Mulchok Court which is home to the Taleju Temple. This temple, like others in the main towns of the Kathmandu Valley, is dedicated to the goddess Taleju Bhawani and includes shrines to both the Taleju Bhawani and Kumari. Entrance to the temple is restricted and the living goddess strictly cannot be photographed. The Durbar square is surrounded by spectacular architecture and vividly showcases the skills of the Newari artists and craftsmen over several countries. The royal palace was originally situated at Dattaraya square and was only later moved to the Durbar Square location.  Impact of earthquakes  The Durbar Square was severely damaged by the earthquake in 1934 and hence appears more spacious than the others, in Kathmandu and Patan. Originally, there were 99 courtyards attached to this place, but now only 6 remain. Before the 1934 earthquake, there were 3 separate groups of temples. Currently, the square is surrounded by buildings that survived the quake. On 25 April 2015, another major earthquake damaged many buildings in the square. The main temple in Bhaktapur's square lost its roof, while the Vatsala Devi temple, famous for its sandstone walls and gold-topped pagodas, was also demolished.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Windermere, the archdeaconry of Westmorland and Furness, and the diocese of Carlisle. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. Its benefice is united with that of St Anne‚Äôs Church, Ings; St Cuthbert's Church, Kentmere; St James' Church, Staveley; Jesus Church, Troutbeck and St Mary's Church, Windermere. History A church has been present on the site since at least 1203. This was originally a chapel of ease to the mother church at Kendal, becoming a parish in its own right in 1348 at which time the churchyard was consecrated. The church burnt down in 1480, only the font, the base of the tower, and one door surviving. A new church was built and was consecrated in 1483. Amongst the benefactors was a local carrier named Bellman, who is said to have provided the lead for the roof. The church at this time had a simple plan, consisting of a nave with aisles, and a west tower. It contained box pews, a rood loft, a three-decker pulpit and, by 1812, a west gallery. On the walls and roof beams were murals and painted biblical texts. In 1870 the church was restored by the Lancaster architects Paley and Austin. The benefactors at this time included the local industrialist and politician Henry Schneider. Paley and Austin extended the chancel, raised the tower, to which they added a saddleback roof, and replaced the seating. During the restoration, painted inscriptions that had been covered in whitewash were rediscovered. Around this time murals were painted on the walls by Henry Hughes of London, who also restored the east window. In 1911 a vestry was added at the northeast, designed by W. L. Dolman. It was made into a memorial chapel in 1922 by Dolman to commemorate the 71 men from the parish who died in the First World War and as a thanksgiving for those who returned. The fund-raising for this was led by Sir William Forwood. Later in the 20th century, pews were removed from the back of the church to make a social area, and the choir vestry was made into a children's wing. At the turn of the millennium a glass screen was inserted in the tower arch, creating the Tower Room. Architecture Exterior St Martin's is constructed in slate rubble with sandstone dressings. It is roofed in lead. Its plan consists of a nave and chancel with a clerestory, north and south aisles running the whole length of the building, a south porch, a northeast chapel, and a west tower. Interior Hyde and Pevsner, in the Buildings of England series, describe the interior of the church as being \\"a strange sight\\", because it is constructed entirely in thickly plastered, white-painted, rubble. The piers have a square cross section, are chamfered, and are \\"markedly tapered\\". The font, a survivor from the original church, is made in sandstone. It consists of a small octagonal bowl, the corners of which are carved with heads. This may date from the 12th century, but its stem and base are later. At the base of the tower is a wooden statue of Saint Martin and a beggar, dating from the 17th century. The reredos dates from 1870, is made from marble, and contains mosaics that depict the symbols of the Four Evangelists and the Passion. In front of the lectern is a display case made by Arthur Simpson in 1907 in memory of the artist Dan Gibson. It contains books, including a copy of the Breeches Bible and two 16th-century chained Bibles. All the furnishings in the northeast chapel were designed by Dolman. In the southeast vestry/office is a memorial to Richard Watson, Bishop of Llandaff, who died in 1816, by John Flaxman. On the south wall of the church is a wall memorial dated 1631. The memorials elsewhere include one to members of the Fleming family. The east window contains stained glass from many periods. The oldest piece is believed to date from 1260. Much of the rest is from the 1460s. The central three windows depict the Crucifixion, and this is flanked by windows containing saints. Below these are kneeling figures that include benefactors, Augustinian canons, and the prior of Cartmel Priory. It is thought that these pieces were transferred from the priory. During the 1870 restoration by Henry Hughes, new pieces of glass were added, each of which is inscribed with the initials \\"HH\\". One of the older features of the window, at the top, is the coat of arms of George Washington, whose ancestor, John Wessington, owned land at nearby Warton. In the north aisle is the Carriers Arms window. It incorporates pieces of ancient glass depicting the emblems of a carrier, and commemorate the carrier Bellman who supplied the lead for the roof. Elsewhere there is stained glass by Ward and Hughes from 1881, and by Powell's and by A. K Nicholson, both dated 1915. The glass in the northeast chapel, dating from the 1920s, is by Shrigley and Hunt. On the walls of the nave and on the beams are inscriptions. In the spandrels of the arches are catechetical texts believed to be from a book by Robert Openshawe published in 1590. On an arch facing the lectern is a thanksgiving poem dated 1629 for deliverance following the Gunpowder Plot. Elsewhere there are biblical texts. In the chancel and nave are murals in tempera and oil by Henry Hughes. The screen to the southeast vestry/office was moved here from St John's Church, Windermere, when it closed in 1995. This was designed by Dan Gibson and carved by the vicar and parishioners of St. John's. It is in Arts and Crafts style, and contains openwork panels. The screen in the tower arch, dating from 2000, consists of etched glass panels standing on a wood and glass base. The etchings were executed by Sally Scott, and depict angels and music. The three- manual organ was built in 1922 by Jardine and Company, and rebuilt in 1964 by J. H. Cowan of Liverpool. It was restored in 1999. There is a ring of eight bells, all cast in 1872 by John Warner and Sons. The interior is also home to several historic books dating back to the 16th and 17th Centuries that are on display. External features In the churchyard is a tomb with a headstone dated 1822 inscribed to the memory of a freed slave named Rasselas Belfield, who is described as \\"A Native of Abyssinia\\". It is thought that he had been a valet to Peter Taylor of Belfield house. The tomb is listed at Grade II. Against the wall of the south aisle is a white veined marble slab to John Bolton, a slave trader and plantation owner who died in 1837. Also in the churchyard is a South African War memorial dated 1903.

Home Rule in Pennsylvania  A Home Rule Municipality in Pennsylvania is one incorporated under its own unique organic charter or constitution, created pursuant to the state's Home Rule and Optional Plans Law and approved by referendum.Act of December 19, 1996, P.L. 1158, No. 177, 53 Pa.C.S. ¬ß 2901 et seq. Local governments without home rule can only act where specifically authorized by state law; home rule municipalities can act anywhere except where they are specifically limited by state law. History of Home Rule in Pennsylvania Municipal Home Rule, a political reform of the early 20th Century Progressive movement, was introduced in Pennsylvania by a 1922 amendment to the Pennsylvania State Constitution of 1874, but was generally limited to cities, and until Philadelphia, was never used. In 1949, with the City of Philadelphia on the brink of financial collapse, the Pennsylvania General Assembly enacted what is commonly known as the \\"Lord Home Rule Bill,\\"Act of April 21, 1949, P.L. 665, No. 155, First Class City Home Rule Act, 53 P.S. ¬ß 13101 et seq. named after a Pennsylvania state senator who was member of Philadelphia's infamous Republican machine.Charlton F.

State Constitution, Article IX, Section 2 and in 1972 enacted a uniform Home Rule Act which provides the procedures for municipalities to adopt home rule charters.Act of April 13, 1972, P.L. 184, No. 62, the Home Rule Charter and Optional Plans Law, 53 P.S. ¬ß 1-101 The Act, re-enacted in 1996, however fails to include Philadelphia, which remains under the 1949 Lord Home Rule Act. History of Home Rule in Philadelphia Philadelphia became the first municipality in Pennsylvania to enact a home rule charter, approved by the voters on April 17, 1951.The Committee of Seventy, The Charter: A History (1980) Among the reforms was the prohibition of elected city officials running for another office, such as a City Councilman running for mayor, without first resigning his existing office, and creation of a professional managing director. Existing Home Rule Reform Campaign However, as a result of political unrest caused by repeated financial crisis and political scandals, Philadelphia political activists, from the Tea Party, Reform Democrats and \\"Loyal Opposition\\" Republicans, have launched a citywide petition drive to have voters approve a referendum to create a new government study commission that essentially would write a new Home Rule Charter for Philadelphia.WethePeoplePhila.com DROP In the sixty years since the 1951 Home Rule Charter adoption, Philadelphia has continued to be rocked by multiple political scandals and is in such financial straits as to be under the state version of municipal bankruptcy, its finances governed by the Pennsylvania Intergovernmental Cooperation Authority.Act of June 5, 1991,P.L. 9, No. 6,Pennsylvania Intergovernmental Cooperation Authority Act for Cities of the First Class,53 P.S. ¬ß 12720.101, et seq. PICA was charged with \\"restoring the financial stability\\" and \\"achieving balanced budgets\\" for Philadelphia. However, Philadelphia politicians remain embroiled in the extremely unpopular DROP controversy. DROP, short for Deferred Retirement Option Plan, was introduced by then Mayor Edward G. Rendell (later Pennsylvania's governor) to facilitate orderly transition from seasoned civil service employees to their successors. However, City Council elected to include itself. The Philadelphia City Solicitor opined that City Council members and other elected officials could effectively resign for one day, collect their DROP benefits, in many cases, up to $450,000 or more, then return to work the following day. In an appeal in April 2011 of an election dispute to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, Justice Thomas Saylor, in a blistering dissent, wrote that City Council's ‚Äúsupposed ‚Äòretirements‚Äù amount to a mere pretense, or sham, designed solely to obtain the lump-sum DROP benefit involved and then to continue on the same position as before.‚ÄùIn re Nomination Petition of Frank Rizzo___A.2d___ (Pa. 2011) (Nos. 23 EAP 2011, 24 EAP 2011, 25 EAP 2011)(April 29, 2011) Urban Blight Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter is likewise drawing public ire, by his refusal to comply with the existing Home Rule Charter,Philadelphia City Charter, Section 4-400 in failing to send a proposed out-of-court settlement agreement between the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the Attorney General of Pennsylvania, the City of Philadelphia, and The Germantown Conservancy, a 501(c)(3) community development corporation, for appointment of the CDC as the court-appointed conservator under Pennsylvania's Abandoned and Blighted Property Conservatorship Act.Act of November 26, 2008, P.L. 1672, No. 135, The Abandoned and Blighted Property Conservatorship Act, 68 P.S. ¬ß 1101-1111 Philadelphia has over 40,000 abandoned buildings and vacant lots, costing homeowners $3.6 billion in lost homeowner equity.Econsult Corp., Vacant Land Management in Philadelphia (Nov. 2010) The Mayor is also refusing to collect a penalty tax levied against slumlords and other abandoned property owners as required by the Philadelphia City Code,Philadelphia City Code Chapter 19-2500, Real Estate Non-Utilization Tax losing up to $94.6 million a year.

A Save Our City canvass will commence from Thursday, July 28 through Saturday, August 6. Sunday, July 31 will be Holy Experiment Sunday, with over 1,000 houses of worship participating. Pastors are to read William Penn's Prayer for Philadelphia, then ask congregants who are registered Philadelphia voters to sign the Government Study Commission ballot question petition. Commonwealth Court Proceedings Several of the proponents circulating the Government Study Commission ballot question petition, have filed a Petition for Review in the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court seeking the Lord Home Rule Bill, enacted in 1949 solely for Philadelphia which while allowing citizens to petition to create a government study commission, the government study commission members are appointed by the mayor and city council president; be declared unconstitutional; because the more recent Pennsylvania State Constitution, enacted in 1968, through a 1972 Act, provides the right for all citizens to vote for candidates for the government study commission.Wirs et al v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 335 MD 2011 (Pa.Cmnwlth 2011) The proponents argue it is unconstitutional to deny a right to elect government study commission members to Philadelphia voters which is granted to all other Pennsylvania voters.

Tornadoes are an extremely rare occurrence in Italy, sometimes happening on a local scale but rarely causing relevant damage. Sicily tornadoes are the oldest documented occurrence of the phenomena on Italian ground. While the event is documented in many official sources, such as church registers and community archives, there are few reports from local witnesses. On December 20, 1851, the Illustrated London News published a report dating back to December 8 submitted by local sources in Malta, describing the path of two large waterspouts that crossed Sicilian plains from Marsala to Castellamare del Golfo, moving north-eastbound and evolving in a supercell of two full-blown tornadoes less than 500 meters apart. Along their path, heavy rain and hailstorms caused additional damage to farmlands. The most stricken area was Castellamare, where half the town was destroyed and about 200 citizens perished. The city harbor sustained serious damage, with many vessels destroyed or capsized and their crews lost at sea.

The Federal Monuments Office (BDA; ) is a department of the Federal Chancellery responsible for cultural heritage in Austria. History The BDA was established in 1853 under Emperor Franz Joseph I, as a central commission for the preservation of National Heritage Sites. Its duties include the preservation, restoration and cataloging of immoveable cultural heritage. The BDA also monitors the export provisions of the Austrian monument protection act for moveable cultural heritage. The BDA is divided into one central bureau and nine \\"land conservation districts\\" in the provincial capitals. At their disposal are the following central departments: * Historic buildings * Garden architecture (Historic garden conservation and historic parks) * Restored workshops Baudenkmalpflege * Industrial heritage (historic factories) * Export licenses for cultural heritage * Archeological sites * Heritage lists * Inventory and Heritage Studies (publisher of the Georg Dehio manual) * \\"Sound monuments\\" (church bells and organs) * Museums & libraries (excluding national museums) * Legal Matters (conservation law) * Art restoration workshops; namely the Central Chemical Laboratory of the Federal Monuments Office at the Vienna Arsenal, Naturwissenschaftliches Zentrallabor , BDA and the Architectural conservation restoration workshop in the Mauerbach Charterhouse. Restaurierwerkst√§tten Baudenkmalpflege Kartause Mauerbach , BDA Art and property restitution The BDA is also responsible for restitution of some 8,000 objects and works of looted art which Austria in the time of National Socialism had acquired by devious means. Since often the original owners and all of their relatives had been killed during the Holocaust, restitution took place in the manner of auctions for the benefit of the Jewish community or to pay for material restitution of destroyed property, as in the case of the Jewish cemetery in W√§hring. Austria first did little to restore property to the damaged owner, but in the late 1940s and 1950s was put under pressure to make more of an effort according to the Moscow Declaration. As access to archives has slowly opened over time for provenance research, new clues and details such as stickers on the backs of auctioned objects that were photographed, have resulted in the discovery of previously \\"unfindable\\" owners. A set of such results was published in early December 2008 and exhibited at the Museum of Applied Arts. Periodicals * Austrian magazine for art and historic preservation . Verlag F.

It is believed that Jaffray relied heavily on William Hall, a journeyman bookbinder originally from Berwick-on-Tweed, who arrived in London in 1781 and first made contact with Jaffray in 1843. The collection was first examined in detail by Ellic Howe in about 1945 and it formed the basis for Howe and John Child's subsequent works.  References  Further reading *Howe, Ellic.

Sources differ. The thinking behind the car was similar to that of Renault chairman Pierre Lefaucheux at this time: the 171 was intended to satisfy similar marketplace objectives to those addressed by the Renault Colorale. It first appeared formally at the Paris Motor Show in 1949, but sales started only in 1950 of two different ‚ÄúPick-up‚Äù versions, designed to take a ton of load. The ‚ÄúPick-up Normal‚Äù version, with an advertised starting price of 991,500 Francs, had its load area behind the vehicle's cabin but between the two rear wheels, giving a load area that was unencumbered by wheel arches but relatively narrow. With the ‚ÄúPick-up Large‚Äù version the load area extended to the full width of the cabin, but with the intrusion of the wheel arches. The bodywork of the load area did not extend beyond the cabin width on either version. Staying true to its Delahaye roots, the 171 gained greatly in credibility with its target market by competing with distinction in the Mediterranean-Cape Town Rally that was run along the length of Africa between 31 December 1950 and 21 February 1951. The cars were run by a team from the French Army. The ‚ÄúBreak‚Äù (station wagon) version of the 171 was also offered, from 1952, as a nine-seater ‚Äúfamiliale‚Äù which makes this one of several vehicles that could claim to have inspired the SUVs that became mainstream only in the 1990s. Even in this form the vehicle had only two doors, but with a width of 1930 mm (more than six feet) access was not a problem since on the passenger side the front bench seat did not extend to the full cabin width, so it was possible to access the middle two seats without much difficulty and possible to access the rear bench seat by passing between the two single seats of the middle row. The ‚ÄúBreak‚Äù bodied cars had their bodies built by a car body firm called ‚ÄúCarrosserie de Levallois‚Äù which appears to have been one of a number of such firms concentrated in the car making a quarter of Paris. The most prominently promoted of the other special bodied versions was a strikingly robust looking ambulance. Herwaythorn S.A., the French distributor of Hercules, Wayne, and Thornton products, also offered a 4x4 conversion. The six-cylinder 3,557 cc water-cooled engine was shared with the company's prestigious 135 and 235 models. However, on the 171 the engine came with only one carburetor and a compression ratio of 6.9 : 1 (or for some situations 6.5 : 1) which was significantly lower than that of the luxury cars. The 171's claimed maximum power output of 80 hp or 100 hp at 3,500 rpm was correspondingly lower than the 152 hp at 4,200 rpm listed for the 235. Large tires and 280 mm (11 inches) of ground clearance hinted at the variable road quality in some of the vehicle's target markets. The company's bread and butter model during its final years was the Jeep inspired VLR which gained a large contract with the French army. The sales of the colonial 171 were far lower than those of the VLR but nevertheless very much higher than those achieved by the company's famous luxury cars, and by 1952 the 171 was being produced at a rate of approximately 30 per month, sold in the French colonies and also achieving significant export success, especially in Brazil. Unfortunately, the 171 never sold in sufficient numbers to compensate for the commercial failure visited on the company's luxury car sales by post-war austerity and government taxation policy, and once the army contract for the VLR‚Äôs was lost the company quickly fell into the arms of Hotchkiss, the sale protocol being signed by the Delahaye shareholders on 9 June 1954. By this time Delahaye 171 sales had slowed to a trickle, with just 28 of them delivered during 1954, at the end of which production of the 171 was stopped.

He is the third person to use the Power Man alias after Erik Josten and Luke Cage. Publication history The character first appeared in Shadowland: Power Man #1, part of Marvel's 2010 \\"Shadowland\\" crossover and was created by Fred Van Lente and Mahmud Asrar. The character subsequently appeared in a spin-off mini-series, Power Man and Iron Fist, the following year. Power Man would then appear in \\"The Chosen\\", a story in the anthology comic Fear Itself: The Home Front. Power Man appeared as a supporting character in Avengers Academy beginning with issue #21 (Jan 2012), making occasional appearances throughout the series. Starting in September 2013, he appears as one of the lead characters in the Marvel NOW! relaunch of Mighty Avengers. Fictional character biography Victor Alvarez was first introduced as a teenager from the neighborhood of Hell's Kitchen in New York City. He is the son of Reina Alvarez and Shades. As a child, he was caught in an explosion caused by the villain Bullseye that resulted in the deaths of over 100 people including his father. Victor survived by somehow using a technique that drew the chi from the dead bodies around him and temporarily granted him superhuman strength and fortitude.Shadowland: Power Man #3 Some time later during the Shadowland storyline, Victor took on the name Power Man and began using his abilities to fight crime as a hero for hire, advertising his services on sites like Craigslist. Victor's activities eventually drew the attention of Luke Cage, a member of the Avengers who had once used the Power Man name. Cage and his partner Iron Fist eventually learn that Victor is the son of Shades, a Puerto Rican supervillain that Cage had fought years earlier. Though Victor dislikes both Cage and Iron Fist, he eventually teams up with them to help the other heroes fight the crazed Matt Murdock and his army of Hand ninjas.Shadowland: Power Man #1-4 During the Fear Itself storyline, Power Man ends up teleported onto a station in the middle of the Pacific Ocean with Amadeus Cho, Spider-Girl, Thunderstrike and X-23. They end up fighting a group of samurai Shark Men.Fear Itself: The Home Front #5-7 Power Man is part of the new class of students when the Avengers Academy moves to the former headquarters of the West Coast Avengers.Avengers Academy #21 (Nov. 2011) During the Infinity storyline, Power Man was with Heroes for Hire while they stopped Plunderer's men from stealing robot parts. After Superior Spider-Man (Doctor Octopus' mind in Peter Parker's body) stops Plunderer, he called Heroes for Hire mercenaries in front of Power Man. While at a caf√© with Luke Cage, Power Man expresses a desire to attack Spider-Man, Luke is more concerned with the consequences for his family. Power Man then plans to start his own version of the Avengers.Mighty Avengers Vol. 2 #1 Powers and abilities As a result of the traumatic explosion during his childhood, Power Man possesses the ability to draw chi energy from those around him and temporarily grant himself superhuman strength and fortitude. When utilizing this power, Victor's skin color changes to a glowing red. This technique is similar to the one that gives Iron Fist his abilities, something the hero commented on during his first encounter with Victor.Shadowland: Power Man #2 Victor Alvarez wears a yellow and black body suit with metal embellishments, similar to the look of Luke Cage, the first (heroic) Power Man.

It is one of the three Durbar Squares in the Kathmandu Valley, all of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. One of its attraction is the ancient royal palace where the Malla Kings of Lalitpur resided. The Durbar Square is a marvel of Newar architecture. The square floor is tiled with red bricks. There are many temples and idols in the area. The main temples are aligned opposite of the western face of the palace. The entrance of the temples faces east, towards the palace. There is also a bell situated in the alignment beside the main temples. The Square also holds old Newari residential houses. There are other temples and structures in and around Patan Durbar Square built by the Newa People. A center of both Hinduism and Buddhism, Patan Durbar Square has 136 \\"bahals\\" (courtyards) and 55 major temples. The square was heavily damaged by the earthquake in April 2015.https://twitter.com/SnowdenJohn/status/591857002239766528/photo/1 Destruction after the earthquake  History  The history of the Durbar Square is not clear. Although the Malla Kings of Lalitpur are credited with the establishment of the royal square, it is known that the site is an ancient crossroad. The Pradhanas, who settled around the site before the Mallas, have connections with the Durbar Square. Some chronicles hint that the Thakuri Dynasty built a palace and made reforms to the locality, but there is little evidence of this. Scholars are certain that Patan was a prosperous city since ancient times. The Malla Kings made important changes to the square. Most of the current architecture is from the 1600s, constructed during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla and his son Srinivasa Sukriti. Some of the notable Malla Kings who improved the square include Purandarasimha, Sivasimha Malla and Yoganarendra Malla. Important buildings Statue of Lion in Patan Durbar Square Patan is one of the oldest Buddhist cities. It is a center of both Hinduism and Buddhism with 136 bahals or courtyards and 55 major temples. Most of these structures are in the vicinity of the Durbar Square. Krishna Mandir Krishna temple is the most important temple in Patan Durbar Square. It was built in the local variety of Shikhara style called GranthakutaNepalese Architecture (2019). N.R.Banerjee.. The stone carvings along the beam above the first and second-floor pillar are most notable. The first-floor pillar carvings narrate the events of the Mahabharata, while on the second floor there are visual carvings from Ramayana. The temple was built in 1667 by King Siddhi Narsingh Malla. It is said that one night the King saw Lord Krishna and his consort Srimati Radha standing in front of the royal palace. He ordered a temple to be built on the same spot. There are 21 golden pinnacles in the temple. Below the pinnacles are three stories. The first floor holds the main shrine of Lord Krishna with shrines of Radha and Rukmini at each side. The second floor is dedicated to Lord Shiva and the third to Lokeshwor (Avalokiteshvara). The square is crowded with thousands of Hindu Pilgrims and devotees during Krishnastami. Bhimsen Temple Bhimsen Mandir 03 Bhimsen (Bhin : dya) Temple was built by Srinivasa Malla in 1680. It is renowned for its three interconnected golden windows. Bhimsen is a great personality in Mahabharata. He was known to be brave and strong. In Newa, he is traditionally worshiped as a god of business and trade.Gudrun B√ºhnemann. ‚ÄúBhƒ´masena as Bhairava in Nepal.‚Äù Zeitschrift Der Deutschen Morgenl√§ndischen Gesellschaft, vol. 163, no. 2, 2013, pp. 455‚Äì476.

It was built in 1627 during the reign of Siddhi Narsingh Malla. The roof supports are decorated with erotic carvings similar to imagery widespread in Shiva temples in India. The temple is guarded by two stone elephants in the front entrance. On the other side of the temple is the sculpture of a bull, Shiva's vehicle. A stone linga is enshrined inside the temple. Taleju Bhawani Temple Taleju temple was built by Siddhi Narsingh Malla in 1640 and rebuilt by Srinivasa Malla in 1667 after a fire. Taleju Bhawani was the personal deity of the Malla kings. It is a five-storey temple with triple-roofs. The 14th century chronicle of Gopala kings hint a Taleju temple was built by the Pradhanas before the Mallas.  Layout of the Palace  The three main courtyards in the palace are Mul Chowk, Sundari Chowk and Keshav Narayan Chowk. Besides these courtyards, the complex boasts impressive temples, religious shrines, and historical places, all noted for their exquisite carvings and beautiful display of ancient Newari architecture. Keshav Narayan Chowk Keshav Narayan Chowk Keshav Narayan Chowk is, inside the Patan Museum, to the north of the Mul Chowk. Keshav Narayan Temple is located at the center of this chowk and gave the chowk its name. Mul Chowk Mul chowk, Patan Durbar Square Mul Chowk is the central courtyard. It is the most famous and largest courtyard among the three main chowks. Vidya Temple is located at its center and Taleju temples stand around the courtyard. The doorway to the Shrine of Taleju, on the southern side of the courtyard, is confined by the statues of the river goddesses Ganga, on a tortoise, and Jamuna, on a carved makura (mythical crocodile). Sundari Chowk Tusha Hiti Sundari Chowk is to the south of the Mul Chowk. It is designed with sunken tank known as Tusha Hiti. Smaller than the Mul Chowk, it is now open to the public. The entrance of the chowk is guarded by the stone statues of Hanuman, Ganesh and Nara Singha, man-lion form of Vishnu As one enters through ,the chowk, they can see various local shops selling typical Newari cuisine. the newari cuisine consists of yomari, kachela, chhoila,black beans,beaten rice,vegetables along with the newari drink called chhyang which is made from rice. sundari chowk is mostly famous for the night life and recently there is a gigantic self illuminating moon placed in the chowk which has now become the attraction for tourists as well as the local people.

Four Tushetians, 1901 Subgroups The Tush divide themselves into two groups, the Chagma-Tush, who speak the local Georgian dialect and Tsova- Tush, also known as Bats or Batsbi, who speak the Bats language, a Nakh language (cousin of Chechen and Ingush). Most Bats also speak Georgian, to which there is a continuing trend of linguistic assimilation.The Red Book of Peoples of the Russian Empire; Bats section. Available online: http://www.eki.ee/books/redbook/bats.shtml Despite differences in language and culture (to a degree), both Chagma- and Tsova-Tush consider themselves to be part of the larger group of Tush, which in turn is considered a subgroup of Georgians. Appearance Anthropologically Tushetians have an Eastern Georgian type of face, with light colored eyes and hair color ranging from blonde to brown. Culture Keselo, Tusheti Traditionally, the Tushs are sheep herders. Tushetian Guda cheese (Not to be confused with European Gouda cheese, with which it shares neither the features nor the making technique) and high quality wool was famous and was exported to Europe and Russia. Even today sheep and cattle breeding is the leading branch of the economy of highland Tusheti. The local shepherds spend the summer months in the highland areas of Tusheti but live in the lowland villages of Zemo Alvani and Kvemo Alvani in wintertime. Their customs and traditions are similar to those of other eastern Georgian mountaineers, such as the Khevsurs and Pshavs. Like most Georgian groups, they are mainly Georgian Orthodox Christian in religion. Origins A Tushetian man; by Grigory Gagarin, 1840s The origin of the Tush themselves is a mysterious and debatable matter, with numerous theories regarding the origin of Tsova-Tush and of the Chagma-Tush. It also is uncertain whether the two groups have a common origin or not. Theories regarding the origin of the Tsova-Tush include involving descent from South Caucasian Nakh in Ancient times (either a Nakh people inhabiting areas of Kakheti and TushetiJaimoukha, Amjad.

Similarly to Italian cuisine, Lombard cuisine has much variety and every city and part of the region offers its own specialities. A characteristic Lombard dish is risotto, most famously risotto alla milanese (which contains saffron), with rice-based food being highly common throughout the region. Similarly to risotto, maize-based dishes such as polenta are also common parts of the regional cuisine. Famous Lombard dishes include cotoletta, cassoeula and ossobuco. The region also offers several delicacies and desserts, amongst which noted ones such as mostarda and panettone. Regional cheeses include Robiola, Crescenza, Taleggio, Gorgonzola and Grana Padano (the plains of central and southern Lombardy allow intensive cattle-raising). The various Lombard provinces have their own specialties. Cities Milan The capital of Lombardy is also home to many culinary specialties. One of the best known is risotto alla milanese, flavoured with saffron and typically served with many typical Milanese main courses, such as ossobuco alla milanese (cross-cut veal shanks braised with vegetables, white wine and broth) and cotoletta alla milanese (a fried cutlet similar to Wiener schnitzel, but cooked \\"bone-in\\"). Other Milanese specialities include cassoeula (a typical winter dish prepared with cabbage and pork), Rustin Negaa (a roast using veal covered with white wine or \\"drowned\\" in wine) and the famous panettone Christmas cake (sweet bread with candied orange, citron, and lemon zest, as well as raisins, which are added dry and not soaked). Ossobuco Veal shank A pot of cassoeula Risotto alla milanese con ossobuco Brescia The province of Brescia is the largest and most varied in Lombardy, this obviously also influences the cuisine, ranging from the typical peasant recipes of the lower Brescia, to the mountain cuisine of the valleys up to the cuisine of the lakes characterized by fish, olive oil and citrus fruits. Surely the most characteristic dish is the spiedo alla bresciana (Brescia-style spit), other typical dishes of Brescia include: \\"riso alla pitocca\\", \\"brofadei\\", \\"gnocarei e mariconde\\" (a soup), casoncelli, \\"luccio e polenta\\", \\"tinca al forno\\" \\"polenta pasticciata\\", \\"polenta e uccelli\\", \\"frittata di rane\\", \\"anguilla ai ferri\\", \\"verzata\\" and also dessert such as \\"bossol√†\\", \\"chis√∂l\\", \\"spongada\\" and \\"persicata\\". Como The cuisine in Como is heavily influenced by its lake. Typical are dishes of fish, like the \\"missultin\\", agoni salted and sun-dried, or whitefish and pikefish. There is even a special polenta, called \\"toch\\", made with equal parts of corn flour, butter and cheese, a very difficult and rich (in every sense) dish. Some villages and valleys around the lake, such as Oliveto Lario, are one of the few parts of northern Italy where olive trees were historically grown, called for this \\"zoca de l'oil\\" (valley of the oil). In Canzo, Nocciolini, made with hazelnut flour, and the liqueur Vespetr√≤ are typical. Cremona Cremona's Mostarda (a rich condiment made with candied fruit and a mustard flavoured syrup) is known throughout Italy and so is Torrone, which is a typical dessert from this province. Mantua Mantuan cuisine is noted for dishes of medieval origin and for sweet and sour flavors. Tortelli di zucca (ravioli with pumpkin filling) accompanied by melted butter and followed by turkey stuffed with chicken or other stewed meats Piras, 87. are one of the best known dishes from this area. Pavia Pavia province is divided in a hilly area, the Oltrepo Pavese, which is one of the main winemaking areas of Lombardy, and a plains area to the north, Lomellina, where rice is grown. Not surprisingly, local specialties are rice dishes, such as \\"Risotto alla Certosina\\" and \\"Ris e Ran\\" (a risotto with frog meat) from Pavia and \\"Risotto coi Peperoni\\" and \\"Ris in Cagnon\\" (rice with ragu' meat sauce) from the town of Voghera. Traditional wines from Oltrepo Pavese are Bonarda, Barbera and Pinot Noir. Many of the local wines have curious names, like Buttafuoco (spitfire), Sangue di Giuda (the blood of Judas) and Barbacarlo (the beard of Charles; probably one of the rarest wines on earth with a production of only 10,000 bottles a year). White wines are made from the grape varieties of Malvasia, Moscato and Cortese. Oltrepo is becoming well known for its sparkling wines, in particular \\"Spumante\\" and \\"Cruase\\". Voghera produces Agnolotti containing a beef filling which are known as \\"Agnolotti di stufato di Voghera\\" and are typically served \\"asciutti\\" (dry and not in a soup form) and dressed with a meat sauce (ragu'). Zuppa alla Pavese was supposedly invented on the spot to feed the captive king Francis I of France after his defeat at the Battle of Pavia on February 24, 1525. \\"Torta del Paradiso\\" is a cake from Pavia, which is also noted for the \\"Colomba Pasquale\\" a cake in the shape of a dove which is traditionally eaten at Easter. Voghera is noted for \\"Mostarda di Voghera\\", a pickled fruit accompaniment for boiled meats, and the \\"Zuppa di Voghera\\" a torte with coffee and cream and the \\"Stracchino di Voghera\\" a variety of gelato. \\"Bollito misto con Salsa Verde\\" is a specialty shared with Piedmontese and Emilian cuisines. In the Oltrepo Pavese a variety of hard doughnuts called \\"Brasade'\\", which originated in the tiny village of Staghiglione, is extremely popular for breakfast. A very simple pancake, known as \\"Schita\\" is eaten by children as a snack. The village of Varzi in the Oltrepo Pavese is renowned for its Salame, while the tiny village of Pometo is locally famous for its superb bread. Sondrio Valtellina's specialties are Bresaola (air-dried salted beef) and Pizzoccheri (a flat ribbon pasta, made with 80% buckwheat flour and 20% wheat flour cooked along with greens, cubed potatoes and layered with pieces of Valtellina Casera cheese). Sfursat is a local wine which has attained DOCG status.

Built starting in 1912, the main house on the property was intended as a summer home. The entire estate is owned by the Tualatin Hills Park & Recreation District (THPRD). The estate has eight buildings, including the main home and a farmhouse built in 1880. History Ralph and Belle Jenkins purchased the property for $7,000 in 1912 for what was intended to be their summer home. Belle was the daughter of John C. Ainsworth, a founder of the Oregon Steam Navigation Company, while Ralph had been a teacher. The Jenkins began construction on a large estate that year as an escape from the city. The English hunting lodge-style main home took three years to complete, and was in addition to the original farmhouse on the property. Other facilities on the estate included fine equestrian facilities, as well as gardens, a greenhouse, an ornamental pool, a tea house, a carriage house, and a water tower. Ralph Jenkins died in the 1950s; Belle died in 1963. Burt Muir inherited the property, but sold it to developers for what was planned to be a retirement community. Once the project failed due to a lack of water and sewer access, the developers put the estate up for sale. The Tualatin Hills Park & Recreation District purchased the Jenkins estate in 1976 for $525,000. In 1978, the estate was added to the National Register of Historic Places as the Belle Ainsworth Jenkins Estate. The Tualatin Valley Chapter of the American Rhododendron Society started working with THPRD in 1982 to restore the rhododendron garden on the property. The park district restored the property in 1989 at a cost of $178,000. Camp Rivendale, a camp for adults and children with disabilities, was created in the 1980s. Due to operating losses at the property, THPRD decided to outsource management of the events at the estate in 2013; Elephants Delicatessen was selected to manage the events at what it calls the Jenkins Estate. Details The carriage house Jenkins Estate covers and contains of gardens. The structures on the property are the main house, stable, carriage house, greenhouse, tea house, water tower, pump house, and the farmhouse. The main house is L shaped with a full basement. THPRD rents out the buildings for business meetings, weddings, and other events. The Herb Garden was created in 1985 with help from the Oregon School of the Blind and contains a Braille Garden planted with fragrant herbs.

The Diretto 152 night train between Bari and Milan derailed at 1:56 AM shortly before entering the station, killing 13 and wounding 127. Derailment A third series FS Class 428 similar to the one of the disaster. The 152 engine, FS Class E428.217, was helmed by engineer Ennio Covacci and assistant engineer Otello Manzi, from Ancona railway depot; the train was traveling northbound at 90 km/h, with about 500 passengers coming from many provinces of Southern Italy. The daily train was nicknamed Train of Hope, since it was used mostly to bring people from the poor south to the wealthy industrial cities in Northern Italy, looking for jobs and a better life. The train was supposed to swap track, due to maintenance work on the northbound track. A special speed limitation of 30 km/h had been enforced by means of an M40 mandatory alert, but the fixed signals reported condition normal and the train failed to slow down. While entering the switch between the first and the second track, the engine derailed at 102 km/h and fell to the right side. It kept skidding for about 100 meters, coming to a stop against the station's water refill tower. The first carriage, a luggage car, followed the engine and overturned to the left. Some poultry cages inside shattered, and dozens of hens were set free. A shipment of truffles received minor damage, but its strong smell became a distinctive memory for the emergency responders. A shoes load from Marche craftsmen was stored on a secondary luggage car, and was severely damage when the car hit a station building. The third car, a was thrown into a nearby field, part of Podere Borgo farmland, with minor injuries to the occupants. Less lucky were the fourth car's passengers (a Corbellini too). The coach turned to a side, and a rail section raised by the previous cars entered its floor, lifting the car and piercing its body. Most of the 13 people killed were caused by the steel rail. The last three cars luckily managed to stay upside. Fifth car was on a small bridge above a stream, who sustained little to no damage when the coach skewed slightly. Rescue operations A two-axle Corbellini coach First response came from Castel Bolognese railwaymen, led by senior station master Giovanni Tarlazzi. Alerted by the crash, they left their homes and posts to run to the scene, providing immediate relief to the wounded. Chief Shunter Romano Corelli managed to break the right-hand glass of the cabin, smashing it with a stone and allowing the engineers to flee the crushed cockpit. Survivors were roaming the scene in shock, impairing rescue operations. Some tried to recover their luggage well before the rescue operations were over and the wreckage safe. No central emergency management existed at the time in Italy, so rescue was provided mostly by volunteers and nearby hospital, with little coordination. Responders later denounced lack of stretchers, torches and spreaders. Ambulances were called from Imola, Faenza and other towns, more than needed and getting in each other's way. After more people from a nearby town joined the efforts, searching for survivors and removing the deceased from the wreck, railwaymen Balestrazzi and Monti begun work on re-establishing the northern track to get the railway back to at least minimal service condition. Survivors from the train saw the railwaymen, and menaced them thinking they were responsible for the disaster. They had to rush back to their depot, and wait until survivors were evacuated. Many people were initially deemed missing, and the nearby stream was searched fearing someone had been thrown out of the coaches and could have drowned. Those fears resulted groundless. The corpses were stored in the nearby San Francesco church, still undergoing rebuilding works after World War II: this was the first opening of the sanctuary after the war's end in 1945, and the only one before being ultimately finished three years later. Auction As customary, owners of the goods shipped in the luggage cars claimed damages and were reimbursed, while the surviving perishable goods were auctioned off by the railway operator Ferrovie dello Stato. Among the recovered perishable goods there was cow meat, fish, rabbits, poultry and truffles. The shoes were recovered and sent to the central Lost and Found office. A shocked dog was found in the station, most probably a survivor from the disaster. It was kept by the railwaymen and nicknamed Carlone after a station porter. The dog lived in the station, but was terrorized by the tracks Aftermath Blame was put on engineer Ennio Covacci, who was found guilty of multiple involuntary killing. According to the sentence, the derailment was caused by Covacci missing a speed limit, most probably due to an unusual signaling used at the time: the green signal allowed for full speed, except for some limits stated on the special M40 bulletin. Covacci received the bulletin but misread some limitations. The Corbellini car into the Borgo's field was recovered by means of a heavy-load crane. Initially set upside into a road, was later raised on new bogies taken from the scrapyard. A short rail was built to bring it back to the tracks.

Reception The album was panned by critics upon release, with reviewers criticising the lack of original content and the clumsiness with which the band attempted to emulate popular acts of the 1990s. On Metacritic, the album received a score of 34/100, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\".

Kahanaff wrote in English, although she is best known for a cycle of essays, ‚ÄúA Generation of Levantines,‚Äù that was published in Israel in Hebrew translation in 1959. These pieces lay out her notion of ‚ÄúLevantinism,‚Äù a social model of coexistence drawn from her childhood experiences in Egyptian cosmopolitan society in the interwar period.  Biography  Jacqueline Shohet was born in May 1917 in Cairo. Her father, Joseph Shohet, was an Iraqi Jew who had moved to Egypt as a child, while her mother, Yvonne Chemla, was born in Egypt to Tunisian Jewish parents. Her mother's family established the department store Chemla Fr√®res. In 1940, Jacqueline Shohet moved to the United States with her first husband, Izzy Margoliash. After the marriage ended, she moved to New York where she earned a degree in journalism from Columbia University. In 1952 she married Alexander Kahanoff in Paris. Two years later they moved to Israel, first settling in Beersheba, and then relocating to the Tel Aviv suburbs. Jacqueline Kahanoff died in October 1979.  Writing career  While in the United States, Kahanoff began publishing fiction. Her stories ‚ÄúCairo Wedding‚Äù (Tomorrow, 1945) and ‚ÄúSuch is Rachel‚Äù (Atlantic Monthly, 1946) were the first to appear. In 1951 she published a novel, Jacob‚Äôs Ladder. After she settled in Israel she turned to journalism and personal narrative essays. Her 1958 article ‚ÄúReflections of a Levantine Jew‚Äù published in the American Jewish journal Jewish Frontier caught the attention of Nessim Rejwan, an anglophone Iraqi-Jewish writer also living in Israel. Rejwan introduced Kahanoff to Aharon Amir, who had just founded a journal Keshet (Rainbow). Amir took an interest in Kahanoff‚Äôs work and published a number of her essays in his journal, including the four-part ‚ÄúGeneration of Levantines‚Äù cycle, published in 1959. These essays include: ‚ÄúChildhood in Egypt,‚Äù ‚ÄúEurope from Afar,‚Äù ‚ÄúRebel, My Brother,‚Äù and ‚ÄúIsrael: Ambivalent Levantine.‚Äù Amir also translated Kahanoff‚Äôs work from English into Hebrew, although he is never credited with these translations in print. Near the end of her life, Amir also edited a collection of her most influential essays published under the title Mi mizrah shemesh (From East the Sun, 1978). To date there are two posthumous collections of her writings Bein shnei ‚Äòolamot (Between Two Worlds, 2005) and Mongrels or Marvels: The Levantine Writings of Jacqueline Shohet Kahanoff (2011). Kahanoff‚Äôs writings have influenced several generations of Israeli Jews of Sephardi and Mizrahi origins. As a testament to this influence, Jacqueline Kahanoff appears as a character in Ronit Matalon‚Äôs novel Ze ‚Äòim ha- panim eleinu (The One Facing Us), and two of Kahanoff‚Äôs essays are reprinted within the novel. The text of Kahanoff's \\"Europe from Afar\\" is also the basis for the video art piece of the same title by Eva Meyer and Eran Schaerf (2001). Kahanoff's writings were also an inspiration the Journal of Levantine Studies, which printed her essay \\"What about Levantinization?\\" it the inaugural issue.  Books  * Jacob‚Äôs Ladder.

The term \\"Dunkelfeld\\" is German for \\"dark field\\". The project began in Berlin in June 2005 with a large media campaign to contact pedophiles and hebephiles who wanted help from clinicians to manage their paraphilia. The campaign pledged medically confidential treatment free-of-charge. It was initially funded by the Volkswagen Foundation, and has been financially supported by the German government since 2008. The project's slogan is \\"You are not guilty because of your sexual desire, but you are responsible for your sexual behavior. There is help! Don't become an offender!\\" By 2010 a total of 1,134 people had responded. Of those 499 had a completed diagnosis, and 255 had been offered a place in therapy. More than half had previously attempted to find therapy without success. The therapy offered has three main components. Patients are encouraged to accept the fact that they have such sexual inclinations, integrate it into their self-concept, and involve relatives or partners in the therapeutic process. Cognitive behaviour therapy is used to improve coping skills, stress management, and sexual attitudes. Drugs that reduce general sex drive, such as serotonin reuptake inhibitors and anti-androgens, may also be offered.

Prior to the Act's passage, prisoners in the custody of one of the states who wished to challenge the legality of their detention could petition for a writ of habeas corpus only in state courts; the federal court system was barred from issuing writs of habeas corpus in their cases.Ex parte Dorr, . The Act also permitted the court \\"to go beyond the return\\" and question the truth of the jailer's stated justification for detaining the petitioning prisoner, whereas prior to the Act courts were technically bound to accept the jailer's word that the prisoner was actually being held for the reason stated. The Act largely restored habeas corpus following its 1863 suspension by Congress, ensuring that anyone arrested after its passage could challenge their detention in the federal courts, but denied habeas relief to anyone who was already in military custody for any military offense or for having aided the Confederacy. When the Habeas Corpus Act of 1867 is spoken of, it is usually this act that is meant. Another act dealing with habeas corpus was passed the same day and appears on the same page of the United States Statutes at Large, being the twenty-seventh rather than the twenty-eighth chapter. It amended the Habeas Corpus Suspension Act of 1863, which permitted (among other things) government officials charged with abusing their powers under the suspension of habeas corpus to have their cases heard at the federal rather than state level.An Act related to Habeas Corpus, and regulating judicial Proceedings in certain Cases, sess. iii, chap. 81, (1863).

It is rebroadcast on five booster stations, all on 97.5 MHz, in and around Salt Lake City. History Early Years KZNS-FM is considered a \\"move in\\" station. On June 11, 2003, the unbuilt station was licensed as KTPM, originally located in Franklin, Idaho, close to the border between Idaho and Utah.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2005 page D-167 At first, it was only a construction permit granted by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not actually on the air. Even before signing on, the station received FCC permission to move into the lucrative Salt Lake City radio market, from a location about 40 miles east of the city. On August 10, 2005, the station, still not on the air, changed its call sign to KFMS. The station was sold to Three Point Media for $1.5 million, with the potential to profit from its pending move into Utah.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2006 page D-162 The station finally signed on the air on September 3, 2006, now licensed to Coalville, Utah, and broadcasting from Humpy Peak.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2008 page D-544 On September 5, 2006, the station became KOAY and branded itself as \\"The Oasis,\\" carrying a Christian Contemporary music format. The Blaze On September 9, 2008, the station changed to active rock and became \\"The Blaze,\\" with the call letters becoming KZZQ. The Blaze had previously been located on 94.9 with the call sign KHTB, which subsequently became the call sign for a new active rock station in Provo, called 94.9 Z-Rock (now Top 40 KENZ). Reportedly, The Blaze had almost been shut down, but was able to continue, using the Blaze moniker because its owner, Citadel Broadcasting, failed to acquire the naming rights.AllAccess.com \\"The Blaze Moves Up The Dial\\" April 11, 2008. Retrieved 6/5/2019 However, on this date, due to poor ratings (possibly as a result of competition against Z-Rock), The Blaze changed to what it called a \\"Rockin' Hits\\" format. However, this new format was met with even poorer ratings and negative response from the station's longtime listeners. A tribute concert for the Blaze by local artists took place shortly after the format flip. The Blaze was one of three active rock radio stations in Salt Lake City, along with 94.9 Z-Rock and KBER 101 (KBER). On December 1, 2010, The Blaze's morning host, Roger \\"Big Rog\\" Orton, spent his shift protesting the station's new mainstream rock format by playing active rock songs. This protest was met with positive response from listeners, and the station received many supportive phone calls, song requests, e-mails, and Facebook messages. Several Facebook fan pages showing support for The Blaze also appeared and hundred listeners signed the radio station's van, which was spray-painted white to act as a petition for the station to return to the active rock format. The Blaze returned to playing active rock shortly afterwards. But the following year would see a change in ownership. The Zone In 2011, the station was acquired by the Larry H. Miller Communications Corporation. Miller owned a chain of car dealerships around Utah and the Western United States. He also owned the Utah Jazz basketball team. His goal was to own the radio stations that broadcast his team's games, running an all-sports format including shows discussing the Jazz.

It is now the location of a major highway intersection, and the site of a park-and-ride lot.  History  This crossroads was originally called Storyville, after one Augustus Story who settled in the area about 1837. It was later known as Blodgett or Blodgett's Corners, probably for one Chester Blodgett who arrived in 1843. The Watertown Plank Road between Milwaukee and Watertown was built through this area during 1848-54, and a spur to Waukesha in 1850. The current name comes from Frederick Goerke, blacksmith, wagonmaker, and innkeeper in this area in the 1870s. A post office was located there (under the name Blodgett) from 1885 to 1895, with Frederick Goerke as postmaster.\\"Term: Goerke's Corners [origin of place name]\\" Dictionary of Wisconsin History; access date July 19, 2011\\"Local History Index: Historic Places Index: Land Divisions Within Waukesha County: Town of Brookfield ~ Goerke's Corners (Sections 29-30)\\" Sussex-Lisbon Area Historical Society, Inc. website; access date July 19, 2011 The first segment of Interstate 94 through this area was opened in 1958.State Highway Commission of Wisconsin, \\"Official Dedication Program of the State Highway Commission of Wisconsin for the opening of the first completed segment of Interstate Highway 94 in Waukesha County, Sept. 4, 1958\\" By the late 20th century, this intersection, now involving Wisconsin Highway 164, U.S. Route 18 and Interstate 94, had become one of the busiest in southeastern Wisconsin, and is the westernmost major waypoint in local radio and television traffic reports. It is the site of a park-and-ride lot used by Badger Bus, the Milwaukee County Transit System, and others. The former site of the settlement is now taken up by shopping centers, office buildings and their parking lots. Although obscure, Goerke's Corners had its moment of pop culture fame. In the 1949 movie It's a Great Feeling, Hollywood hopeful Judy Adams (Doris Day) proudly states that she grew up there.

Curtis appears from the series inception and was the only original character to appear in all of the first four series. Curtis is sentenced to community service after being caught in possession of cocaine and later gains the power of time manipulation when involved in a freak storm. He has also been involved in relationships with Alisha Daniels (Antonia Thomas) and later with Nikki (Ruth Negga). Curtis later gains the power to swap biological sex, followed by the ability to resurrect people from the dead. While in female form, Curtis is portrayed by Kehinde Fadipe. Stewart-Jarrett left the show in the fourth episode of the fourth series when the character was killed off. Casting and character creation Casting for the part was announced on 17 August 2009 by Digital Spy. Stewart-Jarett went through an audition process for the part in which he commented on saying \\"I always thought your audition for drama school was meant to be the hardest you would ever do, but Misfits trumped that. I had to get through four auditions and five meetings before I got the part. The fourth audition was the worst. They placed around 20 of us in a house in Fitzrovia and we all had to work in groups so they could see the dynamics between us. We started in the morning and as the day wore on people were plucked out one by one and sent home. It was quite brutal\\". Fellow cast member Iwan Rheon revealed that Overman who created the character discussed how to write their parts with the cast and later began writing for them as actors. Stewart-Jarett added that Overman \\"gave us a licence to do that and it was actually quite nice in a way\\". Development Characterisation Nathan Stewart-Jarrett (pictured) described Curtis as a \\"Serious guy\\" who has a \\"real sense of frustration\\" about him. E4's official website depicts him as \\"a rising sports star whose goal was to compete in the 2012 Olympics. But his career is left in tatters after he‚Äôs caught with an illegal substance and is publicly shamed as he‚Äôs made an example under the eyes of the law\\". Stewart- Jarrett described the character as \\"a serious guy. He's disappointed in himself and the demise of his athletic aspirations. There's a real sense of frustration about the character it's like he's a fallen angel\\". The Times described him as a \\"shamed athlete who can stop and rewind time\\" a description which is similarly used by The Daily Telegraph who describes him as a \\"shamed sports star\\". Storylines When buying drugs at a club, Curtis is caught along with his girlfriend Sam (Anna Koval). Curtis is given community service and a two-year ban from athletics, while Sam takes the fall and is sent to prison. Curtis is caught in a storm which grants him the power of time travel, a gift that, like all the other misfits, stems from his main personality trait: Wanting to go back and never have the drug bust happen. In episode 2 of series 1 Curtis flirts with Alisha Daniels (Antonia Thomas). Alisha uses her power of forcing those she touches to go into a sexual frenzy on Curtis and they have sex. Curtis becomes angry with Alisha. Alisha proceeds to go to the park with Ben (Jamie Davis). Because of Alisha's power's influence over Ben, he attempts to rape Alisha. Curtis arrives and attempts to stop Ben, but after touching Alisha joins in in attempting to rape Alisha. Alisha escapes and after a heart to heart with Curtis, the pair agree on a non-physical relationship. Sam is released from prison and when she comes to meet Curtis, he feels guilty which causes him to rewind time. Curtis attempts to change the events leading up to her arrest and after a few attempts he successfully achieves this. In order to be able to save the group from Tony (Danny Sapani/Louis Decosta Johnson), however, he must get community service by getting caught with the drugs while Sam is not, sacrificing his athletics career. He realises that because Sam didn't go to prison he is now in a relationship with both Sam and Alisha. Curtis ends his relationship with Sam.

Curtis and Nikki kiss after being held hostage and later begin a relationship. Curtis plays out the events he witnessed when he travelled to the future. Brian (Jordan Metcalfe) goes public about his power. The group are also forced to go public. Brian becomes angry after others receive more attention than him and begins killing people, including Kelly, Nikki and Alisha.

Angered, Curtis tells her he will go over to his apartment and make sure it doesn't happen again. However, Lola warns him that Jake is unhinged and he'd need to take protection. She offered him a gun, an offer he initially refused. Still, he takes it and bursts into the apartment, accidentally killing Jake after a short brawl. Feeling guilty and shamed, Curtis begins to suspect Lola is not all that she seems and decided to use his resurrection power to bring back Jake and find out the truth. However, he is bitten in the process turning into a zombie himself. After witnessing Finn finish off Jake and hiding his secret from the rest, Curtis begins to feed on small animals. However, despite his best efforts, Rudy finds out and regrettably reveals to the others they were going to have to kill him. Meanwhile, Curtis finds out that the apparent trainee probation worker was an aspiring actress, struck by the storm, who turned into her femme fatale character, Lola. Before he can do anything to help her, however, events transpire to make her current boyfriend believe Curtis has begun to stalk and harm her. Being suddenly knocked unconscious on his way home, Curtis reawakens in a disused factory ruin. It is here, that he meets Lola after she kills her current boyfriend and Curtis, making it seem like the two fought over her. But, Curtis, unaffected by the bullet, springs up, biting and killing Lola with her own gun. Then, after a brief saddened call from Rudy begging him to reconsider his next move, Curtis shoots himself in the head, ending the curse but also his life.Misfits S4 Ep4 Curtis' death is then mentioned briefly in the next episode as a suicide.Misfits S4 Ep5 Reception Stewart-Jarrett was nominated for Outstanding Actor in the fiction category at the Monte-Carlo Television Festival in 2011. Den Of Geek described Nathan as \\"an all-round good egg, is Curtis, and his relationship with Alisha is lovely, if a little bizarre\\". Tim Dowling of The Guardian described him as the \\"angry one\\" of the group of \\"foul-mouthed young criminals\\". Neela Debnath of The Independent said she felt Curtis \\"drew the short straw\\" because of his power. Debnath reviewed the second episode of series 3 saying that the episode brought Curtis to the \\"forefont\\". She added that Curtis's power is \\"far from the A-list of superpowers\\" but it gives Curtis \\"a fresh perspective on life\\". Debnath felt that even though Curtis did not choose his power \\"it became very personal and helped to develop his character\\". She felt that for a long time Curtis had remained as the \\"moody ex-athlete who was consumed with regret and a yearning for his old life\\" but by the end of the episode \\"he had gained a sense of closure and was ready to move on\\". Commenting on Stewart-Jarrett's performance Debnath said he had \\"always given a good performance\\" but because Curtis has always been \\"stuck in a rut of remorse means that he has been very limited\\" but hoped the character's change would allow the viewers to see a different side to his acting skills. Debnath also commented on Fadipe's performance saying it was \\"equally as strong\\" as Stewart-Jarrett's. She felt that although two actors portrayed the role, \\"it was Curtis who was always present\\". Debnath felt Curtis's vulnerability as Melissa was \\"refreshing\\" and when he was nearly raped it made the episode \\"incredibly sinister\\". Debnath added that when Stewart-Jarett is given a \\"weightier role\\" in series 3's fourth episode he \\"more than fulfilled\\" it. The Guardian commented on Curtis impregnating himself saying it was one of \\"Misfits' masterful twists\\". Jordan Farley of SFX felt that \\"Curtis doesn‚Äôt really contribute much (again)\\" and that his plot in which he is subject to racial prejudice by a blind girl \\"seems engineered to push controversy buttons, but ends on a frustrating note given that Ally‚Äôs inexplicable racism is never resolved\\". Digital Spy journalist Catriona Wightman felt that Curtis \\"should really be in the middle of the action; instead, his major contribution to the instalment is that he has a bit of a flirt with 'trainee probation worker' Lola [...] Unsurprisingly, this ends up with the duo doing the dirty at the end of the episode\\".

He first appeared in Series 1 Episode 1 and departed in an webisode entitled \\"Vegas Baby!\\" after Sheehan quit the role. He serves as one of the main protagonists of the show. Nathan is given community service where he is caught up in a storm which gave him the power of immortality. Nathan has also been involved in a romantic relationship with Kelly Bailey (Lauren Socha). Sheehan has been nominated for a BAFTA for his role as Nathan. Casting and character creation Casting for the part was announced on 17 August 2009 by Digital Spy. Fellow cast member Iwan Rheon revealed that Overman who created the character discussed how to write their parts with the cast and later began writing for them as actors. Misfit's executive producer Petra Fried announced Robert Sheehan's decision to leave at the Kapow convention in London on 10 April 2011. His departure was addressed in an online webisode titled Vegas Baby! that debuted on the Misfits website on 15 September. On his decision to leave Sheehan said \\"It's nice that the show's successful but it doesn't mean complete blind and unadmonished loyalty - 'If something is very successful you should stick to it like a barnacle!' That's definitely not my thinking. I think I've made the right decision, yeah\\". On a possible return Sheehan said \\"There's no point in saying never. It holds a very fond little place in my heart. No, it's been a great big part of my life and there's no point in turning your back on something completely. I'm not doing that, I would never say never\\". Development Characterisation E4's official website describes Nathan as having \\"an answer for everything, sarcastic wit, and a fondness for pushing things too far\\" and that \\"underneath the cocky quips and sarcasm, Nathan isn‚Äôt as unemotionally untouchable as he makes out\\". Tim Dowling of The Guardian described him as the \\"Irish one who talks too much\\" of the group of \\"foul- mouthed young criminals\\". Digital Spy described him as a \\"smart aleck\\". The Metro described him as \\"hyperactive\\" and \\"irritating as hell\\". The Independent described Nathan as \\"cheeky\\" before later branding him \\"the annoying gobby lad\\". Storylines Nathan steals some pick 'n' mix from a bowling alley and continues to aggravate the situation. He causes a disruption and when the manager threatens to phone the police he tells him to do so before stapling him in the hand. Nathan is given community service for this disruption. While on his first day of community service, Nathan is caught in a storm. He appears unaffected, unlike those he is doing community service with. Nathan's mother, Louise (Michelle Fairley), kicks him out of his house for his behaviour towards his step-father, Jeremy (Jo Stone-Fewings). Nathan begins living in the community centre. The group kill Tony (Danny Sapani/Louis Decosta Johnson), as an act of self-defense, and bury him. Nathan sleeps with Ruth (Amy Beth Hayes/Clare Welch) who he discovers has been affected by the storm and is really 82 years old. In an alternate timeline, the group are killed because Curtis Donovan (Nathan Stewart-Jarrett) used his power of time travel to change the events, preventing him from ending up in community service; Nathan, however, survives and is told that when found by paramedics he was almost dead. Rachel (Jessica Brown Findlay) begins manipulating people into behaving how she wants through her power of suggestion. Nathan kidnaps Rachel using a gun and takes her to the roof of the community centre. She can't or won't revert those back to their original state and she realises Nathan's gun is only a water pistol. She and Nathan brawl before both falling to their deaths. After Nathan's funeral he wakes up in his coffin, realising he is immortal. The group dig Nathan up after they receive a message from Superhoodie. Lucy (Evelyn Hoskins) begins causing trouble for the gang. Kelly Bailey (Lauren Socha) agrees to have sex with Nathan after months of flirting. Lucy, who is a shape shifter, takes on Kelly's form and causes trouble between the pair. Nathan discovers he has a younger brother, Jamie (Sam Keeley). Jamie and Lily (Catrin Stewart) join the group at a nightclub where they take drugs, reversing their powers. Lily's power of cryokinesis is reversed to pyrokinesis and while in a car with Jamie she sets fire to it, killing them both. Nathan, who also has the power of mediumship, sees Jamie's ghost who leads him to his father and they decide to give their relationship another try. Nathan falls in love with Simon Bellamy (Iwan Rheon) after Vince (Nathan Constance) uses his power to tattoo people and control how they feel. Nathan and Kelly decide to consummate their relationship, but Kelly changes her mind when she decides that it would be best if they were just friends. Nathan is killed and deduces it was Jessica (Zawe Ashton) who killed him. When Jessica shows interest in Simon, Nathan tries to warn him off, but Simon does not believe him. They later realise Dave (Adrian Rawlins) is responsible. Brian (Jordan Metcalfe) goes public about his power. The group are exposed and become famous. Brian becomes jealous of the group's fame and begins killing them. He reduces Nathan to a state of vegetation although Curtis rewinds this timeline. Nathan begins a relationship with Marnie (Gwyneth Keyworth), who is pregnant but has no clue who the father of her child is. To support her and her baby, he sells his power of immortality to Seth (Matthew McNulty). As a result of this Nikki (Ruth Negga) is killed. The group steal money that Elliot (Edward Hogg) has collected while falsely claiming to be Jesus Christ reborn to buy new super powers. In Vegas Baby! Nathan along with Marnie and Nathan Junior are staying in Vegas. Using his new power he begins scamming the casinos by using his power to make the dice land on all the right numbers. He is caught out when he uses his power to cheat to get eleven on the dice although he uses the numbers four and seven. He runs back to the hotel room but is eventually caught where he bids farewell to Nathan Junior. Nathan now in an orange jumpsuit is imprisoned and uses his one free call to phone Simon. Rudy Wade (Joseph Gilgun) picks up and states that he is the new guy and he doesn't know a Barry before hanging up. Nathan is last seen being dragged away from the phone by the police to a cell while shouting \\"Save me, Barry!\\" Reception Robert Sheehan's performance as Nathan has been well received. Sheehan was nominated for a BAFTA for his portrayal of Nathan but lost out to Martin Freeman who stars in Sherlock. Sheehan was nominated for Outstanding Actor in the fiction category at the Monte-Carlo Television Festival in 2011. The Herald described him as a \\"curly haired Irish smart alec called Nathan (Robert Sheehan), to whom writer Howard Overman has given all the best lines\\". The Guardian also commented that \\"So far his only power seems to be the gift of incessant back- chat. Played by Robert Sheehan, he's the breakout star of the show\\". The Daily Telegraph describes him as \\"Motormouth Nathan was the pivot here, prodding, challenging and provoking the others into revealing themselves\\". The Independent responded to the character saying he was \\"clearly the most quotable of the quintet\\". After Nathan decides to join the circus so he can be repeatedly killed they added \\"Quite right: who'd really get all superhero-ish just because they've got some powers?\\" The Metro described him as a \\"cult hero\\". MSN News described Nathan saying he was \\"undoubtedly the star of the show\\". The Guardian described Sheehan as the \\"leading light of E4's Asbo superheroes drama\\", describing him as a \\"cocky motormouth\\" before questioning \\"Can Misfits survive without Nathan?\\" After the character's exit was confirmed, Digital Spy commented that he was \\"much-loved\\". Keith Watson of the Metro commented positively on his exit saying \\"rather than dismiss this key character with a couple of lines of mumbled dialogue, his farewell is deftly handled in an online mini-drama all of his own\\" saying his time on the show was spent \\"bemoaning being short-changed in the superpower department ‚Äì finally cashes in the chips on his shoulder\\" before adding \\"he‚Äôs going to leave a Misfits-shaped hole in my heart\\". Neela Debnath of the Independent spoke of Sheehan's departure upon the beginning of the third series saying the absence of Nathan, who she described as \\"universally popular and well-liked\\", was the \\"starkest\\" difference in the series. Debnath expressed that although for a large number of people Nathan was \\"the most entertaining character on the show\\" because of his \\"schoolboy humour and penchant for annoying everyone but the audience\\" his departure did not detract from the quality of the show. The Guardian branded Nathan their \\"favourite cocky yet lovable and immortal character\\" but after Rudy's entrance questioned \\"As for that void after Nathan left?

Simon was sentenced to community service for attempted arson which leads to him gaining the power of invisibility, reflective of his personality in that he often feels ignored. Simon has been involved in a storyline which saw him manipulated by his probation worker who he murders. In the third series finale Simon travels to the past and Rheon later confirmed that he would not be returning for the fourth series. Casting and character creation Casting for the part was announced on 17 August 2009 by Digital Spy. Rheon helped writer Overman to create the character and commented that \\"we had a sit around the table with Howard the writer and he was very open to suggestions and you can see later on he really started writing for us as actors\\". Rheon later said that \\"Director Tom Green and I decided we‚Äôd base him on Ian Curtis, so he‚Äôs cool and has his own story, he‚Äôs the kind of character you really get to know if you talk to him about music, something that he really cares about. It‚Äôs not so much Ian Curtis as an individual we were aiming for, more the idea of his music. The feel of Joy Division, that depth\\". On 20 December 2011 Rheon confirmed that he would not be returning for the fourth series of Misfits. Rheon added that he was \\"grateful for the opportunity\\" given to him by Misfits and the \\"fun I had doing it\\".

Superhoodie On how Simon develops into Superhoodie, Rheon said \\"you do see him become a lot more confident and having this ambition to become this superhero character\\" but felt the character \\"needs to finish that journey to becoming the Superhoodie character\\". On playing both present and future Simon he also said \\"It was a great challenge. And also to kind of try and make the present Simon become the future Simon, if you know what I mean - have all those little beats where you can show a little flicker of it... The difficulty was - because the statuses were going from one to, like, ten - to then also keep that sense of Simon in that really confident character. That was quite a challenge\\". Rheon felt Simon changed most of all of the show's characters. Rheon felt the show could have \\"done more\\" with the Superhoodie storyline but enjoyed the storyline as it developed. Storylines Simon is bullied by Matt (Jamie Blackley) while at school. Matt texts Simon asking him to meet him at a bar. Matt tells Simon he 'accidentally' texted him, embarrassing and angering Simon.

Tim Dowling of The Guardian described him as the \\"weird one\\" of the group of \\"foul-mouthed young criminals\\". The Guardian described him as a \\"Moody loner, who turns invisible\\". Neela Debnath, writing for The Independent, commented that even though in a parallel universe the Nazis won the war the characters remained the same where Simon worked for the Nazis but \\"was conflicted, on the one hand he had to follow orders but on the other hand he found it difficult because he knew that what he was doing was wrong\\". Digital Spy felt that Simon's relationship with Alisha was \\"extremely touching\\" and added that the relationship included \\"one of the best sex scenes on television this year\\".

I love playing the part\\". Socha later added \\"I do like playing Kelly - she's a bit outgoing and says it how it is, when I was younger I was a bit like her, a bit chavvy\\" before adding that she thought the character was \\"likeable, isn't she?\\" Fellow cast member Iwan Rheon revealed that Overman who created the character discussed how to write their parts with the cast and later began writing for them as actors. Characterisation Lauren Socha (pictured) uses her natural Derby accent for the part which she discussed with production on how strong to make. E4's official website describes Kelly as \\"wading in fist first. Her attitude is her suit of armour, accessorised with enough gold jewellery to really do some harm, and acrylics that could have your eyes out. Behind that veneer though, Kelly‚Äôs got a heart of gold and is fiercely loyal.\\" The Times commented that she was \\"the chavish girl who can read minds\\". The Daily Telegraph describes her as \\"bolshy Midlands chav Kelly\\". Socha described the character as \\"Kelly is a standard beeyatch. She's wicked.\\" and admitted she can relate to the character.

They added that her initial power is because she is \\"Self-conscious of her image\\" but that her later power is useless as \\"no employer will take her seriously because of her scraped back hair and working class East Midlands accent\\". They added that she is the \\"perfect foil\\" to Nathan. Kelly has been described as having a \\"chav accent\\". Socha uses her natural Derby accent for the part. Socha has admitted she has to discuss how strong to make her accent for the part and said she finds it \\"tricky\\" using her accent \\"because I can say things and I just sound stupid when I say them\\". Storylines Kelly is given community service for starting a fight with Jodi (Bunmi Mojekwu). Kelly begins community service with other young offenders Nathan (Robert Sheehan), Simon (Iwan Rheon), Curtis (Nathan Stewart-Jarrett), Alisha (Antonia Thomas) and Gary (Josef Altin).

Kelly is killed and through Nathan's mediumship warns him of Brian's plans. Curtis reverses time and Kelly is revived. Kelly sells her power to Seth (Matthew McNulty) for ¬£20,000. The group decides to regain their powers after Nikki (Ruth Negga) is killed, which could have been prevented had they had their powers. They decide to purchase different powers from their original powers. Kelly gains the power of specified human intelligence which means she can design rockets, although she initially thought the power would give her intelligence in more than one area.

Reception Tim Dowling of The Guardian described her as the \\"chavvy one\\" of the group of \\"foul-mouthed young criminals\\". Neela Debnath of The Independent commented that it \\"does not make sense\\" that her power \\"has not elevated her intelligence to the levels of MENSA\\" and that while Kelly can \\"draw complex blueprints for rockets\\" it was odd that \\"she does not know what brunch is\\". Debnath added that \\"maybe her power will serve a purpose eventually\\". On Kelly's relationship with Seth, Debnath said it was \\"satisfying\\" adding that the pair have \\"an underplayed chemistry which works because both of them are guarded characters, neither of whom wants to lose face\\". She added that \\"It was nice to see Kelly‚Äôs love life resuscitated after her disappointing ‚Äòlike-a-cousin‚Äô moment with Nathan and her fleeting romance with Bruno, the escaped monkey who turned into a human but ended up getting shot\\". The Guardian commented on Kelly saying she has been \\"once more been a wonderful character to watch\\" adding that a highlight was her \\"trying to convince an official of her new superpower that gives her the ability to design inter-continental ballistic missiles (\\"Yeah mate, check out the propulsion system. It's liquid nitrogen ‚Äì it's wicked\\")\\". Debnath felt that the character's offscreen exit in which Kelly \\"seems something very unlike the character\\". Morgan Jeffrey of Digital Spy wrote that Kelly's exit was \\"a somewhat unlikely farewell for Lauren Socha's loveable loud-mouth\\". Simon Cocks of MSN also reacted unfavourably to the method in which Kelly was written out, describing it as a \\"lowlight\\" of the episode explaining: \\"The explanation of Kelly's whereabouts is necessary, but still feels odd and forced.

On receiving the part Thomas said she felt \\"lucky\\" that the casting directors \\"took a chance\\" on her. Director Tom Green felt that Alisha could have read one way but Thomas brought a \\"much more complex character\\" and added more \\"vulnerability\\" to Alisha. He added that Thomas brought \\"another depth\\" to the character. Thomas said she and other cast members were undecided on returning for a third series, adding that it is \\"quite difficult so early on to make a decision for next year and to know what you‚Äôre doing.

The cast said they felt their characters were metaphors for what teenagers went through.

Tim Dowling of The Guardian described her as the \\"slutty one\\" of the group of \\"foul-mouthed young criminals\\".

At a later date, Alisha is pulled over by a police officer while drunk driving and although she attempts to flirt with the police officer, she is given community service.

Reception Thomas received overwhelming positive reception for her portrayal, many noting her ability to bring sympathy, depth and likability to the character. Thomas was nominated for Outstanding Actress in the fiction category at the Monte-Carlo Television Festival in 2011 for her portrayal of Alisha. The Guardian felt Alisha gave them \\"something to cheer about\\" as she is a female character in a British science fiction serial who doesn't \\"exist just to be rescued\\". They added that Alisha's \\"notorious \\"sex power\\", meanwhile, proved problematic for feminists everywhere ‚Äì and deeply uncomfortable to watch. Yet her role as the reluctant observer forced her to learn about herself. In choosing her new power (which allows her to see what other people are doing) and a relationship with Simon, she's also chosen to embrace both the superhero life and her own vulnerability, despite knowing that disaster likely awaits in both. The ability to put herself in others' shoes reflects her newfound empathy and her determination not to lose it, while putting her at the plotting heart of the gang's shenanigans. Not bad for the formerly untouchable party girl\\". They added that throughout the first series of Misfits, Alisha \\"certainly wasn't nice\\". The Guardian also felt given Alisha's initial ability, Nathan \\"be better off without one\\". Neela Debnath, writing for The Independent, commented that even though in a parallel universe the Nazis won the war the characters remained the same where Alisha \\"remained a sexual object and had to use her womanly wiles to survive\\". Digital Spy felt that Alisha's relationship with Simon was \\"extremely touching\\" and added that the relationship included \\"one of the best sex scenes on television this year\\". Writing for The Guardian Tim Dowling said \\"Alisha‚Äôs infatuation with him [Simon] gives rise to a love scene that I can only describe as extremely grown-up\\". On Alisha's exit Digital Spy said it was \\"difficult to overestimate what a shock this was - Alisha lies in Simon's arms bleeding out as the other Misfits stand stock still, devastated and shocked and in tears. Eventually, Alisha dies and it's so, so, so sad\\". They added that they \\"loved\\" Alisha's speech to Tony telling him the group had tried their best because it made \\"what was to come all the more shocking\\".

Prohibition was valid only within state buildings and was grounded on the need to prevent accidents. Smoking in Greece was at the highest rate of tobacco consumption (more than 40%) in the European Union in 2010. In 2014, Greece had the highest rate of smoking in the European Union. According to a survey published by the European Commission Day for World No Tobacco Day in 2017, 37% of Greeks are smokers and only 44% of Greeks have never smoked a cigarette, the smallest percentage in the EU. After Greece, France and Bulgaria have the next largest number of smokers with 36%. At 7%, Sweden had the lowest rate. 2010 smoking ban Since older legislation was not effective, a new, stricter law was passed. With effect of 1 September 2010, this law banned smoking and the consumption of tobacco products by other means, in all work places, transport stations, taxis and passenger ships (smoking was already prohibited on trains, buses and aeroplanes), as well as in all enclosed public places including restaurants, night clubs, etc., without any exception. Casinos and bars bigger than 300 m¬≤ were given eight months to apply the law. Smoking is also prohibited in atria and internal areas with removable roof covers or tents as well as in external seating areas that are surrounded by a tent and are not open from at least two sides. Fines are particularly heavy for smokers who do not comply (fines range from 50‚Ç¨ to 500‚Ç¨) as well as for work places or companies, i.e. restaurants, night clubs, pubs, etc. (fines range from 500‚Ç¨ to 10,000‚Ç¨). For those companies that violate the law for the fifth time in a row, the law requires the closure of the company. As with the previous law, this new one is also not implemented and smoking is in reality permitted in the most public places in Greece. Signage indicating the smoking ban legislation is commonly ignored. The only exception to the law is airports. There, smoking is only permitted in special separated smoking booths equipped with separate ventilation systems and air filters. Currently only Athens International Airport has installed such booths: one in the extra- Schengen arrival area before passport control and one in the intra-Schengen baggage reclaim area, both smoking booths are accessible only to arriving passengers. In all other Greek airports no such smoking booths have been installed and smoking is totally prohibited inside the terminal buildings. A websitewww.smokestop.gov.gr , now not in service, and a telephone hotline for information as well as citizens to report any violations of the new law (tel: 1142) along with an extensive media campaign were created to promote the 1 September smoking ban in Greece. Effects of the smoking ban Even eight years after the second phase of the ban supposedly went into effect, in July 2011, there is little evidence of the culture changing. Based on a pamphlet distributed in January 2018 by the Ministry of Health, strict fines are in place for those smoking illegally. The manager of every space that violates the anti-smoking ban, for vendors of tobacco products to those underage and for those violating the advertising laws for tobacco products could be fined between 500 and 10,000‚Ç¨. On a shop's fourth violation, its licence is suspended for ten days, while after the fifth violation it is revoked permanently. Furthermore, the law states that a driver may be fined up to 1,500‚Ç¨ for smoking with a minor (under 12 years of age) on board, regardless of who was smoking and it may be doubled if it is a public sector vehicle, such as a bus. Drivers may have their licences suspended for a month after each violation. However, these are almost never enforced, because they are almost never reported. It is obvious that university buildings, caf√©s, bars and even hospital offices are not smoke-free areas. According to the Municipality of Athens, they do not carry out regular checks, due to limits in their staff numbers. The municipality has received minimal complaints, because people are disillusioned and do not believe that the law will be enforced. They would only investigate the issue further had more complaints or threats to sue been received. Greece-Harvard Anti-Smoking Initiative The government signed an agreement with Harvard University to help in developing the government's anti-tobacco policies and mounting publicity campaigns. The Harvard School of Public Health will also help Greece conduct research, organize conferences and train all the officials who will be involved in imposing the ban. The Hellenic Action through Research Against Tobacco, known as HEART, has conducted clinical research on the impact of smoking, especially on pregnant women, the effects of second-hand smoke and assessing whether creating a draft and ventilation or opening windows and doors does eliminate exposure to second hand smoke thus far. The initiative also plans to raise awareness with children, as early as elementary school and create a smoke-free environment on all school grounds across the country.

Biography Early life Cathy Grier was born in Ogdensburg, New York, where her engineer father helped build the St. Lawrence Bridge. Her family then moved to Connecticut, and her career as a guitar soloist started in 1977 as a senior at Coginchaug High School. In 1979, while working on a music degree at Housatonic Community College in Bridgeport, she formed her own band. A year later, she teamed up with singer/songwriter Lenore Troia after meeting in Paul Leka‚Äôs Connecticut Recording Studio, where Cathy was worked to repay the recording of her first demo learning audio engineering in the process. In 1980, Grier enrolled in the Berklee College Summer Program and then began to tour with Troia that fall. Troia/Grier and ‚ÄúStudents of Life‚Äù (1980-1987) In 1981, Troia/Grier formed Synergy Records and recorded their first album, titled ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Let the First Time be the Last Time,‚Äù at Studio 19 in Glastonbury, CT. They toured colleges and east coast clubs, opened for larger acts, and were videotaped for Newsweek Broadcasting's syndicated television Show, ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs Woman‚Äù in April, 1982. In 1983, Troia/Grier recorded ‚ÄúGut Reaction,‚Äù their second self-produced album, at Media Sound in New York. The album received a Rising Star feature in the International Rockbill magazine (11/1984). In 1984, the Troia/Grier Band performed in New York City clubs, opened for The Band at The Lone Star Caf√©, and continued to reach larger audiences. In 1985, after touring the east coast, Troia/Grier were videotaped live for Connecticut's top music video show, Soundtraxx. They then produced their first music video, titled ‚ÄúBreaking New Ground,‚Äù which they submitted to MTV as a group named ‚ÄúStudents of Life.‚Äù The video won MTV‚Äôs basement tape competition in October 1986.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=38xggIcgPDU Students of Life‚Äôs style and sound found their way to Atlantic City. Riding the wave of the MTV generation and bolstered by their MTV basement tape win, critics heralded them as the new breed of casino bands. They first performed at Trump Castle in 1985 and later at Bally‚Äôs Casino from 1986-1988. Aware of the pressures and stress of a decade‚Äôs involvement in the industry, Grier moved to Key West (a frequent touring location for Troia/Grier) to unwind and soon rediscovered her solo career. Key West solo career Finding a need to branch out musically in Key West, Grier took leave from Students of Life. She recorded two live solo tapes, Moonlighting in Key West (1988) and Community (1989) as tributes to her newfound community, and opened for Laura Nyro at Strand Theater (1989). In 1990, she moved back to New York City, where she formed a group and recorded her self=produced album titled ‚ÄúNew York Sessions.‚Äù France In the six years that followed, Grier traveled to Europe where she toured 100 cities in a Marlboro Music Night Show and wrote and adapted music and lyrics for several French and European recording artists. In 1991, Indra, a Carrere artist, hit #1 on the French dance charts with a Grier penned album. Then, Grier recorded an album titled Solo (1993), which was released on her own label Shane Music. In 1995, London's Time Out magazine called her music ‚Äúfunkily melodic in a mature and assured style.‚Äù Grier returned her focus to New York City in 1996, where she produced and adapted to English an album for EMI artist Nilda Fernandez. Retracing In 1998, Grier released Retracing, a 13-song CD recorded in Key West to positive reviews, which praised her music and message. Time Out New York wrote, ‚ÄúGrier mixes folked-up blues with a political mind- set.‚Äù The Hudson Current added, ‚ÄúOne aspect that distinguishes her from other performers is her concern with political and environmental issues, layered over that blues/rock melodic base.‚Äù The album was mostly recorded live and self-produced with back up from local studio musicians and released on her Shane Music label. Comin' Back to Me In 2002, Grier released Comin‚Äô Back to Me, a solo album, to greater exposure and acclaim. She was featured on Mag Rack‚Äôs Guitar Xpress, which has also showcased artists including: The Spin Doctors, Trey Anastasio, and Les Paul. Vintage Guitar magazine wrote, ‚ÄúPlaying songs with just your acoustic is certainly an art that some of us never master well enough to make a full album‚Ä¶Cathy Grier does not have that problem, whether playing fingerstyle blues, or mixing poppy chords with her strong voice‚Äù. In November 2004, she performed at Radio City Music Hall. The only cover song on the CD, Stevie Wonder‚Äôs ‚ÄúLove is in Need of Love Today‚Äù was chosen as a reaction to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and meant to express the need for love in tragic times. 2002-present Since her last album, Grier has performed in the Music Under New York program, which is sponsored by the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority to allow musicians to legally perform in New York City Subway stops. MTA - List of Music Under New York performers Grier has embraced the program, lauding it for providing free entertainment during a 2004 appearance on ABC's Insomni-Act program. However, on the Feb. 4, 2009, cover of AM New York, she was juxtaposed with the headline ‚ÄúPlayin‚Äô ain‚Äôt Payin‚Äô,‚Äù which documents the difficulty of earning money as a street performer in the recession. Playin' ain't Payin, AM New York, Feb. 4, 2009 She responded to the headline with a new alias and blog, NYCsubwaygirl, where she highlights the advantages of the MUNY program. She has performed in Joe‚Äôs Pub to a sold out crowd (June 2010). Joe‚Äôs Pub listing ‚Äúlocal singer-songwriter and activist Cathy Grier plays a mean slide guitar and sings twice as beguilingly as pretty much any American Idol starlet half her age; at her best, she sounds like a bluesier Carole King.‚Äù A favorite performer for non-profit organizations Cathy has entertained to benefit Art For Animals, Habitat For Humanity, NY Junior League, to name a few. As an active supporter of green home building, Grier has also been featured in Natural Home Magazine (Nov/Dec 2006) for her Columbia County, New York, home that implements passive solar design and nontoxic, eco-friendly materials (Dennis Wedlick, architect). An article she wrote about the process of building a healthy home was published in New York House and has been reprinted in various national publications. From 2006 to 2008 she was a member of the zoning commission for her town. She is currently working on her next recording and writing for her blog, NYCsubwaygirl.

At that time the company was located in Warren, Ohio; owners were brothers James Ward Packard and William Doud Packard and investor George Lewis Weiss. Model G was a development of the former single-cylinder cars the company had built since 1899 of which the last, Model F, was offered alongside the Model G. Introduction was in late summer 1902. Only four cars were built.  Chassis  The pressed steel frame of the Model G was new although it followed earlier principles. With a wheelbase of 91 in. (2,311 mm) it was the longest yet. Track was 56 in. (1,422 mm), in fact 0.5 in. (12.7 mm) less than Model F's. The car had the then-usual right hand steering. It was among the first US automobiles that featured a steering wheel instead of a tiller. Road wheels were non-detachable and of the artillery wheel type. Each had 14 wood spokes. Front and rear wheels had the same dimensions with 36 x 4.5 in. pneumatic tires. Model G had very big wheels hubs which gave the car a characteristic look. Suspension consisted of a semi- elliptical leaf springs in front and elliptical at the rear. There were two brakes; one actuated the transmission by a lever outside of the bodywork that actuated, the other, operated by pedal, the differential.  Engine and Transmission  As with all Packards to date, the Model G's engine was placed under the driver's bench and laterally mounted, the crank protruding out of the right side. As mentioned, it was derived from the single-cylinder variant for which Packard already had a good reputation. Construction consisted of two single-cylinder engines that were connected in a horizontal opposed position and worked on a common crank shaft. Blocks were cast iron with non-detachable cylinder heads. Cylinders had a bore and stroke of 6 x 6 1/2 in. (152.4 √ó 165.1 mm) each, resulting in a displacement of 184 c.i (3,015 cm¬≥) per cylinder and huge 368 c.i. (6,030 cm¬≥) for the whole engine. Packard used a Longuemar float-feed carburetor for each cylinder. Ignition advance was manual. Power rating (following then-actual practice) was 24 H.P. As introduced with the Model F, Model G also adopted a front-mounted, tough bigger, radiator. This led the car appear, together with the storage place behind it, as a front-engined automobile. Gearbox was sliding gear, with three speeds forward plus reverse. Power transmission to the rear wheels worked via a single, center mounted chain which itself was connected to the differential.  Coachwork  Model G was a huge car for the time, weighing in at about . Packard offered it with two body styles: Either as a four-passenger Surrey or an eight-passenger Tonneau (sometimes called a \\"Rear Tonneau Roadster\\"). The surrey had neither front nor rear doors and came with two forward-facing benches. The tonneau had one bench in front plus two more placed longitudally. Access to the ladder was by a small door in the rear. There were no front doors. Coachwork was made of high quality using wood, probably by a local carriage builder as with other Packards. The customer had a free choice of colors. Upholstery was of qual quality, executed with top grain leather. Included with the base price were a pair of Dietz oil lamps, a Speed-O-Meter, and gauges for fuel and oil, each installed on the respective tank. An ignition switch was optional. The actual MSRP is not known but considering the smaller Model F tonneau being priced at $2,500 it is a close guess that the more complex Model G cost over $3,000.  Appreciation  While in 1902 alone, 179 Packard Model F left the plant in Warren, only 4 Model G were built. It marked a high- and terminal point for the Ohio Automobile Co. in many ways. It was the last Packard vastly developed by chief engineer and vice president Wiliam A. Hatcher who left the company January 17, 1903 because he did not agree with the direction the company took. His successor, Frenchman Charles Schmidt lead Packard to more modern, European construction principles. Technically, Model G represents the end of the first generation Packards as it was the make's last buggy-styled passenger car (with the engine positioned under the driver's bench), the last with the noisy and not very reliable chain drive and, most important, the last with less than four cylinders. For a long time, J. W. Packard had been convinced that the single-cylinder engine was the power plant of the future. When it became obvious that the industry would lead another way, Packard followed suit with four-cylinder automobiles already in 1903. Thus, Model G remained the only passenger car with a twin (there also were some two-cylinder trucks), survived by the Model F by another year. One of the customers who bought a Model G was William Rockefeller, younger brother of John D. Rockefeller. Of the four Model G's built, one still exists in a private collection. It is a surrey with a canopy and painted red. References  * \\"Packard\\", George H. Dammann und James A.

The collision killed 21 people: 17 Canadian soldiers en route to the Korean War and the two-man locomotive crew of each train. The post-crash investigation found that the order given to the troop train differed from the intended message. Crucial words were missing, causing the troop train to proceed on its way rather than halt on a siding, resulting in the collision. A telegraph operator, Alfred John \\"Jack\\" Atherton, was charged with manslaughter; the Crown alleged that he was negligent in passing an incomplete message. His family hired his Member of Parliament, John Diefenbaker, as defence counsel. Diefenbaker joined the British Columbia bar to take the case, and obtained Atherton's acquittal. After the accident, the CNR installed block signals on the stretch of track on which the crash occurred. The railway later realigned the main line in that area, eliminating a sharp curve that prevented crews from seeing oncoming trains. Diefenbaker's successful defence of Atherton became an asset in his political rise. A number of monuments honour the dead.  Crash  Cedarside, looking westbound in the direction of Canoe River, August 2011. The troop train should have stopped at Cedarside siding (righthand track). On November 21, 1950, a westbound troop train, Passenger Extra 3538 West‚Äîconsisting of the S-2-a class 2-8-2 steam locomotive 3538 and 17 cars, about half of which had wood bodies with steel underframes‚Äîwas travelling from Camp Shilo, Manitoba to Fort Lewis, Washington. It was carrying 23 officers and 315 men of 2nd Regiment, Royal Canadian Horse Artillery (RCHA) for deployment to the Korean War, a movement dubbed Operation Sawhorse. The train was moving through the Rocky Mountains on the CNR transcontinental mainline. CNR Train No. 2, the eastbound Continental Limited, consisted of the U-1-a class 4-8-2 steam locomotive 6004 and eleven all-steel cars and was en route from Vancouver to Montreal. By 1950, the CNR used the part-wooden cars only for the transportation of soldiers; other passengers were no longer carried in them. After the 1947 Dugald rail accident, the Board of Transport Commissioners had ordered that wooden passenger coaches not be placed between all-steel cars. However, under the terms of that decision, General Order Number 707, the wooden cars with steel underframes did not count as \\"wooden cars\\". CNR dispatcher A. E. Tisdale meant to send both trains identical orders to \\"meet\\" (get past each other) on a mostly single-track section. His intended order read \\"Psgr Extra 3538 West meet No. 2 Eng 6004 at Cedarside and No. 4 Eng 6057 Gosnell.\\" (Cedarside and Gosnell were sidings where trains could wait to allow opposing traffic to clear.) Tisdale dictated the order from his office in Kamloops, British Columbia, to Alfred John \\"Jack\\" Atherton, the operator at Red Pass Junction, for delivery to Passenger Extra 3538 West, the troop train, and to F.E. Parsons, the operator at Blue River, westbound from Red Pass Junction, for delivery to No. 2, the Continental. The words \\"at Cedarside\\" did not appear in the order as copied down by Atherton to be handed to the troop train crew. Parsons's version of the order accorded with Tisdale's, and was passed to the Continental and to Train No. 4\\\\. According to Hugh A. Halliday in his history of Canadian railroad wrecks, \\"it would have been one man's word against the other, but the Blue River operator had been on the line at the same time. Parsons backed up Tisdale's version of events; Atherton would be cast firmly as the culprit in this affair.\\" When the westbound troop train stopped at Red Pass Junction, Atherton gave the incorrect written order to train conductor John A. Mainprize. As the full order had been passed to the eastbound Continental, its crew expected to meet the troop train at Cedarside, eastbound from Blue River; the crew aboard the troop train expected to meet the Continental and another train at Gosnell westbound from Cedarside. With neither train crew aware of anything wrong, the troop train passed Cedarside and the Continental passed Gosnell. Both trains were travelling at moderate speeds, and attempted to negotiate a sharp curve from opposite ends. Thomas W. Tindall, a forestry employee, saw the two trains approaching each other from an embankment; he tried to signal the Continental crew, who responded to his frantic signals with a friendly wave. The two crews did not realise that a collision was imminent until the last moment, and the trains struck head-on at 10:35 a.m. The accident occurred south of Valemount, east of a small station named Canoe River, westbound from Cedarside. The crash took place on the only stretch (18-mile (29 km) long) of CNR mainline in the mountains not protected by automatic block signals. The leading cars of each train were derailed, while those which had been part of the troop train were demolished. According to testimony at the inquiry, most of the deaths were caused by steam from the troop train's ruptured boiler penetrating the damaged cars. At the moment of the crash, two soldiers, Gunners William Barton and Roger Bowe, both of Newfoundland, were buying cigarettes at the newsstand aboard the train. The structure of the newsstand shielded them in the crash, and they survived. Their fellow Newfoundlanders, Gunners Joseph Thistle and James A. White, standing just a few feet away, were not shielded by the newsstand and perished.  Rescue  People from the nearby settlement of Valemount hurried to the scene and found the troop cars damaged beyond recognition. Some had collapsed in the disaster; rescuers used axes and hammers to break into them. There were no medical supplies aboard the troop train, and the only medical officer on board had disembarked in Edmonton. First-aid kits on that train proved empty; a box labelled \\"Medical Stores\\" was found to contain only contraceptives. Dr. P. S. Kimmett of Edson, Alberta, a passenger on the Continental, took charge of efforts to aid the injured with his wife, a nurse. Kimmett supervised efforts to aid 50 people despite having almost no supplies or trained personnel. One soldier, still alive, appeared to have not an inch of skin on his body unscalded; another had a chunk of glass piercing his chest from front to back. With the exception of the engine and tender of the Continental, which were demolished, there was little damage to the eastbound train. Several of the passengers on the Continental suffered minor injuries. One dining car on the troop train was used as a hospital, another as a morgue. James Henderson, a young officer on the troop train, recalled: > I talked with one soldier who lay shivering in a bunk in the hospital coach. > He had no visible sign of injury but his face was a ghastly green shade. He > wanted more blankets and a cigarette, and I gave him both. An hour later, I > helped move his body to the other coach. At the time of the crash, the temperature was about , and there were about of snow on the ground. The telephone lines next to the track were cut by the accident, but a crewman managed to make an emergency call to Jasper in Alberta. Because the crash site was away, medical relief took three hours to arrive. A work engine, in the interim, took the movable coaches of the troop train back along the track as far as Cedarside. The hospital train brought eight nurses and two doctors from Jasper, who spent the trip making what preparations they could. On arrival, they found patients with severe injuries. \\"There was hardly a case with only one type of trauma.\\" That rescue train transported the injured to Edmonton from the crash scene. The Jasper doctors left the train when the rescue train reached there, again placing Dr. Kimmett in charge. He remained so until the civilians were relieved by Army personnel from Edmonton, who joined the train in Edson. Major Francis P. Leask, commanding the soldiers, praised Dr. Kimmett's work, \\"We couldn't have gotten along without him\\" and also praised his men, both veterans and recruits, for their calm, efficient work in the disaster. Wintry weather made subsequent attempts to recover the dead difficult; four bodies were never found. Transcontinental traffic was rerouted temporarily onto Canadian Pacific tracks through Calgary as the CNR attempted to clear the tracks. The work was hampered by an explosion and fire that broke out on the morning of November 22, consuming many of the wrecked cars and likely the missing bodies, and the wreckage was cleared by that evening, allowing traffic to resume the following day. On November 29, 1950, the remaining soldiers left Camp Wainwright, Alberta, where they had been taken after being evacuated to Edmonton, resuming their journey to Korea. The death toll had been 20, including 16 soldiers. Twelve soldiers and the two two-man locomotive crews died in or shortly after the crash; four soldiers died on the rescue train en route to hospital in Edmonton. A 17th soldier, Gunner David Owens, died in an Edmonton hospital on December 9, bringing the death toll to 21. Owens had suffered severe burns, and was believed on the way to recovery when he suffered a relapse. Gunner Art Evoy, a survivor of the crash, recalled the eeriness of the first roll call at Wainwright, \\"It was a very small group that answered the roll call that day.\\" Inquiry Within days of the crash, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), as the provincial police for British Columbia, began an investigation. The site of the crash was under the jurisdiction of the RCMP detachment in Prince George, British Columbia, and any charges would be laid there. The CNR suspended all trainmen involved in passing the order to the troop train and held an internal inquiry at Kamloops. The Board of Transport Commissioners announced that a public inquiry would be held at Edmonton in December 1950. CNR engine 6004 (shown in 1943) drew the Continental and was destroyed in the wreck. Atherton, aged 22, was dismissed by the CNR before the Edmonton hearings. He testified that there was a lengthy gap in transmission, and that he did not hear the words \\"at Cedarside\\". Although railway regulations called for him to listen to a repeat of the order by the telegrapher at Blue River, he did not do so and instead continued with his other duties, passing the message to the troop train without the vital two words. He denied repeating back the order to dispatcher Tisdale with the two words included. Tisdale testified to passing the order by telephone to Blue River and to Red Pass Junction, and that it was correctly read back to him by both operators. He also testified to a brief gap in communications several days before the crash, saying that in the rough country through which the railway line passed it was not uncommon for objects falling against the communication line to cause brief outages. Parsons also testified that Atherton had correctly repeated back the order. Testimony to the inquiry established the damage to the troop train and those on it. The wooden cars with steel underframes gave little resistance to the impact, unlike the Continental's steel cars. A CNR official testified that it would cost $127 million to replace all such cars with modern steel ones. Dr. Kimmett testified, stating that though he had six bottles of penicillin when he began his work, no syringe could be found to administer it. When a syringe was later found, five of the bottles could no longer be located. No heating was available on the troop train until the arrival of the emergency locomotive from Red Pass Junction, and no blood plasma had been brought on the hospital train‚Äînone was available until the injured reached Jasper. Dr. Kimmett testified that it was \\"very difficult\\" to administer plasma on the train, and that two men died between Jasper and Edson. The Board of Transport Commissioners issued its report on January 18, 1951. It avoided assigning individual responsibility for the deaths and urged the CNR to install block signals on the section of line where the accident took place. The Board noted that the CNR already had a policy of installing such signals, though they were expensive and difficult to obtain from the United States, and that the CNR had deemed other sections of the line more dangerous. It also urged additional training, to ensure that messages were transmitted accurately, and safety checks to catch instances where messages were transmitted incorrectly.  Prosecution  Hiring of counsel, arrest John Diefenbaker, seen soon after his election to the House of Commons, 1940. In anticipation of charges being laid against his son, Atherton's father approached Member of Parliament and King's Counsel John Diefenbaker in December 1950 and sought to retain him as defence counsel. The Athertons were Diefenbaker's constituents; their hometown, Zealandia, Saskatchewan, was in his riding, Lake Centre. Diefenbaker declined the case, stating that Parliament had first call on his time, that his wife Edna was seriously ill with leukemia, and that he was not admitted as a lawyer in British Columbia. As Edna Diefenbaker was well known as an influence over her husband, in desperation Alfred Atherton Sr. talked his way into her Saskatoon hospital room. In his memoirs, Diefenbaker did not mention the elder Atherton's initial approach but wrote that he was in Australia at a parliamentary conference at the time of the Canoe River crash. An Australian lawyer pointed out the case to Diefenbaker; he thought it interesting but noted that he was not a member of the Law Society of British Columbia. Diefenbaker wrote that he planned to meet Edna in Hawaii on his way back from Australia. Instead she wired him, requesting that he meet her in Vancouver. Diefenbaker related that he found his wife in a Saskatoon hospital, in the final stages of the illness that would kill her (she died on February 7, 1951). She told him that Jack Atherton had been to see her and that the soldiers' deaths were from being transported in wooden train cars. \\"Everyone in the CNR is running away from responsibility for what appears to have been a grievous disregard for human lives.\\" John Diefenbaker objected that the bar examination in British Columbia was notoriously difficult and that the application fee was $1,500. Edna Diefenbaker informed her husband, \\"I told him you'd take it\\", and eventually her husband gave in. Atherton was arrested for manslaughter on January 9, 1951, in Saskatoon and was taken to Prince George by the RCMP. After his dismissal by the CNR, Atherton was staying with his parents at Zealandia, where his father was CNR station agent. The manslaughter charge concerned the death of Henry Proskunik, fireman aboard the troop train. Bail was set at $5,000, and Magistrate P.J. Moran required any sureties to appear before him, making it difficult for Atherton's connections in Saskatchewan to obtain his release. Atherton was released from custody on January 24, as Prince George furniture store owner Alex Moffat and local CNR employee William Reynolds each posted sureties valued at $2,500. After his wife's death in February 1951, Diefenbaker travelled to Vancouver in early March to take the British Columbia bar examination, which the Prince George Citizen called \\"a formality which will cost him $1500\\". (Failure to pass the bar would effectively disqualify Diefenbaker from the Atherton case because he would have to wait for reexamination, and the preliminary hearing was set for mid-March.) He paid his fee and was then given an oral examination by the bar secretary, which in full was: Diefenbaker was then congratulated for being the first applicant to pass the British Columbia bar exam with a perfect score.  Hearings and trial  The preliminary hearing began on March 13, 1951, and lasted three days, during which the Crown called 20 witnesses. Diefenbaker alleged that the rules of the CNR did not require that the telegraph operator listen to the repeat of his message, but merely recommended that he should. Nevertheless, Diefenbaker's motion to dismiss was unsuccessful and Atherton was committed for trial before the Supreme Court of British Columbia (a trial- level court). Manslaughter was a charge for which the accused did not have the option of a speedy trial before a county court judge, and Atherton's case was set for the Spring Assizes in Prince George. The trial began on May 9, 1951. Colonel Eric Pepler, a World War I veteran and British Columbia's deputy attorney general, led for the Crown while Diefenbaker led for the defence. To a CNR official on the stand, Diefenbaker said, \\"I suppose the reason you put these soldiers in wooden cars with steel cars on either end was so that no matter what they might subsequently find in Korea, they'd always be able to say, 'Well we had worse than that in Canada'.\\" Colonel Pepler objected, stating that Diefenbaker had not asked a question. Diefenbaker responded, \\"My Lord, it was made clear by the elevation of my voice at the end of the sentence that there was a great big question mark on it.\\" The judge, Justice A.D. McFarlane, began to rule, but Pepler interjected, \\"I want to make it clear that in this case we are not concerned about the death of a few privates going to Korea.\\" Pepler intended to remind the judge that Atherton was charged in relation to the death of only the troop train fireman, but Diefenbaker pounced: \\"Oh, you're not concerned about the killing of a few privates? Oh, Colonel!\\" Diefenbaker recounted that a veteran, sitting on the jury, expressed shock at Pepler's comment, and Diefenbaker lost no opportunity during the rest of the trial to address Pepler as \\"Colonel\\". The two lead counsel clashed again during their final addresses to the jury, with Pepler objecting to Diefenbaker's use of testimony from the preliminary hearing. Justice McFarlane stated to Pepler, \\"I do not think you should object like this\\", and when Pepler persisted, the judge \\"roared\\" at him, \\"Please, just stop this.\\" Diefenbaker stated, \\"I sat and suffered while my learned friend misconstrued the evidence\\" and when he noticed Pepler muttering under his breath, said to him, \\"You are growling\\", to which Pepler replied, \\"Yes I am growling. I am objecting too.\\" Diefenbaker suggested to the jury that the silence on the line which had, he contended, swallowed the words \\"at Cedarside\\" might have been caused by a fish dropped on a snow-covered line by a bird and claimed to have evidence of a previous occurrence. He noted in his memoirs that the incident \\"was not well documented, but it was all we had\\". He blamed the disaster on Tisdale, stating that lack of the word \\"at\\" before \\"Gosnell\\" in the order indicated that the Kamloops dispatcher had not been paying attention, and that he should have noticed that, according to Diefenbaker, the words \\"at Cedarside\\" were missing from Atherton's repeat of the order. The trial had taken four days; the lawyers argued for five hours; Diefenbaker's summation took three of them. Justice McFarlane took an hour to charge the jury. McFarlane told the jurors that if they believed that Atherton had passed the order to conductor Mainprize in the same form he had received it, they would be justified in acquitting him. The jury returned after 40 minutes of deliberations. Jury foreman Fred Mounkley announced the acquittal of Atherton, as Atherton's mother wept.  Aftermath  A freight train passes on realigned track near the disaster site Monument raised to the soldiers who died in the crash by the Royal Canadian Horse Artillery near the Canoe River crash site The CNR adopted the inquiry recommendations, installing block signalling in the area of the accident. In 1953, it modernised its passenger fleet, ordering 302 new cars. In later years, the line was rerouted to eliminate the sharp curve on which the disaster took place. Atherton went to work for the Saskatchewan Transportation Company and settled in Saskatoon. Pepler retired in 1954, having served 20 years as British Columbia's deputy attorney general. He subsequently served as one of British Columbia's commissioners on uniform provincial laws and embarked on a revision of the rules of the British Columbia Supreme Court before dying on November 16, 1957, at age 66 in a suburban Vancouver hospital. Diefenbaker had represented Atherton at his own expense, though donations from railroad employees reimbursed him for about half his costs. The case had been followed throughout Canada's railway community, and on his return to Ottawa, Diefenbaker was widely congratulated for his victory. By 1957, he had become Leader of the Opposition and Progressive Conservative Party leader, and when he campaigned in Saskatchewan during that year's election, Atherton travelled to Regina to greet him, skipping his own wedding rehearsal. As Diefenbaker campaigned in British Columbia, the Vancouver Sun reported on the large, enthusiastic crowds he gathered, and noted that he remained well remembered in Prince George for his defence of Atherton. Diefenbaker's biographer, Denis Smith, wrote of the Atherton case: > Diefenbaker had won a popular victory, redeemed his promise to Edna, and > endeared himself for life to Jack Atherton and his fellow railway workers. > The case was celebrated in the press and became one of his major political > assets. Diefenbaker won the election and, on June 21, 1957, became Prime Minister of Canada.  Memorials and tributes  The RCHA suffered more casualties in the crash than it did in its first year of fighting in Korea. A monument to the soldiers who died stands at CFB Shilo (as Camp Shilo has been redesignated), where a memorial parade is conducted each year on the anniversary of the crash. It was dedicated on November 21, 1952. A memorial cairn was erected near the crash site by the regiment in 1987. A special remembrance was held in Valemount for the 60th anniversary of the disaster in 2010. The CNR has also raised a monument near the site of the disaster. The names of the military dead are inscribed in the Korea Book of Remembrance and are also on the Wall of Remembrance in Brampton, Ontario; they may also be found on the Korea Cairn at Winnipeg Brookside Cemetery. Manitoba has named a lake for Gunner William D. Wright, who died in the crash. In 2003, as part of Remembrance Week observances for the Canadian Senate, five family members of the soldiers who died in the crash were presented with Memorial Crosses. Other family members were due to receive them at a later date. The dead were not given posthumous Canadian Volunteer Service Medals as they never reached the Korean theatre; Tom Boutillier, a survivor of the crash, considers that an injustice and has campaigned for medals to be awarded.

Early life and education The son of Iain and brother of Natasha and Calum, McNicol was raised in Thirdpart, West Kilbride and attended Ardrossan Academy. He studied at Dundee Institute of Technology, where he began his involvement in political organising when being elected as president of the Student Union in 1991.  Early political career  McNicol was elected National Campaigns and Membership Officer for Labour Students, and then acted as a Labour Party organiser and agent in south and east England from 1994 to 1997. Following the 1997 United Kingdom general election at which Labour returned to office, McNicol served as a research, organisation, and political officer with the GMB Union, and in 1998 was appointed a regional organiser for its Southern Region. In 2004, he was promoted to National Political Officer. He served in that capacity through to 2011, coordinating the political strategy of the union and representing its members‚Äô interests in both the public and private sector. General Secretary On 19 July 2011, Labour's National Executive Committee selected McNicol to become the party's next General Secretary under leader Ed Miliband. He was seen as the 'change candidate' and chosen against the wishes of Miliband, who supported the alternative candidate Chris Lennie.https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2011/07/26/labours-new-general- secre_n_908642.html McNicol's intention to stand down as General Secretary of the Labour Party was announced on 23 February 2018. On 20 March 2018 he was succeeded by Jennie Formby. 2016 Labour Party leadership election In June and July 2016, the Financial Times reported the office of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn believed McNicol tried to prevent Corbyn from attending a key National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting and reported McNicol was alleged to be complicit in trying to exclude Corbyn from entering the second leadership election. It reported senior figures in the trade union movement were discussing replacement options for McNicol in his General Secretary role. A civil High Court legal challenge was brought by Labour donor and former parliamentary candidate Michael Foster to contest the decision to allow Corbyn to be a candidate without having to secure any nominations from Labour MPs. The case went to court on 26 July 2016. McNicol was the first defendant on behalf of the members of the Labour Party. Corbyn applied to the court, and was accepted, to be a second defendant with his own legal team as Corbyn was \\"particularly affected and particularly interested in the proper construction of the rules\\" and that McNicol was \\"being expected to vigorously defend a position which he regarded as incorrect prior to the NEC decision\\". The High Court ruled that the NEC's decision that Corbyn should automatically be on the ballot was a correct interpretation of the Labour Party Rule Book.> An additional court case was brought against McNicol in August 2016 regarding the NEC's decision to disallow party members who had joined after 12 January 2016 from voting in the leadership election. The claimants won their case in the High Court but the decision was overturned on appeal.BBC - \\"Labour leadership: Members drop voting legal challenge\\" 14 August 2016 Handling of antisemitism complaints and other controversies In May 2019, Jon Lansman the founder of Momentum writing in the LabourList blog accused McNicol and his team of delaying action on handling antisemitism cases while he was General Secretary, and allowing a backlog of cases to build up which would damage the party and Jeremy Corbyn's leadership. In April 2020 a leaked report commissioned by McNicol's successor Jennie Formby, purportedly for submission to the Equality and Human Rights Commission's investigation into anti-semitism within the Labour Party, published various WhatsApp message group transcripts which purported to show that McNicol and members of his office failed to deal with anti-semitism cases, worked against the objectives of the leadership of the Party, worked against Labour's objective of winning the 2017 general election, and made offensive comments about Labour members, staff, and politicians. On 1 May 2020, the members of an investigation panel appointed by the Labour Party to look into various aspects of the report were announced. Peerage On 21 June 2018, McNicol was created a life peer as Baron McNicol of West Kilbride, of West Kilbride in the County of Ayrshire. On 4 September 2018, McNicol was appointed an Opposition Whip on the House of Lords frontbench. As a result of the disclosures in the April 2020 report, McNicol stepped down from this role while an investigation was carried out. Personal life McNicol is married to Shelley and has a son, Hamish, and daughter, Scarlett. He holds a black belt in karate.

They are called the Corrida of Grmeƒç (Grmeƒçka korida) and have been organised on every first Sunday in August for over 200 years, attracting thousands of visitors. These are fights between bulls themselves and there is no death of a bull. Fights happen in an empty field. The Corrida of Grmeƒç was depicted by the sculptor Slobodan Pejiƒá. The sculpture of two bulls in a fight, made in bronze in 2004, has been compared to a confrontation of the oppressor and the oppressed or of the Bosnian people and the Austrian Emperor.

It was part of the wider English Local Elections, which were postponed from their usual date of the first Thursday of May so that they could coincide with the General Election of that year. One third of the council was up for election and the Conservative party stayed in overall control of the council. Background Between the 2008 election and 2010, 2 Conservatives councillors left the party. Husband and wife Phil and Christine Heath split from the Conservatives in 2008 and formed the Basingstoke First Community Party, which would contest the 2010 election. Election result The results saw the Conservatives increase their majority on the council from 5 to 7 seats, after making 1 gain to have 34 councillors. They retook Kempshott, which had formerly been held by the leader of the Basingstoke First Community Party, Christine Heath. Heath did not defend the seat which she had held for the previous 7 years, instead she stood in Hatch Warren and Beggarwood ward, which was held by the Conservatives. The other parties retained all the seats they had been defending, meaning the Liberal Democrats remained on 14 seats, Labour 9 and independents 2, while the Basingstoke First Community Party was left with 1 seat which was not contested at the election.

Notable peaks are Nadkrstac (2110 m.), Locika (2106 m.), Rosinj (2059 m.) and Scit (1949 m.). Thick shrubs of Pinus Mugo replace mixed forest -mostly beech- above 1400 m.

It is the most northerly extent of the Rastkogel Massif and can therefore be seen from almost anywhere in the Lower Inn Valley.  Location and countryside  The summit bears a large cross, as do the two northwesterly subpeaks (Wetterkreuz) and the northeasterly Sonntagsk√∂pfl (2,244 m). Hollowed out of its eastern flank is Das Kar, a nearly three-quarters enclosed rock basin (Felskessel). It is drained by the Lamarkbach stream into the lower Zillertal valley. Although the massif of Gilfert-Rastkogel has a very distinctive ridge with many branches, the rock faces are mainly oriented in a north-south direction. This geological feature gives the heavily divided mountain group its own character.  Paths  The summit of the Gilfert is easily climbed from Innerst near Weerberg (south side of the Inn valley) via the Nonsalm (1,785 m). The route from Innerst to Nonsalm can be climbed as a ski tour or with snow shoes in the winter and spring, because the route is relatively safe from avalanches. A second route runs almost parallel to it from Pill or the district town of Schwaz up to the summit. File:20071225-Nonsalm am Gilfert MQ.jpg|Nonsalm am Gilfert File:20071225-Gilfert MQ.jpg|Ski ascent of the Gilfert in December  Ski region versus nature reserve  For many years discussions have taken place over whether to develop the Gilfert as a ski region, or designate it as a nature reserve. On the one hand, it has been envisaged for a long while to create a Gilfert-Rastkogel reserve (Ruhegebiet). On the other hand, the Inn valley municipalities around Weer have striven to provide access to the Hochf√ºgen-Hochzillertal ski region, whose facilities would extend to the ridge. A regional planning policy decision about the future of the Central Alps around Hintertux is pending.

In the 1850s, following the death of his wife, Boott took his young daughter Elizabeth (Lizzie) (1846‚Äì88) to Florence, Italy, where he studied harmony with Luigi Picchianti. Boott became an honorary professor at the Academy of Fine Arts. He was friends with others in the Anglophone community in Florence, including Henry and William James, the Brownings, Isa Blagden and Constance Fenimore Woolson. Francis Boott and his daughter Lizzie Boott lived at the Villa Castellani in the Bellosguardo heights. Lizzie became a painter, and married the painter Frank Duveneck, who went to live with her and her father in the villa. The novelist Henry James visited them there and used the villa as a model for Italian villas in his Roderick Hudson and The Portrait of a Lady. In 1888 Boott returned to America,Upton, Art Song in America, p. 51 and continued to compose music. He died on 1 March 1904 at the age of 91 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Boott bequeathed $10,000 to Harvard University as a prize fund for the best 4-part vocal work written by a Harvard student. In 1960 the amount was increased to $15,246 through capital gains. The prize continues to be awarded by the Harvard University Department of Music.Harvard University and New England Conservatory Five-year AB/MM Program in Music. fas.harvard.edu Music Twenty Years.

Boston, Oliver Ditson & Co., 1871 Boott's first six songs appeared in 1846 under the pen name of Telford; Upton described them as \\"quite undistinguished\\".Upton, p. 52 In 1857 eight songs were published, followed by many individual songs in the following years. Boott composed at least 140 songs during his long life, as well as a handful of duets, choral works, part- songs, and instrumental works. He also composed hymns for church services, many of which were included in the hymnal for King's Chapel in Boston. While his melodies and piano accompaniments are considered \\"commonplace, with little harmonic interest\\",Upton, p. 53 his choices of texts were sophisticated, embracing the literary world of his time. In 1857 John Sullivan Dwight wrote that his songs are \\"not strikingly original, but graceful and facile, much to be preferred to the popular sweetish, sentimental type\\".Quoted in Upton, p. 53 Musical compositions Songs for voice and piano : under the pseudonym Telford: *Six Songs, 1846, G.
